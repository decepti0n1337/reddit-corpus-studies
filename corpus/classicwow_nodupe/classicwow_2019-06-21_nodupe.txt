Why?
---
---
---
Update : Turns out STV is empty AF. Also server pop has hit rock bottom .
---

---
I'd like to thanks all the retail players who turned this amazing **beta test** into early access and eventually burned out after the first month.
---
It’s a silly meme. Kinda like “your a 90s kid if u remember this”
---
They're making it harder for players. They should mark servers with languages with the same % as on retail. 
---
What's the point in developing that shitty layering system to help with day 1 queues if all user experience will be totally ruined once a player realizes 37 levels into the game that's they're on unofficial french realm.
---
People are literally organizing unofficial language servers on the official forums already. You'll be fine :p
---
The good ones play on the english realms. Most of the ones that aren't confident enough in their english to roll on an english server also tend to be the ones worse at the game.
---
It's not exactly hard.
---
30, 2 kids, wild of Warcraft. Had my daughter(4) keyboard turning over the weekend and it was the best thing ever
---
I agree with everything you said. Still doesn't change the fact that Venruki is the greatest mage of all time and will find his footing just fine in Vanilla.
---
&gt;A lot of them played on French servers, they are the coolest people on earth dude
---
I imagine they suck up to the actual French. You're the first person I've heard of calling them cool. Cool implies chill, they have no chill.
---
What does this has anything to do with the sub reddit? 
---
This is an idea that limit number of people to stress test. Ofc the message on OP post show up.

Haha of course! Such is your duty and privilege as the older brother!

---
please have a look at the 2nd VOD in OP's post to see the layering abuse in practice
---
To be fair, Diablo is a demon, would make plenty of sense with a Warlock.
---
LOL
---
You’re failing to understand what layering is if you think they CANT layer the starting zones and NOT the whole continent
---
&gt;We all didn't start playing World of Warcraft at the exact same moment (release day), so why should we now?
---
Same reason every other game that does a global launch does it... because they can.
---
Was looking for confirmation on RP-PvP. This looks to be it, but it's still vague?
---
&gt;We’ve prepared several realms, which will include Player vs Player, Player vs Environment, and Role-playing realms.
---
Both RP-PvP and RP-PvE are _Role-playing realms_ but I assume Taeps means RP-PvE only?
---
Wait until they find out there's only 2 PVP, 2 PVE, and 1 RP realms for all of Europe. Then they're really gonna shit the bed.
---
You'll still play on the 27th.
---
Bad part is - blizzard knows this :)
---
&gt; If Classic goes live with nothing to alleviate overpopulation, the game may be borderline unplayable. 
---
Pretty straight forward fix. Allow people to easily transfer to other realms for free instead of milking it for cash and artificially creating this problem. Maybe put some basic rules to avoid abuse, like amount of transfer per x amount of time, things you cannot move from one realm to another etc...

---
I can change it to any other language of your choosing, sorry if you feel offended because i decided to pick one language out of a thousand others. Maybe ill change it to English? 
---
My post wasn't made because i don't want to communicate or play with other people who speak other languages, it's because i don't want to play in a community where nobody can communicate with each other.
---
https://invidio.us/watch?v=cPv-A4FPW8M
---
Same here! glad it's still there... wait, no, that was weeks ago!
---
I am suspicious simply because the stuff people describe on private servers sounds a lot easier than my leveling experience in vanilla.
---
It could just be I was terrible back then though.
---
Combat text from WF is still bugged it seems.. Looks horrible.
---
"Do you guys not speak german?"
---
"Yeah, you guys all speak spanish, right?"
---
&gt; Youll just have specific guilds for each nations language
---
No you wont. You gonna have all french guilds stack up on one server, all german on the other, etc. It will be Warsong occupation by russian speaking players all over again.
---
Blizzard must be expecting very low population retention to only have such limited server options. Seems odd to me, this sub alone has 141k subscribers.
---
I had a buddy who rolled priest in vanilla. He wanted to play shadow priest and leveled that way. When raiding started the guild we were in wouldn't bring shadow priests because we were always short healers. He hated it and eventually rerolled to a mage.
---
&gt;Layering feels WAAAAY worse than dynamic spawns being instant.
---
So you're advocating for an actual, visible change away from vanilla? That won't go over very well.
---
&gt;Pserver launches were epic, felt awesome. It wasn't even close to "impossible to do anything". If you really wanted to get quests done you could literally sit there and camp the same wolf that respawned every 5 seconds. If not, you could run around like normal and take in all the players and spawns going nuts. Felt like a world event.
---
There has never been a private server launch on the scale of what we're going to see for Classic.
---
&gt;On the stress test yesterday there were over 50+ people in the barrens and crossroads was literally completely empty for me. Not a single person. I walked from Mulgore all the way through XR to Durotar and saw ZERO people, even in xr. Felt worse than retail.
---
That doesn't mean anything about layering though. Do you actually understand the concept of it? If (and that's a big if) it was layering that was causing you to not see people, that's a bug and not how it's intended to be.
---
What is your goal? They’re super fun to play and a wonderful experience in the leveling game. Really fun in PvP but very limited numbers in raids. So if you’re planning on enjoying the 1-60 game or casually play and then do pvp (even word pvp) then go for it. If you’re planning on rushing to 60 then raiding ... you’ll most likely be asked to respec to healing. 
---
Having said that I’m rolling priest because healing in this game is actually really entertaining.
---
Lol
---
Trap the mob in a freezing trap or make your pet tank it.
---
Christ, I didn't even think about that. Balls.
---
I like also how this is casually racist towards any language that isn't English. French doesn't use the same alphabet as English, nor does Polish, Czech, Swedish, Hungarian, Spanish, ...
---
It is. You can kill them, but if you have them macrod and timed to instantly kill for extended periods ( I think more than 3 times) it is considered griefing and you can be banned. It’s in the EULA. This applies to quest givers and flight masters.
---
My answer... Yes. 
---
I was a slow clicker, elemental shaman and got invited to so Gruul’s Lair to heal (dps top ups) We killed him after 4 wipes.  I died from the ceiling cave-ins 3 times! Honestly, 6-7 healing potions would have benefited the raid more than me. Hammer of the Naaru dropped and I rolled 0dkp and got it.  I immediately went to spec 2h maces and Windfury/self-healed in AV.  
---
tl;dr  it WAS hard to find 40 Raiders as I was a poor elemental spec Shaman, still invited to heal in multiple raids.
---
“You have a duolingo subscription don’t you?”
---
I'm pretty sure it only effects npcs.
---
which just goes to prove that the solution works in extreme population cases.  Classic launch is going to be very populated but nowhere near what pserver launches looked like
---
Honestly gold was not hard to make on the beta. I had 70 gold when I hit 40. And didn't work the auction house At all. Ask me seems Grey's sell for more then they did before
---
I don't care for Brexit :).
---
Us will probably be the best option, but as there will be many large communities from both YouTube and Twitch i'm concerned of the negative effects that might have. E.g never being able to get world boss kills or something else.
---
So everyone wants #nochanges and an authentic experience and to do that we have to have layering to avoid a problem that was pretty common on fresh servers in Vanilla.. 
---
Overcrowding happens..
---
that doesnt solve jack shit
---
Fohelvede
---
If this is the case, what exactly are we paying blizzard for? Might as well just play on private servers since they'll improve with classics data once some time passes. It's gonna be the same as private servers, everyone is gonna be real familiar with foreign language phrases for go 'fuck themselves' when they ask someone to communicate in English.
---
Back in the day, seems like at least 30% of priests were shadow, melting faces and such

---
Because this subreddit is so stupid at times, and this beta has made a lot of people even more stupid.
---
Idk why someone downvoted you. He must have called it that 15 times.
---
&gt; The game was awesome
---
Pservers are way overcrowded. I want my authentic vanilla experience. 3k player realm.
---
1) You can - but it might give you a false sense of confidence. There is a significant difference in difficulty between the two. 
---
2)WC3 will give you the lore up to before WoW started. While not necessary it will at least give you insight to certain locations of the game and give you a little more appreciation.
---
3)Play until you're stuck - then ask for help in game chat. If nobody helps you: then go to WoWhead. 
---
4)Don't worry about Endgame - you won't be there for a while. Ultimately all classes will have a useful spec for endgame. Some specs are considered "Useless" (Balance druids run out of mana too quick to be useful in long raid battles, Retribution Paladins don't put out nearly enough damage, etc) but there isn't a single class that isn't not only useful but almost necessary should you be willing to re-spec once you get there. 
---
But don't worry about that while leveling. There will be plenty of time for you to look up BIS and all that junk later. For your trip to 1-60 just... do what you want. Talk to people if you feel lost. Enjoy exploring the world. You are getting to view this entire new world with fresh eyes and I envy you.
---
I know that world bosses are 1 per server, I was saying your logic about the chest is just as dumb as what I said, irony at it's finest
---
All people will do is designate their own unofficial French/German/Italian etc servers themselves. Whatever behaviour Blizzard are trying to encourage will just not happen. The only thing this will result in is lots of players quiting because they got to level 40 before realising they accidentally rerolled on the 'wrong' realm. 
---
Guaranteed a week before launch the unofficial realms will have been decided with a mega thread stickied on the front page anyway. What a mind-numbingly bonkers decision. Like, how do you work a professional career in game design and think "yeah this is okay"
---
Pfft
---
I’ve seen it. I’ve seen it here, I’ve seen it there. I’ve seen it everywhere.
---
But you *STILL* aren’t comprehending that he is *NOT* abusing in it IN THE WAY HE CLAIMSHE CAN. FUCK. 
---
It is abuse, and an exploit for sure, one that’s been known for weeks now.  But he’s claiming he can choose his *SPECIFIC layer *at will* which he cannot. At best all he can do is switch to a layer his friend is on, but he can’t use his alts to select between layer 2,3,4 or whichever layer he wants.
---
Atleast we dont have to deal with russians. Im sick and tired of seeing them in bg on retail. Thank god blizzard.
---
As a day 1 player back in 2004 on a high pop relam, I welcome layering. Even with 2.5k population caps, the first few days were fucking brutal. EVERYTHING was dead ALL the time. Just as bad as starting zones on private servers during peak times.
---
Layering will be taken out in phase 2. I think a lot of people choose to ignore this.
---
People who don't want layering on day1 either didn't play launch in 2004 or don't remember the nightmares.
---
I'd bet they do exactly the same thing as BFA, not ow or d2.
---
This is an actual dealbreaker for me even more so than layering. Im german and i wouldve played on an english server anyway (i want to avoid the german community for many reasons). But i also cba playing with french/spanish or whatever people who cant even speak 3 sentences of english. 
---
Might end up playing on an US server instead - its not like ping matters much in classic anyway.
---
If we gotta designate as a community beforehand, so be it; it'll be to everyone's benefit. Let's keep an eye on the Classic discord when the realms list is published.
---
Only fun abilities are mind control and mind flay.
---
This makes me very worried there won’t be any oceanic servers and that would fucking suck
---
This happens all the time. Ion is essentially the head of Product, he speaks the company line and wont commit to anything. A developer thinks differently and isn't as schooled in communication to customers. This is why developers are rarely customer facing.

Layering isn't just about preventing overpopulation, it's also about preventing underpopulation so we don't need realm transfers and sharding later. As far as the potential exploits, Blizzard is obviously still working out the kinks and it won't be in the game for more than 2 months in any case. If they need to open up new realms or have queue times to shut down Layering, they will.
---
Any perceived advantage that can be gained in those 2 months will be massively overshadowed by gold sellers and buyers for the remainder of the game.
---
If you're really concerned about non-English players, play on a US realm. Most of the UK will be doing just that.
---
Gutgore Ripper is the only 40-man raid drop dps dagger until phase 2.  
---
    
---
@ u/Snowjob_tv Perdition's Blade and Core Hound Tooth were both implemented in 1.4, Gutgore Ripper was in from the start though and never changed during vanilla outside of a tooltip update to show the debuff duration of its proc.

So if someone farms a bunch of black lotus or devilsaur and sells them for gold. Then raid logs because they are rich. Who cares? I dont see how this is such a bummer to people. Can you explain your reasons with some realistic idea of what is going to happen that's so awful?

Fear ward would for example only be available to dwarves priests at level 20 (and is considered an essential raid tool)

If layering is in the game WHATSOEVER, I will NOT purchase classic wow.
---
This sounds so pathetic
---
If you didn't have beta already, you don't have it. They stopped sending out invites weeks ago.
---
There’s no time in WoW where you ever face tank melee dps as a mage so your whole point is moot. He made a mistake here but that doesn’t mean he isn’t a phenomenal player. You’re analyzing a guy’s skill level from 2 seconds of play and ignoring years of obvious prowess to make some retarded point like playing classic mage against enhance is unknown to him despite there being 3 clips of him beating Cdew in a duel tournament because he kited him almost infinitely.

Ok what other racial skills are there?
---
Zone layering is done 100x over on retail. It's sharding
---
I feel like they might need to take it a step further and make it so you cannot change shards for so many minutes after leaving combat. It's not super hard to get out of combat in pvp situations and I feel it would still be easily exploitable if all you had to do was leave combat to change shards.
---
You'l know in ~21 hours, but it's more than likely just the stress test.
---
Just ask someone to invite you to the English language layer /s
---
This is exactly what will happen. Feck knows what Blizzard are thinking. I don't understand how people get paid to make such stupid decisions
---
Hearthstone has been going downhill for a while now.
---
Ill have to keep an eye out then if there are only going to be a limited amount of servers :)
---
My server, Archimonde, was maxed and constantly plagued with problems in the first year of Vanilla. I took a transfer to another high pop server when available and intentionally picked a west coast server even thought I am in eastern time.
---
Why? Because I knew BC release would be a fucking nightmare and I figured a 3 hour head start would help out tremendously. Turns out I was right and I got to skip the shitstorm of hour 1.
---
While some people may get enjoyment out of constant glitching and mob taps, others prefer to actually play the game.
---
Literally no one is complaining about layering 1-12.
---
Monitor resolution was obviously a lot lower back then
---
Cool it with the italics bud.
---
I'm not as familiar with those two, so I'd say just stick with WC3. Might even wanna push it back so that you're finishing up that game right as Classic is about to launch.
---
Wtf am I looking at
---
He said that his entire experience will be invalidated if he plays with Germans.

If you don't see the problem with that then you must be a bigot too.

Can't wait to unknowingly join the Turkish server, and have no fucking idea what anyone is talking about.
---
necessary evil to prevent the server merging clusterfuck vanilla created. creating too many servers leads to dead realms that need to be merged. layering automates the merging and prevents the clusterfuck. what's so hard to understand?

Thank fuck I'm not the only one who didn't enjoy Legion. Most people reflect on it fondly but I more or less ragequit (more like sadquit) after an embarrassing M0 dungeon early on.
---
Let me back up, though; your comment deserves a thorough reply. ;)
---
I mained a hunter through Wrath and was *not happy* when my mana turned into focus, and they got rid of spells like Volley. It felt like a slap in the face. I soldiered on, though, and found the positives in using focus instead (like not ever running out of a resource completely). Cata itself started poorly for me (awful surgery when it dropped and I kept seeping blood for days and could barely do anything but sleep to recover, and then I'd decided to main a ret paladin who was in quest greens from me hitting the cap just a day or so before Cata dropped), but I recovered physically and then in-game by switching to resto shaman. Cata was an expansion of Many Alts for me, so I look back on it with some fondness, though in hindsight I do believe LFR was a mistake (or at least, having more than the first 'wing' of a raid available in LFR format was a mistake). There were some things about the world overhaul I enjoyed, but they mostly boiled down to: "Hey, something different to look at after I've been through it 200 times." That's on me, though, as an altoholic.
---
MoP was my first foray into raiding (I was supposed to fill in until they found someone better, but that literally never happened) and I really enjoyed the way some classes played (specifically disc priests), but I'm 100% with you on the jokey nonsense. I wouldn't have minded some panda-centric quests, some goofy things, but it felt like so much of it was a joke that it took more away from the story (which IMO was weak in the first place) than it gave. Pandas themselves weren't so bad, but making the whole expansion Panda-themed felt wrong after Cata gave us gobbos and worgen and the story barely touched them after their starting zones.
---
WoD lost me a bit with the lack of things to do, but I think its big downfall was actually in its MoP-like catch-up mechanics, which was probably my least favorite part of MoP. I liked the idea of the Timeless Isle...but I didn't like the gearing for main and alts that you could find there; it's even worse in hindsight IMO. WoD's garrison was horrible, too; it wanted to be content but...it really wasn't, and I feel like getting that *instead of real content* is one of the biggest reasons it failed like it did. I still managed to tank Mythics so I guess that was something... (I'm usually a coward about these things.)
---
MoP's challenge modes always looked fun but I didn't have any friends interested in doing them so I never tried. Unfortunate, because I think I would have liked them; they appeal to me far more than M+ does, that's for sure. I agree that Legion and BfA's issues stem largely from building on things from MoP or later that I didn't care too much for (all of which you mentioned). Artifacts were a terrible idea for the reasons you listed. There were no choices because in the end everyone's would look the same, and I also take issue with the fact that new things were added via our goddamn GEAR instead of baked into our class specs.
---
I agree the Heart of Azeroth isn't as bad, but that + the azerite gear is what made me angry. So great, it's not just the neck I have to deal with, but the neck, chest, shoulders, AND HELM? Fuuuuuck that noise; it's not fun at that point, it's just a chore. If it was just the neck I'd probably like it, especially if they'd have baked more into the specs instead of taking things away.
---
I miss tier sets, too, and hate the titanforging. I like gear to work toward but I think the azerite residuum stuff was too little too late in BfA, and now gives the illusion that there's *too much to do* which makes me feel overwhelmed by choices and I just end up logging out or playing the AH/farming for gold. That might be the ADHD talking, but I can't imagine I'm the only one who feels completely swamped by things I feel pushed to do at the end-game in BfA.
---
The sad thing is that I'm in the minority of actually liking islands (gimme pets and mounts!), but my gear isn't exactly up to the task of tackling them as efficiently as people who have up-to-date gear...
---
But that's a whole other rant; I guess the core issue is still at play, though. BfA launch I played the CRAP out of the game, hit the cap fast, and started queueing for dungeons and doing mythics. It was hard to get into groups as a DPS but I did get into a couple in the first couple of days after mythic 0s dropped (I can't remember if this was right after launch or not, honestly). The problem was that within 24 hours of mythics being out, if you weren't kitted out in 340+ gear, you couldn't get into any M0 groups as DPS. My gear fell behind, I went back to the Alliance, and fell behind the pack again leveling over there. :P The focus on gear/ilevel/etc is understandable, but it makes the game a lot less fun to me, too, on the whole. Maybe I'm in the minority, though, or...it could just be a combination of all of the above things that have soured me!
---
Sorry for the ramble!

No language specific servers were at launch. #NoChanges. Warts and all.

They can just make it free for all non sub players 3 days. What could hurt them?

Yes you can and yes you do. I think I did a lot of shifting when I leveled resto druid as resto. It was painful and slow, but if you don't mind the slog it could be great. :D

The server I was on was packed with Cow Druids. The Battleboars part was insane, especially the named mob needed for a quest. Once I moved out of the zone it was much easier with maybe another dozen players

 Most people, especially in the EU speak/read/write English as a 2nd, 3rd or even 4th language.  There may be occasions where it's a bit more difficult to communicate, but I'm positive everyone will do their best!
---
Yeah.... it will just be English
---
Yeah I completely agree, people are just hearing what he's saying but not thinking. Think about this- he claims he has a character in each layer and he can move layers at will. So once he moves one char to another layer, that character should be in a new layer and now he doesnt have a character represented in each layer. Eventually his characters will all get switched around layers and there will be literally no way to maintain a character in each layer.

&gt;I'm really quite surprised at the number of people who have deluded themselves into thinking queuing for servers and waiting for mobs is fun.

No you dumb condescending piece of shit, people are concerned about layering because it fucks the community aspect of the game, which is one of the primary things classic WoW had right.  You're simultaneously wrong and being an asshole, that's a dumb combo.

The first solution they propsed was to literally shard the starting zones. Even that is a better solution than layering the entire world. So if they couldn't feasibly do that, they still have a much better option, even if it can't utilize this new technology.
---
But will they stick with warrior?
---
&gt; Private servers don't attract nearly the crowd the classic launch will.

1.13 is already in development. The beta is up to 1.13.2 I believe
---
They already blatantly lied when they said it would only be for starter zones, and you trust them again? Dawg, why do you hate yourself?
---
10 people considered to Play Classic. Now 7 Not and 3 Don t know. This will kill the Community aspect. They should fire every Idiot at blizzard that Not stopped this, because they don t know anything about wow. Even If i can understand english to a certain degree, i want have a immersive experience in my language and Not called Nazi all day Like in other multilanguage Game. It will be toxic and a shitshow, what idiots
---
There is still a way to have this sharding and no room for abuse that could legitimately ruin the economy in weeks of time.
---
They need to be putting checks on these exploits or some guilds will be incredibly rich and snowball into complete market domination.
---
Imagine you have layers and you can *not* hop them. You can change the layer of your choice every 48h.
---
Problem solved.
---
This is fucking bullshit. How on Earth Blizzard could think this is acceptable is beyond belief.
---
The strafing  is just to emulate movement in a static situation. This leeway mechanic functions the same if both players are running forward / both players are strafing in the same direction etc
---
I played tons of Warcraft 2 as a kid but I don’t really remember the story because it was so long ago. It’s a great game. I mostly played multiplayer though. Warcraft 1 was old even for me when I got ahold of it and I’m 34. I’m sure it will be a good time. For me I think I have enough time to finish up 3 and it’s expansion as well as read a bunch of lore. The amount of thought that has gone into this world is really breathtaking regardless.
---
I for one won’t be playing while layering exists. I’m just not interested, my play style requires me to network on my server and develop a reputation. If that means I miss a few weeks or months, so be it. I’ve been fine without Classic and Destiny is turning around big time since getting away from their former publisher, so there’s no real need for me to get in early. It’ll be going for years, lots of time to play. 
---
Layering seems like too big of a solution for the problem of congested starting zones.
---
I agree with this, but it can still be abused at lower levels for collecting materials and raiding cities.
---
Here is the most important question. Are you Happy? If the answer is yes, then there is nothing wrong with what gets you excited
---
I booked a week off work so I could play, emphasis on PLAY the game. I will take layering over having a shitty time on my limited PTO.
---
If they don’t start putting checks on the room for exploitation, then it would honestly be better for the health of he game to drop it.
---
And I am normally willing to compromise for phase 1 sharding. But this way it will break the game.
---
You've never watched the priest PvP video have you? 
---
The multiple kill/overkill messages on a dead player? That wound up not dead? 
---
Or the WSG Flag grab video?
---
Or the myriad of folks who played classic that had a lot of weird batching issues? 
---
There's a lot that is wildly different between screen 1 and screen 2.
---
I'll file this late damage application on one side under batching like the rest.
---
Off to the US servers I go.
---
I don't disagree, but there are those that don't speak other languages and have no need for it it there daily lives, they shouldn't't have to learn another language just to be able to enjoy the game :)
---
&gt; It's not how the game was meant to be played
---
Neither is sharding.
---
EU got open borders.

good comment dude
---
Sodapoppin is one of the biggest streamers on twitch, dude is already loaded and isn't gonna suddenly go broke because Classic beta is over.
---
Most streamers will have a ridiculous amount of viewers during release day and probably throughout the week, then it'll stabilize around 15-20k for the big ones like Asmongold and Soda.
---
Don't get it even remotely twisted. Blizzard is releasing Wow Classic because it will revive their subscription count. Everyone here who thinks this isn't entirely about money is fucking wrong. This isn't a passion project. This isn't a good faith step by Blizzard. They want your money, and they want it regularly. If you are the type of person who is up in arms about changes and are pissed they are changing the game, your ONLY course of action is to not pay them. Plain and simple. There is no alternative.  
---
You can try to convince them to change their mind, but if you think they made this game so 300k could be happy and the millions of other player who want to have fun in classic but not be stuck in the 2000s technology wise, you are DEAD wrong. This is a publicly traded company. If classic only catered to those 300k, the game would very quickly be canceled because the cost of servers and developers alone far outweighs the income. 
---
This is not a me against you. This is us against a corporation. I don't honestly care if laying is in the game or not. I don't care if there is a cash shop or not. I'm going to play classic either way. I just want to relive my nostalgia.
---
Apart from being missleading here, care to explain why you used content from other people without giving at least credit to them?
---
Then, is this a 5 man leveling Guide or a promotion/comparison for the potentially fastest way to level? Weird structure. I know this isn't scientific research but still. 
---
Speaking about research, you compared the absolut best three Dungeons for leveling paired with huge power spikes for many classes, especially melees with the ravager (which is totally broken for any melee comp) to the absolut worst of the worst solo level Class. No, there isn't just "a Hunter with a optimized route or a solo aoe farming mage" that is way faster than a warrior. It's literally everyone else. I fail to comprehend how you can do "research" on a basis without signifance.
---
About your Group compositions ; I don't understand how you can put a Priest over a Paladin who provides no buffs besides stamina compared to a equally or even better healer with way more potent buffs who also can decrease downtime. A priest would only, if even be able to outshine the paladin as another dps in holy spec with holy nova which you fail to mention in your spellcleave comp. Yet you put in a Shadow priest who has nothing to offer in terms of actual cleave or aoe or utility or literally anything besides solo target dps.
---
 Your Video is nicely presented yet very poor researched.
---
So Iam sorry but this just isn't good. Based on your approach you should have focused on the part that 5 man dungeon leveling is a alternative for very poor solo levelers in general and warriors/shaman.

Playing back to back with 1.12 client a lot of little things bugged me. Modern client damage numbers, laggy looting, 1000 sun bloom etc. Also completely unplayable population wise after the reset. Every single mob in northsire would die within 5 secs of spawning. The 50 people ahead of the pack happily levelled to 10+ within a couple of hours and everyone else was stuck lvl 2-3 for hours trying to get tags. Yawn... If that's the amount of people in live you are going to have to hope you're one of the first 50 loaded in or just come back and play 6 hours later. Anyone trying to level quickly but 5 mins late will be completely screwed.

To be honest, i like layering but hate the idea of making less money because some metagaming jerk is changing layers manually to make more money.
---
I think there's gotta be a way to stop that process. If the server assigns a layer, it probably needs a very good reason to want to reassign a different layer.

I wish I could upvote your OP twice. I'm tired of seeing these "limit layering to x zones or y levels." That's not how layering works people! 
---
I also don't want to spend 5+ hours trying to hit level 10. Blizzard has said that layering won't and can't exist after phase 1. They've done a pretty decent job listening to the community so far, so we're just going to have to trust them for now. 
---
If layering exists after phase 1, then we should raise hell. Until then, chill!
---
Layering or sharding is a hard no for me.
---
At least give us a couple servers without this bullshit so we can choose to sit in queues if we want.
---
The argument is not that layering can't be abused, it's that he has 6 characters, one on each layer, and he can layer swap to a particular individual layer at will. Maybe I'm missing something here but as soon as one character swaps to a new layer, you would lose your representation in each layer, and it seems it would be impossible (or at least just really time consuming) to ensure when you log off you always have a character in each layer.
---
I was on the edge about pro and anti-streamer crowds flaming each other.
---
Not anymore.
---
What will actually cause economic damage is layer hopping.
---
I don’t actually mind layers. I mind unrestricted layer hopping.

They absolultley need to do something about the abuse. People WILL be 60 by the end of the first week. The amount of damage that can be done by someone using layer hopping and farming black lotus or arcanite crystals/ any endgame resource is going to be an EXTREME issue if this isnt addressed.

**What is the difference between the best &amp; worst dps classes?**
---
Like most people, I'm having issues trying to decide what I want to play, because they all sound so fun. The problem is that I really only have time to dedicate myself to a single class. After some googling I've found some tier lists, but I'm wondering how much worse are the classes on the bottom? These tier lists vary quite a bit, so I'm not sure who to trust. So if anyone can offer some insight, what is the difference between the worst and best classes for both raiding &amp; pvp and what are those classes?

Doesn't make the leveling experience any more bearable though! Lol.

You're delusional for wanting all the exploits that come with layering so you can be handheld for the early hours of the game

When talking about PvP make sure to mention you were rank 12/13 so it seems you know what you’re talking about, but don’t overreach claiming to be rank 14 so as not to draw further scrutiny.
---
If your just doings 5mans and questing druid is great .
---
Can heal or tank dungeons and a great leveling class
---
Yeah. One thing people forget about speedruns is that they were all performed _well_ after launch. The reason it took many people so long to level originally was mainly because of crowding and server crashes. And rollbacks. man... rollbacks.
---
Got a clip of him showing that?

Me too! I’m talking the original strategy game Warcraft 1 though. It came out in 1994, 10 years before WoW.
---
Just went over as a gnome since it wasn't in stock when I tried about an hour ago. It's in stock now, and indeed, it's one per vendor.

Nice

It took Vanilla several months to even pass 1 million players. Classic is most likely going to launch with several million players over the 1st few weeks. Also Vanilla servers were capped at around 2500-3000 players before the queue was initiated, due to technological limitations at the time. Current server capacity is significantly higher than that. 
---
There will unequivocally be more people playing Classic launch than there was Vanilla launch, with higher individual server capacity for each realm. The overcrowding isn't really comparable. Not to mention that WoW launched with dozens of servers available, and they quickly added more. Classic can't just add tons of servers because the long term population won't be able to support them.
---
I was there for the TBC launch &amp; Hellfire Peninsula was a dang slide show for like the first week. I agree with you.
---
Not even russians want to play with russians it seems. Since they won't be able to write in cyrillic it'll probably be okay.
---
That would be funny as hell
---
Waht a great troll
---
The people defending layering are the same people who demanded all the other shortcuts and nonsense over the years that lead us to the state of modern WoW.
---
Can someone plz explain what is layering?  
---
And sharding?
---
Im having difficulty confirming if this is bad or good for us .
---
No there won't. There will only be a handful of servers for all of the EU. Probably something like 2 PVP, 2 PVE, and 1 RP.
---
layering 1-12 is considered a no brainer here IMO for phase 1
---
people here are against layering once you're in the late teens hitting those first few contested areas. 
---
not cool.
---
They haven't changed the data, that's the only thing we can be sure that is 100% authentic grabbed from the backup. This is just one of those cases of private servers being wrong yet again
---
&gt; What if the game has millions of players and grows? 
---
The game will start off VERY high because the hype is super big and its essentially f2p for retail players. A realistic estimate is that ATLEAST 50% of first-week players wont stay around, but its likely that itll be more like 65%. And THATS the reason layering exists! 
---
&gt; I see no good reason why they shouldn't implement dynamic respaws like we've seen on private servers  
---
Cause dynamic respawn on mobs can be abused aswell, unless you add a shitton of exceptions. Same is true with layering. If they limit layer-swapping as heavily as they implied they would we wouldnt have all these ridiculous exploit videos from beta. "but its only beta, its literally for testing layering" i sure hope so, but weeks are passing and the release gets closer and closer and its still exploitable :c  
---
&gt; done right, this will ensure the leveling experience will go smoothly 
---
layering isnt really about the leveling experience, its about the experience after more than 50% of the server has quit. Its kind of a soon-to-be-merged-realms situation but you can temporarily switch between these realms(layers). Layering will still be an absolute shitshow on release with \~800 humans in goldshire and no mechanic to counter that.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c30hu3/-/) has been removed as the question is answered in our ['What We Know So Far and Easily Answered Questions'](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/whatweknow) wiki page. Please take a look. 
---
Yeah, until they find out there's only 2 PVP, 2 PVE, and 1 RP realms for the entire EU population. Then all their organization goes to shit.
---
If I get to level 30 and I've somehow managed to roll on the unofficial French/German/Polish/Italian/etc realm, I'm cancelling my subscription and never giving Blizzard any money ever again. They are seriously dropping the ball with this decision.
---
I've looked but can't find it -- does anyone know if Blizzard has an official statement in response to these issues?
---
I played to level 10 on one character, a few levels on other characters.  I had two disconnects, one of which seemed to be a zone or server crash, the other not sure.  I did not see (or recognize) any other bugs.  It played very smoothly.
---
The game experience is very heavily influenced by the type of layering they do.  They are testing different flavors on different servers.  I played on the two high population servers.  One was layered very sparingly, with heavy competition for spawns in the starting areas.  It seems to have frustrated some people, judging by comments.  I thought it was fun.  That being said, I played mostly on the other high pop server, which was layered very heavily, resulting in very few players (after the initial hour or two of launch) in the newbie zones, and literally 1 or 0 players in mid zones through which I traveled.  I didn't think this was fun at all, it felt like a ghost town.  There was no competition for anything.  You could harvest 10 anything, find any boss, loot any quest spawn.  So why did I play there?  I wanted to reach a certain level to test mechanics, in the limited time I had.  But I would never want to reside in a world like that for 1-2 weeks.   Perhaps among the other servers they had a middle ground, I do not know.
---
I mean you aren't wrong but the only one here not understanding is you because it's apparently impossible for you to address or correct a misplaced word that wasn't just a typo that could be read around.

---
Not funny, just the truth.
---
Germany makes up ~25% of the EU playerbase. If Blizzard thinks they can't sustain even one of their own servers, then the whole of the EU can't support more than a few.
---
You're talking about a technical support feature vs a design feature. WoW was very much meant to be a more casual, questing based leveling experience. It's the reason WoW became as popular as it did. No one was meant to be grinding mobs for the 1st 15 levels.
---
Layering is a technical feature to alleviate a real problem. It's not a design choice, it's a practical and necessary solution to maintain the gameplay standard.
---
Oh no!  Someone spoke in a language!  How will I ever survive?!
---
You are delusional... please go troll some where else
---
were trying to change blizzards mind here through feedback, our whines arent pointless.
---
Cool man, I would really appriciate it. You can grab the fixed addon [here](https://github.com/christophrus/CensusPlusClassic/releases).
---
If you need some help on how to set it up, I wrote some instructions [here](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/submit). This is also the page, where you would upload the gathered data.
---
After you have installed the addon and logged into your toon, the process may take while depending on how much players are currently online. Scaninng \~1000 Players concurrently online took me like 15min as an estimate for you.
---
To be honest, this had very little to do with private servers. It appears that Blizzard stealth buffed reputation significantly in early TBC and theres very little documentation on the change.
---
Oh yes, I understand. I just replied very poorly. lol 
---
I'm gonna see if I can try Warcraft 1 and 2 before jumping back into 3.
---
you're asking for layering
---
First thing I thought of
---
Looking to heal at 60, was a very big resto shaman player in MOP but hear they are trash, open to new classes but don't want to be a big sideline for a guild. Whats my best options for healing and being useful still in BG's, 5-mans etc? Purely heals that is (With a hopefully not terrible levelling spec)

---
So how about this- my friend just invited me and now we're all in the same layer and I avoided some world pvp. Awesome. Now we're getting ganked again but we're in the same layer- I just constantly find randos to invite me so I keep hopping layers?
---
I just tested, you're correct and this is a bug.  
---
Macros were changed in Cata, before that this macro should have worked.
---
I used this as a test
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /use Will of the Forsaken
---
    /use Lesser Heal
---
Lesser Heal never went off.
---
This is a new level of Stockholm Syndrom
---
That's racist. All of it.
---
This is one of those few things that needs to change to retain the vanilla experience, if not it will fuck with the entire meta and cause a lot of unnecessary grief, that it didn’t cause back in vanilla.
---
Doing the Gods work.
---
Jesus fucking christ, streamer fans.
---
[removed]
---
No it doesnt. That was a pserver error
---
Warlock pets should never be autopilot.
---
You need macros for attack/ send to place/ make stationary.
---
Follow/go passive for dispelling, and general positional movement.
---
I was so good with pet micro when a priest would run in to fear I’d send t away and make it go defensive just so I could dispel myself without us both getting feared.
---
But theyre a company interested in keeping you playing, thats how they make money with classic. We voice our concerns and wishes now, maybe this will get changed.
---
Miért beszélsz németül? Ez a nem hivatalos magyar szerver!
---
Can we IP ban anyone in the screenshot?
---
You can bet my guild will be doing this if it is at all possible. Even if we need to buy 15 extra subs.
---
We would not *want* to be doing this. We would feel forced to.
---
You realize many many guilds will make a scout schedule for world bosses? They will stay at the spawn point 24 hours 7 days of the week. Guilds like ours will have means to notify people, even during the night to start an emergency world boss.
---
Since both factions might have scouts, you might need more than just 2-3 people simultaneously as they will try to find your lvl 1-3 rogues and kill them.
---
Look... it will be super easy. We will just multibox and have one character on every layer online at all times. One person can do it alone. Or 10 people.
---
We will name them Sakujoguildlayer1,2,3,...
---
Then they will have an addon that invites people that whisper “layerhop”.
---
Our main characters will have macros on numpad 1-9 and an addon that automatically accepts invites from guild members.
---
The macros will whisper layerhop to above players.
---
**All I will have to do is press numpad 1-9 to instantaneously switch to layer 1-9**. ***There is nothing convoluted about this.***
---
Imagine thinking a scuffed Russian Frankenstein of vanilla wow ever had nearly the logins that classic will on day one.
---
Uhhh 100% rough start. You don't \*HAVE\* to be there for launch. If long queues or dc's bother you that much, wait a week or two before you start playing. Everything will be fine and dandy then.
---
All good lol! It should be a blast!
---
Hey, just wanted to share the bug report I recently made in regards to the Paladin Seal system, and some of the errors in it on WoW Classic which I noticed.
---
remember to look back at how dumb you actually are when people are clearing mc first week.
---
Asmongold and Sodapoppin are probably the only ones who can cause this type of effect. They're gonna choose the same server anyway, so just pick a different one and problem solved.
---
Do all these wanker blankets just not join reddit? I have yet to see anyone defending the streamers, yet there is a throng following them.
---
&gt;all the initial effort i put into the game could be pointless, if the server i play on gets designated as the "German" server
---
You're a fucking bigot, get your bigot ass out of this sub.
---
"I didnt know how to play back then so it was hard. Now I know everything and the game is easy. Something is wrong with blizzards programming, needs to be harder."
---
Make sure if someone disagrees with you tell them you’ve played since vanilla beta.
---
I think they mean the numbers that support development of the game to begin with.
---
yes assuming you only have 1 friend. With 5+ friends it's easy to get on any layer you want.
---
You are wrong. They did bot use the word “zone”. But before the word “layering” was dropped they said there will be sharding but just for the starter regions. And people were not sure how far the term “starter” spanned.
---
Heart of the Wild.
---
Specifically it's the talent just preceding the 31-point talent in the feral tree.  It gives a stat bonus to your various forms and the relevant one for raiding is the extra int (mana).  More generally it refers to a specific type of specialization (0/30/21) that generally is focused on PvP but is flexible enough to tank/heal 5mans or get decurse duty in raids.  
---
This probably doesn't sound all that exciting but the draw here is a PvE capable spec built for PvP.  You'll have most of the bear talents just naturally along the way, obviously you get NS for big insta-heals, and you'll have the huge mana and health pools needed to do what you want.  Meanwhile you've got important stuff for PvP like NS, Swarm, bear charge, and FFF.

---
I still have no appreciation for Cata. It's where all went downhill.
---
Sorry to break it to ya - they don't need to get massive numbers from classic.
---
Why does anyone think they need to make money from classic?
---
They are fine with BFA and future expansions.
---
Excuse my horrid wire management.
---
Lupos is supposed to work that way. His attacks are not physical, they are Shadow damage, and thus, ignore armor. That's why everyone wanted him. He did more DPS than any other pet by a large margin because his melee attacks ignored enemy armor.
---
Remember to look back at how you totally pwned me in this thread when the dark thoughts come for you before bed.
---
He shouldn't, that was nerfed in 1.7 or 1.8
---
I think there should be no layering after about ~15. I think that it takes a lot of fun out of the game. I understand getting out of the starting zones and having enough mobs so that people can complete their starting quest, but after that, there should be no layering.
---
Been saving up money for a car. I'm considering dropping 1-2k on a new station.
---
That's why my guild rode right on past hellfire and fought shit in Terokkar as a group
---
Same with warriors. On K****s, Battle Shout was bugged and generating way too much threat, so you could literally just spam battle shout and keep perfect aoe threat on everything, better than a Paladin could.
---
I don’t understand what’s happening
---
actually yes, Nostalrius had 10k+ people online at peak times on 1 realm. Blizzard will never allow one of their realms to have 10k people on it.
---
Thats true, maybe they, dont want to have that many lists with only one or two server
---
To be fair being able to communicate with people on your sever seems like a no-brainer
---
Some aggro ranges seem incorrect. As a lvl 8, I had to walk up to like 3-5 yards from a lvl 7 mob until he started attacking.
---
But that would always require each of you being on a separate layer, and as soon as one person gets invited you lose someone on a particular layer and you could never all group together either.
---
 To just learn a new language, don’t be lazy!
---
Druid tanking was pretty awful until their talent revamp. (which was a common theme for specs in vanilla)
---
Even with 1.12 talents, bear tanks work, but are still inferior to Warriors in a handful of ways. They're good for tanking adds/trash.
---
Are u seriously saying that they dont practice it as a business and will try to generate as much money as they possibly can? Do you think they do this for their bucket list or out of a certain belief?  
---
wake up mate lmao
---
What's the alternative though? End up in a situation where you have 5000 players fighting for the same few resources, all resulting in a scenario where nobody gets anything.
---
A few extra black lotuses will not kill classic, but having the game be actually playable from day one will do wonders for its casual playerbase.
---
&gt; But that's subjective, mate. 
---
I never said it wasn't. But the fact of the matter remains large portions of the population judged that the theme was so bad that it didn't warrant giving the gameplay a chance.
---
That's just a fact, which is why I described it as polarizing.
---
I would never, ever, in a million years, have fun playing a Hello Kitty WOW clone. And many people like me agree.
---
MOP was a notable drop for both Blizzard in terms of the reception that their xpac got, and overall sub populations.
---
You are telling me all the great things about MOP. 
---
Which leads me to believe that the marked drop in reception and overall sub population had *a lot* to do with the theme, and not as much to do with the game itself since clearly by your break down, the game and it's content were mostly fine even if the story/theme/settings were ass.
---
And clearly it was a deal breaker for many people, myself included. Have you ever dated someone you really liked but they had a certain habit or something that was just an utter "nope" for you?
---
MOP was the same for many people. It's like WOW is a pretty lady with all your favorite features except she has the one worst quality you can't enjoy: she's a smoker.
---
I was referring specifically to this isolated case and having seen plenty of footage of other shamans using Windfury on the Classic Beta. 
---
The windfury proc is applying damage correctly but the combat text is displaying the hits in a staggered manner for the player dealing the damage. This is un-blizzlike compared to vanilla if you've watched old shaman pvp videos or played one back then.
---
The other issues you mentioned are irrelevant and have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with my comment.
---
https://realmpop.com/eu.html
---
When you remove Russia, Germany server players are ~27.8% of the total EU population and ~29.4% of the level 120 population. Granted, this includes inactive accounts, but it's a good ballpark.
---
I'm currently adding up this site:
---
http://www.warcraftrealms.com/eu_realmstats.php?sort=LanguageID
---
Which only counts players seen in the last 30 days.
---
Lol no dude just stop before you hurt yourself with your own confusion.
---
We don't need no logic here! It's not as if Omar delibrately said he was snapping fingers and looking for more stress.
---
Save to say Germany will fuck off to their own server, France too. Good luck rest of Europe.
---
I recorded the clip with an app called ScreenFlow, and one of the options after recording lets you add a light blur effect to the footage.
---
You mean like Classic WoW?
---
If you watch monkeynews' VOD you'd see how that is easily circumvented. 
---
Having a single lvl 1 alt and not logging onto it until you want to explicitly go on that layer. You alt f4 and go on that char then back on your main and you're back on that shard.
---
Or laters could just be removed in favor of just having a server on its own.
---
It's kinda weird, but each reddit thread usually goes one way or the other. 
---
One thread everyone will be defending them and downvoting anyone who criticizes. 
---
Another thread everyone will hate streamers and everyone who says anything nice about them is downvoted to oblivion. 
---
/r/classicwow is schizophrenic
---
I was looking at the Twitch MMO section today. It's a graveyard of has-beens and a closet-full of defiled skeletons. The newest, and by all accounts most successful, MMO on there was Lost Ark, which isn't even out in the West yet (and has become 100% P2W as is the Asian tradition).   
---
I was thinking to myself "How nice would it be to have a brand new game, exciting new mechanics, gameplay, graphics, class design, etc. to play. Instead, we're hardstuck with content released a decade and a half ago. It's really sad.
---
Nee, danke. Ich freue mich auf internationale Server.
---
Can someone tell me how to obtain this
---
" If you see a "nice" comment = follow it up with even more "nice" comments, (be sure not to comment this on your own "nice", can't stress this enough". "
---
For extra "nice" comments a well deserved Woot should be thrown in also.
---
Huehuehue
---
why is it all or nothing? just have layering in the early zones like 1-20 or 1-30. how are you this daft to think we have to have multiple azeroths just to account for the zerg.
---
Streamer groupies
---
Lol implying any other trash you can conjure up would have won
---
It looks like the blues were all added in 1.11, so they might not be available until they add T0.5 into the game.
---
You could, the options are extremely limited and you will taking a significant downgrade compared to wielding a 1h weapon with a shield or off-hand item.
---
I wouldn't suggest showing up to groups as a healer wielding a 2h except for maybe Vergian's Fist at early levels. You just miss out on way too many stats.
---
10k people is a drop in the bucket of how many people will be logging in for classic launch. Blizzard servers suck, I’m the first to acknowledge that but at the same time they’re accommodating for far more people, one server or not.
---
INV
---
Maybe you’re focusing too much on others and you should focus on yourself
---
Rather than sending out the effects of spells and abilities immediately, the server batches together everything that was cast within a small window of time and they all activate simultaneously. It's to account for latency, as to not give players with lower ping too much of an advantage. 
---
What this means is that it's possible for two warlocks to Fear each other, or two warriors to Charge to where the other was standing.
---
Okay that was the piece I was missing...so you essentially configure each character per layer once with some friends and then from there on out you can do this trick to always force your main to a particular layer?
---
Is it possible to but the collectors edition now to get this?
---
Yes it is hard.
---
But you don't actually need 40 amazing players.  The content isn't tuned like Mythic on retail where if 1 person screws up it is an instant wipe.
---
You mostly just need 40 people to show up. Of course some need to be good but if you have 10 bad players it's not the end of the world.
---
At least until you get to twins/cthun in AQ40 or the later bosses in Naxx. Usually the guild gets stuck and all the good players leave to better guilds.
---
Germans are white mate, can’t be bigoted towards white people.
---
And that's how it was in vanilla I was an orc and I'd duel my friends rogue all the time he would sap me cheap shot me and turn away so he doesn't break the sap and restealth and wait out DR for extra combo points. He'd then 5-8 kite me by back pedaling and inching forward outside of stuns until he was able to restealth.  
---
When he'd duel a tauren warrior from our guild he couldn't do it he'd just get auto'd and stay in combat until crippling wore off. That's vanilla WoW.
---
The same way some specs go oom instantly or do 1/10 of the damage of other classes and can't use some of  your abilities due to debuff limits. The same way you can land a fear and still be in a polymorph or land a stun and still be feared. It's just how it was.   
---
And maybe it would be nice if we fixed the wonky sides of vanill,a but I guarantee you  those changes are going to piss some people off. Some people would probably be fine with changing melee leeway or spell batching and some would flip a shit. Some people would love buffs to classes like enhance or ret that are pretty dog ass and some would of been extremely pissed about it and say how they ruined the game. Some people want content after naxx and some want just the original things.  
---
I don't think there's a right or wrong here, but I don't see anymore validity to changing melee leeway than say buffing raids to be more difficult or buffing specs that are worthless or removing spell batching or having unlimited debuffs.

"I don't know what your problem is I grinded death lotus for hours and never saw anyone else" I just cannot understand how ppl don't see the server economical ramifications of layering as a more serious issue, less competition with more resources, I could be convinced that at very early levels this could have benefit, but to just leave the whole world layered feels like a problem
---
Maybe more people will create alts and have them chill out at inns for the beginning of the game.
---
get that rested xp bonus, yo.
---
I do not know how it works, but if it is based on a /who, you might have a small sample issue on the heavily layered server.  Go for the less layered server, which I think is 15.
---
If layers are only active in certain zones, *that's just sharding*. smh
---
Are those confirmed for classic? with news like this. i would hope.
---
Lol yea? Bloodlust?
---
Listen to Rammstein.  I've picked up a few German words simply because I like that band.
---
No chance in hell to know before the game actually comes out and people get to max. It will start as wicked expensive, like 10 gold classic for 50k gold retail, but it'll settle lower after gold farming really kicks in. 
---
There will absolutely be a market for it too. Farm gold on classic, trade for BFA gold, then buy a token for a subscription or to buy something in the bnet store
---
That's exactly the behavior shown in the link in the OP. Phasing out of  a gank in progress by getting a quick invite.
---
France is only 4.59% of the active WoW playerbase in Europe, they're never going to be able to take over one of the ~5 servers Europe gets.

Scheduled nappies got me really confused, but oh my god yes, I'm definitely calling naps, nappies from now on.

Sure that's true, but they have been playing on beta every day all day for a while. Venruki won the first beta pvp tournament two weeks ago. He just made a bad call wanding the totem to close.
---
I can’t read the whole thing but I just want to say about the “you think you do, but you don’t”
---
WoW players were given almost every change they ever wanted for years, and then those changes are the things people cite for hating current WoW. I most recently remember top pvpers wanting stat templates in arena, it took a few months of legion for everyone to realize how awful it was. Even cdew admitted that he had wanted templates in years but after they got them they realized it sucked. I think there was valid reason behind you think you do but you don’t, but it was still wrong.
---
Also have to add he’s a fucking piece of trash and I know someone personally that was fired from Blizzard earlier this year when they did the hundreds of lay offs. No warning about it, they knew people that were fired that had just moved to take the job, and some people they worked with had their positions advertised for a few months after they were cut. Shortly after firing hundreds of people he boasted about having record breaking profits. He’s a piece of shit.
---
Disgusting.
---
I can't see someone trading away classic gold, which is not easy/fast to come by, for retail gold, that grows on trees. 
---
Conversion wise, 50 gold per hour is a pretty normal farming rate in classic. I don't know farming rates in retail but my guess is it's higher than 5000 per hour
---
Unpopular opinion: I like classic wow
---
Can't that happen still though? I thought layering is per server and only lasting for the first couple of weeks
---
Someone called you a Night Elf? How did they know?
---
A new raid in vanilla doesn't invalidate the gear from the raid before. Most guilds will run MC at least until AQ comes out. My guild only stopped running BWL when Naxx came out.
---
I don’t disagree that it’s bullshit, but how do you no lift a server for a month and not notice your on the wrong server?

What’s a layer lol
---
Ultra-pro sleeves for my MTG cards...the GF has certainly picked a winner in me 😜
---
Retarded AND bigoted, 2 in 1. You're a winner.
---
Wait so ALL classic servers will be hosted out of Chicago? Honestly that’s awesome news for me. I’m on the east coast and most of my friends are west coast. I was worried my ping was going to be too high.
---
There are dozens of people shitting all over any layering at all, despite it being basically necessary until people clear 1-10 if we want a clean launch.
---
I upvoted, even though you are alliance scum.
---
Maybe for the first week, until people realise it wasn't what they remembered...
---
TBC was much more stable than WoD
---
yeah pretty much

---
I’m actually excited to exploit layering. It’s a bad choice but I’ll take advantage of it for sure
---
I tried to level in Vanilla (like, within a month of the original launch not even on 1.12). Early enough that I remember the painfully dark nights. I recall starting a dwarf character and getting so lost near IF that I abandoned the character. I think I even played back when rested bonus was called normal. At least, I remember learning about that change in wording back then. Perhaps that changed in beta and I just read about it. 
---
Anyway, I refer to that as "playing at launch" and I played Rogue and Druid. I can't recall what levels I reached and I no longer have access to the email address I need to recover that account. But, I think the rogue was at least in the 20s and maybe in the 30s (I suspect level 28). The druid was high enough level that I had both bear and cat forms. I think I had aquatic form but I'm almost certain I didn't have travel form.
---
With the rogue I remember it being a real slog. I recall spending days out in wetlands not really enjoying it much. A big part of the reason I made the druid was the rogue slog. I got so tired of leveling at one point that I went stealth mode and started just exploring zones. I played NE for both characters and I remember going into the badlands and getting killed by stealthed cats in that zone. With the druid, I don't know that I made it out of Ashenvale.
---
That was just in like 1-2 months of play, I think. Or maybe even the first month. I don't remember why I needed to cancel my sub.
---
Later at the end of TBC is when I started playing again and reached level 50 or so as a bloodelf paladin. I don't recall if I hit level cap during TBC or if it was during the first week of Wrath, but I hit the level cap of Wrath pretty early on. But, leveling the paladin was so much different because I was playing regularly with IRL friends.
---
So, I dunno. Even my TBC leveling experience was easier / faster than my "launch" experience but I attribute that to better knowledge of the game (QuestHelper, thottbot, etc) and having friends to group up with.
---
All I see is blood for the blood god, and skulls for the skull throne....
---
The entire point of the guys comment was aro8nd "blizzard needs to keep people playing classic for money, why wouldn't they bend over backwards for every possible customer?"
---
They don't need to cater to every customer - hence the fucking EU servers and lack of stress test. 
---
Blizzard isn't monetizing the product that is classic wow and it's not a separate sub... all of which they could have easily done if they NEEDED to make money off of classic.
---
Obviously they want to make money "mate" they aren't going to bend to your fortnite rules to make it with classic - go play BFA catakid.
---
A big ass shard.
---
I was just explaining how it works.  WTF are you rambling about?
---
But they wouldnt need to give one server to a language, but 3. Atleast 1 PvP, 1 PvE and 1 RP Server. Apparently they dont want to give germany 3 servers because they dont want to do italian servers and they dont want to discriminate, i guess? xD
---
IDK, I lost my last layer, who dis?
---
Yeah rich people in BFA will absolutely pay to avoid the gold grind. There's gonna be lots of scams haha
---
The average level 60 Vanilla player can grind out 50 gold per hour.
---
The average level 120 BFA player can grind out at least 10,000 gold per hour.
---
You can buy 50,000 gold on BFA for $7.99, so perhaps 500g on Classic will be $7.99 at some point. But with there being no legitimate way to selling gold in Classic and the economy starting from scratch, I would expect it to be more like 100g for $7.99.
---
Considering layering is used to keep upwards of 9000 people on a server ment for 2500 people separated its sadly needed.  Blizzard create problems then invent the "solution"
---
It's not necessary though. Nost literally had 10x the vanilla population and was only an issue at low levels. After launch week I rarely had issues and the server felt amazingly alive.
---
I will wreck you so hard that you will be using that hideous flag as a tissue for your tiers, boyo.
---
*unpopular opinion*
---
I want layering until 40s in the first few weeks.
---
Get into a raid and move on to Westfall/Barrens. Constant xp &gt; Higher xp per kill
---
It's definitely not a bug, though it may have worked that way very early in the game's life. It was designed that way specifically to prevent one button rotation macros. Otherwise you would simply "/cast" all your skills in order of importance and let your procs/conditions automatically sort it out.
---
The perfect description of this subreddit ive seen so far. I've been vocal about the MANY downsides of layering since the day it was revealed. I've always been met with bs answers such as "I don't to be competing for boars" or "I dont want to wait in a queue".
---
A flask in bfa is 800 to 1300. Classic i think they can be 20 to 30
---
This! The point of MMORPG is collaboration and interaction with “familiar others”  making a large world feel smaller—not completely random strangers every other second. Otherwise I’d play another game.
---
They're killing me!
---
Skip the quests, go kill anything you can to get ahead. If you have buds who can help you kill the lvl 4 or 5 mobs, even better... Leave Northshire on load if you can
---
And to piggyback off of the above, I recommend making the trek! It's a good experience to travel to a different capital.
---
Specifically, read your quest texts for helpful tips on locations. If the one directing you northward mentions the Deeprun Tram, listen to it! If it doesn't, listen to me, and take the Deeprun Tram!
---
There's a Dwarven/Gnomish district in Stormwind. You'll see a swirling entrance there, that will lead you to the tram.
---
This is false. Portugal only has 1 PVE server, that's it. So clearly Blizzard doesn't subscribe to the "at least one realm of each type" thing.
---
Ever wanna DPS while questing without having to worry about kiting? Find yourself a warrior!
---
Exactly. It just encourages people to be increasingly more rude, selfish, and terrible. I watched a game I loved to play become a game that made me sad and angry more and more as these things increased.
---
Its actually faster with a competent group of spell cleave or melee cleave
---
Especially if hes a mage. Youd want a warlock and druid tank
---
I'm not familiar with this. How is this different than just looking at the in game map?
---
looks glorious, for the alliance!
---
These people are too busy with streamer cock down their throat obviously
---
Did you actually test the damage? It might just be a tooltip error. Lots of buggy shit with the 1.12 client.
---
No, all US WoW servers are either based out of LA or Chicago. But not all Pacific realms are on LA servers and not all Eastern realms are on Chicago servers.
---
That’s cheese
---
Simple messaging is best messaging.
---
jesus fucking christ, sad. I need to find out which servers these dudes are playing on and avoid it like the plague
---
Problem with US servers is, when it's daytime for us in Europe it's the middle of the night over there. Many people will be asleep.
---
But... You want layering because you're willing to deal with the tonnes of shit that brings, where I would prefer the queue. It's picking a poison here bro.
---
I don't see the point in this, it's pretty simple - you're going to be the minority on the server so it's either speak English or be ostracised from the majority of the server. Sucks but your population isn't big enough to warrant a dedicated pve, pvp , and rp server to yourselves. 
---
I am certain blizzard will not go back on their decision to not have language specific servers so just deal with it.
---
All I care is that the servers that open in the months following launch are authentic. I've already accepted that WoW won't be WoW until sometime after the summer's over.
---
If the excuse for layering is the tourists, there's no valid reason it should be reproduced for those severs.
---
Elite quests are meant for groups. Also, paladins are great support classes, so you'll shine best when with others. Luckily, the gameplay itself is fairly simple, so it'll be easy for you to follow. 
---
As to shoulderpads, they don't start dropping til lvl 20 at least.
---
Thank god im on EU
---
Ah ok well that’s interesting. Alright thanks for your help
---
How is that ultrawide with other titles?
---
Upgrading some parts in the PC here, along with new KB/M and other little touches to make the whole experience feel even more fresh and exciting.
---
Kevin Jordan confirmed dynamic spawn times were present in Vanilla.
---
Yes, and we are all here debating that non-language-specific-realms will hurt the game in the long run. Blizzard dont want to ruin their game. We dont want blizzard to ruin their game, which we plan on playing.
---
 Im certain this will significantly hurt the long-term playerbase of classic and for what reason? They dont think we would get enough player together for some german or french realms, another reason isnt apparent to me.
---
Im just gonna ignore the insults you slew at me in the last line :)
---
I would imagine these are the younger fans that idolize him but for all we know it could be a 30 year old men begging for invites
---
I agree. Screw sharding. Put in dynamic respawns in the first few starting zones and done
---
Fuck it, you get my upvote for R Kelly.
---
Illiteracy is real.
---
Leeway was intended when most of the world was still working with connections at 100kbps or less. 
---
Now we have connections 10,000 times faster.
---
It needs to go.
---
&gt;people can't remember 12 years ago, except me, i remember, trust what i say
---
lol
---
also the fact that you think it will have any impact at all on mage vs warrior shows how much you should be listened to, it's still going to be a 99.999999999% match up for the mage
---
/r/wowwidows
---
A dash of retail for all the people who hate it...
---
I'm not sure small streamers and their communities will have any more impact than an organized guild would... but the servers Asmonbald, Soda, etc play on will be nothing close to a vanilla experience.
---
While the first week or so might be a shit show if you're on a steamer server, it will eventually die down. These people are looking for their 15 minutes of fame and won't keep up.
---
In the long run, I think streamer servers will be the most stable in terms of player base. They are typically good players who want to play with other good players. 
---
I'll likely roll on whatever soda/asmon are on. Not to stream snipe, but to ensure that I am not on a server that dies after 3 weeks when most people remember how much of a grind vanilla was. I just have to weather the first week-month.
---
So spam? Thats every server.

---
Its pretty large
---
That’s be bad business.  Blizzard will have a plan for what they want to do before classic reaches its end stages.
---
Isn't it for the full phase? It also doesn't always take a long time to do a lot of damage.
---
Why are his bars all just 1 ability on each?
---
That flag is a fire hazard, you just just go ahead and burn it.
---
Somebody who doesn't understand Classic WoW.
---
Sorry if this is a stupid question but...
---
What is layering? After taking 45mins (buffering rales forever on twitch clips for me) to watch the streamable 45 second video it didn't elaborate what is happening on the char select screen just that he had a bunch of warrior alts for some reason at the same level (lvl 1).
---
What exactly is happening? I played vanilla and really want to get back into classic so much so that I'm saving up for a pc now for release. Should I assume classic wow is going to suck now bc of this layering issue?
---
It effects a lot of matchups including that one.
---
just be the good one! If it fits your aesthetic, make it work.
---
You're on a classicwow subreddit getting really annoyed at a bunch of people watching someone play a video game &amp; you're trynna tell me you're not an incel
---
Yeah unfortunately for us non-italian speakers, it's impossible to know that at launch. So we might find out about that when we get to lvl 30-ish and then be forced to reroll somewhere else.
---
It was their DBM. They thought it was me.
---
It's not like there's ever been a serious exploit that 90% of the playerbase used. Usually the damage is done by those few parties causing a lot of grief.
---
Then it will be a game of dodging the German server.
---
If it makes you happy dude... Fucking go nuts.
---
Huh why would you get banned for doing basic game mechanics? It's a dig move, but i don't see that you broke any rules.
---
zoomers got no time for waiting gotta zoom zoom all over the place as fast as they can.
---
I see no issues whatsoever with the screenshot, in fact seems like players found a way to organize.
---
Buy, you've no reason to save money now. In launch, I would focus on a gathering and crafting profession. There are various pairs of professions that complement each other. Paladins will be able to use any armor type, so your options are pretty wide.
---
Also, conjured food a mage makes for you is temporary. Conjured items disappear within 15 min of logging off.
---
I'd recommend selling food items, but keep liquids that restore your mana.
---
Ooooooo like an onion?
---
If we're going to add in features that were simply there for technological limits, then we need to add the technological limits back or their effect on gameplay will change.
---
From now on, your maximum connection speed to WoW servers will be capped at 100kbps.
---
As long as I am sure to make it on a different server, golden.  If somehow I end up on the same server... Snipitty snipe snipe...  These guys need to find out what a pro pvper can do.   Plus, there would be great humor in watching the stream and seeing them rage as they get T-Bagged over and over.  
---
Due to PvP , I suspect these guys will ultimately end up on a RP server, as let's face the facts, anyone from the other faction is going to paint a massive target on them and the crap fanboy/fangirl players they will attract will literally be nothing but fodder between them and thier kills.  
---
Wow was amazing for that, could not even begin to list the number of times we took a 5-10 man group and slaughtered 40 man raids of PVE players who simply didn't understand the rules of engagement in world PvP.  Even by the time they would get organized and just enter/summon the raid or fight back and win if they got organized enough, they already lost hours of time on the raids.  I miss this game.
---
It will be fun, the Ooga crew is just the beginning...
---
This is not correct. Druids easily hit armor cap with consumables and in full Naxx gear are packing around 15k hp with 75 percent physical damage reduction. Crit/crush is not a serious concern and Druids easily survive these encounters. Warriors in that content are dual wielding with TF anyway. Druids can armor cap in T1/pre raid BiS with far superior TPS, so they’re even stronger in early raid content. 
---
Weapon skill is less of a concern for druids because druids are rage capped on every encounter and replace each auto attack with Mail. Maul converts white hits to yellow hits, bypassing glancing blows. Parry is a concern for druids, but it’s equally a concern for DWing warrior tanks who will be triggering parry haste at an increased rate with their offhand (offhand won’t be hit capped). With MCP 3 Mauls fit inside the initial 5 second taunt window, and the odds of getting 3 successive parries in that window is statistically less than 1 percent. This was recently theorycrafted by Taladril and others on the Druid class discord. 
---
The only survivability that matters is enough to survive the fight, and front load enough TPS to remove the threat ceiling for your dps. Druids generate far more threat than warriors, except DW prot/fury warriors dual wielding with TF (who match but don’t exceed it).
---
You need to go.
---
Poggers!!
---
That’s disappointing :(
---
Layering is basically a way to pack more people into a single server.  Areas of the map have seamless multiple instances of an area.  At least based on everything I've read I'm 99% sure that's what it is.
---
Well, I guess I'll just start playing and see what goes down. If thing turn to crap, that's that then.
---
I just took it about 20 minutes ago! it was AWESOME!
---
Sure, and a big reason for the beta and the stress tests are to find ways to prevent abuse.
---
Can’t you just ask in world chat?
---
&gt; wildgunmen#1302 
---
Mistook the username you provided to be a discord one initially. Does your guild currently have a discord server?
---
Didn't their last stress test open to everyone with an active account?
---
No one's dumb enough to not understand it. What's happening is people don't want changes in the first place and don't like being lied to. First two zones and cut off at level 20 was the only reason anyone moved from #nochanges. Now everyone who follows a guide'll be 60 before world PvP or mob tagging factor into the gaming experience. It's a GIANT fuckin change and everyone knows it!
---
I had 20 mb down in 2004.
---
I think it’s against TOS to grief like that
---
Ask what in world chat? Ask on launch day "Hey guys, is this going to be the unofficial italian server?"
---
Nobody knows. Nobody knows until a few weeks in.
---
also his FPS should be capped at 30 tops and you wont have a better resolution than 1024x768 :)
---
&gt;schizophrenic
---
Bipolar?
---
I hope they layer all of the uncontested areas in pvp servers personally.
---
I'm 34 and currently doing a test run on a private server to ensure I'll be on pace to afford a mount at lvl 40.
---
Currently lvl 29 with 27g. I feel like this is on the low end. Highly doubt I'll make 70g in 10 lvls. Likely gonna need to do some math to figure out what spells I can cut out
---
So I'm right there with you, buddy!
---
Alternative to layering would be to make let’s say 5 of each server. These are completely separate at launch, with no layering. After a couple of weeks, each set of 5 is combined into one server.
---
Private servers are 100% wrong. Nobody should be close to exalted, especially by level 40. 
---
Here’s a clip I remember from back in the day on G4TV:
---
https://youtu.be/xqO7AWvfEjg&amp;t=12m28s
---
It mentions a mage which quested from L1 to maximize SW rep and needed 25,000 rep from a repeatable quests to get exalted. For Darnassus, they did the Morrowgrain quest 420 times.
---
The stress test and beta are two different things
---
Yup people were just imaging all the dueling videos of rogues deadzone kiting warriors and restealthing.
---
I'm going to roll a healing class for sure and never played priest. Is it worth it for mind control shenanigans, or is it better off to just get the cap? I'm equally interested in shammy/druid.
---
if they dont remove this shit im out.
---
Why? Because people gotta bitch about fuckin something.
---
If you'd really want to improve that room you'd burn that flag and rep the horde one! Lok'tar Ogar!
---
No, a prostitute.
---
Pretty much.
---
You have never seen a book?  \#getoffmylawn
---
We absolutely do. Would you prefer to discuss things there?
---
There is certainly more to life than Classic WoW. Of course happiness is important but it is possible to have too much of a good thing. Go do other stuff besides think about WoW, occasionally.
---
Maybe we can use Sodapoppins idea and blacklist them all!
---
They are literally in the beta to test these things.  ITS THE BETA!
---
That's the spirit. Lok'tar Ogar.
---
Yeah this seems realistic and feasible. Honestly people are overreacting. Blizz probably just didn't predict how the layering system could be abused by hopping and people have only recently figured out how to do it reliably. Because people are ingenuitive. Because people try to break things. Because it's a beta. They probably didn't imagine that method. It sounds feasible to make the method undoable like you've laid out.
---
Ion never said “no way” but he said the current focus is on making classic as it was. You won’t get any discussion for at least 12 months. Ion did say they will look to the community for guides. I expect TBC will be the additional content once we’ve done all of classic
---
i did play at launch. and it was glorious. this shit has no place in clasic.
---
That's not the issue layering solves.
---
It was on a pserver where moderators tend to be a lot more unprofessional and occasionally ban off of bias or just because they can
---
Yeah it's going to promote farming a ton, you're going to need to get some grind on during phase 1 where everything outside instances can be farmed X-times faster where X is the number of layers. I'm hoping to sprint to 37ish with a few mates then form a group to farm elemental earths/fires for a few levels while there's a bunch of layers to hop through and find live spawns. Once they're suffeciently outleveled it's the last sprint to black lotus layer farming as much as possible before phase 2. Getting that phase 1 bank is going to be absolutely crucial down the line.
---
I mean, you're not wrong
---
Lots of names containing the word “Asmon”, not too hard to figure out which streamer they’re following... this dude is cancer to the fucking game.
---
That's why we have each other! I'd love to do those things but I don't have any friends and have never been touched by a woman so here I'm just waiting for classic to fill the miserable void in my life.
---
Germany only makes up ~11.20% of EU PVE players, 7.33% of EU PVP players, and 2.06% of EU RP players. They're not taking over anything either.
---
Population will plummet, that's guaranteed.
---
A blizzard shareholder!
---
Spotted the warrior main.
---
&gt; but how do you no life a server for a month and not notice you’re on the wrong server?
---
You'll be ahead of the curve, meaning you won't interact with 95% of the population. You also won't spend much time in the capitals because you're busy grinding fat XP.
---
A year and a half sounds like you never got to experience a server launch. It's fun and chaotic as hell, you make lots of friends and even guilds will form spontaneously! It won't be WoW without it imo.
---
There is nothing in the universe I understand or comprehend less than this.
---
Layerrin?  Eli5 pliss.
---
It's awesome. I'm currently enjoying it with Mordhau a lot.
---
Mutual self-interest
---
Completely agree, you could create the argument that fights in recent expansions are fantastic as well. My issue is the fundamental direction of the game. For me the TOC patch was really the beginning of that, even earlier with the option of hard mode in ulduar and 10/25 man, although thats debatable.
---
&gt; Gotta sell those server transfers somehow.
---
Keep that shit away from Classic. No micros.
---
You're ignoring the fact that I have said multiple times that the calculation is only taken into account when one of the players is not a human.
---
It is irrelevant if both players are non tauren. For 2 non taurens the values are always 3 yard sphere, 2 yard melee range outside sphere
---
I'm open to any channel. I'm specifically looking for plans as far as release plans, initial raiding plans (how far past release), loot distribution system(s), class needs, guild structure and the like. Often times a guilds discord might have those types of things pinned, lessening the need for me to bug you or someone else for those details.
---
I’ll be honest here, I don’t understand what’s happening. I’ve never watched a streamer in my life and I have no idea what layering is... also haven’t played WoW since WotLK. 
---
I’ve been pumped for Classic but can someone please quickly explain this for me? What is layering and why does everyone hate streamers? 
---
Thanks.
---
Ahh haha
---
I hear ya. I am on a mini vacation and took my work laptop. Then they announced the stress test, downloaded the client on hotel WiFi overnight . Now I’m leveling on the lowest settings and using a track pad, could not be happier!
---
Layers stay constant except on group invites.
---
It can help you win or avoid PVP fights, that's about it.
---
What a shitty reply lol
---
People trying to join a community event is shameful. Everyone knows Wow is a single player game and other people in the game are just there to annoy you.
---
Remember to check the actual download section to make sure you get the classic version. I couldn't figure out why nothing worked until I ACTUALLY started downloading the classic versions even if the add-on popped up in the classic search.
---
My current rig is five years old and I'm running classic at 200+ fps on maximum settings.  It's amazing!
---
So it's not the same then? Or maybe it will be when blizz decides to leave it in
---
Nice if you're limited to 1 monitor
---
There was nothing glorious about it. It fucking sucked.
---
Were you on a low pop server? My server was a shit show. Blizzard was pleading with us to reroll on other servers. However, it was deemed 'the' pvp server from beta, so we all stayed put.
---
In the first week, my server was down more than it was up. When it was up, you had to fight over tags constantly. It didn't really level out until 20ish. Even then, you likely had competition for named mobs for quests.
---
Well there's a lot of good benefits to engineering depending on your class. The cloth head gear you can craft is pretty gnarly for any clothy. The guns/ammo is good as Hunter, etc... So it really depends if you're trying to speed level or just enjoy the game.
---
If you don't want to keep your professions on par with your level then just wait. If you do want to work on them while leveling be prepared to dedicate a lot of time, especially with engineering. Ores turn to bars which turn to parts which turn to bigger parts which turn to items... (A ton of down time just waiting on crafting).
---
Smacking boars? You're lucky if you can even find a boar to smack in all the chaos! It's called competition, and competition's fun.
---
Not a new station as it's already more than powerful but revamping the whole room.
---
&gt; your goretusk lovers…
---
Oh no, not my concu-swines!
---
Made an account purely to be rude and not even read the post. I was asking if anyone knew the time of the American launch so I could convert it smh.
---
imagine day one, everyone logs in at the exact same time. 100,000 lvl 1 Orc's are now standing in the exact same starting area. Not to mention every other race. 
---
It would be madness. No one would be able to secure mob kills, you wouldn't be able to see the NPC's bla bla bla. 
---
Layering makes like 10,000 copies of that starting zone so there is only 10 people there from any one persons perspective. Those numbers are obviously way off, but you get the idea.
---
I played a shaman named "Cawkshawk" to level 50 before being forced to change my name. Whoever narc'd can eat me.
---
There is also the one in Frostfire Ridge or w/e it's called in WoD, the final quest where you confront thralls uncle. There's 4 different entrances to the little cave thing, but only 2 of them actually trigger the phasing.
---
Needs more panda

Probably wouldve found it if you spelled discord right
---
&gt; MOP was the same for many people. It's like WOW is a pretty lady with all your favorite features except she has the one worst quality you can't enjoy: she's a smoker.
---
It's kinda funny because the more fitting analogy here would be that her character is flawless but she's ugly ;)
---
But your point is taken. Thanks for the respectful discussion.
---
You using the plastic wrapping off the cheese for protectors? Shame
---
I didn't think it was possible to find someone so narrow minded that you are oblivious to what i'm actually discussing, but here you are.
---
Ogres are like prostitutes?
---
Just don't roll on a day 1 server if you have a problem with layering.
---
You’re pretty ... much 😬
---
And what if the population increases like nostalrius or OSRS? More layers?
---
Wheres the info on this? Interested.
---
For as much as people like equality, I find it hilarious that they want languages segregated to their own servers.
---
No it just makes the Argent Dawn hostile to you and Scarlet Crusade friendly.
---
So spellbatching needs to go too?
---
Imagine wanting to revenge kill some mofo who killed you while you was doing escort or sth but you can't actually find and see him because he in a different layer... to me this breaks the game
---
Bottleneck is not relevant to layering. That is not the problem it's solving.
---
Alrighty thanks, that should about do it
---
Recently lvl'd a warr to 60 on pserver and i'm glad I did... so that I don't make that mistake again on classic release.
---
yeah this is how it was in the stress test a few weeks ago...very annoying
---
Just playing devils advocate here. You won’t read trade chat?
---
Thanks!
---
Ahh, dang. I kinda want my cursor to just be like that all the time haha.
---
But its ok to bring DR into classic...?
---
What?
---
He said it will be a drag if the majority is speaking a language he doesn't understand you dumbass. German was just an example. You're on the spectrum for sure.
---
I got two character to Rank 11, Can't decide if I was doing it wrong or creating new meta.
---
You're only as good as your last duel.
---
You're basing your assumption that Blizzard gave you a legitimate reason for combining the language realms, they did not.
---
Neither is the reason you believe: overhead costs of supporting multiple languages. They're still going to have to do that. The WoW Classic client still has a German language option and they're still going to hire German GM's to manage any tickets (though they don't anticipate many and are actively implementing features that weren't in Vanilla to limit the need for tickets).
---
The real reason is they don't believe even the German population (which makes up 20.59% of active WoW players) can support even one Classic realm.
---
Which means they don't plan on releasing enough realms at launch to provide even Germany with it's own realm. That means all of Europe is getting no more than 5 realms. Probably 2 PVP, 2 PVE, and 1 RP.
---
#For as much as people like equality, I find it hilarious that they want languages segregated to their own servers.
---
What's with this mod going berserk on these threads and labeling anyone who criticizes this as racist?
---
How the hell is not understanding other languages and wanting peolpe you can understand to play with racist/bigoted in any way?
---
massively buffs rogues actually. only nerfs rogues vs. warriors my man
---
All great advice! I'll follow all of that. Thanks!
---
I don't think anyone but Blizzard knows for sure.
---
Depends on the amount of servers. 10 servers are enough to have on 100% German
---
I’m 28 and I watch streamers/youtubers play games. I just don’t watch the big market guys, just people/groups that I find entertaining.
---
I wasn’t there at launch in 2004 but I remember a lot of discussions about the server of choice in forums, you should make some research for the launch date. I guess the people here on reddit will know if a server will be taken and by who, you can ask here. 
---
As for Italians, I will comunicate the server on this sub reddit once it’s chosen.
---
Sure you can do that. You can go fedex/explore as well. Every option is dramatically slower than playing normally like the first 50 people will be doing, if you value your time you'll just come back the next day and forget about launch day.
---
I just genuinely hope there'll be a streamer server per region that the streamer fans can join and enjoy, leaving the people who don't want to deal with it with the easy option of any other server.
---
Since you mentioned relearning, how easy were fights to pick up? If there were 10 new people to a 40 man fight, would this be an expected wipe night?
---
Pathetic.
---
So don't raid and don't watch raid videos.  Problem solved.
---
Same.
---
You know, I thought that there was pretty much no way Blizzard could ever fuck it up when making Classic; after all, they are not even making a new game, they are just re-creating an old one. So as long as they don't change anything, they can't make mistakes.
---
Aaaand then they decide to find new ways to fuck it up anyways.

Wouldn't enchanting be good even if you're rushing it? Or do you need the gold from vendored greens? Maybe it would benefit lock/paladin a lot.

---
It’s not bigoted in the slightest. Why should a French speaker be forced to speak English?
---
I love my European neighbours, however I’ve seen what realms with a large demographic of non-English speakers can do to the community on an English speaking realm.
---
When I say non-English speakers, I mean players who deliberately choose to use their native language in public channels and exclusively play with others from their country.
---
That mean dynamic respawns? No, those suck for all kinds of other reasons. I buy that the tourist threat is real so I say, just shard the first two zones for like a week and at level 20 it's real WoW. Done and done.
---
Here’s another source which did all the NE quests back in 2006:
---
http://www.shadowsongeurope.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-10975.html
---
Even with all the quests, at L48 they spent 7 levels just grinding gold+runecloth turn-ins.
---
Of course
---
You’re not making any sense pal.
---
It won't be 10 servers. It will be at most 5.
---
If 20.59% of the active EU playerbase doesn't get a single realm of their own, then Blizzard isn't planning to give all of Europe more than 5 realms.
---
Probably 2 PVE, 2 PVP, and 1 RP.
---
Seals are a fucking mess in the beta..
---
You are doing the lights work!
---
It's hardly griefing to use your spells to knock someone off a cliff. It's basic use of mechanics.
---
Ah, that explains. I would have been shaking my head if the actual company would ban you over it.
---
They should just make a server for streamers only.
---
You should keep her.
---
Yeesh, how dense can you be.
---
Yep. Most people know that pservers aren't entirely correct. Though many of them did a decent job using the data they had available by utilizing 2.0.1 values which are easily findable using the web archive.
---
That's an interesting video though.
---
Its the same people that follow streamers around like a puppy spamming poggers, omegalul and pepe memes. 
---
The defense force in full swing in this thread.
---
This clip is pretty useless, if you want to know more, you would have to watch the entire 10 minutes he talked about this
---
We got a world pvp hero here boys.
---
I don't blame you, they created the system, it's not your responsibility to babysit it.
---
Doesn't solve anything, for all we know the people posting on reddit are only a small percentage of people who are gonna play WoW Classic. The issue will still remain because not everyone reads forums / reddit
---
Maybe you just don't understand English.
---
What is the NA playerbase compared to EU? If there are also 5 NA servers there will be only streamer server lol.
---
chop up the gnomes sylvanas
---
Maybe at level 40 after you've bought your mount, but without being able to vendor skins, I think you'll want all the silver you can get from vendoring quest items.
---
30 to 40 beta test showed it's very good with a decent group. You want warriors/mages mainly.
---
Relax, baseball is boring
---
I mean, people shouldn't get free shit. It's the entire reason why buying/selling gold isn't allowed.
---
The torrent of "invite to admin layer" messages didn't tip you off?
---
The game already has that.
---
Maybe your statement just makes no sense whatsoever. How does creating realms for each language promote inequality? Perhaps you mean diversity?
---
I don't know man, I recall Orgrimmar was burning pretty bad when I raided it and it's probably because all those loincloths you beasts call flags were laying around everywhere in the city.
---
When you walk past a French guy in the store and hear him in French, do you scream at him, "English, motherfucker!  Do you speak it?"  Of course not.  No one is forcing anything.  You are getting the great melting pot that is WoW.
---
but when will the french learn that you don't put a space before punctuation characters? :(
---
&gt;thinking french canadians will apologize for anything
---
The armor cap is like 22k. You don't reach that in T1/pre-bis, that's silly. You have about half of that in pre-bis. You don't ever actually just have 22k armor permanently, the "armor cap" is something you hit temporarily with the priest and shaman +25% armor buff from their crit heals. 
---
Warriors get about 10% less mitigation from armor, but defensive stance gives 10% reduced damage from everything. Druids don't even get hit for significantly less physical damage, they just have more health. When you then add the warrior's better avoidance, their cooldowns, shield block, defense, and the much smoother gearing process, it becomes silly to try to argue that druids are equally tanky.
---
If druids easily tanked everything and had much better TPS, they would be popular main tanks. As I'm sure you would agree, they aren't. It's not because nobody has tried. We experimented extensively with it back in the day when 1.8 brought the druid talent overhaul, and it just didn't produce results. Druids *can* tank, and I'm in favor of bringing one feral OT to raids, but they're just objectively inferior tanks for any but the select few bosses that have some quirky mechanic where you want a druid.
---
You can theorycraft all you want, but platitudes aren't reality. There's no golden setup where you just magically always have "just enough survivability." Healing can be inconsistent, the boss might crit three times in a row, maybe half the healers stood in the fire and died, etc. There's no arbitrary line you can draw where you just get to win if you're exactly *this* tanky. Assuming the content is challenging in the first place and you actually have to optimize in order to succeed, a warrior tank increases chance of success by quite a bit over a druid.
---
Dancing Troll Village and Old Ironforge are high on that list for me. 
---
This video still gives me crazy nostalgia feels.
---
https://youtu.be/Q_U_VowdeVU

And not the bastardized version of the word nostalgia people throw around all the time today. I mean the original greek version that is more akin to homesickness.
---

---
Vanilla mind control gave replaced your main action bar with an action bar with the targets abilities, and let you used them or damage enemies or buff/heal allies.  Also, in modern wow, enemies become immune to cc if you keep using it, but in Vanilla you could keep re-mind controlling the same enemy all the way through a zone or dungeon of you wanted to.
---
Stress Test 15 wasn't even playable last night for me. There wasn't even mobs to grind. Legit stuck at Level 2 unless I wanted to explore which I don't think is a fun way to level, and even then you face the same issue.
---
Today it was playable for me. They might have changed 15's layering, as early reports were it had minimal layering while 3 had heavy layers from the start
---
This missed time with kids will be soul-crushing once they're grown and gone.  It's such a small and important window. You're going to hate yourself for missing that time to play vidya.
---
Early vanilla raids were never so much mechanically difficult as they were finding a competent team.  With years now of practice in WoW and other games, I suspect it will be easy for the determined.
---
Now that there will be little to no lag I might actually clear Loatheb &gt;.&lt;
---
Hell yeah. This is the stuff I was looking for.
---
Yeah that doesn't sound fun. Sucks because I like the rest of the class.
---
There are plenty defenders, you don't see them?
---
Layering is not designed to solve lag or DCs, it's purpose is to reduce the number of dead realms after the initial hype dies. &lt;10% of initial players will stick around in any meaningful way past the first month or so.
---
So yes, you mean diversity rather than equality. Your argument is fucking moronic so I’m not even going to give you a response.
---
Do you need a French Only drinking fountain?  Or a French Only part of the bus?
---
&gt; It has always been all zones, its a full world copy.
---
 It wasn't always this, when they announced classic they mentioned both zone and time restrictions for this, now they've announced the actual implementation is only time restricted. It's disingenious to say it has always been, and planned to be, this.
---
But how much? 50%? 75%? 90%? If Blizzard overestimates, then layering is here to stay.
---
were it not for MC, I would not be maining a priest come launch.
---
Have fun on your private servers.
---
No I don't mean diversity.  You've given me five responses.
---
Doubtful that Blizzard would make an official streamer server. They'd have to enforce that somehow and ... just not gonna happen (though I'd like that)
---
I just hope that the streamers will be happy to play on the same server without having to be forced.
---
My own advice: don't play retail. It's not a good game anymore. Play Classic. It will be epic, a lot of people will switch to classic.
---
I haven't seen anyone mention per login layers. Basically treat lays like subdivisions of servers. You want to change layers you have to logout and login to another. Basically the same as having a lot of servers that you later merge, without the downsides because you are always already adding and dropping layers on the fly.
---
/r/therewasanattempt
---
anecdotal but I lived today with 4 hp bc I had a copper bomb that let me get a last second heal off.
---
Yeah I just realized, I meant to reference 5 man dungeons in your list, not BGs. Sorry for the confusion.
---
That's probably the least painful solution I've seen for this
---
Taking an already niche game with very suspect level of hype, and then attempting to fracture and splinter it even further, because of your paranoia over an extreme and silly hypothetical, will only result in empty servers and dead communities, defeating the entire purpose of classic.
---
Most are playing on the same server, thankfully
---
There's a difference between a guy like you, with a complete, fulfilling life and family, with WoW as a hobby and the 40+ year old that has absolutely nothing in their life besides WoW and obsessing about WoW.
---
&gt; peacebloom
---
uhh how bout ppl blitzing to 60 and camping black lotuses in near empty zones then?
---
He's a bigot and he deleted his post and his account because he has a post history full of bigoted shit and he got called out on it.
---
So not only are you blindly defending a bigot and his bigoted behavior but you're also shaming Autism in the same breath. You ignorant fucks all come out at the same time don't you?

If melee leeway needs to go then spell batching needs to go too.

The whole zone is a graveyard / shrine. You'll have to be more specific.

Warlock or Paladin, i love the op death coil at 42 with lock, but i never played vanilla palli and i wanted to give it a shot
---
They didn't say they were done, they said that they would be slowing invites down.
---
Layering will not be in the game past phase 1. You will see queues/free transfers before that happens.
---
They probably will be. It really doest matter though. The majority of the players including those who will push for raiding quickly want no changes. Easy is not necessarilly bad. Will some people be dissapointed when it is a breeze. Yep. But those who truly love it for what it is will stick with it.
---
I'm sorry, but are you seriously *that* naive?!
---
I've watched the video and read several comments and still have 0 idea what layering is. What layers are we talking about?
---
The problem is long-term population health, after the initial rush. To handle this, Blizzard is opening up a massive population per server, so once the "exodus" happens, theres still a healthy sized playerbase. But we can't have 10k people on one server, without other methods, so layering/sharding \*is\* the solution to the problems that arise. Bottlenecking occurs because of the inflation of population, and some solution is *necessary* to handle that.
---
The only thing that matters is oceanic realms, i personally welcome the Taiwanese, Philippines, Malaysia and Singaporeans players to our server, feel free to speak whatever language you like, JUST PUT A GOD DAM SERVER IN SYDNEY.

POGGERS IN THE CHAT BOYS

Considering I’ll be reserving every item I need as a tank, I’d say yes.
---
Always wondered what a keyboard turners setup looked like.
---
Someone's going to have to breed out the boar population
---
okok
---
Yeah I gave it some thought but was too lazy to edit or reply. I was also only thinking about it from a Warrior perspective.  
---
Either way the leeway NEEDS to stay in Classic. I'd much rather keep this in the game then changing it(It's Blizz-like), because once you start making changes then more people will start complaining, and the Blizzard-Destroyed-WoW cycle starts all over again. Keep it in, and when more Pserver players whine, just point out how they were wrong about Elite mob damage, loot drop %, how certain skills worked, etc  
---
Also for the people who want to roll Alliance, this means a little less Orcs to deal with.
---
I mean aside from the fact that you will not be able to do like any of that early game, those are good ideas for a hunter only
---
+1 for Asia Pacific. Don’t care where. Sydney sounds fair enough.
---
Please mods, don't be pussies this time and don't lock the thread because of 2-3 chauvinistic people, we NEED to debate of this topic, it's really important for the future of Classic WoW, and you going on a power trip and silencing our voices is detrimental to our cause.
---
I'll be doing it. My love for Warriors will carry me through.
---
Europe saw 414,115 character logins in the last 30 days.
---
The US saw 418,023 charaters logins in the last 30 days.
---
But my guess is that US Pacific will get 1 PVP, 1 PVE, and 1 RP. US Mountain will get none, so they'll use the Pacific realms. US East will get 1 PVP, 1 PVE, and 1 RP as well. US Central will get none, so they'll use the Eastern realms.
---
The reason for US getting 6 realms and EU only getting 5 even though their populations are pretty much equal is geography. The US is huge and the ping time between coastal cities is more than it is across an ocean.
---
What I'm really curious about is Latin America / Brazil and Australia. Australia only has 37% the active population that Germany does. If Germany doesn't get its own server, Australia will probably be forced to play on US Pacific servers again like they were in the old days.
---
I also quit in Cata before shards/layers, here's what I've gathered: it's like when you were doing the instanced quests and the wortld changed around you, and couldn't see those who were at the different stage of that quest (like it was in IC for example).
---
Layering is pretty much that, except the world is the same and it's randomly chosen who you are in the same instance (layer) I think. It helps taking the load off the server.
---
Now, assmango is one layer, the kids are on another, but if someone invites them to the same layer he's in, they join the same layer so they can follow him around.
---
Hope it helped.
---
The official view is that they're all fucked up.
---
I just watched that video an hour ago. That guy was amazing.
---
ND had 15k on release and even recently with Classic release.
---
omega laugh out loud
---
How is this a community event exactly?
---
One-shot*
---
I'm pivoting this anyways
---
That's some great re-posted speculation on your part!
---
ONLY STARTER ZONES SHOULD HAVE LAYERING FOR THE FIRST 2 WEEKS. WTF!!!?

This guide is about raid tanking but its still a great read to understand bear tanking and how it differs from warrior tanking [Taladril’s Treatise on Druid Tanking in Vanilla](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/#plink-tank-and-dps-build)
---
Here is one of the best gear list i've seen [Taladril's List of Druid Gear] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wGBasFY8fFGpBtiD1TAUBB99wxboCSVh5MW_6b_z0oU/pubhtml)

---
Also remember 50g Respec is after multiple respecs and the cost actually goes down week by week,  I keep seeing this 50g Respec cost realistically it should stay fairly low
---
10k is too low by the way, I'm thinking 20k or 25k at initial launch. Need to account for the tourists plus the fact that everyone will be on at the same time.
---
That's just blatantly incorrect. I joined Asmon's guild on the stress test server and almost everyone said they were somewhere in the 20-30 range. Of course they could be lying... But kids likely had school at that time. It's college aged to young adults. I don't think a lot of teens would find Asmon entertaining.
---
He was having some raid on the Gurubashi Arena so a bunch of people made characters and they all wanted to jump into the arena at the same time.
---
But you can make them.
---
Lack of RP-PVP realms killed mine.
---
They gave access to basically everyone, i think they want to approximate launch day server load.
---
That one dudes name is “kiss me asmon”
---
It seems to me it will be the only way these streamers will actually be able to play the game day 1. Imagine being Asmongold just trying to quest with 100 people around you. They will be massive advertisers for the game, there really should be a streamer server so Blizzard doesn't miss that opportunity.
---
No one is talking about the fact that maybe their systems just worked better than they thought they would?
---
My problem with layering last night was around 11pm est I had to group up with someone to trade with them because they weren't in the same layer as me. But Orgrimmar felt completely empty. So it wasn't like we needed to be layered. I'm hoping that was more of a symptom of them testing it.
---
BRS... good times
---
Best guess looks like 20-38% drop rate, hard to confirm b4 wowhead can monitor mass drops.

I think 10k is closer to what it *should* be. If 25k is what they go with, they have to expect 90% of the traffic to vanish over 2 weeks... doesn't seem likely to me.
---
Is it really a repost if I'm the one that created it in the first place?
---
&gt; As always
---
Feral always made pretty good threat.  One of my friends was a feral off tank and they went through AQ.
---
Nice! Don't worry about this horde children, the only time they'll have a chance to beat you is when they get a five man together and find you alone. For the alliance!
---
Layering is the only thing im worried about runing classic. We gotta come together so they know how important it is to us!
---
Compared to retail yes for sure, expecially through phases 1-3
---
I really hope they fix it and make it like it was in vanilla just so dunces like you get rekt.
---
Were you in a dungeon or just in a zone?
---
In a dungeon, group loot is preferred.
---
In a zone, FFA all the way (unless you're specifically sticking together on all kills).
---
I disagree on this one, if the debuff limit were removed raids would need to be retuned.
---
I’m not really up to date on streamers, but seems to me like the biggest ones by far are US - are there any big ones on EU?
---
I’ve been playing ND and it’s not just the 1-12 zones, it’s arguably getting worse as I start to get to zones with less quests. This post was in reference to layering in general which has been unpopular.
---
it's going to be same thing as many years ago with for example polish community on eu servers, some people picked burning legion, some picked terenas later defias brotherhood. Later more people moved to BL and BL is biggest polish community on wow but sure some guilds are still on other realms trying to fight international community. People will play see that server sucks in terms of language specific communities and start over on different server with a friend or just hearing that there's a grp of ppl speaking their language. Servers by themselves will become known as german/italian/polish/ as it is on modern game now in english tab with languages that are not separated.
---
50% gone from attrition and another 50% from synchronized launch (play time/day shifting) seems about right to me. We'll be able to make some inferences from the number of servers once available but I wouldn't expect more than 30ish worldwide.
---
🧀
---
Don´t know why you are being downvoted, there are players who don´t speak english. They would need to add this on the terms of service that the game requires English.
---
It’s classic wow 200ms is perfectly playable. Plus I was already planning on playing on US servers anyway because I hate playing with other Australians.
---
You sure on those stats?
---
Someone else claimed German players made up 20% of EU players. Which would mean EU only has 425,000 active players.
---
Was it posted more than once?
---
I'm talking about [this](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-european-realms-structure/56694) actually, streamers are nothing we have to deal with (honestly, this stuff seems way worse).
---
I disagree on this one, if the debuff limit were removed raids would need to be retuned which would be difficult and change the vanilla raiding experience greatly.
---
You do realize that leeway only existed because of bad ping and with todays internet it completely destroys kiting. Its basically the content of the vid but you are stil adamant about no changes because you are paranoid that there will be more after some? Having that leeway in does more to negatively impact the game than layer abuse for lotus farming ever could
---
Champion Herod or VanCleef
---
By using our brains.
---
I can’t build decks to save myself...I’ve got to distract them with smell!
---
THERE ARE DOZENS OF US!
---
3/3 Blizzard is still better. It's the only way you can make sure the mobs take the full damage of the spell.
---
So why layering? Why not just shard the lowbie zones?
---
The massive population isn't going to be at Kazzak. Why layer Kazzak?
---
Uh oh... better call Maiev Fordragon, the Earth Warder.
---
^^^^^ it’s also to make getting quest drops faster. Means I don’t have to wait for “my turn” on group loot to *maybe* get a Murloc eye or whatever. When you’re done just leave those for the others.
---
What is layering?
---
Do you not have an iron to fix those pleats?
---
This is almost a "change" because everyone was on slower internet at the time, so gameplay will be different with this.
---
Yeah, on 15 in the human areas, everyone was grouped up. Didn't help, it was still a giant cluster.
---
Druids keep up with hunters surprisingly well in the leveling race, better than any other class assuming mages don't get to aoe farm uncontested.
---
So I should have kept the first 2 paragraphs and then linked him to my comment for the rest of the discussion? No.
---
This is much easier to do during the first hours of "launch day" with all of the US crammed into 2 servers, which is basically what's going on in this video.
---
Seconded!
---
One time I was sick of my friends hunting grounds that I just grabbed it off the table and ate it
---
 What if the raids turn out to be way too easy?
---
What if leveling turns out to take a long time?
---
I feel like you're just saying things we already know.  Many of the raids (especially Ony/MC) were made such that you could complete them even with 'dead weight' of friends that were terrible at the game.
---
If you want to increase the challenge, you can:
---
1.  Go in while undergeared.
---
2.  Try to clear it with as few players as possible (better loot-to-player ratio)
---
3.  Try to speed run it.
---
Yeah, because only brits are monolinguals.
---
The context here that the circle-jerk of hating streamers doesn't want to emphasize is they were trying to have a giant free for all in the Gurubashi arena and loads of the participants were on different layers so they were calling for invites and the raid leaders in the correct layer were inviting them.
---
Jesus Christ, please fix your shitstorm Blizzard.
---
I got lucky quite a bit with fast fireball cast times, but I think for launch I'll be writing out macros to make it more efficient lol.
---
95% time its waiting for a 3.8 second auto attack with no procs.
---
Definitely makes sense, thank you.
---
[Check this out then ](avoidstreamers.com)
---
I didn't say you shouldn't re-post.  I just pointed out that it was.
---
I have the left bindings on one toon and the right bindings on two other toons or something like that. I can't remember how it's all distributed but yeah it pisses me off so much that I like the left and right halfs on different toons.
---
414,115 active characters, not players, and yes [they're accurate](http://www.warcraftrealms.com/eu_realmstats.php).
---
Just because you don't understand the issue doesn't mean nobody does.
---
I'm against layering.
---
I'm for sharding lowbie zones.
---
Or you can just roll on a server that isn't occupied by a streamer. Its almost like you have control over your destiny without a company having to interfere on your behalf.
---
I disagree with the exception of a stress test to which I would not give a shit. 
---
But in normal gameplay I would always want group loot with strangers. Why would you want FFA with randos at all? Melee classes would get it all.
---
🤢
---
This was in a very tight area out in the world. And that's my point, when it is taking 3 or 4 people to tag the mob. It's everyone's kill.
---
If people were spread out where you wouldn't see the mob to loot quickly... I wouldn't be grouping up.
---
It was a good/addicting grind.  There won’t be as much falloff as you think.
---
I just recently leveled a pally/warrior combo.  I suggest going rent with maybe getting a couple of the early talents that help with healing pushback for pvp.  Otherwise you’re going to hate your life.
---
Here is the cool part about warriors, especially if your horde, you are the only mail wearer for the longest time, then you get plate, so if you are the only plate wearer in your party, you get all the plate gear as the horde will have no other plate wearer, your only competition will come in on rings, trinkets, necks, and weapons, so discuss it with your group and go from there.
---
Only Diablo gets a title. &lt;Lord Of Terror&gt; is pretty awesome
---
Yup. Built a new desk. Picked up a Gsync ultrawide monitor. New Mouse. All kinds of stuff in preparation for Classic.
---
Sounds like an abuse of power as a streamer but I guess if you can find 39 retards to go along with it then more power to them I guess.
---
Group loot and FFA drop items at the same rate (for the group as a whole). So instead of fighting over tags (the point of grouping up), you're fighting to see who can get to the mob and right click fastest.
---
Orc warrior is really the only choice for PVP on Horde. WOTF is good but that resist is godly (+axe specialisation and extra damage)
---
MC and Ony will be Pugged. Maybe not until Phase 2 but they definitely will be Pugged.
---
Layering is a global form of sharding.
---
Sharding is when you have multiple copies of the same zone running on the same server. So you and I could both be standing at Sarkoth, but we don't see each other and we can both kill Sarkoth.
---
Layering is that, but over the entire continent. So if we're in different "layers", we will never see eachother, there are multiple copies of the entire world on the same server.
---
Layering the entire world is stupid, when only the lowbie zones need it. And yes, they absolutely need it.
---
I have bought a 27 curved monitor, a mouse, mechanical keyboard, soundcard, mic, 2 fans, ergonomic cushion. Pc internals are 5 years old so good enough.
---
This seems more specific to layering than streamers. If they were all on one unified server, the general chat wouldn't be cluttered. They just want to be on the same layer as their idol.
---
I haven't played Wow in almost a decade. What is layering?
---
Vanilla Collectors Edition digital code. It’s expensive to buy these days.
---
I sadly am!
---
I used to work in that environment.  Played wow in my office.  Grew to despise the whole scenario.  So I’ve gone all Peter Gibbons, lunch pail and all.
---
On my test server we all stood in a circle around the spot where Sarkoth spawned.
---
Here's the cool part with a warrior if noone has mentioned, you are the only mail wearer for a while, then you get plate, if you are horde, you are the only plate wearing class, so if you arent running with another warrior, you will only be rolling against people on rings, trinkets, necks, and weapons, so talk with your group and you're set.
---
Fuck that, having to avoid a couple of non-english realms is way easier than avoiding realm of "influencers" because there are going to be shitload of those on NA.
---
#nochanges
---
I loved this as well back then.   Haven’t mulitboxed in a while.  Too much toxicity from other players.
---
OR just go farm mobs and get more xp than you would waiting for the quest.
---
Honestly, using the new Classic version of Wowhead is perfectly fine if you can't get an answer in game or you just want some quick information.  Don't let anyone tell you you're ruining the experience or something by using a third party resource, we all used Thottbot back in the day, Wowhead is just the better version of that.
---
Your hype over a remaster of a 15 year old game I'm hyped for has me even more hyped for release.  Dude, August can't come soon enough.
---
Asmongold only got famous because they world became so retarded that a guy that sits in his room and plays wow all day makes more sense.
---
42% of Asmongold audience is between the ages of 25-35, another 17% between 35-45. Under 20 is his 2 smallest % followers.
---
I believe that was a feature of holy light in warcraft 3. It could heal allies or damage undead.
---
I noticed troll berserking speed seemed a little off.  
---
 
---
After gathering several data points, this appears to be Berserking's behavior on the beta/stress realm:    
---
at 100% health, you gain 10%. For every 2% health below 100%, the bonus is multiplied by 1%, so for example. At 95.6% health, you gain 13%\~ haste or 10% times 2.5%\~  
---
up to 40%, giving you 10% times 30% or 43% total haste. There's no way that's intended
---
they're so fucking fun when geared, but it's the ultimate long game in terms of class selection
---
If they are too easy, players will do split raids or 30 man it.
---
https://www.avoidstreamers.com/
---
Depending on how long each phase goes I think the game can be pretty alt friendly you have raid locks so can only farm them once a week etc obviously consumable and Matt farming is another grind entirley but you also don't have dailies anymore that need to be logged in and done on every toon you have no azerite neck that needs to be farmed on every toon and the end goal is always the same so your gear youve farmed on that alt doesn't become outdated and useless
---
Based on the news that Germany isn't getting one and they have 2.7 players for every one of yours, it's unlikely Australia is getting it's own servers either.
---
Better get used to that ping time to Los Angeles!
---
Late late night gamer here. I'm used to being one of the only English speakers in a 5-man
---
A windfury melee group (rouge/warrior/shaman) comp will have zero downtime and extreme dps for their level -- you'd be able to burn through mobs very fast without need for rest.
---
They're not even making language servers. I'd be stunned if they made an official streamer server.
---
The streamers are gonna play, stream and thusly advertise the game anyways, how do you think a special streamer server would improve that for Blizzard? Genuine question, not trying to be snarky (it kinda reads that way doesnt it?)
---
IF Patch 1.13 ever came. It would have to be a Scarlet Crusade raid.
---
After the victory at Naxxramas the Scarlet Crusade begin to turn their attention to the corrupt living!
---
Good luck to you, friend. You're gonna need it
---
You're a gentleman &amp; a scholar, sir, thank you. I'm bookmarking that straight away.
---
I hit r12 when I was in 5th grade.
---
Honestly no idea how I managed to do that at 11 years old.
---
I love tanking. Once I started I just can't stop.
---
I dabbled in a private server, I'm fairly certain they are completely overtuned. Classic is much easier.
---
TIL: Swabia is a thing
---
You won't need to check when you hit 60. They will message you "Hey can you help me with Whirlwind Axe quest!?"
---
Italian, Russian,French speakers in Europe are going to do the same thing they did in early vanilla. They are going to habitant specific servers. I still remember Crushridge being a de facto Italian server and that was the case for many other European communities .
---
This image is exactly why I fucking love classic. Seeing a shadow priest with Bad Mojo Mask is INSTANTLY recognizable to me. I wore that for like 10 levels. I played BfA for 7 months and didn't recognize or care about 1 piece of gear.
---
Horde is full of badasses, Alliance is full of cucks.
---
REEEEEEEE  BIGOTS EVERYWHERE!! #lovetrumpshate 
---
Thanks for continuing to make the internet funny buddy. :) Just make sure you don’t stroke out raging at a made up boogeyman.
---
Funny tho, I read this everywhere. Russians don't wanna play with Russians, same for French and a bunch of other nationailities. Before this whole shebang unleashed yesterday I thought this wasn't such a widespread thing.
---
I hope you're right. I just think people are so used to being spoon-fed progress. I fear that people will lose interest once they can't lfg raids and are stuck in blues.
---
I LOVE(D) classic wow and am anxiously awaiting it's release. However, I am dreading the 1-60 grind. It was a grind when I could play 10+ hours a day. I can't imagine how it will be now that I'm lucky if I get 3-4 hours of gaming a day.
---
That was a rollercoaster of a story.
---
&gt;Aaaand then they decide to find new ways to fuck it up anyways.
---
I kind of expected this. There is a perverted mentality to create problems where there were none previously and, in my life, I've seen it become more and more prevalent. Nothing can be done properly anymore. Everything must be sabotaged, even a recreation of an old game that had all the ingredients already listed. 
---
Sharding 1-60. Absofucking unreal.
---
Kind of fits my indecision ;)
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/zYKjwjd](https://imgur.com/a/zYKjwjd) screenshot of that behavior

I wish you could put gifs into comments because I would totally use the Chang gif from community....”Gaaaaaaaaaay”
---
(I am not against gays, just would be a perfect use of the gift. Love is love)
---
Why oh why oh why would you ever pick a Human priest over a Dwarf priest?
---
Because realistically, each language group will need at least 3 (or 4 if they cave on rp pvp) servers. If they're planning on having 10 servers or something, then they can't really subdivide that without having a ton of abandoned servers.
---
Except Russia, because of the different keyboard thing.
---
That is what it takes to be a shill
---
On private servers they’re pugged after a few weeks of server release.
---
Where'd you get the 138ms from? 170 is about the best you can hope to get from AU -&gt; NA, 190-210 is typical.
---
You alright dude? You seem personally mad about this.
---
Exactly. It’s already happening too. There’s a reason they made separate realms for various languages and it’s because it was a fucking awful experience for everyone involved on those realms.
---
Excellence is a habit, not an act.
---
Hoard seems to tread extremes of the age range, alliance in the middle.
---
Hoard also trends a bit harder core.
---
Because fear ward is over rated and I hate dwarves. 
---
I’m not min maxing and even if I were there are only about 8 or 10 encounters that fear ward are helpful with.. but you only need it if your warriors don’t stance dance.
---
[Thoughts?](https://community.mmobase.de/forum/thread/11560-lenovo-der-feurige-bestrafer/)
---
Dwarf is the only good one in terms of racials and if I were going to sacrifice the superior racials for not having to be a Dwarf... I'd probably just go Night Elf.
---
Why would they do that?
---
Nax will still be fucking hard
---
the mods here are honestly terrible, why these losers can't just remove spam instead of trying to interject their own personal garbage into everything is beyond me
---
Realistically, you're wrong. Portugal has it's own server. Yes, one, and it's PVE.
---
And there are no RP realms in Oceania, Latin America, Brazil, Russia, Italy, all of China, Korea, and Taiwan.
---
It's pretty clear that Blizzard isn't planning to give EU 10 servers, otherwise they'd give the language population that makes up 20% of the EU playerbase their own.
---
It's most likely to be five. 2 PVP, 2 PVE, and 1 RP.
---
Incels gonna incels I suppose
---
Ahh, I completely missed his point.  Thanks.
---
If the raids are too easy I probably won’t care ( I always liked the Dungeons more anyway). The  thing is that I’m not looking forward to the difficulty... the best part about Classic raids easily is the community within the Guild. I played on Nost and I still miss everyone I played with almost every day because we were such a tightly knit community. I look back at the people, not the fights.
---
Remindme! 2days
---
Almost every HC guild is going Alliance.
---
Vanilla is a game about social interactions, that's the entire point. Are you seriously calling the desire to be able to properly interact and socialize effectively with the players on your server akin to racial segregation lmfao? How retarded can you be? What group is being marginalized here? Can you find literally anyone that wouldn't rather play with people they can communicate with?
---
Your friends are doing all that, but missing out on taking the tram from IF to SW, the zeppelin between continents, running through the Barrens or killing bandits in Westfall.  Who is doing more?
---
Nah, but has to be fixed. Because of spellbatching the flag will drop at the gy instead of where you died when you revive in the same tick as the flag drops, its not even rare.
---
This is nonsense again.  It suggests that a Human attacking a tauren will have its melee range reduced because of the target being a tauren.  This is needlessly complex from a server perspective.
---
Since you appear to have beta, you could easily prove me wrong by testing two humans.  
---
MT = 4.00  
---
FT = 3.70  
---
NT = 1.50  
---
Range = 1.50  
---
MT + MT = 9.5  (It will compare as &lt;9.5, which is why you get 9.4x in testing).  
---
MT + NT = 7.0 (It will compare as &lt;7.0. which is why you got 6.9x in testing).  
---
NT + NT = 4.5 You have not tested this but claim it will be 5.0.
---
That's...just dumb.
---
So I take it you're never planning on fighting a Warlock or another Priest, ever?
---
I'm so excited now!!!!
---
The age old question:
---
Would you rather kill a gnome, or have one in your party?
---
To be pretty... Duh
---
Mini Diablo. Not even a hard decision.
---
*Literally everyone:* I'm playing enhance.
---
Retail has bot catching nodes. This is probably a relic of that system. There are a number of nodes that spawn above or below the ground where a player cannot click them, the bot will try to gather them because it's a pip on the map.
---
That's what he's asking for though.  He wants a shop just for French people.
---
I've had Imp on aggressive and defensive and sometimes it will attack but most of the time it'll sit there.
---
Apparently you will be.

How about you source your claim?

You're a moron. #nochanges is what got us Classic in the first place. These streamers are cancers to the game, and will infect their servers, leaving them feeling like retail, thus killing any kind of community that might have otherwise grown on that realm. Just because a bunch of pre-teens with obsessions over Twitch streamers shout "no changes" doesn't mean they are on our side, or that they even care about it. For all they care about, #nochanges is just a meme.
---
You sir are the hero we deserve.  Thank you.
---
Didnt take you for a spriest
---
Can confirm.  Was doing double the damage of level 24 dd’s as an 18 hunter in deadmines.  Not a twink.  Anecdotal evidence but my owl hits like a truck.
---
idk i always wanted them to open up hyjall back then
---
It got us Classic.
---
it's fun to help, especially if you've leveled a warrior and know how good it feels.
---
Flip it.  He doesn't want to speak to English people, so all the English should be on their own server where he won't meet as many.  Still OK?  It's the same thing.
---
I’ll add in my choice, do I play a dwarf priest because I’ll admit their facials are better...or do I go NE solely to be different...
---
I’m thinking nightelf
---
I gave 100g to Asmongold and he said my name on stream :)
---
less people same loot
---
Depends on the fight. For the vast majority of fights it won't present much of a problem (as long as you've explained the very basic mechanics). But for some fights experience actually matters. C'Thun is the one that comes to mind the most, just because it's such a big step up above the rest of AQ40. With 30 experience and 10 inexperienced players, you could very easily 1 shot all the other bosses in AQ40.. but C'Thun would be an almost guaranteed wipe. 
---
In Naxx of course there are bosses that inexperienced people can wipe the raid because of mechanics (eg. Thaddius) or that you just can't afford to have people not performing on (eg. 4H, Sapph, KT), but it doesn't feel as pronounced as with C'Thun.
---
You'll get heaps of servers, you will just have to share them with other languages, like we always have in Australian anyway, our MMO servers are normally always full of SEA players. We don't really care about the language barrier, more people for BGS and whatnot is good. :)
---
I don’t plan on PVPing
---
Why would you bring more players than you need? Less gear for everyone and fun is over before it started and evryone back to waiting for a week.
---
Good question. Horde it is!
---
&gt;German servers saw 85,289 characters login to WoW in the last 30 days.
---
&gt;Australian servers saw 31,600 characters login to WoW in the last 30 days.
---
Are these real retail numbers? That's fucking amazing if so -
---
interesting, thanks for pointing that out. Still, other regions will be upset if they only get a PvE server for their language. whereas regions like poland are used to not having their own servers
---
person 1 finishes  
---
person 1 stops looting all together
---
person 2 can just loot quest mobs
---
feels faster even if it isn't. But it \*should\* be faster because the person who needs them is looting more
---
I really, really want more content after naxx. I've typed about it before back on announcement, but I'll outline my basic idea here again (seems like as good a place as any).
---
**TL;DR Sidegrade tiers next to naxx that have build enabling gear for the underrepresented specs in the raiding scene.**
---
Its my honest belief that if there is no content after naxx, the game will eventually languish. I'm not calling for increase in level or stat budget necessarily, though I think that expansions that do raise the cap could be done much better by not having greens invalidate your purples—but thats another topic.
---
As far as sidegrade tiers to naxx, here is my concept. Take the feral druid in raiding, and how the proper build is a consumable weapon from gnomer and a lvl 40 blue helm. This makes zero fucking sense in my opinion. While feral druids do NOT need to be brought up to rogue dps, I think that some set pieces with interesting bonuses and more intelligently assigned stats could be really interesting pieces of gear. 
---
If the tier beyond naxx took naxx level gear (at least) to even start having a chance in, along with more epic and long attunement quests that involve the specs like feral or ret etc to help give more depth to the classes, i feel like a long term endgame could develop for classic.
---
Imagine maybe 4 tiers that are all sidegrades to naxx or maybe .5 tier upgrades, and guilds could have a plethora of interesting content to attempt. Players would have cherished setpieces to strive for on specs that never had that at endgame.
---
For specs that are well established or strong, the sidegrade tiers and attunement quests could involve set pieces with bonuses that enhance different talents, or have cool active abilities that are both flavorful and effective—like a 3 second smokebomb on a ring for rogues that casts an aoe blind, but wearing it gives some disadvantage like loss or nerf of sap.
---
I'm spitballing here, but this is my personal dream I've thought about for years and years since the middle of wrath and into cata.
---
i hope someone makes a zoomer be gone addon that filters all twitch retardation
---
"Cancer to the fucking game".  Dude, he is just a guy who is popular for playing WOW and I guess people like to watch him play.  He will be on one server, he literally won't impact you at all, don't watch him and don't roll on his server, problem solved, cancer cured!
---
depends on your class and if you want to wpvp or not while leveling.
---
Go 3/3 and don't get hit...
---
I loved seeing kkkkkk and jajajajaj :)
---
It's not that bad for raiding. You 99% of the time use imp for the HP buff. You can't really play affliction in raids because of the limited debuff slots, so the gameplay is more mage like, and managing your pet gives you something to do besides just shadowbolt.
---
I mained a lock (mostly poorly) until MoP, and raided Naxx 40 before TBC came out, all as a lock. (nope, didn't get em all). The complexity you can put into the warlock is amazing, and it is what drew me to the class. Afflocks can be beastly in PvP. And it's just downright fun to watch your enemy writhe in agony till they bleed out whily you run away laughing manaically.
---
Remember how Americans whinge and bitch about 400 ms whenever they join an oceanic group or shard.
---
Well imagine having that all the time. Leeway is still necessary if there aren't physically local servers.
---
https://wondernetwork.com/pings
---
Sydney has an average 139ms ping to LA.
---
Brisbane and Melbourne have an average of 162ms.
---
Canberra has 172ms.
---
Adelaide has 186ms.
---
Perth has 197ms.
---
Still pretty torn between an UD priest and something else or a Human lock and gnome warrior. I don't really wanna play pve either
---
Of course it's still ok? Why wouldn't it be? Just as there's nothing wrong with a dedicated french server there's nothing wrong with a dedicated english server. "Flipping" it doesn't change anything in the slightest. Why would ANYONE want to play WoW with people they can't communicate with?
---
How would this even be enforced?
---
I guess if you want to sit in the queue for this server for 8 hours its fine.
---
Eh, it’s Reddit. The loud obnoxious toxic people will always froth and get other loud obnoxious toxic people to bad up with them and try to shout down anyone who wants to take a level headed approach to problems like this. Is layering perfect? No, but if it means I get classic WoW I’m gladly taking it, especially because we have 2 months remaining before they launch. 
---
A large part of these tests is to find out what is going to be the best way to implement layering, and see what its limitations are, as well as exploits. I have faith they will get it right because this is a passion project first and foremost. 
---
Thank you though, I appreciate you!
---
Just dynamically increase spawn rate of quest-monsters by how many people actively hold the quest in that zone.
---
It's not hard.
---
How would you go about contacting people on another layer? From what I can see, the only people who do are streamers with viewers that they aren't actually playing with (different layer) and only would have been able to contact them over their stream.
---
I went ahead and got a desk that changes between a sitting and standing position so I won't have to worry about sitting for too long. I always wanted one and figured this was the best time to upgrade
---
... then more people get to do them?
---
Why are people still thinking vanilla is difficult? It's time consuming and that's it.
---
If you join a ffa group for a drop/item quest the just ask “count?”.  If some is close to finishing let them finish out and leave.  I’ve been in 2 groups like this during stress tests and it worked out well both times.
---
Those facials though...
---
Night elf’s also have the coolest jump. I forget how their starting area is, last time I played one was in 2005ish.
---
Yeah
---
I lost my fucking shit when i found out they were making oldschool runescape. Classic wow in next level. I feel like a crackhead high on nostalgia looking for the next fix.
---
At this point, I think Germany and France would be happy to hear Blizzard has changed their minds and is giving them 1 server, regardless of type. But that won't happen.
---
So you support segregation because it's inconvenient to meet someone you can't understand.
---
Usually person one will leave when finished.

Turn off sticky targeting and turn on auto loot.
---
Yup 2/3 is the way to go or your coc slow won’t apply.
---
Blacksmithing also has some fun toys, but your best gear won't be crafted sadly. Alchemists are always needed to craft the higher end potions, and the pots you make leveling will help greatly, and can be a good cash resource. 
---
Nothing says you can't change professions. The game ain't goin nowhere, try what you want.
---
That’s pretty funny, very reminiscent of classic days with server instability and odd rollbacks.
---
That was ma boy High Warlord Stino 😂

Otherguy is the greatest mage in history, Otherguy basically made Vurtne(he used a lot of Otherguy 'strats'), and mages today still consider both of them the GOATs.

Are wow tokens only for BFA gold or will they have a classic price also?
---
Enhancement Shaman or Mage here.
---
Yes, found [here](http://www.warcraftrealms.com).
---
I had a castable murloc costume from blizzcon one year, you guys think that will be available in classic?
---
Hack her account and sell on the Ah for gold to support wow family
---
Blizzard will never do this, the boosts,store mounts,pets,cosmetics are all a huge revenue source. Think about it $15 a month sub then that sub purchases a mount and a cute and cuddly pixelated pet that’s another $35 on top of that sub. This isn’t even counting wow tokens. 
---
In an ideal world, yes this would be great, but it wouldn’t undo the damage to Blizzards reputation, it would only serve to improve it a bit. 
---
Once Blizzard got into bed with Activision the shady cash grab (micro transactions) started. As long as they remain connected nothing will change. The release of classic is in itself another cash grab, attempting to bring back players that
---
 A)have left the game due to not liking design direction. 
---
B) players that never got to experience classic since they were too young, or started within a later expansion.
---
C)attempting to cash in on the “nostalgia” that players have for classic. 
---
Having a 15 year old game tied to a subscription is proof enough that this is clearly a revenue boost since BFA has been bleeding funds.
---
This is what I don't understand. The people wanting to resub for classic aren't going to pay $15 for a two day play period and max level of 15. It doesn't make sense. By the time the next stress test rolls around, the sub would have already expired. They are hoping that people resub for two months to play two stress tests? The people playing retail aren't the ones that are going to flock to classic - it's the ones who haven't touched wow in years. Sure some of them will be there but I'd argue that there are a lot of us just waiting on the 27th. They want more testers but want the testers to pay. They should have just opened it up to everyone for the two days.
---
Not even to get your 10% Rank 3 discount? Yikes.
---
Good lord that music is timed so perfectly too.
---
Every hardcore guild I have seen recruiting has plans to not be on a server with any of the very big streamers, so I don't know about "good players" wanting to be on streamer servers.
---
People understand that a layer is meant to simulate a server’s worth of population, right? It’s not sharding, and this is going to happen anyway.
---
Assuming you dont work somewhere with 24/7 hours, you just have to get the late night guilds.
---
I know i have to get guilds after 10est because i do closing shifts every once i  a while.

---
Good luck when there are 5 servers in NA. Every server is a streamer server.
---
Maybe. by the time I realise that I'm on a German server it will be far too late, though.
---
I'll be behind the curve if I reroll.
---
i took a screenshot of that same damn peaceblomo like last stresstest ill upload it
---
&gt; he clarifies it on stream the difference and i agree with him on it
---
Streamers constantly accuse people of stream sniping when they lose, regardless of what game they're playing.  Besides, if someone says "I heard from a friend that [streamer] is in [location] so I'm gonna go find him" then they should be fine to go kill that streamer, right?  I constantly see streamers saying that they've heard that another streamer is in a certain place, and then go look for them.  Is it stream sniping if someone else actually sees that streamer in-game and you hear from that person where the streamer is?  Do you need to fact-check the person who told you where the streamer is to make sure they aren't watching the streamer's stream to know where they are?
---
It's too big of a convoluted mess that, as I said at the beginning, will just have streamers accusing everyone who kills them of stream sniping.
---
Yea being able to communicate with somebody in your party is stupid.
---
None of blizzards classic servers have 60s on them, can't test.
---
Feedback from people who haven't been paying attention to what layering actually is seem fairly useless.
---
So don't group with someone you can't understand.  Problem solved.  You don't need to kick them off your server.
---
Just look what servers the big guys play on and don't pick that one.
---
You can, it's called The Blacklist addon: https://redd.it/by3nd0

Back in vanilla I mained a mage and never had issues.  The snare from blizzard goes away so quick that I would not have noticed.  I used 2 blizzards, CoC, nova, 2 blizzards, oom.  3/3 blizz all the way.

Simple math, 3-4 hours a day played at roughly 5-7 days total /played means around 56 days to ding 60 at the most.

I played for about an hour and every time I managed to tag a mob just before someone else I found myself laughing manically. Twas pure joy.

melee range being bout 350 yards in this case due to leeway
---
Play whatever sounds the best/most fun to you. The only DPS class that really falls off is hunter after most other players start getting their 2.5 sets which wont be for a while, and even then hunters are still very usable just won't be the best.
---
Your argument makes no sense if you think more about situations in which you would want/need to group with strangers you dont trust. You will never grp with a stranger for a collect quest unless its a "boss"/unique mob.
---
My vanilla experience was on a german server where everyone spoke german.
---
Personally I have (apparently) no issue spending time with english speakers and conversing in that language, but for my age range and people older than me, english was never an elemental part of their lives. When I learned english some 17 years ago, the Internet was a niche thing for hardcore nerds and thusly english was way less prevalent and nobody expected it to blow up like it did. Many didn't bother to learn it well because "I'm never going to england anyways".
---
Many classic players played in their language only, only conversed with likeminded people on their language server and frankly just are not capable of surviving on an english speaking realm even today.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
I'm not affected by this personally but I think it's really shitty for the people who don't speak english well enough to enjoy this experience. This will lead to some people just plainly not playing classic and to some servers getting hijacked by some languages, leading to tons of problems with english speakers stranded on such a server.
---
It's not a great decision.
---
Except Germany and France had their own servers at launch...
---
Oh god this got me good. I am that warrior.
---
No more tauren mounts.  I demand we be forced to plainstride everywhere.
---
everyone seemed more hardcore back then.
---
Cool website. I can tell you from a decade of experience though you aren't going to get 140ms let alone 130ms to any NA Blizzard servers from Sydney.
---
Average for people to get 5 chars to 60 is 15-18 days... no joke.
---
Yassss
---
Nice bait.
---
There is virtually no difference and any discovered likely varies randomly across servers unless it is logically modified by available choices (like more raid and/or pvp friendly mechanics on one particular side).
---
The problem with the human mind is that it tends to perceives patterns where often none exists. Your perception is naturally modified by the propaganda generated by a social condition from the "us vs them" survival mechanic.
---
The only truth is: Everyone is equally paranoid.
---
I lold
---
I mean they've maxed the content thrice times over. There is only so much you can do at level 40. The burnout is real.
---
I have to agree here. Layering makes no sense to me because it doesn’t seem to make early leveling easier, the starting zones were a complete shitshow, and you can use it to abuse materials and whatnot in the open world at higher levels. Can someone explain why sharding just the starting zones (durotar, teldrasil, tirisfal, Elwynn, mulgore, and dun morough) except the main cities, is not a better option? If it’s because now the next zone will be a shitshow then shard the zones until contested zones for the first couple weeks
---
Thanks, that shit is hilarious! 
---
Modern wow blows but is still better than some mmorpgs out there - would be crazy to see some numbers on other games the past couple of months.
---
I really hope people stop acting as if Classic being released should get the treatment of a new IP or expansion... blizzard just wants to get the servers on, layering removed and let the servers play out.
---
Yes. People should be able to communicate with the people they are playing with in an MMO that revolves almost entirely around communication with other players. Communication is a core fundamental aspect of the game and Blizzard should do their best to facilitate that. You can use as much politically charged terminology as you want, it doesn't change the reality of the situation. Even people who WANT to be on servers where they don't speak the language as their main tongue are upset that there aren't language specific servers because now they can't join servers of languages they are trying to learn. There is literally no one on either side of your false dichotomy that thinks this is a good thing.
---
just the other day as a NE druid i was passing through to hinterlands and helped a lonely 32 troll warr do it. good times!

I think BFA only, otherwise that’d be a good way to gauge it

Still better than China, Korea, or Taiwan, which is your only other option.

ELI5, "layering"?

Wow, yeah I guess we won’t really be able to tell until the encoding settles down. I’m sure now that people know what they’re doing gold won’t be so much of a problem. But still a grind compared to BFA./
---
Combat's mit in solo play is no joke. Parry haste as a mechanic and reposte, with a 5% parry and 5% dodge can make a tanky combat build very effective for leveling, considering Rogue's already high base damage.
---
Merging a month old community is much more destructive than a few weeks of layering.
---
I love Pvp and Dps, I can only truly enjoy playing warrior.. we are of the same type, even though you're a tank and i'm not
---
There's nothing preventing you from communicating with people that speak your language in Classic.  You are just mad that you might encounter someone who doesn't speak it.  Welcome to the real world.  Not everyone speaks your language.

Stop baiting us I want to hear it.

Having leveled up in FF14 earlier this year, there was someone i would see sometimes who I called my "Leveling Buddy" we would always be roughly at the same point in the story asthe other person (until i took a couple month break and she got to end game and I am still in middle of last expansion)

Asia Pacific / Oceania will get their own server/s.

Man, westfall day 1 wont even be 'that' bad nearing the end of the day.  
---
How is that so many people think that it will be unplayable for more than 1-2 days?  It wasn't back in vanilla or TBC. 
---
I don't get the whole "instant gratification" need so many people have now days.  Is being patient for 1-2 days really that difficult if it means we don't need to deal with the negatives of layering?
---
Vanilla raids aren't supposed to be hard. Even over tuned private server raids aren't actually any difficult. If you're playing an MMO for super in depth mechanically complex engaging gameplay then you're probably playing the wrong genre. Classic WoW is entirely artificially difficult, that's just the kind of game it is. The difficult comes from everything taking a long time, and the enjoyment comes from the fact it's a chill game with delayed gratification. You absolutely should not be looking for a mechanically challenging experience in Classic WoW.
---
Can’t wait to not play on a streamers server :)
---
I understand the downsides of layering. But the way this is issue is discussed is frustrating and unhelpful.
---
This is a technical issue surrounding a game release that is completely foreign to this company. They are doing it because we asked them to and they listened. We need to balance what we want with a respect for their need to run a massive software system in a way is actually viable for their team. The fact that they are even doing it should be cherished. Does this mean you can't try and get things to change for the better? No. But:
---
Unless you accompany this demand with a really thorough counter proposal that takes into account the position that blizzard is in, a recognition of the downsides of your proposal from both the perspective of the player and the company, and explain why your proposal is better than their plan in light of everything, then no. This sort of thing is almost entirely unhelpful.
---
Shamans are great healers with excellent utility. They also don’t have trouble leveling!
---
It worked on pservers ... and the success of pservers is why Classic even exists.
---
The world turns and players adapt.
---
This is non-issue.
---
This is the first solution I have seen in this thread that actually would work with how the layering technology has been described.
---
Ragnaros's loot table hasn't changed in Retail, so just use those numbers. That would make it 15%.

You mean to tell me Nationwide isn't really on my side?

I dont understand the people saying the want new Vanilla content. So, you want the developer that gave us BFA to give us 1.13?
---
welcome brother!
---
It's going to be MUCH easier.
---
16 debuffs, people know what buffs are good/bad now
---
15 or so years of looking at the data and doing strategies on different raid boss's
---
addon's that are far superior (A vast majority in vanilla did not use ANY)
---
mechanics are well known
---
the process of X Y or Z raid is known
---
people know what stats/skills/talents to use, we had a few ideas, but nothing concrete
---
mobs were nerfed
---
5 mans/raids were much longer as not many knew..well..anything.
---
You’ve no idea how layering works. Things phasing in and out of your world will be incredibly rare.
---
Probably just the one
---
I like sidegrade gear, but it shouldn't be tier (as in, tier *sets*). The new pieces of gear should fill in the current gear "blanks", stuff like additional tank leather pieces, more caster mail/plate, better itemized hybrid or meme spec pieces ... 
---
all without somehow breaking the meta in pvp and pve... Yeah, if they ever do additional content (**not saying the should or shouldn't**), it'll be damn hard to balance.
---
going to 60 with instances only will take you forever... you have to walk to each and every dungeon you wanna do. after you are done you have to walk (in most cases by foot even if you have a mount) out. it will take forever.
---
Yikes lol
---
Acceptable downside?
---
What is so hard about waiting 1-2 days post release before you can move forward with little issue in a group?
---
Instant gratification isn't worth it in this case.  A little patience goes a long way, just like it did back in vanilla and even TBC launch.   The que times in vanilla were around 10-15 min before they sold the extra 500k copies without more servers up, and that wont be an issue like it was back then.   
---
What frickin mmorpg launch to date hasn't had ques on day 1?  Why does it matter that much?  Get home from work/school, que up, take a crap, get a drink, and you are likely in.
---
 I dont understand the people saying they want new Vanilla content. So, you want the developer that gave us BFA to give us 1.13?
---
&gt;created a new character on  5PM
---
&gt;was more or less unplayable, by about 6:45
---
So, will you be willing to wait almost 2 hours on launch day (or more) just to get things down to an operational level?
---
Medan existed, pretty much the same thing except you have to tack on the Guardian somewhere...
---
I'm going to be so disappointed if there are no AU servers..
---
Exactly... every mmorpg launch to date has had rough day 1's and 2's.  Why are people now acting like it will be the death of the game?
---
This is nothing more than a bunch of children whining about needing instant gratification no matter the cost, and it is sickening.
---
Kalyana gets killed. It appears that Stormwind Champion Demacia
---
Good list! Vendor prices is really good early game when you have to juggle bag space and decide what to keep. 
---
I also used a bag addon yesterday with the stress test, giving you just one big bag to open. Prefer it over sifting through 4 bags.
---
I'm still unsure if I'll use questie. It ruins a lot of the thought and problem solving/discovery from the game. I think I might use it for the initial 1-15 levels when I just want to get out of the overpopulated zones.
---
AtlasLoot was also a good addon too
---
Guess what? They didn't have those huge monitors or the amazing internet connection either so you better downgrade.

#Nochanges.

Borry to say man but they'd probably kidnap your children if you refused to pay back your mortgage.

3/3 blizzard, more efficient for getting more value from the spell. Just CoC after the slow wears off.
---
Not interested in arguing with a silly hostile person, arguing in bad faith, who doesn’t care about evidence. You’re fighting a strawman anyway because I never argued Druids are better MTs.

I never have. SEA players play on AUS servers.

---
These Warriors are triggered hard over this, damn.
---
Add Relleck#1524, I'm having trouble sending you a request for some reason.
---
There's 2 separate teams. The BFA team wouldn't make additional Classic content (assuming it ever happens).
---
I’ve noticed that alliance seem to have a lot more people willing to go priest (mostly dwarf) and also paladins that will heal. Horde seems to have less support, a lot of people going for dps and tank.
---
I live across the county line from a small town of 12,000-ish out in the middle of corn fields. 1Gb is an option...
---
3/3 is leaps and bounds better. When used correctly with 2/2 arctic reach it means that you can get 3 blizzards in per nova if you go max range.
---
If you don't go max range you still get 2 VERY efficient blizzards- and by efficient I mean most of the mobs stay in all of the blizzards ticks of damage.
---
The BIGGEST factor in difficult in AOE farming is your mana pool and blizzard is your most efficient spell for damage in AOE- the math is therefore easy:
---
So 3/3 Blizzard makes your blizzard more efficient because the mobs are slowed more- given that you should typically only be using cone of cold to slow mobs that have resisted a nova or to finish off a pack of grouped mobs that are low HP, the inability to replace the blizzard slow is meaningless because you can just wait for it to fall off.
---
Yeah probably. A lot of people played asia (jpn maybe?) when sc2 came out but I think most people decided it wasn't really any better than US. For interest here my pings from Sydney to Blizzard [assuming these ips are accurate](https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/7870)

Everyone totes this advice like the coc slow matters at all.
---
Immediately after you coc you nova anyway, and 3/3 Blizzard is absolutely monstrous in terms of slow.
---
I can't wait to start playing on a server only to find out (Around level 30-40) that It's the inofficial Spanish or French server.
---
More disappointed than playing on an AU server for 2 months and then finding out there's only enough players for a couple raiding guilds on each faction?
---
With questing you can teleport all over the world.
---
I remember setting loot to FFA most of the time out in the world just because if you had people who didn't check corpses then nobody could loot it.
---
Kids in bed = Video Game time. That's how I do it. It's true, mine's 7 and they grow so fast. I'd hate to have them be 14 and I spent it all min-maxing my wow character.

That being said I'm pretty sure his comment is more of a exaggeration/joke.
---
Did you see Hakurai's video that was posted here?
---
[Somewhere in here he shows that, at least for a specific level range, the xp/hr observed on beta players doing the dungeon grind is comparable or even better than questing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9frydWyhL8)
---
I didn't go slow, I kinda went all at once lol
---
Right, and who made the BFA team? Blizzard. Who would make the 1.13 team? The same current Blizzard.
---
If only people would actually think about these issues when they are announced rather than months later.  Yall missed the boat on layering, its in.  And you missed the boat on the nerfed world, its here.
---
If the people who speak my language aren't on my server I'm literally being prevented from communicating with them. But yes, either way I'd be annoyed if I encountered someone who I needed to communicate with but couldn't. Why wouldn't that be annoying? Especially if you can mitigate the problem. What would do you live in where being incapable of communicating with someone isn't problematic? Lack of communication is arguably the root of all human strife.
---
That last sentence is why this sub has its reputation outside of it as being a dumpster for wow forums.
---
Horde are more likely to be angry assholes, where as alliance tend to be more of the douchebag asshole stereotype.
---
I had a tauren that was exalted with org before I hit 60 in vanilla. I didn't like kodos so I made sure I did every single quest I could to get max org rep so I could buy a wolf at 60.
---
Horde for sure
---
Well the plaguelands are close to the wind elemental guy...

Eh in my opinion pservers were a lot more toxic and less immersive as well. At least now if i'm being ignored by someone I know it's not because they don't understand me

I guess Blizzard was right at the end of the day though.  So many people are so frickin impatient now days, and they realize this.  How in the world is the game being bogged down for 1-3 days really that big a deal in the grand scheme of things?  Did any mmorpg die due to a bad/rough launch?  Absolutely not.
---
Yeah what even is there to justify?
---
Pick up skinning, kill cats in STV and Swamp of Sorrows until 40, profit.  👍
---
My friend and I have specifically decided to NOT go on a streamer server.
---
However, this was patched in 1.9, so given Classic's 1.12 ethos I doubt we'll see the return of Lupos on live.
---
Curious where you got that data
---
2 raids of 30 players. 20 mains, 10 alts. The gear gets funneled to mains, making the 40 mains get stacked gear.
---
Don't think it's technically possible
---
Yeah that kinda sounds like it has truth in it, that dimension of "you think you do" i didnt really look into much. To me it sounded condescending, but yeah maybe alot of changes we did actually bring upon to ourselves.   
---
Still there is alot that players never asked for. I think for instance, they very clearly chose this Battlepass-season style of gameplay with through the roof catchup mechanics + generally dumbing down everything. to draw in a broader audience. losing many in the proces.  
---
That activision aura around Mr Brack tho.. Its so obvious that he's become a puppet of theirs. The way he kept defending going mobile after blizzcon. Even the interview he gave a few weeks ago where he slightly backpedaled could be translated to "We still have a hard on for China and mobile, but maybe we should've not been so honest and obvious about it, especially during blizzcon". How about not shoving acticrap down my throat and be pika-suprised that i dont like it.
---
Mod purge please
---
Blizzard isn't going to guarantee that players understand you.  Should they have a server for Greek?  What about Polish?
---
Ok, so now you have a Polish server.  Oh wait, you wanted PVP and they made a PVE one.  I guess they should make 3 servers; PVP, PVE and RP, for Polish speakers.
---
What's that?  There are only five people on your server, and three of them are the other faction?  Oh, that's too bad.  Well at least you can understand them.
---
Yeah Venruki is a really good pro player but that play here wasn't good. He would've gotten punished for his missplay, windfury proc or not.
---
That is a huge understatement.  I don't think I've ever played a game/mmorpg that has ever had a class as gear dependent as warriors are in WoW.
---
Guardian Maiev Fordring, the Earth Warder
---
I don't think that is the case. You the idea is not that you do the dungeon once and then find a new group. The idea is that you run the same dungeon repeatedly. The time to run from the deadmines exit to the entrance can only be a couple minutes. Blackfathom deeps has a teleporter to the entrance. It's not going to be a huge issue, bag space will likely be the limiting factor, because you certainly hope to clear a dungeon before your hearthstone is off cooldown.
---
Let’s build a wall and make the streamers pay for it.
---
You're scaring me off of rolling druid :( I know feral won't stack up to the warrior and rogue counterparts, but I just want it to be viable.
---
They really need to stop locking the threads. There is nowhere to discuss this. Europeans wamtimg to speak their own lamguage in a game osnt about bigotry, it's about community. And yes, a large part of europeans particularily in the south don't speak english well. Others just don't like to do it and why should they be forced to?
---
I'm saying this as someone who speaks english fluently and prefers english communities even if it isn't my first language. It's going to be chaos and no one is looking forward to that.
---
I did try them - no response. Same thing from OW/D3 servers listed from asia as well.
---
&gt;  A lot of people played asia (jpn maybe?)
---
There's no Japanese server since Japanese people don't really do PC gaming (aside from VNs). China usually has a separate client entirely, so you're probably thinking of KR?
---
agreed. while i do perceive a difference in personalities, its exactly that - just a perception. until of course, there is a scientific approach to it.
---
Ah, another poor, naive fan who actually believes what devs say
---
Quite the Catch-22 since I'm not fucking paying for a subscription just to sit around hoping they'll invite me in.
---
Tauren make the sexiest warriors and the 5% health racial makes it an easy choice imo
---
Gotcha, np. If only pve is a factor than yea, ud ain't the best for sure.
---
I remember being able to deadzone warriors pretty reliably back in the day. On classic you have like 1yd to play with, if that. Something definitely feels off.
---
Sacrifices have to be made
---
Meni yli hilseen näköjään.
---
To everyone saying yes: Does this mean we could do prenerf C’thun
---
Yeah I would rather deal with a bit of lag for the first week or two while all the people who will hate classic quit than have too many servers at launch. I was on a fairly shit server in vanilla/tbc where even the best of the best was only like top 500 global guild. :(  I'd like to get a good server this time around. (preferably one that no popular streamers are on but I doubt that'll be realistic)
---
Not too far off and I'm already done. SPreadsheets are ezpz
---
/gkick
---
I don't want *YOU* in my guild!
---
Because the roadmap they had planned for vanilla was fucking massive and I loved the concept and difficulty of parts of BC and to a lesser extent Wrath. 
---
I totally get your concern about BFA devs.
---
i don't see how you get teleporting ability through questing.
---
No, you're wrong.
---
Blizzard just doesn't care about lying.  They will have 6 servers, you're right.  They will just have 100 layers per server.  And never remove them, regardless of what they promised.
---
Yeah I think one of them is going mining as well, so best not to overlap there either. Prob just gonna run skinning to make some extra gold while leveling I think. Build looks pretty solid, was thinking of something like that in the end.
---
That is a low IQ take.  He became famous because others enjoy his content.  I have personally followed him for 3 weeks now.  I enjoy his react videos much more than his content on twitch.  It is all personal.
---
This being said, I will try with all effort to avoid the server he rolls on.
---
I flew in ON A HIPPOGRIFF
---
Hi, /u/Hankee_
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c357nl/what_is_layering/). 
---
This guy can rationalize.
---
hmm if only developer with access to code and programmers could do something about it https://gfycat.com/sourimmaculatecob
---
Usually there are couple or more other quests after, so it makes no difference. Just communicate "how many you have/missing?", "what other quests you have". Finding a partner is too good to do that type of move. That being said, there are all sorts of people out there. PvP, Pve, RP.
---
Forgetting to add in additional latency from going through blizzards servers.
---
But yea anything under 250ms is fine in classic.
---
This. They will not remove layering ever.
---
the developers of Vanilla would have gave us BFA anyway, the game was new and they were exploring unchartered territory with every initially well-received innovation they made.
---
with all of the lessons they've learned after 15 years, i can't wait to see what they can come up with - and i trust they won't make the same mistakes. in fact, i'm counting on them making brand new mistakes
---
1st of all ofc they will remove it in phase 2 because of the world bosses.. it ion said it. And about that "solution", this will just create more problems.. this way will be much easier to change between servers so you can gather wtv the fk you want
---
This is actually what I was wondering. I leveled up to 9 with a hunter on the stress test and was curious on just how shitty they actually become compared to the best classes in both pvp and pve?
---
Is perdition's blade in phase 1 moltencore? How are the dagger drops working?
---
I cant decide between undead warrior and lock. I havent played lock before. So leaning slightly towards lock. My question is can I beat warriors and rogues in duels at 60 with a lock ? Or do they hard counter me.
---
Seriously. This makes me feel old.
---
the jokes gone, you missed it.
---
hmm I played both, I think horde only during BC though. I like the alliance zones and questing more
---
How did you miss StaySafe at #4, Swifty at #5, and MadSeasonShow at #9?
---
Started in Wrath playing on my dad’s shitty Vista computer, now we got 4k with two 1080ps on the side with a 1080 and a 6700k, full res old wow looks weird to me
---
You do you. I watched a lot of YouTube classic leveling guides for classes I will never play..
---
What mic is that? Looks like a Shure SM7B.
---
Also, "leeway".
---
New headphones, new mic, needing a new mouse before aswell.
---
You're acting as if Blizzard themselves didn't already set precedent for which languages are populated enough to warrant their own servers. It's fair to say that Classic simply won't be active enough to justify language specific servers, but the root of your argument had absolutely nothing to do with that and was implying that wanting to be able to communicate with people was somehow racist, which is absolutely ridiculous.
---
It won't be a vanilla experience, because people will just cry and report each other. sjw blizz will ban all
---
I’m 45 and I enjoy his stream. Now, I find it amusing how everyone gives him stuff, but hey..whatever..it’s theirs to give. And I certainly don’t plan on joining his following in game; I’d rather hunt him down..O O G A.
---
Numbers don’t lie. He’s the most popular for a reason. Many people either don’t understand or are incapable of grasping sarcasm. But once you realize that 99% of what he does is for the camera and is sarcastic in nature, you begin to understand why he’s so popular. 
---
Why is he so popular? Because, if you notice, there’s never a dull moment. He can talk for 8 hours straight and be entertaining the entire time. It’s incredible. And it’s a gift. I dare anyone else to try it. And just the sheer stupidity of some of the humor...”literal god...*miss*..great..I love this game”. Cracks me up every time because it comes out of nowhere. I suspect those that dislike him either don’t get the humor or are jealous of someone who makes a million plus for playing a video game. And, again, it’s so much more than playing a video game. It’s being entertaining for 8 hours straight without a break. 
---
Anyhow, downvote, upvote..I don’t particularly care. Just wanted to add my opinion. 
---
Look forward to seeing you in classic Asmond. O O G A!
---
honestly, i could see it happening.
---
but the reason theyre doing mixed EU servers in the first place isnt the reason theyve given in the statement, and that is a HUGE communication fail (blizzard again). NOBODY believes their 'freedom' reasoning, they simply dont want to admit that they dont see the playerbase as sufficient for language-specific realms.
---
Its just fucking sad how we always have to read between lines of statements coming from blizzard these days. The initial trust is just gone.
---
Well, they're AT&amp;T servers, not Blizzard's but yeah. You can check yourself by opening CMD Prompt and typing "ping 137.221.105.2".
---
Personal experience from doing it 10+ times in vanilla.
---
Lol, if think it's overly politically correct or whatever, that's a fair point to make. But don't sit there with your thumb up your ass pretending not to understand.
---
O
---
I leveled as a 5man in TBC. we made good time and could do the dungeons qests etc no prob. His video does raise good points. 
---
If you're going to do it you findout who's available of the right classes and you play together at all the same time, in TBC we all took a week off work and we played from 1am to about 7pm each day. we slept during prime-time. SIMPLE
---
Count how many people are in that picture. A group holds 5. There's your answer.
---
IS an sm7...overkill mic for game chat, really
---
I played maplestory on a singapore server for several years and wow on an oceanic server. They still worled on one or at the most two common languages. EU servers are going to struggle with dozens of different languages. You can't form a cohesive community with people who can't comnunicate with each other. 
---
The one thing has nothing to do with the other.
---
(Funny)
---
its stress test for about 15 more hours
---
No gaming company on the planet would ever admit this, no matter how much player trust they have.
---
I grouped with a warrior for an item drop quest(I'm a hunter). He set it to FFA, got 12/12 while I was at 2/12, said "thanks for group, I've got to log off"...
---
See him 10 mins later still questing. That SoaB!
---
thanks. good thing i didnt sub
---
We've been pampered by all the people to avoid being tagged by -Ragnaros on retail
---
Yeah this is what I'm talking about. I'm just wondering if it'd be beneficial to have a regular LFG post for 5-man grouping to organize groups up before the launch, or if just winging it in game and finding people that way will be sufficient.
---
Just a FYI - The big posts going on now is that it was Druid bear form that was overtuned, not that classic had a low DPS bug.
---
Playing the stress test, it's boring as hell to stand around and watch 10 other people kill mobs as soon as they spawn. Not fun at all.
---
200ms is pretty terrible for pvp. The thing is even if we (oce) get our own server we will inevitable get put in NA battlegroups for BGs, so for the content where ping matters we will have na ping anyway.   
---
Blizzard might have even decided changing between 5ms and 200ms all the time would actually be a worse experience than just always playing with 200.
---
Depends on the server I suppose. Whether or not coalitions form, whether or not your guild is in that coalition. You'll almost certainly be able to kill the bosses and compete for them at some point, but there's really no way to say whether your guild, let alone you personally, will get loot from them.
---
They chose a time that was beneficial to their lives, but then complained it did not produce the results they had hoped for.  They could have had the results they wanted by shifting their work hours for a week or just a couple people for a couple days.  Just seems, very lazy.  So maybe the though here is, "Don't bitch when you take the lazy route?"
---
If your account is flagged for Beta access, then it doesn't require a subscription. Just try to access the servers. But the only invites that went out like that were for marketing purposes (streamers) and Friends &amp; Family of Blizzard.
---
i was under the impression locks could beat anything 1v1? am i wrong?
---
Gnome warrior if you’re leaning alliance and PvP then. Escape artist is great plus gnome warriors look badass with big ol 2 handers
---
Btw ppl like you make me crave wow. And not the bs retail wow that’s out today I mean “real” wow where very rules apply aka classic. You think I’m shy? Since when is posting on reddit “shy”? I played on the stress test and I was in elwyn forest as a lvl 2 troll so I couldn’t ask my question in general BECAUSE NO ONE WAS THERE BUT ME. I can’t wait to rape the corpses of edgelords like you. You won’t have ears or a tongue and you will walk the afterlife in shame. Bring it on baby back bitch. I’ll show you shy with my dagger down your back and my dick down your throat hahahahaha
---
Lol 30,000 people in the last 30 days sure, but I know for a fact every Aussie who wants to play classic hasn't logged into retail for ages we've already got a guild in our friends group and non of them play retail we've got 40 people waiting for classic the numbers might double or tripple for OCE.
---
Well i played with people ive known for years, not el randoms, i dont think you want to spend that long with people you dont really know or get along with.
---
Hi friend, oceanic includes new zealand, and a lot of south east asia, I think your numbers could use some adjusting
---
i mean the video makes it quite clear. if the number on beta are as they will be on live instance grinding will be faster IF you have 5 (or 4 other) people who are exactly on your schedule. 
---
personally i think questing/grinding will be faster since you only have to cope with downtime caused by yourself.
---
i see however the argument for instance grinding on pvp server or as a streamer.
---
If they can phase zones they can layer them.
---
He's not talking about bugs. He's talking about design issues.
---
It's more personal preference at 60, but I suggest 3/3 while leveling just because Blizzard will end uo doing more damage. At 60 when you have clearcasting in your AoE build I prefer 2/3 because CoC is so important in my rotation.
---
I want to find groups/guilds easy and don't mind healing but also want to be able to DPS in solo PvP and heal in group PvP.  Would paladin be the best choice?
---
I remember running sm a lot on private server and I would always try and get 2 rogues and a shaman for wf totem. Nothing beats that dps
---
the game is being made by people that actually played vanilla, unlike you..
---
The numbers include every person that logged into an Oceanic realm, which are all hosted in Sydney.
---
&gt;You expect entire systems to get overhauled in 2 months right? You have no idea how game-development and developmental cycles work, do you now?
---
If only they still had the integrity to release games when they're done, and not to meet some arbitrary deadline..
---
Yeah, I remember even after this revamp a druid in my guild pleaded "why not have at least just one for the Leader of the Pack buff and one moonkin for a caster group buff" and he was dismissed out of hand.
---
If that's the case why do we have sharding/layering and zerg AV and no original epic mounts?
---
I do remember this, i was always able to auto attack people well before i could use a skill, i also had to run infront of a players model to attack them but that was because i had terrible latency.
---
Yes the competition will die down. When naxx is out no one is going to care much about world bosses. If your guild can clear AQ20/ZG I don't think you'll have any trouble with the world bosses in phase 5/6.
---
It doesn't bode well for anyone. Odds are that there will be VERY few servers, they will be extremely overpopulated, and layering will linger way longer than most expect.
---
Except having no changes would mean having different language servers?
---
Yes, but there's no reason to suspect there aren't just as many Germans not playing Retail and waiting for Classic as there are Australians doing the same. And they're not getting a server.
---
it's all just words. what do they even mean anyway?!
---
Thank god I live in OCE
---
That's where I'm stuck. I really would prefer to do the dungeon grind but I don't know ANYBODY who is going to be putting in the time that I will be for the first week. That's why I was hoping to get the conversation going to possibly getting something set up to find other people in a similar situation to build groups before launch to be ready. =/
---
Not huge ones, yeah, but the reasoning for mixed EU servers theyve given isnt even well thought out, its pathethic.
---
meanwhile you have GGGs CEO Chris Wilson directly talking to the community as honest as they can. GGG is an excellent example of community trust and the reason why their MTX monetization model works so good (simply put: people WANT to support the company)
---
Give this a read, its truly exceptional for businesses in these days imo:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/bjmndc/an_update_from_chris/
---
Nah.
---
Yeah. So is my MXL990. But it sounds good in Discord. Or so I'm told.
---
All this and people forget one thing, they have already said it won't be used longer than the first month and for sure won't be past the first phase (phases 2 is kazak and dragons).  If this is too much for people to handle maybe they should wait a month till till big bad layering is gone.
---
Very few servers, yes. Overpopulated, not necessarily. Layering lasting longer than Phase 1? Not a chance. Worst case is they make more servers and offer free realm transfers.
---
Tbh i hate both systems but i do want to be able to play at launch so they need to do somthing either way
---
You just know streamers will still stream on that server as stealth classes because playing on the anti-streamer server will get more views.
---
Skeptical how it would increase the time of leveling by 3 fold. I know you receive 35% of the xp as solo but you kill incredibly faster, and can solo everything / pull much bigger. And having a healing with a warrior, windfury bot shaman too would be huge for your speed.
---
People don't hate streamers per se, they hate the passive affects that accompany them. Their fanboys are the topic of this post
---
plenty of time to find a guild. if you plan to play that hardcore, there should be plenty out there, make some friends. do you plan to raid?
---
Stuff like that is fine when you own your studio and don't answer to a board that owns tons of different studios making different games that then answers to public shareholders.
---
It is! I record music so it doubles as a glorified teamspeak mic. Hahahah.
---
Hold on a damn minute. Are you Australian? Or in the Oceanic region?
---
We already have the infrastructure here to support Classic WoW Oceanic servers as we currently have Retail servers for our region.
---
Blizzard spent a crap load on our servers, it would be almost ridiculous if they didn't do it.
---
Mind blown at how crazy people are going over the servers.
---
15?! What kind of God tier dsl do you have? I pay for 10/1 and get on average 5/0.5. I'm glad that wow classic is late August cause kids go back to school sept and my internet is more stable when the whole towns kids are at school.
---
Stealth classes don't help them at all if they're streaming.
---
I've played Classic back then, I've played it on Nost and ranked to 14. I am very well aware of what issues it can and will bring.
---
You're saying farms like Devilsaur and Black Lotus will be uncontested, what the hell?
---
Sharding &amp; Layering DOES NOT EQUAL to DEAD ZONES on Retail with Cross realm!
---
Layering is PLANNED to have up to 3000 Players each Layer. Of course you will have competition for Devilsaur &amp; Black Lotus and all the other stuff. Why do you even think there wouldn't be? That just tells me that you have not much experience with Classic WoW.
---
There won't be zone hopping to dead layers as you think, it is NOT like crossrealm on retail where zones are literally empty because their servers are actually empty as well.
---
Also it doesn't matter if a group of people farms Devilsaur in the beginning for every single beginning. Even if they list them for 500g per Item, the Gold doesn't generate by selling it, it generates by players playing the game. That won't just feed 100% epic mounts instantly to a whole guild, it costs 1000g without discounts mate.
---
Black Lotus is on a 1 hour respawn, in 4 zones. 4 Black Lotus per Hour dude. 4 Black Lotus per Hour multiplied by the amount of Layers, let's assume 5. Thats 20 Lotus an Hour for the WHOLE server. No guild will have that much Gold to spend at the beginning, especially not with your idea of them having epic mounts instantly as well, what the hell dude.
---
Literally 90% of your Post is made up and completly stupid as none of it will happen like that.
---
We all hate both systems. But claiming that anyone who is against layering is ignorant is simply not factual.
---
Lowkey that looks cool af. Lich king helm with wings and glaives. Nut.
---
And Baldmongold, I guess he was off.
---
Stop using that first link like it's proof of something, he shows literally nothing
---
That's the goal. I would like to lead a semi-hardcore guild, I have a bit of experience in leadership IRL and was an officer my entire time in retail WoW (vanilla &amp; TBC).
---
Honestly what I really want to do is to set up a guild for new but not incapable players to learn the game with. I want to be 60 early to be able to help said new players progress to raid content.
---
I didn't notice that there was a "players looking for players" tab in the LFG monday though. I'll start posting on there weekly until I find a suitable group of people to join. :D
---
I'll put my hand up and say I get 155ms - 160ms to servers on the West Coast from Canberra.
---
Shut the fuck up nerd
---
Find out which server they are on and avoid them. Fuck
---
servers in sydney we will get servers. i trust in my lord and savior chinglish
---
&gt;Implying 138ms ping is bad, especially in a tab-target MMORPG
---
I guess you must be one of those people who think anything below 120 FPS is literally unplayable.
---
no i got the "joke". implying that questing would give you the ability not to have to walk to the next quest... very funny. it shows your limited understanding of the game though. look up joanas guide for "maximizing xp/hr while walking" etc... "downtime" during questing is only as "down" as you let it be.
---
And that's great! While cool stuff happens at endgame, this game is so wide that you'll get that shiny new feeling for years to come.
---
I Agree, but Chris doesnt own GGG anymore, they sold out to Tencent last year, which is why this is so rare but so goooood.
---
Check the current frontpage link on leeway mechanics.
---
&gt; BFA is a lot more dead than people think.
---
Because the sharding/phasing/whatever-you-want-to-call-it keeps the cities and zones populated. So the players don't perceive that the number of people logged in has changed much.
---
I never implied 138ms is bad.
---
There was a huge post about how leeway like this wasnt in the game till MoP. How, using video evidence of vanilla, people werent experiencing the same leeway classic is showing and that this needs to be changed because it's not vanilla-like.
---
That's literally what you said ?
---
&gt;no1 fully understands the need for layering and due to their ignorance they wont even bother to consider it
---
Added you on discord :)
---
Easy solution, force all 30+ and their party members onto the 30+  layer
---
*Laughs in private servers.*
---
5000$+ on eBay.
---
It will still be fairly difficult when we get to AQ + and even some of BWL. MC and Ony will be a breeze I’m sure. If blizz needed to buff a raid because it was way too easy I honestly don’t think they’d hesitate - but it would have to be WAY too easy.
---
There’s probably good reason it wasn’t released. It probably was not good.
---
Oh so you do understand how this is going to turn out. Your post gave me the same warm feeling I know I have to look forward to in classic.
---
Take your virtue signaling elsewhere and try to attend to reality more often.
---
It also seems to piss them off if you mistake it for Spanish...
---
Ok so... I'm a horde player now. Hoping soda goes alliance for his buddies.
---
This won't happen. Devilsaur Mafia is a Privateserver thing. At most one or two Servers would probably have one, but not every single Server.
---
And even if the very extreme but also highly unlikely situation happens, that every server has such a Mafia, then there'd be other Mafia Groups as well that give them enough competition, for it to not be worth it at all.
---
You're all way too deep set into the Privateserver mindset with 1-2 Big servers and nothing else.
---
That's amazing
---
I wouldn't let this deter you. You talked about healing others just to do so. Well, paladins get special buffs they can cast on others. You get a wide assortment, but that means that you can choose the best buff to help that person.
---
You'll struggle with solo play, but most folks will be happy to have you join.
---
&gt; When you walk past a French guy in the store and hear him in French, do you scream at him, "English, motherfucker! Do you speak it?" Of course not.
---
What a retarded comparison.
---
WoW isn't a store where other players are just backdrop at best, inconvenience at worst. Sooner or later you'll have to work together with others, at which point yes, *being able to understand what the hell they're saying* is pretty fucking important.
---
Like sharding but you only move to a new one when you join a group.
---
28 wife 2 kids both toddlers still hyped as hell for classic the boys and I are pulling all nighters and using pto.
---
dude could also say "authentic" to a crowd of pserver folk.
---
No changes boys,  naw we're adding layering just to remind you to behave, or we will burn this shit to the ground - blizzard
---
I know, right? I hate being slightly inconvenienced too. Everyone knows WoW isn't really a game about interacting with people in a persistent world. That's old fashioned thinking. It's a game about making numbers go up and getting as many dopamine hits as you can.
---
Eh, dynamic respawns causes issues. You could clear an area to work towards an item, but dynamic respawns could respawn mobs so fast you have to reclear either after you're done or even in the middle of your clear.
---
If players, such as Mages, got high enough to start AOE farming, dynamic respawns could respawn their little area so quickly and they'd have such a huge advantage on the economy early on.
---
I also think dynamic respawns would give people more reason to keep questing solo instead of grouping up with other players because mobs or items would respawn so fast, you don't need a group to control the mobs you kill, they'll all respawn so fast everybody will get a chance very quickly.
---
Dynamic respawns = bad idea.
---
And all it gives is enchanting mats I won't use instead of money that I will use.
---
Basically the server can create multiple versions of the same area to prevent overpopulation of a specific zone.
---
Technically speaking an RPG cannot be difficult by design, so I don't know what you were expecting.
---
Difficulty in vanilla raids always came from having to grind gear tier by tier, and that will not change.
---
Then go do something else, holy shit.
---
Is the melee range leeway going to affect aoe farming?
---
While they may not get a German language server, they are still much closer to the EU based servers than AU/NZ connecting to US.
---
You will have 30 days. Get on it.
---
"You don't like layering just because you're too ignorant to understand it"  
---
Pretty ironic when you are actually the one that's too ignorant to understand that people that don't like layering just *don't like it outside of starting zones only*.  
---
I've never seen anyone just saying no to layering, period. It's always "I understand why layering is necessary for starting zones, but I wish it wouldn't be continent-wide".  
---
Also, dude, if you're gonna call people ignorant, at least make the effort of using punctuation and not making spelling mistakes.
---
Do you not know you can sell the enchanting mats to other players?
---
Yeah but who's gonna buy enchanting mats on a server release?
---
I’d literally rather wait in queue to log in. It’s part of the fun and anticipation. I’ve been doing it for years. If it means my kill doesn’t vanish to some bull shit layering system or a mage who is abusing the layering to gigafarm can’t do that then yes it’s with it to wait to login and get this shit removed or fixed.
---
I think people are just forgetting how things were.  Mobs always had massive melee range while chasing you, including in Vanilla.  I remember plenty of times where I got dazed by some mob like 10-15 yards behind me.
---
You should still be able to do all the kiting tricks from Vanilla because your character also has extended melee range while moving.  So maybe the distances look a little different now because player/server latency/ping is generally lower, but kiting should still work as long as you get into the melee range limit of the mob and dip in and out of it to get hits in.
---
The melee attack range of mobs was not changed in Pandaria as far as I know.
---
Exactly. I like streamers. I hate streamer fanboys.
---
No.  ELI5, "sharding"?
---
Sure, but the distance isn't enough for AU/NZ players to be at any perceivable disadvantage on an NA server with modern connection speeds.
---
&gt; I really, really want more content after naxx.
---
I really, really want them to balance and fix existing content rather than adding more raids where every class has one viable spec.
---
Varimathras looks very small. He was way larger than what he currently is in the Undercity.
---
Lol wtf this isn't 2009 anymore. You see a dramatic drop in quality on reddit when school goes on holiday.
---
Retail does. Classic doesn't.
---
I don't think you understand. From the valley of trails to Orgrimmar there was literally nothing to kill. Every spawn was being camped at certain points of the stress test. 
---
Turn the layering on for the first 2 months, then turn it off, but for love the god at least have it on for release.
---
Yeah i have 2 world record titles for powerleveling, think i know a thing or 2 thanks.
---
1. There are only 3 clips that are not mine, I spammed Venruki and Monkeynews's twitch until they saw my messages and granted permission to use their VoDs. I agree I should have credited them for the three clips, I can change that. 
---
2. I compared XP/Hour from the worst Dungeon group to my own 1-60 recording (5d on a warrior), and Joana's 1-60 original recording (4d 20h on a Hunter), but new hunter routes that've been popping up recently are obviously faster. I'm a warrior and most of my content naturally focuses around warriors, so of course thats what I base it off of, but the projected time to 60 is faster for any class that doesn't break 4d /played.
---
3. I was being inclusive with the group compositions, to include all specs, not recommending one over the other. As for priest over paladin I recommend you look at the Priest's Spirit Tap talent - it can be kept up 100% of the time giving them double spirit and 65% mana regen while casting, meaning they don't need to stop at all - they are vastly superior to holy paladins and all other healers for this reason alone. At no point would you ever want the priest using holy nova, that's a huge waste of mana. Paladins and other classes can provide their buffs perfectly fine in other roles such as ret or prot.
---
4. Mage's AoE grind in a spellcleave group is faster than solo questing/open world AoE grinding if done properly. The only thing I haven't been able to compare it with are hunters claiming to get to 60 sub 4days /played, but every other class that averages longer /played to 60 will benefit from this. I'm not going to upload 40h+ of recordings to show where my XP/hour numbers are coming from, but if you are keep on calling my research bad you should at least back it up by disproving me - try looking up VoDs of the streamers who leveled through dungeon grinding and you'll find even in the inefficient groups their XP/Hour was coming out ahead of efficient questing paths.
---
As for the power spikes being the focal point of the comparison - there's power spikes in every single level bracket, nearly all the dungeons I mention provide significant gear upgrades that keep this method of leveling relevant.
---
Based on the tone of your post it feels like you are just looking for things to disagree with because you don't seem to believe 5man leveling can be faster? Then perhaps that way just isn't for you and you can stick with your preferred method.
---
Every guild pushing for a week one ragnaros kill...

There was a post claiming that leeway wasnt added till near the start of MoP. With video evidence of vanilla not showing the leeway. I also played vanilla as a majority of my wow experience and never had this leeway. Melee was easily kitable.
---
gotcha -
---
Suomalaisille omat serverit!
---
Basically a server can have multiple versions of the same area so everyone isn't all crowded.
---
Crafting prefessions are a huuuge gold sink whilst leveling. I wouldn't recommend it if you want to have the gold for your mount by 40. Pally or lock might be able to manage it due to their free mount at 40 though.
---
I played on crushridge for the length of vanilla&gt;wrath and didn’t notice that.
---
Orig got deleted: 
---
Actually server capacity is one of the things thats not really debatable. There are clear and distinct problems with raising the server cap as seen by places like [private servers]
---
If they want to keep the small things #nochanges, they wont be increasing the server sizes (apart from layering - which will eventually have a server cap after removal)
---
heres a link to a discussion that was had, you can read or listen.

/r/classicwow/comments/b6tmgx/we_need_to_talk_about_server_caps/

It's a game about getting forgettable loot and making numbers go up and running dungeons without ever speaking to a single person, right? That's what everyone seems to want.
---
Even as zoomer as Reddit is compared to traditional forums, it's still too boomer for the zoomers who can only communicate in real time chat or audio.

Or so I feel.

While I don't mind if they change the leeway mechanic, it has to be said that people overestimate how much the internet itself has changed. While download speeds have increased a lot over the years, latency hasn't really. We're talking about 2005 here, not 1995. Dial-up was *not* the norm anymore in 2005, internet speed only really mattered a lot for gaming if you were loading into a capital city or something like that. Internet speed is not the thing that determines whether or not leeway has a place in Classic. The game was just designed that way because it was made by people who were sick of how awful melee hit detection was in Everquest.
---
I made tons of iron man alts to level back in the day.  Made more bnet friends during those years than any other. I thought cata was when things got too easy.  Never made any friends leveling after that to this day.  
---
On retail too many people want to just be at end level with dozen plus alts.  Even end level isn't enough that devs catch everyone up to play the patch.   They complain about anything taking more than a couple globals to kill.
---
Outside of raiding and m+ which I don't do, there's just no reason to group up for anything, and as a result haven't added a bnet friend since before Legion.  And yet still talk to a friend I met in BC brewfest back when you had to actually travel to BRM.
---
Ah yes, that C L A S S I C feel we've all been asking for.

You show me yours ill show you mine.
---
Not gonna lie, I saw someone with a zergling and did have a moment of "oh god please no" and hit shift+P to make sure that shit wasn't in the game before remembering the collectors edition.
---
If you have 5 people in the party, you should be able to pull 3-4 elite mobs or 6-9 regular mobs(give or take due to distance/mobs running back) with ease. You think thats good? Hell no.
---
Say you kill 6-9 regular mobs per pull AND if you are lucky, uncontested area AND mobs do not constantly run away from being leashed. You still need to worry about if the mobs decent xp or not.
---
Level 40 for example needs 90700 or so xp @ 245 xp. 
---
 90700/245 = 370 mobs of equal level...
---
now, 35% of that is 130. You still need 240 to go.
---
You still have the variation of differences of mobs with a lot less xp with mobs being 2 levels lower or 110% xp gain if the mobs 2 levels above you.
---
Now..its not so much the grinding, its getting the gear you need to use to grind(whether its straight up grinding/questing/dungeons). A lot of time will be downtime with upgrading gear through drops/crafting/ah and figuring out 'how the hell do I kill the boss without leveling up 2-3 more times?'.
---
If you are 5 boxing, try and avoid collector quests, strictly do dungeon/dungeon quests/grinding quests unless you know the gathering quest is easy/quick...or expect a lot of alt tabbing.
---
It averages 10/.5, unfortunately.
---
I started a group last night for a collection quest.  I immediately set it for free for all so we didn't have to run all over to loot, yes we got one person who got there's and bailed but the rest of us stuck it out till we all had finished. And then went on to other quests.  That's the thing with classic,  because of how the community works, if your the one that is only out for himself then people start to catch on and you stop getting invited to stuff.
---
I'm not saying it wasn't working as intended, more that it was the cherry of extreme OPness on the top of an already un-Blizzlike level of OPness on top of already being the best levelling class and spec in the game.
---
That's why you level prot while watching anime. Just afk and check back every 5 min to dump your rage.

there are videos of it on youtube https://youtu.be/eGeb0EYMWAE?t=10  
---
It was definitely different from what we got in tbc... Everything was larger, more spacious, it had different darker textures... It was probably meant for bigger 20-40 man vanilla raids and later was remade for 10 people...
---
No, you only need to speak to some of them.
---
Yeah ok... I thought there was a different post.
---
That post doesn't say anything about physical server location, yes they're not splitting realms by language but there's no mention of splitting by *region*
---
There’s like a million reasons that, logistically, Blizzard would never add content to Classic, but do people really think they might, regardless?
---
i know this seems kinda lame and im not really a fan of these screaming mobs. i prefer to just think of them as like walking community events
---
Players are the shop keepers and people you encounter there.
---
They are certainly planning for failure, and it's really scary to see that. Even before the game is out, they are expecting it to instantly die.

And you think having at least 3 servers for every language what Blizzard should do?
---
I hope that's true and how it ends up being. I had a few bad experiences in the starter zones last night.

&gt; You can't form a cohesive community with people who can't communicate with each other.

And yet somehow Europe functions.

&gt;australia has some of the worst internet in the world, for pve content IN VANILLA it will make almost difference at all, in pvp it will make SOME difference, about as much as it did 15 years ago,  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;however being no official 'ranked' play it probably wont matter, and probably wont be part of their end decision  
---
&gt;as an aussie I don't really care personally, while I was jamming on the stress test it was totally 100% playable and to me there was no noticible differences

As long as they stick to the vanilla principles.

I mean open world FFA is fine. Otherwise you have to stick right on top of each other so you dont miss quest drops.

It is though.  Listen to them:  "I don't want people on my server that I can't understand."

Is this for the last 30 days aswell, although not stated?

If not: there is no way the data is accurate if they only detected 880k IN TOTAL. Realmpop has EU+NA combined lv20-120 of 47million chars.

Is it really that much of a difference druid to warrior? Obviously warriors get plate armor and shields so the ability to block attacks.

But druids can generate higher threat and do more damage than a warrior tank.

I like the versatility of a druid. Battle rez. Mark of the wild. Quick change to cat form if the boss throws you into the air etc.

I think those people are an entirely different group. There are also a huge number of people who want the authentic experience without any changes (and yes, like layering), but the two groups are not the same.

* Armor cap vs Level 63 is 17,265. Your number appears to be using the new armor formula that came with TBC.

* In unbuffed Pre-Bis warriors have ~6600 armor. Bears have ~11,000. 
---
* Bears reach the soft armor cap in BWL gear. Soft armor cap comes from the amount to reach 17,265 with the 25% buff from inspiration.
---
Wouldn’t object to that either but most people want the content in vanilla as it was, and I suspect that content they planned in vanilla would be more palatable than changes to vanilla itself. 
---
The argument could be made that my idea does that very thing, but hey, I want some changes like the one highlighted today- leeway- and many other things that they’ve addressed already like the new architecture.
---
Why do you think there will only be 5 NA servers?  Did I miss an announcement?
---
So because i agree with blizzard where you disagree to them so im condescending some how? Can you explain that for me please
---
That does sound viable, especially since speed-levelers won't want to bother with it and layering should be disabled ASAP regardless.
---
People argue that BFA devs couldn’t do this but the Classic devs have been on the money for the most part imo.
---
You are getting your own servers on your continent, its just shared with other players in the same geographic region. People seem to be missing this point.

Ill happily play with SEA and SG players on a server here, Hosting in syd makes the most sense its  where the sea cables land as crossrealm bgs still take us to america. Language barrier isnt really a problem. more people to fight against in bgs.

Whether I trust them or not is irrelevant. They are going to do what they are going to do and no amount of screaming here will change that. And nobody "blatantly lied" -gods I hate that phrase- It's in development phase, nothing is set in stone and decisions change.

Every guild as if there will be a lot of those per server. Also won't those guilds source professions themselves in a communistic fashion? I'd imagine everyone just sends their greens to the enchanter.

Who's a kid?
---
You didn't see the throngs of streamer support when people complained about not getting an invite to the beta?
---
Back in the day, our guild was fairly large with 60-80 members prime. We had a website and there was a registration tool, you could register your character with Name/Class and apply for the raid days with 2 speccs. (Like Shivalah, Druid, 1st: Feral 2nd: Resto. Since we didn’t need any ferals, I would accept this raidmember for the proposed day as a Healer). We announced the dates 3-4 weeks in advance and had always like 35 members ready. And then we would invite people that applied but were too late for the first 40slots. If such a backup member would then participate we would reward his „being on standby“ with additional dkp he could offer in the next raid.
---
When I think back, quite the complicated system but, dang it, it was so awesome having all those people come together for the event (the Raid) and having fun slaying bosses and receiving loot.
---
Your logic is so flawed. And who cares if a bunch of fan boys give some dweeb their gold? That doesn't affect you. And how is giving ppl free shit the reasoning behind ppl buying and selling gold, id love to hear that one.
---
Sure it helps, it just doesn't make them completely immune.  Watching a bunch of people trying to find a stealthing streamer sounds pretty entertaining, actually.
---
That clip really highlights the issue with this "mechanic". And it affects both PvP *and* PvE. You basically have to stutter step just to avoid this if you want to kite, which is jank as fuck and counter intuitive to kiting.
---
Off an on since 2006. I played when I was a kid. Didnt do beta testing at all just revived my old account and saw an option to download wow classic. Dont be a dick
---
I'd like to wait out the rush, casually chatting with folks. The people that are left over will be super chill, and likely the kind of people I'll wanna play with for the long run.
---
I want to think most of this is due to the game being in beta and most people's only ability to take part in the beta is to watch these fart knockers.
---
Streaming is the worst thing to happen to gaming recently, change my mind
---
I don't, but if someone wants not to wait in queue they should be able to. Because I was there in vanilla, and let me tell you 30 people on top of a quest item was not a thing. So if you really are about no changes, what you see in the picture needs to go.
---
No you are thinking about it wrong.
---
Blizzard doesn't think that the numbers of players in Germany warrants spending money on German localisation of the client.
---
Australia uses the English version so no localisation cost. Also if retail has AU servers, why would classic?
---
60 xp per kill in a starting zone while grouping up? Get out of here.
---
I'd hope these guys are kids and not adults
---
For PVP, I'd max out Improved Conc. Aura and you don't really care about melee +hit: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/05503122511051-05025102023
---
For maximum PVE, you want something different: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/05503122521351-503201-5 (unless you want Blessing of Sanc)
---
But personally, I prefer: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/05503120521351-05024133 because it allows you to tank dungeons relatively easily.
---
That's what i was thinking too.  Thanks!!!
---
A quick fix for blizzard is to make an incognito mode for streamers. Randomized dedicated names, hidden location(not a problem for most classic fans but still helpful) etc. 
---
You need to realize that some of these very large streamers content is based off their fan base. There is no way they will have a truly classic experience with a horde following them the entire time mob tagging, or gang banging the opposing faction. 
---
Best you can hope for is that there is an equal amount of people who want to kill him vs people who want to worship him. Server balance, yada yada. 
---
Blizzard could also enforce some rule regarding people spamming world chat with streamer twitch chat. Have them only use a certain channel dedicated to that streamer that you could leave and join as you please.
---
Because the time taken to run over to corpses is HUGE, especially for melee with no charge, like say, rogues. 
---
Really, FFA loot is a message to you, to spread out and start pulling your own stuff. That's the message I want people to take away: when free for all is on, it means you are supposed to show a bit of initiative. pull your own mobs, kill your own mobs, loot your own mobs. 
---
It is actually a large effort to be standing next to mobs  to loot them in wow, and it's a lot of time. Rogues and warriors don't want to go anywhere near your corpses, because frankly, it's not worth running 30 yards backwards, and then 30 yards forward again, to loot 2 linen.
---
As a melee, I actually am very willing to stay in a group with someone who is willing to act independently. If you can be relied upon to just handle your own shit, I don't mind grouping with you across an entire zone, or multiple zones. 
---
About 75% of the time though, when I group with new people, they FOLLOW me. And not like "we are running along parallel to each other in the same general direction. They literally walk in my footsteps, leaching exp as I kill my way across the zone, occasionally throwing out a halfhearted autoattack and clipping my dots. And whenever I pull some tight mobs from ranged, they usually send a pet in and aggro like 3 extra mobs and nearly get us all killed.
---
What I personally want, as melee, is to communicate to you "just do your own thing here". I don't want you jumping on my pulls, unless it makes obvious sense, like "I pulled 3 melee mobs and you could pick one of them up here.". If I pull 5 mobs, I don't want us to deathmatch them. I want to leash 4 of them and kill the one of them I care about.  Grouping is terrible when someone wants to stand 10 yards from you and fuck up all the stuff that would work fine if you were solo. 
---
Also, frankly, most humans have a gratitude and fairness reflex. If you notice a person is hogging all the loot, first of all, that is going to be super unusual in my experience, and secondly, you are gaining valuable information about who they are that you can use to your benefit. The value of knowing that someone is willing to screw you over on shit no one cares about, like 4 linen, is great to know before it really matters.  
---
really, if FFA is on, Just watch the other player, and if you are getting screwed... it's not because FFA is on. it's because the person you are playing with, you shouldn't be playing with at all. When it's time to say, grab miner's gear in silver stream mine, you know who is going to be looting boxes while you fight? yeah. That guy. You know when it's time to collect twilight pendants in blackfathom deeps, you know who is going to get all of those? that guy. ditch that guy, and NOT because FFA is on.
---
You'll be pleased to hear it wasn't cringe  until that last line. Good job!
---
The client is already localized to German...
---
They don't need to "try to find" him. They'll know exactly where he's standing.
---
It is what? Wanting to be able to communicate with people in an MMO where communication is vital is racist? Well if so then call me hitler. You're delusional man.
---
Absolutely
---
I think the whole ms &gt; os thing is kinda lame as it discourages people from being flexible and filling whatever role fills the group quickest.

There's only going to be a handful of realms per continent, so yes, they'll be plenty of guilds looking to powerlevel an enchanter. And it's cheaper to buy enchanting mats than it is to buy BoE greens, so they'll sell their greens and buy your mats.
---
Easier to think about layers as sub-realms within realms, except you have no control over which you are in, but you can still temporarily jump to the layer another person is in by grouping with them. This means that, even if you end up on a different layer than your friends do, you can still play together by being in the same group.
---
It's the system Blizzard devised to control the huge influx of players at the launch of Classic without having to create dozens of realms at the start that would later be left deserted, or having to queue people for hours to get logged in. Eventually, once the playerbase decreases and stabilizes, layering will be removed completely.
---
It's the compromise Blizzard found to deal with this issue, but as you can see the pros vs cons are still debatable.
---
Layering 1-20 absolutely makes sense. Anything past that not so much
---
That random "n-1" lol... It's not a formula
---
Wing Clip rank 1 not working in Classic?
---
You have no right to punish anyone for anything.
---
There will be realms in Taiwan, Korea, and Los Angeles. You pick.
---
a layer is a big shard that can be the size of a whole server. the channel part is a chat channel. channel 1 is general chat, channel 2 is trade chat, channel 3 is local defense, and i forgot what channel 4 was. So i guess the assumption here is that although people are on different layers, it seems that the chat channels are NOT layered so you can see everyone chatting. I could be wrong.
---
Play us-west? Yay being in the central US and can play all the data centers just fine.

Nah. Worst case is the real transfer part might not be free.

I would love for you to post this in the official Blizzard forums.
---
Until you find out Blizzard isn't releasing a server on your timezone. Sucks to be central US then.
---
I've been working on spreadsheets at work for leveling etc. Needs to be done

I don’t understand how/why someone could possibly be that thirsty for a streamer.
---
Can't imagine anyone over 20 to fanboy and act like that over a streamer on a videogame, I think 16 is the cutoff even. Would be hilarious if I was proven wrong though
---
Popular opinion seems to be any contested zones shouldn't be layered/sharded. There are far more options at 20+ so each zone won't be as crowded and clusterfucky as the starting zones. Coincidentally we'll probably see the playercount drop a bit as people hit that level 20+ milestone.
---
There's no shame in thinking that something is fun, and anyone who says otherwise can fuck off.
---
Unless you think killing people is fun. Yeah I'd probably be ashamed of that one.
---
The group dynamic matters more than personal mechanics.
---
It reminds me of teenage girls who went apeshit for the boyband of their generation.
---
"Europe functions?" Where are you from?
---
You have a disturbingly american way of looking at this and seem to misunderstand the subtleties of the European community. We function specifically by maintaining a respectable distance from each other. It doesn't mean we hate each other, it means we know each other very well.
---
I don't know how hard it will be to find groups but there are people that are dead set on if its not a warrior it can't tank i don't know why its such a big deal to them but they just hate it.
---
But over all they can be real fun to tank with and have huge versatility.
---
It really just come down to what you'll have more fun with but warriors just have more situational abilities and o shit powers.
---
Taladril's guide really dose a good job of going over it and skarm has great vids of tanking as a bear and how he gears out.
---
Not with a stream delay.
---
Why? So once I hit level 30 I’m surrounded by thousands of people?
---
How bout they just increase the server cap to 5k, and add sharding pre 30. Removing layering at 30 adds a whole other level of fucked
---
Thanks, ubi! You made my night!
---
I’m a computer noob. Do monitors like this run games better than say a 40 inch tv?
---
We don't actually know that Petrified Leaf won't be available in Phase 1. That would mean Majordomo offers no loot at all.
---
In any case, you can get a good idea at https://itemization.info
---
Just don't play the first few months* fixed it for you
---
Not sure what your point is. Mandarin is a pretty useful language since more and more of the world's economy is being taken over by the Chinese. 
---
English on the other hand is the lingua franca of the world. Wherever you go you find people who speak English, where Mandarin is relatively confined to China and even only some areas of China. 
---
More information exists in English than any other language and by far the most articles, books or other media are either naturally produced in English or first translated into English.
---
It's the most important language in the world to know and you'd think that people in such a language diverse region such as Europe would prioritise learning it.
---
It honestly sucks to plan ahead. Imagine joining a community, joining the server they all agree on, leveling up, and they suck. Their raid leader is annoying. They wipe on stupid bosses.  
---
The best thing to do is level up, get a feel fro who the top guilds are on your server, and apply.
---
The root is different. The beta is in the "under development" section, because it's a beta. The stress test is the actual client but with limitations.
---
Which will ruin their ability to interact with their sperg fanbases, destroying their influence. No streamer does that.
---
Streamers and layers, double the cancer!
---
I wish everyone would stop posting about things they dont understand.  
---
Layering is not fine.  
---
Leeway is how it is supposed to fucking work.  
---
Bosses die in 30 fucking seconds, its fine to play Ele Shaman.  
---
ALRIGHT?!
---
Madseason streams? Neat.
---
I don’t consider losing 3 days of my 7 days of PTO to server being overloaded or not actually being able to kill mobs a reasonable “cost of convenience”. I honestly believe half of the no changes people never playing classic at its original launch.
---
Ikr most of these issues just straight up don't apply to us as long as we get our own servers (in fairly confident we will considering we have a dedicated oce data centre).
---
Do you really think 100 level 12’s are gonna do this on live? 
---
Game isn’t released and I doubt this is how it’s intended to work, more than likely it’s a bug.
---
I'll be leveling warrior with my mate playing holy paladin, probably will beat most people to 60 with that comp :P
---
They stopped sending invites a few weeks ago.
---
The stress test should give you a fair indication of drop rates. Thanks for letting me know!
---
No I spend my money on tobacco and gas for work
---
You better familiarize yourself with google translate
---
We would? As i remember we just use English......
---
I love streamers, not because I watch them, but the amount of triggering they cause to everyone else
---
Basically the biggest problem with game design, especially from Blizzard, over the last 15 years.
---
Look at SC2 vs Broodwar. Look at D3 vs D2. Most of the "quality of life" changes they make in order for games to be more 'accessible' or 'streamlined' usually end up taking away major components that were critical to the actual gaming experience. I'm not looking to hold down W and watch content, I want to play an actual video game.
---
Ill just wait for the AU realm, Chinglish wouldn't lie.
---
Maybe no *popular* streamer would do that, but trust me, *some* streamers would do that.
---
Healing ranking.  Priest \~ paladin &gt; shaman &gt; druid.   By t3 druids surpass shaman on anything that doesn't allow them to liberally chain heal.   On fights where they can effectively spam chain heal, they'll be at the top.
---
Does anyone know if there will be actual oceanic servers? Bliz being all sneaky with their "green" connection bar which is actually 220ms
---
Seriously though the Fire Marshall would should that ass down.
---
I prefer the ctrl+r. F5 is, like, too far away. It tires my arm.
---
I like how Drezis is just looking for intellect buff and is lost in a sea of leeches.
---
Why would some small time streamer know anything about Blizzard's plans?
---
man I played on Agamaggan-EU in vanilla, lots of spanish people with a mix of germans. 
---
'tis was good fun. I even learned some german thanks to that. Very little spanish too.
---
Could somebody please ELI5 layering and why they're doing it?
---
Vanilla or death
---
Thanks for sending me the link. It looks like at least part of the reduced bear DPS will be linked to weapons being correct to their vanilla values. (Pservers have TBC). 
---
I expect some of it will be bugs though as I know hunter has a bunch of legitimate ones affecting gameplay.
---
That would be clever.
---
Problem is that the chill effect doesn't get refreshed, it becomes less efficient. That being said, the more slow % is safer.
---
lol if you have a brain you would be doing the opposite..
---
Oh my sweet summer child
---
I don't remember language only servers on release. I though they were added in later. There were plenty servers that were known to be italian or spanish.
---
Simple reading comprehension. I said I am *lucky* if I get 3-4 hours to play. There are days where I won't even be able to log in. 
---
Plus your projection is if you're playing a class like hunter and/or following a power level guide. I plan on doing neither. Currently debating between warrior and priest, which are two of the slowest classes. My goal is 10 days /played for 60.
---
Except layering as we have seen can be exploited while staggering the playerbase through unlocking access does not.
---
To each their own, but the guy seems like a legit prick to me in all of his streams, and those react videos have taken over every youtube recommendation since I watched one like two months ago.
---
I'd settle for a desk mate. My rig is currently on top of a round wooden dining table. 
---
But since it works I haven't felt like investing the hundred bucks or so it would take to get a proper desk that could support a second monitor.
---
I’ve leveled every class to Max level by Cata/MOP.  Leveling was easy after I think after the Cataclysm.
---
However I never tried a warrior in Vanilla, only paladin and mage originally.
---
The hell ive experienced on private servers is worse then any hard mode boss or raid.  And I’ve been in guilds stuck on bosses for 4-6 months.
---
Leveling Vanilla warrior is rough as fuck.  There’s that weird stretch from levels 4-40 that make any accidental pull of 2 mobs certain death.  It’s sucks balls.
---
I even leveled cooking and alchemy for the buffs.  Shit is even worse cuz dying now ruins your buffs.
---
Yeh it should be fine and obtaining rank 10 is relatively easy.
---
Do you know if it copied the players actionbar?    
---
Would it be optimal in PvP to not use your number 1 actionbar in case you got MC'd?
---
All depends on how the realms work out. If everybody was on the same realm then sure. It doesn't really make any difference. But given the long list of realms in the recent stress test, that doesn't appear to be the case.
---
So now you're going to run the chance that you end up playing on the "unofficial language x" server and only speak language y. This is going to significantly impact your experience.
---
I mean, people have been discussing how classic is about community and social interactions. Sure, I can run a dungeon with somebody from France or Germany. I can even ask them for directions to supermarket. But my ability to make friends is severely limited by the language gap.
---
My realm was merged with a minority language server that didn't have enough population to receive it's own region. To begin with it was fine because my realm had the larger population. But over time people moved away and the other realm grew in popularity because it's language niche. Eventually 50-70% of my interactions were were people that spoke another language. Friends chatting in another language as they played. It sucked and I eventually rerolled leaving behind characters I played since vanilla launch and tbc.
---
Just played for 11 hours, ah how glorious.
---
I think general chat gets layered as well
---
Panda Cub. Not even a hard decision.
---
Prenerf C'thun was simply impossible no? I guess with 1.12 talents it might be possible but no way to know.
---
Probably not.
---
Germany has 2.7 players for every 1 of yours and they're not getting their own server.
---
Do you think that soda and asmon are going to raid with their twitch chat? Of course they will have solid players gaming with them. Good players follow good players. Same thing happened at 2004 release. Everyone said they were going to avoid the designated PVP server. Guess what? Everyone ended up on a handful of servers.
---
Just because someone isn't shooting to hit 60 in 1-2 weeks and aim for stupid fast progression doesn't mean they are bad.
---
Have you got a link to him saying there will be oce servers? Is it in a youtube video somewhere?
---
Depends on class. If you are Mage/Priest/Warlock I would recommend going Tailoring to get your BOP pre-BIS chest and then drop it if you want to go engineering. 
---
I am not going engineering. Even though I will be on a PVP server, I don't plan to PVP much outside of World encounters. Going to keep Tailoring for Bloodvine set when ZG releases.
---
Don't group with other randoms on a collection quest? Doesn't make any sense. You get 100% of the drops if you're alone. Only reason you want to group is to get more people tagging them, which means this situation is the exact result. Sounds like someone knew they were better off alone and just slapped FFA on to take advantage of the situation.
---
I really wonder how many guilds where using nightfall axes to buff dps. A few where but now everyone knows to do it. Power shifting druids where rare back in vanilla now people know how's to do it. There are a lot of things that will just make things easier.
---
Thankfully, I have never heard of him.
---
There will be almost no 60 tanks or healers early on.
---
It’s mostly the French, German and Spanish who fail at English. Everyone else can communicate just fine.
---
Yes it does, including greater stoneskin (2000 armor) potion. Does not include world buffs. 
---
FYI. Getting my info from playing around on private server PTRs and: 
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vToTypohsSgtBNzVDS8JP3JrLPMu9_7AcsNakV4elPoS_Nf2aWPRxBLl9EBCf2eazbAk7rfnkD1-Wye/pubhtml#
---
I read it in a thick Russian accent.
---
Private Servers are a bad example. They have many numbers wrong and numbers are the issue. It's not only about the requirement for performance. It's about many things, including game balance. Spawn timers, drop chances, area sizes and more are balanced for servers of a certain size. Just think about people farming cloth in Tyrs Hand. They were already overcrowded in vanilla - these areas can't deal with 10 times the player count.
---
What does level has to do with it?
---
We started on Spinebreaker EU, quickly nicknamed Spainbreaker.
---
indeed
---
Warriors in EQ would like a word with you.
---
yeah i just said "oh god" out loud,  its been so long haha
---
Yes please. I'd like a mod that auto-ignores anyone who says "poggers".
---
The BIS weapon is a 2h mace + mace specialization, which makes end-end game axe specialization worthless, but the stun resist is insane.
---
Yeah you’ll be able to get down when they don’t matter any longer.
---
You probably can't have all the layers covered. But the way he did it, each time he closed client and then created new character, this character was on different layer. So you still can easily hop between 2-3 layers.
---
Oh my, I vaguely remember doing that as well.
---
That post never specified physical server locations, just that EU wouldn't be split by language.
---
&gt; /u/BrakumOne Hell the fuck no. How is this ever gonna be fair for people who are not in the first wave? If i wasn't in the first wave i would go on a rant here and on the forums, contact support to tell them to fuck off and vote with my wallet and not play the game.
---
This level of entitlement does not have a place in classic wow
---
Asmongold, Esfand, Staysafe, Swifty.
---
Since when has realm time ever mattered?
---
Because otherwise you'll get hour long queues for months after launch and everybody will be complaining. Now sure, that's the vanilla experience, but you either have that, a metric fuckton of dead servers that force constant realm changes or layering until it all settles.
---
I can totally see Activi$ion opting for that. How the mighty have fallen.
---
That's because 75% of traffic to Reddit comes from English speaking countries.
---
Hunter's are pretty bad off with a lot bugs and I doubt these will be fixed before Classic launches as well....

---
Yes, that's true... I should clarify I was referring to Heals over time - where the heals continue to tick after the initial heal is cast. Those healing ticks will generate aggro if you are in combat regardless of when you casted the initial heal.
---
r/cursedimages
---
Cool thanks ill check that site.
---
I don't have the lucidity to read this entirely but I skimmed and it seems to be about the thing where you can hit, cast Seal of Righteousness, and have the seal's damage be applied from the previous hit? If so I have also noticed that bug.
---
I don't think there will be a ton of high level tanks either, but who knows.
---
Yeah, it's one of those things where if you want to play the game, you basically have to not play for a period of time until the main audience has gone to bed.
---
It will probably be a hell of a lot easier once the OCE/EU/US servers all get split up, because then we in the AUS/NZ group aren't competing in the barrens with countries that are literally 10 times the size of us. 
---
Still, it was a solid hour before i managed to finish the first quest, killing 14 wolves, because it took so damn long to get the first hit on them. I specifically blame being a mage, because casting firebolt was a 2 second cast, and in that time there was about 2-3 arrows, people running to the mob and shadowbolts all heading to the same mob.
---
Logged in at 3am PDT and completely different game, still a ton of people online, but you could do all the quests without any problems, so totally an overpopulation issue based on everyone worldwide logging into 2 servers only.
---
here's the original post

Eh, I'd rather just see the re-emergence of chat filter addons. I used to have one to block gold seller messages by adding urls and permutations to its blacklist. It'd be handy for filtering out this kind of spam.
---
If big time streamers wanted a "classic experience" I suspect they'd just play off-stream. There's no way for them to be incognito under any circumstance because people will find their character in game based on where they are, what they're doing, and what they look like.
---
gfy with braindead pseudo arguments, pos.
---
Personally, would rather there be no layering at all. We should all cohabitate the same game world we choose. If the server pop drops too low, have an elective free transfer to other low pop realms. It's really not that bad.

Officialy dumbest post of this sub

Removed as offensive / Rule #2.

Yes, God forbid many people engage in large group community events. Fuck them all and their fun. Get it outta my /1
---
Fear ward is underrated if anything. Roll a Dwarf Priest and guild masters will beg you to join their guild.
---
All of EU's servers are in Paris and Frankfurt, that doesn't matter at all.
---
The decision not to split up EU is because Blizzard doesn't think the entire EU population can sustain more than a handful of servers. Which means Blizzard doesn't think AU can sustain even one server.
---
Wait, didn't they say they just aren't going to 'split the realms into multiple different languages' ? 
---
So German players will still enjoy European servers with a low latency?

I just kill shit and keep killing shit. The if Im ahead of thenhorde take zuljin village quests
---
Nah, $300+ mic sending signal to a cheap dac and then compressed for streaming. Sounds like a great idea. I mean if it's lying around doing nothing sure... but it's not like you'd buy one for that purpose.
---
They said they wont do this. But now i dont believe it anymore. People will cry GET ME OUT this Server and boom
---
Oh man I missed the anti streamer circle jerk earlier and just got in at the end of the anti-layering circle jerk I'm glad some kind soul combined the two. I love the sheer roiling hatred oh boy
---
All of EU's servers are in Paris and Frankfurt, so yes, latency won't matter. Only having 5 realms to choose from will matter.
---
Dude the only thing that’s sad is that you would think this way. 
---
It’s YOUR life and you live it how you want to. As long as you aren’t hurting anyone else you should feel NO pressure other than to spend your time how you want to. Because you like one thing and not another does NOT make you sad. Anyone who has ever told you you should feel that way is sad. Having something your passionate about is ducking AWESOME. Whether it’s kids or music festivals or a computer game. 
---
Don’t feel sad. Feel AWESOME!
---
zergling FTW!!!
---
If you're not doing raids it matters a lot less, but I'd personally pick something that doesn't wear cloth gear. If you're playing together it makes it so you're not always losing out on gear (cause lets be honest you're gonna give it to your daughter) and it would make the Leather, Mail, or Plate gear you find actually useful beyond just selling it.
---
Yeah look, I was kinda ok with the idea of layering but the more I see this kinda shit the more jaded I get. I hope they sort their shit out. If 100 level 12-15 players want to fight the same amount of the apposing faction let them have at it.
---
all Hail Ru Gods with their glorious ru-servers! awesome!
---
&gt; So you're advocating for an actual, visible change away from vanilla? That won't go over very well.
---
I honestly don't know what the fuck to say to you lol. Are you even reading what you're saying? Dynamic spawns *were* in vanilla. You know what wasn't? The thing you're advocating for, **layering**.
---
&gt;There has never been a private server launch on the scale of what we're going to see for Classic.
---
Oh I'm glad you know that the classic servers are going to have more than 20k people each. Mind sharing the numbers that we're going to see on launch? Since you're psychic or have all this inside info.
---
&gt;That doesn't mean anything about layering though.
---
How is it not layering? You think all the people that were in the barrens just happened to be clumped up on some mountain in the middle of nowhere and literally none of them were on the road from mulgore to razor hill? Literally none of them were in XR? No, of course they were, they were just in a different layer.
---
Nope. You don't want to pick a class and specialization that wasn't designed to do the content. Warriors are just better tanks. It's like, on 4 horseman, you can disarm them to reduce their damage quite a bit. 
---
And if you really plan on investing a lot of time into the game (ie. years), a warrior tank with thunderfury is going to make any druid look like a joke.
---
On top of everything else, if you play at that level, eventually dps gear will be funneled to you even if you're a tank, and then you have the option of topping the charts as dps in raids, too.
---
No point in fighting the tide. Warriors were basically "the chosen ones" in vanilla WOW.
---
Spoken like a true retailer.  The goal shouldnt be to have it "feel crowded". the goal is to have a server where you play with the same people.  "feeling crowded" is stupid and what retail does with crz

I’m probably going to start an explicit 25-30 player guild for these reasons. Way easier to manage and gear up.
---
Vanilla, BC, FT, and Cata boxes.  I downgraded to regular edition for Pandas&amp;Pokemon and back to Outland.
---
Can someone explain layers for me ?
---
Can we have a red curved arrow pointing at the (funny), otherwise I’ll remain skeptical if the comedic value this video holds.
---
In PvP the pet doesn't matter so much. I personally never really microed it to a crazy extent. Just sacced my voidwalker over and over again until I won lol. 
---
I feel like its probably best to micro your pet in the min/max sense, but I'm lazy and never really did in PvP and I did just fine.
---
Is it really that bad? I'm from Germany, but I'm  planing to play on an international server. I did that on the original Secret World and it was really fun to meet people from different countries.
---
If communication fails, maybe sticking to a German client/server is the better idea?
---
Nice dude that's a good idea
---
If you're new to the game, Warriors are horrible. If you know how the play vanilla warriors, they're not too bad.
---
A few people here talk about quests directing you someplace but don't rely too much on these as they get fewer and far between later on. Directing quests shouldn't always be followed either, for example, you could get a quest directing you to the other continent. If you want to explore this is a good excuse to do so, if you want to focus on leveling there will be zones on your current continent with quests, you just have to find them.
---
Pls cut germany off this list... we have a horrible accent and may be not the best when it comes to speaking and pronouncing hard words. But i would say that more than 75% of the young people understand almost everything you say to them. Like i said, if u dont have routine in speaking a language, it can be very hard to speak in discord and such.
---
The video that made me reroll my Hunter. 
---
Looking forward to Classic WoW.
---
Orc is the best PVP warrior.
---
Tauren is the best progression tank warrior.
---
Humans and Trolls are the best end-end-end game speed running tank warriors.
---
Yes because your tv likely caps at 30 or 50hz, you want a monitor to be at least 60 hz if not higher, this helps you make use of higher free rates.
---
I am not sure what the worst would be.  If we are talking personal dps, then maybe enhancement shaman.  Top will be warrior usually.    Difference would the warrior doing double or even triple the dps of the enhancement shaman.
---
People knew about these things, they just didn’t feel like they were necessary at all.
---
I also think that a lot of it is also going to come down to proc-rates and up-times for different items, which are likely wrong on private servers compared to Vanilla.
---
i think the only way they would do a 1.13 is if Classic actually surpassed live, because if it did it would make sense to make content for the larger game.
---
not saying that is likely just how i could see it happening
---
By the by
---
1- This is legit
---
2- There were other issues but this was the death knell, since I’ve been prepping to speedrun launch for the last couple of years
---
On live you most likely want to get to 60 fast (something layering helps with by providing more quest mobs) instead of doing PvP which doesn't even give you honor in phase 1.
---
Warrior isn't very complicated. I'd say if she wants to play Warrior she ought to do it. 
---
You could do Priest/Mage, but like you noted the downside is you're both going to want the same gear. Its not the end of the world, but it can be frustrating.
---
I hope so. it sucked in vanilla with no oceanic servers.
---
You are a ridiculous person period
---
GaMe WoN’t ImPaCt ThE sTrEaMeRs

Copy paste it rather than pretending it exists.

You’ve got no point of argument to stand on.
---
You know what a lot of other 40ers do instead? They go to swinger clubs and pretend that their kids haven't got a suspicion. You know what they do when swinger clubs are destroying their marriages? They get divorced and f\*ck up their kids' development as collateral damage. Let's say I know of plenty of families that are basically shams and constantly on the verge of breakup. You on the other hand don't seem to cause any trouble to anyone. Basically a model citizen. Most people have got boring pointless shitty  frustrating trapped-feeling lives, but hide it very well to the outside world. As a kid in elementary I was once jealous of this classmate who seemed like he had a family better than mine. He and I were both on basketball, and his parents always attended when we were playing matches, unlike mine. Fast forward to now: his parents have divorced, family is broken. I wouldn't be surprised if the mother was boning someone, as she was a housewife, while the father was away frequently being a truckdriver and all.
---
My ignore list is going to be maxed out if there is spam like this anytime one of those guys is on.  Hopefully it wont be like that after 5h3 first few weeks...
---
For tanking. For PVP, the stun resist potential is way better.
---
For threat, trolls are the best horde side, and humans might be the best of them all. Sword specialization kicks ass given that most of the best tank weapons are swords. And when the game is basically over, Might of Menethil is the best 2h weapon, it's a mace, and humans have mace specialization.
---
The real thing Taurens excel at are progression, which, to be fair, might be the single most important thing in the game. It's hard to say, though. I have the feeling that it's going to be way easier this time around and threat (keeping up with people's generally higher dps) is going to become the new meta for tanks.
---
Yeah, 1 million subs in /r/wow and 3-4 million subs for retail. What's with the remaining 66/75% ?
---
Over 50% of Reddit are American. The remaining people deal with English, but that doesn't mean they want to. They have no choice. At least in German there is no comparable community. I also don't use Reddit to relax and won't find a guild within that I want to talk to on discord.
---
Is it hard to understand that people prefer their native language?
---
Bi-winning
---
I always say play with your friends if they also have a strong interest in the game. Its always more fun that way. No class is more fun than playing with friends.
---
Loot boxes.
---
Is it really a nerf if this is how its always been?
---
This honestly makes me not want to play classic.
---
Recent bluepost says "several servers" for EU which has the same playerbase than NA..
---
If I remember right exorcism would auto-crit any undead. Make leveling in Duskwood an absolute must
---
One of my favorite things to do as a Druid is buff Warriors and Rogues with MotW and Thorns. Maybe even top them off if they’re out killing shit. 
---
I got you, bros 😉
---
Exactly. People are acting like this is actually going to be happening in vanilla.
---
The whole "demons controlling the scarlet crusade" thing really fits well with the nurning legion coming back during BC
---
You have any experience with vanilla Naxx vs Wrath naxx.  I assume Wrath was easier, but how easy?  Like hard mode Wrath naxx or like 0 light hard?
---
You're assuming a lot, essentially nothing is changing for EU in regard to ping which is what the OCE population are concerned about...
---
There's server hardware in Sydney as it is, OCE are concerned around a scenario that would be like forcing EU onto NA servers for ALL content.
---
That's pretty much my assessment.  The only time my boar charged a mob on auto charge was when I sent him after another mob, so he charged back the the first mob for no reason.
---
It just occurred to me, I'm going to be able to drop internals on Goldshire again.
---
yes but there will be.
---
They already set up a board post, created 2 discords and organizing some of the biggest  guilds to join the same server (12 hours after they released the news)
---
Okay, so the issue is they don't have a specific server for there own language, but latency will be fine. 
---
To say "So Australia get prepared for those ~138 pings to Los Angeles, which is still totally playable, but just probably not what you wanted" 
---
Without anything to back that up but other than the German server which is no longer in it's native language (But still based in Germany itself..) ?
---
I think I'll wait to see what Blizzard has to say about an Oceanic/Australian based server.
---
At least we managed to get to the correct layer and slaughter their entire raid.
---
But yeah, this shit has to go. It's going to ruin so much of the actual fun stuff that could happen.
---
Amazing thanks
---
Humans are probably the best overall warrior race.
---
Quel'serrar and Thunderfury are swords, humans have sword specialization, and if you're reading, one of those two is what you'll be using (or perhaps the ZG tanking weapon, which is also a sword). Even if you have bad luck and end up with something like Spineshatter, humans also have mace specialization. Basically every good tanking weapon is a weapon type that benefits from human weapon specialization.
---
Same deal with PVP, really. The ultimate weapon is Might of Menethil, a mace, and humans have mace specialization.
---
Berserking is cool, but honestly, the combination of alliance having blessing of salvation, alliance not having windfury and thus making melee dps threat a little less insane, and the human racials make them the clear choice if you're min/maxing.
---
With some of the experience people have with the game now, do you think 80% 4-5 Night raiding will be a thing after the first couple weeks?
---
I honestly expect to be in a semi-hardcore guild but can easily see it only being 2 nights per week.  After the first rag kill, it gets easier and people are blood thirsty for their tier sets.  Should be clearing MC in 1 night by at least December.
---
The class literally worse than pets if not raid-geared.
---
Because it's shocking how much fun it was. I was with You, but I got to finally try it and I'm hooked. I get it now.
---
Turns out it actually does exist. Its been in the game since MoP or Warlords.  If you're running from a mob they get 2.6 yards extra to attack, so it's better just to stand still in many cases.
---

---
34:36 explains it
---
Cool, make it on progressive servers that you guys can ruin all over again and leave my vanilla alone, thx.
---
Blizzard will make decisions based on available population long before they'll make decisions on your ping. And WoW considers 200ms to be a green ping, so they're not even shafting you in any way.
---
I don't watch streamers at all, nor do I care about esports in the least bit. I'd rather play than watch someone else play. It seems odd to me that people qualify streamers and esports as being detrimental (let alone the worst thing to happen) to a game when they have next to zero impact on it. Neither one impacts your enjoyment of the game.
---
If someone is watching and interacting with someone's content, that doesn't have an impact on your play session. In fact, there's so many gameplay avenues that chances are you'll never come across a famous person. He or she gets to go off in their own corner and have their own little fun and you get to have yours. Are you upset that someone else is having fun in a different way than you? Oh no, other people are enjoying the game in a way I don't like. Whatever will I do!
---
And esports. Again. So little work goes into WoW as a competitive game. Since the BC is been broadcasted Arena matches. Next to no resources at Blizzard are spent on the esports side of things. It almost feels like an after thought. Again, why be upset that other people are enjoying the game when you aren't? I don't like esports, so the way I deal with that is I don't watch them and I continue to play the game.
---
If standing in a crowd of too many people is how you want to interact and have fun with people, go to the DMV. More people in one space doesn't make the game better, and layering doesn't remove social interaction or being around other players. You're arguing against something that doesn't exist.
---
I am currently living in Tokyo and playing on EU with a ping of 280 ms. Just checked US yesterday and ping was around 180 ms.
---
I am not feeling any lag or whatever, but I am also playing solo and questing, therefore, I can't really say anything about raiding.
---
Haha madlad I respect the dedication! See you at Tauren mill!!
---
The only time I ever use FFA is when I am a lowbie getting run through a dungeon by a higher level. Then I essentially just loot while they kill everything. I can think of when FFA would be preferable to group loot.  Also if we are in a group but not killing the same mobs, why are we in a group?
---
Straight fendi facts G
---
fuck em!
---
please fix this bug, its really annoying
---
Germany makes up 20.59% of the EU playerbase. How is Germany going to take over a realm with that when there are only 5 realms to choose from?
---
What do you mean? Your statement makes no sense no matter how you analyze it in the context of this post. Can you elaborate?
---
yes, please fix this bug they are too op
---
It will definitely be there during the first 2 phases. Crossrealm battlegrounds will definitely hurt the server communities though. It could crater in later phases as players hole up in the raiding guilds.
---
Phase 3
---
I wonder if people trading in Classic for stuff in BFA will be against TOS, like other non-in-game trades.
---
Haha see you there!
---
Its a good video, right to the point and easy explanation. 
---
Leeway is a mechanic of the past and should be left there. With today's latency and internet speeds this mechanic do more harm than good. When you see something on your screen that isn't reasonable or true to what is happening in the game, this is very poor game design. 
---
Much like the spell batching, you clearly picked up "that flag, and it was placed on your back" but the next second it gets capped by the opposite team without you dying. Or you obviously was in time to interrupt that ability but it still managed to be cast because of spell batching.
---
These two mechanics (leeway and spell batching) makes what you see on the screen not to be true and threats the events in the background as something different happened. This causes confusion and straight up annoyance because the player can not trust the game anymore, to deliver the experience which the player sees on the screen.
---
From a practical and design standpoint this is **VERY VERY BAD**.
---
It doesnt matter if a raid like this is going to happen in vanilla or not. The point is the layering the way it works now will prevent things like this ever happening.
---
Black people are the issue not this
---
Doin the lords work
---
I don’t know of anyone outright saying that layers won’t impact the game. Anything that is in the game will impact the game in some way. 
---
Layering could really fuck the game up but I think if it’s limited to the first week, the vast majority of concerns are avoided. If it lasts two weeks there could be some real endgame mat farming abuse but even that would be short lived. The major concern I and seemingly most others is if it lasts longer than 2 weeks. A much more significant portion of players will reach max level by that point and it could have huge ramifications on the economy of mats. 
---
Regardless of how long layering is in the game there are a few things they could change about how it works that would really minimize the potential for abuse. A lot have been suggested many times and I think if we are have any amount of layering, they need to do everything they can to prevent people from abusing the system. Which is why we have the beta. 
---
I’d be shocked if we don’t have an update to the layering technology before launch. The community has essentially said they don’t want it at all/used as little as possible so ideally Blizzard will listen and do *literally everything they can* to have it working fairly. 
---
Aside from the obvious updates they should make I’d honestly be 100% ok with them banning players who try to exploit the layering system. Wouldn’t we all consider exploits ban-able?
---
this is the dumbest shit i ever seen, this is going to single handedly kill classic wow, LOL what the fuck
---
I would be going horde if my friends weren’t going ally. But go undead priest! Undead is my favorite race by far
---
It's not about where the server hardware is, it's about how many servers Blizzard thinks any given population can sustain. They clearly don't think Germany can sustain one server, so they have absolutely no reason to suspect Australia can do any different.
---
&gt; Actually server capacity is one of the things thats not really debatable.
---
In what way is it not debatable? If you're saying it's not debatable because "#nochanges" then I'm not even going to bother arguing. Until Blizzard confirms one way or another, it's very much debatable.
---
so something like this https://itemization.info/item/23456 for example would be available from vendors in phase 3?
---
Should ask those orcs corpses in nessingwarys
---
A part of me wonders how much it’s going to feel like the original vs how I imagined the original felt lol
---
Sounds like you’re still heaps butt hurt about the recent announcement to not split up eu servers by language. 
---
So you’re engaging in unsubstantiated conjecture, biased by your recent unpleasant reception of blue news. Only to try and justify that OCE players are somewhat in a worse boat than you right now.
---
Gonna wait for the official announcement.
---
Also, as Blizzard has a server facility in Sydney that currently supports ALL blizzard products, including sc2, hots, d3, hearthstone, over watch etc. it would be unlikely they’ll ship the first product in over 8 years that won’t support an OCE server location.
---
Just saying.
---
Surprisingly accurate
---
I know that Reddit and particularly this sub are against those kind of things, however, I've put a lot of time into editing this and I thought you guys might like it after all.
---
It's only 5 minutes and while it's not perfect I think it turned out pretty good. 
---
Would appreciate some feedback if some of you don't mind taking the time to write some down :)
---
Warlocks are gear dependent, they will get curb stomped as fresh 60s. Mages and rogues will dominate. Maybe even hunters
---
Yeah, my first char was on one of the spanish speaking servers. At start I played with other english speaking players but after getting lvl30+ there was only few left. People slowly left due the language.
---
Trying to find group for dungeons was impossible as you got kicked once they realised you don't speak spanish. And I was healer.
---
This decision is horrible by Blizzard.
---
I got mine into wow by sitting her down infront of the character creation screen and saying "look at all the cool hair styles you can choose from". That was back in WotLK and we've been duoing ever since. Looking forward to leveling our undead warrior/priest combo again.
---
In retail you still lose your food buff on death.
---
Caster DPS had basically no major spellpower gear until the same raids where melee got their "overpowered" weapons.
---
How anyone can defend the use of this technology blows my mind.
---
I can’t imagine that any original vanilla players wants this. It must be players accustomed to the use of crz/sharding in retail wow. Layering fucking sucks man.
---
Oh you wanna talk about fires?... 
---
You’re barking up the wrong -world- tree
---
How’s that for a burn.
---
I don’t think he is referring to running dungeons to level he is talking about using his 60 to run a lower level through dungeons to level him. In my experience doing this the lower level receives almost no xp during the run as they typically are doing almost no damage, but that’s all private servers knowledge.
---
It will be social because people are going to force it, simply to try and make it fit what they remember, but once that phase it over chances are it will go back to normal, especially once we have new addons for rating people.
---
Speculation though, it could always be just how it was 15 years ago
---
Mage, Rogue and Hunters. They don’t need much gear to shine because of all the control they have. Warlocks are highly gear dependent and actually struggle a lot fresh at 60 because melee and Hunters rip through them.
---
Ahhhh bros... Server 17... Layer 5.... Shard 2... Blizzard Group 16.... Asmongold Party 8.... Home...
---
This is a bummer as you can definitely cheese your way out of world using this but I do think it will be needed in the launch just because places are gonna be flooded
---
I don't care at all about the EU announcement beyond what it means for the number of servers available. I live and play in the US.
---
None of those games depend on a minimum population and are all cross-region for the most part. WoW is not.
---
You spelled "being" wrong. Who resigns from a job via email and doesn't even proof read it?
---
Very good, now remove they keyboard tray, they're awful.
---
I meant because he literally doesnt have a mouse haha.
---
&gt;	this scripting is incorrect and severely affects the performance of the class
---
This kind of hyperbole for simple potential inconsistencies is really annoying.
---
mate OCE is gonna get local servers regardless, yes they might be under the "Americas" tag but I'd bet my left nut OCE players will have at least one local server to play on.
---
I feel like you're missing the point completely so we'll just leave it at that.
---
man, i miss first aid
---
I used to watch staysafe but after a couple days i couldn't stand it anymore when I realized he repeats everything at least 2 times sometimes 4 or 5 times it gets real annoying
---
The Mist Lich Betrayer of Azeroth: Warlord’s of Deathwing
---
Plenty of them were defending streamers in the thread about asmon &amp; soda's despicable "stream sniper blacklist" videos.
---
They probably think they'll get their favorite streamer to say their name if they suck up to them enough.
---
100 bug reports should get this figured out pretty quickly.
---
Based on the Geographic barriers, I still feel that an OCE server will be available, as Germany will still have access to whatever EU server/s to play on (yes it doesn't accomodate language barriers), but at least it will allow them to play with relatively low ping. 
---
This however isn't possible for AU/OCE players as the lowest ping we would be able to achieve is around 170, which does impact the quality of gameplay. I mean its not horrible but it will put AU players at a disadvantage in PVP for sure.
---
I put a link in the bottom of the post so I didn’t have to waste my time. It shows a video where the Vanilla designer explains how server capacity wasn’t based on tech, but instead a clear design choice by the team.
---
Click the link.. i’m not reiterating hours worth of discussion.
---
I remember I used to summon infernals from the top of the Org AH onto the road. I would wait 5 minutes and the Infernal couldn't find a path to attack me after the enslave broke so it started killing guards and lowbie players.
---
It's kinda sad that you can't do little occurrences of griefing anymore because it's always removed for disrupting the game.
---
!remindme August 13 to claim /u/zefsidex left nut
---
Per physical definition only, presumably.
---
Ok so imagine this. You played Classic WoW back in the day on a German server, speaking and writing only German. Blizzard, over 500 days ago says, "hey we are going back to vanilla, yay, relive the experience!" 
---
Could you imagine being told that you are not playing Classic WoW in your native language? The way it was then.  That is an experience completely ruined after waiting for 500 days with 68 days to go.
---
WoW considers anything under 200ms a "good" ping.
---
Hunters and Rogues won't have weapons though? Will it not mattr much?
---
Check the blue posts...
---
Layering is only for the first few weeks, when everyone fights for mobs in starting zones. So you only need to wait for a few weeks for such stuff, and in exchange you can get to lv10 in less than a week.
---
How will feral/balance druids be?

---
I don't think you have the correct mindset here, just because this mechanic does not benefit your choice of class should not be the reason to oppose or agree with it.
---
The mechanic it self is bad because what you see on the screen can not be trusted with what is happening in the game. I will play a melee class, so this is "good" for me personally, but I oppose this mechanic because its very very bad for the game.
---
Tonight I was questing with someone who insisted on having ffa loot
---
The game itself forces you to be social, simply because soloing is not that ideal in a lot of places. Some random will buff you, you will turn around and buff them. Some person invites you to a group to kill the kobolds togheter, to not die 5 times.
---
Latency =/= language I look forward to tickling both of my nuts on Aug 14
---
You didn´t see players on the floor. YOU DIDN´T
---
You just described it perfectly! Hope you’re right!!
---
Twofold, I reckon: Much of it is definitely just power dynamics. People are insanely drawn to those they feel have some form of power, no matter how much or little they actually deserve it. 
---
Secondly, a lot of these people probably substitute actual social interactions with streamers.
---
Yes you're right, Blizzard will make a decision, thanks for sharing your opinion yet again today on this.
---
Hunters will always be brought for tranq. Shot I played hunter on stress test even though it's only level 15 it will 100% be my main and I thought of never main a hunter. I was more emotionally attached to my pet cat I tamed in barrens then I was to any legendary I've gotten passed MOP.
---
Jajajaja
---
 Esports
---
You mean Real WoW
---
This is my ideal starting zone. Me and maybe a few others. I’m still gonna rush that release date though
---
As far as we know they will release the buffed PVP items, so technically they would be available in p2 but I highly doubt anyone will actually be able to get r14 just from wpvp.
---
awesome, glad to hear.

---
&gt;	They changed sharding (zone based) to layering (continent based) why is it so hard for people to believe they could easily change it so that layer 1,2,3,..,n-1 exist for starting zones and then layer n exclusively exists for all other zones????
---
Because I have actual software engineering experience and would never assume the ease or difficulty in modifying a codebase of which I’m completely ignorant.
---
What's a shard?
---
Don't forget the fighting over blessings vs totems
---
Well, to be fair...
---
alliance - human, no contest.  Best warrior by far.
---
horde - doesn't matter tbh.
---
&gt; but the guy seems like a legit prick to me in all of his streams
---
which is why people follow him, younglings enjoy that kind of reaction/aggravation. of that troupe i'd rather watch esfand because it seems like he's not "trying" to make a living out of shock value crap.  Ya have to look at them from a livelihood standpoint. I didn't know how asmondgold was until he uploaded a ranting video about the shit situation of the live game. Before that the only wow players i checked in with were people doing interesting things to solo old content or find rare items. Now that i'm sitting in Org, lvl1 in the stress test i'm happy i downloaded but i'm not going to bother until it's live.  The streamers don't matter to me unless their server has so many people on it that the AH is cheap because of inflation.
---
Do you think they could do that with side-gearing? Or maybe additional class quests that give a new ability or talents? 
---
Because I agree, only being able to viably tank dungeons as a Prot pally is unacceptable. Too many roles for multiple classes are trash at endgame and saying, “you can tank while leveling” doesn’t really balance out with other classes that have multiple viable specs for each role while leveling and for endgame content.
---
Ideally we would only get one or two servers anyway, likely 1 pvp and 1 pve. On retail we've got like 9 servers but they are all pretty much completely dead and the region would definitely benefit from only having 1-2 realms.
---
What exactly are tiers?
---
...goldshire
---
To shower than dancers with gold.
---
I understand what your saying and what the thread contains. I don't agree that it ends the debate. If Blizz keeps a functional cap of 2.5-3k players, then that means they will need to add a huge amount of servers on launch to account for the massive amount of players(more than were around for Vanilla launch). You can argue that Blizz should do that because that's how servers were back then.
---
The problem is that if they make that many servers, they will eventually have to merge or close a ton of them later on, which is always a mess. And the fact that they are talking about potential long term layering makes me think they are expecting to have larger server caps than they did in Vanilla. If the caps are the same, then layering won't even be necessary beyond the 1st few zones for the 1st few weeks.
---
1% naxx had more to do with the knowing of BC coming out very soon than the difficulty of getting there, but it still played a factor. Private server experience aside, naxx would have been infiltrated by a large player base sooner than later, if there wasn’t a level cap increase in the next few months. 
---
Having alts and new characters gated behind old raids made the experience worthwhile, and even was relevant in bc. It kept old raids relevant because you couldn’t do bwl without first doing ony/mc. 20 mans essentially stepped in as a catch-up mechanic because  you could do zg and aq 20 relatively easy
---
It’s actually easier to rank up without BGs. Plenty will get it before BGs roll out.
---
BE PURGED HERITIC! MAY THE EMPERORS NAME SHINE ETERNALLY.
---
&gt; That is an invalid, bigoted fear. That has not happened and will not happen.  
---
Just becasue you are ignorant to reality dioesn't mean people are bigots you stupid person. It happened to me in retail when I was new to the game in late TBC. I made a rogue on a new server and didn't notice until I was in Outlands that it was an unofficial Italian Server. I tried some groups and people was nice but hardly anyone could speak English and trade chat was just full of non-english messages. Later in Wotlk I rolled on a new server and realized it was an unofficial Polish server....
---
And I jst want to point out that unless you are trolling you are the stupidest idiot I have ever seen because having language problem has nothing to do with bigotry you dork. If I can't communicate with other players, that's a problem in an mmorpg game. If you can't see that you are an idiot.
---
That was when it became an amusement park ride. "Ride this train and right-click bandits who can't hurt you, then collect one perfectly-tailored piece of gear" is not an MMO.
---
So dumb they have to do this.  Instead of 100% of the players picking the right language, they will organize it themselves and some poor bastard that doesnt know what's going on will end up leveling on the wrong server.
---
At least mine is based on numbers and announcements. Yours are based on simply what you want to happen.
---
Imagine being a brain dead spurg losing your shit over a person taking a sip of water.
---
It does and it will more so after 4 months when all the 4weirds leave.
---
You are wrong. Server transfers were definitely a thing in Vanilla.
---
"chinglish wouldn't lie" lmao that's a good one
---
Isn't windfury proc rate 20%? So 80% of the time.
---
Its not a limitation!!! Its an opportunity to increase your skill!!! Stop complaining about the debuff cap. If it was changed it would drastically change the vanilla experience. You are essentially a shadow mage in raids, thats the play style. This thread is about Leeway!
---
I’m sure it’ll be against TOS but that never stops anyone I guess. Lots of people will probably get scammed tho if they try
---
There were paid transfers towards the ends of vanilla
---
Too much of the Payo dude. He's a bit weird. Otherwise some nice clips and the editing was fine.
---
&gt;I honestly don't know what the fuck to say to you lol. Are you even reading what you're typing? Dynamic spawns *were* in vanilla.
---
Well, we've now established that you have no clue what you're talking about. Dynamic spawns were not in vanilla. Not even a little bit. I think that pretty much sums up this little conversation here, I'm done. See ya.
---
also suck my enlarged clit
---
People to avoid:
---
Talking in twitch emotes
---
Saying "Imagine___"
---
Anything related to asmongold
---
It really depends I liked the high lvl zones like Winterspring, Sithilus, Blasted Lands, Eastern Plaguelands etc. 
---
A place close to the content you need quick access to.
---
So what?  How does one abuse this?
---
Terrible early and terrible late with the exception of niche rolls (such as flag carrying)
---
Thanks for doing all this work, and thanks to the users who proved that it is correct.  
---
This is drastically going to change my friends plans to get exalted with Darnassus. Bummed them out but better finding out today then after launch!
---
Then they never would've given OCE servers in retail in the first place. They already have servers down in sydney for retail/other games so there isn't really any reason why we wouldn't have servers there for classic
---
Go on...
---
Silithus
---
The PvE content will so easy early on that as long as you have enough tanks / healers any number above 30 raiders will be more than enough to steamroll 40man content until 4/8 AQ40.  But my experience from playing vanilla and vanilla p servers is that getting 35-40 people every raid is quite easy.
---
Yep. Gonna be our first time experiencing classic at 20ms. feels good.
---
Nobody said that they will be "taking over a realm".
---
Just that a large part of the german classic community, that os interested in a german server, will join the same one.
---
Ahhhhhh *sips coffee*, just the way it used to be 🤠
---
That PvP tournament was at level 30, where most non-mage classes are still lacking most their pvp tools, and against mostly people invited because they're streamers, not because they're good PvPers.

I mean it’s even easier if you can flag players who’ve traded between both accounts in both games.

Looks dope OP you should get one of those led bulbs that simulate flame to make it look like a brazier or conch is illuminating the flag.
---
It's a necessary evil. - players don't want it - blizzard does.
---
Blizzard owns the game, so they'll do as they please.
---
It won't matter come October :) 
---
(Hopefully)
---
So it would only take 5 spawns for the entire picture to complete it, and they wouldn't all need to line up 20 deep.
---
Thanks man I think I’m just gonna do it :) dwarf hunter leggo :)
---
The average pserver player is better than average classic player will be
---
So true
---
Most of the playerbase is going to assume that they are just lagging.
---
One theory I have is that players on pservers are more skilled than players on a more public game.  Agree, disagree?  I don't think as many casual players would pick up private server wow, so the player quality will make it harder to clear content even if it's easier.
---
Tier sets of loot so basically I’m saying I can’t see myself raiding past BWL

Awww, looks like the nochanges crowd is up in shambled, here you guys have it, NO CHANGES.

Almost 47 year old lady here and I have a teenager. Spent all day playing stress test beta and having a blast. You're fine! Have fun!

Very cool.
---
Don't tell me that, I just kinda made a mental choice to go War for Classic. It might also be because I don't want to wait for tanks and we all know that the only tanks in Vanilla/Classic are Warriors
---
I'm 32 and will be 33 when it drops. I have no kids, a house, I work out regularly and make enough to survive. I also have traveled quite a bit and will be as well.
---
That said, wow is one of the all time greatest, fun time sinks with friends. I could easily play this when I'm 50. 
---
You are in a simulated market, dungeon groups, can play different race class combos. All of it is a brain exercise man.
---
I'm just saying you are so not alone bro.
---
Exactly why I have my doubts about the long-term success of vanilla overall.
---
Is the zone a contested PvP zone?
---
If yes no layering.
---
This means starter zone and barrens, westfall etc are layered at start.
---
Redridge is not. Welcome to Redridge.
---
I didn't buy it! I traded it for a rock in ratchet!
---
TVs are pretty terrible for gaming. Most have terrible latency, and non ideal refresh rates.
---
If the beta is any indication, warrior leveling will be much easier.
---
Its different for OCE, the announcement has nothing to do with ping for EU its all around splitting (or not) servers by language.
---
Australia falls under the Americas *region* in ?all? Blizzard games, while nothing official has been announced for OCE, Classic would be the ONLY game available in the launcher without an Oceanic server to connect to, I can't see that happening.
---
Fear is nothing more than an obstacle standing in the way of progress. In overcoming our fear, we can move forward
---
Sure - get rank 13. (14 if you are melee)
---
They talk about it in the wow diary book. It didn't work for several reasons and i think one was the size of the building verses how big instances should be and there were problems with design. that book is a really good read
---
Night Elf - they look great, their zones are great, and you get Shadowmeld. Or you can be a stumpy, ugly Dwarf with a free health pot skill and a free PvP trinket skill that plenty of other people will have and you don't even need. Yay?
---
I can see their spittle oozing from their mouth that never shuts
---
16 debuff slot limit was introduced in vanilla mate. It was at first a balancing and technological difficulty, then it was no longer the case IN VANILLA.
---
Further, yes it was queues when WoW first launched. They capped their own sales at 500.000 copies because of financial backing was low (not a technological problem it self) The servers did crash some but the over population in the starting zones was not really an issue when it came to tagging mobs.
---
Just get your kid on wow and you can do dru- wow together.
---
If this is legit, then you are an absolute moron.
---
I think you're entirely on the money, people, gaming and communities have changed since 15 years ago.
---
&gt; Do you think they could do that with side-gearing? Or maybe additional class quests that give a new ability or talents? 
---
You don't need to add anything, just change the existing talents where necessary.
---
Hell, they have an entire cheat sheet on how to balance the trees better, called "The Burning Crusade".
---
You and I could do that. But, 80% of the workforce would fuck off and ruin it for us.
---
Each layer is s different language. G fuckin G.
---
Calm your tits, its only gonna be for a few weeks.
---
Ah. How did rank work in vanilla? Is it win based or time based or both or what?
---
Thanks
---
&gt;I’m worried about hunters dps fall off late game but also my favorite class is hunter.
---
Only thing that matters is the second part.
---
Phase 1, 2, &amp; 3: Theramore Isle in Dustwallow Marsh
---
Phase 4: Booty Bay in Stranglethorn Vale
---
Phase 5: Cenarion Hold in Silithus
---
Phase 6: LH Chapel in Eastern Plaguelands
---
Horde you go North Kalimdor(Winterspring) and Alliance you go South Kalimdor(Silithus). Get as close to important shit while as far away from one of your portals.
---
ok bb, goldshire inn? ;)
---
Yep :)
---
They have stated that layering will exist throughout phase 1.
---
if they see money to be made, yes
---
otherwise they will do everything to convert players to retail
---
I'll be honest, I didn't like him much at first (cause he's weird), but he grew on me :P
---
France and Germany had their own servers in Vanilla. Australia did not.
---
France and Germany aren't getting their own servers in Classic. So you think Australia is?
---
There IS a reason, as I've explained over and over, you jsut don't want to hear it.
---
I usually don't have a feeling one way or another about streamers but I can't stand cdews face and I can't explain it =/
---
im not fussed tbh, i always thought wow was fine with 150-250 ms
---
Whats the big deal guys?
---
Hahahaha nice. I'm kind of blown away at how easy it is to abuse.
---
I've read stories here about people being griefed by streamer fans for some transgression or another.  Are you saying they aren't true?
---
If they are true then it might be more accurate to say "neither one impacts your enjoyment of the game.*"
---
\* (if you avoid them)
---
Every language's community are going to be joining the same realms because there's only going to be a few realms for all of EU.
---
Mages will be good in phase 1/2/3/5/10/classic+ etc
---
Honor based. It’s a huge time sink to get r13-14. You will be fine, just will need to pick your battles. Highly recommend rogue. Great for sneaking flags and defending flags
---
Would be great for owpvp
---
Yeah Im okay not being top dps in raids a lot of my fun is gonna be leveling and world PvP
---
they said this shit before we got servers for retail, Australia has a tiny population but is in the highest spending bracket. gaming culture is huge here, that's why PAX comes to Australia only country out side the US.  
---
We have servers for every other blizzard game including hots. we will get our own servers and theyll have plenty of people playing. i know tons of people who didnt participate in the stress test because that's all it was a test, not a launch and it went up at 5-7am on a work day here.
---
Farming elites in the world is a great way to powerlevel buddies. Don’t be in the same party. Let the lowbie get the tag then kill it for him. Just keep switching to level appropriate elites.
---
Playing today and noticed a streamer (alliance) went into RFC I noticed all the mobs for him were level 14 elites, yet my group (horde) went in and all the mobs were 1 level less? Here is proof, 
---
[https://imgur.com/IcBcKh1](https://imgur.com/IcBcKh1) shows the mobs at level 13
---
[https://imgur.com/JzaYKBZ](https://imgur.com/JzaYKBZ) shows the mobs at level 14
---
They said it was going to be just phase 1. So a few weeks up to 3-4 months. We don't know yet.
---
Yea don't get me wrong, it's going to be fun still, but it's going to be fun for other reasons. A part of me really hopes we pretty much time travel, but a large part of me has seen the growth of everything digital and social.
---
Yes.
---
Oof. That's terrible. I thought you'd log in on a different layer. Not randomly shift to one while playing.
---
138ms ping is fucking glorious compared to what we had in vanilla.  I was on an east coast US real and I can remember raiding MC with 600ms.
---
I can play an FPS at 138ms and still remain competitive.  I don't have an issue with sharing a classic server with my burger and burrito munchin American buddies.
---
This shit has to go ! This shit HAS to go ! This shit HAAAAS to go !!
---
Yes mr streamer it will a few weeks after launch .. also i think this is still not working as intended.
---
&gt; Vanilla, the very game Classic is recreating, had these introduction quests. If the first character a player meets tells them to "go kill 6 boars" and they can't even find one, that's confusing (especially to brand-new WoW players) and bad game design. That has literally nothing to do with hand-holding or retail.
---
That sounds like no changes to me, compared to launch in 2004.
---
They have to. They can't duplicate world bosses. There will be queues and maybe even free transfers onto more empty servers, assuming there are enough servers in the first place.
---
To my understanding the super server is only for backend server related things. Nothing to do with the realms and layering, it’s to help stabilize their ability to maintain and de-bug the server.
---
Lol been asking this for weeks and nobody actually answers - it's typically "the players will drop odd enough" or "it won't matter until we get there" or "no point in worrying about it, it's blizzards job and they promised it will be removed"
---
It comes down to 2 things phase 2 will bring 
---
- some servers will have 6+hour server queues (or 12k players at peak)
---
- free transfer to dead servers that nobody will want to use
---
jajajaja?
---
Aside from C'Thun, who encountered issues due to mathematical impossibilities - there were barely any vanilla encounters that were mechanically difficult.
---
These people will all quit the game within a week when they discover how long it takes to actually get to 60. True classic players don’t give a fuck about who is streaming, and will just play because it’s fun on a nostalgic basis
---
Australia has a tiny WoW population compared to everywhere else.
---
A small 10s atk speed buff won't do shit in real life.  The tauren's 5% health and 10 nature resistance wins.  orcs skill with axes is nice, but there's not many epic 1h axes in game, and  most of them are slow, which you don't want as a tank.
---
The tauren also has a hidden racial.  His melee range is actually 7 yards, instead of 5.
---
Noice.
---
That is vanilla, what were you expecting?
---
A new meta?
---
The game shapes itself. Feral is suboptimal. It is what is is.
---
&gt;how is it easier to rank up before bgs? can you get rank 14?
---
What does that mean?
---
FrIeNd Is MoNeY, tImE
---
Me: "Layering will be fine"  
---
After this post: "Layering is a f\*\*king problem!"
---
I'm not sure why they didn't just use dynamic respawns or planned server merges.
---
They could have just created Tichondrius1, Tichondrius2 and Tichondrius3 etc. Once the population dies down / splits up to more zones they could merge them.
---
Depends on your class. Rogue/Warrior not having their raiding weapon is a much bigger deal than a caster not having their raiding dps trinkets.
---
Raiders will get their weapons before you, but you should be able to get pvp armor before raiders.
---
The answer is no. If you don't have time for raids you won't have time for ranking.
---
A casual BFA player is still likely to be far more competent of a player than a 2004 Vanilla player.
---
Seriously, go back and watch some kill videos from back in vanilla. You've got hunters in MC wearing full Giantstalker gear clicking bosses, clicking hunter's mark, clicking pet attack, moving to avoid LoS issues; they don't really start doing damage to the boss until a good 15-20 seconds in.
---
Most players back then were horrid.
---
All the news coming out recently for Classic has been really depressing... looks like we won't be seeing private servers being replaced anytime soon
---
Thirdly, some people probably want to get on his layer to gank him.
---
I don't think I have once ever come across someone speaking a different language other than some spanish in my entirety of playing wow except in private servers.
---
Amount of realms released / blizzards lack of faith in the project is a seperate issue. I agree that it's not enough realms and that it will lead to problems futher down the line. 
---
The servers that aren't split by language themselves aren't the problem here, they never have been
---
Yes please. Layering, Spell-Batching and Leeway are the 3 very big problems with Classic WoW right now that in many instances will deliver a very poor experience.
---
I fucking hate streamers in my vidya
---
Could someone explain what happened and why it's bad? All I see is whining with no explanation.
---
Your original post says that you're just sitting around at work refreshing Reddit. Sounds like you already work in a place like that.
---
Rank based- if your faction has 3,000 people that that participate in pvp - there will be standings every week (if you have the most honor on your faction you'll be standing 1) if someone is standing 1 for 12 weeks straight- they'll hit rank 14.
---
Tldr: anyone playing under 12-18 hours a day ONLY pvping won't be able to hit rank 14.
---
Rank 10 is doable though :)
---
*rank system us much more in depth it's njst not necessary to go into
---
Imp Ret Aura is in the Ret tree at the top. I don’t see any misplaced words here dude. I never even mentioned conc till you brought it up.
---
Imagine you build a brand new stadium. You expect there to be thousands of people coming to this stadium. 
---
But you only built a single entrance with only two doors. 
---
"Build it like the old stadiums! That's what people want!" you hear. 
---
So when that stadium opens for the big game, thousands and thousands of people show up and are forced to go through that single entrance with only two doors. What's worse is that the food and concessions are also near the entrance. So people stop to get that too.
---
It becomes a congested mess and it takes hours for people to actually get in to the stadium. It takes so long that a lot of people just don't even bother going. Soured by their experience, they never come back. 
---
If that doesn't help, then consider this. Layering will allow Blizzard to focus the population on servers and merge them over time. This will avoid the very real problem that Vanilla had back in the day - dead servers. 
---
It also helps to spread the people out. You'll want as many people as possible getting access to this game because I promise you only the most hardcore Classic fanatics will tough out any kind of technical issue or crazy wait time. 
---
You want as many people getting in to this game as possible and making it as easy as possible for them to get in. Not doing that can seriously hurt the health of this launch.
---
I loved every minute of vanilla back in the day don't get me wrong I just think one of the best things you could do is balance classes so that they are all at least usable.
---
You scared of me and the boys taking work off and haunting your mere existence?
---
Kinda win based mostly time based, to get rank 13 you need to be in the higher honor brackets every week or you will decay and never progress, you lose 20% of your rank points every week so to progress you need to get more and more every time you push higher, rank 12-13 is 50k-55k RP so you would need between 10-13k RP just to even scrape by and progress every week. 
---
Your weekly honor is calculated against everyone else and then you are put into a bracket based on the %, so to get to the higher brackets you need to play and win a lot.
---
How could that possibly hurt the community? That will help to make it so you dont face a constant stream of premade groups that walk all over you
---
Lol our group of 3 found another group of levelers and we went to talk and they just vanished. Like what
---
Rank 14 is a 12+ hours every day for several months grind. You gain rank based on your overall standing in the honor pool at the end of every week.
---
That's uhhh, ***exactly*** what they said they are going to do.
---
Weapon training is level 10, not 5.
---
And Pserver starting zone mobs are much harder than Classic ones. Blizzard purposefully nerfed all the starting zone mobs and Pservers didn't replicate this.
---
I'd expect Blizzard to release realm names no later than Aug 1. If people are making characters on August 13th, they need to give guilds two weeks to figure out where they are going.
---
That's still a tight timeline for EU, and doesn't give much opportunity to reserve names, but at least it's slightly better than Aug 13th.
---
Should spell batching go aswell?
---
Don't worry - plenty of people on this sub believe blizzard with "fix" (change) it within the next 66 days.
---
Do you have a permit for that license?
---
You know I never thought of that that would’ve been an interesting idea Forsure
---
The gear balance is pretty similar really through the phases. It'll more come down to luck. The rogues that get lucky and get perdition's in the first few weeks and the warrior's that get BRE will have no problem cutting through people in the bgs.   
---
Likewise casters that get ToEP and some good tier pieces will be pretty scary.
---
"Social interaction" occurs when people spend a lot of time together. Better yet if they work together towards a common goal.
---
Retail WoW has almost no mechanics to faciliate this. Classic WoW does.
---
What a hero!
---
On Classic you can learn 2h before level 10.
---
[Well if I said this wasn't satisfying I would be wrong](https://clips.twitch.tv/TolerantRespectfulHerbsKappaPride)
---
All the Pservers are shutting down with Classic's launch. And with the planned 2020 copyright changes in Europe, there won't be any place to bring them back online.
---
Wow i didn't notice. *walks away emberassed*
---
Rofl, csgo with 138 ms and ul be semi teleporting around.
---
And yet we have multiple realms functioning with competitive raid clearing. We won't have as many servers as the US but we've always had enough population to justify our servers and that is why we have them.
---
Update: Corrected the chest for elemental shamans and balance druids in pp1/2. Tunic of the Crescent Moon doesn't drop until "1.10".
---
Oh it’s all good, new job is an extra $10k a year and 2/3 the hours, and I get to go home at night instead of being away 4 days of the week. When I hired on a condition of hire was that weeks leave, and then 6 months later they reneged. I guess they thought they could get away with it, along with constantly pulling stunts like having me get to a hotel 2 hours away at 8pm or drive 6 hours for an appointment or give half a day in lieu in exchange for a full weekend day away from the family. Or demanding reports written at 8, 9, 10pm at night.
---
I get that duh, but it though it was something else as that was retarded...
---
Guess I need to lower the expectations of post quality here
---
It's really not that difficult
---
Uh, I'm pretty sure the *entire region of Oceania* has larger population than Germany.
---
Or EU, for that matter.
---
I mean... Who is really winning here?
---
All depends on what class you are playing.
---
I wonder if Blizzard considered, as an alternative to layering, grouping multiple realms together for as single pool of unique player and guild names. Then, if the populations die down, they could be merged without causing any kind of headache. But until that point, the realms would remain distinct and seamless. And if a realm thrived, then it could be broken out of the pool.
---
All wow forums are dumpster fires to be tbh
---
This is false. All weapon training requires level 10 except for Polearms, which requires level 20. Until level 10, Troll Warriors are stuck with Daggers and One-Handed Axes.
---
Unless these people steal their parents credit cards, but the money some people throw at streamers, they're not 16 year old kids.
---
Too much of a ripple effect. You would have to retune the entire game. Not just percentages. That would be quite the headache, and why spend the time there when people want a “authentic” vanilla experience?
---
We all want little things here and there, but the best formula is to stick to the roots. Plus development time can be spent elsewhere (classic plus tbc etc)
---
More like pservers have them turned way up.
---
Worst excuse ever.
---
&gt;... that people on reddit from 100+ different countries are able to communicate and argue on a daily basis.
---
Ah, unquantifiable fallacy, one of my favourites.
---
Maybe you should do a quick pool of nationalities of /r/classicwow posters.
---
Shadow Priest is better PvP dps than ret Paladin.
---
This is a very interesting point. In your opinion when/what caused this change in retail?
---
layer defenders got those essays macro'd
---
Did you just refer to Wrath and "FT", for "Frozen Throne"?  Literally never seen someone refer to that expansion that way.
---
Just need rgb wires.  Then it's just custom rgb lighting instead of bad wire managei.
---
I have the same schedule as you. Our raids start at 1:30 am CST. There are tons of guilds who raid late. You will be fine.
---

---
Not exactly confirmation, so still gonna have to play the waiting game
---
Some players DO want it, hence my confusion. Read through any layering thread, there are many people who actually wants it.
---
Layering - ruining classic since August 2019.
---
I think it was stated that hots are apart of that and prehotting yourself or warlocks as a feral tank before you pull doesnt generate extra threat. There for pre hotting should be okay. This is just what I was told.
---
Layers are dynamic, not static. Just because a server has 4 layers a peak hours means that it always has 4 layers. Think of it as on-demand layering. I know this is irrelevant to the topic, but just some good to know information.
---
Oceania has a population of 40.11 million as of 2016.
---
Germany has a population of 82.52 million as of 2016.
---
So you're really really wrong there.
---
It is. What's the purpose of publicity? Spreading the word, people hearing about it. What they hear is irrelevant as long as they hear about it.
---
It isn’t false at the moment on stress test realms. I could train 2 handlers at level 8. Now wether that is because they temporarily made it that way for testing, a bug, or an oversight, I don’t know.
---
Oh, a clip of some random guy saying there were always dynamic spawns! If they were in during vanilla then they'd be in Classic already. They're not. Blizzard is using the actual 1.12 code as their reference for Classic and it doesn't have dynamic spawns, end of story. Get over it. I'm just gonna put you on ignore, this is a waste of time.
---
This one:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s52c1Ve4_7o
---
Bear druids work well for all non-raid content (and a good bit raid content that doesn't explicitly require stance dance as offtanks) and the druid grind to 60 may as well be in hyperspace compared to warriors.
---
Thats the reason they make great alts. I leveled one which lagged behind my main - i’d send it all the cloth / meat and gear I could get my hands on. Leveling 1-30 is a breeze with bandages, pots and gear (I even stocked up on Swiftness Pots to get around the map faster pre-mount)
---
You are a "sad sad individual", but it's not what you do; it's just your attitude. A lot of guys are just like you. It's simply the society we live in. You are perfectly normal.
---
Keep your chin up, eh?
---
It does not.
---
No, they were tuned in line with the rest of the mobs in the world. Blizzard purposefully stunted the starting zone mobs.
---
I play Battlefield on Japanese servers all the time.  No issues at all.
---
Hell yeah
---
Because they don't want to sit at the starter zone or 6 hours.
---
And in that regard I'm fine with layering existing because I don't have a say.
---
why did they put it in? fuck activision blizzard man
---
Don't forget the coughs every 2 minutes
---
Horde would make more sense to go to Kargath. Winterspring is very close to Org. There isn't a convenient way to get to Kargath. 
---
It's the biggest dungeon hub as well as an Outpost for selling water &amp; portals.
---
stfu and healz me
---
Yeah one dude has two costly parasites and the other can focus on what matters.
---
(Sorta /s sorta not)
---
I think it was a stress test thing, the beta has a minimum of level 10.
---
I'm really worried about how streamer culture will affect the game.
---
So I do not see the big problem. Are there still gamers from the EU that do not speak English in 2019? Havent Blizz earlier just said that general/trade/world/lfg is english speaking? And other languages can only be used inside guild chat?
---
and has never achieved anything in life. *raises my hand*
---
haha upvoted for relatability... I thought about if this is pathetic and all that I would rather lock in with my friend and rush level when the game comes out instead of making travel plans with my girl... and the solution is that this is only pathetic from others perspective but what should we care about that?
---
when it is our idea of having a good time then we should go for it as life is short enough and as long as I don't neglect my training regime, work schedules and important family stuff there is no issue here... additionally this saves me a lot of money, sitting in front of my pc instead of expensive travelling or going out spending money on stupid shit...
---
Wrath Naxx was literally Vanilla Naxx with like 15% higher damage tuning.
---
Seriously, go back and watch old fights and see what kind of tank damage and raid damage was flying around at 60, then compare it to 80 and it's so pathetic how easy the 80 version was tuned.  You had guilds full of people full clear it week one with people who never did Naxx 40.  The entire first tier of content in Wrath was cleared the week it released, it was kind of sad.
---
Front page was full of it, but if you'd read the comments you'd see a lot of support for your idea.
---
Any proof or just a salty pserver guy?
---
&gt;younglings  
---
[https://youtu.be/TWQodF6INCw](Have a look yourself) , feel free to pause if it's not your cup of tea, but you can't pull out something out of your arse.
---
How much does seal of light heal for at 60?
---
Hunters are pretty average DPS in MC/BWL (and 100% needed in both). If you don't plan to go past that then I wouldn't worry. Also, unless you are in a Hardcore raiding guild, they won't care as much about your class, as long as you pull your weight.
---
Crossroads/Astranaar fights are gonna be this nutty, I guarantee it.
---
You can be a 'decent' pvp'er with rank 10 set + dungeon pieces. You'll be ok through BWL, significantly worse in AQ40 and then basically a pleb vs Naxx gear. Really though it remains to be seen how common naxx geared characters will be - if vanilla and private servers are anything to go by; not very common. Holding a guild together through  15 bosses of 40 man Naxx raiding is not straightforward.
---
That god I'll be playing EU.
---
You can't make assumptions based on the German language decisions because it isn't the same thing. This would only be relevant if blizzard had just announced that there would be no servers based in Europe.
---
He got invited to a group and accepted he didn't randomly get removed. If he invited the guy instead his game play wouldn't have been effectes
---
People who support this are people who are used to and like the ez none social gutted game play of retail...
---
I reckon alchemy would be the way to go- generally you can seek the services of a blacksmith for a tip, especially if you’re in a guild that funnels all recipes to a single crafter
---
Hope you don't regret it at like level 48 - get that strong guild support system to not tempt you. 
---
And congrats - I can't pull the trigger and do horde, as much as I dislike gnomes - alliance zones are just more enjoyable for me.
---
Zergling. Not even a hard decision.
---
That was a really condescending way of presenting your argument. You could’ve just said “queues bad”, but then you had to go and write a whole essay about it.
---
And Blizzard themselves has said that by phase two if the population has not declined, queues will be necessary. So the problem is just pushed ahead.
---
Solution: 
---
1.	Cluster a set of realms
---
2.	When tourists have left, merge these realms
---
3.	??
---
4.	profit: no dead realms and no shitty layering
---
Tanks do what they want
---
Any "Hardcore" guild is going to only be raiding 1 day a week on their mains. They absolutely might raid more often than that, but it's gonna be alt runs and item selling runs.
---
That and splitting up mains who are up for Thunderfury between main/alt runs to get more chances at bindings for the main group come later tiers.
---
Just layer the horde zones because they are gutless cowards and deserve it.
---
Sounds like you're escaping a hellhole, good on you!
---
Tauren... Mill?
---
GET HIM!
---
Yeah Kargath isn't a bad choice either, but you can also just take a zepplin to Grom'Gol. It's all preference
---
It might sound like a meme, but we've been testing our pace on beta. We can do huge packs with ease consistently and the kicker is that the paladin gives the warrior any money needed for the mount at 40.
---
there are 7+ billion people on this planet, I"m old enough to know there are idiots across the spectrum of age. If you're entertained, more power to you. If you're in it for your OWN experience? I'm sure you're not interested.
---
Finally, some good fucking content.
---
I don't think that only the People here on Reddit will be playing the game. There's just people that do not want to speak another language in thier free time and I can kind of understand that.
---
We get it, layering sucks right now. Have some faith and let them work out the kinks.
---
Nice.
---
It destroys the immersion of the game.  All of a sudden a dozen guys just disappear?  That would blow your character's mind.
---
It also messes with casual friendly encounters.  Let's say I'm a warrior leveling and I almost die, but a passing warlock finishes off an add that I hadn't accounted for.  He gives me a wave.  I loot the mob and it drops some Ice Cold Milk.  I turn around to trade it to my potential new friend, but he's not there any more, he's on another layer.
---
Fake 100%
---
I asked 3 times now for a simple 'Did you test NT vs NT' and the answer is still unclear.
---
It's more sad if you bring yourself down for doing what you like. Its a hard lesson to learn but its worth it.
---
Yes: https://youtu.be/u48WF9uIpZo?t=82
---
Starting zone mobs in Classic have a 1% chance to dodge, parry, miss. That doesn't line up with the math of the rest of the game at all. Pservers used the same math in the starting zones as everywhere else.
---
You can apologize now.
---
The biggest one was probably phasing, although it's usually completely ignored. You know that feeling when you see the same guy's name over and over and eventually you think "Hey, it's this guy again! /wave"? Yeah, in retail you don't because sharding means you rarely see the same person ever again.
---
A lot has to do with difficulty. RPGs by design cannot be really "difficult" in the hand-eye coordination sense, so by difficulty I basically mean time/leveling speed. In a way this tied to the above - the more time you spend leveling/questing in one place the higher chance for repeat encounters, and dungeons/raids - as much as I personally don't like mechanics that outright *force* players to be social, they do great job at it.
---
Easy game means quickly moving through zones, never having to rely or notice anybody. Even dungeons were ruined by LFD, which can be thought of as Dungeon-specific version of phasing. Just pick *whoever* from *wherever*, put them together, then almost guarantee they never meet again.
---
I'm lazy. I'd prefer to port to Org and hop right on a flight path (portal exit is about a 20 second walk) than to have to ride outside to the Zeppelin and wait and then hop on a flight path.
---
Disingenuous twat
---
They are getting European severs, they just won't be language specific
---
France and Germany aren't on their own continents though
---
On the beta the early zones are a lot easier than on private servers. Especially for Warriors. The mobs just have way too much armor on private servers.
---
Some random guy?
---
You mean one of three original wow developers?
---
Yes, you really can make those assumptions. Germany isn't getting servers because of population. It's that simple. So a region with half the population of Germany and only 37% of the players as Germany, is probably not getting servers either.
---
Ahh okay. So it's kind of like zones are instances now, and you can wind up floating between them?
---
If classic has good success. I'll be happy if they announce TBC Classic. I feel that was the best and most polished, made tri specs viable on all trees as well. It really was the best experience, vanilla is for the difficulty and nostalgia.
---
So blizzard did it one way but the pservers did it the opposite so they are right?
---
Its a weird chain, Every warrior becomes that warrior.
---
Guess I am. Didn't realize how little area Oceania covered
---
Self interest. They want to follow guides and reach 60 in phase one without dealing without competing for anything.
---
...then probably go gank people...
---
So? Blizzard doesn't care about that. They care about the number of players on any given server.
---
But layering doesn’t fix that, as evidenced by the stress test. Layering only fixes the issue of queues. You’ll still be fighting for mobs with everyone else. Layering =/= sharding.
---
Same as any class, once through with quests and a good group is fine. Don’t chain dungeons unless you have a good group for it. The actual bonus in levelling speed from getting a good ring or belt is very small.
---
You also have to take into account a lot of groups farming dungeons have much better gear than you will have. A lot of them farmed near bis for level 30, which is going to be light years ahead of what you will have, even through 40. It will be a lot less efficient with leveling gear.
---
And Australia is getting servers to access too, they'll just be called (and hosted in) US West and US East.
---
Yeah, pretty much.  It happens all the time in BfA (sharding), but they came up with a different implementation that was supposed to happen less often and be hard to notice (layering).  Except it still happens alot on the beta and is noticeable
---
I never said Pservers are right, I said Pservers are wrong.
---
Blizzard made changes to the starting zone mobs to make them easier. Pservers did not.
---
In order to satisfy the likely huge initial demand for classic servers, Blizzard have added "layering" as a new technology. 
---
It is a continent version of sharding that exists in retail wow. Sharding is where different zones are split up into multiple shards so there can be more virtual spaces in one locations. It is dynamically adjusted so you might notice that mobs and players disappear while you move through the world.
---
It solves the problem of population spikes and smooths out populations across busy or dead servers. Blizzard like that it solves these problems, but players don't like because of the visible side-effects.
---
Classic is going to have massive day-1 population, but over a few months that could be down to maybe only 20% of those that started.
---
If they created 100 servers, within a few months most of them will be dead and players will complain. They will then have to group them together like they do now on retail, probably with sharding. However, this is against one of the major tenants of classic, that it brings back the server/realm community.
---
So how do you have a server community but also allow 20x the number of day-1 players but still retain smaller number of server for the future?
---
Layering creates virtual versions of each continent (e.g. Kalimdor) and when you log in you are assigned to one of those versions ("layer"). This means a server can support many times the number of actual players. Over time, people will leave and layering can be turned off (reduced down to 1 layer) and you end up with a normal healthy population.
---
There are still side effects. For instance, like in the video, when you group with another player that is on a different layer you get moved to their layer (or they to yours). The effect is that everyone you had seen in your original layer disappears as you move over. 
---
People are also worried about the potential misuse by deliberately switching layers to duplicate gathering nodes.
---
However, Blizzard have said they intend to turn off layering by the end of first phase of Classic (following its phased release) as they believe the populations will have normalised by then.
---
Layering is a reasonable solution to the problem. The alternative is sharding, which no one likes, or just limiting the populations per server - but this means server queues - also, that no one wants, as it will kill classic before it even starts.
---
Fighting against 200 people is better than 1100, if you don't agree, have a nice day.
---
I would argue that because you've played Alliance for so long that might be a good reason to do the swap. Horde leveling zones aren't (imo anyway) as good as Alliance but it's a different experience and you get the added bonus of playing your fav class :)
---
It's hard not to like the dude.  He started at the bottom, he's ugly, and he don't know how to act right, but he managed to overcome all of that and be somebody.
---
He's a little rough around the edges, but he's pretty genuine overall.  He's a greedy loot whore, but he did teach me how to ethically farm noobs in Legion.
---
There really is no full win scenario for blizzard during the initial launch. They remove layering to just have massive server Qs people will bitch for more servers, which leads to dead servers in the long run which is worse. They let it be a shitshow letting 10k+ people in then people bitch saying they can't find a single mob. They keep layering and you have nonstop doomposting like this of clips from their favorite streamer. They only have 2 months so don't expect some brand new developed tech to fix this.
---
Curious where they go, but probably just end up keeping layering and let the doomposters go ham for the few weeks/months it takes to remove layering.
---
gross.
---
Since weapon damage controls rage gen, the only thing you need as a warrior is weapon upgrades every 5 to 10 levels.   I wouldn't worry about other sorts of gear if they're speed running.
---
If a dungeon QUEST has a significant weapon upgrade, then I do it. Otherwise, I don't. You can't depend on drops and the armor you wear doesn't help you kill mobs faster nearly as much as weapons do.
---
Damn, your last paragraph sums up my whole experience the last 2-3 years. As much as it sucks I’m glad to know it just wasn’t my outlook or my own personal experience.
---
Well they are not helping prevent it either with layering working as it does and not having official non-English servers.
---
Unlikely, while the bosses themselves aren’t difficult for casual guilds the real issue is trying to kill the before the top tier guilds on your server. 
---
In vanilla our guild (top 1-3) had a monopoly on world bosses we always had the required 20 odd people online and the bosses would always die within 30 mins of spawning. The hardest aspect was killing them while the opposing faction would try to grief us
---
It was genuinely a re-post.
---
Its more noticeable these days due to the more fast paced rotations, its not as bad with simpler rotations.
---
This has nothing to do with idiocy across ages, or with women watching streams. Merely the fact that what you're calling younglings are mostly 25-34 year old men.
---
&gt; That was a really condescending way of presenting your argument. 
---
Coming from the guy who starts his post with "How anyone can defend the use of this technology blows my mind." 
---
&gt; And Blizzard themselves has said that by phase two if the population has not declined, queues will be necessary. So the problem is just pushed ahead.
---
No. Layering is what is in phase 1. By phase 2 the layered sections will be one big server. The reason they are doing layering for launch is to avoid the stadium with one entrance example I just gave you. 
---
Imagine if instead of one entrance they come out with amazing brand new super cool technology of ***extra doors***. Ooooohhhh. Ahhhhhhh. 
---
That way more people can enter the same stadium. Granted, you might be divided by sections at first, but overtime the stadium will become full and you can roam about and meet everyone. 
---
&gt; Solution: 1. Cluster a set of realms
---
OK with you so far. 
---
&gt; 2. When tourists have left, merge these realms
---
Gonna stop you there. Blizzard already learned this lesson back at the launch of WoW. Merging realms is something they want to avoid for a number of reasons:
---
- Merging realms, especially a low pop realm, will kill that server's identity. You guys talk all about how you "like to play with people you see as you level." Merging realms absolutely will destroy that for people. 
---
- Some people like low pop realms. Yeap, believe it or not, some players like the close nit community that low pop realms can offer. 
---
- Getting a huge influx of new, never before seen players / guilds disrupts the destination server. 
---
- Merging servers is not 100% flawless. People will have missing shit or "lost" characters. Happened all the time. 
---
&gt; no dead realms and no shitty layering
---
Neither options is without it's pros and cons. If it feels like I'm talking down to you, it's because you're talking about a subject you don't know anything about. 
---
You also lose the right to feel offended when your opening statement in this thread is, "People that support layering are dumb."
---
wait a tick... we didnt have a launch day 6 months ago?
---
Yes i was just making a point. However, it looks like a triple crit windfury proc so its probably higher than even 95%
---
it's.? anyway they! even words all what just mean do
---
Classic got me a better job!
---
Same here brother, I play fury rn but best believe when classic come out I’m going arms
---
Who said that ?
---
I agree with that statement, but I don’t agree with the solution.
---
Interesting, I guess it would be possible to arrange deals with these power levelers. I'll give you some chanting mats now and you'll give me back double after a month. An investment.
---
They are getting servers
---
As a rogue I just sap them, kill the pet, /laugh, and go back into stealth for the rest of the gank.
---
Oftentimes if casual guilds have trouble finding the numbers individually, they will recruit for the night from other casual guilds
---
And I asked what evidence you had of this being a change? Ant proof it wasn't like that in vanilla or are you just going to link another vid comparing pservers to classic?
---
I think you've got it mixed around. You think the cost of the conveniente is worth it. I.e. that the positivite impact of the convenience outweighs the "invisible cost".
---
The point I'm trying to make is that when adding convenience to the game "the cost" needs to be examined. The convenience of an automated cross realm dungeon party tool cost us server communities to some extent.
---
That's just cause they dumb though.  Look at all the dumb motherfuckers that think poor people are the source of their problems.
---
And so is Australia. They'll just be called (and hosted in) US West and US East.
---
Thanks for the explanation, this is exactly what I've been trying to find
---
There's no evidence to suggest they will be hosted in the US
---
It’s not backpedal specific. Toggling walk stops leeway. Ice armor slow and hamstring prevent leeway. It’s movement speed based and entirely scuffed.
---
I played on a 20 megabit (I think I got about 2-3 megabytes/sec download, and about .5 megabyte/sec upload) back in Vanilla on cable internet...
---
That is way overkill for WoW data needs, this mechanic was acceptable then, just as spell batching was acceptable.
---
I don't see an issue with either to get the feel right.
---
Can't wait to stance dance again and switch between 2handed and onehand/shield in pvp.  Hated what they did to warriors after WOTLK. Altho the same goes for all classes.
---
I vaguely remember around 2.2 or 2.3 that Blizzard increased all of the reputation gains for 1-60 content. I remember they increased the reputation gained from the Winterspring cat quests at the same time and people got salty about it.
---
I might be misremembering. It was definitely between 2.0.1 and the launch of Wrath tho.
---
Thank you very much for your insightful reply! I will look into all of this. Very much appreciated!
---
As a rogue player who will have a hard time gearing up, yes.
---
Yeah I won’t have the time for hardcore raiding so I have my answer thanks man :)
---
To be fair, I never meant this subreddit alone.
---
Time to earn more DKP IRL!
---
For fuck's sake, yes there is.
---
If all of Europe is only getting a handful of servers, then a playerbase a tenth of their size can't sustain one. Blizzard will force AU players onto US realms because otherwise, AU players won't have a sustainable population.
---
The no layering crowd doesn't realize the sheer scale. It's not going to be busy, the servers are going to be *unworkable*. In 2004 servers topped out at ~3k players and they had HUNDREDS of the fucking things. If you didn't choose the right one it turned into a ghost town.
---
So they want to have fewer "realms" and pack more people on them to avoid having a diaspora. The early launch of the game isn't going to have 4k-8k people trying to play on a server, it's probably going to have 20-30k. The game will not work anywhere, at any level, with a population like that sharing a single instance. *The playing field isn't large enough*. Layering at least makes the game playable at all level ranges until the population settles out. Then everyone who wants to play classic has a *busy* server to play on and a unified instance.
---
Ei uutta Jonnereaveria pls
---
The entrance metaphor would hold if it was the first two zones, like they said it'd be to begin with. It's more like the stadium itself is split into a bunch of smaller stadiums, even though the whole point of stadiums is everyone getting together in one place. Tourists that aren't committed wont make it to level 20 anyway, and if they do, the population's generally spread out quite a lot by then.
---
...side note, 15k per server is idiotic. Even 10k would be underestimating Classic's potential quite a bit, 15 will probably be a disaster.
---
So you think Blizzard, with the only true source of Vanilla data, that has repeatedly said their main priority is an authentic Vanilla experience, drastically changed the starting zones for Classic only?
---
You're an idiot.
---
If you're a "heavy class" like warrior,paladin, shaman, focus hunter or lock. Their pets won't do big damage to you.
---
Same if you're playing rogue or druid, focus hunter and lock in priority with sealth. As a rogue you Can easily get away from the pet aggro.
---
I'm not a huge player too, i telling you what i would do in those PvP situation
---
I play on NA and I occasionally ran into problems where my dungeon/raid group would speak Spanish or Portuguese. I imagine its 100x worse for EU servers.
---
Thank you I am now enlightened
---
Do what makes you happy. The worst thing you can do is not enjoy your life and do what someone else expects you to do. If you can look back and say you enjoyed your time with no regrets then it doesn’t matter!
---
Persevere, save up for good gear. Practice pulling mobs.
---
Maybe duo level with a healer
---
Is u for real?
---
Lol no. I'm not keeping track of all that shit. If you gave me enchanting mats without a need for upfront payment, there's no reason I wouldn't just keep them. Sell them on the Auction House. They don't have a deposit, so you have nothing to lose.
---
Even there you don't as some bosses don't hit as hard, and having dps go off faster also means a shorter fight, which makes up for the extra mana used by healers.
---
Me and my friend planned on duo leveling but he’s bailing on me :(
---
Ha! with highest lvl60 speed being 4day+, no one is doing week one Rag kill.
---
Warrior's on PS servers are easily twice as hard to level as warriors on Classic.
---
Warrior's on PS have virtually no regen. On Beta you can stack spirit and regen like crazy.
---
In Vanilla I would sell (for gold) SM cath runs for groups of people wanting to power level alts. As a level 60 feral druid we would do the dungeon in 2 pulls.
---
I'd round up everything outside the chapel and then pull it into the starting hallway using LOS for any ranged or casters. I'd have the people leveling wait outside until I had already rounded up everyone near the entrance for good measure. Then we'd do the inside the church in one pull as well.
---
As a druid I could tank / kite everything outside the chapel basically indefinitely so would have them finish looting the previous run while I got the next one started. (I'd leave their group and use CTMod to auto invite people who messaged me a specific word that I'd change for each group).
---
I can't imagine a frost mage would have any issues doing the same with some combination of frost barrier and mana shield. You'd probably be faster than I was. What may be an issue for you is lockouts because you'll be clearing so fast and then you'll have downtime.
---
I don't understand why people say "a big ass shard", layers are 200 players on the beta, same as a shard.
---
Looks like a typical retail warrior with transmogs.
---
It’s not the same. Of course I play any kind of sports when I have the chance but I know that I will never play as good as some of the guys on competitions so I watch them for inspiration. I watch them thinking I’m gonna pick one of his moves maybe. I want to learn something from them.
---
The same goes for video games; I remember the days when only the good and very good players were relevant to the streaming industry and now you’re telling me that kids watch them because of their personality. God, don’t they have a better role model in their life? I guess this is the actual problem, kids looking up to mediocre players, ignoring completely what a game has to teach them.
---
Sad times fam. It ait easy being a tank. Luckily grinding in classic enchourages cooperation so maybe you can float into lfg for dungeons. Everyone needs tanks and healers
---
I absolutely know you're wrong there and would be happy to have the manager of my credit union draw up a contract and hold both our money in escrow. Let's make it one year of subscription time.
---
On a Voldemort server I played on the best thing to do was set your pet to aggressive and just stand on top of the spawn. The pet AI would target the mob before any player possibly could.
---
Saving the fuck out of this comment
---
You the real MVP
---
Sad part is I’m going arms... mostly for pvp but also because the people I’m going to raid with have plenty of tanks but not enough dogs
---
Wait, you actually think raids want imp ret aura?
---
&gt;ilikeartica 
---
Yes yes you were wrong and now you want to run a tangent until this guy who showed you up stops replying we get it. 
---
Move on dude. It's a big and beautiful world.
---
I at least spend more than 3 mins in the main sub. Here it’s clustered with weird ass entitled anti streamer garbage.
---
I'm fairly sure we're arguing the same point be we are both to stupid to realize
---
This is conjecture, you cannot say that there will be no oceanic servers based on this 'evidence'. We don't even know the exact number of European servers.
---
Why so angry? No ones showed anyone up...?
---
Warriors are EXTREMELY gear dependent in pvp. It will require a fair amount of time before you can be a wrecking machine, but it won't happen at all if you're not a skilled player.
---
Having played warrior vanilla through TBC I would not recommend it to somebody with limited play time unless they were willing to deal with getting squashed for a pretty good amount of time before they're geared enough to actually be competitive.
---
So are you playing alliance or horde?
---
Every class is going to get stomped by the people a couple raid tiers ahead of them. That's just how Vanilla worked.
---
If it makes you feel better, I'm raising kids, traveling the country, writing books...
---
And all I can think about is Classic WoW, too. :)
---
I'm torn as well. I leveled a few Alliance characters to 30. I really like the cities and their zones, but Shaman is very fun and the Horde just have superior Class\Race Combo aesthetics in my opinion.
---
&gt;No. Layering is what is in phase 1. By phase 2 the layered sections will be one big server. The reason they are doing layering for launch is to avoid the stadium with one entrance example I just gave you.
---
One big server yes. If not enough tourists have left, this means queues. Has that gone over your head?
---
&gt;Merging realms, especially a low pop realm, will kill that server's identity. You guys talk all about how you "like to play with people you see as you level." Merging realms absolutely will destroy that for people.  
---
&gt;Getting a huge influx of new, never before seen players / guilds disrupts the destination server.
---
This will also happen with layering. New guilds you've never seen before appearing in phase two when layering is removed.
---
&gt;Some people like low pop realms. Yeap, believe it or not, some players like the close nit community that low pop realms can offer. 
---
There wont be low pop realms since no more than a few realms per region is released.
---
&gt;Merging servers is not 100% flawless. People will have missing shit or "lost" characters. Happened all the time.
---
Fucking lol mate, what an argument.
---
&gt;If it feels like I'm talking down to you, it's because you're talking about a subject you don't know anything about.
---
I have the same feeling about you. And I also have the feeling that you probably haven't played the game without the technologies of CRZ/Sharding, because otherwise you'd have your pitchfork out with the rest of us.
---
Thanks for reminding me there are 15 year olds on the internet too
---
Don’t you have an economy to ruin, boomer boi?
---
Both of those factors were incredibly depressing to picture dictating someone's life. Which is why you're probably spot on.
---
That’s right - I told them about competing at launch and that the date would be in July or August. It’s actually written in the contract
---
I think you might be underestimating how quickly a group of the same 5 people doing the same dungeon will gear. You might not get all 5 people with BIS gear, but the dungeons actually aren't that hard. I don't think the difference in gear between anybody doing the dungeon grind to 60 will make that significant of a difference when compared to what the beta players are getting done.
---
It’s hard **to** like the dude. He’s very easy to dislike, the smarmy, snotty nosed beta male.
---
For sure. Actually I wanted to know, If I’m getting smashed even when I’m pre geared and the others are in most of the cases too.
---
Rightfully so. If a streamer wants something than the entire server will be bent to satisfy his whim. His rabid fanbase will make it so. Asmo wants broken tooth? You better cancel your tame pet channel even if you're almost done because the nobility and his enforcers take priority.
---
Thanks. What means “geared enough”? T1?t2?
---
Doing each dungeon once is pretty solid. A true speedrunner will not do it, but if you are even the slightest bit more human and less robot, its worth it.
---
It's a really effective leveling strat. My guild in TBC did this for our alts in prep for Wrath. Good times...
---
I feel bad for not proofreading:( I do work remotely so had to resign by phone.
---
Do not underestimate how truly deadset fucking retarded streamer fanboys can be
---
I'm not parading my argument as fact, I'm speculating. But at least my speculating has a decent argument based on what we know.
---
The Blizzard employee used the word "several".
---
When have you ever known that word to mean more than a handful?
---
Bring back sharding! At least you could limit it to starting zones. There's so much rare shit at the higher levels everyone who feels like cheesing will get with ease. Those rare, unique items were the backbone of Classic!
---
"And when everyone's super... no one'll be."
---
\~Abraham Lincoln
---
I mean, I get that there is a large population of players who dont understand or enjoy this, but some do. It's kind of cool in its own way to be able to organize large-scale groups and do things as a community. That's one of the things many fans love about classic - the sense of community.
---
The chat channel spam is obviously an issue, and it sucks to have to pay attention to where the major streamers are going to be to avoid this, but after we do that it shouldn't really (hopefully) be an issue for us.
---
I don't think its child-like to want to be a part if these big events, and I don't understand why everyone wants to make this an Us vs. Them thing. We're all classic fans looking to enjoy the game - live and let live my dude.
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if they kept layering on. Why would they make more servers if they use layering to 1) save money and 2) keep the servers from dying.
---
Worst case: Layering will be in Classic throughout all of its existence.
---
Really depends on how geared you are in comparison to who you're playing against. With that limited play time you will always be running into groups of players who are more geared than you.
---
Just depends on definition, Malaysian and Indonesian players played on the oceanic servers and Indonesia has a population of 264 million
---
Because it happens with every single release that has lots of hype surrounding it. People who normally wouldn’t have any interest in playing get caught up in the hype and decide to try it out.
---
that makes perfect sense, thx for the heads up!
---
I was there in the beginning when classic came out and even though it was ages ago I don't remember being dodged, parried or avoided so often in the classic start than now on pservers... 
---
given that there is a big powerspike when you reach lvl 10 I guess it makes absolute sense to treat the starting mobs differently up to level 10 or so... looking forward to the "real" experience soon :)
---
In a 1v1 scenario with relatively equal gear, yeah, you'll get smashed. The classes you can beat will be hard fights and there are some classes you just won't be able to touch. Warrior is really only a strong PVP class with a pocket healer dispelling them.
---
Man thanks for this post brother!!!
---
Whatever you say, Tom Brady.
---
Imo, you have it backwards. You *want* soul link when you have shitty gear for PVP. You survive longer to enable you to kill shit. You wouldn’t want to spec over to destruction without good gear, you will not have the horsepower to blow anybody up and will die quickly. There’s a reason the duel tournaments ban it, haha.
---
I just found out about the leeway issue... phew this doesn't look good at all, really needs to be fixed asap :&lt;
---
There isn't really a "no layering" crowd, it's a "controlled layering" and "alternative solutions" idea. Really read to the crux of what they're saying.
---
This is repulsive. I'd wager a large percentage of these wankstains are retail players.
---
thank you!!
---
This doens't bode well period, this is the clearest sign so far that Blizzard has an extremely low expectation for the success of this project, and in either case that's bad.  If they are right, obviously, this won't be nearly as exciting if only a handful of people play it, and we never see anything past launch, and if they are wrong, the first 6 months are going to suck...
---
when all the frenchies eventually converge onto one server they won't feel any incentive to speak english anymore
---
Azuregos and Kazzak. Those two mobs are the entire reason why Blizzard has been so adamant that Layering will be turned off in Phase 2. Otherwise it's infinite pieces of raid gear being thrown into the pool.
---
I was leveling on the beta server with my friend, and my blueberry kept coming back to me as I left combat (had sent it to tag another mob). 
---
So I sacrificed it for being an asshole. And... then resummoned him. 
---
I need more badges. (Or old pet AI is just really wonky).
---
There's still a cut though. Also it will be limited how much money will be in supply so those mats are worth a lot more gold later on. Only way is if you invest that money into other trade goods and items that dramatically increase in value later on and I have a feeling that the power grinders will be hoovering those immediately.
---
I'd like to do level but I work overnights and my schedule is kinda off
---
Well I won't platitude you to death with "it's all fine as long as you enjoy it hurr durr" but are they attending their kids' baseball games, traveling the country, going to music festivals, writing books, etc. *every day?*
---
As they say, social media is someone's life highlight reel.
---
Yeah seems pretty crazy that they would definitively decide on oce servers 8 months before they decide on EU servers but who knows.
---
It’s ok, see you in bfa
---
I could see that being the case. However, like I said, there’s logistical issues. 2 rather large ones are:
---
1) The biggest one would be that Classic would, more or less, become a new game. Money would easily be better spent on the development of an entirely new game that is simply Classic-WoW-like (which I’d totally be ok board with—would preorder on announcement). 
---
2) A vast majority of players are not interested in Classic WoW because the mindset of “been there, done that,” which is truly a valid point. New content could remedy this but if Blizzard didn’t make it clear that Classic would go that direction from launch, it would hinder the experience for those who didn’t play at launch due to not knowing there would be content added. 
---
I’d totally be on board with Blizzard adding content, but I’d really prefer they told us a flat Yes or No and never change their minds so I know how to treat the launch. Content getting added means I’ll devote more time to the game. No new content means I’ll just play it casually. 
---
I don’t know how others feel, but maybe if Blizzard decided to add content, but simply do it on a newly launched server, then I could maybe hop on board with that. The issue there, though, would be creating another major issue of players who have been playing Classic already basically being told to start over.
---
Why is this downvoted?
---
yeah that is kind of annoying too
---
A fraction of a percent will clear KT to get MoM mace. Orc is the best PvP class no contest.
---
Only LH will shut down, under the condition that blizzard delivered a classic that people wanted. All the others wilk stay up or havent made an announcement.
---
I work early mornings until about 3 or 4 depending on the day so I have about 3-4hrs if I wanna maximize my time
---
/remind 3 months
---
It would be pretty stupid to speculate on the possibility of oceanic servers based on a vague statement on an unrelated post.
---
Adjust for the cut...
---
First you talked about wanting to vendor quest rewards because it's money in your pocket now.
---
Now you're talking about not selling the enchanting materials because they'll be worth more later.
---
Yeah, okay. You're talking yourself into circles.
---
We must admit that Illidan, Arthas and Deathwing were badass villains.
---
All these complaints are hilarious. How does general chat spam on a stress test annoy people so much. People are having fun, send Reddit to the rescue.
---
That's not easy at all, you first have to build up a social network with people on different layers.  Then one of those must be online at the crucial moment, and then you have to contact them and hope they invite you in time, all the while you are being attacked by the pvp-er .  That sounds like an easy victory in most of the cases.  Once again the great majority of players won't bother
---
Bless you kind soul.
---
I don't feel like 'cash in' is the right thinking here. That was early Blizzard. Yeah they liked money, but it was a passion project. All the stuff that was cancelled or moved to TBC was a labour of love and in my opinion brought the best expansion we ever had. I think they moved, adapted and improved on content and systems, rather then cashing in on half baked stuff.
---
FeelsEUman
---
&gt; He thinks layering isn't live yet
---
Should we tell him?
---
Layering has the potential to destroy 3-4 weeks of our classic experience while no language specific servers effects basically our whole experience! It is a HUGE topic and we need to discuss the heck out of it. NA players don‘t care and they act like we are nitpicking but NO!!
---
Not even sharding (yes I am talking about sharding not layering) would‘ve that negative impact on communitiy building!
---
You won't be raiding more than 1 night a week until AQ is out.
---
Very cool kanye thank you kanye
---
It's not at all unrelated.
---
They're limiting the number of available realms in Europe to such a low amount that they can't even give them different realms for different languages.
---
One of those languages has 270% the playerbase as all of Oceania. So if they're not getting a realm, there's a good argument that neither will Oceania.
---
would you trade it for a post-release addiction?
---
I think you are meshing two different things into one, Germany are sitll getting servers in Germany, they are just making all European servers one language, that is different not creating servers in the southern hemisphere. I will be very surprised if there isn't at least 2-3 Aus/Oceanic servers.
---
I hate you, I envy you and I love it.
---
Nah. I actually just wrote that but whatever. 
---
I’m not really defending layering, I just don’t want them to keep it in the game for longer than a couple of weeks. 
---
I’m ok with it existing but it has to be tweaked to prevent exploits. If it’s done properly we will hardly even notice... unless you’re a streamer fanboy and are absolutely DESPERATE to get on their layer. 
---
I think anyone who truly wants no mechanics to deal with population flux is either a troll or completely clueless to the world we live in.
---
No I'm thinking keeping the mats for later. If you can get by not vendoring, which is entirety possible for warlocks, then the best way would probably be to just DE your stuff and hoard it until the economy stabilises.
---
Idk, I kinda want to see that Winterspring raid. There’s a blocked off raid portal in the demon area of Winterspring.
---
That's what they *want it* to be. Ion's been very careful to lawyer his language every time he talks about sharding/layering/whatever they're calling it this week. They've never made a concrete "layering goes away after X weeks" promise.
---
I don't think it's going to be that small of a percent. The whole point of this is that there's a permanent vanilla WOW sitting around. The original run of the game was only 2 years. You really think that after like 4 years there won't be more people clearing Naxx especially given that everyone already has sound strategies for every aspect of the game?
---
It has nothing to do with learning the language.
---
Yeah it's got me worried. I won't be playing if we don't get an Oceanic server.
---
First, that's not how you use the bot.
---
Second, you're off by 18 days.
---
Third, put your money where your mouth is.
---
That could have been funny but I have no idea who Tom Brady is.
---
As a priest, if u get the jump first, focus on the pet and stay near their dead zone so they can shoot at you and focus on Hunter. Fear pet if needed. If they get the job on you, fear pet asap and close the distance.
---
Probs had a job lined up before leaving lol. Hence the humor flair. Think outside the box.
---
A lot of east coast Australian FFXIV players get better ping to Japanese servers than US servers. I'm in Adelaide and get better ping to US because of some weird routing.
---
Tauren melee master race?
---
Of course you don't.
---
Ehhh... it's kinda only Frostmourne left...
---
Yes, but the reason Germany isn't getting their own server and the reason I'm speculating Oceania won't either is the same.
---
I can agree with that, like putting limits on how quick you can swap between instances per amount of time to avoid gross abuses and locking you to a zone during a pvp encounter.
---
I think the community should accept it is simply going to change some things (like world pvp and having a consistent set of rivals as your level), that's how it works when the best approach to launch is packing the servers with 10-20x their anticipated final populations. The higher level zones don't work with that level of population sharing a singular instance, even if modern hardware is powerful enough to support it.
---
Yup. Can't help you with a name though
---
Blizz has repeatedly confirmed that camping FP is griefing.
---
Do you have a source?
---
It's also variable, some people will experience over 200 ping, considering the state of Australia's internet and geographic size. I find it hard to believe they won't implement at least one OCE server.
---
Aspect of the pack appearing and disappearing bug:
---
[https://clips.twitch.tv/WildGlamorousAsparagusCoolCat](https://clips.twitch.tv/WildGlamorousAsparagusCoolCat)
---
Yes, but Blizzard has no servers in Japan.
---
You don't need a lot of players. We have more than enough for a PvP and a PvE realm.
---
WSG exit portal?
---
I just had to download the new classic. Thanks!
---
Yes, that is what they said. I wouldn’t be surprised if they came out and said “we decided to keep layering for phase 2 because the population is much larger than we expected. We know this isn’t what we said we would do but we weighed the pros and cons and this is the best solution.”
---
To add to this, I think the game might be using an incorrect formula to calculate haste. Instead of dividing attack speed by (1 + Haste), it seems to be multiplying by (1 - Haste), so haste ends up with a form of exponential scaling.
---
For example, I tested 2-second fireballs:
---
With 10% haste from berserking:
---
Expected: 2 / (1 + 0.10) = 1.82
---
Actual: 2 * (1 - 0.10) = 1.80
---
With 30% haste:
---
Expected: 2 / (1 + 0.30) = 1.54
---
Actual: 2 * (1 - 0.30) = 1.40
---
30% haste is actually working out to a 1 / 0.7 = 42.86% gain in attack speed, which seems to line up with what you observed.
---
Me exactly haha
---
I pretty much just logged out after seeing how my boar spazzed out.  It kept dancing around the enemy each time it lot agro like it was throwing a fit.
---
You say that, but the numbers tell a different story. And if those numbers tell the same story to Blizzard that told them Germany doesn't have the population to sustain a realm, then Blizzard will (or already has) come to the same conclusion about Oceania.
---
It's actually not the same at all. It's an engineering solution to an engineering problem that usually people don't understand while demanding it doesn't happen. And when posts like this remind the people that they said it would only be live for a few weeks, the response is "they could be lying." It's not productive in any way.
---
Haha no shit! Thank fuck. AUS rep
---
Maybe he meant mental younglings and not physically young. It's not like we can see the people typing.
---
My two warriors friends, a shaman, a hunter, and a priest are just going to grind dungeons from 20-60. 
---
cleave city baby.
---
Pure evil.
---
I love it.
---
Wow. You are having a bad day. Lets see.
---
First, first time trying to use that bot. How about telling me the right way instead of being rude.
---
Second, yes I know.  But I dont need to reapond telling you your wrong at the 7 day mark after release.
---
Third, I can help you get a job if you need money.  Its much easier then trying to verbally assault people into betting money on things you are guessing at.  There are better things to do with your life.
---
They're still getting realms in their geographic location. Blizzard has oceanic servers for all of its games, why would classic be any different? The infrastructure is already here.
---
Mount hyjal
---
Unpopular Opinion: they should add dungeon/raid finder and flying mounts
---
And then everyone who wasn't in a guild with a week one Ragnaros kill cancels their subscription.
---
oh ofcourse, that's why I mentioned in classic, much simpler, slower paced game
---
Damn that was badass
---
It won't be anywhere near 138.
---
Joining a raid of 40 naked females of w/e race is literally the first thing im gonna do. Obviously. We will run to the enemy capital and dance for jokes.
---
Yeah that works. There are a few ways they could do it but I’d never say no to more class quests! 
---
Long reply:
---
I think simply moving into TBC is the obvious path forward. And while I’d play the hell out of it, I would ultimately be disappointed when they could have created something “new” for us by taking the game in a different, but similar direction. 
---
I’d love to see a “Classic+” type server that would keep the Vanilla spirit in it’s philosophy and gameplay but also redo the zones on Azeroth, rebalance talents and abilities from the expansions. Recycle characters and models but add a little twist to how the factor in. 
---
I’d want them to keep the gameplay on Azeroth with ground mounts because there is so much space on Azeroth to use before thinking about Outlands, Northrend, or Pandaria. Keep the players as consolidated as possible. The world feels so much more alive when the current endgame content is closer to the leveling content. Creating a far off land or an additional continent with a new main city makes the original zones empty and it is pretty depressing to see every zone in the original world go to waste like that.
---
Change the story up; Chromie fucked with time and it could have all sorts of consequences that I would be 100% ok with... as long as we get them in a game that keeps the Vanilla spirit as it’s top priority.
---
Maybe I missed something back then but why did we go to Outlands before going to Northrend? Was there a specific reason for the timeline? It always seemed to me that Arthas took a very long time to react to the defeat of Kel Thuzad. So what if Arthas actually invades Azeroth in 1.13 and we get an alternate storyline with some changes to some of the original zones on Azeroth? It would be a hell of a lot more work than redoing TBC but it could be really interesting if done correctly.
---
Sure, but better some gather, than none. Currently, there are about 40 registered German PVP server guilds listed on the forums 2 months before the release.
---
I'm 100% okay with a day 1 clusterfuck.
---
Classic players can’t play as Death Knights, Monks, Demon Hunters, Horde Paladins, and Alliance Shaman. Adding a few extras like Balance Druids and Protection Paladins is less of a stretch when looking at it from that perspective.
---
I feel like only morons are upvoted in this thread
---
&gt;People like you want to gatekeep the community that built WoW
---
Ok, but that’s not what you said at all.
---
It's not about infrastructure. It's about population. And Oceania gets thrown in with North America on ALL of those games. There's no promise you'll ever connect to a server in Sydney when you play those games. You're just as likely to connect to one in Los Angeles or Chicago.
---
Who cares? He is resigning!
---
Barthalis has the horde population. Additionally because of layering it's likely we will have 1 or 2 realms with multiple layers which we know disappear. We have the population the sustain one realm at the minimum likely two. Op said we had 30k players in the last 30 days, retail is in a content drought it's reasonably safe to assume more players would be active after 8.2
---
After a quick google search I discovered he’s a hand-egg player. As an Englishman I refuse to call it football.
---
Lol you think it wont??? People make capital raids, and raids for fucking around allll the time. First thing I'm doing on launch is making a raid or joining one of naked level ones and running to the enemy capital to dance.
---
The biggest improvement you could make would be burning that alliance flag. ;)
---
dude we all go on with our lives seeking enjoyment. each person will find enjoyment in other things in life. if you want to live by society's current definition of what is the normal thing to do even if you find no enjoyment in it, by all means we're all free and that's the best part of it.
---
If you enjoy what you do, as long as you are hurting nobody, there is nothing wrong with it. when you can settle to live by this motto, you will feel so much better. Just don't shackle yourself by your previous choices. everyone changes his mind thousands of time in life.
---
Dude says he wants to PvP, why are you talking about weapon racials? Get out of here.
---
I hate to be that guy, but it's pronounced "data", not "data".
---
Windfury by itself isn’t *that* scary. Unless they all crit. Windfury procs twice in this clip, both off the auto and off Stormstrike. So 0,20 * 0,20 comes out to a 4% chance of this happening. With 50% crits on them, we can assume some lucky critting, too.
---
I though that other servers had pet issues, but classic is much, much worse.
---
You're assuming that the reason they aren't separating by language is because of population
---
It will be in as long as blizzard needs.
---
By October you and everyone else with an opinion won't care anymore.
---
Basically a tool to seperate people in the same area into manageable groups.
---
With the massive interest in Classic, plus the adherence to the original spawn rates, there would be dozens of people all trying to kill the same mobs without any shared mob tagging.
---
It would be a nightmare.
---
It can also very easily be abused in WPVP.
---
Where’s the under construction signs?
---
He is so pretentious and theatrical.  I watched his deadmines world first. He kept repeating : We will not wipe, I said we will not wipe. I guess you have to be in for some cheap drama
---
I logged in a few weeks back to do the zandalari troll quests so I'd have a lizard druid available for the next expansion.
---
Spent a large chunk of last night on the stress test tho.
---
probably has more to do with the state of the game.
---
BFA is shit.
---
&gt;	vendors 
---
I mean, sure, it’s available exclusively to 1-2 top players on the whole server after 3-6 months of grinding WSG every day in the top premades.
---
Yup, its just about done.
---
I'm french and I can tell, that exactly what will happen. I wish for non-french speaker to not be on this realm, it will be an unpleasent experience for them
---
Popular opinion : we're now more fed up with layering posts than layering.
---
Now get off my lawn, will you ?
---
THIS!
---
Well I OP means if he went back in time to the age and place in life he was when Vanilla was a thing he would still play, but for Classic given the place he is in life he won't.
---
I know this Thrall is objectively uglier. And yet I find this model of him so much more sympathetic and I can't explain myself why ...
---
I'm really not guessing and if you knew the preparation and support staff some of these guilds planning a week one Rag kill have in store for launch day, you'd change your tune fast. We're talking 80+ other people helping 40 gear up and level fast, with summons anywhere in the world, extra gold, materials, loot, etc. Dedicated teams running the same dungeon over and over, not caring whether they're getting any XP at all. Characters that will be leveled 24/7 with a team so they'll have time to get pieces of gear and the necessary reputation to summon Rag. They've been practicing their leveling routes so hard and so fast, they've got it down to less than 100 hours. And they've been practicing MC with greens and blues, over and over. They only recruited people with no children and no work commitments.
---
These are the people hating on twitch, streamers, their followers and using zoomers unironically, if you ever wondered.
---
Yep, like a week after thanksgiving would be my guess.
---
Yes, because that is the ONLY reasonable explanation.
---
Roughly 30 horde vs ALOT of alliance by the end of it
---
What if Blizz had released all classes for both factions, what would be your pick ?
---
I would go for Tauren paladin and Dwarf shaman.
---
Sorry that I picked on your nation hehe. It'd be the same for germans, spanish, italians, i.e. the countries with the most inhabitants.
---
It did until people started spamming invite request for fucking streamers layers. Ruined the whole thing.
---
I’m in a guild
---
No, Australia has consistently had a small WoW population in comparison to everywhere else.
---
I look forward to seeing if they manage it.
---
Don’t bash me for this, but can you explain this better?
---
No, windfury weapon is 2 extra attacks. Windfury Totem is the one with 1 extra atrack.
---
Donald Trump: “Stone Cold Loser”.
---
Yup doing the same, which one did you go with? I was looking at the Jarvis desk.
---
The source is in the game. Login with anything under 200ms and your light will be green. Mouseover it and it will say green is "good".
---
Joue en Français, je vois pas où est le problème !
---
(play in French, I don't see where's the problem)
---
"I want to pvp and be like an off tank"
---
Probably Paris, as the distance between Sweden to Paris is equivalent to the distance from North Carolina to New York. And Paris would probably be the closest location to you
---
Changed your tune indeed.
---
If that your reasoning sure, I simply disagree.
---
Germany will not get their own language-servers because Blizzard may think there is not enough German speakers - BUT - they will still get their own hosted servers which will not effect technical gameplay.
---
That is different to Australia not getting their own servers because of demand and therefore their technical gameplay will be greatly reduced in quality.
---
Haha that tauren hitbox and melee range is really big.
---
Tauren Rogue, easily.
---

Locks are fantastic in PvP, Warriors can pack a punch but you can beat them with Soul Link spec and enough stamina. Rogues the same, but honestly best class vs rogues is Orc for the stun resist.
---
The problem is there will be unofficial. German, French, Spanish, Italian, &lt;insert fav language&gt; servers after some weeks and I don‘t want to be the german guy realizing I rolled 40 levels on the now French (or Italian w/e) server.
---
This is crazy, but I think I was in this guild. I played a Warlock named Lucain.
---
 fucking aids.
---
/r/theydidthemath
---
They seem talented and capable to me. They just need the proper direction.
---
I honestly think there’s only gonna be like 5 or 6 servers. I expected around 10 initially but it sounds like it’ll be less. I think most people expected way more than that even.
---
Even if none of the attacks crit, it'd still be over half the mages hp gone straight from the start of the fight. Most likely one will crit with near-BiS level 40 gear and we're in 75% territory. It's poorly played no matter what the damage output happened in the clip, though, because the potential is always there and why take the risk when you don't have to?

In that case everyone should be forced to play at 800x600 resolution.

I’m really wondering whether they release L60 PvP blues in Phase 2 or only have the old L58 versions until Phase 5.
---
I agree with you, doubting anyone will get near Rank 12 before WSG comes out. I think Phase 3 is great to have those rewards in tandem with their competitive BWL drops. Like, if I get Ashkandi / CTS, I’m not gonna bother farming R14 weapons.
---
Not on a pvp server they haven't.. If you're on a pvp server and are complaining you're being camped then move to a pve server.
---
He would have to purposely leave but yeah he has the option of jumping layers if he has someone to invite him on another.
---
Only in combat spec then, like the renegade Taurens in Stonetalon.
---
I can't see a Tauren backstabing with daggers !
---
Blizzard doesn't consider it "greatly reduced in quality" because it isn't. Anything below a 200ms ping shows up as green/good on the UI.
---
Blizzard would rather have a few forum posts complaining about a less than average ping that doesn't really affect gameplay at all than have to explain a completely dead server to their board and shareholders.
---
Possibilities:
---
1) Gatekeeping
---
2) Unnecessary shitting/attacks on stream viewers
---
3) Bad additive
---
I once duelled someone on a teldrassil branch for the "epicness" and instantly MC'ed them off the tree.
---
Was in gold shire having nice convos about the stress test and what people thought about the game and sharing vanilla memories, then all the sudden gen chat was flooded with people requests invite to some dude named assmongold  later. Literally hundreds of spams asking for invites. Ruined the whole experience.
---
Ok, let's say laying is for X and has Y side effect. You cannot then claim that layering was introduced to solve Y when that's not why it was created.
---
In lock V lock you can banish their pet to prevent them from using any of their pet abilities.
---
I agree.
---
If only the people at Chernobyl had Bubble+HS.
---
Okay that's fine I can accept that, although I think you're missing the point, The reason OCE players are concerned with not having a local server is due to ping/performance related effects that playing on US servers will have to us. In relation to Germany not getting a language specific server that is minimal as they will have access to low ping EU servers and lets be real a lot of German people actually speak and understand english too, its not a big deal as opposed to affected performance that would occur without an OCE dedicated server
---
PServers were more wrong than people thought. This should not be a big surprise. The amount to rep rewarded will all be part of the data held in the 1.12 database. There is no reason to believe that classic is wrong and PS is right. On PS servers everyone leaves the starting zone as revered, whereas I distinctly remember only being honoured back in the day.
---
2 servers with layers just sounds so disappointing to me. There’s more than 2 private servers with &gt; populations than blizzlike in vanilla running even today. They really need to have at least 5 or 6. But I assume they want to push for the retail model which is less servers and more layering.
---
Going to play priest and try to get a list of pocket warriors.

Ooh, I completely misread his combat log at the end there. That's my bad. somehow skimmed completely over the first [you died.] and read it like one collective log. My b my guy. :)
---
I'm getting 170ms in the stress test.
---
I was mostly a burning crusade player not vanilla. I raided a lot as a mage getting all the way through sunwell and everything. It occurs to me that what I remember mage being, I raided as Arcane, does not exist in vanilla wow right. Arcane mage, as it was in burning crusades, was just not a thing right?
---
I'm asking this because I'm waffling on going nostalgia mage or trying a new class, and if at 60 mage is unrecognizable to me anyway I may as well try something new.
---
Why would they put a specific ANZ release date for classic, if they aren't making ANZ servers?
---
Im 26 and do the same. You are old and washed up. I'm a fresh youngster that already lost al intrest in real life.
---
I don't know whats worce.
---
wow very informative
---
tauren warrior: who needs a hunter anyway :D
---
Yes you missed something ^^ EU will not have language based servers. (Last blue post annouced it)
---
Will we be able to change our gaming language? So the quests I see will be in languages X and you can see it in Bulgarian? And we chat in English?
---
Or we just have no true data.
---
Noone cared about rep at the beginning of wow. It was only later we all started to understand why we needed it. There is no doubt in my mind that classic is right and your reference point is wrong.
---
I get the concern. I'm just saying Blizzard doesn't care.
---
And I would argue that having to play on a realm full of various languages you don't speak and full of players that don't speak your language is a much bigger detriment than having a slightly higher ping that's still half the heartbeat of the server's spell batching.
---
Your whole argument is floored.
---
This is about OCE players concerns for performance problems based on being forced to play on US servers.
---
Whereas the Germany situation is purely based on convenience of having a language supported server, they will still be able to play at low ms.
---
i.e Performance vs Convenience
---
I truly hope that if a large enough contingent of French, German, Italian... speaking people were to proactively petition Blizzard, they might change their opinion. Although I think it would talk a we’ll organized effort.
---
Maybe if all the people who rolled on EU private servers banded together and petitioned. I just think if you have a large enough group asking Blizz the right way they can’t ignore you.
---
Best of luck on it though I sincerely hope something gets worked out on your behalf.
---
&gt; That being said I'm pretty sure his comment is more of a exaggeration/joke. 
---
This, not actually going to abandon my kids for WoW lol.
---
Well these are obvious ones but it's what I do.
---
Keybinds
---
Show action bars and lock them.
---
Turn off profanity filter.
---
Turn on instant quest text.
---
Turn off sticky targeting.
---
Turn on npc names.
---
Turn on status text for health and resource bars.
---
Turn on cooldown counters on action buttons.
---
Set my scrolling combat text.
---
I better roll a ranged class.
---
I never argued that the concern for Oceanic players getting their own realms and the concern for German players getting their own realms is the same.
---
I'm arguing that the reason they won't get their own realms is the same.
---
This is exactly my opinion.authentic expirience gone. We need to get blizz to reconsider language realms
---
u so crazy.
---
Seems like he'd already died one before vs the shaman, which makes his carelessness seem even worse.
---
So the Oceanic players know when they'll be able to login to the US-based realms they have access to with their subscription.
---
Very much this. I dont care if your english is broken and if its very bad I will try to throw some french at you (either google translate or my gf is she is present)
---
And people can always make french, german or italian guilds only.
---
Don't join classic as it becomes available. Wait a few days to see on what realms will the streamers and their minions be and dont be on that realm. Once layering is off you shouldn't see them anymore.
---
I agree but assuming they keep their promise it will go away eventually but that doesn't mean it should be left unbalanced/heavily abusable when it's around lol.
---
[https://www.avoidstreamers.com/](https://www.avoidstreamers.com/)
---
&gt; intrracted with 6 - 8 people lvl 6-15.
---
That's still way more people than I've ever interacted with in retail for the entire leveling experience :P
---
If playin against a lock depends on the pet but ideally you wait for fear and pet ability to drop and get out of it with trinket or whatever you have to do so, then youll focus the lock with fast moves and interrupt their fear attempts. Pet cc got a shitlong cd relative to length of average pvp bout. For a hunter depends on pet and spec of hunter. Most of the time root the pet and kill the hunter. Big thing with hunters especially in the war of attrition you lose every time so stun pet and shit on hunter asap. Hunters have really predictable damage spikes centered around moves they cant move for so LoS and the deadzone are the key to the city for them.
---
So join the realm they won't be allowed to play on: https://redd.it/by3nd0

Hey HokageBill. I sent you a bnet friend request and I'd love to talk Classic with you. I can give you the same info dump as all the other guilds or we can talk on discord, whatever works best for you. Wildgunmen#9537  
---
Regardless of your choice, good luck in classic and may your axe arm be mighty!
---
Yeah I think this is the right answer. In one of the interviews where they were specifically asked about TBC and Wrath servers (at the same event) they said they were open to that.
---
There is this one simple solution to layering.
---
Wait 4 months before playing.
---
Hi, /u/ChasewayTV

---
How did you help an enemy faction player do it? Never done the quest but that sounds wholesome.
---
 you think they are hosted in EU?
---
Engineering is a commitment, one that many will underestimate. My advice would be to level with mining + other gathering depending on your class and connections, if you're a leather wearer and know a leatherworker then go skinning and ask them to craft some of the nicer pieces. If not you can go either herb/skinning and use it for profit but for your mining lookup one of the classic profession levelling guides, they usually list how many items you'll need to level, so send all your mining mats to a bank character so that at 60 you'll have most of the mats to just powerlevel it, engineering takes a lot of mats though so you'll probably still have to go farm some more to get it to level 60 materials (Thorium) and getting it to 300 takes a lot of Thorium.
---
It does not make sense for Blizzard to put the oceanic servers in the US when they have a server farm in SYD, There is just 0 logic to this.
---
I have the same mentality, but in the weekend I will probably be spending a bit more time gaming throughout the day and I expect his mother to take care of him a bit more there when the game is fresh out!
---
Shit, didn't know everyone had the pleasure to deal with 5+ major European languages on one single server. 
---
I can see how amazing it will be to have French, Germans, Italians, Spaniards and the English let lose on one single realm with a max concurrent population of 3000. 
---
This will be a grate (private server) experience...
---
I hate when people overuse this phrase, but I legit think that this change will ruin it.
---
Good on you for sticking to your guns. Obviously it’s terrible for most people to do this, but from reading through your posts you got a job with better work flow, hours, pay, and get to experience classic how you deem fit. 
---
Well done indeed.
---
Enchanting you wouldn't be able to keep up with your own actual level. Not enough enchanting mats
---
I hope you do know that the beta is mainly open for streamers and a few random (except during stress test) and since it's mostly content makers at beta that's what they do test the game and have fun making content.
---
Most off the time they are just looking for some pvp since the lvling is capped and most people at that cap (30) : there is no "endgame content" at this cap so all they can do is derp and pvp around? 
---
How people will act generally will change, barely 10% off the players will be content creators at live...
---
If you let your hype be killed by some streamers having fun then I guess gaming in general ain't or you...
---
Or you know, because Rag isn't out at launch...
---
Pets were in vanilla - there were hundreds of pets before they were ever offered in the store.
---
Doubt it
---
As a warrior I don’t mind it
---
Now you know how all of the Alliance felt in vanilla.
---
The reason why I love his stream is because he is real and isn't a pussy. I hate streamers who are afraid to do things in fear of losing subs, or who act "safe" in order not to embarrass himself. He is also extraordinarily honest, he interacts nonstop with his viewers (in a tasteful way). He is in the core a disagreeable guy, which might push away guys who are more agreeable.
---
You know you can do quests outside the 1-5 zone with a group of people even when they're red? It's even efficient to do so if the server happens to be overcrowded.
---
Well we will agree to disagree then, I don't think you can determine what Blizzard thinks or considers.
---
No
---
An underwater raid zone like SSC off the coast of Azshara would be cool too. Raiding Dalaran in Alterac would be interesting as well. I agree with the Scarlet Crusade raid thing as well though. And it would be cool if they would get a little more creative with the concept of the Emerald Dream and let us enter those portals that the world dragons guard. Opening the Azshara Crater as a BG would be sweet, but x-realm is a requirement then, otherwise it'd thin out the PvP population too much. Opening Hyjal would be great as a lead-up for TBC Classic or something.
---
It's ok, I just won't be on those servers.
---
You misunderstand. There aren't going to be dedicated realms for Oceania. They're simply going to have access to the handful of US realms. And they pay AT&amp;T for every minute those servers are online. AT&amp;T charges a lot more in Australia than they do in the US. A dead server won't just be an embarrassment they'll have to fix, it'll cost them money.
---
How much are those monitors?
---
 Imagine going to a stadium with 50k people, cheering n shit and then you get layered into an emtpy one lul in africa.
---
That sweet, but for me it's a big difference. When you are fluent in a langage, you think fast, you can explain something the way you want, you are more precise and you feel way more confident. It's beyond just chating with someone, it will be less immersive, it will be less social.
---
I'm playing video game since decades, and I can tell why I love World of Warcraft. There is many reason, but one is it's the first online game I played in french, with people speaking my language. It's so much confort.
---
thx for the link man, good to see that i'n not alone with my 'streamer' problem.
---
I very much doubt it, they are not adding lootcard items that were made available in TBC so I think anything after vanilla is out.
---
Cartography sounds cool
---
If there was a dutch only server I would avoid it.
---
Another dutchy here.
---
this is the best shit i have seen today :D
---
Imo iam happy they got scrapped.. they dont add much to anything besides extra work.
---
Come think of it.. who would have taken those anyway? If a third crafting job would be possible then maybe. 
---
Also they would have split your other jobs. Like being herbalist but you cant make potions because you are cartographist and so on.
---
Blizz transferred you for free in the past for yhis.
---
I just read the blue post. Are they crazy ?
---
Like there will be at least enough Frenchies to have 1 PVP and 1 PVE (same for Germans).
---
They're shooting themselves in the foot.
---
They're either really far off with their pop estimation or they really don't want classic to succeed.
---
I know they are. And you can too. Just look up the hosting for every realmlist domain. For instance, LH uses a hosting provider in France.
---
generally yeah good idea ;) but it requires some running I don't think there are starting areas with a tavern on horde
---
But it is the PS meta of mount swapping that is driving the question.
---
&gt;I don't see Twitch chat   
---
&gt;ever  
---
&gt; outside of Twitch and very, very certain platforms, e.g. this sub's Discord
---
you'll see twitch chat in certain youtube videos, games and reddit subs
---
"twitch struggles to ever break 1 million"? huh? that's bullshit. fortnight alone gives them 200k+ everyday. even now at the WEAKEST hour you have more than 600k views. with big tournament it will obviously reach above 1 million easily. it's also strange to me how you claim to know so much about twitch yet you show a sort of withdrawal to anything related to the twitch culture and scene. like you use the platform but you hate it at the same time or what
---
&gt;Maybe I missed something back then but why did we go to Outlands before going to Northrend? Was there a specific reason for the timeline? It always seemed to me that Arthas took a very long time to react to the defeat of Kel Thuzad. So what if Arthas actually invades Azeroth in 1.13 and we get an alternate storyline with some changes to some of the original zones on Azeroth? It would be a hell of a lot more work than redoing TBC but it could be really interesting if done correctly.&gt;
---
The story reason for LK taking so long is... it got retconned to have never happened in Vanilla at all. I'm sure that the dev team was rolling in a hundred directions (in a good way) for content at the time. I mean the Vanilla devs have said they wanted to do Dragon Isles, Kara, Hyjal, etc. So they were probably planning on doing more with Arthas, but at the same time they were already looking forward and had plenty of TBC done.
---
As much as I would love to, you being on beta means you are on US (or Oceania) servers, and I'm EU so unfortunately that probably won't be able to happen. Always down to help out on here though.
---
I don't have to determine it, they're telling it to us.
---
I feel like this deserves a lot more than 35 up votes...
---
First time around I didn't play wow with rl friends. This time around I'll be playing with my brother-in-law and his friends. That's all I'm stoked for. I'm probably only going to sub for 4 months and quit. It'll be a little fling for me.
---
He might mean one of those windmill things around tauren settlements. Which one though, we may never know.
---
If it is not an issue for you why do you think there is no issue at all? I am russian, and in this post you seem to be complaining about people not knowing english in 2k19. Your complain seem worse that what you are complaining about, if you ask me.
---
What I am more annoyed about, is why we cant use game language which is different from the server language? In retail I must every time exit the game, go to settings, and manualy change language to be able to play on EU after playing on RU, for example. I am 100% sure, classic is like that too and thats realy damn unconvinient for players who have characters on both.
---
Troll druid/warlock
---
I also don't see the big issue people have with layering, I am all for the classic experience but waiting for respawns in the starter areas bc of 1000 people being there... think I can pass on that
---
I am more a fan of the mechanics of classic I don't mind some technical improvements to the world/stability/smoothness
---

The first group realized it, they didn't all end up in the same group by accident.
---
I throw out heals and buffs and potions to basically everyone I meet, Ive got your back bro.
---
How do you know he was speed hacking? All the speed hackers I've seen move a hell of a lot faster than that.
---
They give out free server transfers. Or you can stay in your high pop server. Something blizzard has done and said they will do again.
---
I dunno, I was all over at different points in Wrath. 
---
I played hardcore 10man content (84th 10man, 0 death ToGC). I played casually in T8, I didn’t even get the Immortal achievement (to my eternal chagrin, fuck you swamplettuce, you found a new way to die every fucking week). By ICC I was back in a top US 25 man guild. 
---
ToGC sucked presumably because you “had” to run it 4 times a week? Not really though, when I did no death 10 man, my greater 25 man guild couldn’t clear normal Anub. So we just sorta did it way it was supposed to be done, with shit gear and an ounce of skill along with patience. 
---
When my team got picked up into a hardcore guild (our 10 man combined with a mutinous core of a 25 man guild), we instantly went to full clearing all of ulduar 25man hm and ToGC 25 heroic. All that remained was 0 light and trial of insanity, neither of those are gear checks. The need to run 10m ulduar 10m ToGC evaporated immediately. 
---
Regardless, our guild was top 20 +/- 5 through ToGC and ICC and no one except people who just enjoyed pressing their buttons felt compelled to run 10 man.
---
Gear doesn’t stall progress, being a bad player does. Method and top guilds have traditionally cleared raids with lower ilvl and certainly with no guides vs the average heroic/mythic raid. 
---
All that said, from a hardcore pve standpoint, in raid, WoW has gotten consistently better. Their release pace is on point, the actual raid bosses are always fun. They hiccup with artifact/garrison/Azerite mechanics and class mechanics but the fights themselves have always been good. 
---
If we are getting into turning points, I look at the TBC patch where attunements, 1-60 xp were both nerfed, where heroic dungeons were made easier, when they released a bunch of daily quests. That is when WoW changed. Peak “endgame” WoW was when Black Temple was the top of the game, add in every specs preferred iteration from Wrath - MoP bring back vanilla rpg elements on top of the early Bc endgame and you’ve got my best version of wow
---
Whoah that’s a lot of text, may be high...
---
Everything is a hunter weapon.
---
No, not once did Blizzard state (as you say) that 200ms is no different to gameplay than 5ms.
---
&gt; I hope you do know that the beta is mainly open for streamers  
---
How many streamers have beta? They are at best 1% of the beta population.
---
&gt; barely 10% off the players will be content creators at live... 
---
Lol. Maybe 0,0001%
---
Let's not get carried away...
---
I don't know, with that layering stuff and now this no specific langages servers, I wonder sometimes if they trully want to make it a success.
---
When french will make an unofficial french server, it will be a hell for the non-french speaker.
---
And also, the only french guild, who will have absolutly 0 interaction with the other player.
---
God that bad...
---
The key to speedlevelling is :
---
1) never die (except when it shortens your travelling time ofc). You got to be very careful with every pull as a warrior.
---
2) never wait. If you don't have a "premade" dungeon group there's too much risk you're going to have shit players in it (unskilled, quitters etc) or that you will wait a lot (you want to go in Wailing Caverns but the tank is in Hillsbrad).
---
3) good route
---
4) kill speed (but it's the least important of the 4 imo).
---

I think we have the Ant Man Bug in WoW Classic WSG PvP....
---
I think the poster you're replying to means one or two for Australia, which really doesn't need the 9 it has on retail. And why on earth would you assume they want to push for a model of less servers and more layering when they've straight out stated they'll have layering gone by phase 2?
---
Exploit then? Wisp form 100% of the time while flag carrying.
---
Exactly, question was answered by another reply if your interested
---
After hearing the news yesterday and getting the impression that Blizzard are preparing to fail with Classic I also predicted the same 5 realm set up for Europe (6 if they give a RP-PVP realm)
---
Not entirely true. Any hardcore guild would expect you to raid the shit out of ZG and to a lesser extent AQ20 as well. Having 2 40 man days with 20 man's intermixed isn't too farfetched.
---
The problem with vanilla raiding is that most raid tiers have some items that are relevant until you start getting naxx gear, so when new raids open up you might have to raid even more.
---
Sounds very ignorant to me.
---
Yeah, for this reason I won't use Questie for my first playthrough. With my alt(s) it might be different though.
---
Layering doesn't bring these people. If it weren't for layering the streamers servers general chats would look like twitch chat instead of this
---
nope its still very different at level 60, at least 140 attack power worth of damage more on pservers
---
I think you need a better chair! Or is it because im not wearing glasses?!

---
By that I take it you don't consider ZG a raid? Which he would be raiding every 3rd day.
---
I would say kill the warlocks's pet (except voidwalker)  because they're not tanky and very dangerous to you (they have a lot of CC) but don't bother with hunter's pet (too tanky and no CC on you except a very short stun if BM spec).
---
I just ordered a printed flag of the scarlet crusade emblem. We‘re gonna have a lan party at release and i wanted some dope accessoires for it :)
---
Lol you're so wrong more than 1% in beta are content creators. Bassicly every content creator got a key (even those that never played wow). It's a big part off the beta population.
---
And yes in live maybe 0.00001% wich proved my point even more...
---
Im fine with 2 weeks. So everyone that took time of work can make it worth it.
---
Indeed it would have been awesome, especially dungeons maps.
---
 We know dungeon maps were planned but they didn't have enough time to make them, it would have been cool if you would have to work to obtain them. 
---
It could be a nice bonus when finding a group just like being  a key master. You have the dungeon map ? you get group prio just like having the key.
---
I must say that throughout the Stress Test, I have received more group invites for just questing than I got in Wrath, TBC, or Cat. Similarly, the random drive by buffing happens all the time and people will actually stop to help sometimes just because they see you’re in a tough spot.
---
I have been so taken by it, when I had a good run of finding greens today that I couldn’t use, I wen’t to Goldshire and just randomly gave them away to lower level people who happened by. I hadn’t done stuff like that since early  vanilla, when I’d make a bunch of gear leveling tailoring and leather working, then go to Northshire and hand it out for fun.
---
Needless to say I’m going to be hooked again for a while at least.
---
i hope someone makes a boomers be gone addon that filters all the terrible players
---
Takes max 1 hour and only requires 20 ppl.
---
There has been hate on him for a long while, nothing really changed. I like him though.
---
let the warrior tag it and then help kill the mob
---
I hate traveling. Even going outside to do the groceries is a pain to me. Being able to explore fantastic worlds and have epic adventures without leaving my house is the best thing ever.
---
Not the guy you replied to, but I have a night shift 11-7, 7 nights per week with a random 12 during the week where I work 11 to 11. Finding a raid group to accommodate this is going to suck.
---
Phase 3 will have more organized groups.
---
Phase 2 will be more random since you have to find enemy's to kill.
---
It’s a known bug, not an exploit...
---
Also, saber mount vs horse.... Come on man go nightelf
---
Wow. Alliance players actually downvoted your comment
---
I just can't logically see them wanting to risk putting tons of money into creating new content when a lot of people just want TBC and WotLK again. The simplest answer is usually always right
---
Check out the latest Countdown to Classic episode with John Staats. Basically, he mentions the philosopy of non-Tier sidegrades in form of resist gear. Resist gear might not be as cool as Tier-Sets, but it can be an effective tool against power creep.
---
While I agree with the idea that giving hybrids sets that will increase their off-spec utility, I think it's worth keeping the value of resist gear in mind.
---
If you take a possible Scarlet Raid for an example, you could focus the gearing process on aquiting Holy Resist Gear in order to progress through the content. The possibilities are endless: you csn have certain boss tactics involve a specific resistance threshold to survive (see: Ragnaros, Baron Geddon), have a mechanic requiring a specific item (see: Onyxia Cloak for Nefarian) or even a sub-area or room having a debuff that can only be survivable with Resist Gear.
---
This way the already overpowered Naxx Gear would not be the meta gear in said raid, as it doesn't have the required resist stats. The raid would obviously be locked behind a difficult attunement, but it wouldn't be necessary to have Naxx fully cleared to enter it.
---
Gear that drops from said raid could be a mix of off-specc gear, resist gear and just other random items - without exceeding the quality of Naxx Gear.
---
it's the hair line, believe me it is!
---
never before has a relatively low res count given so much information about the hair of a character
---
they should add it to scribing and let it finish off places on your map you have not been yet also to make the flight path toys and such.
---
TIL!
---
This is what happened to me at the end of Vanilla.
---
I couldn't raid and everybody was in AQ / Naxx.
---
Solo PVP was absolutely unfun, I was a free kill.
---
In BGs I had to stay in the pack to be able to leech VH.

hey mate, sorry i didn't broach on that topic but I am definitely aware of the event sequence you are talking about i.e being able to retroactively apply a seal if you are quick enough to get the seal to activate based on the last melee swing.
---
I was having a quick scout just before and sadly I could not track down any video footage of it being done; I am not at my rig atm but if you or anyone else is able to provide a recording id love to write about that as well.
---
Cheers,
---
Archeon.
---
Well that is clearly an exploit which is bannable. If enough people are willing to go this route, layering will be gone even faster, due to massive banwaves.
---
Well considering it will take a minimum of 3 months of being the top PVPer on your faction every week to even reach rank 14, I'd say it's pretty damn impossible in Phase 2.
---
WTB invite so I can watch
---
JUST LEARN ENGLISH 4Head
---
I remember.
---
Where did they say no dedicated realms for Oceania? I haven't found anything official from blizzard for/against.
---
Tgis looks exactly like retail
---
You love Trump don't you
---
You may speak English with high enough proficiency to communicate well. Good for you. Can you say that about your neighbors and friends too? A lot of folks in their 30s and 40s will come back for Classic. Some of them will be out of school/education for over 20 years. While some need to be fluent in English for their jobs, a lot of them only communicate in their native language in their day to day life. They will speak and understand enough English to communicate at a basic level, but is this sufficient to have meaningful interactions in this social game we all remember? 
---
I can somehow understand the argument that the playerbase cant sustain language specific servers in the longterm if Blizzard has the data to back that up. But your argument about the matter is just plain ignorant about the realities and expectations of a lot of people.
---
I just woke up, and my day is already ruined. Why did i scroll so far down.. what did i expect ? Ofc there was gonna be cringy shit like this.
---
It's 2019. Why do French and German people have to dub everything? It's always been French and German options for games. English is the universal language. You have great schools so why is this an issue? Honestly, it sounds like an issue that us English speakers shouldn't invest time in.  Please enlighten me why this is?
---
Yes, they state it every day inside the game.
---
Anything 200ms or below gets flagged as a green icon, which when you mouseover it says "good".
---
Somewhat related question; Does Taurens have a longer gun/bow range since they do have longer melee range?
---
We're talking about an MMORPG... the fuck are you talking about?
---
It'll play out just like it did in vanilla;
---
* People of x nationality won't want to speak english a majority of the time and will look to play on servers with a large x population.  
---
* Eventually that population will grow and the server will become known as the "unofficial x speaking realm", which will cause it to grow even more.  
---
* Majority of server is now x nationality, majority opt to no longer speak English because it's not as natural to them, or as easy, etc.  
---
* English only speakers on said realm now fucked, need to server change.
---
This only happened on a handful of realms in vanilla because there were hundreds, but drop us down to like 10 or whatever realms and you're going to wind up with one per language anyway. 
---
So what's the issue? These things don't happen overnight, and people will wind up playing on a server that changes it's language over time until eventually they can no longer interact with people outside their core group and they'll be forced into a sunken cost debate.
---
God bless London/New York High Frequency Day Traders and their need for some of the fastest cabling in the world.
---
Very tempting to make the jump to US servers if those are the ping speeds.
---
There was a quest at the north passage to Stone Talon that involved a riddle I think.
---
https://i.imgur.com/wI0bhk4.jpg
---
I am german and I am totally able to speak and interact in english.
---
But I prefer a german community, because I learned nothing of that before the age of 12. I would say I learned 25% of english in school and improved the other 75% through online gaming, online communities and my job. And because of that, every single sentence is more demanding than speaking my native language.
---
Most of the time I will not be fully relaxed, because it is way harder for me to use english to joke and socialize during my free time than using english in my job. Especially when free time is the place where you get confronted with fast native speakers and accents. And because of this it will be harder to participate in the community.
---
In the end it will not be SUCH a big problem for me. I will speak english on a european server and will get used to. It will even help me in the long run, because it will increase my "holiday" english and the range of people I meet. But as some other germans in other threads already told (partially in a very insulting tone): not everyone in germany feels that save.
---
NO SEGREGATION. I played this game as a 11 year old Swede. Now I'm 26. Stop with the bullshit country servers. Germany and France have good schools. Get good at English. You will learn.
---
This is so embarrassing.
---
German here, I don't know anyone below 50 years old who isn't fluent in English. It's kinda mandatory for most jobs. Hell, even those family members from a rural background know enough due to EU regulations  and buying supplies/equipment abroad. Really fun part? I'm from formerly eastern Germany. English wasn't a required and often not even an optional part of the education. 
---
From a business viewpoint Blizzards decision is understandable. German would be the only language that has the population to get a referred treatment, but even we will probably not have enough players for a healthy realm.
---
If the guild/group/raid speaks German I will do so too. But if even one person doesn't understand it I'll switch to English. It's the polite thing to do.
---
Go learn English. That should be a given in 2019.
---
I would be cool playing with MadSeasonShow and that’s about it.
---
My personality is naturally drawn towards what he is, for many reasons, but I remain sceptical. Better than Hillary though, for sure.
---
(Sidenote: I'm not American)
---
They haven't which is why my title didn't say so.
---
But if Europe is only getting ~5 realms, then the US is only getting ~5 realms. That doesn't leave any room for a dedicated Oceania server, hosted in Sydney or Los Angeles.
---
I couldn't care less about not having german servers, I would've been very inclined to jump on an english flagged server this time anyways...
---
the only folks justified to complain about this are the RP people, I really don't think it's a good idea to expect folks to RP in non native tongue... -.-
---
but alas most people already stated it the players will form their unofficial language realms
---
I feel like I'm taking crazy pills... "name changes are the supposedly the least vanilla experience ever"?... you say that in a thread about layering. Layering after the initial release rush will kill vanilla and the communities interest in it
---
“Welcome to Orgrimmar, have you come to serve the Horde?”
---
Yes, I think I will.
---
Don't bother, you can't reach R13+ with a job.
---
Funny you say that.. seeing as 8 million people cancelled their wod subscription after the first month, and they stilled pushed through with selfie cam as the first content patch.  
---
8 million people cancelled their BFA sub after the 2nd month, still they dont care at all.. so yeah, blizz just doesnt care about retaining players anymore.
---
You can test it yourself on your own connection.
---
Open up a command prompt and type:
---
    ping 24.105.62.129
---
I have no clue what you're talking about https://youtu.be/oQ26LyiBlBY
---
Yeah exactly this. Just because I am able to do it, does not mean everyone feels capable enough to participate in an english comminity. Ordering a beer in english and discussing dungeon mechanics are 2 different pairs of shoes.
---
I know this is from stress test but imagine just having no idea who asmongold is and just questing in STV normally lol.
---
At this point i would happily vote on blizzard just making a streamer server only tbh, get these groupies away from me.
---
I believe you do take a hit but since said mob grants more exp naturally, it's less evident to the player that they are taking said hit. Unlike when you kill a mob much lower than you, where you suffer both the mov giving less exp and the hit to exp...it's more evident
---
Because those people are dumb as shit
---
saved for after work
---
Ok
---
Nice! 
---
We did in Vanilla a big community meeting on a low pop server, everyone created a new tauren and we all run from thunderbluff to OG, halfway the Server crashed... too many ppl :D
---
This has to be most cancerous stream I have ever seen
---
It’s a character he puts on.
---
I haven’t been on Blizz’s forums but I hope this stuff has been posted there also. Reddit and Googledocs aren’t the places they typically look for issues.
---
Maybe it’s been posted on the official forums, but since the links here are not from the forums it makes me wonder.
---
Dont you get less xp for each level higher the mob is?
---
please this.
---
I am not sure those items will be available in Phase 1
---
I have the impression that in pservers the mobs on Echo isles are way over tuned.
---
If you can't interrupt the trolls heals (and I'm not sure there's any class that have an interrupt at this lvl), they'll fuck you up even if you have a 2 handers.
---
So you either group or don't do the quests with the trolls.
---
Judging by your ability to articulate yourself I'm going to assume that you never played vanilla, as you are much too young. The queues were horrible, and waiting to tag mobs was also horrible.
---
P.S: Just because you throw in more swear words into your sentences, it doesn't make your argument any better, just sayin.
---
Doesn't really matter that it doesn't take long. It's more of an issue that it needs to be done more than twice a week. If he's already worried spending too many nights raiding saying it doesn't matter because it's only 1 hour (to be fair 1,5-2 hours if you include travel time, invite organization etc) twice a week I think you overestimate 40 man's, which untill aq release will probably be less total hours per week than ZG and in just one night.
---
I was screaming in pure excitement in guild chat when I got a red hood in hillsbrad for my troll shaman.
---
Thank god most of the big streamers are on US region. EU here boiiiiiiiiii
---
Yeah it is bad, but what can they do? For example gues how many people will want to play with Asmongold on the same server. And he logs in and there is somewhat of a 600 or 900 players IN THE SAME SPOT with him. None tech could stand this it will be like constant new expansions in terms of lags, login issues and disconnects. And now guess how many people will be there at launch... thousands of players in the same zone, perhaps a few thousands.
---
EU here and i am actually happy that they are doing this. Filters out some audiences i really didnt like to see anyway.
---
I was thinking of going something like this: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/505031015--502301512203151
---
Mostly for PvP, my question is about seal of the crusader, is it not worth judging it for the extra holy damage? Or does judging command remove the debuff?
---
Personally I don’t care about english only servers.
---
It wouldn't be possible to make underrepresented specs better with sidegrade tier gear alone due to the nature of how those specs are designed. Any gear that would benefit those specs would be a greater benefit to the mainstream specs mostly due to scaling. You would need to make spec-only gear (which would be weird) or come out with a spec balancing patch.
---
Hey - aren’t you in my guild?
---
It's 2019, why American keep re-doing french movies. Subtitles are the only thing they should need.
---
See it's the same. It's about confort.
---
If you think its boring just don't play it. Blizzard has said more or less if Classic is successful there is the potential for other Classic Expansion realms or perhaps future Classic content.
---
I wouldn't expect either for at least 2-3 years. The game is going to be an outlined 1.12 experience, and if thats actually boring for you I would recommend a different game.
---
STRIKE FROM THE SKIES, BROTHERS
---
Done it when Classic was announced.
---
My setup getting old already,that long had to wait.
---
I have 110ms from Finland.
---
Huh??? If private servers are using the wrong values that should by definition make them incorrect.
---
Your comparison isn't apples to apples.
---
Germans don't get a server dedicated to their language but still have a geographically local server; and that makes you think that OCE won't get a geographically local server…
---
Not the same thing. Language is a totally different barrier that doesn't exist for ANZ players.
---
Considering they already have the host in SYD, it's more likely than not there will be an OCE server.
---
But how accurate is that data? According to that a lot of servers have less than 100 players.
---
I feel the same. At first, i was really disappointed because I wanted to live the same experience in my mother tongue (German here) and with the older translation system (IF being called IF, Thunder Bluff not being called „Donnerfels“, etc.) it was really great to have the rest in German. 
---
Now it’s like I have this and it’s great, but will need to share more of it in English or even set the client on English completely. But then I remembered Nostalrius and how I had absolutely no problem with all items or bosses being called different, so now I think „well, it will be fine“. 
---
But I can relate to the chat or sub communities/unofficial language servers problem, it will be a big sigh.
---
The group dynamic is more engaged because tanks keeping threat is a group job. Going HAM at the start of a fight can wipe a raid and even in the middle of the fight if the damage gets a bit crazy. Everyone needs to manage their mana/energy/rage appropriately. Healers need to be on the ball all the time.
---
Meh.. i still think oceanic will get at least 1 realm hosted in sydney.
---
Human filth.
---
2019*seems like a good time to abandon the idea that a huge portion of teens to people in their 30s can't speak English. We shouldn't cater to them *not wanting to* speak English. We have a global language
---
By language be purged!
---
Of course they care. It's how they justify the team's existence to the board at Activision and it's shareholders. Every drop in subscriptions means layoffs. They let go 800 people 4 months ago.
---
It's not about english, people do speak english here also.
---
But you have like 8 different languages across the EU and you cant force anyone to speak english.
---
So as soon as the game launches you will have the people form groups and disrupt nearly any community aspect of the game, not even talking about imersion.
---
I don't remember having as much trouble leveling a Warrior back then as everyone seems to complain about. I remember being able to take on 2 +2lvl mobs at once then heal up and go again. 3 +2lvl mobs was a bit difficult or 8f a +3lvl mob came around.  Seems people don't know how to pull to safe areas properly
---
In retail WoW we already have a mix of people speaking different langauges due to sharding.  So, I don't really see the problem?  
---
As a Norwegian, and as a young teenager I had to learn English to communicate with people in MP games.  I had English in school, but the majority of my vocabulary I got playing video games.
---
Sure, but they wont bother doing anything about it in the game. I guess they'll just layoff the whole classic team once phase 2 with layering comes.
---
I think that's not the problem, the problem will be having populations on the EU servers not speaking English...especially if they will be a majority. 
---
It will be a complete lottery for EU players since nobody can predict language spread out.
---
the least they could do is give her a unique gray skin texture. it could be reused for other dark ranger npcs.
---
Back in the day all eu servers were physically just outside Paris weren't they? Did they ever open new sites?
---
How about no new system? How about they give us vanilla servers like promised? Not their recent approximations of it'd be cool if we could do it this way this time.
---
This is a game (vanilla) that has a a potential lifespan of 2 years, and yet we're re-engineering the whole world to accommodate the first 2 weeks? Sounds fucking stupid to me
---
How about making multiple small servers (old size) predetermined to be merged later (chromaggus 1/2/3/...) with joined naming rules from the start.
---
You can play with your friends from the start and you will keep meeting to same people. After the merger, more people will be added.
---
I feel this is a superior customer experience.
---
It has an impact when game developers spend more time and resources on catering to the esports/streaming crowd. All of BFAs dungeons are specifically designed with esports in mind.  
---
Not sure how much impact it will have on classic (probably not much), but it can definitely ruin games for regular players.
---
Same thoughts here at the beginning! Wanted to play the German server really hard for the original experience. 
---
Then I remembered my experiences on Nostalrius and how it was absolutely no problem for me only playing the English client, I even had the same fun like back in the day! So for myself, I’ll adapt and sigh only a little, but then play the game and won’t concentrate wether I’m writing English or German
---
When your retort to an example provided is “fucking lol mate” you lose credibility in your argument. Layering is probably not going to be the cluster fuck everyone is claiming it will be. That’s why they’re so heavily testing it in the beta. 
---
Have faith, chicken little, the sky isn’t falling yet. We’re still 2 months away from launch. Plenty of time to sort this out, and with it being a passion project by the people who got this all up and running (Thanks Omar!), it will be sorted.
---
And I hope you're right. I just don't think you are.
---
Yep. That's why sharding was put in place. Your realm is always full of players because there aren't really realms anymore!
---
That’s why they’re doing such heavy stress testing with emphasis on layering.
---
Not really.... That makes the WORLD understand. People like me, a Swede with no interest in learning France can enjoy it.  When you go English to French, now you segregate yourself from all non-English speakers.
---
This will be my desktop background for a good while.
---
Your logic is fucking outrageous mate calm the fuck down there will be OCE servers.
---
Like one of my favorite politician used to say: "It's Germany here"
---
It's that simple. 
---
My English is completely fine and I can hold a conversation, but I don't want to do that. I'm in Germany and I will play and watch things in German.
---
I mean that’s kinda the point of the beta, specifically, the stress tests, or have you not read up on those forum posts?
---
Pathetic
---
However noone under 30 would then see any 30+
---
Having a Classic server in Sydney still costs them money. They're paying AT&amp;T to run it and support it.
---
I'm not speculating that Oceania won't have a geographical local server, I'm speculating that Oceania won't have a server at all. If they want to play the game, they'll be doing it on US servers.
---
Sounds like you don't know what you're talking about.
---
I think the saddest part about it is that you felt the need to post this. Yeah, you are sad.
---
Pro tip, most people understand this by the age of 25, but you are a special case: Live your own damn life
---
I feel like completely separating the layers would be ideal.  Blizz would just need to allow players the ability to pick a layer to have their character in and have that be it until the system is removed.
---
That would make it more difficult for people to play together, but those layers could just have queues.  Maybe give layer transfers a 10 minute cooldown or something.
---
It's Germany (There) yes. But Germany is nowhere else but Germany. And you're online now. So it's not like we're immigrants in your country. You're merely a part of everyone's experience.
---
I’m still a bit confused on how layering works. Is there a guide that explains it?
---
I did the same. After two days of PvP, I made a hunter and got him to 60 in personal record time...
---
Haha the absolute state of this sub:
---
Some "content maker" says that batching is good and authentic, without it meta is tarnished etc. and everyone shills for this 2004 shitty internet connection compensation mechanic. 
---
Now another content maker leaves a negative feedback on a similar 2004 leeway bad connection mechanic and the majority goes "Reee remove it!"
---
Kara, Scarlett Crusade and Hyjal for Vanilla would make sense.
---
The logic is pretty sound. Blizzard clearly thinks a player population 2.7 times larger than Oceania can't support its own realm. There's no reason to suggest Blizzard thinks Oceania will be any different.
---
Layering on PVE server but not on PVP servers?
---
I'd say it is absolutely insane on pvp servers but on pve where getting the mobs in a premade guildgroup is priority it is fine?
---
To this IP? 24.105.62.129 Nice!
---
It IS a problem because Classic layering (sharding) is not supposed to stay for long.
---
I was on burning legion because I liked the name.
---
A few months after my first 60 it became impossible to get groups because 60% of the server is polish.  People literally asked if you were polish in groups and insta kicked if you weren’t.
---
Why the fuck does blizz want a repeat of this shit but also with french, German, Spanish etc?
---
Did you read his argument? It’s so stupid I can’t even.
---
“Hey team, we’ll implement an overly complicated technology that will completely ruin social aspects of the game to avoid people losing items during server merges”.
---
If you know just the slighest about development, 2 months is enough time to fix small bugs, not completely change a system they’ve been working on for probably a very long time. We’ll get the shitshow that layering is right now, wait and see.
---
How about no layering at all and we just suffer the first two weeks of queues and mob spawn camps.
---
That’s what it was back in the day and the game still became incredibly successful.
---
Can’t have that though.  Gotta capitalize, but also gotta accommodate the very limited patience of consumers.
---
And you are basing it off a non apples to apples comparison....
---
Yeah think I’ll wait for blizzard to answer the question instead of you.
---
There is a great episode of countdown to classic which explains what layering is, I'll give you a link
---
The logic is completely based on assumptions, subjective and not informed statement. It’s not a sound theory. I’ll return to this thread when you are proved wrong.
---
I was speaking about sharding, not layering, as a reference, how it is in retail.
---
We had one Hunter who never managed to unequip his weapon at Nefarian and died to pretty much any movement mechanic in the game. He was in the raid where we finally killed C'thun because there was no one else better qualified.
---
maybe this will help:
---
https://i.redd.it/xpz3z1ly1dy21.png
---
proven
---
And I'm just looking at the numbers. They don't lie.
---
He's still level 24, in the barrens trying to solo tribes at war.
---
Just halp everyone! The Game turns social again.
---
&gt; It shows that they missed a fundamental requirement for that spec.
---
That'S where you are wrong. Taunt was not initially a fundamental requirement for tanking. Taunt was effectively a failsafe mechanism to regain aggro if you lost it. Only later, when tauntdancing bosses happened often in raids it became a requirement. ÄIt's entirely possible to tank dungeons without taunt, it just requires a different playstyle. 
---
&gt; I regularly lost aggro on pulls and we went oom more than we should have. 
---
So what? Did you play WoW on release? Warrior tanks and druid tanks also regularly lost aggro in deadmines and forgot to use taunt. You can't base arguments about a spec on a lvl 20 dungeon. Prot paladin is a fine tank for 5 mans and for aoe tanking mobs in raids, it just requires the other players in the party to play a little differently as they don't have that taunt failsafe.
---
&gt; Risky to the point that you might as well not even bother having a prot paladin maintank. 
---
Not really. It's jsut a matter of the raid dps being more disciplined and not draw aggro. On many boss fights, taunt is still just a failsafe to protect the dps from drawing aggro. Only on fights where taunt is necessary to juggle aggro between the tanks a paladin is very bad. A prot pala maintank certainly is a disadvantage, as your MT is missing on some fights, but it's doable.
---
&gt; So victim blaming? That's a poor argument. 
---
Victim blaming? If you play modern WoW and drop into classic, expecting it to work like modern WoW, its on you. You should know beforehand, that classic is a different game and that you should read up a bit. And if you didn't, a friendly person will certainly help you out.
---
&gt; And if they don't exist? That new player spends 
---
You seem really jaded by modern WoW. The community is a big aspect in classic WoW. I'm pretty certain, you will find a friendly, knowledgable person before lvl 15.
---
&gt; Don't forget that most hybrid classes picked up whatever was good for them. In some cases you would have druids wear cloth armor because the stats were better than anything they could get otherwise. 
---
Yes, some gear hybrids need will overlap with gear other classes need. But it's not the case, that a ret paladin gears exactly like a fury warrior, nor is it the case that a moonkin or ele shaman gear exactly like a mage. There are plenty of pieces available, which only really benefit exactly this hybrid spec and as the itemization will be at 1.12 level, those items will be there. Each of those hybrids will have 6-10 items in their bis gear, which won't be needed by any other spec. Enhancement shamans also fall into this category, but do have the problem you describe, that their really isn't any gear for them. Shadow priests and feral druids do nearly 100% overlap with other clothies and rogues.
---
&gt; You miss the point. You go feral in to raid in a guild. You level up to 60, but it turns out you do not have a spot in your raiding guild because you being in the raid is a dps loss to the group as a whole. They have to bring the class, not the player. That is a failure of game design at that point. You have a choice between a rogue who you know will put out X amount of DPS and a feral druid, who you know will put out Y dps. Because of raid comp and class design, the feral druid is going to do less than the rogue. 
---
No, you miss the point. A player is more than x dps and y dps. I don't decide who I take with me into the raid just because of that. Because on most fights it doesn't matter, whether the boss lives 10sec longer, because I brought a feral instead of a rogue. And if that feral is motivated and invested into the game, while the rogue lacks those traits, I can guarantee you, I will bring the feral 100% of the time. 
---
&gt; I was just giving general examples. And if you never end up using it, or if you hit enrage, having that person in your raid will hurt your progress. 
---
If, and that's a very BIG IF, it happens, that we consistently wipe at sub 5% boss health, then I'd consider switching out a hybrid for a pure dps class. But that's nearly never the case.
---
&gt; You can give them a spot if you want to weaken your raid as a whole, but there's almost no reason to do so if you have the option to take that pure dps class (who bring utility of their own too).
---
I feel, you have a very skewed perception of how difficult classic raiding actually is. We've cleared MC and BWL with 5-10 people basically doing nothing in the raid, a hybrid will certainly outdamage those. And you are trying to tell me, I should pick pure dps classes over hybrids, so I can do what? Kill the bosses a couple seconds faster? Wow, great reason. The only really demanding raid in vanilla is Naxx and that's on the mechanics, not the difficulty of doing enough dps. 
---
Please get off the idea that taking a few hybrid spec dps along will significantly weaken your raid. Let me give you an example from Naxx, where the difference is most extreme. Say, I have 26 dps in the raid and a pure dps does 1000 dps. A hybrid does 600 dps. I bring 4 hybrids along. The raid has now lost 1600 dps. Patchwerk has 3.85 million HP. Time to kill increased from 148 seconds to 158 seconds. A whole 10 seconds longer, the horror! Patchwerks berserk timer is 7 minutes, so you don't even need 10000 raid dps to kill him. That means with 25 dps in the raid, you are fine if they bring on average 400dps, which is certainly possible for a hybrid.
---
You could say German servers will be the bottom one, when ranked alphabetically. French second to last, Spanish third to last etc. For pve and pvp respectively.
---
This way without the names, everyone will know way ahead of times which server to pick / avoid.
---
Players telling eachother You think you do, but you dont... full circle
---
&gt; The entrance metaphor would hold if it was the first two zones, like they said it'd be to begin with.
---
They neveer said this. They said it was time based. Not zone based. Why make up lies?
---
Your image is not ideal, as the hunter is moving away, which will trigger the movement interpolation.
---

Did we play on the same stress test? I felt like the boxes respawned within a minute. Had no competition for them whatsoever.
---
Buy the tomahawk from the vendor. 
---
Starting with throwing weapons is actually a big bonus in the early game, as it's the best warrior range skill (Because it does not take up an inventory slot like any other skill would), and warrior ranged weapons are very very useful. But none of the races starts with a full kit, and you have to make do. 
---
But yeah, it's the same as a lot of other factions. Humans, and I THINK gnomes also start with no 2 handers trained, and have to rely on their ~3.8 dps vendor weapons early on.
---
Also, if you are struggling for power early, Try to buy a decent shield. They make a huge difference early. Horde gets the worn heater shield, but I don't know if that's the undead starting zone only (humans have a differently named, identical heater shield.)
---
Beyond that, alchemy makes a huge difference. between alchemy and a tomahawk, you can basically do about 45% more damage over the basic 2 dps quest reward. 45% is a LOT more damage.
---
Definitely Layering. It's the only way to ensure realms will have a healthy population after the tourists leave that doesn't involve mergers.
---
I mean... I doubt that would be the case. 
---
I think Blizz realized they fucked out BFA. But they are normally already designing content for a patch out, and already working on the next expansion (I wouldn’t be surprised if they were working on the expansion after that either, IIRC Legion was being worked on before WoD was released).
---
The whole purpose of classic was getting away from layering and if they really wanted to put their stress test on full throttle they should've done it on a weekend, including the EU. I wish I could downvote this twice. No actual vanilla player would suggest layering.
---
Well as a Russian player, I can say that all the people that I know, a going to roll on a eu server disregarding the Russian reservation. Personally I agree that the sense of internationalism is a part of the vanilla experience. Although I used to play on shadow moon which had a huge percent of Russian population, I personally think that there should not be a dedicated Russian server. That would be fair to all and would let the community to adjust as they see fit.
---
You asked why we have games and shows in German, what has that to do with immigrants?
---
yes reddit is so much more enlightened! its everyone else who is dumb! /s
---
Congratulations on winning "Retard of the day" award!
---
You can just stack spirit on pservers aswell
---
I did, and his argument is logical and sound. Yours boils down to “I don’t have faith in Blizzard and fuck you lol mate”.
---
Its possible they realise they fucked up, but it certainly isnt stopping them from fucking up even more lol. Blizzard today is riddled with clearly incompetent people, all of the original talent is long gone and left is only mobile devs with no real experience, creating subpar experiences with no clue as to what customers want.  
---
Every single game theyre currently working on is doing worse each passing day, and they seem to have to clue how to reverse it. They are simply too out of touch and lack the talent to make anything remotely good these days.
---
Yeah makes sense. However, I've raed you got significant benefits from weapon skill up till 310, and still some till 315 and after that it's basically nothing.
---
It surely has nothing to do with all the streamer hate on this sub?
---
&gt;The entrance metaphor would hold if it was the first two zones, like they said it'd be to begin with. 
---
They said it’d be only the starting zones when sharding was the solution. Everyone spoke out against sharding so now we have layering. Now people are speaking out against layering and asking for it to just be the starting zones, which really just makes it sharding again. 
---
Also, these are extreme examples with streamers. Thousands of people are trying to follow them around. When they arrive at the streamer’s location and see they aren’t there, they invite the streamer over to layer hop. I’m not saying it’s okay for streamers to layer hop, but it’ll be much easier for them to pull things like this off than it will be for the average player.
---
Raid splitting and more wide usage of meme/non-optimal specs in general raiding.
---
I'm playing mainly alliance myself but will definitely make a Horde alt to try out Shaman! Windfury ftw 🙏
---
Unless you play at unusual hours or pick a server outside of your own region, how will it be any different? Evening and afternoon local time, is gonna be packed.
---
Subtitles are for make a french / italian / chinese / etc movie understandable. Why a refilming it
---
You know, in France, we don't learn that much english in school. We also protect strongly our langage. We think it's important to keep alive langage because by their structures they make people think differently.
---
So in regard of this elements, we are not that good in english, and it's very limiting.
---
Time change we are better and better in english. But not at the level we would need to enjoy and be confident around english speakers.
---
For french standards, I'm a very good engliqh speaker. And god now, it's hard right now for me to explain to you my through.
---
The perfect Druid ring doesn’t exi-
---
For this reason we planned raids with 45/50 man. Every single person received full DKP and it was possible to change those from reserve in for certain bosses if they needed a drop. The reserve usually did some farming in between to pass the time. Worked quite well.
---
wow: roc
---
They're just being realistic. They have a better idea than anyone here on Reddit, which is why they found layering to be the best way to deal with the population decline, since they are anticipating a big pop drop.
---
Yep, gonna suck losing the server lottery, I am Hungarian but speak English just fine, knowing my luck I will end up among French or German folk lmao. 
---
Rerolling to the "right" server will be a pain.
---
There are around 5000 people that were invited to beta, more or less. There are at most 200 streamers and maybe another 200 who are some kind of creator (guide writers, media, developers) who play in the beta. 
---
Source: I am in the beta and have never streamed a day in my life. 
---
The stress test was probably the worst it would ever be if you aren't a fan of the streamers. They were all funneled into one small area, and their fanbase flocked to them because this was their chance to "play with a celebrity". And even then, I found it pretty easy to ignore it and just play the game.
---
Honestly I liked leveling a warrior on a pserver. Felt like you were just some random dude who has to fight tooth and nail to become a hero.
---
Still won't be as stale as retail.
---
A layering that would check your IP and put you with the guys from your country
---
Yes i think so too - though layering will have Its negative impacts the way it currently works.
---
Best of both Worlds would be if layering Was only active for zones up to lvl 20 IMO.
---
We would have the Split up rush in the starting zones and to be honest - the tourists mostly wont even make it to lvl 20+.
---
That way high end materials and things like gurubashi chest could not be exploited.
---
I just cant get my Mind around why they would have EU wide realms instead of language specific. There are only negatives for the players.im pretty sure language specific zones like german frech and maybe eben czech would be able to fill a pvp pve and rp Realm each with no trouble
---
This isn't a case of being more wrong than we thought. Vanilla servers using the TBC DB for quest data that is post-XP squish was documented and fixed on most of the popular servers ~2 years ago.
---
Someone wrote a huge write up and gave examples on hundreds of quests to show that after level 30 quests gave 40% more XP than they did in vanilla, same goes for reputation gains.
---
The issue here is that not every server implemented the fix, as leveling ~30% faster and being able to mount swap at 40 is something a lot of veterans want but want the population of a "blizzlike" server so you wind up with people playing on those and then wondering why their 3 days 6 hours 1-60 isn't taken seriously.
---
Having 5 or 6 would absolutely gimp the oce community. Right now we have a healthyish alliance side on Frostmourne and a slowly dying one on horde Barthilas. Every other realm is dead as fuck, we really cant sustain more than 2 realms longterm
---
Can someone explain to me why this would be any different than retail?  Are there not streamers, are there not layers?
---
You guys are so whiny. The problem are not the streamers but the layering. It's hurts the integrity of the world and breaks the immersion.
---
Fucking fawns. They just want to be shown on his stream or have their name said by asmon so they feel like they amount to something even though no one cares.
---
Replacing that flag would do a lot to improve your battle station. A nice red one maybe with the horde logo? c;
---
Lol night elf
---
It did not work with other players, only mobs.
---
Is this a troll post or do you really believe 100 million german speakers who got 84 servers in retail will be the minority on one measly server ?
---
I doubt he is neglecting his kids to play games, you can play wow and also spend a lot of time with your children, just play in moderation.
---
They are a company governed by capitalism.  That involves reducing cost while increasing profit.  One of the ways this has been done over the years if with server technology.
---
They are layering because it’s the new technology by design.  Most likely it’s too complicated to redesign server infrastructure to mimic what it was 15 years ago.
---
That's crazy. Never realised how bad it got, I left in WoTLK.
---
Neither will, just like they don't on retail. You people are the same as these moronic twitch chatters.
---
In vanilla, you can still disenchant anything you need to with your lvl 5 alt.
---
How can people exist without Bagnon?
---
Sadly that would not help about the problems with General /trade chat and the guilds building on a Realm. So you would still have some realms where the majority will speak in one language in These channels after a few weeks
---
Vanilla didn't have oceanic servers so it will be the same experience for me as I quit when tbc hit.
---
Looks good. All you need to do is take that alliance banner down.
---
It's only for PvP
---
\&gt;  [/r/classicwow](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/) is schizophrenic 
---
Or you know, different people with different opinions, who clicks on threads they resonate with.
---
need to change garrosh to random panda as well
---
I think he's just wrong.  I don't see anything in the MoP patch notes about it.  He's just describing normal melee leeway, and that wasn't added in MoP or anything, it was in Vanilla.
---
And afterwards we took sentinal hill. For the horde!
---
Can confirm - Naxx 2.0. was cleared before the first reset by people still wearing T6 (from TBC)
---
It was tourist mode Naxx.  I never raiding Naxx 40 in vanilla but I did run it with approx. 25 level 70s in TBC and it was still brutal even then.  Thaddius mechanic was a guaranteed wipe if ONE person gets the polarity wrong.  In Naxx 2.0 you could outheal it.
---
Hope there is space on US servers then!
---
Cheers, mate!
---
I can speak english but I won't. I will look for a german guild and will talk german in tradechat etc. Or maybe I won't even play classic because of this decision.
---
Nah, I think the best way to limit the abuse of Layering is to limit the control you have over switching layers.
---
Let's say Character A is logged in and on Layer 2:
---
1. If Character A logs out or quits the game, upon returning, they will be placed in Layer 2.
---
2. If an Alt of Character A logs in, they will be placed in Layer 2 no matter what Layer they were in before.
---
3. If Character A joins a group with a character in a city or on a flightpath, that group member always gets pulled to Layer 2, never the other way around.
---
4. If Character A joins a group with a character drastically lower level, that group member always gets pulled to Layer 2, never the other way around.
---
5. If Character A is engaged in PVP combat, temporarily suspend Layer swapping for any and all party members until the PVP combat is finished.
---
6. When 3 &amp; 4 are not available, the group members that get Layered or don't, will be completely random at first. Once the decision is made, leaving the group and rejoining always forces the same decision.
---
7. Always force guild members and friends on the same Layer upon logging in, otherwise ignore these changes.
---
This (and probably a few other rules) would completely eliminate the ability to abuse Layering in a time efficient manner.
---
And the reason they're not doing language specific realms is pretty obvious. They don't intend on launching more than a handful of realms for the entire continent. Whatever speculation they have suggests Germany, with 20% of the active Retail player population for EU, can't support even one Classic realm.
---
That mad about herbing damn. Get a hobby. Hes got potions its fine.
---
Where there's a will, there's a way.
---
your actually a brainlet rofl. vanilla wow didnt have dynamic respawns that is something private servers added to starting zones
---
But that's how you learn English? By being forced to speak it. And that's gonna help you as a member of the EU. You can travel without a passport to any of our countries. Why would you not want (for your country) to improve in that aspect? 
---
Everybody in the world knows that French people speak French. So it's not logical to say "we need to speak French so that we don't replace our native language".  
---
It took me a long time to learn English. Fortunately, I never stopped learning. So please never stop learning English.
---
In time, perhaps you can take back what you learn and make Switzerland great again!
---
And is always so on edge. It’s hard to watch someone who’s never happy.
---
Yeah, I'll take layering. No-language specific realms will severely hurt the EU-realms, so bad. This shit will just be horrible.
---
Most people want a Russian server. We had 4 Russians in our guild who ran away from Russians because most notorious ninja looters were Russian on my server back in the day.
---
germans had their own ghettos i mean servers on release.
---
LH is hosted by OVH in  Gravelines - France
---
You don't understand? He said that his favorite politician said "this is Germany". That doesn't mean anything online. This isn't Germany???  But that is what people yell immigrants. Same in Sweden. "this is Sweden. Speak Swedish".   Read between the lines, my friend..
---
Yeah, so even if your realm was completely full (3.5k players), it likely has no more than ~400 today (unless it got merged).
---
As a warrior either go 2hand or dagger when leveling. Don't go for those disgusting 2-2:50 sec weapons as you are prone to miss alot do missing with a 2 sec weapon is devastating compared to a 1:30 dagger. Also warriors don't have % weapon damage abilities besides overpower (correct me if I'm wrong) early game. All their abilities are either a set value like revenge or so or just a flat damage add like heroic strike. Trust me, I'm leveling with dagger/shield/whirlwind axe with an addon to swap between them and daggers outshine anything. Speed is key until you get into early raiding. Usually meaning daggers until you get those sweet 1.9 swords axe and maces
---
Waiting 2-3 weeks after launch to play is never an option for you? Makes 0 fucking difference.
---
Its crazy what jealousy does to people. Make friends if you want people to play with too.
---
That’s a very poor comparison
---
It really do be like that though. Pulling 2 mobs at level is a tricky situation. God forbid a 3rd one pats along, lol
---
Last time I used it, i tried to translate " bleu " ( blue for french ) to spanish and it showed " triste " ( sad ). The correct translation was " Azul ".
---
All my friends is getting married and are having kids. They work like hell with their careers.
---
I do enough to survive at work. I dont even want a girlfriend right now. I just want freedom to nolife WoW Classic.
---
No, I bought everything at the same time last year.
---
We held that hill for quiet some time
---
Are you planning on dpsing or tanking if you go warrior? Because for dps, there are better races than Taurens in my opinion. Tauren Druid is nice tho, especially if you're gonba pick up herbalism, +15 herbalism due to Cultivation racial passive 😍
---
IMO It'll play out just like it did in vanilla;
---
People of x nationality won't want to speak english a majority of the time and will look to play on servers with a large x population.
---
Eventually that population will grow and the server will become known as the "unofficial x speaking realm", which will cause it to grow even more.
---
Majority of server is now x nationality, majority opt to no longer speak English because it's not as natural to them, or as easy, etc.
---
English only speakers on said realm now fucked, need to server change.
---
This only happened on a handful of realms in vanilla because there were hundreds, but drop us down to like 10 or whatever realms and you're going to wind up with one per language anyway.
---
Solution; Just split us officially, don't make it a logistical fucking nightmare spanning 3-6 months that leaves people having to move servers to find a community that predominantly plays in their language.
---
did it lag?
---
Is there anyone more annoying than Staysafe? We all know inviting people will change layer and somehow he's surprised, spamming "This shit's got to go DUDE" 15 times.
---
I think there are other games that provides language specific channels, being able to activate/deactivate those channels would help
---
That's pretty nice of you to help so much for .5% of their leveling time lol
---
Thankfully I'll be playing on Oceana regions this time so at least I won't see any streamers!
---
May not see any other players at all but oh well 😂😂

"After that, Josh hears from IT professional Linkson, who stops by to give further clarification on exactly what Blizzard’s proposed ‘layering’ system entails, explaining it further to the listeners."
---
There won’t be a single NE priest “running circles around Dwarf priests.” Race choice is essentially a retard check.
---
&gt;All of a sudden a dozen guys just disappear?
---
Not really sudden if you get invited and you have even the most basic understanding of what layering does.
---
It was amazing
---
Yeah.. Same.. Im currently preparing on a pserver and i always told myself "Wow it will be so much better once classic Releases and Finally everyone can communicate with wach other again properly" im soo disappointed by Blizzards decision
---
It was [2.0.1](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_2.0.1):
---
    Skill level now determines what items you can disenchant.
---
    Skill 1= Level 1-20
---
    Skill 25= Level 20-25
---
    Skill 50= Level 25-30
---
    Skill 75= Level 30-35
---
    Skill 100= Level 35-40
---
    Skill 125= Level 40-45
---
    Skill 150= Level 45-50
---
    Skill 175= Level 50-55
---
    Skill 200= Level 55-60
---
    Skill 225= Level 60-65
---
Many people who attend music festivals are alhocolics or do drugs. Enjoy the game
---
Is it even possible to sustain this amount of player initially?
---
In retail WoW you don't even need to speak with anyone lmfao, that's not a valid comparison.  
---
In Classic you will actually need to communicate with people.
---
Thats disgusting - how many chest spawns Was that? Or Was it all in one go hopping that many layers?
---
I still would choose layering before EU wide realms though. Thats a bummer
---
Right? People are exaggarating.
---
In Vanilla I (warrior) was lvl53 when my friends (priest and shaman) hit lvl60. They helped me farm the ghosts in Winterspring lake to get me to 60 as well. Ahh, good times.
---
Still playing with them.
---
It's like there is only allowed 1 type of community, and I bet it is actually a phletora of different ones. But everyone knows it's not a streamer community so everyone just hates on it. Personally I'll see if I can join a smaller streamers' server, helps that I plan playing horde though.
---
Great story! Really enjoyed it!
---
It's not about wanting it. No one wants it. It's about seeing the need for it to be able to play the game at all in the first week. No one WANTS layering, but not everyone is blind by hatred.
---
Honestly I hoped for a bit more attention, too. Would be nice if more people had joined gathering and uploading data, especially from the current stress test, because I cant login to this realms and do it by myself.  Atleast someone from the beta pvp realm from horde side started uploading data, what is really cool.
---
Grats! It's great getting excited over blue items again
---
Yeah there should definitely be Kara raid in vanilla. There is even Atiesh in the game...
---
i cant tell if you're joking?
---
Okay. There are 2 PVP, 2 PVE, and 1 RP realms for all of EU.
---
Which languages do you assign to each?
---
I'm learning english, I travel in europe and speak english, but I just want to play WoW classic the same way I played back in 2006. You know I play online game (overwatch for exemple). So I need to speak english and I learned that way too, playing video game.
---
But, I know what will happen, we french and german mainly, will segragate ourself and we will be a nightmare for you all.
---
 Btw, look, german are usually great english speaker. But they are too really proud of their langage and they like to speak it. They like the way their langage make them articulate their thinking. 
---
Langage is not just a way to communicate informations. It's way more. It make you think in a specific way. Did you never see the difference of your thinking when you are thinking in english and when you are thinking in sweedish ?
---
The "problem" will probably remain, but be more of the type "where is X", "did you see what X did" and so on
---
Anyone else read this in a French accent?
---
At this point it's probably best to just skip the launch and wait for Blizz to release enough servers.
---
People who speak certain languages form cliques and there tends to be hostility between the groups. This never works out. Not to mention that those players play localized clients so LFG chat will be filled with jibberish for most people. This will evolve into unofficial language specific servers. There are noticeable differences between unofficial language servers and official language servers:
---
They will start out with a mix of languages and later will either abandoned by most or evolve into an unofficial language server, which will be extremely toxic towards non speakers of that language. This will cause server population instability. Not to mention what a minefield it is for newer players when they don't know what server speaks what language.
---
Stormscale EU became the unofficial swedish server back in my day(Not that swedes don't speak english but it was just a natural evolution) and it was extremely toxic towards non swedes. And swedish people in groups tend to become very childish and Swescale was a prime example of this.
---
Adding official language servers would negate all this toxicity
---
^ this guy has never watched staysafe more than 2 minutes
---
I think we are talking about two very different experiences, if we're even floating the idea of thunderfury.
---
The vast, vast majority of players, even warriors won't be getting a thunderfury. 
---
I am of course not suggesting that a druid can compare to that.. but most players won't have to compare to that. And in fact, four horsemen won't be in the game for years, right?
---
So your advice is crucial for hardcore raiders, years in the game.. but seems a bit hyperbolic if we're talking about the experience that an aspiring druid would have the first 2 years of the game for example. (Granted, I know there are 6 phases but I don't know how long it'll take for the phases to come out. Do you know?)
---
Like most 12-year-olds, they are on 4chan
---
Vanilla private servers prospered, because there was no layering.
---
germans are dogshit at English, and the language is the least of the problems that come with association with germans.
---
They are as arrogant and snooty as french people, but with zero humor and no personality.
---
all to english :P
---
If you're a warrior, play with your paladin &amp; shamans friends.
---
I didn't took into account this, but in fact yes, the more crit you have, the more spell value increase, and it's the same in the other way.  
---
Unfortunately i couldn't  take this into account, at least withou adaptin every stats value depending on your current stuff.  
---
Remember that, crit will still multiplied your damage by \~2.16, because every crit will double the damage of the spell, plus fives your a -0.5s cast on your next spell.  
---
If you want you can still download the spreadsheet and adapt the stats values, this will automatically change all items damage value in every sheets.
---
One of us
---
People group up and out ffa. More people = more tagging if there's other people = you have a chance at finishing faster.
---
Nah
---
My guess is the reason they'll wait to announce anything is to see how many active subs they have from the oceanic region in August. They already have the tech, so like any business if they can make a profit they'll do it. 
---
My hope is they take a similar approach as EU and not have language specific servers, but have a dedicated local server for Aus/Japan/Singapore region.
---
Just a South African wow player over here never getting less than 150 ms since yiu know... Africa is only a myth and doesnt deserve/need gaming servers. Brb feeding my pet lion ama
---
You're right, but keep in mind that the  bloodvine set will comes to classic really late in the game, because it's related to ZG, so phase 4 !
---
I was thinking how public chats were filled with non English chatter sometimes. So, yes it's a valid comparison.
---
That would help in a sense of ignoring maybe the majority of the community of your Server. Just imagine 2 months after Launch Word has come around that Realm "x" has the most active frech community. So some frech People will reroll there and most of New french players will Start there too. If i as a german stsrted on Realm x before it was clear that theres the biggest french community it wouldnt help me to be able to ignore 90% of the playerbase on that Realm more effectively. I would just be stuck on a Realm with no Real community for me.
---
What's an Asmon?
---
&lt;HOMELESS&gt; lol
---
Because Blizzard doesn't seem to believe in the success of Classic WoW. This gets more and more apparent. They seem to think that the majority of the player base is going to leave after a month or so and only the hardcore community will stay. Layering is supposed to mimic more servers and provide everyone with no queue times.
---
On the internet? Never.
---
Thanks ! Please check the updated sheet ;)
---
I know no one wants to hear this but maybe blizzard has a very good reason for layering? They’ve kinda been doing this for a long time and most likely know more about how this all works than we do.
---
disgusting
---
Hell no! I haven't been able to play the beta for days!
---
Thank you, and now there is a new version of the spreadsheet ;)
---
I mean, I could just not do it at all...
---
Also I pass them over and over again throughout the zone, each time I’ll refresh the buffs. 
---
But you know what, I think you’re right. That isn’t enough. I should level my first aid and cooking and trade them all my food and bandages too. Maybe even let them afk with me on follow and do all their kill stuff quests for them. Heck, I should just give them all my gold too right? I mean, those repair costs can be pricy...
---
absolutely!
---
I somewhat made it to lvl 10 and could switch to a fistweapon with double the dps and 1.90 speed... no problems anymore!
---
but still the 1hander options (so daggers and axes) are very bad in the beginning, daggers have fine speed but lack dps... that's why the general consensus is the 2hander axe from the merchant in razor hill which is quite powerful for the early levels
---
No, wtf? People want to play when the game is launched, not 2-3 weeks afterwards. Such a retarded argument, unreal. Why don't you just wait until layering is disabled instead?
---
Not necessarily. The layer could still have sub 30s on it.
---
&gt;No actual vanilla player would suggest layering.
---
/r/gatekeeping
---
JEs, i think only shams have the interrupt at this level... hmm
---
No, look at the picture. Probably got the extra herbs from layering but no reason to worry. Just a few pots won't hurt you.
---
&gt;Wait until they find out there's only 2 PVP, 2 PVE, and 1 RP realms for all of Europe. Then they're really gonna shit the bed.
---
which is fucked considering that eu has a bigger population than USA Canada and Australia combined
---
Every EU player runs a risk of this happening to them. Its insane of blizzard to do this.
---
Huh some good points, I too had some fears about the whole “drop off” effect but I don’t see that happening for awhile atleast on US servers....
---
However to answer the question I think it’s more a business minded move (as many of blizzards recent decisions have been) maybe they’ve done the estimated math and it doesn’t make sence *shrugs*
---
Well that’s just an unhealthy stereotype)
---
My biggest dissapointment was disc proest change
---
That server will be really empty after a while once everyone gets banned for griefing.
---
Then you have the problem of people feeling cheated and going "but I had to pay...". Blizzard can't win regardless.
---
This was a horde only quest from 1k needles called "Test of Lore", added a buff named "Mark of Shame". You get asked a bunch of question about WoW lore, purposefully fail it and you get debuffed, use said debuff to kill your own faction leader.
---
Probably won't be in classic, as it was fixed in 1.11.
---
Why i remember that i do not know.
---
Me: "But you're level 55...."
---
Him: "SO?"
---
There's that but the ones who defend them are really fucking dumb, just look at what the other guy who replied to me said
---
Will you let everyone know when you get banned ?
---
Life is too short to let others decide what you like and don't like. Sometimes what you like dosn't need to make sense to others, just appreciate that you have something that makes you happy.
---
You should try work on breaking the shackles of social norms
---
Having worked on online games and web tech for 15+ years - no, it absolutely is not that simple. Load balancers are pretty "stupid", they redirect data packets to spread load. Stupid in a way that each package can go to a different load bearing mode. That would mean you would be switching layers tens of times each second. Also, a plain load balancing infra would not have a concept of people being grouped in-game and would send every group member to a different layer (based on your load balancing assumption).
---
With WoW Classic, the server side application has to understand the layer concept. It does for sure because it can assign you a layer, keep you there, or pass you to another layer on demand (when joining group from different layer). That means it is an application feature, not just added infrastructure. It uses some load-balancing concepts, that is all.
---
Spam in general
---
As someone who also used to work a job where most weeks I was away from home, I feel ya. Shit sucked. It was cool at first, 40 dollar cash per diem every day, travel and milage money, and the general wage was great. It just wears on you after a while. I ended up quitting entirely about 6 months ago. It was a good job but being away from home all the time suuuuckkeed.
---
Well, the thing is, there *needs* to be a vertical upgrade and a scale up, not only sideways.
---
Why? Because then the only people who benefit from gear from the new raid are the sub-optimal specs. Basically everyone who pushes Naxx (hardcore guilds) goes for absolutely efficiency and optimal composition. If you "invalidate" their effort by introducing a new Tier set not viable for them, you've basically decimated the raiding scene. Because let's face it, the progression guilds do it not only for fun, but for *progress* a.k.a. gear upgrade.
---
Better idea would be side-raids for for example resist gear (+ maybe the offspecs) PLUS one straight up next raid tear above Naxx. Possibly with the gear stat squish.
---
Blizzard replied to this during the summit that the content creators went to. They will offer free transfers off of those realms.
---
Don't listen to that guy, it's not even close to being accurate.
---
This makes sense to me. 
---
It's *TARREN MILL* you wretched swine!
---
I used to live AT a literal farm some years ago(during wrath I think) and we had 100/100 fiber for 35$/month.
---
Its really wierd to me that the US is so far behind us when it come to connection speed. Or is swedish internet just really good?
---
Test of Lore: https://www.wowhead.com/quest=6628/test-of-lore
---
If you failed you got Mark of Shame that made you At War with Horde. It was changed shortly after people started to kill faction leaders.
---
This is what they need to be doing. Provide at least a minimum of one designayed server for the big languages so people can escape the madness.
---
I did. Do you know what was the first result? This post.
---
Do not ever discourage people from seeking social guidance, it's healthy, it has a chane of yielding better results, and it's a part of building a community.
---
Mobile gaming, or at least the Skinner Box game design
---
So.. Can I play with English localization on Russian server and vise versa like in retail or it will be ghetto like in BC times? Anyone knows?
---
People will question why you use daggers but getting 3 rage per 1:30 is better than 7 rage per 2:50 cause missing with the 2:50 is crucial. As a warrior you usually miss 2-3 rage to cast sunder to gain that threat. You need 3 rage as fast as possible so daggers is my go to. It feels so much better and advise other warriors to do so aswell. Also if you have trouble when using 2hand do hamstring kiting. That way you trade one for one blow instead of the mob hitting you 5 times everytome you strike it.
---
But as I said in the second part, it doesn't need to be a specific layer... In reality you will just ask a guildie or friend to invite you and then there is a 1 in like 8 chance (depending on the amount of layers there are) that you won't swap layers.
---
And the first part is a way to farm black lotus from all layers by just getting invites
---
The problem is there won't be any designated english servers, either.
---
For single words that may be true, but Deepl really shines when translating longer texts as it's really good with grammar and context.
---
This is exactly one of the reasons why I think we should NOT have layering. People, together, hanging out.
---
I honestly doubt this decision is based on any assumption that Germans couldn't fill and sustain one or multiple realms. It's just the cheapest solution for Blizzard by far, so that's what they're going with.
---
Lol people like you are the worst kind of crybabies man. Get this..... don't play on the same server? All the popular streamers will be on the same it's pretty obvious.
---
Sharding on a larger scale.
---
Perhaps blizzard should just not allow streaming on their game. The experience should not be sacrificed for 99.99% of the player base.
---
Streamers could stay on bfa and do their transmog comps without worry of getting ganked.
---
After all, we want a classic experience and we will never even get close to that with streamers and there is nothing in the law that gives them right to monitize another companies trademarked franchies.
---
Red means dead
---
Hunter weapon
---
You can never have too many dots 
---
And Skinner's keep the pristine hide of the Beast.
---
That about covers it right?
---
I had it in vanilla, they were demoing bc that year
---
that's some good points, but I rather not take alchemy as I need all the money professions I can get, to be financially stable for the 40's mount
---
I wasn't so sure about the other faction, but jeah obviously this isn't so big of a deal on classic anyway it will be just fine
---
Class | Male | Female
---
-----|----|------
---
Druid | Night Elf | Tauren
---
Hunter | Troll | Night Elf
---
Mage | Gnome | Troll
---
Paladin |  | Dwarf
---
Priest | Dwarf | Undead
---
Rogue | Human | Orc
---
Shaman | Tauren | 
---
Warlock | Undead | Gnome
---
Warrior | Orc | Human
---
Good thing I refuse to play Druid, Paladin, and Shaman...
---
yes, they think it'll fail even though it's not even out and they put so much money into it. maybe they will just can it all 2 days before launch cause it's sooooo bad.
---
Deep arcane is one of the better PvE specs until the last tiers of raiding,  It’s going to play a lot differently, Frost will generally be where most of your spells come from with a 31/0/20 or 20/0/31 being pretty common. The benefit is that you have the ability to burst very hard to with Presence of Mind and still have 90 percent of the farming ability frost does
---
One of the more important ones:
---
Effort = Reward/Progress
---
&gt; I would go for Tauren paladin and Dwarf shaman.
---
You should play Retail, since that's exactly what they did.
---
Literally so true dude 5Head
---
If you define player base as the people who log in in the first few weeks, Blizzard is absolutely correct. All you need to play Classic is an active WoW subscription so in addition to the people wanting to play there will be a *ton* of people who are just checking it out because they're mildly curious. Will some of them turn into actual players? I think so, Classic immerses you in a way some people won't realise they want until they play it for the first time. But the fact remains that a large chunk of the initial population will leave relatively soon.
---
Streaming can be harder than you think. Sometimes people repeat stuff when being lost on what to say.
---
Locks once they get some Stamina and levels built up are beasts, before that they still get shredded like most clothes
---
Yeah lets never talk about it and put it up ever again and just hope blizzard fixes the problem. Sounds like a great idea. If everyone were like you we wouldn’t even have Classic releasing.
---
That fucking drift picture never dies... And you got that one spot on!
---
Who doesn't?  It's sad that we probably won't get tbc classic.  TBC is so much better than Vanilla.
---
You know there is English, which the rest of all countries in Europe use no Mather if it's their standard language. Germans and French should stop whining and git gud
---
It’s pretty sad how much of a superiority complex people have over others watching streamers. I guess Le Reddit Intellectuals would never dream of enjoying being part of a community.
---
The best part is that Chat, apart from Trade, is also layered, so all that spam is not going to get you shit.
---
How is it cheaper?
---
You all know if they did this as a limited time raid starting on April Fool's everyone in the sub would lap it up.
---
Prepare to get downvoted
---
Okay. You get 2 PVP, 2 PVE, and 1 RP. Which language gets to own which server?
---
Which begs the question... Which private server are we all moving to if/when blizzard shits the Classic bed?
---
20k is probably in the right ballpark on launch day if you want to have 3-5k concurrent by the end of phase 1.
---
Almost as if blizzard intentionally trying to get less people to play classic to prove it's a failed project hurr durr all to retail 8.3 is coming!! (fixing my tinfoil hat)
---
Layering because i like international servers
---
Warrior was my first char, I had no idea what a MMO was and I thought the leveling was absolutely fine, I eventually did it 3 times (yes I leveled 3 warriors to 60 in Vanilla, plus a couple other classes too).
---
Ungeared PVP was another matter though (I still hate mages 15 years later).
---
Oh, that's a great take on it.   
---
The only downside to this, is the temptation for Blizzard to \*keep\* it in non-contested zones...which perhaps is my just worrying too much.
---
Only player population matters and US+Can+AU has you beat there.
---
Nowadays you can play retail and clear all raid content without having to say a single word to anyone. You can't do that in Classic. So no, it's not a valid comparison.
---
Well World of Warcraft aka Azeroth is not in germany thats for sure.
---
But your probably not gonna die to 2 mobs on live
---
Found the guy that voted for Brexit.
---
Where I live, our internet shuts off when it rains.
---
Hunters are still a good pvp option, they ruin casters days with their pets and viper sting, hard counter rogues, and can definitely outplay warriors.
---
PvE wise their still useful at the higher tiers, just not the very best. Someone needs to use the mail agility gear and counter enrage mechanics. There’s some rumors that a mix of surv with a few points in Beastmaster and Marskmanship allowing them to stack crazy high Agi but I haven’t seen too much hard proof of that
---

---
Maybe do some fucking research once in a while, "brainlet".
---
Except if enough people do that, there won't ever be any new servers.
---
Did you even read what you're replying to?
---
I swear no one on this sub has any slight level of reading comprehension.
---
you are condescending because you use condescending language.
---
Idk where you got that from since realmpop shows that EU has like 10% more players than NA realms.
---
They would have been good additions, and I wish they would have gone deeper down that rabbit hole.
---
Also add woodcutting, woodworking and fletching to name a few. Fleshing out the whole crafting side of the game should be a goal. WoW would be really cool with heavy RPG and sandbox elements.
---
dat leeway, 15 yard melee range
---
Perhaps you should do actual challenging content in WoW then instead of comparing easy-to-get loot to easy-to-get loot.
---
If only, we won't get that vote.
---
As already said in comments this is a known Beta bug and has been reported.
---
With all the research on private servers they are also pretty solid offtanks, being able to handle most bosses , and being especially good  at being able to swap between offtank and healer as needed
---
This is my main issue, it becomes pot luck being in the same layer and place as someone. The amount of times in vanilla i would bump into someone I knew somewhere in the world accidently lead to some cool feel-good moments. Nowadays I'm trying to meet a friend while we are already in groups, in the same spot but different layers. FeelsBadMan
---
First of all, it was never about Europe getting individual servers. It's almost always been solely about France and Germany. Occasionally Italy too. But here's the thing.  In most streams, Swedes are almost ALWAYS top 3 featured. We've never had our own servers. Not in wow, guild wars, CS or call of duty.
---
We also don't NEED them because this is 2019.  If you don't learn English in school to the point where the average person can hold a conversation with people outside of your country, blizzard is doing you a service by INTEGRATING you guys with the rest of the world!
---
EU countries should definitely focus on learning English. We trade with each other. We have common laws. We help each other. Why do you WANT to segregate yourself?  That's how propaganda gets you.
---
I stopped at the beginning of TBC, and tried to come back at Legion.
---
I didn't even last a month ! This is not a MMO anymore.
---
You can easily play WoW in your car, just sell your house and spend it on new gear!
---
this. "lfr drop is not enjoyable". No shit retard.
---
"Will let you roll on greens/blues I get from pick pocketing lockboxes, if they're a decent upgrade for you. Will post them all to chat."    
---
or
---
"will unlock lockboxes I get during the run and distribute them evenly, first to tank and healer and then one to everyone else if enough drop."     
---
Being willing to share your pick pocketing spoils is a big incentive to reserve a spot for you, if the mobs have pockets. That's what you can bring that no other dps class can, sharing pick pocketing loot.

realmpop shows total characters ever created, you need to look at players that actually login.

In the last 30 days, [417,208](http://www.warcraftrealms.com/eu_realmstats.php) characters logged into EU realms.
---
In the same time period, [465,181](http://www.warcraftrealms.com/realmstats.php) characters logged into NA realms.

strange question but did you drink in game alcohol? being drunk has some interesting effects like lowering the displayed level of mobs. probably to simulate overconfidence.

Site says Tichondrius has had zero active Alliance characters. There's four guilds that have cleared Heroic Crucible on Tichondrius Alliance.

Here's one of those guilds:  
---

---
Level 120 Members: 239
---
Accurate my ass.
---
I guess they ended up in the first group naturally because they were the fastest of them to get 70 and finish the prequest...
---
No they didn't.
---
I'm planning on going Shaman,
---
My TBC Shaman never got past lvl 37, so I didn't really get into it.
---
The weakaura you're proposing, is it to tell which totem is active and for how long? Does someone already have such an aura set up that you know of?
---
I was also concerned about the drop off. That is why I was okay with layering as a temporary solution. But how big will this effect be? 20%, 50%, 80% it's guess work, but to me 50% seems like a rather safe estimation.
---
But even from a business point of view I don't see how this decision pays out. Server infrastructure will be virtualized anyways, so it doesn't matter how you split the servers up. The only money they could save is by not needing support staff for the individual languages. But this comes at the cost of people not playing/subbing because they don't want to speak English.
---
And indeed it was the next raid.

No WSG/AV until phase 3, AB phase 4:  [https://www.wowhead.com/news=291079/classic-pvp-content-plan-explained](https://www.wowhead.com/news=291079/classic-pvp-content-plan-explained)
---
This isnt leeway, it is tauren increased hitbox. Now if venruki was running then leeway would come into play what you see here is just the element of tauren hidden passive, increased hitbox range.
---
I'm fairly sure it is broken for everyone.
---
I was a noob hunter in vanilla and grew into becoming a better one in TBC and WotLK. I have not yet had any second thoughts about being one in Classic as well.
---
It was and still is my favorite class and if it is yours I can only encourage you to go the same route.
---
I’m a dad now and life is a bit more busy then it used to be. Therefore I’m aiming to get tier 1 (got my wife’s permission btw..) and from there on we’ll see. I imagine it being an achieve able goal and hunter will most definitely always be welcome in MC raids.
---
Bottom line: if you like hunter, just go for it. Don’t worry by extreme end game raiding if it’s not going to be your main goal.
---
Yes this is essential!
---
This guy was 11 at release and now
---
that looks like ambient occlusion going haywire.
---
For pvp, priest for sure. Otherwise you'll both just get kited with no way to catch a mage. And if your friend gets an itch to dps shadow priests in vanilla are a tonne of fun.
---
And we are going to reach 2.0.1 eventually, so I either suck it up and level the alt or I just slap Enchanting on my main.
---
Thanks, mate!
---
A lot of people seem to want to sacrifice the struggle and immersion so they can quicken their grind - the exact thing which most classic-fans are trying to fight against.
---
This is pretty bonkers to me. I've played lots of MMOs with no language segregation, and everyone uses English. I've been in guilds led by French people, with all the officers being French or Belgian, and everyone spoke English. 
---
Kazzak is the unofficial Eastern European server on Retail. I never saw a single non-English word uttered, except the occasional 'Kurwa', but that's par for the course.
---
Also the PVP aspect "OMG it's that guy again"
---
That's pretty spot on.

I know, but i think there will be very a few servers ( maybe 2 par type ? ) so there will not be country oriented servers.
---
I can't see the future of course, maybe i'm wrong, but by looking at their choices recently I'm waiting for the worst
---
For most it might not be a problem. But that's not the question. People want to enjoy the game in their native language.
---
And if you asked me: in retail I never know when I need to speak English or can keep talking in my native tongue until someone in the party gave a hint.
---
Sure, out of 994 data points, 12 are missing. Still the most accurate data we have.
---
&gt; A lot of people seem to want to sacrifice the struggle and immersion so they can quicken their grind - the exact thing which most classic-fans are trying to fight against.

Yes, they do, and they're right.

Plus, dead servers in Classic would be worse than in BfA, since there won't be lfg/lfr.

the "do u guys not learn english in school?" is the same statement as "do you guys not have phones?".
---
Sadly from what I've seen in real life you seem to be on the ball even if it was a /s :/
---
I think it will be positive, in regards to opening the Gates to Ahn'Qiraj. Asmon want the Batlle Tank, and his following will make sure to farm for weeks to make the hand in quota.
---
Agreed, if we are really getting shafted because it's better financially for Blizz then it's super sad. 
---
All this so called "love" project and they cheapen out on literally everything.
---
Read the quest description, figure out where you need to go, then go there and complete the quest objective.
---
Blizzard stated that the layering is only for the first few weeks to cope with the launch rush, and will slowly be removed to increase population. People are losing their minds about it but it's not a permenant state.
---
Classic wow runs on a potatoe. Buy a bigass monitor if you feel like it.
---
So you don’t think you will be able to enter the content in which hunter falls off dps wise and that makes you question if you should play hunter?
---
Do i have a stroke or is this lacking the most fundamental logic?
---
Hi fairly sure it is broken for everyone., I'm dad.
---
Never understood why people feel the need to play with people from their own nationality, even though they speak English just fine. Sure, if your English is shit I get it, but I personally always enjoy getting to know people from different nationalities. Is it because people connect better with fellow countrymen or what?
---
aren’t they hosted in melba?
---
Not me. I wish Norwegian would drop off the face of the planet. Completely useless language.
---
&gt; we are going to reach 2.0.1 eventually
---
I wouldn't bet on that. Classic may well be dead by then, or Retail may be completely overhauled. Don't make a tiny decision today based on something that won't be a factor for 2 years.
---
XP is not damage dependent, or else healers would all be severely under leveled.
---
If you're in the group that makes the kill (and are close to the action) you get the XP / honor even if you did nothing.
---
However if you have too much lvl difference your XP is severely reduced.
---
That doctor one always cranks me up.
---
I did some “research” by playing on a private server. The difference is night and day! I really got the feeling of the olden days back during Vanilla and TBC. Where talking and befriending strangers was the norm.
---
Upvoted for using the battlestation picture that was posted today.
---
Make it so contested zones are not affected by layering and ill sign it.
---
Fair point.
---
I'm thinking of leveling a carbon copy of my mage from vanilla to get the same nostalgic experience and a dr00d side-by-side, so maybe there's room for both.
---
Anyway, catch you in WSG!
---
The difference is though, that many European countries have English in their everyday life (e.g. through movies that are not dubbed). But countries with a big enough market: namely Germany and France do not get confronted with English that much. Since WoW caters to very different demographics, you will have a lot of people who are not comfortable enough to speak English.
---
I am there with you that people should be better in English, but this is not Blizzards job to achieve. The majority of people who do not want to speak English on an international server simply won't. They will have their own communities within the server and not bother with the rest. This is true for every group of people that do not speak English as their mother tongue. Poles, French, Italians, Spanish, Germans ... there will always be people of every country that will just speak their own language.
---
So denying them their servers will have at least two negative effects:
---
* they won't play, which means the metrics for Classics success will be worse than they would be otherwise
---
* servers will have split communities, certain servers will be inofficial [language] servers, servers will be chaotic with 5+ spoken languages in global chats
---
Deflection (Parry chance) is really good because not only does it provide a great defense, but as the guy above said, it reduces your swing timer by 20-40%. Therefore greatly increasing your DPS.
---
Seal of the crusader is absolutely useless in classic, might as well not even learn it from the trainer.
---
First of all, the debuff sucks, and in raid enviroment you have a maximum of 16 debuffs and Seal of the Crusader won't be one of them. Second, in PVP and while leveling it is not worth to put the debuff since it only works with your next seal judgements after that one and most mobs won't survive long enough for it to be worth.
---
Before it used to be a great way of proccing on-hit weapons or enchants due to its attack speed buff, but in the patch 1.12 seal of the command counts as 2 attacks (You'll see how sometimes the seal part of the attack is parried or dodged) therefore it is more efficient at applying proccs too.
---
IT HAS NICHE USES, sure. Like if you're in a dungeon with a holy priest or even two, they GREATLY benefit from the seal if they will spam smite. But it's super niche and circumstancial.
---
Following the debuff logic, same applies for Vindication, especially at 1/3. You do not want to use a debuff slot for a 1/3 vindication, raids won't allow you to get in with that specc.  And benediction is a must. Mana issues are real for ret paladins.
---
Santity aura might not be terrible in PVE if you have enough paladins (That'd be too many I think) but it is quite shit. In raids you will need to put fire res, devotion or many others before that one. In PvP, I think sanctity sucks, might as well use res / devotion / retribution versus certain classes.
---
The biggest problem with your argument is that we Aussies speak English, so it's blizzards eyes we actually matter. 
---
Joking aside a 138ms ping would be glorious. In vanilla we have 300minium usually more like 450-500. On the pserver I've been fiddling on lately it's been averaging about 380.
---
This should be stickied, excellent explanation good ser! (Alternatively, we can print it out and smack idiots with it)
---
Personally I don't understand why anyone would want to play a game (server and/or client) that is on their own language besides for English. If there was a client for WoW on my language I would steer away from it as far as I could. 
---
But that's just my opinion.
---
Scandinavia is still significantly ahead of the pack in terms of non-native English speakers in Europe, and it's true for all of Europe at the moment, that there's an English language proficiency sweet spot. If you're younger than average, your English is going to be bad or non-existant, and the same goes if you're older than the pack.
---
The kids could definitely benefit from playing on English wow servers to learn English, but some people aren't interested in being involuntarily forced to learn a language to play a game, and it's not really Blizzard's job to force them I think.
---
Just to make it clear, there is about 11 millions people speaking Swedish and 300 millions speaking french (Francophonie is presents in many countries).
---
That one guy asking for a intellect buff
---
I bet even for you, you would easily create relationships with swedish people than other countries just because you could joke about swedish stuffs or cultural references... Because people don't primatively have an international culture but a local one. And wow vanilla heavily relies on social.
---
So we are still in beta and yet you are complaining that stuff isn't finalized? Are you fucking kidding me mate?
---
How would removing layers work after two weeks if your server has 5 layers?
---
https://discord.gg/3jX9s3H Classic WoW Oceania discord already has 2300 member before launch. Blizz has the server infrastructure in Sydney and we will have the players to sustain at least one.
---
My understanding is that this won't be a permanent feature, but rather a way to mitigate the heavy launch during the first couple of weeks. Not even Blizzard want this permanently and they will disable it as soon as possible, as they have stated multiple times in the past.
---
Somewhere out there in a parallel universe is a version of me who is really looking forward to playing classic and finally training brewing to 300/300. I hope he has a fantastic time.
---
Tbh it looks like Blizzards stance on sharding (oops I meant layering, which is a completely different thing /s) changes every month.
---
Most people. They've already confirmed that they'll make TBC servers if the community wants them, and they've confirmed that Classic will keep going until WoW sinks. So congratulations, you'll see TBC classic servers!
---
Nope, Blizzard uses AT&amp;T for everything outside of China and their only datacenter in Australia is in Sydney.
---
is there a reason you don't want to take the next couple paychecks up until release, or the 13th naming launch?
---
No because with layering you can switch layer whenever you want (or sometimes you don't even want it) and that's the issue.
---
Having subservers that you can only choose at character creation and without any hopping between subservers is the solution
---
It is temporary "until the server population has stabilized" or until phase 2 starts. But what if the anticipated rush is dramatically over estimated and we end up with really big servers that have 10k+ players? Nowhere did they say "just a few weeks"
---
I am not even against layering as a temporary solution. I even think it is rather clever. The major point here was not to argue against layering, but to argue that Blizzard does not seem to believe in the success of classic.
---
Their promise changes every time.
---
Ah okay, either way it's pretty similar so it'd be a joke if we ended up with like 4 realms.
---
Copying and polishing old content is much, much easier than creating new content.
---
See: Game of Thrones
---
Yet when I try retail for a couple hours, nodes keep disappearing right as I get to them :(
---
yeah for real, I don't really use reddit too much because of how much it repeats itself. like how many manual/zone pic stuff is getting recycled every week or two.
---
r/gatekeeping
---
I may just be 24 but people my age roughly do what you said aswell. Fuck em dude. If they want to live such a generic boring life then fine. You've found your happiness and that's something noone can tell you to change.
---
I want to add that I did pllay on multiple private servers, and this topic is really frustrating to me as a german that loves playing internationally.
---
I know my fellow countrymen and I know the rest of europe - People love talking their own language, and I've seen it happen so many times that national guilds form and just play for themselves. I've even been in a german guild on an english server for a while, and the people there would consistently ignore english requests and just be on their own, essentially just forming their own little server, and it's disheartening that guilds like that essentially just fuck themselves up, just to preserve their language. I understand not everyone knows perfect english, but even people that do behave like this.
---
I've also been on the other side of the coin, I've played on an inofficial eastern european server for a while, one on retail and one on a private server. While on the Retail Server with sharding and whatnot it was not impossible to find english speaking people, on the smaller private server (TBC, 2k concurrent at the time) I never got to even raid since it was impossible to find a decently sized english guild.
---
I don't want this happening to classic.
---
I want to play on an english server with all of my friends without running the risk to figure out that we're going to be excluded when half of us are already level 40. I don't think anyone wants this.
---
Please give germans their german server, frenchies their french server, and spanish people theirs. Let them form their communities far away from everyone speaking english, so we can all have a better experience.
---
kthxbye

Lol, 2300. You're 16% of the way there. But you keep at it buddy. I'm sure Blizzard will pay attention to your request, since all major petitions to Blizzard have never gone ignored.
---
I mean, just give me a free realm transfer once my realm becomes the hellhole that for example Drak´thul is today.
---
There will always be shitload of people playing the game who dont have sufficient level of english to communicate properly.
---
Or yea, the Turkish Twisting Nether, also fun place to be.
---
I really hope someone will make a website similiar to "streamers - servers" where we will be able to see which languages will be dominant on given servers.
---
Who cares if a mage can aoe farm on a starting zone
---
Yes, and it's extremely difficult because of it. You will die A LOT trying to adjust to it. It will not be as effective as you're used to.
---
I gave up on trying to do it in the beta at Level 30, it was too frustrating. It might be more tolerable when you have a mount though.
---
And the leeway is only a part of the problem. Blizzard is wonky as hell because the effects are basically split up into two separate batches. The first batch is damage and then the second batch is the slow effect, so if you're unlucky with the timing of the first batch you might have to wait TWO complete batches for the slow to apply so if you're dazed from the insane leeway (you practically will be every single pull because you can't avoid their attacks if you don't have a mount) you're very, very likely to die.
---
Wrong.
---
Personally, I am not at all interested in TBC servers. But to each their own I guess.
---
just because i can speak english, doesn't mean I like to play on EU Servers.
---
Just because I own a smartphone, doesn't mean I like to play Diablo Immortal.
---
Just because I have an Anus, doesn't mean I Like Gay Anal Sex.
---
I think it might tell us three different things:
---
* They kinda 'lost' translations or the regionalisation is more complex than we imagine and they don't want to do that effort.
---
* They think that the majority of european player in 2019 are fluent in english and the playerbase will be older so it's not a problem
---
* They don't expect the game to be more than a niche success long term  and they plan on less than 10 servers for EU
---
In my opinion, it's a mix of all of that: they don't expect the game to be a major hit and while I imagine they considered having at least one server in german and french, the effort in localization is probably not worth it from their market expectations.
---
Now it's hard to really know at the moment whether they are right or wrong. Will the game be a major hit and make their decision completely stupid? will the game after 2 months be only 5 servers and totally justify their choice? I don't know
---
What I know is that for veteran like me who played the game in a regional version back in the days, it will change the feeling of the game waaaaaaay more than any layering, QOL or patch release day. I know that some people from my old french guild don't speak english fluently enough to really enjoy chit-chat (make and understand jokes or communicate in audiochat) and because of this they won't probably play or stay.
---
Now I know some people are thinking "if you don't speak fluently english in 2019, then it's their problem" but in the end they are gonna suffer from it because as people have mentioned everywhere since yesterday, people will gather on specific server and it will make the experience worse for everyone as people will read foreign language on global channel and each and everytime it will end in an insult war.
---
In the end it's really a bummer: people will insult each other and won't communicate as much.
---
Level 60. No flying. It's about the journey not the destination. The adventure never ends. Money isn't given out frequently. The player is always a nameless traveler. Fast travel is a flightpath or your fastest riding speed. The world is dangerous.
---
"Like 8" the EU has 24 official languages
---
I NEED 40 TEENAGERS WITH ATTITUDE
---
They already have servers in Australia, so I’m sure they will throw one up. Why wouldn’t they? WoW servers for “NA” are located in LA, Chicago and Australia. So I’d expect you get Atleast 1 server.
---
So play on a server without a streamer?
---
Don't worry, US is only getting 6 (1 extra RP realm).
---
Of course there is going to be a clear drop off. But how big that will be is pure speculation and from what Blizzard is doing it seems they expect the vast majority of people to leave after a short time. They don't seem to think that Classic might be very successful even with a lot of tourists. We still don't know how many servers they plan to have at launch but so far it seems to be maybe a dozen for the US and about the same for the EU. We'll see it when they announce the server lists.
---
Let's say now we're one month into the game, many tourists have left and layering got turned off. Do you really think anything fewer than 20 servers will be enough to sustain the NA population? Let's say 3k people per server without layering. That would be 60k people who can play concurrently. 
---
I definitely get the idea of layering. But Blizzard seems to vastly underestimate the possible success of Classic. They want to start with a slim server list which is probably not going to be enough. So why not just start with more servers? There is no way 20 to 30 servers for EU will lead to dead servers. Germany alone can easily fill like 10 servers, france something close to that.
---
They just seem to look at this game as an extra. People are going to check it out and then leave because it is old an boring and it is only Nostalgia anyway. They expect only the very core community to stay and they think those are very few.
---
I don't know why everyone is insulting these people? I suspect that might be a screenshot from last night Gurubashi arena match. It was hug there were loads of people and it was a fun watch.
---
Unfortunately they can't just turn up they need to be in the same layer. So fine get mad at layering in this instance maybe, but why hate for people trying to get involved in a server community event?
---
do what makes you happy bud
---
You can have all realms in one location instead of having them spread out all over Europe. You don't need to hire language-specific GMs. They make money with the inevitable realm transfers once people realize they ended up leveling on the inofficial &lt;insert language here&gt; realm.
---
Doesn’t matter how many times you tell these people, they will NEVER understand. They just froth at the most and mash on their keyboards.
---
Okay. You get 2 PVP, 2 PVE, and 1 RP. Which languages get to claim which servers?
---
Jesus, I was aware of some of those, but definitely didn't expect a list that big. I also noticed the weird pet behaviour on the level 10 stress test, but I assumed that this will get fixxed before launch. Now that I see the size of this list, I'm honestly getting scared. I am dead set on rolling a hunter since about 4 months, but some of those bugs kind of make me question my decision :o
---
No I said "if the Main Tank has it" then Rogues should be able to roll on it. Thunderfury is a very high end sword for both Rogues and Tanks, it's selfish to deny Rogues bidding/rolling on it because it might make 1 fight in Naxx (slightly) easier. Additionally most guilds won't even get that far, most players won't ever fight the 4HM, yet a lot of them will kill Ragnaros. Most players will likely get a mix of T2 and T2.5, so essentially you're just all raiding for gear/fun, and telling Rogues they can't roll on what is an absolutely godly weapon because you're a tank and want a cool yellow item is selfish and sad. If the guild is pushing to clear Naxx40 and absolutely need to min/max then fair enough, if you're just a pug or a casual guild then after the MT it should be a free roll for Tanks/Rogues/Fury warriors.
---
"Play what you want, I soloed Naxx in a melee Hunter(without poet of course) on day 1. So what it's slightly unoptimal"
---
So start the petition bro.
---
They probably realized early on that Arthas was going to get his own expansion. He's the biggest and best known lore character, devoting just a content patch or two to his story doesn't really do him justice.
---
Remove layering within 5 days so instead of competing for mobs against a server size population, you compete against 5 server sizes? You’re not thinking clearly.
---
Kind of. But in western europe, overall people behave a very similar culture anyways.
---
A huge problem is that if you live in one of these countries, you never need to learn english, so a lot of people just don't. Movies, Games and the like are almost always dubbed if not subtitled, so people get lazy, never learn english and are then scared to speak it, at least that what I observed from the other germans around me. It's gotten better over the years, but it's still an issue.
---
Maybe because people don't want to play on a server with like 5 different languages they don't speak.
---
Imagine Americans had to play with Chinese on the same server.
---
i see we've progressed to state-of-the-subreddit stage 5, with the "starter pack" critique
---
up next, stage 6: someone starts the official /r/classicwow circle-jerk sub
---
1. Blizzard hosts all the EU realms in either Paris or Frankfurt.
---
2. Yes, you still need to hire language-specific customer service reps and in fact, they already have.
---
3. There won't be any unofficial language realms because there won't be enough realms for any one language to dominate.
---
Leeway Jenkins, Leroy's long-armed brother
---
 Personally, I am not at all interested in classic servers .  The game is unbalanced, unrefined, and filled with exploits.  Might as well play lfr as to raid with world buffs.
---
How is that positive?
---
Because not everyone is capable of speaking english. Many old people will return to wow through classic. Do you think everyone will have a good experience with people they can't even communicate? Also the risk of a server being unofficial german or italian or whatever the f. you want is very high because the community want to stay together (guilds that go from retail to classic), and they won't talk english there.
---
2300 is not far from a blizzlike pop. And it's a discord server 2 months before launch only hardcore players will join it, there will be plenty of casual players or retail players who try it out.
---
This entire thread is so yikes you have a real problem, seek help.
---
Want to add: the video doesn't pay enough justice on how **monstrously** giant is that version of the tower. Naxxramas in comparison it's quite claustrophobic
---
About support staff : it should not be that difficult to find bilingual people eng/fr  eng/de eng/sp for example... it's not THAT rare, and no, it wouldn't cost that much more...
---
Yeah honestly. Closing these threads for "bigotry and toxicity" only because of 3-4 posts is completely unnecessary and doesn't help the situation at all. Blizzard needs to know how big of a concern this is!
---
Thanks for that!
---
A big part of my nostalgic wow experience is being whispered by Scandi Bros inviting me to their guild. Plus questing will chill Dutch guys. 
---
I'm torn.
---
You are willfully ignorant in this one. France and Germany had language specific realms hosted on the same European server. Au has their own server in Sydney to be hosted from. Multiple people have pointed out that I've region does have the population to support 1-2 realms.
---
Lol shamans will be one of the most played classes
---
The shaman is moving though. Shouldn't that mean leeway is in play?
---
True.
---
Yeah. German is the most spoken language in EU. There will be more than enough to fill at least one server.
---
&gt;if venruki was running
---
look i know it's an image, not a gif, but it's *super obvious* they're both running and this is obviously leeway (as well as tauren reach)
---
Spainbreaker and Finreaver 2.0
---
I want to know too
---
Mage is arguably the best class in vanilla.
---
They wouldn't be revamping it at all if they expected, in your words, very few people to stay. Doesn't make sense from a business standpoint. They expect the population to shrink, but think about it from their perspective - worst comes to worst the population is bigger than expected, they open new servers and get good publicity from 'Blizzard needs to make more servers than expected for unexpectedly high amount of players'. Much better than getting it wrong in the other direction and needing to combine servers.
---
nice
---
Thats because you know the other 5 finnish wow players personally.
---
You can literally see that Venruki is running away?
---
No, I'm choosing to completely ignore the geolocation aspect because Blizzard will too and has in the past.
---
And there's no evidence to suggest Oceania has enough players to support one realm if Germany doesn't.
---
I'm from Denmark, and I couldn't care less about Danish server options either, but it's different for our Central and Southern European brothers, some of whom don't speak English, perhaps because it wasn't taught in schools when they went, I don't know, but the result is if everyone is mixed, the people who are playing on German or French or w/e servers on live because they don't speak English, are gonna divide the playerbase on the servers we play on, potentially taking some over completely, or just barring you from communicating with half your realm. Player limits being what they are in vanilla, that is actually a pretty real issue, even if your English is fine.
---
Do you mind to expand on this? Not being snarky or some shit.
---
As far as i understood, they are "just" replicating the old game, right? Isn´t there some old datalogs available were you can kinda copy paste information?
---
Cheers
---
I've heard they gear easily in raids.
---
All I want is for everyone to be able to learn Pick Locks so that I don't feel like I HAVE to play Rogue or I'm missing out.
---
Druid code.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but don't you frost nova before the first blizzard?
---
You've been in a login queue for years?
---
That sounds rough man, no wonder you're so tetchy.
---
5.  There are dozens of reasons layering is bad. One of them you’re reading by this ignorant OP that thinks taking it out at 30 is a good idea. You don’t know what layering is, and you’re confusing it with sharding. I’m embarrassed for you for posting such a dumb comment, and look forward to your tears when layering fails you
---
it’s just celebrity worship, not hard to understand, it’s cringe, yeah, but whatever. people are fans of celebrities, what’s new
---
I hate these people that think this shit, as if celebrity worship is unique to 2019 or “kids”, the only difference with streamers is that the worshippers actually have a chance to interact with the celebrity.
---
look at any live concert for ANY big band or artist, you’ll see thousands of screaming and crying fans. it’s the exact same shit with streamers
---
&gt; (notably Furor and Tigole) who were sick of how awful melee hit detection was in Everquest.
---
They were writers/quest designers not programmers
---
I don't enjoy talking with other countries. I have 10 times more fun talking with french people in my own language
---
&gt;  I would've been very inclined to jump on an english flagged server this time anyways
---
So why dont you start on Server#2? oh snap, 2 months later, it's clear. Server#2 evolves into the greek one. And even worse, Server#4 evolves into the english one, the first of your friends are already leaving.
---
Addong -EN behind "Server#1" isn't that difficult. Server#1-EN, Server#2-FR, you get the concept.
---
no worries the streamer entourage will disappear after a week or two  
---
no offense, some of these guys are entertaining, but once classic won't be such a privilige for a handful, it will be boring as Shit to watch to the yolokid generation kappaop dansgame
---
I can't wait to accidentially pick the server that turns out to be the unofficial french server down the line.
---
&gt; They kinda 'lost' translations or the regionalisation is more complex than we imagine and they don't want to do that effort.
---
What do you mean by this? As in client localization?
---
For retail this stands true. However we have no idea how Europe vs NA vs Oceania will be joining classic
---
So this doesn't affect you. Good for you then. Other people just want to play on their servers like they have been for 15 years.
---
GET ME TF OUT OF ASMON LAYER - is gonna be my go to spam. thank jehova its only up for 3 weeks this layering stuff
---
The final thing that the other guy didn't note was how impactful streamers where in getting wow classic to be a thing. It wasn't brought about by the #nochanges, it was brought by attention and demand giving blizzard an incentive to do it. Sodapoppin was huge in terms of getting classic to happen and some of the first people that where informed it was happening was streamers. For games now the biggest form of attention they get is from streamers. When you have two people who are both asking for something and when they both stream move your game from 10th to 1st on twitch you kinda wanna hear them out. Now they aren't the only reason it happened, they are just figure heads of some of the communities that wanted classic, but they also had strongest individual reach. 
---
Also the guy insults streamers and there fans and saying they will kill communities without seeing the irony. All in all, u/serrol_ is a fucking idiot and nearly everything he posted from his comment on #nochanges, to streamers impacting classic being a thing and his view on communities all being wrong.
---
Yeah, because nobody under 18 will lie about their age when creating an account...
---
Ah, I see you weren't there for Warlords of Draenor launch.
---
Will never forget that massive zerg standing on top of Khadgar in front of the portal.
---
Isnt spell batching set on 400ms anyway? We all will be lagging so who cares about 138
---
Yes, the population cap is 3.5k two months after launch. But at launch, you need much much more. At least 14k (minimum layers per continent).
---
But keep at it! I can't wait to post the Blue text explaining their won't be any realms hosted in Sydney on that Discord and prove you all wrong.
---
The people who aren't bilingual?  🤔
---
Wasn’t there a system that could make town guards hostile if you have too many Dishonorable kills as well?
---
&gt; Layering is a reasonable solution to the problem. The alternative is sharding, which no one likes
---
The reason nobody likes Sharding is the problems Layering still has.
---
Jesus you're dense
---
yeah...maybe......but I still cant wait for wow to be released. I was a hardcore raider and PVPer back in vanilla. I was raiding into naxx (couldnt get past the 4Hmen)...and I got to rank 12 in PvP.  When the kids came along, I played low level BGs (like 10-14) heirloomed to the max....and then would just rinse/repeat. I quit when cata was released. 
---
But now the kids are older, I cant wait to get back playing. 3hrs a night will be fine, and I can achieve so much (might even get to raid once/twice a week if I am lucky). But I totally miss the buzz of WoW, no other game has ever replaced that. 
---
Even playing casually, I'm totally excited for launch day :D
---
I meant that if you're PvP flagged (pretty much from Duskwood and Ashenvale up) is not layered anymore.
---
Of course that still poses a problem on pve servers, in that case I would suggest to switch off entirely the layering once someone enters a contested/hostile zone.
---
I'll concede the first point, I wasn't aware of that. I knew the German realms were hosted in Frankfurt, so I assumed every language specific realm had their own location in their respective countries. 
---
I wasn't talking about customer service reps, I was specifically talking about GMs. You won't have French, Spanish, German GMs on their EU-realms. The more centralized an operation like this is (i.e. having all your employees in one country), the less costs for the company.
---
3. I'm not certain about that. There only needs to be one realm for each language, and I'd assume they'll start at least with 10 realms per region? That's plenty for a French, Italian, Spanish, German realm etc.
---
How are they supporting the languages? I haven't seen any indication of that being the case. I'd be happy to be wrong here, and I'll admit I am getting more pessimistic by the day, so my views are biased. All I wanted was an authentic Vanilla experience, but between layering and non-language-specific realms, it doesn't look like that's going to be the case.
---
Yes, but we have absolutely no reason to suspect that one region will see a larger contingent of players returning to the game than another region.
---
That is incorrect.
---
I **told** you that Twitch struggles to break 1 million even during major events. This is something I've observed. I greatly enjoy Twitch as it offers me the ability to watch professional players and tournaments. I do not enjoy Twitch chat culture. I simply countered your 'millions' statements which was outright false, because Twitch has never in its lifetime had millions--plural--of viewers.
---
Sharding isn’t layering. Cutting layering at level 15 the exploitable resources, but now you’re visible  server just went from 2500 people to potentially 20,000. You want to quest with 20,000 people once you hit level 15? You’re fucking high
---
If anyone is entitled enough to think that I dont need gear for my solo adventure, just because I am healing his ass as a priest, or if anyone tries to forbid the tank to roll on gear simply for having a chance outside the dungeon, I am sure you and I will find a more understanding damage dealing companion. :-)
---
Not allowing warriors to roll on 2handed weapons is like seal slaughter.
---
Me too, especially since I work with French people and they are notorious for refusing to speak English. I had the phone slapped on me several times because of it at work. Very annoying. It's also ironic because I work in tourism, if you work in freaking TOURISM of all fields then English should be the default language in business regardless of your nationality and butthurtness of what language you prefer.
---
A necessary evil for launch. I don't like it but I'd rather play the game then be stuck in a starting zone.
---
Throw a curve ball and have it be an ancient latin server.
---
Aye
---
I plan on going to worse areas anyway. I like Desolace and Feralas.
---
Where are you getting those numbers from exactly?
---
GMs *are* customer service representatives, I know what you meant. And yes, there will be GMs for every supported language. They're already on the payroll and the client is already localized.
---
10 realms would be wrong. Blizzard said EU would have "several" and I've never known several to mean that many. Besides, if they were giving EU 10 realms, they would have given the 20% of their playerbase (Germany) at least one of them.
---
That's exactly what I was about to say. Making them bubble hearth is like throwing them miles away. 
---
The only time it isn't a win, is if they were returning anyway.
---
Go for T1, alot easier to get and better
---
And you're delusional.
---
The only reason we're getting Classic is because they are sure they can make money. They want their old subscribers back. We're untapped revenue that has been deemed possibly profitable enough to try something out that they didn't want to do before. But that also means that they are being as conservative as possible because it's still a risk. A well calculated one, but still a risk.
---
Or for Horde trying to build their garrison
---
You are vastly overestimating how much more damage 2H weapons do, especially early in the game.
---
For example:
---
 - Level 4 vendor 1H axe: 3.82DPS
---
 - Level 3 vendor 2H axe: 4.29DPS
---
Also, if you happen to play on a pserver the name of which is based on a Titan, the father of Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Hestia, Demeter, and Hera, then I can assure you that particular pserver gets a LOT of things wrong about mobs compared to classic.
---
FFA for groups with skinners.
---
You can't use the visual for anything.  And none of the streamers have combat logs with timestamps.
---
Seal twisting was tested already, and it works on the beta.
---
Spamming some videos of esfand doing the opposite of testing isn't helping.
---
I spent a lot of time on a private roleplay server that did have this architect profession. Actually lets you gather wood, metal, stone etc.  and use those materials to build houses, furniture, doors, walls, etc.
---
It's pretty cool. And imo retail WoW could do it, too. They just have to make good use of phasing like they did with garrisons. Imagine if you were able to pick from several plots of lands in the game world and get your own phase there, just an empty space where you can go ham with the building and create your own home.
---
&gt; Frenchies are decent enough at English
---
I'm French and I'm decent enough at English, but believe me I'm an oddity !
---
I work in a company of about 200 persons, less than 10 would be able to read and understand this post !
---
Micro-transactions, loot boxes, pay to win in AAA games, live service games, every game company wanting there own launcher with half of them not having basic functionality, Epic Games, EA, Activision, Kick Starter being the main source for re-emerging old genre's but no guarantee on a finished product, mobile gaming, China. 
---
Honestly take your pick
---
That's a fair point
---
You missed the "ATTENTION PEOPLE I'M HERE TO SPREAD THE TRUTH, DON'T LET ALL THE MINMAXERS TELL YOU HOW TO PLAY! PLAY WHAT YOU ENJOY, TAKE YOUR TIME LEVELING, USE WHATEVER SPEC! THIS HAS TO BE SAID!". Aka the most common thread and opinion there is.
---
I don't think it's just about money, I think the priority is figuring out a way to convert Classic players back to Retail. That's why Retail is getting a level squish back to 60. And that's why the games are bundled in the same subscription.
---
I would really appreciate it if some more people with access to the stress test realms would join gathering and uploading data.  Unfortunatly I can't login to this realms and do it by myself because I'm not from the EU.
---
Why do you think that? I think it is practically guaranteed.
---
Funny. Here in the Netherlands I feel most people don't see it as an issue speaking English. Maybe because English is taught at a very young age and shows are never dubbed (unless it's for kids). Sure there are people that feel the need to join/create a Dutch guild, but mostly people just mix in with other nationalities.
---
The client localization and the way new client handles it.
---
Now I'm not an expert and I would assume it's not that hard to put in place but maybe it's more complicated than I expect or they don't have their local database anymore and therefore the game will be in english only and from there they decided to say 'screw local server'
---
But that's only a theory! I really think it's more of a 'we don't think there's enough player long term'
---
The broken English responses, but it wouldn’t be vanilla without gold farmers.
---
Mainly from the fact that Germany, which is 20% of the playerbase, isn't getting their own server. And the fact that Blizzard said EU would be getting "several" realms. Several isn't very many at all.
---
Yep, Tauren Rogue
---
Yeah but what if there is too much for one server but not enough for two? How do you feel if you're in the small group left out? Do you even play then?
---
So what exactly are you doing in a subreddit about WoW classic then? This does not concern you, lol
---
2 actually, how'd you know?
---
No, I do not know English ... please explain to me what that is.
---
Rather have all of those issues you described than layering.
---
Spawns were crushed. If there was dynamic respawns it was only a small increase, nothing like the turbo mode some private servers have.
---
If you have 2 hours a night 3 nights a week to dedicate to raids you'll progress with ease, any less than that you'll start to struggle but just don't expect those 6 hours to keep you in the realm first race.
---
Then you get queues and free transfers, not that complicated. What do know is that there will be a huge dropoff in the first few days and weeks to follow, so layering is warranted.
---
Right so the answer to my question is from your arse. You actually have no idea how many servers we are going to get so what you've done is form a question about how we delegate a totally imaginary amount of servers.
---
Professional Rogue tank lf raid spot as offtank.
---
Man I don't know if it's really that big of a deal. I can understand that people don't like speaking English in thier free time. But I'd prefer to play on a crowded EU server than on a almost dead German server. But I guess they could first try out national servers and then put them together if it's nessesary.
---
We depth investigate you account.
---
Who's saying at least 3 lmao, people just want to separate them by languages. Which makes it easier for *everyone* involved.
---
Sure, downloading the addon now.
---
I bet there's still less WoW players than in Germany though
---
Both need to be moving.
---
You're right. "Several" could mean as little as 1 PVP, 1 PVE, and 1 RP. I was probably being too generous.
---
Warrior or druid, warrior imo. That way you both won't have to share gear, plus she can provide conjured food for you.
---
This got removed because it reverenced to smoking weed. Now 15 years later its legalized in some states.
---
Its time to bring the joke back!
---
I also enjoy to speak with people from other country's in perfect English , then I wake up from that utopian dream join a csgo server and get yelled at 24/7 with cyka blyat idi nahui through a 2 dollar microphone that was constructed back in 91 in the soviet union.
---
Even worse in an rpg where it totally kills the immersion to read a dozen different languages in chat.
---
Part of the reason is they were likely waiting on sunders, it was common to wait for 2/3 sunders until it was safe to dps.
---
&gt;cyka
---
сука is not the same thing as "cyka". Write "suka" instead next time :)
---
So far I've not heard that we won't get localized clients. And I actually fully expect that everyone will get theirs.
---
We played SEA in sc2 at the start but the ping to uswest really was not that bad (better than SEA in many cases) and it was more competitive.
---
Gold farmers and sellers will always be a thing. They became less prevalent in retail WoW after tokens were introduced, but they’re definitely still out there. The modern client makes it much easier for GMs to catch them though, so I’d expect to see significantly less of them when the game finally launches.
---
well based on this and your last post you seem to just be pulling a shred of data that in uncorrelated and then equate about thirty opinionated subjective opinions from it.
---
You are making a baseless, and unprecedented, guess.
---
I agree but still don't want to get stuck with people that refuse to learn English.
---
As do I but at the same time I was expecting at least one german and french server.
---
Yes it does. Dynamic spawns was in actual classic and is certainly in this version of the game as well.
---
It's not nearly as aggressive of a respawn rate as on private servers but there is a clip of esfand talking to one of the original wow devs Kevin Jordan where he says classic definitely increased spawn rates of most lobs depending on how fast they were being killed.
---
"Am I the only one that's going to take it slow and enjoy the leveling process"
---
This has not been my experience in Vanilla at all.
---
It's not at all weird, Reddit is an English speaking website, not counting national subreddits. The people who play WoW but don't speak English just aren't on reddit.
---
Again: I am not arguing against laying at all. I even said:
---
&gt; I even think it is rather clever.
---
The question is: What kind of drop-off rate do we (Blizzard) expect and what will be a good layer cap? If a cap is too high (or non existent) we might end up with 10k+ players on a server after layering.
---
Why would you say “Not a chance”? If the servers are overpopulated at the end of p1(as in, higher than 3k pop) continued layering is a very real risk.
---
20% of the EU playerbase isn't getting their own server. That's a fact.
---
Blizzard said EU would be getting "several" realms. That's a fact.
---
Germany has a playerbase that is 2.7 times larger than Oceania. That's a fact.
---
So no, it's not a big leap to suggest that Oceania won't be getting their own realms.
---
You will be absolutely fine.
---
Anecdotally, classic turned my head so much I started playing a pserver as I lost interest in other games and ended up doing half of naxx playing the exact same times as you. Raid twice a week Thursday and Sunday. 3.5 hours each.
---
The guilds I was in were always like 90% Nordic+British+Dutch and everyone got along with eachother really well.
---
And it could also mean 10PvE, 10PvP and 3RP.
---
[Originally the game launched with 30+ servers.](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/EU_English_realms_info) just for English.
---
This idea five realms "probably" being too generous is a little wild to me especially when you don't know anything at all to even form any sort of probability.
---
You forgot taking a picture of their monitor like an animal, instead of taking a screenshot like respectable human being.
---
Won't /= Can't, big difference.
---
I was expecting five to six servers each, tbh.
---
NOT THE DEVILS LETTUCE
---
The attitudes in this thread match the national norms perfectly and makes me laugh. 
---
The French disdain of learning English means the French hate to play with other English speaking player, they are proud of their language to the point they have a ministry who's job it is to stop English creeping in to their language. The Dutch, Nordic, Greek and Italian players are much happier to learn English and play on an international server. The English don't see the point in learning any other language as they already speak the international language. And the Russians don't give a fuck and just play with their own (plus it is much harder for them to learn English due to the large difference in the language/letters).

---
Nice one bro, you totally got him
---
Because the World Bosses come out in Phase 2 and if Layering is still in effect then, that means infinite raid loot gets dumped into the pool. It's the #1 reason why Ion promised Layering would be gone before Phase 2.
---
It’s very similar or slightly easier than phase 3.
---
Smaller EU countries have much better English proficiency than the main ones since most English media is subbed instead of dubbed. Major countries like Germany and France are much more in their own language bubble.
---
I did this without Manual Crowd Pommeler’s since we didn’t know that was a thing. Didn’t have any issues tanking most bosses through most tiers in R13/PvP gear as a bear for our RAID#2 group. I did not tank Naxx as a Druid and only trash in AQ40. I mained a Paladin healer.
---
Lol, if Blizzard was giving 23 realms to EU, at least one of them would be German. That's a definite nope.
---
Germany is getting its own servers, in Frankfurt, they will just not be the German language. 
---
The player base argument has zero merit. The difference is Germans will still enjoy low ping whereas Australians will not, therefore there almost certainly will be at least one Australian server.
---
I don't get it
---
Did you even try to google it?
---
I don't want to appear rude, but if you're sufficiently passionate about an online game limiting you in terms of language, then you should educate yourself by taking courses for basic english at least. 
---
In our present age, English is a crucial language to learn regardless of the circumstances. To communicate with people external from your own country or just browsing the web besides a few heavily supported websites, you're expected to learn english. 
---
My grandpa was never taught english in school, but simply learned it by traveling and reading books. Although he isn't perfect, he can carry a conversation, which matters the most for Classic at least. I couldn't speak english when I played WoW, but learned it by playing. 
---
Concisely, my point is if english a language barrier, then highly consider investing time into learning the basics of the language for comprehension and replying in simple words. Regardless of age, this shouldn't prevent you from playing.
---
These people got Beta.
---
You didn't.
---
Ja! On point. Hoffe es kommt Blizzard untypisch doch noch ein Einlenken. But not very optimistic about that.
---
200ms is considered low ping by Blizzard.
---
Russkie here, the decision to only make separate russian servers is a very dumb one, there's literally 0 hype about it in russian community, very little players wanna play classic, and those who do are like me, planning to join EU for some alive servers.
---
So I played on a Polish server once and as soon as I found a guild it was really easy to socialize. Alone for the fact that you can talk about thier language and ask them questions about it or about thier culture. I feel like I had alot more to talk about with them than with other Germans. But this beeing said I still think national servers would be better since there's people that simply do not want to talk English in thier free time and that's totally okay.
---
Will turn 29 this year, right now I am single, have no kids and a new job since may.
---
For once I am actually thinking about myself and I will play this game for 1-2 years, depending how life turns out. 
---
The only plans I have right now besides WoW Classic is moving to a bigger apartment next year, getting new furniture and a new car and try to motivate myself to work out. but working out AND wow classic will be hard if not impossible :D
---
Everyone has different objectives, you aren't pathetic just because you enjoy something different than others
---
I still think international servers a better, maybe with a language pack that I see the quests in my preferred language, and a chat option to have a general English chat and a general French or German chat.
---
I mean where should the Portuguese ? The polish? The Rumanian go? They might speak English but also their mother tongue and can choose by demand what they want.
---
If I speak 3 languages even better I can activate all 3 chats ask people to find group's in all and speak the language they speak. And everybody is happy
---
He puts on an accentuated version of his personality. He's not a prick, but definitely not a sound dude either.
---
Without any real data, I would guess ~20-25k on launch day. That's probably down to 10-15k concurrent by day 2. Down to 3-5k concurrent by the end of phase 1.
---
Not an excuse. It's arrogance and laziness.
---
Right. It was meant to be a weak argument ... because it is ^^
---
Imagine posting on the internet in 2019 and being too fucking stupid to know the difference between latency and bandwidth.
---
Start with two. Merge after RLS if population is bad.
---
Ohh "definite" is it?
---
Well bugger me maybe you should quit your day job and become a billionaire by using your ability to see into the fucking future and make definitive conclusions out of conjecture.
---
I don't think anyone is defending layering in it's current state however, I truly believe that with the right implementation it could be beneficial for Classic.
---
I believe that the solution is not in removing layering as many people here advocate for. The solution lays in finding ways to control layer switching and abuse. For example, some very bright people here suggested that switching layers should only be possible while in rested zones or only in capital cities which is an awesome idea that will severely limit abuse.
---
And I'm sure that if we, as a community think about solutions rather than screeching about it, we could come up with some pretty good ideas.
---
They’re too busy enjoying the beta or watching Asmon stream the beta. Why would they waste their time here with you bitter neckbeards.
---
This must be fake...  This is some pic from some pserver or from old days of 2005.  You should not see some many players ( due to beloved layering ) in one place these days.... 
---
Ok now the sarcasm off. 
---
How ?  Did they turned off that bloody layering or how ???
---
I was on Proudmore from 2004 and 220ms was about normal. It was good as it was one the Aus pve community selected servers and it was active 24 hours. I will happily live with the ping to have a joint US-Aus server with no dead time.
---
If thats the case then Sodapoppin got famous pretty much the same way... except he did it years earlier and nowadays hes ALOT more mature.  
---
I never watched soda before but after he matured i sometimes found myself watching his shitshow saturdays, its fun to see him play new games that may or may not be completely random carbage.  
---
Infact i found atleast one game i put on my steam wishlist after seeing him play it.
---
What stats would you like on your items?
---
Druids: Yes
---
There are JP servers in OW, I don't know if they're physically located in JP however. Could be in KR since the ping difference wouldn't be that big.
---
They need to remove the chest until layering is gone
---
You mean that bug that yo were not able to look through that spyglass :D  That was fun :D
---
Gnobody \~FTFY
---
inb4 catakiddies say its necessary because they might have to compete for mobs
---
It’s legion leeway.
---
Yes, TV's typically aren't designed for much interactivity, so they have a lot higher response time latencies. A usual PC monitor is somewhere in the 5-10ms range, while many TV's are easily 5-10x as long. Also many TVs are caped at 30 or 50hz, so they won't display more than 30 or 50 frames per second.
---
I absolutely understand it, and I advocate for servers for them aswell if the playerbase allows it! If not, multilanguage servers are also a possibility.
---
So what do they do when a server has 10k pop the day p2 hits? Put 70% of a server in que and say “transfer or enjoy sitting in a que”?
---
I think you’re placing a little too much faith in Ion’s “promises”, especially given his track record.
---
This is one estimate. Might as well be ~20-25k on launch, 15-20k after week one, down to 10k by the end of phase 2.
---
Your hypothetical scenario is not more or less likely than mine.
---
138ms I remember playing with 300-500ms, I guess these days will be better though
---
What's your budget?
---
If you wait for the new Ryzen 3000 series even the weakest one should have a Vega graphics that will run Classic just fine. (so you can spare buying a dedicated card)
---
After that it's only a matter of motherboard, ram and hdd/ssd, power supply and a case.
---
Layering,Mixed language server's on EU. What a way to kill the community aspect of the game, GG blizz...
---
2/3 is the pro way  
---
3/3 is the noob way
---
No, invading Poland won't solve this problem.
---
I'm not against spell batching, but as time has gone on, I've started questioning whether or not I want it back...
---
Oh well, I'll live either way.
---
Probably?
---
I dont think they know about oceania
---
I don't know what RLS is. Seems like Blizzard went with the most fair and flexible route while acknowledging that it definitely isn't ideal. Maybe they will provide more color.
---
CPU: Intel Core i5-3330, AMD FX-6300, or better
---
RAM: 4 GB
---
VIDEO CARD: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 750 Ti or AMD Radeon R7 260X or better
---
FREE DISK SPACE: 10GB
---
Those are the recommended specs for Legion, which Classic is using as its engine base.
---
Hail the common tongue
---
I think this one pic sums is all up why we are all against layering.  This is 100x times more fun than some stupid layering where you would see max 10 ppl...
---
... What? No?
---
"So you guys didn't learn English at school?"
---
Kevin Jordan confirmed that original vanilla wow had dynamic respawns. It was in the original game. Layering though... if that was in the game originally, Vanilla would never have survived.
---
The decision to make only russian servers separate is what amazes me most, as a russkie i see literally 0 interest in classic among russians, those separate servers are going to be d e a d.
---
you mean the channel run by the guy whose entire online identity is based on creating inflammatory content about random world of warcraft streamers? the one making weird, cringy, pizza-gate-tier videos with strange anti-american slants?
---
See tjose things on the ledt side in his main backpack, that he has 7 of? They come from the chest in Gurubashi Arena which has a 3hr respawn timer. It is a highly contested chest spawn and what he probably did was get there early on STRESS TEST which has a cap of level 15 and grabbed the chest then jumped layer. The chest also gives items worth alot of gold AND its where the potions came from. "Herbs" has nothing to do with it. 
---
Basically, the point of this picture is to illustrate that a low level character could go to Gurubashi at the launch of Classic and secure himself multiple of them by jumping layers, while in Vanilla there was only ONE chest available per 3hrs. There is still only one chest available per layer per 3hrs in Classic aswell, but that still means more chests than originally.
---
Didn't they upgrade the client already to BfA one? Version number is not 7.xx anymore.
---
Hunter and Shadow priest
---
**O O G A**
---
Okay, I’ll bite. Let’s pretend layering is not a thing:
---
WHERE IS ASMON
---
WHISPER 1 FOR ASMON RAID
---
DID YOU SEE WHAT ASMON DID
---
ASMONS DOING THIS THING POGGERS
---
WHERE CAN I FIND ASMON
---
....
---
I'm an idiot. I actually believed it and got excited
---
Yep, queues or transfers to new realms.
---
Add to that that many French and German players are also old, like 50-60 and of course that population couldn't learn English as easy as we could, us young'uns.
---
You are the arrogant one to expect people to speak english when most of them don't have any use of it (and so don't practice it) outside of school.
---
Nah doesn't sound like the same guy.
---
True, and it will vary by realm. That's what queues and free transfers are for. I think Blizzard has pretty decent data for this stuff, at least enough for it not to be a huge issue on most realms.
---
This is bad, but I do think limitations on layering are what's needed rather than getting rid of it altogether.
---
No layering:
---
1. In contested zones (not my idea, but it's a good one.)
---
2. After level 15/20.
---
3. After 2 weeks.
---
If they can commit to this, I have no qualms with layering.
---
A few weeks after launch is still way too long though, most early game friend list building takes place in the early stages of the game tbh
---
I hear that, Perth is like 260ms
---
Upvoted, don't tell me what to do (jk jk)
---
Finding 40 people is painful, let alone them being competent, knowing what to do, them knowing the fights and being prepared / knowing their class, etc. It does not matter if the guild is casual or hardcore. The logistics that come with preparing and organizing a 40 men raid should not be underestimated.
---
And if you PUG prepare to have at least 2-3 of those 40 not attuned, some people doing stupid shit etc!
---
So yeah if you wanna raid seriously without spending 2-3 hours setting up a PUG, get in a guild. I'm sure there'll be guild alliances too where 2-3 guilds combine efforts, especially at Launch before everyone is 60 to start clearing some bosses while your guild is sufficiently staffed and prepared.
---
If they did, it’s not running the latest BFA engine because that one supports DX12 and multi-threading. Classic does not. It doesn’t care how many cores your CPU has.
---
I've posted a link with my comment to the minimum and specified system requirements.
---
[https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/76459](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/76459)
---
With the next gen of CPU/GPU coming out on 07/07/2019, you're likely to get discount on older spec items. But a build consisting of those requirements shouldn't be too much, however, I'd try and future proof yourself and go for slightly higher specs.
---
Maybe AMD Ryzen 5 and a 1060GTX at a reduced rate could be an okay pick up if discounted enough.
---
Sharding the lowbie zones. Or rolling layering back so it's not the entire game, and only the lowbie zones.
---
Need on whatever you want
---
Have some faith? They made BfA.
---
You sound like a Preach fan.
---
I mean I speak German but I want to play on an international server.
---
I can play in German and I would like to offer my healing service to German speaking players and play with them in German if they want.
---
But still I want to play on an international/English server and play with whoever wants to play with me in English or german
---
Ravencrest became the unofficial Danish server
---
I wish I could make this before the launch, but I lack the imagination and know how to make it even look remotely this good
---
You may be used to people not needing to communicate on BFA but on classic it's a different ball game.
---
This is the funniest thing I've ever read, thank you.
---
not really.  6+ shaman, so getting tier gear ain't easy.   You can wear cloth and leather, but then your competing with shaman, druids, and priests(cloth).  
---
Took me a year to get full t1 on my shaman.
---
I hate to be one of those twitch kids that shout "cringe" at everything, but fuck me those fake letters to the spouse/partner/SO make me cringe.

---
Hey that’s a great idea! If I ever wanted to work again. Now my money just works for me.
---
You are saying this in every thread and im gonna tell you again, you think that all servers are english but they are not. They are international. No on eis getting their own servers and this isnt in any way shape or form an indication for how many servers there will be
---
&gt;Just because I have an Anus, doesn't mean I have tried ~~Like~~ Gay Anal Sex.
---
FTFY
---
Thanks for the answer, ye, looks like this game just isnt for me, im very rational human being.
---
Then you need a server for Transnistria and Gagaouzia !
---
It's a shame, but I might just go back to pvt servers if Classic disappoints... With layering and the possibility of ending up on a server where most people speak german or french all the time, that's starting to look like a real possibility. 
---
I honestly cannot believe how badly they fucked up something that started so great in such a short amount of time.
---
&gt;Nowhere did they say "just a few weeks"
---
I don't have the link, but Ion said exactly that.
---
so, it's not [this weird-ass guy that probably has several mental defects and social disorders](https://www.twitch.tv/i_hate_kurthos)? that's not his twitch account, that he linked to from his youtube account with a nazi-staysafe avatar?
---
Wow Big Shitty this is a very good meme I rate it very good yes
---
You forgot the "I did X in classic and had more fun than doing X in retail" comments.
---
Saying "its a beta" this close to release is just being willfully ignorant. Major changes very, very rarely happen this close to the release of any big title.
---
Can we stop with the layering drama? They already said it's a solution to combat the high quantity of logins the first days and to avoid starter zones with 3000 people where you'd need to wait an hour to kill a quest mob.
---
They were always transparent saying they will never do that in late-game or once the servers are stable.
---

Feral works well for pvp. Pretty much every premade will have one for flagrunning. Balance can work for PvP but it's not great and you'll have to heal in raids to get gear.

Addons that you literally cant play a class properly without.

Hunter: Auto Shot Bar

Old School RS also proves this concept is viable

Selfishly, I really enjoyed the multiculturalism of private servers.
---
X  
---
Doubt
---
And this is how echo chambers are made ladies and gentlemen!
---
Hmm, I hope multi core support comes eventually because I just recently upgraded my laptop to a 4 core lol.
---
So can someone explain why layering didn’t kick in here? Didn’t have access to the stress test
---
Oh it definitely is. There was absolutely no reason to remove the language designations from realms if they were going to launch enough realms in EU to have them anyway.
---
Umm...
---
Blizzard into Blizzard gives you 1.5s to move faster than the mobs.  
---
You will not hit every mob with nova until you no longer need nova.  
---
You cannot add mobs to your stack without CoC, as you don't have the time outside of Nova, and you need to get blizzard range then.
---
You're basically right. But the problem is that France, Germany, Italy and Spain lack heavily behind in their ability to speak english compared to Scandinavia, the benelux states or even eastern europe. Due to the massive dub culture of these countries most people are never forced to learn english beyond what they learn in school. Not having dubs may suck at first but is a huge advantage for smaller european countries. I've played online with 10 year old swedes who spoke fluently english and have played with french and italians who couldn't even speak a proper english sentence. Now that is not necessarily their fault but the fault of the dub culture that shouldn't really exist anymore today. It's 2019 not the post WW2 years.
---
Yeah of course they can, just like you could learn Russian if there were only Russian language servers, but you wouldn't. My point is, sure it would be great if people took this as an opportunity to learn and maybe some will, but some won't and they'll still play the game.
---
You can stick to this principle if you want, but it doesn't change the fact that at least the Germans and the French will snatch up a server each and you better hope it's not the one you levelled on for your first month.
---
Depends how you define success. If it gives an authentic vanilla experience to the people who are looking for that then I think it will be viewed as a success. It's not going to be a big moneymaker for Blizzard or be their next big game or anything like that. But it could influence their next mmo, which would be great.
---
Or maybe the purpose here was to compare the feeling of accomplishment for getting east-to-get loot to easy-to-get loot?
---
Why are you making a strawman that it's about the challenge all of a sudden?
---
Untrue. OW has Australian servers and you will never be connected to a US server. Likewise SEA is in The Americas for Blizz games and you'll always be connected to the SG servers.
---
Technically, enough invading would solve this problem entirely.
---
Sir, you are literally suggesting another layer.
---
10/10 shitpost
---
You need to stop deluding yourselves, it's 100% working as intended.
---
it was 7 different layers
---
I'm from Norway too. I don't mind if its in English.
---
One of my favourite quest chains!
---
and farm some gold
---
It seems to me americans that are the more rude among people cause of their innate every man for himself mentality. Private servers primarily NA showcase this very much by just peeking into the Barrens chat.
---
2 hours a night 3 nights a week?  2 hours is almost nothing since invites, summoning, buffs already takes around 30 minutes.
---
I am in OP's situation: I have a full time job and a girlfriend and I want to raid, but my approach is: rather have a day with 3-4 raiding hours and then rest than 2 hours many days. 
---
Each one to his own!
---
Maybe I'm arrogant, but at least I'm not lazy.
---
Germans, French and Italians have significantly less incentive to learn English than say, Finns or Swedes.
---
&gt; then you should educate yourself by taking courses for basic english at least. 
---
Basic English is not the problem. But classic was about chit-chatting and having a fun time. And to fully participate in that you need more then basic English.
---
RemindMe! 2 Months

I am really scared that we dont get enough servers an have no other Choice than playing on a "streamer server". The recent news about eu hint that they want to invest less in server structure and stuff to save money

Not an hour goes past without Americans crying about Chinese people ruining the server I currently play on.
---
It's sad, but this right here boils it down quite well.
---
Did not expect the third one. I lol’d.

By that logic servers could be mandarin with the greatest number of native speakers. Guna guess you'd be pissed if that happened and U couldn't communicate

It's a good opportunity for some private servers to keep their stuff up and wait for that happen.

As a shaman raid tank who has been playing for +6years I can tell you shaman do not have problems with threat especially in a dungeon setting and mana is not an issue as well.

All and all shaman tanks just simply require more effort to get things accomplished.

Untrue. You'll always be connected to Australian servers in OW. SEA is likewise lumped into the American region and you'll always be connected to SG servers.

Get BS and make some keys. :D
---
It's definitely very cultural. At the same time, I've been on servers that were unofficially dominated by a specific language (most recently pre-FFXIV Stormblood I ended up on what ultimately became the go-to French server) and try as you might it's often simply a less smooth experience due to the unwillingness/incapacity of people to understand you. Frankly, as much as I enjoy an international experience, I don't see a benefit into forcing one. The people that would prefer to speak English would do so regardless, this only serves to force those that still won't onto the same server.

The thing with nordic languages is: They're relatively small languages. Especially Finnish, and we've kinda made our peace with the fact that if we want to communicate with the rest of the world, we speak English. Because no one speaks our language anyways. 
---
If you're French, German, Spanish.. You can get by with just your own language. And when you're used to that, it's a hard habit to break.
---
What? The question of whether to have servers or not is a lot easier to answer than how many servers.
---
I like streamers, they’re not the problem. It’s the people like this who follow them that are the problem xD

The most famous speedlevelers recommend taking skinning because skin mats sell for a lot to vendors. If not you won't be able to afford mounts a lot of food and things like that.
---
Speak with him, speak with him then you get the seal of wrynn. Still remember that ring from vanilla because of the riddle me and my mates made up.
---
Nah. Worst case is they cancel Classic altogether on August 26th.
---
Not speaking English isn't laziness.
---
Blizzard: "Not enough people joining the stress test."
---
Me: "I'll join!"
---
Blizzard: "Are you giving us money?"
---
Me: "Uhm...no, sorry."
---
Blizzard: \*sigh\* "Guess we're shutting down some realms then."
---
Yeah, I'm just a little bit sad that I don't have money to gamble on an invite. : \\
---
From a costs perspective there's almost no difference between layers and separate realms.
---
In Europe it most certainly is. It's the best way to communicate with people from many kinds of countries.
---
Because few people will stick around. Just trust Blizzard.

---
Someone did the lord's work
---
I think 10 layers is a bit much. Once most servers hit 3-4 layers, new servers should be made.
---
I am saying that's a minimum to progress at an alright speed, that gives 90 minutes. In MC that's probably 2 bosses, you won't clear the place in a week until your very well geared but most people could do MC in about 4 hours /played without much trouble if they were close to BiS and knew all the tactics.
---
the truth is sometimes hard to learn

---
Is it tho 🤔
---
It just bothers me that nearly the entire community made it's opinion on sharding known, and the negative impact it would have on gameplay. Yet it's still being slipped in there now as a necessity known as "layering". Layering sounds an awful lot like sharding with extra steps to me.
---
You do realize they banned automated addons from vanilla around the BWL launch because you could play the game from 1 button?
---
That is pretty much the opposite of 'vast majority dfid not use any addons'...
---
No, from the world record holder (on Blizzard realms anyway): 
---
&gt; If your goal is to level really fast, then you're gonna have to stop worrying about professions, they will slow you down if anything.  The only profession I use is First Aid. If you are a casual player then learning the professions can be a way for you to gain some extra gold on the side to help you get your lvl 40 mount sooner.
---
&gt; Another thing to note is that I usually have to borrow gold from players when speedleveling on new servers (I pay them back in double) in order to buy my mount in the mid 40s.  I do this to make up for the lack of professions as a way to get gold.
---
Jesus Christ
---
So how is this different from phasing/sharding again?
---
I think avoiding where streamers play is the more stable option if anything given that
---
To be fair there was a huge gurubashi arena battle royale type thing going on that looked really fun, layering was more the problem here
---
"Better idea"? The same "better idea" they've had about how retail should develop and making a mobile diablo? Don't be silly, only thing they want is to make the most amount of money at the least cost and expense of quality. 
---
And layering will be precisely a reason for drop in pop, not a remedy for it. You think people want to play Classic in order to see how others disappear in front of their damn faces cause they hopped to a different layer at will? Yeah, they can just play retail if they want that immersion.
---
Keep seeing the world "layers" associated with these streamers what does that mean?
---
Haha what? You mean there is 8 languages in Europe. Ahh you mean Icelandic, Norwegian, Sami, Swedish,  Danish, Swedish, Finnish and English?
---
How about you just let people enjoy what they want to enjoy and leave them alone considering *none* of it affects you?
---
Did it ever cross your mind that maybe ze germans dont get get their own server because other countries cant sustain one in their language? 
---
 Maybe the polish or italian or greek WoW players are not enough to get a server dedicated to their language.  
---
By mixing them with the german playerbase on an english speaking server everyone will play on more populated servers. Otherwise you might have a german , english and french server doing fine while the others are dead.
---
I was just pitching this idea btw, I have no clue about actual playe numbers and wether they varrant a server or not. In my opinion it ust isnt as clear cut as you make it out to be.
---
No, why? Although you can't speak the language fluently, people can easily interpret your message. For example, I've met several russians who carried a conversation or conveyed a message by using very simple phrases along with keywords, like "I go dire wailing caverns, 4 man", "thank for join", "where you from?" etc. 
---
Although you might struggle accurately express yourself, you can easily carry an understandable conversation.
---
I'm actually glad he's speaking out against it. He was one of those saying the game is dead on arrival if it has sharding in it. I just figured he was biting his tongue after getting close with Blizz, but eventually the truth will set you free.
---
So not looking forward to playing with people who can't speak English like at all.
---
Alright, he did say that. This is their goal though and not a commitment. This is a huge difference, just because they want to only have it in for a few weeks, does not mean that it will only be in for a few weeks. If whatever metric they set for removal of layering is not said they will keep it in. The definite metrics are:
---
* stabilized population (rather vague)
---
* beginning of phase 2 (very specific and latest possible time)
---
So while he said "For the first few weeks", that is only their (and our) ideal goal and I believe that he means that. Be nobody knows how it will turn out after launch. Maybe the drop-off is dramatically over estimated and we'll end up with overcrowded servers. Or maybe it works out perfectly and after 2 weeks the server population has stabilized at a good level
---
This is a really cool concept !! One problem that might arise is balance though. I a recent stream Esfsnd was talking about a chat he had with the vanilla wow lead class designer and how they tried to buff ret paladin but even minor tweaks made them do way to much dps.
---
It's not playing with people from the same nationality but about people with the same language. Back in the old days, my first guild was mainly populated by Canadian french speakers. They choosed to play on french server even if they had more latence and were playing when it was the night in France. Just because it was more confortable to them to play with people using the same primary language as them
---
Just so ppl know this was 7 different layers in 12 minutes on the public stress test.
---
But 16 debuff slots and 400 ms batching are prefectly fine. Hmmmmmmmmmm.
---
That is true. I just don't want to feed this illusion of theirs that their language is still relevant, which it's not. German is still very relevant, but it gets dwarfed by English.
---
/who Asmongold 
---
Stop being such a smoothbrain
---
Straight up not going to bother if we're stuck on NA servers. I'm pumped for classic but I can't play with 300ms ping again.
---
#C C A F
---
Layering only works on a continent wide basis, I dont think you can pick and choose zones to implement it. If you have 3000 people in a layer which is the most the server can support with say 5 layers, and you then had an unlayered contested zone, it doesn't work because the server can't handle potentially 15,000 people going into one zone.
---
&gt; nightfall 
---
Like 0, because it was only in the game for 4 months in that state before people quit raiding.
---
The two things different from vanilla are the 2 biggest fuckups.
---
~~Sharding~~ Layering and no language specific realms.
---
Stop messing with it and just release what was done ~15 years ago
---
I’ll turn 32 before classic releases and I have a spouse and two children. I played a bit after original launch in 2005, played up until Cataclysm release, stopped after that. I’m excited as all hell to return to vanilla wow. Never made it much past one or two bosses in MC and ZG with my 60 gnome mage. Literally haven’t scratched the surface of end game content, so I’m looking forward to that as well as levelling and making friends.
---
Several "old" people planned on come Back for wow Classic. Do you know what they did at school time. They played wow. Now they have Jobs they don t need to speak English. And even people that can speak English or play with a english Client, like me, mostly want to speak their own language. It s Just better to express humour, sarkasm. The whole rp idea. My nostalgia was a German wow, i was in pservers and i hated multilanguage Communities.
---
I heard that he grew up, but since beta came out, he's basically reverted back to his toxic self. I had hope for him, but it was fruitless lol.
---
Questie is for scrubs

---
You forgot - "Am I the only one who wants to just take things slow and enjoy the ride?"
---
Neat, thanns
---
this
---
Thanks ^^
---
Blizzard only supports English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese in the EU. Though there are more Italian and Portuguese players off their designated realms than on.
---
They only supported English, German, and French when the game first launched.
---
&gt;  And the healer was actually running low on mana a lot so we all traded him what mana stuff we had, it also kept us talking during the dungeon. 
---
Low leveling in Classic-Wotlk was awfully painful because of spell ranks and being weaker in general. Once you hit max level in Wotlk it turns into the samething as retail.
---
All the different alcohols that now just get you drunk to different degrees probably would have had short buffs too if brewing had made it in to the game.  Would be like alchemy in that regard but perhaps tertiary like first aid and fishing.  Would be a cool addition.
---
It's ok you can spam /1 INV TO ENGLISH LAYER  ;)
---
Are you the official representant of Classic WoW? I hope not.
---
I'm not mad, I'm disappointed. Cool rig tho
---
Rogue horde, not sure if orc or undead? Which proffesions would you recommend me? Which one generates more money and which one is more useful?
---
I have no idea wether or not that was the case.
---
regardless of this, the statement is definitly true. The other classes are just missing a *soul*, you know...
---
I started in bc. Played on private servers for 3 years. Guess I shouldn't be allowed to play though 
---
Eat a sack of cocks
---
Are you assuming that I made my comment thinking that BfA is the same thing as Classic? Oof. My reasoning behind this is that I'd rather play with people from other countries than from my own. If they make international servers the public channel language should always be English and it should be enforced with rules.
---
 Also talking about the client, I wouldn't want it supported on my own language because it sounds really bad/goofy and takes away from the game's grandeur and I can't even imagine Anduin or Sylvanas being dubbed in Finnish.
---
You’re a big ol dunderhead pal
---
Pets don't actually tag mobs for you though, do they?
---
Do you speak French, Romanian, German, Polish, Swedish, Irish, maybe even some Spanish? No? Well then you gonna have a problem on these realms, or you better get started learning 6-10 languages.
---
Lol that comment you linked literally says you need GOLD to purchase the mount and skills by 40 and he's asking for loans. Every speedrunner uses skinning to just be able to afford mount and skills, nobody will ask for loans let alone will anyone give you 20 gold unless you're their friend. 
---
Speedrunning tactics need to be focused around being solo, or duo if you're in a group of 2, not involving begging for money outside
---
~Who in australia is getting 138ms ping to LA?
---
It's a start, but we have to go much further than just poland for that.
---
Our city still stands, stronger
---
I disagree. You might thinkthat their explanation is bullshit buut i domt think so because ot applies to me. Im portuguese, lived in switzerland all my life, have italian and english speaking friends. This will allow me to play on the same server as everyone else which was the reason blizzard gave for not splitting the servers.
---
Why though? I literally talk about blue posts from blizz this is not working as they want it to work.
---
No. EU == European Union.
---
I do like him! To be honest I’d never watched any WoW streamers/creators until the classic beta, I’m discovering new ones everyday. Preach is a pretty likeable bloke imo
---
Yeah, plus shit always happens. Someone leaves or Dc's, you need to find a replacement, etc. It's not like you'll spend 90 minutes just killing and killing. 90 mins isn't much for a raid.
---
Im in dem gleichen boot
---
I think Japan would be closer to NA ping wise, I get 200ms to japan from Australia and about 280 to NA.
---
For a company success means lots of money, which equates to lots of subs through classic players. It's not that difficult to define really.
---
&gt; It's not going to be a big moneymaker for Blizzard
---
How do you know? It might as well be their new big moneymaker. The hype and press coverage is pretty big. Even the onion (satirical online news site) had an article about it! I would not be surprised if it surpasses BfA
---
Well guess then this friend building will start a bit later then... 
---
Imho its only limiting you in which people you can meet and doesnt destroy the whole possibility

Ion said in an interview “servers could have anywhere from 3-10 layers”
---
Also, even if it was 3 layers. That’s still 10k people fighting for your mobs. Especially at 15 where 80% of horde is in the Barrens and 80% of Alliance is in Westfall. 
---
Also, I’m not sure many people will want to refill after they’ve already dumped hours and hours into their characters
---
Well played
---
Learn English then. Very Basic language. There is legit concern regarding the more complex and "niche" European languages, but one should not complain about English. Its so basic, so easy, most children speak it now. Videogames are also a perfect teaching medium.
---
It's not that you won't be able to tell ppl something you want. It's the fact that they will communicate in their own language and you won't understand anything.   
---
Have you ever been talking with tourists? It's really annoying when you are in a larger group and a part of that group keeps talking in their own language and only speaks english when they specifically want to tell you something.
---
&gt; Every speedrunner uses skinning
---
Well no, the fastest speedrunner does not.
---
Not my fault you cannot open your browser, type in [twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv) and click World of Warcraft.
---
Telling your clients that they're idiots in such a subtle way, smooth marketing strategy.
---
You seem to be having a fundamental misunderstanding of the problem. We're talking about a supermassive launch day that **needs** to be on **very few** servers. This kind of bottleneck can and will persist for a week+, because people will literally log off, and then the bottleneck will continue the next day, repeating indefinitely.
---
At the same time, unplayability **will** cost us long term players. It's just a terrible, elitist idea to intentionally make the game unplayable.
---
You don't hop into another layer at will. You clearly do not understand layering and it undermines your comment.
---
I was agreeing with your first point, not the one about there only being five servers, that's pure conjecture. 
---
Even so it doesn't matter. If blizzard thinks the community isn't big enough to support a pve and pvp server thye can pick the one that seems more likely to succeed and the people who most care about the community will have somewhere to go while those think the servery type is more important can choose to put up with a multilingual server. 
---
There needs to be *some* choice and order to this mess. Even if it is grouping latinate and germanic langues together, receptively.
---
Who hurt you?
---
If does seem like it. It's like they expect an initial rush but then for everyone to hate it and quit.
---
Layers are a dynamic system, not a static one. Its not as simple as saying "it has 3 layers" or "it has 10 layers". Think of layering more like a dimmer switch. It can have 30 layers at one moment, then the next hour perhaps its been reduced to 4.
---
Each layer doesn't have to hold 3,000 players at any given moment either. I don't know why you think this to be the case.
---
Yet another case of someone whining about layering while not understanding what it actually is or what its for.
---

Uh what? Have you played on a pserver?

He didn’t have that loot table until 1.4 (Phase 2). Before that, he gave nothing.

Not for or against but dont the majority of Germans speak at least conversational English anyways. Practically any one I talked to in Germany knew English.
---
[Leeway does exist on some (not sure if all) private servers at least.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Rx0I5PpJU) 
---
Whether it's to the same extreme as the BETA or not I'm unsure but it's certainly there in some form.
---
well, it sounds like they formed a raid...
---
Well duh we have a low pop.
---
But we've never had issues filling our realms until the game started going downhill.
---
The dub culture has nothing to do with WW2 or the political landscape. It is simply because the market is big enough to make money off of it. And of course because people are used to it now and are willing to pay money for it.
---
This can't be a serious comment
---
And eventually we'd simply run into the issue of having to split people into localized accents of a single language. If only there was a better solution to this.
---
PServer stats have about 30% of players even making it to level 60 I think, so that's probably the assumption they are making as well.
---
I'm not sure they're wrong either. A lot of us are excited for Classic and want to love it - but no idea if the 15 year old formula can really deliver in the same way today. I haven't played a PServer personally so I have no clue if I'm sticking around for weeks or years. It could go either way.
---
Even the amount of people they have on their streams, is nothing compared to the amount of people playing. It doesn't influence anything of your personal play in even the tiniest bit. I would even say it helps us, as it brings more attention to the game we all enjoy and love, and gets more people in to it! I love the bullshit they pull off on streams with big city raids, because i used to do that in the past. Kiting mobs to the enemy city? Been there! Knowing what the enemy faction is planning and trying to stop it? Yep! Done that. It is actually great to see the community side of the game being shown besides their own communities they show on stream. For instance Esfand. He keeps on telling people to /join server chat etc, does a lot of comms with people, these guys plan community events (Asmond's mount and transmog competitions made me as a solely pet collector way more interested in mounts and transmogs, and i've been playing since vanilla beta.) I think we get way more good then the precieved "bad" people think is going on.
---
Esports, thats another thing. I personally think stuff like ingame flight, warforging/titanforging, lack of content (even tho there is "more stuff to do" from an amount of content perspective, i feel like i have less to do now then in an xpac like tbc, where i could log in and play all day. Now i only log in for raids, and play Terraria besides that.) are way more detrimental to the game, as they influence everything and the design philosophy is not optimal.
---
I am not 10.  I don't watch twitch
---
And yet people still take the bait.
---
I was halfway through writing a post condemning you but I decided to read up about layering first. I agree with much of what you say, although I think it’s not feasible to watch for streamers 24/7, maybe they could add a separate chat channel that people can disable to be removed with layering in phase 2. 
---
In any case, If like me you had no idea what’s going on - read this! It helped a lot 
---
[WoW Head description of layering](https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow) 
---
The spam seems more acceptable knowing it won’t be forever.
---
I'm french and I totaly agree with you. But we make progress to learn and speak english. And we enjoy more and more speaking english with stranger. But we are not at the point to recognize english as an universal language. It's just a language among other like german or japanese, for us. Also, we learn english very lately in school and the course are very bad. We tend to learn Oxford English in a very strict way, making the majority of us, hate this language. I'm 28 years old, and I can tell I'm almost ok (I wouldn't say fluent) in english, but only since like 4 to 5 years.
---
We are not prepared to play an MMORPG in english, good enough for an fps like CS:GO or Overwatch, but not for a game who need so mich social interaction like WoW in is vanilla form
---
I mean yeah. If your max is lfr i dont know why would anyone be excited about the loot.
---
Well, there is uncertainty in the tech, so I hope they can do something. If it's not easy and they actually can't, then they need to limit it to 2 weeks at the very least.
---
Double decker dunder
---
Based on your reaction I'd say you definitely shouldn't be allowed to play.
---
We don't want people like you in Classic.
---
l-hope is infested with chinks that just dont know any english, atleast a german person would understand you, they might still not answer but they understand and can do what you ask etc
---
Sad fucks.
---
If the server language is set to English then people should speak it on public channels and it should be enforced. Everyone can speak whatever language they want in guild chat or on raids, this isn't the problem. If there's a lot of guilds not taking English speakers then that's the cold fact, better start searching for one that speaks English. And I'm fine with this.
---
I don't know if it's the screen I'm playing on right now but Durotar is intensely red or bright orange and it's extremely painful to look at
---
They also said something about the server cap of 3.000 was because of technical limitations of that time. We might end up with a higher cap around 5k.
---
And I'm all for 3k layers ending up with a 5k final cap.
---
Doesn't ducking matter one iota
---
Clearly you are, since you would downvote a post saying damage on Beta is lower without actually having bothered to check.
---
Even blizzard confirmed this in their comparison tests. Not that I expect someone with your nick to actually be mature enough to go check facts and shit ;)
---
I vote to revise the proposition to deny the OP and perhaps his immediate circle of friends access to Classic
---
Depends on what you farm. I remember farming satyrs in azshara for my epic mount and I think I bandaged every 3-5 mobs? Something like that. Only ate when K got really low or needed the foodbuff. If your fury you tend to have fairly good sustain against lower level mobs.
---
Well, that's a completely different issue. Yes, that will be an recurring issue most players will experience throghout Classic if there's only english servers, but my sole point is I think personally you should english if you're interested in playing a game where a predominant number of people speak English.
---
Ist simple because raids in classic are 40 people now that all speak a diffrent language and even if the raidleader talks in english i bet out if 40 people At lest 15 wont understand hin 100% and that realy is a Problem.People will Build german/french/whatever only guilds because easyer to communicate.So if you are say Italian but all Raid guilds in ur Server are german/french/spain than gz you want to raid?HF rerolling 1-60 + gearing up AGAIN in another realm and have wastet like 3 month+ with a char you cant raid with.THAT is the opposide of the "Players are more free" Shit blizz is trying to sell us.
---
It just seems like they're trying to dodge extra costs in every corner. I wonder which entity may be pushing them to do this. HMMMM.
---
It this was the case. The dungeons would not be as buggy as they are now. Snap locations, weird optimized shadowmeld pulls etc. Don't tell me bliz did that all "for the esports". The thing MDI does is actually show people how it is done on a high level, and i have gotten several small strategies from watching it, that we use in our personal guild runs (For instance Kings' Rest, we now skip all to first boss, clear that room, get reap exactly under boss, then go to gauntlet, while one of the guys goes back to pick up the 2 constructs we skipped just before boss room. If MDI wasnt around, i wouldnt have done this strat, and it easily saves 3-5 minutes.) Same with death skips and other tactics. Once again, it does not influence your own gameplay one little tiny bit.
---
You'd only be pathetic if you were prioritizing a video game over your family/job  
---
Thankfully I have no spouse or kids so I'm good. Just gotta do something about that pesky job..
---
There are twitch clips of ppl hopping to different layer through an invite to dodge fights.   
---
You clearly do not understand layering and it undermines your comment.
---
How the fuck is this even a slippery slope argument? When did this ever happen anywhere? Do you even know how dialects work?
---
And how taxing will it be for them to end up on an English dominated server? This is just terrible all around.
---
#you no take candle#
---
Warrior is a lot better once you get some decent gear as youll end up hitting like a train and because of your high health and armor you can take a lot of abuse
---
I don't mind playing with french or spanish, but only if they spoke good english and we are all aware that in most of the cases that not the case.
---
Clearly a setup, fishing for more views
---
What if i enjoy making fun of people reposting the same content over and over again on a subreddit meant for discussion. Am i not allowed to have enjoy that?
---
One would think that the combined 250k Twitch viewership at start of Beta was indicative of something. I suppose not though.
---
Maybe we need an opt in streamer layer menu option.
---
They’re still supporting all the languages they already support. Nothing is changing there. The only thing that announcement meant is that EU isn’t getting enough servers to warrant any one server being language specific.
---
I agree, atleast spanish people can begone as they refuse to communicate in english, i feel like you germans are very nice to deal with. But i wouldnt want a "norwegian server", imagine how dead it would be... haha

&gt;Seal twisting was tested already, and it works on the beta.
---
Yes and no. You can twist Seal of Justice. But typically Seal Twisting means changing to a different damage dealing seal to take advantage of both effects. You could do this in TBC with Seal of Blood where you you get both a Command Proc and a Seal of Blood proc on the same swing.
---
ppoor tween lashes out cuz he is wrong 
---
did you get downvoted
---
poor thing
---
Yeah because the most popular private servers arent international anyway. Not only are they internation bjt intercontinental.
---
So everyone on tv is retarded? Everyone in movies? Singers/bands you listen to? Artists you watch their art are retarded? Not a fan of sports too? Because all of these are people that earn their money by other people liking what they do when watching it. I wouldn't call that retarded, I'd actually claim a person like that has (at least) average or higher IQ for finding something they are good at and making money off of it. I only sense jealousy in posts like these.
---
For sure Warrior is a lot better once he gets decent gear. My question was how he is when there is no decent gear and he needs to farm for Gold and so on.
---
&gt;I want to play on an english server with all of my friends without running the risk to figure out that we're going to be excluded when half of us are already level 40. I don't think anyone wants this.
---
This! I like playing internationally too, but you can't force other people to do it and expect that it's going to turn out well.
---
Of course they do
---
Would that not inherently also infer that Blizzard's confident that no Nationality is capable of filling their own servers?
---
They think there's not enough germans or french to fill 5 servers?
---
The stats are a joke tbh. My main realm says its a 1k to 1,2k horde server, meanwhile I did not see any1 in warmode from horde (and rarely any when I play on horde w/o wm) in the last 30 days. My server is very very clearly highly alliance based.
---
Same with the highest german pve servers - My realm with appearantly 1000 chars gets like 3 messages in trade chat per hour, the highest server only has 2,7k and yet you get 3 new messages per 5sec. Wowprogress only tracks raiding chars &amp; chars within those raiding guilds and they are up to 20k chars.
---
Same with ravencrest and silvermoon; the 2nd biggest pve server in eu has 4k chars and Silvermoon, the biggest, has 55k chars? What a joke lol
---
At some point you were able to kill your own faction without them being pvp tagged with it equipped, but it was only for a short time
---
layering isn't implemented to reduce overcrowding (it can't accomplish that).
---
It's to remove server queues.
---
No, look at the picture. Lol
---
Ive got the exact same farm point in my mind haha. Good to know. Have you played on a PvP Server? Im a bit scared about the fact that Warrior was always a good to go target in wPvP.
---
They already have regional support on live wow, it's no more expensive or difficult to expand those branches of the support team to include Classic, than it is to expand the English support services for Classic I'd assume. The fact that it says English or International or w/e it's gonna say on the servers, also doesn't mean that you'll get any fewer German tickets than you otherwise would. The Germans who don't speak English aren't gonna learn to, just because Blizzard doesn't acknowledge their existence.
---
I'm not sure if the classic addon is super different, but sometimes on 1.12 it can bug out. I think the command is something like /questie NUKE 
---
If Questie was never working at any point after installing, make sure the folder name is named correctly.
---
Vanilla raids aren't all that though. Especially MC, if it's a DPS that DCs you can easily ignore them and move on. If a guild can't get at least 2 bosses down in 60 minutes then they have deep issues going on that's 6 bosses in MC without a longer weekend raid (OP said weekends could be longer, I'm sure most people are in this boat)
---
I'm just going by my personal experience from retail vanilla and pservers, even in Vanilla our raids started at 8 and finished at 10:30 and we could get through 3 or 4 bosses a night without too much trouble when we were all scrubs and thought moving out of the raid for baron bombs was the pinnacle of boss mechanics.
---
So Ralph Fiennes is a prick because he plays Voldemort in Harry Potter? Or Josh Brolin is a fucking asshole because he plays a bad guy in a move? Because thats the same kind of reasoning you use.
---
just like I remember it
---
I will go with a completely different explanation, this is Blizzard stating they don't believe the game will have sufficient interest to maintain servers by language.
---
I don't want it back. Server hardware and Internet have evolved way past that. When playing on the beta it's noticeable how laggy and slow every interaction is, it feels bad to play.
---
There is no reason to add artificial lag back to the game.
---
So you disagree with Blizzard's damage comparison between the Classic Beta and 1.12 that confirm damage being lower than private servers?
---
Sorry, what part are you referring to? I played many, many of them a long time ago. Not atm no.
---
Usually if you've got a good party you can just ask for what you need, I picked up a 2handed sword and gave it to the warrior that asked for it because we were working together, he killed things alot faster after that and got me alot more exp at the same time.
---
Well the blue says 'all loot tables are patch bound' and '1.3 and 1.4 are phase 2'.
---
So it will be empty until p2 most likely.
---
Yeah if they can justify still having 12 servers for retail surely they will do at least 2-3 for classic. its not just aussies, its all of SEA region too.
---
Cry me a river
---
Except the guy who only speaks french who joins your group, and the other guy who only speaks english who join after seeing your post in the english chat. Then they're unable to communicate with each other. You can come up with ways to make up for that but chances are neither one of them are going to be happy or having a good time.
---
Oh that's not layering man. Its pvp so go out there and get better and those chests can be yours too :D. Layering doesn't even work to get extra chests.
---
It was so hilariously petty when it was still unconfirmed. People were so sure they would never be available as it wouldn't be a "fresh start". I got downvoted into oblivion back then for saying that it would be fun to be able to really identify the launch vanilla players by CE pets.
---
It's the users contrast. It's supposed to be a slightly dark orange but not an eye strain
---
I think it has to do with the fact that you eventually loose all your progress on a pserver so it is hard to really invest in a character. This will not be the case with Classic as it is here to stay
---
I'm European and speak 3-5 languages, I don't at all a Spanish person who can't speak English. It's not an applicable skill for everyone.
---
Because the people in the 25-34 age are the kind of people that started the content way back when, in the time Asmon also started (tbc/wotlk and before) and they heavily relate to what he is saying, as they have experienced exactly what he has. The people who are younger never experienced the old style of wow, so they cannot compare. One of the reasons i love classic, so the new guys can get a feel for the game WE fell in love with, not the stuff that it turned in to nowadays.
---
Artificial lag.
---
So lie and abuse the system? Nice
---
The dub culture in Germany basically started after WW2 because most germans couldn't speak english. It made sense back then. But today is a different time. We're living in an interconnected world and being a young person in 2019 and not being able to speak english is well... weird. Of course the dub culture still exists because the market is big enough. What I'm simply saying is that the dub culture today is kind of redundant and simply exists so that people don't have to learn a language they should be able to speak. It's convenient but does more harm than good in the long run.
---
Cool man, I appreciate it :)
---
Never raided before so I don't fancy the added pressure of healing or tanking. That removes druid, shaman, paladin and priest.
---
I don't like the idea of leveling a warrior dps without a main to funnel him gear/enchants/pots which rules that one out, which leaves mage, warlock, hunter and rogue.
---
Ruling out a rogue because I don't find the play style very interesting. They feel too cooldown dependent and not very useful in group fights and lack utility.
---
Been stuck between Hunter, Mage and Warlock for the past few days. Hunters are likely the easiest to gear but finding a raid spot might be tricky. I like the idea of leveling a mage/warlock, having enchanting and using that to make my alts boe gear pretty powerful. So it's likely between them.
---
Correct. I was just pointing out that it’s not about costs. They’re not saving money by making all the EU servers multilingual.
---
I’m pretty sure they don’t think the EU (or the US) can support more than 5 realms each. 2 PVP, 2 PVE, and 1 RP. Though the US might get an extra RP realm because of the distance between Pacific and Eastern.
---
As an American I think its everyone's duty to speak English
---
Ofcourse! Drama adds to tension! That's one of the rules of entertainment. He is an entertainer for a living.
---
From my own experience people from international guilds are less interested in the actual members of the guild, see it more as a tool. What really drives national guilds is usually the vision that at some point they will meet over a beer. People from other countries just don't have this perspective of long-term friendships, which makes them less invested into the guild.
---
Yes, another instance of anti-streamer circlejerk on this subreddit. You would have a similar result with a big community event without streamers. Everyone that happens to be on the wrong layer wants to get invited to the right one.
---
Thats a great point. If you don't speak English in 2019 its high time to learn. In my own experience i had real fun when i was in a multilingual guild. I was around 12 and it was quite stressfull at times but i think i learned a lot.
---
You guys wanted to be one big country, speak the same language.
---
I'd get a Ryzen apu, should be plenty good enough for classic and probably the cheapest option .
---
You’re from Scandinavia, yeah?
---
Yes, many do but not all. 
---
In addition to that. IMO it's just a different experience. The odds of having a casual conversation in a dungeon/leveling group is much less likely to happen if you are not confident in your ability to write english.
---
Of course it's enough for "focus X" "sheep moon" etc but not much more than that.
---
You are really calling one of the biggest nerds in wow history a beta male? That is actually funny :D
---
As someone who raided mythic in legion and bfa i disagree. It doesnt feel rewarding at all. It feels disappointing every time it doesnt titanforge and when it does titanforge and its not your BiS item is equally disappointing because you had luck at the wrong time and got a titanforged piece with the wrong stats for your spec, its still an upgrade but not what you wanted
---
I do not believe Seal of Righteousness being delayed in a bug.
---
In the following video you can see a Paladin using Reckoning with Seal of Righteousness. As he unloads the bomb, you see the healthbar of the mage drop. Then after a short delay you see the healthbar drop again which suggests SoR being delayed.

Jo men faktum er at jeg svarer deg heller på norsk enn på engelsk, og dette er veldig irriterende for resten av folka som bare må sitte å se på denna driten. Jeg sier ikke at vi må ha en norsk server, men snakker du feks tysk? jeg gjør det, men når det da kommer spansk, fransk og russisk i general chat blir det ikke noe moro.
---
Det burde være regionale servere, og man burde kunne velge, akkurat som man kunne i gamle wow
---
Warrior is best partner followed by mage for portals/water/aoe potential depending on the situation.
---
For small group PvP a warrior is just bonkers with freedom, dispells and single target heals. Group PvP a mage with BoP and stunned/sheeped dispellers is also fun. 
---
A 40 paladin riad would be possible but there are some mechanics that will make some bosses impossible or hard to manage. The inability to remove curses could be circumvented with strategic bubble usage and consumables. Kiting will be impossible for paladins thought and with all DPS in melee range you will have trouble with some mechanics.
---
The video explaining the impact streamers can have on a server is scary. I hope servers are big enough for them to not matter.
---
Nothing stops you from doing that. This isn't relevant to the issue at all. Germans and french players who do not want to do that are forced, while you freely choose to play like that.
---
You’re right except for the fact that claiming to be able to choose the specific layer is exactly what he said he was able to do, and literally the only thing I have taken issue with this entire time....
---
Now I’m just waiting to see someone post their divorce certificate in anticipation for wow classic and I’ll officially have seen it all
---
Part of me Hope's they'll allow most CE pets from the early expansions but I'm assuming we'd have to wait for the relevant servers if we ever got them.
---
Would be awesome to take little Lurky on dungeon runs again.
---
It depends on how long phase 2 will even be out for. 3 months or less and you're most likely not getting rank 14, unless you're the first one on your server.
---
Please dont join eu servers ty
---
jo men du skjønner jo ikke tysk, spansk eller fransk, det er problemet.
---
See? you dont know my language, neither do you know german, french or spanish (?). And these languages will be spoken in general chat, and it WILL bother you.
---
Yeah, something tells me that MC is going to have Phase 2 loot on day 1. There’s really no balance reason for it not to.
---
No eyebrows, like all true Orcs.
---
Doomhammer's plate armor also helps.
---
Soda grew up? I've watched him for years and he is still the same kind of character. Why? Because it is what his viewers like watching. Same with Asmongold, Esfand, Preach, Josh and more of the "celeb/wellknown" streamers. They play a role and people watch them for it. For a good comparison, look at Tyler1 from the League of Legends community. Hes a full on character, we know this, but that's why we watch him.
---
OK i have a english Client and i want to speak my own language. We had German servers Back then, and IT will be a completely different xp. There are many people that Don t speak English. And i Don t want to Deal with french people. It will be toxic, like other multilanguage Games. I hate it. The Hype in our Comeback Crew is gone
---
Yes because your English is perfect...
---
When did I say anything about layers being static? I understand you’re embarrassingly confused, but let’s not put words in my mouth. I full understand that a layer reaches capacity and another layer is formed. I’m not sure where you got that I said they were static

---
Quoting u/Jayskii1
---
&gt; To be fair there was a huge gurubashi arena battle royale type thing going on that looked really fun, layering was more the problem here
---
Except you dont need to speak profficient english to communicate well enough in 95% of the content. And the other 5% are guild activities such as raiding and you can still be in a guild that speaks your prefered language.
---
Op if u decide on a 1060 get a rx580 instead it's a lot cheaper and the same perf
---
the problem with your logic is that you assume people will just speak english on a European server and you "just have to learn English to participate". That's not how it's going to work. You will be seeing French, German, Spanish, English, Italian, Polish, etc. in global chat. Your chat will be spammed with languages you don't understand. Most of it will be English, sure, but not all of it. And that is going to be annoying.
---
So even if you know English, it's not going to be without a problem.
---
No, but close. Finland.
---
I agree. I always go for English even when I have the option to choose Swedish. I dont tell people where im from and I dont want to know where others are from, only assumptions are being made from that. I would rather be without them.
---
I wouldnt even want a Scandinavian server for us, just make it a server based in sweden or something but make it english.
---
Good shout.
---
i remember when we signed up for the closed beta in our computer class in school and played all together gnomes and dwarfs :D first and last time alliance
---
We are not only talking about germans (who know english well, i know), but all Eu. I just pointed out german 1. since im german xD 2. we are the biggest community for wow in EU. 1. german 2. french 3. italian if i remember correctly.
---
I thin 5k is pretty heavy but not necessarily game breaking. Of course rare materials will go up in value but not to the point of crashing an economy. Once we start getting past 5k though the dynamic of vanilla starts to shift
---
Aftes years on private servers the only problematic ones were chinese and russian , with all the other nations communication was never a problem
---
Hello, thanks for reminding us that streamers are bad.
---
Can the next post be "play whatever class/specc you want"? Did not have them in the last 10 hours
---
Would you be thirsty if you are in a city and suddenly one of your all-time favorite actors was in the next street over? Wouldn't you at least get out of your way to get a peek at him/her? Even possibly a picture? Ofcourse you would! This is exactly the same. The fact that you don't watch streams, does not mean others cannot be entertained by the streams, as well as the streamers.
---
Blizzard hates server mergers. It fucks with the community hard and forces a ton of people to change their name.
---
Now there *is* an unpopular opinion (pssst, you're right, and people will find out after launch).
---
Frustrated redditor spotted who talks nonsense
---
What monitor is that? (main one)
---
I know everyone wants to hate on streamers and their fans, but just imagine for a moment a big community event without streamer involvement. Everyone that happens to be on the wrong layer is jsut trying to get invited to the right one. You would have a similar result.
---
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
---
IT'S JUST LIKE VANILLA!
---
THANKS STEAMERS!!!!
---
Based mods locking the big thread so blizzard doesnt see it.
---
Blizzard don't release the numbers on the players, but according to some websites at most German players comprise at most 20% of EU servers populations. There will be very few servers come launch and if people selected randomly, yes, you would be the minority on that server for sure.
---
So? Reply to him then. He asked about germans and i gave him an answer.
---
Man, trust me, there's plenty of sane russians that are ashamed of our cykablyat comrades and do not behave like them at any conditions, it just we're either blending in completely, or being the tards everyone hates, none in between.
---
All russians who wanna join eu are from the first group.
---
This so much, except with Finnish for me. Hey neighbor!
---
Well played, Blizzard. Well played...
---
Filters exist.
---
Which is exactly why streamers are the next "celebs". Having possible interaction with your "heroes" or what you want to call them is a great driving force for fans. I remember back when i went to quite some concerts, if i got some backstage passes or had a chance for a meet and greet, i squeeled like a little girl. That's not weird, not hard to understand. Same thing with streamers.
---
Why would the German server be dead? German is the most spoken native language in the EU. In retail, German servers make up roughly 40% of all EU servers (that's en+ru+fr+it+es+pt+de).
---
No, they did actually say that the layers would be sized like the original vanilla servers (2500-3500)
---
poggers
---
I literally say that in my post. European "niche" languages will be the issue, but the post i responded to was about people not speaking english good enough.
---
Absolutely right, it excludes many people and Kills rping, sarkasm, humour. Germans will be called Nazi, french Baguette and so in, Like in other Games. It kills all Classic was about. Several people won t play it Like this.
---
The quests, dialogues, NPC are still translated in French if he needs it.
---
Activision is going to strangle this game by trying to nickle and dime everything so much, I can't even imagine how annoying it must be to work there always having them reduce your budget more and more.
---
Huh. I'm absolutely certain that every mob had a fixed timer during Vanilla and TBC though (after that I can't tell). I even could confirm that for Classic when playing on the stress test and timing mob respawn.  
---
Private servers also used fixed respawn as it was believed to be blizz-like, I know that's not an argument but here's the thing : some private servers with high population tried to implement dynamic respawn to be more convienient, and it was immidiately visible that it was different from what original Vanilla videos showed, and it was also exploited by mage farming in groups in way that couldn't be done during Vanilla.  
---
Anyway, it's hard to tell really, but even if it was there or not, I hope it won't be in Classic. Fighting over ressources or grouping up with people to share mob tags is, to me, crucial for Classic.
---
first of all, this is reddit and i couldnt give two shits. second, english is not my first language, i speak 3 languages and im learning russian atm
---
Chinks ruin the game, just go play on l-hope and try to play with them, they are retarded.
---
Maybe this was their plan all along!
---
Another person that thinks all servers will be english? If so then work on your reading skills. There will be no such thing as german servers but there also wont be english servers. They just arent split by language, it doesnt mean they are english. They are international.
---
As a Swedish I love Bokmål.  
---
You always sounds happy.
---
I agree
---
When you go to a old timey replication town would you expect to have medical aid if you got stabbed?
---
The decision to make separate Russian servers is due to completely different alphabet and discrepancies in the game client due to grammar.
---
My bad sorry for being a retard ill educate myself next time
---
I think Germany will be able to almost get a pure German Server :P
---
If not that - then atleast a German Layer on a EU Server xD
---
Maybe that is what the Layers are for? So multiple Language's can Play in their own Language on one Server? :D /s
---
AUTHENTHIC VANILLA EXPERIENCE GUYS!!!
---
Dynamic respawns are a slippery slope. They work based on metrics. Imagine a zone or subzone has such a large population that mobs are respawning almost immediately. I remember caves that were a nightmare without this issue. Imagine you are trying to progress to the end to kill the named mob, but the mob you kill immediately respawns ... Dynamic respawns can't solve this issue alone.
---
Yeah, remove one thing but leave the other 500 things that can be abused in the exact same way.
---
Yeah about that... Did you know that most Germans in my age range (25-30) only learned the most basic form of English and stopped using it due to not needing it?
---
Hell, most of my (gamer) friends are incapable of understanding English
---
Do you know why this worked so well? Because Game developers usually included German voices or at the very least german text.
---
How do I know that they really are bad at English? Their written English barely makes sense and don't get me started on their pronunciation for more complex sentences.
---
This has nothing to do with catering to a group, it's merely a good business perspective to offer multiple languages to the people.
---
your game plan as a druid never teally changes. You are kiting around and whittle your opponent down even when you are outgearing them.
---
Other classes like mage, warrior or rogue can somewhat delete enemies with bad gear. 
---
Another problem is that the druid is at his strongest in 1vs1 fights.  In BGs you fall of a bit simply by it being group fights.  
---
Your damage is not on the burst-y which makes it easier to heal. Kiting also gets harder since you are kess likely to catch a break against multiple enemies.
---
Luckily the druid has other qualities as well. He is by far the best flag carry in warsong, can be a good defense in arathi (cant be sapped or sheeped and can rank 1 moonfore to prevent capping from far away) and is great at helping rogues sneak-capture a tower in alterac.
---
Overall they can be really strong in world pvp, just dont expect to two shot anything. druid plays more like a weird mix of kiting around like a hunter, doting like a WL and healing themselves up in between. 
---
they are no WA-BAAMM class in terms of damage and no "i wont move an inch" in terms of survival. Druids are mobile above all else. You can kite like crazy, but often times you *have to*  do it.  That is my take on it.
---
How do you expect me to find it ? It was one of the blueposts going out after the first stress tests. 
---
Like if you care find it out yourself people are super lazy here. They rather complain before they inform themselves.. not even talking about you here. But you saw the million posts about who and how to get beta and all and people miss it all the time.
---
That I understand, I don't understand why no separate servers are gonna be made for EU languages :c
---
I don't even know what the problem is, barely any game seperates the community by native language and its no problem.  
---
Everyone in europe who went to school knows english.   
---
Except for the Brits, they speak some english-like gibberish.
---
I'll sacrifice hype in order to get something done about layering any day of the week.
---
The game will speak for itself, if it comes out in a state that resembles what it used to be.
---
How does this matter? We don't care if the servers are in Paris, London or Frankfurt. In classic all EU servers were in Paris and it wasn't an issue at all for anyone in Europe.
---
&gt; Layering lasting longer than Phase 1? Not a chance.
---
You are incredibly naive if you think there is no chance layering sticks around
---
No i will speak my language everywhere , ignoring everyone in others. My Vanilla was in my language.
---
If I wanted to flex I’d mention my 4.0 from Berkeley, but I’ll take your whole year of experience doing grunt work at Goldman as the expert opinion. And if you just graduated, you weren’t even old enough to fucking play Vanilla, so what are you even pretending to do on this sub?

---
Host in Moscow and problem solved. Germans get about 50ms to Moscow which is fine.
---
What about the other languages ? I'm not saying there need to be official servers, but there will definitely be unofficial ones. Just like how every Hungarian played on Eu-Ragnaros
---
The greatness, if any, of French and German schools is certainly not related to languages.
---
deathwing would like a word
---
I will agree the +5 to swords is good, in fact I will likely be going human just to be the Thunderfury carrier for my guild. However I do not believe it is necessary, I was in best guild on Silvermoon-EU(One of the better PvE servers), 9th to kill C'thun, and I never saw this obsession with min maxxing which seems to be more a product of private server meta. Even ex Death and Taxes members have said they did not min max half as much as people obsess over on private servers when asked about world buffs. I barely remember anyone even talking about Elitist Jerks until TBC came about.
---
What? Do you have a source for that?
---
Why do you think I don't wanna roll on russian servers? :D
---
No, people created multiple raid groups on the same layer.
---
&gt; I also don't think they fundamentally understand what makes classic WoW such a genuinely unique experience, and furthermore I don't think you understand that either.
---
Of course not. You alone RANDOMWALLK understand what makes Classic WoW a holistic, natural, amazing, fenomenal, fundamental experience, you alone have the courage and the passion and the necessary brainpower to understand how this masterpiece of a Picasso painting unfolds on the canvas. You alone are capable of guiding us in the darkness. Please Prophet, share your wisdom.
---
The door is right there ----&gt;
---
It's intended to be you can't shoot inside melee range so yeah, 8yards.
---
Clearly the games deadzones were designed to work together, charge etc and all that so I don't want them adding some shitty thing in retail no one likes!
---
He's right though, you're an idiot for not immediately specifying which class you're going to play.
---
"grunt work" yes :D. By how you struggle to comprehend that it's feasible that they change an already changed technology it's pretty clear you're just a code monkey who has no input or thought process into any "software engineering" he does.
---
Just a hunch.
---
The main reason is if they have pre 1.4 loot, then it should drop T2, and that is dumb.
---
Well as a non native speaker of English you may not be aware that the word 'chink' is not acceptable in the way you used it. So please stop using it.
---
Back in the days there were no Russian servers. Russian players tend to play on a couple of servers which technically were English but the percentage of Russian players was massive on them. The problem is massively exaggerated.
---
looking at this video clears a lot of stuff up... i wondered why I have a full bag stack but literally 0 item drops from the mobs... -.-
---
I'll try to level up until ragefire instance, if this also doesn't meet my expectations I guess I will quit this whole "testing" as it is not really useful for classic at all...
---
That’s just the evil circle. You don’t have to learn English because everything is dubbed because no one knows English because no one learns English because everything is dubbed etc etc
---
Yeah can’t blame you for that lol
---
Private servers aren't regional
---
I like your right graph, but that's not how it's gonna be at all. You're forgetting about a lot of different countries in Europe, for example also the scandinavian players. You're gonna have a ton of swedish speaking people on english servers, so english servers are always bound to having "enclaves".
---
Nope. With the 2020 laws, copyright owners can force any ISP to completely block consumer access to any address found in violation.
---
I honestly never met one of the "first group"
---
Vanilla didn't have this, just to be clear. So this is a change, that's the whole point of most of the comments.
---
The reason is obvious. Its money. Many movies are really good but People in NA im assuming haven't seen them becouse they didnt bother watching a french movie. Its easy to recycle and grab the cash. And seriously if you expect People to learn French instead of English its just silly.
---
It is though. EU has had countless dead realms after cataclysm launched. Bfa is the least played expansion.
---
It was a feature in classic to combat latency
---
Why can’t they duplicate world bosses? The entire assumption that they can’t is based on one statement from Ion who, let’s face it is not the most reliable when it comes to keeping his word.
---
calm your t\*ts there is already a movement of players/guilds to clear things up before this happens

Whatever 1.13 will have, will be much better than TBC.

Exactly. There are some countries not in EU with their own language. They want to play too.

Try duo leveling with guildmate. I bet you can find someone that will join you. Lot more fun leveling together.

English will be dominant. Everyone knows this, we English don't speak a dozen EU languages and most Europeans online speak English. 
---
Take League of Legends for example, EU west includes Britain, France, Germany and more, yet everyone speaks English. 
---
It's a pain. I'd rather national servers but, English speaking is so widely normal in Europe I don't see this being the issue it's made out to be.
---
Maybe if they had a proper open beta period they might get a better idea of the amount of people from each area. They cannot surely be relying on data from current subs to determine estimates, even if returning subs for beta access gives *some* indication, it's not accurate, plenty of us won't gamble on that, and sure as fuck are not playing BFA.
---
It's just a fucking name tag at the end of the day, how few servers are they launching that you can't have 2 dedicated (by rule) English, 1 Fr, De, Nordic, whatever the main languages/geographic areas of player density are and then have the rest be international and no rule enforcing?
---
Surely if the whole "layering" bs works properly by launch it won't matter if they get double or triple the expected of any given language anyway, then see where it settles off.
---
Give it a go. I believe you will be amazed on how you'll quickly improve your English.
---
Although this is not like living abroad, it's still an environment where you are immersed and need to communicate with others. It will have positive impact.
---
I am not trying to justify Blizzard's decision but it's always good to see the positive aspects.
---
That's what I mean by "blending in completely", you won't even know we're there ;)
---
I might be a minority and I hope I don't seem rude, but if all other games can cope with having only international servers, then I don't see why WoW can't do the same (I mean, OW has almost obligatory voice chat and it works fine in EU). Personally, even if they make an italian server (I know they won't), I'd rather play on an english one anyway, but that's just me I guess.
---
I don't mind anyone playing on the EU servers as long as character names are forced by the game to not use characters outside of the English alphabet. That also includes things like öüóőúéáűß whatever and ofcourse cyrillic. 
---
When I still played retail I was really annoyed by people that have names that you can't read or write down.
---
I'd rather inconvenience myself/others to have a "guaranteed" healthy population on the servers for longer after launch. 
---
Obviously if the demand and playerbase is still there after a while Blizzard can quite easily (i'd imagine) set up language realms for the french and german players, and offer free transfers to those who want to play there. [like they did back in the day for russians atleast]
---
No point in splitting the playerbase to 3 additional subregions when, let's admit, the future of the game is still a huge questionmark when it comes to long term population.
---
Russians just prettymuch had to be separated thanks to the cyrillic alphabet.
---
Let's try this again:
---
Batching is messing with more than just abilities.
---
Savvy?
---
Sure, but they’ll never get Blizzard support.
---
wow it’s almost like the idea isn’t as good as it seems on paper, if only someone would’ve mentioned it earlier &lt;.&lt;
---
I agree with you. Personally I watch every movie and series in English, just because I like it better and it keeps me involved in the language. But as with WoW retail, it is always very hard to get rid of a perk. Also, don't forget that an industry has formed around this ... there are a lot of factors to consider and it is easier said than done.
---
Maybe if reddit users didn't keep upvoting the same regurgitated memes, we'd get some original content. Maybe even thought-provoking discussion!
---
Reddit is basically twitch-lite.
---
As an English guy who learnt Danish, I 100% agree.
---
I used to play on EU:NorthEast in LoL, and the server had some serious queue problems compared to EU:West.
---
I feel Classic wow would be the same for the Scandinavian countries, where it probably wouldn't be sustainable. Yet with larger countries/communities such as France/Germany, it is potentially sustainable with a single language.
---
As a point here, I do feel the need to point out that my new language, friends and travels came because there were people from other countries on my OG server. (Haomarush-EU, which between Vanilla and Wrath was seemingly a home for Nordic players). Whilst I overall don't agree with this idea from blizzard, there are some positives.
---
Tried that, still not working :(
---
French, Spanish and German community are already planing on unofficial servers for themselves. 
---
So if you pick the wrong server you are basically an outsider.
---
My own experieince with pserver levelling was that I had very little investment in the character due to it's unknown status. In classic I know it's gonna be a bit more permenant s I'm willing to put the time in.
---
Doesn't matter what you think, people won't just learn English to play a game, and even if they can speak it fluently, many will choose not to, and there's nothing you can do about it. Sure you can opt not to group up with these people, just pray that the server you'll choose won't be full of them. It won't be fun for you if the Trade chat's all in Hungarian, French, and Polish.
---
I'll be rolling on a US realm if they don't reverse this decision. There's no chance in hell I'm taking the risk of unintentionally rolling on an unofficial German server.
---
Hey, I agree. I would choose a German server if I had to, but I can live with English just fine. I only feel bad for the RP crowd. That just doesn't work.
---
1. Many are
---
2. If blizz doesn't change anything they will (because it makes sense)
---
3. there are more than just the top 5 pservers everybody talks about
---
makes sense, esp. given how more likely the mobs on pserver avoid your attacks -.-
---
it is actually even required to take a fast weapon
---
Streamers realms will have layering for the full of Phase 1, and queues after that. MASSIVE queues.
---
Fine by me.
---
It needs to go at lvl 20, because thats when you get into PvP zones, and even reaching 20 takes quite a while in vanilla.
---
so basically *it benefits me so I don't give a s*it about people for whom it doesn't*
---
gg
---
I never said they were English, I simply said they weren’t German.
---
Oh, I've only slept for like 4 hours, so I've misread your comment. My take on it is that Activision is being cheap and is only giving so much money for the hardware so they can only separate what they absolutely have to. As always - бабло побеждает зло.
---
There is a big difference between league and WoW tho. Trying to explain a boss fight is much more difficult than just saying 'adc' or 'push top' for example.

---
Ysithens was a CM, not a Dev. Ysithens doesn't work for Blizzard anymore. 
---
Him saying it would be for the early zones is based on time factor. As in they plan on using Layer for the first few weeks which would be just the early zones. They also never said anything about "the first two zones" like the individual above stated.
---
PvP is always about skill more than anything else. If you get to become a great druid you will be beating most of your matchups regardless, because most people will only be great at PvP
---
No idea really that's why i said it would be better to try out national servers first and put them together if they're dead. But why reading the full comment when you can get triggered right away huh?
---
On Nost every global chat was english only.
---
I recall playing on Drak'thul EU in Vanilla and TBC. We nicknamed it Czech'thul because most (and I mean ~95%) LFGs and LFMs in chat were followed by "... cz only".
---
On a few occasions I would just /w inv and proceed to not talk/repeat basic czech words if confronted.
---
In the end I did get into an english speaking guild and eventually migrated realms. But the point is, there's going to be small to medium communities that don't speak english regardless if they did make servers for different languages.
---
It's youtube, not a porn site.  
---
Even if, by absurd, 50% of those people lied about their age, you'd still have more people over the age of 18 watching than under 18, which again makes the "young audience" argument invalid.
---
Agree with you and im heroic raider. Most of the time something drop in raid well... I got a better world boss item or some lucky warfront cache that warforge etc.
---
Raid Gear drop feeling is weird now. Good thing I'm not running m+ wich seem to obliviate most of the raid drop gear usefulness.
---
Dynamic respawn breaks the game the moment it is respawning in less than 5 seconds and you have to go through an area with a high mob density like a cave, you will never make it to the end to the named mob you want to kill. Imagine Jintha'alor with insta respawns, no thank you ...
---
And then they backpaddled and said it will be gone when world bosses are going in... First it was only a few weeks after launch. 
---
I dont trust them that its not a permanent feature.
---
Sorry for necroing but, do you have sources? Is great to see there is an even small chance they could do this
---
Still thinking about getting a new monitor and a new ssd harddrive. Not sure yet.
---
What is layering? I've seen it in context with streamers but I don't quite get it.
---
Ru client actually prevents you from using latin alphabet in names, so when you're getting crossrealmed, that's what happens.
---
We're supposed to download eng client to actually be able to login to eu servers, so if it's the same logic here, you won't see cyrillic letters from us.
---
What do you mean foreign server? Everyone speaks english in EU these days anyway
---
If we're really pessimistic and think Classic will only have twice as many players as BFA, the servers will be really crowded.
---
Just the private server players alone would cap 10+ servers easily with the vanilla 3k cap.
---
Are people really this desperate to stand next to the guy?
---
Yeah, seems like the whole layering till phase 1 bullshit won't last with such attitude :c
---
(French here) I can't understand... Do you work in France to have so many french customers to deal with ?
---
I have to work abroad often because of my work and English is the only language I use abroad (beside in french-speaking Belgium).
---
But sadly I can confirm what you said... french people are lazy with english (like spanish &amp; italian actually).
---
Things slowly change here in France. Now children learn English really early.
---
I have a reason to not do that.
---
You will have less people to play with in the evenings because of the time difference.
---
Everyone should be able to speak english anyway... also this would be a good opportunity to learn it.
---
Well, if dire maul is out its your best bet
---
A 3 man group can do DME pretty easily and can net you around 100g per hour (with mining at the end there  is rich thorium veins and DE for shards) to share si 30/35 golf each
---
When your Gear Got better duo is possible 
---
If you are horde with a shaman(Wf help alot if your dps is low early on) and another dps 
---
There is also a bis bow with + hit on it
---
This seems reasonable, I like the cooldown idea.
---
I don’t hear South Americans complaining about no Spanish servers. Stop being snowflakes.
---
It'd the good old question damage VS speed. Speed always wins cause dealing 60 damage every minute or  10, damage every 10 sec but the target  has 80 health. Where damage gets better is if you have % weapon damage on your attacks. Only thing is heavy hitting good. Slam especially accompanies this. Making a heavy hitting weapon (which is usually over 3:50 speed) hit every 1 sec makes it nuts if you can pull it off in pvp.
---
Most will not select randomly though when they stay with this plan.
---
I just read in another thread that on the german forum alone "There were 65 guild registered 2 months in advance. With half of them full at 60 members and some even with waiting lists."
---
Do you know how tiny the percentage is for people to organize in advance and be active on forums and reddit etc ?
---
Out of all the people I know will play classic not a single one is active on forums or reddit and just a single one has an active subscription to retail.
---
Again, just with the thousands of german speakers active on forums right now you could fill a server and that is a tiny minority to the actual amount that will show up at launch.
---
Indeed he is arrogant, I would assume he'd been traveling a lot and should have seen that they are European countries that are much less advanced. And obviously less advanced countries are less dependent on English as language. They don't travel, they can't afford PC or a console so they can't play video games online, they don't watch English movies, they don't do business with foreigners and they've very few engineers and probably not so many workers within information technology.
---
Started on a PvP server but quickly changed to PvP when I realised PvP with 500 ping was a no go so unfortunately I have very little vanilla world PvP experience.
---
To be fair, look at PSO2. It just now got a Western release date. The game has been out since 2012. 7 years ago. In Japan only. No other languages till SEA servers about 5 years ago which quickly got shutdown. SEA servers were also a year behind in updates. 
---
What everyone else did, is create a language patch to play on Japan's official servers. To this day there are a ton of English and Spanish players across one of the servers. 
---
Not saying what blizzard is doing is justified.
---
It would just be better if they kept the server counts at a minimum to prevent merging in the future. Larger pop servers, and have language packs. 
---
Yesterday this server was all the rage for instancing players across different zones. Just have a specific instance or more on the same large server that's for international players that speak different languages.
---
These instances as the zone population goes down at later levels get smaller and smaller to accommodate seeing more players in the world.
---
There isn’t going to be a private server scene after Classic launches, they’re all shutting down. And even if they weren’t the 2020 copyright enforcement agreements will make them impossible.
---
Other MMOs get by just fine. Not to mention people will find/create guilds that want to raid in other languages.
---
Well well what do you see! Multicultralism doesn't even work in WoW who would've thought. Build the wall
---
"Dont stand in the fire and dispel this debuf"  
---
Wow, that was hard.
---
What are you on about? Yes, it is layering. One chest per layer. Yes it is PvP but by getting there first on a launch (like stress test launch) you can get the chest without competition and by hopping layers u can get extra chests as long as those layers arent contested. Do you think that if the chest on layer 1 gets looted, the chest on layer 2 magically disappears? That would be trash wouldnt it? If a massive 100v100 was going on in layer 1, and chest on layer 2 gets looted making the chest on layer 1 disappear. Tl;dr - Jumping layers CAN get you extra chests, you are wrong, and layering is trash. Not sure you even know what layering is judging by both your comments.
---
&gt; I am happy with lag and disconnects
---
Bruh, like bruh ... That's such a selfish way to look at it. You are happy with a horrible service, so others should experience it that way as well? Who hurt you?
---
Well of course i wont gove a fuck if it benefits me. But like i said if they backtrack on it im also fine with that because im not saying that my opinion is better than any other opinion. Did you read the whole thread? The point is that people should discuss it while taking blizzards explanation in to account. You can disagree with the explanation and say that the downsides outweight the benefits while acknowleding that an explanation exists instead of coming up with theories as to why this is the death of classic as if blizzard didnt give an explanation at all.
---
Maybe because they don't speak English lol
---
when there are people happy to play on korean servers and are happy because they can play while we have the french complaining about english ... wow   
---
i am sure an addon could be made for fan translations for almost everything, just takes effort
---
EU servers will be fine unless French and Germans  will sabtage the rest. Its has always been a problem with them not being able to/not wanting to communicate in English.
---
What do you define as fine? If I as a German want a German guild because I prefer to talk to people, and raid with people, in my native tongue. How is this "fine"? Because if Blizzard actually goes for 3k pop servers there will be \~1k or less Germans on my realm, unless I go to the one unofficial German one that will ultimately be created. So my guild-pool just got cut by more than 66%. What a great idea! And it also totally feels "vanilla" if half the messages in chat are in languages I can't understand...
---
What you're talking about is the fact that people can **manage** to play on an international server using English. That doesn't mean people wouldn't prefer to use their native tongue. It's simply a bad idea for the majority of european players.
---
Susanexpress says hello
---
Scandinavian people are like, Regional realms?  
---
With Love from FINNreaver (aka Stormreaver EU).
---
I want higher pop servers, because I think vanilla plays better that way.
---
Always more dungeon groups being formed, more than 2 guilds per server to pick from, more people in every zone from 1-60 which makes the world feel more alive.
---
High pop servers are also prefered by the private server for a reason, because a lot of people prefer the game that way, so the ideal solution would be i blizzard had both server types.
---
on nost there were MUCH more people in 1 server.
---
On blizz server you have a pop cap at let's just assume 4k. 1k german, 1k french, 2k international. It splits the community in smaller sub communities which is not a good thing. Take this further. 
---
Of course it will work, nobody says it won't. But that's no justification for turning away many people.
---
Good point.
---
It's a bit complicated, I work from Hungary as a Hungarian for a Japanese company in charge pf the French destination lol.
---
You think you do but you don't, we must make this prophecy.
---
&gt; those who defend layering, get lost pls.
---
My opinion is the ONLY valid one. If you disagree with me get lost peasants. I am the divine ruler of this land.
---
Oh fuck off with that ...
---
In true classic fashion shouldn't everyone be *degrading* their battle station in anticipation? Hehehe
---
We don’t know what Blizzard is going to cap the realms at. And I think it’s very optimistic to say Classic will have twice as many players as Retail. I’d be surprised if Classic had more than 250k worldwide players by next year.
---
Exactly, sometimes you have a piece of loot with your worst stats from doing some random shit. But it titanforged the maximum possible and maybe even with socket and when you get your BiS item for that slot in the mythic raid oh well its just a baseline version so i dont wven want it because i have an item with shit stats for me that is better regardless
---
That's one language group.
---
Try having a server with 10+ languages where large parts of the population can't interact.
---
There's some more as well, gemology for one. Presumably an early iteration of jewelcrafting
---
It's activision in 2019. We all kinda know they're gonna fuck it up
---
15 years worth of private servers aside - they can't even make a copy of their own fucking game right. Or keep basic - the most basic - of promises.
---

---
There you go!
---
meanwhile I'm here hoping to even get a stress test invite :(
---
Here’s an idea stop being an awkward dweeb and just have fun. Nobody cares if your English isn’t perfect Jesus Christ.
---
That's all well and good but we live in reality. The servers will be packed with people who speak minimal to no English. Maybe that's not how it should be, but its how it is.
---
exactly right
---
I wouldn't say I'm getting less hyped but if layering doesnt gtfo after 2 weeks I'm gonna be pissed. I can definitely see myself going back to private servers if layering sticks around.
---
can you link the thread? I'd be interested in seeing it.
---
I  agree with you, I have to say though the French are notoriously poor English speakers, compared to scandinavian countries for example.
---
They are not officially english, but just international. It is of course expected that most will just be mainly english then if they are really diverse. I don't mind communicating in english even though it's not my native language. The bigger problem occurs when inofficial spanish, french, german are chosen by those communities and you are stuck on the "wrong" one. It won't help a german guy to be willing to communicate in english, when the server suddenly becomes french...
---
Agree. Personally, I think you could also try to reduce the layering need, like slightly boosting respawn timers based on active population in a certain area, so that you have less layers overall. If with this you can move from 6 to 4 layers it's already an improvement imo.
---
&gt; how often will you go out of your way to run dungeons for a quest reward/drop? 
---
If you really want to speedlevel to 60 avoid dungeons as much as possible. The exp/hour is terrible and the extra stats you may gain from drops won't cut it. 
---
&gt; Sfk has the ring from Arugal. It will last for quite some time (especially since rings are rare). Worth? 
---
No.
---
&gt; What would you say your split is, if any, when “speed” running a warrior? 
---
0% Dungeons, 40-50% Questing, 50-60% Grinding mobs (depends on population on launch day)
---
If you are into speedleveling here's a useful guide: 
---
[https://www.joanasworld.com/azeroth.htm](https://www.joanasworld.com/azeroth.htm)
---
Yep, you can't RP in a language you are not confident in
---
Upvoted even tough you are Ally scum
---
SPEAK FRENCH THIS IS A FRENCH SERVER!!!
---
I’m just saying it’s a futile effort to try and fix these singular things when the bigger issue is the system itself.
---
Hype itself kills games before they are released.
---
Go in with hope, not hype, don't follow that shit and you'll probably enjoy the game more.
---
&gt; They ignored scads of Beta feedback about how Azurite sucked, the classes felt depleted, and how unfun it was to exist.
---
Are you the same retard that suggested in another thread that they redesign core game systems in the span on 2 months or is this a contagious infection here? Do you people have absolutely no idea how design cycles work? Have you never worked on any project before?
---
I think most of us Scandinavians agree that Warcraft in our languages would be more awkward than helpful. Imagine every time you wanna look something up online, you have to figure what the English translation is first &gt;.&gt;
---
I've never had any problems with the servers in Paris, but I guess we might be slightly closer in Denmark than you guys are. The current conversation being what it is though, I doubt they're going to have Scandinavian servers for launch or the forseeable future.
---
Why don't people see the difference between many/most and all?
---
Easy to make "spec only" gear though.  
---
Moonkins have problems in any long flight because of mana issues, so gear like this. It is clearly only useful to boomkins. Distribute it via tokens along with gear for other "off off specs".  
---
Fixed Boomkin Belt:  
---
Leather:140 Armor  
---
Requires Level 60.
---
\+26 Intellect  
---
\+30 Stamina  
---
Equip: Increase damage and healing done by spells and effects by up to 38.  
---
Equip: Increase your chance to hit with spells by 1%.  
---
Equip: Reduce the mana cost of Wrath by 15% for each level your target is above you (up to 45%).
---
That's the exception.
---
Lmao this is the kind of guy who will blame everything on specific countries when playing.  
---
"Damn i lost that duel, stupid germans."  
---
"I didnt get that mining node, fuck those polish!"
---
The difference is that Classic is an MMORPG.
---
You can't even compare that to some random shooter or whatever else.
---
With this, the community of the servers will be massively fractured.
---
Oh yes, I got a second monitor and a bulletin board with BiS lists.  Gf is sighing.
---
Im just having trouble following the logic behind this decision..
---
Were they worried that Classic wouldnt have as many players as Vanilla and that making seperate language servers was gonna make ghost town servers?
---
Did they think this is a better solution? If so how?
---
Heck its not that i mind speaking english (from scandinavian country here) but ppl who cant are just gonna speak in their native and create a huge split on the servers so why did they think this would be the better option?
---
Id really like to know.
---
Its always about the Germans and French... I'm sorry but you cant blame anyone else but yourself for not knowing English in 2019. I think its a good decision by Blizzard and we shouldnt segregate People.
---
&gt; High pop servers are also prefered by the private server for a reason, because a lot of people prefer the game that way
---
Is this the case? Most pserver players i know and play with, including myself dislike the overpopulation a lot and want blizzlike populations. However on pservers you always get the high populations because pserver generally are only one fresh server at a time per project, so everyone needs play on the big server or don't play at all, there is not really a choice.
---
I don't get this sort of mindset. It's widely joked by pretty much all WoW players/gamers that we "have no life" because of how dedicated we are, but in the real world why do people feel like they should be ashamed for being passionate about gaming? Fun or enjoyable is very subjective, our minds all work different, we get different kicks out of things. Why is gaming considered so terrible among the others listed? If you really feel those other things you listed are so much better than sinking all your time into WoW, then why the hell are you choosing to play WoW? It's a choice to play, It's just retarded to force yourself to do something if you'd rather be doing other things. 
---
Further, why get tripped up over people you clearly don't share common ground with? It makes just as little sense as the above. If you love gaming, your friends are clearly gamers who love gaming. It sure as shit doesn't make sense for people like you or me to be friends with someone who's a professional athlete when we have completely different ideas of fun and can't relate. Wtf are we ever going to do together that we can actually enjoy each others time? What good does being friends with the athlete do? I rather be friends with Tim the fatfuck neckbeard from bumfuck Egypt who's helping me annihilate wsg by pumping heals into me like he just did the fattest line of coke laced with speed and is there to listen to me cry in the middle of the night when I've had enough of the bullshit in life and about to blow my brains out.
---
Nah the Zeitgeist is now "this clip is why layering is awful" even tho everyone in this sub was singing it's praises 2 months ago saying "it's nothing like sharding, it's an elegant solution to the problem"
---
Yeah you made the argument that Blizzard said they will fix this, and now you’re turning it around on me to find proof that they won’t. That’s not how this works. I’ve been following blue posts pretty closely and I haven’t seen any that say that layering will be fixed. So show it to me or quit the BS.
---
Or you are the only one
---
&lt;im in a guild&gt;
---
Don't you think that it's a big difference between learning colors and some vocabulary in school and talking it fluently in your spare time.
---
In addition to that, the classic crowd seems to be a little bit older so school is longer away than you think.
---
Lok’tar Ogar my friend!
---
Guys I'm not sure which class to level or faction
---
Just found old screenshots in my old hard drive of this bad boy
---
Just recovered my vanilla account and look at this character, wow, what a time to be alive
---
Nah, not really.  
---
A minority will seclude themselves, but most people will just speak english.  
---
Even back when I played retail there was a ton of non-native speakers on english realms.  
---
People here just like to hate on blizzard for every decision they make, it will die down like every other circlejerk.
---
When playing video games was a niche hobby and WoW was new and not everybody knew about it, it already had more than what BFA has now.
---
I would much rather have dynamic respawns. Worked well for the private servers and they had like 10k pop
---
I do not. But it has always been a huge problem within France especially. Always too proud to learn English, you cant even ask for directions in there becouse 80% of people wont help you. 
---
Im sorry but the mindset "Why dont YOU guys learn French instead".... its just too much man. And now everyone has to bow and create their own servers becouse they still didnt learn english in 20 fucking 19.
---
On the German forum they have confirmed that there is a German language client. [source](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/de/wow/t/uebersetzung-lokalisierung/32011/51)
---
A Hunter loosing agains’t a rogue is a very bad huntard Tbh
---
Good to know. Thanks!
---
that's actually a pretty good solution
---
It would make pretty much any other piece of gear in that slot obsolete but that happens to a degree with other classes and their endgame gear anyways.
---
From experience I’d be expecting upwards of 450ms on a US served by which point there’s no point doing any group content.
---
&gt; Don't you think that it's a big difference between learning colors and some vocabulary in school and talking it fluently in your spare time.
---
Either you are in fifth grade or something went horribly wrong in your education.  
---
At least where I come from you learn to speak english fluently in school.
---
Let us choose a layer based on language.
---
You can't argue that the "selling" point of classic is the slow paste and the community by saying only mandatory communication is enough for a good time. 
---
It will make pug groups almost the same than LFG, people not speaking english confident will never engage in any small talk/discussion while doing something
---
That's because in these games it's not thousands of people on the same server on the same team, but 5. There is a lot of people that 5stack in french, german, russian, you name it. It also cant really form enclaves, if you are the only german, youre forced to speak german.
---
Here's a personal annecdote:
---
I play loads of CSGO. I am german, but don't have the stereotypical accent. Often people ask me where I come from, and If i told them german, often times (more than half) they would proceed to spam the voicechat talking german to me, start giving german call outs, casually talk to me in german while everyones trying to play. IT SUCKS. I since called myself Japanese Thomas, changed my profile to say I'm from Japan, and the issue has been solved.
---
Hopefully layering is something that gets severely downscaled as servers inevitably lose population.
---
WoW! And not in a warcrafty way.
---
I was in france a couple of times, everyone seemed to be pretty fluent in english.  
---
Maybe they just don't like you.
---
So you make 1 german server and than what? All the people from Germany, Switz and Austria will want to log onto that particular server. That will be overwhelming. So what do you do? You make second german server. But wait. If you made german server, make spanish servers as well. And make italian, french servers. Hell yea, Czechia and Slovakia want one server too. Im pretty sure Hungary, Poland, Finland, Sweeden will want one. Its a highway to hell. Im not really sure, how exactly you want to address this problem. If you only make servers for the "big countries" like Germany, French, Spain, you will grab almost EVERYONE from those countries, leaving other english realms half-empty, because nobody from these countries will want to play on english speaking realms, if they are given the opportunity to play on their native servers
---
The complaints about layering are fucking dumb as shit. The same people that are crying out for its immediate removal are the same people that would demand Blizzard do something about the overpopulation when they literally can't get a mob tag for 3+ hours for a week straight, guaranteed. 
---
I bet you anything Blizzard would've loved layering tech back in the day, because the launch of Vanilla was a gigantic clusterfuck.
---
Then it should be no problem, since anyone that choses to go on the international servers I would assume speaks English (why else would you go on international servers).

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c38otw/blizzard_retail_lfr_raids_are_languagebased_also/). 
---
&gt; And i Don t want to Deal with french people
---
Listen here you lil' bon monsieur, we don't want to deal with u either, germans. So let's work together this time only to get what we both want
---
Seriously, 90% of why I come here is to find those random nostalgic posts where some posts a fairly detailed detailed story from their Vanilla days. The other 10% is to see read up on random class guides/experiences. But every time I’m here the top posts are “layering bad” and “layering good”, as nauseum. 
---
But yes, still hyped indeed.
---
&gt; I was gonna play on german servers again and i didnt ask my portuguese, italian, english friends with whom i used to play wow if they would play because ot wouldnt matter because of different servers. As it is now we all can play on the same server.
---
That's great, until you and your German/Portuguese/Italian/English friends realise after a couple of months that you all rolled on the unofficial French server.
---
If Blizz don't make official servers, the community will most likely make unofficial ones, which is alot harder to communicate to people unaware of which server is which.
---
Why are you commenting when you're not on the eu. People who aren't even facing the problem need to stfu and stay out of it.
---
[link](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c38blu/no_regional_realms_just_saved_the_private_server/)
---
Nost had way more players, and without layering lmao
---
I replied in another comment that I'm not opposed to the idea of multilanguage servers, like an eastern european server.
---
Also I'm not claiming it completely resolves the issue, but it minimizes it.
---
Perth here usually about 350ms.
---
&gt; If the server language is set to English then people should speak it on public channels and it should be enforced. 
---
It wont be enforced. I can speak english just fine but not everybody can (and not everybody wants to like the French) which will result in 6 different languages being spoken in public chats. Then you might accidentaly group up with someone who only speaks broken english which might make cause issues in a dungeon. It just will be cumbersome and frustrating to deal with.
---
Your guild name is great 😄
---
I'm not from europe?  
---
Why didn't you tell me this earlier, I lived my entire life in the wrong place, jesus fuck
---
&gt; Is this the case? Most pserver players i know and play with, including myself dislike the overpopulation a lot and want blizzlike populations. However on pservers you always get the high populations because pserver generally are only one fresh server at a time per project, so everyone needs play on the big server or don't play at all, there is not really a choice.
---
A lot of servers offer either lower pop servers, or PvE servers which are usually not as popular (Nost had like 3  servers, the main one had like 15-20k, while the other were 2k-ish).
---
And personally I just think vanilla WoW works with a higher population, TBC doesn't, Wrath doesn't. No other version of WoW does work well with it, but because vanilla is so massive with two huge continents and each faction generally has supremacy of one of them. It just means there is much more room to support it.
---
And I prefer to just go out in the world, see people in every zone and just see the world be alive, encounter spontaneous PvP raids and havoc, seeing 5 man groups doing elite quests months after launch etc. I just think higher pop is better for the sustainability of servers in the long run, although it may be a shitshow  the first few months.
---
Higher pop also allows for more choices when you play the game, you can get dungeon groups easier, there are a lot more guilds to chose from (which is really important to me) because being blacklisted by one of two raiding guilds on your servers sucks, and I just like the scale of the game and how it feels like an actual world.
---
Oh so now EVERYONE seems fluent in English?  Why wouldnt they play the International European servers with English as the main language then? Couse there is a shit show happening about it.
---
In pvp shaman is as good as priest
---
Purge/wf is damn awesome, add in some good tremor totem management and you have an awesome support 
---
Not in rest in raid also, one if the best group healer chain heal is no joke to heal the raid
---
Sorry I meant the actual forum where these guilds and their roster size are being shown
---
This is something I think Everquest 2 did so well. They went so ham on the crafting side of the game.
---
I'd love to see classic wow with more small rpg elements.
---
Eeehhh, you’re Scandinavian to me, neighbor!
---
No, Its not a "Try classic for 145 levels"  
---
It was a stress test, and they got their test. Keep earning that money bro.
---
From my admittedly feeble memory, only for casters. If it was present for melee, it had a smaller window than it does now. 
---
All in all I'm not super worried about this, though. I don't really think Blizzard will keep melee leeway like it is.
---
Yup!
---
imo just 10 minutes would be enough for groups to get together that really want to while limiting abuse situations.  Who knows if that sort of fix is even able to be implemented, but it sounds reasonable.
---
Vocal minority, same with old AV, layering and all the other circlejerks.
---
What about timezone? Are you going to raid at 5am?
---
Wait really? Got any source for this? That's so cool if true.
---
You’re not considering player attrition rates with respect to their population caps. If not enough people stick around at 60, the dynamic spawns won’t matter because you’ll have underpopulated dying servers. Layering is basically pre-planned server merging.
---
I tend to see a lot of Finnish people speaking their own language in public chats. Other than that it's mostly English, but it's a pain in the arse on voice chat as most Europeans can't understand my accent.
---
I think last zone with layering should be barenns as you have different options for further leveling , but alltogether layering should be removed after 2-3 weeka altogether except for the starting zone first camp
---
5 realms? You legit think they expect 25.000 players? It's impossible to be that fucking pessimistic.
---
I can speak english just fine but not everybody can (and not everybody wants to like the French) which will result in 6 different languages being spoken in public chats. Then you might accidentaly group up with someone who only speaks broken english which might make cause issues in a dungeon/raid. 
---
It just will be cumbersome and frustrating to deal with when it doesn't has to be that way.
---
I’m on the stress test atm and it’s 450ms
---
Did you relog to do this? Or did you just get group invite from random people
---
I see, out of arguments. You're not very good at this.
---
Pservers have survived and thrived on 1.12 for a decade. 
---
We’ll be ok.
---
Pretty sure Classic will have more people playing it than retail until at least 9.0 comes out, the argument that specific national servers wont have enough people on them is as stupid and wrong as it gets. 
---
At least release the list of realms so communities can start forming from now and english speakers will know wich servers to avoid. Nobody wants to waste a ton of time leveling a character to level 40 just to find out they have to reroll because nobody speaks english on their server. 
---
Really bad decision by Blizzard, hopefully they change their minds on that. 
---
Also, why are the mods locking threads about this topic?? Literally makes no sense. Community discussion and involvement is key to the success of Classic, do they want Classic to fail or what?
---
I played on many private servers and you are wrong. Every german guild I was in had international people who either spoke a little german or were learning at the moment. Every international guild I was in had players from everywhere including germans. Noone gets excluded this way and everyone can play the game how they want to.
---
\- Even a Scandinavian server would be ridiculous.  Not enough players or interest.
---
\- People speaking different languages in public chats will be a mess. It will cause resentment because people can't understand it. 
---
\- People claiming unofficial x language servers is going to be a problem, and cause even more resentment. 
---
\- Classic is about communication. This will ruin the servers.  
---
We need language specific servers or languages enforced in public chat, or having separate public chats for different languages.  I don't like the latter, and it would be better with separate servers for different languages.
---
It's the same mentality.
---
A. Cater to the biggest group B. fuck them all.
---
It's a fact that german and french are the biggest ones. There is 0 difference between having 8 international realms and 4 regionals and 4 international. 
---
Players can CHOOSE where they want to play and are not forced to do so. 
---
Imagine leveling on a server to lvl 45 and then you get the message from a friend a different server is the unoffical server of your language with many guild in your native language. 
---
Only considering this fact, the chance is higher if they are split to regional ones.
---
Actually thanks to our warlock friends the can share their with us :)
---
&gt; 1) save money
---
They don't really do that. The hardware requirements for layers are the same as for servers. With a server having 4 layers it is similar in hardware as 4 different servers with 1 layer. Layering doesn't magically reduce computing time. All it does is make subservers withing a branch, so that later on they don't have to deal with dead servers and merging.
---
Not having a map readily available in game changes everything. Yeah, you can just look online, for sure. But not having that little arrow tell you where you are really makes you look at the world and soak it in.
---
It makes the world feel so much bigger and it's so nice when you memorize certain areas of the game.
---
If you care about racials and min/maxing, whorde is the only way to go.
---
Well done, thanks for testing this. As a prospective paladin main come classic this seems pretty whack.
---
French and German servers already exist and have large pops. The others not so much so why would they want their own for classic.
---
Huh? Dynamic respawns means 10k can level on a server 0-15 fine. Than when there's 3k left in 3 months the server will be at a fine vanilla-like pop. How does that not fix the problem?
---
Apologies, it seemed implied that you weren't in your post but I must have read it wrong :( Just getting over some of the contrarians who seem to just want to be combative towards legit concerns.  Not saying you are though!
---
Yeah I hate that new vanish animation
---
Lmao what arguments did you provide?  
---
"A bunch of people are crying about it" literally is no argument, every decision blizzard makes on classic causes a bunch of nerds to get angry.
---
This was on the open beta.
---
If you think, blizzard will be looking down on those "few" who dont know english for any particular reason, keep dreaming
---
Idk why players who love grind easily wanna ruin classic. If you wanna grind as you want, there is a game: WoW: Battle for Azeroth. They wanna decide the destiny of both games. Bah
---
I'll tell you what.
---
Venruki kinda sucks at classic wow.
---
He has a few good moments, but he sucks.
---
Imagine thinking retail skill translates directly to classic skill.
---
Yep, that's what I thought.
---
Genius
---
Do you know what the word accurate means?
---
 The ratios are color coded as follows.  If the number you see is red, then there have been less than 50     data snapshots submitted for this server/faction in the last 30 days.  This is **BAD** and we need more info on those     realm/factions!  If the number you see is in yellow, then there have been more than 50, but less than     100.  This is better, but we really could use more data.  If the number is green then there have been     more than 100 snapshots submitted in the last 30 days.  This is fairly acceptible to give reliable data! 
---
Source: [http://www.warcraftrealms.com/realmstats.php](http://www.warcraftrealms.com/realmstats.php)
---
It's not fucking accurate because almost all of those numbers are red. It said Tichondrius had 0 Alliance characters login in the last 30 days. I spent two minutes looking at wowprogress and there's hundreds of Alliance that have logged on in the last 30 days.
---
It probably did have a slightly smaller window but a window nonetheless, hopefully they are still dialing in numbers, I'm a little worried because there's only 2 months left
---
I still can not understand how you people derive enjoyment from getting loot instead of actually completing the content and overcoming challenges ...
---
There were tons of non-natives that were speaking English yes, but there were designated national servers where trade chat, general chat, lfg, guilds all spoke their native language. I only played up to Cata and later everything was merged together, but in TBC and Wrath, there were servers that the smaller languages picked for themselves because they didn't have their official servers.
---
I avoided the server where people spoke my native language, but I have friends who played on either our designated PvE or PvP server. The PvE one was a bit more international, but on our PvP realm, there was no-one speaking English in trade/general/whatever chats.
---
"have you come to snipe the streamers"
---
LOK'TAR AGAR!
---
&gt;I was gonna play on german servers again and i didnt ask my portuguese, italian, english friends with whom i used to play wow if they would play because ot wouldnt matter because of different servers. As it is now we all can play on the same server.
---
Just play on an English server 4head?
---
The existence or nonexistence of language realms shouldn't prevent you - and all your English speaking friends - of playing on an English server. No one is forcing you to play on **your** language realm.
---
I'm also portuguese, and I have always preferred English speaking realms even after official portuguese realms were launched. You can choose.
---
Wanted to come back for classic wow (stopped playing @mists) - won't do so now. As silly as this sounds: not everyone can speak english. This will lead to sub-cultures on a server, who will spam the chat with their respective languages, while others will try to speak english. There will be those people who won't even try, and those who will try but fail, both will suck hard.
---
I have played lots of mmos over the years, what I realized:
---
There are always some French ans Spanish people who insists on using their respective language (French much more often than spanish) - same may be true for germans, but I might be biased here since I'm german myself and didn't realize when s.o. can't speak english. I can just imagine the tradechat
---

---
Kaufe Wollstoff
---

---
donde puedo encontrar la busqueda?
---
A trade / lfg chat where 1/4th of the replies is readable by me sounds like lots of fun! If they don't install a language filter, so I can filter out spanish and french and english guys, I don't see this happening.
---
On the other hand: My girlfriend, wich I would play with, just doesn't speak english as well. So english will be a no-go for her.
---
Wat, I made a post asking about this a couple days ago and people said it was in the game, damn.
---
Certainly could do. I could easily wake up early and raid before work.
---
i won't be playing classic if australia doesn't have its own server. simple as that.
---
Looking good!
---
Where did you get the Alliance flag?
---
I got super lucky and had 2 days off. My rogue has 24 hours played, killed VC, pretty much BiS level 15 stuff, 150 eng... I couldn’t have confirmed my suspicions about classic any more.
---
Actually you don't. Any kids from my country would have no problem to participate in a conversation... You get pretty far with basic English you learn in the elementary school. Anyway if you are struggling to communicate with foreigners, why not join a guild where they speak your native language?...
---
I see dum dum. You are the one getting angry here im assuming since i said im glad for this decision and you started the convo.
---
It's not that, I enjoy the ability to talk to other players and how it is forced in classic.  That is one of my favorite aspects of the game.  But I am not sure if you played the open beta the past couple of days, but due to the overpopulation of players, it was taking around an hour when in a group of 5 to kill the first boars.  Scorpion stingers, even longer.  The line would be nice if everybody did it, but i waited in a group for 45 mins to get a chance to kill him before it went back into a free for all and ended up not getting it done because of the overpopulation.
---
literally who cares
---
There wont be enough servers for every language like back in the day.
---
I just think they don't want to invest too much time and money into it. Without a cash shop, they're not going to be raking it in with Classic. Therefore, I believe the project only got the green light if they did it on as limited a budget as possible.
---
White hair power :D
---
What is the population of regional servers?
---
Question for those who have the pets -- are you using your original account or are you able to access it from another account?
---
My main vanilla collectors account is inaccessible though tied to my bnet account, and Blizzard did say if a collectors edition key was bound to the bnet account, you would get the pet...yet I do not have it. Kinda worried!
---
Of course, the problem is that you get dazed pretty much every pull because it's so difficult (pretty much impossible) to avoid melee attacks thanks to the leeway mechanic. 
---
You usually need to burn Blink since you're in a hurry to get away after the nova to start your Blizzard as soon as possible because of the super delayed application of the slow which means you typically don't have Blink up when you're going in for the second Frost Nova before you finish them off, you'll most likely be dazed here again because of their insanely long range - that's where you might run into trouble.
---
It's hard to describe it, you'll see what I mean when you get to play the game. It does NOT feel good.
---
those rank 1 titles don't mean anything in classic, mate.
---
It would lead to some problems in Spain. Knowing blizzard they would put all spanish speaking servers in Latin America, so a shitty latency for Spaniards.
---
God, if only Esperanto had worked...
---
If you're pvping as a healer then DP and SG aren't really that big of a deal. They scale with spell damage so it's not like they'll get better with your gear. I'd go Dwarf if that's the case since that'll be crucial for raids, so easier spots.
---
If you're going Shadow for PvP, personally I think SG is the better option because it scales much better, while priests in general do not. It may help even it out in real end game where everyone's geared
---
What? You think they disabled layering for the stress test or something? This IS WoW with layering. Obviously layering has its flaws which is demonstrated by the numerous videos out there, but it also shows the fact large scale WPvP can still take place.
---
LFG trees and gronnlings
---
I understand that maybe some people are willing to put in an hour + for each of the starting quests, not to clear the zone in 2 hours but maybe 6 and thats fine.  The social interaction is there which is great.  But standing in line for mobs is not something i view as a fun social experience.
---
European here, I am coming for that bitch ass titan.
---
Because it’s not 10k to 3k. Servers usually have 6x their peak, so with 3k peak you may have 18k subscribers regularly playing
---
The difference is that, on launch, you have **everyone**, so you’d have those 18k all logged in and questing. Not only that, but consider the possible attrition rates and the number of tourists on top of that who would be playing. So if you think that a third will stick with it, that’s roughly 54k total players on the same server during the launch window. That’s insane.
---
I found a petition about it this morning http://chng.it/L5kTny9LNb

My TV has 12,9/13,3 ms at 1080/1440p 120 hz. There are TVs with lower than that but I wanted one that was good for other stuff too.

"dum dum", you sound like Trump, did you have a concussion recently?
---
Hello fellow mages,
---
I have a few questions about unorthodox leveling spec, i want to start with Fire talents up to pyroblast, then redirecting to Arcane for wands/mp5 talent/eventually PoM. Something like this: [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/2402050310031-50500001](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/2402050310031-50500001) . Im not asking for viability of this spec. Not minmaxer at heart and for me Frost seems too dull.
---
Has anyone went with their leveling talents that can give me some feedback on how this spec performs? Arcane talents seem more like PvP talents to me can anyone tell me which Arcane talents are best for leveling and why ? 
---
I will be going Ench+ Tailoring proffesions so i can craft phoenix armor fast for that sweet + fire damage.
---
Most of the time i will be dungeoning with my 4 of friends and i will be the designated water vendor and aoe damager.
---
That's brutal, I cannot do it. I wish it will work out for you!
---
Huhu and cthun lol
---
A few points...
---
The negatives you listed for Nostalrius weren't that bad. The lag issues aren't relevant to classic WoW, they only happened for an hour or two during prime time and it was caused by the server architecture not being able to handle so many concurrent players (you could probably look up a more technical explanation).
---
I don't find having to join groups occasionally for quests to be a negative. It actually baffles me how often that people bring up having to play with other people as a negative of large population realms.
---
I hit 60 before Nostalrius implemented dynamic respawns (because leveling wasn't that bad without dynamic respawns) but I don't remember them being that fast on Nostalrius. Other servers implemented much faster dynamic respawns, which could cause problems but that can easily be tweaked.
---
Another thing that people aren't mentioning is that I believe Blizzard is tinkering with dynamic respawns as well. When I started on the stress test I was playing on Server 4 and not only did the Valley of Trials feel like a ghost town, stuff was respawning very quickly. It felt around Nostalrius respawn levels post-dynamic spawn update. The respawns felt slower once I went over to server 15, but I wasn't actually timing stuff to confirm that for sure.
---
So yeah, not a very strong list of negatives. When you compare that to the negatives of layering, it's just a very convincing argument. 
---
I also think it's insane to expect 90% of the player base to quit the game like you seem to be suggesting. When you do the math, it just doesn't hold up. If you expect 5,000,000 people to try Classic, which I feel is a bit high of a number, if 90% of those people quit then you're left with 500,000 sticking with Classic. That number is way too low. By comparison, Nostalrius had over 700,000 accounts created and Nostalrius was a lot less accessible and known as WoW Classic will be. So, a 10% retention rate just doesn't hold up unless you expect only private server players to hit level 60.
---
&gt;They will make it impossible to exploit layering.
---
Okay, but how? Any possible way they could do this would work against the entire concept of layering. Blizzard is not going to put restrictions on your ability to join groups or play with friends. I don't see layering changing much between now and release.
---
I also believe that layering will last for a longer amount of time than they're projecting because like everyone else they're overestimating the amount of players who will quit the game. It seems clear that we will have layering for the entirety of Phase 1, which could last 2-3 months if not longer.
---
Your conclusion that WoW Classic will have problems anyways, so it doesn't matter if you add more problems with layering, is just not very convincing to me. And you didn't even touch on stuff like using layering to avoid world pvp, feeling disconnected from people you've already met on your server, etc.
---
French Canadians.
---
EU players are just being snowflakes and that’s all that needs to be said.
---
If they all want to interact they can speak English considering English is an OFFICIAL language of the EU and even in countries that aren’t in the EU they are still exposed to English as a second or third language.
---
Aus/nz can probably sustain a couple pvp and one pve? I imagine oceanic will launch with one each and then they release more if the demand is there. So surely Germanic language should be at least double that...
---
I don't get how everyone is so surprised, it works exactly as it was explained when they first announced layering.
---
&gt;That's because in these games it's not thousands of people on the same server on the same team, but 5.
---
You only play with 5 people in your group and not whole server in WoW either...
---
Wrong again. Have a nice day!
---
**E X T R A   W I D E !**
---
just look at ff14 servers as an example, all of them are english, but certain servers are dominated by certain countries, so if you were to start on one server, spend dozens of hours leveling, only to then find german people in chats and dungeons.
---
Having national servers would be far better of a solution, and although it'd create smaller pop national servers it'd be beneficial to everyone.
---
Yeah I think Troll is best choice overall. Dwarf priest is nice for PvE but you'll get absolutely wrecked in by shamans in PvP.
---
PC stream when?
---
You're being ignorant, sure we, the people around here won't have a problem to communicate with people in English but
---
1. You're missing the point, the classic experience is in no way the same now
---
2. There are countries where English is only really taught in Highschool or even past that, south of Spain for example. You can generalize this for all of Europe.
---
And that's ignoring the fact that older folks who played in 2004 didn't even get the same focus on English like maybe nowadays.
---
I will have a good time, I don't worry about that. 
---
I have many friends who don't even use reddit because they don't want english in their spare time and they don't know it good enough. Many of them were hyped af for classic. 
---
Have fun trying to teach your 40yr old plumber uncle english in 2 months. He played since TBC in german.
---
Sounds like you have a geopolitical problem, not a Blizzard problem.
---
"WoW is also not Diablo, it is a true MMORPG. You do not level to 30 in an afternoon"
---
Even in 2004, people knew it's important not to turn WoW into Diablo.
---
Hang on were you born 98 and have a 7 year old? Fuck i feel old.
---
Hold up!... HOLD UP!
---
What ami hearing? What is new?
---
I don’t want to be playing with russians
---
just being honest with thoughts so hopefully classic is everything we wanted
---
imma let you finish
---
I dont visit wow forums but probably [this one](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/de/wow/t/gilden-rekrutierungsverzeichnis/24344)
---
idk, on argent dawn we get more people than that during realm-wide community events
---
Fairly sure people like you, are causing more problems. I have played and raided on all the big p-servers..
---
It's a global world, but if you don't want to communicate with the most amount of people in Europe, then you don't need English. That's a good point.
---
&gt; Layering is basically pre-planned server merging.
---
Well then they shouldn't need layering to solve the issue of jam-packed starting zones.
---
Shamans: Also yes
---
It depends of the generation. I'm 30, I'm fluent in english because we started to study english at a young age in school. My parents are 65-70, they don't speak english at all, they never had english classes in school.  
---
I'm pretty sure 90 % of the young french generation can understand and speak english.
---
What are the actual numbers for +dmg/crit/regen/etc. for human vs mage vs other races?
---
All races have slightly different starting values (which I guess make only a tiny difference at 60 but still), and there are the +int/spirit racials that also dont add that much. How much does it add for e.g. a fireball/frost etc. at 60?
---
It seems bad right now but people aren't going to be doing this kind of stuff on live, everyone will want to level. Once the hyped has died down after a few weeks and layering is removed it can done.

*Don't you guys  ̶h̶a̶v̶e̶ ̶p̶h̶o̶n̶e̶s speak english? *
---
That's how you sound.
---
imma rolling undead warrior too. nothing like a discount death knight!
---
ugh, it's a waste of time talking to you. have a day nice and a blasting classic launch full of twitch memes and the likes smiley face
---
The French are really fervorous about their language, the state (and people) do everything they can to keep France French. Besides all the dubbing they also invent new words for words (whereas most other European languages just use an Anglicism - see computer/ordinateur).
---
The servers are split between only english and russian speaking communities. No  individual German, French, Spanish or any other national servers.
---
Nearly everyone speaks English now a days. Hell, these posts complaining about it are in PERFECT English. What's the problem here? Are we looking for a scape goat or something? Something to find wrong?
---
Sorry didnt quite get that. You mean to say that if a french player plays on a planned eu server they will still see the quest texts in french? Thanks for the answer.
---
Well thanks for your answer and before I get even more into this I just agree on the point that we both disagree. The points you just mentioned did actually just further prove to me that you actually do lack the knowledge required or the mental capactiy to comprehend or you have just a weird outlook on the whole matter from my point of view.
---
Exactly my point...
---
Do you realize how fucking stupid this argument is? It's like saying music concerts are bad because you were on one once and somebody hit your car in the parking lot. Like how the performer has any power over things like that?
---
How many concurrent players do you expect on a single server during the launch window?
---
The point I wanted to stress is, that it is not a problem itself. It's highly subjective and rather a desire of a broad player base. As it is your desire to rather speak English.
---
The problem arises from the split communities you create by forcing people into communities they don't want to belong to. And that in the end hurts the server as a whole.
---
With servers for every country/language you personally would still have the possibility to play on UK servers.
---
You are delusional if you think Classic will have more players than retail like 6 months after launch. And thats coming from the biggest Classic fanboy on here.
---
Tetris didn't get stale. Sometimes games can just be fun...
---
Europe has what 600 milloin not counting russians since they have own servers. 
---
Then we have countries like turkey that takes Off about 70 milloin since no one there seems to play videogames. We end up with roughly 530 mill
---
1/5 speak german
---
1/5 speaks french
---
1/5 speaks spanish
---
1/5 is english and
---
1/5 mixed bag
---
So even if some of the dutch, french and spanish people do want to speak english we still end up with about 2,5/5 refusing to speak english. 
---
Ofc this is totally inaccurate but at least gives you some I sight. 
---
Half of the population will speak totally different language and they can take over realms.
---
Good question and to be honest I can’t say for certain but I have a guess with some explanation:
---
Ideally we, the players and Blizzard, just want a smooth launch experience without 5 hour long queues or overcrowded zones for those first few days. Getting through that initial surge is important because you want people to have a good experience and hope they continue to play. 
---
However, even with a perfect launch experience player populations on most servers will start to drop after the first couple of weeks. Servers that have big streamers will be the exception here and will take a while longer to lose people. I honestly don’t know what the correct solution is for those servers is aside from, “enjoy your queue, I hope it’s worth it”. They are purposely choosing to inundate that server knowing full well that there will be queues. 
---
But for the other servers, a fair amount of people who were “just checking it out” won’t be logging in as much after the first few weeks. People who take time off will be going back to work. Pretty much all students will be back in school too. A couple other new games will be coming out around that time too. All of these things add up and draw a significant portion of the player population away from the game. 
---
I also think that everyone’s character levels will be more evenly spread out after a couple weeks They will be questing in all of the zones instead of just a few. The congestion and quest choke points won’t be nearly as bad. There could still be queue times for some servers but those times will be a hell of a lot more reasonable than what we will see for the first few days after launch. 
---
I’d hope if Blizzard is seeing that most servers are completely filling their layers, even after a few weeks; they will just offer free transfers while removing the layering system. I want them to try something where if the servers continue to be overpopulated, players have the option to a) stay and deal with whatever queue times, b) a free transfer to a “linked server”, or c) a free transfer to another open but unlinked server. 
---
A linked server means that your character names on the original server are reserved. So if they ever decided to merge the servers back together, you will be able to keep your character’s name throughout the whole process. But if you choose to move to a unlinked server, your character name will become free and could potentially be taken by someone else. 
---
I don’t have a solid answer so I guess we will have to see what happens. If it has to stay in longer than a couple of weeks, so be it. The truth is I’ll be playing this game regardless of what happens with layering. However if they want to keep it in for longer, they better have something put in place to either deter or prevent exploits. 
---
I’m really hoping to see something added during the next two months of beta that addresses this issue. I think a simple anchor to one layer would solve a lot of problems. You can travel to different layers through group invites but once you leave the group, you get pulled back to the layer you’re anchored to. Logging out and creating or changing characters doesn’t change your layer because the anchor is account wide. Maybe you could manually change your anchor to another layer every few hours so you aren’t permanently stuck but you’re also unable to abuse the system. Also as I said earlier, if you get caught trying to exploit the layering mechanics, you’re banned for X hours. The bans will become exponentially more severe if the exploit attempts continue. 
---
Lemme know what you think.
---
Yeah no one is forcing me but my friends wouldnt want to playn on english exclusive realms.
---
Many people who are excited for classic are simply older. I'm 24 and watch all my entertainment in english. I have many friends that don't. I don't think you will enjoy grouping with a someone for a dungeon who is barely speaking your english. 
---
As said before, my 40yr old plumber uncle played wow since tbc and is hyped af for classic. Imagine being him. (in case you are curious, he doesn't watch english tv shows)
---
Do not conflate Ion's words with what his financial masters demand of him. He is a figurehead.
---
This. We're all likely hyping too. But we just don't want "problematic" additions coming in to bite into our enjoyment of the game. If layering hurts the economy or PvP gameplay it could have a sweeping demotivating effect on a lot of peoples enjoyment of the game.
---
You are absolutely wrong. On hungarian fansite i've already seen a poll asking if you want to roll the same server to play with other hungarian people. You think they'll bother speaking english just so those "few" who doesnt speak hungarian can understand too?  
---
You are absolutely delusional.
---
The problem isn't financial, it's social.
---
Look at the mistake they made with retail. They kept adding more and more servers, and then as people left those servers were less populated.
---
You don't want to repeat the mistakes of the past.
---
Is there anyplace i can find pre-bis/bis items for each phases of classic? 
---
I only really got to play the last 7/8 months of retail vanilla and i know the bis sets change as phases are implemented due to stat changes. 
---
Thanks in advance :)
---
Except that is literally not how layering works. Your thinking of sharding. Its a little funny how sure you are but how wrong you actually are.
---
I know I'll get downvoted for negativity, but this shit is jank AF.  You have that second monitor on a little end table or something.  You can't get an L-shaped desk?
---
And dont say it's due to money because I see your headset that has a built in mic and you spent money on a boom mic because what, youre the next asmongold?
---
The banner?  Okay, but it should just be the Ironforge crest if you're repping anything alliance ;P  HOWEVER your window treatments are something out of the 90s.  Dafuq dude.  Get  your ass down to home depot or Lowes and just take a walk through modern window treatments.
---
Have some dignity.
---
I apologize for this, but someone had to say it, and I understand the hate I receive.
---
You are from Finland where pretty much everyone is learning English as they grow up due to TV and other media. Countrys like french don't really teach English, at least not as much as Finnland and not even as much as germany where most people only learn the basics. Its easy to say "just learn some basic English" if you are from a Scandinavian country where almost everyone speaks English. It's not like you can learn that in a week, and these people don't want to learn a whole language to play, they just want to play their old favorite game.
---
Also with only basic english, you won't understand a lot of conversations and understanding someone speaking English in discord or even talking in English is on a completely more complex level.
---
Noone gets forced, you can just join a German or French guild...
---
&gt;  the classic experience is in no way the same now
---
There is no possible way blizzard could have made it the same experience, its a game not a time machine.  
---
Speaking english instead of your native language is probably the smallest change to the experience.
---
I really, really hope you are right.
---
That's 3 languages. Again, try 10+.
---
The EU isn't a country, neither is Europe. If you don't think it's a problem you can play on those servers and try it.
---
It's all viable, just depends on your end game
---
If you are talking about those who already subscribe. It’s their fault of paying for classic beta instead of playing bfa, only idiot have sympathy on those complaints
---
Isn't vanilla the first in last out system. Aka you can protect your buffs with worse buffs on top of them from purging?
---
a few weeks?  TRY THE ENTIRE PHASE 1 OF THE GAME AND POSSIBLY LONGER
---
If there are still enough people around for AQ opening to even consider needing sharding/layering/whatever, I am sure they will say "mission successful".
---
Did you ever play a private server? Thats not a problem at all, everyone understand wow english like 'sheep moon' or 'WTS mooncloth' and if you dont you will learn quick enough.
---
Blizzard has already dealt with this problem in Retail by having simple lockouts, in the scenario when they want to keep layering past phase 1, they will simply make you unable to get loot from world bosses more than once a week.
---
ITS FOR EMPHASIS!! EMPHASIS
---
Thus my question. Why wouldnt they play on a International realm where People speak English as a main language.
---
It's almost like layering is Blizzards attempt at solving multiple issues, like horribly packed starting zones, population drops.. What have you.
---
If there's a realm named Burning Legion, you can bet it will be taken over by the Poles like on retail.
---
Wait there won't be any classic servers beside English ones?
---
Also, it's fucking retarded they would not fill to the brim at least two UK, one french and one German servers for each PvP and PvE options. Like, you will have players, wtf.
---
No.. those who subscribed for the beta/stress test, got in, and now complain that others got it for free.
---
Remember Spainbreaker?
---
Like I said it depends if you're healing in PvP. The racials are basically useless for a holy priest as they don't scale at all, and DP costs a ton of Mana without IF. I honestly don't think Shamans are that much of a problem. 
---
I'd personally be more worried about Undead when I'm on Ally. When a rogue jumps you or a war, your one save is fear - which won't work. If I were going to PvE serious at all it wouldn't even be a choice for me, dwarf priest. FW is extremely viable and wanted. Easy groups. But if you don't like the aesthetic then that's a problem as well
---
I never really understood these topics. What kind of answer are you looking for exactly? You made this to feel a bit better about yourself, since you will find many ppl here who equally "pathetic"? Or you wanna hear that no, you aren't you just doing what you love and thats what matters? Or you really just wanted to tell the world that you think you are pathetic and you feel bad about it? What was the point?
---
So you only play in a 5 man group all the time? You never solo and find another player that you might wanna help? You never trade, you never talk to people in any chats other than your 5 man group? You never raid or PvP in any battlegrounds? Damn, you sure are missing out on a lot of the game.
---
Don't you guys have ph- speak english??!
---
I'd say that if there's no local server, I won't use a local server. It will just add confusion
---
Did i say that? His argument was that loot from hard content is exciting to get and i disagree.
---
It is the hydraulic lift table from IKEA. I don't want to butcher the name with a guess but it was on sale when my wife and I were passing through so I couldn't pass it up.
---
Green items aren’t turning up in chests. I was cursing the imaginary people that were looting and leaving junk until a chest spawned beside with just junk.
---
&gt; Did they think this is a better solution? If so how?
---
I think there's really only one way this is better. 
---
Hardware infrastructure is easier to handle if you have fewer realms which are not further split by language, I do not see what other reason they have. 
---
Like mentioned in the OP if they fear that there won't be enough players around (which is just strange, the Hype is massive in Germany alone) they could fight it with a merge down the road. There will be enough of those with their layer-system regardless.
---
Yes, I know. Hence my reason for providing a suggestion at a way to potentially improve the system.
---
im the opposite to you, i played ally in vanilla (not to 60, was a giant noob) but have been on horde since the start of WotLK. Was super hyped to level through vanilla as horde but my current guild who ive been with since WotLK have voted to play alliance come classic.
---
I was a bitter pill to swallow but i want to stick with my guild.
---
For The Alliance!!!... i suppose...
---
Oh c'mon you have to be trolling me. You can't be serious with that
---
They just need mob tagging to be shared, as well as loot. Fixed
---
But it's not classicy enough, lol
---
Give me a break. "Cdew, Xaryu and others"? Like they are the fucking avengers. Most of them are whiny bitches who don't know what the game is about.
---
Unofficial EU specific language servers will pop here and there for the **very few** EU players who don't speak English, so why is this a big deal? I'm portuguese, 27, and guess what? I had to learn English to play videogames since I was 7, because there simply wasn't a portuguese option, and I thank god for it, now I speak two languages fluently.
---
Now, the NA streamer problem is a huge problem especially for the likes of Soda or Asmongold, since they 100% have the power to absolutely wreck a server at will, either by leaving, creating in-game events or hell even logging in on stream.
---
&gt; Were they worried that Classic wouldnt have as many players as Vanilla and that making seperate language servers was gonna make ghost town servers?
---
Seems like the most logical conclusion. From their POV it is probably easier to roll regional servers later if it turns out to be a bigger success than they think.
---
Mmm yea that would be really annoying. I see your point.
---
Man i'm french and i'm already laughing to hear my fellow countrymen arguing with angry british players abount language, frog, Rosbif, Napoléon, Rugby and tea.
---
It's going to be fun, oh oui !
---
That is not the point. The point is, people in Classic want to have the feeling of belonging together. This is way more natural when it happens with people of the same mother tongue. Nobody will feel at home when they have to speak english with people who could be french, italien, spanish, german, etc. 
---
It's really not that complicated, and our ability to speak english is NOT the factor here, because yes, most of us can speak english at at least B1 level.
---
i'm fine with no german and french realms. i just hope they take the osrs approach and after a while indicate on the realm selection screen that a realm is predominantly *x* or *y*.
---
Cdew is like the biggest pleb in vanilla, yes.
---
That's not what it's trying to solve or does solve. Pay attention.
---
I agree that a time limit is the best option. It's shit, but probably necessary. After the first phase we won't even be talking about layering anymore (fingers crossed). At the end of the day I personally won't enjoy sitting in a starter zone for 3 or 4 hours because of too much competition for mobs.
---
Not sure where I stand on this topic tbh. I guess we will find out.
---
Never be ashamed of your passions 😂
---
Stamina is valuable in pvp but not so much in pve. pve bis gear tends to be glass cannon style (except tank obviously).
---
I find it intriguing that European players are so upset to share a WoW server together. 
---
And yet in the real world, many think a United States of Europe country would be a swell idea. Which they are already working towards with currency union, an EU military, more control over individual state's taxes, ect. Seems like difference in language is the least of the worries.
---
I see no problem with only English and Russian EU servers. Most Scandinavians and Germans have a decent standard of English. I can see the French rebelling against it, though.
---
But they didn't backpedal, they specifically mentioned the "single world boss" when they talked about [phasing in Classic during Blizzcon 2018.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-GobXQTf6w)
---
The reason English is not seen as the international language in France is historical. They are the only country that do not recognise English as the international language in the whole of Europe. It is a political decisions by the French politicians, hence you are taught that in school. But have no doubt you were lied to by your teachers due to state decisions in the 60's.
---
Tip for classic players. Create /french /german /spain etc channels day 1 on your servers so it will help to find you community.
---
Why do you people insist on bullying people around? Do you not think it is an issue people can currently switch layers *at the press of a button*?
---
What the fuck is wrong with you.
---
Why woudn't it? Classic is a much better game, even if you cap the game at level 5-10-30-40 whatever it's better than BFA. 
---
BFA's content each patch lasts 2 weeks and then there's nothing to do in the game, besides boring chores and collecting your 999999th mount/pet/toy/transmog.
---
Servers should be more elastic anyways, more resources, mobs, etc for the amount of players. They should increase and decrease in incriments based on population in that area
---
I haven't seen any complaints from Italian or Spanish players who will need to play on an English-speaking realm - which makes sense, as if you know English well enough to visit this sub you'll have no problems playing on an English-speaking realm.
---
What I have seen are complaints from native English speakers who fear they'll find themselves stuck in a realm where the majority is Italian or Spanish, so they won't be able to follow Barrens chat and find themselves in parties that discuss strategy in a foreign language.
---
This however will only happen if the critical mass of Italian or Spanish players is enough to "take control" of a given server. Blizzard clearly believes this won't be the case.
---
And not having to deal with fucking russians
---
Didn't realise catering to tens of thousands of customers was such an issue.
---
Who the hell cares about how decorated he is? That's a different game. 
---
This is classic and in classic he's just above average. You don't even know the kind of shit a *real* classic mage can pull.
---
I might be in the minority, but I absolutely do not care what your PC setup looks like, it was nothing to do about Classic. Take it to r/battlestations if you want karma.
---
You all think this looks so cool and that layering sucks, etc. but the reality is that this battle was so laggy it was unplayable. Like a slideshow.
---
Way to not be a one upper.
---
Are you daft?
---
I played with 400-600 back in the day. 128ms seems like a dream.
---
I just happen to have a lot of friends who are not even in the slightest able to understand complex english sentences. They even said they will not play, because it will not be the same. They will never type in chat because they don't want to be pointed at for being bad at it. That's just the way it is.
---
In addition, it was in vanilla and people are used to it, it's not the same if you never give someone something or first give it to him and then take it away.
---
It really boils down to one thing; burst damage vs sustained damage.
---
You want sustainable DPS in raiding and you want to do as much damage as you can in the shortest time frame possible in PvP. Plus Stamina is super important in PvP, but in PvE its pretty much a wasted stat unless you're a tank.
---
Druids are one of the best PvP classes easily. If people say otherwise it's because they listen to PvE talk. Ferals for example have good damage, can pop into bear for a heal and to be a little tankier when facing 1vX, and then can pop into travel and heal. They also heal *very* well, it's not like retail. 
---
Balance hits hard as fuck with some gear and can heal easily enough. Druids are extremely strong in 1v1s and world PvP, while also being the best FCs by a long shot
---
The european single market did a pretty great job of making europeans feel like the belong together.  
---
At least everyone I know that isnt a nationalist feels that way. And I have no problem with nationalists feeling uncomfortable.
---
There is none on alliance so you have to filter by horde only to get a correct number. Shaman is the most played class in horde according to these numbers
---
Not fail but only minority players will play it after initial hype and that is the way everyone except Classic fanboys sees it.
---
Not a mage expert at all, but if my knowledge is right you need 6% to not miss against 2 lvls higher targetes and need 16% hit to not miss against 3 lvl higher targets, so having that 3 points in arcane focus is huge and 4th point is pretty much a waste.  
---
Also might wanna take imp arc missiles instead of that extra point and 3 points on AE crit.
---
&gt;And i Don t want to Deal with french people.
---
Why? We have wine and you have beer, we can only be friends! 
---
I mean, France and Germany were friends all the time in history. Right? RIGHT?
---
I actually learned alot of french in 2004 playing Guild Wars with a french clan, we can learn from eachother no need to seperate!
---
probably not that important when all you have is two 6 slot bags
---
You forgot "Cheese Eating Surrender Monkeys"! It's gonna be like medieval europe. Fits the setting!
---
It’s not a problem. I played RuneScape for years and you know what people did? They dealt with it.
---
There were Dutch, Finnish, Polish, Spanish, Asian,  Portuguese, etc groups who liked to play together in country clans but they still interacted with the world at large in English and everyone had a good time. 
---
It doesn’t matter if the EU isn’t a country. It governs their countries and it mandates English as an important language to know. Willful ignorance is only a problem for those who choose to be that way. I could just as easily say I want an all male server because girls suck at gaming but that would be ridiculous just like you snowflakes crying because you have to share a server with other people. 
---
At the end of the day if you are too awkward to put yourself out there and make an attempt to communicate then that’s your own problem. As an American who studied abroad for a year in Europe and traveled around I had to make an effort to learn the basics of some languages and people are nice enough to be understanding that you are at least making an effort. And if they can identify what language you can speak comfortably they are happy to switch to it if they are able to. Stop being cringy autists. It’s ok to speak in broken English if it’s going to make all of your lives easier.
---
I insta mute everyone not speaking english in public chat.
---
Naturally, you'd simply have fewer guilds with greater numbers. Its also then makes sense to have more officers than we do today so its not one guy carrying the whole structure on that persons back. I remember class officers going from being a regular concept in vanilla to being borderline nonexistent as TBC went on.
---
I agree that this would make the experience for players that do not want to speak English alot worse but I think there's alot of outrage about this already on the subreddit. I think to get it more attention there should be made forum posts in the official blizzard forums.
---
What's the solution then ? :\^)
---
That's like saying Venruki is the best Neverwinter Nights player and therefore he is uber skilled in classic wow.
---
activate that damn windows
---
I honestly understand why as what we have seen happen on retail non English servers but at the same time if you don't think the French and German pop can fill two realms each. That is an issue.
---
Yes indeed. All game text will be translated. Quests, items, user interface..
---
&gt; But if you don't like the aesthetic then that's a problem as well
---
Exactly, I don't like the look of dwarfs so I don't want to play one just because of Fear Ward. Undead and shamans are a big problem in PvP and because I'm planning to do both PvP (Shadow &amp; healing) and PvE I think troll will be the better choice.
---
Strawman. No one has talked about *every* language in Europe getting their own servers. They've talked about the largest ones, meaning German, French, Spanish, and Italian.
---
The smaller ones will go together on an international english speaking server, and together with english speaking countries they will be large enough for several servers.
---
Hey, I'd love to play on a Norwegian server. That isn't going to happen, but I'd still let "ze germans" have theirs. Why try to ruin it for them when there is no need?
---
Exactement.
---
I don't. Must be on a different layer. :v)
---
You're assuming there's going to be enough people of each nationality to support an entire server. 
---
Blizzard isn't assuming that. They're playing things very cautiously, which does make sense, given that they have no idea how successful Classic will be. It might be wildly successful and three months after release they'll be opening new servers left right and centre. Or it might be a small scale success, enough to fill a couple of servers, but no more.
---
But what about launch players who didnt get CE ... how will we be identified :(
---
&gt; That's because in these games it's not thousands of people on the same server on the same team, but 5. There is a lot of people that 5stack in french, german, russian, you name it 
---
Well, people group up in OW, true, but you can do the same here at least for levelling/dungeons if you want to, and exactly like in OW, if you only have 1/2/3 friends you need to find "someone else" who might not speak german (and you can get away by typing, while you can't really do that in OW).
---
&gt; It also cant really form enclaves, if you are the only german, youre forced to speak english.
---
You're forced to speak english in any other MMO (I'm sure you don't speak german usually in CS:GO) so it's not too different. I understand that WoW is more community driven than other games, but is this really a big problem? I mean, you're here on reddit speaking english with an italian guy and it's all going well, ALL the people that are here on reddit complaining about international servers can speak english well enough to be part of an international community.
---
&gt; I play loads of CSGO. I am german, but don't have the stereotypical accent. Often people ask me where I come from, and If i told them german, often times (more than half) they would proceed to spam the voicechat talking german to me, start giving german call outs, casually talk to me in german while everyones trying to play.
---
I agree, this is boring when it's too much, but:
---
1. This kind of people are probably a very strong minority for WoW Classic. The WoW Classic community is mainly made of people who where in their teen/early 20s during Vanilla/TBC/WOTLK and are now late 20/30/40. It's a mature community overall. This doesn't mean that there are no kids and dumb people, but probably less than what you can find in a F2P FPS like CS:GO.
---
2. From my experience (and I've played competitive games for the past 8 years) the higher the rank, the lower the people who can't speak/understand english and that meme people for their accents. When the game gets to a certain level the kids are left behind and the high-end community is always very international. I know this doesn't apply well to WoW, but I guess the main idea is the same, at lvl 60 the not-too-casual to full-hardcore players will have no trouble at all dealing with an international community.
---
Lol, learn to read
---
EU - Horde - PVP
---
Looking for a group of players to just enjoy the game with, I am a casual, have never raided before and mostly just enjoyed wPvP, dungeons and BGs without ever having BiS gear.
---
I intend to play undead priest, with an alt mage/lock at some point.
---
Just send me a message if you've got a group of friends or guild all looking forward to the game and having fun :D.
---
Honestly they should be knocking. They remove the most hated part of classic and gives incentives to players to give blizzard money for transfers. Its litterally win-win
---
This is literally how layering works. A server is split into multiple layers and you CAN jump layer if someone from a different layer invites you. If I am on layer 1, I can jump to layer 2, then to layer 3, then layer 4 and so on. You are talking to a beta tester and someone who have been in every stress test actually testing the layering system. I am gonna stop responding to you now vecause it is obvious you are a stupid wrath baby that I have beyond zero interest in arguing with. You'e wrong. So very wrong. And a quick google or youtuve search would tell you how wrong you are but you clearly have no interest in learning facts to back up your claims so I'm done. Just the fact that your first comment thought he farmed herbs to make those potions shows how clueless you are 😂
---
[this](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Formulas:Mob_XP)  is what I found online
---
&gt; I had the phone slapped on me several times because of it at work
---
Wut? Man i'm french and the french who did this to you is an asshole.
---
What a narrow-minded statement! I am a native german speaker and I would say that my english is very good compared to others but that doesn‘t mean I like to communicate in english while I‘m playing WoW.
---
Same here! No idea why, but I'm happy!
---
judging by old population caps it 5k would be extremely high.
---
Hey Rapteg, there will be a french client this is not the problem, the problem is the integration with other foreign languages.
---
It actually said it was for cool guys and girls.
---
So you never played a private server and noticed how this was not a problem at all? With the exception of Chinese who wont be there. My point stands, talk your native language with friends and guild and simple wow english with everyone else. Correct decision by Blizzard here I hope they wont revert it.
---
I mean, yes, it's kind of daring to try and go with just a few servers at the beginning. But tbfh here, based on a lot of the "bug reports" coming from the beta, a lot of players will drop it shortly after trying. All the quality of life changes (improvements) are hard to get away from. I also like how suddenly 75% of the current player base has such nostalgic feelings for classic, claiming to have played since beta and stuff.
---
Classic is not for everyone (including me) and Blizz does good to start low and adapt.
---
For the Horde!
---
If you played Tibia like I did, back in time we had problems with german, sweden and portugal people as well.
---
As long as the vertical upgrade is kept to a minimum, it's more than fine.
---
Look at TBC, ok? In 2 years the difference between T3 and T6 was GINORMOUS.
---
1.13 can add a T 3.5 (or equivalent) side upgrade, a T 4 upgrade, a T5 upgrade , a T 5.5 side upgrade and a T6 upgrade, and the difference between T3 and T6 in a potential 1.13 to be around 50%.
---
As an example , T3 vs T6 in TBC, and a potential T3 and T6 in 1.13.
---
\-**Vanilla T3 Warrior Chest** : 1,027 armor, +21 str, +43 sta, +13 Def, +1% Dodge, +2% hit
---
\-**TBC T6 Warrior Chest** : 10,659 armor, +375 sta, +89 agi, +41 str, Meta socket, Blue Socket, Yellow Socket, Red Socket, +121 dodge rating, +240 defense rating, +97 block rating, +147 parry, +54 expertise, + 133 block value
---
\-**Potential 1.13 T6 Warrior Chest** : 1,670 armor, + 32 str, +65 sta, +18 Def, +1% Dodge, +1% Parry, +2% hit.
---
We can even DOUBLE the stats on a T6 in a potential 1.13 compared to T3, and the power creep would still be less than HALF of the TBC T6.
---
Yes, vertical upgrade must exists...but why does it have to be absolutely insane?
---
Just your average streamer realm
---
fuck Asmongold
---
Phasing is where you are in a quest chain
---
Sharding is mini pieces of individual zones, and you shift across them dynamically
---
Layering is the entire continent and you stay in the same one for your entire session unless you are invited into a group
---
Let's not be like the Americans and make everything a race (or nationality) issue. The simple fact is that the bigger continental Europe countries (Germany, France, Spain, Italy...) have a culture that isn't very conductive for learning English, which is why proportionally more of them can't or prefer not to speak it.
---
Most movies and TV that would originally be in English are dubbed in these countries, and video games are usually localized too. This means that people in those countries naturally have a harder time picking up English than people in countries that use subtitles instead of dubbing and aren't big enough to get localized games. There's a reason people from eg. the Nordics on average speak much better English than people from France or Germany.
---
It's not about national pride or stupidity or stubborness, it's a simple matter of these countries providing fewer opportunities to learn it. I was fluent in English by the time I entered middle school and that was purely because I *had* to learn it in order to play video games, and over half of the TV we got was English with subtitles.
---
Its never too late to learn. People should consider this an opportunity instead of being afraid of it. You can always find a french speaking guild for sure. Its just not as big a deal as People make it really.
---
88/89 man, you borked your math 🤣
---
Where from?  It was 170ish for me for the last 30odd hours.
---
J'e parle Francais. Now throw your gf at me.
---
Some nice ones in there, I'd be sure to check out MonkeyQuest.
---
I am a native german speaker and I would say that my english is very good compared to others but that doesn‘t mean I like to communicate in english while I‘m playing WoW. 
---
I have lots of trouble to understand idioms in english because I am not used to them. Understanding english with different accents in discord is hella difficult as well. Sarcasm can‘t be „grasped“ by everyone which leads to misunderstanding. Friends of mine don‘t understand anything.
---
The statement that other MMOs operate international realms as well doesn‘t mean it works out good.
---
&gt;a
---
what about ping tho?
---
Yeah 100%, racials aren't important enough to hate your race looks. Go troll, it's strong as fuck
---
&gt;Why woudn't it? Classic is a much better game, even if you cap the game at level 5-10-30-40 whatever it's better than BFA.
---
While I agree the majority of Wow players in 2019 dont and will quickly go back to instant gratification of BfA.
---
Never heard of tibia
---
Why not?
---
I'll try to put a positive spin on what their plans might be (although I'm not sure I believe it myself, just trying to give an optimistic outlook):
---
- Launch with a few servers with heavy layering to support demand.
---
- Evaluate the situation after a few weeks/months to see how many players are still active on each server, how much layering is still required, nationality distributions, horde/alliance balance, etc.
---
- Open up new French/German/Whatever realms and allow free character transfers from existing realms to these new realms. At the same time as this, remove layering from all servers.
---
- Merge any existing servers that lost too many players due to moving to non-English realms.
---
Both! It's inevitable
---
The cap will be much higher. That's what layering is for.
---
I'd bring the counterpoint that while it can be argued that people should really need to get better in english in certain country... cough cough France  (source I'm french) it's also great to play in your own language with people who share the same popular culture.
---
I mean it's not like people on english realms will laugh if I make a joke about pain au chocolat, if I compare someone speech to lyrics from Maitre Gims or if I complain about cheese.
---
More over let's not pretend the average english level in europe is so fantastic that they can write complex joke with words and speak perfectly in voice chat: I played Overwatch for some time and it's not like teenagers from Sweden have a very large vocabulary or that it's easy to understand the guy with a strong polish of spanish accent not happy about the fact he didn't get a heal.
---
So... yes I can play in english without a problem but will it be as enjoyable? maybe not.
---
Pretty sure they have it. The first stress test server I joined (4) had like no players in the Valley of Trials and Sarkoth was respawning every 20 seconds or so. It was actually kinda ridiculous. When I switched to server 15, there were a lot more players but the respawns felt much slower.
---
are your 70 year old parents going to be playing wow?
---
I really understand the "opportunity" argument, but you should not force it upon people. You can find one yes, but the pool of which you choose is much more limited.
---
Goodness you're fragile..
---
I used to love getting boosts from RED STAR on Zenedar, no idea what they were saying but being 10th man and carried through UBRS at stupid o'clock in the morning stands out for me.
---
I kinda understand, but most games don't have this.... Most games are EU and NA. I honestly don't think it's as easy of a decision as you guys are acting. The population might not even be sustainable if they go making servers for every different language/region
---
Then how many of those 5k do you expect to be tourists and how many stick with the game to eventually hit level 60?
---
Nope, I was blind to this!
---
Questie is my preference
---
Yes, people are treating this like a retail expansion launch
---
I don't think you even understand the issue. I did play private servers. People don't behave the way you say they are or should.
---
I was replying to the guy with 98 at the end of his name lol.
---
I was 89 myself.
---
LOL, hard agree on the last part.
---
I have no problem with streamers, it's just the weird cult following of people like this who would bite their own left nut off just to have asmongold giggle at their "POGGERS DANSGAME" in the chat.
---
what a terrible play
---
By what fucking logic has France and Spain more Players than Germany?
---
What’s weird is that asmon is a horse toothed mongoloid dude with pasty skin and these are a swarm of dudes who probably wear jorts.
---
Probably not 90% and not the first 3 days but 30-50% in the first 1-3months yeah.
---
The hype is too big for the game to grow/ keep all the initial players. 
---
There are so many players who just want to play a bit for nostalgic reasons, many haven't even played wow but will try classic just because of the hype and might not like it/ get bored of it and even some of the most hyped people might get burned out from putting literally every second of their free time on launch.
---
Same for most of the hybrids. Pve isnt their strength but in pvp they are going to surprise people who listen to threads saying they are completely useless
---
 I ran ST this week with a Chinese group where the only english spoken was 'LF heal ST' and 'you heal?' We communicated via emotes, - it was doable and kind of novel I guess but I'd really feel for someone who would never experience any more social interaction in-game than /oom /cheer /thank and /point.
---
?
---
Name one of those million of reasons.
---
Because I can name a single that that makes 1.13. 100% certain : OSRS.
---
OSRS was dead after launch, and it grew 3 times the size of their retail, after adding NEW content.
---
So, where is your reason why 1.13 is impossible?
---
Just one of your million reasons please?
---
Layering should end like a week after launch, there is absolutely no reason to keep it around longer than that. By then all the try hards will have leveled way beyond the starting / low level areas and people still coming in to the game making new characters will have no problem leveling up.
---
I only had dial up internet back then so I couldn't actually play when the game launched but I had the self-host version and just run around Azeroth for hours before I could finally play the game.
---
I believe what is meant is that if Blizzard believes a German server, with roughly 120  million speakers (i.e. eligible players to fill the server) can't sustain a player population then the odds that oce, which, despite what people say mainly includes NZ and AUS (people further north are likely to have the same ping to the US as to Sydney, decreasing their desire/need for OCE specific servers) which combined only have a population of roughly 30 million, won't be able to sustain a player population that Blizzard believes worthwhile for its own server. 
---
The only hope is that blizzard believes player experience of decreased ping is worth it. And they didn't for the first six years of the game's life.
---
It's not apples to oranges when examined properly.
---
But this survey is not for beta. It is for "what will you play on 27th August" :)
---
Could someone explain why countries such as Germany or France wants/needs their own servers? Why not just use English as you do 99% of the other time when you use the internet. Maybe it's just cause I'm Swedish but I've always assumed the rest of the EU were also trained in English early on
---
I don't think it's going to help.
---
Because fighting against level 63 AI based (read completely predictable) PvE bosses is a lot different than fighting against a level 60 character controlled by another person (far less predictable with the ability to do something completely unpredictable).  
---
For example, in a raid scenario as a DPS class, you should almost never be taking direct damage from a raid boss as they’re not going to attack you directly if you manage your threat properly.  In PvP there is no threat system, and other players WILL most certainly target you and do their best to kill you.  This makes stamina have a lot more value to non tanks in PvP vs PvE.  Also, because of the level difference (63 for PvE 60 for raids) players need far less +hit chance on their gear in PvP where as its the best DPS stat up to the (much higher) PvE hit cap.  Weapon skill is would be another example.  It’s amongst the best DPS stat for rogues and warriors up to the 315 point in PvE, but is worthless in PvP.
---
Remind Me! 65 days
---
In pvp you have to worry about not dying yourself and having CC.
---
In PvE most mobs are immune to CC and you don't have to worry about dying so you essentially go full glass cannon.
---
Been working on the gamer-cave all summer. It's almost there! 
---

---
Sorry for the potato quality pictures.
---
No, there is no chance. Layers get opened up and close down all the time. P2 introduces world bosses. Layers in P2 would mean unlimited world bosses. They could stop them from spawning after they were killed, but what if guilds on different layers start killing them at the same time? Do they despawn once one is dead?
---
It's not "naive". Layering and world bosses don't work together, that's why Ion made that clear. You never know if a developer changes plans, but it just makes no sense here.
---
I... don't see a problem here. You don't want to play with people who speak in different language? 
---
If you are afraid of someone being an asshole and talking to their friends in german about you while you don't understand it - tough luck, it has nothing to so with language, they could so the same on their private channel.
---
If you are afraid that people won't interact with you - well that's part of vanilla experience, and someone not wanting to interact with you for any reason is not enough reasoning to send them to another server
---
Haha, ur funny dude. Nice joke.
---
No it's not. 
---
I really don't want to offend you but please inform on youtube what layering is used for. It's for having a "ok" population after the first weeks of launch and many people leaving the game. In phase 2 we will have "vanilla like" server pop caps. 
---
I hope you don't get angry :b
---
&gt; The simple fact is that the bigger continental Europe countries (Germany, France, Spain, Italy...) have a culture that isn't very conductive for learning English, which is why proportionally more of them can't or prefer not to speak it.
---
What?  
---
I'll go out on a limb here and guess well over 80% aged 40 and younger have ok or better conversational english skills in those countries.  
---
Prefering not to speak it, what does that even mean, people speak english when they can't use their native tounge, i doubt most people will have a problem with that in an online game.
---
It's like 70ish to the East Coast from the UK.
---
I have lots of trouble to understand idioms in english because I am not used to them. Understanding english with different accents in discord is hella difficult as well. Sarcasm can‘t be „grasped“ by everyone which leads to misunderstanding. Friends of mine don‘t understand anything. Overall it encourages toxic behaviour for example I don‘t even know often someone insulted me with the term „Nazi“ just for speaking german. When someone speaks french he is a „Frogeater“ etc. pp.
---
It leads to parallel societies within a server where people get excluded that don‘t speak your language.
---
Sounds like a personal problem. The only person for them to blame is themselves for willful ignorance. English is the world language and it would serve them well in life to at least be able to understand it on a basic level. There are plenty of great free resources out there to learn English like Duolingo. You can become conversational with as little as 10 minutes of practice a day. If that’s too much to ask of them then they probably wouldn’t have lasted that long in Classic regardless. So it would be dumb to fragment the player base just for them.
---
Oh No!! People wanna join the fun! How can we let this happen ??
---
Imagine unironically not being able to speak english in 2019. English is literally the language with most speakers in the world, just learn the fucking language.
---
It's not difficult, 'Hi' is a greeting and so on. English isn't my first language but I'm not an insufferable jackass so I have learned how to speak it.
---
All these people trying to hide from the facts.
---
France and Germany are notorious for rejecting English. Every big Hollywood movie gets a dub in the theaters.
---
I'm from Belgium, That's next to France and Germany. Once you cross the language border, you can't rely on people understanding you. If you go to a big city and order something, of course they will know English. I think a lot of people that have been tourists think that everyone in the country has the same knowledge of English.
---
My experience isn't that EVERY French and German guy I meet in WoW refuses to talk English. It's just that IF someone can't talk English, they are most likely to be French, German or Russian.
---
I don't care that much, I just never liked it when the trade channel is recruiting native speakers for French/German/Spanish guilds. So they can all be on the same server for all I care. 
---
It's just funny how now everyone goes "OH BUT THE DO KNOW ENGLISH HUH". Because they don't. If you compare it to The Netherlands or Denkmark/Sweden/Norway where I've discovered that it's a lot easier to speak English over there.
---
I'll throw a Rejuv, Thorns &amp; MotW your way - while I zoom past you in travel form :\*
---
Stress test, if you are USA region and have active game time
---
You absolute lad, thanks
---
lfr is about on par with classic raids, so good fit for the sub really
---
I'm not saying for everyone, but at least for the biggest 1-3 groups of EU. 
---
If you are from poland and want to play on a realm with many germans. You can do it, because you chose it.
---
I tried AAP for the first time during this test and it was amazing.
---
Open stress test.
---
I agree with troll. I thought devouring plague looked great but it's just too costly. I would never use a 3 min cooldown that costs almost a thousand mana. But shadow guard is awesome. It can proc black out and shadow weaving, spell casts against you proc it too so it's still good against casters. And it's only 250 mana for almost 400 dmg. Btw the time you spend a thousand mana on it you will have done more dmg the dp and most likely proced a blackout
---
I think blizzard have never been to either Germany, France, Spain and Italy..
---
So many people in those countries dont even know how to speak English...

**Problems with layering as I see:**  
---
\- Unintended / "accidental" change of layers when accepting party invite  
---
\- Not seeing the same people as usual when changing layers  
---
\- Exploit with collectibles (mining nodes, etc)  
---
\- Exploit by getting away from attackers in world pvp (also falling into a group of enemies when changing layers)  
---
\- Reloging being able to change layers
---
**Possible solutions** (or partial solutions) **as I see:**  
---
\- No layering from lv20 onwards / no layering in any contested zones  
---
\- Making layering non-automatic, where you can change between numbered layers in an in-game dropdown menu (when in party, you would need to be able to see which layer each partymember was in, then you could agree in chat which to join up together)  
---
\--&gt; This would also need a cooldown (like 10m?) to severely limit the exploit with collectibles  
---
\- Layering only happening in certain locations, like big cities, or possibly uncontested zones
---
And in general (if it's still present in the current game), mid-combat layering should definitely stop. There should be a \~20-30 sec grace period after getting out of combat to make it possible to loot even chests (in the case of automatic layering), possibly with a buff-countdown or something indicating the time remaining before getting layered away, and the timer stopping and resetting if player is getting back into combat.
---
I'm not super eager for classic like most everyone else. I'm hoping by the time I get the itch to play, all the streamers will have grown bored and moved on.
---
&gt; it will a few weeks after launch
---
haha people still believe this
---
No, there's a distinction. It's called chatspeak.
---
I find woot and kappa equally annoying. One is called leetspeak (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/leetspeak) and one is called twitchspeak (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/twitchspeak). I find ingame memes to at least be relatively appropriate, even if still annoyingly immature (see [Dirge]).
---
Twitchspeak (and yes, leetspeak) are pretty much rock bottom as far as linguistics go.
---
Exactly. Thank You.
---
If Blizzard doesn't believe the german classic population to be big enough to warrant localized servers, there's a decent chance they won't do oceanic servers. That's not really apples and oranges, it's simply based on the assumption that Blizzard does EU shared servers because the population is too small.
---
This is becoming so dumb:
---
1. ALL other MMO games do more than fine with international servers. The english needed to communicate things in an MMO is very basic and it's filled with specific MMO terms anyway, plus it's not like you can't find a Spanish/Italian/German guild anyway. The only problem I can think of is if a community becomes too dominant in a certain server, but I think it can be managed.
---
2. ALL the people here complaining about this can EASILY speak/read english well enough to be part of an international community. The fact that you're on reddit arguing in english with people from UK, Spain, German, Italy, Sweden, etc... for me is more than enough to prove that servers will be fine. Yes, not everyone who will play classic is on reddit or other forums, I know, but still..
---
Ah ok. So it’s just freaking italians who are going to piss me off. Thanks for the info
---
Dude as a warlock, you will easily get accepted. Sure their damage early progression is not the best but it best way better. Your utilities help a lot to.
---
i havent seen it below 200 for perth but im confident blizz will split the servers up like they did in overwatch
---
Hit% is the most valuable thing until you cap.
---
If your a caster your cap in PvE is 16%, but in PvP it's 3%, so everything above 3% is completely wasted in PvP.
---
Same goes for physical attacks, the PvE cap is much higer so in order to be good in PvE you need to have hit on your gear that is completely useless in PvP after a certain point.
---
Stamina is much more valuable in PvP (obviously tanks need it in PvE too).
---
I see this is your first time witnessing Blizzard Beta. But worry not, it will all be fixed for sure.
---
Okay first of all League of Legends is like the biggest esport (maybe not anymore but still) and it was the buggiest mess for the longest time. Dota 2 is better, but still has a ton of bugs. Bugs happen regardless of esports.  
---
The dungeons are designed to be speedrun with optimized routes. They are incredibly linear and have no optional content in them. Look at Sunken Temple/Blackrock Depths, now those are dungeons created as actual dungeons, without any modern nonsense in mind.  
---
Lastly I dont really care about your fancy strats, but you go on to say that it doesnt influence how people play at all.. after literally just explaining how it influences how you play? uhh.. bruh.
---
Thanks that sounds good
---
Here's my full opinion on what I would probably do to change up the chart a bit.  Your idea of making a ranking chart is a good one, I just think it needs a little refinement.
---
Your profession and race column values are swapped(minor fix).
---
Is Subj Play your overall interest in playing that combo?  I guess you pretty much were interested in everything except maybe Tauren druid based on the chart.
---
Your demand rankings are pretty odd in my opinion - I've played as DPS for the last 4 expansions I played, and the one thing that stands out is that there's always more demand for Tanks first, then healers, then there's a sea of DPS.  I'd rank Warrior, paladin, and druid as a little higher because of this, 4's on tanks, 3's on healers, 2's on DPS.  If it's for raiding, then this may not actually matter too much, since every class gets slots in a raid usually.
---
I'm not sure what you mean by DPS/HPS, as these are completely different metrics.  As I view it, this is already covered by the 'demand' section.  Unless you're looking exclusively at DPS capability on just DPS classes, which is a good reason to select one DPS class over the others, in which case it's Warrior&gt;Rogue&gt;Mage&gt;Hunter&gt;Warlock&gt;Shaman -&gt; this will be offset by utility, as a well equipped fury warrior may be more DPS, but there's no aggro dropping mechanics on that class (I guess this is covered in utility).
---
Utility -&gt; solid category here.  Though this is a bit subjective as I think every class has a bit of it's own utility in Classic.
---
TBC viable -&gt; this is where I would probably have introduced weighted totals.  TBC is years away if it even comes for classic, so I would probably just not include this on a scoring chart.
---
QOL -&gt; another solid category, though definitely subjective.
---
PVP -&gt; great category, definitely defining for why you would choose as you chose.
---
Class far -&gt; not sure what this is.
---
Gear Styling -&gt; As far as I can see, you are a gloriously rainbow outfitted character until you get your tier sets from raiding.  This being said, how you feel in tier 1, 2, 3, etc is definitely important.  I think most of the vanilla warrior sets are the best looking stuff in the game even in current expansion. I'm biased b/c of my vanilla tanking experience though.
---
What I would maybe suggest would be the following as categories and their weights:
---
Interest level (value 1.0)
---
Demand level (value 1.0)
---
DPS/HPS ranking (value .5)
---
Group utility (value .8)
---
PVP viability (value 1.0)
---
Solo QOL (value .8)
---
Endgame style points (value .4)
---
Overall score (multiply each category by it's weight and add together for total score)

It may be more likely to be in singapore. Can serve AU + SEA
---
Yes, I remember playing on a server in my own country and had like 15ms. It was sweet.
---
&gt; the official /r/classicwow circle-jerk sub
---
wait I thought that was this one, I am confused
---
There won't be language servers this time?
---
When Nost was up, and after I had joined and leveled my little priest -- I found myself with Norwegians, Germans, Americans, and even Koreans -- who could not speak my language, but \*could\* motion for me to follow them so that I could heal their group doing the elite quests.  
---
Needless to say, being in a game and being able to assist / help someone of another country without speaking was awesome.  Dungeons were a blast, with a point, a jump and then pull.  
---
I learned a little bit of German, a little bit of Spanish, and a whole lot of "New WoW speak" -- considering all of the abbreviations and new words created from this game that have found it's way into the gaming language and in everyday use.  WTF, WTB, LFG, DM, UBRS, n00b, KEK, etc., etc., bring back many, many smiles.  And we all learn them and understand / laugh with their use.
---
Playing with EU's taught me new ways of raiding, new ways of completing instances, new shortcuts, etc., that the Americans on five servers never did.  Who knew Princess could be backed into a corner and held there for ease of the boss kill?  Who knew you could jump up the wall in Zul'Farrak if the goblin accidentally died before opening the gate?  For awhile, all of the instances seemed new again, you were seeing tactics with a different eye.
---
And we did it with immersion of the game, but without full communication.   It reminded me of WoW before Discord, before Vent, before private channels.
---
Meld the servers, and let's all learn.
---
AAP?
---
Well one is a official repeated info my blizzard the other one is literally made up .. just because a lot of ppl repeat it doesnt make it true you know?
---
Like there is a lot of stupid people in the world.. A LOT
---
damn im really worried about this now...
---
Well if "willful ignorance" is your argument for not knowing a foreign language, I don't think I will be able to change your mind. I am just trying to explain why people are so mad/sad about this. Thanks anyways for the discussion.
---
I think the big German guilds have already started co-operating on this. No word on the French or Spanish though. Hopefully too they get on it too and announce where they'll go in a reasonable time when the realms are announced.
---

Look, it's simple - it's not just "Germany wants 1 server!!!". If blizzard gave you 1 server they'd have to give you 3. pve, pvp, and RP (otherwise you'd complain about that too). Even if we take your woefully inaccurate website statistics as gospel that means English servers would need x4 those servers (12). But your other post where you pulled the number of servers seemingly out of your ass directly contradicts this so you clearly have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Blizzard are clearly confident that there aren't going to be enough German players (as they have the actual, accurate statistics on how many German players there are) to fill 3 servers so you're not getting your own servers. Simple.
---
If Germany doesnt get its on server I really lost interessts in playing... It itsnt classic to me if I cant play on a german server.
---
The first server I played on (stress test 4) felt really fast. No one was even bothering grouping for Sarkoth because a) the population on my layer was very low and b) it'd respawn every 20 seconds or so.
---
Once they closed the servers and I joined 15 the spawns felt a lot slower, with a much higher population.
---
I think they intended for all of the servers to have different spawn/layering systems and then poll the players to see which was the most preferred, but they didn't get enough players. They required a sub for a stress test, held it during a week day, and made it NA only, so I'm not sure what they were expecting.
---
I don't know.
---
Again, judging by private server the population typically drops from 10k to ~8k. So around 20%?
---
&gt; but why hate for people trying to get involved in a server community event?
---
I think people that played wow in its prime dont understand watching someone else play compared to playing themselves, me included. Twitch as a concept makes 0 sense to me.
---
Yeah and 90% of the french pple cant even speak english. Gonna be fun to here Baguettetalks all the Time..
---
I dislike how Blink feels as a tool in getting around at lower levels. It's off cd quite often, it doesn't cause mana issues. Ends up feeling like a chore. 
---
Also dislike how often you drink, though my favourite classes are druid and priest so maybe I'm biased. 
---
Love the teleport and general power you feel killing most things with ease.
---
Just because you don’t want to speak english, doesn’t mean Blizzard has to make a server for you. 
---
I started playing when I barely knew any english at 8 years old and had no problem communicating, I don’t get all the whining from grown men.

---
Azeroth auto pilot.
---
For me it was cool in retail to make friends from different countries, dont know why you want to play with people only from your country
---
Fuck yeah !
---
Ditto as a priest or lock if you fear them in that area and they fall off.
---
So well worth it, peeking over the edge knowing that they are shocked and then angry.
---
the only people who defend layering are those who complain that they won't be able to kill mobs on day 1 :D They don't have the foresight of being able to see the effect it has on the health of the game, both from a direct gameplay standpoint and an economical one.
---
No this isnt the argument at all lol, one is purposeful harassment, the thing you posted is a accident... There are limited ignore slots, and a lot of griefing can happen outside of whispers lol...
---
/u/daj-bara from what I've seen you comment on this post, your english is perfectly fine, In fact it's overqualified for WoW.
---
oh great!, do you know by any chance when the reamls are going to be announced ?
---
So your english is not "very good" afterall.  
---
Why not take this chance and improve it. Youll need it one day.  
---
Online gaming consists mostly of international communities, I don't see why it shouldn't work with WoW.
---
All private servers are international and there's no problem of not having people to play and communicate with. And the reason why it's not a problem is that people know the game. I constantly grouped up with Chinese and Russian speaking people for group quests/dungeons and didn't have any problem understanding what my task was. Once I even participated in a Molten Core Pug raid formed by Russian speaking guild. 
---
 If You have even a little of WoW experience, a language barrier shouldn't be a problem.
---
It was good when the lava ticked off damage to their armor.  IN fact, it was the best.  Many would have to go and repair (old, old days) before being able to head back into the instance / raid.
---
I'm a statistic. Made it to 47 on a private server then quit.
---
Only because I confirmed I was completely in for classic and needed to scratch the itch.
---
There won't be caps in phase 2. Blizzard only said to remove layering then but there is no word about any server caps.
---
Eventually realm population will go down due to players quitting but this is exactly why there's layering in the first place. Instead of having more servers at launch to spread the players evenly we will have fewer severs with as many layers as required, so we don't end up with multiple multiple low pop realms.
---
Layering's intention is to prevent server merges down the road.
---
I used to play on an unofficial Czech/Slovakian server, and I wouldn't want repeat that even if we got an official one. The lack of mandatory English resulted in the server being overrun by kids.
---
this is some pure raw fucking cringe right there. Imagine drooling this much over someone playing a game instead of playing it yourself.
---
Large camp grounds?
---
Up until yesterday I expected there to be five for Germany alone. But five for the whole of Europe? If that’s gonna be the case I want some of the stuff Blizz is smoking
---
Can confirm. Me and my pacany are going to roll on some EU server. Russian Classic client (breaking news btw) is not authentic and not fun for anyone.
---
Also, most Russians are WotLK and TBC kids anyway.
---
If you really played private servers you would know that it never was a problem to host hundreds of different cultures and languages on the same server, there were no 'enclaves' and most people got along fine. Maybe you just played servers with very low pop where you never encounter anyone anyways?
---
He isn't ;)
---
At the latest 2 weeks before launch. Might be a bit earlier than that but.. I kinda doubt it.
---
Because 90% of people who hit max dont raid mythic, and a large amount of those who do raid mythic are pathetic loot whiners as you can see above.
---
The WoW players that are left are either high end mythic raiders and enjoy the challange of that, but they are slowly leaving because of stupid changes like no ML, or stupid fake gamer collectors who cry about not getting a pet for their blizzcon ticket or people who want to mindlessly mash buttons and get meaningless rewards for it, they are not MMORPG players at all so they shouldn't be interested in classic in the first place.
---
&gt; Merge any existing servers that lost too many players due to moving to non-English realms.
---
You think this is a positive? Holy shit, classic is DoA.

Stress test only has 12 hrs left BTW.
---
It isnt the same classic feeling when you suddenly play the game with english speaking everywhere than german. It sucks.
---
Yeah SG is actually an insane spell when you think about it. Really speeds up the leveling process as well
---
UNPOPULAR OPINION BUT WOW WOZ THA BEST GAEM EVARRRRRRR!!!
---
He's most definitely daft.
---
And the Spanish? Dun Modr in retail is one of the most populated servers in EU ffs
---
Lmao, how?
---
Stream man bad.
---
Comparing a meaningless stress test to the actual release. Anything to push your agenda I suppose.
---
Everyone who watches this will now roll a shaman when Classic releases.
---
I have met multiple Russians from the first group.
---
So he is not the only one.
---
I watched a react video, he was explaining how a guy in his guild got harassed by his crowd until he quit the game all together... "Asmon goes it was a shame, don't get me wrong it was funny, but it was a shame that we had to find a new guy and try and replace the dude." Not a single drop of empathy in that "man."
---
We Finns really are one specially retarded breed when it comes to online behavior. I would never ever join a Finnish guild.
---
why can't they just make unique names across regions, no limiations later on with mergers
---
Or maybe you can speak english and get along with other english speaking guys
---
Where are you getting this "3k" number from lol. There are private servers with 10k concurrent players and they are completely fine. 3k is low as fuck for a server
---
Yep, no specific servers will entail the creation of guettos and most Spanish/French/German people will massively move to X server, making it the unofficial SP/FR/GER server, destroying the progression of those who don't speak that language.
---
French, Ok. But what's wrong with germans? We can offer an infinite amount of beer. On top of that we have the most adorable accent. Join the dark side!
---
I mean it goes without saying healers and tanks are in more of a demand so groups will be easier to find rolling one of them.
---
I think regardless of what you play as long as your a good person and play your class well you will have no problem, plus who can say no to a lock port to the dungeon xD
---
The Murloc Costume was given out at BlizzCon 2007 - I slightly doubt you had that in Vanilla. It wasn't even in the game files until 2.1.3.
---
Fact is world chat will be toxic, french and UK players will use the N\*\*i word each time a german speak in german and the whole world will talk about monkey surrendering white flag when a french will speak in french.
---
People are just retard and ignorant, and blizzard is gonna have to deal with all the racism (joke or not) more than they would have to on national servers.
---
Them kids gonna get dabbed on my granny!
---
Come on Blizzard respect the Brexit vote, we don't want to play with continental europeans.
---
When you're in a world that got dominated by one language, either you work with the language and expand your horizon, or you stick to your bubble. No matter how big or small that bubble is.
---
My wife’s cousin who has 7 kids is telling me to get into classic as he is going all the way back into raiding. I asked him how he will balance it and he said,”I’m putting all my family time in now, cause when servers are up, I am gone.”
---
Yikes. That's pathetic.
---
10k server...lol...no.
---
I have been on private servers for years and I havent seen 1 regional with normal, healthy population over the last 4-5 years. Could you please show us one, since you stated, there are many
---
This is a nightmare. I am afraid it will be impossible to get back the same feel as the old vanilla with these sheep running around.
---
Imagine expecting people to be the same 15 years later.
---
are you stupid or are you stupid?
---
AKCHTUALLY, I don't think it's such a big problem. You can probably code the client to interpret item links in Cyrillic in chosen language, and the nickname... Well, can't you just transliterate it or make the player choose 2 nicknames (Cyrillic and Latin analogy?). 
---
I think they just don't want to spend time on it.
---
in classic base stats do not impact the power of your spells in any way. 
---
Intellect increases your mana pool, and your crit ( 59,5 intellect = 1% crit)
---
Spirit will only increase your health and mana regen outside the 5 second rule. If you\`re specced arcane meditation, you keep 15% of this mana regen while casting.
---
the variable starting stats of the different races have a  neglectible difference at lvl 60.
---
There will be an EU stress test in July.  So there’s nothing to worry about.
---
Just curious, how long will he stand there or does he just reset after a while?
---
&gt;when wandering around asking People for help with a quest, they maybe wont Unterstand me
---
This is probably the dumbest argument i have ever seen. You just made a thread IN ENGLISH about not liking the english speaking servers becouse you're worried about People who might not understand you? I think you'll be more than fine. Most people will speak English without a problem.
---
Time to learn esperanto !
---
 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto)
---
Jungle stew.
---
I found it from a site tracking classic addons: Will it Classic
---
It could also create problems with fixing a threshold. Like, let's say they make e FR and German server, PvP. Then people will start asking for a PvE FR and GR servers. Then people sill start asking for a Spanish/Italian server, etc... And while you could say "the community isn't big enough, you need at least X people", I guess it would still feel very unclear and arbitrary.
---
I think they're expecting a massive dip in playerbase after the initial hype - which 100% will happen (anyone arguing otherwise isn't worth hearing out), but likely not very fast.
---
Blizzard know better than anyone here how many people are forecast to play, and how long they are likely going to play for, but the ball is in their court. Tweaks need to happen to keep the game interesting- even adding things like Arena  into Vanilla would be uncontested by the community and feel amazing to play.
---
Likely the stress test
---
A lot of these "modern" sites are made to look good, not to function well.
---
The issue is not playing with people from other countries, it’s the fear of being isolated due to language differences. I could get by on a server with mostly Poles, Dutch, English or even Germans, but if I accidentally ended up on a majority Spanish server I’d understand no one. Can’t group up or join guilds then, as those people obviously prefer speaking their native language. The game would lose all fun to me.
---
When someone mentioned it I assumed it didnt proc off spells. But when I read it I was surprised. It sounds awesome against the major three classes mage,rogue,warrior. When it procs a blackout on a rogue after he opens you will never miss devouring plague
---
An easy fix is just to mandate English, like most of the decent pservers do.
---
Stream man bad in giant bold letters is all you needed to sum up this cesspool
---
No. Thats the people Who never experience vanilla talking.
---
Well now im remembering that we also had 1 russian guy who was all right
---
Except why are people against spell batching? I think it's a great mechanic for PvP.  Theres more depth to PvP if you can consistently counter CC with a CC, like gouging a death coil, plymorph intercept, etc. If the spell batching window is really big then I guess it could become too easy though.
---
Worst resignation ever. No clear written record of why you left. No listing of your accomplishments or high points during your tenure. Even if it wasn't amicable departure **it's polite to thank your employer**. You've left your employer open to say whatever the fuck they like about you.
---
Please elaborate oh how we can have different servers, yet have them be the same server. Its paradoxical and hurting my brain lol. I'm assuming you mean something similar to sharding but organizing by language instead of localized population.
---

im a english speaking dude but i remember in classic wow one of the top guilds on my server was called "je me souviens". they spoke french i think.

Enjoy they game just the way you like it, thats the beauty of vanilla!

---
If the game launches with this I’ll never buy another blizzard product
---
I actually speak german as well but that's not the question, indeed you don't understand the problem cuz as you say it wouldn't change anything since it's the same as a privage guild channel or anything else.  
---
I'm talking about the 2 first points of my post.   
---
Names won't be the same from client to client, let's say in french DeadMines is called Mortemines so you would say LFG MM instead of LFG DM.   
---
Or do you still need to loot x when other spells it y, if there's a single quest there shouldn't be a problem but if there are many.  
---
I can see a translation from the items linked being done directly via an addon but names in chat won't ever be possible especially since it would oblige everyone to spell every name perfectly otherwise no translation.
---
Hi dear, I know you will play this "World of Warcraft" game soon that you've been talking about. Here is a gtx 2080Ti, some lemonade and a coupons for free blowjobs when ever you want.

Not having servers for my country was one of the things that helped me tremendously with learning english. I started playing when I was 10 and couldnt string a couple of a words together, and by the time I was 12-13 I could already hold a conversation with someone in english. This is the internet, and its 2019, we need a common language for all of us to be able to communicate in, no matter what country you come from.
---
The thing is, Blizzard is expecting less than 100k Classic players in the EU. Which is DUMB, I know, but this is what THEY, Blizzard, expects.
---
How I got to this conclusion? 
---
Simple : around 18% of the players in the EU are German speaking (Germany and Austria represent 18% of the EU pop). Blizzard considers that there is not enough German speaking players to fill up a Classic WoW realm.
---
A Classic WoW realm will be Vanilla-like, in terms of population, which means around 3k concurrent players and around 12k total players.
---
So Blizzard believes that LESS than 12k players in EU will be German speaking players, hence, they don't need to have their realm.
---
18% is about 1/5th, which mean that Blizzard expects to have 5 or 6 realms for the EU. And that means between 60k and 70k players in the EU, on 5 or 6 realms.
---
Even if the realm pop will be slightly higher (let's say 3,500 concurrent and 14k total, per realm) , that still doesn't go over 100k players (6 realms x 14k players = 84k players).
---
I hope that Blizzard will wake up after August 13th, when the name reserve option starts, and see that there are WAY FUCKING more than 80k people in the EU that will reserve names on Classic realms, because not having language based realms for German, French, Spanish and Italian is an UTTERLY STUPID IDEA.
---
Didnt think germans would need it, thought they were better in english than the french
---
Or you deserve to be cykablyat upon.
---
did you guys not learn english in school\*
---
Play the way you enjoy it!
---
Unless its fast to 60 , then you are a dirty retailer.
---
There is indeed a post saying it's not working as intended all the time and they are working heavily to fix it
---
Sorry I'm also not going to find that for you
---
Mage or warrior. Mage water is awesome. Warrior is the classic combo, no one will be able to kill you
---
Good idea, large camps where people can concentrate on their dialect or language.
---
We could call them "concentration camps" so it's easy to understand
---
I never reached 60 on my pserver because the fear of losing my character again was too much.
---
On Classic, however, I do intend to work my way to the top just so I can sit in WSG and AV all day.
---
The good thing about youtube is that it usually suggests videos based on what you watched previously. So, obviously, if you consume said "content" then your page will be filled it.
---
Still, I fail to see how a "WoW streamer" reacting to other people's videos is good content. But, hey, some people eat literal shit, so to each their own.
---
&gt; And swedish people in groups tend to become very childish and Swescale was a prime example of this. 
---
Definetly not just a swedish thing. I think this is just an extension of how people act in public with strangers vs among friends and family. People just don't auto censor themselves that much.
---
It might benefit you but it does not benefit the \*majority\* of the EU playerbase. Thats why its a stupid decision. You get it?
---
You clearly haven't been in Germany ever. Unless you meet the most uneducated people, everyone speaks English. Admittedly, most not fluent, but enough to play together. Any private server proves me right.
---
And then they came around with multinational servers which nobody ever would have thought of.
---
It’s about the journey!
---
Hello Sir,
---
are you the real Ooga?
---
I explain exactly what immediately after that paragraph.
---
&gt;Prefering not to speak it, what does that even mean, people speak english when they can't use their native tounge, i doubt most people will have a problem with that in an online game.
---
It means preferring not to speak it. Lots of people of all nationalities do this, but I would postulate that the countries that typically get their own servers and localisations have proportionally more people who do. There are always guilds that only recruit speakers of specific languages, and lots of people join them because they prefer interacting in their native language. Language-specific servers are just the same thing on a bigger scale.
---
Honestly I will never use bag addons ever again. I used one from vanilla through wrath but when I came back in legion and had to download addons again, I never picked up a bag addon and can't imagine ever going back to one. Totally a preference thing. I prefer the default for the same reason people prefer the addon; it's just more organized for me this way.
---
It's a bit discouraging reading the number of posts not getting the overall picture. 
---
Especially here on /r/classicwow where any changes were received negatively yet this (massive) alteration seems to be downplayed by too many.
---
Totally feel you over here... It will be alright I guess since I have been playing english games all my life. But it will not be the same - which is very sad...
---
This was one of the things I never even thought about how Blizzard could screw it up - but apparently it is possible for them to do so..
---
Weird, you told me you didn't use reddit.
---
May not be that big of a deal, like having Chinese on Illidan horde.  You did sort of need an addon to block their language in order to not go crazy but once you had that it was good.
---
cocaine.
---
Almost like lfr loot is shit garbage and lfr itself is shit garbage content. 
---
Now seeing a mythic quality weapon or trinket off of either your weekly chest or that boss you just wiped 50 times to? That feels good.
---
The solution will require a certain finality to it this time.
---
i personally don´t have a problem with a mixed community where everybody agrees on speaking english, but i don´t think that this will be the case.
---
Your argument about not wanting to speak English is literally that you don't use it enough.
---
I'm no English native either but for some reason nobody here complains about learning English or having to speak it online. While German and French people seem to think they are entitled to the world adapting to them.
---
Bless you.
---
It can be hard to watch but he has pretty severe adhd clearly
---
I agree it sucks man but people out here saying its gonna ruin the game which is just ridiculous. If I had to choose between a group of no lifers being able to exploit layering to control rare resources and get ahead of everyone or not being able to play/quest because theres literally hundreds of people in the same zones, I'm choosing layering every time. My gameplay is far more negatively affected without layering than it is with it up to a certain point in time/levels when I overpopulation becomes a little less of an issue
---
Then I am going to call bullshit on that
---
Its completely delusional to compare private Servers with Blizzards Classic Launch imo. Minimum 15k concurrent Players peak per realm in Launch week imo
---
I would leave Layering in the starting zones and thats it. I think that would be enough. And even that would be turned off after couple of weeks.
---
&gt;  because you had luck at the wrong time and got a titanforged piece with the wrong stats for your spec 
---
Each to his own I guess. I'm like sweet an upgrade. I don't really target gear unless it's azerite. So that's probably why I can't relate to this TF/WF hate.
---
Am I wrong? So you want to tell me, they will open hungarian server?
---
Why don't we just declare X server is english, Y server is french, etc. ? Problem solved.
---
&gt;If you are unlucky and end up on a server where the lingua franca in general is something you don't understand, you can always opt for a paid transfer (assuming this option will be available for Classic).
---
Wow. Good to know if I accidentally pick the wrong server I just have to pay up to correct my mistake. Thanks.
---
I am trying out Azeroth Auto Pilot, not as good as Zygor but worth it to not use something people pay cash for.
---
Wouldnt 500k new subscribers be an insane cash grab?
---
&gt;you can do the same here at least for levelling/dungeons if you want to 
---
But even there you completely ignore trade, chatting, and interacting with literally anyone in your vicinity, which is essential to the community.
---
&gt;You're forced to speak english in any other MMO (I'm sure you don't speak german usually in CS:GO) so it's not too different. 
---
But you don't in an enclave! You can trade and interact with the hundred or so people in your guild, it's like a mini server, but you exclude the entire rest of the server and just make your server way smaller and shitter.
---
&gt;you're here on reddit speaking english with an italian guy and it's all going well
---
Yes, but not everyone is like that, and that's the issue. 
---
&gt;This kind of people are probably a very strong minority for WoW Classic. The WoW Classic community is mainly made of people who where in their teen/early 20s during Vanilla/TBC/WOTLK and are now late 20/30/40. It's a mature community overall. This doesn't mean that there are no kids and dumb people, but probably less than what you can find in a F2P FPS like CS:GO.
---
Having played on private servers, yes, people got older, but their attitude didnt change much. On my server, there's still multiple german, french and spanish guilds, and they barely do anything outside their guild.
---
&gt;From my experience (and I've played competitive games for the past 8 years) the higher the rank, the lower the people who can't speak/understand english and that meme people for their accents. When the game gets to a certain level the kids are left behind and the high-end community is always very international. I know this doesn't apply well to WoW, but I guess the main idea is the same, at lvl 60 the not-too-casual to full-hardcore players will have no trouble at all dealing with an international community.
---
But you're ignoring 80% of the game right there, not everyone is hardcore, not everyone raids all the rights, and you STILL have to communicate to do literally everything else other than the high end content in that community!
---
I'm just waiting for people to start breaking out the flow charts.
---
&gt;they make more servers
---
Have you been following Blizzard lately?
---
Layering is free. More servers are not.
---
Fewer locks=more gear=better gear faster=gets good
---
Don't forget about Spain too, 45 million population. In Retail WoW we have had more than 10 Spanish servers.
---
I'll put a different spin on this, and this coming from a 10 yr veteran of Eve Online where we are all one server. I'm in the largest groups there, with people who do speak multiple languages, and all of us play together. I'm talking a group of players in what you would consider one "guild" of over 11K players, who often "raid and pvp" another "guild" using 2K to 4K players at a time, all online, and on voice comms, and from different countries/nationalities. The only issues I've seen crop up is occasionally with someone needing to get someone's attention in Russian or Chinese, and usually there is someone who will cross-translate in our voice chat to tell those people (or usually someone specific) to so something. Most of the time, those groups of people if working with others, have their own person who translates.
---
But everyone else, from French to Germans to Polish, etc.. who play.. and those people who I have basically flown under (think them being a raid leader), while having an accent, I've understood them speaking English just fine. Some has been a bit rougher than others, but I've not found it to be an issue. In general in the video gaming world, Europeans playing games nearly all speak English well enough. In Eve, at the worst you see the typical accusations of either Chinese or Russian botting. 
---
What you don't see is what you guys are thinking of, namecalling or making fun of someone based on a nationality or something else. And this is in Eve, what most would deem a pretty harsh and sometimes toxic game, too hard core for many people. You will see people say to speak english in what amounts to "world defense" channels if someone says there is a group of enemies, yet all of it was in another language.
---
There will be some adjustment, and sure there will be a few bad apples out there who will make fun of anyone regardless of things. But for the most part I think people will end up learning to work together, or if there is a language issue, they will form guilds or discords to take care of that issue. If anything, perhaps the player base is able to work a mod to create a localized client mod that helps do what Blizzard won't, and doesn't break their TOS somehow. I know that's how they did things in Eve when they wouldn't bother creating keeping up the Russian client, for example. The players themselves did it themselves.

It’s pretty much any PC with a functioning power button at this point.  It’d be way harder to come across a working PC that didn’t  run WoW in 2019.
---
People defend layering, get to the back of the confusion line please.
---
He was doing a stream event.. not that crazy that people want to be part of it.
---
What are they gonna do? Fire him?
---
Of course. That makes perfect sense. Silly me.
---
No way. Not even close.
---
The main difference is that people that go out of their way to play and install a pserver already know they want to play it/stick with it.
---
Once it's available in the battle.net launcher though a huge amount of player will/might try it. People that will play for a couple of mins and go back to bfa
---
It's really good. It can be used both offensively and defensively and synergizes extremely well with the Shadow tree. It's basically a better version of lightning shield
---
They're spamming to group up instead of spamming the nword and other racist jokes, this isnt a real barrens chat!!!! Muh classic experience!!!!
---
How can't we? German and french are both top 1 and top 2 most spoken languages accross EU.
---
It's not that we don't want. I am fluent in english but it's not thanks to school. Our school system and our cultural policies are there to protect the French language. 80% of the French people don't speak/understand english, and the only one who does are the one working internationnaly or self taught people thanks to internet.
---
Every thing is dubbed, most word are translated. You are gonna get confused when people talk about Hurlevent instead of Stormwind, because yes blizzard France was so retard they even translated the city's name.
---
On this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j81TgG0p_HrYKajiUiQfYIoSUx1culzy2u_Fc4wtiS8/edit#gid=87065170) you'll find the best items per class and per slot, it's probably not 100% accurate to the classic version of the game but it's still pretty usefull
---
For me personally, different language servers in EU feels redundant. It carries with it long-terms risks that Blizzard would rather not take. Having French, German and Spanish servers, for example, would require them having each a PvP, PvE and RP variant. How many of those servers do you think would actually be popular? What do they do if the French RP Server is a barren wasteland with barely 100 people in it later down the line?   
---
It's a smarter move to wait and see how thing go at launch and then months after it and THEN make the commitment, once the numbers have stabilized and they know what number of DEDICATED players they are working with. As it stands right now, I don't think anybody can deny the fact that day 1 will be enormous, but you also can't deny that the drop-off in the weeks after will also be huge. Not everybody will want to play the game as it was 15 years ago, that much can be seen by the numbers of posts of people STILL asking for small QoL changes like achievements and so on.
---
You are right: while most of the young adults in 2019 speak english well enough to communicate basic ideas and concept, it's not like average european really have amazing vocabulary and master english up to a point that they can joke or express complex ideas flawlessly especially in voice chat.
---
(or at least it's not at all what I witnessed in Overwatch)
---
Where did this whole battle station thing come up? Last I heard it was "check out my set up" "check out my rig" battle station sounds so lame lol
---
I don't think you can use transfers in classic.
---
That's not true at all. On beta currently you can train any weapons bar polearms(20) before 10 providing you have the silver.
---
Imagine not knowing the context of this picture and still raging at asmon for this. It was on the stress test for an event where asmon was trying to get everyone on his layer for gurabashi. It won't ever be as aids as this when it's actually released.
---
So confused about your battleground issue.
---
Cross server and battlegroup bgs are the same thing. If your referring to same server bgs as a better option, your opinion will change very quickly sitting in 50min long ques to go against a premade and lose in a 3 min 5 cap AB.
---
For server cap issue, log in ques are a real thing and just something you deal with playing on a popular server.
---
After all this blizzard is trying to ruin it right before launch!  Unbelievable!
---
&gt; Cheese Eating Surrender Monkeys

Thats not the British but Americans.

Hallo SensitivePlankton,
---
danke für deinen Beitrag, wir Deutsche werden uns absprechen und einen Server auswählen. Wir organisieren uns schon, keine Bange. :)
---
Liebe Grüße,
---
Ein Deutscher
---
I’m receiving insults via private message. This sub is beyond toxicity sadly !
---
Damn I forgot how petty Kanye is 😂
---
Yes? And every private server has a massive population of Chinese and Russians who refuse to/dont know how to speak English.
---
It demonstrates its an actual real problem.
---
What we looking at?
---
Can someone ELI5 what is going on?
---
This.
---
It will happen so often, that most people will rather quit playing, instead rerolling on another realm.
---
Different alphabet. Explained in the blue post.
---
And debuff limit?
---
You can’t get a mob tag on just a regular servers population. What are you even going on about?
---
It’s almost like this technology was almost entirely recoded from the current sharding tech that they have on retail and that’s it’s probably got a bit of spaghetti in there, and why the beta exists hopefully is for shit like this to be seen and for blizzard to hopefully try and prevent situations like this with their technology. As far as the tech itself, this shit is going to be way better than having 6 hour long queues or having dead servers after a few weeks. Anyone who complains about server identity and community as an anti layering argument should consider that server merges are also immersion breaking and screw with server community the same way layering does.
---
Maybe you're not an insufferable jackass and learned english, but you are arrogant and you've certainly not learnt what tolerance and putting yourself in other people shoes means.
---
at least not perfectly :)
---
It's also less of a problem on the 1.12 client, because speaking a foreign language with a different alphabet such as Chinese will just mean the message doesnt show up in the chat.
---
So even though a bunch of players might be speaking chinese you wont see the majority of the messages. Too bad the 1.13 client actuallt support different alphabets so the spam will show up.
---
The biggest problem is not that e.g. Germans (as myself) can’t speak English. Actually, IIRC WoW is/was one of only a few online games where I was able to actually speak German. My whole online-gaming live was basically playing Warcraft III, CS, PUBG, DOTA2 and co. with internationals from all over Europe. BUT: I don’t look back at this time. Conversation and interaction with other European countries was predominantly harsh and insulting. I do admit that aforementioned games are notorious for their toxic community, but wouldn’t mixed servers in the case of WoW lead to the same toxicity? This is especially troubling for WoW, were communication and community feeling is very important.
---
A second big problem is that not being a native English speaker can become really exhausting in long gaming/raid sessions. It’s just not your mother tongue and thus people won’t put up with this. If I work an exhausting 9-5 job, have RL resonsibilities and co., why in God’s name would I increase the hassle in my free time and force myself speaking English? People inevitably will look for their fellow nationals and this will lead to isolated communities.
---
Y'all a bunch of whiners crying about this topic.
---
Who cares that there is a possibility you see other languages in the chat?
---
I don't remember this being a problem at all when i started playing in 2006.  
---
Just play and enjoy the game when it comes out.
---
The upvotes will decide which is in fact not a hard decision.
---
Reddit recommended me the transmogrification sub because it’s “similar” to classicwow
---
Nice thanks, i was thinking to do this so saves me the bother. When the realms come out out would be nice to have "unofficial" language servers in one place as well.
---
Ik kon hem ook downloaden, maar mijn account is EUW, dus kon er niks mee :)
---
Probably dumbest and most condescending comment I've seen this year! 
---
Congratulations!!
---
Imagine playing the game out of anger instead of enjoyment.
---
There’s nothing wrong with French or Germans. I just don’t want to be on a realm where English isn’t the main language. Just like many French and Germans don’t want to be on a realm where they have to speak English.
---
It was a stress test, not a chance for you to personally play 15 levels of Classic.
---
They have no possible way of knowing any certain numbers for launch day. The active sub-condition for beta access made sure of that. 
---
Even this subreddit alone has 141k subs, surveys have shown that EU/NA split is about 50/50, so for simplicity let's say 70k european subs. Even assuming that this is the final number of people playing at launch (which isn't realistic), nobody can tell me that there can't be at least 1 healthy realm per region. I don't know what number of travelers they are expecting, but it seems to be enormous for some reason.
---
There are dussins of countries that doesn't get their own server. Just read / speak English...
---
Open beta
---
That will inevitably happen, but it won't really manifest until later, and at that point, people with different language backgrounds will have leveled up toons on these realms.
---
Layering is for server load,  so the servers don't crash,  not mob respawning, you're looking at it wrong
---
oh my god pso2 is getting a western release!?
---
Because there is no way to reach the entire audience of the game to tell them that this server is Y language and once someone has levelled past 30 they won't want to re-roll
---
Its more likely, that servers will hold 6-9k people instead of 4
---
Feral is very viable for raid dps, IF you a willing to farm a lot before each raid. 
---
The best in slot weapon for the entire classic duration (yes, also better than Ateish), is Manual Crowd Pummeler from Gnomeregan, because of it's activateable with no cooldown. It only have 3 charges, so you need to farm a lot of those before the raid. Druids are unaffected by weapon DPS, so it is the stats that matter. Permanent 50% increased attack speed, is not beaten on any other weapon in the game.
---
The best in slot headpiece for the entire classic duration is Wolfshead Helm. This enables "powershifting", which again have a very consumeable requirement. You need to pop mana potions and dark runes / demonic runes, whenever possible, in order to gain the major dps from powershifting. You also need to be able to focus on powershifting on the best time before an energy tick, every time.
---
It's powerful to have two single best items from the get go, but it's also boring that you will never replace them.
---
If you don't want to farm this way for the BiS weapon and consumables - then no, feral dps is not viable.
---
Unless you play a Holy Reckoning type of build, stick with 1h+shield. You are sacrificing both bonus healing and 2-3000 armor so you can swing for slightly more damage in a gear set without any Str and attackpower.
---
Not really worth it other than for the class fantasy.
---
Condescending but truthful. Not speaking the global language of science/medicine/politics/trade/economy is really weird.
---
Everything you said is absolutely true, I've noticed in the main thread that really mocked Blizzard the mods came in very quickly to damage control as much as they possibly could. Many of the most important comments explaining why this is a fundamentally retarded decision have upped and vanished.
---
I've played on the Beta for the last 2 weeks. If I had not been told about layering, I wouldn't have even noticed it.
---
That happened to me when I chose a random FFXIV server...and it was French.
---
Been reading people ignorantly talking about layering as sharding for the past month that have no idea what they’re talking about and have jerk reactions to minor issues. I started off patiently explaining. Now I’m over it and in full on “you’re an idiot” mode. At this point, yeah I have no patience when some mongoloid puts words in my mouth and then insults me for it. Big brain plays
---
Elaborate? You are not making sense.
---
We could start making a list once the server names are released tho?
---
Not that everyone HAS to follow that list but it is sure helpful imo.
---
23% of population speaks English in Czechia for example and most of those not very good. Back in 2005, Czech, along w Slovaks had overun one of the PVP servers, making half of the pop and ruining experience for everyone else. It will happen again and multyply it for Poles, Hungarians and Romanians. If Blizz wont make language specific servers for main EU languages, the problem will grow exponencionally
---
You have to consider that there are other German speaking countries. Austria and switzerland just to name 2.
---
All 3 countries have a population of almost 100 million people.
---
Hello! May we find each other in classic and not tell each other where we are from!
---
Sure let me put myself in the shoes of a young french adult who refuses to learn the language of the world:
---
Hey, ignorance is pretty neat.
---
Don't you think the english names will come naturally by just playing?
---
Don't ya'll speak American?! Kkona
---
No reason to break the old tradition of conflict. At least it's friendly now.
---
Having a battle-group is better then all servers cross realm.
---
If we had, say, 5 server battle-groups that would keep queues low especially if there are some horde and some allianace dominated servers in the mix but still have a community feel to it.
---
It will happen and it IS happening as we speak. There's a german discord forming since this morning (https://discord.gg/dPV6TS) and a french one, which will coordinate with the german one as well. It'll be a cluster of national discords coordinating very soon.
---
I mean, it's easy for streamers because they have fans who follow them around in game and notice they can't see the streamer, so they can invite them to their layer. If you're a normal player, how the fuck are you supposed to find someone to invite you to a different layer? Especially considering general chat is supposed to be layer specific.
---
April 2020
---
TBF on my 3ish years of pservers ive only ever been ninja's by asian players.
---
Or you know, they are waiting to see how many people they actually get EU side before spending more money on servers. Is it really that hard not to freak out about this stuff and bash blizzard ( I know it's the norm around here) till actually see the how the populations are? I mean shit we have too many retail servers as is now because of this kind of knee jerk when the population was higher.
---
OP är en riktigt luffare, haha! 
---
Vilken är din favoritmjölk?
---
source: dude trust me lmao
---
This sucks massive ass.
---
Undead is objectively the best race in the game.
---
Oh lol, this was about PvP. Welp, I hope someone else could use the information \^\_\^
---
Its on par with the N-word supprisd it hasent been removed yet..
---
The problem is German and French regions always get localisations and rarely use English day to day. It was a big issue before we had region servers.
---
The isse isn't even that much about the language. The entire point of vanilla WoW and the reason IMHO it's actually better than retail is the community and the guilds which heavily depend on geographical location and shared language. I'm not going to organize an IRL meetup woth a bunch of Norvegians and Spaniards speaking broken English. Half of the reason vanilal was so great was because at least a good fourth of your guild turned out to be literally a short drive away, you could spend the entire evening chatting in your natural mother tongue doing random stuff and every once i a whole you organized a meetup for the entire guild.
---
Ah I see. Well honestly it is similar cause it has to do with world of Warcraft. I see the same thing every day.
---
Hell, as a German myself, you would have to pay me to play with the german client, german server or not.
---
Everyone in Europe speak English and can communicate in PUGs. Let them create national guilds if they want. No need for localized servers on this side of the pond.
---
The one time I’m happy to be an Australian player ha. Although there better be oceanic servers actually in Australia or there will really be riots...
---
I leveled a warrior to 15 I was fine handling 3-4 mobs til I got to the defias then it was 2 with 3 being crit dependant. The thing I noticed was rage was generated much more reliably than pserver. I was ok with that
---
Wouldn't this be a GOOD thing?  Keep all of them on one layer away from the rest of us?
---
\#EVERYTHING
---
Works fine for me
---
Leader: LF Healer BRD
---
Me: I'll heal
---
*Leader invites you to join a group*
---
Leader: Ita?
---
Me: No.
---
*You have been removed from the group*
---
This hapened to me *many* times on Crushridge, the unofficial Italian server.
---
Except the dungeons you give as examples are from vanilla. The entire thought-structure behind designing in vanilla is different then the one in BfA, esports is not even playing a role here. Look at legion's dungeons. They were not designed for esports but would you compare them to the ones you linked? 
---
I agree with the poster above you however, I have never once in my life (Except in League of Legends) had any troubles with esports or streamers influencing my games. 
---
Also, do you still count the dungeons you gave as examples now? 
---
Vanilla Sunken Temple and current sunken temple are completely different. I can guarantee you that the majority of players that currently casually play BfA are not even interested in running the old temple or blackrock. Imagine going in there with the mindset (30 minutes max and i'm done) lol.
---
I don't think greens were ever gaurenteed in chests
---
Half of the threads are getting locked which isn't helping.
---
&gt; one is purposeful harassment
---
Tell me how streamers harass you. Oh wait, they don't because otherwise they'd lose their fucking job.
---
&gt; the thing you posted is a accident
---
I've been on quite a few music festivals in my life and I can tell you that at least half of the 'accidents' weren't really accidents but people being malicious or zealous. I wouldn't call lurking around parked cars with sharp objects an accident. Hell, I've been on 2 festivals where someone straight up set some car on fire just for 'fun'.
---
&gt;There are limited ignore slots, and a lot of griefing can happen outside of whispers lol...
---
Clear ignore list when it's full, whats the big deal? Do you keep trash in your house until someone else takes it out aswell? An what are other things that you can't just straight up ignore or deal with?
---
It‘s not only about being able to speak English. I‘m German and I have always played on an English client, but when I imagine being on an European server instead of a German one, it takes away a lot of the immersion. I just don‘t want to deal with the issue of asking people „German or English?“ over and over when looking for groups. Walking up to a player and knowing which language he speaks is worth a lot.
---
And having German/French/Spanish/Italian only guilds will just fuck up the whole realm in my opinion.
---
What about straight anal sex?
---
Exactly. Now the only question is, do you play the gawky Male troll or the superior female troll?
---
Engineering.
---
No changes
---
Oh come on guys I d rather have conversations with people from different countries and make international connections. You are killing classics spirit by saying that you dont want to play with particular population of earth. Its not like they put eu with China who refuse to speak english. 
---
Yeah, they ll be french, german and spanish people around but if they talk with you or join your group they ll talk english. It actually makes way more interesting interactions, you get to learn some of their words, you can speak with them about how people in different country live etc. 
---
Classic was about meeting interesting people and socializing and now people want to sit in boxes only with thousands of others who share same mentality and were grew up same way? 
---
People played pirate servers with half population of chinese and enjoyed it, there were nation specific and international guilds and it had very interesting environment to play.
---
I think it's absolutely that. Classic is the door opener, when you're bored you hop on to retail to see what's up instead of leveling an alt. With a little luck you like it and voilà, long term subscriber won.
---
If you again don't like the way retail patches go you go back to Classic - they can't really go wrong haha.
---
I remember back in WOTLK there was a Swedish guild on my realm that wouldn't play with anyone else but Swedish people, they also made PUGs for Ulduar when they couldn't get the numbers and if an item dropped they would just straight ninja it, if a guildie got outrolled the item would still go to the guild player and if you tried to argue the case you would get kicked from the raid.
---
&gt; even adding things like Arena into Vanilla would be uncontested by the community
---
You honestly think any change is ever going to go uncontested by the community?
---
&gt;Like there is a lot of stupid people in the world.. A LOT
---
Indeed. Cant believe how many gullible idiots believe Blizzard when they say Layering will be completely gone after a few weeks.
---
They just spent a ton of development time on layering, doing tests and adjustments, and then they will just remove it a few weeks in? Give me a break.
---
The layering is there to prevent population bottlenecks in areas until the initial hype dies down and the population declines. What happens if the population does not decline enough? Say servers are designed for 4000 players. 12000 players start playing, and the server has 3 layers.
---
At phase 2, only 3000 players have quit the game. What happens then?
---
Have fun running the game at 4 fps.
---
It's not but that's okay. Was acctually tested on the beta with healer hots and tank face pull
---
I do not think server only BG's are a viable option. I might overthink the cross server BGs, but it highly depends on the amount of servers they decide to support. If there are only 10 servers, it's indeed the same. But if they launch for example 20+ servers, I think battlegroups would be the supperior solution  to preserver a community feeling, rather than mixing players from all servers.  
---
The point is I do not want the retail situation, where you will never ever see the players you meet in BGs see again. A solution in between short queues and having a community would be battlegroups.
---
&gt;Layering is free. More servers are not.
---
How is that?
---
I see Ironing and cable management are not your strong points :D
---
You cant compare german language to small countrys....
---
Man, Vanilla was all about doing shit whatever you want, with whoever you want.
---
I was a hardcore raider myself in TBC and Wotlk, and yes people will look whatever is the best.
---
But every single class will be used for everything. If u going for retri paladin u will get invites to groups. Even if it is unusual. Maybe warlocks are doing 75% of the dmg a warrior can do at lvl 60. But nobody except those hardcore raiders will care.
---
And to even make points against that, Yesterday night I was checking in a guild doing Naxxramas on private servers, even with numbers tweaked like 10% harder and more stats and harder stuff, .that  hardcore raiding guild was like rolling through the raid in 3.5 hour. 
---
Back in those days, alot of people didn't know what to do, didn't how to make the best out of the character, and alot of people had slow computers/internet.
---
you will do fine
---
I don't want to miss out on playing with the swedes tho, they're usually really very good
---
Man i remember when Ion uploaded his Amani war bear speedrun video back in BC during the hay day of elitist jerks, people used to not hate on him all the damn time back then, good times.
---
Removing this post because of the toxicity of this sub which cannot even have a proper discussion.
---
Bravo!
---
Lol thats funny, i have never before seen such... oh wait. I did. Like 50 times-\_-
---
Yep this is the reason.  It just lowers their risk by a lot of having empty servers.
---
Inb4 Oceanic servers are in Shanghai :D
---
O O G A 
---
Sign me up
---
I think the drop off is mostly about week 1 tourists who level to 20 then quit, most of them BFA players coming to check out the game. It seems perfectly reasonable to expect there to be enough of these that a server which has 10-10k concurrent players across multiple layers will have 3-5k players 2 months later.
---
I'd never fought that I fight side by side with a French.
---
Forgive me if I'm wrong but isn't the artisian trainer in uldaman?
---
I'm 36 and doing the same. Every day, I scour YouTube &amp; Reddit for more Classic information. I play the Beta when I have time for that as well.  
---
For me, it is the "last hurrah" before having children and not being able to focus on a game this much, again. It's the last time, I'll get to experience that rush I got back in the day when Vanilla released :)
---
This is ridiculous. Everyone on this subreddit was defending to death layering. Somehow we had to trust blizzard with it(lol). And now that they are a few video showing/explaining why this is shit(Which should be obvious to everyone that played the game), people are starting to complain.
---
That itself is really weird, tbh. How the french government insists on trying to make French some type of global language. They already lost to the U.S a long time ago. French isn't even in the top 10 most spoken languages.
---
No problem with them loving their language, but to be arrogant enough to refuse to learn the language of the world? That's real ignorant.
---
r/coaxedintoasnafu
---
Chinese and spanish have way more native speakers than english, but for some reason people tend to think that english is the more spoken because "murica hurr durr the capital of the world".  
---
So if you want to exclude mandarin chinese because is an eastern language, I dont know why we educated folks of the west wouldnt agree to learn fucking spanish for the sake of comunicating with each others.
---
Palatina: Yes, please.
---
Current bfa players would run screaming at the idea of old dungeons :) yet they were amazing.
---
WoW and real countries are a huge difference. I personally would love for europe to work way closer togethe, I wouldnt mind a fully european nation, it almost works like that already!
---
But Europe is divided into geographical locations, which means you are naturally in places where people speak the same language around you, even in multilingual countries like switzerland, austria and belgium. In WoW there are barely any locations, just a ping difference. So you throw all languages in the same place.
---
Also, languages take time to develop and change, countries need time to change. WoW does all of that instantly.
---
Never said I stayed in the starting zone
---
They believe that they won't.
---
Blizzard is TOTALLY UNPREPARED.
---
It's true for dungeon names, but it is going to be tedious if you play with the french client.  
---
For mobs name or quest items during leveling it won't happen though since you won't have the repetition (still talking about french client obviously).  
---
So they kinda force you to play with the english client if you want to be able to integrate well but then if you join a 'whatever you language is' guild you'll be the black sheep with names different than others and you'll have to translate back :/.  
---
Btw I'm not saying it's gonna make the game unplayable at least not for me who's fluent in english but for some other people who aren't this is gonna be extremely difficult.
---
Problem is English is not the most spoken languages in EU. German and French are both more spoken in term of sheer number.
---

---
But they did though. They said there would be sharding for the start zones.
---
Then they rebranded sharding as layering (Lets be real, its the same fucking system only continent wide instead of sub zones) and told us it would only last until P2.
---
fuck no. no. no. no!
---
I hated the theme of Pandas too, especially before the expac, but during and especially afterwards I love the pre SoO vale, the rolling fields you get, the dense jungle. So many visually and aesthetically appealing settings.
---
Thanks for the link mate, that'll be helpful.
---
I'm just afraid not everyone is going to have access to these servers because they might not be fully aware, and some people are still going to be buttfucked at the end.
---
Layering means that one Dwarf Palibro who had your back that time in STV so you grouped and quested together all night could be getting murdered right in front of you by the Horde in Arathi Highlands and you would never even know because your server doesn't have just one Arathi Highlands and you're on different versions of it.  
---
The people are what makes a server, not the locations or the amount of mobs for a quest.
---
The amount of people not seeing the overall problem this brings with it, all while the classic release in 2004 did have separate realms, is way to high.
---
It's really disheartening to see but it's a problem many people not living a multilingual life simple do not get the same way. 
---
This is a heavy social game, splitting the community by language on the same realm is literally the opposite to that. "No changes" my ass, this is an enormous change to WoW and how 90% of it's players experienced it in 2004/5/6.
---
Good thing there is an ignore feature. No one else remember gold sellers spamming trade?
---
Good old days of vanilla. Genjuros was the greek server, crushridge the Italian server, burning legion the Turkish server.
---
I have no interest to improve my english skills because it is absolutely enough for me personally. It may works for Mobas and Shooters but not for community and speech heavy MMOs
---
Yeah, it shares this common theme with Blizzard's insistence on layering: They are not willing to use a significant amount of server space at launch, because they expect the population to completely crumble two weeks or so into release.
---
This is exactly what happened in vanilla. 'Spainbreaker' was the biggest example. Before server transfers this was a horrible experience for English speakers there. Spanish became the main spoken langu7and anyone who didn't speak it was pushed out and excluded.
---
Dungeons are not designed with esports in mind.
---
They are simply designed with Mythic+ in mind. If there were dungeons that constantly take longer to do a M+ run for, people would avoid it for M+. So all the dungeons are about the same length with only small variations in times which does not leave that much room for any kind of special encounter.
---
Mythic+ just turned into an esport as well.
---
They should really just reduce the number of M+ dungeons and release expansions with more "Mythic only" dungeons like Operation Mechagon will be.
---
I think many agree on this, but as far as I understand it's not possible. Like, for how layering works, it is applied to the whole continent.
---
It's a good idea, still, some people won't be aware of that list and run into problems down the line. 
---
It's the best solution we have, but it's sad the community has to go all grassroots in order to play the way they want to.
---
&gt; I've always assumed the rest of the EU were also trained in English early on
---
Yes and no. As surprising as it might appear, English is only the 4th most spoken language in Europe (behind Russian, then German, and then French). 
---
I can probably explain the need for French servers. French servers will have people not only from France, but also from Belgium, Switzerland, Holland and even Canada. The same logic applies to German.
---
Another point that is almost not pointed out by anyone in this thread: some people are just not willing to open up to other languages, and want to play with people from the same culture. I'm French myself, and while i have no issues speaking English, i'd rather play in a purely French server, just because of the fact that at some point, i could meet up my mates IRL, and because we share the same culture.
---
While people might argue that on private servers, you had no choice yadaydada, the context is different - you had 1 server, and you had to deal with it, period. Here, we'll have a LOT more people and an increased need of servers, so i don't see why Blizzard wouldn't release language-specific servers as we always had on Retail.
---
But people won't sub until the 13th when character creation opens, and that requires the realms to already to there.
---
&gt;It becomes a congested mess and it takes hours for people to actually get in to the stadium. It takes so long that a lot of people just don't even bother going. Soured by their experience, they never come back.
---
I guess they never liked the sport to begin with then? Why would you want someone who doesnt like football in the football stadium?
---
Worl Wide 137,5 milllion ppl speak german. Its the most common first or second language in europe in Total.
---
they actually added eyebrows to make him more sympathetic and show more emotion (human like)
---
Yeah, because times change. Get used to it, we're not living in 2004 anymore.
---
Well you can always Ignore People that don't speak a language you like. 
---
The exact same Problem would occur either way for every language that is not French or German. French and German Servers were a Thing. You perfect examples of Hungarian, Slavic and maybe some turkish flavor (xD) would have all been on the same Servers anyway. So where is the Problem?
---
Your examples were just as rubbish as OP's thats pretty much all I wanted to tell your sherlock :3
---
Blizzard has announced that there will only be English servers. People are freaking out because after a month of playing they’ll discover that their chosen server has become the unofficial &lt;random country&gt; server which in turn could cause issues when interacting with other players. Also, since most people are biased and have preconceived ideas they’ll start insulting other nationalities i.e. baguette, na**i, gypsy and so on. It’ll be a total shitstorm!
---
Because both chinese and spanish are outside of the western world. The only spanish speaking country inside of the western world is Spain, and their population is pretty average in Europe.
---
Chinese = Southeast Asia. 
---
Spanish = South America.
---
Maybe they didn't think about this until very late in development and now they don't have time to hire and train someone who has the skills, experience and work permit to get the job done before launch.
---
We are so many foaming at the mouth gated-out by the closed beta and shit.  
---
Like how can they speculate about having low numbers before any meaningful scaled test is conducted.  
---
Not like it would be hard to backpedal and merge some servers afterwards if less player than expected turn up. It's better than having continent wide servers "just in case".
---
I'm exactly the same as you, I'm not discrediting the effectiveness of that strategy, but it's not the role of Blizzard to enforce who should and should not learn which language. If people are interested in playing on the English server, they were always able to no matter where they're from, this change is only removing player options. The fact that it helped you and me doesn't mean we get to deny people who want to communicate in their mother tongue their right to do that. 
---
On top of the fact that plenty of people are perfectly capable of speaking English, they just feel it hinders communication. There's clearly going to be enough of a playerbase for a French and a German server or two and forcing the ones who aren't going to speak English in any case, on to the English servers is bad for them and it's bad for us.
---
Well good thing you can ignore them, just like we used to ignore gold sellers in old trade chat.
---
The reality is, that a lot of people who are looking forward to Classic are definitely not 12 year old anythings lol
---
They are (for the most part) 30-40 year old Frenchmen, Germans, Spaniards, etc. and a good many of them either doesn't speak English very well OR they simply don't want to communicate in a foreign language during their recreational video game session.
---
Are you sure you aren't just ignorant to their needs, because it may not affect you, personally?
---
I love playing on international servers, but part of the reason that is the case is also, because I am keen on avoiding the type of tribal people who can't or don't want to escape their "flocks of a feather" mindset. Now they are forced to play on the same servers I enjoy and we'd likely both be happier, if they got what they wanted, because it'd also mean I get what I want ;)
---
23%? Source please
---
Yeah. I do see your point. It will probably alienate casual non-english speaking players unless they can find somebody to play with. Just as you say.
---
&gt;Tell me how streamers harass you. Oh wait, they don't because otherwise they'd lose their fucking job. 
---
were talking about the fans... OP was, then you were, then I was again... how did it change in your head mate? They're responsible on twitch for their fans, I don't see how it is any stretch they are when in other media.
---
&gt; An what are other things that you can't just straight up ignore or deal with?
---
Mass reporting to ban/suspend your account.
---
when undead dies but returns as a ghost
---
Blizzard announced that there won't be German, French, Spanish etc. servers in Classic so everyone from all the different countries will be on the same servers. One might think it's not that much of a problem but although everyone speaks basic english, the most spoken languages in europe are still german and french which will make trade chat quite interesting to say the least.
---
Layering is already present in the game and can be turned off/on when they want (never, like in Retail).
---
Having additional servers to run cost money (hardware, electricity, manpower,etc)
---
Initially I thought "ok maybe the first few levelling areas" but now that release is 2 months away I think they should just scrap the idea and just let the areas sort themselves out.
---
Trying to retrofit something like that seemed like a great idea but it's not too late just to take it out, let people be angry over shit spawns and keep sharding out of classic.
---
And your high if you think a server will have 10k peoplele trying to log in 1 server 2nd phase lol
---
I never said it was classic, I said it wasn’t as easy as retail and was still a good game then. And that statement is just false max level Wrath is nothing like retail. Retail is just brain dead button mashing at this point
---
&gt; And it could also mean 10PvE, 10PvP and 3RP. 
---
Nope...because this means that Germans can fill up a realm. But Blizzard said NO, THEY WON'T.
---
Which actually means 5-6 realms for the EU...IN BLIZZARD'S EXPECTATIONS.
---
When you have almost 20% of the EU speaking German, and they don't get their OWN realm...this means that Blizzard expects less than 80k players for the ENTIRE EU.
---
Hence...5 or 6 realms.
---
You WILL SEE that when Blizzard will release the realm names in about a month.
---
But they are playing themselves. Look, that's all them, logged on a server, trying to get involved in a large server event. And you don't need to understand anyway.
---
Yup and I just find this sad..
---
Shoot, I was super stoked when I got a green sword last night.  I played about 10 hours on my paladin in the stress test.  As I was preparing to log off (not to return before the test ends) I stopped the first person in elwynn to give him the two 6 slot bags I had accrued.  He gave me a green sword that was lightyears ahead of anything I had.  I stayed on another hour leveling my 2h sword skill just so i could kill things (exponentially quicker) with my new sword.
---
&gt;I mean yeah. If your max is lfr i dont know why would anyone be excited about the loot.
---
Are you saying randomly generated loot with the same 4 stats that are subject to even further RNG through titanforging is somehow more fun and exciting just because you get them in Mythic and not LFR?
---
Lmao..
---
What you think you are the center of the world? It's more enjoyable and easier to play in your native language. If you are not a troll you are an egocentric.
---
I'm a french-canadian and we have formed a group with already over 1.5k people to join the same server. I hope you get our server and you have to learn french.
---
The very first problem you listed is the exact problem that layering will have if classic is even remotely successful. Ion stated in an interview servers could have up to 10 layers. That’s 25000-30000 players. Even if 50% of the playerbase leaves, we will have around 15000 players collapsing into one non-dynamic respawning, *all on primetime* server. An absolute nightmare. 
---
The only way layering will be a success is if 80% of the players that are playing day 1 quit within two months, or if blizzard puts severe hard caps on servers, like 10k. Otherwise, it’s not the layering we should be worried about, it’s the world we play in after the layer collapses.
---
&gt; The more people in an a sub-zone, the faster the mob spawns - with limitations obviously.
---
If there's limitations they don't solve the issue they're trying to solve.
---
&gt; Was used on private servers with 10k+ population and it worked fine. (Only few problems due to extreme population).
---
Fine is very subjective, it's not fun knowing that you can't attack that guy over there because even if you kill him, you're just going to die to all the mobs that respawned during your fight.
---
Trying to battle your way through a crowded area with too high respawns is absolutely cancer, oh your build can't handle 2-3 mobs at a time with next to no downtime? Guess you're not doing this quest.
---
&gt; Advantage? All of layering's benefits without any of the problems.
---
But a bunch of other problems, such as those I mentioned.
---
&gt; The Blizzlike pop cap will be nowhere near 10k.
---
Citation? Because I'd bet dollars to donuts it's much higher.
---
&gt; With the news that EU will not get there own servers 
---
Not sure what news you are reading, but EU does get its own servers.  
---
It means, separate language besides English and Russian will not be availabel.  
---
So either you chose an English server, or an Russian one.
---
It's a stress test that started on Wednesday and is scheduled to end later today. They just changed the launcher to make it look like it will when Classic officially launches in August.
---
I doubt they will go back to BFA honestly.
---
Yea agree, its fun to  play with people from other countries as long as everybody speaks english.
---
3k is from from real vanilla. That's the maximum number if you want to be Blizzlike.
---
Pirate servers have to massively inflate mob and node spawns to accomodate 10k+ players, and it turns the whole game into easymode.
---
So 22 men on a field running after a round object does qualify as content? I'm just curious where you draw the line if you make a bold statement like that.
---
Can't everything be content? If I enjoy a naked man sitting on a beach whistling in the wind and there is someone who provides this, does it not count as content? 
---
Imagine actually trying to gatekeep what qualifies as "content" lol.
---
Tigermeat has something like a 80% drop rate. By making it into jungle stew you can make a stack of tiger meat vendor for 60s. Granted this requires you to diligently level cooking as you level but that's incredibly easy to do.
---
I'd like a system where switching layers makes resource nodes uninteractive and mobs only drop money/greys and quest items for 15 minutes, with a confirmation window informing you of the choice. Prevents the destruction of economies and whatnot.
---
no transfers at launch. They said they might bring them in if the community shows interest
---
No you can also Reroll or stay on that Server. Or inform yourself before you pick a Server.
---
Thank you for your comment though
---
Some people have trouble to learn other languages and others could but are not interested in it. No german or french wants someone foreigner to adapt to them but those luckily born and raise in an english country want us to adapt to them. Maybe the english speakers should learn german and play with us
---
&gt;- Community split :
---
&gt;Although I believe some of us won't mind grouping with other nationalities, some people are just gonna be jerks and will refuse to switch to english maybe because they just refuse to or sometimes because they can't causing channels unreadability and a big split in community.
---
So you want to avoid the community split by splitting the community first?
---
Om du nu är för att ha inofficiella server för olika språk så är det väl bara för blizzard att göra officiella istället. Varför du försvarar deras  handling att inte ha olika server för olika språk men samtidigt vill ha det förstår jag inte riktigt. Poängen med det hela är väl att de inte vill ha för många servrar och då finns det heller inte tillräckligt många för att ha inofficella heller. Så hur vi än gör så kommer det vara en mix, det kommer inte bli inofficiella servrar heller.
---
Typing is the new longhand mathematics.
---
0/10
---
You are implying they speak English. They do not, and those that do, refuse to speak it.
---
&gt;Perhaps you should do actual challenging content in WoW then instead of comparing easy-to-get loot to easy-to-get loot.
---
So the loot system in different in higher difficulties?
---
This wasnt the OP's point at all, and you obviously understand this, but you dont care as long as you can be toxic and make some idiotic reply to feel relevant.
---
Blizzard has consistently shown that this is the only way to get their attention, deal with it while we work at making the game good
---
I think that the truth is that no one can predict how the population will develop on classic servers. I agree that private servers might be a pretty bad metric. But it is true that the pop didn't drop that much on private servers.
---
&gt; better start searching for one that speaks English. And I'm fine with this.
---
Because you know from the very beginning when you start on a fresh server what language will become the main one of this specific server. I don't want to level a character to 40 only to see that the server has suddenly turned Spanish. 
---
But, only the language wouldn't be the problem. The problem is the sometimes completely different mind set off Germans, French etc. The communities of the different servers are vastly different from one another.
---
I would also add, that 99% of 20-30y old people are speaking english. The number goes down as you add age, since people were learning russia and german during communism
---
We will see. I wouldn't mind playing BC but it wasn't as good as vanilla. I hope you're right for the most part.
---
Engineering by far.
---
they could launch servers by language but warning people that if there is not enough players to support they will merge it, potentially with other languages
---
It's not their fault if People organize themselfs to storm one Server is it?
---
Well if you put it that way - which you could - then a dying Server is Blizzards fault too tbh^^
---
This would be my guess. I think classic will be packed at launch but have a sharp drop off. I think they don’t want to have to mess with trying to merge different servers down the line, especially if they’re supposed to be different languages.
---
Dobřeeeeee
---
Only 50% of the population in the EU speak and understand proper English.
---
&gt;English native speakers amount to 13% of the whole Union population,  while the percentage of people that speak English "well enough in order to be able to have a conversation", is 38%.
---
# English speakers
---
* Russia (5,48%)
---
* Spain (22%)
---
* Portugal (27%)
---
* Italy (34%)
---
* France (39%)
---
* Germany (56%)
---
It's why the loot system before the RNG shit was much better. When Ashkandi finally drops from Nefarian you know exactly what to expect, and you are super happy every time.
---
A loot system where you get disappointed when you get loot is a terrible system.
---
So only countries who are syncing their TV shows and movies to their native language are having those issues, because the rest of the countries dont do this and therefore statistically speak better English.  
---
So France, Germany, and Spain, around 60ish days, to complete your english exam :)
---
Really tho.. we know this is a temporary thing. Game isn’t out yet, also it’s been addressed...
---
Complain if it lasts too long or whatever but your literally complaining about something that hasn’t even happened yet, chicken ain’t hatched yet..
---
Sorry you can’t have raids in beta/test 🤨
---
NA now living in EU, I'm now fucked. Why can't EU just speak two (or even three) languages like most Canadians and just use English by default for online gaming? It's not hard.
---
100% same.
---
emerald dream man
---
I guess, that's personal preference and so not right or wrong. But I personally could never imagine playing wow in my own language, it would pull me out of any chance of immersion immediatly. 
---
Secondly I don't feel a need to talk my own language everywhere. I don't think my language is any better than any other ones so I am happy speaking english too.
---
&gt; Walking up to a player and knowing which language he speaks is worth a lot.
---
yes, that's why I always assume everyone speaks english. And then if I'm playing with someone and we get to speaking in-game while questing then maybe I'll ask where they're from, but even then I am more than happy still chatting in english because I don't hate the english language.
---
as software developer: HOW?
---
did u parse every chat through entire Dictionaries, to guess the language? 
---
or will it only work if every other chat user has also this addon so, you boardcast the selected player lang to everyone?
---
Too bad your not a dictator that is able to control movements and what others find entertaining. People are allowed to enjoy what they want, wether it's paying for pixel dancers on moon guard to following a steamer, people are allowed to be different.
---
Female troll ofc. I can't stand the hunchback and priest gear actually looks decent on female trolls
---
Even without focus on PvP? What's so special or good with Engineering? It's one of a few professions  haven't touched in retail ever
---
&gt;I never said it was classic
---
Read my reply again but slowly
---
&gt;And that statement is just false max level Wrath is nothing like retail
---
Orly? I played on a wotlk for 3 years and recently played again and it's exactly like retail you pos spam not speaking to anyone unless they bad and you actually have less core abilities to cast than now.
---
23% ne, špatně
---
\^ This guy gets it. Shit like that is gonna happen in the beta. Can you guess what your job in that scenario is? Submit a bug report. If the Horde know what triggered it, then each of them should describe it, since layering isn't supposed to get changed unless you: a) leave the continent b) get invited to a party from a different layer. If they just randomly got layered off, then it's obviously not an intended part of the system. 
---
So enough with the smug cynicism about how "right" you were about layering and start writing those bug reports. Classic is only gonna be as good as you help make it while you are in beta, so if you just wait for it to crash and burn, then that's what's gonna happen.
---
You are clearly a native English speaker.
---
That's the thing friend, they do **not** use English when they use the internet. They have their own communities, they have their own websites, they have their own language options for every website they browse...
---
The issue is not that international communities (e.g. guilds) cannot work, but that international servers will most likely lead to chaos. You can bet on it that there will be a substantial amount of people who will not speak English while playing WoW. So you'll have Spanish, French, German, Polish, Italian, and probably some other languages in addition to English being spoken in the server. You will have certain guilds that are exclusive to a certain language. You will have people speaking their language in global chats. You'll have groups where 3 people figure out they all speak [language] and not speak English within that group because "fuck the others". And then there is the namecalling, you say it does not exist in eve ... good for you guys, it does exist in WoW. Since I've had experience with it: Germans will definitely get called Nazis rather regularly. I don't know what the go-to insults for other nationalities are, but probably similarly annoying things.
---
Good to know!
---
i'd argue even more than that.
---
The major part of the bfa/retail crowd are casuals.  All these players will get access to xlassic many of them will try it and most will uninstall the moment a lvl 6 mob kills them / they fail in a dungeon or they need 10 hours to lvl 10.
---
always asmons lot too - his fanbase is a blight upon the land...
---
&gt;I still can not understand how you people derive enjoyment from getting loot instead of actually completing the content and overcoming challenges ...
---
Maybe try playing the game first? If you cannot understand how getting rewarded after working hard toward a goal can be rewarding I dont know what to say. Generation instant gratification?
---
In the age of virtualized environments I would expect realms would be able to scale up and down as the population changes. I would also expect Blizzard to have enough respect for it's players... Guess not.
---
Classic = Dead on Arrival with this Blizzard is fucking retarded
---
Just install the english client. I dont understand why do People who actually speak English make a big drama of it. Its all the other who dont, they should be complaining and probably are on the forums of their language.
---
most if not all states legally forbid the boss from giving any negative replies other than NOT REHIRE ABLE, they can get into big trouble mister
---
Thats native speakers. English is by far the largest if you add total number of speakers.
---
We were locked to SEA for the start of SC2.
---
Then after months of Blizz insisting that the client can't switch regions they put an SEA/NA region selector in.
---
They've made their reasoning very well known, to mitigate the day 1 server stress and to create more stable week 1/2 playerbase numbers across each layer.
---
The problem.. is that while both the issues that blizzard wants to solve impact a players launch experience, layering itself heavily impacts player immersion and can be abused in many ways to gain advantages which couldn't occur in vanilla. eg. Farming multiple nodes, killing multiple rare spawns ect.
---
I saw someone suggest my favorite solution to this whole mess in another thread, have a player swap their layer when they enter any resting zone. Removes the abuseability somewhat and is less jaring to see only friendly npcs shift instead of all the hostiles/enemy faction players aswell.
---
Can tell you've never worked in a professional setting.
---
Stop whining and speak the queens English
---
That will definitely happen but what can you do if blizz doesnt want to make them official
---
My god are we still talking about this? It’s a few weeks. Chill the hell out.
---
And why is that?
---
I personally expect over 6 million players at launch of Classic, with 3-4 million as solid player base one year later. And that would be twice as more than BfA.
---
You can call us delusional...but this will be OVER come August 27th, 2019, when reality will hit like a truck.
---
People like you are unable to see the big picture...which is that over 150 million people played WoW since 2005. And they didn't stopped because "family" or "job". They stopped because WoW SUXS balls.
---
If ONLY 5% of the former WoW players come back for classic, that is over 7 million people. And 5% is damn conservative percentage.
---
But hey, call us delusional...you have about 66 days left.
---
We can wait 66 days before saying " I told you so ".
---
They better not pull a fast one on us Oceanic players and give us NA servers with Oceanic titles (If we even get one)..
---
I was looking forward to playing Vanilla with a sub 350 ping for the first time ever.
---
It almost feels like they want it to fail so they can try and hit us with the "I told you so" about them saying "you think you do but you don't". Instead they need to start preparing for OSRS levels of success since that's more likely.
---
I don't know man I get what you mean but german is still the most spoken language in europe with french being second. Most of the people are able to communicate in english but why would you force the majority of people to speak in a language that is not their mother tongue?
---
Listen. You're being pretty high n mighty about this. France and Germany I believe English is a CHOICE in school unlike say Denmark where we learn English at the age of 5. The system of those countries have failed the citizens so why should they then be punished for it? Scandinavia has no issue with English at all. It is a second language if not our main language at times so ofc we have no issue with it. French people cannot pronounce the letter T or so cause it's never used in their language so having French people learn English on their own accord is seemingly rare cause I spoke with a Frenchman and he said it is hard for them to learn English. All I know is that I understand English but I also want them to get their own server because I would get pissed off if I wanted to ask a person a question and it's either met with que? Cyka blyat, merde or brakwurst just to be silly. It is like that on private servers and it's annoying.
---
It's for young people who have been enabled to waste practically unlimited amounts of time (like we did first time around in Vanilla). Now as adults with responsibilities, we only have time to play, not to watch someone play in between playing. This is where the disconnect is coming from.
---
Its not about not be able to speak english its about the 99% other languages that mix with each other and split the community.I dont want to read france shit cause i dont understand it and believe me most france people wont write in english
---
Yea, that game changed in a way you don't like, burn it!
---
I see this entire comment section as pathetic. A bunch of neck beards getting angry that the game isn't being played exactly like they wantit or expect it. Grow up, people of all walks are allowed to play, wether they are streamers or groveling fans. It's just a game.
---
You're quite wrong about that, there will most certainly still be private servers around.  They'll be hosted like the ones are now in countries that don't give a crap about blizzards copyright.  You could host a thousand of them in China and the chinese govt could not care less.
---
What is layering
---
If you find someone willing to pay, hit me up
---
xD
---
If anybody speaks Irish in chat on a WoW server, that would be pretty amazing. It's a nearly dead language, with almost zero native speakers, all of whom speak perfect English.
---
It's kinda hard to read how delusional some people in here are. No, this will not work out just fine and if you start thinking about this a bit more in depth everyone should see how this will majorly damage Classic WoW in Europe - yes, even for people who speak fluent english.
---
Just some points:
---
1) Global/Public Chat Channels will be absolut madness and basically useless - no, Blizzard can't ban people for not talking english there - this is not a shady free private server.
---
2) There will be no server community, only guild communities.
---
3) There will be servers completely overtaken by one language, good luck choosing the right one if you don't look up reddit and other online resources first (yes, exactly this affects the majority of players). Well okay - I guess you can still play by just cutting out any meaningful interaction with other players, it's not like Classic is all about this.
---
4) Mixing multiple languages will lead to way more toxicity - I hate to break it to you guys but we don't live in a perfect world and this will lead to public racism.
---
5) I didn't even mention people who don't speak english well enough to communicate somewhat ingame. Just think about a random dude wanting to try out Classic, he downloads it and get's to the realm selection. Well, I guess realm XY sounds good - let's go. The guy just speaks his native language and he never has any way to communicate to other players because the server is basically overtaken by the spanish community (no offense, just an example). After 2 weeks of questing alone he quits the game with the opinion, well it's just an old game and there is nothing special about it - mostly because he wasn't even introduced to the core part of classic wow - the community.
---
Wait, you work remotely and still clock in your lunch? What?
---
Woohoo!!!
---
You actually may have a very valid Point right here :D 
---
I like that idea!
---
I'll check back on that :P
---
RemindMe! 40 Days "Language Servers"
---
Cyka my nut
---
I don’t understand the one with the doctor and the X-ray?
---
Wow - I thought stress tests were supposed to be stable, playable fun times. Wait is the game out yet?
---
The Olga is awesome and so much fun to watch! I love horde but suck at PVP or I would join! Thanks for adding some fun to the community 😃
---
The mods are really pulling out the "Y'all can't behave" card, wish they'd chill.
---
Did you report it? Not trying to be a dick, but please make sure we have feedback flowing into Blizzard.
---
Dude you are being too salty, I am pretty sure the devs are doing their best and are even going beyond to mitigate issues that classic had on launch.
---
Also Activision is a different company altogether, they are completely separate only owned by ActivisionBlizzard same as Blizzard.
---
Put down your elitist pitchfork and cut them some slack.
---
&gt; If there's limitations they don't solve the issue they're trying to solve.
---
That depends on the limitation. On the most popular private server the limit was a bound on the respawn rate. 
---
If we assume that classic servers will have a lower pop cap, then we wont see issues that stem from that problem, to the same degree.
---
&gt; Fine is very subjective, it's not fun knowing that you can't attack that guy over there because even if you kill him, you're just going to die to all the mobs that respawned during your fight.
---
Fun is also very subjective. 
---
&gt; But a bunch of other problems, such as those I mentioned.
---
Which were based on whatever you said was "fun".
---
Obviously I'm guessing. I'm talking pop cap **pr. server** if you missed that. I remember reading something about the pop cap being around 2k back when vanilla was live.
---
Okay sorry, i might have not told a full story here.  
---
These unofficial communities destroy the game for everyone else and i pity anyone rolling on those servers.  
---
Back when i played my server used to have two majority groups and a few minority. The two majority was dutch and hungarian. Hungarian language everywhere just drove the players away. At the first chance for free char transfer dutch ppl left the server so all you could see was literally just hungarian chat. Guess what happened after with the rest of the players and eventually, not so long after that what happened to the server.  
---
So please, at least do german/french servers to lessen these effects.
---
And yet Asmongold is neither of those things.
---
And yet they chose to come up with layering....
---
So now I'm going to assume layering is there to avoid having to purchase good server hardware. Instead they find a solution to cheap out and only need to have servers that cap out at 3k players (or whatever the layer max is)
---
Well it's not because I'm not X that I can't feel empathy for those who are.  
---
As I said I'm not the biggest victim from this decision since I could get away with it.  
---
I'm just trying to bring more people to understand this is a problem and a non english speaker, well obviously can't make a post in here to explain it.
---
I did :)
---
&gt; Shortly after firing hundreds of people he boasted about having record breaking profits. He’s a piece of shit.
---
It seems like you're talking about JA Brock. 
---
Kotick was the asshat in this instance, he boasted about record Acti-Blizz profits and laid off 20% of Blizzard's workforce.
---
There's a lot of things anyone can lay on Brock's door, but this isn't one of them.
---
You missed downvoting everything.
---
Because, even though I am fluent in English, while I am playing in spanish I can communicate faster, better and more accurately, also with less of a hassle for myself. I don't think is that difficult to understand.
---
All he needs to do is implement a deep learning algorithm and use that to identify languages, after a couple million lines of training it should be work really well!
---
And considering how efficient wow addons are executed, it shouldn't carry any noticeable performance issues, at least once Intel breaks the laws of physics and invent a CPU with a couple hundred times the single threaded performance we have now.
---
I plan to level a female troll priest as an alt with some friends mostly for pvp. Never played a priest before but it looks fun.
---
Because once classic is live - they'll both be live.
---
And people have gotten used to calling it retail over "modern wow"
---
Pretty sure I've seen some interviews where some dev's called it retail too -
---
It is. Becouse its not about the loot as the post is saying. Its about the way you obtain it. And in mythic raid after wiping a boss many times and finally defeating it, it feels good to get a nice drop. 
---
Same with the ring in the screenshot. Its good becouse you need to complete a long chain to get it.
---
I will be messaging you on [**2019-07-31 11:23:00 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2019-07-31 11:23:00 UTC To Local Time) to remind you of [**this link.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c37u22/my_take_on_national_servers/erpg7dp/)

---
Human get a bonus to sprint, gnomes get a bonus to int. Neither gives bonus spell damage, as that doesn’t come from int in classic. Int gives a larger mana pool and a small increase to spell crit. Ultimately is not very significant, so pick the race you think looks better.
---
What's the point? Ion will personally delete it anyway.
---
My fans on bfa go nuts. On classic they barely run. I love it.
---
C c a f?
---
Launch... not lunch.  He requested time off for the launch which was apparently approved and then they changed their mind and said he couldn’t have it off apparently.  If I’m understanding the situation correctly anyway...
---
I second this. It’s a great add on. There is one in development for Classic. I tried it over the three stress tests. It’s still a bit buggy, but that’s to be expected.
---
Hungary has 9 milions poeple,  Czech has 10 milions, Romania has 20 milions. Even if they make a French/German server I really doubt there will ever be a server for EACH of these countries anyway.
---
Indeed said like that this doesn't sound so smart, but see it like that :  
---
By community split I mean inside a same world there will be people playing together who won't be willing or just able to interact.
---
Language realms are like separate universe so it's like if you had multiple dimensions and people from different dimensions just can't interact with each other, so when you see someone in the open world you don't have to ask yourself well is this guy going to be able to communicate or is he just going to be a smart playing bot with 0 communication.
---
One of the reasons I‘ exited for mages - lorewise the game class is way closer to its lore capabilities than retail WoW.
---
This isn't a tinfoil hat, this is the retail Blizzard-Activision we know today trying to pull off classic.
---
They're going to destroy the game between these cost cutting measures of layering and regional language servers. Any one who delusionally says layering is a necessary evil for tourists is a shit bag retail player wanting to play classic at all costs.
---
&gt;I'll sacrifice hype in order to get something done about layering any day of the week.
---
While I do agree with your general statement let's be honest - the far majority of posts complaining are not helping. I mean, so many of them clearly don't even truly know what layering *is*.
---
And many seem to just think removing laying will solve everything, as if it is just some evil plot from Blizzard to ruin their own success. Layering is there to solve a problem, and while I don't agree with how it is done you can't ignore the underlying problem. Just removing layering will *also* be shit.
---
There are sometimes post that acknowledges the underlying problem and tries to give constructive feedback and they are great, but it's a minority.
---
Dude, do you not remember being on the Internet as a kid?
---
Yeah, I was 19 since I was 12.
---
&gt; You know that a company realizes something is horrible and poisonous when they have to keep giving it new names to try to avoid pissing people off.
---
Like EA and loot boxes currently.. trying to rebrand them as "surprise mechanics"
---
Digital prima nocturne is here, everyone else literal peons.
---
You don't know that until we see it.
---
Until then everything you said is baseless conjecture.
---
Ofc you'd want to learn English as a Swede, given that the opportunities afforded to you by remaining confined to your own language are limited. This is far less so in the case of German or French speakers though, simply given the size and population of the countries.
---
Gotta stop thinking about layering as an issue - we have to accept that layering will be in at launch and it will be exploited. 
---
Blizzard won't do drastic changes to fix it (like locking people into layers for 30 minutes) because they want people to play together at all times.
---
Only issue will be if they still have layering in game come October.
---
I feel some sympathy for Germans, Frenchies and Spanish but i'm glad Russians are getting their own client. The non English names and text is really annoying to deal with. I do hope however, Russians that want to use English names and communicate in English/German/French or Spanish can pick between both clients.
---
Pay 1300 euros on Ebay...Sealed CE price.
---
Cause it's retail
---
top kek
---
Nowdays , especially in gaming community, everything is in English. Folks have to adapt. Take overwatch, it's a blizzard game and in ranked communication is key but Blizzard did not make an option to group by languages/countries, you have to speak in English.
---
Concerning WoW Classic, I thing it's the right move. Server population would be bigger, people who are not English speakers will try their best and learn at the same time. It's win-win for everybody.
---
Thank you, Ion. Very cool!
---
And you want all shops to be just for English people.
---
I don't agree with Blizzards decision. If it was up to me, we WOULD have language specific realms. But Blizzards decision is not the end of the world either. I'm confident that the community will be able to organize itself pretty good, just like it did in retail, even before migrations. 
---
This subreddit have been going insane about this the past few day's and I think it's a bit absurd
---
This is the reward for the defias brotherhood chain that takes you through VC and Stocks, right?
---
&gt; because it's better financially for Blizz then it's super sad.
---
That's how companies operate, to generate profit. If it's not there for them, it's probably not a good idea to push for
---
Why do you think they're making this game? as a fan service or a favour to all of us?
---
Fair enough - that makes a lot more sense. I see.
---
That could defenitely become a Problem. And I see how it is really annoying to those People who have rolled on that Server.
---
I assume that Germans and French will probably just "take" one Server and demand it to them each. Meaining two Servers will probably be gone already. I guess there will be info on that before. I hope someone Posts it on Reddit too so People will know where not to roll...
---
It should honestly just be reportworthy if People Keep talking in their native language on a not native Server (in the General and Trade Chats etc. at least) 
---
I mean Guild Chat is OK IMO. Group Chat mhmhmhmhm maybe^^
---
But all the General Chats should be strictly english on an international Server.
---
We'll have to see how it works out in the end... Hopefully we will get some National realms
---
It is... and blizzard gets to deem it so.
---
None of you will complain about layering on 8/26 27, and nobody will complain about it in October.
---
I'm not sure when they backtracked [since this interview](https://youtu.be/UHMd0KC3eTY?t=244) a month ago. 
---
I've only seen people being mad about layering on classic beta and stress test realms, when layering is the very thing they are testing!
---
But hey, if they do backtrack and keep it permanently after the launch then fuck them. Until then I have not seen a single instance where they said that they'll keep it.
---
&gt;Or inform yourself before you pick a Server.
---
If this information is available at launch then you could try to do that. If it isn't you are playing roulette and have to hope your server wont become the official french one.
---
I have another crazy idea. 
---
Instead of the specific communities arbitrarily deciding on which server to go maybe Blizzard could somehow "mark" certain servers with a language suggestion? Maybe there is a way to give a server an official language so there wont by any confusion about it? They could for example write the language next to the server name or the sperate languages could have their own tabs.
---
Im playing retail on a "polish" realm. Everyone os polish there, there is like one International guild. 
---
I get what you mean. But i regret my decision about making my characters there. My friends wanted me to play there with them. Id probably would really like raiding in a International guild to be honest. So i know what you're talking about but i do not agree.
---
You say that as if it’s a clearcut case of right or wrong.  When 12 million people play a game there will many different views.  There will be a lot that agree with you and a lot that don’t.
---
Zones names are gray on PvE realms. It's been like this in vanilla.
---
What if he meant that, if they made Classic Servers, they would fuck it up so badly so we really think we do, but we don't? Damn, so he was right from the beginning.
---
The problem really is that people of 'ok' conversational english skills, do not want to speak english. Unless you're fluent, translating from your own language into english takes a lot more out of you than just speaking your native language. They *prefer* to speak German in Germany, that's why English isn't the majority language. This doesn't change because they go online. The only question is whether we want our English language servers flooded with foreign language players and guilds, or we want to give them their own space, so that they don't need to communicate in a language, which in general is much harder for them to communicate in. There is no possibility that everyone will just speak English, this doesn't happen.
---
&gt; and offer free realm transfers.
---
It's really obvious to me sometimes that most of you retail players on this sub don't get at all what made vanilla great.
---
And the majority of language servers weren’t in vanilla #nochanges
---
I didn't say it affected me.  I"m just saying for population control it makes sense.  If the majority of your tourists are going to be retailers who check it out just because its free, then just don't make it free to them for a month or two so they aren't clogging up the starting zones.  
---
If they are serious about playing classic they will buy the separate sub.  It just balances out your launch a little better is all.
---
Yes, Blizzard made a blue post lately saying no langage localized servers in europe unless for the Russian for "technical reason". 
---
So yeah, only english servers...
---
EU is not a country, lol
---
Which proves my point of the “masters” have the final say.
---
Yeah, should be fun. I'm going to roll one as my main and I'm really looking forward to healing and melting faces in PvP. Don't forget that priests have the best ability in the game - Mind Control!
---
&gt;adding things like Arena  into Vanilla would be uncontested by the community
---
Are you even serious?
---
because "retail" represents exactly what it is: a cash cow
---
It's not like classic is hard. It's just tedious and time consuming. You can be the biggest casual on the world and still like classic.
---

---
&gt;If you really played private servers you would know that it never was a problem to host hundreds of different cultures and languages on the same server
---
If you ever played a European server that is the unofficial designation for a language (eg EU-Ragnaros) you would know there IS such a problem.
---
A girl is noone.
---
Wow talk about mental gymnastics the guy above just tried to pull on you LOL
---
What about side by side with a friend?
---
I got fucked by this in vanilla... my alliance realm was Hakkar which slowly turned into Italian only and I couldn't afford a transfer. 
---
Broke my little heart having to leave my main there until wotlk while I rerolled elsewhere.
---
It’s a risk, I don’t assume every server can naturally converge to 3k pop just because a new phase hits.
---
They do call it that, just look into your wow folders. There is retail and classic folders
---
Which guides do you recommend for a beginner mage?
---
&gt;You misunderstood the post completely, good job.
---
This has nothing to do with the difficulty of the content so you changing to subject to avoid discussing the problem is a bit dishonest dont you think? ;)
---
It's about having clear set goals to work towards. The difficulty has no bearing on this because every difficulty in retail has the same basic problem, which is that the strength of the item that drop is based on random chance.
---
This has to be a community effort as someone just started to mention something like this in an other post.
---
We will have to sort out and spread the information on which nations plan to invade which servers when we get the realmlist so anyone wanting to dodge those servers can do.
---
Didn't they said before that there will be "vanilla" population caps after the initial launch "period".
---
Layering is used to prevent server merges, not to increase the pop cap
---
I totally forgot about this! Can't wait to get this in my druid
---
LOL when you accidentally telegraph that you know nothing about how server resources work.
---
What if im polish and i want to play with my friends who are German and Italian and Spanish.  Where do i go? I cannot play with them all, and im not gonna play on either of those realms without knowing the language (and you cant blame me for not knowing them, since these are not International languages like english is). What about me?
---
Been there, done that. You’ll be able to do that for a while. Not permanently.
---
I see that as "the squeaky wheel gets the oil". 
---
Whether it's a meme about layering or an in-depth analysis about what's the issue with it, as long as Blizzard sees, that it's on people's mind, they'll put resources in their hands to at least \*try\* and alleviate the issue or fix it to a point that it'll throw off the least of its potential customers.
---
This is hilarious, you will get downvoted to hell in this sub for it though.
---
CLOWN WORLD
---
Has there been any official comment already? Was hoping that almost 24 hours of vocal criticism would forcefully pull Blizz‘s heads out of their asses ready.
---
So hear me out. Add the auto translate feature from FF14 into the WoW client. Have it be filled with common phrases. You can start typing a word in your native language then hit tab to have it switch to a translated term. The clients language is what it picks these up as and translates them.
---
Ex. {Hello} shows {Salut} on a French client.
---
Extend that to phrases like {Ranged pull}{Please}. Then anyone could read and understand.
---
Im from switzerland normally i would go with german realms you would think. But thats not the case german servers are just pure cringe and i like to take my ppl from a much wider and more international pool. Just tryout a few private servers and youll see this is nothing to worry about atleast if you understand simple english.
---
3k( or 2500-3500) is just the vanilla server cap that the layers sizes are decided by
---
I never said that anyone should be forced to.
---
Without streamers,  there would be no classic wow
---
Execute order 66
---
I call it retail because it’s what the game files officially call it now.
---
It's just a matter of using one's mother tongue and enjoying communicating with people. I bet tons of people won't be speaking at all except for when they require help/raid/BTS. 
---
Imagine speaking like a toddler in a social game. Yeah, a great experience that they gonna be having.
---
Someone somewhere mentioned that there are 84 German language servers on live. I don't know what the chances are that we can't fill one on classic, but I'd bet against it personally.
---
Giving someone a bad reference is looked down upon and avoided by most companies, any inconsistency or discrepancy in the negative reference no matter how minor will be grounds for a lawsuit so the majority err on the side of caution.
---
For the same reason you would probably not play on a French language server.
---
&gt; So 22 men on a field running after a round object does qualify as content? I'm just curious where you draw the line if you make a bold statement like that.
---
Yes, because that's something original. Essentially, every game is unique. You know what's not original or unique? A video of a man, sitting in his room and watching a video, then stopping that video for a couple of seconds to say "Yeah, that's true".
---
&gt; Can't everything be content
---
It can. Shit on the ground is also content. I'm merely debating the quality of said content. But, like I said, to each their own. I can't really be surprised by how dumb some people considering what's happening in the rest of the world, so whatever. You can sit in your room and watch a manchild react to popular videos while I go and enjoy actually decent content.
---
Peace
---
Blizzard has been underestimating classic wow for a decade now, accepting that classic will be bigger than BFA is accepting that they've ruined their own game and clearly don't know what they're doing.
---
Every time I see anything about classic coming from Ion or Brack it always seems like they're expecting it to fail. They always talk about their plans for when everyone quits classic the month after release. Classic isn't a game you quit in a month like BFA, the content takes a lot longer to get through. There's no way casual players will even be max level in a month. It seems to me that they kind of want it to fail so they can continue to make the game that they've envisioned and that they've been in charge of developing for so long.
---
I could agree on many of these points, even if I'm more then fine having only english servers, but I also think that many people forget that Blizzard is also supposed to make profit.
---
I'd much rather have them spend a little less on localization (fewer servers, less work, don't have to manage all the single communities and decide how/when to merge realms) then on any other aspect of the game.
---
 I cannot understand all the rage, I'm Portuguese and I always played wow in English since I joined in the lasts days of classic I was 14 years old, Portuguese was never available in any game (Portuguese was only Available on WoW in 2011, if I'm not mistaken, by that year I was not playing wow anymore ) and it help me a lot to learn English, and let's be honest English is essential on today world. I started playing wow again in past 2 months, I installed the game in Portuguese and immediately I changed that because I'm so used to see everything in English.
---
It will be done my lord
---
If you do your job properly in PVE you won't need stamina since the encounters are built to be beaten by a balanced and appropriately geared group. The damage you take will be predictable and your healers are there to keep you topped up.
---
For talents there are ones which are completely useless for PVE/PVP. Using a healer priest as an example there are talents which improve your armor, reduce your manaburn cast time, give your offensive spells the chance to stun, decrease the cooldown on your fear and ones to give you the chance to keep casting while you're being hit. These are generally useless in PVE for a dedicated healing priest - you shouldn't be getting hit by mobs, you're not relying on fear to stay alive, you shouldn't be casting offensive spells and you shouldn't be worried about rogues stunlocking you. However in PVP they're staple parts of surviving.
---
I'm not a fan of PVE so I can't give examples of something good about it, but what I love about PVP and find lacking in PVE is variation. I raided hardcore for years but completely burnt out on it - there's so little variation as most fights outside of Naxx boil down to simply repeating your combat rotations while waiting for the target to do something predictable at 30% health or every three minutes. A single person screwing up can wipe a raid as the game punishes the simplest of mistakes - this is the only way Blizzard can make the game difficult outside of requiring specific levels of gear.
---
PVP however is massively different - you don't turn up at Molten Core and find that Baron Geddon has respecced from prot to arms and has two stealthed rogues behind him. He'll never do a /raid message to his MC crew saying "Huge incoming here, need reinforcing ASAP". He'll never decide to just ignore the tanks/DPS and make a beeline to the healers.  It's all the same, every single raid. Encounters are designed to be beaten. 
---
In PVP you're fighting against a person who is trying to beat you. In group PVP you have to respond to feints, counter attacks, baiting, etc. Tactics are fluid and once you get to the premade vs premade level I find it's an infinitely more fun game than PVE.
---
Naxx was cool though.
---
&gt; That depends on the limitation. On the most popular private server the limit was a bound on the respawn rate.
---
I dunno man, on &lt;redacted&gt;dale, people were literally standing in circles around spawns spamming rightclicks to get tags on instantly spawning mobs, that doesn't sound like a limit to me. On &lt;redacted&gt;3 people were doing the same, but mobs had a minimum 1-2 min respawn which absolutely didn't solve the problem, I had login issues early like many other people so I got stuck in the zerg and had a 12 hour played to level 10.
---
&gt; Fun is also very subjective.
---
True, but I'm willing to bet most the people who roll on a pvp server do so because they want people to be able to attack each other.
---
&gt; Which were based on whatever you said was "fun".
---
I'm not sure preventing certain classes from completing certain quests is a subjectively bad thing
---
&gt; Obviously I'm guessing. I'm talking pop cap pr. server if you missed that. I remember reading something about the pop cap being around 2k back when vanilla was live.
---
Yes and blizzard are not going to use that cap for classic, that's the entire reason behind layering, they know LOTS of people are going to leave early, so they're using layering to prevent overpopulation issues while at the same time keeping overall realm pops high and preventing queues.
---
Someone needs to gather all of the "PSA / FYI / REMEMBER / LPT" threads .
---
There must be 100's by now
---
I'm French as well, and played on both English and French servers on different MMOs without issues.
---
In your case , what should happen is that you look/search on Reddit, popular website forums in French. The 'community' will create/provide a list of preferred realms for the French community , so people can try to regroup there preferably. If you do the same, you will most likely end up in a French guild , and besides random pug group you will rarely speak English.
---
You will have the choice to join a French only speaking guild or an international one.
---
Where in recent years you could play and just have your own guild for your alts, or be in very small guild, since everything became puggable, classic will be even more about finding the right guild for you, and somehow of at least a proper size due to 40 man raid requirements (if interested in raiding).
---
Pug only, lone wolf will probably have a harder time in classic than in retail due to the nature of the game on top of the localization choice blizzard made.
---
Totally it is even more fun I think.
---
But given that a lot of Veteran Players also made some real life friends back then which they are still connected with - I understand that some People really wish for National Servers again to maybe make some new friends again :)
---
But IDC TBH JUST RELEASE PLOX
---
I don't think it needs to 'surpass' live for them to make content for it. WoW outpaces all the other MMOs in population by miles, so even if Classic is *only* at or just below the population levels of those other games it still makes a lot of sense to make content for it. 
---
Ultimately they would decide if its new content or re-releasing expansions, but I think it would have to be like &lt;100/200k active people for them not to do anything else with it.
---
&gt; I can’t imagine that any original vanilla players wants this.
---
Well for what it's worth, I can add one vote confirming this.
---
How about instead of flexing your most likely highly exaggerated accomplishments you go apply to blizzard and work there for a week.  
---
Looks like you could fix literally all problems in a week without breaking a sweat mate.  The WoW community thanks you for your service in advance, the mightiest coder of all time.
---
Now gtfo of here.
---
Will they though? Will the (older) people that haven‘t gained the benefit of a better education really adapt? 
---
Cause folks can be really stubborn about something like that if you throw elements like nationalism into that.
---
My recent experience playing Atlas says you are hopeless optimist
---
Income = subscriptions
---
Exactly why they won't put more effort into classic than needed.
---
Income doesn't only = people playing classic. It's the same sub.
---
The people on this sub that think blizzard is specifically setting out to launch classic because it will "make them millions" are delusional.
---
It will help - but this isn't a new game nor an expansion.
---
Fire talents for levelling?
---
Not chasing world 1st lvl 60 (so not worried about AOE grind), unlikely to be raiding in the near future (so I'm not worried that fire isn't viable in MC/BWL). I get that mages have mana issues but that's why we make our own water isn't it (so not worried about min/max'ing DPM).
---
I do want to blow stuff up and have fun, and as I'm not on Beta that's confined to playing with the talent calculator. :-)
---
I'm not entirely sure how the resistances work. Some of the talents give the bonus as % (Elemental Precision), others as flat number (Arcane Subtly). I understand that we need 6% to be 99% certain of hitting mobs 2 lvls above us, which I get from Elemental Precision. So why do all the spec's also list Arcane Subtly +2?
---
Is it just because its a way of getting to Arcane Concentration for clearcasting or is there another / better reason?
---
This is what will end up happening, and that sucks, too. Reason it sucks is that the majority of people won't know about this concept, or even bother to look into this kind of danger when selecting their server. Imagine only knowing English and after weeks or months of leveling your character you realize your server is the unofficial Portuguese one. Even if it happens after only lvl 30 or 40 that's still a ton of time to realize you have to give up and roll elsewhere, making you even further behind than you might already be.
---
I learned a great deal of english by playing World of Warcraft. If I hadn't played a video game that let me interact socially using the english language, I wouldn't have the job I have today.
---
People really need to chill out about this. It's perfectly fine and people will learn along the way what to call items, raids, bosses in real time. Their english will improve over time and if you so desperately need a national community, guilds provide this and addons along the way give tools to translate everything in-game.
---
Because the data folder is named "retail".
---
I dont doubt that there probably will be millions checking out Classic at launch, but my point was that only a minority will keep actively playing the game some months after release. Definitely not 3-4 million after a year, I expect it to be around a million after a year. We can bet if you want.
---
&gt;If the starting zone is super packed and someone is super nice and chill, or that person is an asshole, down the road we’ll run into each other and there will be a good or bad social consequence.
---
So how is it better to not have layering and after the initial turists leave you have the choice between ghost realms or mass merging, thus giving the same problem?
---
No one is saying layering isn't damaging, even Blizzard knows that - but the alternative of not doing anything is even worse.
---
Not saying layering is perfect, far from it - but you seem to want something that is not possible. *Something* has to be done to account for all the players that will initially play and drop out soon after. It isn't just about solving too many players in a zone.
---
Well prove yourself and teach me that additional servers and layering has the same cost. Please, you seems to be the wise one here.
---
You're right. My other points still stand however.
---
Well you'd go play on an english speaking server as there were at wow launch, and some people did since you're all international.
---
Germans always get there’s towels down early 😉
---
I'm debating whether or not to take on the HWL Grind, the Gun/Bow are BiS till Naxx and double spellblades set up some wonderfully trolly builds.
---
Well you were talking about the most spoken language in the world, not the most spoken language in North America and West Europe. If we are just considering Europe, the most spoken languages (by number of native speakers) are russian, german, french and English, in that order. Yup, english is only the fourth most spoken language in Europe. Even if we exclude Russian because they will get their own server, it would still make sense to at least have german and french servers before english servers, dont you think?  
---
Im just bringing this up because I think that expecting that people in Europe will all agree to play in english servers just because "most important language because uh, reasons?" is not really a reasonable thing to expect or even to ask.
---
This looks like an issue made up by english speaking people. I won't ever join a language based server, I want to meet people from other countries and speak and interact with them thank you. I left a country based guild to join an international one and my enjoyment increased tenfold.
---
This. Although why wait until some people find themselves "trapped" on a non-English speaking community server? It would be better if they mark some servers as DE or FR etc. from the outset, so people can choose what nationality to play with from the beginning.
---
Looks like stormstrike didn't crit, but the standard melee attack and the 2 windfurry hits to follow did. 
---
Has anyone done the math on what the odds are of all 4 attacks hitting and 3 out of 4 attacks all critting?
---
want crypts as a 5 or 10 man dungeon
---
Dirtyyy scummm!!
---
Yet about 51% within the Union speak English, with 38% describing their skills as „enough to hold a conversation“ - the rest being natives.
---
If there are enough German/French/Italian/etc players, Blizzard will eventually give them a separate server if enough people are playing Classic. Remember, they are only estimating the amount of interest there will be.
---
Digga was für ein HuSo du bist mit deiner arroganten Art.
---
This is new.  People have been referring to live WoW as “retail” for years in the private server scene.
---
Calling it a game is generous.
---
I can't believe it took till WoD for us to get Oceanic servers.  I'd stopped playing by that point.  I've never seen my latency bar green.  Anything &lt;400ms was good.
---
I'll be pissed if we don't get local servers.
---
Just make a french speaking guild?
---
Speaking English is fine but most of France People for example will only speak france which means lack of communication and even with english language there are going to be things non native people wont understand
---
The swedes don't want to miss out on playing with english folks either, really. They still make their own guilds every now and then, but I've never encountered someone from scandinavia who didn't want to interact with other people. Their level of english proficiency is so high that it doesn't feel like a chore like it does for e.g. many Germans to speak english.
---
That shit has got to go
---
There's also a 10-level difference there. You might as well compare BiS Naxx gear to level 50 dungeon gear - of course the difference is going to be absolutely massive.
---
Damn well written, I agree 100%. Thanks for this!
---
The problem is the "official" vs. "non-official" part. When you join the game and you do not read reddit/the boards before selecting your realm, you may land upon a server where the majority speaks a different language because its a "non-official"-whatever-language server. New players may need a while to realise they are on a different language server and do not want to begin again with on a different realm. So, instead of realms with only english speaking people, there will be realms with language clusters. And that quite heavily influences the classic feeling and community feeling. Thats the problem.
---
So, the better option to prevent this would be to announce languages for realms beforehand. Then, everybody can chose whether they want an english one where the language written is something else. Everybody expected this to be the common approach, because it is just a language tag in the server names. It does not change the location or any other configuration of the servers (blizz could announce that game support only is in english). So I understand the people who complain about this.
---
&gt;They're responsible on twitch for their fans
---
No they're not, dont be ridiculous. That's like saying football clubs are responsible for football hooliganism.
---
&gt;Mass reporting to ban/suspend your account.
---
Twitch viewers aren't organised, how the hell would someone make u banned like that. The only person that can organise stream viewers is the streamer, and they're not going to say their viewers to harass other players - because again, they could lose their job for that. And even then, if u're in .01% of people who got somehow hurt that way then it's not like contacting support takes longer than 30mins.
---
a quick search: torch is a lua framework for ML. ok it's possible
---
it stands or fall with the model quality.
---
Does England get their own server sent they are leaving the EU? :)
---
If you think this has nothing to do with the difficulty you are clearly wrong. Its obvious that things that are worked hard for are much more meaningful. And LFR loot doesn't feel good becouse bosses are so easy you can legit go afk and come back and grab the loot. 
---
I do not like the titanforging, of course noon does. But its not such a big deal. The game is fine. At least raids are challenging.
---
and if there is only say 3 pvp 3 pve and 1 RP?
---
Getthos forming in international servers is a different issue, but not having localised servers like we did in 2006 is bull\*hit.
---
Not having them 100% means non-english speakers will be in engluish servers and since they can't speak english, they won't.
---
English is common and yadda yadda but not everyone in europe speaks english.
---
Just make a specific native language guild then?   
---
Why sacrifice the server pop cuz you don't want to communicate with different cultures?
---
Yeah people bash on this, but honestly as long as world pvp is untouched I dont think crossrealm BG's are a big problem.
---
Unlike private servers where you have Euros, Chinese, Americans etc on the same server with active BG's 24/7, the official Classic servers will have parts of the day be very dead with long queues for BG's.
---
Crossrealm BG's attempted to fix a very real problem back in the day, and as you say, it makes dodging premades a lot more difficult.
---
Blizzard seems to think there is not enought people on germany and france to have dedicated server for those country. And oceanic server population is roughly equal to 35% of german server population so we can assume that blizzard will not want to spend for a server for oceanic. 
---
I really hope for you that you get one for oceanic regions tho, it sucks to have high ping.
---
The amount of salt in this sub is nearly getting unbearable
---
RP Servers will basically be dead unless there's strict language requirements.
---
That's not at all how it works. They don't run each realm on individual servers anymore, with or without layering. It's all cloud hosted (or whatever it's called), and they can expand it as needed if they add more layers or if they add more realms, same thing. Only thing layering does is change the end user experience.
---
It's definitely possible, the *real* problem is the performance issues you're running into.
---
Prime example right here. Sorry to hear that, hope you can make up for it in classic!
---
the bombs disorient is very useful for your damage / getting heals off.
---
I agree completely.
---
Regarding the locked threads, I think some of the (presumably American) mods are unused to what I perceive as friendly neighbourhood EU banter. Most of them are locked for bigotry, and certainly there is bigotry, but I don't know, in my experience, mild racist stereotypes are par for the course when nationalities across Europe discuss any topic. People don't really take offense because there's not a clear hierarchy in Europe, so it's not like one country is being picked on in particular. It's all fun, far as I can tell.
---
As someone currently working on getting a german guild together i'd be interested into where they are even supposed to get together because all i can find are international english speaking discords and subreddits for guild recruitment.
---
Yes, I know they can be stubborn (especially french...) but if they don't have the choice to play classic they will adapt. Even now in wow retail if you wanna do some PvE with randoms (Mythic+) -&gt; English (yes you can chose to have only a selected language but good luck to find your group without waiting 1h)
---
I'm french and I don't want to speak with you. Sorry
---
&gt;Keep population caps at the original vanilla value and reintroduce Battlegroups to deal with too long queus.
---
This is the perfect example of rose tinted glasses.
---
Classic will never let you relive your vanilla experience.
---
2019 is a different time - if we can have 8k players on a server after layering is done - YES please - it doesn't mean there will be 8k online at all times... battle groups may not work if they only have a handful of servers after the "tourists leave"
---
I think the only cool pet I had was the Rocket Chicken, and that was from the TCG which came after Vanilla.
---
He just won the recent lvl 30 tourney
---
It's a result of a lot of compounding changes over the year. Flying mounts, more portals and lower Heartstone cooldown, more flight paths, instant teleport to dungeons, phasing, different zone and quest design, less importance on profession materials which force players out into the world and a hundred different changes.
---
Classic is very unforgiving when it comes to a lot of mechanics, and if you attempt to play the game solo like BfA you wont get far.
---
ew i would never want to play with someone that can't even speak 4 different languages. I mean, cmon its 2019 what are we some kind of anglophone... disgusting.
---
Legit though! Fury Warriors don't have assigned sets back in that dat. You gotta mismatch some weird shit and keep up that hit rate. Spreadsheet legit needed.
---
Like i said, thats a valid argument and im not saying that my opinion is better than yours amd if they backtrack on it im completely fine with it. Get it? I just dont think its fair to come up with all this conspiracy theories on why blizzard did it when they clearly said why they did it. If you disagree with their reason thats completely fine, just dont pretend that they didnt give an explanation for it which is what people are doing.
---
And leave my friends behind? Sign me out. Id rather have International servers then.
---
This. However innocuous it might seem if you only think about the big European languages, meaning English, Spanish, French, German and arguably Italian, then there's still so many more. If everyone communicated exclusively in their own language, it'd be a mess to say the least.
---
You really, really underestimate how many people dont want to or can speak english.
---
I learned English playing Starcraft, Diablo II and Dota so I do agree with you.  
---
But those games aren't comparable to Wow.  
---
When my grandpa died as I was 13 I logged back to wow and went to play with my lvl 21 hunter friend, we talked for hours, bounded and he helped me go through something difficult.  
---
That's the beauty of wow you really can build deep relationship.  
---
But getting deep in a foreign language you don't master really well is really tough, same goes with Humor.  
---
I've travelled a bit in the world, and I can tell you french have a particular humor, quite dark and gross you'd say but it's our humor and I've noticed foreign people just don't get it.  
---
This is a tiny but real example.
---
I bet they will get alot of enjoyment out of this.
---
They mean that lots will drop off throughout the lvling. Not that there is too little content
---
Is it possible to work in a non-professional setting?
---
Exactly the same? Of course not.
---
Not sceaming about a streamer on the server? 100%
---
Pretty much this. People can't grasp that times change, people change and systems change.
---
Streamers weren't big back in the day, but they would have been if given the opportunity.
---
We just need to be accepting and enjoy what we can enjoy.
---
The problem is that Blizzard's decision to not have language based realms for the EU is based on a 90% dropout rate for Classic WoW.
---
1 million players in the EU, at launch, is not a far fetched number. However, if 90% of the quit, that leaves only 100k.
---
And 100k players means 6, maybe 7 realms in the EU, hence, a language based realm is not only not needed, but it might end up as a low pop realm.
---
Blizzard also believes that MOST of those 1 million players will be RETAIL players, hence, the massive 90% dropout rate. Basically, Blizzard believes that LESS than 100k players will be Classic players, and 900k+ will be Retail players that will QUIT the game very early.
---
Blizzard is out of touch with reality. I personally expect way over 1 million Classic players at launch, on top of the hundreds of thousands (close to a million) from Retail, that will be present at launch.
---
Even if all retail players quit Classic, that still leaves over 1 million Classic players.
---
And even if half of those quit (which is a normal expectation) , that still leaves over 500k Classic players for the EU.
---
Blizzard is STILL skeptical on Classic popularity. And they are dead wrong.
---
But, once the name reserve starts on August 13th, Blizzard will change their mind, drastically, when they will see MILLIONS of people resubing to WoW only to reserve a name.
---
Something I see thrown a lot around here is "having to walk back". This issue can be circumvented using the command /camp which logs you off, and upon reentry teleports you to the dungeon entrance. This takes all in all about 30 seconds at most.
---
wow helps you finally learn english properly! that can only be a plus
---
&gt; spend a little less on localization 
---
There is no localization to do...   
---
All you have to do is to mark some servers as X Language. Done.
---
Druids are amzong at wpvp and 1v1 fights. They have a high skill ceiling because you have to utilize more of your kit than any other class to maximize your power. Even if you are balance you will want to know when to stealth in cat form and heal up and go to bear form to survive. 
---
As the top comment said, you dont win fights by out bursting people but by outlasting and slowly wearing them down. If you try to beat a class and only use a feral abilities you will likely lose because you aren't a rogue or a warrior, you are a druid that can play like a rogue when its beneficial and then root someone to run away and heal. 
---
The same goes for Balance druid, you can do some decent dmg but it's not like a mage or warlock. You will need to mix in heals to beat true casters. And kiting is still a viable tactic against casters. In tbc to beat frost mages as a boomkin my strat was actually to run around and kite their water elemental until it was gone or I could stealth and restart a fight. It seems odd to run so much while fighting but that is your strength and if you ignore it and try to out mage a mage you will lose.
---
I recommend nature swiftness specs for group pvp so you can provide dps while supporting your allies. 
---
Somthing like https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#0tRx0MVsxZxecoco
---
Or https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#0ZeMMsfbkxxvboco
---
Forgot who I was posting to, let me dumb it down further...
---
Make expansion for classic , get paid. 
---
No new expansion, don't get paid.
---
They get the sub regardless.
---
Because socializing and chit-chatting is on a different level than reading a few English articles, watching an American streamer and spamming nonsense in the Twitch chat?
---
The feeling of being included (in a community) might harder or impossible to reach for non-native English speakers.
---
Idd
---
I NEED EPICZZ !!
---
I have 156 ms in Canberra on nbn to the test servers
---
I thought it was confirmed to not work on beta/classic.
---
Are more threads gonna help? No
---
According to https://realmpop.com/eu.html 25% of max level players on BfA are on German Servers (roughly 1 million).
---
According to http://www.warcraftrealms.com/eu_realmstats.php?sort=LanguageID there were 67k online on German servers during the last 30 days according to the sum on the website the total amount was 408k players in the last 30 days, when I added up the numbers myself I got 320k. So German players make up something in between 21% and 16%
---
I take German population as an example because it is the biggest nationality in Europe in population (not considering Russian). So depending on the estimate of how many people will play Classic long-term, we can also estimate how many Germans there will be playing. I'd say 100k total in Europe would be a rather conservative estimate. If we take the rather low estimate of 16% Germans, we would end up with 16k players, which would be 5 full vanilla servers at ~3k each. Whether or not there will be enough for an RP server is another question, but they would probably be happier with ~1k on a German RP server than on an international one, which is full.
---
I want to say it was the most recent Classiccast.
---
Best professions for Mage?
---
It's really sweet, thank you.
---
But for me, it is mainly about confort. I know I will speak less and so, be less sociable, if I'm not in a fench speaking realm. Also, I'm sure it will be unofficial localised langage realm.
---
And if I'm tired, I will be even less motivated to speak in english. Maybe it look not it is, but it's still very exhausting for me to speak in english (and also frustrating, because I lack of vocabulary sometimes).
---
I thought Blizzard were copying the BG method from the end of Vanilla as they are working from 1.12? Has there been a blue post saying otherwise? Either way I'm not too bothered, I'll be queuing in a group.
---
Yes, but that‘s the crux with classic - you are bound to the people on your realm! 
---
As much as I‘d love for everyone to study English (the future is now, etc.), it is just soooo much easier to look for people on your realm that share the same mindset: why learn something new when you can achieve everything in the game with your own XY-speaking guild? Way easier. 
---
People tend not to invest in new skills when it isn‘t 100% necessary, sadly.
---
Lol I'm fucking stupid, totally misread it
---
15k is going to be a real thing when layering is removed.
---
6 hour queues or free transfers to dead servers... 15k is perfectly fine since they won't 100% be online at all times.
---
they said end of phase 1 **maximum**, most likely for the [first few weeks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYuUD0o-Nz8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=317),i dont get why people always say its guaranteed to last the entirety of phase 1
---
I don't know how many times that damn northshire citadel has been reposted...
---
Back in 2006 I was playing on Agamaggan. It was basically a Spanish server.
---
It got so bad that every whisper had 80% chance to be in Spanish.
---
Westfall chat was basically:
---
¿Alguna para DM?
---
Streamer man bad
---
Finally someone gets it.  Layering isn't about accommodating a bunch of people at once, its about keeping server population high enough that they don't implode once the rush dies down.  Your realm ends up with a huge population?  That's not too bad.  Worst case you split it and go with your friends and guild to where ever they decide.  Your realm ends up with low population?  That's really bad.  No amount of pushing will get people on to that low pop realm once they know it sucks.
---
I plan to spend the majority of my time in AB, gonna make a pvp guild called Lumbermill Defense lol. Just gonna through people off cliffs all day. Would be better with like 5 priests too
---
"One might think it's not that much of a problem but although everyone speaks basic english, the most spoken languages in europe are still german and french which will make trade chat quite interesting"
---
This isn't really relevant as the WoW playerbase is not split exactly the same as country population.
---
There isnt a lot of data available but https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/WoW_population_by_country
---
Shows some info about retail realms. 
---
Blizzard have the data on how much percentage of player drop off they get after a few months of game release.  (This will likely be higher in classic) as retail players go back to playing retail. 
---
Blizzard is simply estimating that once the servers settle into their regular playerbase, these servers won't have high enough population.
---
https://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf
---
Maybe ya'll fucks can learn basic english, it's 2019 do you really need to communicate in your mother language online STILL?
---
I'm not so sure about that. They are well aware that people would rather just have no changes, they are doing it because they understand that there is a problem. They won't change their mind about the problem being real, and rightfully so. This means if all they see are whinny people that don't understand what layering is nor even the underlying problem (and reading comments on this sub proves that almost no one even knows exactly why we have layering). If Blizzard sees this they will not try and change it, they will see it as "they just don't understand it, but this is necessary for the success of Classic". They will take the "we know better" stance. What we instead should show them is that we *know* what layering is and we see the underlying problem it tries to solve, but we don't want their current solution for it.
---
&gt;as long as Blizzard sees, that it's on people's mind, they'll put resources in their hands to at least \*try\* and alleviate the issue or fix it
---
The problem is when people just whine without knowing what they talk about Blizzard won't see it as an issue. It will not be seen as something "to fix". It wouldn't exactly be the first time Blizzard takes the "we know better" stance. That's what I'm afraid will happen.
---
It's called having fun
---
You summed it up pretty well. My thoughts exactly!
---
Its not that we Need it, its just Not the same experience. 
---
They dont even Need layering anymore, according to a Survey, 70% of the Players wont even Play classic anymore.
---
If they would just limit it to one layer hop per hour, or even per day, that would largely solve the problem.
---
You would still be able to invite your friends over or join your friends (since you stick to your layer) but this kind of abuse would be more or less completely eliminated.
---
Literally one of the major reasons this is going to suck. Damn.
---
Thank you for your advice.
---
We will still open them until mods will get the idea, or until Blizzard rectify this issue.
---
Which will be rectified after August 13th.
---
This is a diagram created by someone who didnt play classic or isnt from EU.
---
I played classic. I never bumped into or ever ran into an issue with language barriers or this "enclaving" you talk about. Everyone spoke english. There were a lot of Danish guilds on my server - I was in one. They would stop people talking Danish in the guild chat and ask you to speak english. The same was the case for /1 and /2
---
The only time I ever saw non english speaking was when I joined a party to do a quest.
---
It made absolutely no difference to me at all that my server had a high Danish population. It made no difference to my Danish friends that they often had to speak English.
---
This language issues is a total non issue. Worry about layering instead.
---
you are probably spot on, we are turning old and its showing!
---
Blizzard is looking at this subreddit. The more complaint going on there is on it, the better. If it gives me 1% more chance of having a good game I will spam this board to death.
---
I didn't play on that server (for a good reason), so that's why I support the push for official language specific realms. I don't want to end up at one such Drak'thul by accident. I think it is already quite likely taht one realm will end up being at least 50% CZ/SK, I bet the people at current DT will coordinate somehow and many will follow the big guilds for obvious reasons. They will try to keep a big recruitment pool at one server.
---
I had the same issue during the stress tests. It’s still in development.
---
Or they will just not play the game. Its not about ability but more about the willingness. I personally don't want to play classic on an English realm.
---
Exactly, Blizzard still is blind to reality. The incompetency is staggering
---
You forgot the part where real discussion posts get like 300+ comments but 50 up votes....
---
Why dont they just prompt us with a box to choose which layer we want when invited? "Stay or leave"
---
They're a bunch of tightwads who hate Shrek.  Imagine the kind of person who hates Shrek.  That's who is making the decisions, you almost feel bad for them.
---
I mean lvl 30 os like 1 or 2 weeks casual, if you dont notice all the chat isnt in english by then its your fault. If the server is the "oficial" server you will have people talking in that lenguaje troghout, its not like people will be talking english the first 20 levels and then at 30 change.
---
Its great that people are coordinating to pick up the slack from blizz, since it will make it obvious wich servers will be controlled by who pretty early.
---
Which is what they will do. Also exactly what "forming enclaves" means and what you denied would happen in your initial post and which comes with its own host of issues (people complaining about other language in chat, insulting one another over it, you having less potential people to play with, because you don't speak X Y or Z, etc. etc.)
---
You're dumb. 
---
Because you don't get it.
---
I'm gonna tell you anyways cause you are a pre-emptive dismissing bitch trying to avoid it which is just going to perpetuate the bitch behavior that caused you to make that dumb uninformed comment.
---
Servers in data centers are in massive units that have blades, where a single blade has tons of cpus on it, probably dual xeon type processors, with upwards of 40+ cores on a blade, probably 5+ blades per rack mounted server.
---
They run an array of virtual machines on this, which are the servers.  The resources needed to return a certain latency to the end client, like &lt;100ms to you, the user, requires a certain amount of speed on a single threaded process (a single core).  Most of the latency is already tied up in the travel time for the packets across the network so the CPU can't afford to spend/waste any time on any processing that prevents the flow of information.  It has to return decision lightning fast, like with less than 20ms latency, probably even lower.
---
Layering is done because they can't split the process into multiple threads for one area where a group of players are all doing the same thing, involved in the same thing.  They can split the server itself into multiple threads though, because certain databases are all that tie it together, like the auction house, etc.... not much really ties it together in a static way.
---
The amount of players a single thread/single core can handle is not much different on a virtualized server scaled over 40 CPUs than it is on a hardware server with 4 cores running only one or two servers.
---
It scales across all their resources, so they essentially spend the same on hardware cost regardless of how they do it.  The layering thing is more for how they manage the single core limitation of too many playres in one place at a time, which is where you will see players lag out, the animations stop responding, etc... because your client stopped receiving data from the server because the single thread/core is now overwhelmed, and cannot keep up.  That's what their stress tests are for, to test the limitation of the single thread/core.
---
There's no difference in cost to them from a hardware perspective.  This is about management and design.
---
Dumb shit.
---
Back then... it was hard due to lag since so many were using either low cable, shit DSL, satellite, etc. It was pretty tough back then just because of this, disconnects, lag and not moving in time, etc. I imagine it may be a walk in the park as long as gear is decent. If there were 10 new people, I'd imagine you'd be fine. If there were 20 new people, I'd be concerned. Lol.
---
They are never going to go to this level of effort and spend just so they can turn around and say I told you so. Get real.
---
I'm surprised people are so offended by this. I've submitted much briefer resignations for much pettier reasons. Is it just Americans freaking out because they're immediately homeless if they're out of a job?
---
Link?
---
Sure, for some countries it would not be as easy to decide. Spain and Italy are probably in that fringe area at the moment, at least considering that the overall estimation (by Blizz) of active players seems to be rather low ... but Germany and France? Dunno, seems pretty clear to me what to do.
---
For western people English is a lot easier to learn than Chinese
---
If I understand right what you are describing is sharding, layers are effectively copies of the entire world not just zones.
---
Yup &amp; nobody wants to get kicked from a raid after you spent 2 hours wiping on the first boss cos people just shoot down all the barrells an waste theM!!!!!!
---
Funny thing is, the streamers are going to get shit on by some of the OGs - should be fun to watch.
---
As a French, I played in a few french guild on a few international private servers, and every time, i would say about half didn't knew any English at all outside of a few words like "hello".  
---
You can always try to communicate with emote, but that's basically like 1 horde and 1 alliance trying to communicate.
---
Thank you for being on the topic, I still hope it gets changed. 
---
I will just ignore the last part because I am happy for people like you xD
---
yeah maybe i will, maybe i'll see you there sweeping the floors! :D
---
&gt;If anything, we should have 5k pop servers, sharding before 20, and no layering at all.
---
Nope - 15k is a good cap, it's 2019 and there won't be 200 servers.
---
Layering is fine to ensure a solid launch, I rather be able to quest than tab target for 50 actual minutes. 
---
Playerbase will drop off more than 50% because fortnite kids and catakids WILL get bored when they don't get the boar meat on the first 20 kills.
---
There are too many other games to play and future games to play, for the majority of classic wow to be playing in 4-6 months.
---
Because it implies that it is something that is legitimate and sold for profit. The opposite of private servers.  
---
That's what I would guess at least.
---
But can't you understand that people in a mmo want a bit more than 'carry an understandable' conversation?
---
They are reacting that way because it is a simple thing to add and it shows that blizzard have little confidence that classic will do well.
---
I played EU-Blackmoore which is completely German speaking and I'm not sure what kind of problems you are referring to?
---
Making new expansions for classic also requires money. I would wager that the cost is higher than remaking TBC. So from a money standpoint it's a safer bet to remake TBC than try something new.
---
Yes but a server has multiple layers so theres no way they expect to only have 3k per server
---
I am german and wouldn't want to play on a german server for this reason, but many others think differently. English is an international language, and an english server doesn't mean just brits, it means everyone that speaks english. I will be playing on an english server, you'll have plenty of cultures interacting with each other, and you can always choose a guild that has many people from everywhere. That's what I did!
---

TBF thats mostly Americans. Most Brits are a bit better informed about European/French history. 
---
Also, huge Brexit and discussions about the EU itself, though.
---
Yea ninja looters should be banned if they do it more than once or twice.
---
Oh GOD.
---
And it was going so well for Classic.
---
Welp, there will be private Classic Servers in the future now. They'll be propped up to support (A. Free play obviously, and B. Specific Languages).
---
How to shoot yourself in the foot 101. I suspect there's some sort of infrastructure limitation behind this decision. But I'd rather we hear about that than just telling us this is how it's gonna be.
---
You're delusional... It's not like forming an enclave. It's like living in a foreign country, and speaking your own national language in your own closed house.
---
Its to get to clear casting, since Improved Arcane Missiles is useless.
---
I like this spec for leveling on a PVP server and for doing dungeons: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#ofMVMobZxgGzbzut0h
---
I also like getting Improved Scorch but I feel like mobs die too fast for it so it’s only really useful for boss fights.
---
Kargoz 1-60 on youtube
---
Would you rather they didn't and left your unofficial German server with 60% of players gone and wild horde/alliance imbalance alone?
---
Agree with you on that.  So what the other person is saying is Bob Ross and his followers are not all together?  If you don't like it, don't freaking watch it.  Stop being a follower.
---
Such a good post, only later I noticed the names, perfect.
---
I believe the difference between Spell Hit % is so you dont MISS your spells, and Spell Penetration (up to 100 ?) which makes your target NOT RESSIST your spells. Correct me if im wrong.
---
Like mate, on private servers there are people speaking russian/chinese/Spanish exclusively, and somehow it's not a huge problem for people there. Luckily, Russians, Latin Americans, and Chinese will all not be on the european ones.
---
Lets not pretend the game isnt easy mode regardless of dynamic respawns. We are way past 100% vanilla like, and Im almost certain we will have more than 3k per server
---
Good luck having the same experience when taking french, german and spanish people to the mix.
---
Don't expect to log in and raid if you haven't prepped for it before the raid - as long as you have consumables, the right spec and don't afk every 5 minutes you'll be able to raid. I suggest finding a guild rather than looking for pugs - especially if you want to raid within the first few months.
---
Yes but say a German player roles on a EU server and everyone is in English typing, he just assumes all EU realms speak English because it's the "universal" language. He hits lvl 30 in 2 weeks cos he works a lot every day an only plays an hour or 2 a day. He finds out from an IRL friend that a realm is full of German players.
---
I think a lot of people wouldn't bother to re-roll after that.

Where did you get those login numbers?

BuT iTs PaRt Of ClAsSiC
---
I'm in favor of every language getting their own server. Hell, give the italians a few too. Maybe one to the portuguese too, who knows?
---
The only reason why I'm so insistent on the main language being english is that while german and french might be bigger languages in Europe, english is the language you can expect everyone to speak.
---
You wouldn't assume a lithuanian person and a portuguese person to both speak portuguese, because that incredibly unlikely. But because of english being such a culturally important language in the west, you can reasonably assume both will be able to converse in english.
---
I'm not saying englis is the most spoken language in europe, but what I am saying is that it's more likely that any two european persons will speak english than any other european language. And that's because most people were taught some kind of english in school, or have been exposed to english through the internet.
---
There's a reason so many online spaces shared by different nationalities tend to resort to english. Everyone speaks english on online EU servers, for example. I don't think I have ever seen an EU server on any game where the language spoken isn't english.
---
Even if i am fluent in english as a French and i listen/watch english content mostly, it doesn't mean i am ok with EU servers. I want a French server because it's more fun to play with people you can easily meet in real life. 
---
Fact is, I played 3 years on retail vanilla/TBC and some friends i met there became my coworkers, and we are still friends 14 years later, we even go to vacation together. I played 3 years on a pserver, in a guild with swedish, english, dutch and german players, even if i talk to them everyday via skype, i have never met them.
---
We all hoped to build a community, and it's easier to build a community in your native language.
---
Community = friendship, rivalry, drama. Playing on a EU server means you'll just don't care about the people you'll play with, i'll never met them 100% sure.
---
In addition, most French don't speak english and now will be reluctant to play on such server. It's a bad marketing move. If a French want to play on a EU server, he could have go on a UK one anyway.
---
There are a few points I'd like to say:
---
* Adding new servers is infinitely easier than trying to "fix" broken servers through mergers. If classic has the population to support language specific realms, then giving players the option to migrate to those realms post launch does more to keep both the old server and the new server alive.
---
* Rerolling happened quite a bit even in retail vanilla, and F R E S H was a thing back then too, even if the meme didn't exist yet. Many new realms had players from older realms reroll and dominate the server first raiding scene as a medium sized fish in a tiny pond. If the demand for language specific realms is there, people are often willing to reroll and reform their communites.
---
* Shifting the lingua franca of a server to German or French severely limits the number of people who are able to play on it. While most people do speak at least one other European language fluently, that's English more often than not. English servers can host a number of language specific communities that are still able to interact with each others thanks to the lingua franca. Just because you're not able to communicate with everyone in your mother tongue doesn't mean you won't be able to communicate at all. You have to consider not only your own language skills, but those of other people as well.
---
* If you want to play in a more secluded community, I'm certain that many language specific guilds will form on servers. This was true in original retail vanilla and is on pservers. It will happen in classic as well.
---
That being said, I'm happy that Russian gets their own language specific servers. Speaking fluent English is less common in russia, and the Cyrillic alphabet isn't even visible on the original english client (just like Chinese characters aren't either). The language barrier is 10 times worse between Russian and non-cyrillic languages.
---
This has always been the best defense strat for LM. Just hide in the bushes and MC people off the cliffs.
---
You can also hide in the interior of boats/zeppelins and MC people off when it's far out into the water, causing them to die of fatigue
---
Everyone who says this was going to take it slow anyway. Getting to 60 is no joke and it's going to take close to at least 10 days for the vast majority of players.
---
I've played enough Overwatch to realise that the average level of random european people in english isn't that great.
---
So yes I don't have any fear that people will manage to communicate well enough to finish UBRS but to have more meaningful conversation? I'm not that sure and in the end, isn't it one of the main reason play mmo? to have a community and not just group of people able to carry basic conversation?
---
I mean, it literally is a game.
---
Being a giant nerd in WoW makes you an alpha ?
---
I don't think they will not play the game just because of language issue. Especially for wow classic, most of the community are fans who just want to re enjoy this good old wow and won't stop here just because they are too lazy to speak in English. In most multiplayer game you don't have the choice anyway.
---
Once you consider you'd split that 70k by language AND PvE/PvP/RP/RPPvP(?) the numbers might start getting close to small servers. However, as I think you point out, that estimate is reliant on people subbed to this sub which is certainly a large underestimate, so maybe?
---
I'm seriously considering playing NA servers because of this. The thought of lvling on a server for that server to become a 'French only' or 'German dominant' is frustrating when I don't have that much time to sink into classic as it is. They should of just released one server for each said region, if they die out then surely they could merge them at a later date. It was bad enough on private servers with russian and chinese.
---
Why would someone pay for a classic expansion? Sure they will make sales, but if they force classic servers to an expansion - sayonara!
---
Blizzards success on classic doesn't depend on them "getting paid"
---
It's sole purpose is to keep subscriptions up from players that despise retail... and only that.
---
Suck sh1t :)
---
Questie, vanilla guide and cartographer.
---
I can understand peoples frustration on this topic and it does certainly take away from the original classic feel. However, I have been playing private servers for absolutely years in which none had options for this. The community was diverse and great in every server that I played on. 
---
Some of my greatest friends in wow would of never been in my guild in the first place if it wasn't for us all being chucked into one big EU bucket and left to get on with it. People saying /1 /2 is going to be a mess.... So what is it normally? Normally the most you see is a guild recruiting in their native language and the odd discussion between people. Why is that such a problem?
---
This community seems to be hell-bent on replicating classic exactly as it was. It will not have the player base that it had back then. Not everything can be run like it was before. 
---
Maybe I will be seen as bias as an English speaker but surely a larger server population on each of the servers is best for everyone? When I see a server start to die or a game itself, that is damaging. It starts demotivating everyone. If you all want classic to work and be successful, then I think that this is maybe, just maybe not the worst decision.
---
Yes, but we're still talking about Retail here, a game for which we have active data to track, like you just provided. I believe that Blizzard is just being careful, waiting to collect data from a stable Classic database. For me personally, it's better to wait and see what numbers of people from different nationalities will be playing, than making servers blindly and then having to server merge some. Notice that most of the decisions they make are in order to avoid a possible server merge in the future. 
---
I don't think they doubt in the numbers that classic will bring in, but they want to avoid the worst case scenario which would be a good number of people playing, but spread too thin over too many servers. You can be sure that if that were too happen, we'd be bombarded with conspiracy posts of how Blizzard planned this in order to facilitate more server transfer sales. I think they are being careful, which is something I greatly appreciate.
---
Okay, let's pretend that would happen.
---
You end up being one of the unlucky players that gets a very long server queue and you only get ingame after 1-2 hours. You're basically already very behind and can't do your rush to 60 with your route like you planned to.
---
Would you seriously accept that or would you suddenly start complaining about how bad blizzard is and how bad their launch is and that everything sucks and it ruined classic for you?
---
Because I am pretty damn sure, you'd be one of the first to complain about it, if you were one of the unlucky guys that becomes stuck in a queue.
---
You are way too hard in your privateserver mindset that has dynamic respawns. Classic didn't have dynamic respawns like you know them from privateservers, where everything can respawn within 15 seconds.
---
&gt;On live you most likely want to get to 60 fast 
---
What a modern WoW take.
---
&gt;An **enclave** is an area within a country or a city where people [live](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/live) who have a [different](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/different) [nationality](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/nationality)or [culture](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/culture) from the people [living](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/living) in the surrounding country or city. 
---
????
---
They won't just speak it in their "own house", but I think arguing with you over this is leading nowhere.
---
When classic drops won't pservers be shut down by blizzard??
---
Nobody will care about anything in August and everyone will forget about layering in October.
---
They were never in the same layer. That's the main problem. If I say come to Org to fight alliance and you don't seem them. That's a game breaking issue. 
---
More people will quit over layering than would have quit due to dead servers or queues.
---
What about the other countries whose language isn't included in the special bunch that gets their own servers? I'm from Finland so I was forced to speak/interact in English or alternatively not play. I never "looked for fellow nationals". And years later I can say that simply because of Wow I am very fluent in English, to the extent that when in voice I'm often assumed to be from England. Mainly due to the numerous friends I talked with, majority of whom live in England. Even as a 14 year old starting out in Azeroth, I got my message across even though it wasn't my mother tongue.
---
I really can't see many downsides to having English-only servers. Whether it's making new friends abroad, or getting better at speaking or writing English, it benefits you in more ways than you can imagine.
---
There are plenty of people that work dead end jobs where professionalism isn't a think and a resignation letter wouldn't even make sense. Fast food workers, many retail workers, and many other jobs.
---
When you work a JOB you don't need to be a professional. You're a warm body there to conduct a specific task. If a letter of resignation makes sense, most of the time that's a CAREER and you should really take things like your resignation letter more seriously.
---
The majority of players are not in this sub though (and never will be). The problem is that the majority or at least a very substantial amount of players will be unable/uncomfortable speaking English and don't want to go through the hassle.
---
My family also speaks English well enough to watch movies in English, which I do all the time. But together we always watch them in German because to them it is too stressful and they'd rather take it easy. Just because you can, does not mean you'd enjoy it (as much).
---
Most people here in Germany should have learned English at school. But since movies are dubbed and games are released in German, many people forgot what they have learned. Or they are afraid to speak English because they might make mistakes.
---
On the other hand Germans use a lot of words that sound like English but have some other meaning (Handy &gt;&gt;&gt; cell phone, Street Worker &gt;&gt;&gt; social worker, cola light &gt;&gt;&gt; diet coke).
---
BTW, I was taught English at school but I learned the language by watching movies, reading books and playing games in English. My Grammar and spelling are a train wreck but most of the time people know what I mean ... well, I hope they do.
---
30 percent is a really generous estimate. Pservers are people so dedicated to the game they sought out a way to play it when there was none and even then only 30 pervent made it to 60. Blizzard once quoted that less than 10 percent of players make it past level 11. I believe it will be a little higher this time, but still I don't think that more than 15 percent will make it to 60 long term.
---
Retail players *visible disgust*
---
Solution: All europeans should play on US servers and not speak english at all to prove the point and  to make blizzard realise what we mean.
---
Planning to group level with a priest and warrior. Is ST Frost the best spec for this? What would be my ideal rotation as I level with this in mind?
---
It looks like you're not factoring in Chinese or Korean realms during this time period?
---
Companies exist to make money. If Blizz knows they can make money off of classic they have no reason to want it to fail. The anti blizzard circkejerk in this subreddit is hilarious.
---
Lol no - there is no failing with classic. Shitball mmorpgs have players in 2019.
---
Lol. This right here is why everyone seems so panicked about layers. Y’all think they’re going to keep them around.
---
Tbh I don't know, both options will kill the server. But server merges are exactly the kind of shit that ruins communities.
---
Posting so can come back.
---
Blizzard has a much bigger market research department than you do. 
---
They aren't basing their decision making based on beliefs.
---
There is a good reason why they think a majority will only play it for a few weeks.
---
Layering, the slayer of world pvp, friendship and community
---
CZ/SK, HU and RO players wouldnt go to German/French/Spanish server. If there are none, everything will be mixed up, creating even bigger mess.
---
Of course, there is zero chance for Eastern EU language specific servers
---
Tailoring/Enchant or like Engineering/Tailoring (imo)
---
I see many people in threads about this saying "people should just learn english" or "it's not my problem that they can't talk with anyone", but I feel like that ignores the *real* issue. This will potentially form small sub communities on some realms that exclude themselves from the full community due to a language barrier. This essentially mean that the community will be smaller, not unlike if a server has low pop - except you do see the people, you just can't communicate properly.
---
People won't learn english just to play WoW when they can just join a French / German / \*insert country\* guild and stick to their own little part of the community.
---
Seriously, there are what, 3k on a realm? Blizzard can't possibly be so dumb as to think there won't be 3k German players or 3k French players.
---
Frenchies were a problem as well, a minor one compared to Russians and Chinese, but still there. Vehement unwillingness to speak english - even if they are perfectly fluent.
---
This is uncannily accurate.
---
Bravo.
---
Private servers managed 13k pop launches (more than blizzlike pop) without it
---
But please, tell me more about how necessary it is!
---
"You" had fun with it is the really important aspect here. It is very subjective ... many will not enjoy it. Either because they are not able to or they feel it's too stressful for a game. Either way, it's not Blizzards job to get people to learn a language.
---
Same here I’ll refund my boost too
---
Yes, my God was kinda like this
---
I mean private servers right now have a ton of different nationalities in one server and its not a big deal
---
I think it is a bit of cost cutting and Blizzard just not giving a damn. I vividly remember everyone in german &amp; french community as well as community sites pissing on Blizzard all the time for ignoring the feedback from the EU playerbase and just having braindead gms handling tickets. I was always buttflustered by the sheer difference in quality in Blizzard customer service in Europe compared to the US.
---
If I remember correctly, Blizzard also fired a lot of their EU staff. There might just be the reality that Blizzard just can't support multiple language servers because the staff isnt there and the suits higher up don't want to greenlight more money.
---
&gt;  If you don't learn English in school to the point where the average person can hold a conversation with people outside of your country, blizzard is doing you a service by INTEGRATING you guys with the rest of the world!
---
Ican speak English, that does not mean i want to do it during leisure time. And there is more to a language that a tool for communication. There's a whole world of culture behind it, worldplay, reference, history etc ...
---
English is the common denominator, it's practical but the culture that come with it is not very interesting compare to the French culture that come with French. I can't tell if it's the case for scandinavian country.
---
Fire talents are pretty much a no brainer, just take things that gives you damage. Arcane subtly is different, it reduces the resistances that players/mobs have. Honestly the math is really weird and stupid, but it's worth taking and there's not much of a better alternative.
---
Nope - play BFA or the next expansion.
---
Classic exists for 1 thing - playing official vanilla servers.
---
The end.
---
Lots of Germans as well that do the exact same thing. On *3 we had 1-2 German guilds that would have liked to raid with other players but felt there is a language barrier.
---
The difference is, the Germans don’t try to randomly talk to strangers in German.
---
Blitzkreigfun, that's a good name.
---
Or we could hope for the exact opposite: if realmlist is never released until the last moment people will not have enough time to organize and we will end up with server with very mixed community (my personal hope).
---
Both have Advantages - both have disadvantages. I'm not sure - I think both are fine. 
---
IDC
---
0 hype in Russia? A lot of private servers were 25% Russian so that’s surprising.
---
I was thinking about setting it as close to the place I end up farming the most so I can hearth sell items and get back to farming quickly.
---
This just makes me sad
---
He's trolling, no one is that retarded
---
12 million? Lol, no, it's nowhere near that anymore for these exact reasons.
---
As someone who has played WoW PS, DotA2, and PUBG. I hate tryingto coordinate when a language barrier is present, it's just a challenge that shouldn't be thier.
---
It's not really the same comparison, you're comparing language with location. It's a tough choice for Blizzard because they don't expect the swarm of players to last long term, having a bunch of dead specific language servers would be a real issue, because then it would push the remaining players to English realms anyway.
---
The standard English realms are obviously not just populated by people from the UK, I've played in many guilds with people from all over Europe and the vast majority of those players were not English first language speakers, including people from Germany, Portugal, Spain, Hungary, Bulgaria, Norway, Sweden, Finland, India, Denmark, Holland, France, Italy, Croatia and many other places, all playing together and speaking primarily English as a common language.
---
So it obviously works for many people, Blizzard have to evaluate whether the servers will last in the long run. The Oceanic discussion is more about latency than anything else, not as complex an issue.
---
Yeah I know, you are right. But I have a special argument for you. Like we all, I want WoW Classic to be like was WoW vanilla. And French speaking realm were a thing who also made that special experience for me.
---
Int is such a minor stat for casters that you really shouldn't worry about it. It's 59(?)-ish int to get 1% crit at lvl 60, that's just way way too much.
---
Hate to break it to you but they are going to make money off Classic whether it fails or not.
---
If you follow others to find YOUR enjoyments... y'cuda number 1.
---
Number 2 - you won't be playing classic after 3 months anyway so it doesn't matter, does it?

He was mentioning Lord Kazzak as an example of a limited resource that would not see the proper competition with sharding. Not as a specific cutoff point for when it would be removed. In fact the very next thing he says is that they are looking at sharding for the first few weeks.
---
IMO that is horse shit. We are already swallowing layering for the sake of server health. If that does not mean servers are healthy enough to support *a single* German, French and Spanish server, then that proves to me that layering does not achieve what it is supposed to achieve.

Here are complete informations about language usage in EU to get you in perspective https://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf
---
The vast majority, if not almost entirety, of people playing WoW who speak French, Spanish or German, also speak English as a second language. From my experience, the only people who don't speak English in those countries are 65+. That being said, players may wish to speak their mother tongue, but to say they can't or unwilling is almost certainly untrue. 
---
Source: Live in Austria and my German is so bad that I almost exclusively interact with people in English.
---
&gt; Unofficial EU specific language servers will pop here and there for the very few EU players
---
okay, only a handful of servers. no big deal
---
&gt;Now, the NA streamer problem is a huge problem especially for the likes of Soda or Asmongold
---
ah okay, only a handful of servers. what a big deal
---
I hope this gets a lot of attention. Super super important topic. Upvoted for visibility.
---
No they back tracked on that. I may last until the end of Phase 2 minimum which is months, probably longer.
---
Survival sounds a bit redundant. But the other three would actually work somewhat well. Especially brewing would be really nice, giving us another consumable sort of. Could easily be combined with cooking though, doesn't really matter.
---
&gt; Everyone speaks english in EU these days anyway
---
You'd think so.
---
We have maybe 10, both on alliance and horde. Guilds that are very active in retail., mythic 9+ We are planning world PVP and competition. Our guild on the horde side have already 2 full raid and there's more people on the alliance. 
---
I seriously hope you roll on our server.
---
It's a weird thing that whenever Blizzard does something anti-consumer/greedy, this is levied. Yes, clearly they need to make money, but Activision Blizzard does not sink from investing in 4 more classic servers with some language options.
---
They've also literally stated that they don't believe in the classic project, yet they're doing it because the demand is so loud. So yes, that's literally a favor to us.
---
Layering will still be around for most of the world, but the zones that have world bosses in them will be condensed onto a single layer so that there is only a single instance of that world boss on the server.
---
And those servers weren't enjoyable for weeks.
---
But please tell me how dumb your opinion is!
---
The issue isn't even that much about the language. The entire point of vanilla WoW and the reason IMHO it's actually better than retail is the community and the guilds which heavily depend on geographical location and shared language. I'm not going to organize an IRL meetup with a bunch of Norvegians and Spaniards speaking broken English. Half of the reason vanilla was so great was because at least a good percentage of your guild turned out to be literally a short drive away, you could spend the entire evening chatting with your guildies in TeamSpeak in your natural mother tongue doing random stuff and every once in a while you organized a meetup for the entire guild.
---
Well, I particularly hate it. Even in diablo.
---
I'd much rather have a WASD or arrow keys direction. Click to move is a recipe for carpal tunnel :(
---
Layering doesn't dynamically move people unless they join a group in a different layer.  Whatever layer you log into is your designated layer until you change continents or get invited by someone who knows you are in a different layer than them.
---
As an European player it's so frustrating... It's like we've been waiting for this for years, blizzard makes everything happens and then cheap's out on the very last aspect. Like just why. A couple additional server is not gonna kill your budget...
---
Wait, isn't this one a green in vanilla?
---
Mate. We bloody dub our movies in Germany. You expect us to talk English in WoW if we are lazy enough to watch Pulp Fiction in bloody German?
---
&gt; They're responsible on twitch for their fans 
---
They are, it is literally why some get banned off twitch, look up some rules about twitch. If you have no idea what you are talking about ie you don't know that twitch streamers get suspended for what their viewers do in their own chats and in other chats, you don't belong in this discussion. Don't make up shit to support your arguments, and don't argue things you have no knowledge of. 
---
&gt; Mass reporting to ban/suspend your account.   
---
&gt; Twitch viewers aren't organised, how the hell would someone make u banned like that. 
---
It happens all the time, even asmon and others have admitted that it happens...
---
Except England, ironically.
---
This seems to be the number 1 Argument.
---
It is the first day of the announcement. Do you seriously not think that the community will have come together before release and made "Inofficial" Servers pre Launch?
---
I think that sounds very reasonable just like the OP. I really dislike your agument m8 - it sounds like one of those first reaction arguments which then doesn't matter anymore after 1-2 weeks because People are not all sheep - some actually think
---
same
---
But that would be just for leveling, right?
---
What about PvP, making money, gear, professions, etc?
---
ok
---
This is so fucking typical of Blizzard.
---
Too late - August 26 / 27 nobody will care because they'll be playing- October nobody will remember because layering will be gone.
---
That problem would be solved by giving them a designated server.
---
It won't be suprising that realms will be taken over by Germans/French/Spanish that want to play in an environment where they speak their native language and even though I wouldn't want that myself, I don't blame them.
---
German servers will be a thing wether it's official or not, at least by making it official they would solve the problem of people having to find it if they want to play on it, or people randomly rolling on that server and having to transfer away.
---
So you are against spellbatching aswell?
---
All im saying is if you look im guaranteeing youll find it
---
Havent thought about that but you might be right about the european banter. I can relate when it comes to how many of us nordics mock one another.
---
Also having watched some french movies they have a great ammount of racial and gender stereotypes (done well, poking fun at just about everyone) that would never fly in the states.
---
They DONT want to merge servers at all...
---
You can choose specific layers, you want the layer your friend is on? Ask for an invite. Why would being able to pick specific layers compared to random layers be an advantage
---
What exactly made you assume that the OP was egocentric? The toxicity of your comment only strengthens some unhealthy stereotypes about the French.
---
Close. Spell Pen increases damage because resistances reduce the damage. You used to be able to stack negative resistances on your target, causing an actual increased percentage of damage, rather than just penetrating their resistances. Think like armor pen
---
That's what spellbatching IS.
---
So spellbatching?
---
Uhh, did you?
---
Bruh
---
True this. True classic wow would be a faded gray/white/ dusty CRT monitor with a white keyboard covered in dirt and grime in your families dining room.
---
OUR server. 1.5k already and the limit on vanilla was around 2.5k You would be in minority.
---
There is literally communities already forming Groups and agreeing on joining the same Server.
---
Anyone can give a Little thought and search before they choose a Server and they can surely avoid rolling on a purely German or French Server. 
---
It is literally not that difficult
---
&gt; Maybe try playing the game first?
---
I already did, for way too long as well. Gear has never motivated me to do anything.
---
&gt;If you cannot understand how getting rewarded after working hard toward a goal can be rewarding I dont know what to say. Generation instant gratification?
---
Bruh? Like Bruh? This is the subreddit where people circlejerk to the "JOURNEY"tm and "COMMUNITY"tm. Why the hell would you raid if not to beat the challenges the developers laid in your path. The gear is just something that helps you achieve these goals, I don't get off at night to logging off in the middle of SW or ORG showing my e-penis with my mythic raider gear. What the hell is wrong with you ...
---
Common sense is lost to big Corporations.
---
Screaming about the streamer on reddit 24/7 is equally pathetic
---
Yeah exactly the same for me I can handle wow with english speaking players, but it will sadly not be the same, and I will be less involved in social interaction.
---
Having English and "International" servers would probably be the best solution, taking account for post launch player reduction. A simple chat filter for public channels auto muting non English characters would do the trick in getting people to go the appropriate server.
---
Depends on your class. I remember class sourveis back in 05 and wow had an astonishing amount of warriors yet max level warriors were not that common. I took a closer look and saw that many warriors were in the mid 30ies range and then there was a steep decline in warrior population. Vice versa, you had a lot of rogues and mages at max level.
---
It’s no longer the Wild West of free speech it used to be. Have fun but be mindful of what you say.
---
&gt; It wont be a big deal
---
-people that speak English
---
Your opinion is your opinion. For me, and many other Germans, talking English in a social game is just not an option. You can talk about your long hard road to fluency all you want, but I'll speak German in classic.
---
You better not be on the designated German server because this mindset is very common.
---
No thanks, arena and pvp resilience gear ruined pvp
---
You have to be shitting me..
---
It was exactly like this in vanilla and you can see it in countless videos.
---
Because we all recognize this as Warchief Thrall.
---
Warchief thrall was a great character who loved the Horde and had a good head on his shoulders.
---
Cata and onward Thrall basically abandoned the Horde and just let everything go to shit without him.
---
Thrall could have prevented Garrosh and kept Sylvannas in check.
---
Awesome, I'll take a look when I get back from work. Thanks a lot!
---
He was organising events on a stress test server at the Arena. Great way to stress the server and have some fun. They were having big all against all fights to the death etc. People who got to STV needed to get into his layer to join in.
---
Or a monitor stand
---
It is an Advantage for OP and a lot of other Players (like me too).
---
It does make it more difficult for others. But there are already Groups forming and People deciding on joining the same Server. There will surely be "National" like realms. People will just have to inform themselfs and not just blindly pick to QQ afterwards. 
---
I really don't care about this Change AT ALL - because People are going to figure it out quite easy. I really don't see the Problem here.
---
People are just this way because it is the first day after the announcement... just chill the fuck out
---
After finishing the stress test in a 4-player group the entire way, fuck that. It was fun on there but on launch it would be like 10 times worse, doing the first couple of quests was **literally** impossible unless you were one of the very first people on.
---
I get what you're saying, cause I really did enjoy laughing with my friends as we fought over tags and 'set up perimeters' and shit, but there were some quests that even with layering and only a stress test far outside of the starting zones where most people start and end their play, which wouldn't be the case on launch either btw, where some quests were straight up not going to happen.
---
Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't want it to be so crazy that there is no competition for mobs at all or anything. But straight up launch with population limits as high as they are now and everyone and their mom having great connection and PC hardware, etc. It wouldn't be the same as the original vanilla launches (except the crashing and the like, that'll probably happen).
---
Of course. If you can make more gold per hour aoe farming than mining, why would you not buy the ore required for leveling?
---
That's because it is similar
---
I remember EU-Bloodscalp had a nickname Hunscalp, as there was mostly populated by hungarians (that and EU-Ragnaros). Thanks, but I'll skip... Its not that I dont wanna play with fellow hungarians, but I really dont want a nationality to overpopulate one server, creating ineviatebly division and segregation.
---
You got it the wrong way around, you dont leave them behind.
---
They left you behind by splitting into 3 servers, neither of which you can play on.
---
It was laggy ? Damn it's disappointing.
---
At this point i'm even considering staying on private server that don't have any layering nor lag. Such a shame that a few guys in their garage manage to do a better product than the whole Blizzard.
---
Yeah but even with a premade, if your server has an active PVP community you will still need to play 16 hours every day to reach R13+.
---
I think their reasonign could be something like 'It's easier for people to move to a language specific server in the future if game has high population' than 'Let's do server language specific and if not enough people keeps playing the game, let's move them all together in an EU (english) server'
---
The first decision is easier to take for teh user than to have impossed the second option. I hope if the game succeeds there will be specific server languages.
---
they're honourless bastards that really can go Fuck themselves.
---
MC even in vanilla was a 1-night thing once it was on farm.  Farm status will come pretty easily in classic so I expect most guilds to only use 1 night for raids until BWL (at which point it might be 1 night and part of another after on farm).  Won't be until AQ40/naxx where guilds actually would need 3+ nights to farm all their content.
---
Lok'tar friend, what is it you wish
---
Why not just watch movies in English? *Because Germans hate it*.
---
What do you mean too late? August 26 is over 2 months away. This is a super simple tweak.
---
&gt;I predict classic to have a minimum of 1 million players and up to 3 million prepared to join in day 1. How did i get such numbers? By looking at youtube guides for classic class guides and picking guides. Those are very specific videos that are quite long, and therefore we can assume a vast majority of the people watching this guide are people who will be joining in classic. video guides like those:
---
Not a chance - it's 2019
---
- there are plenty of quality games to play
---
- people exist outside of this sub
---
- plenty of people that don't want to pay $15 to play what they already did 15 years ago
---
- blizzard will show exactly the type of playerbase it expects when they release server names and numbers
---
1-3 million? Maybe world wide during the first week. NA nor EU will see those numbers.
---
Hype is a thing and people will be interested - once fortnite players and catakids see that you have to level weapon skills or that you can't hit 60 in 50 hours of play time - they will lose interest. 
---
And that's the majority.
---
And balancing was with leeway and shit ping in mind.
---
There’s a *big* difference between choosing which layer your friend is on and choosing between layer 2. 
---
Going to whatever layer your friend is on has been an exploit that’s been well known for weeks. His claim is that with his alt system he can choose the specific layer. 
---
I don’t know why it would be, but that’s his claim. Seriously did you guys not even listen to what he said?
---
I disagree.
---
I am German and have played on quite a few private servers. Even if there are some good German servers available, I always prefer an international one, since for me it's much more fun to play the game with people from many different countries.
---
Sure, communication might be a bit easier and people from the same country will often have similar values and expectations, but only playing with Germans (like I do on retail) feels more like a limitation than a benefit for me, since I feel people are not as patient and understanding, when they expect everyone to speak the same language and share share some similar values.
---
All international private servers I played on had at least 1-2 bigger raiding guilds for all the major spoken languages in Europe, so that was always a possibility, and while some people often had a harder time than others, most of the times people were nice to each other, trying for everyone to understand each other!
---
I will definitely play on an English speaking realm and I would love if it was a real mix of different nationalities, not only those who don't have their own realm and those few who want to play international, even tho they have their own realm!
---
Mention it once =/= 24/7
---
Settle down, it was a joke.
---
Simple answer: They don’t speak English just fine.
---
I mean you can point that law out to me if you want. But I have yet to see a written law that says that.
---
However, here is what I would hear as a recruiter.
---
1. I would ask my propspective employees for their last 2 employers. Especially if for for example their last employer's work was less than 6 months.
---
Then inform them I would like to contact them for references. If they say, that's the end of the interview process.
---
2. I contact their previous employers. Now maybe they as a policy only share written facts with me. Cos it keeps them right from wrongly expressing an opinion. They read out the above letter to me. I'm probably gonna flag this guy as a secondary preference if they even get a chance an interview.
---
3. Now if asked for the resignation and the employer spouts of a load of opinion. Then I shall determine that the employer is an asshole. That's why they left. I'm still lacking reference. But at least I know the reason first hand.
---
Egocentric; thinking only of oneself, without regard for the feelings or desires of others; self-centered.  
---
Because OP doesnt think about other communities and their desire. Don't have regards about the feelings of dissapointment with Blizzard blue post. He's self-centered.
---
I'm not french I'm Canadian.
---
Range classes were op as fuck against melees in classic.
---
This helped to balance that.
---
The company as a whole would never act that way, but individual employees definitely can.
---
Guys, there were not other language speaking EU realms back then. Everyone was on the same server. They are doing what has been asked
---
Priest:  Yes, it has spirit, priest ONLY...   =)
---
Same here. I might have understood grammar when I was at school, but it was being forced to use and speak English both written and spoken in World of Warcraft. It was to play or not to play and it allowed me to break that internal wall and become comfortable with the language, while a lot of my friends still encounter this issue. Not only that, because I played Arenas with many different people all around Europe and not only I've grown accustomed to various accents and actually made friends with many of them, from Norway, through Bulgaria all the way to Republic of South Africa.
---
Two reasons:
---
#1 They have no faith that there is enough interest to support national servers.
---
#2 They no longer have the needed size and skill of Customer Support for it
---
Duskwood Emerald Dream raid would be sick too.
---
Pogchampion
---
Well, how else where we supposed to get the true vanilla experience??? 
---
\#nochanges!
---
Alot of us have been saying layering is bad from the start, but we just get downvoted to hell because it goes against the hivemind of fanboys
---
This was a thing I noticed A LOT of streamers do. They can't stand a second of dead air.
---
Where is your mouse pad?  Need a smaller keyboard...
---
Because the content in Vanilla was created with world buffs. Then they decided it was too much of an hassle.
---
Pretty sure English is the most spoken language in Europe.  At least by number of people who speak it, not just by going on first language.
---
It's kind of funny how Blizzard simultaneously have a reputation for being money greedy bastards that don't care for the community and only want to milk their money *and* a reputation for actively spending money on a product the community want despite not believing that it will success.
---
What you can do is respecting the official server language and keep local to party and guildchat.
---
Exactly this and I have the same believes. Brazilians are divided between wanting a national server (that will have the same latency as NA server) or grouping up and joining an NA server. I'm on the side of joining a NA server because I don't believe Brazilians have the same feelings about Classic as other nations do, the game was very inaccessible for us at the time vanilla was launched... So I believe that if we receive a national server this will just make us play in a server that will be empty six months from now.
---
:D This Information is already made available the Minute you wrote that comment xD
---
How slow do you think this community is? :D
---
The Problem is - do you know Player numbers and the amount of Players that are going to be on one Server? :P
---
Might work for 1 German PVP Server. No PVE Server or RP though. 
---
Not enough for an entire French Server - simply not enough People. 
---
It is simply not possible m8 :D
---
Largest German Guilds have already decided to join the same Server which will be announced at least 2 weeks Prior to release - when there Server names are announced.
---
Better find your community and talk to them :)
---
Nope - will be in the first few weeks.
---
Nobody will care come August 26/ 27, and it will be gone by October.
---
Qui bello
---
Nah bro. All of us civilized Europeans speak, read and write perfectly understandable Engellanguage.
---
Recreating classic mechanics?
---
What is their reasoning for spell batching?
---
What's their reasoning for debuff limit?
---
yea we don't need Swedish servers i just really enjoy the 5ms ping I get in csgo. but I get 32ms to L-hope, which I believe is hosted in Germany? and that's no problem, its an mmo after all :)
---
Played international private-servers for the last 5 years.  
---
Hyped for national servers, because speaking in English works, but having a community you can chill and speak in Discord casually and possible form real friendships and a lasting guild-community with people from my country is what I'm looking forward to in classic!
---
People here are triggered over the streamer situation. But you get to avoid that issue.
---
How is the “invite to X layer” problem not triggering you way more?!
---
I believe that the only loot LFR should offer is quest items. That way only people who are interested in the lore and or want to practice for real raids join. 
---
SADLY most just treat LFR as easy loot time.
---
This is getting ridicules.
---
Your fix is limiting how people play, it's 2019 and blizzard does NOT do this -
---
You think You want it...
---
Really depends what your reference is. I just checked 2 sites. One said Russian followed by German. Another said German followed by English. French wasn’t higher than 3rd in either list.
---
Lol, those servers were super enjoyable, what are you talking about?
---
Exactly, I'm Danish myself, so I know the Scandinavian "racism" is definitely in jest in almost all circumstances, I also know that the British relentlessly mock Germany and France, and I'm assuming it's basically the same all across Europe, so when suddenly language and nationality in the EU comes up as a topic on a multinational forum, of course we're going straight for the stereotypes.
---
Keep that trash contained when launch comes.
---
There's been a lot of good raids and along with Art Style is probably Blizzards most consistent good points. That is if you count Mythic Raids on their own and imagine you don't have to play their lower difficulties first.  
---
Other than Kara what retails raids could be added into a just vanilla experience without it feeling weird? There are some that are in Kalimdor or Eastern Kingdoms such as Bastion of Twilight or In the case of Caverns of Time, Deathwing, Hyjal. Realistically adding in Cavern of Time stuff into a Vanilla game would be an amazing big patch or 2. 1 With Culling, Hyjal, Dark Portal and Durnholde. With the second bringing in all the Cata Dungeons and Deathwing. 
---
Then there is Firelands ... Now if they DID open up Hyjal it would include Firelands which ... feels very weird considering we have "defeatead" Ragnaros already. This is some Kael'thas shit, however him being both one of the first bosses then a boss say .. 4? tiers down the line would be something. 
---
The thought of Vanilla becoming like OldSchool Runescape is very cool and very interesting, but then again so is playing up until Wrath's ending for me... there are some features and some raids and so on that many people really like and I don't know how they would go into Vanilla say ... after most people have "finished" a lot of the game. Thinking of some of the raids past Vanilla but with Vanilla classes both excites and scares me.
---
Which now is artificially added through spell batching.
---
That is not the issue that OP described with the description. It clearly states they layered WHILE fighting the Alliance. That implies that they did make contact with the Alliance and then something happened to make them lose contact. Additionally, current layers do not support the numbers Blizzard is planning on it supporting. We're talking literal thousands of people, 2000-3000 per layer, if I remember correctly. Chances are, you'll be seeing enough people on Launch. Big fights already happened on tons of streams on the beta itself and so far there were no gamebreaking issues.
---
Even in this same thread other (assumed) Germans said that nowadays in Germany everyone speaks English and thta the old attitude of not wanting to speak English are gone. But I guess this disproves that.
---
Don't see it as an obstacle. See it as an opportunity.
---
Where do you get those numbers from? Blizzard has much better metrics.
---
&gt;Intra-server decohesion
---
Problem is INTER SERVER decohesion. When you run around and you start seeing people with different server tags.
---
Phasing is nothing different than a open world istance.
---
Or for people with multiple monitors because I watch or listen to streams/videos on the second monitor while playing myself. It's just some extra entertainment depending on the content watched.
---
The best answer is to have English and International servers.
---
With the English servers having a strict auto mute in public channels (General, trade, worlddefense, localdefense, looking for group) for non English characters
---
Over half of all people in the EU understand English, whilst German is the highest used mother language. 
---
Europe as a whole, well then that changes the picture, 'cos that makes Russian the most spoken and understood language.
---
I really dont care what they do to manage player load in zones.
---
The stress test sucked when it started. Just a bunch of running around looking for shit to kill to finish the starting quests. Although, I think it was made worse by all the warlocks and priests running around.
---
I'm talking about a US server. I hope you pick our server too!
---
I think what they want to avoid at all cost are server merges, so they prefer to have fewer servers with a lot of layers than the opposite. When population will stabilise, if population is higher than expected they will open new servers and offer free server transfers (and if population wise it's justified, we'll get languages servers).
---
I'm not asking to add arena gear, just the game mode.
---
Both are awesome! Totally different playstyles tho 😂
---
A lot of people that are hyped about classic are players that started playing wow in 2006-2008, like me. Many of them are 30+ years old. 
---
I would say that my english is pretty solid (because I confront myself with the language every single day for over a decade).
---
My wife on the other hand is grown up in the eastern part of Germany. Even though she had a good education, her english isn't that great. She even refuses to watch netflix series with me.
---
I can assure you that there are a lot of people that are the same. Maybe the next generation won't have the same problems...
---
That's why It's Blizzard who should be making the decision of which server should be which by simply marking some random servers as DE, FR, etc. on the realm selection screen, not players.
---
same reason they're implementing layering
---
saves a bit of money. they don't care that it fucks the player experience.
---
Corporate shill!
---
Tibia... that's a name I haven't heard in a long time. Let me tell you about the Antican nationality wars. Thais had always been a rough place, second only to the vile hive of Carlin. We had fought the Swedes and Polish before but eventually things calmed down and they gained acceptance among the citizens. But then the Brazilians came... eventually we retreated to our mountain stronghold of Kazordoon but they kept coming, unrelenting, bringing pure defiance of the local law. My god, I can still the blood of pummeling them back into the plains.
---
Good for you. 
---
Play classic the way blizzard releases it... 
---
Or, wait a second.
---
Don't. 
---
Choose 🤠
---
Accurate!
---
What irks me is, that layering supposedly is in so we won’t have ghost towns down the line. So we get the downsides of layering but apparently are too afraid to capitalize on its supposed benefits?
---
Let's say they make a FR and GR server. You now have 18 different languages instead of 20 (actually you still have 20, since some FR and GR will prefer the english server anyway). Big improvement I guess? Yes, 3k FR and 3k GR will be happy, but have you solved the problem? Not at all, and you suddenly have 2 servers at a much higher risk of underpopulation. I'll be honest, I'm not 100% sure it's that worth.
---
Plus, I hope people don't take the picture seriously...
---
What kind of a non-argument is this?
---
The entire game is based around limitations. I guess you also forgot that you can't freely realm hop? Or that you have to pay them over 30 euros to do that? (Also 25+ for a faction transfer btw, wow such freedom.)
---
Something you forgot is that the translation of the wow client is really good. Some quest names, quest quotes etc are being adapted to the langage and country culture. I remember seeing a lot of quest making references to some obscure movies that are , i believe, only known in france.
---
You are not pathetic. You are breathtaking!
---
Yeah that’s way too long.
---
Do you feel like there is something wrong with the term retail?
---
Came to this subreddit looking for discussion on this specific clip because of how easily abusing layering appears to be and the top comment is a random opinion about the streamer 
---
You’ll be upvoted because people agree with you and this subreddit hates streamers but you’ve really added nothing to the discussion
---
&gt;How much(if at all) should i charge for conjured food/water while adventuring?
---
how much you feel the time you spent conjuring it is worth.
---
&gt; You have to consider not only your own language skills, but those of other people as well.
---
If I was considering my own language skill (in English) then I would not see a problem whatsoever. The fact that I know that there are a lot of people who are not as proficient or comfortable with the language is what makes me concerned. Sure, most people can speak the language enough to also talk outside their own communities (e.g. guilds) ... but would they want to? Or will they just say "fuck it I'll just speak German/French/Spanish"?
---
&gt; Adding new servers is infinitely easier than trying to "fix" broken servers through mergers. If classic has the population to support language specific realms, then giving players the option to migrate to those realms post launch does more to keep both the old server and the new server alive.
---
So, if a server with a big community of a certain language gets the possibility to migrate to a new server, won't it be possible that this kills the old server? Either way, whether it is migrating or merging ... both are not ideal, the question is: what is worse?
---
What is so bad about merging servers?
---
In the pserver scene, English is what's officially used in open chat channels, anything else is forbidden by server policy. Some communities like the Chinese have their own separate chat channels so they can communicate, and most other nationalities keep non-English chat between each other or in guild chat only. The community has adapted over several years, and it's not a huge issue. Every now and then, I see an item linked in a different language, and if it's not obvious what it is, I just click on it - not a big deal.  
---
I'm sure anyone new to classic will have an adjustment, but the pserver community has been making this work for a while...
---
No. Stress test.
---
Yeah, the further south or east in Europe You go, the fewer people who can understand English You can find.
---
Is the 10%-30% speed buff for Troll berserking significant while casting Pyroblast? Or other spells too?  
---
Leaning towards undead because of base INT and Will of the Forsaken. This will be my first mage. Not to imply I plan on going fire, but it's something I'd like to try in PvP settings if I have the gold.
---
Or... we can suggest changes that would objectively improve the quality of the game?
---
But I guess that doesn't fit in your shilling agenda.
---
You're spot on... but we are talking about WoW players here... if there is a chance for an outrage it will surely happen...
---
People forget that when Vanilla started there were German servers but there was no German game - basically everything was in English. And nobody complained about it!
---
There was even an outrage  when Blizz started to translate the game to German eventually. When Stranglethorn became the "Schlingendorntal" and worse atrocities...
---
it's the same thing when people complain about bad gaming experiences with other non german speakers on international servers. You know how many bad gaming experiences I had as a german speaker on german servers? Because guess what: Asshats come in all languages...
---
That's because you kind of make it out to be the best case scenario, but judging from the past that is not how it will go.
---
What if instead "unofficial" language servers start to evolve? Then suddenly a minority of people that don't speak this unofficial language of the realm will be excluded from their own community and essentially forced to reroll on a new realm, essentially losing all their progress.
---
Or maybe somewhere in between, maybe for example 30% of some realms become a sub community of a specific language. This essentially mean the rest people have a 30% smaller community.
---
Honestly, making some language specific realms at the start is not just for people that don't speak english, it is as much for those that does. I've played on mixed realms in games where I felt completely excluded from all open chat channels because I didn't speak the right language.
---
And how exactly will language realms cause more low pop? I mean, it isn't really different from other realms, is it? Unless you think less than 3k Germans will play.
---
Different dev team.
---
Theres never enough dogs :)
---
Mods locked those topics because people were being really disgusting toward each other in the comments. If the community discussion is civil, it's worthwhile, but when it strays from that it's better to just shut it down (in my experience).
---
That said, if the company's stance is firm in not releasing language-specific realms, I want realm names sooner rather than later, so that everyone can pick their language-official server(s) and the rest of us can know to avoid them or go to them. It's not a perfect solution but it's way better than a bunch of people on both sides of the language fence getting disappointed that they rolled on the wrong server.
---
what happes when you press play ?  
---
Do you load , if yes then you are in.......
---
Play on a PvP server, kill them, problem solved.
---
This also counts in people of older age, doesn't it? I would say most of of the playerbase will be 15-30 which is a range where most at least understand english and have some basic skills. 
---
It's hard to grow up today and not encounter some english in everyday life.
---
Suggest all you want, don't cry when blizzard doesn't do what you want.
---
I know 😂
---
&gt;that would mean that there are 15k people on a server, which is insane
---
for this example server, we would need about 80% to quit playing classic for a server pop like it was in vanilla
---
Ok but why do you want a 3k pop server again? Majority of those did not fair well overtime, and there ended up being 1-3 good guilds per server, except for the really well known "famous" ones.
---
I'd prefer it to be closer to 5 as the final figure, all things considered.
---
I’am sorry about missing the Canadian part, honestly my mistake. But it seems that you are not considering the fact that there also is a huge group of people that agrees with the OP. Representing opinions different from the opinion of the mass has nothing with being egocentric.
---
it's okay to be honest. its a very small typo, no one will give it much thought.
---
agreeeeed - I do agree with some of the QoL updates don't get me wrong. But shit like the dungeon queue system in a game thats all about creating a grand adventure with the folk you meet along the way felt really shitty to me.
---
And that's why reddit survives &amp; thrives in 2019!!!
---
It is harder to abuse sharding in retail because you need to be in the same zone. I hope they make it so party invites only swap your layer if you are right next to each other or in a major city.
---
Private servers used the old tech to handle a lot of players at the same time, blizzard is using the new tech that crashes as soon as 100 people raid a main city.
---
That's cute.  There are dozens of good reasons it is bad, so please list me your top dozen.  Failing that, I'd take a top six.  Doesn't have to be a meandering list that borders on being mistaken for a novella.
---
Yes it is.  When you make that comparison you have to look at where it was and where it is. 
---
And to straight up assume that this is the reason for the low sub count is just ridiculous. 
---
A lot of the things you mentioned were ‘t even implemented when the subcount was already significantly lower. 
---
You can’t make a proper relation with all the differences, for example there is so many more options to choose from as opposed early years of wow which has a significant impact. 
---
I would give the low subcount more than anything dumbing down the classes and just homogenization across the board.
---
That'd be fucking joke. 
---
I'd probably get suicidal a few days later but atleast it'd be funny
---
&gt; I really can't see many downsides to having English-only servers
---
You dont understand the issue. There will be no english server now. Every server may become a unofficial French or german or italian server and its people like you who will suffer when you can communicate with most players on the realm or read chat.
---
Jokes aside, I'm from Scandinavia and here everyone has an acceptable level of English, but after working in other countries I really learned just how shitty some countries are at English.
---
Yes, you and me personally are like this, but you have to recognize that we are in the minority! I encourage you to play on an english server, you are the person it's there for! There is loads of people that will stick to their language and refuse to play with english players.
---
then you should check asmon's shenanigans during the stress tests. now THAT is a fuckton of people
---
and its hard to quantify because the things you lose aren't always things that stand out but actually do contribute to the overall feel of the game.
---
I hope there will be free server transfers then. If not then this is really a shitty deal.
---
I hate them (Well hate might be strong word) for the same reason I hate any cult following. It makes people act like retards. You may say that it is those people who are acting dumb but streamers are those who profit from it.
---
are you leaving for another job? do you have a ton of money saved up and no rent bill?
---
I believe you start the quest by picking up the letter VC drops, then you go into a fairly longish quest chain and have to do Stockades, eventually leading to the ring. 
---
Correct me if im wrong, havent played in a while.
---
As the post said, the viewpoint you have will almost certainly be a niche by the time anything begins to develop. People like new content, and people will pay for that new content. You can only do so much in one game that doesn’t evolve before it gets old and boring. 
---
Also... the success of the game is almost certainly them getting paid, that’s the whole point of a business.
---
No, I'm just sick of every thread on this Subreddit being about Layering. 
---
This video isn't constructive. We shouldn't just whine about a problem until we get our way.
---
Ill bite. 
---
#1 I was going to get a L shaped desk but caddying my desk i already own faces my bed and  I prefer to look to the left instead of right which the L shape would have me doing in that position.
---
#2  Yeah, I have an expensive headset and mic. I also have played piano and sang since 2007. It's my other hobby outside of WoW.  I actually had to tell my band not to schedule any shows on august 27th and to basically regard it as the birth of my child. They scheduled one on august 17th two states away and about made me shit my pants at first..... on a side note im almost 30. I don't watch streamers at all much less asmongold. Lol.
---
3. Yeah, you got me on my windows bro. Nothing there. Lol.
---
holy fuck that was an insane amount of people, even with sharding involved. compared to it legion was the most smooth seamless launch ever
---
The game isn’t designed for 15k players but keep talking I guess because you sound like you really know what you’re talking about
---
It's interesting to think about since BFA subs have tanked a lot and Blizzard hasn't even shared sub counts in a while. Developing classic has used some resources I'm sure but not nearly as much as something like a new exp. 
---
But I wonder if Classic will have more active players than retail, and I hope blizzzard decides to share subs again but I doubt they'll wanna show everyone that more are playing classic then their latest exp.
---
Guys ffs they're getting rid of it after the first couple of weeks.
---
Irrelevant comment?
---
Pay up? No there wont be a transfer lol. You straight up lose everything
---
Bcs it will fail
---
\&gt;establish language based communities over 15 years  
---
\&gt;disregard language based communities for the next release
---
Yep, that's blizzard time!
---
I pressed play, made a character and starting playing.
---
Go play a private server then, because there has already been considerable changes.
---
I think theres merit in developing the game post-Naxx. Dont want to play that content? I'm sure they'll keep a untouched version to quarantine the winning morons such as yourself.
---
Irrelevant response?
---
There's a solution everyone is missing.
---
Just don't abuse the oversights /s
---
It's almost like they're supposed to be participating in a beta *test*, not a VIP steamer early access
---
Layering is going to be essential. The stress test was a cluster fuck of massive proportions for leveling. You literally stood in one spot with twenty other people to play wack-a-mole for the first quest mob that showed up. If layering fixes this then being it on. The economy that everyone is so worried about will normalize just fine and the few weeks of layering won't affect it. If you're worried that it'll prevent you from a world first then get over it. In the long run absolutely nobody will give a crap who the world first 60 is.
---
Same goes for Brazilian community. Zero hype.
---
jeez. you don't know any context around the guy. maybe he has been unsatisfied for some time and this was the last straw. you literally know nothing about him, and all it takes is a resignation letter for you to think of yourself as superior and him as a moron? 
---
Try to think out of the box a bit man. Not everything is a simple as you seem to think.
---
The explanation does not make sense for me:
---
If you want to play with your friends you have the same problem with non-official servers like everybody else: You want to chose a realm with a specific language: Which one? You have to read reddit and the boards to know which server is what language. So the explanation is completely useless. I can always play with my friends, regardless of the server langauge. But when it comes to the selection of your prefered language (like english in your case, or german) then there it is simply harder to find out which server is what. For you, this might be not a big thing, sure, for players not reading reddit frequently or the boards this might be complete confusion.
---
So, when there are obviously building non-official language servers in the community, why not officially make language-specific realms so everybody has not a problem selecting where he wants to play? Technically nothing changes except for a language tag, or am I wrong (Blizz can GM tickets and support be required in english though). And for you, nothing changes too. If you want to play on a german server: select it, if you want to play on an english server: select it.
---
You have the server named Illidan and the server named Arthas, but in reality they both connect to the same server named 836183. Two aliases for the same server.
---
I personally don't see what that accomplishes.
---
I disagree! For the first 20 levels, it should be there to allow players to quest without having to wait hours for mobs.
---
They will all be gone to play the next big thing in a week anyway.
---
Yea but what if we want to circlejerk about it?
---
Its a non issue - With Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, German, Italian, Finish  and many other Eastern Europeans on my server the default was english. People in /2 not speaking english would be asked by the community to speak english. My server wasn't dominated by English speakers - Danish people dominated my sever - and yet they enforced English.
---
When I was in a party with a group of Swedish and Norwegian people, we defaulted to English - I was not left not being able to talk.
---
People who played WoW in 2005/6 would know this. My assumption is these language complaints are coming from retail players who started the game during WotlK and onward.
---
The original launch was with dc's, lagg, servers shutdown for hours etc. 
---
Rather have a smooth non-trully vanilla launch.
---
Since it is about "creating the vanilla experience" I am taking the server cap numbers from vanilla as the point for comparison. Whether or not it is a good size is an entirely different question. If anything: 3k is enough to have a good time.
---
A true melting pot.
---
&gt;battle royale
---
You did not just say that in wow sub. Stop giving them ideas ffs.
---
&gt;That has nothing to do with gameplay.
---
It's the exact same thing as layering. The only difference is that you have to log into a website to do it. If it has nothing to do with gameplay, layering doesn't either. Your argument is invalid either way.
---
Also conveniently skipped past my first point there. The entire game is based on limitations.  
---
Limitations are the fucking entire premise of why classic even exists to begin with.
---

TO THE WINDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWS
---
Both are blue but the newer one has a few more stat points. 
---
https://www.wowhead.com/item=2933/seal-of-wrynn
---
Obviously they won't open a Hungarian server, but France and Germany are significantly bigger places than Hungary, and both are already organizing in Discord which servers they're going to claim for France and Germany at launch.
---
I guess you could argue that that's fine and the community will figure it out, and we will, but it's going to take a lot more work for us, than it would if Blizzard just put 'French' and 'German' next to two of the servers.
---
man those fucking trees. tbh even with launch's shitfest I really enjoyed my first time leveling through wod. a shame they abandoned it so early
---
And we are allowed to not like those people.
---
The Mythic Plus system was added as a way to make sure dungeon content, which takes significant resources, stayed relevant. They've had the issue where either dungeon spamming was the best way to gear or not a method to gear up at all after the initial start.
---
The invitational stuff all happened after the fact. The only parts that get touched up are exploits. Which is to make it so the general population doesn't exploit it for high tier loot.
---
&gt; People like new content, and people will pay for that new content. You can only do so much in one game that doesn’t evolve before it gets old and boring. 
---
Doesn't mean you need to do expansions - also the "new content" is available through BFA and future expansions.
---
Whatever blizzard (not the players) decide to do - I hope whatever changes they make to post naxx classic = different servers that people have to remove their character from classic and put it on the non classic server.
---
&gt;when streamer hate blinds you from reality
---
Right, so it seems they plan to keep it, maybe rework it some
---
Elemental Precision from the Frost talent tree is also useful a lot for fire mages.
---
I mean the way you talk makes you seem even more exaggerating of your accomplishments and even more towards you made the whole thing up. 
---
But either way whether you are a software engineer or not, by the way you form sentences throw insults around without any basis shows that you are not particularly bright, highly doubtful of a top 5% achievement.  
---
So move along with your sad life and if you didn’t play vanilla you don’t even add much to this discussion so maybe you should go back to coding or whatever it is that you do.  Good luck
---
by laggy do you mean fps drops or latency?
---
Its logging on, seeing what random shit you got in loot boxes, doing some dailies for randomized gear hoping for the 1% chance of something better. 
---
Yes, it is a game, but its also covered up gambling and it isn't even fun.
---
But way to completely miss the sarcasm in the post.
---
O O G A  O O G A  Z H I T
---
this isn't the same classic feeling for **you** . 
---
The amount of people who really would be uncomfortable to play on international servers are simply too small to open dedicated servers for them.
---
It has nothing to do with population estimates and everything to do with keeping costs down. It's the same reason we won't get RP-PvP servers despite there being a ton of support for one.
---
Truth is for 99.9% of players, you're going to be playing Classic regardless of what type of servers Blizzard offers. They lose no revenue by having international servers while simultaneously preventing the need to open more servers and/or doing mergers later on.
---
Remember folks, it may be Classic but it's still Activision calling the shots. It's always about generating revenue and keeping costs down.
---
The vocal minority is not the whole player base....
---
Latency.
---
Yeah I was in France recently and I was shocked at how many people couldn't speak English (at all).
---
Wow man, talk about unoriginal shit.
---
1) 50s-1G was typically what I charged depending on the player.
---
2) I always used vendor food/water as a reference and charged half of the appropriate level.
---
3) This is a tough one, because it's been over a decade, but talenting into Arcane first is mostly troublesome because it is a direct decrease to DPM compared to the other two, and the Arcane school is fairly limited in Classic from a damage spell perspective. **However**, having fun *your* way is just as important as worrying over an optimal spec. Arcane/Frost or Arcane/Fire tend to pick up more towards 60, once you can put an appropriate amount of points into a primary damage school.
---
4) Frost Nova. If I'm not mistaken it's only a slight damage increase for more mana, the effect time/durability remains the same.
---
Key word here is private=free, a lot of russians won't go for a classic subscription just because it's pretty hefty in comparison to average salaries.
---
&gt; Pretty sure Classic will have more people playing it than retail until at least 9.0 comes out
---
How can you be so sure about this? How many people are playing on retail right now?
---
You know what, you're right. We should all be complacent sheep. We should have listened to the wall of no people, then there would have been no classic at all :)
---
I think now it's largely legal since Russia is outside the EU
---
Aim for the eyes so you don't have to see more of it.
---
Based off of what? Your memory from 15 years ago?
---
When people started playing the game at different times and most joining at the end of vanilla?
---
Servers with 15k players doesn't = 15k on 24/7, but if you can't wrap your brain around that - have fun in the next wow expansion!
---
Even the lazy arse English speak English. Continental Europeans speak at least 1 language plus English. Everyone will just speak English.
---
Honestly it should stop before Westfall, Darkshore, Loch Modan, Barrens etc. ends.
---
This is simply not true. Some might, but most wont. They wont learn a whole language just for one game. The world doesn't work that  way, sadly.
---
* Exploiting Materials (Make friends with a guild on another layer, the two guilds create a simple mafia to exploit rare materials. So easy to do. Please understand that guilds are stuck on one layer. When you join another layer, you return to your layer on login. If Guild A is on one layer, and B is on another, and C is on a third... it wouldn't be hard at all to become friends and build a mafia. People think this is hard work. Its literally "oh shit we're on different layers. Lets become friends so we can farm shit later" levels of easy.)
---
* Exploiting PVE mobs (Make friends with a guild on another layer, ask for an invite to their layer after you've cleared out the camp your farming resulting in instant respawns)
---
* Exploiting PVP (Avoiding conflict)
---
* Exploiting your "layer cap". (Asmongold invites everybody to his layer. He then wipes Orgrimmar with the power of 2000 stream spergs, and there's no way in hell to even remotely defend it.) 
---
* Unreadable Chat (1500 people spamming Chuck Norris jokes was okay in Vanilla.... 10000 will make grouping, selling, and chat very difficult.)
---
*Post "Layer Collapse" Cons (if your server population is very high)
---
* Increased time to get inside raid/dungeons. (There will be potentially hundreds to thousands of people camping them)
---
* Leveling an alt PVP. (Instead of one guy camping you, it could potentially be hundreds to thousands)
---
* Leveling an alt PVE. (You're now on a server with 13,000 people, many of which are still questing and leveling. Have fun competing for mobs. Pservers combated this with dynamic respawns. Blizzard is not)
---
* Rare material inflation (Now that you have 13,000 on your server, but only one servers worth of materials, everything just shot up in price. Supply and Demand brothers. Pservers combated this with dynamic spawns. Blizzard is not)
---
* AQ Event trivialized (You have 10,000 people turning in materials. Completed in 1 hour. Although this may happen on a normal server regardless, it most definitely will happen on a very high pop server)
---
* World Bosses impossible to kill. (This is a potentiality if the boss spawns during prime time. Remember that pserver populations organically mitigated this by being world wide. Blizzard servers will have very strong "prime times")
---
* Eradication of World Buff raiding. (Even though I personally love this point, many minmaxers will hate it, as once again there will be thousands of prime time players, many of whom will be waiting to strip world buffs from those who just acquired them. Ps... please do!)
---
* Small/Medium/Big fish in a *big* pond effect. (Having an identity was one of the most fantastic parts about Vanilla. I believe for some, a huge server is great, but for the other guys... you're just another body. The pool of players to grab from is so much larger, people can afford to kick you if you make a mistake in a dungeon. They can expect you to be a pro. They can not communicate at all. Your successful guild may be invisible. Your ninja actions may go unnoticed. There are so many players that its hard to keep up with anything)
---
* Slow leveler demise. (Although similar point as before with alts, this time with the slow guys who have busy lives. If P2 hits in 3 months, and you're not 60, your leveling experience is going to be potentially so overpopulated you either succumb to dungeon running, or quit.)
---
* Server Queue insanity (Although details haven't been given on how server queuing will work post layer collapse, it could be a nightmare if they decide to keep a low global server cap. This would mitigate all of the previous issues, but I'm not too keen on waiting 2 hours to log in)
---
* Ratio issues. (1k:2k is rough for the 1k side, but doable. 2k:4k is very difficult. 4k:8k is virtually impossible. The vast numbers make it very challenging to do the most basic tasks. This could very well be your server too, if you're an ally playing against Sodapoppin, or a horde playing against Asmongold. 
---
*Not to mention, the probability of you being on a server with a streamer is dramatically increased, as Blizzard wants to launch with as few servers as possible. So, there's always that awesome thing to look forward to. /s.*
---
* No Changes? (Its obvious we're getting some changes, and I've accepted that. But I never thought one of the changes I'd be getting was a server two three or four times bigger than what the game was designed for. How is that classic WoW?)
---
You forgot about the streamer hate threads.
---
It does make a huge difference. Those 20 languages are not all equally big and the level of English is different in some countries.
---
For example take Scandinavia, we have 3 languages but we are all generally pretty good at english, so we don't "add to the problem". Or small countries, they won't have enough to end up making "unofficial language realms".
---
The problem is only with a select few really big countries that have a tendency to shy a bit away from English. France is one of them (seriously no offence to French people, but I've been working in France for the past 6 months and I'm baffled at how big the language barrier is).
---
And of course 3k was just a number of the lowest limit, since that is what is needed for a realm. Obviously there will be way more than that, and as such also more than one realm for it.
---
And aside from just arguing, it has been proven in MMORPG before that mixed can lead to "unofficial" language realms, which means a minority on the realm will be forced out of their own community. Language specific realms have proven to help on this.
---
I'm... medium-aged?  I was in high school when vanilla came out.
---
Anyway, I have two monitors and I usually have twitch or youtube up on the second one while I'm playing games with any sort of downtime.  It basically replaced the peggle and bejeweled addons, for a classic-centric example.
---
Careful here sub, you might create another TipsOut
---
omg thank you, wow this bring back the feels being on this page.
---
I'm Swedish and only knew very basic English before playing MMOs, 10 years old. But playing a sociable game in English is like practicing on steroids. Doing something several hours a day every day will make you learn faster than just about any school will.
---
The betas already over halfway done, mate.
---
I am german and fluent in english but I would love to play on national servers. If all languages are mixed up it doesn't feel like a cohesive world to me. And I can communicate so much better in my own language. And better communication leads to a better game and social aspect overall.  
---
As for server population, I think there is nothing to be worried about.
---
Well so they won't play because they are too lazy. Like I said multiple times, nowdays in online gaming , you need to speak in English in order to communicate with others players. I don't have one recent online game that I can speak in my native language with others.
---
Some of us are looking for more meaningful interaction with people than "sheep moon". And yes, I have. Pservers usually have rules that enforce English as the server language of choice, we won't even have that.
---
In the private server (international), people usually only made of french and despised russians and chinese
---
Bye
---
Yeah, the challenge of getting exalted by ~44 on pservers by planning out your route was fun. I don't think it'll be worth it, to me personally, if it's just going to end with a rune cloth grind anyways. This has pretty much solidified that I'm going Tauren lol.
---
“italian sounds like low cost spanish”
---
Ow
---
What about only one day with no new layering posts?
---
They can always add language specific servers later and have free transfers to them.
---
&gt; Nearly everyone speaks English now a days. 
---
These people dont want to speak english even if they can. They will use their native language and basically block out everyone else. Thats the problem.
---
He doesn't. Like many other posters here, he's relatively new to the sub and yet he has no qualms in asserting his "opinion" as if he's informed.
---
The amount of people with little to no Classic knowledge that still speak up and vehemently defend Layering is damaging to the community.
---
Daddysucc telling it like it is
---
Blizzards EU HQ was/is in Paris...
---
I can't speak for the other hybrid classes, but druid's main struggle is a lack of gearing options that aren't mega-obscure. Bringing in good stam/armor leather drops at endgame could easily catapult them into being BiS tanks.
---
Will of the forsaken is a challenge but not the end of the world. It's only 5 second immunity on a 2 minute CD. 
---
They will out of fear, you death coil, by the time they get their next attack off a fear is incoming again.
---
That's an incredibly ignorant stance.
---
usually ppl only make fun of french people
---
Awesome. Have an up vote.
---
What’s more badass than seeing 2 female gnome warlocks with pink pigtails ganking you on their nightsaber mounts?
---
Rogue here, it's a yes from me
---
I agree with you, but a lot of people won't care and ruin it for the others. It's just how it is.
---
This isn't at all relevant unless the wow player base followed country population exactly. (Which it doesn't)
---
Mods. Stop locking these threads? Thanks
---
Why booty bay?

https://discord.gg/jA4v2RY
---
In this discord a lot of german guilds are going to coordinate, as well as collaborate with a big french  and Russian Community.
---
I'm going to rush to 60 and play Feral for raids. 
---
I embrace the hate from both communities.
---
I agree with you, but my ultate argument is : I want WoW Classic like WoW Vanilla was. I want the experience back. And localized language realm was part of that.
---
(I play many games online, all with english speaker. And it's ok. But I want to play WoW with people speaking french - like it was)
---
This x9999999. Retail is actually more of a hardcore game than vanilla is. It's more consistent time commitment with dailies and the constant power creep. Classic is actually an amazing game for the casual player if you enjoy the nuts and bolts of it.
---
Just you wait when the General chat and Trade chat is full of German/Spanish/Greek/France Speaking people, they have a tendency of not respecting the language set to the server, this was what a few English servers where back in the day... 
---
It will be harder to have any real conversation when you get into the wrong server, most languages will have their own server they want to flock too, and this happened to many servers, i am just saying it will happen, and likely it will be just as it was back then... ;)
---
Sharding already exists on retail, has extensive testing, applies to individual areas and not the world, and is ready for use.
---
Layering was *invented* by the Classic team. Talk about a fuck up. 
---
Perfectly good existing system and they choose to create a substandard product.
---
That's just not true - WoW is poorly optimised and heavy on the CPU. OP wants to stay above 60 Hz, not all PC's can do that.
---
Classic requirement are closer to modern WoW than vanilla.
---
Dude this is awesome. Way to have a great positive attitude and look to address the issue with solutions! 
---
Will definitely be saving this just in case
---
This sub has an intense mix of entitlement and poor comprehension
---
This is some false, high level gatekeeping BS. Plenty of "akshual" Vanilla players *are* suggesting layering the beginning experience. Myself included.
---
Get out of here with that kinda neckbeard gatekeeping, bud.
---
All these people post memes about no-lifing for at least a week after launch. I'm pretty sure people will be pissed if you take a week off work and literally can only do one quest every hour because of how stupidly overpopulated the starting zones are going to be for literally weeks. Vanilla had a couple thousand wanting to play at launch. Classic has millions ready to go out of the gate. It's a great sign, but also a huge problem for your ability to actually progress through zones early on. Temporary layering is still the most reasonable compromise to achieve playability. People are just following the streamers they claim to hate.
---
You clearly never played on Hakkar EU in vanilla.
---
I was hoping this was a meta joke about how this was missing from the image, but then no you are actually serious.
---
thats literally 2 raids -°)
---
No, I'm not saying that doesn't happen. I'm saying that it's not really that big of a deal.
---
I've personally been griefed by some rank asshats before. I know other people who have been too. Ya know what you do when you get griefed?
---
You report them, you ignore them, and you go on your business. You log out and swap a character at the worst. Or turn off private chats for a short time. The attention always does down.
---
Assholes have existed in this game since the beginning, and if some magic occured and all streamers were Thanos snapped out of existence the folks who make the game miserable to play for others would still keep making the game miserable to play for others.
---
I was trying out a warlock and ran into several bugs with the summons/pets.
---
1. The manual pet attack button sometimes would not make the pet attack anything. Even in defensive while i was being attacked it would just sit there. I found the work around was to click one of its spells to get it to start attacking.
---
2. Pets weren't aggroing anything. I would send a pet in to attack (Voidwalker) and it would just walk through the mobs UNTIL it got its first hit on the target. After that first hit whatever was in range began to aggro to it.
---
It's the stress test which is open to anyone with a sub right now
---
I figured. This is a recipe for disaster.
---
At least for finland I would bet that many people dont want a server just for us. Sure a server will form that has more finns than average but a servers just for us seems like a bad idea.
---
yall are so entitled lol
---
we should just take over one of the servers
---
SHE KNOWS I'LL BE PLAYING MORE THAN USUAL BUT HAHA SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S IN FOR!!!! xD
---
I think layering should be in the game for only the first opening 27 minutes.
---
Perhaps saying its designed with esports in mind is reaching, but the dungeons are 100% designed with mythic+ in mind, and mythic+ is not supposed to be content for your average player. Long gone are the days of slowly building a network of friends and going into a dungeon for the chance at some sweet loot and an adventure. Now we join random groups from other servers, and gogoogogo race against a timer without looking at scenery, following linear and carefully designed and optimized paths to quickly burn through everything, afterall you literally get punished for not being quick enough lol.  
---
Modern games are designed with streaming and hardcore players in mind, its almost impossible for a new player to simply join a group and dare ask a question about how to do something. Modern games hate casual and new players alike, despite what people say. Back in Vanilla anyone could join a group and take your time. It was an adventure, and even old handicapped people could enjoy it without too much stress.  
---
Dungeons in Vanilla (and bc) stayed relevant throughout the entire expansion. The only reason they dont now is because the devs make sure they dont. Now raids too are becoming more obsolete each patch and it wouldnt surprise me to see mythic+ raids next expansion. We kind of have that already with 4 difficulties, but they will take it further in order to combat the very problem they created years ago.
---
Cool. I guess I should have looked into the future to see that, before posting?
---
People like you keep making the mistake of telling people who have different viewpoints than you to “go play bfa.” Just because we want a growing game that evolves as we go does not mean bfa is the answer. A game model as your suggesting will absolutely ruin the game. The classic population will be small enough, it would be absurd to split it. Blizzard has a chance to restart their game and progress it in the right way this time after learning from their mistakes. They should absolutely add new content while keeping the feel of classic. For money and for player happiness.
---
Its only for the first month or so	of launch, ain’t that right?
---
Yeah I'm glad. Khadgar instead. Here we are in 2019 when an absolute shitton of people have gained new access to desktops/laptops and have a vested interested in trying out the experience we all got lucky on.
---
As a carer for the disabled. I feel like im at work reading this.
---
If private servers can make it work a multibillion dollar company could too. The decisive factor is financial
---
Damn that sucks, recently went and commissioned some equipment with one of our service engineers in northern Italy. It was an eye-opener as out of a factory of around 100 employees only the managing director could speak decent english. The 18-40 year old operators, engineers etc struggled to find single word sentences, we ended up having to bring on a translator in order to assist them properly.
---
You get to play Gnome, case closed.
---
Its not about chilling the fuck out, the problem is that Blizzard are repeating the same old mistake again - trying to fix something thats not broken. This is just going to create a ton of other problems. National servers are going to be formed anyway, why would people have to waste time searching online which server is what when Blizzard can just mark them instead and save everyone the headache? Very few people will benefit from that while a lot more will be screwed over. Really makes no sense at all, such a pointless change.
---
Yeah it's understandable
---
It's really undead pvp, troll pve. 10% doesn't seem like much but it's better than nothing. You can do some shenanigans like take off gear and reequip before fights to drop you lower.
---
I think troll don't get enough love, especially for casting. they have the Kamehameha hands. Throw in the hair color of your desired spec for some additional flair.
---
Taste is subjective and even though you might not find him entertaining, others do. Both takes on him are valid.
---
Yeah I was saying the selling especially I didn't remember from vanilla. The most out there pet I really remember is the mechanical chicken. Mostly just snakes and parrots and cats are all I remember seeing.
---
Excellent! There will be an extensive closed beta for streamers to test (cough market) the addon. If you send me some money there’s a small chance I’ll let you try it.

---
Where this was mentioned and a Discord link in the comment.
---
I was in a giant fight last night hundreds of people on one layer fighting then maybe 20 people on the other layer.
---
Absolute garbage. Gamebreaking, why even have servers? Just go with a megaserver if your going to have shit shards.
---
Okay real talk, he's a mediocre player with no vanilla experience at all that started surfing the Classic hype for YouTube money with inaccurate content, spreading massive misinformation about vanilla and private servers because fact checking is too much effort, lying for a whole year about his raiding experience and imaginary feats of strength only to be forced to admit once the beta started that none of it is true and he barely made it to lvl 53 before TBC came out. He has no legitimacy whatsoever to "teach" through his youtube content nor to represent this community. He's a pathological liar and a fraud both in real life and in virtual life. But to be fair, most of the "Classic YouTubers" are the same type of character with barely any vanilla experience.
---
+people forget fear works better on real servers. They will get boosted away from you on fear. Wotf is crap compared to orc bloodrage nuke and 25% stun resist making pala and warrior harder to peel them off of you.
---
The case for alliance is mostly that they're closer to all raid content save for aq40 and naxx and have better core leveling.
---
Once character creation is enabled 2 weeks prior there will more than likely be huge migrations of certain ethnic groups to certain servers (e.g French to Malganis etc).
---
Well they can just go to the other stadium in town that doesn’t have this problem and watch their sport there too.
---
Just thought it was funny because the people on classicwow tend to be super hard anti-transmog advocates :)
---
A decent warlock can probably beat most classes without even using fear, wotf is very overrated against them. They are 1v1 gods because their entire toolkit is insane.
---
these are the best to make money or is it other focus?
---
Piss on EU servers. Would rather play with our friend's access the pond!
---
Wrath naxx was intended to be a tutorial for raiding for new people hopping into the game. Vanilla naxx is brutal, wotlk naxx is a joke cakewalk. Altough wotlk naxx is a great way to get familiar how naxx works boss mechanik wise
---
Questing is a good point. I seem to recall Robert Jordan mentioning that the horde quest chains were also generally shorter and had less XP from 1-60. 
---
I've heard people that have played both factions say the Alliance lore is better but I can't comment.
---
Layering is not zone specific though. One layer includes the whole realm. It doesn't work like that.
---
yeah i don't understand this. It's a great racial that gives them an advantage, but it's talked about like undead are always immune to fear all the time. When fear can be chain cast, use the 5 seconds of immunity to cast some DoTs then go back to casting fear.
---
I expect nobody to learn french. I'm just saying it's for confort they refilm movie. NA don't like subtitles and don't like even a movie were the dialogue are re-recorded in english, because it's not perfectly sinced. It's just confort (maybe also money, yeah)
---
irrelevant post.
---
consult a doctor, find out what disorder you have.
---
Yes, exactly this. Absolutely agree.
---
I live in Barcelona, and the amount of locals who do not speak English is incredible. I would have thought Barcelona is more International, but it is. It's just there are a lot of expats talking English, but the Spanish / Catalan people are hardly talking any English at all.
---
I'm actually still really enjoying retail, with transmog farming as one of my favorite activities
---
Retail Europe has English, German, French, Spanish, Russian and Italian languages. With the minimum of 1 pvp 1 pve and 1 rp, that's at least 18 servers. Since they're already planning to have Russian servers, that's 15 servers left. And since they don't split them by language, it means they don't even intend to have 15 EU servers.
---
Read my comment again lol. Sunken Temple/BRD are examples of the OPPOSITE of how its designed today. They are there to show the contrast..
---
Forget about us because we have already regrouped, We are prepared and will have a server with a big majority for sure.   
---
How will you feel if you pick the french-canadian server and are a minority? Would you prefer to know?
---
thanks that put a smile on my face
---
That's fine. There's *always* pockets of funny stuff in trade, it'll be in English as the comedians want to get that across to everyone. I'm sure pockets of other forms of trade chat will appear too...
---
And if you're wanting real conversation on trade you've already gone wrong, let's not forget trade chat will already be full of gold selling, there's no stopping that so it's not a huge loss :) 
---
And even if you get into the wrong server, people *will* guide you in the right direction. Humanity is mostly pleasant.
---
This would mean that you'd always need death coil in order to just fear an undead once instead of using it to potentially save your life or secure a kill.
---
Also, what if you get attacked by 2 undead players? Normally you can just fear them both with HoT but you can't because you wanted to play alliance. You can only coil one of them (assuming it's off CD) so you're basically fucked in this situation.
---
Roll alliance if you want to shoot yourself in the foot. If you really want to be effective as a warlock, go horde. It's really that simple.
---
No reason to break the old tradition of xenophobia.
---
The way it is now we can all play together tho.
---
Danish is a small irrelevant language compared to French, Spanish, German, so of course Danes would be more willing to speak English to you. You are delusional.
---
It is a problem in the southern countries though. Spain, Italy, France still have a lot of lower educated people who doesn't speak english. To some extent even Germany.
---
&gt; once fortnite players and catakids see that you have to level weapon skills or that you can't hit 60 in 50 hours of play time - they will lose interest.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; And that's the majority.
---
This is why servers will be so overcrowded at first and why layering is a must for playability. The last thing Blizz wants is dead realms after all those players leave. It's such a different situation compared to vanilla launch where a new game grew steadily over time because it was so good. Now everything is known, but I feel like so many will play because of hype, or just to check it out between BFA content updates, or just have rose tinted glasses on.
---
So regardless of how many players classic will start off with, it gotta be extremely difficult to predict the final number of dedicated players who will remain after the 1st month or 2. Hell, there could even be a second phase of population drop off after everyone hit's 60 and exhaust all current content but would come back for the next phase.
---
Yeah I know the situation in Germany. Yet I feel like it's the people who in the end make the decision. If they're unwilling to learn English and would rather fight for German servers so they don't have to speak English, then I truly feel sorry for them. I personally would not even consider rolling on a Finnish server even if there were a hundred million Finnish speakers. I'd much rather enjoy the opportunity to meet new people outside my country.
---
Bitte
---
Your right - sky is falling 😔 I’m sure everyone on the complaint bandwagon will not play classic in protest 👍
---
Personally, I hope they layer or shard the first 1-20 or 1-30, to appease people with your mindset, and then leave the rest of it unaltered, to get rid of any obnoxious byproducts of layering when the game really opens up.
---
Thank God someone here is rational enough to get this. “Muh classic” people are getting so fucking annoying at this point.
---
Being able to level at launch&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a shitty level 12 raid in phase 1
---
ive dedicated most of my free time to playing games and hanging out with friends who also play alot of gaimz.  Ive had opportunities to meet and talk to women in the past but Im just not ready for a relationship since i have some glaring personal issues that need tuning.  If you prioritize that kinda stuff in life then thats your thing.   You do you.
---
Whoa, nice set up man! When is the last time you actually used alt-tab?
---
yeah because he's borrowing guild lol, that's like saying "don't level any prof., just buy gold online. IT'S FASTER!" OF course it's faster lol but not doable on mass scale.
---
I honestly agree with what OP is saying. The fact that a lot of people nowadays are able to speak English fluently will discard the need for language based communities on classic servers.  Also if that is not the case, at the moment we are not sure about the total amount of servers that will be available at launch, thus it might be such a small number that all this international communities will have to coexist together. 
---
As to your questions, I do not believe that such a situation would present itself, but if it did, there is always the ability to transfer.
---
The average player on private servers already kills most MC bosses between 30 seconds and 1 minute, do we really want to make it worse by unlocking the debuff limit which powercreep will result in bosses dying in 8-12 seconds now?
---
I understand it's frustrating to some players/some builds, but it is a necessary evil to keep the outdated raiding content barely relevant for 2019 players.
---
"Je me souviens" is the official motto of Quebec. It means "I remember". Were you playing on a us server ?
---
I find it relaxing to organize my bags by hand 🤖
---
Come on, why not.  Be like that Chinese couple that sold their kids for game time...   LOL
---
&gt; Layering is a reasonable solution to the problem. The alternative is sharding  
---
Layering is sharding
---
&gt; Just because we want a growing game that evolves as we go does not mean bfa is the answer.
---
Classic isn't the answer either. It's not a new ip nor an expansion - they have literally said this is for the people that want to play vanilla but can't on official servers.
---
&gt;Blizzard has a chance to restart their game and progress it in the right way this time after learning from their mistakes.
---
Mistakes said by who? You? They are doing perfectly fine running their game - people like you and me get to decide whether or not to play it. 
---
Stop pretending you have a 2 way communication with blizzard, classic is for people that want to play vanilla.
---
Not tbc. Not wotlk. Not some fantasy classic+
---
Well, as much as I admire your passion, I'm from NA and want particularly run into this issue.
---
Now when you create a program to filter out streamer servers... my wallet will open up
---
The one thing I'm really not a fan of is all the timegating though, I wanted to unlock the chad trolls, but I started 3 weeks ago, and I'm only at revered now :(
---
My experience is from my server where we had a massive Polish population for all of wotlk. Trade chat was always a flame war.
---
But they all have other friends. Given the opportunity they might go after them.
---
Maybe if you have really good gear, but without gear and cc a warlock is very squishy and easily locked down by melee classes.
---
This is why I'm going to wait a week until after Classic drops so I can roll on a server without streamer bullshit.

Before Classic came around, Retail was a way to differentiate between pserver and the game you have to pay for. Live would not make sense, because they are both live games.

Not that Classic is here, Retail is just a way to describe the modern game.

---
You should read more
---
The number of servers they are planning for will be incredibly low. However, it is guaranteed that they will be spinning them up on demand. Each server that is filled is the same profit as the first servers.
---
Back then they mentioned a number like 5 EU servers IIRC.
---
Oh my fault I see your point.
---
I do think there is 1 important thing missing and that's the lack of information we have on servers.
---
We still dont know exactly how many servers there will be and what population they will hold with layering. 
---
Should be an intresting 2 months before release as they start releasing the amount of servers that will be live.
---
&gt; Even if, by absurd, 50% of those people 
---
[A 5 second google search result](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jul/26/children-lie-age-facebook-asa) doesn't find that number absurd at all. I would assume that number is even higher in kids interested in video games since youtube is fairly harsh on [age-restrictions](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802167?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=2803138).   
---
This made me switch to restricted mode for a second and Asmongold's channel seems to be restricted to 18+ only. So yeah, you can throw you google-analytics page right out the window as the only children being access are those pretending to be 18+, hence completely skewing the results.
---
1. If you go alliance I can kill you on the battle field!
---
2. Music in Alliance cities are (imo) better.
---
FOR THE HORDE!
---
Can't you use the French client on English (International) servers?
---
It's localisation more than translation. It's really well done for the players speaking the language it was localised to, but oftentimes it makes the communication harder because of said localisation.
---
&gt;They are, it is literally why some get banned off twitch, look up some rules about twitch. If you have no idea what you are talking about ie you don't know that twitch streamers get suspended for what their viewers do in their own chats and in other chats, you don't belong in this discussion. 
---
They are responsible for their chat not their viewers. Better go get some
---
&gt; and in other chats
---
No they dont.
---
&gt; It happens all the time, even asmon and others have admitted that it happens...
---
Source and an example or fuck off.
---
&gt; God I love people who make up numbers to support an imaginary argument

These are not imaginary numbers, contacting support takes u less than 30 minutes. How quickly your case will get solved may be different but it doesn't usually take more than few days. Source: I got hacked and after 2 days got all my shit back.

It's not just about learning english (I'm not the most in need to learn this langage, btw). It's, first about confort. Second, about the authenticity of my experience of WoW vanilla like back in 2006.
---
If your company can't fathom a bridge was burnt leaving a toxic workplace, your company is almost certainly just as bad.
---
Maybe, I dont really know the terminology. If it is like you say, then the Layering is bad idea overall. They can have more servers instead and if the populations drop too much after couple of months, they could always merge them (it might be more difficult than layering i suppose).
---
Sharding would be useful for starting zones which are faction specific and not PVP and there it could be fine. For anything more it shouldnt be needed. For leveling there will be more options, you can go do different zones after level 10-12.
---
Ragequit? My whole point was that it’s not worth raging and to be the better guy, but sure, people must ragequit your groups it make sense.

I'd rather be able to actually play the game in the first couple weeks than occasionally have my immersion broken

---
Hmm odd, I distinctly remember in the original TOS that you actually had to use English rather than foreign languages on the "english" EU servers... would be surprised if that's not still the case for retail.
---
I had this thought.. then I had the thought of making an Alt who strictly sits in town and sells character names for gold. 
---
It would have to be a super secret alt because this is like "porno dealing monster" type troll play. 
---
"Pornodealer" coming to your server soon! Names up for grabs: Prince, Lindsaylohan, Bassnectar, Fartbox and Swifty!
---
That's just not true.
---
They think sharding is good technology and use it for all the live servers. They aren't the beacons of good design. This system ruins the server community for a temporary bandaid.
---
The same motherfuckers that have said numerous times that the ONLY reason for those caps back then was due to their limit of the technology?
---
Do some research maybe.
---
15k player caps after layering is removed will be fine.
---
If they're truly that narrow-minded that they'd rather only speak their mother tongue rather than enjoy the opportunity to meet new people from other parts of the world, then I truly feel sorry for them. I'm a strong believer that what you said will not happen atleast in a massive scale, and instead the players in question will be more open-minded.
---
I guess you can bring out the ol' classic "I told you so" if what you said ends up happening.
---
Personally, I don't charge for food. WoW is a social experience and I think you'll make more friends and possibly get even more tips than if you ask for silver/gold to conjure food or drink.
---
Wait what? They translate the name of the items also? So when I post it in germane someone who plays in french doesn‘t see the french version?
---
I did,  I blanked on the name.  lol.
---
The angle I haven't seen anybody else tackle is how this will meld with their profanity rules. There will be banter between nationalities some appreciated, some not so much. Is calling the French 'cheese eating surrender monkeys' allowed or do I get banned?
---
Lootbox simulator and game is pretty much the same thing these days so yeah
---
I admit that, as a paladin engineer, I would mind-cap horde, and jump off the cliff at this location, with them following me, and bubble on the way down. xD
---
I used to be a semi fan as well but lately I really only find Esfand entertaining.  The dude has a great sense of humor, is a decently skilled player and trolls other streamers/players in a fun but not toxic way.
---
Everyone likes to think that their language is major but the truth is that English has left the others in the dust. If Germany and France weren't so proud or set in their ways they'd stop dubbing everything and become proficient at English already.
---
People who don't speak English will still join the non-English servers.
---
See:  Illidan-US's *massive* Chinese population.
---
Yep! It's not even name reserving, they said you would be able to actually create **your characters** on the server of your choice. Up to 3 per account. They are doing this to gain an idea of how many servers they are going to need on launch day
---
hahaha, seems like occupying is our thing
---
Stop being silly. 
---
OCE will have its own servers.
---
Yeah, this is probably the reason. I really don't like how Thrall just has negleted the Horde. WC3 Thrall would be ashamed of his retail version
---
amen
---
Seriously this.
---
Layering is a pile of hot garbage.
---
LoL.
---
So you didn't play back then and that's why you don't know there were a fuck ton of for example german and french realms from the start?
---
Once by you perhaps but for the past month this sub has been circle jerking constantly about how streamers existence will ruin classic. Let’s focus on actual issues like sharding.
---
&gt; we need a common language for all of us to be able to communicate in, no matter what country you come from.
---
I agree, but we're not there yet. Forcing english in all of europe will alienate more than 50% of the potential players. In fact this will lead to "english" servers that are basically declared French, German, Italian. And if you don't speak that language you'll have to either transfer out or start from scratch.
---
The main goal of my comment (albeit I got a little rambly) was just to say that different people enjoy different things, and it's disappointing to see this community devolve into name-calling when they don't enjoy the same thing.
---
But 100%, the impact that streamers and layering have on the game is important, and I hope Blizz and/or the community find someway to allow both groups to play the game how they want. I admittedly dont know the most about layering - I'm going to have to read that link you posted!
---
It is the most important thing atm that will have the largest long term affect on classic. So yes it should be the most talked about.
---
You are missing the point. There will be no english speaking servers...
---
Just go Horde? I don't see the problem here
---
&gt;Blizzard has a much bigger market research department than you do.
---
And yet, we had `you think you do but you dont` and Classic development only started when they saw real numbers their research department failed to notice.
---
Explain why Illidan is Chinese then?
---
People congregate where there are established player bases.
---
Classic patch notes saying 8.1.5. We done for
---
It's statistics... Obviously not an entire country will play WoW. But statistically of 100 Italians playing WoW, 34 of them will be able to speak English.
---
There's other factors to consider, like age group. You are welcome to research it.
---
It believe it was as well, it used to be actual English language servers, rather than just European. You had plenty of EU boys in there, not native English speakers, but it was definitely expected that you spoke English.
---
Because all movies and tv shows are dubbed in german.
---
1.  You won't be filthy scum
---
2.  You won't be edgy filthy scum
---
3.  You will feel better about yourself because you're not filthy scum
---
&gt;I really can't see many downsides to having English-only servers.
---
What if when you get to 60 and the layers disappear you find yourself in a 90% italian server? I'm Italian and I remember back on Crushridge/Hakkar where the few non italians playing on the server were brutally shut down in general chat. It's not good.
---
Layering is something they have to use to give us the long term server populations we want, but they are outwardly doing a poor job of it. 
---
More and more I get the feeling that Blizzard is going to just leave it as is and assume players will adapt. 
---
I see that as a colossal fuck up on par with announcing Diablo Immortal at Blizzcon. 
---
I know there are a lot of players that don’t give a shit about either of those things and they may be Blizzards new target audience.
---
How much was your crystal ball, oh wise one? I bet those idiots on literally every pserver were wrong by dynamically changing multiple aspects of the game to fit a 15k server, huh
---
Only against frost mages :P
---
&gt;  Just go with a megaserver 
---
??? Do you know why there is layering?
---
How awesome would it be to prove them dead wrong again?
---
Talking about it is fine, as long as it's constructive. Do you think Blizzard is going to care about someone saying "OMG layering is terrible, you are ruining Classic"?
---
Thank you for your answer, I have a much clearer vision of the situation. And I know why they would open more server in the future.
---
By design your poll is flawed because it's in english on an english subreddit.
---
But even with that, i bet that French even being fluent in english want a French server.
---
Yes, could be interesting to see statistics with age groups.
---
Don't count on people being exposed to English in there everyday life. In Germany, pretty much all TV is dubbed.
---
So spam would not happen w/o streamers and layers?
---
Aren't there UK servers on retail ? Long time I did not bother with the garbage that is retail, but I remember there were server lists for "French" "German" and I think "UK" or maybe it was "english". In that case my bad, that's what I meant.
---
It’s a shard but as big as the whole continent, not a quest hub or whatever they are in retail
---
I have a recollection that the first time I did this quest, which was during vanilla in 2006 or so, it was green, but then the second time I did it which was in TBC, it was blue. Could be a flawed memory though.
---
Additional you may actually want to meet some people from your guild in reallive. Thats significantly easier if they don't live in Greece or Portugal.
---
My main fear with Classic is the population problem... Yesterday playing in stress test 3 I invaded Barrens and there was like 15 horde players in a hour I stayed there. At the same time in server 15, that the streamers chose, Staysafe grouped more than a 100 players to storm OG and when he got there he faced more than a 100 horde players defending it. 
---
So, if we start dividing servers too much I fear we'll have lots of "server 3" in a couple months, even more if the streamers are all grouped in 1\~2 servers.
---
Wrong. 
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow
---
Zul'Jin on retail already. Don't pick a server with a Z if you don't want to re-roll. There's 350 people online right now on my guild and we are not the "hardcore" guild of the french-canadians or the biggest. We have guilds on both horde and alliance. That's why I think you are egocentric, you don't believe 9 million people can fill a server.
---
Chinese people still exist.
---
You are not approaching this matter macroscopically. A certain percentage of Germans is willing to play the game. That percentage is much higher if there are German servers. *That is why movies are being dubbed, it is more attractive for the consumers*. 45% of Germans do not speak English well enough to participate in a normal conversation. That percentage is among the lowest in Europe!
---
You can project onto individuals and victim blame them as much as you want. Heck, you are preaching to the choir. I am part of that demographic that really liked learning vocabulary through games like Diablo.
---
But we are one side of the coin and there is another.
---
I am not going to roll on a German server myself. But please don’t be so selfish. Just because you prefer to play on an international server does not mean others should not have the option to roll on a national server.
---
What this will lead to is ghettos. And if you think those Spanish people with almost 80% of Not English speaking as opposed to 45% will use this as an opportunity to finally learn English... *think again*.

People say it's going to ruin the community as if diversity is a bad thing.  Communities within communities are ok.
---
&gt;Can we establish that this is beta? And there is a plan (I get people don’t trust it) BUT there is a plan to remove it. 
---
&gt;So is it a massive surprise that sharding is happening in stress tests/beta? 
---
Irrelevant - they have confirmed layering is in at launch.
---
Nobody will care when the game launches.
---
Majority of people speak English, why wouldnt there be ?
---
Nobody has said they have communication with blizzard. They have CLEARLY made mistakes, their sub count verifies that. And no classic isn’t a new game nor a new expansion, but it’s something that many people have never experienced before, and the start of what wow is today. You are absolutely delusional if you think classic will stay populated if nothing is ever added. People will get tired of it just as they always have at the end of expansions.
---
Wunderbar
---
You forgot *"How to [anything]"* guides
---
Pick RP server if you want to avoid streamers, or MAKE research where those s\*\*tsout nabs are going to stream
---
It is known.
---
I don´t get how this is so hard. Players of a language will flock to a server so Blizzard may as well moderate this proccess by marking the servers.
---
Most guilds probably would have broken up because you basically take the top 25-30ish people and then the left overs are too much of a mess to do anything(bad attendence, attitude, computer/internet, just plain don't know how to play).
---
Yes, because both things have nothing to do with each other.
---
Precisely.
---
Blizzard thinks it will be less than 300k.
---
Oh man...how wrong they are:)
---
And the wake up call will be on August 13th.
---
I have game knowledge that carries over many of the most popular competitive games and I have a technical background.
---
Whereas you have neither a technical background nor skill and knowledge in any game - so who's opinion is invalid here?
---
As I said message me which game you want to know my account name for and you can add me and verify it's me :)
---
Just because you say “times change” doesn’t mean people want to ply with streamers
---
I think they actually said the first few weeks of phase 1.
---
Lol k see ya
---
We are pretty small country (CZE) and we "made" two (I think) "unofficial language realms" ever since vanilla I wanna say.
---
But I agree with you, it's usually big countries like France, Spain, Russia etc not even attempting to speak english.
---
I hate to spoil this for you but this is OP's idea of a joke and there is no addon.
---
Because we all would actually prefer sharding of uncontested zones over this fucking non-sense.

I’m not even judging you because I read it the same way to begin with! Had to go back and reread the title because something seemed off lol
---
they really suck at making money tho lmao, their brand is hurting and every single game is tanking right now.. blizzard keeps laying off more people, morale is low and every new game continues to be worse than the last.  
---
Blizzard should be making atleast 10x what they do today, but they fucked up and ruined most of their franchises and got lazy.
---
You're*
---
Game is also still horribly lagging on large scale outdoor battles on the stress test servers.
---
Yes it makes a difference, especially on FPS games or something like that. On classic wow? It doesn’t matter. I’ll probably be playing on my couch with a 55 inch tv and trey for mouse and keyboard.
---
The issue with that is someone NOT on this sub may roll onto a server, level a bunch without grouping and then once they realize it’s all a different language they wasted hours of their time.
---
" and it's not like 1 group of players will be ahead of the pack..."
---
It's usually what happen tho, the one being able to play the first 2 days without sleeping will definitively be ahead.
---
Short answer, no. 
---
They go off statistics. If they thought enough German players could fill one server that’s what they would do.
---
And when random person starts playing the vidya game and at lvl 15 realizes that literally everyone on his server is speaking french and suddenly has to reroll?
---
&gt;Now I know some people are thinking "if you don't speak fluently english in 2019, then it's their problem"
---
Anyone who thinks this is an absolute idiot. They wouldn't touch a French only game with a 10ft pole. People should be free to play multiplayer games in their own language.
---
How you can have any faith in blizzard after BFA is beyond me. They launched the expansion with shaman Spriest and frost DK all fucked. So the “it’s just the beta” thing had already been said about all 3 classes. You blizz honks will buy into a company that has been fucking its own franchise for years just because they have into the idea of classic. I know they’ll add wow tokens and blow the game wait for that one, and they’ll use gold farmers as a faux excuse. How anyone can be positive from a company that said “you think you do, but you don’t.” Is fucking beyond me.
---
Your english is basic not fluent. There are tons of mistakes in your post, try to improve it a lil bit more.
---
Yes - I get that, at launch it’s in, so are people expecting it to be off in beta?
---
Hey, does anyone knows if I could play on RU server with English localization and vice versa like it's happening on retail now? Or will it be Russian ghetto like it was during BC? It's very important for me. I don't wanna play with Russian localization but I'm afraid my friends and my wife would want to. Thanks.

Can the 7.8% that don't speak English explain me how they found and answered the poll ?
---
You know I'm one of those conspiracy theorists :o
---
I was expect s prospective employee to tell me that.
---
If you can't fathom that if you **don't** do something. I **don't** have to recruit you.
---
You make easy for a recruiter to hire, then you'll find your interview prospects are better. I will still want a reference on my terms.
---
You fucking savage..
---
Well, there is nothing wrong in learning and improving a language other than your native. There are people outside of France, Germany, Spain etc. that never ever had any game translated into their language, and yet, there they are, happy.
---
They would need at least 3 servers per language (pve/pvp/rp), not just 1.
---
You can still play together, just pick a realm you all decide to play on
---
Instead of realm 1,2 and 3
---
It would just be Realm English, Spanish and German 
---
If they have no problem speaking English then all play on the English realm
---
I’m not sure what he’s talking about. Both use 3 buttons for the most part. 
---
Warrior was actually more fun imo.
---
Look the mess with CS:GO when ruskies play with Europeans.... That's why they do separates server for them. :p
---
Classic is going to be great, it's gotta be great, you know this is gonna be great. Classic is going to be great, and if it doesn't work out, i-i-if Classic doesn't work out, Classic is going to be great anyway, cuz you know why? We're going to make it great, that's why.
---
I was in France for vacation, I couldn't even order a water in english because they didn't (want) to understand me. And it was a tourist place... I got an orange juice in the end....
---
Dude. Do it like a boss.
---
These ”language specific” realms will be created naturally, when players speaking the samw language move to the same realms. No need for Blizzard to step in.
---
He is toxic, but he’s not wrong lol
---
Those kids will be around for like 70 years. Classic WoW only (re)launches once
---
&gt; The dub culture in Germany basically started after WW2 because most germans couldn't speak english. It made sense back then.
---
It's not that easy. I understand and speak fluent english, but some actors have such a horrible accent, that it's acoustically extremly hard to understand the words they say. You'd still need english dubs with people who can speak english without an accent. Because lets be honest, no one likes to read subtitles.
---
&gt;you do know that WoW was regarded a laughably easy, casual MMO compared to everything that came before it.
---
True, but I think this was during a time when video gaming was going through a pseudo revolution. Gamers were geeky nerds with no lives. You didn't have YouTube videos of Vin Diesel playing D&amp;D and actually enjoying it / role playing.
---
&gt;and you do know that the genre as a whole is dying off?
---
Is it though? Isn't the 2nd coming of WoW Classic evidence that the genre has lost it's way and is returning to former glory by reconnecting with its roots?
---
That not the subject, but you are right, we are proud of our langage. Also our history know too well how a langage die and why is a loss for mankind, because it's not just a vector of information. Language make you thing a particular way, change the langage, you change you interpretation of the world.
---
We were obviously too mind-closed about learning english. But we had pretty good reason, to be careful (especially when in parallel we were building painfully the E.U.. Btw UK didn't help to make us confident to learn english without making in danger our own language).
---
I'd be surprised if it was that big of a difference. The reality is that classic is pulling in a much bigger demographic, but at the same time there are many more reasons why a player might not to continue all the way to 60 than you listed.
---
very good argument.... not
---
Your version doesn't really work well. there's not that many layers and 5 mages sharing exp won't be that strong.
---
But something like 2 mages far ahead sharing 3-5 layers, that could be devastating if they can quickly and reliably switch layer.
---
Most US servers on retail wow have TONS of non-English speakers from South America. I have invited so many Spanish speakers to my m+ groups that don’t speak any English and fuck the whole thing up. So even with language locked servers, I’m sure a large number of people will just ignore that and play where they want.
---
You mean 10 days in /played right? Since it will be atleast a month for a person with a healthy sleep/work pattern to get there
---
Here's the problem I see, and it's why the people saying "only a few weeks", "just to make the starting zones playable" and "to avoid queue times" are telling at least one lie. 
---
Those three statements can literally not all be true.
---
So let's say the streamers decide to play on the server "Thrall", this will be a popular server, let's say that 30k people roll there at launch. A modest estimate. So Thrall gets about 10 layers at peak, 3k players per layer. 
---
So the launch goes smoothly, no queue times and people are able to complete the starter zones.
---
It's 3 weeks later, condition 1 has been met, it's "been a few weeks".
---
The population has spread out all over the world, there's some people at max level in the endgame, some people rerolling and making alts in the starter zones. And lots of people throughout the midgame. Condition 2 has been met, no longer are "the starting zones not playable". 
---
So it's time to drop layering, right? Let's say the server pop has dropped off by 66% after the 3 weeks, that's a generous number I think. You now have 10k people trying to join Thrall... You will have queue times. So now condition 3 has been broken. So does layering go back on?
---
Was condition 3 a lie the entire time? Or was condition 2 the lie? Perhaps it was condition 1 that is complete bullshit and instead of "a few weeks", layering is here to stay until the end of phase 1. "Condition 1b".
---
So skip ahead a few months and phase 1 is coming to an end, time to finally drop layering right? 
---
Hopefully the server population has dropped by 90% and we're at a healthy 3k player base. But wait, dire maul is coming out... New content, new things to do, I can finally start farming Honor. Yes! People start playing again, server population surges, queue times ramp up... Oh no... 
---
Do we turn layering back on again? I mean, condition 1b has been met, but now condition 3 has been broken again. This will not do, people don't like queue times and layering protects them from that. 
---
Condition 1c! Layering will be removed by the end of phase 2. Pinky promise. 
---
But the same thing happens again... 
---
You know what, I think it's decided that the best thing for the health of classic is just to keep layering in perpetuity. Because all 3 conditions we set are just not being met. 
---
Have we been lied too the entire time? Are we being lied too right now?
---
We just have to make sure that it's not just within this sub. We would have to spread the message everywhere, official forums, youtubers etc.
---
I'm french. To be honest, I don't know what to think of this.
---
Deep down I am a little bit disappointed, because claiming to bring back the classic WoW experience from 14 years ago while changing the way languages and servers are handled is contradictory. I hear the EU players not from France/Germany/UK (and later-on Italy and Spain) that always experienced this and says it's not really a problem. But you can also understand that from our point of view we are not going to experience the same thing as we did back in time. Also, it might end up worst for you guys, because if the german and french communities unofficially choose specific servers, you could end up on a server where english is a minority.
---
That being said, I also can see myself living with international servers.
---
What I mostly find disturbing, is that Blizzard claimed they implemented Layering to avoid empty servers. But at the same time plan to go with international servers for fear of what's supposed to be fixed by layering. I mean, I cannot imagine a single PvP and PvE server per major country not having enough population.
---
&gt;and it's not like 1 group of players will be ahead of the pack...
---
That's usually how it goes lmao
---
They do scale on retail like that because the entire server is sharded. Everyone here loses their shit over sharding and layering to help scale out the environment, so at some point if blizzard wants to disable those features they need to collapse them into a single instance that can hold all of the players.
---
The fact that a small country "made" two unofficial language realms just proves how big of a problem it is. If a small country can do that, what about a country like Germany? Of course they can't give realms to all languages, but "taking the big ones out" would vastly improve things and have little to no negatives (with small countries it could cause problems down the line with ghost realms and not enough players from the country to fix).
---
Scandinavian language speakers were definitely not an issue because a) they were happy to speak English, and b) they did not take over a server unofficially. My experience was from Hakkar EU in classic and it was 99% Italian. You could not do anything as an English player, Danish player, German player, or whatever. If Blizzard don't create servers for specific languages, the risk is that one nationality will just take over a server unofficially, and if you don't speak that language you are stuck.
---
There's a big difference between being Constructively Angry and throwing a Toddler Tantrum.
---
Isn´t Nost &amp; the entire pserver community Russian/Asian based?
---
It was bugged at one point that it was both green and blue. The item name was blue but when you looked at the item it was green. It was stated it was a bug and was fixed but I dont know when.
---

---
Damn dude. I can’t believe two wow devs said it was a design limitation, but random internet guy is telling me is was because of technical reasons. This is just crazy!
---
Seriously, shut up.
---
It's a game, not only that but it's a game that entirely relies on community. You should be able to converse in your own language. English is commonly spoken sure but not everyone speaks it, why should they? Especially in their free time.
---
The entire reason modern WoW is different from Classic is that its playerbase *hates* tedium and time investment.
---
I played on Warsong EU, the unofficial Russian server of pre-WotLK era. Everything was on Russian. Not sure if it was allowed, or if it's Blizz who couldn't ban thousands.
---
&gt;Nobody has said they have communication with blizzard. They have CLEARLY made mistakes, their sub count verifies that.
---
Please provide evidence of a mmorpg title that still has a subscription only based model with the amount of subs that wow has?
---
People like you make Call of Duty $1 billion annually.
---
Because it doesn't matter if the quality of the content is shit if the playerbase is there.
---
To believe that BFA could hold the sub numbers from launch to the following June is dumb.
---
&gt;You are absolutely delusional if you think classic will stay populated if nothing is ever added. People will get tired of it just as they always have at the end of expansions.
---
Diablo 3 hasn't added shit in years and still has thousands of players. 
---
People get tired at the end of expansions because they know EVERYTHING they do WONT matter in a couple months when level cap is increased again and fabricated time gates get reimplemtned.
---
Why do people like you assume exactly 2 years from now everyone will be t3 and r14 geared? 
---
It's going to take the MAJORITY of players MONTHS to hit 60 - unlike you that will hit it within 20 days of launch because since you'll put 12 hours in every day of the week.
---
I'm sure we all would, but it feels like it's some kind of unseen nightmare on the back end that they don't want.
---
They're doing everything they can to avoid it.
---
Why is it a problem? They like using their own language
---
I'm a french-canadian and used to play with a bunch of others. I had an english client, but some of them had french clients. Even back then, communication was tough at times because of the difference in names. Can't imagine seeing that happen at a server scale.
---
Looking good. Needs more layers...

---
Of course I did thats why I specifically chose a German server. We wont have specific servers this time so this wont be a problem?
---
If you are "invading" a server, it would be nice with some helpful text notification in general chat for starting zones/Barrens/alliance equivalent
---
Its ok we can make our unofficial server again. Belakjuk majd az egyiket :D! 
---
But jokes aside, im ok speaking english on an international server.
---
Love it. Can't wait to hang out at The Gallows' End Tavern again.
---
Dude same here. Someone called me a dumbass for even thinking they would do that. And I too was down voted like crazy
---
This is either blizzard being an American company and has no idea that not every eu country is the same when it comes to, not just langusge# but culture, values and other attitudes to things.
---
Or more likely as many have said, they do not believe classic will have any staying power... Which is just sad.
---

---
Not dutch, but I agree, I'd pick an english server anyway.
---
Thanks for sharing. I cannot wait to do some of those dungeons while leveling. 
---
Unpopular opinion: BFD is the best low-lvl dungeon.
---
Which further shows that this is the wrong direction they're heading, do you believe that people who consume dubbed content do so in spite of English, the international language?
---
Also comparing raw numbers they'll be more native French speaking (or German respectively) players than English ones, do these people have not the option to enjoy the game in their mother tongue because English is more internationally recognized? 
---
That's wrong in my opinion.
---
An email isnt a notice of resignation. fail troll
---
Honestly , after having played on a server where half the population ( or more ) was chinese and you couldn't even read what they were typing because the characters didn't exist in the english pack , so their texts were blank.
---
All you'd see is :
---
:
---
Honestly, any language you can see can be translated and communication can happen, so it's not really a big issue having all the european languages on the same server.
---
Not to mention most of the people who played at the start of vanilla had to learn english regardless, mainly because in 2004 the only version of wow was english and if you wanted to read quests you were compelled to squeeze in some knowledge of the language somewhere just to function.
---
J'ai rien compris.
---
5 players in the server of thousands would have the advantage either way... layering changes nothing.
---
Why the fuck does it matter if people hit 60 before you?
---
The close classic gets to releasing the bigger the number of fortnite players join this sub, it's bananas!
---
I'm French, I wouldn't mind to play on a full English or full French server, but not a mix of German, French, Italian, Spanish and English (and all the other European languages).
---
Most of my countrymen don't speak English at all and will never play classic if the server isn't full French.
---
Blizzard really wants classic to fail imo.
---
Fwiw, the French private server has a bit less than 5000 lvl 60 players that were active less than a week ago (I'm not one of them).
---
You are the one being egocentric by refusing to just play a game in english. And no english is not my native tongue, but I'm not egocentric enough to enforce my native language down everyone's throat.
---
It makes a Little bit of sense. 
---
Only due to the sharding/phasing whatevery Change though.
---
Since due to that there won't be a lot of Servers.
---
If they were to make German and Fench Servers - the only feasible way to do that with Phasing/Sharding is by only giving a PVP or PVE realm to them. Both would not work because there wouln't be enough Players. If they didn't do sharding on those Servers the community would go mental. 
---
I think thanks to sharding/phasing we have this Change now. It is not because Blizzard really wanted to fuck this up - it is because there is no other feasible Option with this shit in place.
---
I totally see your Point m8 really! Although I don't really mind talking english - I don't want to be on a purely French Server in the end (no offense Baguettes) /s 
---
But yeah... One stupid idea leads to the next one :3 It is in the end - all down to saving Server Money I guess.. :) Blizzlike is what I call that :D
---
No it’s not sarcasm. Literally for speed running raids half your raid was fury warriors. Might have 2-3 rogues.
---
Is general chat even shared between layers? I've not read too much in detail about how everything works, but I thought I saw somewhere that it would be separate.
---
yes
---
This is why I'm looking forward to someone putting out a list of what servers have which streamers. So I can avoid them like the plague. Some content creators are pretty good (Madseason) but I just never could wrap my head around watching someone play a game live.
---
Thank you for the reply. If I rolled a Troll then earning the PvP trinket 'Insignia of the horde' for a fear, slow, and polymorph would probably be a top priority.
---
Their statistics are based on private server...which is stupid.
---
There is no statistic of Classic WoW demand. NONE. ZERO. NADA. ZIP.
---
Blizzard is DEAD WRONG in their expectations of Classic.
---
Bless you. You're doin' The Light's Work.

For the Alliance, man!

No no no. Blizzard is the anti christ despite them investing significant resources even developing classic in the first place. They’re going to keep layering forever just to spite this vocal minority
---
Imagine 15k/7.5k people in a major city at once, that's not just server lag that's actual PC lag
---
It's not the regular players who act like dictators though. It's streamers like Soda and his idea of blacklisting anyone who oppose him.
---
This is my experience as well. I was shocked because obviously I know the stereotype of France not wanting to talk anything but French, but I usually assume stereotypes are somewhat wrong. And don't get me wrong, I have learned to know several French people that speak English fine, or even some that have a hard time with it but tries their best. Even so, it's a shockingly high amount of people here that seem to not want to understand English. Like you say with ordering, I've tried it with coffee. I can't believe someone is too stupid to understand "two coffees, please", I even tried to say "two café" (I know café is French, but I can't count in French) and show two fingers, but she just looked at me like she didn't want to help unless I made a full French sentence.
---
I really don't want to make French people out as bad guys, but this is not a one time occasion, and it just proves how much language realms are needed in Classic.
---
les bons jours d'archimonde quand ulcan rageait sur tS
---
Thats the dumbest argument ever. Simply becouse its not the most internationally spoken language in the entire europe. English is.
---
Every company has a rearch department you flagellating moron. If it was that simple retail wouldn't have been bad in the first place and there'd be no need to make classic.
---
This "they know what they're doing" meme needs to end. Nobody has any fucking idea what's going on about anything, that's why the stock market is a dangerous place to put your money.
---
There is another classic cast with mark kern, and he said the same thing. Do you know Mark kern? The team lead on vanilla wow? 
---
Dude hahah walk away
---
I've had great times gaming with people from the Netherlands but a shit ass time trying to raid with some random from brazil.
---
No reason to play alliance, none.
---
auto attacking a boar &gt; multi stage bossfight with a beloved character with amazing visuals and thematicallt appropriate mechanics
---
And all female dwarfs, as emancipation movement to smite evil
---
You can look for that but its certainly not needed to play. If you want more meaningful communication you will find the people who want it too, most of the time in your guild and less often with randoms in the world. Thats how it always was, even on same language  servers.
---
/join world (only speak english here)
---
/join french/german/... (speak the appropriate language here) 
---
Fixed!
---
That was sooooooo hard (or learn english, its easy, murican did it so all europe can do it in few weeks)
---
I think the dominant language, if they're lowering the options, will be English regardless
---
&gt;Edit: anndddd yes, 20k player cap literally means 20k players are on at that time. Man, this hole you’re digging keeps getting deeper and deeper
---
You literally must be dumb.
---
Single server caps wont be in effect until after layering is removed.
---
Go out for a walk and read a God damn book for once.
---
On a PvP server, you could get attacked at anytime from any class while your in the middle of doing anything.
---
So your builds include more utility, more control, more "oh shit" buttons. more base health.
---
On PvE server, you control when, where, and what your fighting, so unless your a tank you don't need as much health.
---
you can sacrafice, utility, control, and "oh shit" buttons, to get more raw damage or healing throughput, and more uptime.
---
Agreed
---
No the problem is, that every actor has a different accent and don't speak proper english.
---
If you want to change the dub situation in Europe, you first have to remove different accents from media.
---
Blizz knows this is happening.  Streamers have been doing it.
---
Take your downvotes and GTFO retard.
---
I like your optimism despite how terribly wrong you are about that mage hunter thing.
---
You mean the 6 million players who stopped playing?
---
Dumb post.
---
Well maybe Layering wont be bad. We can just trap all the streamers in one layer with their followers and we can chill in our layer.
---
Another bonus: You don't have to play with Russians.
---
I've said this in many posts regarding layering:  An assumption is being made that players will easily be able to tell what layer they are on.  As far as I'm aware, there's no UI element that's going to say you are on Moon Guard-1.
---
For your scenario to work, each Mage would have to be on a separate layer, know that they are on a separate layer, and each would have to disband/form the group to change layers.
---
Do you not like onions?!?
---
That is true... I certainly didn't Google anything back then - but that might have been due to the fact that there were German realms - or my friends were already playing on a certain realm.
---
I really think most of the Problems will just solve themselves in the end. Most 10 y/o are quite good with phones/Computer and Google nowadays but I totally get your Point really!!
---
I guess we will just have to wait and see - if Blizzard is not going to Change anything as always....
---
What happened to #nochanges?
---
It literally costs like $10 to transfer lol
---
I agree there's a lot of toxic comments, but they should mod those, not block a whole thread and reduce visibility of the issue.

The solution is free realm transfers for the first few months.
---
Think how many problems this would solve.
---
1. You could join old friends if it so happened they started on a different server to you
---
2. You could join streamers - or dodge them
---
3. You could migrate to the "unofficial" server of all the folks that speak your desired language
---
Seriously... free realm transfers, for say, the first three months, allows the population to sort itself out to a large degree.
---
I honestly don't care, I can ignore them like I used to ignore gold farmers. I don't have to play with anyone I don't want to.
---
Afaik cross-faction collusion is against the ToS so I think it wouldn't be allowed.

May I ask what chest this is?

This technology is brilliant.

Because i want to see the competition between those going for the first lvl 60 without all these abusable thing that were not in vanilla ?
---
I mean, if you don't care at all about the world around you because you don't feel concerned, you might as well play retail you won't see the difference.
---
Now, if only there was a way to force them all onto the same server so they and their fans can all have a giant circle jerk, and leave the rest of the servers for us.

Asking "why people can't just two or three languages" when NA themselves can only speak one is quite something. It's because not everyone has the time (or need). That's coming from someone who can speak 5 languages, but I still think Blizz' decision is incredibly stupid.
---
Naturally, there will always be people who can't speak any English and these people are the ones who are actually fucked.
---
Your opinion is shit :)
---
There was many server launches back in vanilla and every time there were people far ahead of the pack, and pservers while being inaccurate are still good representative in how good and dedicated nolifers can escape the zerg and get an advantage from not having people around them, which further boosts their leveling.
---
Then it shouldn't be too hard for you to find it for us, should it?
---
All I can easily write and read english, i'm just terrible at speaking and hearing it correctly. Raid means discord or other vocal communication. I've been in one (private server) and I almost wype my whole raid because I didn't get what people were saying to me. Because it's not "english", it's "in action gaming term with weird accent situational english where everyone speak at the same time" and i'm already having some difficulties understanding english, especially when i'm busy getting chasing by a raid's boss
---
I don't mind everyone being english, I will just write. But my guild will be french. And most of people are going to do the same. And pick up groups are gonna be hard, or language exclusive.
---
Oh, ok. Maybe it was green in an earlier patch of vanilla. Thanks!
---
You are a god.
---
What's a bruh? 
---
Lagging and disconnects &gt; layering/sharding. Doesn't mean someone hurt me, were you abused?
---
fuck yeah i made it in. 
---
hi alex hi hank
---
Lol because hitting 60 is the only thing in the game.
---
I'll happily be playing classic while 3 months in you'll be back to playing league or apex.
---
Really shouldnt.
---
The entire post is about after layers collapse. Like, is this guy trolling?
---
16 is fine, 8 until zg would have been nice though.
---
If you're EU, don't resub, you won't be able to play.
---
If you're NA, it's up to you but know that the stress test(which is what you're invite to) will end today I believe.
---
English is not my primary language but I think for a classic reboot international servers make more sense. Been in so many english speaking guild over the last 15 years and its the natural way.
---
I can see why playing on EU realms is a good thing, really. I play Guild Wars 2 on a EU-Server since launch and every game in english (voice acting is so much better and I feel more immersed). 
---
And yeah, a stress test at normal hours needs to happen. On language-restricted servers as well as EU-servers. 
---
At the end of the day I am quite sure that people will adapt if they release EU-server.
---
A lot of people hate server mergers.
---
It forces name changes.
---
Neck yourself
---
Looks like its going to be great.
---
This type of stuff didn't even need the streamer to happen in the last 2 stress tests. Oh yeah, it made the chat go *even* faster, definitely! But just by having people wanna join eachothers events this type of inv spam ensued, no streamer necessary. It was bonkers
---
Why do we have to clean up Blizzard's shit all the time? We're paying them money. We have no obligations to create "work-arounds". However we have the full right to complain about the status quo.
---
Is it gonna translate your english to their language too so that you can actually communicate with them?
---
They'd better enlist an army of ban hammer happy GMs then !
---
Well, back in days I was 11 years old, and my English sucked as much as possible, but I learned it thanks to WoW. I'm from Serbia, and then there was not a single digital game, software, etc on my language.
---
Also, I agree with you on authenticity, but 100% vanilla experience would mean that there are no layering, but there it is. It is what it is. At least we have a chance to play vanilla again. Enough for me.
---
And the entire purpose of the post is...
---
"People will hit 60 before me, and I don't like it!"
---
It is kind of exactly what you meant though. If you are involved at all with IT infrastructure in the last few years, you’ve probably heard about containers and elastic compute. Blizzard uses this technology to spin up instances of the game world when there is a large number of players and then removes those instances when player volume decreases and collapses them together. It’s highly likely there isn’t any one server instance that ties a character to a server anymore, and the server name that your character was created on is simply metadata.
---
Been a Warcraft fan my whole life have lost countless months to this amazing game already can't wait to give it even more, this time as and adult! What a great cool thing we get to have back guys!
---
My brother (french) can read basic english especially when on a subject he knows well (manga/games/3D stuff). But he can't talk/understand english and can only write simple sentences.
---
Did you read the source article google warrior ?  
---
"Use of YouTube has increased by 11 percentage points since 2016, to 48% for 3-4s, by 17 percentage
---
points to 71% for 5-7s and by eight percentage points to 81% for 8-11s. Ninety per cent of 12-15s 
---
use YouTube, unchanged since last year. Half of YouTube users aged 3-4 and a quarter aged 5-7 only 
---
use the YouTube Kids app rather than the main YouTube website or app.". 
---
The article is saying that that 81% of  8-11 year olds from that pool watch youtube, which is a 13+ website with guardian permission. So those 8-11 year olds could've lied to be anywhere from 13-x not 18+ specifically.
---
!remindme august 14th, 2019
---
Idk about your situation but as an 11 year old trying to explain to my parents why I needed more money to spend on the game they already paid £40 for and £15 a month for wouldn't go down too well. TBC round the corner too.
---
Doesn't the EU announcement mean that NA could be also merged with South American countries? Or have they announced otherwise?
---
We fought the British invasion and kept our culture for hundreds of years. 9 million peoples speak french in the north. Come tell that to my face and that's my dick ill shove down your throat.
---
Fact of the matter is, the majority of europeans are not native english speakers and will revert to their mother tongue if possible. It will be uncomfortable for everybody and a mess.
---
I logged in yesterday, and it was not difficult to tag mobs although the starting Zones were pretty busy.
---
I’ve played private servers with way crazier launches and even with dynamic Respawn no chance at killing anything.
---
Layering does not need to be in the game. If you come from retail and haven’t played other fresh launches your opinion is irrelevant because you have nothing to compare it to. 
---
Instead of putting up with layering for a few weeks, or all of phase one when a lot of people will already be downing MC and farming mats,  id rather put up with crowded starter zones for a day.
---
There's more native English speakers in the world than French speakers in the entire world. There's more English speakers than there is French, German and Spanish put together in the world.
---
You'd be right if your argument didn't discriminate against smaller languages at the same time, implying they don't don't deserve the same option. And even though Germany and France are considered to be worse at English they're still not bad.
---
&gt;If Blizzard doesn't believe the german classic population to be big enough to warrant localized servers
---
they do have local servers.
---
Ping and Language are two different things. Apples and oranges.
---
Lol, good luck Mr. Edge.
---
Yup, just the stress test, that ends at 5pm EDT today. You SHOULD get an email if you get actual beta access.
---
TAKE MY MONEY! LET ME PLAY CLASSIC! D:
---
Well he still has a brow - it's just not hairy originally. I think that was clear mistake - hair does not make brows more sympathetic. Look at Wall-E
---
 Ping and Language are two different things. Apples and oranges
---
Doesn't matter - streamer servers will be packed and have 2 options
---
- sit in a 6 hour queue
---
- free transfer to a dead server
---
Nobody outside of streamer servers will care about layering in October.
---
I was on a pserver doing my Paladin quest and got laughed at for saying BFD is one of my favorite dungeons. Plan on making the haul over there and havin a blast with it on classic as well.
---
Have never played WoW hardcore so... good assumption. But are you saying wow hasn’t lost the majority of its player base? Because the numbers say something totally different, seems like you’re wrong on that front too. 
---
People don’t leave because their items will be obsolete, they leave because they’re done with the current content in their opinion. Not everyone goes for t3 and r14, I would say the vast majority don’t. The time allotted for expansions allows for people to do what they want for the content before they’re done.
---
Also, Diablo? Do you understand they have pretty much completely redid that game? I guess you just like saying things that you believe back your opinion without actually researching it. 
---
Again, blizzard has a chance to remake their game without going through the same mistakes they did last time, and they should absolutely take it. Not only for their wallets and their stocks, but for the large portion of their player base that actually wants it. Would be a straight up disappointment for them to take an opportunity like this and just not touch it for it to rot away and be obsolete within a couple years compared to what it could be.
---
Esports have little to do with it, artificial lag makes the game feel like shit.
---
Well mainly depends about how much faster they can kill mobs when they are 5 instead of 2 and if they have access to enough of packs by layer hopping.
---
5 mages killing 50 mobs while being in the same group will still yield more xp than 2 mages killing 20.
---
I mean was anyone even playing the stress test?
---
Streamers generate content whether you like how they do it or not. 
---
Outside of the first couple of hours the stress test (and only after servers were consolidated) chats were Dead. Barrens chat on the beta server open to everyone that finally allows players to go to the Barrens and be relevant was completely dead. Yet a streamer turns a massively out of reach zone into a hub of player generated content. 
---
You can not like streamers and play on a different server than they are. Hating streamers because they are creating the only emergent player content is just kind of pathetic. 
---
I just don't understand how people can be so bent out of shape about streamers that they let it consume them and control their ability to enjoy a game we've all been waiting a decade to be re-released. 
---
This whole anti-streamer fanaticism has to be one of the most pathetic form of gatekeeping there has ever been.
---
I reckon, by your statement, very few have
---
Guilds are supposed to be prioritized into the same layer.
---
&gt;But are you saying wow hasn’t lost the majority of its player base? Because the numbers say something totally different, seems like you’re wrong on that front too.
---
Entirely irrelevant.
---
&gt;People don’t leave because their items will be obsolete, they leave because they’re done with the current content in their opinion. 
---
Wrong. You are talking about the majority and not the existing playerbase.
---
&gt;Also, Diablo? Do you understand they have pretty much completely redid that game? I guess you just like saying things that you believe back your opinion without actually researching it. 
---
Hey mr. Research - when did they redo it? 2018? 2017? 2016? You are just speaking out of your ass.
---
&gt;Again, blizzard has a chance to remake their game without going through the same mistakes they did last time, and they should absolutely take it.
---
They aren't remaking their game, you fortnite kids just don't get it... they are releasing vanilla for people to play on official blizzard servers... AND THATS IT.
---
Dynamic spawns don't preserve what Vanilla was like and layering isn't used to solve the problem of zone overcrowding since each layer is roughly the pop size of a vanilla pop server circa 2k4-2k6
---
Try again.
---
Well, I guess you and your friends (and all of us) are both pathethic pathethic, but each one in their own way
---
well with what I was proposing it wouldn't effect duskwood... as it is contested... plus none of the world boss stuff matters because that is Phase 2 and they have promised no phasing/layering after Phase 1.
---
&gt; I understand that in some europeans countries kid learn from a very young age to speak english
---
At least in Germany, they're, from personal experience, mostly dogshit at it. From all the people I know, I am the only one fluent enough in English to even write this response - and that includes people that have to express themselves in English professionally from time to time; They usually write their script in German, have me translate it, and then get an hour or two of coaching for their presentation.
---
Hell, I remember applying for my English major at uni; They held a fairly base-line test to ensure that people understood English enough to at least start studying it, and *half of the applicants* in my semester failed.
---
And as you say: A lot of people simply do not want the stress of having to deal with people in a non-native language in their free time; I'm an exception this. I played on German servers with the English client, I played on English servers, I *personally* don't care either way. Hell, I have trouble remembering some German words on occasion nowadays.
---
I also played on servers with large populations of other nationalities, and this made those servers much harder to navigate: Whatever group you belong to, you will have a harder time finding groups and players for anything. Many don't understand you, some ignore you, it's like having language-based sharding in a way.
---
So, as much as I saw this coming: This may be a flaw in EU realms at a core level that breaks their necks.
---
You cannot speak any languages aside from the realms language (not couting whispers, party with friends or guild chat) or you will be breaching the TOS indeed
---
they can call them schnitzelreich for all i care, just make them happen.
---
Scandinavians suck, I don't want to play on a server with others from my country. They're the loudest, most arrogant, while simultaneously most stupid players you'll ever meet, and they are even worse when they get together in groups. Trust me, we nees the Brits and so on.
---
MVP. What’s that? Some kind of official statement or just an opinion from a guy who is known for always agreeing with Blizzard’s stance?
---
And you think that alone is gonna stop people from doing it?
---
Even with ban waves, people will still do it.
---
Invite Link Invalid
---
People who prefer not to speak english because it is not their native/first language are the same as english speakers who prefer to speak english over other languages they know, its more comfortable, they know they will get across exactly what they mean, and usually they can communicate quicker.
---
I can speak french, but whenever possible I prefer to speak english because I have a better grasp on the language.
---
Others can speak english but whenever possible prefer to speak french/german/russian/spanish/etc because they have a better grasp on the language.
---
Some can speak multiple languages and enjoy doing so. Congratulations! They get to have many more and better experiences because they will be able to interact with more people, cultures, etc. Doesnt make the wants of those who dont any lesser.
---
Gurubashi Arena chest it should only spawn once every 3 Hours so you should get a maximum of 8 per day if you would get all
---
The thing is the Gurubashi Arena where the chest spawns is a Free for All pvp zone so even Horde can kill Horde unles in a group.
---
Layering not only fucks the pvp up because People will just disappear mid combat because a mate invites them to another layer but also as you can see in this picture People will be able to swap layers so aggresively so they can get that ultra rare chest 7 Times in one spawn.
---
I mean, I was being pretty modest with the 30k launch pop guess. You don't think any regular servers could hit a population that high? If any did, wont they have the problem I just described?
---
So you think it's condition 3 that is the lie, queue times are inevitable and layering will be removed regardless of their existence. I actually agree with you and I think that's the case as well, layering is not meant to solve condition 3.
---
So don't you think people should stop spouting that lie?
---
I know this will get downvoted but anyway... i dont find the vanilla dungeon experience better than retail one. Pulling slowly and CCing mobs here and there is fun, pretty cool if you can cooperate. The main reason i dont find it fun is the aggro. It feels so frustrating to be dying as a healer simply becouse one healing touch cast created so much threat. In my run i had mobs on me very often and it wasnt even tanks fault and i knew it. It was just a bad balancing issue really. A tank at that level cannot keep more than 2 mobs properly. The saddest thing of all was that i couldnt even help myself by rooting the mob, becouse we were INSIDE. I think the retail dungeons are a bit too fast paced but vanilla experience wasnt even remotely  cool if i was pugging the dungeon. The only thing i liked about it is being there with friends.
---
Dude there are a ton. The guy who posted that avoidstreamers website got flamed in the thread for it
---
Did i said this ?
---
This is still one important thing and layering will screw the whole speed runner community that were waiting to compete for the lvl 60. Will also screw with the MC and Onyxia first kill because levelling is an important part of the process.
---
Easy, English needs to be enforced in all public channels. Otherwise international servers dont make sense anyway.
---
It wont be "allowed" but it also wont be easy to stop or contain.
---
Its going to exist.
---
then you make your own channels for germans like it happens with the chinese on ND private server and you now have a dead official chat and a bustling un official chat.
---
Ich werde Schafsstern!
---
So do you think that people should stop saying "layering means no queue times"?
---
I hate they are blocking whole threads instead of moderating the controversial comments. This is reducing a lot of visibility of the issue.
---
The point of international server is that it doesn't take 200ms for you to ping the server, so you can play without lag. As much as I would love to play with french speaking people (I'm a french canadian), well I would hate to play on a server with 200ms and honestly I don't plan on playing during the night.  It may be more practical in EU, but won't change anything for NA.
---
Because this is the stress test areana chest. Now that is insane if he got all at once switching between layers to grab them uncontested. That is a lot of gold in his bags for really doing nothing of risk because of layering. Wow is about risk and there is none when you can switch in and out of layers.
---
\&gt; The opportunity to meet new people outside your country , and make long lasting friends  
---
I'll take one friend in my city over 100 spread across Europe. 
---
\&gt; As for the reasons, I already mentioned it above.  
---
You also said that you never played on a finnish realm, you literally have no way of actually comparing it. And honestly, as someone who has played on all kinds of servers, no English lesson is worth as much as having a bunch of guild mates randomly live in your city and most cities you're likely to visit.
---
Yeah, I continued reading the thread and dug into it, he's referencing the blue post from yesterday which had all the realm news. It says:
---
"For Classic, we’re planning on not splitting up realms by language. This has its advantages and disadvantages, but overall, we think that it’s the best starting point for WoW Classic."
---
In hindsight, I realize I've read this before, but I apparently didn't parse the information properly, and it seems like a few people missed it, so I guess I'll keep the post up, just in case.
---
Will the chest be in the game in Phase 1? I know the fishing tournament won't be
---
I don't remember... who's head is it on the spike?
---
Yeah, but what makes you think that the people who don't keep up to date with classic news think this is a good idea? Not everyone interested in playing classic is on the official forums or reddit every day.
---
It will be worse for the majority of people that check classic out later because they will not be aware of what servers are "unofficial french/spanish/german" etc, making their experience worse. It's a massive mistake if they don't do language specific servers.
---
"The vocal minority" is what has gotten us this far in the first place, don't forget. Blizzard gets things right and gets things wrong - this is obviously wrong. They're scared of having to do server mergers down the line, but if people don't get attached to their community, or feel like they're out of place, they'll quit anyway.
---
&gt; It takes a special kind of fucked up gaming company to not believe in the success of their own game. It just seems to me they expect Classic to peak for a month and then die down except for a few hard core players. 
---
And you don't think that's going to happen?
---
Nice voice
---
He looks like a puppet
---
Sheeping a tagged mob won't work. So same faction kill denial will not be available. And hopefully we got more players as on private so if two alliance raids show up to clear the horde part out it will be hard to mount a sufficient response. As the "business model" is only valid if you have almost total control of the ressource it won't be viable or at least a lot less rewarding.
---
Still it will be more players needing the ressources. So prices are hard to estimate. Could be that the leather will go for the mafia price without the mafia simply because of supply and demand.
---
I've had plenty of fun playing with members of various national communities, both in WoW and EVE Online.
---
However I also played Classic WoW on a server which was an unofficial spanish server (Agamaggan)
---
Many (not all) of the Spanish players I encountered on there had no desire to communicate with non-spanish speakers. They played the game to themselves and consequently English, Swedish, Hungarians and other nationals did the same. Guilds were very nationalistic with &lt;The British Brotherhood&gt; &lt;Hungarian Honoured&gt; &lt;Swedish Valhalla Elite&gt; and others popping up.
---
This fractured the communities that could speak English and caused a population problem for several Guilds.
---
Eventually Blizzard opened dedicated Spanish realms and offered free character migrations. The server went from Medium pop to Low pop and **never** recovered, with most Guilds having migrated by the end of TBC.
---
The problem with international servers is that not everyone can speak other languages, and not everyone wants to. International Servers forces people to interact with other nations when they may not be able to/want to and it leads to a great deal of resentment within a portion of the community.
---
If you have National servers, people are of course welcome to play on non-native servers if they like. But that's the thing - it's a choice.
---
If you take away the choice and agency, it creates artificial divides despite appearing as more inclusive.
---
No, we haven’t been lied to. You’re overestimating player surges and not accounting for the fact that a lot of people will drop off pretty quick.
---
I don't defend layering. I choose to accept it. I am happy to play WoW Classic. I can't wait. Will it be perfect? No. Will I have a blast as long as I can? Yes.
---
It seems like it's what Blizzard has decided they will do. I am not developing the game. People have expressed their concerns. There is only one thing left to do ... either play or don't play. And if enough people are not playing because something as stupid as layering for a few months or even a year, then ... we won't need layering! ;)
---
I just said it's against the ToS, not that people will stop doing it.
---
Learn to read, dipshit.
---
The hate is coming from "layer hopping" which is possible for sure.
---
For example if the chest inside Gurubashi Arena is up and you loot in in your "Phase". A different Person from another "Phase" could invite you into a Group - and you could have the chest spawn in front of you again if it hasn't been looted on that "Phase".
---
People are able to abuse it. And I'm not sure if that is against the ToS. I think if it was we would not have any Problems. Just make intentionally abusing it a bannable offense :)
---
I don't get the hate either tbh.... I think it is a great solution to the bubble that is going to Pop sometimes into Classic.
---
Hey chat, you guys are cute AYAYA
---
Lok Tar Ogar warrior, need help with this human?
---
easily circumvented by not being in a guild, just on friends list.
---
OG player: “The beauty of vanilla is that nobody knew what they were doing, you had to rely on other people, leveling was hard so it felt rewarding and felt like a journey. The game nowadays holds your hand through the whole leveling process.”
---
Also OG player: “What’s the most efficient leveling path to take? Of course I’m gonna min max, human warrior or undead warlock all day.  If you play a Druid, shaman or paladin and don’t heal you’re literally worthless. You’re a night elf or a troll? Enjoy not getting into a raid ever. I’m gonna take mining and herbalism while I level, then once I hit 60 and the market normalizes sell all my herbs and power level engineering for PvP.”
---
You only need to go to certain locations for alchemy when crafting flasks. Everything else can be crafted anywhere
---
Nobody likes to read subtitles. People prefer dubs. And in practically every TV show and movie there are 1 or 2 actors which I just can't understand.
---
I consider myself fluent in English but I'd still like a French server.  
---
Even if I was rolling on a UK server, I would be pissed to encounter kids or people with broken English that would not be able to talk with me.   
---
As for the bias/flaw of the poll, you're right. But I cannot do much more about it. Except translate it and share it on other platforms.
---
As a belgian i can say we would never make racist jokes about the dutchies.
---
That's not a great scenario either because 60 pct of Europe's player base plays on non English speaking realms...
---
Oh okay, thank you.
---
There is no way to pay to get into the beta. If you paid 15 bucks for a 2 day stress test that is on you.
---
This has more to do with the way layering works than streamers. If streamers didn't exist and there was a community/server event hosted by a top guild on the server, instead of a streamer, you'd still have all the people in chat begging for invites. People getting upset because players want to get involved with what a huge portion of the server population is doing is nothing new, but with the layering system you end up with this situation where people need invites to get onto the same layer as the event.
---
This is a good thing because it will show the devs how dumb of an idea layering is.
---
I am under the assumption people not in the beta give 0 fks about layering. Most of the people (myself included) that are in the beta don't like it as it is implemented right now.
---
Bruh, nobody called you bruh before? You need a hug bruh?
---
&gt;Lagging and disconnects &gt; layering/sharding.
---
You'd rather have an interrupted, shitty, annoying service, than a streamlined one because ... why exactly?
---
&gt;Doesn't mean someone hurt me, were you abused?
---
Thankfully not. I was just wondering why someone would want to force such an archaic system on other people and the only reason that came up is that someone hurt you so you wish bad for others.
---
You can learn English while also keeping your own language. I mostly use English while playing games but hardly use it all at work. I even know basic French, which let's me understand basic Spanish.
---
Also if the French wanted an edge over the English they would have learned their language, since many Brits only know English.
---
I edited in the "(Regarding the EU)" part, maybe it was too late, sorry for that. 
---
I'm not disagreeing, of course English is the most spoken language world wide but if they do an EU release it'd be wrong to ignore so many French and German speaking people. (I do not know how active WoW is in Spain or Italy). 
---
This is no competition, having at least these 3 languages available for EU would also dampen the community split for everyone, since they're simply big in numbers. It'd be overall better as a whole.
---
Question was allowed, not prevented.
---
There are about forty to sixty thousand native-level Irish speakers. For a few it is their first language. It is true they all speak English; the last monolingual Irish speaker died in the 1970s.
---
Learn English? The general feeling of West Europeans being "superior" and not wanting to talk English is way out of hand already.
---
(It's my 3rd language, I had to learn it.)
---
And those 12 millions were CONCURRENT active players.
---
Over 100 million played WoW between 2005 and 2013, and god knows how many tens of millions more after 2013.
---
To expect less than 3-4 million returning players is STUPID.
---
To expect less than 1 million is INSANE.
---
Blizzard is out of touch with reality.
---
Now this is a rant I can get behind.  Paywalling the Beta AND making it a random chance invite(unless you're a streamer) was ridiculous.
---
I would have rather they either went random chance or commit to X number of subs for guaranteed access(didn't they do this with MoP?)
---
Afaik vanilla didn't have national servers, when were they added and how did they operate the change ? It could be an option should Classic prove to be successful enough to keep dozens of thousand players per language
---
I always used to used a different one than bagnon that people mostly used, at least in tbc and wotlk.  I forget the name, but it let me set up filters and tag items and it would break up my inventory into sections as if they were multiple bags like normal.  Basically I'd have a bag for ore, a bag for my pots, a bag for greys, a bag for offspec gear, etc. It was the best. 
---
I've been using regular bagnon on vanilla pserver while goofing around at low level and it's pretty awful.
---
No each mage are on the same layer, but for layer hopping you just have to setup alt on multiple layers that will invite you to make you switch layer.
---
And its easy to verify your alts aren't on the same layer, you just have to make them go at the same place (just make them stay at the starting zone when you create them, don't even have to move) and look for your other alts. If you don't see any other of your alt then the alt you just created is on a whole new layer.
---
Oh look, another guy that doesn't know they're completely disabling layering a few weeks in... LOL
---
Must-have addons for Mages?
---
Hahaha I knew this answer was coming! 
---
I added translation and rephrased the question to be "Do you speak English well enough to play WoW in English?".  
---
I hope people get the general idea though.
---
U are not alone my friend! I am 42 and am as excited for August 27th as I was back in 2005 when I made my first toon. There is nothing to be ashamed of!
---
... I mean, if you're french canadian, you have to know english anyways, right? So that wouldn't be an issue, neither would a french speaking or at least multilingual server on NA. What's the problem?
---
This is not a good solution at all. These servers would have a horrible population, and starting on them would be the same experience as starting on a layered solution.
---
Also, this has been proposed about 10 times in the last 2 days. Gets old reading it over and over again
---
We Americans had to play on French timezone private servers for the past 4+ years. Every day we came home from work it was pitch black in game.
---
And by the way, everyone spoke English, those who didn't just formed their own Swedish or Russian guilds etc. I've read stories of people who practiced their English through WoW.
---
Yeah sorry no sympathy from me.
---
&gt;  so for simplicity let's say 70k european subs
---
Keep in mind, each region gets 3 realms(PvE/PvP/RP), so  now we have 12 realms.
---
I will never understand this generation's obsession over streamers.
---
Will ignite work just as it did in raids during vanilla? I.e. first mage that crits takes credit and therefore threat from all other mage's ignites until the debuff runs out. 
---
Generally I'm #nochanges but this was an awkward bug that would get you killed/wiped through no fault of your own on a pretty regular basis if I recall.
---
Can't kill my own faction. :(
---
Firstly... jeeesus christ man, I came here to read comments not your thesis submission. I guess it's time to go paragraph for paragraph.
---
And if I was so unlucky to find myself in an hour plus queue (besides not rolling on high pop in the first place), I'd do what I did originally in '05 eg. go play my alt on a low pop realm... or I could exercise a small amount of patience and do some housework in the meantime. ("Because I am pretty damn sure, you'd be one of the first to complain about it" please keep in mind you don't know a thing about me)
---
You try accuse me of holding a private server mindset, yet you're the one talking about "your rush to 60 with your route like you planned to". People like to enjoy the game in a multitude of ways.
---
"It is not like back then where the game would launch in EU with 50-100 servers and no matter choosing one, starting zones weren't as flooded as they will be now"
---
You do realise that with the initial wave of the original release in '04 large portions on the market sold out of copies of the game. Not only that but the servers available at launch were so crowded that they released ~40 more servers within a few days of launching.
---
You highlight another thing that bothers me about the talk of layering on this sub. You start off by saying it will ease congestion in starting zones and that it would only be in effect for a few weeks, then go on to give all these endgame examples. It's obvious to see EVEN YOU don't believe it's going to be implemented for the initial release wave only. Sharding/Layering kills server community and cohesion, and all those "small" concessions add up.
---
you know blizz gonna profit on transfers
---
This is a really great point that I hadn't even considered. I'm from Denmark, so obviously I did not expect a native language server, and I have never experienced getting friends I would meet up with that way - but damn it would be cool. 
---
I believe at least a single french, German, and Spanish server would have been great. Many of the smaller countries are used to not having content in their language, and maybe because of that are used to communicating in English, and with people from other countries. So we don't need tons of different language servers, just for the biggest languages which happen to also cover some of the countries where English levels are generally not as high. 
---
I would actually prefer to play on a mixed European server even if I had an option to play on a Danish server, but that doesn't mean every other European feels the same way. 
---
I hope blizzard looks at the community feedback this time, as they have so many other times for classic.
---
Layering is simply sharding at a macro level.  Instead of it being limited to a small area you can't see, and when you cross that invisible boundary the mob or herb or mining node vanishes before your eyes, you have to log out or join a group whose leader is on another layer.
---
I suspect this is because in classic, they didn't have phasing tech.  You know how in BfA there's no flight master until you do the quest to clear the tower?  Same idea, except in classic, there's no quests that do that, so they have the freedom to define the entire continent as one big "phase", and programmatically assign people to phases at login or some such.
---
Do you have a source on your ToS claim? I don’t believe that is true.
---
I haven't payed for anything this year. 
---
Yes, it's not even guaranteed you'll get beta if you pay the monthly sub. That only makes it worse, as BfA has nothing to offer for the money you pay. There are a lot of people who subbed again, just to have a chance to beta test. Which is imho the worst part.
---
I'm French, I don't go in foreign countries and expect them to know my language. If you do you're just arrogant.
---
I always learn at least the 20 most common words so I can get by (yes, no, thank you, please, left, right etc).
---
Actually I went in vacation in Moldova a couple of years before the release of Vanilla. There I spoke English (with an American tourist), French (once : I met another Frenchman), broken Romanian and broken Russian that I just learn in the country.
---
I have fond memories of trying to communicate with the security guard of my apartment, with the help of a bottle of vodka, a Russian dictionary and a lot of patience.
---
Don't be the arrogant colon tourist.
---
Exactly. Would people be this mad if a top guild on a server organized a server event via a forum post? No streamer involved? 
---
This screenshot has more to do with the layering system than streamer culture. If layering wasn't implemented they wouldn't need to cry out for invites to get to the same layer as the event.
---
I’m starting to feel the same way. It feels like Blizzard is half adding as much as possible, so it makes me feel like there’s no point.
---
I did account for it. 66% drop off after 3 weeks, 90% by the end of phase 1. Is that not reasonable to you? I know I don't have hard data to know for sure, but I thought that was a fair guess.
---
But you're wrong about the resurgances, the weekend following each phase release will be jam packed.
---
fortunately us Brits are well known for working well with our continental neighbours.....
---
As far as I know all european realms are currently hosted in either Frankfurt, Paris or Amsterdam. 
---
This isn't about ping at all, the distance in europe is just to small for the ping to really matter. The ping problem is something which matters for like NA East Coast &amp; West Coast not for Europe.
---
They just want to know that people testing the game are actually willing to pay for their product. Its completely reasonable and not greedy. You are greedy for saying you want to play a paid game for free.
---
3000 concurrent players is enough to keep a server well populated. I'm playing on a 3-5k private server and it's working just fine.
---
I recommend just staying off the sub as it can be very negative. Think many people agree that even with whatever issues there are, playing the game (whether it's beta or private server) is insanely fun and nostalgic.
---
Yeah Swedish people can be quite toxic. Subtly toxic.
---
Apologies on their behalf.
---
then people will argue about whose server that is.
---
Exactly. Its just annoying have to translate every guide, spells, item and skills first before you see their counterpart in your client.
---
Why do you phrase everything as "Gotcha" questions or statements?
---
My position is people should stop freaking out over layering all together because it's not going to matter 6mo-1yr down the road once we are solidly out of P1.
---
Hahaha get fucked. I hope it ruins your experience if you spergs keep being so whiney on here about insignificant shit.
---
They did it with the Classic Demo - where you had to buy a Blizzcon ticket to Play it. Which was gated behind a 55$ Paywall xD
---
It isn't about the exact numbers but the fact that the majority of children/teens will lie about their age online to be able to enjoy content. Seeing as Asmongold's channel is restricted to the age of 18 and above, it is fair to assume that a large part of those claiming to be 18+ actually aren't. This means that your google statistics video is as trustworthy as a North Korean news channel.
---
Ich kann Deutsch sprechen.
---
Didn't see people bitching then though ironically
---
So the scenario is one mage logs out, invites the other 4 to this new layer, the other 4 AOE farm, next one logs out, reforms the group, AOE farm, repeat.  Remember, you can't earn XP in a raid group.
---
Please explain further, that doesn't make alot of sense to me.  If I make an alt, then log into that alt, how am I going to look for my other alts?
---
Where are good spots to aoe grind starting around lvl 22 on horde
---
Because you are a smaller country. Germany and France have large enough population to occupy the better part of a server. Why would they then speak english there?
---
Starting to get that impression too.
---
I'm talking about the political union, not the continent
---
Can we please just for a moment focus on the GAME that's at stake here, not the streamer who's playing it? 
---
Can't you see wtf is going on here, and this is anything but the Vanilla game everyone's been asking for for years? 
---
Do you REALLY want the same people who fought for this game to receive THIS when they log into Classic on Day 1, and then weeks or months in!? 
---
Please, all i ask is that you think of the chi.. the amazing community who made this happen in the first place!
---
#NOCHANGES !
---
Embrace the fact that Frenchies are rude and French Canadians
---
Yes it is.
---
By you asking why they can't duplicate world bosses, yes. You're a negative influence on what classic is.
---
Not sure if serious... Of course it was a setup, he did it intentionally (And easily- just have a random on the same continent invite you) to avoid 2+ full raid groups that were corpse camping him.  The whole point of the clip was to show that you can "setup" a layer hop whenever you're being inconvenienced
---
Classic wow is not for sale, you just need to pay the sub
---
I'm feeling it too.  It seems like the bean counters are running the show and that's never a good thing.
---
Be that as it may. As I said, I haven't played BfA since launch. 
---
This doesn't really compensate the fact, that people are generally disinterested in BfA and want to play Classic instead.
---
Although I think there are probably going to be significantly fewer twelve year olds playing, who are writing in their native language because they haven't actually learned english yet. (This was a some of my friends back in vanilla)
---
The problem may still exist, but I imagine it will be lestened by the playerbase average age being higher than it was back then.
---
Well from the research I did before the dungeon it seems that it very may well be your tanks fault. The paladin tank I was with who was 2 levels under me was very squishy in comparison so I ended up tanking it as a feral druid. Aggro in our dungeon (even when we had 5 or 6 on us) didn't feel that bad. Basicly what I was told as a tank, is you must be the same level as the mobs atleast so that you don't have threat issues / missing hits that often. the main healer paladin was level 23 and I don't think he ever pulled aggro off of me. GRANTED I have very little experience and this is my first ever classic dungeon, I'm just in a lot of discords and read a lot of forum posts on the matter because I was really nervous before tanking my first dungeon, I don't want to let the group down. (I'm spec'd full feral tank). I'm not gonna down vote you for your opinion man, hope you get a better experience next time you play classic if you do at all.
---
People who don't use reddit or read the wow forums can accidently roll on one of those servers and be left out. Literally what happened on Spinebreaker and Stormreaver in vanilla.
---
Kids also don't speak English
---
Only if changes make Classic even *MORE* RPG-y ... ;)
---
Or just remove layering
---
Your behaviour is childish, try to improve it a lil bit more.
---
Still better than chinese gold sellers
---
You guys really overthink Everything. Is your life that boring?
---
&gt;How many people will get banned for calling an engllishman roast beef or a frenchman a cheese eating surrender monkey? How strict is blizzard's language policy these days, because they're about to put it to the test..
---
I used to be the biggest shitposter on the trade chat calling people the N word and so on. Never got banned, no one cared
---
fucking hell that 2nd spreadsheet is amazing.
---
The betas already halfway done. I said that in another thread, and you replied: “OMG THE SKY IS FALLING! 🤪 I bet all of you are TOTALLY gonna quit Classic out of protest, right?”
---
So first, you said it was only beta, so its just broken and it will be fixed, and we’re crazy for even worrying that it won’t get fixed. Then, you’re saying, wow, even if it doesn’t get fixed, what are you gonna do, not play?
---
Just seems kind of contradictory to me.
---
&gt;when NA themselves can only speak one is quite something
---
Please don't lump Canada in with Americans.
---
What about the STV chest?
---
There is a big difference between someone assuming they will get in by paying and Blizzard pushing that idea. They never told anyone to sub to get in.
---
Are we really going to go through with this again ? :p
---
I'm not sure about you, but I think I've had enough demon plot-twists that leads to spaceship invasions and planet warping/ time travel to last a lifetime tbh.
---
Too much time on peoples' hands to think negatively unfortunately. I keep an eye on the sub most of the day at work, but just ignore the super negative posts. People are anxious to play and want it to be perfect, so they see everything as much worse than it will be. Layering specifically will be kinda annoying, but if it works even semi-properly the world will still feel lively imo
---
Then August is coming,  no need to feel entitled to beta
---
Saving
---
awesome spreadsheets!
---
Tell him in the spirit of pride month to roll alliance
---
I mean, you don't necessarily need one of each. I'm sure a lot of people rather pick the wrong servertype over the wrong language. RP also works within guilds on that server, and outside the guild you can just behave like normal. Not perfect, but it works.
---
Let's be honest the real fear here is that you're gonna be stuck on a server where all the germans went to - and you have no clue which server is gonna be which until its too late to change.
---
The only thing that has even the slightest (and let me emphasize slightest) thing of happening again is queue times. There will never be another experience even closely relatable to launch, and if you think there will be you are mistaken. Starting zones will never be that packed again.
---
Regarding queue times, if it happens I guarantee it’s not going to be substantial. 
---
Your estimations are just wrong, they know what they are doing,
---
Swedish here as well. The reason is that the Scandinavian countries and as such, languages, are so small compared to say German or French that it is much more necessary for us to learn English.
---
Also, back in vanilla, Shattered Hand was designated the unofficial Swedish server and had toooons of Swedes on it. Even now in retail it's very common with Scandinavian only guilds on basically all servers I've ever played on.
---
I've never liked the split of servers into languages though. I've always enjoyed meeting people from different cultures while playing online games. For example, there was this Italian guy I met in WC3 and we just loved to hang out in our clan chat and talk shit. I remember being bummed out when WoW had separate servers for Germany, France, etc. since it made it so much more rare to meet people from those countries.
---
Wool cloth? I think he's farming the arena grand master
---
Thats just it though. Everyone claims they want to avoid the streamers, but of the two servers, the one with the streamers in the beta is the one with the most people.
---
You assume its just a PvP versus PvE thing, but then here, both stress test servers are PvP, and the same thing happens.
---
**People clearly WANT to play** with streamers despite claiming otherwise. I read hate for them all day, but reality doesn't lie. People flock to them HARD.
---
How else are they going to grandstand against the oh-so dangerous ""bigotry""?
---
Yeah but if 80% of people are German then all you can do as a minority English speaking playerbase is level and do dungeons.
---
Same with Stormreaver. Most of the server was Finnish speakers and if anyone spoke English in lets say trade chat people just bullied them out or started whispering them to leave the server etc.
---
There's nothing in the ToS that says you can't collude with the other faction. There used to be, but it was removed  in 2012. The Devilsaur Mafia problem can be fixed in-game by players - group up and fight back.
---
What do you mean tourists? You have to manually tick the option to apply for Classic beta. 
---
And why are we talking about bfa? It doesn't matter at all in this topic.
---
As of 2010, 70% of wow customers quit before reaching level 10
---
It would be by zone. So, if you are in a 30+ zone like STV, you would both see each other without having to group with them. Whereas if you were both in Duskwood, you would have to group to join their layer or shard .
---
Wenn wir keinen Server bekommen, dann nehmen wir uns einfach einen! Zack!
---
To save money because its cheaper to shard than it is to properly manage servers.
---
They've chosen a technique that will very likely have drastic effects on the player experience and damage immersion. You can see many of the known consequences of this system in beta videos. That is why people are upset. I wish people were more upset about the problems that haven't cropped up yet that we don't know about. 
---
It's just an awful, awful way to do this. Especially when there is an alternative:
---
The player-centric way to do this is Clusters (21,000 active players) consisting of various (3,000 active) Segments which all share a name pool for easy future merges. Dragontooth 1, Dragontooth 2, Dragontooth 3, Dragontooth 4, Dragontooth 5, Dragontooth 6, Dragontooth 7.
---
You pick which segment you want to sign up for, just as though it were a server. And effectively *is* a server because the population never changes on your cluster. Nobody comes in, nobody leaves, unless they started a new toon or quit. 
---
Any two Segments see population drops can be merged together. Players on each segment log in every day to the same player base. Strangers become acquaintances become friends, as it was in Vanilla and TBC. The downside will be the painful merge (or a few merges) to compensate for the expected population decline BUT, if population does not decline, it has the advantage over layering that it allows for Segments never needing a merge.
---
Layering a megaserver is similar to sharding when the person you quested with yesterday is logged into a different layer today. Mobs, nodes, and people disappear upon group invite. People exploit it and you wonder if you should learn the exploit or just accept that the economy is getting more scuffed every minute. We've seen how exploitable it is in myriad videos. If the expected population decline doesn't happen on some servers then Layering will be around forever or they'll have to find a way of separating the population. Layering is rife with downsides and has only one advantage over Clusters, avoiding merges.
---
Yeah honestly our views on the subject differ so much that it's probably best to call it here. I guess we'll find out eventually what will happen.
---
&gt;The fact that I know that there are a lot of people who are not as proficient or comfortable with the language is what makes me concerned.
---
You misunderstand. I don't mean those people not being able to speak in a language other than their mothertongue. I mean other people on the server being conversational in the mothertongue of the player with limited language skills.
---
I'm Finnish, and I can at least converse in English, Swedish and French. I have a beginner's understanding of German as well. If I come across a player who doesn't speak English but does speak German, I can at least say "Enchuligung, aber ich spreche nicht deutch. Was möchten sie?" and TRY to make an effort to communicate with them.
---
Most Europeans have taken at least a year of highschool B-level language classes in another European language, so even if we cannot use English to communicate, chances are that we can still find a way to make things work.
---
Sure, something like going over boss mechanics might not be possible with 7th grade language skills, but the social aspects are absolutely possible to have even without language specific servers.
---
&gt;So, if a server with a big community of a certain language gets the possibility to migrate to a new server, won't it be possible that this kills the old server?
---
Only if the server was an "unofficial" language server in the first place. Servers with 2k concurrent (so probably like 10-15k total) players are still healthy enough to have a community. If the number of servers is limited and servers are layered at the start to prevent the zerg and gauge interest, then even if thousands of people migrate the server will be just fine. Very few retail vanilla servers ever completely died in their lifespan, and those had much fewer players per server than we anticipate for classic.
---
&gt;Either way, whether it is migrating or merging ... both are not ideal, the question is: what is worse?
---
Merging is absolutely worse.
---
It's even more pronounced if servers are at different phases of content. Merging will rob a new server of many progression phases, such as the limited number of end-game dungeon keys (so keys are desirable and finding groups for LBRS will be feasible), AQ war-effort and crafting recipe availability. Merging will also put AH economy into a turmoil, because servers generally establish themselves differently from each other.
---
Migrating is only a problem if the servers are at different progression phases, because it will allow certain items that shouldn't exist yet into the server. This can affect raiding competition or world PvP. BGs will be in battlegroups, so I don't expect migration to hurt PvP overly much.
---
Migrating will have the same problems as merging, but only for the migrating player instead of the entire server. Merging is also something that is FORCED on the entirety of the old server, even if they would prefer not to migrate but to keep playing on their old server for whatever reason.
---
No, which is why layering is sticking around for months.
---
So if we know the layer sizes and how many there might be as max, we know the faction balance then we can calculate how many layers.  
---
Why would i need a degree in mathematics to do this simple calculation?  
---
No how could i add tangible facts when we dont have them?  
---
I mean if streamers can do it i have a hard time imagining others not being able to do it, or are you saying its impossible to abuse layers?
---
Just learn English like everyone else. 
---
/solved.
---
Freedom boi here with his hot take on geo politics. 
---
If all the moldy baggetts, spagehhttio's, and sour krauts don't like it, just remember that its better than playing with the factory workers. You cant even read their characters, much harder to understand.
---
just kidding, this cheese burger sasquatch loves you all.
---
Don't know what lie you are talking about but yes most serves after a month won't be over populated. Unless blizzard only open 5 servers.
---
I know you're joking but fwiw, a tank is a "tank" in French.
---
If you say "réservoir" it's a container, it doesn't mean the war machine ("char" or "tank") or the guy that takes hits for you ("tank").
---
This was your free French lesson for the day. Tomorrow we learn about the "baguette" ! :D

Not going to look through it for you, you have fun, Ive seen many examples over the years, this is not a new or unheard of thing in anyway. Oh its even on their guidlines lol
---
&gt;  .01% of people   
---
&gt; These are not imaginary numbers, contacting support takes u less than 30 minutes.   
---
Follow your own advice lol? 
---
It is almost like you can't imagine this happening during off hours for blizzard or any other personal situation for those effected... 
---
&gt;Source: I got hacked and after 2 days got all my shit back. 
---
Lol... personal experience is not a source, as well as a totally irrelevant example. I could say I have 5 wings made of steel that I use to slap around my alien friends, and that would be as useful to this discussion.
---
Several months, I’m hoping to get 60
---
Before the end of the year..really rack up levels over the holidays when works slow
---
The drums of war thunder once again
---
If you can't speak English in 2019 what are you actually doing with your life
---
They did. Then they said it would be limited to phase 1. So I gave a range. A few weeks up to a few months at most.
---
even more cool is meeting people in your own country and language and meeting up at lan events or gaming expos!
---
Then layering and abuse it is i guess? :D
---
Also ich find's lustig lol
---
It's funny, a ton of U.S. players resubbed just to take part in the 2 day stress test this week, myself included. I have no plans on playing retail with my sub time,  so I quite literally spent 15$ to play for 10ish hours and experience the stress test. I know I'm not the only one that did as well. There were many of us!
---
Isn’t there a change to Polymorph, so it can’t be cast on a tagged mob? That would help prevent the same-faction griefing.
---
The guy always irritated me, but what made me really avoid any of his vids was when he advocated for rolling on, and rolled on a lavish ring over a priest and a mage as a warrior.
---
As in, check for beta access,  play for 2 months,  say fuck it and leave without helping find bugs in any way. 
---
And it is relevant when OP specifically mentioned it as a reason for this begging "greedy"
---
How will it screw with it? If anything the exploit helps it.
---
Is blizzard rewarding people who hit 60 first? If not then it's not their concern.
---
Their only concern is to get anyone who wants to play on day 1 - in and able to play.
---
I mean they're investing significant resources developing layering technology that they supposedly want to remove ASAP too
---
Yeah. I think they're basically well-meaning when it comes down to it, but it often feels like there's a lot of talk in the American zeitgeist about being as culturally inclusive as possible, yet when it comes down to it, cultures are only included if they fit the criteria. That's a broader point than reddit mods locking threads, but it's evident that the TOS is American if it can't tolerate European stereotypes. We're so soaked in that stuff here that no one's offended.
---
&gt;people shitposting on an online gaming chat
---
Hey guys, congratulations on finally getting internet after all these years. Hope you have fun! &gt;!and dont watch too much porn!&lt;
---
it's ridiculous to think that retail WoW is big enough to have 70+ German servers but Classic won't be big enough for one or two.
---
Now you are pulling numbers out of your ass and anyway Classic server structure will be very different from retail.
---
I think the said phase 1 then eventually specifically said a few weeks.
---
It’s been done in under 4 days played. Why would it take 10.
---
And that doesn't matter, if it's doable - then do it.
---
Blizzard wants 1 thing - to let everyone who wants to play on day 1 be able to.
---
Don’t play on a PvP server then.  For all the people talking about PvP servers being the only real experience, you sure like to complain about PvP scenarios.
---
But sure here you go joking about french eh ? :)
---
(french here, so it's just fairplay for you to do so)
---
I've heard Cross-realm BG being used to refer to BattleGround and BattleGroup. If there aren't many servers it's a moot point I guess.
---
Fake news. There are no bugs in my code!
---
Germans had over 60 server at Wow peak in 2008-2010
---
It's the difference of where to apply the slit; Servers "naturally" split the community into server communities already. If you put up signs for players to sort themselves into a community they like, that's good for the player, because you give him a way of interacting with people that largely share his PoV. Hence why there are PvE realms, PvP realms, and RP realms.
---
The same is very much true of language, because not speaking a language is a barrier in itself. So it would be vastly better to sort those languages into servers (again, they're already splitting the community on a per-server basis, so you're splitting at the same "server" level) than to have server communities sub-split by their respective languages - especially since any non-official assignment of languages per servers won't be known to a large part of WoW's populace. Better to have an indication that *everyone* can see to find out where you can communicate best with the whole server instead of just a subset of it.

You can't compare ban waves between private servers and Blizzard.
---
Being banned in a server where the account and the month sub are free is not that bad.
---
Way less people will risk their accounts (and 15 usd/month) getting banned in classic because of some gold
---
which could be prevented if you plan for it from the beginning.
---
The thing is. We were doing deadmines all levels 20+/- lets say 20-21. Maybe that wasnt enough. But still it didnt feel fun to be a healer, especially since you just autoattack and cast only healing touch becouse its the most mana efficient spell from what i've experienced. And resources are very limited so i didnt really bother doing dmg unless i could cat form and then... i had aggro again. Well i know we werent experienced in this. We're good retail dungeon players so we're generally good at the game tho. So im assuming he knew what he was doing pretty much becouse he did the research.
---
So as far as I understand there will still be a cap of Players allowed on one Server.
---
You know - Blizzard has to have a estimated number of People stopping to Play Classic after a few weeks. 
---
Let's say they cap it at 18k - that would be 6 layers. 
---
First two conditions met - third on not met. 
---
Free Server Transfers because apparently the estimate wasn't true for that Server because the streamer Servers may have a different Kind of Player following them who actually stays a Little longer. 
---
People don't want to move away from that Server. 
---
Well too bad - own fault for choosing a streamer Server tbh xD
---
The rest of Servers will be totally fine. You can't just take the one exception to the rest and ask - what about this?
---
There will always be People left behind in certain decisions - sometimes you have to take the route of least damage.
---
Because for almost all other Servers it will work as intendet. Can't do much about the streamers that could literally go everywhere and be followed by thousands. 
---
Streamers can not be counted into things like that except for streamer Servers. 
---
People will leave for other Servers if Queue times get too insane :)
---
It's the *most*
---
It's not the only language.
---
Why should some of the largest communities not be catered towards? If you wish to speak English you can join a server.
---
Depends on your shaman spec as well. Fel hunter is the most common warlock pvp pet and they have a shit ton of magic resists cause they are basically magic eaters. So if you are ele/resto I wouldnt waste your time on them. If you are enhance you might be able to kill one pretty quick with a good windfurry proc.
---
For hunters I would think that you should just try to kite the pet while you focus the hunter. Either with earthbound totem or a low rank frost shock. If the hunter sends his pet real far away and you are enhance you might be able to kill it if the hunter is bad and doesnt call it back. As ele/resto most pets attack fast and will just interrupt your spells so again try to kite/ignore. 
---
If the hunter is BM you wont be able to kill it likely and should avoid their pet at all costs and just stay close to the hunter
---
&gt;Retail is actually more of a hardcore game than vanilla is. It's more consistent time commitment with dailies and the constant power creep. Classic is actually an amazing game for the casual player if you enjoy the nuts and bolts of it.
---
Check out ClassiCast #13.  Mark Kern says the pop cap of 3000 was NOT a technical limitation but a game design one.  Allen Adham wanted realms to be tight-knit communities where every body knows your name.
---
Yikes so you admit to not know what you are talking about. D3 has been the same game for 5 years and people still play.
---
Play classic or don't. 
---
No changes.
---
Nope. You can layer early areas and leave the larger world alone.
---
That's true, but from my exp leveling 2 toons with aoe farming, most spots will be way more efficient with 2-3 mages.
---
Except not "Full stop", if there are better ways to impliment tthe current layering system without having as many downsides, then surely these potential "improvements" should be discussed?
---
Only the most extreme #nochanges crowd are seriously suggesting removing layering entirely
---
Tailoring/Enchanting work very well together, and Tailoring has some nice pieces you can make (BIS) for Raiding. Engineering is very good to have for PVP and even PVE as well. It's a tough choice, and I still haven't decided.
---
I'm actually extremely dissapointed in all the main streamers right now. I see it as their responsibility to be our voice and they aren't speaking enough about layering. I've heard little "nerd screams" that we all do when we get frustrated but no one is actually talking about it consistently. This layering garbage has been pitched as a necessary evil with so much smoke and mirrors around how long it's going to be there the entire community is divided.
---
I see us as approaching a critical point where there's no return and we're about to destroy the foundational pillar of classic wows social system. These streamers should be talking about layering every single day, they have a direct "indirect" ear to Blizzard. We all know Blizzard has favoured them to get into the beta AND THAT'S OK but they're not actually fighting the battle that needs to be fought.
---
I'm fine with a layering system that is a few weeks and can't be abused (if that even exists which I don't think it does). It needa to go in its current state.
---
I've played every private server, waited through the ques, while working a full time job, layering is flying/sharding in disguise, good on paper bad in execution and reality.
---
Do you have a link to blizzard talking about a hard pop cap.
---
Not trying to be a dick asking for a source, I would truly love to read up on that.
---
It will at launch. 
---
Most people that say that are just regurgitating what they have read someone else say.
---
Queues will be a thing especially because layering won't last 2-3 months (which is when a ton of people will stop playing)
---
The only thing we can hope is that blizzard feels the need to give everyone a detailed and in depth plan of the steps they are going to take when they remove layering.
---
A Venn diagram is not how enclaves work.
---
Don’t let me stop you from screaming into the void about an internet celebrity
---
And paying for sub changes what exactly? People magically keep playing even if they don't want to anymore?
---
it's almost as if its obvious whats gonna happen
---
You can cheat world PVP by leaving and joining shards/layers mid fight. There's also probably some other ways for PVE but I'm less familiar.
---
What happens when layering packed in tons of people into a server where people *dont* leave? Double edge sword
---
We can but you are missing the point here
---
I strongly believe you're way ahead with a 1 million EU players. There's nothing that would make you think that much players are interested in Classic even if you gather all information you can from different nations. Just look at youtube views on Classic videos, people watching streamers, commenting in the official forums, this reddit community, private servers communities. 
---
NOTHING makes you expect the numbers to be even higher than 500k. I honestly don't know what make people think Classic will be a enormous success that will make it pass retail in player numbers. It's delusional and Blizzard clearly agrees with that lower expectation.
---
That would be great, if fits well into what I'm expecting to happen. My best guess for WoW is that they will end the story of retail and tie it back into classic. They'll slowly merge retail and classic and continue on with the story of classic, while making Warcraft 4 after the end of retail WoW. 
---
 That's the only thing that makes sense to me at least if they want to make the classic content relevant to the overall picture, and they can essentially retcon all of their mistakes without necessarily saying they messed up the story. Also, after Ion's video about the next patch, especially talking about their mistakes with class pruning, I'm more convinced that this will happen.
---
No, we're bitching because it's a scummy move to put BETA test behind a chance behind a paywall.
---
Thank you hope to see you soon
---
This will happen in Classic as well, no doubts in the slightest.
---
I meant to test this too, thanks for doing so. I main a troll and I am in beta. Just forgot to see since I knew they removed it in one of the xpacs.
---
no chance
---
Makes looking something up, or talking to someone of another language, an incredible hassle. 
---
Not to mention that some name translations are absolutely horrific. Grom Höllschrei...
---
As a fellow Belgian I have to ask; when you say "dutchies" you mean the cheeseboys up north, right?
---
PvP server, ok. PvE server everyone will get along. RP server will be even more amazing.
---
&gt;min max
---
&gt;undead warlock
---
Pick one.
---
Big thank you, for this post! You're my hero.
---
Wow, you're not kidding they're locking up way too fast and eliminating the visibility and discussion of this problem with it.
---
#nochanges fucking lmao please
---
And the shills come like locusts.  There's a huge group of people on this sub who will shit-talk anyone who questions the right of ActiBlizz to charge more for this 15 year old game than any other game on the market.
---
 Classic is going to be great, it's gotta be great, you know this is gonna be great. Classic is going to be great, and if it doesn't work out, i-i-if Classic doesn't work out, Classic is going to be great anyway, cuz you know why? We're going to make it great, that's why.
---
I don’t understand celebrity worship either. And I never said anything about it being unique to this generation.
---
I don’t know if I have the solution, but I know simply having Reddit or some other online forum decide won’t fix it because the majority of players don’t use Reddit/read wow forum.
---
Fake as fuck and how pathetic do you have to be to quit your job for WoW?
---
Who did it in under 4 days?
---
I guess People just prefer different things. And nowadays People are used to a faster moving world where they get every need satisfied immediately. 
---
So a lot of People don't want to wait I guess :o
---
IDC REALLY I JUST WANNA PLAY. Sharding? IDC // Language Realms? IDC // I WANT TO RIP SOME GNOMES
---
You and I both know that’s not true.  Also, my swear words don’t make me any less right either.
---
It does not have anyting to do with education level, it's just that in smaller countries, the majority of English content is not translated due to the amount of people living in said countries, and the cost of translating/dubbing is therefore not interesting financially speaking, basically forcing those populations to use English because in certains domains there are no equivalent in their native language. 
---
For instance in France you can perfectly live your entire life without needing to know any English, without being exposed to it if you don't particularly want to.
---
Doesnt really change the fact that people from those countries dont really speak English.
---
Try to go there and you will see :)
---
As someone who has always played healer, I've always felt that these early dungeon levels help you prepare for the role you're playing. Tanks have to start learning how to deal with multiple mobs, dps have to learn how to focus down targets and kite if they grab aggro, and healers learn when to heal to minimize their chance of drawing mobs. I've pally tanked DM multiple times because people get desperate and want to start, and it's not a good time holding aggro, but communicating cc and who to focus gets people in the dungeon mindset early on instead of it being a faceroll
---
Fun fact:
---
When Vanilla launched, many places had English Names (Ironforge, Black Rock Spire). After maybe a year Blizzard started to localize those places and the Community went nuts in the forums because they wanted to keep the names they were used to.
---
I'd ask for an invite out of the layer should I be thrown into his.
---
Localization? Really? Just need a country name into the server name. Ex : "illidan-FR". Boom done.
---
And server for central EU are in Paris and Frankfurt anyways so no need to buy server anywhere else.
---
This alarm will sound every 10 seconds when everything is ok.
---
North Euryp here too. We're the best in English after the Englishmen.
---
I expect that there will be a drop off after the first weeks. But not to the extent Blizzard does. I'd guess that Classic will be quite popular and Blizzard will be forced to open up more servers because eventually they have to turn of layering.
---
Are you kidding, There are post on the official classic french and german forum where you can find recap of what guild goes what faction. Germany has more than 60 guilds ready and French more than 40 and we are only 2 months away from start.
---
&gt; I'm super hyped for Classic and this announcement just hit me in the nuts, I can't believe we won't be able to find 3k+ players from each european country, this is just bullshit and it just shows how some people at Blizzard don't believe in Classic. 
---
Blizzard doesn't have any metrics for Classic WoW.
---
They are ASSUMING that Classic will be a side game for Retail players, hence, a niche game.
---
But worry not. On August 13th, when millions will resub to reserve name, Blizzard will get a MASSIVE wake up call. 
---
All this "several realms for EU" and "no need for language based realms" BULLSHIT will end, abruptly, on August 13th.
---
&gt; To some extent even Germany.
---
Can corroborate. I'm just about the only person I know that's comfortable communicating in English.
---
"Tons of support" for RP-PVP server? Where are you getting numbers? Seriously, people are just too delusional about Classic to realize we don't have any metrics and that Blizzard actually has that info better than any guess we can make.
---
I never understood why these countrys need the game in their language ? why not just english like the rest of us ?
---
53 here. Have no kids,no wife, no real future, but the battle station is ready and have a few days off at launch. Can't wait.
---
You can?
---
Yes, **current** service. 
---
One that has absolutely nothing to do with the **TESTED** service, except name and general concept.
---
People obviously are not interested in BfA, and want Classic, why are they forced to pay for BfA, in order to test Classic?
---
You are complaining about not getting a companies property for free. Beta or not, they have no obligation to distribute their goods free of charge.
---
Sorry, but as others have pointed out, it was a stress test, for them. It wasn't a free trial, or a beta. It was simply to test how their servers can handle large amounts of traffic at one (hence the random dc's and having everyone reconnect at the same time). It will be coming in 2 months. Keep working and earn that irl gold. It will be coming out, soon.
---
&gt;10 days for the vast majority of players.
---
Because the "vast majority" of players aren't insane, no-life, poopsock, losers rushing to finish?
---
Yeah that's true. But swedes, man, swedes! We are a special breed in this regard!
---
Arena in classic would be horrible. Do you not understand how the classes work?
---
It's already been proposed a few times the last few days. I'm sure it'll happen.
---
I use English so much online, on the internet, playing games, watching shows/movies, that my English is practically better than my native Danish. We don't have many technical words and just use English words instead. Playing games, half the words you use are English because we don't translate game-terms/words.
---
-------------------
---
For old games there are translations, but they are super awkward and cringe.
---
One I remember is Team Fortress 2:
---
"Headshot" - "hovedskud" direct translation, but it sounds super awkward, like "shot in the head". I got a "shot in the head" on that guy.
---
"Backstab" - "knivstik" knife-stab. 
---
"Sentry gun" - "robotgevær" robot-rifle
---
I fully agree, layering will help at launch, but could cause bigger problems down the road when it's removed.
---
Thanks for sharing that clip, I have seen it before.  It still doesn't make sense--is he assuming that they're in different layers because they're in different slots on his character list?  If I move a character up log in slot, does that then mean I've moved it's layer?That's not how Blizzard has stated its going to work.
---
Back to your scenario and to answer you:  Yes, that's theoretically possible if you can control what layer you're on as you've proposed.  Although ultimately, I think that would be a really inefficient way of grinding.
---
Their concern should be to provide the vanilla experience, not this shitshow
---
Lot of hype on our end though.  Region locking russians is great
---
\^This
---
The Russians are likely getting servers because they require data to be stored inside their country.
---
While English may not be the top SPOKEN language in Europe, it is most likely the TOP UNDERSTOOD language in the world.
---
You obviously didn't play on pserver, this shit is going on for 10 years now, and it never stopped.
---
I think Russians are getting the better deal here so it's depressing to hear almost nobody there wants to play classic.
---
They might not think it will fail at all. The reality is, Blizzard is run just like any other massive multinational corporation where limiting costs is just as important to profit as gross income is. I bet that nobody actually working on the game itself thinks layering is a good idea. It's likely some suit not providing the budget necessary to add additional servers for the game to allow for layering to be avoided.
---
lmao most people do this and the majority of french people still are fucking unfriendly. even more if your sentence in french is kinda wrong. you just prove what we all think about you baguettes
---
\^\^\^\^/s dont take it too serious
---
You seem like a very positive person. What’s your determination of “fail”?
---
Omelette du fromage 🇫🇷
---
There is no way around it - no matter what changes they make to layering it needs to be able to work so that if you get invited by a "friend" it will always pull you to their layer. That will always be exploitable.
---
38% of the population in Europe understand English well enough to have a conversation. Its lower for Germans and French...
---
So I can appreciate that it's a fancy new piece of back-end tech... but from an end-user perspective, doesn't it have the near exact same issues as sharding?
---
I'm just hoping for a Latvian-speaking community out there somewhere.
---
I mean, they're listening to the community, #nochanges
---
It’s not just a starting zone. It’s once they get out into other areas. Some people are gonna level real fast and will be AOE farming Hillsbrad and such in no time.
---
I don't want to agree with you, but you made my chuckle
---
Yeah this'll work, we just tell everyone to practice speaking English before release, then there'll be no problems!
---
And you have seen this lack of ibfrastructure yourself? Lack of funding? Lack of what? What evidence or sources make you tangibly worry? Conjecture weighs nothing in argument.
---
I didn't even mention the brexit specialists in this one. But man i guess there will be a lot of them lol
---
Yeah most people in germany who are not highly educated don't understand english well enough to read quest texts.
---
What? I explain myself. My italian friend would play on the italian server if goven the option, no one else would want to go there, germans on german, english on english and so on. No one would want to not join a guild because they dont feel confortable with the realms language just to play 5mans with their friends. We would all be separated. If the realms are together we can all go to the same server and whoever wants to be in a german guild can be, whoever wants to be in an english guild can be..
---
What a useless addon. Most if not all use the slang version of their language which is impossible to translate via GTranslate, not to mention it's not even good at translating the normal language most of the time lol
---
In fact, I think Blizz specifically mentioned in a blue post not to sub in hopes of getting into the beta.
---
Even for Undead it would be
---
I played in a swedish guild then, and I'm not even swedish.
---
What guild was this?
---
I’m kind of with you on this one. I think they are testing the limits. The stress tests have a lot of phasing going around, yet I’ve heard no such complaints from the Beta or seen it on any of the streams so far.
---
Plus I think even with layering mining will be heavily contested/difficult to level for a few weeks post-launch at least. If you AoE grind and buy the mats you don't have to deal with the frustration of finding nodes. You might also be able to find a regular supplier at a good price in exchange for goodies mages can offer (free ports, food, water, etc).
---
I'm not complaining about not getting a property for free.
---
I'm complaining that people have to pay for another service, that is different than the one they are interested in testing for.
---
Wait what? No split eu realms? Where can I read about this
---
Back during 2004-2007? The goalposts for acceptable speech have moved considerably since then.
---
a month for a person with a healthy sleep/work pattern ? i played in a private server 5 months and i was 46 with a single characther lol, i just enjoy bg and leveling my profesion, fishing, etc.
---
Great idea! If we blind them they can stop reposting
---
You and a small handful would want the game basically unplayable. A majority does not want it that way. I’m sure they did not enjoy it 15 years ago, I’m sure they would not enjoy it now. It’s not “the vanilla experience” it’s a terrible experience and nobody should suffer it right at the start.
---
I don't think you understand... the world. They still have millions of people playing their game, thousands of which I guarantee you were playing since launch. They get priority to test. How does that make loads of sense?
---
They don't need YOU to test their game.
---
Pff Enh us more than viable. Unless you already got 8 resto shamans a Enh is darn near dps neutral. Duh l2 theorycraft.
---
Also Nice.
---
They will change their mind when more than 6 million people will resub on August 13th, for the name reserve option.
---
Blizzard actually BELIEVES that the EU won't be able to fill up more than 6 realms !
---
Well, they are free to believe whatever they want...but on August 13th, the wake up call will be MASSIVE.
---
I think a lot of the frustration is because of the fact that it's so easily solvable by Blizzard. Sure, we'll find workarounds in the community, but it'd really be a lot more convenient if we just continued with the system we've had up until this point.
---
All it takes is the word 'French' and the word 'German' next to two of the servers and the majority of the problem is gone.
---
Everyone who said the EU was a mistake, come forward and claim your prize.
---
And what if I speak English, but I just dont want to use it in game? 
---
I speak 5 languages and English is my least favourable of them. I hate enough the fact, that I need to speak it at work... but for 15e a month and in my freakin free time I would like to speak in any language I choose to...
---
Maybe you should make a pserver then?
---
If you need me, I'll be enjoying the fuck out of Classic.
---
This is the best reasoning I’ve heard so far. Well put.
---
I think /u/zauru193 was suggesting that they might go against their word, not that they *should*
---
I don't think they were saying that layering is perfect, rather that they believe it is better than the alternative.
---
Danish here as well, fully agree. I've never used anything but English terms in games. Aside from sounding awkward most people will also react faster to the English terms, since everyone is used to them.
---
I'll give an heads up when layering is over, untill than play something else.
---
There is clearly a faction in the company that doesn't see the potential  Classic has, to the point they said they had no major releases this year. If i had to guess, its the business development team steering some of the resources for Classic development feeling that long term classic servers are not a goof investment when compared to remastering an older game and being one and done.
---
The engineers clearly seem to understand what makes the game better overall. Hell even ion seems to know. Still there is one guy who thinks this entire thing is a boondoggle
---
No big deal indeed, vanilla didn't have split realms. It is totally fine... Honestly don't understand why do many are babyraging over it. 
---
And layering will be gone after a while, I agree I don't like layering abit. But it might be needed for launch.
---
Paladin's have no ranged weapon or ranged abilities, so engineering is really useful for pulling with bombs until you get Linkin's Boomerang and the Ghost Buster gun.
---
I'll play, I'm just saying that this game is going to die out very quickly.
---
Again, only possible because hes a streamer and had an entire Entourage with him that can quickly identify layers. If you got ganked like this, you would have to have a bunch of people come to the same spot as you to see who was in a different layer so they could invite you. Or you could just whisper random people in a zone to invite you and hope they are in a different layer. You will always be in the same layer as your guild and group so I'm not sure how the average Joe plans indexing, managing, and abusing layers.
---
Yeah plus why not herb and alc?
---

---
Nope my character was super sober :)
---
This is so disappointing, I guess I'm going druid come classic instead.
---
Not surprising when they forced people to pay 50$ to play a garbage demo that looked like a mix of BFA and classic. 
---
Can't blame blizzard though, anything they put up for sale the fanboys  instantly buy. They could sell piles of horse shit and they'd still profit.

You wait until the GM's start throwing out bans left and right for banter and flaming between nationalities.
---
Theoretical highest DPS in Vanilla was survival spec running in and out and trapping, along with passive wolf for aura, and only once you hit an AGI threshhold. But realistically people are not 100% theoretical at the limits, survival spec end game was the hardest thing to pull off 100% reliably. Marksmanship is the easiest spec to achieve endgame DPS reliably. Beast Mastery is somewhere in the middle and can compete with Marksmanship, I didn't say it necessarily is better or beats it. In theory it should be behind it in AOE fights, and ahead of it in non-AOE fights barely. But survival spec beats both after the AGI threshhold is achieved with gear and buffs.
---
IT IS FOR EMPHASIS
---
That’s the thing, after p2 hits there is only one layer hence layer size=server size.
---
Exactly. And if they were to exempt specific areas from that continent wide layer, then it greatly resembles sharding because you'd have people phasing in/out when you're near the border of that except area
---
People are going to leave because either:
---
A. They are new to the game and the lack of polish / slower play style will be unappealing.
---
B. They are returning but the game “isn’t what they remembered.”
---
It has nothing to do with the “issues.” They are accounting for drop off in server size.
---
Take off your tinfoil hat and go outside for awhile.

People tend to forget what games are about. Especially with classic. Classic is a game that is meant to take a lot of time to play. Most people now want to do everything in a game as fast as possible and then complain later when there is nothing to do. A thing that is hard to do for some is to ignore all the elitist and play for yourself. Take all the time you need. Enjoy the game. Being slower or not efficient doesn’t mean you will miss out on the game. If you make bad decisions on the way, then so what? That game is about how you want to play the game. I see a lot of people saying you have to do this or that. No you don’t. Some things might make playing a little more difficult at times but you can still do it. If you want to play a class and play your own wired spec then do it and have fun with it. Not every guild will be a hardcore guild that only accepts certain things. I think a lot of people forget this. My friends and I have all played before and I promise you we will be playing for fun, not because we are pushing ourselves to be the best and most efficient. For some that style is fun but not for everyone. Don’t be afraid of doing something wrong. If it takes you forever to level you will still get to experience everything. Content in classic doesn’t become useless when new things come out. Even in the later phases, people still comeback to do phase 1 stuff because it’s still relevant during in the game.  This game is about the community. If you play with friends you will have a great time. If you don’t, then there is a good chance you will make new friends and still have a great time. This subreddit has changed a lot over the last few months. Don’t lose your hype based on what you see here and don’t be afraid of making bad decisions or taking longer to get things done. Enjoy playing and learning things at your own pace.

Shit i ripped my jeans. Time to make some daisy dukes.
---
It's not behind a paywall
---
I'd pay if I knew I could play, and will do so when Classic releases. /shrug
---
Hence why I would have liked the option of committing to X number of subs, like they did with MoP.  I'm not interested in paying for a chance to play, gambling isn't my thing.
---
Thanks mate.
---
I’d sign that petition right now. Has anyone made one?
---
It's to gate people, they have plenty of people willing to pay to beta test. Stop whining cos you didn't get in and/or you're poor.
---
It can be, if you pay attention to the numbers and make all languages subset of "server population". This way, it looks like German is a subset of French.
---
There are hundreds of swedish and danish only guilds.
---
That being said there should still be french/german realms.
---
Just shows blizz thinks classic is gna fail.
---
Lol have fun playing league / fortnite come november
---
I played on an international private server for months, and there was absolutely no problem.
---
As long as quests logs and items can be linked in the chat channel (witch was not the case at the time) we are fine.
---
Be explicit when you name your guild when you create it and you won't be approached by a non-yourGuildLanguage speaker.
---
Furthermore, you are a programmer. Build a website that will list servers names, add a link to armory and let people who bother add their natural language. A few weeks later everyone should be able to preferentially go on a server by the community main language.
---
All things said, It seems really weird indeed that Blizzard didn't manage to deal with it. At least they could have started with localized servers, and merge those with too few people...
---
But it really looks like Blizzard don't want Classic to succeed, and it's a shame.
---
Regret nothing.
---
As long as NA servers stay far away from servers like Ragnaros, I’ll be happy.
---
Fuck this nationalism bullshit. If you want you can adapt yourself. otherwise just don't play and continue to enjoy your lazy shitty life.
---
The more games who chose to only have international servers, the more people would be used to this kind of situation, and all those problems would be gone.
---
Come on it's 2019, you are a gamer and you can't speak two words of the most spoken language in the world to play their favorite game ? Well nice don't play so, we don't need you anyway.
---
Well the hardest part is getting your alt in a different layer than the other (either by creating it later or getting invited by someone in another layer). Once you have done that, they will stay on their layer even if you log them off.
---
It's easy to verify 2 alt are on different layers, (if they are on 2 different account), log them at the same place, if they can see each other then they are on the same layer, if not then they are on a different layer.
---
I am also 36 with a wife and daughter... And I am super pumped to play classic WOW again!
---
The sad truth. 
---
Just look at the amount of fanboys downvoting the thread.
---
People are dumb. The most enjoyable part of Vanilla for me was making friends from Germany, France, UK, Sweden, Bosnia and so on in the guild i was in.  
---
But hey... everyone is entitled to their opinion.
---
&gt; anyone arguing otherwise isn't worth hearing out 
---
You're definitely not worth hearing out, that much is obvious.
---
Don't wanna be rude, but you're just pulling numbers out of your ass man.
---
You're breathtaking :)
---
Layering will ruin Classic.

#WakeUpSheeple
---
Québec motto is "Je me souviens"  
---
It may be paraphrased as conveying the meaning "We do not forget, and will never forget, we will never surrender our ancient lineage, traditions and memories of all the past." Try to say to a French Canadian he have to speak english.
---
Feeling the exact same way, frérot ! upvoted
---
ok, so from the videos he can jump between layers by getting invited by friends in the different layers. Does this happen in wow now? How can people choose or know which layer they are on?
---
Are you kidding? There are over 30 retail servers for germans. Even back in classic there were like 3 RP-PVP servers for germans.
---
What we have here gentlemen is an American with no clue about European culture. If you don't understand why some countries have been using English servers with no issues and other hasn't, YOU HAVE NO FUCKING CLUE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!
---
If you say so.
---
How bout buff while doing trash and everyone he ready on time?
---
a server only needs 3-5k players
---
do they seriously think that they wont even fill up 1 dedicated german/french pvp server?
---
we dont need 5 EU servers, we need 1german 1french for sure and maybe spain/italien/turkish/slavic/
---
a few english and some "EU who rather speak english and bank on else does too"
---
Did I just read a post with a German putting people with different cultures into "camps"?
---
Aha. Then it was not the same server. 😁
---
&gt;Then there is Firelands ... Now if they DID open up Hyjal it would include Firelands which ... feels very weird considering we have "defeatead" Ragnaros already. This is some Kael'thas shit, however him being both one of the first bosses then a boss say .. 4? tiers down the line would be something.
---
I feel like if they open up Hyjal they don't HAVE to open up firelands as well - having it be exposed by the cataclysm is a good enough cover-up.  I'm more wanting to see the Hyjal raid, than the Hyjal zone at any rate.
---
You are describing rose tinted glasses.
---
Memories are better than trying to recreate the experience.
---
Play the game, rush to 60 and get burned out by month 3... play the game and take your time to create new experiences... or don't play.... plenty of other quality games out there that aren't 15 years old.
---
Dungeons are instanced anyways so they could show up together regardless of layer.
---
You’re right, you’ve convinced me with your overwhelming amount of data.
---
Layering is going to save server populations when the drop off happens.
---
I honestly got a bit excited for the banter between nationalities but then it dawned on me that I might get perma-banned for calling a Frenchman a 'cheese eating surrender monkey' in jest.
---
Hey as an english speaker. I just want to say thank you.
---
Default view is a higher red contrast.  There was a post talking about it this past week.  People had to go in to manually adjust values.
---
If you can see into the future, why not make yourself more useful to the people of earth?
---
Réservoir de merde!
---
Im not sure seeing the layering in action in the last two stress tests has me believing that aoe farming may be fine even on a pvp server.
---
for reference, /r/wow had around 600k subs in August 2018 and 850k subs in October.
---
Going by the game's subscriber count [leak](https://twitter.com/WeakAuras/status/1051812677578838016) BfA had 3.2 million subs in august and went down to 1.7m by October.
---
basically, reddit numbers can't predict playerbase numbers at all.
---
You all do know there will be multiple servers where you won't have to deal with this right?
---
I think you can do this in WoW now, but I'm not sure. Idk if you can choose your layer, but you can switch between a handful of them if people are on call with invites.
---
Thing is, we know there will be plenty of french, German, and Spanish people playing the game, who are in the group of people that prefer to play on their own language, you of course also have some that want to go on an international server. 
---
For now, server transfers are not a part of what blizzard intends to offer at launch. Let's say you're from Belgium, and want to play on an international server, but haven't been actively researching anything leading up to classic. With the current set up, you could risk landing on the unofficial french server, now that, would probably, due to the size of France, be a server where a majority of players are french. You, however, are from the north o Belgium and don't speak French, but only realise how severe the frenchness of the server is into your 20s when you keep getting kicked from instance groups. 
---
Now you either have to start over (which you likely won't as you weren't engaged enough to have researched beforehand), or to keep playing the game as a single player experience. 
---
For me personally, it isn't an issue, I feel confident in communicating in English, and I am going to do the research with my guild to ensure that we end up on an optimal server (located in Sweden or the UK, depending on their datacentre setup) so we won't run into issues. But that isn't the case for everyone in central Europe. 
---
Through work experience with a cross-european company, I have found that those of us from smaller countries with good English skills severely neglect the importance of localised content.
---
As someone who has quit various jobs for various reasons, once you know you're done it's best to just resign.  Otherwise your lack of caring may really fuck up things for other people, make more work for coworkers, make you look bad for recommendations from managers/coworkers for your next job, ect..  If you know you're done just get out of there, unless you are an extremely disciplined person.
---
That blue post came post-factum to an obvious subs surge, that was initiated by their other blue post explaining that active sub gives you a chance to get the beta access.
---
If they were honest, this information would've been included in the original blue post and announcement.
---
&gt; There's more native English speakers in the world than French speakers in the entire world. There's more English speakers than there is French, German and Spanish put together in the world.
---
We're talking about Europe here. There are more native French speakers, German speakers, Italian speakers, Russian speakers than native English speakers.
---
This is my fantasy. I just haven't found the right Lawrence yet.
---
That and t-mog. "Look at all the pretty armor I have"
---
Yeah I know there are guilds, but AFAIK there's not a lot of Scandinavian take-overs of servers, nor in my experience trade chat spamming in foreign languages or as I said, much issue with communicating in English.
---
They're going to seem like they're a bigger percentage of guilds, since there aren't any Scandinavian servers, like there are german, french etc., but personally I don't think they're a big problem.
---
Start the petition mate
---
Yes, it's behind a chance, that is behind a pay wall. Apologies.
---
Thanks for agreeing with me. I'm glad that there are at least some people in this world still open to reason.
---
Don't you have people spam on Linkedin about shit that doesn't remotely apply to them because you see one tag match?  Nobody fucking cares.
---
The negative posts do kinda resemble the old forums though don’t they?
---
Personally, I enjoy a little trolling
---
We used to learn english when we were about the age of 12. Now english teaching starts at the age of 6.
---
It will be fine.
---
Not at all, if you play retail, if people link their keystone for exemple it's still in their client language.
---
No I don't I read it in some reddit post tbh :D
---
But it makes sense - why would they not have a Player cap if they have an estimated % of People leaving after the first couple of weeks. Why would they allow more People on the Server than they can holt after the expected dying of the Population "the purge" :P
---
No hard-solid Facts though sorry m8. 
---
I have searched for it just now but probably they have never talked about it. 
---
It most certainly will - but you are right I shouldn't use Info that is just an assumption :)
---
Don't forget the additional caveat to their argument:  If you don't agree with me you must not have played vanilla because then you would agree with me. 
---
Profound.
---
15k isn't a good cap by any stretch of imagination, it demolishes any semblance of server identity. It'll become like late Nost, with a different guy nobody ever heard about from a noname guild getting Thunderfury every week, and people not knowing each other on the server outside of some small circles or rare cases. 
---
I'm not certain the old 3k-3k5 cap is necessarily the best, and maybe they could eventually add 50% or so to that, but 15k ? That'd be horrible. That said, they confirmed the low pop cap was for gameplay reasons, so I don't think it will be changed much.
---
Or insta muting anyone who does. Great thinking.
---
Nah it's a stress test, to test their servers for launch day.
---
Get over it and wait for launch.
---
Personally I don't think so I think classic will have about 30-45k players per region come stage 2. That's probably be like 10% of what launch will have. Because once all the fortnite, cod players, old vets that don't want to do the same content again.. (all of which are in the majority) leave you are left with a small niche community who will be playing classic.
---
I like Robot Rifle
---
Because not everyone is a native speaker or speaks English well enough at all. Are you really that ignorant?
---
Might want to revisit my comment there bud.
---
I also feel like people underestimate the current live game. This expac is ass, WoD was ass, so was cataclysm but in between all of those were good expacs. It’s entirely possible that the shine of classic dies in a year if they completely revamp their live game and fix the problems there. That seems to be what they’re expecting when I watch them speak about classic. They know that it will always have a niche following but the long term live game is and always be their strategy and if they feel like the old version of their game is what people want and can see that with the numbers, they’re going to shift their design around the modern game to match player wants.
---
I didn't write a formal resignation letter when I left a fortune 100 company 2 years ago.  I had very good relationships with my managers and they knew I was leaving to move back to my home state.  Had no issue getting them to write me letters of recommendations.
---
I wonder what the ping is like from Finland to US East.
---
Honestly I think its only French people who have this weird sense of pride in their language. I dont understand it at all, I cant wait to play on international servers, literally the only thing is that english needs to be enforced and its perfect.
---
Nuh-uh! I'm being dead serious!
---
&gt;s a belgian i can say we would never make racist jokes about the dutchies.
---
the belgians (is that right?, im austrian) use the word kaaskopp whenever they see a netherlandic car sign. the "kaaskopp" shoutout doesnt seem very friendly to me :)
---
How long until Blizzard just starts banning the streamers instead of fixing layering?
---
This has been posted a million times. Just stop - we don’t need to hear your “solutions.”
---
They have a plan, they’ve considered these options already.
---
Replace dungeons with doing an elite quest.
---
No, I believe a lot of 13-17 year olds do and if children aged 8-12 are smart enough to cheat age restrictions than 13-17 year olds are too.
---
To be honest, I can't believe anyone with a job and the drama that comes with adult life, could be able to enjoy his theatrical, hyperbolic style of being angry all the time. It is way more immature than say Madseason or even Venruki. The latter being way more skilled and knowledgeable as well, making that a non-argument for watching Asmongold. 
---
Tl; dr: if I want to hear someone with a god-complex shouting for hours on end, I'd start slacking at work.
---
Just like private servers died out so fast?
---
I didn’t mean to put sharding. I just meant layering throughout my whole comment.
---
I think it would be cool to have no layering.
---
But i would also like to exploit it.
---
You answered it in your first sentence: "You always played the English version". If you grew up  in a country like Germany,  especially in the 80s or 90s, every entertainment medium is translated into German, so you get used to it. There are a lot of people that won't play classic knowing they need to speak/write in English. Also that's not the classic experience....
---
&gt; Exactly, sometimes you have a piece of loot with your worst stats from doing some random shit. But it titanforged the maximum possible and maybe even with socket and when you get your BiS item for that slot in the mythic raid oh well its just a baseline version so i dont wven want it because i have an item with shit stats for me that is better regardless 
---
Are you playing the same retail as the rest of us? There is almost no such thing as " i have an item with shit stats" unless a sim tells you that. If you really want to be good at the game target items after a raidbot sim. that "BiS" item you speak of is more often than not. NOT BiS because you do not have the other items to make it itemize well.
---
thats the main problem. fragmentation within the server will be very strong because many people including myself will filter people in a similar way. of course i will write in German when I know another player or group is from germany as well.
---
Spanish community will chose their own server probably. Thats fine. We just need to avoid that one
---
*britannia rules the waves plays in the background*
---
Thank you for link, I like your version better
---
Can we have a feature added that detects and auto translates one language into another?
---
In the game. Let's hope so, but i'm not holding my breath.
---
And why would it be 20,000 people? There are multiple servers. Wtf are you talking about? Lol
---
So funny TBH.
---
It’s a stress test. Most people run around doing nothing. It’s not a dungeon test.
---
Blizz has only shut down Nost after it got insanely big and got media attention.
---
They wont go to any ISPs to force them to block connection to hundreds of private servers.
---
I sure hope so. I have a good job; pay to win, baby.
---
The thing is, these servers will just form in unofficial ways, like let's say Trollbane will be the designated Dutch server, so why would anyone that speaks english want to stay there if half the population is Dutch. I'd expect these kind of arrangements being made before the launch so just keep an eye out so you don't roll on a spanish server let's say.
---
I don’t want layering in classic at all, I’m just pointing out that it’s a real risk that they keep it after p2
---
Thanks all, was sort of thinking about this set up for general PVE / occasional dungeons. [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#of0iZxgMufcut0h](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#of0iZxgMufcut0h)
---
Might put 1 into Arcane Resilience but hopefully everything will be dead before I need to rely on armour.
---
One thing I've noticed when watching people play competitive games is that everyone develops a stress stutter.
---
Instead of saying one thing clearly they say it 3 times quickly.
---
I wish I could find the arena footage I was watching recently but it's just a barrage of 5 guys yelling stuff like... 
---
"Silence, silence, silence! Watch the rogue, watcherogue, watchthrogue! Bubble, bubble, bubble!" 
---
It seems absolutely unbearable to watch.
---
Not everyone is level 15 in 2 days.
---
The issues and benefits are what makes it a neccessary evil.
---
Layering will be in at launch and then it won't matter in October.
---
Did you send it with the typo?
---
Why are you being so mean? I thought we were friends :(
---
every 10 minutes i swear this post is made
---
The biggest thread were locked man.
---
&gt; and everything to do with keeping costs down.

Adding servers doesn't increase cost. Its all virtualized now.

Not when they’re that young

then you are pretty pathetic to "Literally" cry over a game that didnt even come out yet and the testings are still in progress.

\^this, nordic people know this is just bullshit from people down south who just don't try and are uneducated monkeys.
---
How much these cost
---
There is a bigger difference between English and Chinese than English and german though.
---
If you think that then I have a bridge to sell you.
---
i agree completely, but blizzard has declared them to be working as intended (not necessarily 'correct' though).
---
Yes, everybody expects that.
---
&gt; They have a plan, they’ve considered these options already.
---
How cute. You're still naive enough to think that Blizzard actually considered the harder, but better solutions, over the easy and poorer solutions.
---
You people somehow think the Classic team are the greatest, without acknowledging that they all worked on retail and ruined WoW as well.
---
STEEEEELLLAAAA! STEEEEEEEEELLLAAAAAAA!!
---
Saying that there is "zero benefit" to his proposal is probably a bit harsh, it is definitely immersion-breaking to have layering in the game.
---
Yes queue-times and waiting for spawns are annoying, but I'd rather have a genuine feeling of a server, than a smooth launch.
---
If you both roll alliance, you're going to easily find a guild willing to take both of you for raids. Possibly even a very strong raid. As horde you will have a harder time(still not bad).
---
Blessing of Protection.
---
I'm not sure if you're adressing me or the MVP (of the *European* forums), but I'm Danish and he seems to be Dutch and both of us are saying we want national servers, rather than this system. MVP comes off a bit harsh in the OP, but he's basically on our side, as far as I could gather.
---
I’m talking about Ion, the guy running the show, saying they want as few servers as possible and they could have up to ten layers with 3000 players on each. “Lol”
---
Discussing solutions is important because that is what we need right now. Clearly the current layering plan won't work so giving blizzard ideas can only be constructive.
---
Because you need perfect english to play wow...
---
And if the fear is not have enough population for some languages combine some.  Italian and Hungarian as an example(just random choices may not be the best combination).  So while they will not all be able to communicate with everyone effectively they know they will be able to find a decent sized group no matter what.

Check the comments a bit further down.

:'(((
---
Your solution is neither creative nor unique. Not would it fix anything.
---
I'm 100% sure you lack brain power to understand why layering won't stay in phase 2. If you actually think about it, it makes 0 sense to have layering in stage 2
---
I'd like to do it arse about face. I speak English but I'd rather learn French, Spanish, Italian, Russian and German... maybe even some Scandinavian languages too so I can talk to everyone. I only have until August, plenty of time to become bilingual.     
---
Thanks for your big brain idea.

top KEK.

It was actually based on raid time.  The early group was good and the late group sucked.

You are on reddit where everyone is more or less fluent english. This isn't the case for a lot of the population.
---
Moreover, if you played during vanilla/BC you know that there is a big difference between communicating in english and using your own language.
---
Oh, if that's the case I take it back. Haven't heard anything about it, but I guess I might have missed it.
---
&gt; Omelette ~~du~~ **au** fromage

I totally understand old People playing that always played with their German Guild - maybe even right now in retail. And they always talk German ingame with everyone and everything. 
---
And I feel for those People that they will have to talk english to the other People. But only a couple of words at least :)
---
I don't think it's such a bad Thing either and if some1 Needs a Little help with english from a German just hit me up - I know some good teachers xD
---
Definitely lame.
---
I've waited like 12 years for WoW classic, so yeah, two more hours isn't going to be the straw that breaks the camels back.
---
Plus, the entire point of my post was to report my experience on the STRESS TEST realm. They were obviously intentionally taxing the server as hard as they could.
---
I see. That's annoying.
---
It won’t work why? What data do you have? What testing have you done? Give me numbers and reliable data.
---
Yeah it's some mobs though it's weird. A lot of mobs felt fine, but then some just didn't attack unless you almost sat on their face.
---
But you can have French friends on an international realm too?
---
I don't use LinkedIn.

You're putting me through Hell-aaaa.

Careful, they'll lock the thread.
---
You still will 2500-3500 players for layers is still a lot. You will still be waiting for spawns, just not fighting for it as if there were 100k players on 1 server.
---
Those were all the jokes... Projecting much with the wrathbaby comment?
---
The main interest of classic is the community.
---
I'm french so I'm fucked up with this.
---
I fail to see how it doesn't kill classic for me.
---
American culture demonizes anyone without a job at all times (unless it's a woman who has married a man).
---
This is not relevant at all. 
---
There are numerous people who are willing to pay for Classic, however do not wish to pay for BfA. Why are they barred from testing Classic?
---
Yes, remove layered environments passed level 20. Start the petition!

Seems like sarcasm, but if anyone believes this, the notion of a company spending millions of dollars and hundreds of employee resources building a game they will intentionally doom is outright ludicrous.
---
Oh man, the peggle addon, I forgot about that!
---
I'd much rather them go the FF14 Route and have housing be instanced over phased. Phasing means you really can't see or interact with other players. The instanced Neighborhoods in FF14 are really great and allow you to form small little communities.
---
That's good. As a recruiter I would take those letters and speak to your manager's about them.
---
&gt; So Australia, get prepared for those \~138ms pings to Los Angeles. Which  is still totally playable, just probably not what you wanted. 
---
\*Laugs in \~200ms from Latin America\*
---
Okay release at 1.0.1 and make sure the almost moth long loot bug is in right...
---
People should just chill.) With the whole hype train you should remember to manage expectations. Classic is not just layering and 99% of French-Canadians on a single server, the most enjoyable aspects of the game are all user behavior based, thus we make the game what we want it to be.
---
:/
---
I've heard tell of the right-click report option, but I assume there's no automatic detection? Those systems have never been very good at interpretting conversation, but if it's reported, at least as long as it's in jest and consensual, there'll be no problem. Fingers crossed.
---

If you can't even figure out how to turn off sticky targeting, I don't think you'll be doing much of what you say.
---
Because blizzard doesn't want to.

Also doesn't solve layering in 20 zones.

I'm french too and I find this really weird to just translate everything from foreign cultures. Like why american actors have french voice ? What the hell ? This spoil everything... And that's why french are so bad in a foreign language with such a bad accent.
---
I was thinking about doing the same. It looks great!
---
Google it you lazy bum
---
But they will ALWAYS find someone to play with in their language. Did you ever play a big private server?
---
Literally the most negative bullshit on this sub. Thanks for more of that!
---
What about all the stuff that is already working? 
---
What about all those changes were made to provide each of us a better experience?
---
Do you seriously think all that Blizzard is trying to do is to discourage us in order to make less Money?! 
---
Why do you think it is going to get worst?
---
Literally so much bullshit with Zero reasoning and Zero Background info - thanks for nothing m8
---
My friends played on german servers and i played with my friends. You just dont get it do you? My friends dont care about the default language of the realm but they care about being in a guild that speaks their prefered language and with this change at least when it comes to my group of friend everyone is happy because we can all play on the same server and everyone join a guild they like. You are welcome to disagree and im not saying that im right or wrong and i dont care if blizzard backtracks on it. Im just telling you why me and my friends like it. Understand?
---
The EU does not govern Europe lol, even if macron wishes they did.
---
Honestly i'm feeling the same. Watching streamers is fun to an extent but watching them all master the early game content is a bit disheartening. Everyone is saying enjoy the journey, don't rush.  But the streamers and beta people are enjoying the journey because of the level cap. What happens when classic releases? All those people will have already experienced the journey and will be rushing to end game. 
---
Where does that leave us?
---
Also, with announcements of other games like cyberpunk 2077, final fantasy 7 remake, death stranding, I don't think I'd be able to stay dedicated to classic full time.
---
What does this have to do with FROGS? Also why are you hating on the FROGS?
---
Can we sticky this?
---
The same circlejerk is getting really tiring, yes.
---
Delusional
---
That looks awesome!! Where can I get one of those?
---
I don't understand why they can't at least make "time zone" designated servers.
---
if it´s anything like in the beta right now, the Game will be, by default, installed in the same language as your BFA installation. For me that means German. Now imagine a World/trade/LFG chat were players from multiple different countries, all with highly different English skills, try to play together. 
---
It´s pretty cumbersome to try an get a group going for some Quests or specific NPC´s if you can´t link the Quest, because more than half of the server will not understand the German Quest or NPC name. Now imagine it with French, Italian, Spanish ect. Quest, NPC, tradeskill mats, enchants ect.
---
I can´t understand how anyone who thought this through or witnessed it in the beta right now can go... 
---
"yeah, this will be fine..."
---
dude, its a well accepted practice to exclude spanish speaking servers from serious groups for hard content on the NA servers.  It's so prevalent that its become a meme not to group with people from Quel, Ragnaros, etc.
---
Tell us some stories!
---
But that's the thing, it's not as cut and dry as people think. "Oh just separate them, what's the problem?" Personally I don't give a fuck. But, I can't imagine it being able to sustain a population for *every* single language. Private servers don't separate by language for this reason. Very few do, and they aren't popular at all for that reason.
---
People think they are crusading for the right thing, but good luck to them when in 3 months a lot of people quit and NA is the only region left with a healthy population.
---
Yeah, but it's great that nowadays we can have netflix and such to watch everything in orignal or with french sub. Surely my kid will grow up watching cartoon and film in original voice acting
---
I would go as far down as the current language split. It's not that people speak 4 languages. It's that people speak their own language and maybe some pretty bad english. If everyone spoke english on top of how many other languages it would be acceptable but they don't. Spain, France, Germany, Italy... these are probably the worst countries here with a large population who speaks bo or really bad English. It'll be a mess for everyone both for english speakers and non english speakers.
---
Of course they don't want it to fail. But they have prove repeatedly that they are unable to take good decisions and generally choose the most cost effective and laziest one.
---
This sums up modern blizzard and isn't going to change.
---
Also it's not just for "some" people. You are on reddit and everyone is fluent here which isn't the case at all in the french population.
---
Even so, on reddit almost everyone except swedish and danish is against it.
---
Id rather have multicultural servers than none but okay. I dont mind people spamming in their own language.
---
It's not pay to beta.
---
It's pay to be entered in a very small pool to be selected.
---
Stress test is pay to test since you pay then are guaranteed access...
---
Just like the lottery doesn't automatically make you a winner if you buy a ticket.
---
I have a job, I've bought a house and a car, I pay bills and credits, I have a bachelor's in comp sci, and i watch all 3 of the mentioned streamers while at work or even at home. Just because you are a certain age and don't like something doesn't mean everyone else around your age has the same preferences.
---
You and your friends had the choice and chose that. This does not mean that it is okay to take that choice away from people.

---
Technically speaking that's a bizarre-ass implementation.
---
&gt; People forget that when Vanilla started there were German servers but there was no German game - basically everything was in English. And nobody complained about it!
---
Pretty sure that is wrong. I remember quest texts in german when I started at release.

This has been over-discussed. Please stop.

No but I do have but you can find the original picutre [right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/c0omyf/reached_out_to_conpatshe_who_kindly_sent_us_a/)

What about those who speak their own laguage + english, but not a third one? What if they end up on a server that is mainly speaking that third language?
---
" People are overestimating how many from the EU can speak English or even want to speak it in their free time " Okay so what if someone can but don't want to speak french/german/spanish/whatever in their free time?
---
I agree with your conclusion but the whole argument is far from flawless my friend, things often go both ways.

This is true, but the worst case I've seen is Spriest, but that was the only class. The rest are a \~0.5-1 different from worst to best so if that ring is higher ilvl, but wrong stats the amount of the wrong stats actually make up for it.

Couple of thoughts that might change your attitude a bit, but not  really add anything to the actual discussion lol.
---
* I learned to read by playing pokemon, same with about 5 or 6 friends of mine, it wasnt teacher and it surly wasent my parents... lol. That being said, this is a great oppertunity to improve your english skills/ability. I am sure your wife would be excited to hear you use more and more complex english wordage. 
---
* French/Italian/Spanish are very easy to decipher for english speakers and the nouns are are usually so similar a native english speaker would have to be acting purposly obtuse, especially if you give context.
---
* I for one as an American like playing with people across the pond, if they don't have an anti-american biggoted bias ofc. It gives you a wider range of view you might not see just at home, its like traveling.
---
* Your accent will make every US female player swoon, imagine all that free gear/money they get from neckbeards then going to you.

---
I actually agree with a lot of what you're saying in this thread. They are going to see a massive drop off of players the first few weeks. That's leading them to try and inflate the server pops with layering to compensate. Which is in turn turning other people off.
---
I think they are actually trying to do the right thing for the most part. It just looks weird.
---
I mean in the western countries. Chinese with their population beat everything but you understood the idea, when traveling you use english in a foreign country where you don't speak the native language, because it's the international language.

I was a big fan of ShaguQuest, but it does not look like it will continue in Classic. I'm back in the market for one; I really don't like Questie.

The real tension is going to happen a few months after launch when the power levelers are tired of MC while the slow crowd is barely hitting 60.
---
You aren't paying the beta test. You are paying for a sub to BFA.
---
How did we have a choice to do that? Tell me how could i have played on an english guild while my friends where in a german guild and still play together???
---
When Vanilla happened, I did indeed! Some of my friends could barely write and understand English. I guess if you have friends who don't understand English *at all*, then that could be an issue

this guy thinks we are all waiting for the duolingo version.

Playing the current game also doesn't warrant that those people will keep playing classic after it releases.
---
There's no universal solution to this, however it is scummy to put beta behind a chance, that's behind a paywall.
---
There are numerous people who do not play the current game, as it is not interesting to them, but would love to test Classic.

Not all of Europe is even in the EU. Norway is only part of trade agreements for instance. The EU is clearly not governing a lot of EU states either, or Hungary and Poland would not have the political climate they do currently.
---
When you can’t win the argument, attack the person. Have a good day ;)
---
First off.. blizzard is a company. They’re not trying to milk every dollar because it would hurt their long term revenues. They ARE trying to ensure the best product they can by whatever means they can. You have no idea what metrics they’re gathering so you can’t say that what they did was greedy because for all you know they could be measuring the drop in population on BFA or how dedicated a paying player base is (and if you pay for something you treat it differently. I almost guarantee that in a non-payed stress test the players would behave differently)
---
Let’s just all calm down for a few months and enjoy the fact that we get a game we thought we’d never see again.
---
&gt;If let’s say Blizz was going to come out with 15 servers at launch, have them add 10 more servers.
---
You're paying for it, right?
---
I don't like layering, and hope it's gone ASAP. But I don't see Blizzard changing their decision and spending resources on more servers and dealing with people upset with dead servers/transfers/name changes.
---
Thank you for this. 👍🏻
---
Nope, layering is needed for a successful launch.
---
You can not play until they remove layering - see ya then!
---
You are certainly better than the average American
---
I learned most people have no understanding of economics or maths. 
---
They don't get that more resources (supply) = cheaper prices. One argued that there is going to be 3 times the devilsuar leather and thus the price will be three times higher in this very thread. 
---
I posted a big breakdown on how layering basically has no impact of net resources and really doesn't allow 1 person to get three layers worth of nodes. But its pretty much beyond most people.
---
Shitty public education man.
---
There aren't really any. Mechanically, the class is extremely primitive, by far the simplest of all. Just use the standard addons you would use with any class. There's no mage mechanic that warrants using special addons besides basic stuff like debuff timers, spell alert, unit frames, etc.
---
Thats just my opinion but i think vanilla dungeons are hard for the wrong reasons. Some may like it but i certainly find them less attractive.
---
I don’t see the problem with server merges as long as they give the absorbed server a free realm transfer option
---
Layering can be bad. Layering can be very helpful too.
---
Blizzard is a Company. Companies want to earn Money.
---
Servers are expensive. Layering saves Money.
---
Free Server Transfers are also quite expensive for Blizzard because they all have to be manually checked just like normal Transfers. Meaning that it is another cost factor besides the extra Server costs they would have. PLUS the Money they already invested into the implementation and optimization of layering. 
---
I could not care less about this Topic. 
---
But the Prior is all the reasons I know for Blizzard to not remove sharding/phasing
---
What a fun and interesting new topic to discuss.
---
You had German and English servers to choose between. You made a compromise in your choice, that is different from not having a choice.
---
You should go watch some footage of it getting abused AF before you talk, so you understand why people dislike it and dont want it in the game, and you should maybe stop sucking blizzard penis and actually see the problem in layering because of right now you are not helping anyone.
---
oh btw you want a solution? Dont have it at all, Period. 
---
Because not having it at all sure have some negatives but far more positives then having it.
---
Because having layering is only negatives right now.
---
I'm actually pretty sure they told people NOT to sub just for the chance to get a beta invite
---
Yeah but that'd cause 1 layer to get full really fast without anyway to leave it.
---
The funny part is a lot of them even thinks there were no separate realms and that's why they had this german or french guy in the guild. Little they know, this guy chose to play on a english realm and is like 1 out of 100 who did this. 
---
Little do they know how different this will plan out when you force the other 99 guys to play on this server.
---
You're just wrong. 
---
&gt;They are layering because it’s the new technology by design. 
---
They are not using layering because its new technology. Layering has been used in some form or another since Burning Crusade days. [[Source](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Phasing#Usage_before_Wrath_of_the_Lich_King)]
---
&gt;Most likely it’s too complicated to redesign server infrastructure to mimic what it was 15 years ago.
---
This is also wrong. They can even disable layering in individual zones at will. [[Source](https://blizzardwatch.com/2017/08/07/rp-tournament-event-saved-phasing-hotfixes/)]
---
Blizzard has said this is will only be implemented in the very start, to alleviate the starting zones, and will be drastically be toned down after the first few weeks. And will absolutely be removed within the second phase, when the honor system launches. [[source ^1](https://youtu.be/Q-GobXQTf6w?t=90)] [[source ^2](https://youtu.be/UHMd0KC3eTY?t=271)] ^(In source ^2, they specifically use weeks, not months to describe the time period.)
---
Do you like not being able to quest and level? 
---
I’m a fan of “the classic experience” but I would rather do just that, experience it, rather then leveling take EVEN LONGER.
---
Not at all, but if you want to play on an RP serv for exemple, you are screwed. 
---
I don't want to see classic becoming like retail where nobody talk or do strat during Raid or dungeon because non english speaker dont want to talk in english or can't. And if you tell me to just join french group, I don't want to spend my 2hours of play a day looking 5 times longer to find a french tank or healer.
---
Depends on what you mean by "viable". ***Feral*** is actually even quite good in early game because some of your BiS for all of Vanilla is disponible during the very first phase. That said, Feral's PvP can be extremely boring. You don't use catform against most classes outside of openers, because you're super squishy. So what happens is that you spend your life in Bear form very slowly bringing your opponents down, and just randomly play on Stuns/Kiting to go heal yourself once in a while.
---
**Balance** doesn't stricly exist as a PvP spec. Pretty much everybody plays a Resto/Balance hybrid spec. For the playstyle, yeah, you can totally do it in the first phase, because it's all about kiting and bringing your opponents down with Moonfire/Insect swarm DoTs, which will be good 70% of the damage you do. And kiting with dots does not require great gear anyway. Their biggest problem is itemization, even though ferals have to deal with that too to a lesser extent. Most of the good casting gear is class-locked raiding gear, and the offset pieces are rarely being handed to druids anyway.
---
Of course, all of that is about 1v1. In group PvP, both specs aren't good at all due to their low DPS. Their tankiness and mobility are useful for Flag Carrying and Base defending, but that's it. Then again, Druid has a very punitive gameplay. If you do a mistake out of Bear form, you're probably dead.
---
Can i ask where you've read about this? I'd love to follow those communities to know what servers to avoid.
---
Enough with these posts. It’s a necessary solution. If you don’t like it don’t play.
---
Could be improved yeah, it's an old one. But they must have had their reasons when they designed it.
---
As a native French speaker from Belgium, I assure you it's not language-related. Most French people feels unfriendly and rude compared to the rest of the world. It is not intentional from them obviously, it is simply part of their ways. 
---
You just have to get used to it. It's like insults in some English-speaking places. They don't really mean it.
---
Yeah, I hope they know what they are doing. I actually like Classic a lot and want it to succeed
---
Good point. I feel like tanking would be complicated for her. Can she DPS through all raid content? Would people consider it a problem she doesn’t want to tank?
---
People didn't expect more from a private server, made by volunteers, given away for free. People are resubscribing to play Classic, yet they can't play in the regions that we've had literally since the launch of the game. It's not gonna break the game, it's just a weird and sort of frustrating decision.
---
TL;DR: Agreed, load balancing is not rocket science, but in classics case it is not just a load balancing layer but instrumenting the server side application and a deep integration.
---
Agreed, load balancing for network traffic is not rocket science. But in a case like WoW Clasdic it is not solved by just adding a layer of load balancing infrastructure. In your usecase, you are keeping a user on one node for the entirety of their session. Fair enough, in my example above I used load balancing for each request separately hence the multiple times a second. You are using session based load balancing, where a user is attached to a node for the entirety of their session regardless of how many requests they send, and that is fine.
---
What I am sure you are not doing though is forcing your load balancers to assign a user a temporary new node because they are joining other users on another node to utilize some feature, while also keeping data for each user about their main node that they have to go back to once the temporary assignment is no longer needed. Unless you are, but that means you instrumented your app to actively manage the load balancing layer and that is a deeper integration. Looking at features of layering in WoW Classic they have done such a deeper integration.
---
What? You're gonna have to explain this reply since it makes no sense based on what I posted.
---
I already saw this coming when they announced layering and I tried to warn people... but I was told that I was wrong and it would be fine by so many people (who probably have no vanilla experience at all) that I just gave up in the end. Good to see the proof coming through finally so people can see what I and others were saying.
---
Although if not layering, something else does have to take its place for server stability and I doubt that they are going to change their method this close to launch. If they were going to, I would suggest server clusters that merge into one big server after populations dwindle. This is effectively static layering where the server is split up into say Ragnaros1, Ragnaros2, Ragnaros3 but  the players can't hop between them- once they've made a character on ragnaros1 they're stuck on ragnaros1 until the population of the clusters is low enough to merge them all together. This way you can stabilize the servers with a split up population without the negative of players hopping between phases (layers) to gain extra resources.
---
Not when it's relevant. That's just how vanilla is though. You won't be able to compete if someone invests a lot more time into the game.
---
That's even funnier because they will be affected the most. Enjoy unknowingly rolling on a german/french/spanish/italian server, only to later be considered an outsider! I hope finding a server where the vast majority settles on english won't be too much of a chore for them
---
On a PvP server you could spend 3 hours fighting to get to MC with epic Blackrock Mountain battles.  Can't wait

Of course that is a big factor too. In scandinavia people learn english early on in school. That's not the case in the bigger EU countries. Heck here in the german part of Switzerland we learn french before english in school.
---
But with higher education, you'll have more courses in english. You will also read literature in english and you have to write exams in english.
---
Its the "most". As I said specifically *in europe*, it is not. We are talking European servers here.
---
Oh I’ll wait until it’s irrelevant gladly
---
Since non-ËngIish speaking people will naturally flock to non-ËngIish speaking servers anyway, and since this process will take some time and thus will leave many people "trapped" and disappointed, so why not instead of waiting for the non-ËngIish speaking com-muni-ties to make the decision of which server should be which, Blizzard made this decision themselves.

I used to play TF2 with a bunch of dudes from Russia. It was nothing compeititve just dicking around on a server.

Like most of you I have had some bad times with people who speak different languages but I have also had some amazing times. I'd rather have them on my server as the good outweighs the bad but that is just my personal preference.
---
Again, you are missing the point. There will not be "multicultural" servers. The Germans will start their own unofficial german server and so will the french and the Spanish and the Italians. It's people like YOU who will suffer when you end up on a monolingual server with a language you don't understand.
---
It was absolutely slam-packed just hours after the stress test in Deathknell but I logged on this morning and there was maybe 10 people? Idk. It was nuts tho. It definitely encouraged you to group up for quests, at least?
---
Yeah 20/30 seems a good compromise, and there is no reason to have it on at that point anyway
---
As a long time Vanilla warlock player, the bigger issue with WoTF is that it breaks fear, but ALSO breaks charm. Dealing with rogues in pvp without charm is very very difficult unless you are SL
---
Me neither. The idolization of streamers is mind boggling to me. Twitch culture in general is mind boggling to me.
---
Now all of you get off my lawn.
---
It is always infinitely more interesting to meet and play with people of different backgrounds and cultures. Only barrier is the language but I'm sure the majority of Europeans speak/understand English at a level high enough to play a game. As a european myself (English is obviously not my native language) I played actual WoW (aka Vanilla) on US servers and there were people from all around the world in my guild and I would not trade that experience for a server of just people speaking my native language.

---
EU player myself, honestly I don't think it is that big a problem. My server at the time was 50% Hongarian and with pick-up-groups there was at times a small language issue, but nothing serious. I am personally really happy actually they are merging it, since it means more cultures will mix. I see enough Dutch people during the day.
---
Guilds around a language exist, and they existed back then too. We had Dutchboyz and some other Dutch only guilds, but there were also universal guilds that used English as a native language. General Chat was pretty hilarious as a result.
---
Honestly though, this IS the classic experience. European Servers were a language mixer with tons of guilds catered to specific languages and also a lot of guilds that mixed languages. I was in a guild that had Russian, Italian, Spanish, Dutch and Polish players and it was a really cool way to meet people from new cultures. If anything, this is something I look forward to once again. There were some other language-based servers but I don't recall them being that big, at least I never visited them.
---
My 5 cents.
---
If you go kill mobs over 3 lvls higher than you, the xp penalty is so huge I'm pretty sure you gain even less.
---
Please explain to me exactly what you didnt understand ao i can explain it to you. I dont understand what about it you didnt fully get.
---
They want to play but they don't want to pay. This is not supposed to be like shit talking or criticism, I think it's pretty common to see Russian gamers playing private servers but not so common they are willing to sub for it.
---
blizzard is a business, it doesn't make any sense for them to ignore millions of dollars to make a few of their early supporters happy and taint their fresh game by adding items connected to the old game
---
not a giant conspiracy, just the usual one
---
Not having a hard cap on how many layers can be created is going to be a disaster. Like 80% of the playerbase is going to end up on one megaserver that Blizzard isn't going to be able to break apart in any coherent fashion.
---
I mean I said I agree with you. Just gave you an example that it can even happen with smaller countries. :)
---
Yeah, but peeps only have to dodge like 1 or 2 servers to make sure they're in the green.
---
Here in the EU, we may not even have enough servers to support all the major languages. Your mother tongue is not english but you're willing to speak it? Me too, but we're the minority in this case.
---
What if you level to say level 30 and then realise half your server is french? You either remake char on different server or are unable to interact with half the server.
---
They work exactly like PvP servers, only you have to "flag up" or voluntarily turn on PvP.
---
&gt;Opposite factions guards will attack you I assume and if you sneak into a capital city you will be flagged automatically( seems like a given)?
---
Correct
---
&gt;Are there any other PvP zones on a PvE server? 
---
Not really, but there are guard mobs that if you engage or they engage with you in combat will flag you for PvP, like around some questing hubs.
---
The thing you said at the end there caused me physical pain and mental anguish.
---
Dont do lfr....
---
I think three months is too long. You want to set up server identity pretty quickly. It won’t take long to figure out which sever has streamers, which is unofficial English etc. A month should be more than enough imo. But I agree with your idea!
---
It's not a risk at all or extremely low. It makes 0 sense to have layering in p2.
---
&gt;And they always talk German ingame with everyone and everything.
---
Last time I played retail, no one was talking...not in map chat, not in parties. Communication rarely happened outside of raids at all, and those might be language specific as much as they want.
---
Not if I cant be arsed to speak english all day, when I do it enough in a professional sense writing e-mails, talking to english clients, writing on reddit in english.
---
I want english to just fuck off and play in german when I play games in my spare time.
---
Man, I hope so. That would be great, especially if Blizzard learns from this and tries to make their next expansions more vanilla-like in order to attract players.
---
Maybe putting slurs in your comment isn’t the best way to get your point across.
---
That is what it's like in Europe right now lol
---

You only get automatically flagged in a Enemy City.
---
How does name conflict work in the case of forced realm transfers?
---
People already do that for bgs.
---
What? There is no xp penalty for killing high level mobs. I literally did this already, I have no idea why you’re so headstrong that this isn’t possible
---
Back in the day when I was training my French skills, I would play on a French server with French game language settings and my skills improved so insanely much within a month. I did it in preparation for my final French exam and I aced that. 
---
The first weeks were hell though, I had to translate literally 20% of the words my guild/party members used, and I was lucky enough to have an awesome guild that had no issues with correcting my terrible French all the time to improve my skills. I will miss being able to do that in classic, I wanted to improve my Spanish next but ehh.....
---
Who doesn't love cheese though?
---
Yeah idk what he expects...

The only thing he consumes are hostess cakes and Dr pepper and Pepsi. For hours every day he sits and consumes nothing but sugary shit and screech about WoW.

Yep, this game is going to fail hard.

So you can mail them to every alt when you're done with them.
---
&gt;okay, only a handful of servers. no big deal

It will be a big deal when we only get a handful of servers to begin with.

If you get T2, weapon, decent off pieces and you're into PvP you can have a blast for the duration of vanilla.

The best part about Chinese gold farmers is the money they can make you.
---
Established Auction House players accumulate massive amounts of gold.  You start finding that ore supply is low and prices are up.  How the fuck is this random dude in trade chat selling 475 stacks of ore?  He is 15% cheaper then the AH too.  That's thousands of gold to purchase his stock.  But by doing so, you can make 30-75% by prospecting and selling the gems.  SO you start buying their stock, and making bank.  When they get banned, they remember you.  Develop a relationship with your servers gold farmers and you can be the richest player on the server.
---
AH Price:  22 gold per stack
---
Prospected cut gems average : 23.5 gold per stack
---
Chinese farmer in trade selling 475 stacks:  19.5 gold per stack
---
A full buyout will cost you 9,262 gold but can be processed and resold as gems at 11,162 gold.  This nets you a profit of 1900 gold.  Not a bad margin on 1-2 hours of work.  These gold sellers and material botters get banned regularly.  So when they make new accounts, they reach back out to you for easy gold.  Since you are monopolizing the market, with plausible deniability on material sourcing, you perpetuate the cycle.  You are the wealthiest player on the server, and the chinese gold farmer can only deal with you, since you're the only one with deep enough pockets to buyout his multi night botting spree quickly.
---
10 days played is pretty normal for people who aren't practice powerlevelers. 
---
At 3 hours a day, thats about 3 months.
---
Honestly, how many times has stormwind burned now? 3? Get your shit together humans. At least dwarves know how to built a non combustible city.
---
But what's your point of view? 
---
Do you want Germans/French/Spanish on international servers?
---
Because they won't learn English. They will just spam their own language regardless.
---
I've played on international EU servers since forever and I know for a fact that I DO NOT want Germans/French/Spanish on my server the same way I don't want Russians.
---
Why would anyone? 
---
Blizzard should just make them a server each and get them off our back.
---
You are the one refusing to understand, wtf? Your reasoning is fucked, don't advocate for blizzard taking choice away from EU players just because you struggle with choices.
---
Except it’s a derivative of the sharping technology they already developed in retail? 
---
It’s actually savings them server costs to not set up all these servers to spread initial population spikes. Idk if people played or don’t remember vanilla but there was a shit ton of dead servers towards the middle of its life span.... I was on one of them.
---
Fear is not really the issue. It's that it breaks and makes immune to charm as well.
---
Yeah prolly not though
---
It seems that we were wrong most of the hypers that we thought won’t reach level 30 actually won’t even install the client. I say all for the best.
---
Yep same, English feels so much easier to communicate with.   
---
Conversing with people i tend to forget Danish words so i use the English word instead, it's quite awkward but i usually ask if they could inform me what the Danish word is.

---
&gt; I was gonna play on german servers again and i didnt ask my portuguese,  italian, english friends with whom i used to play wow if they would play  because ot wouldnt matter because of different servers. As it is now we  all can play on the same server. 
---
You're an oddity though. The majority of gamers have either no friends or friends from the same country.
---
Yup but he also vanilla pay off is the fact that there are so few alliance warlocks so you get geared super quickly and are rare breed.
---
Thanks!  Is is just loose canvas? I didn't know you could do that. Always thought it had to be stretched over a wood frame.

IMO there's a lot of anti-Classic brigading going on in the sub. A lot of new accounts (not the OP) making whingeing posts about perceived issues. IDK whether it's butt-hurt Retail players or just shit-stirrers but they are here.
---
Would be far from the first time such a thing would be the case LOL
---
"I become sheepstar!" -&gt; "I'll sheep star"
---
Using google translator is a brilliant idea, because english is a forbidden language in Europe and you get stoned to death if you ever dare to speak it.
---
tbh i've come to think that the reason why there wont be national realms is because there wont be enough of each nationality to warrant a server of each type(rp, pvp &amp; pve) and that this is the 'solution' to prevent a shitstorm of people wanting to play realm type xyz but it not being available.
---
The teens of RGB everything needs to die. It's such a poor aesthetic.
---
I am a german student with polish roots doing an internship in italy right now. Boii can I tell you english is not well spoken outside of the engineering/tourist space in italy/germany. Please don't talk about poland, everytime my parents turn on polish radio my ears bleed, the way they pronounce the english band/song names.
---
idk dude when I play the lotto is don't get sad when I don't win? I think your mindset is completely wrong. TF/WF is an extra. I'm not sad if an item doesn't TF because I mean I didn't want that item in the first place?
---
If I raid I see I want legs boots and chest if a ring drops that is a downgrade from my TF heroic/M+ ring so be it wasn't looking for that ring anyway (because I look at base ilvl value not WF/TF)
---
&gt; melee classes
---
Only rogues - especially if gnome.
---
It makes perfect sense for the people who make the decisions if the alternative is to put 70% of a server behind a que.
---
I am well aware. But the majority are, especially the biggest European populations of players. And I’m not interested in getting into a political debate but EU countries are going to continue to grow even closer together so English will be important in the future.
---
If you want to remove things that were in the game due to limitations of the time then the debuff limit should be removed completely.
---
Because a lot of Germans don't want to play on an exclusive German server, and a lot of players want to play on the "best" servers. I don't know if that means the German server would be empty but it certainly could be at risk and honestly from my experience Germans are among the Europeans that prefer playing on mixed or "English" servers.
---
Agreed.
---
However if they don't fix this issue it will be cool to see how the cliques eventually learn to speak to one another. I imagine they will adopt the acronyms and basic words of the dominate language. So if English is dominate everyone will learn LFG VC DPS means " a dps is looking for a group to go into deadmines" then they can send the invite to them. From that point you just play the game without talking to each-other.  
---
we also have the ever looming LFG and LFR mods that threaten the Classic experience that might end up being used.
---
I took 2 years of French in high school and I wouldn't be able to function on a French speaking server. Shitty decision by Blizzard.
---
Just a little 🤣
---
Started playing on Warsong EU, afterwards that turned into the de facto Russian server, that wasn't fun.  
---
That turned into a free transfer to Emeriss, which turned into a Bulgarian server. Again, not much fun. Pugging just wasn't an option, we got a tight group of Scandinavian/Benelux/British players who were refugees.  
---
Or like..just try to play CS:GO and/or LoL Nordic/East and see how much fun it is to try and talk with people who don't even share your alphabet.

---
&gt; Even in this same thread other (assumed) Germans said that nowadays in Germany everyone speaks English
---
That's not true at all. In my experience ~50% of the german playerbase lack the necessary english skills to efficiently communicate. Not even talking about reading quest texts.
---
No it isn't.
---
This is unfair to the people who don't want to speak English when they play and have a reasonable expectation to be able not to, and it's unfair to the people who enter an English realm with a reasonable expectation of being able to get by knowing English, and are faced with a playerbase that they can't interact with in a game that requires social interaction as part of its gameplay.
---
Alright, thanks for the replies. Cleared it up. Hmm what to choose. I don't care about attacking anyone but it is fun having a feeling of danger. Just so annoying sometimes.
---
I can assure you many People are interested in both whether they will play it or not. Its just exclusive so people want it. Many People want the beta just  to play the game and they dont care about any testing at all. Thats what i think of you to be honest. Whats the point of giving the beta to somebody who doesn't pay and probably wont care?
---
yeah, no

---
My point was that if you want things removed due to them being in the game at the time because of techincal limitation, like leeway, then the debuf limit should also be removed.
---
I dont think leeway, batching or debuff limit should be removed
---
Good choice. They will learn more from that than their 20years+ of school..
---
You mean it’s getting abused when people are only screwing around and nothing matters yet? Who cares. People exaggerate it being “abused.”
---
Yea you right Who cares right when blizzard has went out of their way to add something in the game that was not in the original game and people are going to abuse the shit out of it, that seems like a problem to me.
---
But you are probs right who cares :)
---
Really scares me how off the community is.
---
Remeber when blizz said they would only have sharding the first weeks or only in the starting zones? Everyone was screaming, then they just changed sharding and called it layering and will have it applied in months and people are ok with it?

And what if you started on one of those, levelled till 55 and suddenly 60% starts to speak French and refuses to speak English?

Warlock is actually a really good combo. You can heal the lock as they now can blow all their mana without regsrd for conservation. You can heal them and give them blessing of wisdom. If they still go low on mana, lifetap + your heal.

When it come time for dungeons you could heal, dps, or tank. While they soulstone you in case of wipes.

Very old vanilla WoW joke people used to do in general chat/world chat/trade chat. You'd say Anal then link something, like Anal [Rupture], Anal [Judgement]. Just silly shit for the laughs.
---
Yes and my point is that statistically a much much higher amount of players come from english speaking countries in europe. So the most spoken languages in europe is a completly irrelevant fact.
---
If you're a recruiter, wouldn't you...be going to them? What you just said just nullified the the need for a recruiter. XD
---
I think that it's possible to fix that with addons. Like monitor incoming messages for links, if it's an item link, get item name and correct the link. Should be done by Blizzard, but probably not a big deal.
---
It is. The shit they announced yesterday will cost them many, many subscribers. It's mindblowing how incompetent Blizzard is. WoW Classic could easily be a fucking gold mine for them, I'm convinced without their idiotic decisions Classic's player count would surpass Retail's (at least in the beginning stage) but they apparently manage to fuck it up properly so that it ends up dying in a couple of years. Unbelievable.

I think they'll back-paddle. They have to. They'd lose too many customers. I already know most of my german (rather casual(no-raid)) friends will not play on international. + Ripple effect... others will consider not to play because their friends don't play.
---
you forgot retail bashing on a daily basis
---
And what if I speak English, but I just dont want to use it in game?
---
In EU there are more native speakers of German than English. I'm not sure about French or Spanish, but I think they are on the same level as English, so I dont get why English should be the ONLY main language for EU based realms...
---
Good luck getting a spot.
---
I dont think people are expecting anyone to quit, but after lvl15-30ish there is a lot more space to level, and not everyone is going to level at the same pace. If 100 tryhards and 100 noobs both start new characters at the same time, that's 200 people all in the same starter zone. But the tryhards will reach level 30 way faster than the noobs. So in the level 30 zones there is less competition for mobs, because the noobs are still lvl 20, and there are multiple zones that the tryhards can share instead of just 1, like the starting zone
---
&gt;Is it though? Isn't the 2nd coming of WoW Classic evidence that the genre has lost it's way and is returning to former glory by reconnecting with its roots?
---
... no. not really. just like every other vanilla/TPL attempt by other MMO.
---
it will have a huge pop the first month, drop like a rock after 3 month, and have a skeleton crew ( likely a huge overlap with the current Pserver crew) by the 6th month.
---
meanwhile the mobile gaming market share keep rising while the PC stagnate... especially long-term PC game like mmos.
---
That can't be the reason, because Blizzard uses EU (Amsterdam and Paris, I think) servers for Russian realms now and used since forever. I would be very happy if they would put servers in Russia, because now I'm playing with 90 ping and I would play with 50-70 ping which could be noticeable. But that's not happening.
---
The Hunter is now in melee range and has gone above 110% of the tank's aggro.  The boss turns on him, he dies a horrible horrible death, and everyone laughs at him.  Also probably wiped the raid.
---
(This would also happen if the Hunter is in Ranged, gets to above 110% of the tank's aggro and moves into melee range.)
---
Well yes, im just saying why i prefer it. Not that it should be like that. And the reason i prefer it is the explanation that blizzard gave. If its good or not is not what im doscussing here. For me it makes sense, for others it may not. And if blizzard backtracks on it because of the majority of the community wanting it to be separate theb im completely fine with that too.
---
I know. I can read. I was just thanking them for using english terms in general.
---
I'll highjack the top comment for some aditional info from the Druid Classic-discord:  
---
Background and purpose:
---
It has been noted by beta testers that Druid damage in feral forms felt under tuned, especially by players with experience from private servers. The disparity in damage was illustrated by player Imaten and Ignus here:
---
[https://imgur.com/a/Zh5Z3au](https://imgur.com/a/Zh5Z3au)
---
Since this translate to a damage-reduction of as much as 30 % for ferals forms (beta compared to private servers) further study was warranted
---
Conclusion:
---
1. Damage in feral forms on Beta-servers are consistently lower than on private servers.
---
2. Due to lack of data from vanilla it is not possible to determine if this is a bug or if the private servers was over tuned. The very few datapoints that are available indicate that either could be correct.
---
3. Data suggest that feral forms lose around 10.1 dps at lvl.60, a loss of 141 AP at max level (compared to private servers).
---
Method:
---
To examine the disparity between private servers, beta servers and vanilla the "Druid Classic" discord-community collected and compared data between each source. To account for gear, buffs and talents the damage-range was converted to (paw-damage) in the following way:
---
PawDamage = (MaxDamage/Attackspeed)/DamageFactor - (AttackPower/14)
---
\- MaxDamage, the max-value displayed in the damagerange of the Character screen.
---
\- Attackspeed, attackspeed for bears is 2,5 and 1 for cats.
---
\- Damagefactor, accounts for talents (natural weapons = 1,1)
---
\- Attackpower, displayed attackpower in the Character screen.
---
The data can be found in the following table:
---
[https://imgur.com/f89LgZA](https://imgur.com/f89LgZA)
---
The results are illustrated in the following plot:
---
[https://imgur.com/a/KyzOqO5](https://imgur.com/a/KyzOqO5)
---
Comments:
---
It should be noted that the plot shows a dps-loss of 10.1 at lvl.60 (for both catform and bearform). This dps however, should not be compared to data from dps-meters from encounters and such. The damage shown in the plot only refers to the base damage / paw damage (normalized white damage without talents/AP). Rather, it is more correct to note that feral forms on beta effectively has about 141 AP less than on private servers.
---
It's a business. If you think this whole endeavor is for the player than you are fooling yourself. Not attacking you personally, if it comes across that way I apologize
---
k thx bye
---
Google translate mod for Classic?
---
Then it's probably a bug. There is definitely xp penalty for killing red mobs. Or at least there was.
---
Do people really say this? "I hate this thing because people who aren't me enjoy it." Weird.

Yeah and saying respecting implies that they’re somehow being disrespectful by speaking their own language
---
Haha Catalan people really take pride in speaking Catalan so I can see why
---

That's why I'm proposing something to avoid that.

Haha yeah that makes sense actually. We'll have to see how things turn out. I just how they don't f this up

---
yeah sure.
---
Well said! Im not sure the layering defenders have thought this through that same way you explained.
---
Daaaamn, that fucking SUCKS. I wonder what the release dates will look like. Hopefully theyre not months apart, I was really hoping to jump into bg's at 19 right away for a week or so, guess this changes things quite a bit.
---
People likely prefer to speak their mother tongue for a number of reasons but they may be unwilling simply because they're not confident in their abilities with the language.
---
Ultimate dungeon hero first time around was 0/30/21 druid, play tank or healer without respec. I even tanked UBRS 10man using this spec although I didn't tell the healers...
---
its valid for me
---
These analyses are somewhat biased by older generations. I don’t think Blizzard is going for the 65+ demographic. To my knowledge, English is taught from a young age in many Western European schools, but my experience is largely shaped by Dutch, Austrian, Danish, Scandinavian and German experiences, which all do well in the linked analysis.
---
Yeah, so I have an idea -- let's split that 80% into different regions and languages!!!!! 
---
/S
---
Back in vanilla a lot of the high pop servers were pretty unstable during normal raid hours, even when there wasn't a queue. You'd be part way through a boss fight and get a massive lag spike that would not only wipe you, but leave you waiting an extra 10-15 minutes while everyone tried to log back in.
---
Why in the world would they ever punish you for killing a higher level mob than you.? That was definitely never a thing
---
I think it comes down to the widespread nature of English. While there definitely is more German and French speakers in Europe, they are very localised in Germany and France (and to an extent the neighbouring countries).
---
Also by no means am I arguing that there should not be &lt;insert nationality&gt; servers, but rather that people see the upside of said servers possibly not existing.
---
Exactly you know what items you want because of their base value. So you might be really excited to get specific boots but oh you have completely different boots titanforged so you dont want the boots you originally wanted anymore. Except if the titanforge aswell.
---
I think the other dude is being pretty absurd too, but come on. The big private servers right now have consistent populations of well over 5,000, sometimes as high as 9,000 online at one time, all on one server. You almost ALWAYS see this many people just walking through a capital city.
---
Huh... i can't write a comment on this issue without flaming central Europeans.
---
I get both sides of the argument, it just blows my mind that this is an issue in 2019.
---
Really it's mostly that alliance are better in raids.
---
The cities are way better to me.
---
City locations.
---
Early zones.
---
BG queues.
---
Horde do have better PvP racials though largely speaking. But threat blessing is insane for pve. Fucking INSANE.
---
French dude here, I feel exactly the same as you. I wouldn't mind, but that's not what I was planning. Also I'm really not looking forward to picking the wrong server (like Spanish or Czech server), I'd be better off on an english-speaking server..
---
I’m resubmitting it once I get some sleep. Late night writing reports followed by having to get on the road for 9 hours, while negotiating finish details 👍
---
I never understood the desire for gamer girls. Good for you.
---
Im 'crying' about overpopulation AND i want layers. 
---
Layers are a good thing imo. I dont want to fight with 60 other players over spawns in fargodeep mine. 
---
I did that last night and god was it a chore. You couldnt even farm boars or spiders or wolves as there were plenty of people just running around killing those as well. 
---
All praise the layers
---
NA servers have had Spanish servers for forever now. Not 'official Spanish servers' but the community figured it out quick enough.
---
Mixed is fine, however starting on Neptulon let's say and finding it's 95% Bulgarian, is not a nice experience.
---
Groundskeeper Willie was Scottish :D
---
There's a shocking lack of "TUGA".
---
If I learnt anything from watching Preach's videos, it's that you don't want to be the non-greek on an all greek server lol (not racist pls no ban just memeing)
---
I can't speak for France, but that's the case here in Switzerland. You technically could choose to do all that stuff in French/German/Italian depending on where you live, but nobody does that.
---
smthg like  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLxhMLZVG0oZVtcofo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLxhMLZVG0oZVtcofo)
---
Having layers beyond a certain zone/character level is really our only complaint because if I’m being honest, then yes, I completely understand and agree with the reasons they’ve laid out for why they’re doing this. But we’ve been to this crossroads before with Blizzard: they say something needs to happen to fix a problem, all their reasons make sense, but it ends up messing with the game we love to play and over time it ruins it. There aren’t a lot of reasons to trust Blizzard, and when it comes to layering, after seeing people come out of nowhere, my level 40 being put into a new layer when he joined a party with people across the continent and I lost the mob I was killing, I don’t trust their implementation of layering.
---
Is it 12 days /played or 12 days IRL ?
---
Huh. So I'm not crazy? Playing a druid on the stress test right now and my damage definitely feels lower than it was on private servers. I remember 10-20 on bear being super easy, like being able to pull 2 mobs at once all the time, but on the stress test I'm taking like 15-20 seconds to kill 1 mob.
---
Great points
---
I have another job to go to, better pay and conditions.
---
&gt;There are smaller private servers for other languages out there, so if they really wanted to roll on a pserver that was the one they chose despite the tiny communities on there.
---
So if those are just tiny communities (as you've called it), why should Blizzard even care then, if the majority hasn't a problem with English? Yes it sucks for them, and yes, I still wish Blizzard would implement language specific servers, but does the game really need this for the large majority of the EU playerbase? I don't think so tbh. So far, it was just French, German, Italian, Spanish and Russian servers that had their own...I never heard of anyone from Greece, Finnland, Scotland (kek) or Slowakia complain that they don't have language specific servers...they just got along with English servers, although folks from the east might even have a harder time communicating in English than Germans for example.
---
I know I go against the wheel on this subreddit, but I hope people realise that most people wont exploit layering as much as we see in those clips, as often the streamers we see clips of are quite popular and wont have an issue getting into an other layer, but your average joe wont know people in other layers to whisper and get invited into them, and the thing is blizzard stated that layers will only be in place for a limited amount of times so I really dont get the whining about ruined game experience, I played in the first stress test and it took me around 2 hours to do 4 quests because of the amount of people, how is that for a bad gaming experience...
---
Makes me realize just how shitty the loot system in WoW is now. Slap different difficulties on raids and dungeons, bis isn’t even bis 😂
---
Care to explain ya chubby punk kid?
---
If you think those countries matter to Europe you are a fool. The same countries that make up the biggest population of European wow players make up the most of the EU politically as well.
---
This is a funny statement.  They didn't ruin WoW, you may not like the changes but it's not ruined.  If by ruined you mean that subs are down it due more to outside influences than development.  The fucking game is 15 years old, you cannot reasonably expect a game to hold 19s of millions of subs for decades.  MOBAs, F2P and mobile gaming wrecked havoc on the PC gaming industry over the last decade.  Fact is WoW is still standing and developing which is fairly impressive.
---
Pretty sure all of these are actual posts.
---
Then why would they have a beta? It's solely so that they can listen to the community to improve the game.
---
Im not blindly defending them. I just think its a reasonable thing to do. They cannot determine whether you will be able to afford the game or not if you're not subbed for quite a long time now. Tell me, when did you start playing ?
---
Almost every big streamer has video clips of bizarre layering abuses... Wat?
---
The exp per hour is better and is  uncontested.
---
You absolutely shouls dungeon grind if you can
---
Yeah I totally did. I’m resending it
---
Go PvP
---
Byyyeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
I’m russian and I ll have servers with my language. Sorry
---
Pics of the nice dog or gtfo
---
LMFAO
---
Cool, I was basically wondering if it was a threat threshold based on class, distance, or ability type.
---
I don't see people defending streamers people making it clear the legion of trolls and sycophants that follow them are the problem.
---
r/classicwow : omg bfa sucks no one plays wow anymore. Blizzs subs are dropping like flies. Realms are dead.
---
Also r/classicwow : OMG THERE ARE MILLIONS WHO PLAY WOW IN EUROPE HOW CAN WE NOT HAVE A SERVER PER TOWN!
---
But my bonuses!
---
Except it’s not a good solution. It’s a less effective layering, lol
---
Ok, let's all go back to not having first world problems because there are third world problems. Let's all have third world problems!
---
Let's bring everyone DOWN to a lower level instead of lifting others up. #SettleForLess
---
Idk if I'd say difficult, mostly just annoying. Invis/caster mixes, Twilight Hammer minions who can't decide whether they're in water or not, and that silly chest with a huge respawn timer. That dungeon always takes too long.
---
So you could PvP there on a PvE server right?
---
Another solution: only 1 server of each type for all eu^^
---
&gt; You're funny dude. More people in this screenshot than you'll ever see together on a private server.
---
lmfaoo
---
what a joke of a guy. priv servers have 3x this amount
---
how about we brownlist them ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
In PvE don't warlocks do objectively less damage as horde due to being threat capped?
---
How bad was it ?
---
I am a guy from Albania a small country south of Europe thankfully for me English is taught in schools as a mandatory foreign language so i can understand issue for people that are from countries which do not apply the same in their schools or do not even need to use English on a daily basis for anything.
---
Personally when i first started i could easily join one of the Italian servers since i was a university student in Italy, but i am thankful to have joined an English server because now i have friends from different countries in Europe which was great.
---
I still believe that even if there was a server with my native language available in wow i would still go for the English one so i can play with people that are from different countries.
---
You’re getting two completely different games mixed up. There’s a good probability that a lot of people who play and enjoy classic will never log into bfa servers.
---
How did you manage to get into 7 different layers? Did you have 7 different people who could invite you, or could literally you and one friend force yourself into new layers just by forming and breaking groups? 
---
By Blizzard's description of layering this is supposed to be impossible. Very disappointing - really starting to look like layering was completely made up and is simply another word for sharding...
---
Well from my experience from Belgian secondary schools, a lot of young people are still terrible at English as well. Doesn't help that they don't start teaching it till 13-14.
---
Yeah dude what I’m saying is if you look at the pictures at the higher level the damage numbers are less off. So the scaling maybe wrong but at the cap level (60) they may match. There’s no way to tell till 60 in classic is playable.
---
In summation they are 100% different at playable levels now but at level cap they may match which is where you’ll play most your time anyways.
---
ye that happened to me, well I dont see a problem in the age of google...plus you find out around lvl 15-20 so whatever
---
Playing with chinese people (a large part of this particular server) who didn't know a lick of english was a pain in the ass. Sheep moon? Entangling roots? Rez me? No response; no hope of communication. 
---
German and french items linked in chat, along with foreign dungeon/quest names, it's just a bad experience all around.
---
Yes but the problem is that the amount of German and French players is absolutely massive and a big portion of the EU community. If youre unlucky and end up on an unofficial German or French server they can easily become the majority of players overtime. Why would they speak English if theyre in the mjority, are not used to it and have no desire to? So youre stuck being unable to communicate with half the server and you already invested time into levelling there for X hours.
---
I think that speaks to how much they doubt it will be a success and it is more of a fan service. Will be interesting if Classic is a success and they change their stance.
---
They only thing they have to lose is infrastructure costs and microtransaction revenue. You dont have to pay anyone to develop new content.
---
I don't think is true. I think it's more along the lines of them seeing massive decline in current wow numbers and this is an attempt to reboot a game that a parent company has put on notice.
---
I told him about Anger Management.
---
Who gives a shit...
---
Yeah because they because super good dps once they got soulshatter. The ability to threat drop was huge for them. Combat wise you are still fine, just have to play it right because if you fear them first, followed by death coil. you will have to wait only like one or two more seconds before you can fear again. So it's not horrible just have to change how you pvp against undead.
---
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Maybe we both played different versions of classic this week, felt like classic to me.
---
I'm against spell batching being used on everything. Like flags in wsg. Should only be used with abilities and the window should definitely be shorter from what I've seen in the beta. Other than that no.
---
Actually staggering to think they had a ratio of 25,000 subs per server. I played on a Medium pop server and almost NEVER had queue times. Can't imagine how frustrating it must have been to be on Tichondrius or something else huge and sit in line for hours every night T.T
---
In the beta settings page it just asks you if you are interested in it. That doesn't determine your ability to play the game.
---
Same here. Played from AQ release up to Cata then stopped and only just now resubbed for classic release
---
The stress test was way fun to get back and see what the game was like again. Despite the layering issues and respawn timers I had fun just exploring and meeting some folks.
---
Good for them I guess, miss me with that shit.
---
Blizzard is just giving themselves the highest chance to have good beta testers. Randomly picking from people who opted in and not being subbed is a risk. They’re taking less of a risk by picking from the subbed population.
---
It isn’t any different than when they have MOP beta access with pre-purchase of the game. They’ve been doing this for years.
---
Nah fam. Spend the money on creating new Classic content instead.
---
It's OSRS all over again
---
I would agree with you if I couldn’t afk the same content in a matter of minutes that you spend hours trying to complete albeit lower difficulty. It’s still the same content. If I wanted to play a seasonal game I’d play a real seasonal game.
---
it's especially funny because a lot of europeans, well... hate it each other's guts. 
---
are you from [neighboring country]? well, you can go gargle some hedgehog sperm, you fucking [insert ethnic slur]. are you from [place two counties over]? yeah, you're probably alright.
---
remember, we spent the most part of the previous millennium killing each other, and not in the nice, american, "go over there and shoot some brown people" way. nah, europeans went full on rape, pillage and burn, not necessarily in that order.
---
so yeah, putting everyone into the same realms? bad fucking idea.
---
That and the shadow damage they stacked made shadowbolt hit like a truck.
---
The issue is if an undead rogue opens up on you and chain stuns you, you can't charm them to peel - so you have to trinket and use consumables, and even then they are still damaging you. It is pretty tricky.
---
This.  
---
19/11/21 is very popular.  
---
29/11/11 has also proven pretty strong, see Stormx' 3rd video for reference.
---
Take your time with it and enjoy the journey on your first go! Immerse yourself in the world and you'll love it!
---
There's a lot of profanities in that chat lol
---
Trust me, there is litery zero upside to play with people who speak language that you cant speak at all. Especially in WoW, that is so heavily community based. 
---
It may be fun for someone with A2 level and higher, but not A0-A1... Like A1 could be enough for games like Dota, Lol, Overwatch or CSGO, but not WoW.
---
You overestimate the level of English, that people have in other EU contries other than in Scandinavia region. And even there, judging by Kimi Räikkönen's level of English all is not that rosy :)
---
You're right, there are modifiers to abilities and/or classes on how much aggro they generate, either from talents or behind-the-scene passives.  For example, Rogues naturally generate less threat with all of their abilities(iirc).  Priest's Mind Blast spell has a +Aggro modifier on it.  You can talent a Mage's spells to have a -Aggro modifier.
---
The thresholds don't change, however.
---
Maybe NOW. But things are changing. The link I posted below [https://tech.slashdot.org/story/19/01/21/2256243/russia-tries-to-force-facebook-twitter-to-relocate-servers-to-russia](https://tech.slashdot.org/story/19/01/21/2256243/russia-tries-to-force-facebook-twitter-to-relocate-servers-to-russia) mentions Facebook and Twitter. Blizzard would be more likely to comply. Especially with any new servers or games. Technically, Classic is a new game.
---
You clearly don't know what you're talking about.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu-JMqNTn-M
---
I have well over 13 years of total subscription time for their game. Participated in previous betas, reported plethora of bugs through the years. 
---
Why did you assume, I'm not a loyal customer, based on my dislike of BfA?
---
&gt; Exactly you know what items you want because of their base value. So you might be really excited to get specific boots but oh you have completely different boots titanforged 
---
But then why would you want ***those/target*** those boots when you already have an upgrade? I'm just asking because I can't understand the mindset really.
---
Was this 'fixed' on pservers only though?
---
I.e., is the farm possible if the spawns are Blizzlike in Classic?
---
I mean, on one hand, yes.
---
On the other, there are people out there who would literally blow the devs for beta access, so...
---
It was Dave.
---
Or you know, I can just avoid playing with them by picking a server they aren’t on??
---
Portugal, caralho! To be fair even in the portuguese realm I see most people speaking english anyway. Afaik we're fine at english, but we're easy to spot because of the toxicity.
---
at least one PvE and one PvP
---
I understand that the individual RP communities are a concern because they are smaller but at least 2 servers per region should be easily doable
---
You will probably be arms or fury leveling and strapping on a shield so those dps can have the chance to win something in the dungeon, they don't really have a right to complain about an arms or fury warrior rolling on weapons imo.
---
I think they need to stop calling it a remake and just call it a remaster. They are updating graphics, UI, raid frames, using 1.12 talents and items. The list goes on and on. 
---
I don't think any of it in totally unacceptable but people seem to think they are getting a full recreation of vanilla wow. The expectations they are setting are a bit much imo.
---
Then I guess it all comes down to my 1st point no ?
---
If I take the example of Switzerland, on r/France you'll find french-speaking swiss who don't find the same amount of people sharing their interest for reddit among french-speakers of Switzerland, so they join a bigger community, that happens to exist for them in their native language, but if it did not exist in french, they'd join an English speaking community, or another non-native language for them, therefore the need for them to learn the language.
---
I don't know the point i'm trying to make is really clear tho
---
Cry more
---
Maybe you should actually read the comments instead of miscontruing everything as slurs.
---
No &gt;:(
---
&gt; Let me tell you one thing: the only thing that company's learn from and feel is when they get hit in their pockets.
---
This is precisely why I don't mind paying for classic. I am voting with my wallet: buying the product when they make the one I want. Boycotting Classic would only convince them that it wasn't worth making.
---
I'd like a classic sub which is cheaper. Cos they aren't using resources on the same scale as making new expacs at all.
---
Thanks! I am new to hunters and I think I gonna main one. Tyvm!
---
Yes, I was on a PvE server (Hyjal) then
---
Any dev/producer/executive that uses the word "Never"  doesn't know what they are talking about.
---
They work for a business, a business exists to make money.   If the best way to make money was to sodomise kittens, rest assured that's was business would do.
---
And the 64-bit client.  Don't forget that little part.
---
Meanwhile there are over 30 german retail servers.
---
I also think there is a rural-urban divide. My in-laws live in rural Germany and speaking English there certainly gets some looks that don’t happen as frequently in the more metropolitan areas. That being said, both my my wife’s parents hadn’t spoken English really since high school and we are able to communicate pretty well. That being said, they lived in West Germany and I’m sure rural former East Germany is a different story.
---
What is this douche bag’s issue? Trolling the community, and for what? I hope you find whatever it is you’re looking for in life, friend, because you have got to learn a better way to spend your time than this...
---
They should just IP ban anyone who isn't running the client on Windows XP. And if you're running an Nvidia card, it better not be anything newer than a GeForce 8 series. No changes!!!
---
Classic is too big to fail.
---
I don't understand what we're looking at. Are you saying that this big horde group was approaching the large alliance group, and right before they ran into each other, the horde players got shifted to another layer?
---
Are you just pointing out that this many players all managed to get onto the same layer? 
---
Needs a little more context, not sure if I'm supposed to have a pitchfork out or not
---
If the TF they are an upgrade so you would hope that they drop dont you?
---
That's why I proposed my idea. It's community feedback. Since most people only seem to want layering 1-20 zones I gave my idea as to how to do that since most people think it's not possible without sharding.
---
So essential half the player base literally never has it.
---
I did read, and agree with, the comment. That doesn’t stop me from calling that word a slur.
---
I wish you were my mom... jk, lol. You sound awesome!
---
Top. One Reason more for German Servers.
---
If you are an English speaker posting in a Spanish server you would also not be respecting the server language. You are expected to speak the language of the server
---
Yeah I meant modifier mostly on that 110% but really, so if you were a priest stood on top of the mob you'd be fine at 120 unless you whacked him with your mallet etc (not the case just an example!)
---
to be honest I dont care much about that. what really bothers me is that russians by and large dont speak a single word of english. and I don't give a fuck where you come from, if you play on an english server, you talk english or get the hell off my server.
---
Nostralia (Aus private server) managed to have a big enough population to sustain itself for the most part (2 raiding guilds per faction). So I think one Oceanic server should easily maintain a healthy population given the refugees from retail and the people from Aus/NZ that played on the US/EU private servers too.
---
If you're only source of gear is lfr loot then you are rolling around in the equivalent of greens. People know the difference. Easy sure but its garbage.
---
Somone said that the biggest Part of eu players for wow is german, 2nd is france and 3rd italian, we should at least get a server for these and a few mixed servers so people can choose where to play. 
---
For example if you are polish but you know a little german you can roll there, and you CHOOSE to do so
---
You do like 1 dungeon for 5 levels... thats better than going to every zone for a average of 1 to 2 levels...
---
It's not about ability of speaking english, it's about willingness.
---
It went super slow once like laggy picture rolling clip like for about 45 seconds as we approached the wall of alliance, then it stopped and battle began.
---
Sorry man, but the fact that people still actually think the majority of players of any game come to reddit/twitch/YouTube is funny. It's been proven many times it's the minority. Theres a huge population that won't ever see it until it's in game. Not that I think it's an issue.
---
You can manually flag yourself by typing /pvp in chat.
---
This is reddit, not the official blizzard  forums, but yeah.
---
They are. Just found it funny because I had only just seen the battlestation.
---
I dont think they are going to lose subs over Classic. I almost want to say that a good chunk of the players will be newer generation players who will hate it, say it sucks, and go back to BFA. I saw that a lot during the stress test in chat.
---
If anything, I think Classic allows them to tap into revenue from players that dont like the current version of WoW. I am one of those.
---
Maybe they will add more servers if the game demonstrates it has a healthy community. I think Blizzard doubts its success and is only doing this as a fan service.
---
That’s awesome... did you print it?
---
I don't except a TF no. Like I don't except to win the lotto or hope the McDonald cashier gets my order wrong and gives me an extra chicken nugget like last time.
---
Ok the game should be designed around your specific example. Fuck everyone else u/Tymkie wants to play with every language, should probably merge with Chinese and Russian servers too so I can play with my global friends 
---
Well, apparently they are not represented enough since blizzard decided not to create servers for them. Thats the thing. Where do you draw the line? 3 languages, 5? They did at one.
---
It's not bizarre--basically, the name of the item comes *with* the link along with the item id. An item link looks something like |hfff315312|[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeler]|r. There's a color code, an item id, and a name. When you click on an item, your game client grabs the item id and then shows you everything it finds about the item.
---
But Blizzard doesn't want the client to constantly scan and rescan the data whenever it encounters an id. So that's why you can only have one item 'clicked' at a time. The item link comes with a name and a color so that a lot of people linking a lot of items don't suddenly cause people's clients to crash.
---
This is also why in early wow you were able to fake quest/item/etc links but when you click on them you see the real name/etc.
---
Spin it however you like it, fact is it's a scummy tactic, and you're a shill who doesn't have a leg to stand on anymore.
---
That's Strength of the Treant. Much higher top end dmg and dps than Illusionary Rod.
---
Warriors, how did you deal with mages 1v1 in world pvp?  Is luck+engineering+bad play by the mage the only way to win?  Or I guess since this is the mage thread, mages - how did warriors beat you 1v1, if they ever did?
---
No that wasn't your point at all. You're point was "he was right when he said 'you think you do, but you don't'" which I strongly disagree with. The people who wants these changes never "thought they did" want authentic vanilla in the first place.
---
Well no, the Priest is in melee range.  Doing anything that generates aggro which puts him at 110% of the tank will cause the boss to target him.  It's all about positioning.
---
That's the one! Sucked to set up initially but was awesome once you did.
---
It was laggy like a slideslow for no longer than a minute when players were at their peaks as we approached the alliance group, then lag stopped and we began the slaughter.
---
Beat me to it.
---
So no question ? Nice.
---
We should reunite french and german in one realm as alliance and horde and see what happen...
---
Peace of course
---
Most only see the leveling experience once. Why ruin that by layering the entire game for months? A solution is what we need right now.
---
What are you on about? I literally spent my teenage years playing way too much vanilla wow, the stress test I experienced this week felt just like the game I played back then.
---
Exactly. The most spoken languages in Europe has a lot of people that simply don't know/dont want to speak English and have always formed their own communities either within a server or on their own separate servers. 
---
They have the population and numbers to historically keep healthy populations on their separate realms. Why can't Classic offer that option? When a big chunk of the EU speak French/German/Spanish I think we'll do everyone a favour to give them separate realms.
---
This will really hurt the server communities for EU. It might even deter people from playing altogether considering how large of a time investment Classic will be.
---
could you establish a pattern - e.g. all mobs in this zone had short ranges, or all mobs 1 lvl below you did, or?
---
i would think you could sample and document mob/level/ur level/zone/type mob, then 1) see if a pattern presented itself and 2) then wait for a server reset and test again to see if it is consistent.
---
SoMe mEn jUsT wAnT tO wAtCh tHe wOrLd bUrN
---
Sounds fake, i dont see Turkish arab or Swahili so its not europe
---
&gt;Anyone that rolls on those servers without prior knowledge of the situation will be stranded on a server where the majority of people won't communicate in English
---
This is the peoblem summed up well.
---
&gt;Here's the problem I see, and it's why the people saying "only a few weeks", "just to make the starting zones playable" and "to avoid queue times" are telling at least one lie.
---
Yeah, and it's the last one.
---
No one from Blizzard ever said layering is to avoid queue times. Actually, layering doesn't even do anything to prevent queue times to begin with. You don't get queue times because a particular zone is congested; you get queue times because the login/character server is congested.
---
Nah, Blizzard is doing it right. A populated server with different national guilds is much better than a dead national server.
---
What canvas printing place did you use?
---
Decursive
---
You are thinking small time and Britain isn’t going anywhere in any way significantly. Whether 25 years from now or 100 the EU will continue to strengthen together. That’s as much as I care to say on the matter.
---
Play mage, you don't have to AOE grind.  Mages are still solid levelers and good gold farmers without AOE methods.  Sure it's better, but you don't have to do it.
---
Alright thanks for the reply.
---
The best part is you cant see the tons of people to the left right and behind my character in this pic. This S/c barely does the sheer volume of players justice!
---
OSRS is a bad example, which has been pointed out by several people in several threads because of many business/finance reasons. I’ll just say you should consider the game, quality of game, and number of players involved in both games. It’s a different ballpark. 
---
If you want 2 large reasons, look up and read my other replies. Running a company isn’t as simple as listening to the consumer because, usually, the consumer doesn’t understand. Decisions can have massive consequences if not carried out properly. Classic WoW is one of those decisions. 
---
Also, your “100% certain” is an odd claim. How are you so sure? Do you get this from the dev that said “I don’t know” or the CEO who said “Never”? Nothing else has been said on the matter.
---
Or you buy a realm transfer. *Poke head*
---
Smart Blizzard is smart.
---
You didn’t hear?? They released it early
---
The point is that pretty much everyone without higher eduction in EU countries can't speak proper english and won't be able to communicate. Here in Switzerland thats ~50% of the population.
---
I mean pretty much the whole reason they re-released Naxx wass because only like 1% of the playerbase even zoned into it in vanilla right? So I think they were going for 'tourist' version
---
I feel like this post itself should be included, theres a dozen of these aswell
---
The word was generally FFA, or free-for-all.
---
Yes, Germany, France, Spain, Italia, UK (of course) have enough players to fill at least 2 servers on each country, it's not about players.
---
So it's about Blizzard, costs, profit, short term vision...
---
check out the Danish translation for Dota 2, it's hilariously bad
---
Of course there are and on every server, but some random jerk doesn't really have the same kind of impact as a major streamer dude. It's not even in the same ballpark.
---
Pm me too please :D
---
I was thinking creating similar post for few days - let's not turn into /r/got/ where everyone just post fan art &amp; theme cakes.
---
I think it's going to be more common than you think. You can't underestimate how different it's going to be compared to the original run of the game.
---
Everyone has perfect knowledge of everything. Every single orifice of the game has been probed and explored. We know the best strategies, the best specs, the best gear to shoot for, the most efficient ways to level, the classes/specs that never worked around. 
---
Faster computers, better network connections, modern mods, etc. are going to speed up the pace of raid progression dramatically. It will not be long before people having each phase's content on farm. That's just more time for more loot to drop for more people.
---
It's reasonable to assume that classic will just sit there as-is for at least 10 years after launch. MC -&gt; Naxx for 10 years = pretty much anyone who's interested getting pretty much anything they're shooting for. It's just a numbers game. Anyone who sticks with it is going to get the loot they want.
---
Create a group, then create a raid, then leave that group create new raid group and keep inviting pm's, guildies, etc. until you have 5 or so full raid groups on one screen ;)
---
There's another one to add 
---
"You forgot a minor detail of the game? You clearly didn't play vanilla"
---
Or if you don't like something someone else did. Everyone I knew hated long AV matches, so all my vanilla memories were apparently implanted or something.
---
Haha I love this every time I read it xD Literally every 2nd "Layering is bad" post doesn't know what he/she/it is talking about....
---
I liked your comparison :)
---
Yeah I wish they would do say a slightly higher both sub, and a lower classic only sub.
---
But what you said makes a lot of sense and they absolutely are looking to cash in as much as possible.
---
Ya, layering is only to reduce costs.
---
WHY THE FUCK CANT I LOGIN ITS BEEN 6 DAYS SINCE CLASSIC RELEASED 
---
-op without layering
---
I would if I had beta access, so I'm limited to 1-15 content on the stress test. Not even sure when that ends. I'm guessing soon. And I'm limited with time because of work.
---
All the issues I've reported thus far were just me playing these 2 days on the stress test. I wish I had beta access I would've tested so much.
---
Someone with beta access has to do what you said though I agree.
---
Feedback greatly appreciated! Also, which duo combination do you prefer &amp; why? 😊
---
To much hair.
---
I can't help but feel I accidentally fed a troll,
---
The paladin priest comparisons you are making just makes me think you.. eh y'know what the effort required to defend myself to you isn't worth the reward of your approval so I'll just walk away. We disagree.
---
You shouldn't have cared to share your ignorant opinion in the first place. Do you realize how insane it is for you to try to speak on this? You visited Europe once. The UK has made the resolution to leave, Theresa May is being replaced for not managing to leave the EU thus far and her replacements are not remainers. The EU is in a crisis right now, the biggest one since it's inception. 
---
Your arrogance is astounding.
---
Also partially because streamers especially asmon always talk about and I quote "people on reddit are retarded." So his fans dont want anything to do with that. A lot of streamers just dislike reddit because a lot of redditers dislike them and call them out on bs
---
&gt;I’m wondering about other things, such as auto-loot, insta-mined ore nodes, multiple attachment mail, etc.
---
Auto-loot has always been in, just you had to hit a key modifier before clicking(usually SHIFT).  No insta-mine or herb picking.  Not sure about mail attachments or right-click reporting.
---
Classic is running on the modern engine, code, and services from Legion/BfA, but being hacked to operate and appear as close to 1.12 Vanilla as possible so as far as I know, yes, addons are written for the modern game then modified to work for Classic.
---
Hey mate! Thank you for the information. I was simply not aware that this was the case, so pardon my ignorance. Living in a country where everyone learns English as their second language, for no other reason then "that it makes sense", has made me oblivious of the fact that others do not. My bad. 
---
Question tho. During the last 3-4 years where classic p-servers was at its height, for me at least international servers didn't seem to be a problem, as most folks was able to make themselves understood. Do you, or anyone here, know how the p-servers experience was for the players from french/spanish/german community?
---
But what if there won't be enough servers to house all the major languages?
---
That's exactly the problem.
---
Private servers do not follow the classic rules though. Alot of stuff have altered drop rate and buffed/nerfed raids
---
Pm me too please!  ty!
---
I no speak englando my amigo
---
Why would it be around yourself instead ? Like thats a silly example. I created the situation only to show you the situation from the different point of view. It is pretty drastic example but i've dead about it on reddit. Thats the thing. Not everyone will be happy with your German and French servers. But the more i discuss this topic the more i think you should actually go to your own servers since you're capable of discussion.
---
Pm me too please! ty!
---
big fat “F” for graphic design
---
On one hand, I breath a sigh of relief that I'm in Europe where this streamer / Twitch chat culture is basically nonexistent (at least I've never seen a streamer or POG mentioned in my server in its entire history). But on the other hand... international servers... I think I'll take the streamers over watching the Polish and French duke it out in Trade chat again.
---
Based on??
---
Wow 2 never gonna happen....wow 1.5 though? Lol
---
Can’t have any bugs, if you haven’t written any code...
---
Needless to say it's great you enjoyed the "Learning &amp; Helping Language Barrier Simulator". It's great that you've had that experience. Now let's be an advocate for freedom and allow others to play classic without handicaps if they wish to do so.
---
Whatever you say. Im in the beta and you are not ;)
---
US Stress Test ending today.
---
I dunno, I reckon there are a few thousand people under my rock with me then, I've been checking this daily and it's the first time I've noticed it?
---
Agreed there’s only so much you can do, plus when I’m away for trips I can get rested xp and make up the time..no point in canceling all plans
---
Nothing, they are all in the EU. 
---
Deal with it.
---
Warriors would beat me as a mage if they had better gear and timely use of intimidating shout.
---
Yeah the best vanilla druids used every form in a fight
---
Yeah, they also said it would only be the initial zones and initial few weeks, funny how things can change fast.
---
Lmao what? Are you trying to imply that Blizzard had some kind of benevolent “one race, one people” mentality when making this decision? That’s most definitely not the case, they very obviously simply do not think the ROI of having dedicated foreign language is worth it to justify the cost. Unless a massive number of each language group that wants their own server lets Blizzard know they exist and want that they have to settle for essentially being second class players in Blizz’s eyes.
---
Plus, the issue people have is the potential difficulty with communication and inevitable fracturing of communities, not cultural intolerance. People aren’t upset because they have to play with people they don’t know from places they’ve never been, they’re upset because they might unknowingly find themselves on a server where they can not communicate effectively with a majority of the servers population.
---
Meh, I can understand that one. I think the push should be to make it less exploitable rather than eliminated, though, as I think that is more likely to happen
---
Whenever i travel to another country i just learn some common words that i know i will use. It's considered polite to at least try and people will appreciate your effort. Or you could be an entitled asshole and not even try, which will lead to locals not trying with english.
---
You’re telling me France, Germany, and Spain aren’t the only countries in Europe?
---
You’re right, I didn’t realize that.
---
[/r/woosh](https://www.reddit.com/r/woosh/)
---
Just sucks to level a character to 60 and then realize that your realm actually became french.
---
all it needs is "kurwa"
---
Same. If they kept it to that, I would have absolutely nothing bad to say about layering.
---
I only have an EU account.
---
Yeah I agree with you, there is definitely application integration.  My original post to the OP was more implying that I don't think it's super easy to just layer specific zones like everyone seems to be asking for.   I was implying that each node might not really know too much about the user connection itself but instead the users are just being directed to the nodes based on the server load.  You're right that there's way more going on due to the users changing nodes based on party group-up's and other things.  
---
And maybe the application is more aware of each connection it is handling than I think it is aware of.  It seems difficult, to me, for them to just "turn off" layering when a character enters a certain zone.  But perhaps the application itself can basically flag a user/character from swapping nodes if some specific criteria is met, but I just don't know how easy that will be (I don't think it will be easy).
---
For a bunch of dwarves.
---
The people in those threads are either idiots or trolls, ignore them.
---
Anyone not in a top 100 world guild is a terrible player.
---
As someone who played in a top 100 world guild, I was also a terrible player. As were most people I raided with.
---
Rest assured, there are two kinds of players: terrible players, and terrible players who end up playing even worse because they think they're hot shit.
---
&gt;So if those are just tiny communities (as you've called it), why should Blizzard even care then, if the majority hasn't a problem with English?
---
You've got to consider that private servers always had a rather large barrier of entry for many people to begin with (shady admins, progress of years can be lost at the drop of a hat, for example) so an additional language hurdle naturally scares off even more folks - leading to even smaller communities.
---
&gt; So far, it was just French, German, Italian, Spanish and Russian speakers that had their own servers...I never heard of anyone from Greece, Finland, Scotland (kek) or Slowakia complain about that they don't have language specific servers...they just got along with English servers, although folks from the east might even have a harder time communicating in English than Germans for example.
---
As other people already pointed out the language might not be a problem for most people here, but the overall population sure as hell isn't all that confident in their English language skills if they even speak the language at all. 
---
I can't specifically speak for the Spanish side of things, but in France and Germany (as you should know) almost everything gets dubbed. There is simply no need to learn English unless it has some relevance to your job. 
---
Movies with the original English voice lines were until recently even hard to come by and for almost everything on the internet there's some kind of alternative in their language (though I personally think that the internet without English is a rather bleak experience).
---
As for other languages not asking for their own servers: 
---
It's mostly because it always was like that for them in regards to WoW. 
---
They only ever had the choice between rolling on servers for other languages or to not play at all. 
---
The ones that are now complaining have had their servers for almost 15 years though and a project that aims to recreate the Vanilla experience would be lacking without that same language for those people.
---
It would be different if this was a brand new game and there never was an alternative, but that simply isn't how it is... and before you ask: 
---
Yes, I obviously would also be in favour of other languages getting their own server if the communities want that.
---
&gt;well, you can go gargle some hedgehog sperm
---
*My insults database has been updated.*
---
its in beta and development, thats the most youre going to get. wether or not the playerbase accepts that or not, layering will happen and theyre not going to break down every aspect of a temporary system that is planned to be removed in like 3 weeks after launch
---
Really depends on the population of classic really. But likely yeah battleground will be better.
---
Some of the studies on concurrent pserver players are mental. So many. I think blizzard might be very surprised seeing as they think it's gonna fail hard.
---
I kinda hate talking danish in wow anyway. I remember several times back in TBC I would be asked which country I was from, and as soon as I said "DK", the conversation would now be danish. I ended up just lying or never saying in fear of a danish person being behind that question.
---
haha Blizzard has NO confidence in this game's long term viability. They're just assuming the realms are going to be dead in like 6 months. It'll be interesting to see whether they were right.
---
I agree with you, I am just saying its not just 1 server per language like outlined in the OP
---
Yeah but if you're constantly moving and killing the overall speed can be much better than trying and failing to snag kills in a group of 5.
---
And her chosen warriors, the Death Hunters.  Wielding Rune Covered Glaives, these grim warriors turn the power of Fel Necromancy back on the Legion, reanimating fallen demons to serve them.
---
Imagine thinking about taking a cut from Ooga guys and pretending you are one of them and recruit others to your noob-retail-pvs guild. You must be fun at parties.
---
I tanked rfc last night and I saw trade chat being spammed looking for tanks healers for rfc. I did a /who wailing caverns and it was full of level 15s so whatever server I was on it was great.
---
I mean, on the US region it was allowed (or if there was a restriction then it wasn't enforced) for people to speak portuguese and spanish, since dedicated latino and brazilian realms were made on 2008 and 2011 respectively. I can't see Blizzard taking any action against people who speak other languages on these realms this time around.
---
Also, if they denied language specific realms to EU, I see no reason for them to not deny them for US. I fully expect to share the realm with people who don't speak english.
---
PS: I fail to see why that's a problem though, and why you would want to avoid such a realm.
---
Well that might be due to the fact that you were on a Server that wasn't just German? People know each other on German Servers and when I Play retail every month and then I usually see People talking too :3 
---
Different experiences for everyone - but I can still see People wanting their native language spoken. Which won't be possible now. 
---
And the Argument that there usually are no language specific Servers in other games just makes their Argument for wow bigger. 
---
Why do you think they stuck to wow? Maybe because of the community? Of the German Servers? Because they actually know each other...
---
You probably can't get it if you haven't experienced it but whatever...
---
I don't really care either tbh I've been playing english Servers since Wotlk xD
---
Mak'Gora
---
This is the classic experience from your point of view. It's the absolute opposite for German and French. So big disappointment for us.
---
You don't have to reach 60 to still play the game. And in any case, 30% is actually higher than I anticipated for private servers. It'll be much higher in classic since people won't be concerned about their character suddenly being deleted.
---
Charging people to show them is a brilliant idea. I should have tried that haha. Maybe I'll try in classic. The Caverns of Time was another fun one I explored too! Thanks for the reminder :D
---
So you didn't even bother to Google water in french. And you are complaining that locals don't bother with english.
---
What the population of your server? 
---
If you say it's the biggst I imagine it being above 3-4k which will be the population of a classic server after layering has been shut down (phase 2). If your max population is double than that, It doubles your chances finding a guild with your languages + fitting raid times.
---
I have a lot of friends who are not able to speak/write or even read english. Overall it's teached in school yes, but that doesn't mean everybody is good at it. Last time i showed my GF an english song she liked, we spent like 30 min translating and explaning the 3 min song
---
I think everyone is ballparking/guessing. I havent seen any official numbers. His dont seem to absurd to me if I'm being honest
---
I was under the impression that the US stress test was the beta client not the actual client?
---
Good. Hopefully that forces the few weird danish people who can't read or write english very well to learn.
---
I dont agree. I think many difficulties make you want to get better. I've met a lot of people raiding normal and heroic and they joined my guild. After a few raids id say they were pretty average/bad. One of them become my friend and we discussed the game a lot and  he actually become very good. We were doing Keys and raids and joined the cutting edge guild, one of the top on our realm. I never would have guessed he had it in him to become a mythic raider. But with he never wanted to stay behind.
---
First, wow is not like 'most multiplayer games' for a load of reasons. And Second, I can get a bad clone of wow vanilla on private servers. Neither you nor I can speak for the community but I know I was looking forward to vanilla 2.0 and that is not what Activision blizzard wants to give is, so I won't play. Period.
---
I guess, I personally prefer layering, but hard sharding for 30% isn't a total negative either. However with how this sub goes on it seems they'd rather have 100% lag and weeks leveling to level 10
---
It's too fucking early for me to be reasoning through that mess
---
It's in the title
---
^this
---
So many people try to compare this situation to the original release while it doesn't make any sense to do so.
---
Finite sized servers where you repeatably run into recognize people crate communities. 
---
Infinite anonymous players might as well be NPC’s you don’t have meaningful interaction with them.
---
Even a large group of persons who speak a different language and knit together help foster your community creating a them for your us. 
---
Current WoW might as well be a single player game Were I sometimes log in a shared game with an IRL mate.
---
The current LFG System where you’ll never meet your team mates again means they might as well be NPC’s
---
I just started to type: There won't be any Aussie servers anyway.. xD
---
&gt;  Blizzard can't possibly be so dumb as to think there won't be 3k German players or 3k French players. 
---
Actually, they are that dumb.
---
But they will reverse everything on August 13th, when millions will resub to WoW for the Classic reserve name option.
---
Gonna be fun to see them Blizzard update the realm list with 10 times more realms than they expected.
---
That statement was made to address:
---
&gt;And come on, do you honestly believe 8 year olds watch a 30 year old boomer complain about bfa and play classic wow ? They are much more drawn to high action games like Fortnite
---
As I find that equally unlikely as someone who was old enough to have played Vanilla to enjoy his content.
---
What a troll.
---
I had a great time on the stress test. 
---
I leveled my warrior and tanked rfc, grouped for quests. 
---
Felt like vanilla to me. 
---
I'm looking forward to classic launch. 
---
I feel sorry for you that you cant enjoy classic like the rest of us.
---
Cry more snowflake ❄️ the EU isn’t going anywhere
---
It's just europeans dicking eachother. That's what we do. It's about as civil as your grandmother saying "that's good dear"
---
Maybe OP was referring to aggro range? That is the only other thing I can think of.
---
we read many good (or just better) solutions on reddit that blizzard couldn't think of ? let's not be naive, they choose it on purpose, so question is why ? maybe they are afraid that classic would bring too more people and put bfa in the dark, maybe this, or something else...

they already have server here for retail. Wouldn't really be a reason not to add them for classic.

GO FIX YOUR STUFF! :D

Haha that's so crazy! it's the same for me. :) after that i started asking where the majority of people were from in the guild and if they were Danes i'd find another guild because i really don't want to talk Danish while playing.

He didn't, this is a non descript cropped photo. Most likely from a streamer who had an entire twitch chat following him so they could force layers. Your average Joe will not have this ability.
---
My dad and his friend are coming back to play Classic WoW. My partner is going to play. 3 people who haven’t played the game in 10+ years; Blizz don’t realise how fucking huge this release is going to be.
---
Once Blizzard releases the official server lists, it might be possible to already in the forums and here on Reddit to align with the community on which servers the community here will play? So we can ensure there will be many English speakers at the start? 
---
That or.. maybe somebody can spy in some Russian, German, French communities to figure out which servers will become "theirs". ;)
---
I'm not saying this is how it has to be, it's sucks ofc, but you need to make to with what you get I guess...
---
No. You are level 60 and kill level 60's that want to gank low lvls...
---
Love blocking people like you. It is like taking a huge dump in the morning. You walk away feeling lighter and smiling knowing you just flushed away a big fat turd!
---
Aside being absurdly strong for a belt, yes.  
---
The idea is also to add this gear but not introduce more powercreep.  Items should never be on the same level or beyond that of Naxx. Naxx is already too fucking strong and breaks the game horribly. Add this variation for gear without the powercreep.
---
I really, really, really hope that as the launch approaches people make an effort to establish these servers as early as possible. Once we get a dedicated servers list I don’t see a reason why that couldn’t happen.
---
Poe's Law?
---
Holy s***. It’s a big world out there! 😂
---
I’m from Texas, can confirm we think we are the only state. Mainly because you drive for hours and can’t find your way out.
---
warlock's spellstone when used does not remove magic debuffs such as pain.
---
But without layering the game is literally unplayable! /s
---
Just force players into layer 1 after they reach level 25 and give a +/- leeway of about 5 levels for groups
---
I mean they can doubt that it will be successful, but then establishing multinational realms contributes to classic being unsuccessful again. Its a self fulfilling prophecy, since many people cancelled sub already and told they'll skip classic because of that.

This is really amazing, I was thinking of doing it and you just convinced me 100%. I will also keep the record of the dimensions you gave in a comment  127x57 cm .

---
Horde has a harder time getting owls anyway. Personally I think carrion birds are underrated pets and look cooler.

I mean isn’t that how Ragnaros works in US?
---
Last year, I studied a semester in Italy. The only people who could actually speak English were the Greek students, and students from native English countries.. Neither Italian nor Spanish students could speak any English...
---
the french language never uses the letter t? what are you on about? you're completely making that up.
---
Eh not such a bad idea If the french play alliance and the german horde.
---
Just rename some BG's to Saarland and Elsaß-Lothringen, for the most authentic expirience.
---
Any pc will do
---
Wow hilarious
---
I'm pretty sure, client are already localized. During the first stress test, I was playing with my french client and had no problem what so ever with quest and monster.
---
Same for the handfull of french streamer with access. Their client are in french.
---
As for the problem of server price and location, retail central eu server are already in Paris and Frankfurt IIRC.
---
They comprehend. They don't trust and are looking down the slippery slope fallacy.
---
It makes me think of when they banned Speedy Gonzales cartoons because they were afraid it would offend Hispanics. Then the Hispanics got pissed off because they love Speedy Gonzales and wanted him back.
---
That's what she said.
---
I'm ready to bet they already got stats for all known pservers.
---
If they don't they're morons !
---
pservers stats are the only way to measure the hardcore vanilla fans pop that will remain when retail players will have left.
---
Stop virtue signaling; it’s pathetic.
---
Isn't Earth itself technically the world's biggest rock?
---
Paladins are alliances main strength, both in PvP and pve, the main reason to go alliance is aesthetics , lore and questing zones, and cities (appearance and locations).
---
If all you want it purely Min max race class for PvP yeah go horde.
---
My biggest recommendation is throw that approach out the damn window after setting it on fire though. Vanilla was not designed around requiring perfect knowledge and comps and perfect play. It's way more RPG based and community fun.
---
Imagine thinking that a game people played for years  is "literally unplayable" if it doesn't have a new technology developed in 2019 included. JFC
---
I was there 15 year ago without layering. It was nothing like you are describing. If you picked a  overpopulated server you knew that meant possible queues.
---
Its the only good way to do it. Layering will be a failure, no doubt.
---
English servers had this policy of only allowing English in official chat channels. It was sometimes enforced.
---
If you're using another language you're not "somehow being disrespectful". You are actually and technically disrespecting server rules. That is the definition of disrespect.
---
I don't know if those rules are going to exist or be enforced this time around.
---
How is that arrogant? You're the one being arrogant here.

If you want to immerse yourself in foreign culture, try to speak their language, that's fine. It can be a great experience! That's not the only way to go about traveling though. 
---
Refusing to communicate with foreigners becouse 'it's France, speak French to the waiter' is ridiculous.
---
Especially regarding the anecdote you're responding to, becouse anyone with a brain could've understood that. That's just rude. Not everyone wants to learn French. Some of those people want to visit France anyway. English is the western world's 'common'. Stop being such a snowflake about it. 
---
I live in Poland. There's an amazing Indian restaurant near my place. Nobody in the staff speaks Polish. 
---
Waiters speak English. If somebody doesn't speak English, they can just point at the menu, use some English words they know, use body language. 
---
Zero issues. They serve amazing food. 
---
I'd like to see that happen in France. And that's the kind of wholesome multicultural experience you miss out on when you just REFUSE to speak anything but your native tounge in your country to god damn tourists.
---
Yeah I agree
---
I went and found 2 more people already, sorry man. We are pretty stoked to try this out though.
---
I've been playing since WotLK , and I feel the issue being more linked to M+ rather than TF/WF tbh, because it's so easy to get heroic level raid gear  with more chances aswell that you can only really get an upgrade from mythic which isn't a cakewalk so it makes it even harder to get upgrades because you actually need to down bosses lol so when things TF and you struggling with mythic and the bosses loot table are all downgrades either because of bad stats and/or you got a higher tf version you it feels kinda bad, however you wouldn't get this experience if you couldn't fully deck yourself out with 400 pieces so quickly and a 415 is replacing your 385 piece. M+ is great though, but the amount of gear it gives you is problem.
---
It's a dangerous business, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to
---
Giving credit on 15years old macro, but ok, better than nothing.
---
Goodluck with /petmoveto on classic.
---
And to stick with topic, i use weapon swaps all the time for healing vs damage spells /equip /equipslot
---
No thanks. Don't want to be locked in a server with frenchies or dutchies. I want my games in english.
---
NICE!”
---
They can't pronounce it or find it difficult.
---
This is exactly what happens on pservers.
---
Congrats on getting away from a toxic workplace, especially for a much better job!! Wishing you the best with the new role and in your speed run!
---
So jealous of having the vacation days to take that time off! I will be living vicariously through your week of running and looking forward to hearing how it went.
---
I'd say give layer transfers an infinite cooldown. Keep the layers completely and totally separate until the merge. A 10 minute cooldown doesn't solve much.
---
Agree.  I’m aiming for 60-90 real life days.  Leveling professions.  I honestly thing the majority of the people talking about 1-2 week leveling actually played wow back in 2004.
---
THE POINT IS that this can also be abused for mining/herbs, Black Lotus, Devilssaurs, AOE farming etc etc. People will reach 60 withing a week and start doing this. They will have a bunch of lvl 1 alts on different layers to help them jump layers.

I think most people here get why the early levels, especially 1-10, have a massive bottleneck that needs help for the population to... digest. Hell, Blizzards original plan was to just shard starting zones, which I was 100% down with, even if I was adamant it would only be 1–10, not 10-20. 
---
But now, I’d be happy to make the concession where we get the early game bottleneck handled in some server fuckery way for even the first 30 levels, so long as 30-60 is just one *world* of Warcraft. 
---
I have my doubts that Blizzard would ever entertain a compromise like that, and the recent EU servers post only digs that thought in further. They really don’t want to have too many servers, and I fear that they will instead have way too few. So they stick 15-20K people on every server, projected to split into 10 layers... And then there’s still 10k people trying to access WoW 2 weeks after launch. There’s no way they could cut off 30-60 and shard the rest, even after two weeks, if tbose are the metrics they are dealt.
---
My plan is to go skinning/mining while leveling. At Max level, drop skinning for tailoring. I'll keep tailoring until I can get robes of the archmage then drop it for engineering. So end up with mining/engineering.
---
rested exp only works for a level and a half tho
---
What? I can't tell if troll or serious?
---
Tbh, the easiest fix for the time being isn't more hardware. It's to have a checkbox when you first login to ask what languages you speak/are willing to speak (With an option in settings somewhere to change it whenever a player wishes)
---
Upon choosing say Polish as your main language your /1 general becomes the Polish version, you can still access the English general through /5 or whatever the first unused number would be but your /1 would be your nationalities language. It doesn't solve all of the issues but it's completely free for Blizzard to implement, helps build communities without taking away from the realm community and if down the line Classic blows up and they have 1 million+ concurrent users then they can add realms as it's needed.
---
Plot twist: What if all this language controversy is only meant to distract you from the fact that layering will ruin the game for as long as it's there.
---
After I watched Asmon's reaction to the '10 reasons to avoid streamer servers', I have concluded he is mostly just a rage-filled wombat
---
Can you expand on the Druid talent change? What's being rolled into the Class Abilities from the talent trees?
---
Same - and now Private servers will have correct values which is great!
---
I work in the recruitment section of my company. My job is to post advertisments and filter candidates for the review board. I do not chase and do not have to chase for the roles I recruit for.
---
late in tbc they added a ui element below your player frame with a slot for each totem type with duration (it also let you kill the totem, which you can't do in vanilla).  the weakaura would essentially be the same thing, just customizable and no kill option.   
---
i don't know if anyone has made one yet or if it's even possible, though i don't see how it wouldn't be since you're just reading the combat log for a totem to drop
---
Only if they allow free transfers to the new realms. It isn't a good idea if people have to reroll.
---
Finally somebody fucking said it.
---
It was known back in Vanilla. Still not enough rage.
---
Not enough for me ;-)
---
It could be any other game I would be ok with no french servers. But it's WoW. French realm are a thing in retail since day 1. So I want it back in WoW Classic
---
Melee has a longer range than frost nova. People don't understand how bad leeway is on the beta. Watching back peddling become the meta in dead-zone kiting is really sad.
---
Never played PVE for Long - I remember I rolled on a PVE Server once but only made it to 42 on my Mage... I did miss that Feeling of danger at all times. Will there be a Rouge Backstabbing me any second now?! I Need that Feeling xD
---
Serious question, has there ever been language specific servers? I thought it was just all EU with lore specific names and yall sorted it out yourselves. What's the problem here.
---
Unless you are extremely experienced or follow a leveling guide very strictly, i think the 10 days /played is a very good approximation
---
&gt; So I can appreciate that it's a fancy new piece of back-end tech
---
It's really not new at all. Layering *is* sharding, just configured for the entire world.
---
Emphasis on *planned*
---
Personally, I really hope that they make a separate language server for Alabama hill people and Texan trailer folk to flourish on.  It's just not fair.
---
When you're packed to the gills with people in the starting zone fighting for mobs - that's Vanilla. Not dynamic respawns.
---
You want that to back to pservers.
---
This was mainly because they had no matching clients, too. Still there were German and French servers from the start and Russian soon

---
&gt;It's likely that updating the vanilla server code to be able to instantiate the entire continent was much more strait forward than figuring out how to break apart each individual zone and instantiating those.
---
Correct me if i'm wrong but it sounds like what you just described is  how sharding works currently in retail. The only two main differences between layering and sharding is that sharding is dynamic (you don't need to trigger it yourself via grouping/relogging) and that each shard doesn't neccesarrily have to be the entire continent, it can be zones, or even parts of a zone.
---
Im also pretty sure that the DATA comes from vanilla 1.12 and before, but the server code itself will almost certainly be the modern code seeing as the client is basdically the modern version also. Blizzard wants the old data, but all the updated features and security the modern code brings to the table.
---
Your assumption that blizzard would have to put development time into layering zones instead of the continent is (in my opinion) comepletely wrong. It seems to me they used development time to take sharding and expanded it to cover the entire continent instead. 
---
I'm not saying I want sharding instead of layering, what I and other people I see are saying is that IF it is neccesarry (as we agree that it may be), then find a way... ANY way to implement it while trying not to introduce a host of other issues which a lot of people have been highlighting over the past few weeks and months.
---
Played as a human priest.  Grouped up for the candles and gold dust with a random that invited me.  Did not look to see what the loot was set to but when I did it was set to free for all.  They were looting as soon as the mob died so I was wondering when my turn to loot was going to happen.... that is when I noticed what it was set to.
---
Yeah, so my fault for not looking.

---
These are only the EU countries, by the way. Not all countries in Europe.
---
The system is currently broken and poised for exploits. I think people realize that there is a chance it will be fixed by launch, and there's a chance it won't, and the exploits will be real and very much not vanilla-like. 
---
If it remains unchanged from its current state, it would be better and healthier for the game for there to be no layering.
---
The reason he cant raid is because his free time is late at night. I probably cant raid because my free time is inconsistent but I still plan to get rank 10 cause I can pvp whenever, that doesnt require coordination with 40 people. And rank 10 isn't too hard to get. It just requires a few weeks of a hard push near the end

Lol "get away with" as this is criminal. Layering is not a business decision. They aren't bamboozling us to make more money. They think it's the best way to deal with server instabilities -- with way more information than any random "self respecting" dumbass in Reddit. No one has come up with anything better yet.
---
They made a choice. Now we need to help them make it work the best we can. Not just stamp our feet and say "classic is going to fail!"
---
how exactly does a 3k layer solve overcrowding?
---
it only prevents server queues.

It’s streaming 101 dead air is a no-no

"HISS!"
---
&gt; It's funny, a ton of U.S. players resubbed just to take part in the 2 day stress test this week, myself included 
---
This is also part of the problem. Blizzard most likely assumed that people like you, who resubbed for stress test...are the majority of the Classic players, or a number big enough to be a projected estimation.
---
&gt; There were many of us! 
---
I highly doubt it was more than 10k people. Blizzard is probably estimating like 10 times more for Classic. Which is 100k or less.
---
Their blue post for EU, regarding language based realms, reconfirms that Blizzard also expects less than 100k Classic players for EU.
---
I think Blizzard is seriously out of touch, and if they are basing their decisions on how many people resubbed for stress tests (and it seems that they actually did this) as a base number that can be projected into an estimation...they are dead wrong.
---
From OP comment on the page :  
---
"That is 50x22.47 Inches or 127x57 cm with 300 pixels per inch."
---
How is it not true? Multinational society happens every single day in almost all walks of life and yet we can still find ways to communicate and get our message across. 
---
And your worried about meeting a foreign player in an online game and not being able to communicate? Get a grip man.
---
There's room for one well-prepared Feral Druid in every 40 man. If they have no clue how to powershift, refuse to farm MCPs, or don't have their consumes, then they have no place.

Your experience was not the norm for sure. 
---
My server server 15 had loads of people. So much so that questing was near impossible all the way to 10 with spam for RFC groups every few seconds. My trio group of friends basically had to grind to get to 10 on higher level mobs.

Not trolling my american friend, gonna play Orc. I am using the Tor network to communicate on reddit in secret.

Why do you think England is trying so hard to get out of the European Union?

Although I agree with you - if I have a choice between a mage and a hunter, all else being equal - I’m taking the mage every time.

How often does that scenario come up for the average player?  Probably no that often, but may be a big enough factor to consider.

I know i can just ignore you because you are somehow predicting the future yet ignoring the past. Thats what a damn fool does. Enjoy being a fool I guess.

Dont forget the russian that usally do everything they can to bot/spam/scam/cheat in games.

The real life pro tip is always in the comments.
---
I've been on stress test and I'm trying to tell everyone here that layering is trash. Utter, lazy, new-blizz trash.  
---
People need to come out strong against it or Blizz is going to let the layering and lack of language specific servers kill classic wow because they can't make anything good anymore
---
I literally couldn't disagree more with this.
---
Wait there is an EU realm for classic now? I looked the other day and it was US and Oceanic only?
---
But what does your expected numbers represent? the number of player you expect to play the game at least once? during the first month? that will still be there after one year? players worldwide or in the west? (I mean do we know if the game will be rereleased in China or if Chinese players are wanting the game as much?) the total numbers of wow subscription?
---
Restricted to a specific area and can have more of them.
---
Eliminates issues with end-game resources, mobs, nodes, pets, AOE farm spots, gurubashi, ALL of that is eliminated by going sharding specific up to lvl 20 areas.
---
Plus, sharding actually alleviates beginner rush.  If you have 15k people per server, 10 layers won't do a damn thing, but 1000 shards would.
---
The german community is already planning a take over of several EU realms. So unless you are able to speak german, you won't find much joy on those realms.
---
&gt;  they also said it would only be the initial zones and initial few weeks, funny how things can change fast. 
---
They also said it was going to be sharding which got a lot of backlash and came back saying "they designed a new system similar to sharding called layering' also how long is "initial few weeks" 1? 2? 3? They still using the words "initial few weeks" but they've expanded on it and said initial few weeks till phase 1 next question.
---
You shouldn't be able to invite people into other layers in the first place. Why are you even able to send an invite to someone in another layer? It makes no sense.
---
This isn’t compatible with the classic spirit, you’re bringing in something to classic that a lot of us are trying to avoid. Your reputation on a server meant something back in classic. You had to hit up general in west fall to find people to run VC, not just hit some button like it is now in retail. The game wasn’t easy, it wasn’t forgiving. That’s the spirit of classic. Bringing in an add on like this is the opposite of the spirit of classic, it discourages engaging in the community. Instead it allows you to put your head down and level/quest while pressing a button and finding a group that easily.
---
I have a good friend who speak 5 languages (French, German, Spanish, Italian, Occitan (She can read and writz in latin too)). But not english. Is she a bad personne knowing more langage than most of us ?
---
Well, at least we will see free transfers if realms are gonna be overcrowded, so less of a problem.
---
Pros, none
---
Cons https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev-cy000SaM
---
You couldn't be more wrong.
---
ITs not going to be limited to the first week. Why are you fooling yourself. This fanbase is dropping the ball
---
Of course it’ll exist. It wasn’t allowed on the pservers anyway but there’s no real way of preventing it.
---
Yeah. Right now, as sad as it is, private servers currently have a better product.
---
Oh so you want retail in classic. No thanks.

---
Figured i'd pass along for your collection.
---
Well thats probably the reasoning behind it. They are the ones having access to the database and probably it is just not worth it for them and the servers. There are 60 and most of them all are not populated enough im assuming.
---
Servers didn’t have 7000 people... is blizzard doing classic with servers that large? 
---
I feel like there will be no difficulty finding 3500 of each language to form a server.
---
Lol yep, that's pretty much the thought process. It's all me me me me me.
---
How colluding with the other faction to manipulate the economy isn't against the TOS or rules is beyond me.
---
As an Irish person I am regularly embarrassed to travel around Europe speaking the Sasanach tounge. Especially when most continental Europeans speak their own counties language, English and typically another language with a high level of fluency. 
---
I personally don't think the sub communities will be an issue as the vast majority of people will be bound together by some form of commonality anyway. 
---
Plus what are they going to do? Have major European language servers? So French Russian and German for example based on population. So in that case people from Skandinavia better brush up on their second languages or they will have to form a sub community in the German or French servers. Likewise for smaller EU countries like Ireland but who continue to speak their own mother tongue.
---
thats so bad
---
I believe Blizzard is going to see how popular Classic will be eventually. All this hype can cloud the actual popularity.
---
What I think is that Blizzard is going to add more servers in different languages if the game proves to be success.
---
Slavoicboi is unto something!
---
&gt; predicting the future yet ignoring the past 
---
No I am simply using my brain to foresee what the  foreseeable future holds. That's what smart people do
---
Is there any official statements for this or a video that can demostrate this while using a threat meter mod?
---
My understand is that distance never mattered and that if you exceed the threat threshold, the mob will change targets regardless of the distance.
---
I'm not a developer in any sense of the word, but I would be careful about tackling the ambition of functionality that allows for group queuing among everyone that shares the app. Do you know how much information about other players is readily available through the client? I feel like without a central repository to pull from, it would become muddled and frustrating to utilize from a user perspective.
---
Although if you did proceed to try and add functionality between players sharing the addon, what's the feasibility of trying to parse information specifically from a custom chat channel?
---
They aren't? The vote barely passed, and it was won on fear and stupidity. Sort of how we got stuck with Trump.
---
But, in my experience many EU speak English. Very well.
---
Play a private server on launch day.  The opening zones are unplayable.
---
&gt;the choice between rolling on servers for other languages or to not play at all
---
That's the same choice now for everyone. I don't want to play the devil's advocate, but Blizzard surely has some analysts that made their maths, and in anticipation of the expected playerbase they probably thought it would be financially more benefitial to them to just screw over those few German, French, etc. folks that can't communicate in English at all rather then hosting and maintaining language specific servers. There's no room for altruism in multi-billion dollar corporations. Blizzard has had to make this call based on something, they surely didn't just pull this out of their ass.
---
Well since this sub is pretty garbage since the game inst even out yet and most people only have their memories, there isnt any really content on here. Oh, unless you count a youtube video that is actually good, then the first post will be hating on it for some reason along the lines of "dont support streamer culture."
---
You're getting downvoted but you're so right. Taurens do have slightly more reach but this is quite clearly leeway.
---
LOL. Layering is the exact same except the entire world. You realize this right?
---
grom died for this
---
You are completely misinterpreting what we complain about here. I'm french and fluent in english. Most people in France are (definitely true for the gaming/nerd crowd). 
---
What we complain about is not getting the wow classic experience we were promised in the first place. Especially since I'm pretty sure there would be enough player from France (67M people) or Germany (83M people) for having at least one dedicated server. Which might not be the case for, let's say Hungary (9M people). And from an Hungarian point of view, wow classic experience was mixed server, so no let down on that part.

Why do people KEEP on repeating this? The latest from Blizzard is that IT WILL NOT LAST ANY LONGER THAN PHASE 1
---
go read.
---
Imagine thinking a release in 2019 is going to be the exact same as it was back in 2004.
---
This was me too. I played a couple of nights ago, when the stress test opened. Jostled with everyone for mob kills, got up to level 6, had a blast the whole time. 
---
My first 10 copper was spent training Arcane Intellect, and I spammed it on every caster (and some non, when mana allowed, but that shit drained fast!). Because I could.

---
Can’t wait till August.
---
Don't feel bad OP.  42 here and I took the launch week off so I can no-life the crap outta the game first week!
---
yeah exactly not for me so whatever. nobody is forcing me to play.
---
It would be around the majority of players, who if they don't want to speak English, can play on a server of their own language instead. If blizzard dont separate servers by language, the community will. I don't want to level to 40 before my server gets designated as the unofficial Portuguese server and have to start over on an English server because I don't speak Portuguese. And I'm sure most people who want to speak Portuguese would end up rerolling from their server to the unofficial Portuguese one
---
Your reputation is still going to matter if you don't behave like a normal human people still will not play with you, thtats not going to be changed by this addon.
---
Well, realm transfers are never forced. If you choose to accept the transfer and your name already exists on that realm, you'll have to change your name.
---
Yeah cause when the game launches level 10 alliance players are going to raid ratchet

That's his style of humor. I'm rather neutral on asmongold as a streamer in that I've seen a few of his highlight videos and some I liked bot others were meh.
---
But all the people hating on him as a person should know that he lives with his mom because she needs special care due to some severe medical problems. You can not like his content or sense of humor, but the fact that he has built his life around caring for his sick mother should put his morality above reproach. If a fraction of the population cared for their family members as well as he does, we would be in a much better state.
---
that's about the only good reason to have all romatic languages on the same servers.  What if they have a 500 player pvp server a 1,000 player pve server and a 300 player rp server if they break it down by language the population fans out.  Then you have to divide it again by faction and the players are pretty small population after the initial hype rush or the 1 month sub ends.  I think they are playing for the long game, not the first week or month or even year.  They are trying to make it future proof, which until the future arrives we won't know if it really was the correct decision.
---
If it's more than one week, unsubscribe.
---
Sounds fake and nothing like vanilla.
---
Healing priest would like a word...
---
I don’t want thousands of shards. Multiple layers consistent across a world is fine, temporarily.
---
The power creep of T6 was allowed in TBC because TBC introduced resilience. If you increase stats by even half of the power creep of T6 you've reached the point of one shotting lvl 60s. This wasn't possible in TBC because so long as you care about PVP, all you need is some resilience and you're at least *somewhat* competitive.

Peekaboo the rogue and his team do it. But it's more like 3 guys all yelling the same thing 3 times at the same time.
---
Fucking lol
---
The server structure and layering/sharding are the way they are. Anyone who thinks it'll change is delusional or ignorant towards Blizzard.
---
Classic was designed to be the ultimate casual mmo back in the day.
---
It always bothered me that they called tbc gear tier 4-6.  The point of tier gear is that you need the last tier to get the next.  Your guild couldn't start getting t2 gear until you had a bit of t1.  Same with t3.  The point that AQ was t2.5 was it wasn't a must to do before Naxx; it helped, but not needed.  It is what it is, but it has always irked me.
---
As someone who haven't played wow in years and who thought to came back for classic (Until this international server fuckup happened) - can someone explain me what is happening around layers? I read that its like sharding, but permanent while logged on, so what exactly is happening here?
---
Because if there's a server cap of say 4k people and if you land on a server claimed by the French or the German community, you're not gonna be able to communicate with most of the server, trade chat etc. There are more people who don't want to speak English in the EU community than the NA one I'm pretty sure.
---
I'm not against variety, I just don't wanna get caught on a server that isn't majority English speaking and the way the system is set up now, there's no way to tell ahead of time what it's gonna look like.
---
Much more comfortable to talk in your natal language even if you know english.
---
And the world is ending too!
---
Won’t the ‘steamer’ servers just hit the “Full” status and stop letting all the lemmings join up?  This lower the potential numbers or players/layers. Thus stopping the extreme example from happening?

Not to mention, layering is just sharding with a hat on. The amazing this is how many people fell for it and continue to fall for it. I'll admit, even I fell for for the first 5 minutes before I read into the details.
---
This is such bs it's actually mindblowing. You're just stating random assertions with nothing more than "everything will be fine, don't question anything!"
---
Anal Moglie di Mankrik
---
I think it was changed in one of the later patches, but it was this ring by 1.12
---
It's weird how a lot of their design decisions basically assume they expect a huge amount of people to quit.  I wonder if they ran some focus groups and noticed basically everyone quitting.  It is even more of a grind than I remember though.  Even leveling after level 10 gets really slow.
---
That was 15 years ago, and I was a kid.
---
Nice. Do you want to explain it, or do you just feel like disagreeing for the sake of it?
---
Which I believe is rather the guy above's point.
---
Notice how every comment is against this addon? It speaks volumes, don’t do this. I really hope this is a troll post, if so you got us all, well done
---
While you and I feel that way, there are plenty of people for whom having the game in their native language is a huge part of their experience. I would argue that it is as much of an issue as not offering RP-PVP servers, people are wanting to experience the game their played 15 years ago, or the game they never tried but their friends have gone on and on about for more than a decade. If that experience you are seeking is in french with french people, and you suddenly don't have that option, that's a big ass deal. 
---
The biggest problem IMO however, is everyone that isn't on this subreddit, and isn't researching the game a ton beforehand. They might end up on an un-official German server without knowing it. The combination of making larger language populations go on international servers, and having small server populations, mean that we might see servers with super high percentages of a certain language, making it a shitty experience for anyone not speaking that language. 
---
I hope blizzard changes their mind on this - not for my sake, or for the rest of us geeks here on Reddit, but for the guys that either want those servers, or might unintentionally get stuck on an unofficial local server.
---
Sure they will. Your copyright is only as good as long as you enforce it. And all it takes is one simple online form that can be filled out by a machine.
---
I dont plan on playing at launch i will probably start 2 or 3 weeks after
---
Wtf is a Rosbif
---
this is why you get to the night club early
---
Yep, and Oceania countries.
---
you are gong to get crucified and dragged through the streets of /r/wowclassic with shame bells ringing because of this post.
---
I am very serious. Imagine thinking that a game people played for years is "literally unplayable" if it doesn't have a new technology developed in 2019 included. JFC
---
Im pretty sure on OSRS the stated country is to tell you where the server is located so you can join a world with an appropriate ping.
---
I feel like if we want a Classic+, the base should really be TBC. TBC always felt to me like the logical improvement on vanilla--much better balanced offspecs and such. On one hand, I really want to see new content in old setting--on the other, I really want it to be from a TBC talent standpoint. But unfortunately I understand that if they're gonna do a Classic+, it'll be in vanilla, and if they move on to TBC, they'll probably also move on to WotLK and not bother with a + path.
---
I dont mind the starter areas like 1-5 layered but never personally experienced issues beyond that.
---
Did you even play the stress test or are you just another troll spuing hate on this sub?
---
HAVE AT THEM BOYS
---
Vanilla was indeed "literally unplayable" at launch for a large number of players. I have a full month of free days on my account from Nov/Dec 2004 and Jan/Feb 2005 to prove it.
---
Yeah I know. It sucks to think about all those lvl 10 100 v 100 world pvp battles we simply wont be able to experience with layering after launch. How can I group/gank my favorite streamer if I'm on the wrong layer!? I would rather spend 6 hours picking cactus apples or 5 hours killing wolves instead. Blizzard plz.

\&gt;  No layering from lv20(?) onwards / no layering in any contested zones  
---
I keep seeing people post this but BLizz has already explained its continent wide so How do people think this will happen? 
---
The community needs to stand up against layering now or this will be your 1-40 if not 1-60 experience
---
This is built on a stretched premise though, you're eve assuming that German peoples English is so bad they can't communicate with native English.
---
No, Blizzard won't do this. They'll allow people to transfer to a NEW realm for free. That's it. Not freely swap realms as they please.
---
No offense, but the entire addon is not compatible.
---
I might be completly wrong here, but if it's not based on active sub, then you can write a script or bot (not sure how complicated these things are) that ll create a ton of accounts to increase your chances to get invited. To me it looks like good solution.
---
Idk that seems backwards, Italian is way more fancy than spanish
---
The data synchronization between all clients with the addon is already fully functional and working is should not pose any problem and the user does not need to mess with any of it it just works.
---
All chat messages are parsed (except whisper and guild), not only custom channels!
---
whats ccaf and why is everyone yelling it like a prayer before an air raid
---
*fewer
---
Besides, now that we have social platforms such as this subreddit and WoW forums, how hard would it be to keep a thread pinned with "unofficial server languages"?
---
This way, before creating your character, you'll check the pinned thread and choose the correct server if you want to play in english/spanish/italian/french/etc...
---
IMHO people are a bit overstimating the problem. Crushridge was a 100% italian server on Ally side and I've never, ever seen someone speaking english around.
---
What exactly is not and why?
---
Lmao yeah the final moments of the biggest private server there was, good one. I'm talking about now that Classic is a thing. Private servers will never have the same amount of players again. 
---
Comparing a final moment of a server to live servers doesn't mean a single thing.
---
Think outside the bun. *Taco Bell*
---
Fuck this .. Half the french ppl i Meet ingame refuses to speak english.....
---
110. But it doesnt matter at All because EU Servers wont be in US
---
You like to think they refuse to speak English but they just don't know English, that's it. 
---
I work in a 200 persons company. I bet you less than 10 would even get a grasp of what we're speaking here. Orally it would be even worse since the pronunciation is vastly different.
---
I went in plenty of countries like that. You make do, but you don't go complaining on forums about people that will meet one tourist in their life not learning a foreign language just for this.
---
In Moldova I had a 10 minute struggle to buy a Twix : I said "Twix" (I pronounce the W like "whip", don't know if it's the correct way) but he expected "Tvix". I even showed him what I wanted to buy but the guy didn't understand.
---
I was saved by a customer behind me that understood "oh you want a Tvix ?" "yes I want a Twix !". :D
---
Now if you're speaking of Paris, people are assholes there, even me with my most polite ways (and being native French, so no language barriers) I feel like a dirty foreigner.
---
Incorrect. Most were invited because they have won many pvp tournaments in the past and they happen to be streamers also.
---
Even Finns struggle. It really isn't fair to southern and central Europeans where they get by without using English much at all and don't hear it as much as we do.
---
Everyones talking about launch day like Blizz is just going to flip a switch and poof, everything is working perfectly.  Do people not remember nearly every patch day there was problems with logins and connections?  
---
I honestly expect a lot of connection problems on Day 1 and a lot less play time than everyone seems to think there will be.
---
Dungeons are uncontested exp, but are never faster than questing/grinding, since running dungeons involves a lot of downtime. (Waiting for everyone to arrive/wiping+corpsewalk/getting back to your quest Location after the Dungeon)
---
If you really want to Speedrun when Classic launches dont do dungeons. Get ahead of the pack by questing and stay ahead by avoiding Dungeons.
---
Pretty sure Blizz has already stated they will break any type of LFG addons for Classic.
---
Twice now you've made shit up about record speedlevelers.
---
If we're all gonna learn new languages let's just ditch English and go for Mandarin, it's objectively the best choice as the fewest people on earth need to change.
---
The changes caused by current year won't render the game unplayable lmao.
---
Okay show me the screenshot of a private server doing this right now. They will be dead once Classic is released.
---
Huh, I had no idea that the mouseover condition was a thing. Was that implemented right at vanilla launch? or did it come with a later expansion?
---
Did you play during the stress test???? 
---
I did and I didnt experience anything wrong with it. 
---
The game ran perfectly and I was seeing tons of people around me all enjoying the game. 
---
Stop with the hate speeches on this sub, if you dont like the game stfu and dont play it and stay off this sub. 
---
You dont get it. You cant compare 137,5 million german speaking folks to Albania for example...
---
it makes them pop up and they are able to do more with it
---
I think they should restrict the languages to certain races, for example dwarves should only speak in french and if you want to communicate with a dwarf then you should learn how to speak french
---
There are languages on retail where only a single PvE server is offered (ex: Portuguese).
---
No you should have looked at the past.
---
I’m not exaggerating, the entire thing. Anything that modifies or simplifies the group finding experience.
---
I raided with Puny alot in Legion, and she is usually a very objective and effective person. I think what she meant with this is; "We can't expect with all these languages being put together, that the servers remain fully English speaking", or something similar. Or that up until now, that there was an expectation that it would be a 100% english game.
---
At least thats what I read from this.
---
No.  Opening new realms, free transfers, etc.
---
Disney made a movie that they spent more money than any movie before it on but decided to put it up against the first Harry Potter out of spite for its creators. Anything is possible.
---
All you have is an AT&amp;T datacenter that Blizzard has an agreement with. They pay for every megabyte and every clock cycle. There's no investment by Blizzard in Sydney.

---
I'd agree.

No you're just a whiny baby confusing want with need. You're blinded by the "but I wont be able to level because of hordes of people" circle jerk. So you're ready to sacrifice pretty much everything else in tnhe game so you can tag a wolf  faster.   
---
seriously:  
---
\- layer jumping kills world pvp  
---
\- layer jumping kills zone interactions with same peoplke
---
\- layer jumping kills farming and questing when layers repop around you and nodes / chests change
---
you will constantly have you immersion broken because of layers. but dont worry you can load into an empty zone like this guy to tag your fucking wolf for lvl 4
---
Got it thanks :D
---
I m not sure that is totally true about not needing AQ gear to defeat Naxx.
---
I obviously don't have exact numbers, but everything that I have seen from private servers, original Naxx videos, and heard talked about, is that defeating some of the bosses such as patchwork with only BWL equivalent gear (T2\*) would be impossible just by a numbers perspective.
---
It’s also about paying 15/month (which is *a lot*) and still not being able to play on a server that speaks your mainstream language.

Plenty of resources out there, pretty much any tanking guide for Vanilla will talk about it.  If you're looking for a blue post, not sure sure if you're going to find it.
---
"Melee distance players would need to do 110% of the threat of the currently-tanking player to pull aggro, and ranged distance players would need to do 130% of the threat. Generally once the tank has aggro it's easier to keep it, although other players in the party/raid can utilize this information to maximize their damage output while managing their threat."  source: https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/threat-overview-classic-wow

No kidding. 60% of Europe's retail population ISN'T from the English-speaking realms. Are Blizzard out of their minds?

Ehhh - it might make them pop more, but you can accomplish that with good shadows. Seriouly, hair is not necessary for brow expression - there are so many examples of this.
---
maybe they should just learn english lol.
---
sarcasm, jk, but honestly europeans should just figure out what srv has the biggest pop of their language and play on them.
---
CCAF = noob in common btw
---
Never said it was for the hardware,  it's to ensure a less laggy launch
---
I don't know if LFR has changed, but when I last did it in MOP, it was definitely waaaaaaay easier. Half the group including myself had no idea what was going on and didn't know the mechanics, nobody talked to each other, there was zero planning. It was all just go go go racing through the raid and killing every boss without even the slightest worry about wiping. Then you get free participation loot, and everybody just leaves without saying a word. Not only was it not hard, it probably would have been harder to fail it.
---
That's not at all how Layering works.
---
Wow really? How can that be possible in 2019?
---
I don’t see much need in them either. Having separate windows for each bag makes it easier to organize and navigate in my opinion.
---
The hardware is miles better so if anything if would be smoother if they didn't add this layers shit
---
I remember getting grouped with some from Hakkar in WotLK LFG, and always having to hope they brought along a translator, as the Hakkarians only would speak Italian, making planning way harder.

No its a simple concept. We want vanilla. We don't want some bastard version of it with easily exploitable layers. Just cause some little muffin has to be on his favourite streamers server but can't put up with a queue. You sound like a bunch of entitled children. Thats how WoW got fucked up in the first place.

---
Do you want to play on a server with thousands of brainlets who spend their free time watching other people play video games and spam a 1994 chat window with their secret meme language?
---
Do you want to play on a server with thousands of brainlets who would spend their free time farming materials and resources and gold to give to someone for no reason other than they broadcast themselves playing a video game?
---
Do you want to play on a server with a person who has a legion of brainlets funneling gold into their account and then try to compete in the AH against them?
---
Do you want to play on a server with thousands of brainlets who's first choice in deciding which server to play on was based on the chance of running into someone who streams so they can just follow them around doing nothing?
---
And how do you know that. Reddit users are probably not even 1% of the playerbase. From what i know its blizzard who might have the information about the majority of playerbase based on their experience with retail servers.
---
OBJECTION!!
---
Yeah, sure. That doesn't change the fact that some people aren't proficient in English or will just refuse to use it. I prefer to use English online but we aren't going to have English-specific servers either.
---
&gt; Blizzard have to evaluate whether the servers will last in the long run. 
---
Correct. And there's no evidence to suggest an Oceanic realm ever would.
---
MorsePail floats between 7-12K population. It’s okay in that case, because the population is so high. Only half the people speak English? Well that’s still 3-4K people that do.
---
On a Vanilla-like server, that would only leave you with a much smaller fraction.
---
&gt;  there seems to be not enough outrage regarding this. 
---
It's very sad that people want to have increased outrage because they think that is what is required to fix problems. I think outrage culture sucks. I don't know what the solution is either, but I've been around long enough to know that outrage tends to end in further division and more problems.
---
Why is it harmful to simplify the group finding experience if it doesn't impact the social aspects?
---
It blows your mind because you can't conceive of the problems that would exist without layering.
---
Just because sometimes a streamer has a slight inconvenience doesn't mean it's worse than the alternative of the first 3 days having 10 hour queues or a dead realm for months
---
That wasn't a backpedal. It was an explanation and clarification that it would eventually go away because world bosses wouldn't work if it was still around by then.
---
Hence why I said they wouldn't help with bugs,  everyone complaining is just wanting free access to play
---
Just ignore the naysayers.

With low gear the hybrids do well because they are more utility based than stat based. A druid can still kite regardless of gear. Agasint warriors the hybrids should be able to easily win in the early phases but it will change as they gear up.
---
Sure, but then where do you draw the line? Constrast this with the fact that a lot of people speak English, even if it's their second language. The EU region has native English speakers as well (UK) so it's not like the population doesnt have a reason to already know english.
---
I agree, and for that reason I will roll on an international server and dodge Balkan guilds. I know for a fact a lot of people from the Balkans will actively hunt said guilds.
---
I do think it is healthier both for me and said people to be apart. Now, of course a Balkan realm is off the table, but realms for large homogeneous regions, German/French/Russian/Italian... will have enough people on them. I mean, EU will fill at least 10 realms altogether, and I bet each of said non-english-speaking communities will fill their own server.
---
It is simply overall happiness. Said people don't have to look hard for their national guilds, and I can join international servers and play with 98% of the playerbase.
---

---
Huge exaggeration, It was never like that.
---
Wait times definitely existed but they were few minutes, maybe an hour but rarely. I'm starting to believe it's Activision trying to save costs and not for our benefit.
---
&gt; Holland 
---
Super minority. Nearly all of the Dutch players will be rolling on English servers and are more likely to go German servers (due to language similarities) before going French.
---
That's a macro.
---
&gt; sure but they wanted him to be more human like
---
Sure and I am saying that was an unnecessary or even a bad design decision.
---
or unless the layers reshuffle because server pop changed. which happens every 10-15 minutes.
---
Et moi je n'ai aucune once de sympathie pour les weirdos qui ne parlent que l'anglais en 2019.

justtt stopppppppp
---
I've already experienced wow as a melting pot on private servers.  If I was a european, I wouldn't want that.  You don't end up with one big community, you end up with english lingua franca and a bunch of fragments defined by a given language with almost no overlap between them.  It basically becomes retail, except you don't talk because most of the group won't be able to understand.
---
You don't need a particular skill in enchanting to DE. So you can use the profession only to DE your quest rewards and sell the dusts/essences. Then drop enchanting for something else at 60.
---
Sharding would do that. Layering not so much.
---
Or you were a good DPS player who stayed below 100% of the tank like hes supposed to!  Haha
---
&gt; If blizzard gave you 1 server they'd have to give you 3. 
---
False. Blizzard gave Portugal 1 PVE server. That's it.
---
This gets posted all the time.
---
People don’t want different or new, they want classic.
---
New content belongs in retail.
---
wow, what a tragedy, having to be a decent person.
---
That what will happen, but there will be french people on other realm not knowing there is a French unofficial realm, and it will be a mess for everyone, exactly like it was dor spanish before they had their own realms. 
---
Worst, english speaking realm could switch to German or french or other, way after the launch of classic just because this langage will became the langage of the majority (can be less than 30%) of players on this realm.
---
And /1 /2 will be a mess too
---
I thought the lvl of FN affected how many could be rooted?

Sort by Horde only numbnuts.  Shamans are the highest percentage at 16%.

nope theyve already started defending it. they are not changing it.  
---
blizz doesnt wanna run many classic servers for some reasons  
---
lower your expectations accordingly.
---
I'm not either mang, i just saw your curtains and wasn't sure if you were. 
---
You can purchase it at the link for 15 bucks.
---
fuck the people who dont want to speak an 2nd language
---
-- probably the guy who only speaks 1 language: english
---
please inform yourself about layering correctly. 
---
List the advantages and list the disadvantages. Bonus point if you come up with a better solution :)
---
Hah that's basically my exact plan too.
---
Yeah Paris inhabitant are known to be rude. Even amongst French, we joke about them, "parisiens" being rude and full of themself
---
That would be the band Sublime, the song is Smoke Two Joints. I believe the deceased lead singers mother holds the rights, I could be wrong about that though.
---
:&lt; they still havent fixed this bug? Its been there since day 1 beta
---
I like server queus
---
they said recently that you wont see players dissappearing. hows that working out for ya?

This seems like a reply more geared around the economics / financials of video games and not the experience of video games. There's a lot of disruption going on in video games. Disruption leads to opportunity, specifically opportunity to challenge the status quo / historical trends. 
---
&gt;meanwhile the mobile gaming market share keep rising while the PC stagnate... 
---
Look at CD Projekt Red and their journey towards releasing a hugely anticipated single player only experience for which they've won government grants around AI and Graphics technology. I don't think anyone is hedging their bets against CDPR.
---
&gt;especially long-term PC game like mmos.
---
I don't think you're accounting for the technology disruption that's occuring either. Streaming technology and AI specifically could lead to a significant reduction in cost around Games as a Service. 
---
&gt;it will have a huge pop the first month, drop like a rock after 3 month, and have a skeleton crew ( likely a huge overlap with the current Pserver crew) by the 6th month.
---
I don't believe there's any real world data to back up this claim. Playing on a private server client is essentially "Frankenstein Shareware" and is not an accurate comparison to the real thing.
---
Classic WoW and it's long time viability (good, bad or other) will hopefully challenge this notion of money = success.
---
It works similar to vQueue yes, the creation of groups with the addon basically spams the chat for you (which you would have to do manually anyways)
---
Some people go on about how racist we're being for not wanting to play with each other, but we *know* our neighbours here. Respecting each other's differences and quirks and knowing where problems are going to arise is how we get along.
---
This sub has been like 90% circlejerk for a while now, if someone created a circlejerk sub i doubt it would be able to out-circlejerk this sub.
---
dont listen to people, do w.e you want. it looks like you are literally using in game communication channels so idk wtf they are talking about
---
This is the one everyone always brings up, but it's the only thing I've seen or heard about it happening and it was early in the beta. I don't watch many of the streams, so I might be missing something, but I'm hopeful
---
Once I even participated in a Molten Core Pug formed by Russian speaking guild. Although I didn't understand what they were speaking among themselves about, still I understood what my task was. Because If You have some WoW experience, You shouldn't have problems playing with other nationalities.
---
And yet, French is the world's second most taught language. Right after English.
---
you hold this insane prejudice against thousands of people and condemn them for their choice of entertainment. why?
---
I'm french. I'm perfectly able to speak and understand English even if I can be limited sometimes (for exemple I tried to roleplay on a English server but it was hard for me, I had to substitute words and not really express things exactly like I wanted to)
---
Anyway be sure that if the community of french on a server exceed a certain point I will not bother to talk in English. It's more plaisant to use our native language, and if 50% understand it's good enough.
---
This will not be English server, it will be international ones so expect people talk the way they want to.
---
People sharing their personal international anecdotes is so unconstructive.
---
Do note that in all of those anecdotes both you and said foreigner were willing to interact. 
---
Now imagine a situation where 50%+ of your server has unofficially banded together not to interact on an international level and you are stuck with them.
---
For that reason we need national servers for dominant language groups. Let Blizzard merge some of these later on if they flop, but allow people not to get screwed as soon as they accidentally pick a "wrong" server.
---
That I can accomodate to, I always speak english in games, it's normal to me.
---
But I understand others think differently, there's a point to it too.
---
I'm convinced, thanks.
---
So I did a little research, Monsters Inc came out the day after harry potter, was that the one? What was the story behind that?
---
The wonderful thing about romance languages is that they're so inbred that if you can communicate in one, you can at least speak gibberish in most of the others.
---
I'm ashamed that I could read all of that, and I only speak English (with 3 years of 20+ year old high school French, and a year of Duolingo german)
---
I wonder if this is part of what caused my guild to split apart in SSC.  "Don't use Curse of Doom on Hydross" was something the French-Canadian Warlocks could not understand.
---
LOL - hilarious. Lets all take a shot of vinegar for that one.
---
That doesn't fix the problem. A guild can still own all the world bosses and get infinite loot. They just have a small team tag the boss first.
---
IMO, there should be exactly one *World* of Warcraft.
---
Sharding and layering and realms and all of it should be done away with and we should only inhabit one world.
---
whelp thanks for ruining the game for the rest of us so you can lvl to 5 without waiting in a q
---
Thank you for your empathy. I wish blizzard will change his mind. :)
---
Lol fucking what? That is so far from the truth.
---
yeah, but chinese were a problem, not europeans. Europeans have at least most or all wow terminology, or have english as a second language.
---
All I got from chinese players on the private servers was "PLAYER X SPITS ON YOU"
---
What wallpaper you use on your right screen? Looks nice, if you don't mind me asking.
---
I mean I even empathize. I try to watch everything in the original language.
---
Though lately with audiobooks and big novels, I have learned to appreciate translations.
---
I have read ASOIAF in English. But sometimes you just phase out and have to re-read parts because it is more difficult to focus. I have found that with the translation, I get to focus on the actual experience.
---
Things can be problematic in social groups. Because yeah, nobody is going to watch almost anything in English. And the cinemas don’t show 2D airings past the first 2-3 days where I live (and one airing of English 3D per week).
---
We legitimately drive to Holland to be able to watch movies.
---
Its a temporary solution. Use your own brain and stop worshiping the opinions of streamers.
---
Aoe grinders are idiots. Having just one mage competing for your move slows the grind down tremendously, and there are going to be a ton of people.
---
Yeah, thats why when I see people talk about servers merging Im like lol man that is a pipe dream.
---
&gt;I know no one wants to hear this but maybe blizzard has a very good reason for BFA? They’ve kinda been doing this for a long time and most likely know more about how this all works than we do.
---
bootlicker logic
---
We just need universal translators already.. Screw different languages.
---
Bruh moment no. 2 mods need to fuckn block these type of posts soon.
---
They simply can’t handle the player load on the initial zones. Sure it’s more fair to fight over resources but god knows how many people aren’t going to stick around anyways.
---
At least give them a chance to try. By the time we pass barrens or redridge it should most likely be turned off anyways.
---
They don’t want it as much as anyone else. Stop cluttering the sub
---
Lololol
---
You would think that. But Germany isn't getting any because Blizzard doesn't think they can sustain any on their own.
---
I think Blizzard justifies it with the well known saying; “people don’t do what they say they will do”. They’re betting most people who have a preference for realm type don’t really care that much if they don’t end up getting a choice.
---
This is based on stress tests and isn't really indicative of how it'll go in the actual game.  A lot of people are choosing classes they won't play so they don't burn themselves out on a class they will wind up playing.  
---
Good job on the filters though.  I really like that on this site and the data is still cool to look through.
---
The original Addons will not work as Classic will have Lua 5.1 and the API from the Legion (or BfA) client minus functionality not present in classic  like i.e. transmog, void storage, etc.
---
This is such a French reply lol. I have yet to meet a single tourist who tried to speak Finnish and I wouldn't expect them to. Generally we try to help them out even if they speak English, German, or French.
---
This is what many will do but at same time doesnt seem right.
---
My guild is connecting with other german guilds right now, but what do single players do if they just want to jump in right on 27th aug.?
---
Its a gamble for them.
---
What about a player that jumps in for example in November and doesnt know about this realm thing?
---
Why does blizz not just release a german/french/whatsoever realm right at start if they will get formed by community anyway?
---
I think having a level ceiling is a better choice. Otherwise we'll get what folks have already seen: opposing war parties at cities that can't fight.
---
So people are going to have 50+ friends on their friends list that they're gonna use to jump between the handful of layers there are. Remember, if there's 9000 people on a server at one time that's 3 layers. 3. The chances all of those 50 people are on the same layer as you are pretty high.
---
BfA can absolutely be played as a single player experience.  You just pretend the people in LFD/LFR are bots, because most of them are probably worse than a bot would be.
---
I feel like I get more community experience with the NPCs in Skyrim than I do on BfA right now.  Its fucking bad.

What fascinates me is that Swedes are still speaking their tiny little useless language. What gives? You wanna keep some private jokes for yourselves? Lol.
---
Not sure what the point of reporting 7 layers on the Stress test server is (OP comments it was on the stress test, not closed beta servers).
---
Yeah can you stick to retail if you’re looking for this kind of game? Instead of bringing retail to classic... seriously we are trying to get away from this kind of stuff. Go away ffs
---
Whoa that was weird. I was reading the top voted comments in this post, which were all about how the mods are high on power and being too controlling. Reloaded the page and a lot of those comments don’t seem to exist any more.
---
You can't even use a classical dictionary, as many terms are game(ing) specific.
---
Only if they are in the same raid. If you're doing a massive 40v40 battle, you can't exactly invite the alliance into your layer.
---
because of their behavior, was that not explicitly clear from my post?
---
25,000 players by 2020? Yeah, pretty much. Until then there's Layering and server queues.
---
Hat jemand [Donnerzorn, Gesegnete Klinge des Windsuchers] gesagt?
---
little kids here don't care about immersion and have probably never played a real MMORPG
---
Yeah but it takes like a week to talk up that much rested
---
I thought the curtains hid the painting.
---
1.5 seconds of slow, you said yourself
---
Coc is casted at time zero
---
Nova is casted at time 1
---
That leaves 0.5 for error 
---
You still don’t need coc slow for anything and 3/3 Blizz slow allows more damage to be applied to mobs by blizzard itself
---
It's called 'The Mist' on wallpaper engine, if you do not have wallpaper engine highly recommend to buy it on steam
---
Why not both
---
Blizzard has said if it’s popular they will add new content. You have a niche of players who want nothing to be added (want the game to die in a couple years is how I see them), but from what I’ve seen they seem to be the vocal minority. 
---
If classic is popular and makes blizzard money, I would bet that they’re going to add content to keep the players subbed and the money coming in. Always have to remember blizzard is a business out for money.
---
As I'm looking into it, only 120x60 is available for me too ! Still looks good but it's quite expensive, almost 100€ on some websites ! how much did you pay?
---
To be fair, I am not a fan of dynamic respawns. I hate them. I hate them with a passion. I like caps of anywhere between 3k - 7k concurrent players personally. Those need a plan not to turn into ghost towns around AQ40 and Naxx, though.
---
But nothing is even close as bad to the shit they seem to be currently serving.
---
I am afraid lately they added some major red flags :(
---
Probably as an ease to make it so regular friends can group up but were in other layers? Like I plan on two many leveling and my friend and we both took vacation for this. If we can't play together because we were stuck on separate layers that would really suck :(
---
However, there needs to be better implementation (many tiny servers with a planned merge, only the first couple of starting zones, etc.) so abusers can't exploit the system.
---
Dont let others discourage you. You are not automating, and using the ingame communication channels. All this does is makes it simpler.
---
I plan on being a very busy tank late game and would love to use this
---
Yall acting like we're time traveling on release date. And trust me, nobody wants to see your crusty white monitor.
---
Yeah, no.
---
On charging for food/water. When they ask if they can get some, say the first stack is free. Then give them just one stack and charging for the rest. Once you are more comfortable with asking for payment, you can start respond to their requests with your fee.
---
Or charge some nominal amount like the amount of coin you collect from killing 4-8 mobs. This will scale with you as you level and it will be small enough that they won't care or bother asking the next mage.
---
Set you free based on how annoying it is. If you decide you don't like to be a vendor, charge more. If they are standing next to you, charge them more based on how good the gear looks if they are lvl 60.
---
oh I didnt know being able to read and blindly trusting everything blizzard says were synonymous
---
0%
---
It will be much lower, probably around 10%, because there will be many people coming in from wow retail, and from other games during the initial hype for launch week or until their sub ends.
---
In heavy touristic locations, it can get really frustrating having to deal every day with drunken britons. If someone comes at you speaking english you may start with a bad mood.
---
I am from Spain and whenever i travel to Portugal or France, i always try to order in their languages. And usually they will just try and answer me in spanish. At least where i am from this is considered the polite thing to do.
---
Classic’s endgame resources and economy are not comparable to retail.
---
Layering that is pointless and only opens the door for exploits. 
---
Just shard the early zones
---
you are aware blizz had a lfg tool in classic and it was bad and difficult to use right?
---
Just press a button for the game to play itself bro.
---
Nah, definitely not the case lol. I mained a shamy(healer) for my BWL days but when I had the rare opportunity to bring in my mage, I often pushed the limits. By hey, that's what Ice Block is for right....?
---
It was never a problem tho with a decent tank after couple sunders, and it was often a test of the tanks aggro. Most often I just couldn't pull aggro no matter how many frostbolts crit.
---
Cool thank you, was hoping someone would do something like this.
---
Is there any public info on the classic API yet? Noticed anything that is not part of the retail api?
---
stop replying to them, you picked a bad sub to come to for addon feedback. AS a developer i noticed that this may of been possible during vanilla and you arent really doing anyhting against classic
---
I mean did you miss how is trivializes world pvp in this clip? you have really downplayed the bad sides of layering with this comment
---
stoooooooop with this shit already
---
What *would* stop you from being overly sensitive about the word?
---
You are greatly overestimating the english level of French people man. English is not taught in class before being 12 years old and only in written form. You need to be 16+ y.o. and have a great english teacher in order to speak english in class. 
---
Even then, most student are rude between them and make fun of each others broken accent so people don't usualy talk.
---
Then, most french don't ever go on english web (reddit is unknow in France for exemple) so nowhere to speak or read it. By 25, only people with high diploma (and exception) still speak english because we need a minimum score in TOEFL or TOEIC to obtains our diploma. 
---
Hell, even in most of French compagny you don't ever use english.

---
I actually like it
---
a few months ago i told a spanish friend that if he speaks spanish it sounds like someone is talking in a fantasy language to me
---
No. Nost had 8,000 average players online and 13,100 peak players online. Which means servers that can host 25,000 players online at any given time is plenty.
---
it's better than pulling a Riot and sticking us scandinavians with russia. probably the most offensive shit i've ever seen.
---
now if the stubborn ass germans, spanish, italians, and french decided to actually join the rest of the world and speak english like civilized people, we'd all be fine.
---
Why don’t we trow an ilv addon aswell
---
Thanks man, appreciate it!
---
Did you play lights hope where they had to crank the spawns to constant just to make it playable? Did you see how much they had to scale back the stress test because it was unplayable until they had to up the spawns and sharding a few hours in? 
---
The no changes crowd's stance right now seems to be, "I'd rather have the game be unplayable and not even feel like classic wow's launch rather than take a lesser evil that changes the classic experience even if it actually feels closer to classic in terms of players per area."
---
It's not Stormwind, it's Hurlevent.
---
Okay, but the picture disproves any point you are trying to make. It is wpvp in action, horde versus alliance, with more than 10 people. So what exactly are you trying to say?
---
This should be deleted from the game. Sucks.
---
you dont have to be invited or do anything. when people log on or off the server you are on the layers reshuffle automatically.   
---
on stress test I cleared to the same chest 3 TIMES after reshuffles and finally had to give up because everytime I cleared the chest the layer would change and repop the whole camp

i dont think you really understand how big the skillgap is from a top 5000 guild and top 500, if you still play retail, do a +20 with people from your guild on their undergeared alt, then go pug a +13 and you will have more issues with the +13 pug than the many times more difficult +20 key. also, most of this subreddit are old wow players who belive they are hot shit cause they played on private servers or from vanilla to wrath.
---
Is there a way to make portals for your own alts in Vanilla?
---
Yeah, Spanish came from a bunch of barbarians such as the Visigoths and Italian came from the incredibly civilized Greeks and the Etruscans.
---
it was obvious they would pull some "activison move". classic was too good to be true without a problem.
---
Just an FYI the 2.0.1 patch is the Burning crusade pre patch. So if they are going to release BC i think you will have time to level up enchanting or level up an alt for it.
---
Yep through certain means that use hidden communication channels, kinda hard to break addons just talking in chat though.
---
So now you're locking people out that contribute to killing Kazzak but aren't eligible for loot at all because they weren't in the raid that tagged it? Yeah, that's going to go over well.
---
Pretty much, so why do LFR? Although to be fair, the pugs that easily clear heroic are full of people that have already done heroic and/or mythic a number of times. Not sure I would call pugging it at a low ilvl "easy" but the point is the same. I dont even do LFR on alts.
---
most europeans aren't as openly social as americans anyway, so even on same-language realms things will be rather isolated.
---
You sound like a racist Trump supporter. “You need to speak English!!!”
---
i played on stress test and dont give a fuck about streamers. ready to pay any attention yet?

i totally see your point, it takes a ton of time &amp; practice to master a language that much. TBH we all don't know how successful classic will be, maybe blizz is right. It's just sad that this information is here to kill the hype for so many people. I really hope they change their mind.
---
i feel it would be very easy for you to do somehting similar for trades and professions, something that parse people looking for work, or looking to buy. Would that be a project you can take on? or does this one still have more work?
---
Then you and your friends should be able to choose the layer you want to play on when you create your character.

I don't know about that, I mean you'll be able to create your characters on August 13th... two weeks before launch. So I would expect people will organize and you will find multiple posts in the official forums announcing takeovers of specific realms.
---
If this doesn't happen though, then yes, you're completely right and you might find yourself on a 'foreign' realm on launch day.
---
Both would work.
---
The exact reason to avoir streamer realm, what a cancer.

Because he wants a mega server? Meaning 1 big server? Is your reading comprehension any good?

well, scandinavians are basically known as the language police in europe. if you ever see someone complain about people not using english it's 99% likely to be a scandinavian.

---
I haven’t actually made an addon. This is a joke.
---
So all of this actually made me wonder how many of us Frenchmen can speak English.
---
Well after looking a little, found out that only 14% have a decent level, and 40% can only understand a few words and sentences. So that's almost 50% that don't know any english words.
---
And it look like this isnt going to change soon because more than 60% think that learning english is useless. Kek
---
TV sure, but don't go dragging books in there. Those are definitely way better for your brain and even health than the other two.
---
The official English classic discussion is just fantastic comedy at this point.
---
The answer is simply before grouping with anyone have them perform a English test and scores below a certain threshold get kicked and ignored. To make life easier we can also have server black and white list ts that are maintained
---
He was making a joke, relevant to OPs post even. why you gotta be the way you are.
---
Then both of you should be able to pick the same layer when you create your character, just like how you pick servers.
---
As if. Blizzard isn't setting up just a few servers. The problem is not that there will be too many players at launch. The problem is that there will be too few players when hype is over.
---
Yeah I know, I love to play balance but going deep in balance tree isn't very viable and once you're used to NS it's hard not having it
---
jante law.
---
Layering isn't an issue unless you CHOOSE TO ACCEPT AND INVITE AND GO TO ANOTHER LAYER
---
I'm just surprised how much europeans hate each other, lol
---
well im sure you know more than people who get paid to do those things
---
Mighty Ducks soundtrack
---
French and German servers will be mostly Arabic speaking anyway
---
Free transfers to a new realm doesn’t really make too much sense. When you are leveling on a brand new realm you want to be corpse camped, or already have the 60 economy and endgame already beginning? I know it’s not a big deal for most casual players, but if your language server comes out, I don’t want level 60 Russians(as an example) running my low level zones transferring right away and just running train on all of my gnome brethren.
---
wasent ment to sound racist. if it did.

I think i even typed i wanted them too be on a server that they could be happy, and speak what ever language made them feel good.

Is that why Russians are getting their own servers?

FALSE

LAYER SHUFFLES HAPPEN AUTOMATICALLY EVERY 10-15 MINUTES DURING BUSY TIMES WHEN SERVER POP CHANGES

It's how British call the French since they re supposed to eat frogs which is indeed a French dish but few people do.

That means you were carried by 30+ other people who at least used keybinds.

and i want that for all of us.

i dont care where ppl are from, but its not benefitting anyone to not be able to communicate.

Oh. Well this was a very good quality shitpost I can appreciate then. Respect

Looking for: a competitive/hardcore/semi-hardcore PvE guild with mature, reliable people
---
Inspired by the legendary Pat PvP 2 video, I started playing WoW a year into Vanilla as a Tauren warrior named Macbain on Agamaggan.
---
Since I began so late and played so much PvP, I only managed to clear MC, Ony, ZG, and AQ 20 on live as an off tank/dps warrior before TBC. I was in college then as well so I had little time to dedicate to the game. Despite my casual attitude then, I played far more than I should have, just like everyone else did at the beginning of the game. After earning my Tabbard of the Protector, I've played every expansion off and on with a range of classes but tend to enjoy the OG tanking master, warrior, the most. I long to rekindle those ancient days of the true glory of the warrior once again.
---
Throughout the course of WoW, I've become a highly experienced tank and would like to find and journey with adventurers of similar talents. I'm never absent or late, I don't stand in the fire, and I know the importance of min/maxing as a tank in Vanilla. But I also know that the real thing that sets apart competitive guilds in wow is guildmates' dedication to one another.
---
Lately, I've been playing a little on unnamed realms to get back that nostalgic feeling and to remember how to play during that bygone era.
---
I'd like to find a group of people that I can journey with throughout the course of Classic from questing on up as I miss the feeling of comeraderie that was inherent to Vanilla. Drama is something I work very hard to keep out of my life so I'd prefer to spend time with mature folks, especially if I'm going to sink real time into this game again. Ultimately, I'd like to clear Naxx someday with my time investment, a good bunch of people, and a whole lot of loyalty.
---
I live by routine, work full time, and have an exercise regimen that I take very seriously but other than that I have few real commitments. I've even already taken off the first week of Classic on my journey to 60.
---
If you think we could be friends, just send me a pm here on reddit.
---
Cheers, and I hope we meet someday soon in Azeroth!
---
One of he complaints of sharding was that people around you would be constantly blipping in and out of your shard and you would blip in and out of different shards. Group invites are the only way that happens with layers.
---
Shards are multiple servers mashed together, layers are a subsection of one server.
---
If you’re solo questing on a layer, the people you see running around doing quest X will be the same people you see running around doing quest Y 20 min later. Very different from sharding, where you might never see half those players again.
---
Look again. There aren't many alliance in that picture.
---
Looking at your reddit post history on this you must just be a sad little man. Layering for Classic 2019, I'll be sleeping easy :)
---
It was in vanilla, but it caused you to shift targets, so you had to create a supplemental line to target last target.  This would clear combo points for rogues using mouseover blind or kick.  The new macro functionality (introduced in TBC) allowed you to mouseover without losing your main target, maintaining combo points.  It's the main reason I look forward to the macro change, or only reason.

all you need
---
I'd recommend getting Improved Sap if your build can afford it. It's hugely useful in PVP, solo PVE and in 5 mans. With it, rogues can have some really nice utility in groups. You can sap a troublesome mob (great for those big patrolling dwarf packs in BRD), blind another, and gouge and kick (improved talents for both help a ton) to keep a third locked down. Meanwhile people will be glad to have you for your great damage.
---
This is the thing. Lots of Classic fans think everyone will look at a much slower and less eventful game and go mad for it. I think, and Blizzard clearly also thinks, that after a decade of social media and faster and faster paced WoW, most people are going to be bored shitless by it.
---
And I say that as someone who wants to play. We'll see what happens.
---
Lol jesus
---
poo in sock to save time going to bathroom
---
scandinavians and the dutch are among the primary representatives in the english speaking european communities. everyone else, including the UK, are a minority. they just don't have the same gaming culture.
---
If you have a problem with this...stop them...
---
If you can't stop them then your are shit out of luck.
---
Welcome to classic wow
---
This. Well, that's how we "remember" it being.
---
It’s almost like they are testing it to make it work for launch...
---
Still better for the newbie zones than having everything camped and not able to do anything because there's tons of people trying to do the right thing.
---
&gt; From that point you just play the game without talking to each-other.
---
And then you get ninjalooted at the end of the run because they just don't give a fuck about you if you don't speak their language, or the group splits up because they can't understand that they need to CC or interrupt a spell or you can't just spam regrowth since you'll go oom in 10 seconds, you vastly underestimate the value of communication. 
---
This is all with the assumption that you can actually get invited because they won't if you don't speak their language and if you start the group yourself people will instantly leave after they join and ask if you speak their language. My server got infested with Hungarians in Vanilla and we had to move eventually, absolutely horrible experience.
---
Definitely. The beta and the stress tests are a testing ground for the layering system so that Blizzard will know what to do with it once the game goes live.
---
Well I'm playing with swedish players only and it doesnt stop me from speaking english from time to time when raiding with other nationalities, in fact I quite like meeting people from outside scandinavia.
---
Unpopular opinion: French people are just salty their language isnt the global one.
---
Exactely why I didn't commit. I know my friends as well
---
Let's throw a bunch of cultures who have spent almost all of their existence warring with each other on and off onto the same server, \*and\* force them all to speak the language of a country that once controlled most of the world!
---
What could \*possibly\* go wrong?!?
---
It's not like they were all involved in either terrorism, genocide, or indiscriminate warfare against each other within living memory and aren't all, to this day, overflowing with a seething miasma of nationalism and cultural superiority.
---
Good idea actually! For now I will focus on the LFG part, later down the road I might do the trading, sounds good!
---
Tu surestime grandement les éventuels problèmes posés par cette décision, comme tous les types ici qui chouinent sur les streamers etc.  J'ai jamais eu de problème avec le fait d'indiquer à des anglais/autres langues un mob à tuer. En principe, les types qui vont jouer à Classic ont + de 18 ans et savent dire "kill white bear" "group DM" "horde crossroads" et si ce n'est pas le cas, alors le split des servers est le cadet de leurs soucis.
---
Prepare for it's return. I pity anyone rolling characters on this servers coz i understand how fucking terrible it is. Yes bloodscalp's population steadily declined due to the non-stop hungarian chat and eventually ruined the server.  
---
I mentioned this in my other comments without stating a server name, but you hit the nail right on the head.
---
Agree 100% I've played on private international servers. It sucks because you are so limited in choices and many of the players you are playing with don't speak your language. Finding a guild is also tough because it's usually just one and if they don't raid on your time off you're screwed.
---
So basically, Patch 1.13 aka Retail 2.0? BTW, Isn't Classic already patch 1.13? Maybe you thought of 1.14+
---
Alright
---
real OGs only used macros for /spit, /lol, /kiss and /moan.
---
Honest question, what’s the appeal of that guy? He’s so Whitney and immature that I can’t watch ten minutes of his stream.
---
My point was that 'terrible' is entirely a matter of perspective. To you, players in a top 5000 guild is terrible. To me, players in a top 300 guild are terrible. And to players in a top 50 guild, I'm a stinking pile of garbage.
---
Is this how you react to new information in general? Run away when you're wrong?
---
Uhm, this is exactly like the vanilla addon vQueue.
---
Doesn't solve the problem of everyone and their brother's dog "checking out" WoW Classic then quitting in 4 months. Layering is a /potentially/ good option to address the real problem. But it does come with drawbacks. The goal would be to limit the drawbacks, not scrap the idea completely.
---
I think there are less absolutist limitations that could make layering work as intended
---
It's like having two doors:
---
- men
---
- women
---
But once you're on the other side to realize they all go to the same room.
---
It's a win-win-win:
---
- people get to have their own "French" door
---
- you only need one realm
---
- and you get a larger player population
---
They are going to use the same GMS for both retail and classic. No need for additional support.
---
Online and active players are not the same thing. Blizzard vanilla servers were made for 3kish online. So that would mean 15k online for 5 servers. 5k active players per server gives 25k. And I'm fairly sure I saw 16k online on nost quite frequently.
---
Either way it's close to what ONE private server had. Banking that classic by Blizzard will have less than or equal to that is fairly pessimistic. I don't think classic will have 2 mil active players or something insane like that, but 100k isn't far fetched tbh.
---
He’s saying he wants English speaking people and non-English speaking people to be confident they have communities they can communicate with.
---
Segregation isn’t the answer, you fucking Nazis
---
I think we should have different regions claim zones and have a huge risk game
---
Honestly I think we have a lot of American mods who don't understand the nuances of the good-natured hate Europeans have towards each other.
---
i dont wanna force anyone to do anything, please read what i wrote. I want us all to be happy. do you think a guy that dosent speak english, wouldent want to play on a server where he can speak with everyone if he had the chance?
---
So much this.Also i can talk and play just fine in english but i'm much more comfortable and able to socialise in my mother tongue, you can talk about the same news, politics and trends, those things besides tend to be much more national/local
---
That’s what a guild is, you morons.
---
I have never played Wow. Years of WC3 and Dota1/2 but I am excited for this.
---
That's the part that I don't understand.

Blizz making Classic is like a time traveler describing a modern suit to a dark ages tailor and hoping the end result looks something like a modern suit. The merged languages servers is the icing on the meltdown cake.

In response

A) I guess I sit in the glass half full camp and believe in the humanity of others.

B) people will find their way of communucation or planning however they see fit. 
---
I for one am just grateful we are getting this game in the first place.
---
Half of the threads get overrun by underage racists who spout their bigoted opinions about one or the other nation which prompts a multitude of reports and a subsequent lock.
---
I want a UK only server. We don't need German Engineers, or Eastern European miners taking our jerbs. We might end up having a lot less people skilled in first aid, but that doesn't matter - we can just level BRITISH people to 300 with BRITISH linen and BRITISH wool, BRITISH RUNECLOTH.
---
Bloody EU nationals coming and spamming their [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Asylum-Seeker]

I don't see the issue really. Pservers have been a similar melting pot for years and nobody threw fits over it.
---
There's nothing wrong with LFG. LFG is not LFD.
---
Which country are you from? I am not sure there exist many countries where some people don't feel offended or threatened when they see or hear something written in a different language than theirs. Multiple languages always create some frictions and tensions in one way or the other.

It also only takes a single: speak English please, to sour any chat.

Shit, that's a nice wrynng.
---
Not sure where this large portion is - reddit makes up a tiny portion of the actual people who play.
---
I'd say if your friends are committed to it, stick with them. I've got a few and we've been planning for months on what we're going to roll. You'll meet a ton of people as a healer, but playing with IRL friends is a whole nother level.
---
I am not saying everybody needs to use it, I quite sure tho there are people that want something like this and I just want to try to bring both worlds together :)
---
You’re spelling and grammar give me the same feel, good luck on your racist hunt for English only servers.
---
To be fair, this one is not nearly as big of a deal as the other red flags. We will probably work around it better than in the past. Guilds will form into clusters and consider rolling on similar servers. Spanish servers will be designated.
---
But some people will not know about any of that and probably be disappointed.
---
Even if it’s not quite as big a deal, it adds salt to the sharding and melee leeway wounds.
---
Hakkar was awful. If i hadnt transfered, TBC would have been ruined for me.

I'm still thankful for my italian guildmates being patient with me though, and that one guy who translated everything.

Plus, all the best spots are going to be heavily contested. I love AoE grinding, but I'm going to avoid it this time.

Was that server Burning Legion? That was my very first server in vanilla, back then it was mostly an English speaking realm.
---
Now it has been nicknamed 'Polish Legion' because it is the de-facto Polish server. It's not a bad thing, I think it's nice that Polish players have pretty much made their own server so that they can find and play with each other. 
---
Twisting Nether has a growing Turkish population as well. Again, no official Turkish server so they're gonna gather somewhere.
---
I don't know why Blizzard aren't at least doing the same as they do on retail - Spanish, Italian, French, German, Russian. Therefore even if a European from another country doesn't speak English as a second language, they could speak one of those other languages.
---
And then there's Sweden. *So many Swedes* play WoW. I've probably met more Swedes than any other nationality while playing, yet they don't have their own server.
---
Does it really cost Blizzard a lot of resources to run a few extra servers? Even if the server ends up only with a population of 1-2000 players, I think that's well worth it. But I don't know the costs of running a server.
---
They were pretty resolute when they said that layering will be gone by phase 2. Blizzard always chooses their words carefully so I don’t think they will backtrack on it.
---
That would be illegal.
---
That's nice. I've been wanting to do something simple like that myself. Good luck with yours
---
He just had to mention he played in vanilla lmao.
---
Might need to do a B.net update.  Be aware that the "Live" Classic WoW is a US-only Stress Test closing later today.
---
Did you know there was a lvl 30 duel tourney on classic wow that had around 150k+ live viewers? That was more than some dota tourneys. Just some lvl 30 community event pulled those insane numbers. I don't think it's as grim as you think. The community is very clearly interested.
---
In Germany people refuse to speak German to you if your native language is English.
---
okay, i dont understand how its racist tho? i also want French only servers so they can be happy. and german servers. are you sure youre not just looking for things to be against?
---
it looks like rend for sure.
---
I’m sure he’d find a nice guild of people just like him. Doesn’t need to be shut off on a completely different server.
---
It does not, it's always affected all targets within range that aren't otherwise immune.
---
I don't think gaming it's in a "lull". I think it's going though a state of constant disruption and is trying to catch up on the new "hot" trend. 
---
I believe mobile "gaming" will evolve (devolve) into designed dopamine releases. 
---
Traditional video games, and the experience that comes with them, will evolve into a more core experience and they won't be for everyone- which will prove is viable and rewarding in their own right.
---
WoW Classic even being released, at least to me, is a HUGE sign to developers and publishers that there is an older, more mature and disciplined population of consumers that will never spend money on mobile games, won't pay for MVP's (minimum viable products) and are willing to invest time and money into something that is worthy of our time and by extension our money.
---
MAKE MURICAN SERVERS GREAT AGAIN!!
---
Once you stop sucking Soda's dick, let me know, and we can begin having a real discussion.
---
who told you layers only change when you join a group? it happens automatically. there is a lot of misinformation about this on this sub. are you in any of the tests?
---
I don't understand. Do you just not realize how crowded it will be or what's the issue?
---
its not classic!
---
There are language-specific servers in the private server scene. That said, a lot of "International" pservers require English spoken at all time in-game.
---
&gt; Now as an adult there's still an expectation that you do "real life adult stuff" instead. Very few people I know at work game regularly unfortunately. :(
---
There has been a complete sea change in attitudes towards "nerdy" stuff. So many people are nerds about something, and everyone under 30-35 (ages and personal experiences may vary) had pokemon or nintendo or playstation etc. be a pretty substantial part of their lives or those of their peers. Technology just swept that entire generation solidly.
---
If someone hasn't caught on to the fact that it's normal to be nerdy about something, then they're the weirdo, not the nerd.
---
At work so can't check...I think I've got one of those, not both, will check after work. Thanks.
---
Yes we need classic wow czechtul in its full glory
---
Yeah he was one of the few players back then, you’ve probably heard of him.
---
See I knew what this was because I know "chercher" means "seek" from higshchool French. I don't want to go back to my French studies. I just want to have fun playing a game.
---
Layering is a disaster and Blizzard needs to feel the pain. Any mechanism to directly communicate layering feedback should be utilized.
---
Thats what I'm aiming for. Maybe 9ish?  I took my time to 40 in the beta, doing long fedex quests and such, I will avoid those this time around and my lvl 40 was /played was 5 days.
---
As our civilization becomes more and more global, I‘d actually love to take a class in Mandarin. The investment can‘t hurt.
---
Tbh I think they have just ignored the pservers because of the language barrier but I have no idea.
---
I’d rather be able to level in phase 1. Layering is honestly a great idea for the first few weeks.
---
Classic will have more players on release than vanilla did. Why this concept is so hard to grasp, I don’t know.
---
They need layering for leveling.
---
You’ll be nuked in 2038.
---
ye maybe. havent played em much,
---
Same company that has had broken sharding for years now and you think they are going to have this working right in 60 days from now.
---
No they are not. My region is strictly french/German speaking.
---
Also some of the returning players are 30+
---
Its really hard for older people to learn a new language, than an 8 year old child.
---
Well, yes. But look, why do we even need fucking international Classic servers when we can have international Private Blizz-like right now? It's all about quality of service. We expect to have different realms for different cultures with their own support and GMs. It would be nice to have local data-servers to provide low latency and many other things private servers don't care about.   
---
Private servers work just fine with many custom features. They are absolutely free after all.

I hope you paid him a commission before getting that printed.

* US Pacific gets 1 PVE, 1 PVP, and 1 RP.
---
* US Mountain gets none.
---
* US Central gets none.

* US East gets 1 PVE, 1 PVP, and 1 RP.
---
* Latin America and Brazil get none.

* Europe gets 2 PVE, 2 PVP, and 1 RP.

* Oceania gets none.

Let’s presume it’s 100k active accounts across these 13 realms. That means 65% of them can be online at any given time without queue times. Seems about right.
---
I can't wait to see Spanish players getting banned for talking about anything with the word black in it. Thanks Blizz. ;/
---
Fair enough - let's just hope we'll get the experience we're looking forward to for many years.
---
I always thought it looked kinda ugly :/ and when i started playing in vanilla I didn’t use addons so I got used to organizing my bags based on item type which is just how I have kept playing from then on
---
You're greatly overestimating the "problems" caused by this decision, just like every person here that has been arguing "streamer servers" over the last few months. Never had any problems indicating strangers how to "kill a white bear" or "i'm missing 1 item". You might even learn new words/sentence templates, and WoW personally helped me a lot in that regard 10+ years ago: if you can't communicate in basic english, community split probably shouldn't be your highest priority.
---
I giive you language but fitting raid times is so not an issue in EU.
---
Have you played the game in recent years? Legion and BFA launch were extremely smooth. It’ll be fine.
---
Not at all, but it's the logical and inevitable course of action in situation we're presented with.
---
Russians and Frenchies in particular are especially resistant to learning or speaking english, and they have been conditioned to this "luxury" by having their own servers for 10+ years by now.
---
Those people will either completely take over a server, or few, or create black holes within multilingual ones where all they do is act as queue buffer.
---
&gt;ple, you could focus the gearing process on aquiting Holy Resist Gear in order to progress through the content. The possibilities are endless: you csn have certain boss tactics involve a specific resistance threshold to survive (see: Ragnaros, Baron Geddon), have a mechanic requiring a specific item (see: Onyxia Cloak for Nefarian) or even a sub-area or room having a debuff that can only be s
---
Do we really need a level increase to go from Classic endgame to TBC end, to Wrath end?  No.  We act like we MUST increase caps to progress, that just is not really the case.  You can leave the caps alone and allow gear to control progression.  New zones with lvl 60 mobs that hit like trucks... sure you can go there as a green geared 60... but you HAVE to play very well to succeed.  You go there with Blue's - you can survive more easily, but still have to be aware and be decent at gameplay.  Purples, no issue - might not want to over pull or get too sloppy, but no real issues.  Top existing tier --- guess what, you just earned yourself an easy ride in this new zone full of \[still level 60\] wicked whatevers.  
---
This, in my opinion, offers a couple of benefits.  "High end" raiders are (generally) more interested in getting geared for progression vs exploring whatever place.  By being so well geared, they have an easier go of it in the new area and can focus more on what they "need" to in order to attune to that new raid, or whatever.  World and Server first teams are working for that, not for experiencing the lore that comes from the 37 quests that were added just to tell the story of a farmer who was having his pigs eaten (generally speaking of course).  But, common Joe who likes the story, hits some 5 mans, and wants to experience the rest of the game for what it is would be more interested in doing those quests and experiencing that side of the game.  Instead of being LEVEL dependent the content becomes SKILL and GEAR dependent.
---
Could you get carried by some top geared folk to more quickly gear up, sure - but that's kind of similar to being carried for levels, or boss drops too.  The difference here being that you don't just swap out your shiny new purple for a green.  That T3 is not going to be replaced by a normal drop, a quest drop, or any other normal 5 man drop.  But what does drop in the new zone IS superior to what was dropping in the last "hardest" zone.
---
The trick is to balance the new zones gear vs previous Tier gear.  So for example T3&gt;T4&gt;T5 progression for zone A&gt;B&gt;C.  Keep the BEST "casual" gear just below the Tier gear of two zones back.  AKA T3 is just barely behind top zone C quest or dungeon drops - probably by some tier set bonus stats vs a basic +int etc.
---
Now the first thing that may come to mind is, "you want to roll new world content each time you open a new raid? -- or maybe You want new Tiers for each raid?"  No - Say New Raid "C" has T5 level, there may be a 3, 4, and 5 piece bonus.  Raid C opens with zone C (in this example), but raid D could also open (following some Raid C attunement) and in raid D you get more T5 gear adding to the set, etc.  Again top "casual" gear is still just below T3.  You can expand that with a limited number of raids, or wings of raids that are attuned individually.   Think 4 wings, wing one opens normally and drops 25% of all the possible Tier gear (each wing holding 1/4 of the BIS gear).  Complete wing 1 and that attunes you for wing two - but you have to wait for raid reset to turn in the "token" to an NPC that runs off when you pull the first boss, etc.  One raid, four raid cycles to complete IF you manage to clear a wing each week.
---
I know that was kind of long, but the point is, we do not need MASSIVE jumps from Tier to Tier, BIS to new BIS, or level to level.  If you are going for the best, 1% is better... and that may only be a +30 vs +33 STR.  Now that said, it WOULD make it more important than ever that balancing bosses be done very well as if it is a little too hard, no one would drop it...a little to easy and every raid team in tier gear can complete the raid easily once they learn the mechanics.  (All the more reason to hold things back with attunements).  If it looks too easy, they can patch in a quick shift for the next wing before the world firsts hit it based on how wing 1 went, etc..
---
As a diametric, it also would allow everyone the chance to hit up older raids and have a chance at succeeding once they are quest and dungeon geared (think Raid A level after maxing out Area C "common" drops - with no detuning...ever.  They can experience it as it was, for guys in the correct tier gear, or eventually overgeared.  
---
Now does that make all LVL 60's equal?  NOPE - absolutely not.  Someone whos been rolling in zone C SHOULD be better geared than zone A folks.  That's real experience, not exp on a bar.  Could they get carried, sure, but that's life.  Does it mean you may think more about approaching that lvl 60 from the other faction before you attack... well you better as they may be a heck of a lot better geared but their shoulders don't show it from a distance.
---
IDK, just some ramblings.  I think we have a legit chance with classic to fix what went wrong the first time.
---
You not wanting share a server with a French or German speaker, or anyone who isn’t speaking like you, does come across as racist.
---
You're retarded.
---
This is the only time I’ve ever seen somebody say this other than me and I’ve been saying it all along. Rework the stats on ashbringer and make the corrupted one cleansable in the raid.
---
Ahhhhhh Anal, the universal language of Europe

Was quick and to the point which was nice. The spots mentioned seem to be worthwhile depending on competition. The only thing I would say is because the majority (excluding the Tanaris farm mentioned) of the spots and items emphasized place reliance on player to player trade, a disclaimer that using this guide to save for mounts immediately upon release may be problematic due to an unestablished server economy and a lack liquid gold may be warranted. But like I said, other than the unknown of the initial S&amp;D/economy of the servers, it’s a solid video.

As if many people report bugs anyway

macro to move the pet does not work, the circle is there but  my pet doesnt move.

Because you’re not seeing the point that there’ll literally be thousands of English speakers on the server you choose, and maybe 100-200 of “those guys” that YOU cannot communicate with.
---
And you’re here complaining ahead of time, to avoid a few nice French dudes.
---
I mean, there’s a ton of way you can abuse layering.
---
I agree, I think server merge is the best solution overall by a good margin. However, having played in a private server fresh launch last summer, layering is better than the alternative of a mass mob spawn crank where respawns were near constant (which broke the game way more than exploiting layers) or the game being unplayable due to the inability to find mobs to kill. So if Blizzard is not willing to do the best solution, I think their choice is the best among the remaining choices.

You Sir, changed my mind!

An of course, we don't have a logout button. We have a big button that says "brexit". It doesn't log you out on the first try, second try, but waits for 18 months and then crashes to desktop and sets your computer on fire.

---
I heard that the clearcasting with arcane missiles is a 10% chance × 5 damage ticks (which is overall about 40% per spell cast).. Because for the channeled spell its every damage tick. However aoe spells like AE and FS it only has 1 chance of 10% to gain clearcasting. 
---
Ive seen people say one way, ive seen people say another. I even saw a github post talking about how clearcasting chance is supposed to count for each damage tick. Is there a blizz dev post on how that interaction is supposed to be in vanilla?
---
You are telling me not a single football game is similar, but watching a specific streamer is? 
---
You sound like an angry person who just seems jealous that a neckbeard makes his money by playing videogames. I would watch any streamer over a football game without question. Quality of content is subjective so trying to pass it off as that is just stupid
---
Well i don't plan to just to sit at Org and /who in phase 1. I plan to level up and play the game instead. It will be awesome.

I did not know this, and it does change my opinion slightly, but I will point out empathy for a family member is very quite different to that of a  stranger/acquaintance. I also don't subscribe to the family unit idea that is pervasive in the older generation's way of thought, many of the cultures with the strongest family units are doing very poorly in the world.

Yes, perfect post! I want to play on an international english speaking server.
---
True that! But remember that most of the farms (well not most but like 50% atleast) involve getting decent amount of gold per hour just by vendoring trash items and/or vendoring leather from skinning the mobs. The luxury items they can drop is just a bonus. Plus some people will take way longer to get to 40 than others, so by the time some people get to 40, others have cleared MC, making lucrative items sell to 'hardcore' players 😊 I guess I could've mentioned that in the video but I didn't think too much about it before reading your comment 😅 Thank you for the feedback! Do you know of any other good farms?
---
Exactly. Just stick to your guild if you can't take it.
---
We might want to consider opening ourselves up on the world as well, could do most of us some good...
---
When did this happen? A source would be much appreciated.
---
I know, that's the first thing it says in the OP, but it's not weird to assume that servers would be split into language regions, as they have been since launch in 2005. Combining them is such a weird decision that I don't think I was remotely considering it when reading the post.
---
Just fyi there is not a single person on any german realm that would say shaf instead of sheep. Never seen it in 14 years. Germand use the english words all the time in wow.
---
That seems to be the argument you want it to be. Relax, it's ok to watch streamers too.
---
For me it's not the game language but the language I use to socialise with others, it's so much easier in my native tounge than in english
---
Sorry for miss leading, I am more talking about the raid days and not the times. The chances of finding a guild for the days I'm free is smaller. Just from a mathematical point of view.
---
I think the only solution is that the community should create something akin to the NA version, avoidstreamers.  A lot of bigger german, french, and other language guilds and communities will try to make it known which server they are going to.  A fair sized population (by which I mean like 10%) will probably be trying to make it known where they are.  Another 10% will likely start the game, not see language-specific servers, and do some internet searches. Then redditors and forum-goers contribute a little. So, maybe 20-25% of the population makes an informed decision.   
---
Lot's of people are going to be disappointed and either quit or pay for transfers, but you need to look out for number one.  No server will ground itself as a German server organically.  Being on the front end of this and having a site such as that will help you to save yourself.
---
The reason I speak fluent English today is being forced to interact with other players in English while playing too much WoW during my teenage years. That led to incredible experiences and a mastery of a language that would never have happened had I had the option to play only with my fellow countrymen, without the need to communicate with players from other countries.

I dunno, I played on a wotlk private server for a few years and despite there being enough players for whom English wasn't their native language for them to form their own guilds if they wanted, people mixed together a lot and mostly spoke English. I don't remember any single language guilds besides I guess English speakers who simply didn't know other languages.

that server is pretty bad, the Portuguese had a designated pvp server on vanilla
---
most of the Portuguese people I knew either played on that pvp server or on an English one
---
&gt;Druids will be as weak as they were in Vanilla, and not the powerhouse that they are on private servers.
---
Nobody thinks they are a powerhouse on private servers. Only years ago on really bad PS where cobalt crusher/ blackvenom blade and weapon enchants stacked did they even do a lick of damage.
---
Thanks for expression sane opinions. There's so much complaining going around without any proposed solutions. Population management is a challenge in MMORPGs, and re-releasing the biggest one for three different audiences (people who want some nostalgia, people who are a fan of the gameplay, retail players who get it for no extra charge and will try it out) makes for basically a unique challenge in the history of MMORPGs.
---
My personal opinion is that if we give Blizzard an inch, they’ll charge you $25 for a mile. They were able to take a titan MMO and basically ruin it, I just don’t trust their discretion on things like this. While it may be an easy change and personally I don’t mind it, I don’t trust their better judgement and would rather they touch nothing.
---
Everything they touch turns into shit and micro transactions.
---
What does server stability have to do with the issue I am talking about? You are correlating 2 separate issues.
---
I don't see how sharding and layering are all that different when it comes to "tourists".
---
With layering, you might have 15k players on a server, but you could support that population with sharding, too. If layering is only intended to last the first few weeks, sharding 1-20 should have much of the same effect. The bulk of the player base will be concentrated at those levels.
---
Both options count on the server population dropping from 15k to more normal vanilla numbers over the first 4 months.
---
I think anyone can see this is detrimental to players, there is no doubt about that, whether it's a change or not is utterly irrelevant.
---
Also I know it's annoying, and I would have hoped that we didn't find ourselves in this situation. What's more I was hoping to play on an RP-PvP realm, and now they've reaffirmed their statement that this realm type won't even exist... so yeah, I'm pissed too... 
---
All I can think of is that blizzard is realizing the numbers weren't as high as everyone expected, which is a shame, I would have thought (and hoped) Classic was going to be MASSIVE... but if they're taking these very conservative and cheap business decisions one is left to wonder about the cause, and I think it's pretty clear blizz isn't seeing the numbers to afford a bigger investment.
---
Allow me to show you Asmongold's stream.
---
It's annoying because they never seem to pull that card on the super toxic. "I hate streamers" topics. This is way more important then some narcissist thinking people give a shit about his opinion on streamers. Europe's getting fucked hard. I'm not even European and it annoys me.

---
Just cause bfa isnt wow at its peak doesnt mean the players that all left want to play classic. Most likely they left to play either gw2 or ffxiv, another modern mmo. Or they stopped playing mmos and are playing something else. Probably 90% of the player base are quietly leaving and entering the game when they want, they know what they want to play and dont really fall under classic players but also just dont want to play bfa. At least until next week when they'll quietly resub and play for a bit again then leave again. That's how mmos work now for the largevmajorory of players.
---
agree that terrible is a perspective, but the skillgap from a top  5000 player to top 500 is way larger than a top 100 to top 10.
---
I'm sure 12k people on one server or 15h+ queues won't change a thing.
---
I would say being a gnome certainly increases your odds.  Paladin with blessing of freedom behind you too. Engineering for the reflect trinkets and grenades.  Free action potions.  I want to say there is a belt (cloth unfortunately) that removes roots.  The real benefit is when you can hit them, you will tear through them.  You just need to increase those opportunities.
---
No language specific server no money from me
---
You can do it by yourself on a private realm since thats the experience you are advocating.
---
It means they know how to prepare for a launch. They will be able to get layering to an appropriate, functional level by August.
---
They won't force anyone to spea kenglish, that's the problem at hand.
---
There are other options. I'm sure you know what they are, dear reader. No-layers, no-changes vanilla. You think you don't but you do.. But that's up to you to go there instead of here for a seething pot launch of pure triggering later in August.. It's going to be one hell of a KEK meltdown August.
---
Mfw molten core bosses have less mechanics than a bfa normal dungeon boss 😂
---
My server was one that was thrown into the pool with those servers back when they started cross realm LFR stuff. I can honestly say that that experience is a huge part of what ruined the game for some of us less hardcore people. Introducing a language barrier in content that has been made easier but still has mechanics you may need to explain or work together for is not fun. It was pure frustration. I can't say if those servers had the same feeling, being stuck with a bunch of people that couldn't understand them either.
---
Classic does not use 1.12 macro system though so things like casting a certain rank of heal depending on your target’s missing health will not be possible.
---
Down voted by noobs lol
---
I'd say tauren.
---
\-Few things look as cool as a geared up Tauren Warrior.
---
\-War stomp is amazing in 5 mans.
---
\-The bonus HP will be nice.
---
\-Extra attack range will help with positioning mobs.
---
Diablo is foreshadowing the Legion expansion and the multi summons Demonology locks. The zergling for the Black Empire?
---
"kurwa"
---
That's an interesting thought experiment.  
---
I've had discussions with good friends of mine about our views on certain things and why we have those views. It really comes down to your core beliefs and your experiences throughout life that shape the ways you think. It takes a lot to change someone's mind about something, especially if they truly believe in it.  
---
I'd recommend 'Change Your Mind' by Michael Pollan. It's less about trying to win someone over by words and explanation, and more about the power of psychedelics to actually change your views about the world. Extremely fascinating.
---
Blizzard clearly thinks it's been way too long since Europe has had a general war.
---
Dynamic respawns as they worked in vanilla only kicked in when large numbers of mobs were culled, not just based on population alone. 
---
I.e. you kill 1 mob it respawns in 4 minutes. You and 20 other people kill 2 mins each, they respawn in 30 seconds to a minute.
---
The inability to progress thru a cave would never occur because you would never kill enough mobs quickly enough to get it to dynamically modify respawn times
---
What you describe sounds like daft private server shenanigans
---
Proper dynamic respawning would never work that way, and would only entail modifications to the 6 starter zones and perhaps the 5 follow up zones
---
And it would preserve world pvp without “get out of bank free” invites and prevent glitching for black lotus and rich thorium veins
---
In that light, I think this is an extremely potent point.
---
You're giving up a lot for PoM + Pyro while leveling.  Can you elaborate a little on what draws you to that and how you plan to play this spec?  Providing useful advice is difficult without knowing those things.  At the very lease, drop Arcane Resilience.  The armor contribution isn't that great and you shouldn't be getting hit much anyway.
---
I expect it to be more, but we'll see.
---
You'd know since you probably never got past LFR because normal needed more than 3 brain cells right?
---
I will consede when it comes to Patchwerk.  My guild in vanilla couldn't even down him even with most in t2/t2.5.
---
My anus is ready. Unleash the hate.
---
void sac can be used if stunned though which gives you a huge HP bubble that is hard to burst through.
---
It didn't start until you could link skills and talents, that came later than items but I don't remember exactly. It might have been 2.0 or later, I don't think it was Vanilla proper. Before skill linking the jokes were different, like "Do an [Elementium Bar]rel Roll!".
---
I remember clearly though when the spam started. Once the first person did it, it never stopped.
---
Never bought one but they're hilarious. Here's one from a while back during some 4chan drama

---
The dead mines has always been one of my favorite dungeons. It’s always fun. I love going back in as a high-level and running through it by myself.
---
The one Im on isnt too bad. Then again half of the population is usually asleep when Im on. I have been in groups with some russians, germans etc. and it was hard to communicate but we managed with emotes and the universal jump up and down.
---
We wouldnt be able to raid like this but for easy 5 mans and Wpvp it wasnt bad.
---
Such as....?
---
Individual employees either dont have the power to make that happen or if they do because they're that high up wont make that happen because it's their head that would roll. This is absurdist conspiracy at its finest.
---
Trust me. I know and completely agree with you. 
---
That doesn't mean that you can say "if they did this, I'd be okay with it." Updated textures are basically the sole change that the game needed in the first place. Content can be added without changes the game or creating imbalances or easy roads with real money, Blizzard just doesn't understand that.
---
Sounds like this is personal to you
---
&gt;So youre stuck being unable to communicate with half the server and you already invested time into levelling there for X hours.
---
Hopefully, they would figure out what languages are spoken in chat before too long, and realize that it's time to change server...
---
I also got fucked by this playing on Hakkar, but from the other side. Meaning I'm Italian and playing in a server like this was a terrible experience, made me feel ashamed of being Italian. Most Italians I've come across on wow, before they added localized realms, had a good enough understanding of English to communicate if they wanted to. The problem is they didn't want to. Because they were toxic people who thought they were entitled to a localized realm and were actively trying to push out foreigners by speaking Italian only as a way to stick it to Blizzard. 
---
Me and my guild transferred out of Hakkar at the end of BC for this reason, and went to another realm with no major Italian community. Our guild turned international and, while still retaining an Italian core, we recruited people from all countries and spoke English in guild chat and voice during raids.
---
I still play on English servers to this day and would never even consider playing on Italian speaking servers. I imagine the same thing will happen again if they don't add localized servers, even though most Germans, French and Spanish people can speak English fine they will not for the same reasons people didn't on Hakkar back then.
---
You are describing sharding, not layering. That isn't how layering works.
---
poo in sock then wipe with outside of sock
---
Mages had a way to open locked chests actually. They would juste use their magic to break the lock.
---
Roast beef, it's a French term that's similar to calling a German a Kraut, but targeted towards the English.
---
Sharding and layering are not identical. Stop acting like you know it won’t be fixed, you don’t know. You have no way of knowing.
---
I think the community needs to just shut their mouth on this one and deal with it.
---
I am sorry but your comment does not make any sense. You can sit at Org doing your /who spam in private servers also.
---
Oh
---
Ya 30 mins of smooth questing followed by potentially 2 months of playing on an empty server with a fucked economy.
---
Personally I would prefer layering for a little while until the populations stabilize. I don't want to get merged into a streamer server or something, lol.  
---
One of the last killers for me was when the servers merged back in MoP. It's one of my last memories before I quit.
---
Avec plaisir ;)
---
From my understanding, layering let's you keep things much more stable while letting in way more players. Unless you are purposefully exploiting layers, you won't even notice it happening. All your friends and guild members SHOULD always be on your "layer."
---
This also means you can basically have servers within servers. If your nerds with spreadsheets predict 80% of players will quit in the first three months (and trust, nerds with spreadsheets are trying to predict this), you can let WAY more people into a server and then as people bolt, you slowly fiddle the numbers so each server within a server has proper balance. The more people in one server, instead of spread out over multiple servers, the easier it is to keep making these adjustments while things stabilize.
---
This is the 38th thing to make me ashamed of my country today and it's not even noon on the East coast.
---
Maura is tho, you can AOE the 40s =D Or, Team AOE BRD room 1
---
I agree.  I always really enjoyed the situations where communication wasn't crystal clear and interactions required some effort
---
Welp, if the artist is fine, good deal then. As I said, looks great :)
---
Blizzard definitely has less confidence than most of the community seems to. I'd like to know if it's because of metrics that they have access to or because they still don't believe anyone will actually prefer vanilla in the long run.
---
But it's not irrelevant whether it's a change or not. If this was the way the realms worked in 1.12 we wouldn't stand a chance against the no changes crowd. It's only because this is a change that we have any hope of reversing it with enough outcry.
---
Streamers aren't really the problem, these people are the problem.
---
Since players can manipulate which layer they're on, why shouldn't Blizzard be able to funnel everyone to a single layer?
---
I wouldn't call it a luxury. What makes them any different than the Brits for are forging ahead confident that everyone is suppose to understand them? In large parts of the world French is still used as a universal language rather than English. 
---
This is going to suck for everyone involved.
---
US companies have a monopoly so they can get away with ridiculous prices and speeds.
---
I played a p server the other week to get my fix. Got to level 10 and quit. No point to it. But I'm going to buy a 6 month sub Aug 13
---
If there's only one button for both charge and intercept I can't see Intercept's cooldown. I plan to use simpler macros than these, seeing all my options and them having constant values has a mnemonic quality to it. If I hide all my options behind a wall of text macro I'll just forget that I have some of the options I do. Prefer to just have shift+keybind and keybind separated than having 1 button that's overly complex. Simple targeting macros, and equipment macros are a must, stance changing macros are ok (but can make you waste Rage) but hiding button combinations that you'll use anyways in 1 button would just make me not use all the combinations. A good player will micro their pet, will have their targeting figured out, will be able to put their pet in one target and hit another target just fine tbh.
---
You, your friends, and their friends could still all go on an international server from what I understand. You're talking about not wanting the language servers because you are worried your friends want/prefer those and you don't want to learn their language to play with them so you'd rather they be stuck playing in English, which they don't want to learn better.
---
Oh I remember hearing of that, I Wonder if it was in later or earlier builds
---
Click on the link, solve your problems.
---
Well, this has convinced me not to roll on launch day. I'm going to wait a week or two until all the servers have sorted themselves out. Then I can avoid servers that the streamers are on, and I can avoid unofficial non-english-speaking servers.
---
German speaking *
---
It's because the letters are pronounced differently in other languages. They could be using the alphabet but the pronounciaton of the letters is different than the language you're using.
---
This was one server and it was never 50k so nice one there. Blizzard can easily just have many servers open and do this.
---
Understood, so is each sock a 1 use thing, or can you squeeze 2-3 loads in there... I gues it depends on teh sock?
---
&gt;  the fact that he has built his life around caring for his sick mother should put his morality above reproach

VanCleef is the final boss of Dead Mines. If you are spamming LFG with DM then you end up with a bunch of 31+ players thinking you are wanting to go to Dire Maul. Using VC clears a lot of the confusion.
---
I’m sorry about that...
---
Because Layers are completely agnostic to whatever zone you're in.
---
You can squish the macros down a lot, but I expanded them out so they'd be easier to read.

---
While it might not be directly balanced for esports, they have strived to make the game a lot more competetive and in line with esports nature. Hyper balance, streamlining, speedrunning etc.  
---
These things do affect every part of their new games, including wow. Hyper balance is ruining how classes work and feel, for the sake of everything being balanced, viable and competetive. (not that theyve ever been able to achieve that)
---
Honestly, I would sincerely like to disagree. The difference between top 500 and top 5000 is generally how much they care. If they were to sit down with someone from my guild for an hour and actually do what they tell them to, install what they do, in a week a top 5000 player will be top 500 caliber.
---
The difference between top 500 and top 10, or even top 100 and top 10, is just monstrous. It's intuition and such deeply entrenched instincts and knowledge that you have no hope of reaching that calibre within a year, or even years of playing, unless you're exceptionally gifted. Loads of my friends moved on to top 50 etc guilds to trial. ALL of them came crawling back.
---

That's what they've said is going to happen, but if you're sitting in the meetings at Blizzard feel free to let us know.
---
I know it is going to be limited. But 1.12 was so mighty, you could literally run primitive bots through macros alone.
---
Are you sure smart healing will no longer be possible? It would seem weird that you cannot even check the targets current health and conditionally heal. Especially with the help of addons.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I would welcome smart healing being gone. It’s a bad habit IMO.
---
People around here get pretty triggered by anything named LFG - I wonder if more of the hardcore base would react better to a name like "Buddy System" or "Instance Friend Finder" to differentiate it from Retail's automated/teleporting LFG system and emphasize the fact that there still is a huge social element to it. 
---
Either way, I have it on my list as a day 1 addon! Really excited to be able to simultaneously be out in the world while still able to look for groups.

You’ve got 5 groups for sorting stuff, and each group is like 18 slots max. It’s not really an issue.

I apologize, so far I haven't been able to source an official response to the mechanics of this. Outside of finding someone currently in beta access to test obtaining a Clearcasting proc in the middle of their Missile channel, I can't give a definitive reply. I've seen consensus lean more towards reasoning that Clearcasting procs on initial cast, not on damage ticks. If I happen upon beta access in the near future, I'll try to remember to report back if the answer hasn't been found yet.

Well, he does have breathing issues. Don't think he likes it too
---
RemindMe! 66 days
---
That's a fact
---
Europeans have a real issue. The American thing is just a bunch of annoying little beardlings finding a new thing to screech about. Women getting a break for 10 minutes lol. Avoiding Streamers will be easy as fuck as every major streamer will be on the same realm.
---
As for the linking in chat, it would be nice if the server could automatically translate the linked quest/item/etc. I know this is not the case in the beta or retail but it would be a simple solution if Blizzard doesn't want to add language restricted servers.
---
In the other hand looking for a group is already easy. Dungeons aren't that hard to translate and named mobs have the same name (excluding adjectives like 'burned', 'fallen'... you know what I mean)
---
But yeah, in the end I am totally for language restricted servers (or national servers, I don't know how the correct term would be)
---
I've seen 2 deleted comments by moderator on another locked thread.
---
It took 2 comments to lock a whole fucking thread.

&lt;you think you do&gt; lmao
---
With the way the game is currently setup Blizzard is putting all of their money on Classic failing. All the evidence points towards them expecting the game to die down significantly. On the chance it doesn't die down after a few months, though, have fun waiting in 5k queues every day because a streamer just happened to decide to roll on your server. Even if you for whatever reason don't personally mind the cancerous "communities" that surround them you very likely just suddenly won't get to play. Now you get to revolve your raid nights around whether the top streamer happens to be playing, because then half your guild might not be able to log in in time to make it.
---
I don't think that streamers dropping servers will kill them, and I don't think that is the main argument that anyone has made. It's just a throwaway idea on a list of dozens of ways streamers can completely ruin the experience people are looking for in Classic. I'm not sure why half of your post is about what happens if they quit the game. I'd be ecstatic if they quit the game and were on my server, because then people might be able to enjoy the game.
---
&gt; - Unintended / "accidental" change of layers when accepting party invite
---
This is where ALL the exploitative videos are coming from.  The video taker accepts an invite to join a group and the world changes around them.
---
The best solution I can think of off the top of my head:
---
1. There is a prompt to shift layers after accepting a group invite that you can ONLY interact with in a rest area.
---
5. Until you explicitly accept it, grouping with someone not in your layer just leaves you unable to interact or see one other until you zone in to a dungeon.  Kind of like WM grouping with non-WM.
---
Outside of those scenarios, if you're casually grouping to quest it's going to be with someone you see (who is already on your layer).
---
This will prevent all these abrupt transitions.
---
Does anyone know what version of blizzards macro script I should write for and what the rules are? I need to find / write a ton of druid macros!
---
I am STUMPED finding a good source of working macros for classic. I only tested it for a few hours weeks ago on stress test and none of the classic macros worked out of the box.
---
&gt; reading a book or watching a movie? 
---
Books and movies have a structured narrative, they're produced with the purpose of entertainment, but often they will be provoking, interesting, challenging.
---
I'd rather binge films with &lt;5 rating on IMDB than watch dullards in a state of arrested development simply consuming entertainment.
---
Oh, streamers provide their own "content" you'll tell me? Is content getting rekt and immediately accusing people of streamsniping? Is content when something doesn't go their way and just start repeating the same sentence over and over again in a whiny voice until they get what they want?
---
But deary me I'm being prejudice against peoples choice of entertainment! Too fucking right, if someone watches Jerry Springer/reality TV shows or Pawn Stars/poverty porn or Love Island I'm certainly going to be judging them.
---
Even when something interesting happens on stream (which is what, maybe once in a 6 hour stream?), you'd be better off just watching the VOD linked here or on youtube. Watching monotony for 6 hours for 1 redeeming moment is insanity.
---
But hardcore stream followers don't watch because the streamers are entertaining, they watch people who reaffirm their own beliefs. They think the streamer is their friend and they'll bend over backwards to try and get noticed by them for 15 minutes of fleeting companionship. There's a lot of mediocre players who think they're hot shit, so they watch other mediocre players who think that, and start making the same excuses and mentality.
---
Didn't they specifically say that this is one of the things from the new API that will be disabled for Classic??
---
Yes, blizzard have made sure 1 macro rotations are not possible anymore
---
You have to click to place the circle. You could actually use a cursor condition to do it automatically, like you're expecting, but they changed that function in patch 7.something. 
---
If your  pet still doesn't move, then there's a bug with Move To that needs to be reported.
---
Honestly, I think they are going to try to transition as much of the classic audience to retail as they can. I think they will say stuff like "We want to roll back some of the class paring, and really make the classes more distinct", or "we are thinking about a level squish. We want to give you something meaningful every level, and 120 is too many. We are thinking 60.". 
---
Stuff like that. This stuff cannot get everyone, and they know that. But they want to support a single game that appeals to a mass market. This is because they made a deliberate choice to turn wow into that over the course of like a decade and a half. That's what they want. They also want a platform with frankly, VASTLY more monetization. the Average revenue per user on retail has to be MUCH higher than classic. Paid server transfers, faction swaps, mounts, level boosts, and I think the transmog system can be skipped for money?). 
---
Frankly, I think that they were being very serious when they said they would not develop new content for wow classic. I think that could change, possibly, in the future (we see all sorts of wierd stuff, like for example, bungie SOMEHOW escaping activision (how did that even happen? why did activision allow that?).
---
But plan A is just to try to convert classic users to retail users. Then sell them a level boost and a horsie made of stars.
---
Stress servers aren't the best representation of what layering is actually going to do on Live though. They were intentionally manipulating layers to add additional stress.
---
No way man. Playing with the huge language barrier was always my most unenjoyable part of private servers. Almost everything becomes a bigger challenge, from making groups and joining guilds all the way down to small talk, inflection, and meaning behind a sentence. I can't count how many people i've accidentally offended and it became a thing because someone didn't understand a youthinism or an implied meaning a native speaker would have understood.
---
Did you not read it? Server queues only exist in today's server state to solve overcrowding... so without layering you have two options, allow overcrowding or add a queue. With layering you solve overcrowding without a queue. It's pretty basic.
---
Blizzard has pretty fantastic cinematic department as well.   
---
I think they know what they are doing.
---
Wouldn't that idea of cartography be similar to what archaeology did before?
---
East of SFK there is a field of murlocs.  This is a safe area you don't need to flag in. They are close together, all melee (IIRC), and there is no quest to kill them.  You will generally only see other people if they are running from the quest south of there to the quest north of there.  You can start that at 20.
---
By 22...maybe the barrens in that little camp to the southeast, or the castle in the middle on the east side.  This is a safe area you don't need to flag in. They both have quests, but limited in quests, and the enemies are mostly melee and in tight groupings.
---
After that, I think Azurite mines in hillsbrad, which has a few quests but not a ton, and the alliance shouldn't mess with you too much.  Heavy concentration of mostly melee guys.
---
By the end of that you should be level 29 or so...I can't think of where to go after that.  In general, you want to go to places where the Alliance is less likely to be.
---
A lot of the Chinese (on pservers, at least) know enough English to communicate inside the game. But, the Chinese do maintain their own chat channels and it's not always possible to read what they're saying when they type in a different character set. Blizzard pland to keep the Russians separate for this reason, not everyone can display Cyrillic.
---
Not right now, but in a year it will be.
---
my early game friend list building took place in zul farrak and sunken temple, which many players never got to because they quit before then.
---
Why not have language separated serves at launch and merge in the event of too low pop?
---

This one mate
---
[On the German Classic Forums for example.](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/de/wow/t/community-gildenprojekt-deutschsprachiger-wow-classic-server/34106)
---
i think you vastly overestimate how much of a dick people are to each other. My server had sizable Spanish speaking population and we got along fine.
---
That or you EU players are just complete and total asses to eachother.
---
Not trusting an organization with a history of lying to its users is not a fallacy, it is evidence based reasoning,
---
That's exactly what I will do and most people will. When I play HotS it's another thing. That's just about some infos for this one game of 20 minutes. But in an RPG I will speak German. German by itself is much more flexible than English even if you speak English as first language but as it is only my second it's not enough. I can exchange information, I build complete and usually correct sentences. I have an okish number of words to use and have no problems to read or watch streams in English. 
---
But with all that said even I prefer to speak German. I played on a beta internationally and it was nice to have all those people from all over the world. But this will be Europe only anyways and I will join a German guild anyways. I see no reason to be on a server with 50% of the people speaking at max basic English. This is not what I want to be my virtual home for 2 years or whatever time. I want fluent communication. Not with 30% but with about everybody on the server.
---
do you know exactly what macro system they are using and its syntax rules? when I was trying to write some macros on stress test I couldn't get anything very complex to work (stance related macros, castsequence appears not to work?) . I tried BFA and vanilla macros
---
I trolled lfr with heroic/ mythic gear. Even when I pulled the entire raid, we didn’t wipe lol
---
&gt;  In large parts of the world French is still used as a universal language rather than English. 
---
*In large parts of the world French is still used as a universal language rather than English.*
---
The British wasn't the only empire. Respecting each other's languages is how we get along.
---
this is a standard pvp scenario over resources
---
resolve it with pvp
---
Exactly, we're getting classic. I always thought we wouldn't be able to go home again, but here we are. I haven't been this excited about a launch day in a very long time.
---
I don't know the last time Blizzard released something that wasn't met with complaining/hatred. And the hate isn't even informed, it's just parroting and gets us nowhere.
---
I wish people would stop wanting to be outraged about stuff.
---
Your reading comprehension is pure dogshit, the issue isnt about Org /whoing, its about the entire game world for me being empty. The /whoing of the people in Org was to highlight the fact that the server was very much full and yet the game world as it appeared to me was 100% completely devoid of any other players because of layering.
---
Do you really need this broken down further?
---
Not that I'm aware of. Be happy to review a source for that though if you have one.
---
I'd be happy with plenty of changes because I'm confident in my ability to design a good game. But I'm not even remotely confident in Blizzards ability to design anything besides ethically questionable psychology manipulating casino simulators, so it's a moot conversation.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_countries_by_population
---
Then add in the culture of how many of the bigger countries have a history of rejecting English and how they've grown up on dubbed media. 
---
It doesn't matter if you end up on the unofficial Swedish server because there won't be enough Swedish players to dominate it, and they won't have any issues communicating in English.
---
it appears you can also just log out to character screen, login on another toon, and then log back to your main to switch layers.
---
horrible analogy. literally zero added to the discussion other than your own misguided opinion
---
Nope.
---
My understanding is that the Beta servers were using the current phasing, not necessarily the final layering. 
---
An example of this was people interacting with Friends and Family Beta members well into the 40s/50s back when level limit was 30.
---
If you want to play a class specifically for the challenge of making interesting and powerful macros, Druid and Warrior are at the top due to stance/form dancing. Pet classes are a decent second, followed by hybrids. Rogues can be really complicated too, and really help you reach their already high skill ceiling. Probably the least complex classes are Mages and Priests, who can mostly just tuck in lower ranked spells and alternatives into single button presses.
---
The huge drop off is going to be between 3-6 months. And by the time everyone will be spread over lvls 1-60 and from doing dungeons and raids. And when phase 2 pulls out honor, layering will definitely not be wanted.
---
TBH if I had a 49,999 seat empty stadium to watch an event it would be ballerific.
---
1. Alliance tends to win AV more often and AV gear is incredible when freshly level 60.
---
2. Alliance always have a better 'group mentality' in PvP with less elitists.
---
3. Stormwind and Ironforge are amazing city hubs while Orgrimmar is the only decent main city on Horde. 
---
4. Perception, Stoneform and Escape Artist are incredible vs Rogues(the most hated class). 
---
5. Westfall &gt; Barrens
---
Great, thanks.
---
Server merges are better than Blizzard realizing they still haven't dropped the layer system when most of the pop are already in their 30s.
---
Blizzard has dealt with high queue times in the past. Pretty simple solution: 
---
More servers and offer free transfers to newly added servers.
---
It's been done and they have the resources to do it. Hands down. If high queue times are a CONSISTENT problem, people will scream on the forums and something will be done soon™.
---
I don't think we're talking about same things anymore. English is without a doubt *lingua franca*(ironically) of the world. And British Empire is indeed the reason why Brits and all their descendants are well within  reason to expect people to speak their language wherever they go.
---
You are right that France had an Empire as well, but do you really intend to compare US/Australia and many more to Morocco or Vietnam?
---
More diplomatically put: your tank hasn’t quite learned how to hold threat yet.
---
“Hey mom here’s $10 I earned in cash, can I make a 10$ purchase using your card?” Lmao what kind of parents did you boys have?!
---
During the years I've played WoW, I've consistently been in World 200 guilds, multi glad, consistently parsed 99% for DK and Rogue, top 1k in the world for Mythic plus in Legion.
---
My opinion is worth 10 times yours.
---
I was just wondering if I had full beta or just stress test cause ive seen other pics or videos where it will saw "stress test "
---
No it’s the just the pre down load:/ you can play the lvl 15 beta server tho if you have active game time
---
Thats not what he is saying. He's not saying they are easy to master; he's saying they are not hard to play.
---
Rogue PVE grinding macro, bound to 1 key:
---
If not in combat and not stealthed, activate stealth.
---
If stealthed and targeting an enemy pickpocket them (with autoloot turned on) and use a default opener.
---
If not stealthed and in combat and targeting an enemy, use SS.
---
If in combat and not stealthed and not targeting an enemy, target the next enemy.
---
    /cast [nostealth,nocombat] Stealth
---
    /cast [stealth,harm] Pickpocket; Garrote
---
    /cast [nostealth,harm,combat] Sinister Strike
---
    /targetenemy [nostealth,noharm,combat]
---
Isn't it simply easier to open new servers rather than closing / merging them? Without the obvious economic standpoint, one could also argue that it is the "natural" way to go.
---
How many people are required (let say at peak) to consider a server to be filled up?
---
ah ok thanks
---
"Live" Classic WoW is a US-only Stress Test closing later today.
---
Or you can just play the game and keep farming mobs while another chest spawns lmao.  The effort required for people to do this is not worth the reward.
---
It's like watching a youtuber. It's about a personality they enjoy, discussing (in this case playing) a topic they are interested in.
---
The community is a load of hot garbage, but I totally understand the concept and what users get out of the experience. It's really not a bad idea overall.
---
U ever met a french Player?
---
Piss off
---
Yeah, there was an uproar a little while ago about a Rogue using "@mouseover" to blind a different target while maintaining combo points on his current one. If you change targets, you lose your combo points, so normally you have to sacrifice them for a clutch blind.
---
Like I've said, macros literally make you more powerful.
---
It's the sloooow moments we will lose people, 47-55
---
But just keep in mind there is NO rush to 60 :) you might play for 5 hours one day and get half a level.
---
Dumbass, you dont know, thats the real "there it is".
---
Right now it doesnt work, again I say to you which is more likely that they fix it in 2 fucking months or its not solved and is as it is today.
---
You naivete is fucking adorable, when its the same shit you'll just play retarded like you never thought it would be fixed anyways.
---
You don't end up on one big community according to... A private server?
---
It takes people willing to try to communicate to start the entertainment, I've very very rarely had any issues having a laugh with those who can speak very little English. You shouldn't base what's coming on a private server experience.
---
It's worth it to get the job just to put the two weeks' notice in. It's like a little vacation right there at the end. It's where I get to say my favorite phrase at work, which is "I don't care, I'm about to quit."
---
Alright, we're having a good time.
---
I think most people who play WoW will agree is it's nice to play WoW with people from other countries. I've met people from many, many countries and had some amazing experiences with them. It's not and will never be about the nationality of the player, in my opinion, the more diversity the more interesting it is.
---
 It is about the language for many of us, regardless of nationality. A lot of us are monolingual, despite our efforts, and communicating with those who only speak a different language is going to be virtually impossible. I think Blizzard need to realise that it doesn't divide people to have seperate language servers, it just caters to their customers preferences. For example Germans don't have to play on a German server but a German server gives an option to those who can't speak any other language or would rather speak their native language. Too many languages on a server will only have one outcome, to divide the community.
---
Can you please pm me as well.
---
I think the number of people that played thanksgiving weekend and the number of people shit posting on reddit that the sky is falling is drastically different.  Hell, the folks at PA gave a bashing review in January or February after four months of the servers not be stable enough to play the game.
---
Warrior always looked great but managing stances and abilities looks like a pain.  I can see macro's really making it manageable, but I'd definitely not be one to come up with something as crazy complex (and awesome) as your hunter macro here (which I might steal to actually use as I'm planning to make one).   The charge example is probably about as heavy as I'd get into them.
---
&gt;No you're just a whiny baby confusing want with need
---
Nope. Haven't heard a single player that actually wants layering, only people that see why Blizzard are implementing it and have some actual understanding.
---
You're so far off how layering actually works it's not even worth mentioning it for 15th time since you'll never get it anyway. I suggest you read up on what layering will actually do before you go on your next rant.
---
You can't never be sure that paying those gms would cost more than the money that players who don't want to speak english would bring.
---
I'd add that bilingual eng-fr eng-sp eng-de capable persons are very easy to find...
---
Really, i don't think we are talking about millions of dollars here, it looks like they don't even want to try to make it a success !
---
I have WoW Classic listed under "Live", is this just stress test? It tells me I can't play without sub.
---
No it isn’t... god forbid the starting zone mobs are camped for the first 24 hours and you have to grind to level 5... this was how every launch was up until like wod and we all survived. Going to absolutely shit on the classic experience by suppportimg this layering bullshit
---
Its changing because they are testing it.
---
&gt; Oh, streamers provide their own "content" you'll tell me?  
---
no, I'll tell you that the argument you're making is as good against watching streams as it's good against you being on the computer right now. you ought not be on the computer because there's a healthier, more provoking, interesting and challenging alternative somewhere else.
---
don't worry, it's a really bad argument, so I'm not going to hold you against it.   
---
&gt; But hardcore stream followers don't watch because the streamers are entertaining, they watch people who reaffirm their own beliefs. They think the streamer is their friend and they'll bend over backwards to try and get noticed by them for 15 minutes of fleeting companionship. 
---
I'd really like you to point to where and who these people are, because historically speaking they don't exist. it's just parroting. but by all means, give us the numbers. even if that was true, why do you use the extreme of the extreme viewers as an argument against the hundreds of thousands of other people who just want to chill for a few hours?
---
Toxic games like Dota and Rocket league, even Cs to a standard can't really be brought up in comparison lol. Competitive games like that aren't really related so you should be a bit more open minded about it...
---
I always thought hitting the sort button in bagnon was the easiest way to organize.
---
dude ive played it on stress test. i know exactly how it works.
---
That's exactly what's happening the other way round. Calm yourself down and go get some fresh air you arse.
---
The burden of proof is on the one making the claim, not the one doubting it. If you try to prove or state something as fact, be ready to bring up sources or don't try at all.
---
the guys who perfected mmos dont work at blizz anymore
---
can i see your professions sheet?? im trying to figure out how to split them between me and my bro and my GF
---
I got it too, downloaded it and then realized I can't actually play it because no active sub.
---
Toppest of Keks.  I have no reason to reactivate my sub until at least the week we are allowed to reserve our names.
---
Literal moron lol
---
The problem is for people like finns and other smaller countries playing on a english or internationals server is normal.
---
German players for example are playing on only german servers for 14 years now and we don't know why Blizzard suddenly think its a good idea to throw the big languages into one pool.
---
Good time to be a Rogue &lt;3
---
Yeah, banning a thread like that would be the dumbest thing I've ever seen. And that says something because I've been to Cleveland before.
---
I used Clique, and Healbot for 5 man farming. My max rank heals where 1,2,3,4 down ranked all bound to Shift/Caps/Ctrl mods on my mouse. 
---
.. my mage was pretty nooby, but, really FB spam didnt need complex macros. My mind was blown by my first Mouseover Ply and COunter spell macros.
---
People here act like Classic and Blizzard's decisions aren't driven by significant statistics. Bringing back Classic is huge in terms of the branding of the game, and risking taking your player base away from retail (with upcoming expansions and microtransactions galore). Blizzard wouldn't put resources into something they didn't think would result in a net gain. 
---
I'm not defending any of their decisions, but people around here act like they have more knowledge about Blizzard's business dealings and data analytics department than, well, Blizzard.
---
Meet swampletics
---
&gt;No, your reading comprehension is pure dogshit. I simply said i wont be doing /who in Org but instead play and have fun.
---
Hey retard, thats why I said you can do this on a private realm right now where you can go play by yourself since thats the fucking issue you fucking spastic retard.
---
&gt;This was too difficult for you to understand and started drooling &amp; talk about private servers. Sorry but you don't make any sense.
---
Holy fuck you are a legit helmet head sperg.
---
Because then those servers will push away English speaking players. And they dont believe any one language but Russian and English will have enough people to prop up a server.
---
Keep in mind not only would we be dividing the already niche classic crowd between EU and US, we're gonna divide it further into half a dozen languages and then AGAIN between horde and alliance.  We can guess at numbers but I'm sure blizz has way more accurate numbers to guess from.  And in the end it's all a guess. 
---
Make a language server and then not enough people roll on it or it dies very quickly and now you have a stranded server that you have to merge into another language anyway. That's a lot harder on a community than to let people form their own cliques and communicate on their own where to meet. And while it may suck to have to speak across language barriers,  it would suck worse to be on a dead server.
---
I never claimed to “know,” boss. I said they have time to get it worked out. I said they are testing it now to have it ready for August.
---
 Clearly you are the naive one who went into a test expecting things to work perfectly.
---
Again, you're comparing toxic competitive gaming to wow. You can't make that comparison.
---
Watching doesn't = spending 200 hours leveling a character
---
The kind that would say 'no you already spend too much on that game'.
---
Which I think is perfectly reasonable tbh.
---
Lmao shhhhh
---
Actually i bought a legal Key but I changed my motherboard and it's really a pain in the ass to transfer it to my new computer(windows is linked to the motherboard)
---
I need to log in with my old motherboard, link the key to a windows account and disable it on the old computer, log in that windows account with my new computer and link it.... I'm just too lazy to do it and I don't even see the activate windows stuff anymore, it's been like 8 months
---
Before windows 10 we didn't need to do that you just entered the key on your New computer and it would automatically disactivate on your old....
---
he wanted to join a group, the group leader was on another layer.  In order to play with the group leader the group was put onto a different layer than the one he joined on.  It is not terrible it is logical.
---
spot the retail baby with this one simple trick
---
I'm going to go against the grain with this one.  Hpally/Warrior/X seems like a no brainer.  But I'd honestly go more for Shadow Priest/SL Lock/Druid.  That combination can mana burn/drain a holy paladin dry and has enough CC to make it a 1v3/2v3 for the entire fight.  Between the HoTs/Shield and vampiric touch there should be enough sustained healing to outlast any Warrior/Hpal/X group.
---
That makes sense, and you did also mention here and there increased GPH methods such as skinning, other mobs to kill during downtime, etc... I suppose it’s just my “rushing mentality”. As far as other farm spots, I personally prefer the more niche/specialized farms like stealth  dungeon runs or AoE class spots or hunter solos, just due to the fact it adds another element to class identity/forethought as well as (like professions to a degree) the fact that you are one of those who chose your class who can consistently and reliably farm a particular material, item, gold in this fashion. While single player games have their perks, the fact that certain players are the ones with certain items in this games promotes community or at the very least, interaction among players.
---
And when all Germans leave the unofficial German server the server will be dead. That's a stupid idea. If for some reason the German server(s) are totally underpopulated they may be merged. No problems. But I really doubt it and think it's much better this way around. Coming up with German servers after 6 month when lots of people did not even start the game in the first place because of this bad start it may be to late and even if not it will cause issues (like dead servers)
---
I had a macro chain set up to AFK grind in Feralas on my Hunter, It was something along an assist pet, (set on aggressive) to auto attack its target.

That's exactly my argument, if you look at those replying to me though... The toxic side have already reered their ugly faces

Wallpaper pictures are on point, yours?

Fair assumption by blizzard.

Now show me proof. I want to see number of players playing by region on the beta and these stress tests.

Better yet I want to see them post launch for a few days.

Then I want to see free server transfers when they realize how wrong they are so people can play with their own language of players

Wow way to start this comment off with a bad take. AOE grinding is a more efficient use of your time if you can do it so it’s perfect if you power level to 26 to get first licks at a point(and are able to finish your level farm before the other fresh 26 get there with the same plan)
---
Plenty of highly skilled mages will post very strong 60 times on these fresh servers even on pvp servers.
---
This doesn’t even get into my preferred aoe grind which is leveling an alt a month or so after release logging in to check if my pulls are free and if so putting in some leveling time and if not then dicking around on my main instead. It’s fun, relaxing and efficient
---
Is it idiotic to put down a mage that is not aoe grinding? Of course, if you’re not first to these spots you will be lucky to be able to aoe at all and even if they by some miracle are free picking it’s a game! play it how you would like, particularly when it comes to leveling, but to say aoe grinders are idiots? Nah
---
So at a level 15 cap you ran to a zone with no one else in it and abused layering so that you can farm something that no one else was fighting for?
---
This situation will literally never exist in launch.  There will always be a group of people fighting for the chest.  The only reason you were able to get 7 was because you were literally the only person in a level 30-45 zone at level 15.
---
"*So many people are so interested in what other people’s interests are and just need to worry about their own*"
---
Why arent you then doing this? Why do you care that they are complaining?
---
Bad times for the hard content crowd then. Oh well.
---
It's realistic to expect significant tourist dropoff after the first few weeks, and has nothing to do with expected failure of the game.  Simple fact is many people are not going to stick with it.
---
Layering is a good solution, because it allows server populations to normalize to a healthy population.  Without it, most servers would reduce to a lower-than-optimal playerbase, requiring blizz to start merging servers which is it's own host of problems.
---
That was my original incentive for making macros on my Warlock. I saw players with cool custom icons for their spells, and they'd fold all their niche curses into one button. It was like they had made their own spells.
---
I was so proud to get my UI down to just my action bar, my pet bar, and the middle right bar (so it'd be symmetrical with the pet bar).
---
Trash take

When in Hots, easters europeans will just write in their own language while the 4 teammates can't understand a word being said.

With the way he treats people who disagree with him in this thread, I  have no doubt he'll be playing alone.

And you continue to show your awesome communication skills.

---
if only there was another demographic that could help the test, MAYBE EU?
---
&gt; Now, this massive dropout rate for Nostalrius was almost exclusively because OVERCROWDING and the FACT that it was a private server. When you have 15-20k CONCURRENT players for weeks, the casual player (which is the vast majority of the player base) who can only log at PEAK hours, and play for like 2 hours, will absolutely quit playing, because for him, the leveling experience would be a nightmare
---
No layering is clearly worse because some streamer showed 1 clip of weird behavior and maybe a few top end grinders will get a couple extra devilsaur leather.
---
&gt;I never claimed to “know,” boss.
---
"It will be fine."
---
"They will be able to get layering to an appropriate, functional level by August."
---
You are legit a retard, I'm done trying to communicate with someone so malformed in the head.
---
Same here. The other replies I'm getting are extremely toxic and self focused, it's a shame and I hope people like them haven't had a single input on a decision made for classic, though I fear they will have done...
---
I’m gonna keep questing just find a lock to summon thanks
---
Maybe but they def know more about it then us I’m sure. Don’t most mmos do something similar? I could’ve sworn final fantasy did too.
---
Because people are killing the hype?
---
Thanks for taking the time to post this. I've been playing for years and run several dozen keybinds. I'm even a Software Engineer by profession, but don't spend too much time with macros in WoW. I'd like to explore setting something up for classes with many skills that are good to bind, but too numerous to clutter on the screen with (Shaman is a great example).  
---
With your Hunter example, I'm not sure it will work in my case. I keybind tilde(\~) through 6 and Shift-tilde through 6 on all characters as a baseline of binds. If I use this macro on my hunter in game, the shift functionality seems to break in the macro as it's trying to run my shift-5 keybind instead of the mod on the macro for example. Any suggestions that don't involve removing/changing my existing keybinds?
---
I say bring on the divides! Hell, sounds like it'd make PvP more entertaining.
---
Actually in French it's a thing.
---
So fucking ironic omg
---
A lot of the streamers on that list are irrelevant to WoW.  Maybe relevant during launch, but the variety streamers like Lirik, Shroud, Forsen, Timthetatman, Summit, Greek etc aren't going to be playing long.  They'll go back to doing their own thing after some time. 
---
 I am guessing that most of the pvpers will be rolling on the same server so they can keep playing against each other, so hopefully there will just be 1 server to avoid and the others are fine.  Most of them aren't a problem imo, it'll just be Soda/Asmon that are #1 avoid at all costs.
---
&gt; Yeah we've tested it and it sucks. 
---
Keeping in mind that layering is going to be temporary, what about it sucks in your opinion? In my experience it works better than sharding. As far as I know it's either this or login queues for launch.
---
&gt; All your friends and guild members SHOULD always be on your "layer."
---
I'm not against layering and realize why it's temporary needed, however there are a lot of nuances that happen naturally that makes your quoted comment above not completely accurate.
---
Unless you only group with friends/guildies, you will often involuntarily move between layers quite a bit. For example, if everything starts off as true for player A and Player B, but they are both on different layers(along with each of their respective friends/guild mates), the moment those 2 players wish to group via World chat for a dungeon or quest, then one of those players will have to "phase" into the others layer. Now this won't phase all of their friends/guildies with them and therefor will no longer see those friends/guildies naturally on their current layer. And since you don't "phase" after leaving a group, you will remain on a different layer than those friends/guildies until you phase back somehow. 
---
Maybe after logging out and back in, you'll be back with your friends/guildies, however this has not been my experience on Beta. The only time I "phase" is via an invite with someone on another layer, and the invitee doesn't always "phase" either. I was once asked to invite someone to my layer because streamers were dueling out front of org, but after I invited them, I phased to their layer instead.
---
Layering is the lesser of 2 evils for me since I'd rather actually be able to play in the early days, however I hope it's not needed for long and is promptly removed soon after launch.
---
Sorry to burst your bubble but it's not greedy at all.
---
You're not paying to play the beta, people who are subbed to BFA have a chance to get beta invite, plus latest stress test offered all US players with gametime to play stress test.
---
The product you are paying for, is BFA. Getting invited to beta/stress test is a luxury, but it's not what you pay for. Blizzard has already said Classic is to give back to their community, and they have to limit the amount of players in beta/stress test somehow, plus by giving people who have an active sub, they are giving their most loyal customers something extra. 
---
I understand that some people have little to no interest at all in playing BFA, but by subbing right now you, BFA is the product you are subbing for. And even if you "just" sub to play the beta, you still have the OPTION of playing BFA, which Blizzard obviously has to charge you for. Unpopulsr opinion, hate comments inc 🤔
---
If it was, I’d still say Monsters Inc. was pretty dang successful? Unless we’re talking box office stuff, that I have not looked into.
---
Hah back then it was me in the guild that had a few R14’s and many that stopped at 13 so that would’ve been a hoot!
---
It's 2019 and classic is only new to a small number of players (even if millions didn't play) 
---
There will be plenty of people playing classic - it just won't do 1 million players for 6 months straight.
---
I for one accept your hatred towards others because I’m an American.
---
The problem was a lot of servers became " unofficial server of X " nationality , and it was hard for blizzard to enforce the 'English language only ' rule when 80% of general chat was in another language. 
---
It varied from server to server mind you...apparantly the Portuguese and Czech servers were tough to play on , but I was on a 'Swedish server , and other than the odd 'SWE?' in Pugs( if you had 3 or 4 Swedes in group they'd talk in Swedish,  but apologise and translate every so often) it was ok for English speakers
---
This is detrimental to the spirit of Classic.
---
I played a human Paladin and I got meme'd hard by a 12 Orc Rogue who was standing over lowbies' killed Cobalts to get them to accidentally attack - well I am the guy that it worked on because I wasn't paying close enough attention. Anyway, couple minutes later and he's being swarmed by probably 25 level 1-5 characters - me included to get my honor back. Was a fucking blast.
---
precisely
---
God forbid they use one of 4 stress test servers to fuck around and organize some in game fun when the level cap is 15.
---
We need also RP-PvP servers.
---
Take your time and read both sentences i wrote. The answer you are looking for is hidden in those sentences. You just need to be worthy enough to understand it.
---
And they are testing it so they can fix issues with it.
---
Authentic ActiBlizz experience
---
Luckily I'll be at work so I can hop in to their chat and act like a fan and get a list of servers to not play on
---
"Wah wah I don't want layering"
---
Don't play until it's removed. Problem solved.
---
patrickstariloveyou.jpeg
---
I agree that it isn't. My point still stands.
---
It’s not random and while granted it may be your other fire mages fault it is decidedly NOT no ones fault
---
I think it’s an interesting mechanic that takes something besides spamming fireball so I enjoy it, and is super unique to vanilla raiding
---
I don't think europeans hate each other. People nowadays are maybe bored on online games when they play LoL, CS or Dota and queue up into 4/5 stack of russian, french or spanish and they do not want to speak to you, if you do not speak their language. I have nothing against these nationalities, just using them as examples. Same happens with Finns. 
---
My point being, that people can make the difference. I don't actually believe Finns want a Finnish native server, even tho we could totally fill up on or even more servers, says Blizzard what ever. Finnish translations also cost money and the natives anyway will think they are terrible.

I was trying to buy some medium leather last night in Stormwind and it was empty. Guy I was buying from kept telling me he didn’t see me on the stairs so he invited me to group and I joined his later and poof people showed up. But it was only 20 or so? I’ll give them the benefit of the doubt here and assume the layering system will be more flushed out by launch. It’d be disappointing to see multiple layers in a major city for 30ish players.
---
Well it was obtainable right after the con and they had demos for TBC so it must have been vanilla. The costume was like a raggedy mascot murloc with a little blizzcon flag
---
How is this related?
---
It works perfectly in retail pugs. It will work on classic. You people are loosing your mind.
---
It really only helps for the slayer quests. Gathering quests are a nightmare since each player has to get them  separately.   
---
The reason grouping didn't work was because players would take advantage of the group and then leave once their quest was done. If players stuck around for a bit to help their party members it makes it a lot better. It just helps party members who aren't finished get more opportunities to grab the quest items.  
---
Once I found a group that didn't immediately leave the group after completion it was great. We all progressed together and chit-chatted to make the whole experience more enjoyable.
---
This place is swarming with Paladins.
---
It's like everything else on reddit.
---
People don't come to reddit to praise and tell people they are having a good time. People come to reddit to bitch and complain.
---
Why play retail at all?
---
The language situation won't kill classic. Layering might.
---
&gt; I read about layering this and EU realms that, but that matters little to me. Man, I just love this fucking game. Can’t wait until release.
---
Thank fuck I found someone else on this salt mine of a sub that thinks this way. I just want to play the fucking game, I don't care how it gets here. People just *can't* be happy about something these days, there *must* be outrage, or else you're not happy.
---
Here's how you fix your problem with seeing Intercept's cooldown
---
    #show [combat] Intercept; [nocombat] Charge
---
    #showtooltip [combat] Intercept; [nocombat] Charge
---
This will always show them on top, so you'll see the cooldown depending on being in combat or out of combat.
---
I know that hiding a lot of buttons under modifiers can be really confusing. That's why it's important to have macros with a logic that is intuitive for you.
---
For example, all of my druid spells downrank their heals to the most mana efficient with shift, or the lowest rank with control. I keep that consistent across all my macros for my druid, so it's intuitive for me. I'd argue that this \*does\* make me a better player that I would be otherwise.
---
In cases with non combat abilities, like buffs, where you use a lot of modifiers, you can use the "?" icon so it displays the currently active spell. This way you can just flick through your modifiers until you find the one that you want. This won't make you better at WoW, fair enough, but it will reduce UI clutter which some people prefer.
---
This JUST got posted. 
---
Classic is dead before it got released boys, pack it up. /s
---
You bring up some good points there! I like those kinds of farms myself, but it also means I have yo choose one of them, especially in the beginning, since leveling up 3 different classes would take too long 😂 I'm probably gonna go hunter tho! Gotta farm those dungeons 😂
---
It was easier to type LFR than to think of all the pedantic replies I'd get.
---
It's better this way than having german only guilds, spanish only guilds, and french only guilds. Tho i assure you they will be on english speaking servers. 
---
Much like east coast us will have french guilds.
---
Pservers benefit from huge populations and 24/7 activity due to multi-timezone guild members.
---
I wouldn't be scared of being on their kos list, it means I get to put them on ours.
---
Yeah...they were saying that since the 70's.
---
And guess what, 50 years later, everyone bar China speaks English.
---
50 years from now will be the same.
---
Also, 50 years from 50 years from now.
---
Okay, so whats the reason for them not doing language-specific realms? Did you honestly believe their OBVIOUS  AS FUCK LIE with freedom xD?
---
Replying to this to emphasize: do not rely on drops, because if your desired weapon doesn't drop then you've effectively wasted your time (you still got xp, but you're going to be far and away less efficient).
---
If I were you, I would start familiarizing myself with the weapons you're likely to see during leveling (e.g. Cauldron Stirrer, Zhovur Axe, Crescent Staff for Horde; e.g. Staff of Westfall and so on for Alliance).
---
&gt; You can't tell me you haven't had better gaming experiences with people living in different countries.
---
I can... because most interactions I have with Russians or Peruvians on Dota are bad. Some are good, but the majority are bad simply because we cannot communicate.
---
&gt; Wow will teach us all the basics of many languages. You guys shouldn't just shit on everything just because you can. Fun times are to be had.
---
THis is not actually a thing. Forcing you to play games with other languages doesn't make you somehow fluent enough to understand the language and be able to converse. Not unless you dedicated thousands of hours and only play with 1 specific language.
---
&gt; *Stop trying to stop things before they've even started. We're closer than ever to ease of movement throughout the planet let alone cross country so please have a positive outlook.
---
This is a complete nothing statement. Just because we have ease of movement doesn't mean anything in regards to communicating in dozens of random languages.
---
I'm guessing this is bait. Classic isn't even out yet, nevermind 'already lost'.
---
you can always put the cooldown you're interested in on another bar just for the timer.
---
This is reddit, people come to complain.
---
You also gotta remember, blizzard knows you are going to play no matter how much complaining happens
---
Frenchy here too and I've been playing SWTOR where it's already the case, it's really a non-issue.  
---
Stop making it bigger than it seems. Sure you'll get confused over localized names at first but you get used to it.   
---
As for speaking english - games have been a thing for a long time now and the need to understand basic english to play these online is also a known fact. Even if you don't speak a good english you can still sort it out just fine.   
---
Check out SWTOR - you'll see. It's fine.
---
Of course it does.  I also think they need a way to curb the abuse.  You shouldn't be able to change layers "easily".
---
Complaining is exactly how you get things reassessed. There is always hope for the people willing to advocate for themselves.
---
Tool, 10000 days. 
---
Can’t wait for their new album!!
---
hello fellow guildie ☺️
---
Good work.
---
I think quests come out in plain text, unlike item links
---
Or maybe being level 15 isn’t that exciting but 50 v 50 WPVP is. I don’t give a shit about Asmon but I was still there to get in on the PVP and have fun. At this point I’m convinced all the autistics in this reddit are what’s really gonna kill the game. Bring on the downvotes.
---
I don't play in Portuguese because it not even Portuguese. It's Brazilian Portuguese. Oof
---
And we all know its for the food
---
so I can login and clear the same 5 mobs over and over while layers reshuffle due to high pop?
---
if you just wanna grind to 60 as fast as possible, fine, I see why you want layering
---
if you ever liked rpgs or world immersion, this is game breaking. sorry. and I dont trust or believe that it will only be in for 2 weeks.  i think blizz knows how bad it is and theyre trying to keep it quiet.
---
I press shadow bolt, drain soul, and curse of the elements.
---
O really, genius.
---
His name is Arthur. That is 100% paladin name.
---
To rest all came naturally...
---
You shouldnt be shredding much while leveling. Going stealth is a waste of time unless you need to safely travel past some mobs
---
FUCK NO - most of them will be gone by month 3... I no longer let what my friends are playing affect my decision at all - it's 2019 and most of them will be back to playing league or fortnite within 4 months.
---
Not being used to something does not make it a bad thing. 
---
I believe this is totally fixable if need be afterwards with free migrations, if they decide german servers are needed.
---
Remindme 2 months
---
Wouldn't it be awesome if Blizz just introduced a real time text translation program, that just translated all of the languages into the language you set?
---
Nope - many of these players have played with an international community on Pservers and have legitimate gripes with the different cliques that form based on nationality. Haven’t seen anything actually racist or “bigoted.” 
---
Btw: nationality isn’t a race.
---
Spanish is mostly a mixture of greek, latin and arabic.
---
When I first started playing wow I made my character on whatever random realm blizz suggested to me. I think most people did. The issue is blizz suggests dead severs to try and push new players there to populate them. This creates a bad gameplay experience. My first realm was an RP-pvp realm with less than 1000 active players. It was impossible to get any group content done. I'd rather take language barriers, lag, and any sort of other issue than end up on a ghost town server.
---
nope
---
It does for me.  I'd play a hunter but there are going to be way to many of them.
---
I didn't really see the big "issue" with layering until I saw this video.
---
Now I understand and see why people are so upset about it.
---
&gt; Classic isn't a game you quit in a month like BFA, the content takes a lot longer to get through.
---
Casuals will drop by to see what's up, dying after pulling 2-3 mobs at the same time, and quit.
---
Gotem!
---
Followed by the top comment “I KNOW ILL BE DOWNVOTED BUT IF YOU PLAN ON GETTING ANYWHERE IN CLASSIC I WOULDNT PLAN ON ROLLING XX CLASS OR XX SPEC YOULL NEVER GET ANY INVITES”
---
Here's [ND's Pre-Launch Stress Test.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoaxiAe9rrw) Judge for yourself if that's more or less than OP's screenshot, but you can't deny they aren't lagging.

Unpopular opinion, It's about time these uncultured barbarians learned the language of civilization.
---
RemindMe! August 27th, 2019
---
Why would we need to defend streamers or anybody on Reddit? Reddit is pretty irrelevant and filled with passive aggressive people.
---
I remember turkish people from other games. It was annoying, but prt od experience.
---
But then again I am from a smaller EU country and there have never been any servers in my native language
---
That's really interesting, but I think it will get stuck on the Pickpocket. Have you tested it? Otherwise that's really handy. I might add in a line to begin auto-attacking under the same conditions as Sinister Strike.
---
Well, I'll only speak for the latest pservers where I've been playing for a few months now. To begin with, almost every time I met a Russian dude, we spoke only with single words, one at a time. Like where, this, come, wait etc. It might have been hard luck on my part but I'm convinced that not everybody is knowledgeable enough to make themselves understood from other ppl the way they'd like. 
---
Also, the dynamic of a group during dungeons can be very variable. From very talkative if you team up with natives or plurilingual dudes, to dead quiet, on account of ppl who just can't keep up.
---
I've been playing exclusively with my brother. Well oftentimes, when very complex topics were being discussed or jokes cracked, he just couldn't participate and he'd ask me. It just wasn't enjoyable for him.
---
Can you please elaborate a bit on those mouseover macros. Do they only work if i mouseover my party/raid frames and press the button or if my mouse is on the screen it will cast it on my mouse's target?  
---
Because if it's not the case that they only work on the party/raid frames i really don't see the reason for having modifiers in macros other than having one less button shown on the user interface. You can always create a shift-1 control-1 alt-1 bind with the seperate spells. Although if they only work on party/raid frames i can see them being useful and freeing up additional comfortable binds for other spells.
---
If he was in STV on a level 15 I’m sure he wasn’t just looking for an int buff. Everyone was there for one reason.
---
My guess: some bean counter put together a spreadsheet. "Based on public demographics data, only 10% of EU men aged 16-30 speak no English. We expect to make a million dollars, and if 10% quit because of no English ability, then we'll make $900k. It will cost more than $100k to have a multilingual DM crew, therefore we have a financial obligation to our shareholders to only have English servers.
---
I would put good money that the person who made that decision doesn't understand what an MMO community is, or how the decision affects the entire population and not just the 10%. I wouldn't be surprised if they used data from single-player games to support their conclusion.
---
I also wouldn't be surprised if the decision came from monolingual English speakers who don't understand how exhausting and alienating it can be to communicate in a language you aren't comfortable with. "Eh, if they speak a little bit of English, they'll be fine!"
---
Oh no I don't overestimate it at all because I experienced it myself, my first server started 20% Hungarian, 20% Dutch, 60% English and ended up 80% Hungarian after 6 months. Ended up having to reroll because they just didn't speak any English or simply refused it, couldn't get any groups going at all.
---
There were numerous examples all over EU servers where this was happening and yes a lot of people were/are asses to eachother because there's a lot of history between the countries. 
---
If only I recorded the conversations of my guild that was half Balkan, half Greek and a couple of N/W Europeans, there were some explosive conversations to put it mild, accusing eachother of attrocities that happened during the Kosovo war. Back then the Kosovo war happened only 6-8 years ago and many people in my guild saw family getting killed in front of their eyes.
---
June 19-21. They had 15 servers and ended up shutting down all except 2 due to lack of actual stress on them. Then they opened up 2 of them again so there are 4 total and only 2 have (High) population. I was in the beta and saw the Server Announcement myself.
---
you could have just learned italian, casual

At certain BRs, the Premium spam of certain tanks/planes can be pretty bad at times.

Where are you even getting this? Wasn't there 15 realms in the stress test? That's what I heard and I've no idea since I'm European, so no access to it.
---
So with these sort of macros do you put them on extra bars instead of the primary bars, since the main bar changes with each stance/form?
---
&gt;Stormwind and Ironforge are amazing city hubs while Orgrimmar is the only decent main city on Horde.

Blizzard wouldn't forcibly segregate streamers and confine them to a single server, so hopefully they all agree to the segregation you wish for. If you truly have your game experience ruined by having a streamer on your server, losing a few raid lockouts seems like a small price to pay for finally being free.
---
I wish you and the other 39 like-minded individuals luck on your streamer free server.
---
we are just a little on edge because we have an addiction and blizz wont hand over the stuff!
---
If i work on my UI/keybinds now will they save for classic?
---
I'm not saying it's inaccurate, but way too many people saying things are too easy, regen is too high, etc.  Just wondering.  And yes, I know peoples memories can be fault.  After all, in 1.12 most of us were waiting for TBC.
---
At this point, I think Blizzard wants Brexit canceled.
---
My mind cannot compute other reason to mix all Europeans on same server, except that Blizzard is in cahhots with Junker.
---
What data do you have to back it up though? Internet polls aren't very accurate.
---
It's sad you're saying it as if it's a fact and not what it actually is: a feeling you have.
---
I am playing the beta and the difference in layering has changed so many times in the past few weeks. They are trying to find the right thresholds to make the world seem alive still. Do you expect them to get things right on the first pass? Things take time and tuning. That is why there is a beta.
---
Oh yeah, definitely. I mostly meant the kobold quests in Northshire Abbey. 
---
I guess in groups at least you get XP for stuff dying even if you didn't tag it, but I found it wasn't worthwhile to do the bandanna quest there at all; too many people and even in groups you got tags so rarely that the XP was negligible.
---
I'd really like to get logged in fast enough to speed out of the bottleneck but you know how that's gonna be... I imagine you'll get ahead of the curve by doing a couple of things right away: not messing with your UI and not touching your settings. I think I'll ignore those things until I'm out of the starting zone or hit a bottleneck and have time to fiddle with 'em. It'll also help to have your character already made and ready to go, so that's something people with an active sub will benefit from over those who don't bother to sub until the day-of...
---
So...why the fuck NOT doing it NOW, officially, since it will happen ANYWAY?
---
Your logic is BACKWARDS mate.
---
Does anyone remember "Boondock Saints"?  The long joke monologue?
---
Well, I would ask for a coke.
---
To an American pleb who only speaks English, the idea that someone who speaks at least 2 languages purposely avoids their native language in game is hilarious.
---
I mean it’s not really an either or thing here, throw a stream up on one monitor and play the game. Just like watching Netflix or something while grinding
---
Are you suggesting they make Czech server, Romanian server, Polish server, etc.?
---
At low levels, they're rolling on all the same gear as the priest.
---
I've seen groups with a Mage + Priest who will say no to a Warlock, but accept Mages.
---
Okay, welcome to video games in 2019 bud.
---
I'm sorry you don't pay attention to what other games or players do.
---
Frost Nova, Sheep, and in some cases Decurse.
---
Yeah man. Blizzard is a reputable company that has never made brain dead retarded decisions. They've always effectively predicted player turnout. You know, like the WoD launch. Blizzard has also never just straight up ignored months of feedback during the beta and decided to launch the game anyways, that definitely didn't happen with BFA, it's doing great with over 500k active characters at the moment.
---
You're right, I'm really looking that I get to pay Blizzard for a product that they told me I didn't want. I'm very privileged to get to line their multi-billion dollar corporate pockets. God forbid I speak my mind to the corporate overlords and desire to pay for a product I actually want.
---
Blizzard are lucky I'm even considering buying a title from them after the absolute shit-show that was BFA, Legion, WoD, HotS. This a company that has failed miserably time and time again for years now, and you unironically say that I'm lucky to  be able to give them my money? Fuck off. Blizzard should feel lucky that anyone is even considering paying them for a product that is widely available and completely open source and 100% free now because of their incompetence. Good fucking lord are you delusional.
---
Completely agree with the things you think are ruining the game, like the hyper balancing (Gonna remember this one lol) but I disagree with the direction they come from. 
---
I don't think hyper balancing is happening because of competetiveness and esports, in my eyes its the opposite. 
---
I feel like the need to reduce every class to the same playstyle and same amount of skills, originated from the people that could not handle the old classes and kept complaining on the forums because they were never taken since they sucked. And then they whine they never get invited because "They only care about DPS".
---
I remember a hunter in my raid during mythic progress on the first dragno in emerald nightmare who simply couldn't perform. We went to check logs and found out he used the sleeping arrow in a bossfight...on cooldown.
---
Can you imagine this player if skillbars were actually filled with abilities?
---
They've never said the realm cap will be 3k. And Layering is being removed in ~2 months.
---
I have a 19 year old daughter and a 14 year old son. I have made parenting choices with my daughter that I later decided were wrong. I can not go back and fix them for her but I was able to course correct and get them right for my son, Blizzard can do the same for Classic.
---
I also told my daughter as recompense I will always pay for her therapy, maybe Blizzard can do the same for BFA :)
---
There is no way Blizzard is going to ban non-English on an international realm. Classic isn't going to be administered by a bunch of jobless dickwads.
---
Resist also does have a chance for you to completely negate the spell. Such as resisting a polymorph.
---
I think this is basically how I'm gonna have to go about it
---
Can you log in!
---
&gt;  Guilds were very nationalistic with &lt;The British Brotherhood&gt; &lt;Hungarian Honoured&gt; &lt;Swedish Valhalla Elite&gt; and others popping up.
---
Please man, don't forget &lt; Dutch Might &gt; of Agamaggan EU ;)
---
this is the kind of extra content I can get behind. Especially the Survival one. Itd be cool if you had to carry around torches during the dark. They could of done alot with the game if they made it like that. Druids in Cat form can see better, mages could have a torch spell. Priest and pallys do things with light. Warriors can cry in the fetal position in a cave. It would be amazing.
---
Why is it disgusting really?  
---
Why are people so edged out about someone on Beta layering to get a chest.  
---
On live servers the prospect is that the layers will all have people so you will always fight for the chest. Or whatever other thing you are layering.
---
Even if you do get 7... what is the problem? That someone gets ahead of you the first week? Chill... 
---
That wont matter to 99% of players... why is everyone so edgy about the situation i really dont get it.
---
I kind of agree with you. However if Blizzard doesn't listen to what it's playerbase wants then people will simply cancel their sub and go back to playing on pservers.
---
Obviously they decided it was a good idea to bring Classic in order to pull people away from pservers and pad their sub numbers, but if they just blindly do whatever they want without listening to the players Classic will fail and like I said everyone will just go back to the pserver of their choice.
---
Ah, the anti-circlejerk circlejerk.
---
I've seen plenty of times where a streamer changed layers when it didn't make any sense.  The Cdew incident was certainly memorable because of his reaction of guilt and how absurd it was that the mob would disappear for adding someone to the party.  
---
You change layers randomly in closed beta and we can only hope it's because they are testing it.
---
my first re run through vanilla deadmines was so much fun. the amount of times we died and just laughed about it and kept going....a ton of fun tbh. i enjoy vanilla dungeons
---
Undercity would like a word.
---
Both Spanish and Italian came from Latin, which belongs to the Italic branch of Indo-European language family. It may have been influenced by Greek and Etruscan, but it didn't originate from them. Similarly, the Visigoths would have spoken a Germanic language, Spanish didn't come from them either.
---
I was thinking of going this until 30 https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#0Zx0gccb for the movement speed while in cat form.
---
But after 30 when you get travel form switching to https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#0zLV0oZx0gccbd
---
Anyone have any thought on Omen of clarity and if its worth it?
---
Only tough decision I face is whether I level my mage or warrior first :)
---
But in game (not forums) a prot warrior wouldn't give a rip about a pally tank cuz the prot warrior would be tanking a different group.
---
Nailed it!
---
Yeah I am excited for that. There will still be a bunch of macros that remove some possibly enjoyable interactions of dynamic classes.
---
Don’t misunderstand my point. Level 60 content without any macros are an entire nightmare. But chances are even in 1.13 there can be “too much” of it.
---
By the way, do you happen to know the situation with healing predictions? I always hoped Blizzard would have closed down the APIs altogether tbh. Would have definitely been one way to increase the difficulty. Though I do concede that my opinion is super unpopular and I respect that almost everyone disagrees! Not trying to convince anyone here.
---
Crowd controlled as f***.
---
Look I was as stoked as most of you for the Classic, but with it creeping closer to launch I'm starting to think I'm just too old to put in the time and effort.
---
Yes it's fun, yes it's probably better than current versions, but something in me dreads the time sink it will become. I'll probably play, hopefully in moderation. However I could see myself quitting after a few months.
---
Nah I don't give a fuck I'm playing human pally because I want to
---
Very cool where is this?
---
Me too.
---
I'm really grateful that my ignorant English arse can communicate with Europeans thanks to the good language education of nations like Holland.
---
I feel like your post is 10 years behind. We're in am age where anyone can make subreddits and discord channels like nothing. AND were going to choose servers 2 weeks before launch. Were in the communication age, if theres a defacto language server then the people who want to play will know where to look. 
---
It's not 2006, its 2019. Information is at your fingertip. 
---
This subreddit has a habit of ignoring some obvious points because they feel they know better than blizz. Blizz has actual numbers, has stat analysists that look at said numbers. They can guess to where the player base will come from better than us. 
---
But its exhausting to drive the point home and as much as I want classic to succeed at this point blizzard is damned if they do and damned if they dont on everything. They should just release it as is and let people flounder. Like a kid who wants to ride his bike without any help, let him fall.
---
This is a repost.
---
I feel personally attacked by this post.
---
I want to be in high demand and I’m choosing how I play on that.
---
Main : Nelf/dwarf hunter 
---
Alt : dwarf priest
---
There will be lots of mages and lots of paladins on alliance. A hunter works well with frost mages and paladins in pvp. A dwarf priest makes your raid leader happy and is a great healer for pvp when you get gear
---
People like the OP are the people we need out of retail and hopefully stay out of classic.
---
But English and German are not Romance languages...
---
I'm not making an argument. You asked how is watching a streamer different than reading a book or watching tv. I stated that one difference is that reading books is a healthier thing to do.
---
That's not an argument. I stated a difference, as you asked.
---
I have 3 deciding factors. Working a rotating shift, being a loot whore, and being lazy.
---
So druid, Hunter or shaman sounds great for me.
---
Shouldn't even have layering active by this point in the game.
---
I'm trying to avoid resubbing just to find out I don't have access, it says I need active game time to access servers (naturally) if I launch it.
---
Didn't people say the same thing when the battleground was not the "correct", version?
---
Haha
---
Well if you speak english you an manage german really.   
---
I speak English, German, French, Spanish fluently plus I studied Latin 10+ years ...   
---
Really knowing Latin just lets you "rebuild" all these modern languages. I'm a native french speaker, learned english while I was learning french - studied spanish and latin in school. Wanted to try and pick up german like a year ago - I achieved near fluency in a matter of weeks without much of an effort. Once you get the logic behind the language and learn the "exceptions" each language has you can figure out the rest on the go.
---
Layering is being removed in 'weeks', that was the only quote they gave on the matter.
---
And Ion also said in that same interview that each layer will be equal to about the same size of a server back then, so 3k. They merge layers as they are no longer needed. That means when all layers are eventually merged down, Blizzard is expecting near the 3k mark... anything more and it won't be blizzlike as vanilla isn't designed to have 15,000 players online concurrently.
---
The latest Stress Test had multiple realms not for need, but for want of testing various Layering sizes and mechanics. And they quickly reduced the number of realms to 4 when they realized they simply didn't have enough players to fill all their scenarios.
---
Everyone who is complaining about starter zone congestion but \*also\* wants to be the first player to level 60 needs to take a chill pill and realize that it's their own choice to play the very minute the servers launch.  
---
If you don't want to play while it's super congested, wait a week before logging in. If you want to play the game immediately then you'll have to deal with the congestion. Simple as that.  
---
I played the stress test, like most everyone else did, and if launch day is as congested (or less) as the test servers then I will do just fine. Sure, it took me 3 1/2 hours to get to level 6 but I didn't give a dang - I'm just happy to be playing the WoW that I actually like to play. I \*like\* that it took me a while to level up. It was a pain in the ass but it gave me a lot of opportunity to chat with other players and makes friends.
---
I play CS:GO so it's essentially no different
---
I’m going to miss my Chinese friends so much 😭😭😭
---
Yeah what kind of idiot wants to play Classic for the community!
---
Not dumbasses like you, nope!
---
Deathwing was an amazing villain up until his raid tier came out.
---
Restrict layer changes to inns/cities, add cooldowns
---
 I see a lot of people on here talking about how they can only play 1-2 hours a night because of responsibilities. I feel bad because I'm 36 and don't have the same type of responsibilities. I'm not married, I've never had kids, etc. I'm more excited for August 26th than any other vacation I've taken or will take this year.
---
If you don't like a game, you don't have to play it?
---
&gt;I trolled lfr with heroic/ mythic gear.
---
yikes
---
&gt; Everquest
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Leveling a mage as your main is a brilliant idea honestly. They feel powerful even in the most garbage gear, you have buttons to get yourself out of sticky situations. You will be whispered more than any other DPS for dungeon groups thanks to your conjuration, teleportation, AoE, and CC abilities. Mages also have the honor of farming gold faster and easier than any other class.
---
I’m just glad that as someone who lives in England I can connect to the US east servers and have 95-100 ping. Just fine for classic tbh. That’s where I’ll be playing to avoid the mess.
---
But they are playing the game?
---
Its really up to preference. Streamer servers will make the servers something different than they were in original vanilla wow. There is also a more modern crowd that want to move on with the times and follow a streamer. That's okay too, even though some elitists think that other people should play the way they want instead of what each person wants.
---
There is no wrong answer when it comes to vanilla wow, just do what you wanna do.
---
But this won't be fixed. I'm already on a german Discord with 1k people. We will take one server where we will play and that will be a german server and the french people are doing the same. In the end you will still have different language servers just unofficial instead of official servers by Blizzard.
---
And the internet polls seem to have hunters pretty low. Also, the hunter population is interesting. It's a favorite class of the anti-social and farm-alts. When it comes to 5man, bgs, and raiding, hunters seem to be somewhere between under represented and appropriately represented. They're very popular in groups simply for needing very different loot than the rest of the group.
---
So ballparking isn't reliable but having pre-planned merges is reliable based on what data?
---
I literally refuse to believe you managed to get into that many layers to get that many arena trinkets. I've seen people hopping to a single other layer, but being able to coordinate swapping to 3+ is outlandish beyond belief. This sub is very fond of insisting Blizzard "prove" things to them, so I'm asking you: Prove it. If you can't stop rabble rousing based on stuff you don't understand, please.
---
For some reason this doesn’t bother me
---
You can do this a few different ways. I solved it by having all my abilities on each stance be macros of equal complexity and function (for the charge macro, put the same one on each stance bar).
---
Or you can also switch your active action bar to 2, if you aren't displaying it on the side of the screen. That one won't change depending on stance. However, your macros have to be smaller. My druid's cat form macro is the limit of the character length, so that single macro can't accommodate that functionality in bear form too.
---
That was for stressing purposes, ie they wanted to simulate their peak launch targets, not their 2020 server pop targets...
---
https://worldofwarcraft.fandom.com/et/wiki/US_realm_list_by_datacenter
---
I used this as reference.
---
At least 40% of YT is utter trash.
---
Lol no beta... why do people think they are inviting anymore... 66 days or whatever until launch.
---
Hi, /u/_Sytris

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c3crdf/best_class_and_profession_combo/). 
---
There's a difference between "expecting it to fail" and understanding that a lot of players will be exploring classic on a short term or very intermittent basis.
---
Everyone can speak English when they want and need,  so don't make a big deal out of nothing.  This topic will die off in 1 week.
---
Its just a question, man. Don't get your panties in a wad.
---
People heavily complain about the problems they see. And I mean really heavily. But in no way is everyone saying it is failing. It‘s probably your blurred vision about the current situation where people worry about the problems. 
---
Don’t get me wrong, I’m also cringing on every negative thread, but it’s not that everyone says it will fail
---
Orc rogue is king for PvE and PvP in my opinion. Blood fury is fantastic for PvE, and Stun Resist can literally win you entire fights in PvP. Engineering and mining are great professions for rogues in PvE and PvP, and you can farm in many out of the way places other classes cannot.
---
Why do I feel like while Activision is on ship, this won't happen...
---
Yes, I have the costume too. BlizzCon was not even held in 2006 mate. You're wrong.
---
Yeah, except that the VAST majority of Classic players aren't on reddit, or WoW forums, or on Youtube.
---
Most people ARE UNIFORMED, either because they don't have the time to do it, or because they don't care.
---
Most French players won't even know that Malganis (to you your example) will be the unofficial French realm.
---
Everyone will be spread ALL OVER, and not even 20% will KNOW where to go prior to launch. Most players will NOT KNOW.
---
Good one... nobody cares. Now shut your hole
---
So you instead rely on *other Redditors* digging through people's posts? That's even worse.
---
Either way the point still stands, since ad hominem fallacy will forever be just a fallacy.
---
Agreed! I was getting my ass kicked by the Defias Pillagers and teamed up with a paladin and we made short work of them. Went into one of the caves and got overwhelmed and had some “RUN!!!!” moments ourselves. Made me miss the game so much.
---
This sub - "blizzard has already said queues and free transfers"
---
Yeah no shit - free transfers to dead servers hooray!
---
God bless anyone who plays in streamer serves when they disable layering.
---
So do you want to force everyone to use slow PCs, low resolution, CRT monitors, lose internet connection when a family member uses a phone? No? oh...
---
Debuffs still have reverence to the game, they offer a strategic choice of not being able to have too many good bonuses on the boss, you pick and choose which ones you think will be most important to your group for the fight.
---
Artificial lag on the other hand? Can you give any positives that we gain in 2019?
---
You mostly did not get invited
---
My point is that it's different than yours.
---
Hunters are never in demand though.
---
The old "it takes money to make money" I remember playing vanilla wow, a friend of mine bought some gold and gave it to me. Me and another friend decided to use that money to buy all the ice mail jerkins (and later other boe epics) off the AH and then put one up on the AH for %300 mark up. Then I would get on an alt and spam trade chat saying "WTB ice mail jerkin for (%350)" undoubtly someone would think they are smart and try toi make a quick buck, they would buy out the over priced boe and try to trade me, i would log off saying i need to mail gold, and never log on that character again. My friend and I did this for months before getting a 3 day ban with threats of perma if we did it again. Good times.
---
I'd actually not heard of it until recently, it was on a patch history video, think madseasonshow? Maybe around 0.8
---
If you look at vanilla radar or similar lists, warriors, mages, and hunters are all top 3.
---
Is it just me, or does Garosh's head have to be REALLY small to fit in that?
---
Fair enough. They should change the new player recommendations to be servers that have low-medium player counts, but are growing rather than stagnating and/or dying off, but having no server regions is still unlikely to happen, since every other blizzard game uses the same server regions.
---
The real thing we need to worry about is if there's a streamer on your server. They'll REALLY make things unplayable what with their huge zerg of fans surrounding them making it impossible for anyone not part of their mafia to play on those servers. Streamers will either be the best thing ever for classic WoW, or they will be the reason it dies. There is no in-between.
---
Theoretically.  I’m not 100% convinced.  We’ll see if the multiboxers all ding 60 first.
---
I just see it like a social norm thing.
---
If you're playing in a group or raid with language X only, go ahead! But if you're playing on a European server and you queue up with 4 different nationalities, just adept a bit and speak English for a bit.
---
I'm Dutch and I fucking hate it when people 'publicly' speak Dutch even tho only 2 or 3 of the group are Dutch.
---
Yeah, that's very out of date.
---
when alliance see a hordie type ccaf it shows up as “ooga” to them. its what the Ooga Gang (a group of Troll Rogues) on the beta say when they gank people.
---
I'm not sure about Greece, but Slovaks (as usual together with Czechs) have made one official EN server to their own CZ/SK Server. Thats why they dont ask for it - they alredy know what to do :) 
---
And CZ/SK population together is only 15 millions. Now imagine 80 Million Piefkes, 9 millionen Össies and 6 millionen in german part of Switzerland (but I'm not sure if they wont requre rather an official Schwizerdütsch realm lol)
---
Ok, so nothing tangible then. You are just worried that they will keep it on indefinitely even though they have stated multiple times that they won't. Look, if they end up keeping it after the launch I'll join the hate bandwagon too, but right now I have given no reason to believe that they don't know what they're doing.
---
Do not forget the suka bliat, curwa polish job stealers
---
I agree with wanting servers of your own language. But if a translator feature or addon would make people play to learn a new language. Look mom I'm doing my homework I'm learning Korean.
---
People like you is the reason reason retail is complete shit
---
All companies have shit manager-tier employees that make decisions that clearly go against the company's best interest for a multitude of reasons and either never get noticed or only way down the line. Higher ups are usually blind to most of what is going on under them.
---
Thinking otherwise is quite naive IMO.
---
That means a lot, thanks!
---
Ban dem multiboxers! I didn't bring the band together to be outshone by cheaters!
---
Suck your own panties.
---
Looks like Sunken Temple to me.
---
The two photos are different locations. The one on the right is the Quinta da Regalerias Initiation Well in Sintra Portugal. The bottom of the tunnel is an underground tunnel system that takes you to different parts of the property. I visited earlier this year. One tunnel takes you behind a waterfall and the other takes you to another well.
---
I'm not trying to get you into a "Gotcha" situation, but I think you missed a detail with this stress test. It was open *only for US* and only for people with active accounts (https://de.wowhead.com/news=292359/wow-classic-stress-test-june-19-21-access-to-all-active-us-game-accounts). This was in no shape or form an open beta, and it couldn't have been used to guess the amount of players of ANY region, since it was still bound to an **active subscription**.
---
&gt;Walks in to /r/classicwow 
---
&gt; "hey how's things going?"
---
&gt; Splat bam ouch arrrgggh "die you engliz pigzzz!"
---
&gt; "ok I will head back to /r/mylittlepony for a while until things calm down. Have fun."
---
1 million private server players - lol! Welp that's my queue to leave.
---
Shaman now shaman forever.
---
I don't know why you feel that.
---
If that were the case, we'd be getting pets and mounts from the money store too.
---
But since that won't happen...how about Blizzard give is Vanilla...INCLUDING the god damn language based realms?
---
I thought about the same. It seems they want to record and observe   before they slap a language tag on something and locking it in. There better be free realm transfers then.
---
Yep. As much as I hate on streamers, the fact that streamers are going out of their way to document and publicize the problems with layering is a huge community service. Without the reach of these people, Blizz would be able to sweep this bullshit under the rug.
---
So now you need two accounts and have to make enough characters to get into a different layer and make sure you STAY in that layer. WOW this is truly really easy to abuse.....I cant wait to do all of this just to avoid a gank.
---
because they are so deathly afraid of "dead air" which many people would actually prefer.
---
Programming certainly make you more powerful and that's exactly the very purpose of programming since the beginning.
---
But i'm asking myself a philosophical question: is this scripting slowly shifting a player toward automaton/botting thus leaving the human factor progressively. I mean if we extend this, we could just create a final enourmous macro: play the game. Then what's left for us?
---
On another side, another question to ask ourselves, is it not a drive for performance dictated by society which take the place of just playing a game? At which moment a game becomes a chore/work/performance behavior?
---
You could say the same thing about pro-layering. Don’t like having high competition for your kills without layering to help you along? Play another game.
---
See how that isn’t helpful at all?
---
This is obviously true. They didn't say there won't be pandas because that is obviously true.
---
Do you have any proof they backpedaled on the starting zones sharding? 
---
I haven't seen a single shred of legit proof anywhere that they said they were only doing starting zone sharding.
---
The only thing I recall is streamer talk and this sub preemptively complaining about sharding.
---
How do mages hold up in later raids? Is aoe grinding efficient if duo leveling?
---
Where?
---
I like that you out here poking the incel beardlings. Doing gods work bro. Be prepared for the back lash though.
---
They work because there is no population cap and dynamic respawns. On a 15k online server you still have more than a full server of every language
---
oh cool just don't join groups what a great solution 🙄
---
All I wanted to do was race each other's general without capping any bunkers and get exalted in one weekend to get lobotomizer on my alt  at least that's my memory of av
---
Yea layering saves money. Ignoring the r&amp;d, the supervision and implementation, maintenance...
---
If you honestly think the effort and costs put into layering is cheaper than throwing in another server in this day and age, especially with how niche the game already is. You're ridiculous.
---
You don’t seem to understand what loot boxes are.
---
you're getting a bunch of downvotes because what you said is fucking retarded
---
Exactly, its so awesome seeing a flood of people on server launch
---
Yea sure I can definitely try to record it in action. Always want an excuse to play more classic :P
---
I love how Blizzard fanboys always say that.
---
"Well, YOU couldn't come up with a better solution! So we have to support Blizzard!"
---
I mean, of course the average redditor would know! They're working in the thick of it, right there on blizzard games, familiar with the code. OF COURSE they would know!
---
We're the gamers. We're the customers. All we see, is that Blizzard is sacrificing player experience. All we see is that Classic immersion is being ruined, people are vanishing in/out of PVP combat MID FIGHT, people are gaming the system to exploit resources.
---
It's an *utterly terrible* system, and your response is "well YOU couldn't come up with a better one". 
---
C'mon mate. Get your head out of the sand. If you truly believe layering is the best option, and not the easiest/cheapest option, to a problem that had existed 15 years ago, then you are the very definition of Blizzard Fanboy

I have 7 years of EvE on my back, and 14 of WoW, and it will take me a goddamn novel to explain to you WHY you cannot use EvE as an example that works...BECAUSE IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY !
---
This situation is going to be a nightmare for forming groups without RDF. Things were different back in vanilla.
---
Yeah. I really don't get it. ..... 
---
Obligatory meme: https://imgflip.com/i/3403ib
---
Just spam '/1 Plz invite' and accept every invite you get.
---
Correct. And the entire stress test couldn't sustain more than 4 realms to simulate peak launch day numbers. For the entire US+Canada+Oceania+LatinAmerica+Brazil population plus whatever diehard EU fans paid $15.
---
So 6 realms for US is rather generous.
---
F
---
Man, retail players are really sensitive.
---
Not sure, but pets and mounts are a bit unnatural, while realm transfer ain't that much, or so I feel, but let's hope you are correct.
---
Yeah I was the exact same especially for TBC, but I just don't have time for that nowadays. If queues are that bad, I get to play for like an hour before I have to log off, the rest is just wasted on my phone or YouTube which is a waste of an evening.
---
Server tech has come a long way since then and we should take full advantage of it. I'm not disputing layering is broken as it stands, but it should be an easy fix to prevent abuse rather than just remove it entirely.
---
Priests are in such a high demand that they will never not take a non-dwarf one. With all the help from addons nowadays there's also no excuse for the warriors not to stancedance. 
---
If it's for pvp, well yea fearward is pretty powerful but don't underestimate something like shadowmeld if you want to go NE. It's great for stealth but also for interrupting spells. The racial that I will miss the most in classic will probably be the repgain from Humans ;), the repgrind is insane.
---
So in the end just play what you like, noone will think less of you.
---
Well, our healthcare is generally tied to it. I also find job hunting really draining and unpredictable, so while I might have a month of two of bills and expenses saved up, I might go three months before I find a job. I don't judge anyone for quitting a job without another lined up, but the idea of doing that myself is...stressful to think about.
---
You're correct, they check your mouseover first, then cast on your target if you aren't moused over something. I believe they work on raid frames. If you \*only\* include a @mouseover clause (like with the /petattack in the hunter macro) it will do nothing if you have no mouseover target.
---
You're also correct that modifiers mostly only function to reduce UI clutter. I consistently build all my healing macros to downrank to the most mana efficient with shift, and the minimum rank with control (where such things are relevant). Some people may want to use the most efficient by default and uprank on shift. Whichever.
---
i did click and ok ill report it
---
Locoleos has a good answer. You're not comparing apples to apples. The way an actor treats another actor during a movie is definitely not the same. Streamers may put on a front, but they're dealing with real people in real life. If they're a mean person, that's who they are. If someone paid you money to go around and be unkind to people in your everyday life, you may accept it because it's a way to make money, but you're still responsible for how you act. So following your reasoning, if Ralph Fiennes walked around using the Cruciatus curse on real people even though he's an actor and is being paid, he would definitely be, at minimum, a prick.
---
Weird, I logged in 30 minutes after it started and battled hundreds for quest mobs but cleared the starting zone in a reasonable time. Took me roughly 50 minutes to reach level 7. Not the fastest, but not 'unplayable' like your romanticizing about.
---
And now you're server is really 4 micro servers who can't communicate but keep running into each other. Not a real solution.
---
Choice is a beautiful thing. If you don't like the game you don't have to play it.
---
thousands of shards alleviates the beginner rush. 
---
you don't even notice the difference between a thousand shards and 10 shards
---
10 layers doesn't do a thing, and opens up end game resources to be farmed.
---
are you listening?
---
Lmao
---
I have been called a jerk before which is an attack and uncivil but the mods did not act on my report.
---
In that case calling a *decision* (not a person or group of individuals) “retarded” is not breaking any rules or even reddiquette.
---
I would personally choose a different word but we do not have to play the reddit police.
---
So now the solution is to force communities of players into never communicating together? Easy way to make sure all those communities think the realm is completely dead.
---
You'll be able to enjoy close knit community that holds you accountable for your actions, y'know? Three or Four thousand people per serv... oh wait. 12k people per server, nobody knows anyone in PvE or PvP because of cross-realm BG's and linguistic segregation creating dead zones.
---
New PoE update is looking nice though..
---
Here is a model of a streamer's guild. Do you recognize the cult of personality?

---
huh ive seen a lot of posts about this but actually this makes a lot of god damn sense
---
I don't think they're being overly sensitive. It's a split against mentally handicapped people. There's way better words to describe the point.
---
Calling out shittiness isn't being "overly sensitive"
---
Problem is you don´t know if certain languages bring enough bodies to occupy a server. What is worse than a low pop server? -A low pop server with a language tag.
---
I often let population determine what I play and it is a bad habit as it is inhibiting me from playing what I always play in other MMOs and WoW is the only game that I do this in.
---
I love playing as Archers. In WoW, the Hunter is one of the most popular classes and I don't want to be a part of the majority... But I absolutely loved their new rotations in retail but decided to play my Rogue instead.
---
For Classic, I'm actually basing my decision off of viability more than class density. Sure, Mages may be one of the most popular classes but you're also brining 5/6/7/8 of them to a raid so they're going to be needed and I'd rather not be a meme spec. I don't have time to do that.
---
I was thinking the exact same thing. It’s one thing to watch clips of beta content but a completely different experience to be able to hop in yourself and enjoy every little aspect. 
---
I never played a Tauren in vanilla but randomly started one yesterday and was immersed and had an absolute blast. The music, visuals, skills, and other people all made it extremely enjoyable even though I only progressed to level 9. 
---
Thank you Blizz for allowing this open to everybody and I’m excited for August. 27th.
---
Sure, downloading it now.
---
It resemlbes TBC LFG tool I quite enjoyed using back then.
---
&gt;The one on the right is the Quinta da Regalerias Initiation Well in Sintra Portugal. 
---
At first glance I thought wow that looked so familiar, I must have seen it in a movie or something! Then I remembered I actually went there during a school trip once. 10/10 definitely an awesome place, including the dark, damp caves under the castle where we had to go through it holding hands with no lights allowed.
---
I'm so glad I went on that Portugal trip; I really didn't want to go anywhere at that time, I just wanted to play WoW at home, but there we go.
---
Lisbon fucking sucked, though.
---
Are you aware that most of South America speaks Spanish and Portugese? Even in central and southern Europe French is used as a lingua franca rather than English because they have latinate languages in common. I'm not saying English isn't used as a lingua franca around the world, I'm saying it's not exclusive and that it doesn't mean everyone in Europe is going to speak it.
---
I'm not vouching for layering, but server merging is not an ideal solution either. The truth is, there is no ideal solution it seems -they would've probably went for that, and we all wouldn't argue over this topic if there was an ideal solution-, every possible solution to the tourists issue has its downsides.
---
What the hell is pfquest??
---
Sure, I suppose my aim is to change the culture back to what it was. 
---
Most 40 man raid guilds dont have a bench of every class of good players they can sub in. You usually take your 40 best players, class agnostic--to a point. 
---
If my hunters never ever die to bad, but they do less than my mages who die every other pull...
---
If my mage never dies and lays his dick on the table everytime he casts frostbolt, of course he gets in. 
---
But there is virtually nothing in classic wow that cant be beaten by just being good (gear minimums of course), most fights till AQ has intermittent and avoidable damage to the point that if one is prepared they can survive a long time as dps, alive hunter &gt; dead fury warrior. And if I have 40+ top quality players, then our class really doesnt matter as you will still stomp content...just not as quick if raid was stacked.
---
Lol okay. Whatever you say buddy.
---
Didn't they get a cease and desist over that one?
---
It has been like this for ages, what is the problem?
---
I foes. I don't want to have trouble finding a decent raid group, and I don't want much concurrence getting this sweet purple loot.
---
What a stupid conclusion. Im pretty sure Blizzard does and always will provide support in all the languages in their website. And besides that the realms wont be english realsm. They will be international
---
Yep, every single solitary person in the whole entire world.
---
If you aren't doing raids then make a Paladin and save her life constantly. Having a res and several cooldowns available will empower her character to survive and blow up your enemies in ways a double DPS can't manage.
---
I completely agree with you on how people like you and me will do exactly this and I also think that more people should inform themselves like this.
---
The truth is the bigger part of the crowd will not do this, at least not immediately. You shouldn't expect the regular player to even browse here. I feel like people often overlook communities like this here include only the more dedicated players, especially when considering for beeing part in this a lot need to use a language they are not comfortable with.
---
Great advice!
---
Instead of trying to do anything right now, to change a terrible system, let's do NOTHING, and wait, and just unsubscribe!
---
Great work! You really tried your best!
---
The funny thing is, you are actively fighting AGAINST the people trying to do something about layering by downvoting and disagreeing with everyones comments. So I guess, good work trying to fuck up the game you claim to like?
---
The person you are replying to is not a mod.
---
The reason they're doing this is to save support costs. The same reason we get loot-trading. They don't have to hire people that know all the different European languages=less money to pay for support.
---
inc venezuelan farmers
---
Ahhh popcorn time.
---
Back when they released Vanilla, they also thought it would fail. Whether or not the company closed depended on Vanillas success. As we all know, they completely smashed it with the game, and Blizzard was not just saved, but thrived from that point on.
---
Turn the Clock to 2019. They also think the same game will fail again. Whether or not the company would revitalize it's reputation or not depends on Classics success. 
---
A company that once has succeeded massively, avoiding it's closure, blowing all it's competitors out of the water for several years while they were at it, now acts like it's going to fail with a game that's already proven it's worth.
---
They're acting like losers. What happens when people act like losers, and can't see the worth of their own products? They set themselves up for failure. Just like Blizzard is doing now. A shame, for them and for the loyal fans.
---
If my pserver experience was at all accurate, you can herb and ( I believe) skin while in wolf form.  You also can't be tracked by hunters using track humanoid.
---
This is an obvious misbehavior of the intended system.  cdew saw them so they were clearly already on the same layer. And when they joined party they moved to another layer. Layer changing should only be when party members are on separate layers.
---
then why are you responding if not in the context of the discussion??
---
They didn't ban add-ons like Recursive, they simply broke their functionality.
---
Big facts
---
Ya this doesn't solve anything. It doesn't do anything to address the fact that whole communities will be rolling on unofficial language servers.
---
He never implied it is, he learned french and with that knowledge he was able to understand the roman languages. He even clarified that german and english isnt a roman language by mentioning his skill in them. Seens like you cant even understand english.
---
You asked a question and I replied with an answer. How is that not pertinent?
---
Did you even read the post above me?
---
And then someone gets moderator and locks channel behind password just to troll people.
---
You have no clue how long it will last. Or the impact it will continue to have after it is gone (if it is ever removed).

Literally everybody in europe speaks englisch! German server french, spain, luxembourg and even switzerland?! Im from switzerland, and we dont need our own server! Make it EU English
---
I recognize you are new to this sub so if you aren't up-to-speed on the issue, but the devs had the choice between layering and sharding and chose layering because it makes future server mergers easier and cheaper.
---
Now, even though you are a retail player, it's still a total oversight for you to think servers cost a lot of money. This is a *fifteen year old game* that could run on a 2005 corsair even with the new engine. You're actually trying to argue server blades are expensive? Are you even aware of the entire pserver world that runs on thin air and piddles of donations?
---
I don't get how people with zero knowledge or insight are hopping into this sub and voicing their opinion, as if they know a fucking thing
---
Which would be a quirky funny thing to do once in a while till you realize you and your buddies rolled on the unofficial German server and now it has a permanent fixture on your second monitor.
---
That would make sense, but I hope that is not the case so that looking for groups will be easier, but then people will be flip flopping layers all the time. so lame
---
It is until it isnt. Over time percentages and numbers are accurate but in a single duel against a rogue it may never end up blocking a stun. Essentially it will be useless in that fight. 
---
Unlike an active ability that is used at your discretion and gives you the benefit regardless. Unless of course you miss click or the small chance for people to resist war stomp.
---
Also if I'm playing a rogue or someone who has a stun I will probably just avoid using it against an orc if I can
---
Actizzard won't ban shit as long as the money is right.
---
When you meet someone online, will you try communicating with them in english or french first?
---
When you meet a spaniard, will you talk french to them? A Swede? A German? Italian? Chinese?
---
And do either of the nationalities I mentioned ever expect you to speak their language, or implicitly accept that english is the way to go?
---
&gt;  I'm not saying English isn't used as a lingua franca around the world
---
Cool, because I don't care to argue semantics anymore.
---
Except you would notice the difference, lol. If you can’t you aren’t paying attention.
---
Layering will be removed before people are going to be able to farm anything.
---
In the same vein, I'm not 100% against layering, but I do think it's more harm than good.
---
What problems do you forsee with server merging as described above? (with them being static layers linked from the beginning, therefore sharing a naming database)
---
I know this sounds crazy, but nobody knows how many people will actually play classic, or how long said people will stay.
---
Pretty convenient solution. With much bigger pros then cons.
---
wahhhhhh wahhhhhh I WANNA KILL MY LEVEL 3 WOLF IMMEDIATELY MOMMY
---
I have had my fair share of bad experiences and also good experiences. On the other, smaller pserver we had a Chinese community in the past. Outside of BGs they were SUPER fun to play with.
---
But I am afraid the goods don’t cancel the bads. There were a few situations at least that were super depressing. And since Chinese were no longer allowed on that other pserver, another people took the role of the bad people and frankly I can’t fault anyone for avoiding people from that nationality unless they volunteer to speak English.
---
Why would there be 12k people on a server?
---
I’m enjoying retail :\
---
Stupid question,  but what is the benefit of two monitors while playing WoW? Just so you don't need to Alt-Tab to look things up? I keep seeing people's set ups, and they all have two screens. Can someone please explain this to me.
---
Suggestion
---
Can only layer shift when in a rested area and out of combat for more than 2 mins
---
You have to target them or be in the same group to hear other people’s emotes.
---
Oops never mind I miss read it. I thought he was saying some places require you to log all your downtime
---
Haha imsdal 👍
---
People who upvote a picture of the vanilla box for the 7th time are people I don’t trust.
---
Yeah that totally makes up for not having an entire server where everyone speaks the language, a server where you can communicate perfectly in your native tongue with every random you happen to group up with.  
---
Not :p
---
I played a Druid, Rogue, and Paladin to 60 in the original release so I've been leaning towards Warrior or Shaman. From what I remember Shaman wasn't as effective in the end game compared to Priests and Paladin for healing and Mages and Warlocks for spell damage... But I also think they might be a lot of fun to level. I also expect the biggest class picked to be Warrior so I like the idea of being in the minority which would increase my chances for better loot.
---
bad bot
---
But diversity is strength...
---
&gt; Layering will be removed before people are going to be able to farm anything.
---
I guess you missed the post where Blizzard said it will last anywhere between a few weeks to entire Phase 1
---
Well the issue isn't me wanting to play a different race or thinking i will dissappear in the crowd it's more  that I dont like the idea of being picked Beacause im a priest. They dont care if im good or anything, I will just be picked because Im playing "the best healer". I would rather play something that makes me have to prove myself that im better than the "best healer". My point was then that it kinda sucks to have it like that as I enjoy the priest, just not enough to be a healing vendor instead of a player in the group.
---
A tank and a healer would not have to wait to find 3 dps's, especialy at launch
---
That's the one thing we all seek in an mmo, to be engaged in a fictive world and community. It's not about the graphics, items and whatever. Having a purpose in this big world gives you an identity and really makes you feel like part of it.
---
how do I update Bnet? usually automatic, so I have no idea. im from EU, but my friends also from EU has the option in their launcher.
---
I'm not guessing, they said so.  I think it was that they would eventually introduce it latter, as they did in vanilla, but I forgot the exact timeline.
---
&gt;I'm ashamed that I could read all of that, and I only speak English 
---
Learn what imply means.
---
Naga
---
I’m sure you guys can come together and pick out unofficial servers when it comes time to reserve names
---
Hmm, I don't think targeting them worked for me last night. The Troll in my example was my target during the whole exchange and I didn't hear him.
---
The same is true without layering.
---
29 year old friend of mine (female) loves Asmon...she's also one of those hyper casual mount collectors on retail.
---
its a fucking 20 year old game dude ask google and shut up
---
I mean French is probably the toughest one of those 4, at least regarding the pronunciation and deciphering human speach. English and German were also my non-native languages, but only with French even after a month I had that fealling, that I dont even recognize words inside of a sentence when someone was speaking...
---
Crushridge-EU was also notorious for being full of Italians. Also for being piss poor at the game. Used to hate getting grouped up with them in wrath.
---
I also happened to unintentionally settle on a polish realm. They were decent at the game, but downright assumed 100% of the population was also polish. Getting whispers constantly to join their "gildia" got on my nerves.
---
East servers are apparently based in Chicago, which is pretty odd.
---
What a beautiful reason to let everything happen without ever being able to call anyone out for anything...
---
So I have to whip out the Google translate and troll ALL of the foreign language Reddit's?
---
Sounds time consuming.
---
I've been playing a lot of Division 2 lately and I've actually found it pretty easy to raid with speakers of different languages.
---
Most of them know 1-2 English words to describe a raid mechanic or change focus. It would be really difficult to learn a fight like that but it's perfectly fine for coordination words. Things like: swap, focus &lt;mob&gt;, countdowns, heal &lt;player&gt;, rez &lt;player&gt;, shoot &lt;target&gt;, etc.
---
Youre just factually wrong.
---
Toot your own horn all day long. Trash addon is trash.
---
You actually have a lot of limits that prevent you from automating it. I think there's still pleasure from automation though. I actually derive enjoyment from the challenge of building macros to accomplish goals. 
---
I don't think the drive to do better is a societal construct, I think it's inherent to people. So I argue a game stops being so when the net fun is negative. But I also argue utilitarian hedonic calculus is dumb and not worth arguing over.
---
Hard to say if it does pass retail anyways since blizz was so ashamed by WoD sub numbers that they stopped publishing them.
---
everyone is very confused, and didnt even bother reading anything OP said, they saw LFG and assumed dungeon finder?
---
You also have to remember this guys career is making people watch him on stream. If people took everything Anthony Jeselnik said as being 100 percent serious it’d be a problem
---
This is actually shit and will make the servers like Private servers...
---
The whole point was i didn't want another server with 10k people.. only 2000 of whom i can actually interact with.
---
Not at once. It started with a million or two and grew from that, and even then, the servers were unplayable to weeks and for some servers months after launch.
---
How did you come up with that number?
---
What about the smaller nations who speak like 4 languages fluently? Most of them speak better English than the average Brit, lol.
---
I don't think I've downvoted anyone, I just think people are engaging in outrage culture regarding a system that's still in beta. 
---
It's not live yet, creating a bunch of hysteria is silly. It's the first week only, pretending like it's otherwise and making up scenarios is so overdramatic.
---
ilvl matters way less in Classic. with many BiS items being around 60ilvl
---
Welcome to Vanilla?
---
I know it's a joke, but there are actual sad mongoloids out there, thinking this way.
---
Sorry if it came out that way. Forgot to mention that bit. If someone doesn't know the language then of course It's a given that they will play on their own language. I was just stating that I wouldn't play on a server and/or client that is in my own native language because it sounds really awful in games, especially anything translated. 
---
In the end everyone is free to do what ever they want. Didn't want to upset anyone.
---
Retail bad classic good upvotes pls
---
is this a real question? because you disregard its relevance to the discussion. you called it a strawman when it had everything to do with op's claim that the behaviour of watching streamers is an absolute wrong. I asked how it's different from reading books and you replied how. in the context of the discussion, your explanation is then a moral right and defensible because of the reasons you gave.   
---
If they had to do it by level, 1-10 would make way more sense. 10-20 is a HUGE area in terms of where/what a character can do
---
Nice setup, man! 
---
Doing a completely fresh build this summer in anticipation of classic and the only thing I can't really nail down is the monitor setup I want to go with. How do you like your ultrawide and how does it perform with your other monitor? 
---
I'm torn between 2560x1440p 144hz x2, or a single ultrawide. Unless I can get away with an ultrawide and a single 2560x1440p on a 2080ti. Man, this just gets me even more hyped for Classic!
---
Sunken temple er castle
---
This has been annoying me beyond words in every stress test since the first one. I’ve reported it in every test period, but intend to make a video in the next one just to clearly show how broken it is.
---
I played a Warlock all through vanilla, and in its current state the class is nearly unplayable—would be devastated if they don’t fix it by launch since I was incredibly excited to jump into the Classic world again.
---
If you find the complaining easier, continue doing you
---
Imagine thinking wanting to play or meet a "celebrity" is childish. Plenty of "adults" would love to meet say their favorite writer, actor, educator. Its almost like you don't get to decide what makes someone an adult. I would say judging people because of a screenshot for a video game makes you a child. rEaL adults don't care what other people do as long as it doesn't affect them. See kind of stupid to play this game isn't it?
---
cant fucking get stats off an item outside of str,agi, stam, intel
---
i was very upset as i was gonna make a comparison tool
---
It's about *options*. People can and will roll on english servers where you will have all countries not represented by national servers, and get the exact same experience you had. Or, they can choose to be with fellow countrymen, especially for those with bad english skills.
---
I cant understand how less options is better..
---
The vast majority of mages won't be able to AOE grind anyways.  Too much mob competition on launch unless you're way ahead of the pack.
---
Just go single target build.
---
No it won;t, but don't despair.   For between €50-€100  you can buy a used PC that will run it fine  (same in $$)   If you can't spend that, you can't afford the monthly fee I assume .
---
/petmoveto will bring up the circle, pet does not respond when you click to place the circle. I wonder if this is intended or a bug though. 
---
Was /being able to move your pet in such a way a thing in Vanilla? I seem to remember that capability coming along much later
---
Dunno man. The classic beta revived wow streaming more than a new xpac would.
---
At launch someone could go to the arena and get agm trinket early
---
&gt; They never considered people getting them all at the same time.
---
Yet they didn't bother to remove them in Vanilla. Why wouldn't they?
---
Shamans are a great hybrid for macros. You can do the same [help]/[harm] as my druid to automatically switch from healing to damage depending on the target. You can also condense your totems and shocks down to a few buttons, and have easy access to even really situational totems.
---
Every forum only represents a vocal minority of people who care enough about a game to seek out a place to talk about it, and/or people looking for a place to bitch about the game. Obviously there's a lot of overlap there. Reddit compounds the problem because it, by design, promotes a hive mind mentality where any sort of dissension from popular opinion is suppressed. For gaming subreddits, this tends to create a perfect storm of bitching and shitposting.
---
Keep in mind that the people here represent a very, very small proportion of the game's future population. Some of them are people just really excited about the game and looking for an outlet to talk about it, but many of them are just here to bitch. Unfortunately the nature of reddit drags almost everyone into the bitching camp since that tends to be the prevailing opinion, and everything else is downvoted or dies in new.
---
Just take heart in that these people are not the majority.
---
I mean, they did have to pay people to port Classic to the new client and get it working, along with bug fixing, working on servers including during stress testing, and probably plenty of other behind the scenes things.
---
A closed* beta on which they and they alone control the population... If they can't fill 5 servers that's entirely because they didn't want to fill five servers. It has nothing to do with interest in the game...
---
The amount of people that login in day 1 of classic will completely dwarf the amount of people that logged in day 1 of vanilla.
---
I’ll test it tonight when I get on the beta and let you know.
---
i rounded up from 15
---
Cool dude!
---
For sure. Since all of my posts here are being buried by disagreement downvotes without counter-arguments, I highly doubt this will be anything like the vanilla we remember. 
---
I'll still give it a shot if or when they remove layering, though, but trying to explain "how it was" is definitely an exercise in frustration.
---
Cool. Unsubscribe and go cry somewhere else.
---
Considering a mage doesnt need help AOE grinding on their own...adding in a second body is a pure leech and would half your xp, roughly. 
---
Most aoe areas, once you get good at them, you can pull then entire thing, kill them, drink up and catch the respawn, so all a second person does is quicken the speed at which you kill them...so maybe 30s instead of a minute...but the multi minute respawn remains...
---
Go away troll!
---
Well, with the increasing power of the AI nowadays, i really like topics which can derive from it. All this human vs machines interaction is fascinating and video games are a nice laboratory for that.
---
But hey, i know the joy of code and building code like these being a programmer myself. :)
---
hakkar and crushridge was the unofficial italian server
---
How? This is all on the same faction
---
I'm sure the server technology they have now is much better than the hardware they were using in 2005.
---
It's been a long time, but when I was on FFXI, they had an awesome auto-translate function for the names of everything game related as well as common phrases that would normally be said in party play. It worked very well.
---
Cheers!
---
Or you could have some patience?
---
Changes I'd support:  
---
You heading over and posting this on r/classicwowplus instead.

When I played Rogue, it was simple. Gouge + Bandage. Eventually Pickpocket and pick item. I also used some macro that used /me has succesfully pickpocket "name" for X bronze/silver coins. People would always freak out about it. Good old times.
---
Are they wrong? It's reasonable to assume that most retail players with an active sub are going to try Classic for some length of time. It's also reasonable to assume that the large majority of those players aren't going to play it long term. As much as the community on this sub loves Classic and thinks it's going to be a smash hit, at the end of the day it's a niche game with a much slower pace and less things to do. There is a reason Blizzard added more stuff over the years, players constantly asked for it. And those same players aren't all gonna abandon retail for Classic.

The 3k mark is known as the vanilla peak pop, and Ion said in the same sentence where he spoke about how layering will only stay a few weeks that each layer simulates (not sure if that's the word he used) a server population of back then.
---
Hey i just got that last night! I too was impressed by it and felt accomplished for finishing that quest line that involved walking all over SW haha
---
I want arena :/
---
The community thinks it's posted all the time and people should shut up about it.
---
Fishing, and making cooking 1-300 kits from fish and fish recipes.
---
Friend list building will not be affected by layers, as your layer will have many people in it. One could argue that queue times would "affect your friend list" too so I'm not sure what you want here.
---
- I love leveling with mages, free water and a smooth flow, perfect aoe combo.
---
- Arms warriors for pvp. 
---
- Warlocks and druid for dungeons, the thorns/retri aura/fire shield combo is hillarious xD (how im going to level in dungs with my friends)
---
-raids: anyone that will take me, im rolling Ret.

προβλήματα που έχει ο κόσμος
---
It bothers me because nobody has a better solution. There isn’t one. It’s going to take people a long time to level, people aren’t going to have time to exploit heavily like they do when it’s a bullshit stress test or beta.
---
It’s the same post, over and over again, just trying to get a bunch of people to say “wow man you’re so smart and right.” If you want to talk about it, talk about it on the official forums.
---
Pickpocket is off the GCD.

Yo forgot to add "classic wow starter pack memes" into your classic wow start pack meme

Best Class and Profession combo
---
As  like most of you. I and my friends are super excited for the re-release  of classic WoW. Right now my friends and I have all picked out the  classes we are each going to play. I am going to be playing rogue and  figured Skinning and Leather working would be the 2 best options...I  think. Either that or Mining and Engineering. I think my main focus  would be raiding and maybe a mix of WPvP. But from my experience  raid  gear makes a huge difference in WPvP so im not sure engineering would  make that much of a difference when it comes to WPvP.
---
As for the classes my friends are going to be playing, I figured the best prof. combo for their classes would be:
---
Warrior: Mining/Blacksmithing
---
Paladin:Mining/Blacksmithing (Same as the Warrior because I figured 2 people could make weapons for our whole group maybe)
---
Mage: Enchanting/Tailoring
---
Druid: Herbalism/Alchemy
---
Hunter: Mining/Engineering
---
Priest: Jewellcrafting/Inscription
---
Basically  we are doing this so we can kinda mostly rely on each-other if we need  armor, weapons, enchants, etc. made for ourselves.
---
that one wasnt done by blizzard  
---
only expansion trailers and such
---
I used to portal my alts in vanilla.  The portal exists for 60sec, you just need a 2nd person to hold open a raid.  Very easy to find someone when you can gift water for free.
---
Are you suggesting that a level 30 player should only find level 30+ players in their capital city? That's a bigger change than layering abuse itself.
---
There's no evidence to suggest RP players play the game any less than regular players.
---
But how much of that was new development and not just them ripping it out of the current wow and make it work with an older engine?
---
I mean complaining is pretty easy. I don't understand why people want there to be unofficial  language servers. It clearly doesn't benefit anybody.
---
I dont think i used it wrong. You have to put a little more to convince me that i am because you seem hella stupid to me atm.
---
If you didn’t say to leave the other 500 things that can be abused, do you suggest to remove all of them one by one? Because that is a recipe for disaster.
---
So does the launch numbers. This is *classic* not vanilla.
---
But they way they're layering, it's basically sharding.  Layering was explained as you join Thunderfury Layer 1 and you're on Layer 1 until later on when the layers merge.  This is just sharding.
---
Oh, I wish.
---
Well... authentic classic experience I guess?
---
Considerably low concentrates of salt for that matter
---
Then link the interview where they say they'll be sticking with the population cap that only was limited by technology of the time and that Layering will only be in for a few weeks.
---
I agree. I just want it fixed lol. I don’t want it removed. Obviously I’d truly rather not have to wait!!! I know they can fix it. It’s just will they... I really hope so.
---
If you're just going to be anti-classic, why not go back to r/wow?  Your posts are not really wanted here.  Go enjoy retail.
---
Correct, it is proven you are a dumbass.
---
so you reply to the question out of context with no interest in pushing forward the argument. gotcha. this was a waste of our time
---
This man is clearly delusional. 
---
Fjottleif from Lefsefjord will soon arrive at your house to carve the bloodeagle
---
You need to stop asking pointless questions.
---
I never saw that many, I saw 18k in January of 2017 but whatever not the point. It’s basically down to do they want to do the cost effective way or please the community way. If their stock chart is anything to base this off of, I’d say they’re going cost effective.
---
They have those.... The debuff limit is a great example of something that was put in for tech limitations, and they are keeping that.
---
Translation add-on might become a thing?
---
&gt; I'm not huge into RP and I've never played on that type of server before, but what I'm basically looking for is a slower pace. I plan to duo level tank/healer combo and we're really interested in doing all the old dungeons. Since we only have about 2.5 hours on most weekdays to play I'm afraid we're going to be woefully behind everyone on a 'normal' server and have trouble getting groups. My co-leveler feels that RP servers might have a slower pace, but that people on RP servers will be less interested in dungeons and therefore we will have trouble finding groups.
---
You'll be behind on any server, don't worry about the others - RP servers can be hit or miss as far as population goes - if you guys eventually want to raid you'll want a higher pop.
---
But if it's just dungeons and occasional pvp - won't matter what server you go :)
---
Yea it's a dick move on Blizzards part. It's starting to feel like they are actively trying to sabotage wow classic.
---
It's like when you put every topping on your soft serve :)
---
You won't be unable to find people at your level, they might out pace you but alts and late starters will fill in the wake.
---
RP servers are better for RP, you won't likely see more active lowbies on there.
---
"Layering needs to go!"... Proceeds to accept a group invite to join a different layer.
---
The player pop will certainly reduce after 3 months by the class distribution will likely remain the same or close to it
---
Oh that's actually really interesting then. Does it work if you try to use it on a non-humanoid? If it doesn't, personally I'd move the pickpocket part to a shift modifier just for UI simplicity.
---
Nothing until layering is removed 😁
---

---
Hype will draw in A LOT of people... Most of them will quit soon because they dont really like mmorpgs.
---
I watch a lot of british comedy, most of them have a stage persona, but with them like as well with Asmon, you can clearly tell when it is a joke vs them speaking to themselves.
---
low effort..
---
&gt; lazy
---
Lazy would be doing nothing, capping servers to the old max, and then having 50% of the playerbase sitting in queue, and the other 50% camping quest mobs they need because their aren't enough to go around in a fresh server environment.
---
That doesn't sound like fun.
---
👍
---
Looks like that scene out of Pan's Labyrinth
---
From my understanding, only battle.net is affected. The gameservers itself don't store private data, just the characters..?
---
I’m sure those really small servers would love to have a talk with you because I’m sure they would like there BG’s to not be a two hour wait
---
Oh, they released the game already? No? It's still in beta? Wow.. imagine that..
---
&gt; but if their client is in their first language then you're stuck googling what the fuck was just linked. 
---
If you click the link the tooltip is in your native language iirc.
---
FUCK THERE ARE DOZENS OF THEM. AS POLISH I'VE GOT REALLY BAD FEELINGS ABOUT GERMANY RAID ON CLASSIC. REALLY BAD FEELINGS
---
So if I ruin dungeons on Chromaggus 1, I will still be able to ruin dungeons Chromaggus 2 and 3 and nobody will know me. Nice.
---
I'll be the guy dominating and inflating certain key markets.
---
I replied to your question. If your question was really irrelevant to the context of the argument itself, then yes, this was a waste of time.
---
Start simple and work your way up.
---
I play a druid because it's the lowest played class. In pvp people aren't as good at battling classes they dont see a bunch so it gives me an edge.
---
🤩
---
Imagine world PvP on a realm where this happened! Up to once every 30 minutes per realm a player will die because there's a guy with a BiS trinket. Game breaking!
---
It was way better in TBC.
---
Hey man I was there too, what side and guild? ;)
---
No Pserver community could hold a candle to my previous national server. Mixing all communities doesnt give you many diversity and cultures, it gives you the opposite : no culture. Everything falls to the "lowest common denominator".
---
I just can't fathom the idiocy of some people on this sub.
---
I understand what you mean, and I think to a degree that is what blizzard tried to fix too, but it backfired horribly. I think they wanted to dumb down the game so bad players could perform, while also making super difficult competetive mythic+ and raid encounters. Well, turns out you cant please everyone and now we have this amalgamation (retail) with 17 different difficulties for everything, obscure azerite power effects but no tier sets, rng pvp gear but gear doesnt really matter and more..  
---
Honestly I think they just lost touch along the way and now theyre in too deep with no idea how to fix the game
---
The human starting zones (Elwyn, Westfall, Redridge, Duskwood) are the best designed in the game compared to any on horde.
---
So your suggestion is a vanilla cap of 3k but with massive queues? Sounds fun.
---
I couldn't do this... I'd stare at it all day and daydream of the life I once lived ans wish I could have back... :(
---
Breaks way more than fix.
---
You clearly don't. Oh right, you think the stress test is the released product. Forgot that's how this subreddit thinks.
---
In retail, for the Americas region, there were a couple servers that quickly became known as the Brazillian servers and everybody knew it and Brazillians went there. Are Europeans so bad at organizing that they can't figure it out for themselves?
---
My god people are being retarded ITT.
---
Zoomers are the 'ultimate go-along-to-get-along' generation ever.  The is no group that is more desperate to conform with what appears to be the popular opinion of their peers.
---
They will tip the opinion of any any thread depending on which way it leans, early on.
---
Donnerzorn, Gesegnete Klinge des Windsuchers!
---
This was actually what I disliked about retail, every healer felt the same and had no impact and were just healbots, that's definitely not the case for vanilla... well except for druids perhaps, they're a bit underwhelming.
---
You will definitely still have to prove yourself because people have been minmaxing the setups for many years on private servers. 
---
On private servers you would be running with 5 or 6 healers in your 40 man group, in Vanilla we'd have 8-10. 
---
So I believe classic will be more of a challenge than Vanilla for healers and you'll definitely feel if someone is not pulling their weight no matter the class because they'll all have very specific roles when you're with so few.
---
Does #showtooltip show a cooldown in Classic?
---
My thoughts here.
---
no wonder you can't cope with foreign people you can't even keep yourself from being an incel with english speaking persons
---
If there's like 6 realms in total, "takeovers" won't succeed because they wouldn't have had much choice in the realm they play on anyway.
---
I've been playing around with druid talents and noticed swiftmend being the same mana cost as stormstrike for shaman. Granted druid is going to have more mana than an enhancement shaman, but it still seems steep. 
---
Are the big ones to get Imp rejuve, tranquil spirit, gift of nature? How big a deal is healing threat, is it important to take the threat reduction talent?
---
My goal was one spec for both pvp and pve, with like 11 or 12 in feral, and some in balance.
---
You forgot "karma whoring MS paint photo of classic wow scene due to lack of beta "
---
Once per layer-sized population on the realm, and respective competition with those of the populations trying to do so too.
---
You got it buddy. Fishing for upvotes you caught a shiny blue one!
---
...Sure.
---
Okay your 2 groups of population are 
---
- The entire population of italy
---
- Italian WoW players
---
You can not say what applies to one group must apply to the other.
---
Lets take language out of it for a second. Why not say  "roughly 51% of people in italy are female" 
---
Following your rules that must transfer to - 51% of the Italian WoW playerbase are female. Which we both know is probably not true
---
One of my earliest functional macros was a /pvp /concede macro to gank low level players on my PvE server. I'd wear crummy looking gear and challenge them to duels. I'd try to hit the macro as they were using an attack, which would automatically try to target me. That would flag them as well, and then I could corpse camp them for \~10-15 minutes. I was an evil warlock, after all.
---
Except that many of us want to reserve our names on august 13th when that opens up, and if I guess wrong and end up on Asmongold's realm, well rip my common name. Asmongold specifically stated he wants to try and play alone without a crowd chasing him. Which is IMPOSSIBLE. But I still worry he'll try, meaning we won't know his realm until August 27th. Many streamers will be fun, i'm okay with being on the same realm as a lot of them. I'm okay with a streamer attacking a city, its something to defend, fun stuff. I don't complain for the sake of complaining. Asmongold is just a jerk that has openly stated he will be ninja looting, stealing things, and camping towns with his zerg-army. And he'll be Alliance, and i'm going Horde.
---
I do agree that the EU problem is vastly more important, I just want to give my reason for being so anti-streamer. It's really anti-asmongold
---
Okay so you would rather them wasting money on the project so that the investment doesn't pay off? That sure is one way of nailing the coffin shut for any future Classic-like projects like TBC or even keeping the servers running for more than a year.
---
So you gonna sit there and say mythic chest and pop chest aren't loot boxes? Get outta here
---
Just make all the french have to be alliance and all the germans have to be horde.
---
HoJ is BiS for a lot of people.  I feel like if you are up front about rolling on it, it should be cool.  And I would definitely roll on it even if I was tanking the dungeon for this reason.
---
How much of these work in Classic?
---
1. I know "target=mouseover" wasn't added until TBC, and "@mouseover" came even later.  
---
2. The "#showtooltip" with the ? icon was a staple of my macros for a long time, but it was not available in Vanilla.  Is that in Classic?
---
3. In Classic, is there a difference between "Help" and "Noharm", or "Harm" and "Nohelp" conditions?  I know there were subtle differences even as far as WotLK (or longer) that broke some of my macros until I switched.
---
4. Will we have access to the focus target frame in Classic?  This is another thing that wasn't added until later.
---
5. Can we mark {skull} or {cross} with a macro?
---
you do you buddy
---
Oh sweet summer child
---
If you're not activelly against this then you haven't fully grasped the downsides. Good luck when you roll on a server and it becomes an unofficial french server within two months and you won't understand 90% of chat.
---
Huh? Talk about something not being relevant.
---
&gt;I'd be happy with plenty of changes because I'm confident in my ability to design a good game.
---
Send Blizzard your resume. You could truly be the savior, if what you say is true. Or you're talking out of your ass.
---
Hey, for those who aren't language nerds, how do I say 'German' in German?
---
It's a lot tougher than retail. I'm finding life without a guild to be a harsher existence but CBA looking for one
---
Helping Warlocks &amp; SPriests new to the Vanilla experience gear up.   
---
Plan on grinding satyrs non-stop to make Felcloth Gloves for everyone once Phase 2 drops. Plus running Dawn's Gambit Scholo runs for Dark Advisor's pendant, passing out the less mat-intensive Felcloth gear, and helping other Warlocks with their Dreadsteed quest since IIRC you can re-use some of the materials to lessen the burden on others working through the summoning.
---
Ahh wonderful. Personal insults. I'm actually impressed by you. You tell people to use Google, but seem incapable of using it yourself.
---
I like how your picture was used for the other thread's WoW Classic Starter pack.
---
Those are all good points, but you're ignoring one of the biggest ones. A huge portion of the initial population are going to be active retail players, or people who only played WoW after WOTLK lets say. Most of those players won't stick with Classic because it has a much slower pace with much less stuff to do.
---
 I'd say a large portion of people who played Vanilla don't even follow WoW anymore, they're all adults now in their 30s or late 20s. It's only anecdotal, but I'd say maybe 10% of the people I used to raid with back in the day still play WoW. And these were hardcore WoW players that just quit cold turkey and never looked back.
---
In contrast, private servers were full of people who had a specific desire to seek out and play wonky builds of Vanilla, and those servers still had poor retention rates. I think it's pretty reasonable to say that Classic would be lucky to retain half it's initial population over the 1st few months. Very likely for it to lose a lot more than that.
---
I considered it a bit for my alt
---
It might be easier to sneak into some raids on an alt, if the class isn’t too popular 
---
But for main I’ll play what I want
---
Pro gamer move
---
That was the most polite and respectful "Prove it, bitch" I've ever seen. Kudos to you for the kind and eloquent discourse, ya bitch.
---
Sad thing is, by expecting less people to have interest in your game you can kill your game. Remember the first two weeks of Warlords? Subs increased by over 3 million players, a lot of them new, but Blizzard shit the bed with their servers and killed off any hype for the game by having it be unplayable at launch. Subs then tanked to the lowest ever because of garrisons and cut content, and then they just stopped tracking them.
---
I really want Classic to be a success, but I don't think Blizzard can bring it back without them sabotaging themselves.

Just one song on repeat. Drowning Pool - Bodies. Nothing screams 04-05 era Warcraft more accurately than that.
---
I'm almost certain, but I'm not in the beta. I believe it shows exactly the thing as in your spellbook, rather than simply using the same icon art.
---
Oh god, are you really that slow or are you intentionally messing with me because I didn't word it 100% correct?
---
A fact: Blizzard does not create German/French servers. The location does not fucking matter. The point is that they don't create servers for individual languages. That's the entire argument. There are only a few possibilities why they do it. The biggest possibility, as mentioned by OP, is that Blizzard believes the game to not be successful enough. "Not successful enough" means not even enough German players for German servers. 
---
On Retail there are less Oceanic players than German players. If there are not enough players for German servers, there are not enough players for Oceanic servers.

---
Well, if you have the element of surprise you can probably get the garrote, two SS, rupture off before the guy turns around and starts swinging. But cheap shot is safer. If it does get resisted you can always run away. 
---
It's not all about blindly charging into battle 1v1 against warriors! You need to be opportunistic, and to escape if you are at a disadvantage!  
---
After, it depends on whether you feel confident enough with your burst to try and DPS down the remainder. Do you have a cold blooded eviscerate and a blind? Do you have preparation or vanish still up? It's never a bad idea to continue to get away with bleed kiting as long as you feel like you can get away. It's better to blow a Vanish or Blind before you get a big Deep Wounds bleed on you, not after.
---
In Kishkumen's [fight against Maydie](https://youtu.be/drrvQliCvB8?t=298) in the first Roguecraft video, you can see he opts to open up Cheap Shot and get a 4 point rupture off before immediately Vanishing. But you can see how much HP that one 4 pt rupture eats away. That is almost 25% life of an extremely geared warrior. He does the same thing to another warrior [later on](https://youtu.be/drrvQliCvB8?t=564). The one rupture took off almost half the guy's life. Bleeds are stupid good against plate. 
---
He explained this in the recent return to Classic podcast that him and his brother went onto a PTR and tested out all the stunlock, and against geared warriors they had to get the HP pool down enough to buy them enough of a window to get the warrior down without eating huge overpower crits.
---
What about the casual blizzard customer that takes a week off from his work to play some classic and wastes his week off in queues or trying to tag boars? There's no comfortable compromise for everyone involved. All solutions sacrifice something else. It is what it is, I'm playing it anyways (Classic feels buttery smooth compared to other options) , at some point I've quit trying to do Blizzard's job for them.
---
K see you August 27th
---
Incorrect.  There is a lower threshold up close (can't remember if it's melee or 10 yards).  If you are at 120% threat at range, you will not pull aggro.  If you walk into melee range without doing any threat, you will get aggro as the threshold is 110% there.
---
That's what classic is for. As soon as classic launches I'll be back there once again
---
Why can't you losers just be Americans? #meltingpot

I don't know why, but I started giggling like an idiot when I read that.
---
There are non English speakers in retail why can’t you just simply not engage with them if it’s such a big deal to all of you I’m sure they’d rather see players around then be in a empty ass server with a few stragglers and make it feel like an rpg and not an mmo
---
You have to be in a group with them. Thought it's always been that way?
---
I wooshed.

Non existent addon is non existent.

There is a chest that spawns one arena master trinket (green thing) along with other high lvl items. If you have 12 arena master trinkets you can combine them into 1 arena grand master trinket which doesn’t have a level requirement.

How about you make like a tree, AND GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE
---
Yea, that makes sense and it what I believe it was put in the game for. My response was more directed at people who think that LFR is a source of gear.
---
Right, but they're splitting your specific small friendgroup to join communities they want to. 
---
It just seems weirdly selfish to me to want to not have language specific servers just so your friends don't have the option to go play on the server they would rather play on.
---
1-3: Yup, it uses the modern macro system.
---
4: I'm not totally sure, I'm not in the beta and haven't been watching the streamers much.
---
5: Yup, here's how: https://wow.gamepedia.com/MACRO_targetmarker

Thats because the classic client interface version changed, just load anyways, should work fine!

2012 is after Classic.

Trying to find it but I'm on my phone. Its the one where he's sitting on a coach.
---
Are you on meth?
---
Feral dmg was higher on pservers than on classic by like 20%.
---
Can backfire though. There is only a certain volume in the market and prices can change over time. The question becomes can you move it all? If you can, can you do it fast enough? And does you adding so much at once to the market affect the price on its own?
---
So yeah just gotta keep in mind there is a risk involved. And you need to manage your bankroll accordingly.
---
Where is your flex? Oh right, being 13 isn't worth mentioning lmao.
---
I feel like that would run it but I didn’t know wow has 4K capability? I thought they only offered 1080p, that’s Fantastic if I’m wrong, I just didn’t know wow offered 4K.
---
&gt; That was the most polite and respectful "Prove it, bitch" I've ever seen. Kudos to you for the kind and eloquent discourse, ya bitch. 
---
Much appreciated, ya hoe.
---
Druid I would guess. They are the only class that can do some of all four roles. If not them then a class that can at least do 3 so probably paladin?
---
Are you stupid, what Else is je supposed to do?
---
Doesn't seem to have the Ironforge print for sale on his site. Did you privately message him for a print or just seen to be sold out?
---
Yep they’re wrong. Polls with a decent sample size on here show the majority are long-lapsed former WoW players who do not currently play retail (think it was around 60 percent). What retail players think/want will not determine the future of Classic. 
---
There is a market for Classic completely independent of people who currently play retail. As the guy above pointed out - 120 million or so unique accounts have been created in WoW’s lifetime, the overwhelming majority of whom no longer play. A 1-2 percent return rate makes Classic a smash hit. Larger than that makes Classic a contender with retail.
---
In Vanilla you couldn't get the same icon art.

Yep, even the 1.12.1 client runs at 4K. I have a 9900x and a 2080ti in my main rig, and I get like 320fps if I don’t lock it. I’m just wondering how low I can go, and still get solid perf.
---
I'm pretty sure the ideas been tossed around a few times that they don't want Classic to succeed to the point that it affects their retail subscriptions. 
---
Which is retarded, because they're making money either way.
---
It's not a question of mindset. It's about language skill.
---
Assuming you don't speak much French, would you like to play on a French server?

I guess not and there's the answer to your initial question.

No u

if you want the extreme experience in fully fleshed out ultra-dultra HD at 60 frames per second or higher I suggest the russell hobbs buckingham 4-slice toaster 20750 brushed stainless steel which can be bought on [amazon.com](https://amazon.com). it has variable browning control and is ideal for tea cakes and wider items for its wide slots. it's also 55% percent faster than previous models with its latest cycle-optimizing technology.

if you're more interested in a bang for your buck model I suggest the sage BOV820BSS smart oven pro with elements IQ which comes with 10 pre-set cooking functions and convection fan for smart and fast cooking.

That's kind of saying the same thing in different words, and it might be true. I'm not sure. I would like to believe that Blizz has data on this kind of thing.
---
I think you did understood that my numbers are in conjuncture with what Blizzard expects.
---
Basically, Blizzard expects less than 300k players, worldwide, to return for Classic. And my numbers are just presenting a perspective that it will be FAR MORE players that will return.
---
And since it's about RETURNING players, my numbers are for launch. It is IMPLIED.
---
Whether they will stay long term, or be a lower, or a greater number, is not the point.
---
The point is that Blizzard expectations are based on SUPPOSITIONS, because there are no metrics, to date, for how popular Classic WoW will be.
---
When your game had 12 million concurrent subs, and way over 100 million players since Vanilla, to expect less than 300k (based on their decision not to have language based realms for EU) is plain INSANITY.
---
REGARDLESS if those 300k players will be at launch, 1 year later, or whatever.
---
See you on release day.
---
What do you even base your understanding on?
---
Switzerland would have a word
---
Even the eyes were dulled... remember to stay hydrated
---
It's ironic because sharding would actually be better. Layering is bottom heavy so it's far easier to abuse the more you level. At least sharding would be a zone by zone basis
---
Did I miss some announcement?
---
I think it is find but it should be balanced around people having 30 ping not 400.
---
Use castsequence to blow all cooldowns by spamming one button.
---
    /castsequence reset=120, Blade Flurry, Adrenaline Rush, {others, e.g. Blood Fury}, Sinister Strike, Thistle Tea
---
4. So you haven't been *focusing* on it? 
---
5. I'll have to read it later, can't get to gaming sites at the moment.
---
Haha, very funny, but since it does run on the BFA client the requirements are higher exponentially than the original client.
---
You have to. They "can't" duplicate world bosses.
---
To be fair, giving the fact that they are not event doing DE/FR/ES realms, it really looks like they only plan to launch a bunch of servers and then layer the shit out of them...
---
at least there are some advantages from being from NA
---
It’s not necessarily wasting money, if you keep a large crowd of people who may end up not playing given the current state. However you’re asking me and I don’t care for any future expansions, and obviously if the game is a hit the whole server issue isn’t going to be too expensive to keep running, so yeah I’d like for them to remove it. I was just on the stress test recently and logged off almost immediately Bc I could tell I was on the wrong layer when there was barely any players around me. Went right back to a private server.
---
Bagnon doesn't work on Classic. Most addons are broken.
---
Ha
---
Look above and behold a BFA tool. Are you trying to get a job at activision corporate office?
---
Paladins are the best healers
---
Whats the go to spec at 60 for mages? 
---
Is Frost the way to go? or is fire better at 60?
---
Iv never liked arcane
---
Although I agree with the poster above, I can understand  you.
---
Having watched DragonBall in my native language for all of my childhood, watching it again in japanse isn't the same thing haha.
---
You'll have a problem keeping 60 FPS in cities and raids, but otherwise should be fine.
---
Weak bait.
---
If you go Devilsaur LW and Skinning you can gear most of your group up in terms of DPS gloves/legs. Pretty solid. I'd probably go Mining/Engineering and just buy the leather/items from someone in game.
---
Or you could have more realms....
---
Rogue who does nothing but PVP, just like the old days. 
---
If anyone from Bleeding Hollow is playing you'll know my name.
---
From what I understand all complaints about layering will become moot a few weeks after launch.

No im not a streamer. To hop to a different layer i just asked people in world chat to invite me to their party which switched me over to a different layer which had another chest.
---
It's probably because the devs don't expect many to actually stick with classic long enough to establish healthy sized community. So many will play because of Hype, or rose tinted glasses, or because their bored of BFA and classic is free. 
---
What if they'r actually right but the servers are even more dead after 3 months?
---
2.5 hours on most weekdays, so probably an average of 5 days per week, or 12.5 hours total per week.  Sorry if the post wasn't clear, I'll edit for clarity.  Ty.
---
&gt; The two photos are different locations.
---
#BETRAYER
---
Yeah but I still can’t pick a main tho.
---
Didn't realize having 3-4x the servers has no associated cost and that all players will magically spread out evenly.
---
Probably that guy who’s multiboxing if I make myself known.  I plan on sticking to mostly dungeons and NOT being on a PvP realm, so who knows how much I’ll actually interact with people outside of the AH.
---
Hey, I have those same monitors! When upgrading my rig for classic, aka, spending a lot of money to play a super old game, I treated myself to new peripherals too.  
---
I remember looking at that keyboard in Best Buy but not getting it because that armrest isn’t detachable. I settled with a Corsair K55 - the armrest is detachable.
---
Haha well thats great as that was my pick after not wanting to play priest.
---
Increasing spawn rates? They won't touch the 1.12 code with a 10 ft pole. And they're right to do so.
---
Maybe I'm wrong, I suppose I'll see when it launches. Either way, I'm not too troubled by it. I'll have fun either way
---
Another repost
---
Perhaps I am remembering it incorrectly. It's been quite some time since I've played WoW so I wouldn't be surprised if I'm wrong.
---
if layering is in when people hit 60 expect the economy to be 100% fucked for the lifetime of that server
---
people will layer hop and end up with 1000 black lotus's
---
I will be sex robot.

1. Horde zones and quests were an afterthought unlike retail, Alliance is supreme for content in Classic.
---
2. Alliance races are able to wear shoes and armour without holes in them.
---
3. Evil genius gnomes.
---
4. Paladins.
---
5. Not edge lords.
---
Imagine actually being this stupid 😂
---
I didn't compared layering with Nost. Why the hell are you do it?
---
I was just saying WHY Blizzard is assuming that Classic will fail. And a big part is Nost data that shows 80% dropout before lvl 20.
---
And that data is INCORRECT, because the FUNDAMENTALS are wrong.
---
I don't give a fuck on what was better : 20k people and being IMPOSSIBLE for 80% (those that quit before lvl 20) to do anything, or layering.
---
This is not the point of the discussion.
---
That would be fantastic. I also have this sneaking suspicion that half of the streamers who claim they will be on a PvP server will actually go to a PvE server.
---
Just do a bit of colonialism again to get those countries speaking English. Worked for a good chunk of the world already.
---
I'm going on what the developers have said. What are you basing your theories on?
---
Yes they aren’t loot boxes. Just because it’s loot from a box like chest that doesn’t make it a loot box. Try playing a game like Star Trek Online with actual Loot (lock) Boxes and then compare it to BFA where the Mythic and PvP chests are not monetized in any way.

entitled europeans
---
All good I understood because I can read :)
---
&gt; You can't tell me you haven't had better gaming experiences with people living in different countries. Damn, some of the best times I've had are when we're barely able to communicate.
---
No I absolutely can tell you that. Get your fucking anecdotal bullshit out of here
---
Priest would be pretty nuts
---
Launches are not suppose to be "seamless". If your launch was seamless it means you are not expectional. 
---
Most great games have had rocky launches.
---
&gt; dont they still deserve to be able to experience wow
---
Thats a hard *NO* from me. Learn english, and learn to communicate with the rest of the internet, like the rest of the western world. People who demand translated products is just beyond me. I can be lenient if its outside of europe, but god damn if I can become fluent in English, then anyone can, and should. Not just for wow, but because its one of the most useful skills youll ever learn in your entire life
---
If only it was so easy. It really is much more complex than just joining language specific chat channels. Some people really don't seem to get this.
---
there was very little effort into layer hopping. I just whispered people in world chat to invite me to their party real quick which also changed the layer i was on.
---
That’s a misconception. We expect concurrent players to be around 90% lower on many servers about a month or so before phase 1 ends (content draught).
---
This is not just people quitting but a superposition of:
---
-	People quitting
---
-	People logging in at different times or days
---
-	People raidlogging
---
-	People taking a break
---
Those “6k pop servers” still have - say - 20k to 40k players that play every week. They are just not all online at the same time.
---
Proper OGs link spell IDs, it doesn't exist in the Vanilla client as far as I'm aware but you could get a spell ID for Swine Flu and put it into /me sneezes on @tar and gives you [Swine Flu] which is a clickable spell with flavour text. There are quite a few funny spell IDs in the game and it's worth looking them up!
---
Everyone in Europe speaks European. What’s the problem?
---
No, you have to exit the client completely, then log the other toon before the main. If you just login to the other toon, it will temporarily be on your mains layer instead.
---
It's something like Steve Jobs put it: this is a video game company, which used to be run by video game developers. Now it's being run by salespeople. 
---
They can't really gauge the long-term impact of their decisions on the playerbase, and their market analyses and feasibility studies don't help an ounce, because there's no metric for WoW being more addictive than crack cocaine in those studies.
---
As a corporation, they have to put up a front that they know what they're doing, they're solid and their helmsman will steer them into the right direction, towards greener pastures and higher revenue streams. 
---
They cannot be swayed by every whim of the community, but I also believe that regardless of their image in the industry, they look stupidly stubborn to their clients (players, not shareholders) right now.
---
You're likely to still have a problem. WoW is a CPU intensive game.
---
I have a 9700k and 2080ti and still get noticeable FPS drops at 1440p in big PVP battles and city shenanigans. Classic doesn't have BFA's multi-threading support, so any perceivable benefit by it requiring less resources (and really that's only required video ram) is lost.
---
I think I would rather deal with fear ward then the 2 minute fear trinket that undead get.
---
RP realms are where I play just to avoid people with dumb names.
---
That's a big no-no
---
Hopefully, being a friendly giant cow man who's reliable and helpful, and has good BS recipes.
---
I'm not for a pure no changes (like Blizzard), 15 years have passed, so I don't feel this at all.
---
Ah good to know. The problem with playing so long is that I know so much about the game, but it's hard to separate when features were added lol.
---
Perhaps it sold out? I hope not, I want one too.
---
Yep. That's really the only benefit.
---
Because not everyone speaks English. In Germany for example there is no reason at all to speak English at all except when you need it for work. All our movies and TV series are perfectly dubbed. We learn a little bit of English in school but for most people that's it. We also have older people who have grown up in former Eastern Germany and learned no English in school at all.

You opinion is worth nothing u fucking sperg.
---
So much for me being a BFA tool right? Big oof on that one.
---
Or it means you’ve launched numerous expansions and have refined and improved your process each time with strong data projections to plan accordingly.
---
Right but here's what you're not understanding. Not everyone knows that this is happening. So they join a server, get up to 50 and it turns out the server is 80% German.
---
Why not just fucking specify from the beginning?
---
My husband and I are coming back solely for Classic. I just could not play after the talents were fucked up. He stuck it out until Legion, I think. Either way, we downloaded a private Vanilla  server when we heard the news. I am happily back. Fuck I missed this and I am so hype.
---
I am crying.
---
My bad I must have misread! Your pace will be pretty decent, stay away from RP tbh unless you *want* to RP.

Yea that is kinda screwed haha

Maybe drop the rested part

Me too please! Thank you!

Riots? You and what army?
---
Only good think is i have to kill France Alliance Players while shouting out "Bratwurst"...
---
It was an easy way to gear up alts in pandaria.  That's about all I remember.  The only piece of gear from pandaria I can even remember though is the legendary cloak, everything else just felt like "generic upgrade #15153"
---
Didn't say they were.  
---
But English is about 60% french mixed with 30% germanic and 10% gaelic, then augmented by uncontrolled kleptomania for a few hundred years as it "borrowed" words from every other language.
---
The same thing that makes English hard for non-native speakers to learn makes germanic and romance languages easy for native English speakers to learn.
---
Unfortunately, most of us (native english speakers) don't bother to become fluent in any other language, we just get mad at others for not speaking ours.
---
A common complaint I've seen about no language based servers is smaller communities on each server. The flipside of this is that if you all speak English, your community grows quite a bit. 
---
&gt; dont non-english speakers deserve access
---
Do they? If I came to France, youd expect me to learn some French right? Should I demand France cater to me as an English speaker? Dont I deserve access?
---
THanks so much for this. I've been trying a druid on a private server and I can't get any macros to work and it's really turned me off the class because shifting out constantly is annoying. So glad to have a reference to try and see if it helps me enjoy the class more. 
---
I tried making my own macros on the server but i can't tell if my macros are wrong or the server doesn't calculate them the same way vanilla does. This is great info for me to dig into and figure things out. You're the best
---
Where did you read that they expect only 300’000 player at launch? With 4-5 millions people subscribed to retail and a free access to vanilla they obviously know that at launch there will be more during the first week
---
wow.... that completely defeats the purpose of "megaserver" that just makes it a bigger normal server you talking about aprivate server with 10k players vs retail like you talk about moronic shit like that and you spout stuff like that....
---
a megaserver is just "one server" that everyone is in
---
ESO is where the term came from and even in the name "mega"server

I don't think the crit dmg is worth in in classic. It's hard to get spell crit as a druid I think it's better to just go for spell dmg/sustain, somthing like https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#0tRx0MVsxZxecoco
---
Or https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#0poxhMVsLVMhoZVV0o
---
I know starfire is a risky cast cause it's so long but if the only thing you are reliably critting with is moonfire I dont think it's worth 100% crit dmg. Plus with natures grace proccing off moonfire consistently starfire can be a 2.5 sec cast with a 15% chance to stun
---
My bad I somehow read week-ends and not weekdays. I will go learn some reading now!
---
Well lucky you then, huh?
---
Exactly. Not everyone is a reddit user who knows what servers are doing what. It's a ridiculous expectation to have
---
Yeah, you're looking at about 6 months to hit 60 no matter what server you choose.
---
I have yet to see a limited time beta which results in actual big system changes to the game. For every beta I have seen so far, there has been one gorup of people calling out problems and one group saying "its only a beta thats the whole point" but most issues never actually get fixed until way after release if at all.  
---
Im usually not a pessimistic person but most of the times what you see during a beta is what you get.
---
Good that there are no English Realms but European.
---
The Realms are meant for the Europeans and English is not the only language there.

I live in Canada and I've been playing on european pservers for a while and it works well... idk what's the big issue here.
---
We are just very cautious with getting our hopes up.
---
Switzerland may have stayed neutral, but that didn't mean they kept their hands clean.  \*coughnazigoldcough\*
---
For those who aren't?
---
Would you mind sending me a macro that will both show charge and intercept cd timers while being able to switch stances and cast whichever one I need?
---
&gt; Polls with a decent sample size on here show the majority are long-lapsed former WoW players who do not currently play retail
---
Polls in a community specifically dedicated to Classic WoW... And the sample size isn't really significant compared to the amount of players who will be playing Classic WoW on release.
---
Some people on this subreddit have an extremely warped view of reality when it comes to WoW and the Classic community. Hardcore classic players, who played on private servers, or who played Vanilla originally will be a small percentage of people who try out Classic over the 1st month. 
---
You mention 120 million+ unique accounts, but the large majority of those accounts never played Vanilla. Most people who have ever played WoW, started playing it at some point after Wrath launch. They have no specific reason to be more interested in Classic than someone who currently plays WoW. A good portion of the people who played Vanilla are adults now who stopped playing WoW a long time ago and aren't ever coming back. 
---
Blizzard is doing the right thing, which is protecting servers against inevitable population decline. Regardless of how many players end up playing Classic, it's absolutely correct to assume that a large portion of those initial players won't be playing it long term.
---
I just said to fix the abuse of the gurubashi chest as it's the one that most people keeping showing can be abused.
---
Rogue, Priest, Warrior would all be pretty insane.  They all have big trade offs between their specs, and can utilize the same gear between specs for the most part.
---
So you're proving OPs point?
---
No one really cares about your class in 5/10 mans they just take the first healer they find. Except some people don't like druids due to the lack of combat res.
---
In raids it's about having good class balance. You won't get picked cause your healing class is better than another, you'll get picked because they already have 4 priests but only 3 paladins, or because your a druid which they don't have at all yet and they need druid buffs. No matter what healing class you play your not going to have much of a problem getting into raids.
---
But free food and drink
---
Just like azerite was fixed before BFA launched
---
Do we know there will be enough players for every language?
---
Why can’t the comments in this sub never end with the joke. There’s always gotta be that one guy.
---
I don't care whether or not I see other players in contexts where I'm not trying to do a group activity. I don't get this "it makes the world seem alive" sentiment.
---
Is this your argument for every aspect of any game or just the aspects you personally don’t care about?
---
They showed in the past to be willing and able to fix things even when only 1 guild was doing it.
---
There is difference between **splitting** huge servers, which is most likely what will end up happening in Classic because of layers, and **merging** young 1-2 month servers. A proper server merging, one they were definitely incapable and unprepared for in 2004/05 *is* actually a perfect  solution. A solution deemed undoable with ironclad reasoning of "but I might need to change my name".
---
A servers community with lifespan of 1-2 months is not going to be irreparably damaged by merging.
---
Locked due to multiple R2 violations.
---
Angwe 2.0,except I have a group of people dedicated to rushing to 60 and ganking ally lowbies as much as possible
---
So then you *did* say not to fix the other 500 ways. I don’t think you thought your suggestion entirely through.
---
Not sure the guy that didn't end up getting anything he demanded from his own family and was then murdered by his own son is the pillar you want to stand behind.
---
It’s not like that. We are realists. We know blizz isn’t going to give you what you want and we gave you an option to fix it. So to us you’re just complaining.
---
#show [combat] Intercept; [nocombat] Charge
---
#showtooltip [combat] Intercept; [nocombat] Charge
---
/cast [harm, nocombat, nostance:1] Battle Stance; [harm, nocombat, stance:1] Charge; [harm, combat, nostance:3] Berserker Stance; [harm, combat, stance:3] Intercept
---
That should do it. You can change the conditions for the tooltip and icon, if you want. You might only want to see the cooldown if you're in the correct stance (stance:1 or 3), or whatever else you can think of.
---
in the past... as if that's some metric.  Was it even 1 guild doing it?   I never heard about it ever happening.  Blizzard wouldn't even know if it was happening, unless it became widely used.
---
I remember my guilds first ZG. We purposefully rigged the groups and put our most geared raiders all in one. Turns out players who seem to be good during farm content can be awful at learning new things.
---
Yes my king Bobby B, Blizzard is a stupid name. But we need to convince them to change their plans.
---
You can't swap between servers. At some point 2 or even 3 of them might merge which would mean an influx of 'new' (for you unknown) players, but everyone from your server (that hasn't quit yet) is still there. So they would still know you.
---
TAKE ME TO YOUR CRYPT, I WANT TO PAY MY RESPECTS!
---
So how are the current EU servers set up? Are there French and Spanish servers? I honestly don't know, I'm asking.
---
Nope. That's the stress test that ends in a few hours.
---
So do I /join German or /join Deutsch ?
---
It’s essentially a questhelper addon that shows quest givers regardless of low level, the areas the quest is in, and the ?s on map when completed. It just doesn’t have the giant arrow on screen literally guiding you to the area.
---
No, it doesn't. I typically modify macros like this one based on what I'm doing. Like if I'm grinding elementals I'm not going to open with Garrote, I'm going to change the opener. If I'm grinding beasts I'm going to remove the PP part. Modifying macros slightly based on context is much better than building every context into the macro. If this macro is on "1" you can bet "shift-1" is for something more important than "same as 1 but for stuff I can't pickpocket."

hey, you US- alliance? I'm planning on rolling a mage or war tank and have a ton of experience in vanilla wow/private server. would love to find a serious 4/5 man for dungeon grinding (get your your ironfoe before 60 for example). EST us , taking a week or two off work for classic :)
---
All they need to do is make it so you can't swap layers till 20 minutes after gathering a resource or pvping. Might be annoying for people who want to group together but if you can't wait 20 minutes to group together then you really aren't apart of the classic crowd in a real sense anyways.
---
Ah i see, i won't bother subbing then, thanks!
---
and if they're tauren, /moo
---
Mad,
---
I'm literally asking for arena, with no rewards but just a ranked ladder on vanilla. It would cause no harm to anybody and bring the only form of meaningful PvP WoW has ever had to the game.
---
If that makes you so upset, you have issues.
---
What good does it do to have such small servers though? It's not an issue of making servers that's actually easy, the worry is having low pop servers
---
&gt; Most people in Europe have an English speaking proficiency that's more than enough to communicate with each other.  
---
Lol no.
---
&gt; Dude there’s not going to be an 100k server...nobody wants that at all why are you so stupid to think anyone realistically would want that? 5k+ on the other hand is certainly doable 
---
Okay so I'm confused now, why am I being called a moron when you  want a bigger server with \~5k players max on retail classic? you telling me 100k player aren't going to want to play classic? I'm a bit lost here?
---
Mages are great in later raids like AQ and Naxx since they can run fire spec which has some insane damage potential.
---
This is excellent for all the Chinese gold farmers. They will be able to occupy the best farming spot in 7 different layers. Haha. 7 times the gold, Blizzard will be furious.
---
It tells us they are going to to try and cover the launch with the least cost. Layering is their way of minimizing the amount of players in an area but also keeping a lot of players on one server.
---
Did they ever implement language servers on retail? I don't recall every hearing of it being a thing.
---
Been doing it on pservers for years. I only speak English and I’ve run with chinese and Russians. They don’t speak English half the time.
---
People have been moved to other layers for no apparent reason, so Blizzard is clearly capable of moving people between layers. What's to say that they can't move people in a specific zone to be on a single layer?
---
Because they have big brains that realized after seeing last 2 expansions alpha/betas that your feedback won't change what Blizzard planned from the start.
---
*They are trying to save you from exhausting yourself and falling into depression*.
---
Did you even read this? He’s not talking about the hassle of getting the buffs. He’s talking about it trivializing accomplishments and gear.
---
&gt; I don’t know of anyone outright saying that layers won’t impact the game.
---
Dude are you kidding me? The day it was announced this sub went full "IT"S FINE GUYS!!!"
---
Seriously, this sub went from "anyone who said the population would die in the first two months a hater" to "guys the population will die fast after 2 months, layering is necessary!!!"
---
it was literally hysterical watching this sub go full flip flop
---
People seem to overly estimate how much they interact with others in Classic WoW.
---
Pretty fair point, but I don't demand anything from my family. And he usually got what he wanted - except from his family.
---
He said he never expected them to gather them all at once and he said they didn't have any oversight, i.e they were too powerful, he didn't advocate removing them but he did say this is a question the devs need to think about because it will effect gameplay.
---
Well the French-German relationship went downhill since 843 a.d. i guess.
---
They also said it wouldn't be a thing at first.
---
Now we're here...
---
I'm sure most major guilds were doing it, it was quite common knowledge even back then.
---
That one boomkin who is really good at keeping people on his (improved!!) buffs.
---
My dps sucks, but my tanks do massive Thorns damage tho
---
Oh shit, that's why my post got deleted even though it got upvoted fairly quick for the time being posted.
---
It was the "let me in" - meme where let me in was written in German and the Gate was a French group. lol
---
Nah, im Belgian and we have 3 national languages. Everyone thinks we speak french, but we don't. My english is decent so I like to play on international servers with people from around the world:)
---
EU players pre launch - We want language separated servers or the game will be trash 
---
EU players post launch with language separated servers - The (insert language) server is dead, why is our server dead? The game is trash!
---
Nope this was an open beta for anyone with an active subscription.
---
I played a pve server before and I remember flagging myself and running into arcane explosions that flagged the mage so I could kill them. I do not know if classic will retain this feature since they are using legion client which does not have AoE flag pvp.
---
Why don’t people organize their fucking bags? Im surprised Bagnon isn’t a more popular addon by this point.
---
" Classic is about the journey, LFG SM FARM"
---
Even google translate the word for you.
---
Surely he means...
---
/join Français
---
/join Deutsch
---
/join Italiano
---
or would it be?
---
/Joindre Français
---
/Beitreten Deutsch
---
/Aderire Italiano
---
...Would joining French and Français end up in the same channel? 
---
Also if I typed /Aderire or /Join before Italiano would you end up in the same Italian channel or separate ones?
---
Seems kinda weird.
---
I'm also biased in that I really didn't get excited about classic until a few weeks ago, I had no real interest in playing it until then so if it isn't great I won't be all that upset, I'll just move on and do something else. I can understand people who have been crazy for it for years being a lot more anxious.
---
TLDR: I'm absolutely talking out of my ass
---
You genuinely didn't read my post. It's not about the annoying ways to collect world buffs it's about the way people as a whole will collect them and about how that reduces social interactions, and it's more about how that makes you care more about loot over social interactions with a 40 man group. Tons of people are already saying they're gonna be doing 30man runs of MC and what not to gear easier, quicker and more. 
---
Gear was not the be all of vanilla wow and every dev has stated that.
---
This wasn't supposed to really attack anyone or anything.
---
&gt; just like they don't on retail.
---
hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
you don't really need reddit to appeal to the majority for fake internet points and in-group belonging validation anymore, you have social media for that
---
Not that I’m an advocate for the shit spec that is feral - but it’s believed that pservers worked off level 60 data values and they guessed the rest. 
---
The level 58 Alterac Valley number crunching was coming in at 3% so they are guessing 60 would actually be within 1% or so. 
---
Just clearing that up. That’s not for SURE, but the rest of the math indicates it’s much closer at the top end than during the leveling process.
---
Because if it is per damage tick of the missiles. Going arcane would actually be viable i expect. As thats a 40% overall mana cost reduction.. which might make it near equal to fireball and frost bolt.
---
O o G A
---
But that's not a solution. It avoid the fact that people are going to make unofficial language servers. That's the real issue here. 
---
Somebody discussing something and arguing doesn't emediately qualify as complaining. If it did this entire subreddit would qualify and there would be no point for you to be here.
---
Twitch prime
---
I’ll be the one with the UBRS key
---
Im not sure any of us want to get philisophical here. You're missing the point, it's about simplifying your key binds, interface clutter, how far your fingers can reach on the keyboard, etc. Not all of us strive to make one button macros that play the game for us. As was noted, in classic there are just too many spells and abilities for certain classes because of the additional stance or form, as well as ranks of almost every spell/ability.

So you do the thing that you say is normal for everyone else. Now you sound just entitled.
---
that's racist
---
You need an active sub to play the game when it releases to, so it's exactly the same thing. It's open for wow subscribers lol you expect them to let random people who aren't subbing to play the beta? What does that accomplish? That's an unrealistic stress test.
---
where's your 900,000 followers?
---
I've hung up a map of azeroth with flight paths and area levels, and a t-shirt with my faction crest is on the way.
---
&gt; troll? Enjoy not getting into a raid ever
---
This one seems to be the most contradictory to me. Cause most "What race should I play" threads for Horde are like, "Berserking is a quintillion times better than any other racial. If your class can be Troll, you're a scrub for not picking it."
---
&gt;  Layering will allow Blizzard to focus the population on servers and merge them over time. This will avoid the very real problem that Vanilla had back in the day - dead servers.
---
This is the one I'm having trouble with. Just *how* are they going to merge layers, when layers by definition are in-realm instances of 3.5k people(Vanilla pop cap)? How does that make sense if you chose to play on Kazzak with all your friends, but ended up on different layers and then Blizzard... what? Either split them into coherent 3.5k individual realms, or merge them into clusterfucks of 15k people per realm.
---
Yeah Brexit is a lot worse than two World Wars

I thought for sure that classic was running on a modified Legion client, but the multi-threading support came around in the BFA client.
---
I may be way off base here though.
---
Actually never did..

 Danke für den Rat, Genie.

Uhhhh Bc there’s going to be many servers available with 8k maxes or whatever the desired number is. Ur a moron for thinking an 100k populated server is something reasonable people are asking for.

---
I think you're missing the point. The issue here is that non-English speaking players of the same language, e.g. Italian, will congregate on one server, making English a minority language, which makes it almost impossible to play as an English speaking, but non-Italian speaking person. This happened in vanilla, as I say Hakkar EU was fully Italian, you could not find guilds or groups that spoke English it was horrible.
---
I'm not too worried about it. Mostlly because of the spec thing. I'm going Enhancement shaman which will be very popular at low levels, but after 40 many people will likely respec to ele/resto or straight resto.  Plus its hard to say if people will stick with their class. You always hear about how many rogues there will be, but I bet a good number of people will be turned off by how slow and difficult rogue leveling will be and switch to something else by level 30.

and it's the most ridiculous excuse.

They're internet janitors and they just want to show they have power because, again, they're pathetic internet janitors
---
I didn't say they shouldn't fix it. I just didn't mention that. I find the gurubashi abusing the most devastating factor. You do know just because I don't say X doesn't mean that I support Y
---
What, you mean the stress test? I don't remember any open beta bsides the stress test, which was filled to the brim and barely anyone reached level 10 due to there being no (quest)mobs to kill...
---
Kinda feel like playing a mage but it seems to be the most popular class and I hate playing what everyone else plays..
---
you're right, move to wasn't in vanilla, just stay
---
but streamer man bad
---
Not nearly a bad...
---
why are you so sure.
---
It was hard, but nothing compared to mythic raiding in retail. What I mean is, say the fire on the floor kills you in one hit. usually that fire on the floor is the only thing you need to be looking out for. Where in retail you need to be tracking 20 mechanics simultaneously. The hardest part of the gameplay by far was coordinating 40 living breathing humans to work together effectively. That means before you pull cthun running 20 practice pulls in the basement below so you know that everyone knows where to stand.
---
Do you have a source with developers saying it will last a couple weeks?
---
The fact there aren't different language servers for EU realms paings a pretty good picture of how much faith they have in Classic
---
Layering is antithetical to the game, Ion said it himself. They need to find another solution.
---
Found the dutch person
---
i'm sure you'll figure it out :))
---
Yes, I read it. And he still doesn't get to dictate that to other players. If you want to raid without them to make the raid harder, that's your prerogative. If you want to raid with meme specs to make the raid harder, that's your prerogative. If you want every perceivable advantage in a raid for world firsts or speedrunning or for any other reason, that's your prerogative. 
---
Constantly comparing yourself to the players around you is how we got to Retail in the first place. 
---
"I want the same purples they get! Waaaaaaaah."
---
"I want to do the same content they do! Waaaaaah."
---
"I don't have time to play but still want to be competitive in every way! Waaaaaah."
---
That's not the Vanilla way.
---
&gt; Uhhhh Bc there’s going to be many servers available with 8k maxes or whatever the desired number is 
---
But that's not a mega server?
---
&gt; Ur a moron for thinking an 100k populated server is something reasonable people are asking for. 
---
That's exactly what people are asking for in the way they write their sentences?
---
If I say I want a megachocolate and you bring me 5 a little bit bigger than usual chocolates that's not what I asked for.
---
&gt; Secondly, a lot of these people probably substitute actual social interactions with watching streamers.
---
the fact that you made this statement while on a classic WoW subreddit without a shred of irony is *staggering*
---
A TBC version would be nice imo
---
Each dungeon has a list, that you can put your name and class on, but make it so you can’t just invite from the list, you can only whisper the players on the list, to make it more personal. Putting your name on the list would pretty much be like saying “LFG DM Mage”, just you don’t have to keep saying it
---
China is a joke, a house of cards built with Chinese engineering
---
That's still a server merge
---
And children like you are why twitch chat is full of retarded pog spam.
---
I plan on joining/running a troll guild (not the race).  Goal is to do all the shenanigans of old (pulling bosses into friendly cities, raiding enemy cities, shutting down flightpaths, ambushing raid entrances, etc.), but also find new and innovative ways to annoy, inconvenience, and otherwise troll the server.  
---
In order to do this though, you need a good core of raiders to get good gear and also be good at world PVP.   It's going to be a hodgepodge of great players that don't care to min/max because that's just boring.  It will also be easy for casuals to be in the guild too because you always need warm bodies for these kinds of things.
---
The real challenges are the ones you set yourself.
---
Ur opinion is not worth more because you have wow accomplishments. Funny how deluded ur brain is from playing wow that hard to thinking it has earned you some sort of superiority over others

How will people know you if youre in a dungeon all The time? 🤔
---
don’t worry, I’m pretty sure all of Europe share their hate for the US
---
Thanks man. Have a good weekend!
---
I want to go back, but without friends to play with I fear I'll be left empty and sad. Back in the day me and my buddies all played together.
---
people are thirsty for a sense of community that has been slowly eroding from WoW since WotLK began the trend of turning everything into a queue. streamers are just lightning rods for that sense of community.
---
Can all the peoples who do this, notify us.
---
Dutch people have bad memories about being surrounded by german people.
---
Proving the point about mods being americans.
---
I really don't get them not wanting to split.
---
If a country's server fails, just merge it into another low-pop server. 
---
They're setting themselves up for European failure for no good reason at all.
---
This sub alone is proof there will be well over 10K people from Germany and France respectively, and probably Italy as well.
---
Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if the problem is the leadership.  
---
A German server will require German support staff, and Blizzard's brass probably don't want to invest in non-English classic support staff.
---
Dude, troll meta.  Undead is a shitty bait late game - a fire mage has 41 yard range and there's no fear in the game that's close to you at that distance.  Even at full hp the cast speed is so powerful late game when ever spell packs massive scaled up power.
---
Holy crap. I forgot about the peggle and bejeweled addons haha. Also there was an mp3 addon so I didn't have to tab out for music. Good analogy. Twitch is exactly that. I also watch it as a medium-aged adult who played vanilla in high school.

After the upload is finished you should see a summary how much characters you have inserted into the database
---
30 man naxx? I don't know if that's ever been done. Also, world buffs help without a doubt, but I think it's a stretch to say that non-trival content becomes trivial with buffs. Good guilds cleared all content on private severs when world buffs were disabled with new content. And some guilds who couldn't clear were able to get over the hump with the help of the buffs. That sounds exactly like what they were intended for.
---
Personally what I enjoy most about vanilla is the game being loot centric. I put in effort and do my homework, I get a reward.
---
LOL thats so good, cant wait to flex mine.
---
My issue isn't with you asking for arena, my issue is with you thinking you're hot shit because you have some Silly neckbeard "achievements" and that that makes your opinion somehow more valid then others. Spoiler: it isn't. You act like a complete spastic and still think anyone should listen to your nonsense rambling. Also if you like Arena that much go play retail. You seem to like it anyway with all your top 200 raiding supersperg bullshit.
---
It only affects gameplay for the people that choose to use the buffs. Your gameplay remains unchanged. Stop thinking Classic is about an even playing field. It's not. That's Retail.
---
that is irrelevant if the game already has layering and blizzard intends to use it at launch. basically he is saying dont like whats gonna be there, dont play. no one here is promoting layering and/or saying they wont play without it
---
He just threw the whole pole in the water.
---
I need you on my realm
---
What blizzard should do is add googles automatic translation feature to the chat and things will go swimmingly.
---
Ripping it out of current wow and making work in the new engine isn't a small task. Sure, it's smaller than developing new content, but it's not like it's free to have developers and engineers do these things.
---
Being a good prot warrior.
---
HUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUE
---
I would never want to fight a warlock or pally like that.
---
They're intentionally underestimating.
---
Having to merge servers would be bad press.
---
Cross realm play would be a death knell.
---
I'm not sure Activision's stock price would withstand another high profile failure, and ultimately, that's what they care about.
---
Yes we are entitled to our language. Maybe you are not.
---
But as a frenchman, should I remind you that there are way more people natively speaking french than english ?
---
Why should we be forced to speak another language, especially in a game ?
---
Now this is an unpopular opinion
---
&gt; I may last until the end of Phase 2
---
until the START of Phase 2.
---
Phase 2 is when the world bosses start to appear, they don't want layers to affect that
---
It's only required for the first week, after that no need for it at fucking all.
---
I loved playing with people from all around the world on Nostalrius. It also meant there were always players running around no matter what time of day. That's one thing I'll miss about private servers. I made a lot of European friends and I'll miss being able to play with people outside my region. I even helped a Chinese player questing in Un'Goro before and we exchanged emotes.
---
I think you (and Blizzard) truly underestimate the number of EU players.
---
It's just a ploy. Ze Germans are going to take over the unoffical French server so they can have Alsace-Lorraine back.
---
How do they hold up in later raids? Fire mages will have the highest dps in both AQ and naxx.
---
They will be weaker in MC and BWL because they have to spec frost which has weaker dps
---
Was the Move To command in the game in Vanilla? It's been so long since they revamped the pet commands that I can't even remember what it was like. I do miss being able to set my pet on Aggressive stance back when it existed.
---
People need to chill, I guarantee they’ll only allow layering to be a thing for the starter zones.
---
It's the current stress test for the US region. It's currently open to everyone, but requires an active sub to be able to connect and play. It is set to end sometime today.
---
This. Private servers got so much about early levels wrong (especially in comparison to what we've seen of Classic), such as Feral's damage scaling, the scaling on Demon Skin/Armor, grey loot, etc.
---
Friday Night Drunk Molten Cores and Saturday Morning Hangover ZGs.

You don't need to live paycheck to paycheck to have concern about having a job lined up ... It doesn't matter how much you save.  It will run out and you will be boned unless you have a reliable way to find work quickly.  Unless health is an issue, nobody should voluntarily leave a job without some inkling of a replacement employer.
---
It makes no difference if there are 100 or 10 realms, all of it will be virtualized anyways so the costs are dependent on the amount of people (stress on the servers) and not the amount of servers.
---
And yes, there have been separate language realms on retail since vanilla ... at least for the major ones, like German and French. Italian came later as well, dunno about Spanish
---
World pvp and bgs are different. You can get away with a raid spec in world pvp but u can’t get away with raid spec in bgs. You don’t want to pay the respec fee.. Therefore you’re probably going to run raid talents if u want to raid to gear up.

Generic question about mouseover macros that others here might be able to answer - do you find that you accidentally fire off abilities more often due to having them? i've never put much consideration into where my mouse cursor is while i'm doing things that require me to be using spells. is it a matter of just making sure you don't have any open-ended mouseover macros, and always make sure you're using modifiers? or is it just another learning curve that's going to happen, but happens less frequently as you get used to it?
---
yeah all the kids with soda pooping and asmongoloid jokes ...
---
i can only hope that they'll realize you actually have to work for shit in classic and can't be a constant asshole downer shitting on things people like constantly and go back to World of Queues
---
They do, but the chat is a shit show. It sucks.
---
My roommate played a lot of classic rock when we played, so I always get that nostalgic feeling when some Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, or Judas Priest comes on.
---
Except this effects the entire end game scene as a whole, the same way casual players suggesting bad game play or designs effects the game. Just because someone plays a certain way doesn't mean it has no side effects to the game.
---
swap the words for layering and sharding.
---
well disuguised post, gamer
---
It makes the option to go to US servers a real consideration, personally. But apparently Blizzard believes Classic will sustain like 5 players, so maybe there will be 2 servers at most, full of streamers.
---
people always have something to complain about
---
Yeah, spamming their twitch is obviously stupid.  You need to be part of a storyline.  Be a ganker who always manages to find them, be a super sick player that they group with, say or do enough whacky dumb shit so that they want to keep you around for stream value.
---
i get 90 ms from NA to EU servers ..thats great
---
you must be fun at parties
---
One guy said if ur gonna do sharding you might as well do a 100k megaserver. He basically meant to say, both approaches are terrible for classic, if you couldn’t catch that....on the other hand what people actually want is what I’ve stated. However, it’s hard to argue with someone who believes classes should be pigeon holed into only having abilities for their spec. I’ve read some moronic things from you and it all makes sense.
---
ill use bagon on release i just dont feel like using it on a stress test
---
Bobby B here? MADNESS
---
I feel like if you're in a serious raiding guild you will probably get the world buffs with your guild mates before raid while you're all in discord talking and having a good time. 
---
I dont care what negativity people post on this sub, what problems people think will be in the game, I am going to enjoy the fuck out of classic and make a lot of friends along the way.

I'm going to main a mage on release and I plan on using my professions to min/max for pvp (engineering/blacksmithing). I'm also going to make an alt that is only for gathering to increase my gold making potential.
---
I'm trying to decide whether I should make another mage alt with herbalism/skinning to grind DM:E or if I should make a hunter with herbalism/mining to double gather in the open world and in instances instead.
---
Is having gathering professions on an alt mage with blue gear more lucrative than having a highly geared mage that can put out more dps? Would it make more sense to make a hunter alt for gathering with eagle eye and just aoe grind with a highly geared mage instead?
---

you're so butthurt over streamers for some reason that you're missing the point that it had more to do with a largescale WPvP event than any individual streamer. this is exactly what people want from classic. people creating organic events instead of sitting in queues all day.
---
The difference is this, a decision has been made to include layering in this game.

No amount of whining will change it, so why keep whining about it. Especially when it will have a net positive effect on the product.

What could go right?
---
I don't see why it should be on retail. If you could sheep heal the devilsaur thats obnoxious. That being said pvp is pvp. Don't like it get more friends and battle it out.
---
Close but not enough "I hate streamers" material. It should be half of the image.
---
Once realm lists are announced im fairly sure we will know what realm the big streamers will be on and then you can just choose a different realm
---
Only streamer I would even considering playing on the same server with is Madseason. Dude actually seems appreciative of his fans and can't imagine him using his pull to get himself ahead.
---
True.  Gotta find out beforehand where all the major english speaking clans will go.
---
A few people saying they will be undermanning content for gear isn’t reflective of the whole of the population. Many that will utilize world buffs aren’t stuck on the idea of “gimme loot as quick as possible”. Those two ideologies aren’t necessarily inclusive, and assuming such is silly.
---
Example being /u/UbiGeoFram’s guild. In other threads, it’s clear they are racing for world first on Rag (and presumably all other content, once its released). They aren’t doing that for loot, they are doing it for the challenge and prestige.
---
When it comes to their utilization of world buffs, it’s about efficiency and/or just the enjoyment of shitting on content. Crushing content feels good. One shotting a whole raid feels good, it shows you and your team know wtf y’all are doing. Being able to get farm content out of the way to enjoy other things also feels good. Maybe they want to go pvp, but need their weekly raid done. So they stack world buffs on their mains, crush raid, go pvp/farm on alts or play other games together.
---
I don’t understand how you think world buffs somehow hurts the socialization of a guild. Just because they may log their main out to preserve their buffs for the raid week doesn’t mean they never log on again or speak to each other. I’m sure they have alts to play on, or other games they play together.
---
So much about the negatives of world buffs is based on presumption, and it’s people talking out of their asses. It’s just gotten silly.
---
The mods are pussies
---
Then I'm not seeing the issue
---
Sometimes layering can and will shift you to another layer without precedent (i.e., no group invite). I randomly shifted into a new layer during the stress test (everyone around me disappeared and there were suddenly mobs there).
---
&gt;What if they'r actually right but the servers are even more dead after 3 months?
---
If they are right and don't layer, then merge servers.
---
If they are wrong and layering is in the game, congratulations, Classic now has layering in it for god knows how long.
---
The only stream moment I want to see is Assmanbald eating his gun.
---
I think that is the biggest part of the equasion the spam bots here on classic wow don't take into account.  Player drop off after day 1 is going to be gigantic.  The number of consistant players per realm will be a fraction of what the prime time week 1 numbers will be.
---
Baguette is the preffered nomenclature nowadays.
---
As someone who raided extensively on a private serve I won’t miss them. 
---
It was a pain in the ass coordinating when to be in SW then fly to westfall and then zandalar, portal to Darnassus then felwood to try and get a songflower, then hearth to Cenarion Hold for AQ40.
---
You ended up spending 20 minutes getting world buffs that half of the raid loses by the 2nd or 3rd boss
---
Nothing. I'm going to play tauren enhance shaman because Chad Casual is the optimal way to play
---
It wasn't and the weren't.  People probably wouldn't have done it, even if they knew.   People back then cared about how they won just as much as winning.
---
World buffs make content so much easier that you can take less people down to 30 for naxx and much lower for MC and BWL. We can have a discussion about what kind of raiding is better, but vanilla wow was 40 man raids and 20 man raids that were designed and tuned for those kinds of groups without the world buffs. (Kevin Jordan himself stated the amount they gave was too much on his stream in June 18th and stated they were definitely designed to be used but they didn't expect people to use them all together to make the content trivial. He said they were designed to help people who couldn't kill the content get an extra push to kill content, while that may have been how they were used in vanilla wow that's not how they are used now.
---
Things like project ascension arent English realms.... yet I never see non English languages being used in the chat despite the many people playing it that dont use english as their mother tongue.
---
I'll be very surprised if you dont still see english being almost exclusively used simply because it's the most common language shared by all the players (as in people knowing it as a 2nd language reasonably well)
---
If you're leveling professions, doing BGs, and fishing while leveling its going to take forever.  Not saying you can't, or you shouldn't, but if your goal is to level as fast as you can, don't touch any of those things. Skip BGs, don't bother with professions, don't even think about fishing, and unless you have a solid group you trust to not wipe, skip instances as well, I'd avoid pugs like the plague while leveling if I'm focusing on speed.
---
Brazil speaks Portuguese. and they have a larger population then Germany + France combined
---
&gt;Actual reason is Russians are the most massive player base in EU (and I'm talking not only about Russia citizens but also Kazakhs, Turkmens, Uzbeks, Kirgizs, Ukrains, Belaruses, Latvias, Litvas, Polskas and other Russian-speaking countries). There are enough players for few servers, unlike portugal, england and other small EU countries.
---
Dude, if you're this ignorant you should be shutting the fuck up. This is so ridiculously wrong.
---
I bet you got a dirty bellybutton bro.
---
I look forward to all the puns as nations pick their favorite realm name.
---
Can you show me where they said that? I don't remember them saying they would never do it, I only remember them being a bit vague about the initial use of it.
---
Surely there will be supermacro or some equivalent in classic I’d hope
---
PRIVATESERVER PLAYERS ARE NOT THE SAME CROWD AS THE 45 YO BLIZZARD FANBOI BOOMER THAT MAKE 85% OF THE COMMUNITY. 
---
holy fuck everytime the same argument. Why do people simply not understand that people who post in the official forums are not the same people that post on reddit and/or play on private servers.
---
Bookmarked so I can try and figure macros out when Classic rolls around! Too cool, thank you!!
---
Exactly, but there are players out there that consider 4 different difficulties of a single raid tier as "new content," when it's really not. It's the same raid with the same gear, just higher ilvl. It somewhat destroys the value of the "bis" items. 
---
The Devs undoubtedly believe they're retaining players by making the game appealing to every type of gamer out there, but they don't realize that they've alienated tons of loyal players in the process. They don't even know who their target audience is at this point.
---
Posts about posts aren’t much better.
---
*¿Donde esta la bibliotecha?*
---
The only way it affects YOUR gameplay is if you compare yourself to others. Player equality was not at all a design philosophy of Vanilla.
---
What do you expect, bunch of reddit trolls who haven't played the beta are salty for not getting an invite, so that means that the game is doomed yet 90% of them can't properly explain what Layering is.
---
Just speak American???
---
I bet I have a bathtub. xD
---
&gt; If you don't want to go through the trouble of exploiting the game, then don't join a guild that requires you to exploit the game.
---
ftfy
---
&gt; Layering will not go away.
---
Except when they disable it after the initial launch rush.
---
I agree, but I want national servers so that I (english speaker) can avoid them! not the other way around
---
So fragile, this isn't your safe space
---
Loot boxes do not have to be monitized to be loot boxes. 
---
The loot in wow has been increasingly randomized to try and extend content and keep people in less optimized gear longer. Care to guess why this was done? If you guessed to keep people subbed longer so they get more money out of people, you would be correct.
---
4 days 20 hours was the fastest time in Vanilla.  I don't care about pserver records, because those aren't Vanilla.
---
*Can* be done by speed runners who know the game and quests inside and out are not the same thing as the average player.  I consider myself halfway decent at leveling, and its still probably going to take me 6-8 days /played, and due to my work schedule, probably a month or more real time.

---
I think they'd be the weakest.  Particular playstyles don't get much from the other trees.  Meanwhile a rogue who takes all 3 just does triple damage and has triple utility, pretty much.
---
7 layers? That means that that individual server would have 21,000 people allowed on it. There's no way they'll let a server get to 7 layers.
---
Obviously you've never experienced a Blizzard beta if you expect anything to get done and through to them without mass disdain. Blizzard probably has more doom and gloom in their eyes than anyone considering they think Classic will be a fotm experience that everyone eventually just quits. So much so they aren't even willing to make enough servers for EU to speak with themselves without segregating on their unofficial servers.
---
My biggest issue with Layering is that I think Blizzard won't be able to properly manage the populations after a couple weeks because there are more people than they expected.
---
It was done 4h 20m back during vanilla. You’re all terrible.
---
You certainly are French
---
I'm as excited as the next guy for Classic but I really think you need to taper your expecations.  Its a great game and all, but its not gonna draw in your average gamer like it did when it was new.  I'm expecting to be really great for people that liked it back in the day, but I doubt its going to draw many NEW gamers in and most of the people that still play retail, for better or worse, probably don't mind it so much.
---
This happened to me in the beta, too. I was not grouped but shifted into another layer randomly. It wasn't advertised to work that way (it was talked about more like new layers were added as people logged in and the newly logged in people ended up on a new layer if over the previous layer's cap) but it seems it is.

sure is better than grown adults crying about streamer culture and sounding more immature in their attempt to criticize just that
---
A merged server I used to play on was half English speaking and half Portuguese, and there was sometimes a little war going on with the English speakers vs Portuguese. Trade chat would be "Speak English! Tugas out!" "Learn Portuguese, PORTUGAL CARALHO!" Nobody was seriously hating on the other, it was just banter.

its the natural evolution of the sub

---
no changes
---
Blizzard is the only one that gets to call something an exploit and they deemed World Buffs to not be an exploit in any of the content they were available in.
---
I assume that because people didn't just stop using world buffs after the race was done. Lol. They kept using them to make the content more reliably easy to get more gear to do higher numbers. I don't see how this concept is even deniable.
---
You’re garbage. I did it way under that 14 years ago. JFC get a brain.
---
I will be healer who is always down to heal whatever you're running.

Everyone knows good healers are hard to come by :)

It's got a jumping puzzle! And a couple sweet drops, and the sword quest reward for that weird pearl quest item you bring back to the beach. I love that place.
---
In 99% of games and cases - I’d say you’re right - but I always feel it’s important to give feedback. Regardless of how retarded it might actually be (lol blizz let us keep our stress test characters) - especially in a game where decisions can be changed via patches. 
---
Being dismissive to others opinions and telling everyone else to just shut up because you don’t think something can change (it very much can) - makes you sound like an asshole.
---
This sounds really fun!
---
Most likely nothing. I'm not a stand out in a social environment. My guild only invited me due to being reliable back in TBC after I did a few PUGs with them and they recognized my name.
---
&gt;those react videos have taken over every youtube recommendation since I watched one like two months ago.
---
God tell me about it. Worst click of the month, and I didn't even give it a thumbs up.
---
can afford $15/m, can't afford a spare $30 for a transfer... k? maybe at this point you need to reprioritize your life and stop playing video games lmao

Wasn't this how it was in vanilla? That worked just fine.

I feel you. Haha

Server merging isn't perfect but it's a one-time event that may or may not even happen.  IMO not nearly as bad as this layering crap which directly and always effects the game.
---

I just watched guilds in aq gear kill skeram so fast his clones were despawning from him being pushed into his next percents so quickly. Fight took less than 2 minutes.
---
&gt; It only affects gameplay for the people that choose to use the buffs. 
---
What a shit argument.   It's a fucking exploit.  By that logic, paladins should still be allowed to 1 shot bosses.
---
Some paladins choose to 1 shot bosses solo.  Stop thinking Classic is about an even playing field. It's not. That's Retail.
---
Wow BFD... Completely forgot about that dungeon. I think I ran it twice in total, it was just so far away as Horde.
---
forgive the fortnite comparison, but kind of how fortnite causes groups including a PC player to play on the PC servers (instead of console or mobile)
---
Inc downvotes but blizz getting involved in how the community acts is why modern wow is bad. it's a slippery slope and we have seen that
---
I noticed this too, it's mainly the US and Scandinavian countries that are the most prominent English speakers in MMOs. MMO gamers in the UK are rather niche comparitively and are actually not the best competitive players, but they over-represent in commentator / content creation.
---
Our 29 pvp guild name was True Twinks before I knew what twink really meant.  Lol
---
It's not. It's just a different name for it basically. There's small differences, but all the ways to exploit it are the same. 
---
Was so frustrated when this sub gladly defended it after it was announced, glad to see these posts get to the front page but sadly it's too late now
---
Thanks, bot.
---
Two different places.
---
They should just put a debuff on you when you loot the chest that prevents you from looting it for 3 hours. BAM. fixed.
---
blizz does not need to moderate this
---
As if the regular player won’t do this as well? If people want to avoid conflict and have an easy way to. They will. It goes the same for questing or farming mobs. Occupied? Layer hop.
---

---
no we are on to bitching about layering and languages 
---
you missed the boat on world buffs
---
You got my hope up and dashed them instantly once I saw "(not the race)"
---
Good luck in your endeavor thou, sounds interesting and should add some flavor to your server if it all works out.
---
On my rogue I spammed dungeons and got my shadowcraft set and then did the dark mantle upgrade. I followed that by pvping... but i was in a group. Everyone was around rank 10 when I joined the guild I was in, i had no issues. But again i was in a guild.. if you can get in a group you will be okay. I played with that guild all the way to rank 13. I remember having the champions set (rank 10) and it was still plenty enough for engaging in pvp around the world and stuff. I would not stress much. Do dungeons and get the best gear you can then try and join an organized pvp group..getting to rank 10 for the pvp set I don’t believe was very hard at all. And that will put you above a lot of player base who aren’t raiding,
---
I'mma play no matter what, but beta is what you gonna get unless it crashes the game.  They never ever make any major changes after the beta is out.  It is what it is going to be, minus all the bugs they have time and knowledge to fix between now and launch.
---
I found it was a learning curve. Once I no longer needed to click my abilities, my cursor wasn't doing much. Even selecting targets was done mostly with tab. It becomes useful again, you'll pay attention to where your cursor is, and begin to anticipate where it needs to be (tab target a guy and leave your cursor by a doorway in WSG in case someone else comes, for instance).
---
It's less likely that you'll accidentally cast something at the wrong target, and more likely you'll just miss opportunities to make use of it. You'll feel really cool after you successfully throw out heals in between DPSing a target, and you'll begin to look for more opportunities.
---
I think people are concerned because layering fundamentally goes against what Classic is about. Yes the Classic team has overall been good, they have listened to feedback and changed what the community has wanted. 
---
That being said the big issue with layering and the language barriers is that the change that people want costs Blizzard more money whereas those other changes do not. Its quite clear Blizzard doesn't want to spend a lot of money on servers. 
---
I'm still excited, but if Classic launches with layering as it is now and it is not gone by the second week I think the game could be in serious trouble.
---
You seem to not have been paying attention to the thread so far.
---
*Why do you have to waste tokens/money now to beta test things?*
---
WOW Classic is going to have to overcome layering and streamer worship, but it really has potential to still be the best gaming experience ever.
---
I'm pretty sure complaining about a game you haven't played and design choices you don't fully understand also makes you sound like an asshole.
---
The alliance see that as "O O G A". It's a saying that a bunch of troll rogues would spam when they would stream snipe popular streamers. It's kind of a meme at this point I guess but that kinda ruined it imo
---
The videos of layering you see are likely on beta. Last wednesday orcsay layering was flipped into megahyper aggressive mode. I think it's 10-15 player layers. 
---
This is almost certainly to maximize the amount of layer changes that happen tobmaximize data. I highly doubt it'll be like that live.
---
A lot of groups start with a tank or healer already, or even both.  Even then, I've found more groups "LF DPS (Mage Pref)" or actively whispering mages, than I have seen groups looking for a tank or healer.  There's also the fact that healers could be one of 3 classes (per faction) and tanks one of two, but there's only one mage.
---
I don't have much time to dedicate to the game like I used to.  I know money will be an issue, and the idea of the old school respec costs are weighing on my soul.
---
Would mage be a class where I could potentially raid with my PvP build? From what I understand, at least for early raids, most mages go deep arcane/frost.  Except for one mage who goes all the way down and gets 5/5 winters chill.  Could I be the "winters chill" mage of my guild, and effectively NOT have to respec to PvP?  I think the only talent I might wind up getting that's not raid useful is imp CS, which I don't think will have too much effect on my DPS as the talent choices otherwise aren't that amazing.
---
The problem is I'm really entitled. I played WoW on german for more than a decade and I want to keep doing so. If I had started on an english server for example this wouldn't be a problem for me. I play other games on international servers from the start and that's completely fine for me because I only know it that way.
---
Blizzard devs said they intended for World Buffs to be stackable.
---
Blizzard devs said they never intended Paladins to be able to one-shot bosses.
---
Get over it.
---
They are implementing layering to separate the languages.  All Spinach speaking people on one layer, all Vodka speaking on another, etc.....
---
I'm pretty sure I remember it in vanilla on my Warlock, but it was definitely in by BC.
---
i hope this is an ironic comment.
---
Like I said, I purposely did most dungeons to see if they are worth doing. I afk'd a good amount, helped my friends with low level stuff when I could have been grinding.
---
I also didn't factor in gear and that's a mistake on my part.
---
leeway is not new though.  It was in vanilla and warriors still get shit on by mages.
---
The fact is, even if they have it for a few weeks, that's still weeks worth of this utter trash in the most important, exciting time of the game.
---
Once again Blizzard is showing their complete stupidity by thinking they know what's best for players and that QoL &gt; immersion and difficulty.
---
If you want to raid, go alliance. 
---
It’s no secret that a paladin being able to buff you with all possible paladin buff, healing and dispelling kings, made alliance go further in the raiding scene.
---
I have never ever read or heard that someone is looking for VC tho. Must be a Server related Thing mabye?
---
They did not enjoy it 15 years ago and won't enjoy it now?
---
Then maybe this game isn't for them. There's a whole other retail version of the game for people who want quality of life changes.
---
Can't you people just let us have our God damn game that we fought for for a decade? We don't want layering or sharding bullshit that ruins the classic experience and cuts up the visible community.
---
Nice repost
---
I clearly put "can't" into quotation marks. I mean, that was the entire point of it. Layering is already criticized, unlimited world bosses would completely destroy any integrity left.
---
There is only one solution:
---
Bring back the Goldshire Retriever posts
---
seeing this list, i dont think it'll be hard to avoid the streamer servers. Since monst of them will be on one or two
---
Thank god you're not in charge. No sane person would wait 10 hours to play a game to avoid an issue so small that 99% of the playerbase won't even notice.
---
I want to see all the private server world chatters try their bullshit in classic
---
I just don't understand why it's a problem in wow. No other game I played saw it like life and death.
---
Tibia has no language based servers. There is groups of all countries everywhere.
---
I'd rather argue about things that actually matter to the game in a long term manner, call me a gaylord if you must.
---
so nostalgia for you is back when servers didn't have curated languages and you're mad because it's going to be that way again? am I missing something?
---
Warrior should always lose to mage.  You are rock, he is paper.  If the warrior wins, he's either just a much better player, or if we assume even skill, then the mage would have to massively misplay.
---
I’ve played this game. In vanilla and on private servers. I’ve played in retail with sharding. I understand enough to see how it all works. I understand their design choices because they’ve explicitly stated why they are making these choices. Doesn’t mean I agree with them.  
---
Regardless of all that, by your line of thinking no one on this subreddit talk about anything yeah?
---
I forgot all about the anal thing.
---
I'd rather have that than layering. There's plenty of ways to level in this game, you don't have to be in the most populated area
---
I think the cutoff at level 20 is perfect, because once you hit 20 you can just dungeon run if you don't want to level in busy areas
---
The only time I ever let class population choose my class was in classic.  I started raiding as a DPS warrior and I couldn't get any gear because we had 12-20 warriors every fucking raid.  We were short on hunters and our hunters were awful, so i leveled a hunter.  Gearing was a breeze and it turned out I enjoyed the hunter more than the warrior.
---
You failed to understand what I wrote.
---
So youve played this iteration in 2019 or no?
---
I am I don’t know you and I’ve played for 12 years
---
&gt;Example being /u/UbiGeoFram’s guild. In other threads, it’s clear they are racing for world first on Rag (and presumably all other content, once its released). They aren’t doing that for loot, they are doing it for the challenge and prestige.
---
Which they will get by using a cheat.  So much prestige...
---
Why would I call you that? Lol are you a member of the nobility that's also homosexual?
---
This is somewhat skewed because you won’t know how much honor people are getting until end game. I would assume you are correct though. A large number of hours for sure. I was 20% away from rank 14 before I prematurely quit based on false info on pre expansion launch. I played about 10 hours a day on weekdays because I had school and all day basically on weekends... yeah you have to have no life outside of the game  to get rank 13+. I feel the amount of people wanting to do pvp is probably increased also. So you’re probably right. I’m ranting . Nvm
---
\*fewer
---
So who is going to come up with the addon to switch layers?  Kinda like Cross-Realm Assist or Cross-Layer Assist?
---
Mine is my original bnet account.
---
This is what I was thinking.  Fresh server environment leads me to believe all those juicy mob packs would be getting fought over.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/440538861?t=0h21m12s
---
&gt; Were world buffs designed to be used all at once?
---
&gt; Yes
---
Get fucked.
---
That's not it, either. I'm saying the class doesn't have special mechanics that require addons.
---
This phrasing seems pretty extreme. It's not like languages are banned.
---
The guy chimes in on political arguments with some random cat facts
---
I mean I left my name out on purpose, so I would assume nobody knows me...because of that pretty important piece of info.
---
so, when the team at activision-blizzard gives into your demand for a french server, and you have less than 1,000 per monthly logging for classic, are you going to come on here and complain that they need to do something because your realm is a ghost town? or are you going to come on here and say how great it is that you got a specific language server and got to experience wow until it became a ghost town?
---
Thats part of the reason I joined up with a guild already. I cant control server population but I can join a guild that needs me lol
---
&gt; The only way it affects YOUR gameplay is if you compare yourself to others.
---
So, the thing everyone does.   Grats, you just defeated yourself.
---
Kevin Jordan said they did not intend for all the raid buffs to be used to completely trivialize content. They'res a ton of shit they didn't like happening, but its about how much it effects the game as a whole. I think if they saw how world buffs were used on private servers now, they would have made them not stackable at the bare minimum.
---
I think the easy way to balance off specs like this is to eventually raise the debuff limit (perhaps only for new content) but to make a ret paladin use up 4+ debuff slots to do effective DPS. 
---
Paladin tanking for raids is probably a non-starter though because horde doesn’t have them. Unless they want to try to make a shaman tanking build that’s Raid viable in some limited way. I
---
Well it's white but I did have a random IKEA canvas there
---
Well no one saw this coming.... oh wait
---
It would probably be a 3rd faction of BE/NE/Forsaken/Naga based off of the alliances in W3
---
There would not be 5 second respawn in jintha'alor lol... Only in dun morogh and only when there's two thousand people there.
---
You act like the values can't be tweaked by zone and population. That's the whole point of the word DYNAMIC in the phrase "dynamic respawns" (which, by the way, were in real classic just not nearly as aggressive of spawn rates as private servers).
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/TolerantRespectfulHerbsKappaPride
---
Stream sniping
---
&gt; players will magically spread out evenly
---
You really think that needs responding to? Obviously people will disperse naturally.
---
If it's in the game and allowed by Blizzard, it's not a cheat. Get over it.
---
I do understand what you mean and I'm totally on your side. However, if blizzard doesn't cave in, this is the only thing we can do (and blizzard must be aware at this point). What will probably happen is for each server there will be a couple of voluntary people, whose only job is to sit there at the starting area and tell people that this is the german/french/spanish/x realm and people should go to realm X if they wanna be with their community. In the end it will regulate itself and we will have our national servers. 
---
Yes there will still be outsiders and it's unfortunate, but Blizzard decided their fate.
---
Probably, doesn't matter though because it's a slippery slope. Don't like world buffs? Join a guild that doesn't expect you to get them.
---
&gt; This. Layer it for the first couple of days (through the first weekend maybe) then shut it off. 
---
While I agree, it's a very safe conclusion that they won't do that regardless of a petition
---
I think it's too late to petition to be honest, we needed to make a hoot about it when it was announced. 
---
Instead, this sub decided to fucking defend it
---
Never thought about it quite like that, but you might be into something here.
---
&gt; Now I understand and see why people are so upset about it.
---
I still don't see an issue with it. I play PvE, so maybe we can turn on layering for PvE servers, and 5 hour queues for PvP servers.
---
I honestly haven't heard another solution to layering. People like to complain about layering, but offer no other solution that isn't insane.
---
How do you even C&amp;D for that? Parodies are fair use.
---
Not to mention the guys who did Naxx first KT had literally only 2 world buffs, the zg one that lives when you die and the DM Tribute run. They weren't stacking 7 buffs, the content was easier but not 2 and half minutes quicker to kill patchwerk easier.
---
In terms of progression and 1.13...
---
I would love to see the level cap stay at 60 - and add to our talent trees instead of adding levels. We would obtain talent points from PvE or PvP instead of leveling up.
---
This would give us the depth and complexity of insanely different builds, similar to PoE or whatnot.
---
No.  Very few people have. Luckily with streams lots of people can get a feel for the game without having played it.
---
I get it but blizzard is setting up these massive servers by using layering. At the same time people are asking for their own language based servers. So which European languages get their own server?  All of them, some of them?  Where’s the cutoff for demand?  Slovene, Estonian, Maltese all get their own servers? Why is it just European servers, do Oceanic populations not deserve their own language based servers too?
---
I really do understand the demand but it seems completely contrary with how Blizzard wants to run servers based on layering. I’m not a fan of layering but I just don’t see Blizzard carving out servers for specific languages. I would imagine they see it as opening a can of worms that they just aren’t going to deal with. 
---
At some point you’ll prob end up with a handful of underpopulated servers that would eventually get merged or whither away.
---
A great geared mage grinding elites or aoe farming will out farm a pure gathering alt.  
---
I am typically an advocate of min/maxing fully, I would just say that if you are undead and/or playing frost or elemental(so you have block), it is really difficult to fit glimmering mythril insignia into your trinket rotation.  You should have 3 reflectors, a net, invis, pvp, maybe a tidal charm, and a eventually pve powerups.  Once you get those powerup trinkets in particular, they are so powerful that you typically keep one of those on most of the time and only rotate through the other trinket slot.  I would typically rather reflector against a warlock or spriest then insignia.  
---
I would I think only go BS for insignia on mage if I was really interested in dueling tournaments and wanted the ability to double relfector+insignia, but I am not sure it is worth losing the powerup so you can rushdown and burst those classes.  
---
Keeping a gathering profession on your pvp focused main is a good way to get a lot of world pvp.
---
The short answer is yes if you aren't trying to be the best PvP Mage *or* the best PvE Mage. You're just going to be a mage that can do the things with one spec. But you mentioned you don't have mountains of time to dedicate so this will likely work wonderfully for you. Just don't spec Frostbite and deal with that concession in PvP.
---
It's your choice to compare your enjoyment of the game to the rewards and progress someone else makes in the game.
---
And that's a really shitty way to go through life.
---
&gt;  it’s hard to argue with someone who believes classes should be pigeon holed into only having abilities for their spec 
---
Yup if you going to tell me classic classes were good we can end the discussion right here
---
&gt; One guy said if ur gonna do sharding you might as well do a 100k megaserver. He basically meant to say, both approaches are terrible for classic, if you couldn’t catch that 
---
But it's the complete opposite of it each other? it's a terrible analogy to use, but I'm done arguing with you who doesn't even understand why layers are 3.5k players each or have not done any research at all into why things are as they are good day sir.
---
umm... that picture looks more like a man looking for a restroom after figuring out he may not be constipated any more...
---
Not like someone in a position to demand anything.

Is what Russian warrior players respond with when I'm looking for a tank on the private server I'm playing on.
---
It's honestly annoying.
---
So many Russians spamming world chat that they're looking for Russian guilds too.. which is obviously not a problem in of itself, but they stick together and generally only want to play with other Russians in order to not have to write English etc.
---
It divides the server population into several small groups that prefer to play only with each other and it's just not fun.
---
We are looking to do RPPVP if they give it to us. Central time zone.
---
Its both a Reddit forum and a Blizzard game forum, I'm actually shocked it isn't worse than it is.
---
You didn’t see an issue with hopping layers to mine/herb/kill the same rare mob?
---
&gt;I dont agree. I think many difficulties make you want to get better. 
---
?? I am talking about the value of the gear and the raids. Not the skills of players. Even so, if LFR or normal or heroic didn't exist, people would be forced to do Mythic. They would be forced to play like a Mythic player if they wanted to experience the endgame. This is exactly what people did in Classic, in TBC, and even in WoTLK with Heroic/ Normal difficulties. People had to learn to play the game.
---
Having different difficulties of raids/dungeons and different versions of the same gear lowers the value of the content and the item pieces. I still remember the pieces all of the warriors or hunters wanted because it was bis. You worked your way up through a single difficulty like everyone else and earned the items. **Achievements actually felt like achievements before Blizzard even implemented the achievements tab LOL.** Hell I still remember when my Black Bow of the Betrayer dropped off Illidan. There was only one version obtained through one version of the raid.
---
WTS ASMON LAYER 3G PST
---
That would be my guess as I absolutely never heard of it before r/classicwow.
---
Purging dragonslayer buffs while they go to raid.
---
AoE on beta is more difficult compared to pservers with the lack of spell leeway, increased melee leeway and spell batching. Not saying layering won't help, but it won't be as fast as pservers - Skorch was the first 30 on beta as a mage and it took him over 30 hours, which is a 5 day pace.
---
I heard in a guide video that often times, the troll passive gets OVERSTATED for mage.  Because usually, when you pop it, you are at full HP.  So you only get 10%.  10% increase doesn't even allow you to fit in another frostbolt/fireball into the 10 second buff window of the racial itself.
---
For the odd occasion that you do cast it while low HP, then it's pretty good obviously.
---
But if you're gonna go pvp server, or even consider pvp to any extent, then you definitely wanna go undead.
---
You know you’re a badass when you’re calling people kid online
---
yeah its really not that bad
---
Oh cool, when did they add New Londo and the Abyss to Classic?
---
Just how bad are you at the game that you need world buffs?  Are you afraid you can't compete without that crutch exploit?
---
Wish we had more of those around! Not everyone has to like the same things. :)
---
They're still free to play the game how they want, though. All playstyles (that fall within the ToS) are valid. There's nothing wrong with it. Classic isn't all about end game loot, but if there's a subset of people that *want* to make it all about end game loot, who cares? Let them. They're paying the same monthly fee as you are.
---
I played mage back in the day, I am 95% certain that clearcasting procced on the spell cast of arcane missles, and not on the individual hits.  Blizzard worked the same way.  so 10% overall for the spell.
---
Well when the toxic private server community find something they don't like they become very loud and very obnoxious, it's been this way for years but it goes in waves.
---
lmao yeah because we actually wish violence on people. Literally just dumb banter probably in poor taste but still.
---
Deadmines is one of the best dungeons.  Great way to introduce people to the dungeons as it's really evocative as you go through each section.  Each boss has some cool flavor or mechanic that brings them to life as more than just a bigger mob.   I remember well the feeling of shooting through that door and seeing the boat inside my very first time.  Very few games have had that feeling.
---
Don't let that stop you. Many people play mages, but never take the time to play them well. The same is also generally true with rogues. Also, Mages are in high demand in PvP and PvE groups.
---
Yep, I agree. Which is why I hope classic could bring a positive spin if they let it flow along the natural course the game takes. If they look at the good reception of certain things they could use it to let retail change to something that is decent again.
---
Why would I work for a company that I consider unethical? That's ridiculous.
---
I see what you're going for but 20 minutes is excessive. I could see maybe two minutes, five tops.
---
Any class that can heal
---
I will be known for successfully remaining anonymous,  I'll be like the fart you almost smelled.. gone with the breeze.
---
The issue will be getting invited to the next layer - that is the hardest part knowing whos in X layer etc and hoping they aren't pulled onto you etc.
---
Also it means having people to do that for you. The logistics are massive.
---
Yeah, this is a 14 year old game we're talking about that's more popular than the retail version of the game 14 years later.... And it's currently in beta LOL. Anyway, they've talked about fresh 60 content post-Naxx ;). I'd start worrying about the future of retail if I were a retail player.
---
I'm fortunate in that everyone I've worked for will vouch for me, all the way back to my graduate adviser. 
---
I feel like I don't interview well so I hope my manager's recommendations hold a lot of sway when looking at positions.
---
We as average players look to the top ones to see what they do and how they do it, I promise this using less people to clear raids to get more loot will permiate down the line, and by the time we realize the fucking damage that's been done, it'll be retail loot syndrome all over again with no recourse. I don't see what's so offensive to people that it makes them angry to think about actually having to earn their kills in current progress tier raids and then steam roll the farm raids with world buffs. I don't even see how that's controversial tbqh.
---
I doubt it, but I would very much welcome such changes to retail if they happen. :)
---
... Did you respond to the wrong person?
---
Lol yeah I'm taking the whole week off, but I end that week at 3 days /played I would be astounded.
---
i have actually drawn that comparison many times before. IVe said it's like the shitty game of thrones subreddit
---
It's allowed by shit pirated servers...  and you bitches are whining like a baby about to lose his lollipop.  You are scared shitless because you know blizzard might remove your crutch.
---
But will you give an unethical company $15 a month or purchase any of their products?  
---
Or are you just all talk?
---
Fr! How much did it cost???
---
You're welcome mate, and you're welcome to show me your macros so I can see where you're going wrong.

This is great, had no idea about multiple casts in a macro by using harm and noharm, super useful.

People who think everyone needs to be fluent in english fail to understand that not so long ago the internet wasn't a huge deal and anyone who didn't plan on going to an english speaking country (traveling also wasn't as prevalent as it is nowadays) literally had not reason to pay attention in class.
---
I feel sorry for the peeps who'll be struggling with communicating on english servers.
---
Streamer realm seems like win win.  Everyone who wants to be with a streamer can be on that realm and everyone who wants to avoid it just has to avoid 1 realm.
---
FUAK i forgot that one
---
Northern European realms! Just like EN servers usually are! Brits, Scandinavians and Benelux players, which 90% of all my guilds have consisted of anyways!
---
Also don't forget it's not only Germany. Austria and parts of Swiss, Luxembourg and Belgium also speak German. Even some Dutch prefer German over English. Same for Denmark or Czech Republic.
---
They were designed to stack, but they weren't designed to be all used at once in a raid.  Maybe keep watching kiddo?  The proper context is in the OP.
---
You're wrong here mate, at launch we had around 8 or 9 can't really remember perfectly french servers
---
Springvann på plastflaske til 1000% markup = disrespec

And I will speak Hungarian. Enjoy 20+ languages servers :D
---
It was absolutely allowed by Blizzard and intended by Blizzard, they just didn't anticipate that guilds would care to spend all the extra time and effort collecting them.
---
get ready to be stuck on the Latin american server JAJAJA  te veo en azeroth

Because it's not as easy to set up, so attracts more hard core players
---
I find it somewhat disingenuous that there are infinity threads about abusing layering when it’s only going to be present for an extremely short period of time, and only when people are in the earliest of zones and not very high level.
---
When you saw people in full t2, you asked them how they got it and where back in vanilla.
---
Now we know how they get it and we can see their logs, if you show logs of people consistently using world buffs and lowering the amount of people in a raid to get more loot, that concept is going to permiate down the line. I understand your point, but I really believe this is going to hurt the design of 40 man raids and the social bonding you get from them as a whole. I'm not advocating removal of the buffs totally, I just want them to be used for farm content and not progress content, it doesn't solve the issue as whole but it really meets the opposite group in the middle in terms of a resolution.
---
You are just mad, because you know it's a cheat, and you are scared shitless that blizzard might fix it.  Sad and pathetic.
---
Old Disturbed albums. :D
---
Haha. Just found an old macro when I was looking to the was named “fart on “insert friends name”” I made a macro just to fart on people. Specifically the person I played with the most.
---
&gt; You'll feel really cool
---
thanks for the reply, and this bit here really sold me. i know that feeling and nothing prompts learning and change quite like it.
---
...that and how much cleaner my UI could look by removing some bars!
---
If you aren't trying to exploit layering, you wouldn't see any issues.  You played as it was intended without layer swapping.
---
Source for "the initial plan was to shard the starting zones"? I've never seen that "plan" aside from this sub complaining about it and streamers talking about it.
---
Ashenvale
---
It’s awesome for using blind as a rogue
---
It's not the same thing. You can bet that only the elitest of people subbed for a CHANCE of beta or for joining the stress tests, most people would rather safe their money &amp; excitement for the actual launch. I get your point regarding a no-active-sub open beta, but **both** options don't exactly nail the amount of players who will play on launch day, as the actual number is either lower or higher. However, with an actual open beta, they could determine that the actual number of players must be lower, giving them valuable information. Maybe they should've done a mixture of both at two given points do better determine a number. But right now, they can't possibly guesstimate how many will play on launch and if realms are gonna sustain themselves or not. Sorry for wall of text.
---
This lava pool in IF was always harmless. But if you really want to die you can fall from the lava pool into the real magma (just walk at the edges of said pool), which gives you ~600ish damage per tick.
---
Imagine getting offended over internet janitors getting trash talked LMAO
---
Keep watching the video, when he initially sees the amount world buffs give as a bonus, and when the video gets to the talking point of it trivializing content.
---
Only L.A. bubble dwellers could make a decision this idiotic. Well done again, Blizzard.
---
literally unplayable
---
I think it’s fairly safe to say that no one is happy about layering and it doesn’t take a game designer to see why...
---
I don’t understand that argument you keep using because it’s retarded. 
---
It exists to solve a population problem that is inherent with how the game is designed early on. 
---
It’s not, by itself, good game design - if it was - it would exist past phase 1, which it won’t.
---
You are aware that this is the point of making wow classic right?
---
There has and always will be those that exploit everything exploitable in wow. Blizzard often reacts accordingly.
---
Nah. Day one warriors will diminish a ton. That grind is real
---
Best strategy, scare your cowardly opponents to not push or attack mages while they get AoE'd down.
---
Nice work lol
---
Last thing i need is a better chair....
---
We can do both though, it's always better to have a reliable plan b.
---
That's why I respect the work of this guy, because he is spending time on a project which may never be used. (hopefully)
---
I'm on their Discord now.. i didn't realize there is a cap of how many servers you can join..
---
I mean it's obviously an opinion (one that you asked for btw) so I'm not sure why you're getting so bent out of shape - obviously Blizzard isn't going this route so why do you care what I'd prefer?
---
Sharding is easily my least favorite thing about retail WoW; having a character model phase in/out right in front of me is something I *loathe*.  Layering may have a different implementation than Sharding, but as long as people are phasing in/out it undermines the idea of a shared world, which is one of the big appeals of classic wow.  
---
Again, no reason you need to be upset about how I see things, but if you can't handle someone else's opinion you probably should going around asking for them.
---
Agree
---
At first i thought its about ninja turtles
---
Frostbite is the most essential talent for PvP. OP should just roll a Warlock if he doesn’t want to respec.
---
The fact you said this is proof most people on the pro layering side don't actually understand how it works.
---
What you're saying is sharding. Layering is continent wide, which actually makes it more ripe for abuse than sharding because of it's bottom heavy nature. Sharding would keep this kind of behavior to the starting zones and even alleviate the rare node farm/rare mob explots. 
---
What a shocker, Blizzards 'fix' for something actually makes it worse. Don't forget people we're dealing with Blizzard in 2019. They've fallen a long way since the golden age when we all fell in love with them.
---
to be fair, nothing will get this fixed faster than an addon that abuses it
---
I thought I might just not be remembering correctly. The lower pool absolutely vaporizes you still.
---
We only use World Buffs in three scenarios:
---
1. World Firsts where every single tiny advantage can mean the difference between winning or not.
---
2. Speedruns where every single tiny advantage can shave seconds off your record time.
---
3. Splitting up the raid into smaller teams to get more loot.
---
It has nothing to do with simply completing content.
---
It didn't even work, he kept getting ganked by the same people.
---
I mean in some sense you're right, only the top players will get to reduce their numbers down on naxx content and maybe your average progress guild will not be able to get away with it on content at naxx level, but that's still a long period of time that they can get away with it. I genuinely hope I'm wrong about it.
---
No. Sharding just happens whenever the server decides it wants to move you. Layering only has a few specific triggers, and being invited to a group where the leader is in a different one is the main one causing issue.
---
Me?  No, I want the shops to be for everyone.  I've made that quite clear.
---
If they give me the product I want, yes. Blizzards current game design revolves around milking as much money as possible, regardless of how many people are enjoying their game. It's why WoW remains as profitable as ever with 1/10th the playerbase. The modern gaming industry isn't about making good games, it's about making profitable ones. Blizzard aren't stupid, they are malicious. There's quite a large difference.
---
[k](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/738/025/db0.jpg)
---
Yep. Especially in dungeons. DM:E lashers , DM:N Hyjenas, Zul Gurrub Crocs - when it comes out. Farming instances is not only profitable it is also a safe way to make money because of no competition for mobs
---
Me and a group of like 12 other late-20 year olds from high school are planning on subbing for Classic. I've talked to a bunch of other people that quit around late WotLK or Cata that are planning on coming back that never played a private server and have no interest in Retail. I know that's anecdotal but they're about to be blown away I feel.
---
Great work, I wish there was something similar for the Horde.
---
get some, thats awesome. how much did that cost ya?
---
&gt; can't wait 20 minutes to group together then you really aren't apart of the classic crowd in a real sense anyways.
---
I have 2 hours max to play during weekdays - 20 minutes is excessive.
---
Sure until there are no people in your particular language and you're on a dead ass server crying about not enough people.
---
Can anyone link that desk?
---
Yea, so, um, layering will not be around for very long at all. But more importantly, the group XP hit you’d take for grinding mobs while in a group would cripple whatever advantage you’re claiming exists by layer hopping.
---
From what I hear warlock Shadow Mastery / Ruin build is pretty much optimal in both PvE and PvP.

Black Dragonscale Boots - [https://classicdb.ch/?item=16984](https://classicdb.ch/?item=16984)
---
First of all the boots require crafting materials which only drop in MC so they will not be available at the start. Second the legs compete with Devilsaur Leggings which are better on their own. Third the Attack Power on the chest might come with a 1hr cooldown, I'm at this point not sure what the cooldown does.
---
If you combine the Shoulders, Chest and Boots they become very competitive. I've made my most damaging pre-raid gear build with this set. Again if the cooldown mechanic on the chest is very limiting this set might not be worth it.
---
That was everything I had to contribute, thanks for reading.

This one I agree with but probably not day 1. Definetly in the first month a lot of warriors will rethink their class choice. Even fewer will try to tank

&gt;items/quests linked in different languages is something that can get annoying real fast. 
---
TBF most of the nouns and verbs are going to be very similar. Nearly 45% of the english language stems from French, nearly 40% of the words in English have a related Spanish counterpart. I as a native English speaker have maybe seen 2 or 3 items posted in those languages, including Italian, that I had trouble translating. It really is not that hard, especially ones with proper nouns. 
---
W/ proper noun
---
**Ashkandi, Greatsword of the Brotherhood** 
---
**Ashkandi, espadon de la fraternité** 
---
Fraternite relates to fraternity which is synonymous with the word brotherhood, not hard in anyway.  
---
Espadon is a type of swordfish to english speakers, if you don't know that its understandable though. 
---
**Ashkandi, la gran espada de la Hermandad**
---
La gran is obviously related to the english word grand which is synonymous with great.
---
Espada again is in relation to the english name for a species of swordfish. 
---
**Ashkandi, Großschwert der Bruderschaft** 
---
Bruder is the root for the english word brother, it also appears in many male only christian orders, which 64% of english speakers are a part of (christianity.) 
---
w/o proper noun
---
**Azuresong Mageblade**
---
**Lame de mage chanson azur**
---
Azur and Azure is a clear similarity.
---
The word mage is the same in both languages.
---
**Hoja de mago de la Canción azul**
---
Azul and Azure is a clear similarity as well.
---
Mago and mage are clearly similar too.
---
**Azurblaue Liedermagierklinge** 
---
Even the german one for this is easy, Azurblaue sure looks quite similar to azublade.
---
Liedermagierklinge has the word mage represented in german quite similarly to the english.
---
Throw me some other examples if you would like, I'd enjoy them for my own amusement especially the harder ones. With scandi/balkan/rus words english only speakers will definitely have more trouble, but how fun is looking up german words, spoiler it is really fun. 
---
If you go at it from a contemptuous view yes it will be annoying, but if you are open to learning about language and being inclusive it really has no impact more than a few seconds.
---

Human spirit is not very good on mage, you will get some spirit from raid buffs and some on early gear, but your goal is to gear out of spirit for better stats as soon as possible.

Gnome gets the 5% int modifier, this is significantly better as you will always have a ton of int on mage.  This helps a little with your mana pool, but in a raid situation you typically are not using every bit of your mana.  You do get some crit from int.  The actual dps gain is about 0.5% crit in blue gear upto maybe 0.8% crit by the time you are in naxx gear, so it is quite small but not nothing.  
---
Other then that human has 1 more stam so 10hp more then gnome.
---
I have actually just bought the US version of the game and subbed for it too. Because i want to be able to communicate without a luck of the draw situation. Its a stupid choice on Blizzards side.
---
I’ve never heard of using less people to clear raids to get more loot except for Onyxia.
---
Your desk setup reminds me of mine. I had three monitors but they took up too much real state so I just removed one of the side ones lol
---
Warrior/Pally/Pally.  Then 3 rogues are easy.
---
Awesome :)
---
Not to mention the group XP hit you take being in a group to get to the new layer.
---
so, the players sniping him are allowed to use laying to get at him, but he isnt? isnt that very hypocritical? one thing is not wanting to get sniped, another is using avaiable tools like everyone else does to avoid other players that also happens to target him.
---
I'm not scared Blizzard is going to fix it. They never considered stacking World Buffs against the EULA, they never nerfed or disallowed World Buffs in any Vanilla content, and they said their main goal is an authentic Vanilla experience. So no, they're not going to change it.
---
And again, you keep throwing that word "exploit" around as if you own it. Until Blizzard calls it an exploit, it's not one.
---
thanks for sharing
---
In this case the context was  'waiter in a touristy place' . They deal with foreigners every day, and I'd expect some English knowledge as part of the job requirements, no?
---
I don't think expecting ability to speak English from random strangers is warranted. That was not my point.
---
Strongest at what?
---
Thinking a Beast + Marks + survival hunter would be an absolute beast in WPvP.
---
Please please someone post this on the official forums with video evidence. We need to get this changed before launch. This is so far from authentic vanilla...
---
so what if its crowded? go explore and level that way or simply farm mobs
---
I just hot key everything with shift, ctrl, alt, and combinations of those with letters and numbers. Macros might make it easier though
---
Yeah, defiantly.  I'd probably play a Pally tank or something unconventional, but a raid will usually only let 1 of those meme specs into a raid.  I know there are a lot more of us, "Imma do ME" people out there compared to spare raid slots.
---
well of course it will.
---
It's not about communicating but building deep friendship my friend.
---
I saw it on /r/all and thought it looked like BFD, sorry to inconvenience you.
---
Oh look another topic on layering
---
The road goes ever on and on, down from the steps where it began,.... 
---
*whistles softly away
---
u can make way more advanced macros with vanilla /script
---
with skills activating on conditions checking for enemy buffs/debuffs as well as player powerbars(u will only heroic strike if you have more than 50 rage or u will only sinister strike if over 50 energy etc)
---
about what specifically?
---
Cant, going with the guy who posted this two hours ago.
---
Retail players are not relevant to Classic (completely different audience), and the total available population for an old school MMORPG is much larger than retail's current population (about 3-5x larger by my estimation). It may be a niche, but it's not a niche Blizzard was complaining about in 2007.
---
We could similarly argue Classic will get an influx from GW2 or FFXIV. Those games have similar populations but are not as disjointed as BfA (FFXIV actually has proper leveling) and the transition there may be very different: they may stick around. Some FFXIV stragglers may be longing for more FFIX like game and may find Classic tolerable, etc.
---
So, yes, I think they're wrong, because they shouldn't be looking at retail players at all. *They should be evaluating whether or not Classic will appeal to all those people itching to play something like this for the past 15 years and all their friends.*
---
It's very very hard to guess what will happen with classic but guessing that it will drop off based off of retail players is just silly. Classic is a slow burn acquired taste kind of deal, if it stays afloat for a reasonable  amount of time, uncorrupted, unruined by Blizzard's questionable business policies, it may very well explode again. I don't think it would be an instant thing and I think it'd be word of mouth, as more people realize Classic exists and is the real deal. But it needs some time to live, about a year.
---
I'm not arguing that it **will**, there are too many unknowns, I'm arguing that it's a toss up and a company in another situation would not be betting on their own game to fail. More and more this seems like Blizzard is uncomfortable that a game genre they can't understand might succeed and they just want more leverage to shut down PServers and possibly the whole genre.
---
That is a nasty combo, but I think warrior/lock/pally would beat it.  Did Druids even have Cyclone in vanilla?
---
You have every right in the world to feel that way. I just see no positives from trying to prevent people from playing the way they want. I personally don't believe the use of World Buffs for end game content will hurt the social bonding, social interaction, etc. If a Raid is using World Buffs to clear content more easily/with a smaller team, that still requires a *great deal* of social bonding and interaction between the members to coordinate and pull off.
---
I would argue that all World Buffs really do is allow the realm of responsibility in a Raid to be split in fewer ways. If you're accumulating World Buffs to clear content, but also cutting the number of Raid members by 25%, you're still achieving a difficult task, just in a different way. I don't think it makes the rewards they receive illegitimate or any less impressive.
---
Aw, you've never communicated with the Alliance?
---
You don't know what you're missing; and maybe that's a good thing.  
---
And I am advocating for "freedom" of everyone playing together.  Your opinion of "freedom" isn't necessarily any other individual's definition.
---
I'm not at all afraid Blizzard will change World Buffs. Namely because they won't. They never did in Vanilla and Classic is meant to be an authentic Vanilla experience regardless of what the playerbase thought of anything in Vanilla.
---
But even if they did, that would mean all our competitors couldn't have them either. So we'd still get our World Firsts, we'd still get our speedrun records, and we'd still split the raid up.
---
Both an unpopular and plainly wrong opinion. Private servers were a mess of xenophobia, especially at EU peak hours, with several mods existing to block specific languages. And this is in a scenario where 10s of thousands of players could use the same server, decreasing the population fragmentation impact of Blizzard's decision. 
---
The private server experience is a prime example of why English-only servers fail.
---
I’m assuming you’d stay in the layer of the person that just added you
---
Just force english client on the non-russian server = problem solved.
---
It's an IKEA desk, easy to find on their site
---
I have the same Funko Collection!
---
yeah this will never work lol
---
But they already have those people to support Retail WoW (and their other games).
---
I just noticed your username.  Troll here (only about an hour south of the bridge)!
---
Where was this stated? I've been saying it's a better idea to just shard the starting areas, up to and maybe including STV.  Only for the initial launch of the game obviously.
---
Classic had a tool..
---
Did you even attempt to read the responses? Because literally no one is saying that.
---
They think there are just hundreds of fresh layers existing in perpetuity for the clever haxor to get into. No layers will exist out of necessity. So any layer you get put into will have a crap ton of people on it....hence the whole fucking reason we need layers.
---
Classic DOA, when is F R E S H?!?!?!?!
---
There's good reason for concern about a few things.  However, a lot of hive mind fools are complaining about many non-issues.
---
I had fun
---
In Barrens chat 24/7
---
That's correct.
---
More like sunken temple
---
I watched the whole thing 2 nights ago, I'll clip it together late tonight and make a meta post about it with actual citations.
---
Are you hot?
---
No. I don't want to. Standing in line day 1 to kill named mobs, leveling purely by exploration, or attempting to farm the same mobs as dozens of others isn't the classic experience that I want. Luckily for me, it looks like I won't have to! Thank you Blizz for not ruining launch by listening to these try-hards.
---
They already said somewhere that the first realm transfer would be free of charge for that reason.
---
Don't worry about the head to head performance. Shamans provide totally different benefits to a raid group than a priest. You will definitely find a group as a shaman and you should 100% play what looks like fun to you.
---
Doesn’t work that way. How would you get back to your layer?
---
Would be nice if the blizzard devs, a multi billion dollar company, could give us a new MMO in the warcraft universe.
---
Where the scale is much grander.
---
inbefore "BUT IT TAKES SO LONG TO TRAVEL FROM THE MAILBOX TO THE AUCTION HOUSE OR BANK THEN!!!!!!!111"
---
Guild Wars 2, ESO towns and cities atleast feel like it.
---
In WoW a town has like 5 people in it.
---
Iron Forge like 20.
---
Why not? Most of them are going to quit before level 10.
---
You should really have mega threads for layering and streamers since most of the posts are on those two topics.
---
How about make servers for both of us? Half servers with layering, half without.. seems good to me.
---
Priest then Pally then Warrior in that order.
---
&gt; just how big your numbers are
---
just do more dmg 4Head
---
Very cool looking for sure.
---
World buffs really aren't considering that mandatory man. Even in relatively high preforming guilds I've been in on private servers there have always been slackers who just didn't bother with them and the raid didn't bat an eye. I'm not offended by people not wanting to get world buffs. When I raided it was a lot of work, world buffs aren't fun. But there's dozens of aspects of vanilla that are objectively unfun. The only reason I plan to play Classic is because I enjoy purging peoples world buffs, that's the aspect of the game I like. I like that I can hunt down someone every week and fuck up their raid performance. I like that they'll remember me and that there's a larger social dynamic that spans across instances, the overworld, dungeons, raids, factions, etc. That's why I enjoy vanilla. The game at its core is actually pretty fucking terrible, but because of these unpredictable sand-box like encounters it starts to feel like an interactive world rather than just a game. And like the world most of it isn't very fun, fair, or balanced. Are you okay with removing the aspect of the game I play because you feel a social obligation to get DMT buffs? Perhaps you are and that's alright I suppose, but I personally don't think anyone should be able to remove any aspect of the game. I think we leave it as it is and deal with any problems it might have, because attempting to solve those problems is much too risky.
---
Except you can switch on demand by getting invited by someone on a different layer, or just relogging in many cases as has been shown on the beta.
---
1.12 had dynamic spawning and they’ve already made plenty of changes including layering so.... ?
---
How would a  regular player coordinate this? Just whisper random people not in a group or guild and hope they are in a layer different from yours? 
---
He's a streamer with an entourage following him around which makes it easier to determine layers. You will not be able to shout into open space for an invite.
---
Can’t sell it because copyright. He provided a hi res version for free for people to print
---
I only came across that after I saw this video and looked further into layering.
---
Honestly I haven't been paying much attention to streamers or the whole layering topic.
---
I admitted in my original post to that as well.
---
Layering so far seems to be more harmful than beneficial.
---
&gt;I think it’s fairly safe to say that no one is happy about layering and it doesn’t take a game designer to see why...
---
It has flaws, but the pros outweigh the cons.
---
I think we will see more like Venezuela and Indonesian gold farmers
---
\&gt;Layering will hamper the ability to know which language is the dominant one for weeks
---
what?!
---
... point is why should he care about Alliance? He's not gonna compete with them for gear.
---
I explained this to you in crayon.  No one used it...  This was only exploited on the shit pirate servers.  And even they decided it was an exploit and removed it for 1 month.
---
And you missed the entire point of my comment thinking I didn't know this one fact. Congrats. I already knew about the to. I have used said tool. Yes it bad and yes it sucks. But again that is part of the classic experience which is the ENTIRE POINT of playing classic.
---
There is not even close to 10% of english words being from any sort of celtic substrate, let alone any of the Gaelic languages. There has been relatively little borrowing by English from Welsh (Brittonic, rather than Gaelic, but in closer contact with English for longer) or Irish. Nor from Scottish Gaelic. 
---
Sorry for the pedantry!
---
I wish I got 138 ping to NA servers. More like 220 from Western Australia.
---
You don't have to do anything. You can not get into beta and wait like the rest of us
---
If Blizzard changes World Buffs, we won't care. We'll still get our World Firsts, we'll still get our speedrun records, and we'll still split the raid up. We just won't have to collect the World Buffs knowing our competitors will even if we don't.
---
But Blizzard will not change World Buffs.
---
In my experience these people are the ones populating the ENG servers. All of them speak English well too. Although, being a Norwegian I know there are «enclave servers» where many Norwegians will play and have Norwegian guilds, but still use English outside of said guilds...
---
... except for the occational «SKÅL» spam in trade chat, of course.
---
I thought as much.
---
Didn't save me from the downvote army though.
---
Imagine getting offended over an internet forum post being locked, so you wish death on others.
---
What kinks? This is what it's supposed to do. There were a lot of people next to him so it sent him to another layer. It isn't broken, it's just an awful system.
---
It's honestly sad that no matter how much people complain/express what is wrong with layering, people like you just refuse to get it until you see a video of it.
---
Honestly just make or find a late night raiding guild. I'm NA and I'm gonna be doing 12-3am raids.
---
&gt;Grow up
---
I am, I just pointed out something very telling, just as it is very telling about your age when your argument comprises of insults because your feelings were somehow hurt. 
---
&gt;Its a fucking video game and you're measuring leavels of empathy 
---
I am not measuring levels of empathy as you can clearly see, where did that thought process come from? If you think I was collecting drops of empathy in a graduated cylinder I wasent. I was just using turn of phrase to enhance my point, and to add a bit of fun to the diction. This is done quite often in many forms of written media, check out nearly anything ever written and you might get the point I was trying to make.
---
close enough.
---
Don't apply to become a mod here folks. This sub has horrible leadership and being a mod is a pain rather than a blessing.
---
I've been there and believe me, it's not fun.
---
Do you still get an xp hit if the other player is not even near you? Say in another zone.  I'm pretty sure you still get max xp unless the other party member is close enough to get the mob xp too.
---
You just gave me a flashback. I was one of those, who migrated to Kor’gall from Agamaggan.
---
I especially like the part where he says:
---
&gt; Let them play the game how they want and you play the game how you want. Let them have their fun and you have your fun.
---
That's a lesson you should take to heart.
---
As a Brit I love the Danes. Visiting Denmark and interacting with the people was so easy. A lot of similarities too in their mannerisms.
---
It's a side project to them. It only has to get around 2 million subs to compete with current wow. Which considering since 2005-2013 there were over 100 million accounts made. That's just 2% to compete with today! Then with how much Classic has been dominating Twitch it's pretty apparent there is a big interest in this relaunch. 
---
Yet Blizzard doesn't have different language servers for EU and are fine with having servers with 15k people at launch even though 1 layer is 3000 people. That means a server has to drop 5x in population before the end of phase 1 to not be layered. Which honestly I expect a lot of people to fall off, that is a given but if any server is over 3000 people come phase 2 it will have to be layered. On the test realms there are about 31 servers which means they expect around 100k people to be playing Classic come phase 2. That's fucking low, like really low. What's going to happen when there are 200k? 500k? 1 million? Blizzard has underestimated Classic's popularity at every turn and to expect them to change that trend now is actually illogical.
---
I'm reluctant to admit it but that's a fair point at bare minimum. World buffs for me used to be something we'd pick up like rallying cry to kill rag when we wiped a few times and got the routine down. I know it won't be that way coming now, but the evidence from the private servers definitely indicates at bare minimum this is something we should keep a close eye on when Ony and MC come out.

Everyone saying that layering is in the game until end of phase one.  But they've stated that's the worst-case scenario and would like to remove it sooner.
---
Think about it from blizzard perspective.  What would generate more hate? Outcry from the subreddit which comprises an extremely small minority of the classic playerbase?  Or outcry when the game launches with no layer/shard mechanic, and you have people asking for refunds because they spend half the time in queue, and the other half fighting for simple quest mobs.
---
The French are still salty they got out-colonized.
---
I learned that I only want to fight that hard for mobs once, so logged off at level 4.
---
The confusing part is that both stats can result in the "resist" message.
---
Spell hit will result in your spells getting less resisted based on hitting them from YOUR side(think melee miss).
---
Resists make your spells do less damage(think block) or - if fully resisted(= dodge) no damage at all. 
---
Spell penetration does only reduce the second part and will result in fewer spell "blocks" and "dodges"-kind of resists.  It has no influence on the "miss"-resists however, that is only affected by spell hit.
---
Fucking pussy
---
Ban every single French/Italian/German/French/Spanish/French/Russian/French/Turk and whatever other nationality is too pigheaded to speak English.
---
You must speak two languages to ride this ride, motherfuckers. I am personally sick and tired of these people being catered too. As if they're the only Europeans who have a different mothertongue than English. Let these lazy imbeciles learn that communication is a two-way street, because I have a 30 year history in video games and I have been sick and tired of these mongoloids still not having adapted to a modern world. 
---
Don't cater to fuckheads that can't speak English. Get yourselves the fuck back to third grade and pick up a fucking book, you lazy inbred yokel fucks.
---
Hmm i didnt know the point of classic was that tools suck
---
What could go wrong?
---
Everything.
---
It’s not 2005 man, it isn’t going to be the same.
---
He contradicts himself later, like I get his point, but it's not that simple and I think we all know that.
---
Yup, the difference there is just cleaning up your UI. With keybinds, you still have to have all those different mods on the screen. You'll still want to have macros on those buttons for mouseover, help, harm conditions, so you might as well fold in the modifiers and clean up your screen.
---
Good pvpers are always in demand
---
I’ve leveled 2 hunters in private servers and plan of being 60 with the early first wave. Engineering and early accumulation of gear will make me desirable.
---
Hunters are fantastic in phases 1&amp;2 and after that I can play my dwarf priest more.
---
This was because hunter performs really well at lower levels.
---
it is extremely telling that blizzard hasn't said anything about this.
---
I agree with this fully, I'd rather have a fucking RP-PvP server than a realm in my language.
---
Rofl, I can guarantee you'll be among the most vocal people when you express how angry you are that classic shuts down after just a couple of months because all of the players that could have kept it afloat didn't stick around. Go be a try-hard somewhere else. If you think someone is below you because they can only dedicate 10 hours on weekdays, then you're genuinely a pos. Not much else to say.
---
I wonder precisely how much Activision is involved in the decisions of Blizzard with regards to WoW Classic.
---
Begging high lvls for gold on my cheap whore undead female alt
---
I tried to kill hogger by multiboxing 40 level 1 mages and they all died
---
reminds me more of new londo tbh
---
This post has been locked for bigotry ofc
---
About $80 for his version
---
No one used the exploit in vanilla.  That was the authentic vanilla experience...   This was only exploited on the shit pirate servers. And even they decided it was an exploit and removed it for 1 month on new raids.
---
Are you saying blizzard is less honorable than a shit pirated server?
---
Yes, that's exactly what it's going to be.. World of Asmongold.. any more doomsayer exaggerations you wish to make or did you get that out of your whiney little system??
---
I wish Blizzard would just put this to rest already and confirm Aussie servers. Maybe if we make enough noise...
---
I find it incredibly disingenuous to spread lies about layering, like how Blizzard employees have referred to it as the ["early _months_"](https://youtu.be/UHMd0KC3eTY?t=779) and only given us the promise it'll be gone by phase 2, but you still get these super naive people thinking it'll only be in the game for like a week. 
---
I mean sure, let's not listen to what Blizzard are saying, random redditor for sure knows better.
---
&gt;  i really dont get it.
---
Because its an extremely simple to abuse system producing unintended results.
---
I prefer my charge macroed with hamstring.
---
If it needs a streamer outside the game to do it, how is it more organic than a feature in-game?
---
I made a joke, you are the ones who seem butthurt about it. 😂
---
That's true, but we're using the modern macro system so I think /script doesn't work. But yeah, scripts are drastically more powerful than macros. That's why they were removed, eventually.
---
If we as players categorize content completed with and without world buffs and logs separated by dps with and without world buffs, then I actually think the damage from them will be reduced significantly. So we'll see how it goes.
---
Hmm I didn't k kw that someone could be so oblivious. Thanks for trying mate. But the point of classic is to have the classic experience. Maybe learn to read first before commenting.
---
For me it's not a problem because I usually always hold down a mouse button when in a fight so I can look around. So actually hovering over something is not something I would naturally do. But I don't use that many @mousover macros, only for stuff like decurse and slowfall (I'm a mage). Did use it a lot when I levelled my priest as disc in modern WoW, but it never really caused any problems, because yeah, if I'm damaging enemies it's a reflex for me to hold down right mouse button.
---
looks like you don't care.  Whining like a kid in the grocery store.
---
What’s the argument against only being able to switch layers in tested areas (cities and inns)?
---
I feel like it would solve a decent amount of the issues.
---
Again, as I’ve stated elsewhere - I agree. Let me rephrase and say that I hope layering ends soon. 
---
I think it’s very much a necessary evil to combat population surges that never existed in vanilla. 
---
I just want it gone as soon as feasibly possible.
---
This is usually a problem for English speakers only. At least for me (Spanish) I don't have any problem with this.
---
I mean I understand written English, French, Italian and Portuguese (Spanish native)
---
The problem could be voice chat in French and Portuguese, but English I already have almost native level (higher to some natives I guess) and Italian is quite easy to understand spoken wise for a Spanish.
---
I know that it can be annoying but I started learning English 10 years ago with wow and other games, and so far so good
---
You are insufferable.
---
Only going to be a problem the first two weeks of classic. After that it’s gone.
---
You can actually do exactly the same thing as a cast sequence. You'd want to leave the stance changes on a /cast so you can switch and charge in one press.
---
/cast [harm, nocombat, nostance:1] Battle Stance; [harm, combat, nostance:3] Berserker Stance
---
/castsequence [harm, stance:1] reset=target Charge, Hamstring; [harm, stance:3] Intercept, Hamstring
---
It’s not that hard. Abilities that require a specific stance can be almost the same as the regular skill, besides it switching to the neccesary stance. (That’s about it) 
---
I played shaman, priest and warrior at vanilla, simple macro’s are easy to set up. 
---
Really loved to activate recklessness(damage cooldown) and a + damage trinket for example with just one click!
---
If I remember correctly it’s something like this, one button to activate dps cooldowns and then use a damaging ability, if one of them is on cooldown, it still works (but can’t activate recklessness for example):
---
/cast beserker stance
---
/cast Recklessness
---
/cast bloodthirst
---
/cast whirlwind
---
We absolutely used World Buffs in Vanilla and stacked as many as possible for several runs. Pservers are the ones that removed their use for World Firsts.
---
What another useful and interesting post on this topic thats never been brought up before.
---
Rested, out of combat, not dead.  Should be sufficient, don't really need much of a timer.  An alternative to rested might be "on a gryphon".
---
All it has to do is apply to the person moving layers (i.e. not the party leader).
---
Ahh true that, so I guess the gold rush will be more of a literal one... not as cool, but more fair. That’s okay I guess hahha
---
Has blizzard said that you need to be in a close proximity to hop layers or is that how it works on beta? If not it’s safe to assume you only need to be in the same zone, or even continent to hop layers so you wouldn’t have to share xp.
---
Trinkets are top priority for everyone in pvp.
---
Yeah,  the game could do without macros
---
Thanks! I had thought about it, but I'm way too unfamiliar with all of the different Horde quests, I wouldn't know which ones are worth doing / capable of doing, etc.
---
There's still 2 months available, give it a shot?
---
Nope no need. They're going to have layering for launch then rapidly remove it. I'll be happy, 90% of people will be happy, and you'll forget it ever happened. Luckily for me, this is exactly what's going to happen.
---
Trade you spots.. about 3.5hrs here. Everywhere south of Clare is just a corn field for the most part. :(
---
&gt; It may be a niche, but it's not a niche Blizzard was complaining about in 2007.
---
WoW in 2007 wasn't niche though, it was quite the opposite. WoW was designed for mass appeal and to target a wider, more casual audience of PC gamers who didn't want to do the crazy grinding of it's predecessors.  It's niche now, because the market and player interests and expectations are way different than they were a decade ago. Online gaming as a whole is way different.
---
 &gt;I'm not arguing that it will, there are too many unknowns, I'm arguing that it's a toss up and a company in another situation would not be betting on their own game to fail. More and more this seems like Blizzard is uncomfortable that a game genre they can't understand might succeed and they just want more leverage to shut down PServers and possibly the whole genre.
---
Blizzard isn't betting Classic is going to fail, they wouldn't make it if they thought that. Classic not having millions of players and growing into phenomenon isn't a failure. From Blizzard's persepctive, success for Classic would be a stable 300-500k players paying a sub they otherwise wouldn't be paying. From a player perspective, all Classic needs is realms to not be dead, which is exactly what Blizzard is protecting against. 
---
If you think it's more likely that Classic is going to blow up than it is it will just be a small niche game, then that's fine, we won't know until it happens. That being said, I think it's pretty reasonable to assume that it will lose a large number of it's initial players, and that Blizzard should take precautions for that.
---
It's much better to be surprised by population growth than to be unprepared for population loss.
---
I don't see the problem, The EU works like this sometimes haha
---
you're concerned with a server being so crowded that you can barely play, but then you're worried about missing some lockouts if blizz lets you transfer? wouldn't you be missing more lockouts due to the streamer?
---
This is the exact argument people used against Classic all these years. "You can't change it, it isn't happening, stop whining. Go play something else."
---
That's amazing buddy. Thanks for the share. So dreamy.
---
I got a warrior to level 15 and yanked RFC twice and successfully!! Very happy.
---
I feel no one even read what the mod does....
---
Going against the classic experience would be auto queuing teleporting rewards upon completion etc
---
An addon that can parse key terms and put it in a window for you is not gonma break the experience...
---
Sintra, Portugal according to the other post
---
&gt; That's kind of a weird way to frame the racial. It's hard to overstate a numerical value. You cast 10% faster and are doing 10% more damage.
---
You might be right there.  This was something I just saw this morning in a YT video.  But thinking about it more simply like this is probably the best way to go about it.
---
Can you show the full screen I part of me thinks you took the screenshot from someone else's stream/ video.  There's a lot in those bags to obtain in just a couple of days.  Also isnt that a wc quest?
---
retail players have been on this sub for about as long as they realized that they can't ruin the project from the forums alone.
---
On a stress test server that's being pushed way beyond the norm in an attempt to break it?
---
Come on, you can piece this together.
---
To all of the people saying ordinary players won’t be able to do this... Go watch Monkeynews video. He shows that anyone can swap layers just by logging into different characters.
---
We’re fucked. Rip classic 2019. #catchkony2019
---
I just keybind each modifier instead. So I have one action bar button for E, and one for shift-E, and one for ctrl-E, for example. Then I hide every bar except one or two where I put all my cooldowns.
---
Us people let you have your game? I played vanilla Christmas of 2004. I want to play this again. I want this as much as the older fans do. But I can also recognize that just because there was something in the game then does not mean it was great, and if Blizzard can ease that up for everybody involved, it’s a win. And the very small minority of people bitching and moaning about layering for a little bit are just that, a small minority of people who will just deal with it.
---
But I can also realize that blizzard can keep the same game with no changes made while also making very minor, easy quality of life changes to the game for a couple of weeks that will not have an effect on your gameplay at all and will just be better for everybody involved. Why does the #NoChanges group have to get so upset over every little detail?
---
It’s going to be the same game you played years ago with a few changes made that have zero effect on how you will play the game. Re-fucking-lax.
---
The main problem is the rise of "unofficial" servers. Most of us don't care because we speak English and know there will be plenty of English speakers on whatever server we chose.
---
Yup, lots of drama about something that isn't going to matter much at all.
---
What kind of comment is this lmao? You make up a bunch of stuff that Blizzard “believes” and then make a judgement based on your fabricated logic. This is literally just a “blizzard bad upvotes to the left” comment.
---
Personally I'm here just to see the eventual hype train crash once people realize *en masse* that their lives have moved on and Classic won't make them like they were 15 years ago.
---
The german discord server to organize between france, spain and italy even made it to the media 
---
&gt;https://www.gamestar.de/artikel/wow-classic-deutsche-community-server,3345640.html
---
I was the first comment posted here, so no I can't say I did. I was talking more about the general attitude of the sub.
---
How about this.  If you enter PvP combat, you can't change layers for, I dunno... 30 minutes.  That mostly preserves World PvP.  Second, changing layers puts you on a 30 minute cool down before you can change again.  That mostly prevents resource/rare mob abuse.
---
“As iconic as”
---
No. 
---
0 appearances in wc3 and TFT versus races that have tons. And goblins weren’t even playable. 
---
Everything they had was replaced with dwarfs.
---
Is John paxson more iconic than Michael Jordan just because he was an nba player first? Are you intentionally acting daft for a laugh?
---
Dude great analysis. This is the kinda post I come for 💯
---
"I'm heavily influenced by social media, so please go back to hype so I can be hyped"
---
I think you underestimate how many tourists there will be. I'd be amazed if 25% of players who try out classic actually stayed around permanently.
---
From where I'm sitting, it's exactly the same fucking thing with a different name. It has the effect of splitting up the community into different dimensions in the same zone.
---
It's shit.
---
It's harmful.
---
And it's NOT VANILLA.
---
Fuck anyone defending layering and saying it's a "necessity". It's not.
---
And fuck the retail babies who Actiblizzion are catering to with this garbage.
---
I've never personally cared what dps join my leveling groups, but I'm sure some people out there make that distinction.
---
I'll try not to have too many people who need the same type of gear as me though haha.
---
That is just awesome
---
Hunter Warrior Paladin
---
\-- or --
---
Hunter Warlock Paladin
---
Hands down.
---
Is that why we had servers that were "Locked" "Low" "Medium" and "High" in vanilla/TBC/Wrath?
---
The weird guy that rps in dungeons and while pvp.. but still a decent tank though.
---
Can you please stop posting these twitch clips.. no one cares m8.
---
People will just group together on certain "unofficial" German servers etc. I don't see it being a problem either way. 
---
I guess it's bad for the few clueless people that end up rolling on the wrong server and don't realize till later on. But none of us care about those people. We are all trolling a Reddit 2 months out from launch.
---
Now you have resorted to lies.  sad and pathetic.  It's like you are addicted to cheating, and you will resort to saying anything.
---
Yes that's exactly what was admitted. You're so smart dude!!!!
---
I've got 2 weeks off to take my time and rush at same time with my main.
---
Then spend the rest of my life leveling every other class up :)
---
It's so brave and original. One of it's kind.
---
I'm not asking for instant gratification.  And I don't play retail because it's not fun.  I just don't want us to add mechanics that inconvenience the average player.  And if you the thought is that the average player has more than 2+ hours a day to play the game...I think we need to look outside the small minority that is this reddit bubble.
---
Not sure if I agree with you. Vanilla is all about the community and the knowledge about the people on the server. I want feel fear when I see the most notorious gankers on the realm... that’s part of the game. If they decide to kill me and other lowbies in STV for hours, that’s tough for us. I don’t want to get saved by playing in another layer.
---
Are those curtains that go around the desk?!
---
That’s the thing. I don’t want any of the functionality. I just want essentially the drop-down option for low level quest tracking brought in from TBC.
---
In vanilla , at least on my pvp server, i remember my guild planning attacks on horde raids,days in advance, that wanted to enter BRM , just to wipe them and remove all their buffs( most raids had onyxia, and zg buff, they didnt bother with DMT and songflower), same thing happened on a private server i played. Guess what, it was fun! No more changes, thats my opinion.
---
I'm kind of pissed about how fucked hunters pets are.  I really hope they fix it.  On the other hand player a warrior was smooth and sweat on the open stress test.  I'm still quite excited.
---
Let’s assume there’s no group XP hit in that scenario. Is it reasonable to believe that one person is going to find multiple individuals on their realm, but on different layers, who will all get online at the same time, to let one player layer hop and AoE farm?
---
On proper pserver this doesn't happen. It's literally just 1 rly shitty pserver that was experimenting with dynamic respawns where this happened. 
---
But yes layering will probably be exploited by aoe farming mgaes.
---
Heh, now I feel like a douche. Sorry if I seemed harsh, but the general sentiment back in the day was that people on that realm weren't too good at the game. I hope the image has changed, since it's been quite a while.
---
Best wishes from Burning Legion!
---
😂 maybe we will be!
---
Why are we comparing LFR with anything in classic? there is nothing analogous. If you are going to compare reward and difficulty from classic to live, dont be a pussy and choose the easiest difficulty on live as equal to the only difficulty on classic thats a false equivalency.
---
If you arent playing mythic raids (if you raid at all, but if you dont raid why are you still playing retail?) on live, youre not really a raider. By virtue of one difficulty, all vanilla group pve content is "hardmode" since there isnt an easy mode.
---
Lmao this is a piece of art
---
I'm not sure what that means if I'm being honest.
---
Burn them all
---
Current plan is to keep it until the Dire Maul patch, I think. Which means this shit is in for months, at minimum.
---
But is clearly noticeable tho? wyta
---
Nope, even the most casual guilds will be forced to do it.
---
I did read it.. I also looked at the picture.. it is more than you think it is and I must reiterate. You need to learn to read. Yes it changes the classic experience. Again please make sure you read what I say.
---
Monsters vs players don't have the same leeway mechanic as players.  They have their own internal 'leeway' which is really just the fact that you're seeing the monsters "in the past" w/r to where they are on the server.  It's the same as as it was.
---
The leeway mechanic is for client vs client, or client vs AI.  It's compensation for your velocity vs the origin of your melee attack.
---
&gt; since 2005-2013
---
What is a target market? If Classic appeals to anyone it is someone in that 100 million people pool. They only need to get the interest of 2% of that. It doesn't have to be the same, I never said it would. It can actually be much less hyped this time around and still be a success and a contender to current WoW. But Blizzard seems to think we still don't really want it, and is it surprising? That same d bag is now the President.
---
Innaccurate
---
English player : "Hey, do you want to play with me?"
---
French player who can perfectly speak english : "I don't speak english"
---
Source : I'm french
---
Mate nowadays most people speak native plus english (And in a much more hiher rate in online games), I see more problem for English speakers, than for any other, as they just manage one language.
---
Healing examples with down rank mana efficiency?
---
&gt; weird he doesn’t like it when someone does it to him. 
---
He laughed it off. He was more bothered that he could use layering to avoid more ganks than the gank itself.
---
People like you are not the problem, it's the people who can't or for some fucked up reason *won't* talk english even if they know it. It's people who will be swamping servers in ridiculous display of tribalism and nationalism; shunning everyone else, or taking up space on the server being complete non factors to the larger community.
---
Ah, then no I don't think such an addon exists.
---
Why exactly are we doing this again? Was'nt this already done once before?(layering)
---
Where is this money supposed to come from?(trolling)
---
What will these welfare handouts lead to?(still trolling)
---
Wouldn't it just be cheaper to tare down the buildings that the whiny liberal black guy was going on about and rebuild them with cheap labor or better yet state prisoners?(still trolling)
---
Why is it that Corey Booker has to perpetuate this reparations gig to pander to a target demographic voting crowd?(trolling) Is Bidens ghetto card gold from being obama's VP (where Bookers isnt like bronze like Bernies)?(still trolling)
---
Reparations is like layering its only for a specific targeted demographic. If you are paying for something like WoW at 15$ a month you will play it you will make it past lvl 10 and stick at it for a few months just like someone on unemployment(been there done that).
---
No, I'm worried about Blizzard not letting people transfer for an extended period of time. If they are on the ball about server transfers then the problem could maybe be mitigated. But expecting Blizzard to ever be "on the ball" with anything is a surefire route to disappointment. I'm not saying the problem is impossible to mitigate and that the only solution is streamer genocide, but OP's original post wasn't about mitigation, it was arguing that the inherent downsides of having a streamer on your server are blown out of proportion, to which I disagree if he concedes that the only solution is to literally server transfer to solve the problems I've laid out for him.
---
Uhm, excuse me where did the bugreport thread go?
---
I wish people would stop defending Blizzard's bullshit with their "bUT iTs jUsT beta! !1!!1" argument
---
I also wish Blizzard actually gave a fuck about the game, as they obviously expect it to fail
---
OP er sikkert fra Askøy
---
I don't mean it how many might take it, but dude, play retail or a single player RPG. Catering to everyone on every schedule is the reason retail sucks, instant gratification gets old very quickly when people play for more than short spurts.
---
Classic is for a relatively niche group, there are **hundreds** of games you can play for a couple hours here and there and have meaningful progression... ya know?
---
I know it sounds condescending, but this is *the* game a lot of people have been waiting for. Asking to change it to cater to "more" is like re-painting Starry Night for people that prefer red over blue.
---
How the fuck are you calling my guild's Vanilla experience a lie? You know nothing about me.
---
And vanilla was still a success despite your issue with world buffs.
---
What do you think it does then?
---
Layers are continent sized, so server size = layer size x2.
---
Because the plan isn't to have 3k-4.5k people per realm, but 20k.
---
ive played it on stress test. i know exactly how it works.
---
L O L
---
It's going to be exactly the same. It's all about faction contribution points and your personal standing each week.
---
You must not have a phone if you don’t know about the hot new title Diablo Immortal
---
Consider buying a good wand and use it to supplement your DPS. It makes a big difference in terms of mana conservation.
---
It is blizzard so you really have to push them if you want a quality product.
---
See I disagree because from the open English will be the primary language. Even more so with no dedicated French or german servers - how do French and german communicate: English. You’ll have the largest groups speaking English and a massively reduced chance of the unofficial servers you speak of (which I remember although were few and far between)
---
Sacrifices had to be made. We can only have two stickies, and the bug report thread had slowed down to near non-use.
---
My first character will be a mage. I'll park myself in the Night Elf starting area and port groups to Stormwind for free.
---
Free realm transfers happened in vanilla
---
Is this literally a "think of the children" argument?
---
The fact is most europeans who play online games are fine speaking english. Creating "german only" servers is a bad idea because germans who already play WoW probably have a bunch of non-german friends they want to play WoW with. Language exclusive servers for western europe wouldn't see much use because they're limiting. Most people would just flood the english servers so they can play with their swiss and greek friends anyway.
---
Anyone with the add-on can queue for a group and join just like the one on retail. And yes it says that in the op. Which again changes the classic experience. Like I said learn to read.
---
Lol what? Do you see me asking for a change?  The guys is talking about adding in a 20 min window where I can't party up with friends.  How is that part of #nochanges.
---
And gtfo with this gatekeeping bullshit.  You don't have to be a no-lifer to make meaningful progression in this game.  2 hours a day should be PLENTY of time to enjoy the game and progress.
---
Maybe this is relevant, maybe it's not, but for some reason they're linked in my brain.
---
Blizzard's gotten a lot of flak for the "You think you want it, but you don't" thing from the same people who seem to that that's somehow a new development.  A huge amount of what made early WoW great was exactly this same mentality - I'm trying to remember the blue post that I read it in back then, but I distinctly remember one saying in effect "yes we read your feedback, but then we do what we want because we know game design better than you."
---
Almost all the changes that people rail about now in WoW are the results of Blizzard giving in to what the community was yelling for and they have seriously damaged in particular the social and RP aspects of the game that made it so appealing for so many people.  
---
I for one hope that they read community feedback - and then still just do what they think is right to do.  Because you know what? The community - at least the ones yelling the loudest - really don't know what they want on any sort of sustained trajectory.  I hope they either succeed gloriously or crash and burn terribly - but do either with conviction in their own design choices.
---
That's my two cents anyways...
---
That seems reasonable
---
&gt;when 4 lvl 60 horde showed up and just ganked us unprovoked. 
---
I'm guessing that was those Chinese player's alts.
---
I know you are a liar and a cheater.  I know that you would do or say anything to keep cheating.
---
&gt; ive played it on stress test. i know exactly how it works.
---
Vanishing into thin air every time I get sent to a new layer.
---
I remember needing resist gear to stand in it. Guess we're all wrong ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Seconded.
---
Guys Blizz has already said this'll be for like 2 weeks.
---
If you don't plan on playing after 2 weeks what are you even doing in this forum?
---
That's not really what megathreads are for. They are clearly important topics to people. Megathreads are meant for recent events (such as announcements) where people keep making threads about the exact same thing, and it is drowning out other discussions.
---
People are pointing out brand new ways to exploit layering every day, and it is important these issues are brought to light. A megathread about language locked servers would make way more sense than layering.
---
Wait a second.
---
I'm failing to see any confirmation he switched layers.
---
Yes he joined a group. But nothing phased out, nothing changed. The ganker could have, you know... left?
---
I mean, same here? I'm just saying that if they had made a scarlet crusade raid after naxx, the event in Human Stratholme made a lot of sense as a lead up to TBC. lol
---
What is the difference between sharding and layering?
---
4 hours is really not that bad considering 2 hours is a semi-fast time with uncontested monster/quests. I think it is around 1h20 for the fastest.   
---
The big issue is that I want to make a priest and I will need linen cloth to make my wand asap and as I get to lvl10.
---
**Hey guys new hat**
---
Wait until you see vods of people endlessly mining one node by swapping between layers. Players have tested the system, found out what layer they are on and can not exploit the shit out of arena chests, mining, herbing, rare spawns, etc. Just like sharding...
---
So what you're saying is I'm in the wrong for not listening to what people say on the internet? Kind of a dumb statement to make.
---
I watched a video, I read more about the topic, and I see the issues that arise with layering. I fail to understand how that is "sad".
---
I didn't go "lolz layering is fine scrubs" or "don't like layering then don't play kek". 
---
I simply stated that clip was evidence enough to convince me on the harm of layering instead of listening to the QQ of some random person on Reddit.
---
As I understand it, melee leeway was a solution to people's horrible internet. Lag could have made melee basically unplayable for too many people. This isn't a general problem these days, so it doesn't really make as much sense, assuming I'm correct.
---
No reason to preserve something like that which would ultimately alter the experience anyway.
---
\*before phase 2. which means it could be in the game for months, not the 'first couple weeks.
---
&gt; A huge portion of the initial population are going to be active retail players, or people who only played WoW after WOTLK lets say. 
---
The problem is how big will be that portion? Blizzard thinks it will be 90%, which implies a very small number of returning players, around 300k or so.
---
I don't think that 90% of the Classic initial population will be Retail players. I think it will be way less than 50%, because I believe that Blizzard is off by a factor of 10 (at least), and there will be more than 3 million players returning (probably more than 5 million) and that already puts Retailers in the minority.
---
If you think otherwise, is your opinion, but pretty much everyone expects millions to return...while Blizzard expects less than 300k.
---
Yes, most people won’t be able to do it. However, an organized guild could easily identify who’s on different layers and could use an addon to quickly invite one another to swap between them. Or a mass multiboxer could have an even easier time figuring out which of its characters are on different layers and just use macros to quickly hop layers.
---
Idk it seemed fine when they were battling in arathi highlands and there was def. over 100 people
---
In some sense yeah, it'll be exactly like films.  The Transformers movies are highly successful, yet everyone seems to think they're really bad.  And the films people agree are really good are often not the hits.   Blizzard ultimately only cares about the income, so all we really know is their bean counters decided it was worth the investment to get however many subs to return.
---
I personally suspect WoW classic will be modestly more popular than Blizzard expects.  Some people in this thread are a little extreme in the "it will be so big" direction.
---
I’m sorry but streamers aren’t anybody’s voice but their own. Just because they are in the beta doesn’t mean they need to report what the community wants  to blizzard.
---
Ow this hurts the nerdy middle age women part of my otherwise mid-20 male mind.
---
Yeah classic had none of that crap.
---
Everybody is constantly ranting about how "LOOL pserver bug gfto" but on this one thing they want to replicate them? Why?
---
Are we asking for a WoW Brexit?

Its not just like retail since nothing is automated.
---
If i have the addon it just lets me see what has already been posted in chat in one screen. The buttons are only whispers or requests sent to other players

Why don't they just, like, do that? What's wrong with sharding the start zones?

Jerking off while doing business? Admirable commitment.

Classic is not live yet.

What live logins are you talking about?

As I said, Blizzard have ZERO statistics about Classic.

i just dont understand why they want to undermine their fucking product at every step of the way.

first it was the number of phases, and now this.

imagine speedleveling on the first week and getting to 60 and then when you start playing everyone starts speaking fucking italian and i have to relevel.

Oh no, Sodapoppin isn't being ganked 24/7. Game ruined.

Everything is woods here!  I just hate that I'm an hour away from Lake Michigan, unless I want to go to Traverse then I'm only half an hour out from the water, but I don't count the bays, if I want to go to the lake proper I need to go to Pyramid Point or something.

Retail meme with retail models stolen from facebook where someone stole it from r/wow. Pretty meta, 10/10

This is a lazy response, they were given special priveledge to all join the beta at a priority level, they have thousands of live followers. They're a voice for us whether you like it or not.

did you even watch the clip? because hes laughing
---
nice jumping on the streamer bandwagon tho you fit right into the sub
---
Also time zones. It was funny on private servers because the middle of the night is exactly when the server was busiest (because China). When Classic comes out, I'll be getting up a 3:00am for a month and playing a few hours each day then when it won't be so packed.
---
It was posted on  this sub earlier
---
Man I still listen yo a couple of the bands you listed. I actually really liked the most recent At The Drive-In record - it took a while to grow on me, but I dig it.
---
I’d be a healer or even a tank. Those will probably be your best bet to make sure you get into raids when you can join them.

I think they said that Dire Maul would come out faster than it did originally which is under 3 months in that case. The overwhelming majority of the playerbase won't even be 60 by then.
---
This is what happens when you let finance people dictate game design.
---
If they lost translation data something like that, just name the servers eg. BladefistFR so ppl can route correctly, so we don’t depend on 3rd party realm organizing sites.
---
It's not automated in retail unless you select that option.. additionally he said in the op "just like in retail" again.. LEARN TO READ
---
Fail
---
Neither of those classes have much synergy between specs though. Warlocks would do a bit more damage in PvE and be pretty much the same when getting trained in PvP.
---
Look to hunters or rogues if you want a class that completely breaks this concept, allowing massive DPS, defensive mechanisms and control.
---
Mages might be a bit strong too with very respectable synergy between specs.
---
People offer a lot of solutions. Like choosing a layer and being blocked to that layer or only being able to change a layer while you are in a city/inn, to name a few.
---
&gt; significant statistics. 
---
What are those statistics, if Classic is not live yet, and there isn't any other old MMORPG comparable to Classic WoW to get data from?
---
There are simply NO statistics for Classic. Beta is not a statistic. Private servers are not a statistic. Twitch numbers are not a statistic. r/classicwow numbers are not a statistic.
---
So...WHICH "significant statistics" are you talking about?

While we are discussing this - I pulled out my sap macro that sapped the nearest targetable item. For some reason, it doesn’t work. I don’t know if it’s the private server but I was trying to figure out why my bc to cata macro will send chat spam instead of actually using my sap.

Any input or recommendations by anyone to fix my macro? I can’t supply the macro since I am nowhere near my pc.

Sperg comment, gatekeeping classic, really?
---
The game was initially designed for a casual audience. 2h/d is enough to make meaningful progress, if you think you can't then you're clearly not understanding the game.
---
Most private server data and polls indicate that Hunter is only like 4th most popular, certainly not one of the most played.

Welcome to most gaming subs.
---
It came out with 4.0.1.
---
So your friend invites you to a group but you won't be able to see each other until you go to an inn? Sounds like a nightmare system that will confuse everyone.
---
The man with bags.
---
I plan on leveling tailoring as fast as possible so I can start making mooncloth for the bottomless bag. I also plan on giving out bags in the lower levels while I'm leveling.

Hey bro. Hey.

I see it can ignore spells, but does this show you what you should skip to save $$$ on your way to your first mount?
---
At a certain point even a dream job turns into one where you clock in and clock out.  I doubt they give a fuck one way or the other what gamers think.
---
as a high schooler with an hour or two a day to play (played all the sports in highschool) i got to 60 in like almost a year of actual time, and something like 8.5 days played.(majority of which were in the summer, i no-lifed hard for a week or two at a time)
---
the main thing people aren't taking into consideration, is that its difficult to get to 60 on a -FRESH- server, because there's no greens to buy on the AH to help you level faster, there may or may not be people available to do dungeons with for those juicy dungeon quests, and no dungeons = no blue gear to help speed you along leveling.
---
some classes dont care as much about gear obv, but for rogues/war/sham/pld, getting a level appropriate blue weapon can cut hours off of your total played to 60
---
&gt; Everyone I knew hated long AV matches, so all my vanilla memories were apparently implanted or something.
---
God, this so much.  AV was fun at first, but in the end *every single person* I knew just bitched and bitched and bitched the whole time in almost every AV I ever did.  Bitching about a failed push, bitching about how long its taking, everybody is a noob, ect.  Then years later everybody goes on and on and on about how "glorious" it was.
---
I mean, I like AV and all, but there were a ton of people that did not like it back in the day, but people generally seem to act like everybody just love love loved it or they didn't play vanilla.
---
Whoever commented here first, you're shadowbanned.
---
You've never gone to a friends house and hang out and talk awhile he plays a single player game. Shooting the breeze. That's twitch. A bunch of people watching some game and talking. I mean why watch sports or reality TV while you're at it? 
---
It's a simple concept, just a different media. Hanging out with people.
---
You call it retail because that’s what you’ve heard other people call it.
---
Damn, they dont have mich time to fix this either
---
In portugal?
---
It's fine, people will still play. Classic is not in any danger.
---
Second account, use throwaway level 1s to swap layers at will.
---
Yeah, I've watched a bunch since making my first comment. Like I said I didn't really pay attention to the uproar at first. A lot of people here feel very strongly about a lot of things so I figured it was just people blowing this out of proportion for no reason. It's the internet after all lol.
---
After watching some videos and reading more this layering thing is a huge deal and can really lead to major issues if Blizzard doesn't handle it right.
---
I can understand them not wanting too invest in bring more hardware online than there is a demand for so I kind of get why they are going with layering. I just hope they stick to what they say and remove it after what 4 weeks they said?
---
But where did you read this?
---
my computer was so shit back then. I don't remember shit about classic other than loving it and having like 200 /played days at one point. What I do remember is begging my parents for more RAM at the age of 13 not knowing wtf it even really was, but knowing that I fucking *needed it.*
---
When I visited Copenhagen It felt like visiting just another city in the Uk, except everyone is better looking lol.
---
&gt;but this means server queues - also, that no one wants, as it will kill classic before it even starts.
---
Server queues have been part of multiple releases of many games and expansions and never killed a game before.
---
The real killer of games is when something is bad about the game experience itself... Like immersion breaking layering issues.
---
0. Hopefully I will pick a class by release.
---
0.(2). Hopefully I will stick to my choice.
---
1. I will make the character.
---
2. Hopefully I will stick to the character.
---
(Bonus). Will pray not to end an altoholic as I just get burned out after redoing the 1-30 on a few characters and lose the will to play.
---
Maybe they're busy playing the game?  Maybe they don't care enough that other people don't like how they choose to play the game?
---
They could waste their time, but why should they?  They won't change anyone's mind.  The "STREAMERS BAD!" people will never change their mind, just post endlessly that streamers are the devil and everyone who follows them are mindless idiots and trolls.
---
Yes, please do.  The top guilds want 40 people + world buffs to get the fastest clear times.  The casual guilds need 40 people just to clear the content world buffs or not.
---
Where did the bad man touch you?!?!
---
r/doublewoosh
---
Niches don't work that way. The market is simply larger now, so less things grab the whole thing, but the amount of people in a given niche will be about the same, or, more likely, bigger, because gaming is overall more accepted. It's much easier for me to randomly get someone into VWoW right now than it was 15 years ago. People do not magically just 180 their personalities. That count of people didn't go anywhere.
---
There are always going to be people with a slower disposition, faster disposition, less social, more social, less competitive, more competitive. The old school MMO niche is currently unfilled. Those who like it are not going to just go play Fortnite instead. It's just not at all an easy niche to work in and most companies don't want to bother. It's not even the only dormant niche. Sometimes I just see something explode 5 years later when a company accidentally stumbles into it.
---
When a company can make a lot more money with some F2P mobile crap they lose sight of things. It's not really about sub numbers anymore **for them**. It's about whales and questionable business practices. It doesn't mean the previous thing that made them successful is no longer viable, or that those higher sub numbers are not possible. They're just not measuring that anymore, they're measuring profit, and that's not directly related to sub numbers.
---
&gt; Blizzard isn't betting Classic is going to fail, they wouldn't make it if they thought that.
---
Businesses can have very strange motives, actually. I could absolutely see them making a move specifically to kill PServers, and make a claim that this genre is not popular. Not to mention, businesses have acted irrationally plently of times. Just look at Anthem.
---
That's because the announcement for a lack of enough servers for even a single German realm definitely means there won't be any RP-PVP servers.
---
because we're poor af thx putin :D No brainer here

&gt; "people on reddit are retarded."
---
Um... Yeah...  Look at the topics that keep popping up to bash him, people who watch him, and people who play with him.  You'd have to be a saint not to have a negative attitude toward a forum that seems to encourage that kind of stuff.  There's more comments on posts about streamers to talk about how awful they are than there are about the game that people are supposedly excited for, making me think this isn't a subreddit for discussing WoW Classic, it's a subreddit for bashing streamers.
---
Ok then. What's your solution?
---
No, you will have to make those decisions yourself.  With Class Trainer Plus installed, it's easy to hide trainer abilities to save that copper
---
Eh lake Michigan gets too busy. The beaches down near Indiana are awful overcrowded most days.

You only need to pay an extra $15 for the one month in which you level your mage.
---
Treasure Planet, I think. I may have my dates mixed up, but they specifically sabotaged that project in a number of ways. That was also the love child of one of their most prominent artists.
---
There’s a bunch of great YouTube videos about it.
---
Realistically if layering wasnt implemented we might see severe lag in that area which just sucks overall.
---
Indeed
---
Gib invite zum Deutschen layer, bitte.
---
Assuming this is a genuine question, sharding creates multiple copies of the same zone or sub-zone through which players can phase in and out of.
---
Layering uses the same technology to create multiple copies of the same continent/world.  The system is supposed to add them or destroy them based on population, with the estimate being each shard holding 2-3k players.
---
What are they going to say? Hey we're looking into this? I don't really want an answer until they have a fix ready to go, otherwise we just repeat the endless cycle of 'layer haters' flaming everyone on this sub who just wants to see the system fixed.
---
No, nobody should pick herb or alc. Because I am, and I don’t want competition on my herbs.
---
This is not specific to macros, this is just a concept for high end healing. It's not that the rank of spells themselves are more efficient, but how +healing works with them. The bonus depends on the cast speed of the spell. Rank 4 and Rank 9 of Healing Touch have mostly the same heal per mana. However, they have the same cast speed and get the same bonus from gear. Over a long time, you can cast more Rank 4 heals and therefore more total healing for the same mana.
---
I’m sure he was laughing but give it another 20-30 min and he wouldn’t have been laughing....
---
how do you know what layer your throwaway level 1 is in because your not in the same area as your main ?
---
Cat durid is for fite.
---
Well the retail team has been crap since WoD and I think they know it.
---
&gt;What if Square just said fuck it, learn **Mandarin** for final Fantasy xiv or don't play.

---
That sounds horrible.
---
um blizzard has already stated layering will be around till DM, so that means at least a few months.......
---
Was rp-pvp ever a heated topic, even at the announcement?
---
Also, if language isn't enforced on an rp server (pve or pvp), there's no point starting a character there on the first place.
---
If they're leveling up the whole way together, then technically it's a net positive, since the other person likely wouldn't have been able to keep up if they were solo.
---
It's fine. It'll be like less than 1% of the population who will actually exploit the system for the short time it's active. The trade-off is having servers not die once the tourists leave, it's a good trade.
---
People complained (righteously so IMO).  So they came up with a "compromise" which turns out to be worse.
---
Switzerland is a special case anyway. Almost everybody learns english, german &amp; french there with lots of people learning 1-2 more languages, mostly italian and spanish.

And how do you know it will be different when the real realms are up? You are just guessing. The only thing we know for certain is that 6-7 or more layers exist at the moment. Since the developers refuse to give us any information, nothing suggests that it will be any different on August 27.

Game development is a notoriously thankless industry. Like many operations and development jobs, it's often passionate people putting their best effort into the world while remaining beholden to the whims and interests of executives and shareholders, and taking the flak for the games' shortcomings.
---
I truly don't understand the vitrol for developers in here sometimes. You've got to realize they probably *love* the first iteration of WoW. It wouldn't be a surprise to learn that the majority of them played it themselves. If you're passionate about something, you typically don't hold resentment towards your kinhood because that's not how passions spread and grow.
---
&gt; Megathreads are meant for recent events (such as announcements) where people keep making threads about the exact same thing, and it is drowning out other discussions.
---
Sounds like megathreads would be perfect for the topics of layering and streamers then.
---
That angle on that left secondary screen LMFAO 😂😂😂
---
That's the one!
---
1. World buffs does not make content easier. World buffs DISAPPEAR on death. You cannot just fully world buff up and then except to kill bosses first attempt without knowing them. Mechanics wipes you not gear checks, and no amount of world buffing will allow you to skip mechanics. That's why world buffs are used to FARM content, not to progress it. It can be used if you have done lots of attempts on a boss and just need some extra power to kill it, just like it was intended  
---
&gt; He said they were designed to help people who couldn't kill the content get an extra push to kill content 
---
2. But it does not help trivialize content like you are describing. It trivializes farm content and makes it faster, but that's content that is on FARM, that means you can already clear it, world buffs just helps you do it faster.That's why I want world buffs, to farm content fast that I've already cleared a hundred times. Additionally it provides new challenging gameplay, to clear the raids without dying, and to speedrun the content incredibly fast.
---
It doesn't matter. You keep rolling the dice until you log one on that gets you to a layer where your spot is empty.
---
Leeway wasn't in Vanilla. Watch any old pvp video if you need proof. Leeway was added in Cata.
---
Excellent question, one I would like to see answered as well. The current guild bank system as it is in retail is one of the things I will miss.
---
I stand corrected, I must have been walking up and leaving my pets with the stay command.
---
Handing out wands in Goldshire.
---
My son is 16 months. Excited to share classic with him.
---
I mean, if it is true, occurrences like that are inevitable at some point. Maybe it's a healthy wakeup call, IF BFA Devs even care about Classic. Either way our Sub pays for Both now, and Blizz is winning by appealing to Casual and Non-Casual.
---
When did they add a hipster pack for Night Elves?
---
Death to the Horde scum!!!
---
Jk. Happy to hear everyone’s loving classic..
---
**except for meeeeee**
---
ahhh i see what you're saying. there does always seem to be some lag on these things, and communities as big as this can reach critical mass well before then.
---
it just struck me how much work blizzard is putting in towards the expectation that people are going to quit partway through playing their game (for whatever reason) and it kind of bummed me out. like everything up until this point has been one big eye-roll from blizzard. i think i just lost my faith that blizzard wants this game to be fun for us, replaced with the idea that blizz is just doing the bare minimum to justify requiring a subscription from someone. i think i need a break from reddit.
---
sorry for the tangent.
---
Why don't they just label servers for the country next to the name. Seems rather easy for me. I had to deal with the large french population speaking french on Zuljin back in the day. This is something I don't want to experience again. Nothing against them I just like to know and understand the language on my server I choose.
---
It's literally the most antithetical move they can make and they are doing it.
---
YOU HAD ONE JOB BLIZZARD.
---
Fucking facepalm...
---
They killed the Chinese party as well.
---
I'm in the classic beta and can confirm that @mouseover without switching targets works.
---
How do people keep their desks so clean? I always have to dig around for 5 minutes just to find a pen. ^^
---
Right there with you. I really dislike the bugs and would obviously like to see them fixed before launch, but if the choice is a handful of top end try hards abusing the system or everyone waiting hours to log on and even longer to complete quests, give me the first one any day.
---
Frenchies have had a thorn in their side for a while about this subject. They cannot get over the fact that British won the cultural struggle and it isn't French that's *lingua franca*.
---
Instead of adapting, they dig in their heels like they didn't in 1939 and make out french language to be some bizzare expression of nationalistic pride in gaming.
---
&gt;level 2shapookya18 points · 5 hours agoit's ridiculous to think that retail WoW is big enough to have 70+ German servers but Classic won't be big enough for one or two.ReplyGive AwardsharereportSave
---
this is not true, it has been confirmed on the german forums, that there WILL be customer support in each european language available.
---
Yes, Blizzard wanted to give Alliance Blood Elves, so they created a race out of thin air to do that. They have almost 0 lore
---
Do you realise that some guilds will down ragg within the first week. Within 2 weeks the most hard core guilds will have abused layering to have farned every black lotus and arcane crystal they will need until tbc.
---
You are underestimating how autistic private server players are and how much this will impact the economy and pvp when an entrie guild has tidal charm the first week.
---
so you spend 10 minutes trying to switch between the handful of layers there are and in that time you've wasted time because the key farming spots are almost certainly gonna be hot.
---
Right? Where can I send my wife and kid? Classic is my new family.

Lok'tar Ogar!
---
The point is that you're entirely wrong. What you tried to write is so irrelevant.
---
Your issue was before I even mentioned my credentials. 
---
It does validate my opinion more - I understand the game better than 99.99% of players.
---
&gt;You act like a complete spastic
---
Funny, coming from the guy who almost cried because I suggested they add arena. 
---
&gt;Also if you like Arena that much go play retail. You seem to like it anyway with all your top 200 raiding supersperg bullshit.
---
I don't even like arena that much, I was just good at it - Same with Retail raiding. I raid 2/3 times a week when I play it.
---
Classic won't last very long if its just a complete re-release. There are plenty of places you can play exactly that.
---
Post Naxx the game will change, get over it now because it sounds like you'll probably kill yourself when it inevitably does. 
---
BTW, classic is already shaping up to be less blizz-like than many 'naughty-servers' out there. The fundamental combat mechanics &amp; interactions are inherently different - That of 7.3.5...
---
You cannot change trinkets in combat. If you are outside of combat you can, if it's an active trinket then there's a 30sec CD before you can use the active.
---
A trivial amount of people will cancel their subs over this. Retail is their main game and will continue to be.
---
How much was it to print this at this size or order it? This is awesome and want it for my office space as well
---
Dungeons in Vanilla stayed prominent only because of Vanillas incredibly linear progression. Unless you had a guild that had content on farm and they wanted to bring you up to scratch, you had to run dungeons for pre BiS, so you could transition into raids. Despite some fringe cases and so e rare drops, a person clearing AQ40 wouldn't have any reason to step foot in ZF, let alone Stratholme (unless he wanted the charger). There were a few dungeons that were required for crafting, but folks weren't running those for flavor.
---
After your initial gear up, dungeons were dead content. If you ran them on an alt you blitzed through it, which is what most people tried to do in Vanilla.
---
They made them repeatable with a Diablo like spin to make sure the investment they made wasn't just ignored after six weeks into an expansion. And it struck gold. Speed was a focus, but the competitive side didn't come about till well after the fact.
---
Iirc, most meaningful dungeons will consume that entire 2 hour window.
---
Add in farming, questing, banking, auction house use, alts, leveling professions, travel time, general exploration, and possibly any iteration of pvp..
---
Well you see where I'm going with this.
---
If you went to a small town then it's normal that people didn't speak english sadly. 
---
It's not that in paris people don't speak english, it's just that in Paris people are just full of themself and sometimes just flat out refuse to speak in english. (that and because us french are usually ashamed of our broken accents). 
---
Usually, in tourist area with young adult it's fine but if the tenant or the waiters aren't young, most of the time they will not be able to hold a conversation or just understand you in english, especially if you have an accent different than common american accent
---
Just put limits on what the guild bank can contain. You don't need copper in there, you just need items that drop in raids and end-game consumables. There's no reason the bank officer should have to sort through a bunch of shit people think might be useful for some other player. Just make them sell it on the AH themselves.
---
In any case, with how prevalent account sharing was between guild officers because of the lack of Guild Banks. I really do think Blizzard intends to include them sometime around ZG/AQ. They just have no reason to tell anyone that right now.
---
By in this point of the game, you mean the fucking beta?
---
Alliance is the faction for kids. Not allowed to roll horde until you’re atleast 25
---
People on this sub really don't understand what the word "temporary" means.
---
Yes, yes, no.
---
I can't wait for Classic!
---
I'm more worried about the Pop Vinyls just sitting out of there boxes :0
---
This isn't worse if it isn't enabled by the time you get to pvp areas.
---
[Oh no...](https://imgflip.com/i/340gll)

OMG. In 2005ish I death ran as a lvl 15ish NE to all the major cities to get those glowy shoulders/crown.
---
What bosses die in 30 seconds?
---
I agree, I wasn't in favour of layering from the start because it was quite obvious exactly what we see would happen. But I and others with the same opinion were always waved away by reddit just because of the Popular Opinion of the day.
---
Struck gold? My friend, retail has 1.5m subs at the moment.. less than its ever had, and less than half of what vanilla reached just a few months after launch.
---
What about the person who makes a post dictating how the community should behave and labels it as a public service announcement?
---
Just over 4 hours? Incredible, just incredible speed.
---
Classic is actually perfectly suited for casual players.
---
It's easy, you can look everything up if you want, your progress doesn't get deleted by an expansion.
---
Yeah, it's grindier then bfa, but that also helps with motivation, at least for me.
---
well I certainly hope you're right..
---
Honestly man, I've seen a lot of your comments on this sub and you have a tendency to exaggerate, no offense. I'm not really sure how or why you're saying Blizzard expects less than 300k returning players. It's very much the opposite of that, that's why they are doing layering, because they know that ton's of people are going to be playing it.
---
I do think you're wrong in assuming that Classic is going to bring back, long term, millions and millions of players who haven't played WoW in years (either retail or private servers). There will be some hype, but most of those players are older now, and don't have the same time to commit, and if they do try it out, most likely won't keep with it. 
---
Again, it's anecdotal, but so far the only old WoW buddies I have heard talk about playing Classic are people who also have had recently active subs. The ones who quit and never came back don't seem to have any interest. Not saying they don't exist, just that I'd be very surprised to see a bunch of people who haven't played WoW in 5-10+ years come back and play Classic long term.
---
And that is the issue, who is going to play long term. The initial launch numbers don't matter. What matters is who is playing 3+ months later, the stable population, and that is what Blizzard is preparing for.
---
There could easily be 5mil+ players, like you said, playing Classic over the 1st few weeks. But to assume that the majority of those players will keep playing Classic I think is a mistake. Like I said in another comment, it's better to be surprised by population growth than to be unprepared for population loss. Blizzard is protecting against the worse, and in my opinion, most likely, of those two scenarios.
---
Something is off with that one...
---
There's addons that can scan it for you I'm certain. 
---
But honestly there really shouldn't be that kind of random stuff in your bank. It should be preparation gear for new raid content, any consumes you might give out to tanks, some repair bots and whatever junk you get from raid that has to be AH'ed.
---
Thanks for the info.  230~ definitely is not worth it lol
---
Hahah class, mine prefer overwatch grrr.
---
&gt;Ur opinion is not worth more because you have wow accomplishments.
---
It very clearly does.
---
&gt;Funny how deluded ur brain is from playing wow that hard to thinking it has earned you some sort of superiority over others
---
I probably have less time played than you - I raided twice or three times a week depending on my guild and pretty much only played endgame content from TBC-Cata and then HFC in WoD -&gt; Early BFA where I quit.
---
It can, yes.  Mostly on trash.  Frostbite procs can freeze mobs the tank is trying to reposition.  If the tank is moving, frostbite might cause him to move out of range of the mob unexpectedly, in which case the mob will murder the thing highest on the threat list in range of it.  That probably means a dead DPS or healer.
---
Kinda reminds me of "IT"... ?
---
These two pictures are not connected. The spiraling staircase is from Sintra and the lake turret is not. Sintra is truly a fantastical, magical place. You will feel like you are in a zone made for adventure. It is more like BRD than BFD because it is a huge interconnected maze.  The spiral staircase goes into the mountain and has multiple entrances/exits. Halfway down you exit the beautiful stonework and traverse dry, dark, gritty tunnels and on the other side is a stone fort.
---
Nah iam aware that a big chunk of the people here are dumb as fuck and destroyed retail with it.
---
We cleared MC in vanilla for people's alts.  We pulled in people that needed the binding on the bosses that dropped them.  Most guilds will do something like that.
---
Grim Batol? Was resident during MoP and WoD, and while my guild had a good relationship with Tuga only guild below us, sometimes we instigated those trade chat skirmishes for the fun of it; or join them when already occuring.

" multinational servers will be good when people *try* to act their best with the common tongue, usually english"
---
"when people *try* to act their best with the common tongue"
---
"when people *try"*
---
There's the problem.
---
Anyone who understands computers/modern WoW was saying this is EXACTLY how layering would be when it was first announced, and there were so many fanboys denying it.
---
They have. It’s being removed after phase one or a few weeks. Wtf are you on about
---
Not if questing with two people is faster than AOE grinding with 2. 
---
Since questing with 2 people is faster than questing with 1, and AOE grinding with 2 people is slower than as 1. Id assume Questing with 2 &gt; AOEing with 2.
---
Except for loot trading, or more than four phases, or spell batching. When Blizzard said they’re listening to the community, it doesn’t mean they’ll do what we say, but they *are* listening.
---
Put Classic on a separate (and cheaper) subscription to retail. At least for the first few months.
---
That way, you only get people who actually want Classic, instead of being inundated by swarms of retail tourists.
---
Also, put in the language realms in EU.
---
War ja klar.. da redet mal einmal online mit nem deutschen schon sich in die hose machen wegen grammar.
---
New Zealand doesn't exist on Blizzard's world map. 
---
/r/MapsWithoutNZ/
---
This is the right answer. Especially in software, everyone just shits on your work, so nobody is ever passionate about their projects.
---
Cause this is a constant occurrence on live... and this happens on all other games...

Another great macro for druids is this (I'm using it on the beta):

/cast [stance:1] Dire Bear Form(Shapeshift)
---
/use [stance:0] Superior Healing Potion

/cast [nostance:1] !Dire Bear Form(Shapeshift)
---
As leaving form and using a potion are both off the global CD, this macro lets you instantly switch out of bear form and back, while chugging a potion in between. The switch is so fast, you don't even see it. Of course your rage will be gone, but it might still be worth it to take another stoneshield potion mid-combat, for example.
---
To do the same as a cat, use stance:3

It's odd that blizzard doesn't seem to be aware that language barriers are a real thing.  In live right now, NA servers can group up with those certain few servers (you know the ones) who have generally garnered a very negative reputation.  You see that server in the group finder and most people I play with all basically just decline them due to repeated negative experiences.  It's mainly just from they often don't speak english so when you try to communicate anything theres no response.  The few decent groups i've had from those servers (were talking like 2 or 3 good groups out of like 50 possible ones) was because they at least communicated on a basic level.  Its just so rare they mainly get insta-declined now, creates a pretty toxic atmosphere (heard countless times "ooo its one of those???" if they see them in the group).  This is a widely known thing in live.  Even preach has had videos of him doing m+ with a full russian team and he basically just has to hope they know what they're doing, since there's no communication.  Takes out the problem solving element of the game.
---
I'd hope they address this before launch.
---
It is content.  It might not be good content.  Or it might be.  All kind of subjective.  But it is content.
---
It's not really my cup of tea most of the time, but sometimes it's interesting to see someone else watch a video I've watched and see what their thoughts on the video are.
---
Ughhh. Mine will be on with me. I have a good job so its demanding. If i had a shit job id be like "hahaha what are you gonna do. Make me stop cleaning toilet for min wage so i can level"
---
Yeah that is a big issue then.
---
&gt; A lot of people here feel very strongly about a lot of things so I figured it was just people blowing this out of proportion for no reason. It's the internet after all lol.
---
Yeah nothing matters unless it's your opinion, right?  
---
You're the kind of douche who we were all having to fight uphill while we immediately saw the problems and you put your head in the sand because "it's the internet after all."
---
Of course he could sell it
---
Blizzard have stated in interview that realm transfers will not be available unless the playerbase demanded it at some point...oh wait. *Points at head*
---
I started playing in April 2005 and levelled three characters to 60 but only ever played two. My rogue was very much my main. He was the character I did my progression raiding on and all my farming. It was the character I completed T0.5 on which was quite a commitment. I took my priest on alt raids every week but rarely played her outside of that. Both toons had equally well developed professions which wasn’t saying much to be honest. 
---
My third 60 was abandoned. 
---
Speaking as someone who spent a lot of time playing while holding down a full time job, I think your assessment of one main and one active alt is reasonable.
---
As someone who still plays retail and who's been playing it since sharding was introduced, I seriously don't see any difference between sharding and layering. 
---
This shit in the clip, that's exactly what happens on retail. I fucking hate it. You're ganking someone, he runs into the world quest and enters the group. Boom he's gone. It's so stupid.
---
No they have said it’ll only be in for a few weeks. I’d be surprised if it’s there a month in
---
Actually yes. Hosting data and services in AU is more expensive than a lot of other places in the world, including the US.
---
Oh quit yer crying
---
I agree more with your second paragraph. It’s still beta, which means two things: there’s still a chance it can be improved before launch, and also, there’s a chance Blizzard changes their mind to assuage community concerns. 
---
It happened with loot trading, I can absolutely see a similar compromise being on the table. My hopes aren’t high, but that’s how I view it.
---
Thanks to this change I simply wont play classic.
---
Or I will play on American servers.
---
I am wholly uninterested in my trade chat being 30% French, 30% German, 35% English and 5% other languages. I'm wholly uninterested in having items linked in chat of another nationality so I have to press them to see what they're like. And before you reply with "if your client is English it will auto translate!" No. No it wont. When doing keys with people from France or Germany I see their native languages on their keys, their summoned pets etc. 
---
I get that Blizzard is an US company but this is simply an affront to the European playerbase. It will heavily reduce my enjoyability of the game and that of others.
---
Yes: [https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=360](https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=360)
---
6 minutes in:
---
&gt;We're going to continue that process over the first few weeks, until eventually we will collapse down, and **we promise we will do this a few weeks in, to a single world per realm, no sharding, none of that going forward.**
---
nods along sagely
---
Except it was.  Watch any old pvp video if you need proof.
---
As a regular player, I would log off for an hour. I'd rather not be frustrated while playing a game.
---
Hahahaaa
---
Yep... In Vanilla we had ours go to the MT, then the next went to a Fury warrior who was an OT.  I could see a 2nd or 3rd going to a rogue though.
---
Who are "the devs"?
---
Ideally you want only one game director. The rest are just coders, artists, animators, etc. they dgaf
---
Not a bad idea, although someone could still switch layers until they found one that didn't have anyone contesting the chest.
---

---
When you are getting Ad Hominem'd, you've won.
---
That wouldn't be a good test. Since the tank is in melee range, and the healer is not, the Hots aggro would need to exceed 130% of the tanks aggro to pull.
---
Not to mention all the mounting hardware to keep it from falling.
---
I think those posts are more important than Classic Meme #486425 since they're trying to fix serious problems.
---
Most swiss only speak two languages and forget the rest.
---
In literally the same sentence, he mentions turning it off before releasing world bosses. He hedged that one hard and carefully.
---
Nope I used to jump in there all the time.
---
Yes you should relax because it’s not permanent. They said for the first phase, but I feel like with the community speaking, they’ll do it for a couple weeks. And there’s only 15-20k people in the beta on 2 servers. When it’s released there’s going to be more people. You’ll see people running around. They’re just testing the layering, this doesn’t mean it’s the final product they’re going to release. Streamers are finding bugs and problems with it and I’m sure Blizzard will address it.
---
So yes. Relax. It’s not permanent. You won’t get put into your own layer all by yourself with nobody else, that’s not how it’s going to work. People will still see people running around, grouping up with quests, interacting and such.
---
So yes. Relax. Or re-fucking-lax. Pick your poison, but I highly advise one of the two. You’ll be fine just like everybody else when this game is released.
---
Found the italian guy.
---
&gt; The actual dps gain is about 0.5% crit in blue gear upto maybe 0.8% crit by the time you are in naxx gear, so it is quite small but not nothing. 
---
It doesn't scale with gear. It's 5% extra base intellect so the bonus stays the same regardless of your gear. It works out to about 2 extra DPS.
---
Can you link the hi res version? Can't find it
---
Well the only thing with that is if a rogue would be in pvp combat in a rested area he could vanish then instantly switch, is why I thought of the timer.
---
Frost is the most survivable, and most popular for that reason.
---
AP + PoM + Pyro is the "3 minute mage" spec.  You wreck people for 15 seconds, then wait for your cooldowns to come back.
---
Pure fire for pvp has crazy burst but is hard to survive for long with.  
---
Elemental mage is 24 fire and 27 frost, tries to mix some of the burst of fire with some of the survivability of frost.  You need high levels of gear for this to really work though, otherwise you'll be OOM all the time.
---
I mean you always have retail and can play that again ? You know the retail that people complained into absolute stupidity. Big portion of the people are just to dumb to realize that they are the issue and they are already repeating history but are to dense to understand that.
---
Like Burning Crusade had already daily quests with minigames 5 year olds play and those people still complained about it being to hard until were where we are.
---
Depends when you started in Vanilla. I’m not sure how early the Spanish shift was in the servers lifetime
---
So what?
---
No problem, and Happy Hunting out there. &lt;3
---
&gt; They don't ever offer one. Or if they do, it's asinine like you said. The people that are 100% against layering are the no-life neckbeards who have hours upon hours to sit in queue or grind quest mobs.
---
There's a super easy answer: if there are too many people in an area, go somewhere else.  
---
Grind-questing is the fastest leveling experience and it will get you to 60 in around 4-5 days of /played with a good route.  
---
Next comes pure grinding, which will get you to 60 in around 6-7 days of /played.  
---
Next is pure questing, which can be as fast as grinding with a good route or substantially (very substantially) slower with a bad route.  
---
Grindquesting and pure grinding are not that different in terms of speed. The problem is that you want Blizzard to cave in and ruin the servers to cater to the way you want to play, and you aren't taking the hint when everyone says to go back to retail.  
---
Go back to retail.
---
But isn't that a gigantic inconvenience?  So i'll have to go back to a city/inn to group with my friends?  The average player would be affected by that way more than they would every be affected by people abusing layers.
---
Let's be real, this is the channel system that we see in tons of other games. While other games allow you to pick the channel you are in, the game decides it for you in wow. Either get rid of it or allow people to change channels themself with industry standard restrictions (Out of combat and have a cool down on channel switching).
---
I would prefer no channel system at all, but at least make it more obvious than this bullshit Houdini disappearance act.
---
On beta you just ask in world chat for a group invite to get layered and get a couple very quickly, it's easy
---
"Yo, just quit your job bro. No big deal."
---
If the retail player base is any indication then a take over of 1 or 2 servers would probably succeed, if it's well coordinated and most germans would go to those servers.
---
Probably because there won't be enough servers to give every big faction one to begin with.
---
You are new to Blizzard betas I assume? You're in for a whole lot of nothing.
---
u/damnthesenames Glad to see you get your daily source of fiber with the husk pills! I felt right at home seeing them.
---
Absolutely point for point perfect for both, no.
---
Closest is Holy paladin which only only swap a few minor points.
---
First off, loved your classic mage rundown. Now, I mained a mage all those years ago through vanilla and tbc. I never really got very far as I was the biggest noob and didn't have as much free time as I would have liked. 
---
I was thinking that I shouldn't try to relive my past but I should mix it up with going Lock for classic. What about locks is it that makes them brain dead? The fact that they have one option which is to face tank or as you mentioned previously, that they are more of a support class buffing said mages and the likes?
---
&gt; then stopping that video for a couple of seconds to say "Yeah, that's true".
---
So, yeah, you clearly haven't watched Asmongold reactions.  Seems his chat reams him for how often he pauses for extended periods to add his own thoughts.  A YT video of him reacting to a 15 minute video could be 50 minutes long because of how much he's talking.
---
&gt; I can't really be surprised by how dumb some people
---
Well, yeah, I mean, you're proving how dumb, obnoxious, and rude people can be.  You are being a "manchild" while complaining about someone else being a "manchild."  You're being everything you say you dislike about Asmongold.  Don't pretend to be some kind of above average intelligent person when you're missing something that obvious.
---
&gt; You can sit in your room and watch a manchild react to popular videos while I go and enjoy actually decent content.
---
What if they aren't watching in their room?  What if they view that as "decent content?"  So they're enjoying actually decent content and not sitting in their room watching a manchild.  You're making crass assumptions just to be rude.  Are you trying to prove you can be worse than you claim Asmongold is?
---
I'm not even saying this to defend Asmongold, I'm saying this to point out how ridiculous these arguments are.
---
Being the druid that tanks or heals and is happy to do both.  I've actually got a group that wants me specifically for feral tanking, so we'll see how that plays out depending on how mechanics end up working Classic vs pserver environments.
---
So far on the stress test it actually was easier for me to level 1-15 on a few druids than it has been on various pservers I've been playing to familiarize myself with the Tauren starting zone.
---
He should be able to sell it. This is the artists interpretation of Ironforge, not a remade Blizzard piece.
---
I don't follow your thought process. I think his point still stands. The fact someone has thousands of followers don't make them 'my voice'. Just a voice that is probably stronger heard, but nothing more.
---
They are not a puppet that have to speak for me.
---
Upvoting for the excellent movie and the homage to how raid leading used to be in Vanilla.
---
This exchange is hilarious. 
---
It’s like the 2020 version of Charles Barkley “I’m not a role model”.
---
A post with a dude who harvested 7 gurubashi chests in 12 minutes has confirmed that, indeed, they are letting up to 7 layers be created. Admittedly, it was apparently during the stress test.
---
However, it seems Blizzard does intend to allow layers to be created indefinitely. TBH, almost everyone is going to end up playing on a single server because of this
---
Also to add to this, computer hardware after 15 years. Playing on 15 fps vs 144 with 30ms instead of 110 is HUGE
---
Don't you guys have google translate?
---
They're basing that on private servers that are basing their data on shady memories. Blizzard are basing their data on the actual 1.12 client. Other than actual bugs there is NOTHING that is inaccurate because they're using the actual data from 1.12
---
This is *the* game a lot of people have been waiting for. Asking to change it to cater to "more" is like re-painting Starry Night for people that prefer red over blue.
---
To sunken temple I go
---
History doesn't tell us anything because Classic servers will have much higher capacity than Vanilla servers did.
---
In the official german wow forums. They coordinate with guilds and create a discord for this purpose.
---
Yeah idk why everyone thinks this market is tiny. There are currently at least two other MMORPGs up with 3mil each.
---
As they say on /r/wow: You just got lawyered.
---
I like your setup
---
I mean that's all fine and works until I want to group with someone on a different layer and I effectively have a 30 minute Cooldown to wait for.  I think that would do just as much to kill the "community" feel as layering does.
---
The problem is that layering was pitched as basically being a server that will eventually merge, that you would always be on the same layer.  So you would always be in the same community.  Then if Layer1 and Layer3 are too low on population, they merge.
---
What it has turned out to be is sharding across the whole realm, under a different name.
---
But you wanting the game to cater to your play time is ok? Grow up, people had responsibilities in vanilla wow also and were able to accommodate. Not everybody was 11 years old when the game came out.
---
I don't see how that's possible. A VERY good speed run to 60 is still over 5 days /played. Now if you wanted to argue that layering being around for say a month is ridiculous, then yes I would agree. I think 1 week is a good amount of time. Will people playing 18 hours a day abuse the system a bit? Sure. But to say that they will farm every black lotus and arcane crystal until TBC seems a bit of a stretch. If people farm every rare find, they can still only do so in 1/2 additional layers. These people will have advantages regardless as they will be the first in those regions. 
---
What I'm waiting for is a more definitive time frame (assuming that one will be given before launch). If layering is around for a month or longer, I'll be mad too. But if it's around for 1-2 weeks, the game will be fine. I'm also fine with fine tuning layering so that people can't just constantly switch layers but no we don't need an alternative solution TO layering nor will we get one without the release date being pushed to winter.
---
Very good point about the useless mats, I should cut off any item below level 48 perhaps
---
That's the thing.  We were under the assumption it was different until this started happening.
---
Cringe dude
---
10 minutes to find an unoccupied spot is a very, very good trade.
---
It remains to be seen how much luck you'll have finding one. Maybe the conventional wisdom that you can't AOE grind at server launch will be for the most part a self-fulfilling prophecy. You have to spec for AOE grinding starting well before you can do it and if you guess wrong you cost yourself a respec (which puts you one respec closer to the 50g max). Maybe very few mages will take the risk, enabling a few contrarian mages to leverage layering to make it work.
---
Anyway, if you can layer hop to get mob respawns than even teir-2 grind spots like Witch Hill and Swamp of Sorrows murlocs become just as good as the teir-1 spots.
---
I'd recommend pally at that age.
---
Mash random buttons, mash mash mash... oh a crit.
---
5 min is the time it takes from some graveyards.
---
I think that is what the subreddit/people voting are saying, although I think they are wrong, but yeah strimmer apamcwikl be a thing for strimmer servers
---
Yup, I have almost exactly the same macro on my druid. It's baked into a larger macro with other functions. You can write it all under a single "/use". The rage loss isn't so bad with Furor.
---
Oh, the English one then. Because there wasn't ever a need to create an entire translation of the client because some parts of Europe can't speak another language.
---
Anyone have a youtube mirror for the work folks?
---
As a non-english EU dweller, this is correct.
---
&gt; 99% of the playerbase won't even notice.
---
Every single player will notice the shitty economy and top-end players being superhumanly fast. They just won't know the ultimate reason.
---
Where can I buy this? I want to make sure the money goes directly to him does he have a store?
---
&gt; There's a super easy answer: if there are too many people in an area, go somewhere else.
---
Oh sure, let me just take my human to the night elf starting area where it's just as congested.
---
&gt;Go back to retail.
---
Use your brain.
---
He used phase 2 as an obvious example of why it needs to be shut off. 
---
To quote him: 
---
&gt; We're going to continue that process over the first few weeks, until eventually we will collapse down, and **we promise we will do this a few weeks in, to a single world per realm, no sharding, none of that going forward.** 
---
He literally says he promises it'll be shut off within a few weeks. That's the opposite of hedging.
---

---
Roll PvE.
---
It's a great tool to make the release experience bearable. But quite honestly, they should remove it after a week or so when most people have spread out a bit.
---
What I fear is that they plan to make just one "mega server" per server type (PvE, PvP, RP) and layer it up to no end, so that they don't have the headache later on when people quit and servers start to be ghost towns. And with such a concept, layering will never be deactivated.
---
:) : ) :) iam not pissed - You
---
TIL YouTube supports ultrawide
---
...which makes the video kind of unwatchable
---
I am sorry for the down votes, the problem with reddit is that idiots win, which means you get downvotes cause more strimmer friendly people voted you down than antistrim people voted you up....
---
The overwhelming majority of the playerbase are not the ones who would exploit layering. They're the ones who would be the victims of the high-end neckbeards who did.  
---
Yes. The majority of the playerbase would be the victims.
---
It's the beta, this is an extreme version.
---
3 months*
---
Btw banning a language ain't legal

A Warlock that is happy to get everyone stoned. 
---
Also teleport people to 5man dungeons cause that's what made me fall in love with vanilla in the first place. 
---
The handcrafted enchanted experience. With actual tough BBEG, and sweet loot trade for respected classes.
---
Not gonna lie, I even miss the random guy/girl stealing an out of class drop. 
---
Something about the, you "mother fucker" element added another emersive layer.
---
&gt;and you had to pirate it
---
Ironically one of the reasons why a lot of people play on private servers.
---
I'm with you in that I'm opposed to the alarmist end of the world hyperbole going on.
---
However, from the information available right now, it seems layers are indeed being created indefinitely and with almost no population balancing going on at all within those layers. There were at LEAST seven different layers during the stress test, and anecdotally, it seemed that the layers were being created based purely on local player density (i.e., 500 dudes in coldridge valley, so a new layer made for half of them), and then there.. is no one else on that layer who wasn't in coldridge. Starting a character in Dun Morogh and going to Northshire, you'd find a practically empty world.
---
The description given to us by Ion of layering was great. In practice, that IS NOT what they are doing. All evidence seems to suggest that it is literally exactly the sharding tech.
---
not every server was the same.  Our people knew their raid times and our whole purpose was to wipe them to remove their buffs and fuck up their schedule. Same thing happened to lots of guilds from both factions and some ended up in wars or something like that
---
I’m planning on play just with my wife and friend 
---
Whenever all three have time 
---
One warrior /mage/and healer priest 
---
Any tips on how to make it work ?
---
I'm going to get the game and enjoy it no matter what Blizzard decides for any of those issues. The only things that are going to bother me is if I accidentally end up on a major streamer server, or if battleground queues are so long that I have to re-roll Alliance just to farm them. I really want to play Horde, so hopefully that's not the case - but I feel like most serious PvPers are going to play Horde, so I might have no choice. =[
---
Sorry homie, I am dyslexic, it makes edits impossible with out spell check. If I used a word that isn't a simile to "for sure" I don't know what to tell ya
---
My solution is simple.  Collect the needed materials for the legendaries, and let people roll on the rest and sell/use it.
---
You speak about them like they're just robots with no preference or taste or enjoyment for their job. I've been in my career industry for five years. No two projects are the same, and I definitely have vastly different emotional investments depending on the project.
---
Remember when this exact shit was posted 2 days ago? Copypasta is supposed to be funny.
---
&gt;stated they were definitely designed to be used but they didn't expect people to use them all together to make the content trivial.
---
So he didn't state that using them all was an exploit, just that they didn't expect it.
---
It's different you know.
---
Seems like a losing strategy if Blizzard is already shooting themselves in the foot with the expectation of failed game.
---
I experienced layering in Org and even that was extremely jarring.  Gave a friendly crafter 20 linen to craft 3 bags for me, as he's crafting he just disappears in front of me (hadn't grouped up yet, didnt think i needed to).  I first though he ghosted me and just stole linen.  He then invites me to a group and bam 30 ppl appear in front of me.  Very jarring, and this was a city.
---
Look all you have to do is start an english speaking discord, then name and excommunicate known non-english speakers and spend your ever day looking for them in game and ruining their gameplay until they give up.
---
Markets and consumers do change. And that is how niches work. WoW in 2007 wasn't niche in the MMO market, or even the PC gaming market. It was one of the most popular PC games in the world.
---
Classic WoW in 2019 is definitely niche, even in the MMO market. That player base that supported WoW in 2007 absolutely has changed and is much smaller. Most of those people are at adults now with careers and families, and even the few who still have time and interest in WoW, and have been playing it this whole time, have definitely changed in their preferences. 
---
And the younger players who weren't around for Classic (which make up the the large majority of people who have ever played WoW), definitely lean more towards faster paced game-play and larger variety of content and reward systems. 
---
And again, the root of the argument is whether or not population decline is likely and if Blizzard should be preparing for it. I can't see any real argument for them not to err on the side of decline.
---
I do have some sympathy - playing a game in a foreign language can be really hard, even if you have a reasonable grasp of it.
---
That said, Blizzard has a difficult decision to face if they anticipate that there won't be sufficient demand to justify language-specific servers (I happen to think they're wrong, but I don't have any evidence other than gut feeling to back that up, so). Because if that is the case, then it's probably a lesser evil to deal with the language issues than to have dead servers where no one can do much at all because the population is so low.
---
I agree. The problem will probably not be as extreme but i still think that layering is going to be bad for the game.
---
unintended use is the definition of exploit.

1) This will be removed once launch is over
---
2) This is beta and has not been removed because beta is beta.
---
Just don't collect raw materials at all beyond the ones that drop in raids. Filter that shit to the dedicated profession users who then only send you finished products. The only case this doesn't work is for enchants and there are only 4 end-game mats to collect there.
---
Not usually the "devs" fault, Usually a producer,executive,directory level decision.
---
Most devs get paid to color in the lines that someone else defined.
---
Thats cause warlocks actually work for the burning legion cant trust them.
---
Chances are, Blizzard is just going to release one of each realm type in Europe. They clearly aren't very confident about the game if they don't think they can allocate a server to each common language.
---
French here.  
---
If Blizzard really wanted to give us a true nostalgic experience, they would realise that for people struggling with english, a mixed-languages server is a despicable nightmare : how do you find teammates for dungeons or quest? How do you trade ? 
---
Some of my fondest memories of the early game are linked to random encounters with other players! 
---
I've played very old games in my teenage years where I met people from all around the world but the language barrier can be quite something. I have friends in their late 40s who simply won't join Classic because of this, we've already discussed it...
---
It's also one of the reasons why a lot of people don't. It's hard to say conclusively if its a net gain or loss for private populations.
---
Honestly both sides are dumb imo. I knew what I was getting into when I said that, but it needed to be said.
---
How is beta not a statistic, that's the whole point of having it (and if they catch bugs along the way even better, free advertisement and game testing plus to you data, everybody wins).
---
As for the original point about the German players, maybe they have market studies and weigh that it isn't worth language-separated servers.
---
As to the post about Blizzard thinking Classic will fail, I think the larger picture is that they don't really care much about Classic in the long run. They tied it to the normal subscription, opted to do the rolling phases so that they can get sub numbers up and bring back the scores of people that left the game so that when the next expansion for retail is announced with a rumored level squish and (speculated) world and leveling overhaul, they can try to keep some of those Classic only subscriptions locked in beyond the lifespan of Classic.
---
I don't even really know what we're arguing about, I just think it's naive to think Blizzard is bringing back Classic and making decisions without the backing of data that the average consumer doesn't see.
---
Also its beneficial because of mob tagging to group up to expedite finishing quest objectives.
---
I don’t particularly care what the current dev team thinks.  These are the same people who thought garrisons should have been a mobile app  Skinner box and making every previous expansion absolutely irrelevant, fundamentally reworking the game every two or so years.

They REALLY should have figured out the importance of making each expansion its own separate thing around cataclysm, and making sure everyone could get a conclusion to the story that came before.  Instead, they focused on getting people to skip as much content as possible and can’t figure out why no one wants to see their disjointed mess of a story or play their mess of an empty lobby world while everyone is squirreled away in phased or instances content.
---
Eventually all stock just becomes moving inventory with fluctuating price averages.  As long as you roughly buy below ur average sales price, there’s profit.  Essentially becoming a Warcraft commodities day trader.
---
In the last two weeks specifically there has been an absolute boom of reposts, low effort crossposts, and facebook tier meme'ing going on.
---
Can we put a stop to this karma farming / brainlet behaviors?
---
LC is tougher for 40 mans though.  It works great if you have a consistent group with good class leaders who know what everyone needs.  But what I have seen most times with LC is that it gets very cliquey and certain people are fed gear even when it could benefit the guild/raid much more going to someone else.
---
&gt; You're just as annoying as a streamers fans.
---
Newsflash: that guy is obviously a streamer fan. He was clearly being sarcastic by implying that Sodapoppin is ganked too much as it is, and arguing as if you were complaining because you want Sodapopping ganked more as an anti-streamer dude.  
---
You reversed both roles altogether here.
---
Now if they announce layering will be around for longer than 2 weeks or so, that will be crazy to me and unwarranted. I think backlash at how long layering will be around is fine. Even suggestions at improving layering by imposing specific areas where moving to a new layer can happen or putting a cooldown on layering are fine, but layering as a general option is here to stay unless we want to whine ourselves into a winter release. 
---
I personally think the best compromise would have been sharding the 1-12 zones for the first 2 weeks and not introducing layering at all, but I also think we're past that option if we want to keep the release date. 
---
The thing is, these options will give people a fun start to classic WoW. We're sitting here talking about 15k server populations but if there are lines of 20 people for named mobs during launch and the couple of days after, I don't think we'll have to worry about classic sticking around long enough for any of this to matter. Some people won't mind taking 4 hours to get to level 5 or exploring their way to level 12, but too many would.
---
I should also point out i'd like to incentive players to gather materials by giving them points when they donate. Same points they use to get armor. Not a lot of points of course, if a boss kill is 1 point then donating a stack of Mountain Silversage would likely be around 0.1, and each stack of the same item would be worth 25% less (based on the starting amount). Temporary numbers, but it would likely be around that 10% of a boss kill mark
---
Many veterans of the Anglo-Tuga war here :D
---
He literally said this shouldn't work, I shouldn't be able to do this.
---
Hey bro I know you’re a BFA player you should remember the BFA beta...
---
And yet, people are still defending layering.
---
LOOK. LOOK AT IT.
---
We weren't fearmongering like you all claimed, this is actually as bad as we warned.
---
Sounds like exactly what I'm hoping to find as well!
---
Blizzard should just give out more Beta invites to occupy the time of the No-Lifers on this sub. Right now they can't find anything to do but nit pick while they wait
---
3 months out of 2 years is extremely short now?  
---
The most crucial foundational 3 months of the newly forming economy?
---
That's not true at all. The whole point of the argument rests on the fact that retail wow has had German, French, Spanish etc. servers since it launched in 2005. The German players who are playing on English servers on live would go on English Classic servers to play with their friends, and the players on the live German server would go to the classic German server and play with their friends.
---
And no, it has nothing to do with the children, it's anyone who doesn't speak English and is currently playing on a different language server.
---
3 months? really? I could have swore they said it wouldn't be that long.
---
I don't see many casual guilds interested in loot council. I may be wrong but that isn't my experience with casual guilds. I also don't see them keeping their buffs for the whole duration.  That's kinda the point of casual guilds. They show up, have fun, and don't expect people to do all the extra stuff or spend a ton of time preparing. Imo if you join a casual guild and they're expecting you to do all this extra stuff, that's a problem with your guild not game mechanics.
---
Lmao right? I actually have luxury of being a stay-at-home dad for a little while, so I should be able to sink a few extra hours in while it lasts.
---
I predicted this shit the day layering was first talked about:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/boldr0/its_been_fun_boys/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/boldr0/its_been_fun_boys/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)
---
I mean, how long do you typically group for?  If you're doing under 30 minute groups, my guess is a person you see on your own layer invited you or vice versa because you're doing the same quest or something.  In which case, no cool down because you're not switching layers.  If a friend comes online and you want to group up, I'm guessing the vast majority of the time it's for more than half an hour.  So the CD shouldn't matter.
---
There goes the entire population of the Barrens.
---
To quote him:
---
He literally says he promises it'll be shut off within a few weeks.
---
Source: [https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=360](https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=360)
---
As I said, he then goes on to use phase 2 as an obvious example of why it needs to be shut off.
---
I really want to play on the US servers too but since I'll have classes to attend to during the weekdays, the raid times wouldn't work at all I think. 
---
Ugh, maybe I should just bite the sour apple and find a premade guild. But to me the fun is to naturally make friends and a guild. :(
---
Well why wouldn't you want to level that way? It literally makes it more efficient and you can do it. If my Layer is less populated for the human starting area you bet my ass im inviting all of my friends to it.
---
Still way ahead of warlocks in mc. Will get beaten by the physical dps early on though sure.
---
&gt; But you wanting the game to go out of it's way and cater to your play time is ok?
---
Uhm no? how as asking them to NOT add a 20 minute cooldown to forming groups is somehow me asking blizzard to cater to my play time?  Are you for real?
---
&gt; Not everybody was 11 years old when the game came out.
---
When the game came out, it didn't have the gigantic fucking player base that it does now.  What do you think the experience will be like at launch with no sharding/layering.  Enjoy sitting in queue and fighting with 3.5k other people for the same exact quest mobs because everyone is starting at the EXACT same time.
---
Holy shit, it's like you diehard fans actually want the re-release to be a failure.
---
Burning legion was a fantastic server back in vanilla, was my first server also. I was raiding on alliance up until the end of tbc where i moved off to another server and noticed the shift starting to happen then. Good old days!
---
Gotta get that smooth bowel movement
---
Do you have autism and a reading deficiency by any chance? To be clear here since you clearly didnt understand my last post(even tho i tried my hardest to write in a way even you, a complete mongoloid would understand)To make things even clearer so even YOU can understand it, i am not, in any way oposed to arena in classic. What i am opposed to is retards spewing bullshit about their internet achievements and how it makes them better then other People. You however are a lost cause and im done arguing with you. Youre clearly a sperg that thinks because he has more achievement points then others he has the right to decide whats fun and whats not. Maybe invest as much time in being a decent human being instead of playing wow about 18 hours a day and then bragging about it on some forum for imaginery soy points.
---
Soda being a little bitch? Lol nooo way guys. News worthy.
---
&gt; Just whisper random people not in a group or guild and hope they are in a layer different from yours?
---
Most of us have these connections called "friends." Maybe if you stop pretending to be retarded on the internet, you will make some as well.
---
I heard you! have a good weekend and nice additions!
---
My little niece loves my light up keyboard Lol. Not sure which age they can really start playing for real though
---
Just learn english 4Head
---
&gt; I'd rather argue about things that actually matter
---
None of this matters though. Just don't get world buffs, simple as that.
---
If its limited to just the first two weeks ill be over the moon happy actually, but im extremely doubtful about it.. given blizzards recent track record of fucking up pretty much anything they touch  
---
id still prefer no layering tho, but thats just me.
---
who in his right mind is downvoting me... and why? thought this is supposed to be CLASSIC
---
Sure. But humans look better with their armor and have better casting animations.
---
What was suicide kings?
---
Dude that desperate for karma?
---
I editted the post with this thing I forgot to point out, i'd like to incentivize players to donate items we would use in guild progression by awarding them points for doing so
---
I don't get why anybody would ever be under that assumption. Layering was just Blizzard's attempt of rebranding sharding; it's the same thing. But just because they changed the name and tweaked it a bit, suddenly half the damn subreddit is defending it. It blows my mind how many people are falling for it.
---
I can certainly sympathize. I took several years of French, but I would not want to try and raid using it, definitely. Raiding is hard enough normally. :)
---
An adult black dragon,
---
A level 20 dungeon boss,
---
The High King of the Alliance,
---
The Lich King.
---
One of these things is not like the others.
---
&gt; If you're doing under 30 minute groups, my guess is a person you see on your own layer invited you or vice versa because you're doing the same quest or something
---
What about trading in major cities? Unless you are suggesting that we can't even talk to people outside our layers?
---

3 years*
---
What lol? Vanilla is basically the carebare mmo of the tryhard mmos back in the day. Ultima and eq where hardcore. Vanilla was not. Nowadays vanilla is veiwed as hc and retail is not. So go play retail.
---
The rolling for first raid, is usually for the guild's first raid, not usually a member's or recruit's.
---
The problem is though is that 1 percent can ruin the whole economy of a server by hopping layers for nodes and such.
---
They announced that there wil be no language-specific servers.
---
People still play retail lol
---
would you be laughing if i ganked ya for 30 minutes straight? no. it sucks. if you are a streamer or not it sucks, my guildies would rage every time they got ganked. they were not streamers, just normal players.
---
...You know that european timezones are not more than 2 hours at max apart, right?
---
I really thought it would tic enough to kill you after a few seconds, but not instantly like the lower lava pool.
---
Can only layer shift when you initially pick your character and never again under any circumstances.
---
Could be worse - foreign language education in the US is all but vestigial.
---
Blizzard said the exact opposite. Layering will be live for an estimated 2-4 weeks after launch. Dire Maul is in Phase 2. Layering will only occur during Phase 1. From Wowhead's recap of Blizzard's information regarding layering:  
---
"Layering will only be used for a couple of weeks or maybe a month at the start of Classic WoW, in order to balance the huge influx of players in the same zones. Once the situation reaches a controlled state, it will be completely disabled and realms will once more have one instance of themselves. Layering also will not happen after Phase 1"
---
Because product or service having problems doesn't mean it is all total shit. There can be still be some parts that actually works. This isn't rocket science.
---
I don't really have a problem with people escaping PvP through layer switching in a rested area.  It's a really edge case and does kind of allow them to escape potential griefing in town.
---
Also not every quest hub had a rest area until cata.
---
I know people boohoo over gatekeeping, but seriously fuck right off with that noise. Classic isn't for the common denominator, it has nothing to do with being 'better' or people being 'beneath' him, this game is *meant* for the 'try-hards', you folks have retail
---
I'm leveling a shaman on a server right now, just be prepared for auto attacking enemies to death
---
not till phase 2 right? When Diremaul comes out?
---
I meme around about warlock, but it's mostly the lack of mobility and attrition style gameplay that really turns me off from the class.
---
Mage has a lot more split second decisions and instant cast burst and for me it makes it a lot more fun to play.
---
It's a balance. I am saying layering provides a solution to the issue at hand, not that it is the ultimate solution. It's a temporary fix.
---
Layering is just a special case of sharding, but it's still sharding. All sharding is is that not all players in your world are available to you and every implementation of sharding will have things like people going poof or duplicated resources.
---
I don't see why they wouldn't just restrict when you can group like having to be out of combat during layering
---
Not really. Layering is almost certainly going to last longer than that. And in any case, it permanently damaged the community and the economy even after it's removed.
---
Priority list-based system.  In short, if an item drops that people want, whomever is closer to the top of the list gets it and then goes to the bottom: Tom, Dick, and Harry all want loot.  Item drops, Tom wins, list is now Dick, Harry, Tom.
---
Good question I thought I remember it, but it could've been TBC
---
Yup so now you kill the mob and it disappears before you can loot it.
---
I can definitely see why you would be skeptical and I am too but given how much they’ve listened to us already about Classic, I think we need to give them more credit. At this point it’s like we’ve run out of things to complain about because we already got like 99.9% of what we asked for. I’m also glad that layering exploits are being brought forth because it will incentivize them to carefully consider how long layering is around. I just think expecting it to be completely removed will be detrimental to classic starting our strong and maintaining a healthy player base and on top of that, there’s no way it will be significantly altered or removed this close to launch. 
---
Good discussion though your opinion on not wanting it is valid and shared by others, but I think even at it’s worse (being around a month or longer) it still won’t ruin the game.
---
stop deleting your comment and reworking it so I can actually reply
---
&gt; Asking to change it to cater to "more" is like re-painting Starry Night for people that prefer red over blue.
---
I fail to see how not wanting a 20 minute cooldown for joining groups is me asking for them to cater to me....
---
Imagine blindly hating a mechanic so much, that you actually insist on adding a 20 minute CD to joining a group.  And then tell me that I'm asking the game to cater to me?  I just want to be able to play the game.
---
You have no control with sharding, whereas layering is somewhat under your control., or at least you can know when it will affect you.
---
Seeing how this is what layering has turned out to be, they should just do starting zone sharding instead. Hell, just make every alliance and horde zone sharded and make contested zones the glorious mess they are supposed to be.
---
He even says himself that he shouldn't be able to do what he did. The point should be about layering, not if it's ok for a streamer to do it or not.
---
Give this man an upvote.
---
Because Mandarin is the largest natively spoken language apparently. I just picked the first MMO that came into my head
---
Just dont have anyone who is ravenous about any of the touchy issues. Id hate to be arguing with someone over layering, and they abusing the power to ban.
---
"You think you want Classic, but you don't"
---
"You guys have phones, don't you?"
---
Naaaah, no way they could be that dumb. ;)
---
Agreed. make one for "What comes after Naxx?" while you are at it.
---
This is why Blizzard rebranded sharding as layering. There are so many fools in this subreddit that fell for it.
---
Thanks, I wondered the same thing
---
Because it isn't the ~~Classic~~ WoW community if we don't take every thing said (or not said) by a developer in the worst way possible and freak out over it as if they are personally out to get us.
---
It in fact scales all int from gear in 1.12 client.  
---
You are right about it being a very small raw number for dps.  Numbers are overall smaller in vanilla so if you doing 400dps, 0.5% is about 2dps.  When you are full raid buffed in naxx gear, in fire so crit matters more, and truely pumping damage at maybe the 1200+dps, it expands to merely 6dps.  Not giganitc, but not nothing.
---
Also a 10gb video that was just uploaded. Still 360p quality that should increase as it continues processing.
---
Layering ruins the game.  
---
I'm still playing, but layering has killed any hype for me. I'm still organizing a guild and raiding and I've already put together a website and invited tons of friends.  
---
But layering ruins the game. Anyone who even attempts to claim otherwise is definitively wrong and absolutely refuses to take their heads out of their asses. They keep spouting lies like "only a few weeks" and "people can't abuse it" and "who cares if 1% of people get insanely unfathomably rich off of it?"  
---
But layering ruins the game.
---
So, not playing for years saved you on sub fees, which could have paid for your transfer.
---
If you're paying $15 a month, but can't afford a server transfer, I think you shouldn't be playing wow monthly subs in the first place.
---
The game breaking part is that someone can run a level 1 to the arena the second the server comes up and have a day of 7 chests every 3 hours before any real characters get to STV. Between liquid gold and the vendor value of the trinket + BOEs each chest is 3-10 gold, and that's without even getting into rare drops from the chest. This FUCKS the early economy.
---
Welp; looks like I’m rolling on EU. More memes.
---
I wanna be the guy who posts the Xbox 360 joke. It’s gonna take a lot of hard work and dedication but anything worthwhile does.
---
I was thinking moreso for pvp but noones forcing you to join groups so while looting just don't join a group
---
So far everything is fine. I created a test group and the addon started broadcasting a message in the appropriate chat channel. Unfortunately it seems like no other player on my server is using it, and it's too late to ask someone to help, cause the servers will be shut down in 2 hours. The only thing I'd like ask is a pure cosmetic change. For whatever reason broadcastchannel, broadcastinterval and invitemessage are written without space between words in the Settings tab :)
---
Might as well roll a pve server if you're going to abuse layers to avoid ganks.
---
sheep I=J
---
Thanks for being a good sport, but yeah, I totally get that for many (possibly most) people, no layering would be worse at launch. I understand its unrealistic to want it completely gone, Im just praying it gets removed quick enough. (or at all really)
---
&gt;  only given us the promise it'll be gone by phase 2 
---
well *I* also find it disingenuous to spread lies
---
Ahahaha this is the best OC ive seen for a long time!
---
I'm in beta, yes it does
---
You don’t play any FPS games do you?
---
That's how we got layering. There's so many people complaining that they wouldn't be able to solo level 1-5 as fast as possible without any competition. These people just want instant gratification, and can't stand any inconveniences.
---
&gt; Every single player will notice the shitty economy 
---
I've written this up many times, but layering won't ruin the economy.
---
So, let's look at "Black Lotus". There can be two black lotus at a time, those two serves a 3k population. With layering, let's say there are 4 layers. That's a 12k population. To keep the economy stable with 12k players, you need 8 black lotus.
---
So, with 4 layers, there are 2 Black Lotus per layer. If someone can layerswap to farm them all (they can't really, not with Black Lotus), so all youre doing with the layer swap farming, is supplying the public with the correct amount of mats needed to sustain a higher playerbase.
---
&gt; Example 2
---
Let’s give another example, Let’s say on the map, there are 100 copper node spawns, and spawn time is 5 minutes.
---
Let’s say a server should handle 3k players at any one time. So, say there are 3k players. that would mean 1 layer.
---
So one player can camp at 1 node, and every time it spawns, mine it. Say every node is camped. So after 1 hour, 1200 copper nodes are mined.
---
1200 copper nodes for 3000 players. Or 0.4 nodes per player.
---
Now let’s say there are 5 layers, with 3k players each layer (15,000 players total). 5 layers, that means there are exactly 500 copper nodes (100 per layer). Each spawn is camped by 1 player, that layer swaps each time they mine. After 1 hour, 1200*5 nodes are mined.
---
So after 1 hour
---
6,000 copper nodes for 15000 players. Or 0.4 nodes per player.
---
It doesn’t matter if a player layer swaps, it will not hurt the economy at all.
---
1 point in Improved Hunter's Mark is a lot worse than 1 point in Efficiency.
---
This is the spec: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/hunter/-5105103051-005005251030315
---
Clever Traps vs Savage Strikes is really just whether you spend more time in wPVP or in BGs.
---
Wouldnt be classic without barnes chat haha
---
Quality post
---
My plan is to roll mage first and then warrior second. Warrior is much more slower and more gear dependent. I’m planning on funneling gold/gear/pots to my warrior and leveling him only on rested XP.
---
I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU
---
Do you offer returns?  What bout buyers remorse. Also, any coupons?
---
You can't switch layers in a contested zone or while PVP flagged. Problem solved. There's no nodes worth gathering outside of contested areas, and you can't skirt pvp if you're flagged.
---
i'll comment on this for later
---
Yeah, keeping my lock picking and poison crafting caught up with my level is my only goal. If I’m fiending for some cheap instant gratification endorphins I’ll just do a key on retail
---
Betcha he's the kind of douche that would mock people for OvErReAcTiNg too
---
Layering will be gone within 2-4 weeks of launch. I don't see this being a problem at all regarding World PvP, or anything really.
---
Thanks for your comments. I got way more replies than I anticipated. Seems like my notion of 1 player = 1 character was never really entertained by the majority of players.
---
People are used to something here, simple as that. They either can't or won't speak english for reasons that are either legit or not.
---
True! But I want to tank so badly :)
---
Maybe by then you'll manage to find a cactus apple.
---
LFR is garbage tier content, that's not a very high bar to clear
---
You do it buddy. You get you a thunderfury! Aim for the stars\~!
---
It's kind of funny when you put it that way.
---
/r/battlestations
---
Don’t put a level limit on it, instead collect only those materials you need.  For example you ask a guildie to choose a certain profession, take everything that guildie would need (200x, 400y, etc.) to get to level 250. Then always keep anything that would help a profession get from 250-300.
---
How fun is the classic shaman? My main was a Druid and I loved it. Wanted to try something knew but I love the hybrid playstyle
---
None. There may be some addons that could count some of those things though.
---
&gt; Don't give up faith in the classic team, they listened before so there's no reason to believe they won't listen again
---
They've listened before *because* of the cynicism. Nothing happens if everyone just shuts up and accepts it.
---
&gt; I still don't see an issue with it
---
You can use it to abuse gathering rare herbs/ore, rare mobs, gurabushi arena, etc.
---
You get an upvote for water, always stay hydrated
---
Deadass would commission a Stormwind painting.
---
As someone who has always been pretty good at oral partially thanks to videos, I find the whole idea of refusing to give a blowjob just weird.
---
Maybe.... I dont know, give head? It's not my preference either.
---
I would rather layering not exist, but I do think it's an issue that needs to be addressed and a timeout from changing layers should be implemented if they want to keep layering in. 20 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day, a week, a day, a weekday; I don't really care as long as the issue is addressed compared to what it is now.
---
&gt; When the game came out, it didn't have the gigantic fucking player base that it does now.
---
Technology changes. I guarantee you the player to quality of server ratio was far harsher back when this game launched than it could ever be now; even with millions returning. I would love to sit in queue and fight for 3.5k others for quests, because I had to do just that in vanilla wow. It's part of the experience, love it or hate it. I'm not even a die-hard fan, but I don't want to see it a shadow of it's former self to cater to players like you. There's retail wow if you want a 20 minute gameplay loop.
---
Written notice is about the most official form of resignation you can have.
---
It wasn't. Just watch old videos.
---
Personal I would get Humanoid slaying x3 instead of 3% parry.
---
The community isn't all just 1 dumbass with bad opinions. The community is many different people. Some put out consistently good ideas, while others put out consistently casual ideas.  
---
Every change that has made this game worse was a casual idea. LFR, LFD, Xrealm crap, etc. People want their nodes/mobs and they want them NOW. They want catch-up mechanics. "I pay the same $15/month so I deserve ALL THE LOOT!"  
---
The "hardcore neckbeards" that this sub so derisively mocks are the ones that put out the good ideas and want a pure game state that isn't tainted by garbage like layering.  
---
Blizzard doesn't know fuck-all about good game design. They accidentally'ed into WoW and then ruined it. Blizzard North (a totally different company) made D2 and AntiBlizz couldn't figure out how to make D3 as good as D2 was (hint: stop fucking patching constantly).
---
God damn lol
---
Yes they don't believe that there will be enough non English players to populate 3 servers by language (PVP, PVE, RP)
---
For anyone that says 4 type they already stated that they will not create RPPVP servers.
---
I'm saying if they opened it to everyone in the world they wouldn't be testing the actual stress of launch because tons of people would play it simply because it's free, which classic is not.
---
people will exploit the shit out of it in one week gathering all rare materials in different layers and be rich forever lol
---
Aside from bug reporting, the best thing I did during the stress test was when I randomly got this broom (technically a staff) while questing near Brill. Headed to the weapon master in Undercity only to be reminded that he doesn't teach staves. Grabbed the Zep back to Org, found out I was a bit short of the 10 silver required. Went out to Durotar to farm it from boars and dinos before returning, triumphantly, to claim my prize.
---
This petty achievement was the most fun I've had in WoW in a while to be honest.
---
Hello,
---
I would like to pledge myself to the cause, as I have many attributes, which, I think are befitting a moderator on any subReddit, but especially the kind of character I have found to be true of this staff.  For years now I have dwelt deep, down a narrow set of stairs, in my beloved mother's basement.  You need not fret that my stalwart justice not be in position to place the wretches in their place.  I live on the sustenance of UBEReats (God be thankful that McDonald's is on the menu), my sloppy and slobbery wrists are always bound to mouse and pad.  I can sniff out a troll, a shit wit prankster, an infantile memer, even the foul garlicy odor of someone who thinks their comeuppance is upon them, and I can crush them.  With my elevated sense of self worth I will self-righteously defend the honor of this forum from those who would dare to break any of our sacred eight rules (8 being the "because I fucking said so"), no matter how flimsy my ground is, with impunity.  If we are being honest I see a lot of myself in you.  A lot of similar traits to my own. 
---
This then, I pledge myself to the cause.
---
This post has never been done before Poggers doooooood
---
I dont dislike or like streamers, I think the fans are the ones that ruin it for me, its like Rick and morty, decent show, the fans are cringy and just fucking annoying. So honestly I don't care either way, just answering the dudes question.
---
I vaguely remember a statblock like that, but I don't think I remember it before BC and it may have been an addon on top of that.
---
No gag reflex!
---
They already said in an interview that the name reserving is to look if there are enough servers
---
Yeah, you're probably right haha
---
Points for loot? Yikes. How in the world are you going to determine the value for any specific item? And how will you deal with the people that just buy gold, ransack the Auction House, donate items that are worth the biggest point bang for their buck, and then always get every bit of loot?
---
Guild Banks weren't a hub for players to help each other out in Vanilla. They were used to store all the shit that raids dropped. If you needed Fire Protection Potions to defeat Rag until everyone had enough FR, sure. But there's just no reason to pool every bit of resources the game provides.
---
I had a warrior macro to get fear immun and back to Def stance
---
Layering will be here till phase 2. So 2-3 months.
---
I already listed and mentioned that in the second build.
---
Tbh theres really nothing wrong with the streamers themselves. It's the spergs who cause all the problems...
---
The stress test to level 15? I was in a raid with 30 people that were max level last night lol
---
Don't worry. There are a lot of us I am sure, we're just the quiet ones. I will admit, if someone abuses layering on me, I might be annoyed at the time but why let it ruin what I have been wishing for since BC and excited about since the announcement?
---
What makes you “pretty positive”? Based on what? 
---
Based on the history of Classic’s development; I’d say you are 100% wrong. 
---
Classic is ONLY here because the players have spoken. They are speaking about Layering now.
---
then Blizzard can ban them for exploiting game mechanics.
---
Tauren shaman also cause you get that stun which will be enough to ghost form and GTFO
---
Should remove it after like 2 days tbh
---
I mean... the feeling of getting gear in LFR isn't a very high bar to set.
---
Not a terrible idea, honestly. If they get a shocking number of people showing up ready to reserve names, it could have an impact; I don't want to be so hopeful as to say it \*will\* but you never know, and two weeks probably won't make or break anyone. If things are crazier than expected they could pull up a few more servers; they'd be fools if they didn't have backup names picked out and all that other stuff.
---
It certainly is a possibility that the game will not change after a long time, as well as the potential that they start adding stuff eventually, or add BC. I agree with your point though, that it'll be a very different time... but imo the new context has the potential to encourage sub-par builds, again considering I'm not talking about aq40/naxx.
---
Rank 14 here you come
---
Good point, what about 52 minimum for weapons and armor, then any mat required for 250-300? Also what do you mean by "*take everything that guildie would need (200x, 400y, ect.) to get to level 250.*"?
---
Agreed. Idc that there’s so many topics about this it’s warranted imo. What was originally thought to be just sharding in the starting Zone turned it something wayyyy worse for an unknown period of time.
---
New solution plz blizz
---
&gt;Blizzard clearly thinks classic will fail
---
Ah yes, that's why they spent so much time, money, and resources on creating it.
---
Claiming server population will die down is one thing (and honestly it probably will), but outright failure? Come on.
---
Well that's what I thought at first, before I spent an extra minute reading the details. If Blizzard had done that, I wouldn't be complaining. In fact, I've actually been suggesting that exact solution for at least a year now and most people seem open to it.
---
They lead has said they could increase that 3000 number. Its a number they just choose....servers can handle WAY more.. Its more of an issue of mob availability etc. But months down the road, player based spread out over all levels. If they turn off layering and have a server with 10k population. Itll still work fine.
---
I hope to get a few friends together to eat LIPs then drop sapper charges.  5 or so should be enough to ensure mutual destruction.
---
It's well known that undead players are mostly edgy teens.
---
It's not going to fail, classic has a short life span by nature.  Most players don't last more then 4 to 6 months.  That's why fresh starts are so much fun.  The journey is the destination.
---
I will farm the gold to switch specs. Especially if I’m a mage.
---
Don't worry I move the keyboard far left then
---
 An you imagine being so far up your own ass that you tell people to go play retail in a space dedicated to people who want to play classic instead of retail? Can you imagine how little control over your own life you have to have to need to power trip over who gets to enjoy a game again that they played 14 years ago. Can you imagine crying for such a long time about bringing this beautiful game back only to immediately demand that casual players leave so that the dorito-encrusted space bar “elite” can enjoy “their” game in peace. Can you be so delusional and out of touch with how business works that you think these people will single handedly contribute enough revenue to Blizzard for them to keep classic around for a reasonable time? Can you imagine being so dense that you don’t understand what the word average means? How a common denominator will always arise by definition of what a common denominator is? 
---
Truth is none of it matters. You and your other very small group of keyboard warriors have opinions that 90% of the people playing classic won’t care about. For every one post here about speed leveling and min maxing, you’ll see 9 that emphasize the beauty of the casual aspects of classic and experiencing it like vanilla was. You can keep crying and soiling your own diaper all you want, just please be less vocal about it. It’s idiots like you who are spending the next 2 months crying about classic 18 hours a day who make it seem like there’s actually a majority in this line of thought. But it’s not, it’s just the same pathetic fucks crying over and over again while trying unsuccessfully to gatekeeper this game out of existence.
---
No? There are new issues being discovered with layering every week.
---
So they fixed nothing so far in this beta? After all the Classic team has done so far they deserve the benefit of the doubt, not this ridiculous skepticism.
---
When did blizzard say no changes can you link the blue post please
---
Hey, let's not jump to conclusions here. He accepted an invite from some rando. That doesn't mean he wanted to be invited to "a different layer". Shit shouldn't happen in classic, period. The problem here is that if he left the group he would have probably switched back to his original layer, but that is implying that you can't be in groups with people.
---
I understand why people like Ion because he is very good at saying the things people want to hear but if you judged him off what he does hes pretty much the Anti-Classic of WoW, sure he will crawl his ass onto a video and claim mistakes were made and over pruning happened and yadda yadda but then does absolutely nothing to fix the issues.             
---
              
---
After Classic launches and things are working smoothly i'll be first in line to give him props but he has a fucking long history of saying one thing all while undermining it doing another.
---
I'm not, but okay. I played 1 week of BFA and got to 120 and instantly quit.
---
Do you really not understand why people who were excited about the classic rerelease (specifically those that are excited for the community aspect of it) would be upset about a very detrimental effect to the very thing they think made classic what it was?
---
All this talk about "no changes" and the biggest feature of Vanilla (community) is literally facing the absolute biggest deviation compared to classic release.
---
Its pretty simple stuff.
---
What's the level one fish cook recipe? Thought the first started at 50 cooking.
---
Anybody got the original post? I'm going To try and convince my girlfriend to get this "idyllic Italian town painting" for our living!
---
*Ilinalta’s Deep
---
I don't recall it ever being pitched that way. I do recall that as a proposed solution on this sub, funnily enough.
---
The non-permanence of layers is why they are just shards.
---
We don’t need a solution Ion himself said layering is not classic, but they are doing it for the launch stress. Now maybe he lies and backtracks but this is on beta. Their plan is to use it only for stress times and they’re testing it. We don’t need more of a solution than “turn it off as soon as possible.”

---
&gt;layering fundamentally goes against what Classic is about.
---
What is classic about, not being able to kill a mob?  You played the stress test, it took an hour to get the first quest done.
---
Based on what you describe, I would definitely go priest, this coming from someone who played priest from MC to Naxx in Vanilla, as well as hovered around rank10 the majority of the time in the same period. Shadowpriest is great for solo and worldpvp, and even as support you can really go rather far by speccing PI/Shadow Weaving.
---
Oh wait you're right, it was the wotlk demo.
---
Is it possible to host a server that would allow infinite talent points? Would be fun to try out
---
Its really good, but the introduction is to the premise is too long and repetitive. Its like half the video. I would edit that.
---
Perhaps its because I saw the movie, idk. Just my 2 cents
---
I don't know if this is just my brain, or if everybody works this way --
---
I bound a /cancelform macro to my mount/dismount button (\`) in forms. I find it pretty intuitive to hit the button to get out of form and then hit 2 (healing touch) - analogous to how I would dismount and start a heal when mounted on a paladin or priest or whatever.
---
You can probably macro it in and get one button instead of two, just putting it out there in case it's useful. 
---
(in this case, the two button sequence is not very slow because dismounting/cancelform is not on the global cooldown.)
---
I know this is a big deal for europeans but...
---
I'M PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN WHERE AT LEAST I KNOW I'M FREE
---
Do you think they’ll release a timeframe for it before launch or will they play it by ear?
---
No layering in major cities, make it Lagforge again!
---
Go zugzug yourself lol
---
They really should have just done this, a lot less headache for everyone involved.
---
It was all OK until they started telling us what they are actually planning.
---
Yeah sure but imagine this: you and a friend choose a server and you're not on the same layer. If you can't change layers then your fucked and you can't do anything about it.
---
There is no choice to be made. 
---
The meta has been established and nearly all bosses have same exact debuff priority with few differences here and there.
---
Same.  I hated the alt banking system.
---
Read the edit in my main post, its not a large source of points. But the AH thing is a good point. I made this post for opinions and feedback, so i'm glad to get some. Seems like I should just keep raid mats and toss out the rest of the guild bank then. I didn't think they were used differently back then
---
It does mean we won't use many consumables though, its a pain to get people to farm mats nowadays
---
Isn’t wow Classic in its current implementation already 1.13? I’m pretty sure that’s what it says when you launch the beta or any stress test.
---
There is a reason its low played. It's hard to play well and many will be frustrated by its limitations.
---
Okay why are people concerned about something that’s going to be removed shortly after the game launches. Do you guys...remember that?
---
Nobody is ignoring it. We are just assuming the worst on its presumed length.
---
I dont see the lost correctly i think, just some code...

---
Good thing you’re not running a business.
---
Potentially all of phase 1
---
This is in Portugal.
---
My feeing is if it is not one of your core abilities or a giant QoL abilities you should wait to train it.  
---
There are obvious ones like eye of the beast or sentry totem you could skip until you had more $ after your mount, but you could also not keep upgrading something like tremor totem if you hardly use it.  
---
Something like Blink is something you would obviously not skip as it’s a giant QoL improvement and survivability skill
---
Do you know how many weeks makes up a month? Two months? The answer is: A few. 
---
They've stated in no uncertain terms that their cutoff is phase 2. That's the only solid promise we have. 
---
Another dev clearly stated they are talking about _months_  literally at that same event. Ion is infamous for sweettalking and overpromising the wow community. You're eating up his PR talk like you were born yesterday.
---
Are we stuck in a simulation?
---
I'm in the wait and see mode for now. Layering by itself doesn't worry me, just how long it lasts. A couple of weeks should have minimal effect, a few guys will get super rich maybe if they game it perfectly without much competition. It might even be comical to see multiple groups of people trying to compete for the same layered items. Can you imagine like 20-30 people per server rushing Gurubashi hoping to get a non-competed for chest right at launch?
---
But ya it is sketchy right now. I want to say that the beta overall is being overly aggressive on purpose to test the transitions, but without more detailed breakdowns from Blizzard it's hard to argue that definitively.

---
I love this answer because it's hilarious that the "technology" you are referring to is called sharding/layering lmao.
---
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize the queue would be way larger this time around than it was in vanilla...especially if the server limits stay the same.
---
&gt; There's retail wow if you want a 20 minute gameplay loop.
---
Am I asking for a 20 min gameplay loop? No, I'm telling you that ADDING a 20 minute cooldown to join a group is a fucking TERRIBLE "solution".
---
I mean your a bit of an asshole about it, but you're not wrong.
---
Awesome. =) Cool clip.
---
Honestly I think they will release a timeframe, but then ignore said timeframe and keep layering in permanently. That is what I fear and feel like they are going to do after they did just that with the BFA beta and patches.  
---
I played shaman in retail, and they promised a shaman rework/fix because they couldnt finish the class in time for launch. Well first they postponed the fixing, and now theyre saying they never intended to fix it, nor that they said so despite the post saying all this still being up lol  
---
Just feels like empty politician speak to me at this point, but I hope im wrong.
---
Some editing can be done to those (replace most of the /cast with ;) but overall a great post. There are a lot of things that you can do with macros that most folks don't realize. Although, there is no @focus in classic, fyi =)
---
That's a weird looking healing mace.
---
I know it is, but only in french. And I hate it :P No offense tho, I was just making fun. Carry on :)
---
Ganking/camping lowbies, quest givers, and the white knight 60s that come in attempt to stop me.
---
Are you serious....? What kind of attitude is this? "Well, if you're not a dirty no-lifer and can't waste 20min of your time, then vanilla isn't for you."
---
Lol okay
---
I think druids in pvp might have one of the highest skill ceilings. If you try to just use one aspect of the class, like feral or balance, by itself you will lose to most classes. You have to be able and ready to use the whole druid kit to play well. Open up in cat form, put some bleeds on someone before switching to spell dmg and remember to use hots. Mix that in with kiting and mana management and it can be a lot. I think it's fun to be so busy in a fight and always have somthing to do and an answer to everything
---
Side question, but do you know what the status of /castsequence macros is in classic? I vaguely remember that getting nerfed at some point, but don't remember the details.
---
I used to have a lazy tanking macro that would do shield block, then turn into revenge button for a while, flipping back to shield block after 6 seconds (or whatever the cooldown was). Can I still do that?
---
Mccool best sidekick.

WoW Q&amp;A at blizzcon 2017.
---
Nobody is "blindly" hating a mechanic. There are numerous documented exploits with this layering system that wasn't even in the original vanilla game. It really isn't asking too much to put limitations like this to stop the abuse of it...
---
It is indeed a marvellous piece of art.
---
I have friends so I don't care
---
I mean what classes do? Energy watch and swing/shot timers are you examples of extremely advanced mechanics?     
---
If you just said *mages don't need any class specific addons* fair enough, but saying *the class is extremely primitive, by far the simplest of all* is just pure internet bait.
---
French Perth here.
---
&gt;  People are freaking out because they assume they’re going to keep it and Blizzard doesn’t have a great track record of keeping promises but it’s just complaining for the sake of complaining right now.
---
Definitely agree.  Just get it off as soon as possible and this all goes away.  Tbh, idk why they didn't just decide to shard every zone up to (and maybe including) STV, for a limited amount of time.
---
The very idea of "layers" make it seem more permanent than it needs to be, so I do get the concern though.

---
Amazing movie and I think the idea for this is fantastic, but the joke's execution sort of got lost due to too long a wind-up.
---
That's just realms with extra steps.
---
What problems did you lay out? All I got was queue times and losing raid lockouts. I had to go back a re-read your post. You briefly mentioned "a list of dozens of ways streamers ruin servers" but only listed one.
---
This is something that I really enjoyed about private servers. The Russians and Chinese and general English speakers became like different factions within factions. My favorite was calling in the ruski's to help overwhelm on world bosses and it was like Lord of the Rings, army clears the hill and rushes in to the rescue. Having them on discord and live translating the orders into Russian as we went.
---
I completely understand the concern and in the context of official classic it makes sense to have language specific realms. But in the event they do not budge on this, there's still positive outcomes to be had and fun servers. It's not all doom and gloom.
---
Coming from an American who doesn't need to contend with this problem. Best of luck EU boys
---
If you don’t have a dedicated blacksmith, and you are nominating one to start.  Open donations/trades to every material lvl 1-60 that said guildie would need.   If the easiest way to lvl 150 blacksmith is copper bracers and runes copper belt, open up donations on copper until you’ve reached the required amount.  Forward it to your nominated blacksmith, then choose the next recipe.  
---
If you’re doing multiple professions at once, you can start a chain.  Take copper-make an assload of runes copper belts-&gt;disenchant belts -&gt; auction house -&gt; guild bank.
---
Ah, maybe that’s just a PS thing then.
---
If layering lasts for 4 months, it will ruin the experience for the people who got blizzard to make classic to begin with. If I'm in STV ganking/getting tanked by some character we shouldn't be able to get out of that situation by joining a group.
---
 I still remember the names of characters I fought in Hillsbrad at level 40 in 2004. Layering will kill that. If I'm level 60 by the time it's removed, that experience will be gone. 
---
They need to drastically limit layering. Restrict it to starting zones or something. Otherwise intra-server relations will be shit.
---
Just saying if layering is a thing maybe you should accept that joining a random persons group could have layering consequences. He’s a streamers who’s put dozens of hours into the game and each time he acts like it’s a shocker.
---
Why do the layers affect non-starter zones then?
---
As a beta tester, regardless of streaming stats, it's sort of your responsibility to be playing the game FOR the community.  Of course you are always your own voice, but the implied agreement with being a beta tester is your going to test the experience for the whole community and report what you find.
---
Layering basically is sharding it's just across a much larger area than a single zone.  It's also same realm only which means it's only used to control over population not to bring different realms together.
---
2004 had no real solution to over population, at launch there were sever crashes with huge down time massive queue issues and too many realms opened.  all of which are worse than just having layering for a few weeks.
---
They have reported all of these bugs and provided video proof of each one.
---
Only time will tell if they fix any of them... just keep reporting them and keep an eye on the list, it will be updated as they fix any or find and add anything new.
---
No they said the first 4 weeks or so. Nothing is final. 
---
Never said anything opposing your second point. You make it sound like it.
---
Source on end of phase 1?  I've heard multiple reports, none with backup
---
I'm not sure what you're talking about. Layering IS important at launch, and Blizzard already announced it's not permanent and they'll be analyzing the data on when to turn it off. It 100% will be off by Phase 2, the question is whether it will be off before that.
---
The recent concern came from clips of the beta where people are finding ways to abuse it, so now we're all hoping they turn it off before most people hit the higher levels for the abuse to be impactful.
---
Username checks out.
---
I think I agree with some of what you're saying, but I very much disagree with the statement "Blizzard doesn't know fuck-all about good game design." I think that properties like StarCraft and Overwatch show that they know a great deal about good game design.  
---
Yes they end up patching them until they aren't as good any more (even the first Diablo suffered from that IMHO), but that doesn't change that they knew how to make something good in the first place.
---
You're getting downvoted for being sane
---
Personally I really like a zero sum dkp system with bidding that had minimum prices and also maximum prices.  I know with bidding systems people always worry about collusion, but we didn't seem to have that problem.  And the max price point was to avoid the problem of classes where there were a lot of raiders from not being able to compete in non class gear (eg warriors/rogues vs hunters).  We also had a mechanic that allowed for progression nights.  It was sort of like a phantom raid member that collected points that we could give out to others for progression or any other bonuses we thought we might want to do.  We lowered min gear costs for the previous raid tier once the next tier had been cleared.  New raiders were only allowed gear priority once they were past the recruit phase.
---
If your bad, sure lol
---
They could have a specific resource lockout that persists layers for an individual. Resources dont change location so could be done to prevent the resource abuse.
---
A priest spamming holy nova would be about a 2% dps boost for a mage/warrior aoe-ing.
---
Yes, very true. I guess there's just the hope of it not happening.  Sucks that we have to accept that now. Literally
---
I’m talking about retail. They can make assumptions about region ratios based on current numbers. The numbers will be off but ratio of logins isn’t likely to change by a significant enough margin.
---
Sharing is where different parts of the world are basically their own instance where the moment you cross the zone of a shard, you would see be people in the other shard you just left disappear, Layering is where it isnt split up by zones and where you will always see same People you are in the layer with. At least in theory that is how it is supposed to work. Seemingly doesn’t exactly work properly at this time.
---
Did that make sense the way I explained it?
---
So what do you want instead?
---

The quote is "All the work we’re doing will ultimately allow us to recreate an authentic classic experience on a platform that is much more optimized and stable, helping us avoid latency and stability issues. Additional improvements will include modern anti-cheat/botting detection, customer service and Battle.net integration, and similar conveniences that do not affect the core gameplay experience."
---
And layering was never a core gameplay experience"
---
Then you should know best of all Blizzards track record recently when taking feedback for a beta.
---
I really think the best race would be Night Elf. I don't have any data to support this, and its just my opinion but they're 100% the best Alliance Druids.
---
Frost mages are about battlefield-wide control in pvp. While the lucky string of Frostbite procs can win the game, you can still easily make a build that doesn't use it and do fairly well in PvP. Remember, OP specifically mentioned \*not\* being hardcore or min/max.
---
"Before &lt;favorite streamer&gt; said something, I never saw the big issue with layering."
---
Are you serious? Here is a question what alliance races can be druids in classic? The answer to this will definitely answer your question.
---
You want nobody to get their first quest done just so it's possible to maybe have a lvl 1 raid for shiggles?
---
I agree, it's just a feeling I have and is strictly my opinion but I 100% think it's gotta be night elf
---
Yeah I'm not seeing the Hunter class even being remotely playable when Classic goes live at this rate.
---
Classic Hunter Beta Potential Bug list
---
&gt; There are numerous documented exploits with this layering system that wasn't even in the original vanilla game
---
This is true, but once you've gone so far as to be okay with the addition of a 20 minute CD on joining groups, I think you are kind of losing sight of the bigger picture.
---
I don't like layer, and I don't want it in the game. But I also want to be able to actually play at launch.  Layering isn't a problem so long as it's gone ASAP.
---
But asking to add a cooldown to joining a group to stop a few try-hards from abusing layers is a bad solution.
---
So youre telling me if im getting corpse camped I can just hop a layer?
---
Fuck yea imho lol
---
So they never said no changes? In fact on stage at blizzzcon they directly mentioned avoiding the actual vanilla launch experience. Which implies changes.
---
wow - that is REALLY good

Get rid of layering and add more servers, then merge them later after a big wave of people lose interest.
---
If they need layering in to combat player congestion, how are they going to handle the AQ gate opening? Where the entire server is in one place for an extended period of time fighting mobs and each other. 
---
Of course this is speculation, but it stems from a justified distrust between Blizzard and it’s players.

not comparable

Would suck if you were about to run an instance and had to wait an extra 30 minutes, because someone ganked you. I hate this idea more than what is currently in
---
you are right, however I prefer the braindead class with soullink that a mage will never beat :D
---
Where can a find a guide or something showing the best pvp build for mage? Im assuming its frost?
---
Most businesses are smart enough to realize that the people who reach them represent a larger pool. Nobody looks at the number of feedback calls they received and thinks that's 100% of the population. Blizzard has to be able to make a guess based on how many of us felt just playing the stress test a few days was worth $15 how much larger of a population there is waiting to subscribe when Classic officially launches.
---
You know, there's an easy way for Blizz to figure this out. Just keep the stress test running. A bunch more people are probably willing to pay $15/mo today to start playing even though they'll lose their characters. This would give Blizz even more data about how many Classic players there will be while also driving revenue, win/win.

---
the solutions is server queues. it works.
---
&gt;I also wish Blizzard actually gave a fuck about the game, as they obviously expect it to fail
---
Yeah, that's why they're not releasing it like other games they didn't have confidence in (Ghost, Titan).... oh wait.
---
That they’re even considering using this technology should be answer enough.
---
Phasing is based on quest status. You're still in the same server, you just can't see each other. Sharding mergers players from different realms and each zone is it's own server, so it's possible to change servers when crossing zone boundaries.
---
The concept behind layering is that you will stay on the same set of servers ("layer") as everyone else you see, unless you're invited to a group by someone in a different layer. There is no crossrealming at all. You should also be in the same layer as people on your friends list or guild. It's obviously not quite working that way now, and instances where it doesn't work that way should be reported as bugs.
---
The stuff with people using party invites to hop layers is technically by design. You should be put into your party's layer. There are things they can probably do to mitigate the ability to exploit it. E.g. a cooldown on how frequently one can change layers. Honestly it also seems like maybe there are too many layers in beta for the number of players. The beta doesn't feel crowded. How come these people can get teleported around to what seems like so many layers?
---
Anyway, there's plenty of time to tweak the system and it's obvious they've been making changes to it over time. We'll see what happens on August 27 and after. Blizzard genuinely has good/smart software engineers.
---
Lmao, all it took was Sodapoppin to abuse the system and this subreddit finally came around. Go figure.
---
orc is the best druid by far
---
I’m getting my 16 yo brother to try it out. He seems very interested in having so much investment in one thing. I think it gets boring having no progression and he sees it as a major plus.
---
Linen cloth is gonna be damn hard to come by before level 10 in the amount you'll need to level tailoring fast enough to DE for the wand, at least IMO. Mobs are just so highly contested. The defias in Westfall drop a lot of cloth, but you need to be higher than 10 to kill them, especially the ones by Moonbrook. I'm not sure if there's a better option; during the stress test all humanoids were being camped hard on Realm 15.
---
Except being invited to someone's group isnt an exploit.
---
Ah interesting, I was thinking about rolling Night Elf, but after reading this I might roll a Night Elf now (thank you for having a sense of humor)

Yes too slow, they will all flock back to the incredible adrenaline rush that is the 2019 smash hit OSRS.
---
Yeah, there's like 3 things worth a few hundred gold combined, that can be reused.
---
My only complaint is I'll need a mount before phase 2, and idk if I'll want to get the dreadsteed by then.
---
I'll check this out when I get home; it sounds ideal, honestly, and it might be a good option for people who can't get ahead of the curve to do the quests in Northshire.
---
Also, I fully admit I stared at your screenshot for a few minutes to see if I could find myself in it. ;P
---
People are going to abuse it so much to make a shit ton of gold and hoard resources. “A few weeks” is a large amount of time. The economy will be fucked sideways when layering goes away in phase 2, then Dire Maul releases which historically in pservers its inflated the server economy.
---
only going to be a problem in the first, most important weeks or months of the game, where server communities form. don't worry guys!
---
&gt;Why is it better than the technology of 2004, when it seems that it doesn't fit what classic needs (many people on one place)?
---
The entire purpose of layering isn't to ease the experience of crowded zones, its to ensure that there aren't any dead servers weeks or months down the line.
---
Instead of making 30 servers they make 10 big ones with three layers; when the population on these servers dies down the layers start to merge into one unified server.

Lots of people saw the issue before streamers did, but most people don't have a built-in audience to spread that message to. It's not about streamers driving opinions, it's about streamers leveraging their audience to spread that which pretty much on this forum, but not the greater player base, is already well aware of.
---
Yeah I was thinking either Orc Druid or Orc Paladin
---
Minecraft is the most popular game in the world and it's "slower" than WoW.
---
This is a fact.
---
IIRC they have never confirmed a max pop of 3k per layer. Did you see something I missed on that?
---
Hey it might not be much, but it’s an honest job!
---
Frostbite in PvE can cause party members to get hit/killed when tanking mobs. Often times a rooted mob gets out of range of the tank. You only use root mechanics like Frostbite/Nova/Nets/etc when you coordinate it with your tank, or it's a moment of total party desperation. Often times they can do more harm than good.
---
I said *it should*.
---
Classic will be empty in 2 months. Calling it now.
---
Layering is a form of sharding. There is switching in between so it's just sharding.
---
How? Exactly how are they supposed to ruin the amount of gold that everyone else on the server has and how are they supposed to make prices on everything go up? Oh that's right they can't, the only thing they can do is lower prices and get more gold in the hands of the rest of the players.
---
It's fine.

---
using it to generate unrealistic amounts of materials is.
---
Is that Looking For Raid? Why is that bad? Is the better alternative raiding with a guild or something?
---
layering needs to go after 1 day or only starting zones gonna be alot of tidal charms after that :)
---
The technology I'm referring to is the hardware to run a server. Layering is a software use specifically designed to use hardware efficiently. Like I said, a server that ran wow in vanilla and a server running wow today aren't even on the same level. 3K people was a sacrifice made due to hardware limitations, not because they thought it was a good number. 
---
 &gt;No, I'm telling you that ADDING a 20 minute cooldown to join a group is a fucking TERRIBLE "solution".
---
For you.
---
Yeah ten days in game, of course.  It's crazy to think that just leveling up in classic wow takes more time than most people devote to entire games.
---
Yeah, absolutely. Sorry for lying to you.
---
Yeah kinda. I like being a snowflake. I’m thinking druid or alliance warlock.
---
But I might just roll my original toon which was a gnome mage 🤷‍♂️
---
Or maybe dwarf warrior or paladin.

I have no idea, I probably won’t know until the character screen.

Do you think he will say with till level 25 or 30?  Can you see him walking everywhere till 40?
---
No I don’t think anyone is angry at Soda for abusing the system Blizzard put in the game. People are just ticked off that layering is in the game
---
If you want the game to always cater to you and bend over backwards to please you, just stick with retail. 
---
I'm not trying to be dismissive, I seriously mean it. They're two different game philosophies.
---
Dark souls vibe
---
Right?  That's what I mean.
---
Every "solution" offered up is some lazy idea from some armchair engineer who doesn't think the entire thing through.  Give me a good solution that can't easily have holes poked through it, and i'm sold.
---
It's instant with classic macros even when popping pots. So less missed autos and energy ticks
---
You have no clue if this is what would actually happen.
---
People like that are still going to beg for an end to emergent wpvp and want dungeon queues. Just hope classic stays social instead of falling down the retail trap of "quick, easy, and convenient" again.
---
You effectively just said what I tried to say but way less offensive, good god I hate being this autistic.
---
They can still top the charts. Only rogues can really keep up/beat with them. If the fight just lets the rogue go ham the rogue can out dps a mage but if there are melee restrictions then mages will pull ahead.
---
They never said it would be the first two zones. Even in that discord sentence linked. It never said anything about the first two zones. How did you also miss this?
---
It's in the video interview of Ion. He basically said they want it gone within a few weeks, but no later than phase 1, because phase 2 introduces world bosses that should not be duplicated in layers.
---
The colours, the architecture,  the little ledges looking like they were designed to be climbed . Yupp

My days of old were spent with many people from many European countries. It was amazing, sure the language we used mostly was English but I also learnt to tell jokes in other languages and have a laugh. There are lots of things I learnt and things I discovered (one off the top of the head was getting introduced the mystery of the yeti by a Scandinavian fellow and also how other European countries celebrate Christmas). It was inclusive and everyone learnt from each other. I just hope that is recreated in classic.
---
That just means the corpse had no loot on it and I'm pretty sure that's how it happened in Vanilla.
---
You people are eating your words now.
---
My entire post was sarcasm. Maybe it was unclear. I was hoping the ridiculousness of my post would make that obvious....
---
You mean  Elsaß-Lothringen? :)
---
Yes I can see it now.  You were talking to someone about a game that has 2 versions.  You just couldn’t figure out what to call the full version so you checked the file folder for clues.
---
I had no access to this stress test and I did not try on those before but I am pretty sure there is a reliable way of doing it.
---
Um, the "unpopular opinion" would be the 24 hour AVs. That's in the massive minority, sorry to tell ya.
---
!remindme 130 days
---
I was going to mention that, but my point is ancillary to the whole 1 server 1 language thing going on now. Haven't been on this sub for a minute and didn't even see that whole discussion until immediately after I posted.
---
That looks like things going great to me just some good natured ribbing
---
&gt;Do you know how many weeks makes up a month? Two months? The answer is: A few. Do you know how long it takes to leave the "earliest of zones"? Not a few weeks. Not at all.
---
Sure, that's true if we completely ignore the meaning of the words he said. Sure thing. Zero speakers of the English language would say a few weeks = two months. "Earliest of zones" is also pretty clear, but i guess you could imagine some wiggle room there.
---
&gt; They've stated in no uncertain terms that their cutoff is phase 2. That's the only solid promise we have. 
---
Again, I just posted a literal promise, but I guess you're choose to not acknowledge it. 
---
&gt;Another dev clearly stated they are talking about *months* literally at that same event. Go on, [click the link](https://youtu.be/UHMd0KC3eTY?t=779), tell me how this fits into your little bubble. Ion is infamous for sweettalking and overpromising the wow community. You're eating up his PR talk like you were born yesterday.

I love how mad you are.

Lol amazing!

It's more for the opposite faction ganking rested areas since they can shift when out of combat there.
---
I actually don't know if an undead rogue for example can get rested while stealthed in an alliance zone inn.  Hm
---
Classic is absolutely not too slow. Sure, leveling can be slow and tedious at times. But you’re building something up from nothing. The world pvp, the battle grounds, the massive 40 man raids, there’s more to do in classic than any other mmo that’s out. The sheer amount of quests, items, reputations, and goals to obtain are insane. If someone finds themselves thinking “what is there to even do at ‘this’ level” then they aren’t even trying.

You do have a say, its called just not paying for a WoW subscription and voicing your reasons for not doing so. Voting with your wallet is the only thing companies actually listen to.
---
This subreddit can whine and moan about these things all day, but as long as you keep giving them your $15 little would change.
---
Yeah, thats not the same as what the other guy said.  Thats why I asked.  Just wanted to clarify
---
One exception? How about the fact that we even have this fucking game. Blizzard listens where applicable.
---
Short answer: No. No it isn't. 
---
And anyone who's looking to play this game longterm should show some respect for themselves and their time, reject this bad deal, and settle for nothing less than receiving the game that was expected and advertised for by Blizzard.
---
That game being a faithful recreation of Vanilla WoW. Classic CAN be that. Classic with layering CAN'T.
---
A lot of people saw it coming when they announced it, and more should have. 
---
&gt;"the experience of vanilla without the vanilla launch"
---
They were never going to try what the pservers did, why would they when putting the game on the modern client lets you just modify sharding and put it in?
---
Hmm I can log out in the inn near the docks in Zandalar as Alliance... so i'd guess they can.  Good point.
---
uhuh
---
You didn't think very far about solutions to this. The players just choose the layer themselves, no need to randomize it.
---
Make new friends as you go. Hell, I still have friends I made in Nost.
---
&gt;designed to be used
---
Well yeah, if the same time it takes corpse-running after a wipe in a raid is too much time for you then you shouldn’t be playing classic, sorry buddy.
---
Their goal isn’t gear, its dominance of the content. Gear comes with it, yes. But that can often just be a means to an end, not the final goal.
---
On retail, I have good gear. I collect good gear to perform well. But this gear is only used to try and clear the content, nothing else.
---
I mean look at drak'thul for Czech community and burning blade if I am wrong correct me for the Polish one we never had privilege of national server so we created our own so I don't see any problem with servers not being national.
---
I wont. lost too many CS:GO matches because of 0 communication
---
I think if the game has a French client then there should be a French server. Same with German, Spanish, and every other language there is. These people who either suck at English or don't speak it at all are going to form their own unofficial communities anyway, and that makes it HORRIBLE for the English speakers who find themselves on these realms, expecting them to be English.
---
This. 1.5 AV was horribly, horribly unpopular. Blizzard has the population numbers to back it up.
---
Right, because the solution to Echo Chambers is totally to have more of them.
---
Holy shit thank you.
---
Truth has been spoken.
---
I imagine it could involve grinding mobs in a non-human zone location; the humanoids in Elwynn weren't easy to get kills on. Maybe you'd have good luck in another zone, though?
---
Classic at its basic level is about community and interactions between players. Also I got out of the starter zone within 45 mins as a nelf hunter.
---
Because functioning in a foreign language is exhausting, even when you're immersed in the language. Most people already have to deal with English to some degree in their 9-5. I can absolutely see how when somebody gets home and sits down in front of their computer to relax, their not up for another few hours of having to function in English, they want their mother toung.
---
Daaaamn dude, this is the first I've seen this list. Hope it gets resolved soon. Seems like hunters are always one of the jankier classes when it comes to bugs.
---
When I played it back in the day I absolutely loved it for the reasons you said. But everybody these days are in a hurry they don’t enjoy the journey just the endgame. So I was curious.
---
&gt; For you.
---
For anyone that's not a no-lifer who will spend 6-10 hours a day online.  Or...ya know...a majority of the playerbase lol.
---
&gt; 3K people was a sacrifice made due to hardware limitations, not because they thought it was a good number.
---
A good limit doesn't exist.  The world is a static size with static resources.  You can up the limit but that just means every resource is that much scarcer.  And you still probably won't make a dent in the queue of people waiting to get on.
---
You seem to think I'm the one being selfish here when you would rather everyone else not be able to play because they don't have hours to waste sitting in a queue or fighting to tag mobs.
---
And everybody clapped.
---
* 1.12 is the earliest version of AV they have. They aren't going to spend any time or resources re-developing content just because you want it. WoW Classic is all about the bottom line. The only reason it's even happening is because it's relatively easy and cheap.
---
* Layering is a better alternative than insane queue times, dead servers, and realm mergers. Yes, it has some issues, but that's why Blizzard is testing it.
---
* Blizzard has a much better idea how how many people will end up playing Classic than the rest of us. Their research shows there simply aren't enough players to sustain enough realms in the EU to allow for individual language realms. It's that simple.
---
Even if you disagree with me, that's exactly the point. The community completely disagrees on what's best for the game, which is why they should never be allowed to make any of the decisions.
---
Was it inconsistent like that?  Sometimes the mob doesn't let you click if it has no loot, sometimes it does and what the OP said happens.
---
Man this sub ain't big enough to be on a 3 day repost cycle yet get outta here
---
Talk to me when you're on a tipsout deep dive.
---
I don't think it will be too slow. DOTA, while conceptually unique to WoW, is similarly meticulous and paced slower than most games.
---
I think today's popular games being quicker is an offset of technology and our lives being faster-paced in general. You still see slow, methodical games reach critical popularity (Dark Souls, Witcher, Skyrim is about to be released on its ten thousandth platform), so I don't think people have an aversion to slow games.
---
There are literally more private servers specifically for every European language than there will be official Classic servers for them. Just think about it. If you want you can roll on a German, French or Polish private server any day.
---
Its not just this mechanic. Most group content is going to suck if you only play 2 hours max.
---
You do you man! ALso, If we end up on the same server, I'll vouch a raid spot for you
---
So if I don't like the problem I have to accept any solution? What kind of logic is that?
---
I like iron forge, but I would love to see a rendition for stormwind
---
No, if they thought it was an outright exploit they would have remove it entirely. They only removed it for the first month of new raids in an attempt to preserve the challenge of the content and allow people an even playing field.
---
Yes. Most are going horde, and virtually all are going pvp. 
---
Rolling horde on a PVE server is a solid option. Sure no world pvp, but most PVE players are alliance so should be short BG Ques!
---
Its Joana thats the WR holder right? See you in STV fucko
---
Lol okay. See you in game.
---
Honestly, I'm sad they're not doing language servers because I thought it would be a good way to improve my French. I had a friend who did an exchange in Germany and he was planning on rolling on the German server to work on his German. This whole English only server thing is just all kinds of fail.
---
That’s the best part, there’s the journey and the end game, the journey can be as long or longer than your end game, or rush to endgame.. it’s whatever we want it to be. 
---
If people have an issue with it, then it’s just not for them :)
---
Yes, Social Services its this post right here.
---
&gt; They're also choosing to ignore that Blizz is using layers to solve the initial population surge and have stated multiple times that layers will be disabled completely after things settle down a bit.
---
And what if things never settle down to the point they're expecting? What if Classic explodes in popularity just like WoW originally did and we reach the end of phase one with layered megaservers with populations of several normal servers?
---
I'm not saying this will happen or even that there's any great likelihood of it, but it is a possibility. And Blizzard is once again setting themselves up to be caught with their pants down if it does.
---
All of which is completely beside the point of the way in which sharding/layering/whatever-they're-calling-it-this-week fundamentally screws with server community and cohesion, which lie at the very foundation of the MMO genre.
---
It's only beta everyone, nothing to worry about /s
---
That's the lesser problem, imgaine if it turns out to be it when you're close to 60.
---
A couple of thousand? They instantly sold out of all 50k-100k copies they planned to sell within months, not days. (those days a game selling 15m+ copies within 24-48 hours was unheard of). WoW was a massive hit right out the gate, and demand for it was unprecedented at the time.
---
Spanish speaker here.
---
Italian and spanish are both equal. Except if we are talking about formalism, then spanish wins. 
---
But there is a language fancier than both, it's called French. It's italian but boosted. 
---
Vive la France!
---
I'm experiencing that too.    
---
What's funny is that this was a bug in vanilla too. Specifically when a mob had a quest item with a chance to drop (but didn't drop it). It was fixed server side in vanilla. It seems to have crept back in.

Right. "umad" being the only comeback you have is unsurprising from someone who can't even recognize PR talk from one of the most infamous bullshitters the franchise has ever had. 
---
The naivity some of you people display makes me understand how nigerian scammers are still a thing. You're all very educational.
---
I for one am counting the days.
---
The client auto translates the items on the beta when you click on them, we have a few Chinese on beta and the links work fine.
---
I'm starting to think this is the devs way of keeping people from rolling hunters.
---
Testing on pserver is a night and day different experience with regards to the Hunter deadzone and the pets compared to the Classic beta... I doubt we will see the pets fixed and their amazing AI back like they used to have during Vanilla and it looks like the deadzone being 11yards instead of 8 is here to stay because of how wonky the retail engine
---
Right, or says your criticism is invalid because you haven't memorized the entire PowerPoint presentation. 
---
I don't need to explain every little intricacy about layering, you can see the effects and downsides of it on the front page of this very subreddit over and over.
---
I would so be okay with the naming rules from RP servers being enforced everywhere.
---
I did a realm transfer a couple months into TBC back in the day. Also not sure when they introduced the option.
---
The thing you have to realize it's that every layer has players in it. The number of layers is based on the number of players, and they're going to be relatively evenly distributed (in general, if not in a specific area). You're not completely escaping competition if you change layers. You're just changing who you're competing with. Finding a resource node on one layer doesn't guarantee that node will be active in all layers. Further, a larger playerbase needs more total resources anyway. There's a reason private servers that had huge player caps took measures to increase resource node spawns. This is not fundamentally different from that. During Vanilla there were realms with drastically different numbers of players and therefore different economies. There is no single ideal WoW server economy that servers magically converge onto.
---
What? How?
---
Now it will be be xxGoTCharacterNamexx
---
So yea, let's add a 20 minute CD timer on it...?
---
Wut?
---
I know I'll already have a hard time actually pulling off a successful group content with a 2 hour window.  I sure as hell don't want that window shortened.  And it's not like 2 hours is the absolute max, it will just usually be the max.  There will be time on fridays/weekends that I can play for longer stints.
---
Soda deserves to get camped until he rerolls to a PvE server.
---
Teach them to walk with their mouse and utilize keybindings. Might as well start them off right lol
---
I wasnt having trouble targeting a specific mob.  I was having trouble targeting *any* mob
---
The game game feels pretty much complete already. I doubt they will make any significant changes.

Nah MoP was good, and then we got new lead devs going into WoD who we've been stuck with since and happen to be terrible.

---
I decided to give asmon a go as I never really watched him before but hes constantly in the spotlight.
---
It was pretty enjoyable for the first 15 minutes or so. At this point he was waiting for the AV servers to come online. Just kind of chillin, talking and watching YouTube videos. He didnt seem all that bad, as usual I'm sure it's just a case of hate him or love him from either side.
---
Then the AV servers went online. Holy shit, does asmon rage out at the smallest things. At one point he was just constantly yelling and in a shit mood because things weren't going his way. Every time he died he bitched about lag or how he got ganked unfairly in AV because no one was helping him.
---
I just switched to Sonii's stream and it was way more chill. He never raged once about anything.
---
Asmongold pretty consistently criticizes it outside of starting zones.
---
He's making up bullshit based on literally nothing.
---
Thanks dude. If we do, I'll certainly take you up on it! :)
---
Are you seriously arguing semantics? ARe you that fucking thick?
---
**"I do want to reiterate that WE'VE STATED that it'd be for early zones and wouldnt be a long term thing"**
---
Seriously just shut the fuck up, I'm so sick of people just dancing around like retards about such obvious shit.
---
Its right there plain as fucking day, a Blizzard employee paid to be the voice of the company to the consumer stating "WE'VE STATED" that it would be limited to the early zones.
---
Fuck off, your dumbass stated "They said it was time based. Not zone based. Why make up lies?" which is without question an actual fucking lie so shut the fuck up and move on.

There's a reason why AV was changed very quickly in vanilla, 1.5 AV actually lasted less time than 1.11 AV did.
---
Layering, well we knew they were going to do something about the initial population rush besides just let there be massive server crashes, queues and or dead servers.
---
*every night elf hunter during launch*
---
Yup, and normally I squeeze them to the minimum char limit, but I found the macros hard to read when I wrote this. I broke them up so they'd be easier to explain. Check my new edit for a really condensed macro.
---
Seems like the issue is that he left too much weasel room.
---
And I don't think you'll see him come back and confirm "It'll be no longer than a month, guaranteed".
---
I studied French for 10 years.... couldn't string a sentence together lol
---
I don't think German is going to happen.
---
Well yeah, it's all up to speculation, but I imagine the number of people who play on private servers because there's no monthly subscription to pay is greater than the number of people who don't play on private servers because it involves piracy and there's some assembly required. 
---
Playing classic involves a monthly fee and supporting a company scorned by many for having ruined the game for them. For someone who plays on a private server they'd have to get over their dislike for Blizzard **and** be willing to pay to play the game for as long as they wish to play the game.
---
Isn't layering supposed to only be up for the start, though?
---
Does it REALLY matter in the long run?
---
Maybe they should really just disable it in 30+ zones
---
Wait...I thought Arthas was the lich king?
---
Oh I’m sure they will, but as said, it’s far better to have too few servers with the option to bring more online than to have too many and have low pop/dead servers when the inevitable population shrink happens.
---
You might be able to if you elect to be the winters chill mage for pve. As the spec for pvp isnt vastly different that deep into frost
---
So I can't devote the entire 2 hour window to a meaningful dungeon one night?  And do some farming/questing/banking another night?
---
Jesus, enough with the gate keeping.  If you think 2-hours a day isn't enough time to garner enjoyment from the game, then I think you should open your blinds and get some sun.
---
&gt; 6 languages, 3 server types. Thats only 18 servers.
---
It's not that simple. Not all the supported languages and regions have all server types even in Retail. Portugal doesn't even have a PVP server.
---
The announcement said "several" realms were planned for EU. Based on the fact that Germany (20% of the EU playerbase) isn't getting even one, I really think it's only going to be 2 PVP, 2 PVE, and 1 RP at best.

---
So, reading this gave me autism... and I think I love it.
---
Lost my shit at Durotar Jack 😂😂
---
I agree that 20 minutes would be a bit much.  Personally, I don't really think layering is all that bad for the starting zones, but to say that this is all blind hate just isn't accurate.  It shouldn't be this easily abused, especially in areas like STV where people are jumping layers and getting 6 or 7 chests from the gurubashi arena in like 10 minutes.
---
Everything needs to be us vs them in 2019 I guess.  Pretty dumb.
---
Once the plebs got access to the beta they only have 48 hours to find problems like big daddy and soda have. As result you have a bunch of posts of people complaining so they can feel important too. Be kind.
---
If I remember right the night elf zone's first quest is a kill quest, not collecting wolf meat like the other two.
---
People were actively not grouping up because they knew it would keep them from progressing.
---
What do you think they should do?
---
I'd noticed the deadzone was all over the place too.  I haddn't tried it in PvP yet, but in PvE I had no why of telling where it started.  Pretty frustrating.
---
I don't know about "xaxa" but "jaja" is almost the same as "haha".
---
William Murderface Murderface  Murderface voice: 
---
"That's a good problem to have."
---
Yeah, you can do: /castsequence reset=6 Shield Block, Revenge, Revenge, Revenge, Revenge
---
The downside to /castsequence is that it won't activate multiple things that are off the GCD in one press, like /cast can. You can combine the two, however, and get both effects.
---
We'll just have to dissagree. IMO Cat ruined the game, and anything after that is a ruined game.
---
Also r/iamverybadass
---
The devs that think it good idea to gut and prune the classes and developer small linear zones deserve it.
---
I prefer the vast open zones of vanilla , BC and WotLK and how awesome the classes were with their utility and differences.
---
It's annoying me why one fear icon doesn't have the golden ring around when you cast it
---
I'm reserving that name of I can
---
Vanilla servers were more like 15k-20k subs with 2.5k-3k concurrent. But you’re not factoring in attrition after one year to avoid dead servers. If they’re targeting 20k subs per server after one year on 5 servers, it’s 100k scaled by the attrition rate. If they think 20% of players stick around to Phase 3+, that’s 500k players, or 1.5m total at launch. If it’s 10 servers, that’s 3m at launch. If it’s projected to be closer to 10% instead of 20%, that’s 6m worldwide at launch, which matches their mid-Vanilla numbers.
---
It’s easy to tweak the variables to generate a narrative. It’s hard to accurately forecast them when making decisions.
---
I was merely highlighting that originally, in classic, they had determined language realms even in the EU, and if they were going full classic experience that could reoccur us all.
---
Can’t wait for this thread about a very serious core issue to the game to get buried under stream man bad posts
---
Tis my phone wallpaper
---
I never said it would be total shit. I just don't see why they want to replicate the language barriers on PS when it didn't exist on actual vanilla.
---
Ironforge.
---
Will you play with me? This is also my biggest concern.
---
Definitely later then, Alpha builds were 0.5x
---
Swede: Did someone say Nazi gold? :)))
---
Ah the average horde player i see.
---
Okay, I will enjoy the broken layering because it will be gone after a few weeks :) you’re getting a quite worked up over something that is temporary.
---
And how does that help the switching layer problem?
---
It's not only people who don't like pirating and people who can't figure out how to set it up. Its also all the people who didn't even know it existed because there is no real advertising for it. An official version by blizzard simply gets seen by way more eyes than something underground like a private server.
---
I'm interested to see which way it swings, for sure.
---
I'll think about what I can do to break it up some
---
All streamers do tbh.
---
That surprised face on the left, LOL.
---
Lol, yup. I actually had a decent pc st the time, but I remember having to go to cities on multiple friends accounts because they couldn’t load up stormwind or ironforge.
---
I've never seen an elemental vanilla mage actually work in practice. 
---
I think AP/Frost is more viable than that.
---
Assuming we're going back to Classic lore, a combination of Nerzul and Arthas' consciousnesses are currently the Lich King, but when Arthas is defeated in WOTLK, Bolvar dons the Helm of Domination and becomes the new Lich King.
---
Yup I have a weekend trip in September so I’ll rack up some and then hit it hard after
---
Sorry guys I’m brand new to the game and to this subreddit and I know this definitely isn’t where I should be asking, but where can I post about getting information about Horde? 
---
My older brother played wow when I was very young, and he told me recently that Classic is being released and I should play with him and his old friends he played with. His old username was “Phyrexian” and he was an undead mage. I don’t know too much about him as a player, but he told me he was very good and someone might recognize the name. 
---
Sorry about going off on a tangent there, but I just would like general information about the Horde classes and races. He instructed me to join Horde with him and his friends, so I’d like to make sure I don’t hold them back at all. 
---
Any help is appreciated! Feel free to let me know where these questions should be posted.
---
Someone can make a killing off a translator add-on
---
it's ok guys, they'll get reported and silenced.
---
it's  a social game after all.
---
:)
---
And who defines when "a few weeks in" is? How long does "just for the initial rush" last?
---
These sort of vague, ill-defined time frames are given *literally every time* anyone talks about layering, and I guaran-goddamn-TEE you that is entirely by design. They've always been very careful never to give anything that could be reasonably thought of as any sort of hard date specifically so it can't later be held against them.
---
Again, you're getting laywer'd. And you're eating it up as if it's a legally binding contract.
---
It's not.
---
I don't play betas, nor have I followed WoW for a long time, not even before BFA or Legion. And the Classic team has earned the benefit of the doubt.
---
That makes total sense. Thanks again for the post! I think macros are too often overlooked for just how much better they can make you perform. Especially in vanilla with stances, forms, etc being more complicated.
---
Great job!
---
What I'm saying is that if there's eg. 3 PvP servers, 2 PvE servers and an RP server, what are they gonna do? If Germans flock to one of the servers and the French on another, the end result will be barely any different for the rest of the playerbase.
---
I mean, there could be more realms than that, but we really don't know. I'm half expecting the realm number Blizz is planning to be ridicilously low, because if they were planning on having like 20+ realms per region then *surely* they could spare one or two of those to be language-specific realms and RPPvP realms.
---
They already said that layering was temporary with it 100% being off by the time the world bosses phase releases. I do think disabling layering after a certain level even early on would be good as well as limiting it to cities only similar to the pvp changing system in current retail so that you can't do things like this.
---
Don’t worry, you’re right.
---
here you go!
---
It's not about it "failing". I think they just have a realistic expectation of how many people will play beyond the initial novelty.
---
Hunter's can feign death swap trinkets, there is an addon for it, makes it really easy and also a weapon swapping addon.
---
so italians, portuguese and spanish shouldn't get their own servers since they didn't have any in classic?
---
So the philosophy is to do the opposite of what people want?  What is the philosophy of vanilla?  The layering will allow people to get past the quests that require collecting items for each players.  It'll be gone before you know it, and everyone will have found a different non-issue to rant and rave about.
---
Again I have to point out that I'm getting downvoted for contributing to the discussion, albeit by saying things that some people disagree with.  Reddit is a lost cause, discourages minority opinion
---
&gt; Layering - CRZ on a single realm
---
No, that's not at all what it is. At best, it's Sharding on a continent-wide scale.
---
I'll be speed-leveling my main and taking my time with my alts. 
---
I have a raiding guild lined up and everything. 
---
I think that's what a lot of people plan to do.

All I picture is Sheldon from Big Bang fighting comic book guy from Simpson’s
---
If they ever force an upgrade to BC it completely defeats the whole purpose of Wow Classic. They either maintain snapshots of each version of the game for as long as the servers or up, or they shouldn't even bother.
---
 They already said that layering was temporary with it 100% being off by the time the world bosses phase releases or at least that's what I read.

Yep - as an attorney Ion knows “a few” can mean whatever they want it to mean. If they intended to end it after 2 weeks, they would just say 2 weeks.

You got me!

Changing the meta isn’t a bad thing on its face
---
That's a really good way to look at it actually. Thank you.
---
What I imagine *everytime* I use Fade on my Priest
---
Yes it is a kill quest, but even then I generally skip it and just go for grinding till 3.
---
I don't know if I like having 4-6 abilities in one button, I feel like it would confuse me and I just don't like it for some reason. 
---
Maybe I'm just an old man. I do like the "if this then that" kind of macros. 
---
Don't know if it works in classic but when I played Warlock in vanilla my favorite macro was a simple one that just told your pet to attack a target, but if it was already attacking a target it told the pet to follow you instead.
---
You mean at least until phase 2 like they said, so months
---
So they had players in the thousands logging in during original launch, and I firmly believe they will have *millions* logging in day 1 of classic. Thanks for confirming my point.
---
Sorry, I wanted to quiz one of the people who actually believe that WoW will be an aleatoric wonderworld where everything is possible, if only they'd open all the floodgates.
---
Meanwhile in the stress test everyone was just sitting there refusing to group up so that maybe they'd get a hit on the next wolf to spawn.
---
Sounds like they should fix the exploit by removing layering.
---
Big true
---
Just in case it could be the issue:
---
Heroic Strike on retail is an instant ability, in classic/vanilla it buffs your next attack, so you have to click it and wait for your swing timer.
---
Heroic Strike modifies your next auto-attack, so it's not a skill that is executed when you press it. So when you use it, you should expect to see it execute the next time your character swings for an auto-attack.
---
I admire your passion.
---
People need to stop being racist and accept multiculturalism
---
Erm... The biggest (and only) german p-server Nefarian is closing its door because the staff does not want to have beef with blizzard when classic goes live... That population alone will fill a whole crowded server. And now count that girls and guy in that want to play but do not go to privat servers because they say "It is verboten!" "Blizz will sue my little player for p-server gaming!"
---
"Blizz will send the police and bring me to guantanamo!" which is ridiculus but that is still a laaarge group of german players.
---
That's because players don't know shit about game development.
---
I dont like moderated reddits
---
&gt; but to say that this is all blind hate just isn't accurate. It shouldn't be this easily abused, especially in areas like STV where people are jumping layers and getting 6 or 7 chests from the gurubashi arena in like 10 minutes.
---
I agree, perhaps a bad use of the term "blind hate".  There are legitimate reasons to not want layering.  The only "solution" we should be offering up is to get layering out of the game ASAP.  It's needed for the starting areas, not for the whole game.
---
The way I see it is this:  Layering (or sharding, or w/e you wanna call it), is needed for a smooth launch.  I for one would like to be able to play the game when it launches.  What I don't understand is the 100% die hard "NO LAYERING" guys, who fail to see how terrible the launch experience will be without it.  That's the "blindness" I was trying to comment on.
---
Italian is way sexier. The lisp just ruins Spanish, so I guess you're right so long as it's not being spoken by an actual Spaniard.
---
&gt;months
---
I give layering about 48 hours
---
if streamers can cruise to best in slot with no work, why can't the rest of us?
---
Alliance lore is way better. Unless you really enjoy making totems and spirit dust for 50 levels.
---
0 in savage strikes ..  lol
---
And now, just weeks later, there aren't that many watching either.
---
Do you have a source on that?
---
Every interview I've seen has stated "a few weeks" or "just for the initial rush." They've been very careful never to give hard numbers like you're citing specifically so their words can't be used against them later.
---
Yeah, they had the beta for WoW over a decade ago. No layering.
---
I know they said there would be no race changes, but I didnt see anything in realm transfers. I wouldnt be surprised either way they went.
---
Retail is hardly dying whatever people want to think, several some YouTubers pull in 250k views in 24 hours for bfa content
---
Like it or not, the game is launching with layering enabled.  They need to test it.  This is a beta for them to test this feature on.  Your opinion about whether layering should even exist is completely separate from this.
---
People are downvoting in a thread titled “Unpopular opinion”. I can’t wait for these cuties to get to lvl 20.
---
The go-to response is “it’s only a few weeks after launch”
---
A few weeks is enough time for 
---
- no-lifers to hit 60 and farm 8 layers worth uncontested
---
- most people to be hitting STV, making pvp unsatisfying with the amount of layer hopping
---
- loads of hunters to tame rare pets
---
- loads of people to farm 8x the amount of tidal charms
---
And on, and on, and on.
---
People acting like a few weeks is no big deal have no idea how hardcore the Classic community is.
---
People will get used to it, always gather up in an inn then head out together is much more fun anyway.
---
True, WS is nice. But compared to axe spec, bloodfury, AND 25% chance to resist stun, can't compare. Tbh I was torn for a while but fuck it. RP&gt;minmax
---
Eh, depending on where you live and how your upbringing was, the official version might be the one that's underground.
---
sick
---
No, layering doesn't solve that problem. But it's not supposed to. Layering's only supposed to solve the problem of servers being full at launch and then dead two months later.
---
There's guilds that raid at odd hours. It would be harder to find one that works with your schedule, but it's not necessarily impossible.
---
Damn fucking straight.
---
Layering is needed because they think 80% of the population to quit
---
Maybe people would stay if it wasn't for stupid shit like this
---
You wouldn't be able to, that's the entire point. You *shouldn't* be able to.
---
I never got tired of MC. Even when we progressed past it, when we had nothing else to do, we went back to MC. We would take fresh (green) 60s and get them geared out and ready for BWL. If the loot wasn't needed we disenchanted.
---
I feel a little embarrassed, thank you a lot !
---
I completely disagree, on the server you speak of there’s so many different people, making communicating in battlegrounds impossible. Things like having to /w 5 different mages because none of them can understand your asking to buy a portal. Having 0 deadtimes due to so many different time zones, making any gathering profession an absolute pain in the ass.
---
I feel a little embarrassed, thank you a lot ! :D
---
“But it’s only a few weeks stop whining guys”
---
Say all the Blizzard fanboys who have no idea how hardcore the Classic fan base is.
---
People will be hitting 60 in a week farming layers uncontested, and the general public will be in STV while layers are still active, ruining what many consider to be the best part of the levelling experience.
---
Pogmongold babyyyyyy. Twitch prime.
---
Game is going to have less players with this bs layering, than if servers are full couple days and leveling is hard couple weeks with normal servers. People still want to play the game like crazy even the layering is removed.
---
Hopefully it's fixed again before august. It's not necessarily gamebreaking, but if there was something else on the corpse like a green drop for instance or a traveller's backpack I'm sure it would be pretty important to not bug out.
---
The biggest difference comes in when you switch zones. With sharding, if you're fighting a mob or another player at the edge of a zone, your target could disappear simply because they entered another zone's shard. This won't happen with Layering because the entire continent is in the same "shard". Obviously there are still some kinks to work out, but this is the main reason to choose layering over sharding in Classic where the zone borders aren't nearly as isolated as they are in Retail.
---
Me too please!
---
I thought the English guy was trolling, but all of their names are kinda nationalistic in some way or another. At least there is an argument to be made that they are. Except maybe the English guy's name, lol.
---
If the population stays the same after two weeks they are not getting rid of layering.
---
This subreddit has a Discord LFG channel.
---
They've said they don't *want it* to last that long. Whenever they talk about time frames they always use vague, ill-defined terms: "a few weeks," "just for the initial rush," etc. The only time they've ever given any sort of concrete detail is when they said layering won't extend into phase 2. Which means it could very well remain active all the way through phase 1.
---
They're lawyering the everloving fuck out this and people are eating it up as if it were a signed and notarized contract. It's not.
---
Going to have the option to ask for mats at the end of raids. If it’s being used for something to help the raid (gear for a raider) loot council will decide if it’s worth the mats. 
---
All remaining mats will go into the guild bank alts. Will update a viewable google doc on Tuesdays with current items and a withdrawal/deposit list. Which guild members will be able to petition on discord what they need. 
---
This gives raiders prio on mats over non raiding guild mates. But still gives non raiders a chance to craft raid craftables. 
---
Ony cloaks will be distributed by loot council based on attendance and performance. 
---
Will have one skinner and one miner in raid that will post what was gathered at raid end with the loot master.
---
Are we back in the "this sub is so toxic" arc ? :\^)
---
See I've heard of mobs just dropping no loot, which would be fine if that were the case instead of being teased with a loot window just to have the carpet yanked out from under you lol
---
There isn't really a difference.
---
It's basically just servers that are "layers". So instead of playing with the same people across multiple servers, you're playing with the same people across multiple layers.
---
The only difference might be name exclusion since there isn't a realm suffix distinction.
---
That’s basically me on a pserver... I have a 33 mage, 30 warlock, 31 hunter, and now leveling a 16 rogue and 18 priest... can’t decide for classic...
---
Pservers often has strict rules about English only in /1 and /2 and which affects the other parts of the game.
---
I'd be happy to play with you. I made lots of friends playing, but the real fulfillment came from sharing those experiences with people I get to share real life experiences with. I'm grown up and I run a business now, so the odds of finding anybody in my small circle that wants to play will be difficult. All my friends that plan with me or I'll now long gone and nothing but Facebook friends. I don't expect any of them to play again. The only reason I'm playing is to reflect on that time in my life, and allow my brain to remember the good times that we had when life was so much more simple. I also want to reflect on where I am now, as I know this game gave me a lot of skill sets that I have made me very successful. There's was a time in my life where my dream was to retire and just play this game, but my life goals have really changed and are actually much focused on seeking fulfillment.
---
&gt;How does that picture in any way proof for zone based?
---
For non retards those words who can read its actually spelled out.
---
&gt;"I do want to reiterate that WE'VE STATED that it'd be for **EARLY ZONES** and wouldnt be a long term thing"
---
See that part where they say "EARLY ZONES" how ambiguous is that? You need it fucking dumbed down further?
---
Less than 1% lol. No. You’re straight up wrong please just go back to retail. We’re trying to make this game better while we can and we don’t need idiots who are unfamiliar with Classic actively fighting against us
---
I mentioned Savage Strikes and yes, would personally take it over Clever Traps, but it's not so black and white a decision.
---
&gt;  I doubt we will see the pets fixed
---
I keep seeing posts like this.  "It's like this in the beta, so I doubt it'll be fixed".  What on earth
---
Sounds good
---
More than likely the layers are clusters that spool up when the load balancer asks for it.
---
That is not what you said. You implied that people constantly only whine how buggy pservers are and wanted to make people look stupid for suddenly wanting to implement some features from them. Thats why i needed to clarify for you that even though people find lot of problems from product it doesn't mean there could not be parts that they would like. If you want to know why people want to implement language barriers from pservers you should ask that instead of trying to be smartass.
---
OP's post is a rare moment of sanity
---
WHere is the Mail box?
---
Isn't layering a temporary thing though? I thought it was supposed to only last through "phase 1"?
---
AFAIK, cartographer will not run on Classic Client - maybe I am wrong.
---
We're talking about playing WoW on a mobile device. It's a solution to a problem.
---
There's been no developer that said it would be for the early zones. They did state it was short-term which means it's time based. Basically they are expecting a huge flood of retail people to make characters and eventually give up leveling or stop playing all together.
---
We're all leveling on PvE servers now :)
---
Oh yes! Don’t we all remember that amazing fun pvp experience in STV where your enemy suddenly vanished infront of you to a different layer?
---
It's extremely fun (in my own opinion)! I'd even say its more fun than BfA shaman. I can off-tank while dungeoning/leveling I can do huge burst as ele/enhance, I can heal/support with resto and totems. Give your group nice buffs depending on the situation. 
---
The totems are a much bigger part of being a shaman in classic. Accidentally pull a few too many mobs? There's totems for that. Need some extra healing/mana/strength/etc? Theres totems for that. Diseases and Rogue poisons getting annoying? Theres totems for that. Trying to keep distance between you and an enemy or catch up? Totems for that. And dont get me started on weapon imbues.
---
Lightning shield is actually amazing, your shocks are huge damage insta cast and earth shock interrupts spellcasting. You can downrank spells to get a quicker cast time or if youre low on mana.
---
I've played but never gotten 60 as shaman on private server and I've also played the stress test.
---
If their plan is to make mega servers, layering is here to stay, forever.
---
This guy gets it.
---
They didn't have the foresight to see the problems and therefore couldn't imagine anyone else having foresight either. Simple arrogance.
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm, but Blizzard is the one with hard data about who plays and years worth of user surveys asking about this stuff.
---
You're also ignoring the fact that a huge factor in the popularity of private servers is that they're free. In some countries it's not even really possible to pay for retail WoW in a traditional way, in addition to people who just can't afford or refuse to pay for a monthly sub. 
---
As for the historical playerbase, the reason there are so many in that bucket is specifically because those people quit playing and never came back. And not because of changes to the game necessarily. Sometimes people just decide they're done with a game for various reasons. WoW always had massive churn. Most of the later changes Vanilla fans hate actually *increased* long term retention. Meaning without those factors, Classic is likely to also suffer high churn.
---
Anyway, Classic doesn't need 10m players to "succeed". It just needs enough to have at least like 5 medium to high pop servers per region. Blizzard doesn't think Classic will "fail" or else they literally never would have done it. For Blizzard, "success" means being a fun game people enjoy and being revenue positive at the same time.
---
shitcock
---
It wouldn’t surprise me, I remember when osrs did something similar. Releasing Aus servers that were based in the US, completely defeating the purpose of oceanic servers.
---
This is actually a really good idea. I hope they push a more sophisticated version of layering to the beta soon.
---
They 100% need to do this, or need to add simple server queues.
---
Honestly *anything* is better than layering at this point. It destroys immersion and economy, two things that Classic WoW did perfectly.
---

I always DPS mained but I want to main a healer priest in classic so I can "give back". 
---
Also so I can't get into groups.
---
I simply want people to say, "hey that guy is a great healer let's inv him".
---
Dude, there’s a whole wide world of languages. Just because “us Americans “ speak English doesn’t mean shit to a global game. Pull your head out of your ass.
---
No need to! Part of the fun of jumping in is discovering the mechanical differences and quirks that have morphed and changed over the years.
---
I think classic is more aimed at casuals that enjoyed the experience of vanilla. 
---
I was a casual raider in vanilla and I'm anxious to get that back. Sure, I raided but the social experience is completely different than retail.
---
Maybe just have the upcoming level one colour and then all following levels a darker colour. Typically when using this I think 90% of what you care about is just what's available at the next level up.
---
So again, you can't join friends on another layer?
---
To be honest the easy solution is what others have suggested. 
---
Split the servers into “Illidan 1” “Illidan 2”, 3, 4, 5, 6 etc. at launch and then just merge them later on. Since the server is preplanned you don’t even need to worry about name overlap. 
---
What I SUSPECT is that the modern architecture is built around sharding and literally can’t handle 30,000 players. 
---
I also suspect they were introducing it as limited sharding “at launch” to try and get players acclimated before they implemented it on a permanent basis. 
---
Things like the AQ opening in particular are going to be stupid.
---
&gt;It's sad that your live hasn't been totally consumed by hype culture
---
Truly one of the saddest moments in modern history :\^)
---
Yeah, I have similar memories about different games doing that..
---
There were french servers on the very first day. Even open beta french servers
---
Would be great if this was stickied, I'd be interested in seeing how this develops as the beta continues and into the live release.
---
You mean you kill him every Tuesday reset, right Bobby b ?
---
&gt;just go for grinding
---
You want the strength of the game's opening weekend to rely on people who are willing to skip Vanilla WoW's major innovation?  I think that will solve any overpopulation issues for sure.
---
If you don't hate totem mechanics, it's a blast. You can bring tons of utility to groups, you can walk on water and turn into a GHOST WOLF, return from the dead, and you can heal/dps pretty effectively as the same spec if you choose to do the eleresto spec. Or you can smang dudes with a big club as Enhancement. I like it all.

You can always go smaller than the one he got made as well.
---
This has been shown to still happen, although I'm assuming you know this, hence your "kinks to work out" comment
---
Exactly. The current sub count proves my point more than words ever could.
---
You are a class act... using a my reply to a comment that got removed because it was harassment, lol.
---
Im not asking for instant gratification.  I'm telling you that without layering then the MAJORITY of the playerbase will be sitting in queue or fighting to tag mobs at launch.
---
Also I'm telling you that adding a 20 min CD to grouping up with people is a fucking terrible "solution" to layer abuse.
---
This sub has had an incredibly consistent stream of bait posts the last few days. It's ridiculous.
---
I’ve only played retail sparingly, but have been really interested in playing Classic when it releases. Everyone I’ll potentially play with has warned me how much of a grind it will be, but I’ve got 3500 hours on my OSRS account. I think I’ll be good.
---
Sorry Bobby b , I’ve been busy helping tortollans reach the water .
---
I mean if you have to skip 1 quest to get ahead of the pack its probably worth. I got out of the starting zone after 45 mins after that pretty much every quest I did was uncontested.
---
DO YOU THINK IT'S HONOR THAT'S KEEPING THE PEACE?! IT'S FEAR! FEAR AND BLOOD!
---
Hello there
---
Actually it does. I'm from northern Europe and English is the universal language.
---
I actually generally agree with you. Take my druid's macro, for example. It might seem like a lot of abilities all thrown together with modifiers. However, all of my forms have access to shift to cast heal/damage, and so it's actually very consistent. I always downrank my spells with control, across all my forms, and it's the same spell in each position across all my forms. 
---
I don't have 4 healing spells on one button, but I always have my healing touch on button 1 in every form, and I can always make it more or less powerful by pressing shift/control.
---
The only time I fold a lot of random spells together is for noncombat stuff like buffs, where I can afford to flick my through my modifiers to find what I need. In that case, the only real benefit is saving UI space.
---
I think you're playing dota wrong bro.
---
Yeah, it affects my decision. I'd probably go druid either way, but I don't want to be one among a sea of rogues or mages. It is fulfilling for me to express my skill in a particularly remarkable or uncommon way. I'd love to be the guy where people say, whoa, look at that guy putting in work on the underdog class
---
&gt;one autistic boy ruins game for millions
---
Shut it down boys, it's over! :\^)
---
Everyone under the age of 35 speaks english in europe.
---
Well if there are only 6 realms, I think we have much bigger problems: Layering. Like each realm probably would have dozens of layers. It's gonna be a complete clusterfuck.
---
Whats probably gonna happen is that the germans announce the servers they'll play on and then the french choses a server too (or more depending on how many they provide) and then the rest will most likely just avoid those servers because the chances that you end up on a server with very little people you can communicate with would push other off.
---
Hey guys im a bfa player. I've never played vanilla but trust me when i say vanilla needs sharding or it will fail. Interracting with too many players at once feels too mmo'ish. Sharding is Good for a mmo. Just imagine having to adabt your playstile around other players. /s
---
Layering needs to go away. Just introduce it for the first couple days of launch and then can it. If layering exist after the first month of release then Blizzard has failed to deliver the vanilla experience.
---
But what if someone has my name?
---
yeah in fact there are 81 million people in China who are speaking English now.
---
Doesn't matter, the layering will be a dumpster fire that gets exploited heavily for both personal gains and to avoid PvP etc.  It will result in active servers appearing to have fewer people in the world and will damage world pvpers experiences.  
---
Despite the constant outcry against layering Blizzard will continue it's path under the impression they know what players want better than the players do, and ultimate send the game and this sub on an Anthem like spiral.... Or to quote another recent saying which bears all of the meaning in the world to this factor... " You think you do, but you don't.". 
---
The layering is going to not only damage the PvP aspect of the original game, it's going to damage the community and PVE aspect of the game.  In many situations where a group would have formed (by spontaneous development) for common objectives (creating social aspects), will now be a desperate at times search to find help when alone that may have come naturally as people won't be able to see your struggle and vice versa.  This was a staple of the original wow experience. 
---
Layering is the single most destructive thing Blizzard can do to this client.  It's all because of a few hour window as people spread out right at the beginning of the game, instead of the obvious solution of creating servers as required like before.  Yet people are being rediculous and selfish in saying that not having to wait an extra few minutes in the begining for a quest is more important than the quality of play and content in the middle and end play of game.  
---
I want the game to return, I want it badly, but I want to world PvP, and I'm currently considering not returning due to the layering and how truly damaging it will be to that. And there are many more sitting on the fence now just like me because of this.  It's not just the pvpers who are outraged at this, it's the social and PVE cores as well.
---
Since I’m lazy, are you ally/hord, NA/EU, and do you plan on playing PvE/PvE/RP?
---
I don’t get why everyone has their panties in a knot about layering, it’s TEMPORARY for phase 1 only. It’s something every player will forget even existed 6 months down the line.
---
The WoD server issues were **not** due to an inability to predict demand. They were based on a combination of a specific bug with one quest before creating the Garrison for the first time causing a massive bottleneck, and the server system not being able to handle the stress of the Garrison system itself because they'd never created a system that had to constantly open and close a private instance per player so frequently.
---
Does it work for shamans to Klick one button and cast all 4 pre set totems?
---
And can you add a timer? For example the WF totem, switch to grace of air totem then 7-8 sec cd/timer and repeat. To keep both WF and agi bonus up?
---
Its incredibly frustrating seeing someone doing something wrong to wipe the group, trying to explain to them what to do, then realizing they're from Quel/Rag/Azralon and realizing it doesn't matter what you day they simply won't understand you.
---
“Omg stfu it’s only a few weeks!”
---
Ya because we ALL want layering to be happening during the most crucial and exciting point in the game.
---
IF they keep layering for any more than a couple days, and any zones higher than lvl 20, **it will mean that the Zerg containing most of people will be levelling into the 50s together while the server is still layered.**
---
That’s unacceptable.
---
I've decided to go holy priest  in classic just to do something different.  I main Pally in retail and dont feel like buffing everyone for 5 minutes straight. 
---
The only thing I based my decision on is what my sister is going to play do we can level up together more efficiently. She's playing a warrior so I'm sure having a priest along will be beneficial
---
Lol, such entitlement.

Hunters R broke
---
Just want to note that his Elemental spec is slightly ass. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#oZVgGzbzubVVG0obt This is his spec.
---
He burns 5 points into Ice Shards whcih is totally fine *if* you actually put another 3 points into Imp. CoC which he doesn't. The only time you actually care about Ice Shards is if you wan't the very top-heavy burst from CoC otherwise it's a waste.
---
If I understod correctly he didn't see incinerate as very important you could go either that or Master of Elements. Incinerate is *very* important because the entire point with Elemental mage is to stack crit and get massive burst potential. Fire spec alone should give 10% base crits on fire blast and scorch (why pick imp fireblast without Incinerate?).
---
Imp. Scorch you can live without but it is extremely good for adding dispelblocks.
---
This is a semi-standard Imp CoC: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#oZVgMzf0uZVVG0obth
---
Personally i'd prefer to get a point into imp. blizzard due to it being insanely good.
---
This is fire with Frost only as control: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#oZVgRzf0uhV0Ghkbt

I actually ordered mine and it's coming next week! I'm glad to see it looks awesome outside of just theory.

Yeah. This sub is a cesspool guild essentially. I'm about to leave it tbh. Most of the "discussion" in this thread is literally the same thought that brought us to BFA... hurts my heart
---
unless you get a god pally who knows how to use blessing of sacrifice then you will never win this fight in a million years
---
Thanks Blizzard I hate it
---
I was gonna answer you but the thread was temporarily locked for whatever reason. If it was up to me the entire world would speak English. Would certainly make a Nordic Union easier.
---
Server merges kill games.
---
Absolutely do not do this.
---
You're right. It's time that we, fellow gamers, take matters into our hands! Alexa, book me a flight to Anaheim California, asap!
---
Compared to say, Bethesda, where the players are responsible for patching the game.
---
English and Mandarin are the most spoken languages on the planet, and both are considered extraordinarily difficult to learn if you’re not raised speaking them. It would make sense that most of Europe can speak it. 
---
OP telling everyone to just learn it like it’s no big deal is ridiculous.
---
I see. Still confused why they don't use the system of vanilla. Apart from the AQ event, there weren't really performance issues with that
---
On the other side there is the subscription, though. While there are many people who don’t want to touch private servers, there are also many players who play private but wouldn’t pay for official ones.
---
I don’t understand why every retail player is coming on here saying not to worry because it’s just a few weeks.
---
We’ve been playing this game for over a decade, we know exactly how crucial timing is, and layering beyond lvl 20 or over a few days will ruin the experience.

I found this addon the other day, looks really nice!! Let's you copy paste the data the addon makes into the provided Google spreadsheet and all done!

Was playing the stress test last night with my 2 year old daughter on my knee and my 6 day old son in my arm while the 7 and 9 year olds played Minecraft and my wife looked like she was going to have an aneurysm over the fact that 5 out of 6 bodies in our house were having some kind of interaction with a video game.
---
But yes, start them young.
---
My record was 1-60 (mage) in 7 days real time. 16 - 18 hours per day, in vanilla wow. Took a week off work just to do it. I made a very big bet with someone who said I couldn't do it. Come to think of it, I don't think that bastard ever paid me.
---
It's not "toxic" to want to understand the people you're grouping with.
---
Hunter or shaman is what I'd pick. Shamans find groups easy since they can heal and DPS quite effectively depending on their spec and if they have some bonus gear to support offspec. Hunters have a much easier time solo. I know personally as someone who works a rotating shift it can be tough scraping together a dungeon run on off hours so being able to heal or DPS as an ele/resto hybrid shaman is a great choice. You can basically wear the same gear and do either for a lot of content.
---
This sub is literally retarded.
---
If you think classic wow will have more than 1m subs i have magic beans to sell you
---
&gt;There's been no developer that said it would be for the early zones.
---
No developers ever say shit, how is it that half the information we get is from CMs and thats all well and good but the moment its something that make you look idiotic it doesnt count?
---
This is a Blizzard Employee (specifically a Blizzard employee paid to speak on behalf of the company) using the exact fucking words "EARLY ZONES".

Just fuck off seriously, I cant believe how people literally cant admit being wrong even when faced with literal factual evidence that they just fucking dance around everything to try and justify their dumbassery.
---
Mortal strike, flurry procs, concussion blow.  Pretty scary in BGs.  
---
Rogues too.  Premed, cheap shot, get the free combo point from initiative, blade flurry, cold blood, eviscerate (only 100 energy with your talents of the 130 if you open properly).  Instant destruction if you pop on a clothie next to a plate armor, providing they don't keep the pre-TBC-patch armor mitigation on secondary Blade Flurry targets.
---
Make this guy a moderator already.
---
Yea I think we should just launch without layering. I'm looking forward to playing in 2020 then, when the servers aren't crashing every 10 minutes :\^)
---
Bobby B at it again.
---
AV was changed because people couldn't get into the battleground and spent ages attempting to, due to afkers.. they went some backwards approach by stripping AV to make it finish quicker, rather than enforcing a better afk detection.

Not "hate it" necessarily, but realize that without their nostalgia it's not as great as they remember, or that they don't have the same free time they used to. Too many people in this sub (and, honestly, the internet in general) always feel the need to express things in their maximum extreme values when that's not really how most things work.
---
MORE THAN ONCE, I HAVE DREAMED OF GIVING UP THE CROWN!

You may or may not be able to say that jokingly in public, but if you get a good guild or group of people you play with, you can probably get away with it fine around them. Just need to get in the right one with the right number of cheese eating surrender monkeys you can talk shit with.
---
I've been in many a guild where our chat ends up being full of banter we'd never get away with repeating in other chat channels. Not sure if it is or is not still technically against the rules, but it's definitely not very enforced since I never once saw someone get punished for anything said in guild chat, even in social guilds that'd actively recruit random players. They just leave if everyone's not the sort they'd get along with.
---
I've used absolutely 0 UI addons since 2004.
---
It's a running theme for Blizzard to make a fix for something even if detrimental to the game, then keep the fix around even after the problem goes away. Like the launch experience won't matter after a few weeks, but layering will probably be around if the population stays high enough.
---
A month ago his answer was the first few weeks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYuUD0o-Nz8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=236 If you could stop spreading lies that'd be great.
---
That doesn't work. You can't have some zones layered and others not, because then you would zone into Duskwood and suddenly jump layers. 
---
Layers effect the entire continent to keep the world seamless. All of the issues we've come across have been due to deliberate exploits which might even be against ToS anyway. Removing layering anywhere just brings all the problems that layering was implemented to fix, so rather than remove it or limit **layering**, what needs to happen is a fix to **exploiting layering**.
---
You guys know that general channels and trade channels are server wide, right?
---
Oh look another thread

All I picture is Amy from big bang fighting comic book store from simpson's.

IT'S A GREAT CRIME TO LIE TO A KING!
---
I personally don't play dota, but my surface-level exposure to the game was that it's ~30 minute match experience that has the potential to last longer.
---
If that's not the case, I'd say that CS:GO is still a game with an active and engaged community, with matches that are relatively slow-paced.

This would have made the game a lot more like ffxi in terms of it's pve depth, would be cool to see them added now
---
Yes, there really ought to be a few limiting rules to Layering, never allowing it in any form of combat being the main one. I thought of a few more:
---
5. If Character A is engaged in any sort of combat, temporarily suspend Layer swapping for any and all party members until the combat is finished.
---
its not an if buddy :P
---
if you can get the group together and they aren't braindead, you'll get through the content at some point.  Its not like it was back in the day when most of the people you were playing with hadn't ever raided before due to WoW being their first mmo.  I'm willing to bed *most* of the people playing will have a pretty good idea about most of the mechanics, or will understand after a brief explaination.  
---
Content is gonna get steamrolled, but I'm more there for WPVP and the server community so I don't care either way outside of getting gear I want for pvp.
---
Massive server merges 3 weeks in. People literally not being able to play the game for 3 weeks. People being able to abuse a system for 3 weeks that we have had extreme examples of so far on a stress TEST server.
---
Wonder which one the company is going to pick...probably the system they can tweak based on the info they are getting from testing it.
---
No,  you don't have a say.  It's not your game.  Don't pay them for their product if you don't like what they're doing.
---
i'm confused by the picture. are you saying you want to go horde but prefer space goats and furries? both are alliance and came after vanilla lol
---
My hard deadline for fuck ups is the day of launch. There is no excuse after that and I get vocal

Had a chuckle

But for real, a child that young shouldn't be playing computer games.  Screens are actually VERY bad for young eyes especially at close range.  Screen time should be limited to short bursts, preferably at long range (greater than 5 feet).

Or people just didn't like the original AV very much.
---
Nah, just bring more memespecs!
---
I’m sorry Bobby B. Forgive my ignorance.
---
The layers are for entire continents though. If a player gets far enough ahead of the curve, they can use layer hopping to collect nodes in empty *zones* on crowded continents. For example, a person could layer hop from one empty Tanaris to another because the Barrens zone is so crowded that there's a shitload of Kalimdor layers.
---
I don't care if someone farms more than me.
---
THE WHORE IS PREGNANT!

Yeah my hype is in freefall and I hate it

More interesting than streamer spam which I could care less about. I am genuinely concerned, and if you don’t want to have a genuine conversation about it, you can politely fuck off.

---
Traveling to quest hubs = no XP
---
Battlegrounds or world PVP = no XP
---
Fishing &amp; professions = no XP
---
FInd an area with Elite Mobs that you can handle and give you a ton of XP each = very fast leveling
---
Right? It's like telling celebrities to stop acting or athletes to stop playing.
---
A lot will probably quit when they realize they can't hit 60 in 1-2 weeks
---
I used to play mostly late night and early morning because of my schedule. I was in a raiding guild with mostly Aussies and New Zealanders. They were a great group. However, that only happened because we could communicate with one another.
---
This isn't trying to stop things before they started, it's trying to prevent things from being fixable later. Language servers could be merged into larger servers if their populations aren't high enough, but moving people off a server won't happen and you're going to get people frustrated that they have such communication clashes. People aren't playing WoW to learn a foreign language no matter how well that might work out if they did
---
come on dude, do you even main a hunter? you do realize and understand how bad the pets AI is right now even in retail BFA .....
---
So yeah I'm not holding my breath for them to fix the pet AI
---
It's been a long standing conspiracy theory in this sub that anyone who wasn't 100% all positive all the time was secretly a retail WoW player trying to... I don't know, convince Blizzard to cancel Classic? It's never been logical or made sense. Some people just need an "other" to hate.
---
For you, it's worth it.  For how many people, especially those who are really unfamiliar, will it be worth it?
---
HolyReck is a great spec in the first months of the game before there is a lot of spell damage gear.  You are an AMAZING support player and honestly you can completely change a battle all by yourself with your heals and blessings.  Once AQ comes/BWL comes out you can get those tier sets and possibly move to a Shockadin build with 31/--/-- as your talents and seal of crusader ---&gt;HoJ---&gt;seal of command---&gt;divine favor---&gt;holy shock  (add the charm trinket to that with your spell dmg gear and you can hit for well over 2k easily and if that doesnt kill them you just outlast)  Though you really shouldnt have any trouble with rogues or warriors if you are all geared the same.  You lol at rogues most of the time

damn inofficial english speakers
---
GAMERS RISE UP!
---
Would it be smarter to just spec for single-target burst until perhaps level 30-ish and then respect to AOE if you find yourself sufficiently ahead of the curve?
---
People like you have a choice to keep playing retail with sharding. People who are the reason classic servers are even being implemented don't get a version of the game without sharding.
---
I already covered this 2 comments ago.
---
"Relatively easy and cheap".. if you haven't noticed this is the most publicity and hype WoW has had in years.. so a billion dollar IP should go the relatively and cheap route? Ok.
---
&gt;ok just discount the fact that people keep getting layered while they are running towards mobs to loot?
---
Did you read my comment?  This happens to people regardless of joining/leaving/inviting people to a group.  Regardless of in a group or solo.  You just randomly change layers.
---
I'm totally fine with not being on the same "power level" as my peers who have more time to invest.  What I'm not fine with is a dumbass 20 min cooldown to join a group.  If you think that's a good idea then you're a dumbass.

Yeah my parents never paid attention to my eye health at that age, and I was fiending computer games for at least a few hours/day starting at age 6, 7.  I still have excellent eyesight now (mid 30s) but after a day at work sometimes I get fatigue and can't focus as well, but I think that's just how my family generally goes as both my parents started using reading glasses by age 40-45. 
---
Scary stuff!
---
Yeah since my comment someone has explained that that was happening in the beta. That was not in the scope of the original explanation from Blizzard =\
---
Fun Fact: commenting on someone else's statement is a form of speech.  Just thought you might like to know that.
---
In all fairness there were many MANY performance issues, logon ques for, on some servers, literally hours. Random crashes when zones got overloaded (this wasn't just AQ), random reboots, or servers going down so players would hop on another server just to play around, and clog the performance on that server too etc.
---
It wasn't perfect in vanilla and the way technology has moved on, we can definitely get away from those issues, but layering isn't the answer - in my opinion
---
This is right.
---
no. They did not say until phase two and definitely not "at least until phase 2" You are just spreading false info now.
---
They specifically said "a few weeks". Verbatim.
---
What if you want natural world PvP but don't want to get constantly harassed and singled out?
---
It's one thing to get ganked. It's another thing to get griefed.
---
No, no, no, ya see, anyone that doesn't want to be layered in and out of zones all day abusing spawns/avoid pvp/grinding high density mobs must be one of those
---
&gt; no-life neckbeards who have hours upon hours to sit in queue or grind quest mobs.

Vanilla WoW was *always* about instant gratification, not having to be social, and abundant resources. Enjoying anything other than this cookie-cutter, 90% of other games on the market right now--gameplay loop makes you one of the 
---
Just incase, /s
---
These are not technologies, most of them are just terms Blizzard made up, mostly for design or for marketing.
---
Sharding is a technology or rather style of resource management. It predates Blizzard and I'm used to it being "instancing", tbh. All of these things are implemented via sharding, it's just a matter of framing (what is a server vs what is a shard, and in older MMOs servers were called shards). The set of consequences is fairly similar.
---
Implementations of sharding in all the various form mean that, long story short, your server is not fully persistent. That there are players who belong there that you will not see. That there are players you will see who do not belong there. That's all people need to understand.
---
If that was the case they'd disable layering... the clips show them manipulating layers to get everyone on the same.
---
Blizzard is probably not sure what they are going to do for launch. And it's oh so close.

anyways
---
Thx
---
I’m in your boat.  I think it’s necessary for a smooth launch otherwise people will get pissed off right away and obviously a company doesn’t want that.  
---
On the other hand, this isn’t really a true vanilla experience.  I would be ok if layering was restricted to only faction starting zones.

There’s a really good chance they go back on their word on this one. 
---
Everything they have said indicates they don’t have a solution in place right now because the modern architecture uses sharding intelligently to avoid population issues. 
---
Even the old server architecture handled large amounts of players very poorly. 
---
I’m not sure there is anything in gaming right now which handles over like 3,000+ players at once particularly well. 
---
All the modern stuff I know of seems to take a similar sharing approach.

Maybe Eve Online?? I have not seen what they are up to these days.

It's an opinion.

Just like yours.

You got me man. I definitely didn't begin my WoW journey 3 months after its original launch. I wasn't there for any of it. I didn't main my hunter and didn't get through half of AQ40. Any realistic opinion that blows your way is apparently enough to knock your fedora off so just keep pretending like you're special and only you know about vanilla. You're a legend man. I want your autograph.
---
Wow...that ruins the game
---
I done a class/race/faction. Test. It sad I should do undead warlock. But my original plan was rogue/hunter not sure which faction yet
---
Why would they disable layering?  They're testing it.  It's BETA.  That's what it's for.  Just because they don't explicitly come out and say "Hey, we are testing auto-layering, where when 400 people show up in one spot it auto splits them to a new layer, and we want to see how that works..." doesn't mean something like that is happening.
---
You don't need to know the exact details of everything they're testing.
---
To anyone seeing this, please ask the artist first if they have prints available before printing your own.  If they don’t, ask if they kind you printing it yourself for your own use. 
---
Not saying Verbin didn’t already do this, just wanted to remind everyone else coming along
---
Unless they wanted to stress the layering system also.
---
If layering actually kills Classic it was never going to live. Lmfao
---
Layer-me-timbers!
---
It was much more than items though. One could hold full conversations just with the auto-translate function. It also lead to a lot of jokes make up of phrases the system had leading to some weird dirty humor.
---
You're making a lot of assumptions about what I said. I was poking fun at the people who hate on private servers.
---
I don’t click links. Any validity to private servers actually handling 100s of people in 1 zone?
---
Well since blizzard has the numbers, lets ask them. Did early iteration AV have more players than current iteration?
---
I assume by devs you mean executives and game designers, because programmers generally have little say in such decisions.
---
Wow, what a twist ending!
---
Agreed, or UC.
---
It's technically possible (even though online experiences scale terribly), but this issue is not a technical one. It's a game design issue. 
---
The game is hell with 15-20k in the same 8 zones. It was never meant to host that amount. 
---
Layering has its issues, but people need to acknowledge that they're picking nits. "Teleport out of a gang" or "abusing the system for money" are mute complains when comparing it too having the entire game inaccessible to millions of customers.
---
Precisely - you don't need to know since you don't work for blizzard.
---
Blizzard has had struggles with sharding at expansion launches.
---
They will have struggles with layering when classic launches.
---
But it won't matter in october ao idgaf unlike you &lt;3
---
Then why aren't there separate Norwegian or Swiss servers?
---
Personally I hope they do. 
---
The best servers in vanilla pushed above 30,000 population.
---
Unsubscribe
---
On my healers, I have help/harm macros to re-use hotkeys for heals and offensive spells. Doesn't really matter if you're in heal spec or not, it's always nice to have easy access to swap between defensive and offensive spells on the same keybind.
---
You forgot to include the idiots trying to convince people that a non viable raid spec will be viable...
---
"Lots of ret pallies will get raid spots and do top dps"
---
Transfers will be later.
---
As much hate as there is about Asmongold. His events are a perfect stress test. At the beginning he still managed to break servers, now it's merely taxing them.
---
Yep, Clique is the only example I'm aware of where clicking is not a drag on the rest of the group. Still waiting for the carry group's counterargument.
---
Oh, now you were just making fun of people instead of asking a real question. Excellent.
---
The system of Vanilla allowed ~3,000 players online on any given realm at any given time. That's it. It was a limit of the technology at the time. This led to queue times during popular hours and eventually some dead realms. It's why cross-realm battlegrounds were introduced just so players wanting a game could get one without waiting hours or even days.
---
In an ideal world, every realm would have at least 3,000 players on it at all times and there would be no queue times. So you want to have a launch population for each realm that will eventually lead to 3,000 players after the hype wears off but not too many players wanting to logon at one time to push too far beyond this number, let's call that 5000.
---
So if 50% of the people playing at launch won't be playing after 2 months, you want each realm to be able to hold at least 10,000 people without queue times and without zone overpopulation. Since everyone will be starting in the same 6 zones and then potentially filtering into even fewer zones as they level, this means you need a lot of different splits, or "Layers".
---
If 90% of the people playing at launch won't be playing after 2 months, you want each realm to be able to hold ~50,000 players without issue.
---
It's up to Blizzard to research the best metric, but it's still only a guessing game. But the consequences of launching with too many realms that end up mostly empty is far worse than the consequences of launching too few realms. and having to create more.
---
Who fucking CARES jesus can we please just beat the well deceased horse some more?
---
Most europeans can't speak German though.
---
Probably because it's not classic at that point. It's some phasing/shifting/sharding/layering abomination.
---
Thank you for the explanation, indeed, it does suck.
---
German is orcish, kaldori is French. Could be fun.
---
This man speaks truth.
---
It's uncomfortable and painful truth, but you only lie if you deny it.
---
How will the pvp honor system work on a sort of mega server?
---
I didn't play for 10 years but planning to come back, even my friends do.
---
Thank you for the explanation. Agree, it suck.
---
The only change that makes logical sense from their TOS standpoint is Guild banks. Since back in vanilla you could account share or they didn't really care too much about it. Guilds used to have their own bank accounts where multiple officers could log into. No we will be going to having no guild banks and strict account sharing rules in their TOS.
---
Here's some starting read:

Afterwards for picking a class, some decent info here: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8hg5ej/picking_your_class_a_guide_for_new_players/ (direct google doc link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/142QiLyH5L0Dx9XnWBNKhBF5LTmOW-vnzb5S-mMDTVcw/edit)
---
Never used macros in vanilla, nor did I know what they were. My guild was first on the server to obtain Thunderfury and clear Naxx. I was DPS guild officer and raid leader on occasion. They're not necessary at all IMHO. But if you're not using macros you best have mods....
---
lol true but I read it as tongue in cheap
---
First
---
Ah, and to be clear I printed off different art on a similar sized canvas, not this artist’s art. Definitely agree!
---
I don't care about layering in the least.  They could permanently leave layering as a thing and I'll still play Classic.  It doesn't matter to me if someone vanishes or appears.  It's not going to destroy my immersion in a game with stealth and invisibility and magic.
---
I suppose a spot healer could do this but I never would as main tank healer.
---
The one on the left is really small and a castle for ducks though...
---
Like many others here, I think they should divide the realms by language, at least for the countries that just refuse to expose themselves to the English language (i.e. Russia, France, Greece) etc. Back in the day, I played on Genjuros which was the unofficial Greek server. About half of the guilds on the Alliance side were Greek only. I joined a guild myself which claimed to be an english speaking guild, only to find out that 98% of the guild where Greeks. In ventrilo, these guys for the most part spoke just Greek, which was very frustrating for me back then. 
---
In the end, I migrated from Genjuros to Kul Tiras, a much better choice. 
---
Like someone stated above, I do not think Blizzard believes that Classic will be popular enough to be arsed to divide the realms by languages like they did in retail. Shame that.
---
Layering wouldn't effect the load on a specific server because it doesn't change the population total on the server, just who is instanced where.
---
Which warlock spec doesn't respecc?  Because SL is ass in pve.
---
Yeah, for sure. Spanish and Italian are convulted too. German, Russian, Japanese, Korean, etc are convulted too. But we are talking about how fancy are these languages.
---
You know what? British English is one of the fanciest languages out there cause it's inherent accent. It has that ''high class snob'' sound when you pronounce everything, even ''horse''.
---
But I understand, you could not percieve french the same way I percieve it cause it's a subjective topic, partially, but still subjective.
---
Btw, I feel italian more poetic than fancy.
---
I get the problems with layering but spouting this bs that it's going to be here forever when they have explicitly stated that it won't be is just counter productive.
---
&gt; 'layer haters' 
---
When did this subreddit turn into a cesspool of salty people crying "MUH CIRCLEJERK, MUH HATERS, WAAAH"? Layering is not a "system that needs to be fixed", it's a legitimate issue that needs to fuck off, and we need to keep talking about it until does.
---
French is a headache.
---
Here's an example:
---
English: eighty ( 90)
---
Italian: novanta ( 90)
---
Spanish: noventa (90)
---
French:  quatre vingt dix  ( 4x20+10).
---
Simple fix to this issue, the only way you can switch layer is to group with a friend, and you can only do it once per day or something.
---
I get where your coming from and after seeing retail, I don't blame you. I didn't even make it to season 2. My favorite part of the game was M+ but after a while it became too bland and I felt like 90% of my time in the game was just trying to find groups for the higher keys. 
---
That being said, I don't have that fear. I don't have it because retail is uncharted territory for them. They know problems exist but need to come up with new solutions to fix them. Of course reverting to what worked before would be best, but they don't want to do that and instead keep pushing for the game to feel new. 
---
With classic, they know already what to do because they're giving us the original game including all of the stuff that didn't work. There's no guess work. They've already sunk so much time and effort into this and they understand that the community will only play if it gives them the same feel that vanilla did. Just look at how much the classic team has listened to us. Besides this issue of layering/sharding at launch, we literally got every single last thing we wanted (mins a July release of course :( lol) because they listen and have shown us they listen. I have no reason to doubt that they will continue to do so regardless of the shit they pull in retail. Their success in classic depends on it and they know it.
---
Ahh ok thanks, so it will change appearance but not have a visible CD where I can time or go earlier just in case.
---
And in the gCD you would have to Klick still 4 times and the cast comes when it comes ..
---
Is it possible to use the cast sequence with 1 click and cast the totems each after the gCD?
---
Can i have a good resolution?
---
Did I ever say I was having some sort of intellectual conversation? I made a joke and you seem to be trying to disassemble it in some "intellectual way". Calm down.
---
inb4 removed for rule 7
---
BFA sold 3.4 million copies on launch day. You really think WoW Classic is going to see that many people subscribe? Because I really really don't.
---
So a couple things going on there that are just obvious. First off, your streamer video has a horrible PoV and doesn't actually show how many people are in the area.  You can't really be sure there's not a huge fight going on over the hill, or behind him.
---
Second, the pserver doesn't involve any combat. It's just a bunch of same faction PCs most of who aren't even flagged for PvP and some friendly npcs. When combat happens, or has the potential to happen the servers are doing a lot more work. 
---
Third, and this one is really just a guess but, I'd wager Blizzard is also doing a lot more validation than the private server does. Over the years Blizzard's servers have evolved to contain a lot of checks against various methods of cheating.
---
This. Looking forward to enjoying the game step-by-step and if people want to double their investment to get a "solid" farming spot, go for it.
---
What are the powerups you refer to?
---
I plan to make a Warlock and a Warrior.
---
The Warlock will be known for overcharging for bags or giving them away idk.
---
The tank will be known for being a good friendly tank running your random dungeons, hopefully.
---
So you are saying more people played 1.12 AV than 1.5 AV? I call bullshit.
---
I do; we can agree to disagree, I'm sure.
---
It seems like people equate "being shitty" and "misusing words" pretty often. The problem isn't the words being used. The problem is people being shitty.
---
Call someone out for *that*, not for the word. If someone calls you a retard, and you say "hey, stop being a shitty person", I'm on board.
---
There was a blue post I saw in an archive that mentioned a 15k-20k number per server, which corroborates the OP’s numbers if they’re diluted by the Asian servers.
---
IIRC that was their target from the start based on EQ projections.
---
almost as if multiculturalism does not even work in video games
---
I think we have different definitions of fancy.   If you think British English is fancy.
---
Narf
---
Still not sure how to say it 15 years later
---
Nop only gametime. (WoD here aswell)
---
&gt; you still have to have all those different mods **on the screen**.
---
They require action bar space, to be more precise. Whether or not they clutter your screen depends on what else you do with your UI. Most action bar addons allow you to hide them completely. IMO, most abilities without a CD have no need to be on your screen so long as they are keybound.
---
I dont think your time will be unproductive. As we all know, there are a lot of different activities in this game. They will just take a very very long time to complete overall. That is all I am alluding to. I think the difference between you and I is that you are just a more patient person with your gaming time than I am.
---
One thing to point out (but not to disagree with any of your points): the beta client, being the 8.x client, supports multiple character sets out of the box. There are a decent number of Chinese players in beta with fully Chinese-character based names that appear correctly in the US-English client without any changes made on my part.  So the Cyrillic alphabet argument for Russian servers seems odd to me.
---
Don't worry i really don't think you are an intellectual.
---
Scarab lord
---
Does not make me hate it any less.
---
You gotta play like a Frenchman and be able to bubble-Hearth.
---
Don't. There was no move to in vanilla.

Where have they explicitly said that it will definitely be removed later on?

I mean I'll consider it. Got a Canadian friend that's completely new to WoW and wants to play Paladin, I would love to play with him but Im more of a Horde person so I feel like Im stretching it going with NA servers and a faction I dont like as much. :P

Back to retail? That would require me to have been there in the first place.

I did naxx 14 years ago kid, I probably know the game ten times better than you LOL

'You want a server of your nation? That sounds like nationalism to me. Diversity is our strength"

Are there any statistics on RP servers? Are they even worth having given the current situation?

In a word, no.

No but it's not 2004 it's 2019.
---
Play or don't
---
Dun mat either way.
---
That's the way it goes. Sometimes you get it sometimes you get got.
---
I’m french, and I can live with international servers. I don’t support the whole « why should we be forced to speak english blabla ».
---
However, what you are saying about being used to speak english for 12 years, we can say the same about speaking french. 
---
And that’s really where the problem is. You will have your classic wow experience, we won’t.
---
Its not bullshit to want the fucking servers to not crash you retards.
---
All blizzard cares about is money. And the only way to do that is without shitty crashing issues. Nobody cares about your fucking immersion
---
How dare people have fun on a server that is meant for this type of thing!
---
Are you sure, I know there are some spots where this actually did happen in vanilla. Just not sure if this is one of them
---
Well tbh streamers are going to be first people to go back to Fortnite after people stop watching wow again.
---
[http://wowclassicbis.com/](http://wowclassicbis.com/)
---
Ah cool thanks for the edu-ma-cation.
---
can you link it?
---
Yes and no. People would pop into existence out of nowhere in vanilla, but this is due to them being outside the maximum view distance and then coming into your view distance.
---
Yeah it's like neon lights.  A little is cool because it stands out and can even contrast/compliment the non rgb pieces.. A lot and it's just a glaring ugly scream for attention.
---
Ahh gotcha, thank you!
---
In Beta the layering is insanely aggressive on the order of 10 players per layer. It is extremely aggressive so people layer more often which generates more layering testing data.
---
The only issues to that is group content and downscaling. You absolutely need to be able to group up and play with any player in your realm, regardless of what Layer each of you is on. The only other time you should swap Layers in a zone is because Layers are being merged to respond to negative fluctuations in online players
---
Ya. I ain't not intellectual. I never said I was. You're arguing with me, and you aren't doing a very good job of it. So neither are you.
---
SM/ruin doesn't respect. You drop 5% shadow damage over DS/ruin, but you can be the imp buff guy.
---
He is
---
Enjoy spending $15 just to realize someone on that layer is already fucking your spot up B.
---
It's not, at least not in the way that WoW is.  The only real reason a Minecraft project would take months is the scale of the project, and the fact that it has to be built one block at a time, which can't really be changed without fundamentally altering either the project or the game.  
---
On the other hand in WoW things like exp/money gain, travelling speed, and such can all be altered with changing the underlying experience.
---
This is pointless.  You just need one button (on the mouse).
---
I bet there's gonna be some random idiot that paid for a 2 day stress test complaining he can'T PLAY AND LEVEL. 
---
I'm glad Asmongold is pushing the server to its limits.
---
I aint complaining boss, just curious
---
Yeah, especially since the impacts of dead realms vs. overcrowded or possibly layered realms is vastly different. Layered realms may mean gold inflation, world boss wonkiness, problems with WPvP. Dead realms may not have active markets, sustainable raiding guilds, or anybody participating in WPvP.
---
Dead servers have negative pressure, and cause more and more people to quit over time in a vicious feedback loop. Busting out forced realm mergers a year into the lifespan is way, way worse for the communities than being overcrowded.
---
Merely overpopulated servers can be mitigated with optional realm transfers like they did in Vanilla.
---
I'm merely talking about the effect lag had on casting spells back in the day. There was no spell queue.
---
&gt; if you can do it 
---
That's his point.  You can't do it when everyone else will be competing for tags on the same AOE grind spots.
---
Your points about getting ahead to first licks rely on the assumption that you *can* get ahead, for that you will need to significantly outgrind people that are in the exact same circumstances that you are in order to have latter locations all to yourself.
---
Which is to say, fairly unlikely at launch.
---
Can you include spell cost?
---
I'm not sure if it was in vanilla, but it is like that on LH.
---
I remember so many people who started playing Wow on US servers with shitty English who learned quality American English by the time the expansion closed out.
---
I don't see the big issue. I've never had any problems being in a group of people who all speak Portuguese. Google translate is really not that bad.
---
cemitério or rampa is pretty easy to figure out from both sides of the language barrier if you're talking about the flag carrier.
---
TF is the 'meta' (I think thats what the kids these days call it), but there are many options. I had Quel'Serrar on a cow tank, I farmed it in DM, and that was awesome. A fast 1h is probably the way to go in my opinion.
---
N.B Don't set your hopes too high on getting TF, as epic (or legendary) as it would be to have, a minimal amount of players actually managed to get both bindings AND the follow on materials to craft it. It's not a quick process &amp; they wont even drop until phase 2(?)
---
Dal rends seemed to be a popular choice on my server from what I remember
---
Nobody knows what the current sub count is. They haven't released it in forever.
---
The river dividing Durotar and Barrens had this exact problem I show here. Just not sure if the gates of IF is another spot it does it or if this is something else
---
For some yes.
---
People play black desert online... voluntarily.
---
I am just making observations and statements. That is not arguing.
---
Nope - we play blizzards game.
---
I thought you just rolled your face on the keyboard
---
And yet keeping it open even for just a few weeks is enough time to completely fuck the economy.
---
I want it for BRD/Stratholme runs in a group of 5 friends talking on discord. OFC I will use actual healing stuff in raids. But that class fantasy goes a long way for me.
---
I've seen low effort before, but this is some legitimate zero-effort shitposting
---
Ok ya, this is just one of those spots where it does it. There are several of them in vanilla.
---
Seems like something you should decide.
---
then wth are you doing on reddit?
---
Well for the time being I trust the classic team more than I trust the current wow team so theres that! Fingers crossed it all works out and I can enjoy my nostalgia trip.
---
Here’s your downvote and your block. Have a nice day.
---
Ironically back avoidance won't be an issue on normal realms xD
---
''Quatre vingt dix'' sounds so cool to the point that you hyped me, no joke. 
---
A lot of words are far-fetched, but they are fancy and exquisite.
---
i don't recall much about my specific build but i went heavily on marksmanship. never took improved scorpid sting. you could do well with beast mastery as well but i preferred marks. my philosophy as a hunter was to just stay back and drop bombs on em, hoping for some big crits. aimed shot weaving with multishot in there makes short work of people in BGs. for 1v1 or open world, same deal but just having to FD-&gt; freeze trap to put some distance between you and them if they get close. scatter shot for when that option is on CD. 
---
i think my build would be something like this  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/hunter/-5025103051302-0050052510303](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/hunter/-5025103051302-0050052510303) 
---
hoping for that aimed shot crit. i'd equip the hardest hitting weapon i had. usually a cross bow with slow attack speed but high damage.
---
Game came out in 2004 in a rough stage.
---
from browsing this sub you get the impression that people are passionately in love with blizzard abd everything they do, or they want to do the opposite which i guess in this day and age im not even allowef to type anymore. yay freedom of severely limited and restricted speech  (good pally spell tho)
---
You do realize the parent comment is asking about addons right?
---
Mage from a technical perspective is very simple.  Skill ceiling is a different conversation, but nothing in their kit needs addons to work well.  You are barking up the wrong tree.
---
Thing about Dark Souls is that it uses the slowness to its advantage to give the player time to make choices in combat as well as to add to the dark, gritty atmosphere, but WoW doesn't have either of those things.
---
&gt; I had Quel'Serrar on a cow tank,
---
Were you homogenized?
---
I’m actually more annoyed about repetitive discussion posts than memes.
---
I mean run away as fast as you can is as simple as logging out and logging in
---
I don't really get where people like you get their blind faith in the analysts over at Blizzard from. A re-launch of an old MMORPG is practically unheard of, even more so for an MMORPG that is still active today. The only good comparison that Blizzard has is RuneScape, which is a vastly different game (for the longest time a f2p browser game). Even if it was a good comparison, that's still a case study of 1.
---
Analytics are basically nothing without statistically significant data to base their estimations on. The fact is that they have no real clue how many people will play Classic for a prolonged period of time. The best they can do is guesstimate some server release numbers based on things like beta signups, but that tells them absolutely nothing about just how much the drop-off will be after being out for a few weeks/months.
---
They're just assuming the worst case scenario, and probably believe they can quickly launch new servers if needed. In a way I can't blame them, at the very least the execs are happier with that than "let's launch with 100 servers when we have no clue how many people will stay!" which risks spending more than they "have to". But I can only feel they're making a decision that edges so much towards the worst case scenario of playerbase drop-off that they're plainly jeopardising the game itself.

What do expect from an American-based capitalist mega-corporation?

This sounds much better! Take care.

Either work. You can actually heal raids as a 30/0/21 Shammy pvp spec.

I'd go mage only if you wanted to DPS during raids, Shaman don't really get to do that in vanilla.

Do you remember the binds you used?

Actually, your example of shadow priest not having a shadow wand is terrible because shadow wands benefit from shadow weaving and therefore do up to 15% more damage in the hands of a shadow priest.  This would definitely more than make up for the difficulty faced when encountering mobs with shadow resistance.

Layering... I thought this was supposed to be wow classic? There wasn’t layering in vanilla... wtf?
---
Maybe we're on different sides of the same coin. I kind of see it as, I'd rather call out a behavior, in this case using "retarded" pejoratively, rather than the person doing it in a blanket-way if that makes sense. I think we can expect to see more positive change this way.
---
To make an analogy - if your coworker does something rude, it's better to say "hey, that behavior is unacceptable" rather than "you are rude". Puts people less on the defensive in my experience. (And it sucks for actually mentally handicapped people to have that word thrown around like nothing)
---
Not sure how hard it is just to limit layering to the starting zones, that's where the most people will be at the beginning.
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?item=23577](https://classicdb.ch/?item=23577)   
---
Realistically though you could get a Thunderfury first!
---
I mean, you did see stuff kinda like that from view distance and load times. But I'm pretty sure we're looking at a layer change, in which case no.. Obviously not since that didn't exist.
---
Those are included in the mouseover tooltip of each row.  I originally had them in line, but some spells are really long and it cuts things off in a weird way (this would be even more of an issue in non-english clients)

I'd say maybe 8 days since it's gonna take 5 days at least /played.

Should be relatively easy for Blizzard to confirm.

I think you need to look up the definition of what an argument is.

People complaining like this exposes some sort of problem with layering. He says he shouldn't be able to do this, then why did you? If you're going to cry about it then don't do it. Thank god Blizzard isn't getting rid of layering.

Yes. Capital cities are kinda like instances, whenever you leave one there's a slight delay depending on your ms

Barnes &amp; Noble Chat?
---
I'm going on record to say the following: layering sucks, sharding sucks, colorblind mode is great, 1.12 AV sucks, post-Naxx discussion is overwhelmingly repetitive but the *concept* is interesting and **new** ideas are worth discussing, most streamers are babies and annoy me, and I am for the most part one of the hardest of hardcore #nochanges zealots *even if* a change would make the game objectively better.
---
But despite my opinions, I only remove posts that break our rules. The quickest way to a failed forum is the shut-down of dissenting opinions by people running the circus. I'll add, I *hate* that so many people on this sub downvote anyone that they disagree with as that *cripples* good discussion, but then those same people get pissed that memes overtake everything.
---
Again, though - I do everything I can to set my bias aside and moderate as fairly and consistently as possible. I feel confident that the other mods do, too.
---
ok. the results show Draenei and Worgan as top two races for you but they do not exist in WoW classic. they are races that came in the expansions. i think you should just try different races/classes first and just go with what you enjoy. don't let some survey decide for you.

I think the leper gnomes in Dun Morogh are a safe bet, they are the object of a quest but because of its level 7 requirement and the fact it is off road kharanos, it might be overlooked by some players.

"Ahead of the curve" isn't really a thing with mage AOE leveling. You hope to remain in particular spots for huge level bands. Suppose you're the server first to level 44 and want to AOE Tanaris Pirates. You will hope to stay there until level 52 -- eight whole levels on those pirates. You will not be ahead of the curve so much that you're going to have those pirates to yourself for eight levels. It's really only workable if you can layer swap to hog spawns.
---
I think it really only comes down to 1) can you abuse layers to help and 2) how many other mages are doing the same thing. So if you're going to try it you may as well start ASAP. A higher-level mage can absolutely muscle you out of a spot because they clear using less of their mana pool and recover the mana faster (or can kill you if PVP). You're not going to be higher level than a mage who started AOE at level 21 if you went single target to level 30.
---
Hmm, just looks like horde speak as an Alliance player to me.
---
Exactly, i haven't made any arguments. Just observations and statements. Maybe claims.
---
Fuck how do I buy reddit gold
---
I have my doubts, but maybe its layering
---
What is the proof here?  A reddit post to a blizzard forum post to a reddit post about legion?  I don't see anything here proving anything.
---
no. unless you're lagging bad.
---
Shut the fuck up. Nobody fucking cares who isnt autistic. Get real problems you goofy fuck
---
So are you in the massive multi-server merges after a month camp or the 10+ hour queues stopping potential players from playing for 2-3 weeks camp? 
---
Classic is NOT 2004-2006 WoW btw it is a recreation on a modern architecture. Lower your #nochanges expectation to the realm of realistic expectations for managing a large amount of players coming in and over half leaving within a month or so.
---
Yes. Collapsing layers are also server mergers. It's basically layering without the ability to move between the layers. Hence no abuse and retaining names etc.

I think more or less the same about the realm numbers. But I'm not sure about the US realms. There are screenshots of like 20 US/Oceanian realms for beta and I really would have assumed that the number would be the same for the launch. But will EU be that much smaller than US? I don't think so.

I don't know why this made me start cracking up but thanks for that!

I don’t click links while at work.

Warriors can't beat mages, warlocks or shadowpriests. Equally geared/skilled the clothie will win 9/10.
---
Haha indeed! i think it might be because we use a lot of English words already, and being into gaming or just working with pc's it becomes normal for us, but it becomes a problem when talking to people IRL :)
---
I think all Mages, Warlocks, Priests, Druids, Paladins, and Shaman would care, since this is a significant buff to Rogues, Warriors, and Hunters.
---
I'm playing Rogue and want this looked at.
---
as you wish bobby b, please entertain us
---
Dude, people cared when the thought that Gnomes might be slightly taller than they used to be.
---
People will care about this if it turns out to be true. Blizzard ought to care too. Everyone excited for Classic should care.

Alrighty then. This has to be the absolute stupidest argument I've ever been a part of. Enjoy the rest of your day dude.

Case in point. Layering is a solution to a problem. Realm populations are going to fluctuate between launch and phase 1, likely significantly. This would normally lead to many realms populations dipping significantly low enough to make things like 40 man raids exclusive content that maybe 1or 2 guilds get to do on that server, rather than 20 to 30 (numbers are not exact, obviously). All you and your ilk have done for the past 2 months is cry like children about how YOU don't like layering. The bugs and issues are just justification that you use after the fact to try and convince people on the fence. 
---
To reiterate, yes, there are issues that need to be fixed; no layering for one phase is not, in itself, a problem. Sorry, not everyone wants to spend 12 hours trying to complete valley of trials because of 2000 players competing over 30 boars. Not everyone would rather sit in a 5 hour queue to play the game. We would overwhelmingly rather some try hard neck beards get a head start on black lotus spawns than not be able to play the game until phase 2. And guess what, Blizzard already decided that was the route they wanted to go. If it bothers you that much I'm pretty sure no private servers use layering, so go look one up and play there right now.
---
Then separate the servers.
---
Put tourists looking to try the classic experience for the first time in a layered abomination.
---
Let the rest of us play on real servers.
---
Too mmo'ish is bad for an MMO?  It's obvious you never played Vanilla.
---
If you want the Vanilla experience, you're welcome to it.  But don't try to bring that BFA crap to Vanilla and think you're making our game better for it.
---
Or chain lightning earthshock to eat up that storm strike buff before they stun you first etc.
---
I really think it's too late by then
---
I just heard countdown to classic where they talked about how weapon skill is going to be more important than anticipated. So perhaps the axe off nefarian is worth holding on to for a while.
---
The screenshots were at the very beginning of the last Stress Test when they wanted to test various settings for Layering, but they quickly had to reduce it down to 4 realms because there weren't enough players to sustain them all.
---
Hey this goes against the reddit circlejerk of hating streamers! How dare you!
---
They. Are. Testing. The. Mother. Fucking. Servers.
---
It can't be anything else.. The game isn't running on Vanilla engine, any old view distance or weird loading stuff wouldn't exist like that anymore. It's known that people get moved between layers sometimes. Hell there's a clip of some streamer getting layer shifted in the middle of a dungeon without his team. You got moved to a more populated layer. It's not that weird.
---
Unfortunately, you can't run a whole cast sequence with one click. You also can't just spam it 4 times quickly, you have to click it each time it comes off the GCD.
---
That macro won't let you use the Windfury Totem early, but you can solve that a couple ways. You can add "reset=7/target", so if you drop your target it will go back to WF (click off the boss then back on). 
---
You can add a shift modifier, either to a separate /cast or the sequence itself, to manually cast WF Totem. However, that one is clunky with the timer.
---
Only if you mix up observations and statements to arguments &amp; arguing.
---
It has already been answered in the comments but this is [Quinta da Regaleira](http://www.regaleira.pt/en) in Sintra, Portugal. Never having left the country it is by far the most breathtaking place I've ever been to, and creepiest too if I were to go at night since there's NO lighting around either that well or the tunnels that you can walk through at the bottom (they used to give you head lanterns but then everyone just started using phones so you're completely on your own in the tunnels).
---
Man. People on this sub could slip on ice and bust their ass and they'd find a way to blame streamers.
---
Just because they have a camera on while they play the game doesn't  mean it's their job to advocate for every exaggerated complaint this sub has.
---
I find it pretty funny that everyone shits on streamers and calls them irrelevant, but now they're complaining that streamers aren't using their relevance to advocate for them.
---
TF is probably going to be easier to get than saph/kt drops in the long run, so your question is a bit odd. The answer is TF.
---
Have four servers with non-overlapping names, this gives you three options.
---
1. Leave all four as they are.
---
2. Merge A&amp;B &amp; C&amp;D creating two total servers.
---
3. Merge all four to make one.
---
There's no options with just estimating how many will still be interested after a month. But three possible results, two of which suck and make people mad at Activision.
---
1. Nail it, 5k left, everyone's happy.
---
2. Too high, phase one lasts forever, or a very long queue.
---
3. Too low, low pop server, unplanned merge, people have to change names.

---
So much this. My first 60 was a hunter I was set on being a hunter again. I got in the beta, leveled to 30 and I just can't stand playing it anymore. Not knowing my range, pet commands having a lag time, or having my pet sometimes glued to my side is incredibly annoying. (Changed between passive, aggressive, defensive won't change how it behaves once combat starts.)  Given how blizzard handled things in previous betas I don't see it being fixed before launch. We MIGHT see them recognizing the issue at launch and them saying they will fix it a few months later, but who knows. I'm not sure if Warlocks are having the same issue, but if they are then pet classes are going to be a sucker's bet.
---
I would pay twice my subscription for that server for the social science behind it alone.

to
---
&gt; Private servers will never have the same amount of players again. 
---
The point you seem to have missed is the live Classic servers are failing to handle the load of 100 players in 1 spot without sending them to different layers; whereas private servers could handle massive world PvP battles (between 500 to 1000 in 1 zone) with minimal lag.
---
What's the usual tip for that?
---
Well, yeah. But will people like Asmond do that? Doesn't he stream *a lot* of WoW?
---
We should still bitch about it, otherwise they might not change it. We cant just have complete faith that blizzard is going to do this right.
---
Mmm, the most conclusive promises we have are that Layering will be gone by Phase 2. That's ~2 months, not a few weeks.
---
Right, he is pushing it far beyond what its meant for and people are like "OMG LAG WTF IS SHIT SHIT BLIZZURD FIX THIS SHYT NOW!"
---
Shitty player has shitty attitude what a weird coinkydink.
---
I mean, its that or your PC. The game wouldn't have trouble loading that.
---
Go watch a vid for once. 🤠
---
Have fun playing in a private server then.
---
Only when affected by view distance or perhaps lag, but everyone popping in at once, conveniently when you enter a new zone, suggest THAT thing that definitely isn't sharding...
---
I didn't say it would exist longterm. I said it's not looking good if you look to play this game longterm and expect it to be authentic, because they already heavily traded off authenticity for ease of access and temporary server stability (after tourists leave) not just for a couple days, but for weeks, or even months depending on demand.
---
This sets a bad precedent on Blizzards trustworthiness. They've turned on multiple statements already before. If they use this new tech in Classic once, they set themselves up to using it again later during high traffic times (AQ gates etc, which were already mentioned in a dev interview, but they avoided saying whether they'd use layering for these events or not). 
---
They haven't earned the trust they need to be able to assure this thing won't make a comeback when it suits them. Thus, a bad deal for the players who want to play an authentic version of Vanilla in Classic. 
---
Blizzard needs to deliver on what they set out to deliver from the start, which was a faithful recreation of vanilla, or they set themselves up for failure (which layering is literally a setup for already btw).
---
If the germans want their own servers then maybe they shouldnt have started 2 world wars

Always hated macros. Feels like the game playing itself.

But to be fair, if this was all possible with vanilla macros then it should be a thing this time too.

"Here's a legendary staff that can teleport you to this raid we'll put out next expansion but won't be as good as the staff that you pull out of a boar's ass in the first expansion zone"

Amen, amen ahah.

Most of that seems like more of a hassle than what it’s worth.
---
Exactly. As long as we get a response, we can put the issue to rest.
---
If that's what they're using it's janky as hell. Loads of the variables are different.
---
Ah man all the criss crossing of cities to get what your looking for, who knew the pinnacle of gaming was digital errands lol
---
That's true. I stand by my point that the improved functionality of macros makes extensive keybinding redundant.
---
And actually, that technique can effectively save you space on very complex macros, which I hadn't considered before...
---
Wow, actually, you could essentially write ~1250 character macros by splitting them up into new macros for each modifier+keybind.
---
Jesus Christ that's game breaking.
---
Just let us play in August, it really isn't that big of a deal, but it would be nice if it was fixed.

Being reliable and competent will get you far in classic, it's not about mythic plus times and arena ratings.

I guess it depends on the server economy, I usually did it for free since UBRS is my absolute favorite and I’d usually run it all the time. Maybe 10-15g if it was just a quick key service then hearth home

---
I made 20g one day on a female troll, I'll never do it again but I'll have that memory always.
---
I enjoyed experimenting with macros back when I played, so this thread has been an interesting read. However, I've got a few comments and questions based on past experiences with my hunter.
---
1) What's the significance of "@pet" in the Revive Pet line? On its own, does "dead" simply not give the client enough information? This stood out because Revive Pet doesn't have any targeting requirement, if memory serves.
---
2) Similarly, Dash(pet) doesn't have a targeting component. I believe you could remove both "@mouseover" and "harm" from its modifier without breaking the macro.
---
3) Isn't "button:1" the default state when omitted from a modifier string? In other words, I expect CTRL + KEYBIND would cast Dismiss Pet just fine if you took "button:1" out of its modifier. I believe you only need to *click* the action bar icon if you use something other than "button:1."
---
4) Are you aware of any commands that allow toggling between two buttons that are not on the GCD? I couldn't find an answer, but I was interested in having a single button switch my pet between follow and stay. I'm 99% certain /castsequence can't do this.
---
Thanks for the good thread!
---
Ah okay, thank you!
---
Ye but the voice line. What's that?? Who gave you that staff? HE sent you didn't he. Or something like that. One of warcraft best vc
---
God, some people in that thread are obnoxious. "Hurr, durr, we told you everything is too easy, we were right! Fucking noobs!". Sort of.
---
This bug obviously needs to be fixed, but "all" it does is increasing attack skill damage by \~6-9%, based on the weapon type (while keeping auto attack damage the same). Noticeable, but clearly not the power difference people think to have noticed.
---
Anyway, nice find :)
---
Its fine, if it stays like that we have valid reason to go back to private servers and unsub.
---
Ew, that's the Ragefire in retail. Begone, peasant!
---
The problem is first few week is still too late to remove it. The firsts lvl 60 will reach at the end of the first week (even faster if they abuse it to aoe grind faster).
---
I am in this photo.
---
Also when running from Barrens into Stonetalon this would happen when nearing those first quest givers. Should not be happening outside IF though.
---
Thanks.  I missed that link the first time around.
---
Great post, thanks for sharing. Would you mind sharing more of your druid macros with us?
---
First week? Over 7 days of play time, assuming 16-20 hours of gameplay a day, poopsockers won't get 5 days play time at 16 a day and will need to be on 4 hours of sleep a day for a week to get 60 by first week. That's no gear grind for dungeons, which I would guess would take a day of pre raid grinding. 
---
So, maybe, people will get in MC but you still need hydraxian rep to summon rag, so there's that grind too. 
---
First week rag clears would be extremely stretching it at that. First couple weeks more likely for most hardcore players and, in theory, layering would be gone by then.
---
cya in classic  launch
---
You can just create new characters which have a chance  to spawn on a different layer then you log back onto your main and they should be in the new layer your alt is on.
---
sha-PO
---
that's what players call dead content
---
I would level which ever you like more and make the other an alt. 
---
I plan on leveling my warrior first because I want to raid as prot but I also want a boomkin for pvp.
---
Pservers do not have the problem that an official server and launch have, there isn't a HUGE boom of players joining at the same time. The only thing that comes close would be a big server (like nost) when they release a newly available server (PVE server release), but even then I doubt it will see the influx of people that classic will see. In addition, didn't Nost have some dynamic spawn capabilities?
---
Indeed spanish is low cost italian, and I'm French so I'm saying that in an entirely objective way.
---
Bon bon, oui!
---
You can abuse layering to aoe grind to get to lvl 60 faster. A good group of mage could do it in 3 or 4 days.
---
Streamer bad
---
Zone boundaries always phased people in vanilla lol.  You would notice this on Flight Paths, while riding your mount, or anything.  There was always a spot where the other player would vanish and the pop forward if you zoned with them.
---
Dumb question, Classic appears in my launcher, it's not stress test, but when trying to login it says I need an active subscription, which I have. If I'm out of the loop to feel free to downvote, just feel like I need a clear answer
---
You'll probably do more damage than most people back in Vanilla
---
no its for the stress test that is ending right now.
---
you need an NA sub
---
they stopped sending out beta invites weeks ago
---
Asmongold is bald
---
Ah shit
---
No it would say, beta: world of Warcraft classic
---
Who would play on a server like that though? A few weeks after launch when all the retail players have quit the game all the non layered realms would be completely dead.
---
You should've went meta and included a "DAE this subreddit is always posting the same stuff" starter pack to your starter pack
---
Layering is only In effect for the first couple weeks while people are leveling.
---
They will turn it off later on.
---
That doesnt fix layer hoppings effect on resources like herbs/ore
---
Must be some pretty blacked out opaque glasses you're sitting behind if you can't see how having layering for any amount of time will negatively impact classic.
---
I LOVEd my Tauren shaman. It’s funny to run up to someone as a tiny wolf and then all of a sudden morph into a massive cow with a giant hammer and roflpwn their face.
---
You might be right for quests, my bad
---
If you have 7 chests, that means you have a server population of 7 layers. Thinking very conservatively, that's 7000 people (1k per layer, which would be less than half of vanilla server cap).
---
7000 people accumulate well over 2000 Gold from level 1 to 10 within just the first 3-5 hours. The amount of gold in the economy then increases rapidly as people get higher level and the amount of accessible resources (zones/instances) go up. 7 chests will give you what, 100g? I really don't see this being impactful for the economy of a realm so big that it has 7 layers.
---
That's just the way it is.
---
dude look it up on youtube, are you kidding me?
---
Wow, it's been a while.
---
Barmans Shanker works ok for Dagger PvP on early 60, although you would be better off  farming 2x Dal Rends and going hemo for pvp in P1. You could even get a Vis'kag from Ony in P1.
---
Sorry if I'm misunderstanding you but are you guys upset that a bunch of Italians don't speak English? ... why? What proportion of native English speakers speak Italian?
---
Why on earth would it be up to random redditors? 
---
We tell Blizzard we hate layering, *they* pick the solution.
---
At this point server queues, standard mergers, sharding of just starter zones and a packed world, etc would be better than layering.
---
But why on earth would you defend layering simply because you or I don’t have a solution? That’s not our jobs mate
---
1.12 is with normalised attack so there's nothing really impressive about Barman Shanker. 
---
I haven't seen anyone with definitive lists of what is available in each phase so I assume that means no one actually knows yet, so it's impossible to say what is best for each phase.  
---
[How many of these are available ](https://imgur.com/fqDfxa0)phase 1 /2 I don't know, but i think quite a few are I'd assume.
---
O consider this an exploit so i guess well have to ban him, right?
---
Don't have the link either, but he's right and wrong at the same time. Ion said he want's layering gone within a few weeks, but at the very latest for phase 2 due to world bosses. When exactly seems to be a population question.
---
There's one launching tomorrow to practice leveling! If you're bored you should check it out to see how a populated server handles a launch without layering. 
---
I'll play Classic at launch but I suspect Blizz is going to fuck it up so much (flashbacks to Diablo 3 error 37) because they're already cutting corners with their servers.
---
My gut says this is right, I feel like I remember following people into cities from time to time and there being a phasing of sorts. All I've got is a gut feeling, though.
---
Who do you think?
---
I'm 36 with wife, daughter and son. I'm writing this from a 2 week vacation which I took so I don't feel bad for taking 2 weeks off starting on the 27th of August.
---
An unintended 5% damage boost to Hunters and Warriors?
---
An unintended 7% damage boost to Rogues?
---
Yeah, I'd call that a pretty big deal.
---
I had more fun in those two days than I did in the last two years of retail.
---
There are also other much more practical solutions. It's not just option A: Layer the game or option B: Do nothing and let the servers catch on fire.
---
There are a bunch of ways to do it, depending on the trade-offs you want to make. The easiest way is to not put it on the main action bar (because it swaps), and use:
---
#show Overpower
---
#showtooltip Overpower
---
/castsequence Battle Stance, Overpower, Berserker Stance
---
But there dozens of distinct ways to do it. You could have two separate macros on the main bar, one in Berserker Stance that swaps to Battle. Then one in the same key position in Battle Stance that uses Overpower and swaps back to Berserker.
---
Nice zoomer set.
---
But it doesn't mount you up if you're in form it just cancels the form? So to mount up from bear form you just hit the mount button rapid fire?
---
It doesn’t solve more problems than it creates tho.
---
It creates an absolute monstrosity of problems from pvp to economy to immersion and not only that, it doesn’t even alleviate the beginner rush which would need like 100 shards to make playable instead of 8 layers.
---
So honestly layering is looking very weak at this point.
---
Look up devilsaur mafia and how it affected the whole nostalrius server, the guild running the mafia has so much gold they were able to pay multiple guilds to lock up zones at will (especially when world boss spawned) to keep all this for themselves.
---
If you weren't part of the devilsaur mafia, you had no chance at all to go for world boss (so yes technically, 40 players with enough gold can prevent you to kill world boss forever).
---
&gt;why other Europeans are so entitled that they have to speak German, Spanish or w/e. 
---
There are plenty of people in Germany who couldn't string together an English sentence if their life depended on it.
---
Oh no! 15 dollars a month, how will I survive without my 15 dollars.
---
oof. 
---
cheers.
---
Well this is why layering is dumb
---
I mean, lots of people play like...Animal Crossing, which is so slow and boring it puts me to sleep. I don't think compared to real sandboxy type games that you could call Classic 'slow.' It's only slow compared to retail, but retail also has so much going on all the time that I think it's overwhelming to new players. Classic is Back to Basics and I feel pretty sure that it will appeal to a lot of people, including some new(er) players.
---
Whoa, don't ruin his vanilla experience.
---
You realize that you, a random redditor, proposed a solution...right? And then you say “we don’t need to propose solutions.” Makes sense.
---
I personally think that layering in its current form is probably about as good as we are going to get.
---
I have no idea. People who don't know what kind of server it is? I can't imagine anyone rolling on a completely dead server intentionally
---
Was that necessary? Think before you speak.
---
Feedback at this stage is important. It’s how we got Blizzard to handle the Loot Trading issue. We kept the spotlight on it, we kept the conversation going, and they listened.
---
We *have* to do that with Layering. Keep the spotlight on and conversation going. Because if they release Classic like this, their one shot, they’ll blow it.
---
Pservers should simply not have a better immersion experience than actual Classic. Layering isn’t a solution now it’s a problem.
---
Watched it, i think you should give more credit to the people asking for an old version a game (WoW Classsic) than us attempting to design a new game (i'm not) , we played it.. we liked it, we want it back.
---
&gt;Pservers do not have the problem that an official server and launch have, there isn't a HUGE boom of players joining at the same time.
---
Aaaaaaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.
---
Have you missed every private server launch in the past 2 years? Every single launch is a race out of the gates to get ahead, they are a shitshow. A beautiful intense shitshow.
---
It is not the streamers responsibility to be anyone’s voice.  Thinking otherwise is incredibly entitled.  Stop putting them on a pedestal.  They are completely dependent on the game continuing to be good.  Before classic was announced and bfa sucked, I bet a lot of the wow streamers were uncertain about their financial future and heavily considering playing other games.  The viewership on twitch for wow used to be top 3 all the time with 50k or more, in BFA before classic beta it was often under 10k and far down the list. 
---
That being said, I love watching streamers on twitch.  The hate for them is ridiculous and childish.  They produce hours and hours of awesome content for free for a lot of people, and don’t deserve to get treated like they owe you anything.  Have you ever subbed or donated?  If you haven’t, they DEFINITELY don’t owe you anything.
---
Outside of a stun on 15 minute timer, what is the big deal on tidal charms? I see it as very situational,ore annoying if you're soloing and a guy gets you every 15 minutes, but what's game breaking about everyone having this?
---
told u
---
The point of HotW really is to be able to tank 5 mans (or raids if desperate) while still being to heal.  
---
If your goal is just to be the most useful druid to your teammates in pve and pvp than that's easy, just go a normal swiftmend spec.
---
The fuck is this garbage..
---
Wow nice page, thank you very much. It says hungering cold on 6 but an axe on 5. So the sword must be very good considering orcs get (I think) bonus to axes
---
That's the way she goes bubs. Sometimes she goes... Sometimes she doesn't.
---
No problem, I think more people should test this to gather more evidence if Blizzard isn't working on it already.
---
Exactly. But they've also changed what they said in some areas. The players should be skeptical and speak out.
---
[Sometimes I don't even bother with the shifting part.](https://gfycat.com/emptybasicdogfish)
---
So no guarantee it will be gone until Phase 2. /u/Shiqznima talking out his ass.
---
&gt;I'm not sure whether the spec can reasonably heal in PvE 5-mans (and some raiding, though much less frequently)
---
Ofc it can, it has like everything important for a heal.
---
That's not a bad idea at all. If you can get ahead of others a bit, or skip a couple of quests, you could easily just start grinding on them.
---
Yeah it's not nearly as big of a deal as people make it out to be, but at least for once one of these "PROOF INSIDE" threads actually had valid proof inside.
---
No idea why you think it would be completely dead after a few weeks. That’s a pretty ridiculous statement.
---
My dude, you might wanna look up a thing called "European Union"
---
I’ll try and aim for the TF but sounds damn near impossible to get. But then again, it’s a grind no matter what, really. Thank you for your input
---
Hi, /u/Shiqznima
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c3gejh/lol_esfand_no_way_merging_to_a_single_layer_is/). 
---
I ran into a group of douchebags in the barrens that must have just discovered you can poly shit people are fighting, because I was like level 16 just doing some normal quests and a mage and a shaman just kept following me around polymorphing mobs while I was questing. I really hope they fix it.
---
True, wanted one for a while. I'm the type of person who would have to research on reddit before buyingjust to minmax for the best one though
---
At what point do we stop counting in months and start counting in years.
---
Try breathing through your nose so your brain doesn't overheat
---
&gt; I think Blizzard is seriously out of touch
---
You don't have a phone?
---
I dont watch him, did he really say all that? Also ninja looting 40 man raids or ninja looting stuff he doesnt need from 5 mans?
---
So might as well make them official and not have people stuck in a spanish server when they don't speak that language.
---
Less people will be aware of the unofficial server, making it less populated, and all those that don't speak the language will leave, leading to a quicker death to the server.
---
Official national servers makes the most sense in all aspects.
---
So many wholesome people ... well, not this guy. I plan on killing low level players. Tease them with Mind Flay, then when they're on low health, cast a Shadow Word: Pain and leave. Leave my mark on them and move on to the next target.
---
Would need a 7-10PM guild and a 12:30-3:30AM guild. Also need to swap between them bi-weekly. Also won't raid if I am passed on all loot.
---
this is exactly why I purchased my first 4k.  32" 4k &gt; 2x 24" 1080p monitors all day.
---
At 2 years or 24 months
---
This is another reason why I want a couple of servers that never implement layering of any kind. I don’t trust that it’ll be gone fast enough to not have a negative impact on my experience.
---
Where is it going????
---
Let's hear it, or are you just gonna repeat the "oh it's not authentic!!" Thoughtless garbage everyone else does. I'll give you a minute to Google some options.
---
Gonna have a look at it. My thoughts were also towards the racial skills and thus axes. But according to various link in the thread it’s a sword that’s the top-dog. But realistically I may never actually get the sword. Thanks for input
---
There's no guarantee either it will ever be gone. It was their current target and that's all we have. The way he said it, yeah it was wrong, but it had at least some kind of info as backup.
---
Yeah. And while we are at it, why don't we just make one giant megathread for all WoW related topics? Let's call it a subreddit.
---
No the goal is to avoid gank while still being able to gank anyone that don't abuse it. Best of both world /s
---
If you cant log in the beta for some reason you are not in the Beta..
---
HotW is cool if you want to be a casual tank/healer. So basically only while running dungeons. If I'm gonna Feral tank in raids it's going to be the proper spec. Natural shapeshifters is required for pvp, so that spec would not be for PvP like you want. The only Druid specs that can be used in Raids/PvP are Feral dps, and the Flag Running spec.
---
Ya know what a shit barometer is bubs? It measures the shit pressure in the air. You can feel it! Listen Bubs, hear that? Sounds of the whispering winds of shit. ...Beware, my friend. The shit winds of stormwind are a coming.
---
Oh did they remove layering already then? If not, the discussion about removing it cannot die or we will never be rid of it.
---
Because millions of BfA players will try the game out? The hype is huge and the game is free for them. Retail kids will easily make up 75% of the population on day 1.
---
If it's 2 weeks, I doubt casuals will be in STV. I was hardcore leveling on release and our top guys were taking 4-6 weeks to get to 60.  Granted, everything is laid out for the spergs. But if people who are just looking to organically play wow classic, they won't be in STV in 2 weeks or they'll just be getting there.
---
I'm sure there will be high level gankers in every layer either way, so they can all get their precious vanilla experience.
---
Good one nerd - a few weeks to phase 2 could be a pretty big amount of time depending on how blizzard wants to handle releasing phases... which nobody knows because blizzard hasn't officially spoke about their plan.
---
I don’t get it.
---
I don't see how a player could expect to start there at Level 11 and realistically complete those quests without being carried in a group. A warrior would be constantly fighting mobs their level for example unless you stopped and grinded a couple levels out.
---
So blizz would basically be lying to the player base in saying they're getting what they want, put up some smoke in mirrors to make it seem like they're doing what they said, then the player base gets really upset when they find out the servers are basically the same as they are planned for release now? 
---
If I'm wrong please correct me, but this doesnt seem to be the most optimal solution.
---
Probably. Elemental you need to be in close range for blastwave and fire last while they're frozen to get shatter+ignite combos. Means you're also getting hit a lot. Need a lot of stamina. The damage isn't as burst-y as PoM/Frost but you can do it more often.
---
So you'd rather have an experience not at all like the Vanilla one. Tell you what. You start up your own server and play how you want. Modify it to your heart's content. The rest of us will do what we want, which is Classic.
---
What addons were you using?
---
Having national servers doesn't prevent you from reliving the same experience you had. So why are you for preventing other people from reliving their own experience ?
---
I mean layering/phasing has already jumped from "just for launch" to "until phase 2 at the latest".
---
What happens when phase 2 hits and there hasn't been a big enough drop in pop? 
---
"Unfortunately layering will have be until phase 3"
---
Underrated, except for the overheat part.
---
Oh and Balance 30/0/21 could work also.
---
So I'll put you down for massive multi-server merges a month in. Thanks for the answer.
---
I really appreciate you answering it in a way that makes it clear you have NO idea what you're actually arguing about and just want to be mad cuz "muh classic".
---
Have a great day :)
---
Remember when the original preview website back in 2004 promised steam tanks for guilds?   
---
I sure do.
---
I believe Embriel is lying for whatever reason (he seems to have become an advocate of layering so this might explain it). 
---
This did not happen in Vanilla.
---
The damage will already be done and the server's economy will suffer till the end because of the lack forethought.
---
I never played classic, is there something special about that hat? I see it referenced a lot
---
Cool thanks
---
Ya sounds like everyone is pointing to frost at 60 for pvp
---
Reason im asking is because re speccing in classic is not cheap so harder to play around with specs.
---
But what if you want to have a male character with healthy back posture?
---
Neither- blizzard will do what they please.
---
We get to decide whether or not to play it.
---
Without layering, realm pops will be balanced around a normal server sized number. There will be TONS of tourists from retail, as well as players from back than on nostalgia trips. Classic is by current standards a very grindy and slow game, but it's hyped into oblivion. Tons of people will quit a rather short time after launch - that's half the point why layering exists in the first place. A server with 5 layers has \~15k players. To collapse these layers into 1 layer, 12k of these players "need" to quit, and that's what Blizzard seems to aim for. I assume they're right, tons of people don't know how vanilla really was. The majority of remaining players will be the pserver crowd with a certain, smaller amount of veterans/retail players.
---
You have no basis for the "will be in the first few weeks" other than a developer saying what he'd like to see happen while that same developer promised it wouldn't be in by 2 months out.
---
I'd rather bank on the promise than the preference.
---
Similarly, I'll be the guy who chimes in on political arguments with a slightly provocative claim, then gets progressively more ridiculous to see how off the wall I can get before people realize.
---
I'm pretty sure that /1 is layer specific, so good luck getting an invite to a different layer by asking other people on the same layer as you.
---
Hi all,
---
Please make sure to get the artist’s permission before reproducing their work. Artists often make a living from their sales of prints and merchandise. 
---
There is a lot of info going around in this thread - /r/wow supports creators, please make sure to support artists directly where possible.
---
I don't recall seeing anything like this during Vanilla.
---
an Asmongold ass licking contest?
---
Adderall has different affects for people who actually have adhd. Noob.
---
So if wow was only released in Chinese would you play it?
---
Considering this is a deal breaker for many people it will cause more dead servers than if we had national servers.
---
Apparently, but idk if we can call that "playing"
---
Well I absolutely trust Blizzard over some basement reverse engineer.
---
These are some sexy macros
---
Imagine posting screenshots every 2 seconds on the subreddit for attention.
---
Why do you think they would make up a population on a realm with no layering? If they don’t have the patience to stick on a layered realm past a few weeks, they’re not going to spend hours in login que or hanging out in the starting zone fighting over boars for hours. If anything non layered servers would end up with the healthiest population long term because it’ll be filled with the type of player who really desires the classic experience.
---
Jesus, someone doing the math and making sense!
---
The only way these people want it is one layer, but same server caps as vanilla so we're all in queue or we get dead/merged servers later on.
---
I get it, I'm not a fan of layering as well, but for a release that will have a large rose tinted playerbase and it will quickly fall off once they see how long it takes to level or they all won't poopsock to 60 the first week.
---
Interesting.. don't you have to raid as combat though.
---
Doesn't really sound like what Blizzard should be striving for.
---
What was the cheapest you could find?  Because for that 22x50 size I am finding the lowest around $150.
---
1. I kind of enjoy arguing with you xD, you have a different opinion, but your not insulting in any way. This is not common nowadays haha
---
2. Shards would be used to smooth out the "leveling" experience. Layers are used solve the long term problem of players leaving after day 3 or 15.
---
3. Pvp only partially, we have to see how easy it is to "layer hop" to avoid pvp situstions. But since there is no pvp reward it won't mater that much. But I see your point.
---
4. Economy. Its a fresh server nobody will have gold and everybody will safe money for mounts etc. Also most of the "valuable" items are used for raid consumables which will be used by the top players for faster early progression so these items will be "gone". But I understand if you if matters to you
---
5. To break MY emersion it would take me out of this will happen every 15 minutes instead of once every few hours. I think you overestimate it a bit.
---
6. I still want to know a better solution xD
---
I'm not at all advocating they ever add arena to Classic, but arena is the best PvP WoW ever had, hands down.
---
Lol yep, there’s the roflpwn part.
---
1. A dead server.
---
2. Hour+ long queues.
---
3. Layering.
---
Lawl I dont need your attention bro, you can get off your high horse I dont give a damn.  
---
Im just posting some screen shots for the community to enjoy in a nice format.  
---
Honestly idk how to post multiple pics
---
Your whole leveling experience will be like this, so sad
---
That's a hold my beer moment. 😁
---
Thanks for the response! I'm not familiar with the Flag Running spec; could you link to it pls?
---
Yeah, those are definitely all worse than streaming.
---
"A developer" Ion is "a developer"
---
Have fun back I'm fortnite after 2 months :)
---
I wish the mods here would layer all the EU players the fuck out. This EU sperg spam is annoying as fuck.
---
You would really have to have like 80% plus for one language to take over a realm. With limited realm count it's likely unlikely as the populations will be high and the tourism decrease is expected to be high.
---
The “tourists” would recollect to a different server that had layering after about 15 minutes in the login que.
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c3gikj/thank_you_omar_for_some_horde_love/). 
---
The World Bosses are a pretty big guarantee. If Layering still exists when they're phased in, that's potentially infinite raid loot for one guild.
---
I'd honestly love to hear about those other solutions. Launching with a multitude of servers is the only alternative I can come up with, which  has its own problems.
---
Cool, thanks for letting me know you are just an asshole that can't imagine people enjoying classic.
---
I didn't read the whole thread, but this post says "auto attacks" and the one you linked is for "instant attacks."  I'm going to assume you mean instant attacks.
---
I'll also add that while patch 1.10 did normalize speeds as they mention, it was NOT done across the board.  Rogues, for example, had ambush, backstab, and sinister strike adjusted for normalized attack speed, but not hemo (and mut?).
---
They also said it would only be in the starting zones. Their word holds 0 weight.
---
Nice business idea.
---
To expand on this, we always have a two-moderator verification system. If a user feels they were unfairly banned or their post/comment was unjustly removed, we encourage them to send us a ModMail to review.
---
A second moderator will review, and overturn if necessary. 
---
We often make mistakes, and need a second set of eyes to realize it.
---
Thank my friend! I’ll get on that
---
I will when I get home. I don’t pay attention to most private server stuff as none of it is accurate but if there is proof that private servers actually have hundreds of players using abilities in a zone with no lag then yes blizzard should be able to do the same. Just kinda hard to believe with the lag we get on live during events like the gnome race to booty bay.
---
We killed one on the Alliance side!
---
Que times obviously.
---
They can do 1 of these things:
---
-Layering (done properly with exploits and bugs fixed), with the amount of servers they feel will be needed long term
---
-Create more servers for the anticipated large mass at release then merge servers together down the line
---
-Only have the amount of servers they believe will be needed long term but increase spawn rates by a LARGE factor and basically have mobs almost auto spawning to deal with the mass
---
-Only have the amount of servers they believe will be needed long term and do literally nothing else and let 60 people fight over one mob spawn at time.
---
Which would you like them to choose? To me its obvious that layering is the lesser of all necessary evils. **Nobody advocating for laying is happy about layering, we just understand it is the best course of action to deal with the initial masses of players.**
---
I agree there are fixes they need to make to Layering, and that is what the community voice and effort should be spent on.
---
2-4 weeks is plenty of time for people to get to 60 and abuse it.
---
Hey guys check this out, turns out we were wrong and mages are actually good! /s 
---
Some constructive criticism on the video that I hope you don't mind -  I think you did a really good job of showing video clips that clearly displayed the points you were talking about (so many people just use random irrelevant gameplay footage). That being said, I don't think having your facecam on the video added any value. It's pretty clear you're just reading off a script while trying to look in direction of the camera. The narration was actually fine and clearly spoken (another thing people sometimes don't do well enough), but there's something odd about choosing to also put yourself on camera, and then being visually monotonous. 
---
I look forward to more "shit mages can do" content.
---
Thank you for the insane amount of detail. It didn't occur to me that vindication would take up a debuff slot!
---
So combining what you and the person you were responding too said, i have made this: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/505031015--052050512203051
---
I'm going for a spec where I can do a bit of everything, and mainly PvP but with the option to still do PvE on the same spec. I know, I don't ask for much... Do you think this would suffice?
---
They're trying to break the server
---
Personally I'm just here to see the eventual hype train succeed and the BFA player tears once people realize *en masse* that that Classic is better than any modern mmorpg and gives them that satisfying feeling from gaming they have been missing for the past 15 years.
---
Awesome!
---
I remember this one! The best part is Mograine's face in the first frame. He looks like he's trying not to puke.
---
&gt;English is the western world's 'common'.
---
No wonder French people don't talk to you guys.
---
Can't you see how rude it is to barge in a foreign country and start talking english like you own the place (if not the whole country).
---
Just say "Bonjour" and then ask for whatever you need in english, and you'll be surprised by how many French people can actually speak english.
---
tl;dr : English people being rude af to locals complains about being badly received.
---
I think they forgot that British English has like 100 accents and not just the one that Prince William has.
---
I'd like to throw my arc light spanner in for consideration.
---
Right but what OP is saying is that the Blizzard Launch will be tenfold. Let's hypothetically say, what one server launch experiences of about 15k people trying to get in, Blizzard's launch will consist of well well above 15k.
---
In part because guilds didn’t spam world buffs like private servers do, which OP and others (Def &amp; Mel) have proven are against the game’s design. Pandora’s Box has been opened, there’s no going back.
---
Would you be fine with dedicated servers not layered? I want all those things you listed if layering isn't on the table. Make a sizeable chunk of the servers non layered. Everyone wins.
---
Both are highly numerous, and something that we hope to be able to reign in as we move forward. We've nearly tripled in size over the past several months and are trying to play catch-up.
---
Great. Now just convince 4999 other people to subscribe for a minimum of 6 months with only access to that realm and you have a deal.
---
Gunna down vote tho!
---
Found the swede. Sluta vara så jävla självömkande.
---
No ele shaman is very gear dependent. I would highly recommend mage over shaman if you intend on being casual.
---
It's not a 5% damage boost to hunters and neither a 7% damage boost to rogues.
---
It's a damage boost for the AP scaling part of skills. It increases neither the weapon base damage nor the flat damage on skills, only their AP scaling. 9% for two handers, 5.8% for daggers, and the rest in between. Kinda dependent on the class, but it's probably a 2-4% damage boost.
---
Considering we already have 16 debuffs and more, bugs that make the game easier should have a rather high priority though. Needs to be fixed anyway.
---
Many people have posted about better solutions numerous times, including myself. But I doubt you actually care, or you'd investigate for yourself.
---
Sorry, I'm just tired of people effectively parroting "Source? Source?" as a way to discredit someone.

Have you considered that there is a good chance a spriest will be present in 40man raids?
---
Imagine if the cartography skill allowed you to get maps that led you into the other side's territory. Could be a WPVP enabler. 
---
Add in some sort of mechanic that you need to carry the loot back, Archeage trade-goods style, and that might breathe some life into WPVP when people get bored of it.

Just like the EU realms.
---
As a constant patron of /r wowcirclejerk we've already have up trying to out jerk this sub. 
---
Y'all are on another level.
---
I know about the mafia and I think it's a great example actually. 
---
They colluded, put in dedication and made a killing. And all of that without layering. 
---
People that have time and drive have a platitude of ways to make money. Abusing layering will just make it more easier. 
---
I think we're still far enough away from release that Blizzard can tweak their tech to make it better. [This person](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c3cjtt/sodapoppin_gets_ganked_and_simply_changes_layer/erqkihn/) had a great idea actually, I hope Blizzard implements something like it.
---
The community is split and I'm on the side of not having layering. Can we get dedicated non layered realms so people can pick the better experience they want?
---
Is the swiftmend spec useless for ganking in the world though? I was looking at that spec but assumed a deep \[healing spec\] couldn't hold its own in wPvP
---
Yes, the company is producing their product in order to make profit.
---
In other news: water is wet.
---
Its something we hope to be able to reign in as we move forward. We've nearly tripled in size over the past several months and are trying to play catch-up.
---
I'm personally hoping that as we get actual content, the repetitive discussions will die down.
---

This is wrong.  They aren't removing localization.  I wouldn't be able to read the stats on my gear if they were *localized* to Chinese.
---
What do you suggest as a better solution than layering?
---
This "ultra-pure" Classic mentality is borderline delusional. A 2019 launch is going to be much different than 2004. There has to be some changes. If they just launched straight up the game would be almost unplayable for weeks - that is, until people said screw this and stopped playing. Do you think it's still a "fun game" when people can't get out of the starting zone for hours and need to improvise other strategies to just level up? Maybe if you want a challenge server, but that's not the classic experience. The whole layering thing is being so blown out of proportion, Blizzard said they're removing it shortly after launch. "But Blizzard lies all the time!" If you really don't trust a company so much then why do you even support their service anymore? Play on a private server. The community is still going to do fine, everyone is being exceptionally dramatic about the national servers; I'm sure half the people complaining won't even be effected by it either, it's just the trend of being outraged on someone else's behalf. 
---
It may be inconvenient for some people, but they'll adapt. We adapted to 5 FPS in raids during the original Classic days, I'm sure we can handle this since *we're all adults now.*
---
All the world on one Pserver, what could go wrong
---
Could anyone point me in the direction of some resto shaman macros, preferably for totem placing etc.
---
Alternatively, a good addon would be great too.
---
Substitute adderall for cocaine nub
---
Fuck that guy for having fun and advertising the game to thousands of people.
---
I mean, what *have* they done? Fix the bread and butter bugs and glitches like they always do, while ignoring feedback regarding gamebreaking or not functioning mechanics while making awesome decisions like no language specific servers?
---
Y'know, like they did in BfA, Legion and WoD?
---
I'm Danish.. but I'm pretty sure you just proven my point
---
My question exactly.
---
Layering will have such a minimal impact on you and everyone else enjoying classic its laughable that you implied it would kill classic to begin with.
---
Thanks for not offering me a good day as well asshole. :)
---
I’m so excited for the over abundance of mages !
---
1) The @pet tries to target the pet. If you only use [dead] then it checks if your current target is dead. You would need to click on your pet's corpse to use Revive Pet in that case.
---
2) I did that in my edit to save space, but I left it in there in the example for consistency.
---
3) Ah bugger! You're right. I'll have to change that. Move it to btn:2 and btn:3.
---
4) Gosh, I don't know if you can call pet controls with /use. I have to assume not since they have their own /commands. In that case, no, I can't think of a way to get that functionality. You can get similar functionality with conditions, or modifiers.
---
Ah nice, thx mate!
---
World buffs were used on the very first KT kill.
---
Also what #Nochanges apparently means is that the game not the feeling should be preserved, in that case, world buffs should be too. 
---
Lastly, world buffs DOES NOT trivialize raids. It simply doesn't. Why? Because you lose them if you DIE. So if you world buff up to clear some content you don't know how to clear, you are gonna lose the buffs and you would've wasted your time. World buffs exist to clear content that is already on farm, that's what people use it for. For some pserver guilds that meant new content too, because well they've done it before so even first clear was essentially farm. Speeding up farm content with worldbuffs isn't a bad thing and it does not trivialize anything, because in order for world buffs to be useful, content has to be trivial already.
---
That is 100% New Londo Ruins

---
Dear professional Game Dev,
---
I don't want a game, I want an unplayable mess and everyone should agree with me because I have played on private servers.
---
Sincerely,
---
OP
---
In recent times on private servers there is usually a few guilds in the same discord with a loot system based on how many players in your guild were scouting at the time, amount of players in the 1st raid and amount of players in the 2nd and 3rd with diminishing returns.
---
That oh shit moment when your on the way home from work and kazzak is up scrooot scrooooooooot gimme that empyrian demolisher
---
Just layer inside the starting zone. Not after.
---
Layering creates an entire instance of the world, you're correct, but they could absolutely phase people from one layer to another between zones. Yes, there could be 10 layers, but that doesn't mean every zone has to take advantage of all the layers. If there was a load screen between switching I would think it's not possible, but we can clearly change layers without any loading. Whether or not they have triggers to consolidate layers as people switch zones, I don't know, but it wouldn't be off the table.

Do you realistically believe that Blizz is NOT looking into this?
---
You can gank rogues/warriors fine by kiting them to death with moonfire/insect swarm. If that's not what your idea of *ganking/world pvp* than I wouldn't roll druid. Going around killing people in cat form only work if you find noobs with way worse gear than you.
---
Shaman works fine with and without gear.
---
Characters ARE personal data. Which is all on the server. The game is on your HD. The server has all of the data (in the game) like who you are, where you are, what just happened, etc. But even so, many countries (but not the US of course) are now concerned with how much time someone spends in games, etc. They'll want to track that too.
---
I would. Assuming a 30% retention rate, a server with an initial 10k pop would be fine.
---
Is there a Orgimar print like this?
---
Well it's their own little German Reich.
---
I think layering will be needed for atleast the first week, I really don't see a way in which the game will be playable without it at least in the starting zones.
---
Investigate for yourself. I literally just responded to someone else just like you, and I'm honestly getting tired of having to respond to these types of comments with a concrete example. It's not like it's my idea anyway.
---
So Italians Portuguese and Spanish didnt play classic?
---

Other guy is right. Split raids with alts funneling gear is definitely the strategy of all mega tryhard guilds.

Pretty stupid comment overall. Very aggressive 2/10.
---
We will need to advertize it ingame, especially in the starter zones.
---
I’m just speaking for myself. I don’t want layering of any kind. Considering how controversial the feature is though I think there’s plenty of others.
---
I think people seem to forget that the stress test was litteraly them trying all manner of things with sharding. Why do you assume anything you got to play is final.
---
To be clear, I'm not saying "Don't critique it" but all this doomday naysaying isn't going to help either.
---
Exactly my thought.  I think, regardless of the stress tests, they are severely underestimating the load to their servers that will happen on launch day/week.
---
Good on this guy to not go: *"lol, what a noob im out"* but instead *"welp, this works and it sucks"*
---
"Take-overs"?? Well, since I'm spanish and there will be no specific realms for every language, why shouldn't I speak in Spanish with other Spanish people? What do you mean with "foreign languages"? Is Spanish a "foreign language" in Europe?
---
Not having national servers will make classic like retail where nobody speaks. The only reason it "works" on private servers (despite you not knowing how many people don't play on pservers  because of language barrier, and the fact there are many national pservers), is because they are comprised of mostly US which heavily influences the proportion of english speakers. On EU servers this will not be the case at all, communication will be very limited between some players.
---
It's one thing trying to make a UK/US native understand your broken english, it's another to have someone with broken english themselves trying to understand your broken english. You seriously underestimate how much this will affect the community.
---
I wouldn't give away my national server experience for anything, it doesn't come close to any pserver experiences which devolve to "lowest common denominator". People that want an international experience can still join the english realms where all countries not represented gathered like in vanila.

The two are synonymous for all intensive purposes. The way Magey is checking the damage is by logging auto attack numbers.
---
Well above 15k for each of their servers, or just overall for the region? I don't think there's anything wrong with a floodgate launch for the first day, however I also don't think people would mind layering so much if it was only for the first 2 zones for the first 2 days.
---
Listen, lad. I built this kingdom up from nothing. When I started here, all there was was swamp. Other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same, just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp. So, I built a second one. That sank into the swamp. So, I built a third one. That burned down, fell over, then sank into the swamp, but the fourth one... stayed up! And that's what you're gonna get, lad: the strongest castle in these island
---
You're just nitpicking what frame of reference I was using. I simply compared the actual numbers to the expected numbers. I wasn't factoring in how much of an overall DPS increase these abilities are.
---
see you wug 27. Im not a streamer :(

Whose the blue guy? And isn’t that the Irish flag?
---
It's from Scarlet Monastery and drops off the last boss in Cathedral. It's the best hat you can get for a caster around this level and almost everyone ends up getting it at some point, but no one knows how to pronounce it. So its just kind of a meme-ish item due to popularity of it and that no one can say it right.
---
Just hypothetical (sorry, don't want them to get any ideas):
---
On a normal server there's 1 world boss for a pop of 3k people. If there are now 15k players and 5 layers, Blizzard COULD spawn bosses on all 5 layers and allow them to be killed. New layers spawned after the boss is dead won't get him, and old layers being closed lose him. This would mean an identical or lower bosses/pop count. It's not impossible so "solve".
---
But I hope Blizzard keeps their word and doesn't do that shit.
---
I don't want the whole Reich in Classic.
---

The point behind the no changes movement is for blizzard to create an experience as close to the original vanilla wow experience as possible within reason. Certain things like layering are being added because it would be unreasonable to expect them to let the servers crash on launch, and certain things aren't being added, like cycling through the patches with all the balance changes. While using old hardware would create a more authentic vanilla experience, what hardware someone is using is out of blizzards control and even if it wasn't it would be logistically impossible for them to supply every player with old hardware. Which is why it's outside the realm of reason, and why that argument is invalid when discussing more reasonable things like leeway and spell batching.
---
If we must keep layering, then just have it for level 1 to 20 zones for the first few weeks. That’s it.
---
Well don't start playing until November and you won't ever have to experience Layering.

---
Might be better off as a warlock then...  Same spec for both.
---
Because the reason people like vanilla is that it's a sandbox where you decide how you want to play. Unintended gameplay is why vanilla is good, you shouldn't get to pick and choose which unintended gameplay you get to have. This "#nochanges except when I want changes lol" mindset is a retarded slippery slope. Anyone can arbitrarily claim what is and is not "in the spirit of vanilla". World buffs incentivize guild VS guild battles, they incentivize general PvP in blasted lands, they incentivize PvP outside of dire maul, it makes the world feel alive. You see entire guilds traveling to leveling dungeons and controlling the entrance for an extended period of time. Removing all of this from the game because you're too lazy but still want to be an epic dragonslayer and "compete" on DPS meters despite 1 unlucky resist making you bottom the charts for that entire raid is silly.
---
The point isn't that it'll make interactions impossible, but that it will kill the community. You don't think you would have had more fun in that raid if you could have at least talked to the other players? Might as well play retail if you don't want to speak to anyone.

Ok bud here:

Which would you like them to choose? To me its obvious that layering is the lesser of all necessary evils. Nobody advocating for laying is happy about layering, we just understand it is the best course of action to deal with the initial masses of players.

They dont know the real number of players and how fast or slow they will play, so they cant be like 1 week after release its gonna be off, if in that week the players havent spread out enough or starting zones are still a mess they would have to wait.
---
Ideal scenario is they monitor it and just turn it off no matter how much time has pased.
---
And they think that because the players have spoken. You are trying to make a company sound bad by doing something for profit? Yes, Blizzard is not a charity. Shocker.
---
Sorry forgot the /s
---
Or we could have a server with no layering and in November we can revisit this thread and see who had the right idea.
---
Not necessarily, on the pirate servers I played, French and Russians especially kept entirely to themselves, and if they joined a regular ol' pug, they seemed to do so begrudgingly and with as much intent to make life difficult for the raid leader.
---
And on the flip side, if there were groups made by those guys on the world chat, its because they were *really* desperate for a certain class. Otherwise they'd just stay on their own /frWorld, /ruWorld and not interact with anyone else beyond seeing them out in the open world; that's pretty meaningless.

Do you have a source on the bindings not dropping until phase 2? First I have heard of that.
---
Actually a blue post said layering will be gone by the end of stage 1... which could be several months after release.  I take what ion says with a grain of salt these days.
---
I agree but layering by definition can't be confined to certain zones, so that's a mute point. We're arguing time for removal here not zone restriction.
---
That'd be great if it didn't mean one guild would kill him on all the layers by hopping over. And you can't control when a Layer merges with another. If two fights are going on at the same time, who loses the boss? Or if one Layer has killed him and you're still fighting and your Layer merges because of the sudden drop in population, do you now lose him mid-fight?
---
It just wouldn't work.

You’d only use SL in PvP if you were god awful at Vanilla. Skilled Locks go destro or affliction. SM/Ruin is a spec you can use in PvP and PvE.

They could remove layering for zones with world bosses or come up with some other idea. Who knows with Blizzard these days.
---
All Im saying is that there is absolutely no guarantee for anything regarding WoW and Blizzard. They have proven time and time again that they can come up with the most ridiculous and silly ideas and stay with them.
---
I loved getting here. IIRC you need an epic mount and water walking to do it cleanly, right?
---
During Wrath some friends and I would go there to chill and duel. Good times.
---
&gt;	They barely existed in raids back in vanilla. The world leading guilds in progression didn't begin to use them deliberately until Naxx, and even then it was not widespread
---
Where is this revisionist history about Vanilla players not knowing about world buffs or flasks until Naxx come from? You think people never realized they got buffs from turning in Ony heads or Hakkar hearts?
---
People absolutely used world buffs throughout Vanilla. In my own guild we used them on Ragnaros / Nefarian / C’thun / Loatheb for progression. The reason they weren’t widespread in every raid was because they were usually unnecessary, and you didn’t want to rely on them in case you wiped on your first attempt. PServers use them a lot for speed clears, but we didn’t do that in Vanilla because we didn’t need buffs on chill farm status raids.
---
Munich, and it really wasn't a difficult test - a few pages of text with around a hundred words missing, 30 minutes time. I got done in around ten (with double-checking). If you scored above 90 correct words, you passed. If you scored 80-90, you had to take a second test. If you were below 80, you failed.
---
Yeah that’s totally my line of reasoning and those topics are completely related -_-‘.
---
I agree, it was great fun seeing a new meta evolve out of the level 15 cap. I thoroughly enjoyed  my time and the people I met. CAN NOT WAIT for classic to launch
---
And had a ton of servers and still lots of angry people
---
&gt; But when I think about world buffs and nochanges, it seems like removing them from raids would actually be the nochanges choice.
---
Lol what?
---
&gt; The world leading guilds in progression didn't begin to use them deliberately until Naxx, and even then it was not widespread.
---
We stacked world buffs on our very first Vael kill. And again for Nef. And again for Twin Emps. Almost every raid night we'd have at least one.
---
&gt; It was clear Blizzard never intended them to be stacked and abused in raids.
---
[Except one of the lead people behind Vanilla WoW recently said the exact opposite](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/440538861?t=0h21m12s).
---
&gt;World buffs were used on the very first KT kill.
---
I understand, and I wrote this in my post. Maybe you didn't fully read it. The fact is, in vanilla 99.999% of players who stepped into raids were not stacking world buffs because they did not realize how strong it was. This is the point. 
---
&gt;Also what #Nochanges apparently means is that the game not the feeling should be preserved, in that case, world buffs should be too.
---
Again, I laid this out in my question. What I am curious about is why this definition is held above the game experience definition?
---
&gt;World buffs exist to clear content that is already on farm
---
This is a post hoc explanation of world buffs that's clearly untrue. With 100% certainty this was not what Blizzard intended with world buffs. They didn't understand how powerful the interaction would be, because when it became commonly used, they immediately patched it. 
---
 I understand your point about it being an aid for guild who have content on farm, but I'm not exactly sure why the strongest guilds should need a 50% dps boost. And I would strongly disagree that world buffs don't trivialize content. Vanilla content 
---
It is also disingenuous to pretend that a 50% dps buff doesn't trivialize content. No, it doesn't guarantee success by any means, and wipes will still happen. But when gear upgrades provide a roughly 1-2% dps bonus, the relative strength of these buffs are totally ridiculous.
---
People want more than "getting their message across" in a game where the community aspect is so important. In what language should I translate that for you to understand ?
---
GET. FUCKING. RID. OF. LAYERING. 
---
DUMBEST. SHIT. EVER.
---
The new Legion Return to Karazhan had a unique line aswell, nice touch, but Atiesh is still a weird legendary
---
And what does you being Polish have to do with anything I said ?
---
When in Rome, do as the Romans do, when in France, you say speak French first and say "Bonjour" before all else because not doing it is rude. That also true when French people talk to each other.
---
I rate your comment Entitled/10.
---
I thought the same
---
It was literally done dozens of time.
---
4-5 days to ding 60. 2 days max of gear grinding.
---
Hydraxian rep is easy 4 mages does it within 3 hours.
---
The question is not if its possible. The question is do they want to do it or not.
---
Ragnaros is really easy to gear against as you need to pump up 1 tank with fr gear from the whole guild (easy) .
---
Only hurdle of week1 mc clear is maggmaddar as with only 1 tranq shot avilable at first raid with an undergeared raid you do need some luck/tank rotations to make it through the enrages
---
This is grossly inaccurate if you are talking about ele shamans in pvp.
---
This is a fundamental problem with multiculturalism in real life as well.

If you are making raid tank for Horde i would recommend going for Troll warrior.

I saw the bodies but didn’t know what happened

Isn’t this s deleted scene from the movie?

Everyone predicted this.

As long as there are RP servers with strict naming conventions I'll be pretty happy. We don't need XxX69Pussyslayer42069n0sc0p369XxX to be on an RP server.
---
On my screen I saw him get down to about 15%, then I DCed. A shitton of DoTS were hitting him.

You want me to bring up the talent calculator and make it for you? Just look it up dude.
---
Choose to play Classic with Layering or choose to wait until it's gone or choose not to play at all. I really really don't give a fuck and neither does Blizzard.
---
I killed lord cobrahn in WC as alliance
---
I went to Amsterdam when I was 18 (27 now) and I can feel that Thunderfury name! I ment to get people to get together and I am downvoted because people want the different servers. Just trying to find positives, like the dutch! For the Horde!
---
"The only way"  
---
You are retarded man. Just stop posting.
---
The raid boss heads should be allowed because they're raid content. The guy who gives out the King buff to collect the Tribute buffs should only be able to buff 5 unique players per instance ID. Shuffling a raid through a clear or two of Tribute is bullshit. If a raid wants to go in with Tribute buffs, then all 40 of them should have to clear it.
---
Good thing there's mods for morons like you then.

This is my problem as well, lol. But the art is amazing!
---
Nope :(
---
There's no such thing as "today's gamers". And there are more people playing games than ever before.
---
The right people will appreciate Classic. People who prefer something more fast paced will stick to Fortnight, etc. This has always been the case. In the past they played CS or Doom or what not.
---
I was getting like 2 fps, kek.
---
I've been through many Blizz betas and they almost never (historically) patch the issues with the beta client.  They make the changes for the live client and just keep on trucking in beta.  That tends to cause a lot of "OMG! WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO FIX YOUR SHIT BLIZZ?!" Posts.

---
If I’m being honest for classic this would literally have no effect. 
---
Let’s say players banded together over an issue like layering and cancelled subs the the point where classic failed. 
---
At this point what would happen is literally noting would change at Blizzard due to internal politics. 
---
Sure. There might be a postmortem but they would blame the failure on other reasons. After all, you really trust the guys who say “you think you want it but you don’t” to understand or be honest about why you cancelled a game?
---
Financial success has ruined the company because poor decisions are no longer discouraged in any meaningful way. 
---
The best we can do is be vocal while the ignoramus blizzard cult people parrot blue talking points from the Blizzard forums all day.
---
You don't think there's going to be abusable ways for people to make gold even without layering? See the devilsaur mafia on private servers.. it literally doesn't matter. The top 1% of players will always find a way to abuse shit it's the circle of life
---
okay man Im sure the mods are very upset with me, have a good day
---
then don't pay it
---
Layering bad.
---
Temporary feature bad.
---
Reeeeeee
---
Even with layering on the stress test, Valley of trials was so bad for hours lol.  Me and a buddy together, only have 1 quest to start (10 boars) and that was probably a good 45 mins to complete.  We honestly only did it that fast because they rebooted the servers every 10 mins which would either force respawns or cause us to switch layers so magically i see 3 new boars.  And we couldn't just grind mobs to level either, no scorps around, no imps, the cave was being farmed.  
---
Echo Isles quests as well were brutal.  Full group of 5 competing for the 12 trolls alive with 10 other groups of 5 ppl.  Spent a good hour in there on 1 quest for sure.  
---
I don't know if they can fix that with layering since its a full server cluster thing, but if they "accidentally" enabled fast respawns in the 1-10 areas for like a week, I would not complain lol.  I get it, "no changes", but man valley of trials is just terrible gameplay if crowded lol.
---
Any important Macros that every Mage should have??
---
This version of the leeway mechanic is from like MoP though, isn't it?
---
Are you kidding me dude, you can log onto any vanilla server and run the dungeon. There are a million videos online of people running that dungeon. Your video does not belong on this subreddit.
---
&gt; buttons that dont help
---
too real man
---
Never noticed the little whelpling scouting out his prey! lol
---
The problem is if they make 10 layered servers and 2 non-layered servers, they're going to have 70% of their population on 17% of their servers.
---
That aren't layered and have even more of an overpop issue.
---
Nice setup. I like the giant mousepad
---
Is this true? From what I understand, early PvP warlocks go soul link.  Then once you have gear you can go conflag.  Which of these is good for pve?  I always thought pve warlocks go affliction?
---
Honestly, I couldn't agree more. I think the expansion system is difficult to use without taking away from the currently existing content in azeroth. Just stating that unfortunately it's a possibility, one I which they don't choose and instead I'm hoping they take a stab at classic+ eventually.
---
RIGHT! I met a dude while I was running from Darnassus to Ironforge (taking tram to SW), and we just talked and joked for half an hour, the sense of community is so much better, and that's something I really missed.
---
intents and purposes
---
I’m completely free to pitch alternative ideas. If you don’t care then why are you posting in this thread? Also, don’t act like you speak on Blizzards behalf.
---
Yes please. Great work from Magey.
---
A raider in Death and Taxes, try hard as they come, confirmed on a stream they didn't even world buff in AQ40. Maybe they did in Naxx but no one did Naxx at a statistical level... So was world buff stacking actually in Vanilla?
---
They removed it in TBC because it was discovered formally.
---
Okay, sorry, I was just trying to help out.
---
Everyone who had the stress test client has this and there are literally posts about this every 5 minutes and that has been going on for days - I have no idea how you and the rest are able to miss this constant spam..
---
Mouse wheel down for placing/ going defensive.
---
Mousewheel down + control for following me/ passive
---
Mousewheel up for attack.
---
Mousewheel down for return
---
They hold out on the name tags to see how many players there are of each language and where they go to.
---
Actually there is such a thing
---
I'd just spec into wand specilization in arcane and the rest into my respective tree while leveling.
---
Okay, you put in effort, so I'll acknowledge that and respond cordially.
---
Firstly, just confirm for me that you aren't the type of person talked about in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Negareddit/comments/91a5cy/often_when_people_ask_for_sources_on_reddit/) (except wow not politics). I'm not entirely convinced you actually care about my suggestion, because I've had this same conversation at least 20 times in the past week, and people love to claim victory as though it's a fight when I refuse to give a source and encourage them to find it for themselves.
---
Secondly, and most importantly, this isn't even my idea. And it's not a new idea either, people have been suggesting this since before Blizzcon.
---
Thirdly, I'm not going to type it out, but I'll link you to a comment thread from yesterday. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c2q64h/layering_defeats_world_pvp/ermbeoz/)
---
[Read this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c2q64h/layering_defeats_world_pvp/ermbeoz/).
---
All I can see is the butt
---
Jesus christ dude he was just making suggestion, why are you mad about that?
---
This is how you make ground beef.
---
Are you forgetting RP-PVP realms?
---
So what if both A&amp;B have horribly low population while C&amp;D have outrageously high population? Do A&amp;B still merge to still have a smaller pop than either C or D? Do you then do an unplanned merge with A&amp;C and B&amp;D? 
---
You have to ballpark estimates regardless of your method. Everything is speculation and nothing is solid until the time comes to cross that bridge
---
It's not hard to look this up in r/classicwow since a million ppl before you have posted the exact same thing in the last 24h or so.
---
yeah the horde killed the first one in seconds
---
No changes = not changing anything about the game, for better or worse. Doesn't mean anything more than that. Either you want changes or you don't, pick a side!
---
Well they're deleting your posts so.
---
Layering should be starter zones only.  Simple as that.  Contested zones should be off limits.
---
I leveled to 15 and did DM on stress test and I still had fun and it didn't ruin my experience. The overwhelming majority of people don't want this, only a very vocal hardcore few.
---
My only problem is that they may start cracking down on Private Servers more when Classic launches.  So that means we have to go play on Blizzard's servers if we want to play a game we bought 15 years ago.
---
So you’re saying that non layered servers would be too good of an idea to implement on just 2 realms.
---
Damn, you got that uploaded quick.
---
This happens to me on spanish, translation is really bad, worse offender is that they translate proper names and names of cities, i shoukdnt have to learn all the zones twice because some translator 15 years ago tought it was a good idea.
---
Le boo hoo.
---
I know it sucks dude, but most games have EU servers that aren't combined.  We do just fine in Dota, and the ruskies aren't even separated out.
---
A warrior with Sulfuras :thinking:.
---
Well, despite what the sword supremacists would like you to know, Sulfuras is the best weapon you can get till C'thun or r14.
---
Same way they don't want humans to know the 30 top end damage is in no way better than utilizing mace or sword racials.
---
Imagine being Ion, he played vanilla wow like a true turbo nerd.  Criticized the game for its unkillable bosses, gets hired onto the team.  He watches as TBC and wrath see their prime, he takes over and oversees the complete failure of the game. Such a massive failure the original game he played is being cried out to be returned.  
---
The game he didnt have his hand in and the game people crave!  100% his ego is destroyed, now he just needs to destroy classic wow.
---
Layering is not better than queue times or realm mergers.
---
Is Garrosh in this picture?
---
Yet here you are, commenting on them
---
It was probably removed for rule 7
---
I remember Whitemane's Chapeau and then for a Warlock or maybe Shadow Priest the Bad Mojo Mask from ZF.
---
It's not so bad as a mage since you can solo dungeon farm so easily. 50g respec is about an hour in most spots, less than that in some.
---
No, the segment of people on forums and streams you see do not represent every gamer out there. There is nothing special about gamers today. This is the same thing as the previous generation talking about the next generation. The group is simply too large for such a generalization.
---
They listened to a massive wall of signatures saying we want the game.
---
Now they're in the middle of a long elaborate ploy to prove we don't actually want it.
---
The paid ones.  Free transfers were always circumstantial.
---
Not to hand, but even if they dropped in phase 1, you wouldn't be able to craft until phase 2 as you need elementium ingots, which only drop from bwl (hence why the bindings aren't in the loot tables for phase 1 afaik)
---
Welcome!
---
Most people aren't going to click that link, so in the interest of transparency here is what Kevin Jordan said:
---
"Were world buffs designed to be used all at once? Yes, though we discovered that was kind of.. kind of a mistake. It was just too much, you know. People can't turn down even the slightest advantage when it comes to progressing through difficult content so it established this feeling that you had to have all the buffs before you could even start, and collecting all the buffs was just too much. It was too much work."
---
Marketing.
---
There were always going to be changes.   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM).  Literally mentions a ton of changes in this talk - some force by technical implementation, some by choice.
---
The notion that they could just recreate the game with 100% accuracy needs to go away already!
---
DCed us to prevent the embarrassing loss
---
That there is my favorite flavor item in the game
---
You’ve got tunnel vision on the large German player base. What about all the other countries in the region who don’t have a large player base? Regional servers are not the same as country specific servers.
---
Europe has regional servers so why wouldn’t OCE have a regional server?
---
Yeah SM/Ruin is probably what I will be because I want to do both without respeccing all the time, but SL gives some pretty big advantages against rogues for example (the bane of warlocks *usually*).
---
Then again i have very little experience with warlock and I am looking to try something new so who knows!
---
Yet the posts are still getting deleted.
---
It wasnt the PC. It was because of the hordes of people gathering at the cities
---
Some streamers will be hiding their realms to avoid "sniping", so it might not be that easy for NA players.
---
This stress test was infinitely more stable for me than the last 2 for sure.  The first hour was full or server reboots but besides that it was smooth sailing for my 8 hours played 13 priest.
---
Because I'm tired of all the fucking Layering fixes, Layering complaints, Layering this, and Layering that. This game will have content spanning 2 years and this guy and every other pissant is stuck bitching and moaning about the first 8%.
---
Layering is simply not that big of a deal and it solves a lot more problems than it creates. Get over it.
---
How do you know they're ignoring them? Unless you have insight to their development you have no idea what they're working on or how difficult a problem is to solve.
---
As far as I know it wasn't gaurenteed on PS either
---
Fresh 60 shamans do about as well as any fresh 60 class, prebis shaman does as well as about any prebis class.
---
It's not game breaking, but it's a really handy trinket for PvP. And it's usually difficult to get due to the spawn and fighting others over it. Basically the first people to level up will get multiple chances to get it over multiple layers and people who level up a week later can go swivel. I guess it's kind of broken when everyone in your group has it and 99% of everyone else doesn't.
---
Many people are saying layering is a good solution. And it's not even the lesser evil, there are better solutions.
---
People are getting downvoted for saying "It's just the beta" because it's the same excuse Blizzard fanboys have been using for the past decade. Blizzard never changes what's in the beta. If it's in the beta, and it's not an actual bug, then it's going live. You'd have to be delusion to think they just "accidentally" added layering and they are "only testing it" but they will "totally remove it" before launch.
---
Running ST 500 times to get two \[Dragon's Call\] for my melee hunter
---
But they can still make money from it even with layering.
---
So if we excuse their actions because 'they are a company' we should start excusing rapist's actions because 'they are a rapist'?
---
Corporate apologists can fuck off.
---
Ah sweet I didn't even notice nice one.
---
What about the people who are proud of their language, the idioms, the sayings and words that simply don't exist in English? Shouldn't everyone have the right to express themselves in their mother language? Especially looking at a RP-Server, no native English speaker will be able to communicate on such a level without years of experience. It's simply as that.
---
This looks a lot nicer: https://github.com/cloudbells/FieldGuide
---
They did. On english realms
---
Says you. But for every person that spent hours in a queue every night or was forced to change their name and completely lost their realm's identity, Layering is nothing.
---
&gt;How do you know they're ignoring them?
---
Because I've been in Alpha and Beta for WoD, Beta for Legion, and after seeing Beta in BfA, I called it quits.
---
Okay, maybe I understand you now better. Thank you for admitting (I think french, german, russian, etc. are a bit entitled). I do not know if Iam right, usually not, but follow me:
---
You play other games on _english speaking servers_, why not WoW Classic, the Greatest MMO there is and have a new, authentic experience?
---
For real. Today's hardware is not 2004's.
---
I was able to hit 15 in a day
---
once the layering started it was extremely smooth. server 3
---
I'm fully expecting them to leave this in the game.  My guess is that they're double dipping their engineering work around layering within classic to be used in retail (to reduce the issues around phasing).
---
It would be really interesting if they intend on using classic as a live QA / pre-production environment for Retail.
---
luckily they were in the same layer!
---
Is Devilsaur LW and skinning like different from normal lw and skinning? What would you recommend all the other classes in my group going so we could be like group-sufficient
---
"Ok send me an invite, I can't see you cuz you're on a different layer Saurfang."
---
Good for you man
---
Lol im frozen cant play stuff anymore, waiting for 27th of August.
---
Yes.  Players were skeptical and divided before, but after watching several clips of people abusing layering, it's clear that it's a problem.
---
If Layering were what we thought it was at first (i.e. you have Windrunner 1, Windrunner 2, Windrunner 3...Windrunner 18, and then when Windrunner 1 and Windrunner 4 go below X active players, those layers merge) then it wouldn't be a problem.  If I create my hunter Huntardone on Windrunner 4, I'm always on Windrunner 4 until the layers collapse.  That way, we're still on the same server in the same community, but on a different layer.
---
You would obviously have to choose your layer so you can play with your friends or guild.
---
However, the only advantage this has over a realm merge is that the realm name stays the same, and you don't risk losing a character name.  The disadvantage is that it is more confusing "I'm on Windrunner, where are you?  Wait, I have to level to 12 again?".  Also, you have more competition for names.
---
Which is why just doing no layering is best.
---
Most Naxx gear didn't even get replaced until Kara.  Weapons especially, if you were a hunter with Nerubian Slavemaker, you literally wouldn't replace it until Sunfury bow off Malch.
---
Fair opinion
---
And I remember my deadzone as a hunter between melee and gun range feeling huge, but it was objectively only like three yards so a 2.66 yard leeway would almost eliminate it.
---
That doesn't mean my memory is right though, or maybe I was just terrible.
---
I like the way it's detailed but not over sexualised
---
Apology not accepted, how dare you care about something that has absolutely no effect on me as an American. This sub IS NOT for you to complain about not even being able to communicate on a basic level in a game that requires a lot of communication. It's a place for me to complain about sharding, layering, melee leeway, streamers, changes, private server tryhards, and the fact that my wife left me!
---

---
The problem is that they're making it into a Classic Content BFA server, which is not what players want.  We want Classic as best can be done.
---
about all i saw in the was people crying about unable to tag a boar. probably the same people who go booo layer booo
---
SL is an auto-win spec against all classes except SPriest. But, that’s also that’s why players don’t like to play it. That and it’s just very boring compared to conflag spec. 
---
Just be ready to farm those shards!
---
&gt; Give the game 4 days and all your starting zones, quests, etc. Will all be freed up again.
---
If this was the case layering would be gone in 4 days then. Problem solved.
---
because the posts get burrowed with downvotes and removed
---
Again this is grossly inaccurate.
---
Freeze yourself until classic drops for everyone.
---
okay, said player exploits it - how are you going to report it? what evidence will you have? i haven't played retail in 10+ years but I am sure you will need to right click the player to report, but if he layered out - nothing to report anymore. so enforcement of the ToS isn't gonna be enough and there is about 10k subs on this forum who knows this and more on the official forum... you don't think these 10k players told their guildies or will tell their future guildies about these exploits?....
---
Being a bomb ass paladin healer, hopefully.

Maybe today. But who knows what governments (or companies) will want (or buy) tomorrow. It's a very complex situation where governments are both trying to protect their citizens from being spied on and also trying to spy on their citizens themselves. They're trying to stop companies from data-raping us, selling every detail of every part of our lives, collecting every detail of every part of our lives. And you can bet someone, somewhere is willing to buy that data. I think we're seeing the very start of the internet, as we know it, dying. As more countries do this, [https://it.slashdot.org/story/19/06/20/2318212/us-tells-india-its-mulling-caps-on-h-1b-visas-for-nations-that-force-foreign-companies-to-store-data-locally](https://it.slashdot.org/story/19/06/20/2318212/us-tells-india-its-mulling-caps-on-h-1b-visas-for-nations-that-force-foreign-companies-to-store-data-locally) we'll see the internet going back to the days of the early 90s when you used a gateway to get out on the the internet. Except this time countries will have the gateways.  This should be FUN!
---
That’s not a good solution. That basically means that for however long they have layers the game won’t be authentic and the economy will be fucked from the start.
---
It doesn't.
---
Hmmm interesting video; I definitely do see the delay which you mentioned, however unfortunately without a combat log we still have no idea what the cause is, I mean it could definitely be the SoR hits or it could merely be a staggering of the white hits due to latency. At the least I am hoping my bug report gets them to investigate the seal system and check whether they themselves have gotten it right; and definitely SoR, I think this is worth the time investment given how seals define the class. And who knows I may be wrong; but myself and many others believe that at present it definitely does not reflect how it should be working.
---
And that’s all you need to see. Dragons are temporary, dummy thicc cheeks are forever
---
Who makes the most gph?  Hunters or mages.  How do they farm differently?
---
Heals as well.
---
PLUS I LIKE SEEING ALL THE 20+ PLAYERS ON THE SAME AREA AS ME!
---
thats the best feeling of a fresh realm and i only play vanilla for the population
---
Most of the time it's not even an event. They just follow him around and try to appear on his stream to block the camera with their mounts and other dumb shit.
---
I know that Finland is the only country in the world that has paid their World War debts fully. It is with this faith, that I believe people will try Classic with their fullest potential.
---
You've never worked in a corporate office before or made any executive decisions apparently....

Schedules get set and don't get removed early for a reason.
---
What are you talking about? Why are you assuming I didn't/wouldn't say 'bonjour' ?
---
In fact, i did, but that's beside the point. 
---
Is it a curtious and a nice thing to do? Absolutely! 
---
Is it reasonable to take offense when somebody doesn't do it? Fuck no. 
---
Why does it matter that I'm Polish? 
---
You referred to me basically as a 'fucking entitled Englishman'. I'm not speaking my mother tounge when abroad, I think it's plenty respectful if I speak in the language we both know. If there's no such language, there's simply no conversation to be hah.
---
If I'm not getting camped to the point of me logging out, it ain't classic.
---
Skarm seems to do well enough raiding as bear with 30/21
---
And as a druid healer aren't you mostly doing Rank 4 Healing Touch spam in raids?  Giving up Gift of Nature and Swiftmend for being a much better tank seems an okay tradeoff to me.
---
I did spend hours in a queue every night.  It was better than sharding.
---
Why?  Because I actually cared about the game and the community.
---
First of all, I'm not a native speaker. Second, it was an international university, which made it kinda odd for me. But yeah, there are enough young Swiss people who can't speak English either. I was just surprised, that's all. :-)
---
every game i played so far i enjoyed english servers more then national ones (for me its german). i have more fun with ppl from multiple countries then only playing with german ones, so i dont realy care if tehy implement national servers. most times english server have higher pop then national ones. the only thing tehy should implement is russian server because of the hyroglyph system they use.
---
Thought I would post a video of the layers being collapsed. Pretty cool technology, even if you aren't a fan of the layers.
---
Lol true
---
I was wondering if anyone noticed how downvotey everyone seems to be in this sub. I dont know if it's people who are here but not used to reddit or if it's just a trigger thing. For the most part I only down vote something if it's completely unnecessary/rude/trolling. If I dont agree with it then let it be. If I do agree then it gets upvotes. I thought that was the standard etiquette on reddit. This sub seems to have every post or comment downvoted in new.
---
They've already said it's only going to exist for the first few weeks, if people don't believe that there's nothing they can say that's going to convince them anyway.
---
Nice Pic! :D
---
the thing is we all knew these problems, blizz knows these problems too.  It's a case of - is this okay for launch so we don't get massive queues and server crashes?  I think most people say yeah.
---
No one likes it but it's better than the alternative and at this point there's no way blizz is gonna be able to figure something else out so this is just going to be what happens and we'll have to live with it for a month or so.

Naw, just play a healer or tank and quest or farm near the dungeon you want to do. 2 hours is plenty of time if you get a half decent group for most dungeons. Especially with a guild. Might be harder when you get to 60, but that is when you switch to farming and PvP during the week and dungeons on the weekend. :P

yes, the last 1000 people who posted this exact same image have not gotten beta access but you have 100% got it trust me.
---
The merged servers on live WoW were so disruptive and damaging to the communities they affected that Blizzard hasn't done it again in years despite the rapid decline in players, opting instead to use their sharding tech and cross realm group finder tool to enable players to play even on dead realms. Yet you see this as a good and obvious solution.
---
That’s a weak argument
---
I should clarify: it's faulty thinking when you are playing solo. It's often a very useful thing to do when you're communicating and strategising with the whole team.
---

---
Thanks, great answer. Is sharding going to stay the whole time?
---
You are lowkey baiting people with a message that essentially translates to "gear acquisition in retail, compared to vanilla is shallow and meaningless" while using LFR gear as proof.
---
This right here is the checklist of someone putting down the game while putting down 0 effort. 
---
I thought killing mythic Archimonde after 450 wipes was extremely satisfying and rewarding, for myself and 19 of my guild mates, most of whom care about the items.
---
But to be honest, if items is what you're mainly after in the game, then I can suggest Path of Exile. Because getting down a difficult boss with your boys is where it's at.
---
&gt; Honestly idk how to post multiple pics 
---
Pic hosting website (like imgur) make an album, link it.
---
Sharding and layering destroys communities and immersion. Source: BFA.
---
Remove layering and reduce the amount of realms to avoid dead realms. We don't need 10 pve pvp rp variants.
---
They wont make as much money if people quit or dont play at all because they don't like layering. If enough people speak up about it, they will change it.
---
That's one thing I loved about trying out the stress test. It was really refreshing to see all the short and simple names.
---
I know what he says but I'm pretty sure he meant just different layers, and yeah that is a difference but it's small

Could you provide a time-stamped in-game recorded combat log as a reference? Thats the problem unfortunately; hopefully however this bug report will at the least get them to investigate how the seal system works, and whether they got it 100%, it is definitely better to know if it is correct; rather then to assume something which looks broken isn't broken.
---
Thank you! I tried really hard to wedge myself up those rocks. I be callin' it "Zenkiki's Stand" henceforth!
---
Yeah but in this case they are **literally** testing layering.
---
Layers are dynamic...there is no scheduling around it. They will be able to be created/merged without a schedule.
---
I’m guessing you’ve been unsubscribed
---
Can you imagine SL warlock with opdots/drain and 100% upd destro spells...gg
---
And dis. Dis be Zenkiki's *last* stand.

which sucks because by then most people will be done with leveling and that's when server cohesion matters the most
---

Yeah, I'd be fine with that. I can't see how more options is a bad thing consumer wise. It's not that I don't understand the complaints, and it was fine 2 months ago..  but this happens almost every day, hence my reactions to the never layer crowd. If blizzard came out and made it optional, I'm sure everyone would be happy
---
I think they're both supposed to be good.  I didn't play Hunter in Vanilla, but I made good money solo hunting Devilsaurs for the leather, and its the most fun I've ever had gold farming by far.  There's the hunt, and then the challenge of kiting them without them killing you, and then that nice leather payday.
---
Pet classes have their own big advantages though, since they can solo stuff that nobody else can since their pet is a mediocre tank and you can mediocre heal them.
---
When I was leveling my warlock I could never get any of the caster gear from ZF to drop. So sad I was

Can you explain when you would press the shift key in your druid example? If I have this macro bound to key 1, for example, doesn't the game treat it as if I am not pressing 1 if I also press shift? As in, can I have a different spell bound to shift 1, or do I have to put this in a few different places? Or, do I press one then "really quickly" press and hold the shift key?
---
I'm quite dumb when it comes to macros so any help would be great. Your post is also extremely helpful, thank you.
---
The private servers that are vaunted for their lack of sharding/layering have this issue.
---
Can confirm, my first DM run (in a few years) a couple nights ago was done on my level 16 mage (now 21). I was brought strictly for polymorph in the foundry. It’s also not very hard to effectively CC with markers helping the group out every pull.
---
So you don't. Good to know.
---
For MC, so long as folks see you spamming frostbolt instead of fireball, you probably won't get flack for having a few inefficient points on a pvp only skill.

I'll probably catch a lot of down votes but dare I say, I hope so?

I was recently watching [This Video](https://youtu.be/sbGAOyeSWF0) on QoL changes still in Beta and while I do have a fairly strong stance on No Changes, fuck me things like Auto Loot (Because who leaves anything on the ground ESPECIALLY in Vanilla) Item Compare with Shift + Hover, suggest invite and Flight Path stop-button are all things I completely welcome.             
---
          
---
Thats not to say lets lean back on our laurels and not keep fighting for things like RP-PvP realms, Melee Leeway reduction, Europe dedicated language realms, ect. but I hope your right about whats in Beta is staying.

IS THAT HOW YOU SPEAK TO YOUR KING??
---
30/0/21 can work for early raiding and is solid for pvp
---
Your premise that they weren't used until Naxx is just wrong. We were stacking raid buffs when BWL came out and kept doing it for the next 18 months until TBC made them irrelevant. We even coordinated our raid times with other guilds so we wouldn't step on each others toes over their cooldowns. 
---
I distinctly remember doing a shit ton of Tribute runs while we waited for Predestined and Illuminati to login so we could turn in Onyxia, fly to Mulgore for Darkmoon, and then all of us hearthing to Kargath and sticking together as we ran into BWL so we wouldn't get fucked with by Alliance. And I remember this because it was finally the first night we killed Vael and I will never forget the sounds on Vent after it happened.
---
omfg we need a megathread for all the layering whiners.

---
The issue itself is significant, but it does indeed raise the question how such a massive (yes, weapon speed normalization is massive) aspect of damage calculation could in its entirety have been left in a Legion state.
---
As I understand it, the german and french communities are already coordinating on Discord, figuring out which of the classic servers they're going to claim. This happened in vanilla as well with the smaller EU minorities.
---
Obviously there's no problem for you to speak Spanish with other Spanish people, the problem occurs if a server which is supposed to be international, has 85% Spanish speakers. Then the last 15% aren't going to have an easy time communicating.
---
And yeah, Spanish is a foreign language in most of Europe, just like all the other European languages. That's the central problem right, if there were only a couple of languages being spoken and we could reliably have an even spread across realms, the proposed system is fine, but it's just not gonna happen.
---
&gt;I
---
k
---
Most people aren't going to be enthused by how things were on wednesday.
---
No layering its gonna cause more problems then its worth
---
If it's on the bug forum already, Blizzard's attention has already been brought. Just need people to keep checking each time a patch goes out.
---
That the problem, there isnt a viable alternative IMHO. There are other options but each has their own set of problems. Layering is the lesser of the evils IMHO
---
Well yeah it is, that's the point... like I said; HotW is for tanking/healing. OP doesn't seem interested in tanking so it's hard to recommend hotw in that case.  
---
And yes if you're purely just after raid healing, moonglow/Gift of Nature R4 HT build is considered the best. For general healing including 5mans/pvp, swiftmend is going to be a lot better though.
---
Are you actually trying to make Blizzard seem competent here? Despite themselves just recently admitting they were not listening enough? 
---
And sure, 1 Alpha, 3 Betas with watching the content turn out exactly as I suspected counts for nothing. Shill.
---
And you think that abusing Layering gives a player more advantage than getting 2 hours of playtime over you every night?

Sub to their Discords and mark their servers as a no-go? :)

Young waiters in cool places in Paris speak perfeclty english, if they notice your french is not good.

So you and your friend are going to play in tandem in the same area all the time and always make sure youre on a different layer. What happens if you end up on the same layer. How will you separate?
---
By the use of the word "retarded" I understand that you most likely are in the sub 20 years old category so most of this thing adults called "logic" will fly over your head?
---
I think the only reason I remember it so well is because I must have ran ZF with a Warlock a good 5 times one day for him to get that mask.
---
What is your solution then? Down servers and nobody plays?
---
the way it was handled back in the day. More Servers and Queue Timers. Offer Transfer if server is dying. MAKE THEM SPEND THEIR MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THEY HAVE ON CUSTOMER SERVICE RESOURCES!
---
they are being lazy with this half ass bullshit
---
Just curious, but why blacksmithing for a mage?  What do you get from its thats so good for pvp?
---
Why would I want to come up with an alternative to the mechanic that keeps servers from going low pop?
---
The game isn't even out yet and WHAT IF.....Blizzard turns layering off after the first month and people start to complain about server status / population like they did back when the game launched in 2004?
---
 No ice barrier? Do you even get ice block at 21 points?
---
Repost.
---
Especially if you are a tank or healer, 2 hours will be plenty to find a dungeon group. Now..if you want to be DPS, good luck until you are in a guild.
---
Players during vanilla did fade in at a certain distance, but not like that.
---
cool
---
Try pally, it’s super boring till you get 30ish
---
Just because he is a streamer and literally said he shouldn't be able to do it, means people have to single him out? Plenty have already taken advantage of this. Blizzard put this in the game and knew this could be an issue. Blame them.
---
I can't believe they added the very thing that ruined open world immersion. Launch with extra servers then merge, end of story. This layering thing does not only break the sense of being in a world (which is detrimental to classic) but it also seeps into the cracks and changes finite world resources into (in theory) infinite resources as the world itself becomes instanced. I understand there are internal financial politics at play here, but this is a deal breaker for me personally.
---
Aslong as you have alts on several layers (how monkeynews explained) you can just farm nodes over and over again.
---
Let’s see... 
---
1. It does expose a problem with layering. Absolutely. 
---
2. He did it to see if it works, and now has provided well publicized documentation of it being a fucked system. 
---
3. They can Keep it for non contested zones, but anywhere that material farming and WPvP can happen it has got to be changed or gotten rid of.
---
Frost is pretty much required for MC/BWL due to the Fire Resist everything has.
---
I got what I think is a pretty good idea here.  When you make your character, you pick what layer you are on and you are locked to that layer. Once the population of the server starts to drop you start merging the layers until all the layers are eventually gone, or, if people continue to play you will end up with sub servers within the server.  
---
This fixes the phasing out to avoid PvP and everything else like that. And it also fixes the 500 people kliling 1 mob, because you and you're friends will just go remake your character on a different layer if its like that.  Or, if you want to go through that and be on the super populated layer, you can do that too.  
---
  Seems like a good compromise?
---
I actually love warriors. I level as prot and revel in those pulls where you get three or four mobs and come out on top. I love tanking dungeons and never letting a hair on the healer get touched, even when things go sideways. I love it when the DPS marvel at how they couldn't steal aggro from me, even though they were split DPSing all out.
---
But I'm also autistic (literally), so maybe I just identify quite well with being the punching bag and enjoy being able to battle through it and come out on top
---
But how would they know what layer youre in? Or you know they're layer? Layers are not discrete they're dynamic. Now all of a sudden we went from "easily abusable" to "well if some spend there time creating a business around it"
---
If you can click play, yes. If you can't, no.
---
Lol we're talking about warlocks brother
---
Nice paitning.
---
&gt; you're pretty sensitive if that bothers you
---
Or maybe I'm not 14 any more and cant relate to pissing and moaning over getting killed in a battleground every 2 minutes. Why would I want to watch a streamer do that for hours?Sensitive about what exactly?
---
Whatever will I do with cheap mats?  How will I survive?
---
The stress test shows how hellish starting zones will be without it, but I quit during TBC, Mr strawman.
---
Mages are dogshit easy dude. You’re probably not even that good.
---
Imagine how this will impact the economy.  All farming spots and herbs and minerals will have x amount of more spawns throughout the world causing a huge amount of inflation.  Layering is TERRIBLE for the game, please do not include it.  Maybe in starting zones, but that's it.
---
dude you don't know wtf u r talking about.  There's no rigid schedule.  Layering will last as long as it's needed, up until phase 2.  That's completely dependent on the server.    It's coded to be done automatically.   The server will add and subtract layers as needed.  There will be a ton of layers at first, and as people become inactive over time, they will finally whittle down to a single layer.
---
Warlocks are mushrooms.
---
How would you address overloading these 6 sub-servers ? Split them up and break relationships or start fresh ones ? 
---
This idea is really good at scaling down (from 12 servers to 1) but requires exact projections on players numbers pre-launch, because you cannot scale up, ever. 
---
Also thanks for making me look this up :\^)
---
What i get from people here and the forums is that they will be ok with layering for a very limited time at launch and/or specific level zones.
---
Bug, characters shouldn't change layers while doing this. Report bug and move on.
---
Fire is perfectly fine for leveling.  One root for enemies you engage near max range is plenty, and you can always scorch em in the face if needed.
---
\&gt;  Merely overpopulated servers can be mitigated with optional realm transfers like they did in Vanilla. 
---
I was following ya until this point. Optional realm transfers were never taken in numbers that mattered. That was never going to be enough to actually alleviate the pressure on the overpopulated servers, or revive the dead servers they were offering transfers to. They didn't move for the same reason that dead servers stay dead, and overcrowded servers typically stay overcrowded. People want to join high pop, lively realms, and only a few loners want to play solo on low pop servers.
---
yes you have to raid as Combat. Combat Sword or Combat dagger that is . 19/32/0 for sword, 15/31/5 for dagger. Sword will perfom better in raids even as a non-human rogue, especially early on.
---
That's a conversation about volume and intensity, Blizzard throughout  WoW's history felt compelled to have ~80 ish German only servers, with less populous nations taking over a few servers, the Czech's for example, had taken over 2 servers for the longest time.
---
Nobody is arguing or pretending everything will be perfect, but Blizzard thinks the incoming Frenchies and Germans will be a light shower, instead of the Tsunami they are.
---
Servers capped at 2500players like the game was designed to be.
---
Shockingly hard solution.
---
This is so damn easy to fix. Just force every alt onto the Layer the main logged off on. There's no reason to suspect it will be like this on launch day.
---

You learn by doing. If they aren't willing to even try English, then any online game that isn't translated to their language is simply out of bounds. I most definitely liked the game and the community a lot even though in the beginning I wasn't fluent in English by any means.
---
I am a fan of mouseover counterspell and polymorph.  Others prefer to switch their targets.  
---
Having stopcasting in the start of a counterspell macro for either use helps you to drop your current spell to get off that critical counterspell.  
---
It's been so many years, but I don't recall ice block being toggleable, so you probably want a cancelaura macro to remove that.  
---
Dismount macro built into things like frost nova, blink, POM+Pyro, etc. since the game doesn't auto-dismount (or it didn't until TBC).  Also, that POM+Pyro macro that uses all your trinkets and anything that boosts your damage and doesn't inflict a global cooldown.
---
As a warrior noob on the stress test I actually thought it wasn’t nearly as bad as people make it out to be. Just have to be careful but it’s worth it. Think I’ll be maining Warrior now.
---
Well prep daggers is bad for raiding as well so it's not like going daggers solves that problem. Hemo isn't terrible for raiding, i'd guess it's about 10-15% hit from combat dps. It's probably better dps than sub dagger pvp build.
---
Every foreign clients on the same server. What can go wrong?
---
Remember Tips, Asmon, and Esfand defended layering and still do to this day. They need to use their voices to tell Blizzard that we don’t want layering.
---
Haha whoops.  Thought this was a reply to my original comment &gt;,&lt;
---
Chai-poo
---
They likely just hope it makes money so they don't get laid off.
---
How do you know they are in a different layer? We're they standing right there with you? If so why would anyone invite you so YOU could have the chest and not take it for themselves. Your logic is so flawed. How does this translate to the production client at all.

We certainly peaked during that era.

Lol it was already open to everyone

A lock would get Soul Link with whatever demon he has out, Fel Domination to summon a different one almost instantly, infinite mana with Dark Pact + summoning another demon when its oom. Going against a melee? Get your blueberry out for a 4k shield, soul link, AND 10% physical dmg reduction.
---
Oh and they get Conflagerate AND multiple % boosts to damage. Warlock spec is all about choosing between Shadow Mastery (10% shadow dmg) Master Demonologist (10% all dmg w/ succ) and Emberstorm/Ruin in destro (10% fire dmg, 100% critical dmg). No other class gets as many damage buffs along with insane survivability. Because of the stacking shadow dmg buff, Drain Life would probably tick for 300, be close to immune from pushback, and give the lock 300-400HPS with Siphon Life.
---
Oh and he's got instant shadowbolts, Conflagerate which is a more powerful instant than a mage's Fire Blast, Shadowburn which is even more powerful than Conflag on a longer CD...
---
Warlock.
---
I believe it

&gt; You play other games on english speaking servers, why not WoW Classic, the Greatest MMO there is and have a new, authentic experience?
---
I already played on english privat servers. Does not feel right for me
---
First thing youbhave tondon- be there at the launch, second thing log in, third pull away from everyone. Yeah good luck
---
All those layers will have a population on them that is competing for resources. Because of this, high value resources are going to be time gated. Layer jump gets you more opportunities than someone that doesn't, but it's still bound by time.
---
Compared to doing other organized, non time gated things will likely produce a similar amount of gold.
---
TL;DR it's a slight advantage that will be meaningless in the long run
---
Just FYI the statement IT WAS NEVER LIKE THAT wasn’t preceded by any qualifying statement showing it was your own anecdotal evidence, in case you happened to miss it.
---
Layering is the best. It just needs simple ruleset fixes so it can't be abused. There's absolutely no reason to suspect these fixes won't be in by launch day.
---
Did you make sure to clean up the other layers as well, though?
---
its the reddit way, the love something and make a reddit about it, they hate the thing they once loved, then they start to hate each other and reddits dedicated to the same thing, then the mods are caught trying to bang underage redditors....The reddit cycle
---
Not really. It was open to people with a sub. There would likely be 3x as many people testing if they didnt require a sub.
---

---
&gt; How would you
---
Knew it, didn't even have to read any further. You are *exactly* the kind of person I was talking about. You don't care about the suggestion whatsoever, you just want to find something to argue about.
---
Scaling up is even easier than scaling down, it's akin to adding new servers versus merging servers. But you already knew that, you just needed something to complain about.
---
And again I ask, how do you know anyone is on a different layer? You would all have to be in the same spot.
---
You the real MVP in my book. I agree tanking is really rewarding .
---
Well German ain't really hard to understand - but it's harder to to master. Provided you speak good English and know a bit of Latin. There are patterns you spot quickly. 
---
Getting the hang of when to use what and which exceptions apply is another story.
---
Because moving your tongue to shape english language is not at all difficult? Because in this context, they will be on english speaking realms?
---
&gt; Why should anyone be forced to speak english?
---
Honestly, I don't even know what to do with that. "Why should I be using the language I know when talking to people speaking that language?"

Have ravencrest 1 and ravencrest 2. Merge the servers together after phase one, there is no need for this "layering" where people are able to hop layer on demand it ruins a lot of things for classic wow such as economy and wpvp.

Damn son. You didn’t need to kill him.

You choose your server, then layer upon character creation. That character stays on that layer until the collapse. Same concept only you choose and never phase in and out of layers.

Thanks for the advice.  If it's only gonna be in the game for a few weeks I don't really see how we need any solution really.  How much could the balance of the entire economy be fucked up in only a few weeks.  When you consider the lifetime of the game.

&gt; If you were seeing other characters drop in and out of your view while you were playing during the stress test, we were manually doing things to make it more stressful and test as much as possible.
---
To be honest I never even noticed it was a french thing. But still. Feels natural to me. For ? and ! and ... at least. For some reason dots and comas are attached though.
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE!!
---
meanwhile all the people posting here are in the starting area going WHAAA WHAAA I can't get a mob WHAAAAAA
---
As far as we know, sharding isn't going to happen.  Layering will take place between launch and the end of P1.
---
I played vanilla and BC wow back in the day, and plan on returning for classic. Trying to get info from this sub from comments like yours: what’s Phase 2 (and implied subsequent phases?) 
---
I plan on playing priest because it’s the only class I never played in vanilla. Is it hard to gear/level for them, hence your inclination to help? Or do you just like the class and want to “help the homies” just because you’re a fan of the class too. 
---
Starting at 11, you'd at most be level 14 by the time you get to the Dagger Hills. Good luck killing those level 17-18 Highway Man if you're not anything but a hunter. Old-Murk Eye is level 20 - Elune be with you, you'll need her.
---
It was ridiculous how many hunters were on the stress test.
---
lmfao
---
I mean, I assume you're only going blacksmith for fear immunity, which means you won't need more ore.  Engineering once you hit 300 will still tax you on ore, but not a significant amount.  I would say if you're going to create an alternate with the expectation of hitting 60, I think herbalism and alchemy might be better.  Then you can fully stock yourself with potions and the combination of your potion and herb sales, plus the savings of not paying for potions will be more than enough to afford all the engineering mats you need for continued grenades, sapper charges, etc.
---
That said, I don't know if it's worth creating a second mage.  Pick another class you might have fun with.
---
With the way you worded your title, I was thinking that he actively sought out an invite to change layers just to avoid being ganked.
---
Definitely not what happened, but okay OP, fuck streamers.
---
Did you know that layering is actually just virtual servers that share the same player DB?  Now you do, and your solution to layering is: layering.
---
I don't see the issue in speaking English when it comes to general chat / random groups, and french in french-centric communities like guilds and friend groups. If you CAN speak english, why be so stubborn to not do it? To prove some unimportant point? Like you said it's just a game. Why go out of your way to annoy others

Layering and Sharding are almost the same thing. But a lot of people are missing the key difference between the two.
---
Sharding is the process of consolidating the different Virtual Machines that makeup say Desolace - Rather than 200 different instances of Desolace that have at max 2 people in them, all of the instances of Desolace are combined into a Shard of let's say, 20 people. Sharding's entire purpose is to reduce the server load by having less VMs running in dead areas of the game.
---
Layering is the process of taking the entire world and applying new layers to it. So instead of having a single World VM with 10 000 people, layers are created to split that 10k up into smaller population pools of let's say 2000 people. The entire purpose of Layering is to reduce world load, so people can actually kill monsters and complete quests.
---
Point being they function very similar to each other but work from opposite sides of the problem.
---
&gt;Because in this context, they will be on english speaking realms?
---
Who says EU realms are "english speaking realms"?
---
&gt; "Why should I be using the language I know when talking to people speaking that language?"
---
Who says they want to communicate with the people that can't understand them?
---
AI fixes are notoriously difficult to implement.
---
So is Alliance going to be 90% humans when classic comes out? Looks like it.
---
Back in the days you knew the players on the other faction by name. Since you saw the same characters often, you also know who to kill on sight and who you could leave alone because he would never attack you.
---
Layering will destroy that aspect of the game. It will also harm the economy of the server and make the game easier. During Vanilla one guy won the STV Fishing Competition, now 7 people will win it every time.
---
Layering is not solving any problems. It’s a game changer.
---
This is what layering is. The only difference is that you can hop between layers so that people can better play with friends and future guildmates. If you remove that difference, it will be pretty shitty.
---
For example, I am playing on launch, hour 0 minute 1. My friends wont be able to start until 4+ hours after me (depending on work and traffic). They will very likely end up on a different layer from me. If they werent able to hop to my layer or vice versa. It would be completely shit

---
Champion! haha I will add it to the report, and hopefully at the least it can be investigated.
---
Yeah since pvp and pve builds are two different things,you always want to play combat in a raid setting. Hemo might be better than sub dagger but there is no serious raid guild who will allow the rogues to spec hemo or anything other than combat for pve.
---
They have to stop this. This isn't a good experience by any means. Fuck layering.
---
If you have shift+1 rebound (through the keybindings menu) to one of the extra hotbars, I believe that rebind takes priority over a macro. If you haven't rebound it, say a default client, then shift+1 will change what the macro does. But you always have to be holding shift before you press 1.
---
With enchants and talents, and with felhunter our, I will have an average of 131 to all resistances and about 4.9k HP unbuffed. So with SL, my lock will be very hard to kill  
---
I chose not to include anything past the first Boss in AQ or anything from Naxx, just to stay realistic. If we take away the weapon, all of this stuff is attainable in BWL and earlier. So I can look forward to building it relatively quickly!
---
OK.. i agree
---
That one does look really good!  I def need to step up my visual game
---
It will NOT. I was in the stress-test that had multiple layers and I knew people by name, even if they were on a different server. It will be different but it will not outright ruin this aspect.

Thank you very much!

You linked to the wrong post, mate.
---
Anti layering coalition WHEN
---
shut up!
---
Wow layering is just wrong.
---
Was great for priests even in pvp, the oh shit i meed heals fast button
---
The logical conclusion you should have come to was that because 99.99% of players didn't use them back then, 99.99% of players won't use them now, so they should be left in for anyone who does choose to use them.
---
Just because some private server idiots who didn't actually play Vanilla think they're "required" doesn't mean Blizzard should remove them from raids. And if some speed clearing leaderboards come up in 3 years when people are getting bored with the game, the world buffs will be there to make their races a little more interesting. And nothing will force you personally to join one of those guilds if you don't want to.
---
That's actually pretty cool! Glad you had a better experience then me. Guess it just wasn't my cup of tea. 
---
And heck yes I believe its definitely worth it when you get that high tier loot and wreck shop.
---
farming that karma like a boss
---
Oh look, this same solution posted for the 1000th time...
---
Locked layers that you choose upon realm selection is a better solution. You don't have to deal with collisions like duplicate names, duplicate guilds, etc. Either way, neither of those is needed as all these layer issues are massively overblown.
---
I ran into 2 people and made fast friends.. this community in this game is unlike anything else, I stayed to help one kid with a quest when TONS of people rolled in.. he kept saying over and over i could go but i told him i was happy to help. after 40 mins we finally finished his quest and he added me to his bnet and is going to roll with my friends and myself.. I love this damn game!

Wonder if the janitors are going to lock this thread for not being a "Battle-station" post.

we need layering on reddit

I feel you need to read usernames.
---
And my friends say they don’t go alliance cuz that’s where all the kids are.
---
Im asking for your solution because I dont believe there is a better way, and so I would like to see if you surprise me with something great that nobody has thought of.
---
What you just linked me is discussing server merging, which has some serious issues that I feel to be far less healthy than the damages Layering has. Further in the thread they talk about have the servers be pre-planned as to where they are going to merge. Isnt that just a different version of layering at that point? Or very similar to it anyways... And still there would be the real big issues that come with servers merges, namely: guilds, guild names, player names, auction house economies, community structure, as well as others.
---
JUST DOING NOTHING IS THE LESSER OF THE TWO EVILS IDIOT
---
SOME OF US WANT 100,000+ AT SPAWN!!
---
Wahey, at least you read the usernames!
---
I bloody hate to repeat myself, **they merged the communities when they were already established**.
---
And your second point being, that Blizzard was so traumatized by server mergers... that they won't merge servers that are so dead they need to invent new technologies to fix? That's what you think is the reason?
---
A month would be more than enough for Blizzard that keeps track to decide if realm is dying and when vast majority of people have not reached level cap yet, and merge them, and a month old community is malleable enough to recover from this nebulous,  vague damage you think is direct cause of mergers.
---
&gt;Energy watch and swing/shot timers are you examples of extremely advanced mechanics?
---
They're good to have addons for monitoring, yeah
---
wtf r u talking about?   This isn't news to blizzard.  It's not a bug, and they're usually not doing it for selfless reasons either.
---
How is this even controversial? Mage is a class that doesn't have any mechanics that need addons for QoL. It's a mechanically primitive class. All the mage mechanics are very simple and straight-forward and the basic UI pretty much does what you need. The other classes need things like totem timers, attack timers, feral mana bar, etc. Mage is a mechanically simple class, that's just the way the game works. The guy asked about addons for mage. I explained that mage doesn't have mechanics that require addons.
---
Druid was my original class I leveled in Vanilla. Leveling wise Druid is easy and fast. End game well your jack of all trades master of none. But my favorite thing is flag running. So I'm good. I know what I'm getting into with Druid
---
Doesn't matter. He already said he will be on a PvE server. Will never been an issue.
---
DYNAMIC RESPAWNS
---
It really was a fun hour. One that convinced me to play vanilla when it launches. Such a different experience from retail.
---
Then the priest that asked you for food remembers you and says: 1st heal for free , all next ones are 1g each,  resurect 5g :D
---
If you duo or group level it's not as bad.
---
Warrior and Hunter have some of the worst level 1-10 for example, but my buddy and I are duoing (and then linking up with our priest and mage or warlock) to head into the barrens. It makes it so much easier on both since the warrior is basically your pet :P
---
I'm pretty sure that they have weighed the pros and cons of layering, and look what they picked! It's almost as if they know that more people will play longer if they aren't waiting for hours just to get out of the starting zones because there are 500 other people running around trying to kill the same mobs as them.
---
It has only been the first year. They will get it next year.
---
Lol, depends on how you define "a bit". ;-) There are a hellalot students from Wester Switzerland who can't speak a word English..

Mobs have melee leeway on the beta, tested extensively.

You’re looking at the lens of streamers who will naturally cap their layers making it easier for them to switch. This is not going to be an issue for the average joe playing the game.

But scaling up would result in **either** cutting off people from each other or creating fresh servers, which people would need to start **from scratch on**. 
---
Is this 4D chess to ignore criticism or what are ya tryin' to do ?
---
Most of my druid macros are like the one posted. Obviously you have to cut them down dramatically. I posted that macro in the OP trimmed to 253 characters somewhere here.
---
Each form has a separate, similar macro. If you use that one as a framework, I have Wrath/Healing Touch(+Pounce/Claw on cat, Maul on bear) on 1 across all my forms. I have Moonfire/Rejuvenation on 2, Regrowth/Entangling roots on 3, etc..
---
I could share them in detail if there's enough interest.
---
How the heck did you do Dire Maul at level 16?
---
Lol at no enhance shaman bis preraid
---
So EU realms do not necessarily mean English realms, fair. So what do you want instead? A free for all where there's 200 people per language per realm?
---
&gt;Who says they want to communicate with the people that can't understand them?
---
How "they" cannot communicate using english with people that speak english? Please explain.
---
It's not just about your small group of friends what about everyone else you meet in the world like that rogue that ganked you in ashenvale? One day he was on the same layer as you but the next day you log in you dont see any of the people you were leveling around or the rogue that ganked you because they are now on a different layer. That completely destroys the realm identity and community aspect of the game.
---
Hopping layers also makes it so people can exploit herbing and mining to get out of wpvp situations they dont want to be in.
---
If you want to add me on discord, I am def going to be playing classic heavily but I will be playing PvE server.
---
It depends on available content and profs. Early on, hunter can farm mara even with shit gear. Once DM is available, mage aoe farm (with herb) is likely better, by a small margin. It remains to be seen if hunters will be able to solo farm DM:T
---
Personally, I'd rather farm devilsaur leather than arcane crystals
---
&gt; If they aren't willing to even try English, then any online game that isn't translated to their language is simply out of bounds.
---
No game is as dependent on communication as WoW is, from both a practical aspect and community aspect. You don't need to speak english to play Overwatch or Rocket League.
---
And what about the few games that do require english to be spoken? Well there's less people that don't understand english that play and they have a lesser experience than others simply from not being able to socialize in any deep way.
---
&gt; I most definitely liked the game and the community a lot even though in the beginning I wasn't fluent in English by any means.
---
That's great for you, now how about having a thought for other people?
---
It boggles my mind how anyone can be against giving players more options and greater accessibility to the game.
---
This is a really high profile edge case. The purpose of layering is to avoid the boar massacre that happens when thousands of orcs who come of age, attempt to prove their worth to the horde in Durotar. Not for when peons get sad and want to hide from their taskmasters. 
---
I had this discussion with a few friends of mine during the stress test and they were like, "well that was the classic experience" (speaking to the level/population density of starting zones). No it is not the "classic" experience, it is every launch day experience of every mmo. My personal vanilla wow experience was not me fighting for boars, I joined a few months late and I missed the first wave of players. It was much more fun than waiting for re-spawns which I was doing earlier this week.
---
Welcome to the sub. Hope you enjoy your stay.
---
I think the proposal is that Blizzard intervenes to make exploiting layering impossible\*, not that we report people who do it.
---
Fastest way to get to sw is to roll human - a lot were lvl 1 chars
---
Filthy casual
---
We removed it for the mod applications sticky, however the bug thread was no longer being used.
---
I grouped with a party similar to what your describing at one point during the stress test. LOL!  2nd Pet! That's exactly how I felt!
---
So if they come up with a ruleset for Layering that doesn't allow you to so easily choose the Layer you end up on, you'll be good to go.
---
Its was a 48 hour stress test most people aren't going to roll there preferred race/class for a toon that's going to be deleted that quick
---
Classic =! Vanilla.  This is Classic what you want is Vanilla and that ship sailed 13 years ago.
---
That isnt how layers work. Do you even know what you are talking about? When you are on a layer you are stickied to that layer, the only time you leave is if you join a guild on another layer or get invited to another layer. The former is a permanent change, the later is a temporary one. YOu will not log in one day and see a whole layer of new players. You clearly know very little about what you speak and need to research some more.
---
is xxRamsayBoltonxx a rogue or a hunter name?
---
Arms still, you can tank as well if not better than prot before 60
---
BFD is great until you're an hour in and realize you're only halfway through it.
---
Definitely a must if you're an Alliance caster though because of the sweet Wand quest reward.

---
I'm a network engineer.  The thing people are calling 'leeway' for mobs is entirely different than the 'leeway' mechanic used for client targeting.
---
limit servers to 8k and disable layering after level 20-30
---
Rather than release every one of Vanilla's patches sequentially, Blizzard is batching major content into phases. [It was originally planned to be four, but we're now at a schedule with six individual phases.](https://www.wowhead.com/news=290629/staggered-classic-content-update-six-phases-up-from-four-to-address-itemization-) Dire Maul is being added in Phase 2, so Felcloth Gloves won't be available until its release (though the rest of the set will be).
---
Shadow Priests &amp; Warlocks aren't terribly difficult to gear, I just want to help out people who didn't play Vanilla or haven't played on private servers to refresh their memory. With things like + hit chance or spell power specific to Shadow or other schools being long, long gone from retail, it's going to be a weird transition for a lot of people. And after having played a Warlock to 60 in Vanilla and then probably a half dozen times on various private servers, I'll get way more out of helping people than doing it all for myself again.
---
Realms for every language lol. English realms, german realms, rench realms,...
---
&gt;How "they" cannot communicate using english with people that speak english?
---
I don't even know what you are trying to say.
---
Anyways, if someone is writing french in the chat then he wants to communicate with other french people.
---
Well Bobby B is more of a PvP player and in there his human +5 sword skill doesn't really matter.
---
And of course he is currently in an arms pvp spec, so Sulfuras is really good there. And this pic is obviously from Phase 1 or 2.
---
I'm glad people are starting to realize the negative effects of layering. If you posted about this kind of thing 1-2 weeks back everyone would downvote you into oblivion. Layering is not a good solution.
---
HE COULD HAVE LINGERED ON THE EDGE OF THE BATTLE WITH THE SMART BOYS, AND TODAY HIS WIFE WOULD BE MAKING HIM MISERABLE, HIS SONS WOULD BE INGRATES, AND HE WOULD BE WAKING THREE TIMES IN THE NIGHT TO PISS INTO A BOWL!
---
Did anyone really expect anything different from blizzard? Blizzard will manage to find a way to ruin classic
---
They are expecting allot of tourist the first few weeks, which is why they are saying that. I feel like they are wrong, but they're the experts.
---
Jokes on you man...jokes on you...
---
Pepperidge farm remembers
---
I'm sure there's an xXGarroshXx somewhere.
---
Shame we couldn't get Baron all the way to Thrall.
---
I don't really see an issue with people hanging around people they can understand and communicate with. I don't speak German, so why would I hang around german players and guilds if I can't speak to them?
---
I hope you realize that there are 10 times as many German speakers than swedish speakers...
---
with unhoppable layers you're pick your own layer on account creation.  
---
if you and your friends can't coordinate to pick the same layer, you probably didn't coordinate to pick the same realm either, guess we'll just add xrealms so you can play together
---
It's always been like this. People aren't being cynical, they're calling out bugs and things they wish to see changed/handled differently. 
---
As for the doomsday tone, it isn't specific to this subreddit. I work in software development and basically every bug report sounds like the world is ending as a result of the issue.
---
You can also use those runestones that drop your HP and give you some mana back.  Which again is useful for raids but not so much in PvP.  But, it's also pretty nice for solo farming stuff if you're fairly confident you won't get ganked while you've purposefully dropped your HP.   Also, trolls look way cooler.
---
Looks good :D, last 2 times i remeber seeing this meny in retail was in my garrison day 1 of wod, and first day we had oondesta in pandaria.
---
Rather be edgy than play with weebs
---
Quest rewards for killing the special miners?
---
I mean, if the playerbase is big enough, there's room for more than one R14 per week. Per faction. It could very well be that the major servers have four new R14s per week starting three months into phase 2.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zp0hZxG0oZVxfoeq0o
---
Or, just lag on the player's end.
---
Yeah he's full of it OR he's a druid trying to push u away. Druids in PvP are solid as fuck, and are at least top 3 when played correctly and form swapping to max potential. The damage is good, swap to bear for a heal and survivability, travel form to get a gap to pop out and heal, etc. The class is stellar in PvP. Pve not so much.
---
Lol. You're an ass and I love it
---
Do you know what the "-dev" command does? I've only heard of the "-console" command.
---
I sure hope it’s a pvp server because I’m playing on a pve and I want to stay far away from  that shit
---
I’m definitely server transferring (is that’s a thing)
---
Same
---
&gt; That's great for you, now how about having a thought for other people?
---
Obviously I can't possibly know how other people feel, ans I'm just using my experience as an example that you don't need to be fluent in English to have a great time.
---
&gt; It boggles my mind how anyone can be against giving players more options and greater accessibility to the game.
---
I'm unsure who you're referring to as I've already told you that's not what I'm saying. But our views on the subject differ too much for it to be reasonable to continue.
---
Your response amounts to nothing more than "nah uh you're wrong". It's a good system and needs to stay.
---
There won't be any character transfers from retail to classic.
---
&gt;it's the people who for some fucked up reason won't talk english even if they know it.
---
&gt;Why should anyone be forced to speak english?
---
You asked me this, and then you come at me with
---
&gt;I don't even know what you are trying to say.
---
Excuse me, but are you German? As far as I'm aware this is not octoberfest, and you'd do me some courtesy of remembering your own arguments.
---
&gt;Realms for every language lol. English realms, german realms, rench realms,..
---
Which is exactly what I advocated to begin with.
---
Why wouldn't they be able to do Tribute?
---
Zero completion for the AGM. Totally realistic on live severs. Nice fear mongering.
---
My guess is most decent guilds will easily clear all the content and not care for mega buff/class stacking log competition. In that situation why an earth would you be kicking people that are doing 10% less dps? At most you might be expected to raid spec for the first 2 weeks while you get content on farm, but for the next 2-3 months waiting for another phase to unlock? I very much doubt it. Your rogues/mages/warlocks coming pvp spec instead of raid spec won't matter one bit.
---
But waiting for you will be the English version of those people ;-)
---
No, they aren't. They are saying there is really no other solution that doesn't come with any other drawbacks. I don't care about which one they choose, I'm indifferent to it but it's tiring seeing the "layering sucks in every form and blizzard wants to fuck us over"-jargong  everywhere. Get a grip, please
---
Stress test is over, sadly
---
Yeah I know just reflecting my excitement that is all.
---
stop whining
---
Pm me too please
---
Your guildies were idiots. If you're being ganked for 30 minutes straight, call for some backup, switch to another character, or just stop playing for 10 minutes and wait for them to get bored and leave.
---
For me. When I tanked as Druid in  WOW Wrath of the Lich King. Its was a little bit of  a balance.
---
Yes on one hand you feel the entire weight of the raid on your shoulders. (even though that's not logically true) And I got anxious about it. 
---
But that anxiety also fuels you to play better and when you do take down a raid boss. You feel the reward of filling that one role and being the big bad tank of the group.
---
Its that adrenaline rush feeling, and I did really enjoy it.
---
They did this, they just didn't tell you which servers had more layering and which had little layering, and which had none.
---
Mage. The end.
---
How dense are you? I put point for point why I disagree with what you’re saying. You just strip it down to “nah uh you’re wrong.” 
---
Maybe if you actually comprehended supporting details, you would realize I said the system is good for some areas, but needs work in others.
---
And if you REALLY want to have fun, accidentally jump into the other side with your ghost.
---
And there you have my wife's first GM ticket back when we first started playing.
---
Well yeah, if you have a solid group you trust, dungeons are totally worth doing.  If you're just straight pugging, it can be a bad time and really screw your efficiency, or it could be great, no way to know until you're balls deep.
---
Gotcha, didn't know that was worth 1200. My priest has one.
---
Congrats. You just explained layering lol
---
Your tone and post comments belie your claim to have been old enough to play back then.
---
So which one had none?
---
You're right, I apologize for being so rash
---
\&gt;hardcore leveling  
---
\&gt;4-6 weeks
---
pick one.
---
Thank you very much! How does spell hit and damage effect S Priests only, if I understood that correctly
---
Well it functions exactly the same, if you backpeddle it goes away. If you jump or run, they can hit you.
---
He was head of raid design team and became Game Director in Legion. Last time I checked, Nostalrius was shut down during WoD.
---
How is Ion responsible for failure of the game which caused players to ask for Classic when he wasn´t responsible for the game during that?
---
Thank you.  I didn't realize it ended during the middle of the day.  I figured it would end June 21 at like midnight.
---
The only reason people wouldn't be hitting R14 in phase 2 is if the phase is shorter than the minimum time required to reach 14. As long as everyone else is also limited to WPvP, it'll take proportionally the same effort and could even be easier if the difference in gains between organized and casual PvP is bigger with WPvP than it is with BGs. As long as you gain the most honor, you get max rank progress regardless of *where* you got that honor.
---
Yea but the gankers just hopped layers to kill him again
---
haha
---
Weird, almost like people want no layering.
---
I was agreeing with him and I dont think he was being disingenuine. I think hes right a lot of people seem to think druids are weak because they dont know how to fit them in their niche meta roles that they have created and assume everyone plays. I mained a druid all through wotlk and felt very strong despite being slightly undergeared.
---
Druids are extremely strong at what they do if you can handle it and do it well. The problem is that what they do doesnt fit well into pve meta and sometimes organized pvp meta. They are an amazing support class that functions differently than a paladin or priest. Instead of surviving because you have bubbles or the best heals. You survive by mixing tankiness while in bear form with hots from druid form and kiting your enemies. That might be too much for the average player to handle
---
Yeah I asked you why anyone should be forced to speak english and you said
---
&gt;Honestly, I don't even know what to do with that
---
So you'd do me some courtesy of remembering your own arguments.
---
&gt;Which is exactly what I advocated to begin with.
---
Yeah me too
---
The problem with what you say is
---
&gt; it's the people who for some fucked up reason won't talk english even if they know it.
---
What is the problem with people not wanting to speak english?
---
Better title imo
---
We've discussed the downvoting a lot, and it's a really tricky thing to deal with. We've already started hiding voting scores for a grace period of around 2 hours, which helped break the hivemind mentality of 'downvoted man bad downvote them'. 
---
We *could* hide the downvote arrow on the custom stylesheet, but that does nothing for people who vote using RES shortcuts, disable the custom stylesheet, use New Reddit, or browse from a Mobile app. Which is likely a majority of users. If we could disable the downvote, that'd be a whole other discussion. 
---
All we can really do is try and foster a sense of positivity towards discussion, and be quick to ban people who treat differing opinions with rudeness and disrespect. Which we're doing, but we obviously need the community's help with that in the form of reports to keep on top of it. We used to peruse threads and try to keep on top of things like that, but there's just too much to engage in proactive moderation nowadays, we can only react to reports and peruse super-active threads.
---
I checked the eBay price today was sitting at around $1200 it is a rare costume very few have it! Absolutely love it one of my favorite items in WoW easily.
---
Oh okay. I wasn't aware that there is a limit for the amount of sticky posts. The bug thread was a good way to access the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HmeFqag7dzkvibcbvcenWtY3XJLihmvmPNtlnqqsEEo/edit#gid=0) for beta bugs though.
---
Good place to start, Logitech G Pro, Steel Series Apex 7, Fnatic ministreak, GMMK, CTRL etc
---
They should allow you to choose the layer, because otherwise you can't play with your friend.
---
However, you should not be able to change your layer.
---
You completely miss the point of what Classic is.
---
it was beeing used and the beta still exists
---
You counter warriors, mages and rogues (the 3 most played classes) so yeah you can easily moonfire/insect swarm them to death. And the guy above is right, if you have no interest in tanking swiftmend is overall abit better than HOTW
---
Thats the thing. If you cant tell they are doing their job well
---
Ok where did you get the info that they did it ?
---
For hiring female NE's to dance outside the AH in Ironforge. 
---
I got a rep for that back in Vanilla but in OG with female Orc's.
---
Players would start to randomly open trade window and drop silver and gold in my pocket. Of course I happily accepted the donations :).
---
No not really
---
Må nok være 1.5 L flaske
---
Bigotry has never been allowed. We remove plenty of threads that are clearly going to lead to Rule 2 being broken over and over again, especially in regards to discriminatory behaviour. 
---
What we don't typically do is lock threads and leave them unremoved, however I expect Dylo did that wanting to leave the resource in the OP accessible.
---
Auto loot is in the game...
---
You can play with your friend, just make rules about who gets layered and who doesn’t so it can’t be easily abused.
---
No I don't.
---
woah
---
Yeah, let's complain instead about the last stupid thing a streamer has done and why they are ruining Classic WoW (beta), or some other bullshit. Nah, I think this is importat enough to be whinning. Sorry to bother you.
---
This concerns me a bit. If the standard at blizzard is to use containerizing then perhaps the solution to most of these layering issues are going to be something that they do not want to do(because it is going back to old technology and problems): go back to regular VM servers. So say they don't do this; what else is the solution? This is a very difficult problem for blizzard, but hopefully their developers will come through
---
&gt;bang the occasional chubster I meet in WoW
---
Goddamn look at this chad over here banging people.
---
&gt;You don't think there's going to be abusable ways for people to make gold even without layering? See the devilsaur mafia on private servers.. it literally doesn't matter. The top 1% of players will always find a way to abuse shit it's the circle of life
---
Are you being purposely dense or are you just stupid?  
---
People will be no lifing to 60 and then farming end game resources. Layering will absolutely fuck with the balancing and the economy of the end game if a solution is not implemented.
---
Not how any of that works
---
 Not long term.
---
I'm not saying I like layering. I'm saying most of the people here are really just bandwagon doomsaying
---
Blizzard has said layers are include the whole continent so if there's 7 layers in STV there's 7 layers in the whole eastern kingdoms.
---
You forgot to include [this](https://media.giphy.com/media/l396InTOf9zsp2EO4/giphy.gif).
---
I'm thinking of the same :)
---
I suppose in a sense I do, but it gets channeled into superhuman efforts to do everything I can. It does occasionally lead me to die because I should have let a DPS die to his own stupidity, but taunted off him anyways
---
Where does the number 14 come from in the formula? Is it just a constant or why is the AP divided by that number?
---
At the same time I understand you and at the same time I feel sorry for you. Atleast we have Rammstein :)
---
Lol 1 server without any layers, you wouldn't see anyone.
---
Because you wouldn't be in the game.
---
You guys have valid complaints but some people don't know how to constructively voice said opinion.
---
right now layering will be active for 2-4 months all the way to 60
---
Isn't that literally what their plan is?  Layering just exists to reduce load and make a smoother experience until the initial hype dies down and they can be more stable... then it'll go back to the way it used to be?  This was in a Q&amp;A with Ion H and he literally said that.  Why is everyone freaking out... did they change it so that it's permanent and I just missed it?
---
Thanks for the reply. I assume apart from removing the downvote there isnt much you can do at this point. I am hopeful that after launch everything will cooldown and useful discussions will take over. Part of the problem for me is that I can only fill out so many talent trees and research my desired class so much. We dont have much to discuss until launch. Thank you for your work with the sub
---
that’s an uncommonly large screen. How does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large screen?
---
All sounds good then.
---
Just get wand spec, and Divine fury.
---
Smite&gt;SWP&gt;Wand
---
Maybe, just maybe we’ll get something over chat. I’d imagine that it will only be server wide if at all.
---
Wow, it’s almost like you missed the huge text saying “post collapse issues”
---
No, they have never publicly said this.
---
&gt; But as a frenchman, should I remind you that there are way more people natively speaking french than english
---
As a martian, it would be prudent of me to point out that just Great Britain and Republic of Ireland constitute more native english speakers than France does french native speakers. I should mention places like United States, Canada with little knob of french bits, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and probably a few more I forgot.
---
People will find out on day 1 what server he’s playing on.
---
not going to click that link and watch some shit stream.
---
write down what you want us to know you blody shill
---

---
No, and it's not gonna be hyped at all. The only people who care are the mega no lifers that are poopsocking the first week.
---
This country is going down hill...
---
Would'nt the official forums be where the complaining should go? Seems your only crying to others that are part of the Fanbase here and not the people who would try and fix the issues.
---
This is NOT what they advertised layers as and is essentially renamed sharding. What happened to 3000 person layers that were very difficult to swap between?
---
This is demonstrably not what happens though. English will be the primary language at first, until a server is picked to be the unofficial server of X language. They were few and far between yes, because many people of that language congregated there, and how awful it was if you were unlucky enough to be on that server. They could just solve the problem from the get go by giving them official servers. There is no downside to this.
---
This really isn't a explanation why people think it felt "easier." The number of abilities this effects in the 1-30 range (where the majority of these complaints stemmed) is super small. Basically limited to Sinister Strike, Backstab, Overpower, and Multi-Shot.
---
If it was specifically rogues going "things seem easier" I would get it, but this really only effects one class in a noticable way 
---
Still should be fixed, it is not noticable to the point where all classes are thinking the content is too easy lol.
---
I don’t think it will fail at all. I think people don’t think about the repercussions to cutting layering early
---
They are looking for more mods, I don’t think there are enough to stroll the comment sections as fast as it’s happening, so to ensure the “safety” of the sub they have to deal with it ASAP and it’s faster (not necessarily better)to end the discussion.  If not, the overhead admins can end the sub due to toxicity etc. that simply can’t be kept up with.  .... this is a guess but could be the way they have to handle it with current staff.
---
PORTUGAL CARALHOOOOO
---
I knew a guy on a unofficial server that made such advanced macros that he got paid in tens of thousand gold and eventually AQ40 gear. His main was a human warrior, would love to get in touch again but don't recall your in-game name 
---
(Old feenix. Got gear from maybe Final Exit)
---
Get a shaman to give water walking and it's pretty reachable!
---
I'd love the hear the reason these isle exist, however.
---
YOU SHALL NOT PASS!
---
This is based off the assumption that layers will be capped at the old realm cap used back in vanilla. Mark Kern talked about the ideal population they wanted was \~1000 per realm, so its likely the layers will be set to somewhere between those values.
---
While I can't personally speak to anything besides Dutch, beyond my international friends/colleagues who never seem to have had any difficulty (but perhaps they're outliers), it's fairly uncommon for a Dutch gamer to be unable to navigate their way through the English language. There's massive education and media differences involved here, whereas in (most) of the countries you listed English is a basic/mandatory course you take for multiple years as a kid and are required to exercise verbally and in writing through your whole study career. Television and other forms of media aren't dubbed, either, that's often not the case for the other big countries.
---
But lets add some statistics to this, Europe (specifically members of the EU-28) has a population of [408,879,069. Out of that 51% speak English. 26% speak French. 32% speak German and 15% speak Spanish.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_European_Union)
---
The languages you mentioned? 3% speak Swedish, 1% speak Danish, 1% speak Finnish and 5% speak Dutch. You could also look at the [knowledge of English map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_European_Union#/media/File:Knowledge_of_English_EU_map.svg) to see that these countries are obviously less impacted by this.
---
Some of us are just different from the rest :)
---
Yeah indeed, In my experience testing routes I've found the best bet is westfall at 11-13, doing goretusk liver, forgotten heirloom, westfall stew, old blanchy, part 1 of people's militia, red bandanas.  
---
Then scoot across to loch modan for their entry quests, complete til you're up to only orange quests, back to westfall at around \~15 to do part 2 of people's militia and start the defias brotherhood questline; taking you to redridge for some of the more basic entry quests.
---
Damn, first comment of yours I kinda agree with. What the hell happened to you?
---
You’d be surprised what some people play with.
---
I played wow on DSL from 2005-2011
---
Never had any issues.
---
I think 10Mbps DSL would be fine honestly. You're not going to be able to stream obviously but I think that's plenty of bandwidth just for the game.
---
Some people hate Sodapoppin so much they might have gone over to the pro layering side just to disagree with him.
---
1) Get rid of layering
---
- or -
---
2) only allow layering in starter zones.
---
3) Only allow layering when the player's level is zero.
---
What's your solution then? You can't shit on people for for an idea and not offer a better solution to the problem. 
---
Blizzard networking architecture is different from vanilla. Everything is about load balancing. It isnt viable to just say "buy more servers" since that isnt how it works anymore. Given their current infrastructure there are 2 choices. 
---
1. No layers, have 1,000+ people queues that are hours long to get into. Once you get in, you're contesting leveling zones with hundreds or thousands of other people. 1-10 no longer takes 3-4 hours, but instead 7-8 hours. All leveling time is at least doubled. 
---
2. Have layers, leveling speed is more or less as normal as launch can be. None or low queues. A few ways to exploit layers to farm and level faster.
---
Which is the right choice? I don't know, but I'd probably side to layers knowing they'll go away before most people hit 60.
---
No why don't you try again. You must have my reply mixed up with another one of your comments since I replied to you blaming batching for the late damage text display.
---
The extra number popping up, after he died already, was a late display, but the damage had already been applied with the initial swing.
---
If you do even a little research about windfury on the classic beta you would know that this has nothing to do with batching and this is even more evident when you see the clip from Venruki's perspective. This display bug happens almost every time windfury procs.
---
Again, the windfury proc damage applied CORRECTLY, meaning in the same batch as it was intended to. The combat text did not show up at the same time the damage was dealt, which is the issue.
---
Whatever other issues you have with batching is fine and I probably agree, but this specific number display that you refer to is unrelated to that.
---
You need a citation to compute the indisputable fact that the maybe combined amount of people on private servers being 25k is nowhere near indicative of people willing to play Vanilla WoW?
---
Yes, there has been confirmation so to speak. Give me a sec, I’ll post links
---
I'm 36 and rolling undead. I guess I'll have to be twice as edgy.
---
Man you have motivated me to ticket a GM to see if I can get my costume back. I must have accidentally deleted it at some point and I miss being a murloc. I’ll be playing and tanking.
---
It was originally done by a band called The Toyes.  Sublime later covered it.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_Two_Joints
---
It's more than enough, I would take DSL over satellite as ping will be considerably lower.
---
Lol imagine being this delusional
---
It's so interesting that layering somehow solves all these mutually exclusive problems in your mind. It's apparently meant to allow us to play on day one, not ruin social immersion, be over in two weeks, but solve the "tourism crisis" that's going to apparently last 4 months.
---
All well I watch videos of abuse on a daily basis at a growing frequency.
---
Yet private servers do it and they're not blizzard (:
---
Yeah def. not going with satellite
---
k and ion \*promised* shadow priests and elemental shamans would get fixed a few weeks into BfA
---
*quickly cleans up computer desk for Reddit picture*
---
Only beta testers can reply in the beta thread, I figured linking the thread in General talking about where people can actually contribute might be good.
---
Not necessarily. You can still have sub 30 people on the same layer. But it is a way to consolidate high level players onto the same layer to prevent layer abuse
---
There simply aren’t going to be enough realms at launch for any RP-PVP contingent to secure a regular PVP realm for themselves. A region like US East might get 1 PVP, 1 PVE, and 1 RP realm at launch and that’s it. Europe is only getting a handful as well.
---
Can you imagine writing being this butthurt over getting called out?
---
I linked the post in General so more people could contribute to it.  The post with the data is in the beta forums that most can't post in.
---
It’s impossible to talk to these guys about sharding and layering because they’re so ignorant as to what the purpose is. 90% of these guys think layering is so they can “actually tag quest mobs”
---
Smoking Heart of the Mountain is a lot of work for that item as a non-druid. Are you planning on keeping Enchanting after that?
---
&gt; And still there would be the real big issues that come with servers merges, namely: guilds, guild names, player names, auction house economies, community structure, as well as others.
---
I think you missed the entire point of the suggestion if you got that impression. The suggestion I proposed completely solves most of this automatically.
---
The only oddities might be the economy and community, but it will be significantly better than their current layering plan where there won't be any sense of community until it's removed. And at least people can anticipate the merge unlike back in vanilla.
---
Oh you're totally right. I see that problem everyday when a q on LFD or LFR and everyone is from a different country. It's a sad thing to see.
---
Correct and correct.
---
Point?
---
Hey it's better than 90% of Australia's internet, count yourself lucky.
---
I already thought it was weird whenever I see someone take a photo of their screen instead of just taking a screenshot, but watching someone film their screen with one hand and attempt to move their character with another is a whole new level.
---
Do you have a link to a video of the event?
---
Makes you feel better though, knowing we cant decipher half the chat, but at least we dont have to read about Trump, Kardashians or a Twitch Streamer in chat. We are still much better off.
---
Do you mean like people escaping ganks thanks to layering, or French people who are just not going to play because blizz fucked eu?
---
Hunters will never be a rarity, never have been in any iteration of the game
---
Truly hilarious being that P2 will be anywhere from 2-4 months out
---
is that true? Why does nerzul push for this outcome then?
---
They might tweet about it; that’s it.
---
What I learned from this is buy cheapnduring layering sell later.
---
a joke version of something is not a parody.  Parody has a very specific definition when it comes to fair use
---
https://copyrightalliance.org/ca_faq_post/parody-considered-fair-use-satire-isnt/
---
&gt; ...the purpose of a parody is to comment on or criticize the work that is the subject of the parody. By definition, a parody is a comedic commentary about a work, that requires an imitation of the work. 
---
The troll joke isn't commenting on or criticizing the original song "Smoke 2 Joints" in any way, therefore it is not a parody when it comes to Fair Use.
---
True, but I think the larger point is how many other calculations like this exist in the game?  If someone could run a similar test with casters, they might find the same results for spells.  We need more testing.
---
Jesus Christ dude. *that is layering*
---
You realize you WERE in a layer last night, and you’ll be fighting WAYYY more than 60 people for mob tags? The sheer amount of ignorance on this sub, with this insane “confidence” to back it up blows my mind
---
Yes it happened in the entrance gateways in Ogrimmar. It is a server boundary line. It could be they stitched the line in a slightly different play in Ironforge.
---
Realm 15 was the best. I had so many great interactions with random people. I can’t wait for Classic!
---
Layering is not a technical term, it's a marketing term. What Blizzard does behind the scenes to implement their server management is unknown to the public, iirc.
---
Who made this
---
*cries in eu*
---
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
---
It isn't magic
---
All I'm saying is I really don't want to be the healer that let's the dps die. Fuck that's going to be toxicity at its purest.
---
 I think the larger point is how many other calculations like this exist in the game? If someone could run a similar test with casters, they might find the same results for spells. We need more testing.
---
I enjoy charging and swinging and side stepping close to the next mob but druids are fun after they hit 20 they really outshine warriors until 60 when warrior finally gets gear the payoff is worth it.
---
That’s plenty of internet to play online video games.
---
I don't have an account. I suppose I could create one, but I strongly dislike linear forums. Reddit is a much better format for discussion.
---
It will ruin Classic because people in *Europe* will encounter someone who speaks another language?  Do you even listen to yourselves?
---
roleplaying very cool stuff
---
How will the RPPvP community know where to roll I wonder.
---
Feels more breath of the wild to me
---
Honestly my phone call was a fun one with the customer support staff. Actually when I told him I wanted to recover a 10+ year old account he got excited! Seems like it may have been one of the more interesting calls of the day. He asked me some questions relevant to the account like what one of my characters name was the level also type of unique gear or things I had in my inventory that I could specifically identify to ensure legitimately prove I was the owner. When I told him my rogue has a murloc costume in the bank or in the main bag his response was, “well that is pretty unique.” Then we proceeded onto account recovery.
---
nope, only you. Never ever heard of this issue before.
---
Right, that’s why I merely said they could be mitigated rather than fixed. People who can’t stand long login queues or other issues have an out; they don’t need to start over or stop playing the game, unlike those on dead servers.
---
&gt; I simply compared the actual numbers to the expected numbers
---
How do you come up with 5% and 7% then when the numbers supplied in the thread says 3%?
---
&gt; I don't care about which one they choose, I'm indifferent to it
---
Perfect, so then you won't care if they remove layering. Seems like the best solution is to just remove it if you're indifferent.
---
well it has +6swords, thats +1more than orc racial
---
pretty straight forward
---

You are right, I don't know for other european country, but a compagny segregating french langage by making illegal in anyway french langage in a product sold in France is illegal. Yeah we can be a bit sensitive about our langage.
---
I just have it fullscreened in my big ass wall mounted tv. It’s like having a wall canvas =p
---
&gt; Which considering since 2005-2013 there were over 100 million accounts made. That's just 2% to compete with today! 
---
TIL 2% of all trial accounts and gold spam bots are going to come back to Classic as regular players.
---
I love how #nochanges, the integrity and atmosphere of the game is just thrown away by a bunch of people who say “i dont want to spend hours in the starting zone”
---
No shit, noone does but if its the price I have to pay to not have this BS, its deserved. I also love how these people tell the #nochanges crowd to “just go play on a pserver” NO - most of us were the ones pushing for Vanilla servers before it was a thought in Blizzards mind. The fact that other people are coming in and saying “I like layering, I like X and Y” is actually infuriating.
---
SMD
---
Most groups would rather take a warrior that can admit when they screw up vs someone that’s not worried about it. Warriors really just have to use tab a lot but I wouldn’t call tanking difficult. Typically you mark a skull and an X maybe a moon if you wanna CC. All dps should be on skull so just charge change stance(can be macroed to one button) then sunder skull tab revenge or sunder x then go back to skull taunt sunder auto attack till dead.
---
&gt; why not just english like the rest of us ?
---
Lets add some statistics to this, Europe (specifically members of the EU-28) has a population of [408,879,069 above 15 (age). Out of that 51% speak English. 26% speak French. 32% speak German and 15% speak Spanish.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_European_Union)
---
You could also look at the [knowledge of English map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_European_Union#/media/File:Knowledge_of_English_EU_map.svg) to see that these countries obviously have a significantly smaller number of English speakers.
---
&gt;only allow layering in starter zones.
---
This is the only place its even needed
---
Streamers have a pool of people to pull from. Certain configurations could prevent this, like having guilds locked to a specific layer. The average player's primary pool for help (their guild) cant abuse the layering system.
---
If randoms guys in underwear can do it and it works, a giant company like blizzard can as well. If layering is a problem for the community and the sole problem could be that servers are going to suck for a few days if it's not used ? who cares.

There are way more than 2 choices.

I dont, I can play.... Im level 60 trying to find a group for LBRS right now

Does Counter Attack do weapon damage, or is it a fixed small amount like wing clip?

I've been seeing people post about an Intimidate and Scatter spec that seems like it gets more value than the survival tree.
---
Pre-raid best in slot gear is largely the same for Warlocks and Shadow Priests. So while my main goal is helping Warlocks with class specific things, I can still help out SPriests by crafting gear for them. Partly to make up for vehemently hating SPriests in Vanilla when I just saw them as stealing my shadow damage gear.
---
The big difference is pservers have a couple benefits that blizzard servers won’t 
---
1. They’re global so there isn’t just one “prime time”. Whereas on blizzard servers you choose your region and time zone. This would result in way more people in an area. 
---
2. Dynamic spawning and respawns. This is something blizzard hasn’t confirmed they’re doing 
---
3. Removal of tedium. There were cooldowns and timers that pservers removes in order for the server to operate at such a huge population. 
---
Btw, I hate layering and I don’t want it in the game either.
---
You guys roll on moonguard
---
Ayyy I’m in this photo!
---
Same! I was running a raid group

The popualrity of Mages is imo extremely overrated. The only outlier in class representation will most likely be the druid

Maybe... Just maybe...

It’s slow you die if you over pull but it’s satisfying to 3 shot a monster with lucky Frits and a big axe.
---
Okay, thank you! My heart was breaking for a moment
---
You need to be not just loud but fucking loud and cynical. They not gonna listen if there is no outrage. Outrage is the only "tool" we have that can actually change something.
---
Sure. And you can have a terrible experience when you have a dead server.
---
this was never funny, stop trying too hard
---
Nice bait m8.

Getting my comment in before this gets removed!
---
TF2 taught me that lesson long, long ago.
---
I like layering, I know you guys hate me but without it the servers would be so full you would never finish a quest. It would be barren, it is pretty bad as it is and finding a group is pretty difficult too.
---
I was playing on the test and tried to group up, nobody accepted, putting calls for group were a waste of time too. I suppose if u have friends you can find groups but for a casual player like me, it’s difficult.
---
In saying that so far I have enjoyed playing in classic, it’s been fun and the extra difficulty is welcome. I wouldn’t at this stage add or take anything away, the game is pretty good as it is.
---
Nope been playing actively since Vanilla. Game just hasn't been this fun in a while
---
&gt; People are overestimating how many from the EU can speak English or even want to speak it in their free time thus social interactions while running dungeons/activities will be servery limited by language barrier
---
That they are. Europe (specifically members of the EU-28) has a population of [408,879,069 above 15 (age). Out of that 51% speak English. 26% speak French. 32% speak German and 15% speak Spanish.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_European_Union)
---
Yeah, especially back in Vanilla.  If you had 10Mbps back then, you were considered hot shit.
---
Though there has been autoloot in 1.12 it was shift-clicking objects. Very minor quality of life change to have auto looting default and shift-click for normal looting.
---
That's a good point. I guess I assumed they would be able to drop, you just wouldn't be able to do anything with them yet.
---
It can be way more annoying than even that. I was farming a rare mob on the border of VotFW and the Dread Wastes in Pandaria. Annoyed the crap out of me, because if I strayed too for in one direction, when trying to look for it, the whole zone would shift. So the rare would pop up in the new shard, I'd go towards it, the shard would shift and it wouldn't be there anymore. There was no way I could possibly get at the rare that I was looking at, seeing on my screen, because of sharding.
---
Yeah, if this stays in the game, I'm not playing it. Simple as that.
---
How dare you not choose the biggest tusk option
---
Only allow layer switching in a rested area or the starting zone like Elywnn/Northshire.
---
Idk, a warlock that has SM, SL, Ruin would be absolutely fucking terrifying. Rogues would be strong too
---
That song's a banger tho 🔥
---
Sadly I do not. Wasn't expecting this and wasn't recording. Was being streamed by Asmongold though so there must be clips on twitch or YouTube by now
---
Won’t be as try hard as that. Work and responsibilities this time around. Going to enjoy it this time. Take it all in. Everyone’s at a rush to 60 but not me.
---
(Hell yeah brother)[https://i.imgur.com/U8uMaFW.jpg]
---
Well, if you can't please your customers, silence them instead. It's always been a foolproof method for corporations.
---
[Hell yeah brother](https://i.imgur.com/U8uMaFW.jpg)
---
Just think about it logically. Unless they expect 6/7 people to quit before the population levels stabilize they'll cap the number of layers at something below that.
---
The moment they are streaming it stops being a natural interaction, WoW wasnt designed with the intetion of being streamed so the moment they start doing that, it changes the games paradigm. Also in any case griefing was allowed on vanilla, on the customer support tab in game there was stated exemptions to harrasment in game, and spawn, corpse camping was allowed, as well as attacking or killing npcs.
---
To add to this if your nervous about it and NA your more than welcome to join the guild me and friends are making and you can play a warrior and I’ll help teach you that tanking is just knowing the pulls better than everyone else. otherthan that you only have 4-5 moves you work with so it’s easy.
---
It'll all be available in phase 2. The weapons were actually upgraded earlier than the armor, in patch 1.6 (phase 3), so that shouldn't be particularly different--it'll probably be phase 3 by the time people start reaching R14. The armor is the big non-vanilla thing since it was upgraded in 1.11 and is way overpowered in early vanilla. The weapons are on par with BWL weapons but the armor is on the same level as AQ40 loot.
---
This was dumb, I say this as an American.
---
You dolt, most Europeans can speak 3 languages fluently. We Americans can speak English and a line of Spanish asking to use the bathroom. So just stfu?
---
The RPPvP community will just pick a PvP server to roll on. Its the only option available. Similar things have done before.
---
You're telling me
---
Personally I'm going to roleplay as an idiot, a warrior in all cloth with no talents and if anyone denies me a raid spot i will report them.
---
Kappa
---
As someone who views layering as a necessary evil, I'm curious to know what your solution would be to deal with the massive population stress of the launch that wasn't present in the original game?
---
Do we all just sit in queue and fight each other to tag mobs?  I'd like to hear some solutions other than layering, because I do understand that it has negative impacts on the game.  But at the same time, I'd like to be able to actually play it.

Spot on. The people that need this type of attention and validation are the type of people that have failed/abandoned/never even tried anything in life besides WoW.
---
Yeh my character that had it has the achievement I just deleted it at some point of stupidity and now I miss it.
---
Looks useful, saving to add to my repertoire.
---
Some minor tweaks I would like to see:
---
• Discrete line breaks between levels (alternatively: move the level required to the front of each spell).
---
• Total cost to learn all unlearned spells, separate for available spells and unavailable.
---
It’s fun to Google some old internet metrics from 2004.   Throughput isn’t going to be anyone’s problem in 2019 but the world is still plagued by latency challenges in online gaming.  Distance from game servers still introduces latency for many gamers.

---
Afraid of gamer words?
---
What the fuck happened to people man
---
DeadMines.
---
We have no idea how they will do it in practice. Speculating based on the number of layers in a stress test is beyond useless. The entire purpose of a beta and stress test is to test this type of stuff out.
---
Spam L for the self-loathing “American”
---
Not believable enough, 1/10
---
Doesn't say anything about servers not having layering. They probably all had layering just different number people allowed in each layer.
---
Same tbh. I'm looking at around Dec for my 60 ding.
---
Am game designer.
---
Can confirm - players think they know better than us.
---
BFA does not have layering.
---
Honestly I would rather they do something about the leeway and spell batching before this. That shit is more game breaking than something that’s gonna go away after phase 1 anyway
---
No thanks.
---
&gt;Im guessing it was put on my launcher strictly for the 48hr stress test?
---
wow, you guessed right. gj
---
&gt; wait 20 minutes
---
Well if you're not hopping layers, the wait doesnt matter right?
---
&gt; from general
---
You think the entire server (rather than the layer) are going to have access to the same /1? 15K people in Barrens chat isnt going to work, and certainly isnt "no changes".
---
except that wasn't "all you were saying", you said he's incredibly naive if he thinks there's no chance. Where the chance you're talking about is 0.00000000000000000000000000000000001%. which makes you naive. Not him.
---
Why? It's not an English Server but a European one.
---
Banning anything but English would be the wrong thing especially if you consider the odds of one Server being mostly German or French.
---
We have a pretty good idea now from beta. [This is current characters at 40.](https://imgur.com/2cvu2Ry) (Source: wowclassicpopulation.com) Mages will certainly be in the top 3 classes on both sides. Every survey, private server and beta realm agrees.
---
Yeah and that's why there will be much more server than only one for a fucking private server.
---
Stay away from Gold Coast Quarry! That's where the cool kids hang out.
---
Loathing, no. Not an asshole* bingo.
---
Neat, stay in your tiny world faggot
---
You said the same people complaining about layering are the same people that would complain about not getting a mob tag, no?
---
Getting a mob tag with layering turned on is EXACTLY as difficult as getting a mob tag on normal server size with layering turned off. It’s difficult regardless, and you will be competing against hundreds of players to tag mobs. 
---
I’m not complaining about tagging mobs. Tagging mobs is going to be incredibly annoying unless they add sharding. I’m talking about layering. Keep up bud
---
I get your point but saying hemo will only do 10% less dps than a proper pve spec is not true. The damage will be way less. 30% or more and the debuff is just not worth the slot. 
---
So all in all, even in BiS gear and with everything on farm a hemo rogue can't contribute as much dps to a raid, which will result in slower clear times.You can do some ZG or AQ20 or even MC later as hemo, but that will be months away from now. If a raidleader can chose between a player willing to spec combat and one playing hemo , the combat rogue gets the raidspot. No one likes to stay longer in a raid dungeon than needed.
---
I cry as this speed of internet only recently became available in my area. Anyway, I played on even slower until recently and other than insane patch downloading times it was doable. I will say I haven't been a raider for a long time, but general gameplay was absolutely fine.
---
Based on your username, did you [help design the original Xbox controller?](https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2002/03/25/ursine-adventures)
---
/s .... kinda.
---
I mean, they obviously can't tell you how they're going about it. Its a blind test.
---
Was mostly because it was being streamed by Asmongold so he drew a massive crowd
---
&gt; [In January this year it found Australia’s average fixed line download speed was just over 33 megabits per second.

---
Not a lot amazes me.. But the amount of people that still watch this adultbaby amazes the fuck out if me.
---
We'll go by their latest iterations since that makes the most sense
---
Diablo III: Blizzard thought it would be a good idea to add a paid auction house for loot and then balance the game around that feature. It wasn't until they pulled their collective head out of their collective ass and corrected it that the game became acceptable. Not to mention that the next big entry in that series is -wait for it- a mobile game. I'm sure that's not going to be marred by any overly obstructive monetization practices \*cough cough\*.
---
Overwatch has been accused of having a stale and boring meta over and over for 2 years now. Sure the core gameplay is good (probably much to do with Jeff Kaplan, who was one of the lead designers of vanilla WoW...) but it's not peak game design. 
---
Starcraft II again had very notable problems with game design when it came out, as a lot of the pro scene pointed out. Again, it has gotten better with time but the damage was done when it launched.
---
Hearthstone. The game basically Pay2Win with the entry barrier stacked so high if you aren't willing to empty your wallet. Hardly a contender for 'good game design'. It's not unique among card games because of that but that doesn't make it good.
---
And Retail WoW. The game is so good now that a large community built up over the years that would rather play a 15 year old version of it than the current one. Not to mention dwindling population numbers or the numerous criticisms of the last 3? 4? expansions. It's laughable for you to hold up retail as some beacon of good game design. 
---
Modern Blizzard knows how to market and how to make addictive (and not addictive because the gameplay is so good) micro transaction ridden mobile game-esque crap that appeals to the lowest common denominator.
---
Remind me to turn off General Chat...
---
It's just the constant for how much AP it takes to deal 1 extra point of damage.
---
I don't get why they don't just do dynamic respawns for the first few weeks instead. If all the mobs are dead in the area, or too many players are around, just enable dynamic respawns to funnel people out. Don't let it work on rare mobs/elites, only normal spawns + named quest mobs. Way less of an impact that layering will have, and they can still just turn it off after a couple of weeks.
---
Private Servers have been doing this for years and it doesn't have anywhere close to the amount of negatives tied to it as layering does.
---
WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BREXIT BLIZZARD?
---
They used to not be. I payed on the French swtor realm and raided actively it was great. Lots of French player haven't migrated to the English realm and just quit the game, because English is just a pain in the ass for them. Why would you spoil your fun doing something you hate (speaking English?)
---
Fair play to Soda. 
---
I wasn't aware layering would work that way, I thought it just spread people out into 'mini servers' in populated areas, but I didn't know you could chose to hop at opportune moments.
---
That is genuinely game / immersion breaking for me if left in. That's not what vanilla WoW was - and it's not what Classic WoW should be.
---
No way to know for sure if they were on a different server. I just randomly asked people in world chat if they could invite me to their party real quick and most people did. Layer hopping could be exploited not only with the gurubashi chests but also with mining and herbalism.
---
The fact that they're globals means that there will always be people no matter what. Which means that there won't be any super low pop. 
---
I'd rather have dynamic spawn and respawns than layering to be honest. 
---
I don't know what tedium is so i'm not going to say anything about it.
---
We started making a conscious effort to use in AQ40.  We eventually gave up on it when Naxx pretty much killed our guild.  Either way, just want to state they were used.  It's 15 years old, this isn't new stuff.  No one was complaining about this two weeks ago.
---
Though, I doubt I'll be doing any world buffs with any sort of regularity come Classic.  No patience for that nowadays.  But that doesn't mean it should be removed for others.
---
Whoops, you caught me. I'm under NDA so no telling!
---
Yeah except those 10k servers didn't get their entire populism 3 weeks.  They built up to that.
---
I see you never met French people.
---
Blizzard forums are pure cancer.
---
Had a lot of fun on our adventures
---
-Kiinu
---
You still salty you didn’t get the class rebalancing you were crying for on here for a year?
---
Yeah, that means there might be some weight to them.
---
As opposed to it as I am, I can agree that maybe having it in the starting area, possibly the zone right after is somewhat reasonable. I'd still rather not have it, but I can see why it's "needed". But the entire continent including cities? Hell no.
---
Still a beta. I have faith blizzard will iron out the details
---
Wow, finally I meet another person with a brain! Hello friend.
---
They are not overpopular, but they are one of the most popular classes in wow and they tend to top any percentage list.
---
From what i've experienced in the vanilla community from private servers everyone is grouping. So hopefully the people you met were just bfa kids that think the game is supposed to be played alone.
---
I'm sure someone will, but considering that people that want to do this are just as pathetic as the people who want to follow them around and give them gold to be on stream for a brief moment.
---
I'm not going to participate, instead I'm going to play the game.
---
I am on the last city in my region to have ADSL 10 Mbps (hopefully i'll get fiber end of 2019), you can play most game, ping is decent (25 to 50ms). But forget watching 1080p stream at the same time. I can barely do 2 things at a time now, my 512k ADSL 15 years ago was faster than this shit because every single ad/image is in high resolution, website, youtube, none bother optimizing the quality/data.
---
You'll have some issue with discord on FPS games, it will make your ping spike if your upload is too low like mine -800kbps, but you should be fine with wow.
---
And the side note, it tooks me 2 days to dl Destiny 2 (80go) and i couldnt do a single thing with my internet during this period, so if you didn't dl the wow client, start now :s
---
No. Tanks are always needed.
---
You could always get addons to show cooldowns in a HUD as well. That’s where I like them.
---
&gt;1. Blizzard has confirmed that layering will stay till phase 2. So 2-3 months. 
---
Where? The only detail I've seen on the timeline is ion stating a few weeks. A few is 3. I'm sure there's some wiggle room on that,  but anything more than 4 or 5 would not be considered as a few by a reasonable person.
---
I asked my 10 year old nephew what the greatest game of all time was and he answered Splatoon. I told my brother that he failed as a father. 
---
I have a modded snes mini loaded with a full library from gameboy colour to snes to set my kids down the right path. When they beat Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 6, then they will graduate to WoW Classic.
---
Ayeee my dude, nice meeting you in classic
---
Why would they? At the most they might RT a tweet about it.
---
&gt;Where the chance you're talking about is 0.00000000000000000000000000000000001%
---
You are naive if you think the chacne is that low
---
I don't expect everyone to have even a basic understanding of economics (I only learned about it in college) but they should at least be able to defend their position. 'Layering bad' doesn't tell us anything about it's impact on the game's economy.
---
I'll check out your post, thanks.
---
It just involves going to BRD. And no, I am going to drop it and go engineering afterwards. If I were alliance, I would just go with Ward of the Elements
---
Alright, go n'a have to say it here. The people you play with are the ones who are OK with speaking English. There a quite small minority in France for exemple. Lots of French people don't bother playing private servers because of English. Your post is basically saying "look, confirmation bias!"
---
They can tell you what they're going to do, how they're going to do it but not on which server. And that would do the exact same since you can't know anyway but ok.
---
Your latency not your bandwidth will determine your in-game experience.
---
If you say so. I remember a lot of rogues going hemo and doing fine in Naxx/AQ with servo arm.
---
Thats true but I dont have 12 hours a day to play vanilla like I used to. I only have so much time in a day to play
---
Back in vanilla IB wasn't toggle, so people would do exactly what you said.  cancel aura at the start of the macro, so you could press the same button again to break it early.
---
Sure Mages will be popular, but not to an unhealthy amount
---
Well we'll see if there's 10k players at the release of the new server tomorrow. Trust me there will be.
---
By that definition neither is any weird Al song. He keeps the temp, beat, length of lyrics. (Same as the troll silly) but his songs are criticizing my my American pie by converting it to Star wars......
---
Blizzard has every right to put that in game.
---
stopcasting CS, focus poly can be two useful ones.
---
I really want this to have been taken moments before a re-enactment of [Club Thrall.](https://youtu.be/FUsF8weJJWs?t=971)
---
Was layering a thing in classic WoW?
---
You'll be fine
---
Bro its not really about your speed. Its more about the stability of your connection. 
---
As long as your connection is decently stable you’ll never even notice that your internet speed isn’t very high.
---
Doesn’t even how wow installed
---
I know
---
Difficult to know for sure!
---
If Blizzard truly thought classic was going to fail *they wouldn't be doing it*.
---
Listen to yourselves. Why would any Blizzard exec *ever* approve the revival of vanilla if they thought it would fail?
---
Jeeeez, just play the game. Stop trying to cast Blizzard in a bad light.
---
As you're leveling up you will find gear is not a huge deal to people, I tanked RFK and our healing shaman rolled on Corpsemaker to level with.... whatever, doesn't bother me. As you get closer to max level and BIS items start dropping, it would be wise beforehand to say you're rolling on dps gear at the start of the dungeon or as the group is forming... some people may have issues with this but you can tell them to find a new group or you can easily find a new group, tanks are a commodity... dps is everywhere. You'll have a lot easier time than them grouping for dungeons.
---
Thrall needs to get nightfall asap
---
It absolutely will not. Layering DOES NOT address overcrowding in the starting zones on launch. Layers are capped at the size of a vanilla server. On launch, you will be competing with 3k+ people on your layer in the starting zones.
---
Layering is a solution offered in place of eventual server merges, that’s it. Almost every post I see on here confuses retail sharding with layering.
---
That isn't how blind tests work. I'm sorry friend, but this isn't even an arguable thing. Blind tests don't operate that way.
---
Yeah, I forgot I have the Big Blizzard Bear from my 2008 Bizzcon virtual ticket on my account. I rode that thing all over then it got buried in my mountain of other mounts and forgotten... Now I see that they are selling for 1200+ too bad I used my card as soon as I got it back in the day.
---
&gt; Lol 1 server without any layers, you wouldn't see anyone.
---
&gt; Because you wouldn't be in the game.
---
Remember when I said this like 5 minutes ago and you responded saying private servers do it np?
---
I always took it as nerzul thinking he could overpower arthas but he underestimated arthas’ will
---
Honestly, true vanilla experience will be when Classic gets reopened in two years time and all the dedicated folk come back to give it another shot sans layering
---
This. DL rate doesn't matter. I sometimes play tethering my phone for 4G internet... and I'm not on an unlimited package.
---
If you don't want to think of yourself as a healer - Don't roll Druid. We are healers. If you want to PVP: 8/11/32. 
---
You can get away with a Balance/Resto dual spec for a bit more damage, but you'll just be ok at doing dps and ok at healing. The 0/30/21 Feral/Resto is the same, you'll be ok at healer and ok-enough to tank some 5 mans and do mediocre damage.
---
IMO - look into a shadow priest/Undead - Devouring plague is a super great racial for priests / Will is likewise fantastic.
---
Oof all you can manage to do is lfr on retail and you're gonna play classic?
---
That shit has GOT to GO
---
I'm in the beta and played all of vanillia. The game doesn't feel easier than it should, at least to my memory.
---
Server 15, Asmongold Layer 7, Asmongold Guild 2, Asmongold raid group 4, Group 2, Ahhhhhh, home. Just like i remember it.
---
My son was just too small to use the keyboard. Eventually, he started using a controller. Then eventuallllllyyyy.... He wanted to try fortnite. Instantly hooked. His hands are almost big enough to use a keyboard and mouse
---
If that's what you mean than yeah sure. The meme that you won't be a special snowflake for rolling warrior/mage is very silly. I would say the only meaningful generalisations are druids are unpopular like you said, and warlocks and unpopular on alliance (they're actually below druids atm @40 on beta-pvp).
---
Yes yes. I know. Did you miss the part where I said "I want layers" and "All praise the layers". Cause I know it would be 3-8 times worse without layers.
---
If you say so, hopefully they're going to make a blue post explaining what settings they tried on each servers.
---
I remember having a macro for /g Grats! - because grat'sing everyone in the guild for whatever achieve they got was important to me  (I started right before WotLK...aka right before achieves became a thing.)
---
Brother, you’re showing just how little you understand the games economy. If you want me to get all “economics” I will, but in laymen’s terms 
---
Many herbs, gems, and leather are expensive to a server population of 3k. The scarcity and necessity is what gives them value. Imagine somebody is exploiting this (as I will be when I hit 60) and stockpiling expensive materials. Then the layers all collapse and we’re all on one layer. Instead of having 5 layers worth of black lotus to handle the massive population, were down to one. The price on the item further skyrockets, and I have a bank full of them because all I had to do was log off or get an invite from another guy in another guild. 
---
I have two options. Control the rare market and sell high, only to top buyers in huge guilds that need the items for progression, OR sell at an equilibrium to make HUGE fucking gains in gold. We’re talking tens of thousands of gold. 
---
Now I have buying power nobody has. I can literally take over any market. Runecloth, Twink gear, grenades. I have a monopoly on as many markets as I can afford. 
---
People complain about mafias. The thing about a mafia is it’s hard to set up and greed kills it over time. The thing about layer exploiting is I can (and will) do it solo, very easily. It’s not just “something that won’t matter” when you have to farm for mats instead of buying them because I’ve upped the price on elemental fire to 15g per
---
No I'm certain there isn't anyone at all ever going to try to kill streamers.
---
I intend to join a server with as few streamers as possible.
---
There will be no dead servers with layering :^)
---
Haha just gotta find something she likes man! For the wife it was the fishing mini game (and leveling trade skills) and shooting frost bolts at everything that moves. 
---
She fn hates healing tho. Which makes me sad because warrior + shaman is my wet dream combo.
---
“Blindly hating a mechanic” wrong, we are on this specific post because layering shows EXTREMELY clear and distinct problems. Its hardly blind when this is the case..
---
LOL We're almost there! You can make it!
---
It probably just got an invite to a different layer.
---
That looks hwo i thought ironfoeged looked when i first saw it
---
Not if general is only your layer
---
I want to play Rogue. It was always a huge misconception that they're just as popular as warriors, etc. But they're actually very middle of the road (at least according to all the class polls going around). 
---
Even if they were overpopulated I'd still play rogue. I'd rather play a less desired class and love it than a desirable class and hate it.
---
I mean, all their major IPs are in various states of decline. Combined with constant gaffes and miscalculations, and attempts to follow trends 2 years too late - it’s pretty clear Blizzard today is nothing like the company whose games I grew up on.
---
Just as classic is in beta, layering is in beta. This is the first iteration of layering ever shown to the public. Of course there will be bugs, problems, and abuse. 
---
I'm still holding off until actual release to pass judgement on layering. Is layering good as it is now, definitely not. Will this version of layering make it to launch, probably not.
---
*Oh nooo, what will we do when all those hardcore raiders farm flowers for a week after hitting 60?*   
---
No one will have the gold to buy this shit as the majority of the playerbase will be in the 30-40 range if that and layering will go away a few weeks after launch. This is a non-issue.
---
LULW KAPPA POGGERS
---
But how can you clean up DIRT?
---
There shouldn’t even be multiple Gurubashi chests per layer.. it devalues the actual reward.
---
Help me understand, genuine curiosity. Wouldn’t it make more sense to choose an RP realm and have everyone just flag up for WPvP on that realm? So the rp community is what you have, and you are telling people to flag instead of the regular PvP community being what you have, and telling people to RP.
---
2 days after it goes live: "unpopular opinion: we NEED a megathread for all these lazy DING screenshots"
---
At this rate, with the issues with layering and the bugs that are STILL being reported, I wouldn't be surprised if Classic is delayed by a few more months.
---
I didn't like this idea before, but after playing the stress test I'm now completely on board. I think this is how I'm going to start the game on August 27th.
---
This was today?
---
I think this is a meta comment on the 1 server for all nations in Europe that Blizz went with.
---
Lots of people complaining that it should be split up into a few servers for the different major languages.
---
I'm on neither side.  But people have just been saying "just speak english and it won't matter".  So in that case he means they'll need to speak English in Portugal to do this Dungeon because of Blizz's server decision.
---
Sorry if this didn't need explaining.
---
I've been asking that for the past two years, and the others keep telling me no.
---
In TBC one of my guild mates used his phone as an internet source. This was like 2007 or so, it’s a miracle it worked
---
Would making it so there was a time limit on hoping layers would help ? Can’t change layers per 1 hour ? Idk
---
That's probably just from the stress tests and the beta. In reality you would never see people come in and out of existence like with sharding at any point unless someone else joined a group and left or entered or you joined a group
---
VC is DeadMines abbreviation 
---
Although it depended on your server
---
Obviously there will be multiple server since it's a company not a private server. If you can't even understand that i'm only talking about the fact that private servers run the release pretty much smoothly and they don't need layering even with 8k people well i can't do much for you.
---
I still don't understand how RP-PvE works.  It seems like if you're friendly with the opposing faction, you're not really doing the RP thing.
---
Celebrating a server first but it's actually a world 50,000th kill seems ridiculous to me.
---
nice video :kap:
---
Yeah, if blizzard doesn’t put a player cap on servers. I’d much rather have a player cap on servers than have layering. And at a certain point you hit critical mass. There’s no real difference between 600 people competing for mobs and 3000 people. People are going to log off in droves regardless, and you’re going to hop on league or fortnite. Because competing against even one guy is a pain in the ass
---
Not OP but that definitely isn't what he was asking
---
Because I’d rather a shocking launch and a good game experience over a smooth launch and a completely fucked up experience. I believe no layering is the right move - but I am very open to removing it outside of the 1-20 zones..
---
I recall Blizz or some Pserver showing stats, how most players quit before they got to 20. If thats really the case - we’ll be fine.
---
Afaik the only way to interact with another other layer players is through mp, as guilds &amp; friends are supposed to play on the same one.
---
Works if you're a streamer or purposely tried to do so, but you shouldn't have to change layer for content as they should each hold a vanilla server population.
---
No I'm going to focus on myself and my enjoyment in the game. Who gives a fuck what other people are doing in it.
---
&gt; People can't turn down even the slightest advantage 
---
So it's just like how they changed potions so you didn't have one of every kind on because it was too much to farm all the time.  They clumped them into like defensive, offensive and something else.  Because originally you could have one of every potion and scroll on.
---
She's going to grow up to be a Night Elf and you're going to have to respect her choices.
---
Keybinding &amp; macros do provide a measurable improvement, but for non-healers, the slower reaction time usually isn't as much of an issue. The mechanics aren't that demanding, really, and you generally have time to click without missing your necessary windows. (caveat - clicking is risky because when shit hits the fan, clickers are often less adept at improvising. I'm just looking at standard play, not masterful heroic saves)
---
It's like getting a school grade of 94% vs 100% - one's clearly better, but they are both sufficient for the A grade
---
The good thing about Mages is that they are just so incredibly broken. Id rather have a dozen Mages in my raid fighting for gear than moonkins, rets or enhancer trying to dps
---
I remember people alwayslooking for a caster type dps because hunter rogue warrior would all compete for the same shit it felt like.
---
We do need more testing.  And this is a good find during beta.
---
I do wish they would invite more people to beta to hopefully find more things.
---
I don't expect classic launch to be without some hiccups like this, but the more we can squash now the better!
---
They were looking into using sharing as a solution, and wanted to limit it to starting zones during opening weeks. At no point did he say that this was the defacto truth and is absolutely what is going to happen. This subreddit and streamer blew it up. 
---
In fact, the reason it only came up during the Q&amp;A is because they didn't have an actual plan yet
---
I recall rolling on an absolutely swamped private server with jacked up dynamic respawns and even the Valley of Trials at the moment of release was barely an issue. How is it a bunch of randoms could figure this out but not Blizzard? Do we really need sharding in Thousand Needles and Eastern Plaguelands?
---
I don’t have that. Mine says PTR legion
---
Wrong. Look at my other comment
---
I just don't get why people are upset with thing that really fucking sucks.
---
You want a stress test without layering, or did you forget what your OP was already? I responded directly to your op.
---
Jesus christ almighty.
---
Personally if I had to choose I would prefer the forced PvP flags over the RP realm specific rules like naming your characters. I would think that the RP community feels that way in general, but maybe thats wrong.
---
Is this all horde players?
---
can't you see how having to stop playing for 10 minutes can be annoying?
---
With how many streamers are planning to play together its very possible the info gets out and it just takes one person slipping up. I mean with layering even if you are on the same server as one you might not see them.
---
you're absolutely correct.  Most of Al's songs don't fit the legal definition of a parody.
---
That's why he always gets permission from the artist and their label before recording his version.
---
My son started playing vanilla back when he was 5.  He's 18 now.  He would create random characters on my account and get up to about level 10.  Then got bored. Started something nee.  I have so many of his old toons still on my account that i a lot of them have stuff in their bags that are no longer available.  It's kind of neat to show off deprecated items.  lol
---
My biggest concern in simply just being able to play the game at launch.  With zero layering, most of the players will be sitting in queues.  The other half will be fighting their faction to tag quest mobs.  That to me is a completed fucked up experience.  If layering solves that, and the side effect is that some no-lifes get a head start on black lotus farming, I'll take that over simply not being able to log on and play
---
How? Wouldn't that just drive the prices lower for a few weeks? That's great
---
What the hell? This wasn't even possible in the beginning of the beta, right? I swear it wasn't and this is flat-out phasing, this is not a different system at all. I'm really disappointed to see this and if this is actually how it will be the ""first"" phase to avoid "server load" then RIP classic.
---
The lead devs has said soooo many times that they know how much phasing will ruin the feeling of classic and ruin the community of realms, but they seem to have forgotten about that already which is just sad. 
---
**Listen Blizzard**, if you want Classic WoW to succeed.. then get this system FAR away from classic. Either have it in starting zones only (which you said would be the case just a few months ago) OR simply remove it and let there be realm queues. I don't care anymore if I have to sit in a queue for 6 hours on launch, I would rather do that than to have this in the game. This system will ruin everything classic stands for, stop forgetting about that already. You are going behind our backs on this issue and we don't appreciate it at all.
---
If you're doing this to please the retail community that are currently playing the game, then just drop this entire project right this second because it will tank harder than Diablo 3 and I'm sure you don't want that on your record. Either remove layering all together or keep it in but strictly for starting zones (which btw you said was the plan just a while back, what happened to that?).
---
Oh and another thing, the fact that you don't update us on these issues speaks volumes. You know the reaction your new plans to further decrease the cost of servers will have from the community, but keeping it a "secret" until launch is just both wrong and stupid. Never lie, cause the truth will always come out.
---
My city was completely empty on the same realm.
---
Thanks layering! If not for you I might have had to interact with people in this mmo, thank God for not having to do that.
---
I won't be remembered by anyone because of layering so that's great
---
Yes happened right around 5 pm Eastern
---
Completely understood. I guess it would just depend on if you care more about the PvP or the RP aspect of things. It always seemed like RP servers had such fun community events, but I’ve never really delved into things.
---
The literal Horde Circlejerk. I never thought I'd live to see it.
---
Well yes, and so can the majority of France, Germany, Spain, Italy.... Yet there is ENOUGH people that dont, which is why this is a "problem". 80 million Germans, 5 mill Norwegians, say 3/4 know reasonable English... Big diffrence.
---
Are you new?
---
Slower weapons have higher dmg, so if you had 2 same dps weapons you would always want to use slower weapons to get a bigger dmg on your skills, at some point they "normalized" it so that didnt had an effect and you only had to worry about the dps number. This would have an impact on classic bis lists.
---
Thank you! Yes I actually narrowed it down to Dwarf Priest or Human Rogue now... Perhaps I'll have to do both at some point because I can't really let one down for the other haha.
---
I had so much fun, leveled with someone from 1 to 8ish until he had to go to bed. Took FOREVER but was a blast! My hype is huge, but at least I know it's legit hype and not nostalgia now.
---
Splitting people into smaller servers is basically layers but permanent.
---
This comes out to 255 characters, squeezing in a #showtooltip:
---
    /use [mod:shift,@mouseover,help][mod:shift,help]Healing Touch;[mod:shift,@mouseover][mod:shift]Wrath;[mod:ctrl,@mouseover,help][mod:ctrl,help]Healing Touch (Rank 1);[mod:alt,@player]Healing Touch;[stealth]Pounce;Claw
---
I got rid of the spaces in your mod:ctrl, and got rid of the harm conditions for Wrath (since you have help defined for shift in the previous, Wrath should be fine without the harm conditions, right?
---
Since your mod:ctrl is only for helping, you could probably save another 10 characters by getting rid of the help conditions there, right?
---
The queues weren't that bad after the initial rush.  Numbers in the hundreds, but they moved fast.  I would just come home, start the queue, get some food and drink and be ready to raid.  Source: played Tichondrius throughout Vanilla.
---
PLEASE
---
NO LAYERING 
---
QUEUES ARE PREFERABLE
---
My layer was empty.
---
Really puts the Massively Multiplayer in MMOs when your capital city is completely empty whilst people surround you...invisibly...on another shard...
---
itt: stress testing bobby b
---
HOLD YOUR TONGUE!
---
Correct. Everything you said is true for every language and country in Europe.
---
You're a confused person.
---
I just hope I find out which servers are being hijacked by specific nations so I can find an English speaking one...
---
Bran was a builder, not an explorer.
---
Oh, in that case I fully agree with you.
---
Because they'll go everywhere, they're like eats. But hey you do you, if you don't want other players in your MMORPG that's fine.
---
Supply goes up, cost comes down. You can't explain that.
---
Swiftmend is really steep in terms of mana cost you are right, and if you have swiftmend usually you have the mana base to counteract it (along with it's an emergency large heal like NS, not something to be spammed 24/7 because you will run out fast).
---
Healing threat should never be an issue with a semi-decent tank. (Even a terrible tank should have 0 issues holding against healing threat) Even if you do pull healing threat, shift bear -&gt; hit bash -&gt; recover. It's a garbage talent.
---
As for your talent spec question something around these lines:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/0140003-5032001-055503105015011
---
It's pretty close to feral FC spec.
---
The side effect of that is more of a ripple effect which includes problems like this shown above, it can be abused to farm rare spawns along with herbing.
---
The deal with Black Lotus, Ghost Mushroom, Grave Moss is that its meant to be super limited in supply. Black Lotus generally has 5-6 active spawns MAX at any one time.. what happens when suddenly you have 4 layers with 6 spawns? 
---
We have extra fucking resources which deflate the value completely. Its not a matter of “one person having a few extra lotus” its a matter of the entire server having too many lotus.
---
Yeah that seems to be the case, but I think escalotes is right. WotLK kicks off because Arthas does take over the last of Ner'Zhul's soul. But at the time of WC3 pushing in to classic, theyre both combined in there it seems.  
---
So you're right Arthas kills off Nerzhul but not by this point.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=10418
---
Trinket that gives fear immunity for 30sec on a 10 minute CD.  Vanilla had a ton of useful trinkets and you'd swap them often in a BG.
---
5-7 days is unrealistic for the 99.9% but 4-6 weeks is in no way hardcore
---
No we didn't go to  "well if some spend there time creating a business around it", this is a worst case scenario where abuse will be rampant. Another option is somebody will write an addon to group up for different layers. This will be abused either way via people just inviting each other to groups until it works. The abuse is not even the main point, it ruins the game experience. And yeah you can pretty easily set this system up with a bunch of alts multiboxed in the same spot, and allow people to collect 5 black lotuses at once.
---
Why not? He'd fit right in with the rest of us.
---
They're not saying anything because there is no fix. Layering is working as intended. They're staying quiet because they hope this shitstorm will just blow over with time.
---
Yeah if I'm tanking on a druid I won't go out of my way for a rogue. If I'm healing on a priest I won't go out of my way for warlocks/mages. But honestly, that's all secondary to just finding a group and sending it.
---
wtf are you even talking about ? I don't even understand what you're trying to say you don't make any sense. 
---
Just put some servers just like right now, deactivate the layering, see how it plays out and what the feedbacks are. Simple ? (:
---
We don't care
---
Summoning changing your layer wouldn't be an issue, still couldn't be abused in this way.
---
Keyboard turner?
---
I won't. I'm just gonna play on a realm that doesn't have a streamer on it
---
Orrrrr, ask in general for a group. I did literally every quest in Westfall during the test aside from The Coast Isn’t Clear.
---
Dude... it's like you have this narrative in your head and so you want to just force it on everyone in every situation...
---
"These BFA babies ruined my game with their "not wanting to waste time" mentality! If anyone complains about something that takes too long, I'm going to accuse all of them of having the mentality that ruined the game!"
---
Like, dude, when you're a hammer everything looks like a nail. Open your mind a little.
---
Should call your guild beta males
---
yeah but that's at a completely different point in the game with the BiS weapon for hemo.You might do fine as a human rogue then. But in the beginning the damage output of all classes will be way lower, so your personal dps is more important.
---
Anal \[Cleansing\], Anal \[Purge\], Anal \[Rupture\], Anal \[Hemorrhage\], Anal \[Pain Supression\]... Oh god the list is endless!
---
Or "\[Pinto\] na \[Francisca\]" for the portuguese speakers of Warsong (US).
---
Still ripe for abuse. It's the concept itself.
---
Rosy glasses of nostalgia headfirst into the granite wall of reality.
---
There was no such thing in Classic.
---
You gotta go after concurrency. The concurrency of a vanilla realm was intentionally designed to be around 3k people. When 70% of the playerbase leave what you're left with is a server with 900 people online during prime time at most. But hey that's fine, I don't enjoy dead servers but if you do then that's your right.
---
Why isn't this ever higher up? It won't exist forever, only during the initial explosion of the playerbase.
---
At least he agrees it is bogus
---
it really only proves that the mods here are garbage human beings
---
downvoted.
---
https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=234
---
Here is Ion talking about this exact thing. The above clip is him talking about this from the beginning. The clip below this is just him specifically saying layers hold a standard realms population.
---
https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=340
---
Layering makes me sad. I made friends and then crashed and was sent into another layer never to find them again
---
I just played the stress test as a hunter. Got to 15 and cleared all the way to VC in Deadmines. The only really noticeable thing was pets, they are literally gimp. They would go in, attack once, then return to you. Sometimes they wouldn't auto cast things on their bar. Their response time to commands was really delayed most of the time. It was painful but playable. I could deal with at launch but it needs to be fixed as soon as they can
---
yep, i rather have it "ready when it's ready" than this hybrid riddled with bugs.
---
bUT mA InsTAnT grATifIcAtIOn!!1111oneEleVenOnE
---
LMAO I was in my twenties when the game came out. Calm your tits kid
---
I really enjoyed BFD because as a tank that already knew it well, it let me feel like a total boss guiding people through it even though my toon was still low level in crap gear.
---
Like I don't even care but by the time launch rolls around warriora and rogues are gonna be shit dps lol
---
Feh, I'm looking forward to a polished and fully coded/scripted alternative to play with my friends, and maybe some new ones along the way. Had a great time going on and off with Nostalrius for close to a year, and I have no reason to believe classic will be a worse experience. Nostalgia isn't evil.
---
I will make this much easier - DO NOT LAYER CONTESTED ZONES.
---
I think it would fix the major issues right there. This helps the starting zones (1-10, 10-20 zones), once you exit those, you hit the contested zones where all the good stuff starts to happen (and on PVP servers, PVP!)
---
This also prevents any resource abuse by changing phases (for devilsaur leather, black lotuses, etc.)
---
The difference in multiplier is 3.  It's not 3%.
---
Vanilla multiplier 3.3 Legion 3.6
---
If you compare damage difference it breaks down into about 5% or 7% for those classes.  This isnt an exact fits all scenarios number it's an on average.
---
For example a high end Warrior DPS difference can be found in this formula.
---
2h Axe 3.8 speed.
---
insec (2H Axe)
---
Damage range (3.3): 692/14*3.3+[46..70] = ~209-233
---
Damage range (3.6): 692/14*3.6+[46..70] = ~223-248
---
Now the difference in numbers here finding the average in each range.
---
221 for the first result
---
235.5 for the second
---
This would be your average damage difference comparison.
---
When compared it comes out to 6.2% in this scenario.
---
I'm not doing all scenarios you're free to.
---
But I just wanted to point out the 3 difference in multiplier isn't the "%" difference being referenced in this thread.  Those are two different things.
---
My numbers are directly from the Github that is the core of the forum post.
---
Any recommendations for sites that will teach me how to write my own macros? I’ll be playing a Warlock, and more importantly I’ll be playing WoW for the first time, and I’d like to maximize my pet control game.
---
I thought I just did? Cheaper black lotuses is a great thing!
---
Completely killing my buzz. Who thought this was logical? We **need* US/EU servers separated. This is only going to divide and potentially kill communities.
---
No one is claiming they ever said it was "absolutely what is going to happen", but that is what they said was their plan at Blizzcon. I don't think it's that complicated to understand.
---
There really isn't. Gaming is a varied hobby with a fuckton of niches. You should have asked, "Is Classic too slow for today's MMO players?" Given that the only other big MMO out there right now is the FF mmo, it's obvious that slow isn't a problem.
---
You have to admit that these problems with layering has just gotten worse though, yes I know there's a lot of crybabies here nowadays, but these issues have just gotten worse and worse and worse. We are seeing stuff now that Blizzard themselves said wouldn't be the case in classic even with the starting layering for phase 1.
---
The one thing that should concern everyone that enjoys the CLASSIC version of WoW, is the fact that the community have found out how to abuse the "layering" system and Blizzard haven't made a single comment about it ONCE. They haven't claimed it was bugged, they haven't claimed it's suppose to be that way, they haven't claimed that it's being worked on, etc etc.. which should be concerning to us all.
---
Blizzard not talking about this is usually an indication that they know people will be very disappointed.
---
Ok.
---
Hopefully they're fixed soon. Thanks for the reply
---
Yo, just wanted to thank you! Im impressed that my thread from 7.3 is still relevant. Also: I hope this bug will get fixed. I would also Thank to the US, but can't post on their forums :D
---
Achievements do that.
---
See you at launch.
---
I read that as the process of scaling down starts in a few weeks and then they will monitor the situation.
---
LOL man you are a clever son of a bitch. SNAP!
---
He actually didn't layer here, the ganker killed him again soon after.
---
As further proof, you can see his previous corpse skeleton when he died the second time.
---
This is where he died the first time

---
I hate layering just as much as everyone else, but soda didn't layer in this case.
---
This reddit is gonna burn the game for themself before it's even out
---
Let me be your sword
---
I ran with a group of all chinese once on Nostalrius and we communicated over google translate the whole time without issue.  They even had proper loot sharing etiquette and liked to use the “:)” a lot.  It was refreshing to see this behavior amongst the stereotypical gold farmers.
---
No, it’s not.
---
How would you go about making a modifier macro for a Mage, say no modifiers casts max rank Blizz while a shift modifier casts R1?
---
Sorry for the Q but your post made macros look more complex then I thought. Is this using the macro capabilities of Retail and was it like this in Vanilla?
---
I'm talking OG release vanilla for 4-6 weeks.
---
You'll see wow classic people having hunters at 60 first week, by end of week 2 all the hardcore dedicated players will likely be 60.
---
Is not the size of de tusk, mon. Tiz the motion of the mandible.
---
Dedicated language layers.
---
Modern problems require modern solutions.
---
Well spoken my troll brudda, well spoken
---
He's back
---
Cya in August!
---
You sound super ignorant about everything..
---
lol. I care way too much about this issue. Regardless of what happens,   hope you're gonna have a good time in Classic anyway =)
---
&gt; We have extra fucking resources which deflate the value completely. Its not a matter of “one person having a few extra lotus” its a matter of the entire server having too many lotus.
---
This doesn't make sense.  If they extra layers provide additional lotus, the extra layers also allow for additional players.
---
To put it simply, supply increases, but so does demand.
---
I'm curious what recent news you're talking about?
---
Honestly it’s still new and it’s being tested so I would prefer they say nothing until they have made their definitive decision closer to release.
---
I have used "lol new hat" prob every month since vanilla.
---
Right! I'm stoked and ready to go now
---
See you at launch mate
---
Alright pessimistic Andy, many people (and I know this because I had many friends in a discord who actively play WoW and are hyped) didn’t want to play the stress test because they didn’t want to sink the massive amount of time to hit 15 and have it wiped.
---
You edited your comment. And completely changed it.
---
DSL back then was 5 MB if you were lucky and lived 1km from your local demarcation point. Most people got 1 MB and were happy
---
The tank that brings water and potions to my healer every dungeon.
---
Had the same experience. Apparently there were supposed to be hundreds of people in Westfall. I saw maybe 20 tops in that whole time.
---
Catastrophizing Cynthia
---
I don’t think you even know what any of this is lol. Layering is similar to phasing, but instead of per zone (which is phasing), a layer is per world. This is the same as it was when the beta launched and the same as they told us many months ago. Your proposed solution, of only doing this in starting zones, *is* phasing, which you claim you are against. 
---
Nothing about layering has changed on the beta since it launched and Blizzard is not keeping us in the dark about any of it. You are free to dislike layering but there is certainly a fair and honest reason why Blizzard or any company might use it for the first few weeks of a launch. For every person complaining it will ruin classic is another player that will complain and quit when for the first 2 weeks of launch they can’t even get into the realm and if they do they can’t even complete a single starting quest. The alternative is to have a shit load of realms so that starting zones aren’t crowded, but then you open yourself to being stuck on a completely dead server in a few months. When your server is dead and Blizz opens up character transfer I would imagine you and others complaining about layering would also complain about Blizz profiting off of dead server transfers
---
What's your up speed?
---
Soul link early isnt very good because even with the damage reduction you still die before you can kill.
---
You're assuming a relatively constant population, which is false. Layers will be merged because of decreases in population. Prices won't dramatically increase because the ratio of population, ergo demand, to supply won't be dramatically different.
---
I'm still on adsl with no access to anything better, also 3km from the box.
---
I'm talking vanilla wow it took us 4-6 weeks. Those at 4 weeks were first of their classes to 60 as well. I'm just saying, true vanilla was a different beast.
---
I'd say 2 weeks is when dedicated people will reach 60. You'll see some in a week, but that's a fuck ton of sleepless nights. But if all goes well, those people will ring 60 and layering will be shut off.
---
August 13/14 depending on where you are in the world.
---
Right now I’m ~45Mbps give or take. I haven’t moved yet
---
idk maybe there just aren't many Horde players on the beta server
---
Then play on a PvE server. Personally I enjoy trying to escape when I can't defend myself and no backup is able to help out. Don't just run back and rez without thinking if you're being camped, scope out the area to see if they are still around and rez in strategic locations where they're unlikely to see you (making use of distance and obstacles  like bushes, building, maybe underwater etc).
---
He didn't change layers to begin with, you can see his first corpse skeleton when he dies the second time.
---
This is where he died the first time.
---
This is where he died the second time, notice his skeleton in the bottom right corner.

Come on guys it's been like a year and a half and yiz are already donning your rose-tinted glasses.
---
There's been equal parts optimism and cynicism in this sub since its inception. Right from the get go, it was all about 4 stage content plan, wow token speculation, sharding, itemization, 1.12 AV, expansions vs 1.13 and a hundred other things.
---
On the other side, there's always been great art, memes, comics, hype posts, nostalgia stories, screenshots, and another hundred other things. It balances out. Besides, nothing wrong with criticism. As u/Ixilary said, it's because of criticism we even got classic. Being critical is what drives anything forward. Just let the conversation happen. Best ideas float to the top, and all that.
---
(Another point that kinda annoys me about this sub is the circlejerk. Most of the top posts stem from a single blue post made that week and 90% of posts here just latch on to whatever is the most popular opinion, probably for a rabid grab for upvotes. And then a week later they all change their minds because some other big thing pops up in classic news, and everyone agrees by merit of others agreeing with it.)
---
That’s it boys pack er up we’re done here. 
---
But in all honesty don’t act like your not going to be the first one In queue aug. 26. Official servers are going to be miles better than any p-server out there. I’m playing on one of the “best” p servers right now. It’s the first one I’ve tried and I’ve already found so many bugs and discrepancies from the original official game, things I’m not even sure how they missed like loot tables not being correct, items dropping from bosses with wrong rarities and wrong stats. I’ve referenced multiple vanilla wow databases and they all match up but the p server loot doesn’t. So not sure what magical p server your referring to that will be better because the best one out currently isn’t even that close to actual vanilla. It’s the best we have right now but it won’t compare to blizzard servers.
---
This does have a pretty large impact, so hopefully it gets the attention it deserves. Definitely can't stay in the game
---
The other guy already tore you a new hole, so I'll keep it light. Layering is a temporary system to handle massive population. Blizzard has said this many many times, but you loud obnoxious people refuse to hear it. If something as simple as layering (which improves the play experience for all) is such a horrible thing for a few weeks, then likely the issue is you. Your attitude that the rest of the server pop has to suffer so you can mass stream snipe some streamer so you can feel like you ever accomplished something in your life, is the real thing that needs to fuck off. 
---
Thank god for PvE servers where I don't have to contend with little man syndrome with a bunch of manchildren whose entire sense of self worth is ganking a half health mage ten levels below ganking while he's grinding panthers.
---
For me it’s decent, could be better, could be worse
---
I mean, that's legitimately why it's different on Retail.  Some of the changes that have been made to the game were improvements for many players. 
---
My personal preference? I really liked early Cata heroics.  I think the balance there was brilliant at being hard for the right reasons pre-nerf.
---
you're the kind of person nobody wants to be friends with if your report names on an rp server
---
No because there weren’t several million players trying to login on the same day
---
I could not like this more... I think layering will RUIN classic if it stays for more than a week. Even a week is way too long.
---
I'm saying the Classic team deserves the benefit of the doubt as they've treated Classic different than the development teams of retail.
---
Grats. Different team now. Circlejerker. Stay mad, that sounds fun.
---
I would agree with that but the layers are created for the “tourist players” - Blizz doesn’t even think they’ll hit 60 meaning at the higher levels there will be more layers with less people in them..
---
The layering system was literally created to deal with players who won’t be sticking around.
---
I'll use it. Please make it!
---
That’s called phasing which is what is in retail and everybody hates
---
Awesome, thank you! Is that before release or a little before?
---
You're right, he didn't change layers. He got killed again shortly after. You can even see his corpse skeleton from the first time he died, meaning he stayed on the same layer.
---
This is where he died the second time, notice his corpse skeleton in the bottom right corner.
---
I meant on the new connection.
---
Then learn English. Why should everyone else suffer because you refuse to speak English? Why should server resources be allocated specifically to a bunch of people that just don't want to learn the main language of the world? Get over yourselves.
---
Not sure if I'm misremembering, but I think there was a blue post saying that behaviour at the durotar river was intended, and in fact present in vanilla
---
I haven’t been able to find anything, the 10mbps option isn’t even available , so I’m not sure
---
let's downvote really fast maybe no one will notice
---
This is proof enough that layering will kill off world pvp faster than flying mounts ever did.  Why bother rolling on a pvp server when you can just hop layers to avoid  any pvp?  Funny enough the most fun I've had in vanilla was being corpse camped in the Western Plaguelands.  Yes, it sucked if you wanted to do pve stuff but it made relying on a guild that much more important.  Getting ganked and camped?  Call for reinforcements and spontaneously create your own  mini TM/SS battle.   Again,  that is what made Vanilla Wow so great -- the social aspect, being able to rely on your guild.    Lets face it  layering is only a solution for overly populated pve content and that's all Blizzard has had to deal with for over a decade.  World pvp? what's that?
---
Well, he change his views and opinions once a month it seems so
---
That was me with Brazilians on Gurubashi.
---
Any chance you have a route figured out that starts in dun morough? Think I'll FedEX run my dwarf priest at launch, this idea of yours is absolutely brilliant!
---
Aren't layers supposed to be a "first month or two of launch" solution to high populations? This would concern me if it was here to stay, but if it's going to go away and thus allow servers to dwindle down in population but not let you "see" it, then I'm ok with them. It's not the best solution, and more of a temporary bandage, but I don't see a better solution, especially considering that temporary bandage really is temporary and will come off when it is no longer needed.
---
Good thing it won't exist after launch or phase 1
---
Cant they just make a none see about cooldown for jumping players that would fix this?
---
Blizzard is not going to implement language servers in EU because they think the playerbase will be too small for that.
---
And why doesn’t this happen in retail wow today?
---
The fact you're arguing to have a.mess of server crashes, unbearable and unplayable lag and the other side of stuff that I had to sit through 15 years ago is a joke. There's a big difference between no changes, and no changes including all the dumb shit that had nothing to do with the game and everything to do with 2005 internet and unprepared Blizzard hardware.
---
This subreddit needs to get a grip on reality.
---
And they are probably right. Retail people will crawl back to ez mode leaving the loyal vanilla players splitted among regional servers
---
There's a your mom joke in there somewhere
---
Oh my god, no... Please don't have this on the release client. It is not vanilla experience for christ sake. This creates many problems, how can they not understand we don't want this?
---
That would mean layering is going to last the entirety of phase 1. That's more than a few weeks and is absolutely ridiculous. They could have accomplished the same thing with dynamic spawns, which was in classic on release per one of the original devs.
---
I will have to see how this situation with layering turns out. Might pass Classic as well, not sure.
---
Release is 26th/27th, it's two weeks before.
---
Not to mention classic didn’t have several million trying to login at launch. It took them years to even get the player base that is about to login to classic on the first day. To anybody saying this wasn’t the classic experience you are entirely wrong. Spending 3 hours to get into your realm and another 1 hour to do the first starting zone quest was not the classic experience lol
---
Having all the good blacksmithing recipes.
---
Why is it so hard for blizzard to understand that layering is fricken lame. The community didn't even asked for it or want it. Dynamic respawns is a much better alternative to layering.
---
I'm actually arguing for the opposite. I'm saying that they never said no changes and if layering is needed for an acceptable launch than that's what they should do.
---
Good to know! thank you :)
---
It 100% was... I remember it very vividly in my Vanilla days.
---
Go warlock for curse of doom
---
Sodappoppin 2000IQ plays
---
Stop karma hunting. It won't matter because layering won't be a thing long term. Blizzard has already said this. It's beta, it doesn't matter.
---
(FYI I don't know who sodapoppin is, I don't watch twitch)
---
Yes you would be flagged
---
How does this apply to this sub i’m so confused?
---
Looks like a place from Skyrim.
---
good lord, 3 months? I'm going to have hundreds of black lotus by that time if layering stays
---
I mean so is yours LOL if you can't come up with a better reason then "no changes" or "the economy" then layering for the first couple weeks is the best option and Blizzard is right to not listen to retards like you
---
I used to try to put all the mod buttons into since macros, but it got to be too many. What I do now, is the left-most extra action bar is keybound to Shift 1-6 and Ctrl 1-6. I put a few mod:alt's into my 1-12, but it simplifies things.
---
This isn’t really relevant to classic, should just be in WoW
---
Fuck. This. Shit
---
There's also a huge problem with the leeway mechanics, where melee are able to hit you outside of 8 yards. Perplexity showed how every class can melee beyond 8 yards, with a tauren it is probably closer to 16 yards. If you are moving and they are moving they can hit you from down the block.
---
As a former Agamaggan player since launch and spanish myself, I also migrated never to play with my kin again. 
---
Did you ever play with spaniards? Man theyre the worst
---
no they havent?  they have given no absolute date.  first it was the starting zones, then it was phase 1, then it was phase 2.  i said this awhile ago, but it bears repeating.  blizzard will make no promise on an absolute end date to layering, and will continue its use long after whatever vague dates they do give.  phasing, sharding, layering are one of the THE core issues that people have with the modern game, and its existence in classic is antithetical to the games philosophy.
---
Just play the game then. 99% of people are going to stay in their layer and never leave.
---
One of these things is not like the others. One of these things is an orc
---
Have you ever been to Germany? I would kill for more than 10Mbps. 25Mbps is almost double the speed, that the majority of people have here.
---
You’ll probably be better off with a 1H so you can use Spellstones. They’re also useful against Shaman.
---
Theres np community that early
---
But they need those subs, to fund BFA patch 8.2 and forward.
---
Good point but that's also why they said the end goal is to remove remove layering.  So what you're saying kind of amounts to what I said earlier - some sweaty nerds will get a head start on black lotus.  If the layers are removed in any sort of decent time frame post launch...then I don't think this is gonna destroy the balance of the game.  And I'll take that over massive queues to log in, and fighting for low level mob tags.
---
Imagine from blizzards perspective too.  They would definitely rather a small but loud outcry from the diehards on this sub, than the thousands of refund requests they will get when players reactivate their subscription and are met with 5 hour queues, and a super overcrowded populus where they can't get anything done.
---
Tyrone video?
---
Thanks for reinforcing what I've said.  No matter what they say people like you are just going to believe as you like anyway.
---
Game dies in phase 2 anyway due to DHKs killing off city raids, so basically layers will destroy the only time classic will be remotely good.
---
Pass.
---
Problem is... if anybody is capable of  herbalism during the first 2 days, he just has to move to spawn-camp a black lotus. ANd loot it. and loot it. and loot it. and loot it. Forever. 2 Weeks. And he will be a rich man forever.
---
Or discord's welcome messages. They are not necessarily bad but it's just weird hearing all the famous phrases translated to danish.
---
You say that like it isn’t a huge inconvenience. It already sucked enough having to go to stormwind to toggle war mode just to see people. This system would be that but even worse
---
Nice catch, but it looks like layering actually just brings your corpse with you so that you can be ressed. You'll notice all the mobs outside the cave have suddenly respawned when he switches layer.
---
Layer 1, ca 1 min before dying: https://i.imgur.com/PSTPN7B.png
---
Layer 2, after he corpse runs back, just 2min later: https://i.imgur.com/Wg8dUHR.png
---
There's also a different player corpse missing in the second layer.
---
This is literally how some people think in this sub. All of those complaining about streamers are so braindead they can't figure out that they'll all be on the same server.
---
We are the boomers of gaming
---
What is the real problem with layering for a month or 2 can some1 in full detail explain how layering will ruin classic wow completely, i think i must be missing the big picture as i dont beleive layering will have effect 12months after lanuch im not arguing here i just want to fully understand the other sides opinion if possible please
---
did u see AV/durotar?  the sun is going supernova so ofc night is bright too
---
I don't think the issue is that it will flood the economy so much as that it will concentrate wealth
---
Is this true?? That would be amazing
---
you havent thought hard enough about how layering will be abused.  probably because you lack critical thinking skills.
---
Definitely agree with that last point. I realised no matter how bad layering is I WILL be playing the game - instead of getting whiny about it i’ll just abuse the mechanics and make everyone see why its bad :P 
---
At this point I’m coming to Classic, i’d just hate to see irreparable damage to the game in the name of a smooth launch. 
---
At the end of the day we are all loosely looking for the same thing, an enjoyable classic experience.
---
I see it more that his role as game director is somewhat limited by corporate oversight. Of all the things that have been criticised over the years in WoW, raids are not high up on that list. It's still gotta sting to see so many people vigorously demand the old version of the game you've been working for literally years, regardless of how responsible you are for what people are directing their complaints towards.
---
Leeway existed in Vanilla so...
---
Adversity unites
---
Yes. We play retail in EU. Where you join a random pug and 80% of the time you don't understand them because they either speak russian, french or german. Classic will be much worse because people will be confined to their servers.
---
It was very dark in the alpha of wow, but outside that it was never very dark. Maybe your old computer had different video settings so it seemed darker to you
---
Unfortunately I did
---
My bad dude, meant to respond to the guy you responded to. Saying layering wasn't a core thing means it shouldn't be here now is lunacy.
---
Why can’t we just pick up quests along the way and do them?
---
Have my +1 before we both get yeeted out of this sub
---
My layer was a ghost town too. Hopefully that amount of layering was just a test.
---
No worries
---
I’m going to save this and come back to it at launch. I don’t think this goes against “the spirit of classic.”  But I do think you shot yourself in the foot by calling it LFG. People see that and you lose them right away. I’ll still be checking it out, but maybe consider a name change even if it is a “looking for group” tool.
---
If 80% of them you can't understand anyway, there really isn't a "much worse", is there?
---
For sure, get him banned bro
---
thanks for making the point and agreeing with methat blizzard goes back on their word constantly, have little credibility on these subjects, and that any intelligent person would not trust their public statements.  glad were all on the same page here.
---
Nah that’s where the real shitposting is
---
I'd rather watch anime on one screen, while me and my paladin mate, with our long golden hair stand over your crusty undead corpse wearing tramp armour, RP high fiving each other. Knowing full well you are raging on the other side that your leet edge lordness doesn't help you against us weebs that play unhealthy amounts :p
---
Give it a few days after release. Someone will have ported the addons from retail.
---
Danish is so dumb and weird. And when we are playing a game with English terms it just feels weird. I play DnD with my ol' highschool buddies and it's weird when we got things like mimics and Beholders which could easily be translated into Danish sprinkled in with the Danish words for dragons, elves and whatever else. It gets especially weird with dragonborn not being translated but dragon is.
---
Amen brother, we all want that.  Hopefully they can think of solutions to the exploits so we can all be happy.
---
Yeees. I played from when I got home after work until the sun came up and it felt like the time flew by. I didn't even hit lvl 10 in that time, but grouped up with people along the way the entire time. I'm more excited about Classic now than previously.
---
Well in eastern EU we also pay 15/month which is much higher compared to salary, because we earn way less than in west and we never had a chance to have national servers. 
---
So if you want to solve your problem then there should be like 20 national servers.
---
It's just too bad my initial server went down after 20 minutes. Best chance to simulate launch day conditions. I still got some valuable practice runs. I'll see everybody next stress test
---
I played vanilla on australian internet in 05 so youll be right in 2019
---
People keep posting this. Blizzard already said Layering is only going to be there the first few weeks of the game launch until it settles.
---
Blue reply just now:
---
&gt;Hi All,

ye thats exactly the reason I want certain language specific realms like French, Spanish, Italian and possibly German tho germans shouldnt need it...

&gt;Layering DOES NOT address overcrowding
---
What?  People are asking for no layering, which will make starting zones more overcrowded.

What’s wrong with streamers? I’ve never really had a problem with them.(just asking)

So obviously the sky is falling, LaYeRiNg BaD!!

Mods, something has happened to the subreddit style in the past couple weeks. Using subreddit style is causing 99% CPU usage in firefox and eventually crashing. Only happens on this sub with style enabled. Disabling the style lets it run as normal.
---
&gt; -Layering (done properly with exploits and bugs fixed), with the amount of servers they feel will be needed long term
---
&gt; -Create more servers for the anticipated large mass at release then merge servers together down the line
---
&gt; -Only have the amount of servers they believe will be needed long term but increase spawn rates by a LARGE factor and basically have mobs almost auto spawning to deal with the mass
---
&gt; -Only have the amount of servers they believe will be needed long term and do literally nothing else and let 60 people fight over one mob spawn at time.
---
I like this option personally.
---
Hi, /u/Momodormu

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c3ic2n/end_of_the_stress_test_with_asmongold/). 
---
Yes, just slightly
---
As far as I can tell, it really hurts PvP (ganking mostly). If someone is really into that then I can see how they would greatly dislike layers.
---
The caps all being 5k would suggest that they'd all end up roughly the same.
---
You seem to be confused, it's planned that A,B,C &amp; D have the possibility to merge if need be. Obviously they can be merged any which way. This method is not subject to ballparking in any way, which is the beauty of it. Other than in the extremely unlikely event that all four together only amount to a single low population server, they would inevitably be of healthy sizes.
---
Blue post about this was just put on the forums.
---
"Hi All,
---
Thanks all!"
---
I have nothing against alliance butt buddies. I was a weeb who played female nelf though, and I cringe at the thought of going back to that.
---
They aren't the same, you're right. But Europe's regional server serves 400+ million. It makes it difficult to compared to a region with less than 10% that population. 
---
Whether ping or language, it doesn't matter, the servers cost the same for blizzard to run. Therefore the only metric that matters is cost-to-benefit. If you don't speak English in Europe your enjoyment of the game will plummet (we all go on about the social aspect of classic), you will feel disconnected from groups, from zone chats, BGs, and even guilds if you can't find a language specific one. These are all detrimental to enjoyment, as seen by the player response. Blizzard has determined (so far) that that detriment does not warrant a server for each language (German having the largest speaker base in Europe, though also the most likely to speak Engish).
---
Now the same analysis holds for a regional server. Oceanic players can, and did for six years, connect to the US server group. We are still being serviced (as Blizzard can argue all Europeans are with non-language specific servers). If Blizzard thinks that a feature classic had (language servers) is not worthwhile for their expected player base (of which German has 120 million), how can they think that 30 million warrants any extra costs on their end at all. The only possibility is that they think reduced ping with equate to more people playing (and therefore paying). There is no other reason, region, language, it's all the same. Will more people play with X cost invested. That's it. 
---
If the isolating factor of not speaking a language isn't seen as enough of a detriment to their expected player count to warrant the cost of a server, then 200 ping isn't likely to be either.
---
That option sounds like more of a critique on layering than something else. And that’s what we should be striving for, layering done properly so that it’s not a useable and doesn’t act like phasing.
---
Okay so there are 37 german servers. That means there should be at least 3 swedish servers, 3 hungarian servers, 20 polish servers etc. I don't understand your point.
---
I didn't say anything of the sort.
---
So out of curiosity, I went to Google Translate and started putting in various fantasy world type words, such as Dragon, Witch, Wizard, Dragonborn, Pyroblast, etc.
---
Should I not be at all surprised that over half of them returned the exact same word in English and Danish?
---
I made a /wave macro for the stress test. Am I doing it right?
---
The other person said it well. Blizzards silence is the only thing to go off of and given there track record I find it cause for concern .
---
I really gate layering. It goes against everything classic is. I rather be stuck in a zerg for days than experience and sharding. I rather wait 2-3k queues and so on. I dont know how private servers can hold 13k people online on launch days without any server issues and disconnects, but Blizzard cant? Bullshit.
---

As this post suggests, they've already started working on the issue and seem to have a fix for it.
---
Literally the only issue you will encounter is that you need to be mindful of other devices. Always shut off wifi on devices you're not using. They will make you lag when they decide it's time for an update of something random.
---
Also pretty sure every major video of layering being an issue has come from a streamer. I haven't seen one streamer who has been pro layering.
---
the people farming high lvl mats from months 2-12 still won't have farmed more than the people who farmed those mats in month 0-2.  economic ruin.
---
/console ffxglow 0      try this
---
Honestly, stuff like this doesn’t bother me that much, as long as layering isn’t around for more than 2 weeks at most. While it’s annoying that somebody can skip out on a gank, in phase 1 it isn’t *that* big of a deal. It sucks, but it won’t have long term effects. 
---
What concerns me about layering is if it applies to all levels and people use it to farm up things like Black Lotus or switch layers to get a huge amount of Devilsaur farming done. Things like that which have a long term effect on the server and economy. 
---
I personally think layering is a necessary evil to try and ensure long term success for the servers, but it has to be done in an extremely limited way. I’d prefer only 1 week, 2 weeks maximum, and limiting it to the starter zones and the zone right after that (Barrens, Westfall, etc). For that week. Any contested zone that traditionally includes PvP as a natural experience (Hillsbrad, STV) shouldn’t have layering. In the Barrens, for example, where PvP is much more rare, I think layering is fine for a limited time.
---
Awesome! Keep these coming, they're amazing!
---
Give into your darkside, embrace the female nelf for their glorious models and animations. Or are you not comfortable enough with your sexuality?
---
Check out the Gnome / Dwarf tab in the google sheet above.
---
It's not as fleshed out as the human route, but the baseic route is the same from 5 onwards, (aside from the changes I've made recently.)
---
Feel free to make a copy for yourself, add the stuff from the human route to the Gnorf one, and it should work out for ya.
---
So enable dynamic spawns and let the population spread naturally.
---
you know the occasional pvp is fun and all, but being camped with no end is still annoying, even if there are other benefits to it it's not like you can't be mad in that situation. If you kill someone you are happy, if you get camped you are annoyed. thats normal, we are not robots.
---
Not all heroes wear cloaks.
---
I think it should be throughout the entire game, to better support a larger server population.
---
There are only so many herbs, mineral nodes, out there.  Black Lotus spawns are extremely key to progression raiding and tend to be a horded resource.
---
What is it like 5 zones spawn a black lotus, they spawn one per hour.  In a given day that means there are only 120 black lotuses to be picked.  That means only 120 people can flask a day.
---
To prevent this hording of resources where players live by alarms on their phone to log on and do a run to collect herbs that they know respawn every hour.  Dynamic Respawns prevent this, as the timers may change as players enter and leave a zone.
---
And it should be set up with a logarithmic scale so there is a min respawn time.
---
I fear that once layering is turned off, there are going to be more people than resources situation.  The cost of resources will skyrocket.  Casual players with either quit, or complain how they miss layering.  Once these players leave it will cause the server to die.

Well I mean the spawns are longer than a pserver also no guarantee there will be 3+ layers to shift between. Or that he’ll always shift into one with it up. Could just shift back and forth between 2 layers for an hour trying to camp the one spawn....

---
I’d rather have people being over dramatic or freaking out about layering and leeway than pretending it isn’t an issue, atleast this way it’s getting a signal boost and bliz might take notice and change things.
---
Looks like they are looking to claim 1 server of each type even though Blizz said in their Realm Structure post that there will be 'several' realms in total. If the French do the same... yeah there won't be enough servers to pull this off.
---
We just need more servers/ server options. Obviously people would prefer to have a small server that meets their needs than a large server that is a clusterfuck.
---
I'm not going to resub to play Classic unless layering is gone.

You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about, holy crap

Yes, but I wouldn’t be surprised if a bunch of them go on non-PVP servers to prevent being griefed.

That rep grind will be super easy to get on 8 people when you can abuse layers
---
Search tool.  People don't use it.  Think that CTRL + F first page will produce results omg someone isn't talking about layering how crud let me post my oh so original thoughts so everyone knows how bad it is and will ruin the game Classic DOA
---
That's what I thought
---
I think blizzard should have a talk with bobby b?
---
Yeah I know. I was just teasing. its a heated debate!
---
I kind of disagree on this one. Reddit tends to downvote things they disagree with to oblivion, hiding it, and all but removing it from the discussion completely. 
---
Where as with WoW forums, you can still see the messages, even if someone disagrees with it. But you can see the likes, showing that many people agree with it. 
---
Reddit's upvote and downvote system works pretty well, but depending on which Subreddit you're on, it can be abused pretty heavily.
---
I do not once remember seeing this.
---
It just sounds better to order two cervezas and not two thervethas is all! 
---
But yeah some are saying French is best of all three, which I just don't see. I speak French fluently myself and find it below both Spanish and Italian. Must just be a matter of perspective and what you see as foreign and exotic.
---
Blizzard as of late has not given themselves enough credibility for people to believe those vague comments.
---
I disagree there are plety of hype, at least in my circle and places on the internaet I wisit, but I will roll on Eu servers due to ru community is not known for being... overly wholesome, let's put it this way
---
ROFLMAO
---
I've already made up my mind, unless they remove layering and fix these bugs with the hunter class I won't resub to play Classic.
---
&gt; Exactly, sometimes you have a piece of loot with your worst stats from doing some random shit
---
As opposed to 99% of gear having Spirit on it before T2 when most classes have no use for it in raiding.
---
It amazes me how you can argue something and then completely disregard systems in Classic that are the exact same. Like how if 8/8 T1 is your best possible gear to wear until 8/8 T2 (see: Hunter) you legitimately are not replacing **any** gear until you over the course of many months finally get 8 pieces of tier gear.
---
Because THAT system is more rewarding, right? Getting to watch everyone else gear up but you are stuck in last tiers gear because Classic itemization was terrible.
---
I dunno, maybe you dont have a solid grasp of the raid mechanics yet.  
---
Me being swedish and having raided in a Czech/Slovak only guild on a private server I feel like I have some valuable input, before raiding with them i pretty much only knew one word in czech, kurva.  
---
After 2-3 months I had learend basic phrases and a few more words.   
---
But even after just 1 day of raiding in a teamspeak with 24 other people who dont speak any english at all (cz/sk are pretty bad at english usually, some are decent and some completely refuse to talk or learn it similar to french) I could still raid with them without any problems because I was able to basically understand a completely foreign language as long as what they were talking about was WoW or Raiding relevant.  
---
So even if you have trouble understanding english when people are speaking to you, which is understandable, you still should be able to understand what your name + keywords like Kite, Dispel, Kick, Heal, DPS, interrupt, curse w/e mean
---
Because mob spawns aren't the only problem they want to solve and 500x more people are going to play classic launch than a private server? I dunno just spitballing here.
---
oh look, us education here... not everyone speaks english you dipshit... current retail has servers that are classified as "czech" because 99% people there talk in czech language, can you imagine that someone spends days leveling just to find out the server was take  by germans and he has to reroll because he cannot speak german?
---
I agree. I just remember certain runs people were picky. I was always very picky doing my Strat and Scholo runs to maximize my gear back then.
---
Na, you just don’t understand how these small changes can ruin the game because you clearly don’t have private server experience. 
---
The issue with layering is it’s not full proof at all and the problems causes are just going to undermine the experience. Blizzard are worried that a launch with loads of people competing for mobs is going to turn off new players but it’s actually a very unique experience that we only
---
get on a new server. It’s actually incredible, promotes even more grouping and social interaction and ensures people make loads of friends right from the start.
---
When you do things like layering, you stop seeing the same people as you level up, you get a false version of the game because even when people hit 60 and layering gets turned off (hopefully) these problems you all about hating are still going to be there (60s grinding mobs you want to kill for quests, yanking you when you’re in level 50s for honour) etc. and you just want to play the game right?
---
This is an MMO and it’s meant to be Classic WoW, not a simulation of classic with modern QOL features to make it a smooth introduction for everyone. I welcome the chaos of a real server launch but unfortunately there’s people like yourself who clearly just want it to be be a fair, simple experience and it worries me because if they listen to these people they’ll make bad moves going forward.
---
An example is on a private server where they added an auto que to battlegrounds from anyway that everyone wanted. It ended up destroying the server because of the repercussions that came with it people didn’t see. You’ll probably say that’s not the same with layering, but you just don’t know that.
---
Type " how do I update bnet " into Google...
---
I've been learning to speak German for a few years and would like to make an alt on a Deutsch server to practice my second language. Won't get that chance if we don't have language specific servers.
---
Get out of here with your logical and reasonable requests.
---
&gt; The private server experience is a prime example of why English-only servers fail.
---
English server are fine in retail. So you say if blizzard let the germans and french and spansih people into english realms, then they will bring xenophobia to the English realms?
---
Backdoor layering post.  Get outta here
---
This community brought me from not caring about streamers to strongly disliking. Im tired of seeing stupid ass content from him and the other fuckaroundgang. It's not entertaining, he's not funny, they are dudes that play games. Nothing special about them, and their cult following is absolutely ridiculous. They even got you guys doing free advertisement
---
I thought this would make picking my main easier...
---
Ah. I don’t watch streamers or anything so I’m not really familiar with their nuances. It looked (to me) like he was (badly) feigning ignorance to the group inv and that he wasn’t aware of -exactly-  what was going to happen (ie. being shifted to a dead layer to survive)
---
Unintended use of game mechanics to trivialize the game.
---
Just how many fucking servers do you think they're going to make for EU?  English, German, Czech?  French?  Polish?  Greek?  Ok, now they need three of each of those, so that they can have PVP, PVE and RP?  
---
Looks dope!
---
oh no someone is richer than you.
---
if you dont talk 99% time, viewers will get bored and leave
---
I did this a lot in Vanilla with my alts and people who wanted to get some levels quick. 
---
Took about a week playing 5 hours a day or there about to get from 1-high 50 almost 60. I would also do quests with them, my alt got the quest and my main just aoe killed everything so turn ins took a couple minutes. The 2 combined sped up the leveling a lot.
---
Spanish is Italian but when you are horny
---
you said people will believe whatever they want to believe, regardless of any statements blizzard might make.  thats absolutely correct, and thats exactly what people should do - given their track record on keeping their word.
---
Well it's pretty easy to dismiss spells because until casters get spell power gear their abilities just do what they say on the tin.
---
There's no AP coefficient equivalent for casters until essentially late game.
---
We should always be testing, but I really do think a huge part of this is private servers being overtuned and players basing their experience in comparison to that.
---
I learned english because of wow, and that was 14 years ago , would be insane to have oldschool vanilla players who still cant speak english xD honestly just ban language specific client...  
---
Having an english client forces you to learn the language to even play it.
---
You know that phasing and layering are basically the same techniques? It will only be enabled on the first weeks, because of the huge population that just wants to take a look. The best way to deal with that is with layering/sharding/phasing.
---
You can't setup like 20000 servers just so all players have a place with to start and then scrap 3/4 of them..
---
Remember the first weeks of the real vanilla? It was a shitfest of queues, running around with nothing to do, because you couldn't finish thatone quest half the world population tried to do.
---
Layering is far from perfect and needs some tuning, but it's the only real option everyone can actually enjoy the launch and not biting the desk because the server crashed again
---
Ill take any of the options that don't completely ruin the community of a server. So layering is out.
---
Yeah, spellstone is pretty amazing. I could use Basilisk Bone as an offhand, too
---
Its has always been DM for deadmines.
---
Dire Maul wasn't relesed yet in early vanilla, true OGs used DM for deadmines, and Maul for Dire Maul
---
If you use VC unironically you are a zoomer who needs to head back to retail
---
But thats not a game breaking problem in anyway if anythink it would just show how small minded one could be, im looking for the reason every1 thinks will ruin the game completely not for a week or 2 but for the entirety of classics lifetime
---
if people want them, why do you have issues with that?

Defias story line is so epic... those first human zones are so immersive and well put together. You can feel the care and attention the dev team put in.

you did not mention if you are us or eu... so I assume you are us
---
u/MightyMorp was being sarcastic.
---
TLDR: it is causing your yellow attacks to scale better with attack power than they should.
---
For the long version...
---
In vanilla wow, 14 attack power adds 1 dps to any weapon.  For example, if you have an axe with a 3.6 attack speed, then 14 attack power adds an average of 3.6 damage per hit with that axe.
---
In early vanilla, this caused balance problems with instant yellow attack / abilities.  A rogue with a 2.0 speed dagger would get an extra 4 base damage (per 14 AP) to their backstab etc, before the ability multipliers.  This caused slower weapons to be so much stronger than faster ones that people would use much lower ilevel slow weapons, rather than better but faster weapons.
---
In one of the earlier vanilla patches, Blizzard decided to address this by adding Attack Power Normalization.  The effect of this was that all daggers used the same speed when calculating yellow damage added by attack power.  The other weapon categories were one handed (non-dagger), two handed and ranged.
---
With this new system in place, a weapon with the highest average damage per hit now did the most damage with yellow attacks, as they all scaled equally with attack power.  The result was that slower weapons were usually still better for yellow damage, but it was not such an extreme difference.
---
In later expansions, Blizzard changed Attack Power Normalization to use a slower weapon speed in each category.  This caused all yellow attacks to scale better with attack power.
---
as seen in Gears of War 4 as well - https://www.artstation.com/artwork/E16Vn
---
yep, just not smart to do it that way as you'll outlevel the loch modan quests. so you finish all of westfall by 15.. then what
---
Yea sorry, forgot to add it: US
---
Yeah I don't understand either. I learned English in the beginning because of WoW. If someone refuses to learn the language of Europe and USA, then he/she should find another hobby. Blizzard can't make 20 different servers with 20 different languages.
---
Just because some nations got their national servers it does not mean it was fair for the other 20. So either blizzard give 20 national servers or everyone should learn English and play together.
---
Is this the same one where he accepted an invite, but didn't change layers?
---
He literally did not abuse layering to avoid world PVP.
---
He did not change layers.
---
The same guy killed him a minute later.
---
So you're saying... to abuse layering, you accept an invite, and then don't leave your layer, and get killed by the same guy in WPVP, to ... avoid WPVP?
---
I'm totally fine with that, although from a historic standpoint, it's not logical. There were no official swedish or Hungarian servers while there were many German and french servers. I remember classic this way, with a fully German community. It would be an unexpected surprise if there were swedish servers. But it is expected that there are German servers, because it was this way in vanilla.
---
&gt; if you can't wait 20 minutes to group together then you really aren't apart of the classic crowd in a real sense anyways.
---
Oh, stop. This is just nonsense.
---
Can confirm. Played hemo all of 2006. You needed a slow weapon to make it work.
---
1. It does have sharding, which we've now seen is effectively the same thing.
---
2. Blizz did server merges in the form of pvp battlegroups in classic. They also did full-on server merges several times throughout the expansions. As WoW isn't currently dead in classic or retail form, I'm not sure what you mean.
---
I’m not affected by it, I live in the US. That doesn’t mean I can’t recognize that this is a stupid decision on Blizzards part, made for the sole reason that they expect Classic to be so small that 6 servers EU is too many.
---
No - theoretically if layering didn’t exist Blizzard would be forced to create more standalone servers and merge them later, so the net crowding in starting areas would likely be the same. Layering was specifically created to avoid the future need for server merges, and that is what it aims to solve, not overcrowding which would happen either way.
---
Sharding puts a hard, small cap on players localized in a specific area (Westfall for example) and spawns as many copies as needed to prevent overcrowding. 
---
Layering occurs on the scale of a whole continent, and has a cap in the thousands equivalent to an entire vanilla realm. On launch day, the population of each layer will be concentrated in the starting areas. 
---
Blizzard has stayed their concern that this technology addresses are standalone realms with a hard cap who are overcrowded on launch day but empty out over months, forcing server merges. They view layering as a superior option but his tech has many implications for Classic gameplay. But, just to be clear, in either case you will be competing with thousands of other players at launch.
---
I always thought the follow up to Naxx was going to be Karazhan, since the staff of Ateish teleports players to Kara. And then Kara would have been used to unlock the Black Morass so that players could open the Dark Portal.   I think someone made a video about a year ago of what they thought 1.13 would have been like if TBC never came out.  He mapped out the entire scenario of what that progression would have been.   I really hope for an alternative warcraft universe that doesn't do the TBC expac route but proceeds into 1.13.     I  would love to see Northern Plaguelands and a vanilla Mt Hyjal.  I also always hated Silvermoon being on a TBC server, and thus having a loading screen.
---
Broken link
---
so since they release the shittier version of AV, the eu players deserve messed servers? I'll just play on US servers and be done with it, cba with non-english general chat    
---
OT: I also want old AV, but ye
---
I dont mind being a healer. I actually wanna play healer. But i want to be able to kill ppl in pvp.
---
Oh my god, if they can't even get this right it does not bode well for launch...
---
ha ha yeah i guess it doesn't matter if any skills you do are worth dirt cheap after all this is just a raiding game the only thing that matters is MC and getting BIS nobody cares about professions
---
You can really see this when you fly into or walk into Stormwind City. Next time you enter Stormwind, notice the Cathedral; how big and noticeable it is. Once your griffin lands, or you walk into the trade district the cathedral is now more distant and not as big. You entered the instanced version of the city.
---
&gt; Just because he is a streamer and literally said he shouldn't be able to do it, means people have to single him out? 
---
But the crazy thing? He literally did not abuse layering to avoid WPVP.
---
He stayed on the same layer, and was killed by the same guy a minute later.
---
Literally nothing happened here.
---
They will just change layers after the first time they get ganked...
---
Because there is literally nothing that would indicate that is the case. They left themselves open to leave it until phase 2 which could be months. Also I do not see any scenario where the larger servers have lost enough players to no longer facilitate layers "shortly after the game launches"
---
You are implying they are going to keep layering on for the entire phasing stage when they already said it would be for launch to help with congestion, so farming for months exploiting the layers cant actually happen
---
I look forward to play with scandinavians... Best raiders I ever met
---
Oh you mean the retail addons that are a whole version ahead on the api? The same api they claimed they would lock down to help keep an authentic classic experience? Are those the addons you mean?
---
Because the population will not dramatically decrease enough within phase 1 to remove layering. Populations will still be high on *most* servers, and layering will continue to exist out of *necessity* past phase 1. 
---
Sure, some servers will be low enough population to remove layering, but there will be many, many servers where they just can't do it.
---
Personally as somebody from Aus playing on the pservers. Ping ping ping, if there was a way to one day solve the high ping issues global servers would be amazing at least imo.
---
Hmm, it works fine for me.
