Some people who want RPPvP will roll on a RP server and just flag themselves, others will roll on a PvP. It’s a slap in the face if it’s not included at launch.
---
Designating one lets everyone who wants to RPPvP know where to go. Otherwise you have to search out how and where to go. Since people have already put a plan in motion to roll on a PvP server if we don’t get one, I’m going to assume you aren’t aware of that plan. Which just highlights the issue. You want to RPPvP but aren’t aware that people who also want to are already planning on rolling on a PvP server if we don’t get a RPPvP server. If we got a RPPvP server it wouldn’t matter now, would it?

Wow, being an OSRS to Classic WoW Player is like being me at 12 when I did the same thing. 
---
I love that this is happening.
---
I'm not sure they were. Is there any source for that? I'd have thought the majority demographic would have been 15-23 or so.
---
This is what most tryhard warrs use as their statweights, and is generally correct, just missing notcapped hit =23ap or so.
---
WOTLK was the most subbed expansion.
---
I think going LW+herb or mining will be better, but it would take more effort. 
---
With all these dirt cheap skins, and people needing gear, I think there is much more than 20g to be made 1-40 with some casual LWing. Really would not take much time either.
---
I'm struggling to find answers to this as well, Seraphynas. I didn't get in on the Beta, but got in on a private server to practice and get my chops back in prep for classic. The answer to this question would likely change whether or not I looking to main heal as Priest or Pally.
---
Dude. I practiced Ultimate Bahamut. For *WEEKS* straight. I know exactly what you're saying. Every single fight in FF14 is a script. It's not RNG. It's not chance.
---
When the world-first crews don't even bother trying to 'LEARN' the fights, all they do is write a fucking LITERAL graph of 0 seconds into fight - 12 minutes into fight, second by second, showing what move happens, how much it hits for, and where to stand?
---
It drains the fun completely out. And that's how the world first runners did... Alexander savage. It was ridiculous. They just cleared 20 seconds in, wiped, then 22 seconds in, wiped, then kept going until they reached the end. It wasn't skill. It was just blind wiping to marker down the encounter.
---
I feel your pain!
---
You can tank most 60 dungeons. Not as well as warriors, but there are moments in which a paladin tank will have an edge. Personally I'm definitely put off by paladin tanks. They're not as good at holding aggro on single targets and they don't have a taunt. So once you pull aggro from a paladin tank you're kinda fucked. Mana is also not the best resource for a tank. It's much nicer to have a warrior that can continuously generate more rage to get more threat.
---
If you want to play the game as a paladin tank you can. But only dungeons and you'll be worse than warriors.
---

---
 Gonna GM a casual ish guild. We have started recruiting :)
---
Yeah I'm very glad I found a guild with realistic goals (get to 60 by november but no worries if you dont)
---
IIRC heavy and medium hides would be worth holding onto for sure.
---
You guys are just straight up wrong. The stun lasts less than 2 seconds, is resistance, and barely allows for any space or a cast to go off. You can barely get 12 yards space with in that time due to the animation cutting into the stun duration by .2 seconds meaning the stun lasts for 1.7-1.8 seconds, not giving enough time to cast LHW, let alone a GHW, let alone get any sort of distance between the target.
---
Nagrand
---
Hahahaha ty ty you account for the 5% of the ppl who commented that actually saw that this was all a joke. Lol
---
I'm the only one that can help myself.
---
You don't think it has to be adjusted since everyone has much better internet now? I mean the whole point of it was because people had lag.
---
I know some zones would need to retain flying or perhaps even better, could be altered to not need flying or have a mount up zone or some other solution. Flying is great convenience, but its breaks the world.
---
[yep](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/604177390377369600/604179930506592273/1558450992945.png)
---
I mean if you start with a 5 box and grind them up to 60
---
then you can multibox and powerlevel alts to lvl 35
---
with your 5 accounts you can get up to 45 alts with tailoring/alchemy for an insane amount of passive income.
---
Play hardcore for a month and set this up and you will never farm gold again.
---
like 90% of why I am going to multibox in classic is to get ahead and for the reeeeeeeeees.  almost no travel time as ill just sit in like 6 dungeons from 13-60, free food from the mage, summons from the warlock, and best of all I wont have to compete with anyone at spawns for quests.
---
Paladins tank dungeons fine you just have to drink a lot.  As soon as you get concentration you can go ham.
---
That 2k UI over 15 year old textures on a 32" curved monitor lol
---
Not going to know a Rogue is coming in that arena.
---
Blizzard doesn't have trust issues here.
---
(Activisin)Blizzard has a monetization issue. No matter how succesful Classic will be - they can monetize Retail way more and they do.
---
They don't want Classic to be too succesful, they want it to be just succesful enough to get some people to stay subbed through Retails frequent content draughts and open up a direct advertisement line to customers who otherwise would not give them the time of day.
---
Classic is not a product for AB, it is a marketing tool.
---
Price?
---
Raids start at 5pm sharp. That doesn't mean you log on and start getting ready to raid.  You log on at 430 be ready to pull at 5.  If you can't do this 95% of the time, find a new guild.  My guild are adults and we have schedules. This game is no different. Respect your guildmates and their time.
---
DKP is mandatory.  I've been playing MMOs for about 21 years now. I've been in countless guilds. No guild I've ever seen that runs a loot council survives. Transparent DKP is the most fair way with a couple exceptions. The main tank and healer get their gear first. After that all DKP. 
---
The very best guilds I've ever been in foster a teamwork mentality. If I join a guild and see people putting rare items on the AH and not offering it to guildies, I gquit.  I give you a rare item, someone gives me a rare item etc. It all goes around. As soon as I hear, "but I want to sell it for ME", if I'm just a guildie and this is the vibe of the guild I'm out.  If I'm in a leadership position, that person is out. ONE team, one fight.
---
Make an offer
---
They're not optimal so many people get all upset about that, but you can tank most things (you'll be an off tank in raids at most) if you're in a group of people that know how to work with you. Last guild I was in had multiple paladin tanks and they tanked some raid bosses (ZG, BWL, MC stuff) just fine, so I'm not just talking out of my ass here. Obviously they won't be able to tank something that requires a taunt, unless you're able to find some clever workaround.
---
Oh, you'll probably want like 20 stacks of water from the mages.
---
does kidney shot count as a debuff? cuz that
---
How about a sticky or an announcement on this reddit?
---
&gt; Keep in mind 20g in Vanilla is a lot of money.
---
no it's not lol
---
even while leveling
---
I hate faerie fire even more. I can stealth for everyone except the hunter with mark, but those little dancing lights over my head make me totally useless.
---
I got $25 on Steam Wallet I will give
---
It was definitely the threat changes that did it. You put vanilla threat mechanics in the ICC 5 mans and you won't have people running and gunning them.
---
Nothings worse than riding along and a stealthed mob attacks,discounts, and dazes you
---
Daze dismount
---
Even in the US if you’re military.
---
red bulls and doritos, are you me?
---
It's a super effective way to ensure the guild always has consumables and it builds relationships so people play better together. If you don't see any value in this, then team oriented games may not be for you.
---
[There is an add-on for newbs](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/azeroth-auto-pilot-classic)

But you mentioned warriors rolling on felstriker is even worse, and it makes no sense. Felstriker is good for warriors, arguably better than on rogues.

From what I hear they have no plans to nerf DM tribute runs either which is gonna make some people very rich.
---
IIRC ubrs last boss requires tank switching, i.e. taunting, so count that one out. The 5 mans should all be somewhat manageable.
---
Basically any boss with aggro drop mechanic will be a problem.

Yeah I have a pretty solid understanding I’d be healing raids. I’m not even sure I’ll have the time to raid on a schedule, so the fact that healers can fill an empty spot here and there works in my favour. 
---
The water thing kills me. The idea of Tanking BRD for hours... all the water I’ll need... *shudders*
---
5 vehicles and you bike to work?
---
ya but Football doesn't start til the 2nd week of Sept!
---
Yeah me too! 
---
I mean not the walk part I hate walking but I plan to gym each morning before starting my gaming sessions.
---
To be fair it was such a % value item if they never nerfed it i fully expect it to never have stopped being used, even in bfa.
---
I assume thats actually Daze which normally has a red border because Concussive Shot isnt that big of deal unless it stuns you.
---
The only annoying thing I find about Concussive Shot is Hunters who hit you with it while youre mounted and youre running by. It frustrates me as someone who plays Hunter a lot to see someone just dump a Concussive Shot on you for no reason, when theyre clearly going to just keep running and that 3s of slow is barely going to do anything when you have nothing to follow it up with and youve now put yourself in combat so you cant mount and actually pursue them. Just kind of makes me face palm
---
Orc is nice for the passive but I think people overlook using Free Action Potions for PvP. As horde only alliance priests can offensively dispel on top of their other duties. War stomp is also great so I would argue preference plays a larger roll. If you aren't in a premade those priests will like be shadow for WPvP and bgs or focused on surviving with zero reliable peels.
---
Yes you can only Fap 1/4 of the time but considering combat down time it's a pretty covered base. Unless you prefer to have access to restorative potions or Laps vs melee instead.
---
this comment triggered my disarm ptsd
---
I was just trying to help the OP reword his post to be a little less cringe, but it clearly came across how he intended. 
---
None of this has anything to do with people having power or control over other people, or being superior or inferior. I honestly think you should look into talk to someone about the authority complex you may have built up. Don’t worry, talking about your feelings to others doesn’t make you weak, it makes you a real human person.
---
Oh god yes.  If I wanted politics I would do literally anything else than play video games.
---
you got downvoted but it's undeniably true for the informed enthusiasts who frequent this sub. dunno why people refuse to admit it.
---
Which phase? If its 1-2 the sl lock won't do well vs dps + healer and the shadow won't be too good either vs heals.
---
Wait what?! I didn’t know that was a thing. Private servers have spoiled me.. :(
---
\*scribbles notes for potential gank spot\*
---
This wouldnt be a horrid idea if they had a trial only server.  Just to let them see the solo content and group content if they can find it.  Would eliminate the gold selling issues.
---
Just click its proven to be better
---
Warrior -&gt; Mage -&gt; Rogue -&gt; Priest
---
Toss up between Rogue and Priest currently for me, leaning more towards Rogue as my main and Priest as my alt.
---
You can’t maintain shock Ana efficiency as it doesn’t exist. Oxymoron.
---
You can last the fight if you’re speed clearing and bossies die between 30-90 seconds after pull. You’ll do middle pack with luck and bottom end without.
---
Yes but then you have to leave your chair to answer the door when you could just toss back a Soylent and be done with the food thing for 5 hours in about 30 seconds.
---
Community was and always will be the best thing about classic.
---
the reddit community are informed more than people where back in 2004. people know warrior is the most OP class and horde have the best racials for a pvp server. the stats reflect the game balance of vanilla
---

---
Average age was 28.
---
No? Lol. It shows that a Hunters deadzone is much easier to exploit now because players are far, far better. Hunters are still solid, but won't be nearly as strong as they were in actual Vanilla. Most people were too busy clicking to even think about deadzone kiting a hunter, while casting abilities.
---
They are not *so* difficult but when compared with other classes who have: passive/active movement increasing abilities, heals, escape mechanics, ranged abilities, pets, effective CC, etc., they are without question harder or at the very least slower and less effective.
---
I offered valid reasons why it's a great idea and offered you a viable alternative based on your responses. You feel attacked so maybe you're projecting.
---
I once stumbled upon some Goldshire Inn cybersexers emoting filthy things at each other. I proceeded to /lol until they left the inn, but I wasn’t done. Being a rogue, I stealthily followed them to the secluded alchemist’s hut in Elwynn where they proceeded to absolutely go to town on each other in /say and /emote. I was laughing so much in guild chat that my buddies formed a raid and came to check things out. Everyone was very good about creeping up without being seen, so these two have no clue that they’re getting down and dirty with a 20+ person audience directly outside. One dwarf arrives late to the party and stands right in the doorway, so the jig is up. They run outside to discover a raid group laughing uproariously and quoting their more hilarious moments in vivid detail. I’ve never laughed so hard at a video game.
---
I wouldn't say drastically. Maybe you place a few more flight paths and make the areas that are inaccessible without flying accessible. That's maybe 2-4 spots per zone.
---
Standing up to friends is hard sometimes, but it needs to be done. Once you know what you want to do, make it crystal clear that you playing your own way is fine. If they are actually friends, they will understand. 
---
If they aren't really your friends, consider ditching them, or at least spending less time with them.
---
&gt; the more leather will be on the market
---
Demand will spike 3-4 months after launch when most of the people start hitting 60 driving up the prices.
---
I am going to be such a filthy casual compared to when i use to play I am looking forward to a 6 month grind to level 60 since i may get 3-5hrs a week max. I am looking forward to dugeons being my end game and having a few alts because i wana enjoy the other classes. I am looking forward to feeling like im 9 again. I don't care about raids or min maxing just enjoying a game a grew up with again.
---
Only plus is the thinking back on the good times while we grind our lives away.
---
If you're in this sub, you *probably* aren't casual.
---
I see you're a man of culture as well.
---
mc easily taked 2hrs alone just because you cant mount in there.
---
then you have to get to ony which also eats another 20min easily.
---
and bwl is another 2hrs

There are tons of guides, joana's being the most well known, just do some googling.
---
&gt;C'thun was mathematically unbeatable before the first nerfs
---
This is one of the biggest and widest spread false information out there. 
---
Cthun was NOT mathematically impossible at all. The only reason he was wasn't killed was because people were new and bad to fight and there was a nasty bug with his tentacles having a chance to spawn inside the stomach(which would wipe the attempt).
---
australia has multiple time zones...
---
Spoken like a true casual. 😂

This is far too reasonable to be fun.

It had a hint of sarcasm, but I took a look at his post history cause I didn't know where he was coming from and the dude is a clown.  Every subreddit he's part of he's just angrily screaming at people and calling them all the buzzword phrases hes complaining about here.
---
Heroic on retail is about as hard as classic raiding, coming from someone who done both(well.. heroic mop and some of wod..), mythic is no where close to classic.
---
It sure does, and six days ago in Melbourne when anyone cared about this ancient thread it happened to be 0618. Thanks for stopping by.
---
Looking at it now, thank's.
---
When random trash mobs hexes the healer and nobody can cleanse it but him in LBRS.
---
whatever time you lose by skinning will be made up for easily by the time saved having that mount the second you ding 40
---
Imagine trying to have a point about leeway and just linking a bunch of windfury clips.

What would you create?
---
Attention all new players, do not use this addon! It will zip you through azeroth like you're on rails and rob you of the beauty of your first playthough of this wonderful game!
---
This addon is for players that have already leveled a dozen characters to 60, no longer get joy from the leveling process, and just want to hit 60 asap.
---
When you say that your opinion is the truth it is no longer an opinion.

One thing i'll add about mining...going from tin to iron, and iron to mithril, are both pretty big grinds. 
---
There will be ALOT of people who take mining, try to keep up at first, then realize what a grind its going to be, and stop at mid tin. If you're willing to slow down your leveling some, there will be alot of available iron and mithril early on, imo.
---
Can you be my dad
---
Been waiting for Classic release for nearly half my life. Me=33
---
Not gonna lie, I usually don't eat Domino's.... but I definitely will be eating it the week of launch thanks to this post.
---
&gt;Debatable
---
Usually, people would follow this up with an actual rebuttal.
---
Edit: You're right though.
---
As someone who meal preps every Sunday, I don't know how this would work. If you're preparing fresh cooked food it's gonna start going back by the mid of the second week and for sure by the end of the second week.
---
On my server alliance would skip everything and wallwalk to get the last horde horse gy. Then win.
---
if you want to be unique roll alliance warlock on a pvp server.  guaranteed to be the rarest combo in the game and you will get raid loot ez
---
We're going lengths we never have to motivation to go in order to get our bodies ready for the abuse that will get us right back out of shape 🤣
---
Get questie like the rest of us homie
---
Very
---
U cant make both factions on the same pvp server tho
---
No, Shadowmeld only has a 10 second cooldown in Classic. It wasn't increased to 2 minutes until patch 3.0.2 when it could also be used in combat.
---
Leather armor with Agi on it. I really think people are underestimating crafting profs early on. With dirt cheap skins, it won't be that hard to keep LWing up. 
---
Tailoring has a ton of early potential too, with bags and alot of cloth wearers, but im unaware how expensive cloth will tend to be early on.
---

You play whatever the hell you want and if they don’t like it, tough. They don’t own you.
---
do we know which phases they'll release all the quests in the zones?

Nope. Corporations and the absurdly wealthy abuse tax loopholes that only they can. Try doing the same thing, see how far you get.
---
There will be more rogues but also will be substantially more rogues per raid group than locks

I have never leveled a paladin so its pretty damn tempting, Just need more time lol

1-0 bound + Q and W. Then each of those paired with either Shift, Alt, or Ctrl. 48 keybinds in total
---
Level up!
---
Women prio on epics. Especially if they are single.
---
Judging by the comments, if they named the servers after zones, each one would be associated with the atmosphere of the zone.
---
STV would be the server for the PvP servers, because everyone would assume all the PvPers were of the same mindset.
---
The Barrens/Mulgore would attract Horde players who have nostalgia associated with the zone.
---
If they named one "black rock" or something, I'm sure it would attract hard core raiders.
---
Now that I think about it, the zone names might inbalance the servers.
---
If that's only the last 11 years then he missed the warcrack days.
---
Mage -&gt; Hunter -&gt; Warlock -&gt; Hunter -&gt; Warlock -&gt; Warrior? -&gt; Hunter -&gt; Warlock.
---
I expect to switch back to hunter and then to lock again a couple of times more
---
Np. It’s a pretty old system. Was around during vanilla. Just wasn’t needed anymore
---
He would of had to level past 49 to get his commander mount, the highest rank we could get in this bracket was rank 9.
---
I don't like paladin tanks in 5 mans because its so slow. Warrior and druid can just pull nonstop while the paladin has to stop and drink all the time.
---
hey i'm interested in joining this guild, im playing a human warrior tank or fury is ok i will add your discord
---
People have made plenty of suggestions, but make sure you watch (and listen) to the intro to your character login and read every single quest. 
---
The insignificant ones are just as important, because they add weight to the bigger ones and contribute a lot to the feel of playing an adventurer in a world
---
I hope not.
---
I'm just saying you can do whatever you want with those free hours. If someone chooses to play world of warcraft... OPs 2.5 hours a day might not seem hardcore.  As kids we would grind honor ranks for 16 hours a day in the summer to get rank 14.
---
&gt;I don't care about PvP any more, if I wanted to PvP I'd play a game where it was purely my skill versus their skill. Without anything obstificating that competition.
---
so you agree with me?
---
Yes
---
All of them. Brings good class fantasy.
---
Yeah, no confirmation on its ending timeframe yet sadly
---
A man lost in the desert must take such water as he is offered.
---
Gallons of it. After getting 2 million yards away for the hunter pet to stop chasing him.
---
so ahadowmeld can NOT be used in combat in classic and is a really short cooldown but is essentially useless since there’s no real benefit to it besides maybe getting the drop on someone or hiding
---
Nah mate, it's basically stationary stealth, if they gave it a 2 minute CD it would be literally worthless.
---
It's 10 seconds in Classic iirc.
---
Sounds perfect
---
They probably will, but by that time I'll have had months and months of Classic fun.  I'll have to decide how much I actually care then.
---
When I say "retail raiding" I mean HC and Mythic. 
---
I'm obviously not talking about LFR.
---
It's still just a dance that everyone can learn after watching a video or doing a couple of tries.
---
Tanking is faceroll + taunt at x stacs; healing is spam and wait for the game to do 50% of your healing for you. 
---
Dps is indeed more challenging than it will be in Classic.
---
If you’re older than 10, yes
---
you also couldnt get the arathi basin tabard even though you were exalted because the quest is level 60.   (sorry ive been bitter about it for years lol,  i have it now that they changed things but never did get to do the quest).
---
This is why I don't give a shit about finding a guild when I play classic. I'm gonna play at my own pace and then find a guild that suits *me.* People over 30 with real lives and jobs cannot commit this kind of time to a guild. Since many of us *are* people over 30 who cannot commit this kind of time to a guild, we'll be forming guilds of our own that have requirements that *do* suit us. 
---
I'm not worried.
---
To be fair, in the context of GW2 there isn't much in the way of hardcore content, so it makes sense it would attract a casual crowd. 
---
disclaimer: this is coming from someone who used to be on a relatively serious pvp team when the gw2 esports dream was alive... anet has just really sided with the more casual crowd; its hard to fault the subreddit too much
---
Yes, you can eat/drink and then Shadowmeld. It has a 10 second cooldown and is broken if you take any action.
---
Rogues and Druids cannot use Shadowmeld while stealthed, but they do receive a 5 point bonus to their anti-stealth detection attribute whenever they are stealthed. This is equivalent to one character level (your base stealth level is 5 * LEVEL). In comparison, each point in Master of Deception is worth 3 stealth points and can be maxed to 15 (5 talent points) which is equivalent to 3 character levels.
---
I raided through a few horde small guild alliances
---
Are people this stupid that they newd this «guide»? I mean seriously?
---
I know right. Tuberware lmao.
---
need a bot that just runs back to my corpse endlessly while I go drink beer with the boyz. then who's laughing
---
Lets be real. Paladin tank is "not viable" and it is offputting to join a group with one. Still there will be people who accept it. It is just a matter of how much min/max do you want to do:
---
- You can do a lot of encounters, but so can a hunter tank as well. There are hunter tanks who have killed Nefarian. It is still a meme specc.
---
- Paladin has no taunt so any aggro drop mechanic (this comes up from time to time, even in dungeons) is a potential wipe.
---
- Haveing to drink between pulls slows down dungeons.
---
- Prot has the same problem as retri, getting both spell hit and auto attack hit is nearly impossible to gear well for so you struggle a lot to get good gear for damage=threat generation.
---
I’m not even OP. It’s a fucking FANTASY game for god sakes. 
---
Wow that is an extremely toxic response too. I’m good though, I actually roll on PVP servers most of the time.
---
that is the thing. vanilla is not ONLY raiding. every specc finds its use somewhere in the game be it farming bgs open world pvp dungeons or raiding. dunno why people just ignore that all the time
---
No thank you.
---
I wouldnt give a fuck. Players who have a problem with paladin tanks in 5man content are boardline retarded
---
Please elaborate
---
I think it doesn't matter which phase, rogue won't be able to open up with a felhunter out. Would be quite hard to overcome.
---
Don't overlook the speed decrease for mind flay.  Helps in PVP and with Merlocs.
---
People act like it's difficult because it then justifies how OP warriors get when they are geared. Best dps,best tank and 0 hybrid tax
---
Doesn’t mage have a dispell? Or just curses?
---
&gt;semi hardcore in WotLK
---
&gt;MOP
---
&gt;HC raids
---
In other words, you are in no position to discuss this yet you claim that your opinion is truth.
---
Great play.
---
What's the purpose of your question?
---
Someone disagreed with your opinion and you told them “team games aren’t for you”. That really seems reasonable in your head?
---
Any guild that has already formed is most likely not casual. Wait for the game and join a guild organically
---
I think the largest difference between OSRS and WOW(classic or retail) is that WOW is a trinity (tank,heal, dps) game in pve. Im not sure WOW players are aware that these days many new MMORPG's do NOT use the trinity system to the same extent, since most players want to be dps or be self-reliant. E.g. GW2/BDO/ESO (to some extent).
---
Also dust out your computers with some compressed air before you're not going to want to unhook anything for months
---
I think it'll be quite useful for Warrior/Priest/Hunter solo, especially on PvP servers.  Being able to eat/drink while stealthed is pretty boss.  It's also nice in BGs for defending nodes or just AFKing wherever you want in PvE solo.
---
The warlock quests to unlock the different demons. Especially on alliance side... I remember being a small defenseless gnome warlock on a pvp server having to run from darshore all the way down to the barrens for part of what I think was the succubus questline. Every time you died it was easily a 10 minute walk back to your body because the alliance graveyards were so far.....
---
Can you elaborate?
---
No escape from reality
---
Classic raiding is more difficult, but not in the way people think. It's not about the raid content. It's about the raid.
---
Making 39 other people do their jobs is like herding cats into a cat box for a visit to the vet. Everyone wants to be lazy, nobody wants to do the work, everybody wants to run free with their pants down.
---
There's a reason it's not just a Raid Leader that leads Classic raid groups, you need officers to handle loot systems, you need Class Leaders to manage all the Warriors for Off-Tanking, all the Priests for who is healing who, all the Hunters for the rotations of Tranq Shot.
---
So I repeat, it's not the CONTENT that is difficult. It's the raid.
---
Herbalist+Alchemy is always good money if that is your primary goal.
---
If you don't like micro'ing pets and having no escapes then I really do not recommend warlock. Microing your felhunter is the defining trait for a good warlock, and warlocks ofc has no escapes. 
---
As for rogues I would not fear getting a raidspot. There's a lot of spots for rogues and you seem like a very dedicated player. You should do just fine. Most hardcore guilds won't bring more than 3 warlocks for most content, where as 6 rogues is normal. So that's something to think about. If you want I can write out what I think you should do the first 2 months as rogue then? I'll be playing one myself so I've thought a lot about it.
---
528 hours of game time to do 1-60? That’s actually less than I expected.
---
or a look at the last 100 threads made on the exact same topic this week.
---
Shadow Priest&gt;Warlock&gt;Rogue
---
You said level 61, that's BC right?
---
Aw man that was painful to listen to for more reasons than one. My take away from that is to never group with anyone when on a twink toon and that kids can be real pieces of shit. Good advice, I guess.
---

---
I got sick of being lonely / skinny / a twig so I started lifting in between work shifts and vidya. 13 years later, I'm stronk as heck. Though cardio is more difficult and flexibility is down.
---
Naxx has very few bosses that need optimal raid composition. The first few bosses of every wing are fairly easy. You just need to find some dudes who know how to play. I'd say this is easier these days. A lot of people were total noobs back then. Today we see (private server) guilds doing an entire Naxx run in less than 90 minutes.
---
This 6 months figure that no one has a source on?
---
It is rational to say "I *want* no changes but I accept that X may *have* to change."
---
Its Classic. Everything about it is a time sink.
---
I find gathering professions relaxing myself, and even if I am underleveled in them by 60, every node gathered is gold in the pocket
---
Not to be rude but you called my post misguided I asked you to elaborate and your reply was pretty generic and vague. 
---
I played 29, 39 and 49 from late vanilla to mop. If my experience is misguided, as you mentioned, please have the courtesy of expanding on your comment. Otherwise I’ll just consider it a throwaway. Thanks.
---
&gt; The best system is clearly the one where you get rewards for the content you're doing.
---
this is own of the downfalls and lines of thinking that killed wow and kills modern mmo's
---
No.
---
the eastern plaguelands gargoyle debuff
---
putrid bile:
---
\-100% healing (including potions, natural hp reg, food and hp5 items) on a 45 sec debuff - with a nature dmg dot on top of it 
---
in other words
---
your class can't dispell poisons and you have no antivenom with you? Guess who's screwed... or forced to /afk for a minute before you can heal up again
---
I liked when it would lower your skill for stuff like Shadow despite spells not using skill like weapons/defense.
---
Duskwood, my favourite zone.
---
Do you have a link to the warrior discord?
---
Did that work on the beta, is what i am wondering.
---
Mining, or Herbalism, if you're just in it for the money. 
---
Also at 60 you can always drop skinning and pick up alchemy for that sweet arcanite transmute... that's a few gold every 2 days just for clicking buttons. 
---
Skinning and tailoring go well together, especially if you farm your own cloth.
---
Also making your own bags is nice, and making bags for others is profitable.
---
You don't have taunt.  You have to drink between pulls.  You don't have a ranged pull (unless you go engineering or use boomerang or buy the ezthrow dynamite, prolly missing a few).  
---
Also, a lot of your threat comes from reflective damage.....and like I said you don't have a taunt.  If you aren't getting hit you'll do fuck all for threat.
---
As can the elevators in Thunder Bluff and Thousand Needles.
---
Lmao this is me with my group of friends. I the no lifer took a week off with PTO for launch. I’m get ahead but I’m try work on Rogue alt. I’ll be going Warrior main with then for tanking!
---
Or how about the Druid Waterform quest? 
---
You all mock it until they have the fastest non-mounted way from one side of Arathi Basin to another by going seal-mode through the moat.
---

You should report them to the FBI dude, this guild definitely needs to be on some sort of watch list.
---
Good times ahead! Can't wait to sink our teeth into our next game as a community :)
---
That silithid pox you got from various silithid nests was also terrible and made you take a big chunk of extra physical damage.
---
This is truly the content I’m looking forward to lol
---
Right.  BC was slicker, it seemed at the time... we didn't know that it was just the beginning of the game automating itself away.
---
I like your thinking.
---
Hey, obviously sharing your own thoughts on a topic is fine, I'm just saying you were wording it specifically like you were responding to and dissecting opinions of mine that I hadn't actually stated. Like when you say "thinking these people will contribute by charities and such is just stupid and naive", or "Don't really see how it would be moral for the rich and powerful to get special benefits" it sounds like you are responding to someone arguing how the government should operate and predicting levels of philanthropic efforts in a world without taxes. I was only commenting on my subjective moral views of skirting taxes on a personal basis, and how an individual might be able to justify to themselves how they could do more good in the world, and was not commenting on what I think others will do, or how the government should operate.  
---
On the contrary, I think it was you who was turning it into a broader political discussion. You're right that you aren't going to say anything that is going to change my political views, but are you going to change your political views from anything I say? I'm automatically a close-minded individual only interested in winning internet arguments because...why? You say "Hope you have a good day man" as if I've been hurling internet insults at you and you're being the bigger man, but it seems to me like you are the one who has been combative.  
---
When your single paragraph has a lot of words and phrases like "I'll never get", "common American mentality", "scummy", "to see people devolve", "greedy", "for certain", "definitely", "stupid", "naive", "fucked everyone", "sickening, immoral, and illegal", it seems to me like you are the one fixed in your views, stereotyping, and with extreme angst towards anyone who disagrees with you. I think you're projecting.
---
Ahh a fellow Bleeding Hollow boy. Been on BH since vanilla, still active and never left!
---
If I recall there is a more profitable transmute. Think it was to water cause it had half the CD of the bar. Don’t hold me to this though... been a long time.
---
Healers can continue to drink while the tank pulls the next group, then stand up to heal once tank needs it.
---
Shard farm isn’t that big of a deal. Or rather, you get used to doing it and kinda stop worrying and learn to love the burn.
---
They do these all the time. It comes out to just barely better than buying 2 two-topping pizzas for $5.99 each that they do all the time
---
Here are some statistics in infographic form: https://i.imgur.com/jxtOQlu_d.jpg

Sexual harassment is a g/kick.
---
This is the exact opposite of reality, but OK
---
Go Mining and Skinning and just mail box all the ore to alt. Make more money for the mount and drop skinning after ur mount.
---
Then they're not really above the law - they're doing exactly what the law allows for.
---
20g is a giant amount when you're talking about having the money for you mount at 40.
---
Lets keep things in context here shall we?
---
I came here to say this - those Murlocs are the very worst - BECAUSE the cool down for recasting that ink spell is the same as the duration - so it can really drag out combat.
---
What does this say
---
There is going to be no gold in the game at launch. Those lazy people won't have anything to buy the leather with. Vendors on the other hand have unlimited money. It'll take months before people have enough gold accumulated from quests/vendors to be able to steadily purchase things from other players.
---
This is a terrible ide you are making content for only the top 10% and most likely they will not run it often sins majority of raid don't raid non optimal specs. When making a expansion you need to make it accessible to the majority of players this is why extra levels are so good. And as a bonus you give players an eaven playing field gear reset is the best part of a expansion
---
please elaborate on this "modern gaming" you speak of...
---
Sick 6 mins commercial with no proof of concept.
---
It is literally the best item a hunter can hope for until aq is released where as it is a mediocre weapon for a rogue. Both dragonfang and perds are better than it and both of them are really rogue only weapons. I could see a pug letting both players roll over them but to me it should go to the hunter.
---
Played Horde, always Horde, Horde since vanilla.
---
...but I'm playing Alliance Human Pally in classic for a couple of reasons.
---
1) Massively shorter queue times for BGs.
---
2) Once 60 and decent geared, I'm parking myself at the crossroads to gank Horde, fish for Deviate nearby and Alliance side of Barrens Chat is meant to be even more stupid.
---
3) Bubble HS.
---
4) Alliance suck. I suck. I want to help them suck more.
---
Try playing skyrim and go the route of the character you will main in classic.
---
Walk around all day as a Human, live your live every day as a Human, login to a fantasy Game as a Human.    
---
Such bravery and daring imagination.
---
Yeah, especially for priests. You either miss out on fear ward or devouring plague, but get complete troll status as king mind control into lava status in Black Rock mountain
---
Im ashamed that I followed through leveling up my paladin to 60 :(
---
Does this mean hunters don't really have a dead zone now?
---
kinda why i want to play wow, i’m maxed total on osrs
---
I remember I quit bfa back in dec 2018.  At that time my ilvl was a low 305 or something.  The hardest dungeon was uldir.  My friend consistnetly played since then and has a 390 ilvl.  I came back cuz they were offering a 3 day free trial for the new zones that were released.  Nazjatar and mechagon were released.  I enter the new zones and got an ilvl of 390 after not playing for 7 months within 3 days.  In 3 days I caught up to my friend who had been playing for 7 months after I quit.  This was all quest gear from the new zone and I was able to run heroics, mythics, m+ and raids right away using what many people call "welfare gear".
---
Yeah my wife wants to go alliance too.  So dwarf rogue it is.
---
I did mention that melee dps is harder in retail. 
---
Read my OP. 
---
Nevertheless, melee dps being easyer in Classic doesn't make the raids easyer as a whole. 
---
Melee dps is just 1/2 of 3 roles. 2 out of 3 roles are much harder in vanilla / classic WoW.
---
OSRS player since 2005 and played nostalrius. YES
---
Would love you're opinion on what to do as Rogue if you have the time, thanks.
---
Its different because you grind a single monster for like 500 kills instead of a single boss a few times.
---
I think he IS the Moonkin friend but is trying to pass it off as "my friend.."
---
I guess you didnt read the title. It explicitly states Osrs
---
I plan on playing a warrior, and going Mining/Skinning until I have an Epic mount and some money in the bank.  Will swap to Engineering later for I hope the sweet PvP in open world! xD
---
Any confirmation on the old voice? I would kind of assume they wouldn't use it seeing as they're not paying that voice actor anymore.
---
Anyone plan on forming a casual PVP guild? I'm gonna play classic, had a PVP healing priest and might do that again but probably gonna try mage first.
---
Just so I know what server to roll with right away.
---
the sheer supply of rugged leather makes it usually cost less than thick leather and sometimes even heavy leather.
---
You have already replied to a comment here where someone has linked you a website to get add-ons. They go in interface/addons. 1.12 add-ons will not work, you need 1.13 add-ons for classic. You can download the client now from the battlenet launcher, unsure if you need a sub for the download, some one will have to chime in on this, I doubt you do though.
---
Just make sure you roll a Troll Shaman named Thex.
---
I'm with you,  grad school starts September 3rd. I didn't have these worries during vanilla!
---
Okay well here's how it's done from someone who has at least 50 kt clears:
---
In phase 2 almost every guild soft stacks near the entrance. You need to be somewhat spread so you don't all get knocked, but you will close enough to start dpsing within 5-10 seconds. You can most certainly send in DPS immediately, because you will be chain stunning the mobs until they die.
---
I played feral in tbc, Blizz said it was the most complex spec in the game at the time. Tanking on a monk was a much more involved rotation. Everyone has their own opinions.
---
Well ill have epic mount and full prebis with enchants and 500+ spending gold after one month.
---
So a 2minute cooldown stun for 1.8 seconds is worth the 400hp you get from a LHW? Pointless..
---
I don't think it's that simple tbh.
---
Orc is good if you like playing reactionary. Aka lots of pacing, waiting out big crits and playing the long game, which is extremely good for shamans when gear is good and against certain classes. Good for elongated duels, good in big fights like av or midfield in wsg.
---
Tauren are good for controlling the fight and quickly bending it to your favor. For duels and stuff this is generally a great skill to have. If you think you will have burst potential then tauren is great.  Best for like solo world pvp, duels, capping flag in wsg or AB.
---
Tauren is great flavor imo just for the look, because orc will be straight up everywhere when classic launches.
---
Forsaken + Orcs have incredible racials that blow anything the Alliance have out of the water, for pvp
---
&gt;I wouldn't even try to control people this way with 3 years raiding experience in vanilla, and that experience has all taken place recently.
---
Private server experience =/= vanilla experience. At most you're barely above them not playing in 15 years. 
---
That said, you've gotten some good advice in this thread. It's important to sit them down and explain to them that people should be able to play how they want. If they aren't afforded that opportunity then they are going to burn out quickly and the group will fall apart. Rather be a little less efficient than not existing at all.
---
you clearly dont know wtf your talking about and dont know anything about rp-pvp culture or whats it like, such as emerald dream server was known for rp-world pvp.
---
Exactly. And they said there would be no classic and here we are so you never know. Likely not at launch as they haven't mentioned it though
---
I will be impressed to be videos of drawfs triumphing in Wpvp against forsaken
---
i feel seen 🙌
---
Sucks to be you I guess. 
---
I’m speedrunning the week and my partner is support crew. He’s taking care of everything and bringing in the food etc.
---
They go away when you die.
---
Basically yeah.  Besides the odd bug fix, don't expect any changes from what 1.12 has to offer.

you will make most money from fishing
---
It would be in interesting endeavor to be sure, but right now I'm just going to focus on stuff that happened during vanilla.
---
- 1 patron
---
- 50,000 "hey its me ur brother"
---
Have you heard, they have breakfast hot pockets now?
---
Boopers, damn son you are easily offended.
---
Our guild had pretty much 1 rule.
---
No politics or religion in guild chat or ventrilo. Worked really well for us.
---
Your friend could resist the superior faction for only so long.
---
You can level fast to 40, but if you don't have money to buy a mount then its a horrible feeling. I'd rather take the extra few seconds, even its just to vendor it.
---
There will be little to no gold in the economy at the start, people will be spending it all on skills long before they buy mats. I remember what it was like during the Vanilla beta and initial release all those years ago.
---
Go Green or Go Home.  
---
:-D
---
Race changes won’t, since they never were in Vanilla.
---
The developers said server changes may be necessary later on, in one of the Beta Announcement interview videos.
---
mc first month is casual though. mc will be clear week 1
---
wondering about the golds and the reputation with this method, how good is it in comparison of a regular questing method?
---
Doesn't this whole thread violate rule 5?
---
https://youtu.be/u53weeu0QAo
---
I've been replaying WC3 to bone up on my lore! It's scratching the itch in like a methadone kind of way lol.
---
But then you qualify it saying streamers beat it in terrible gear at 58. How is that possible if it was "overtuned"
---
"Hey we have a warlock AND a hunter.  They can bounce aggro tank that shit!"
---
Lol
---
Server transfer was present is Vanilla, it cost money and you could only do it one time every X months. 
---
To change race/classes you level an alt. Nothing easy in Vanilla.
---
pls be generous my big dick and big money god.
---
This is a discussion I don't really have the experience to get into, and the real original data is long gone. But even you acknowledge that the stomach bug made it unkillable.
---
That basically adds to my original point: it's easy to make an ultra-hard or impossible game (one simple bug is enough), there is nothing special about that.
---
I'm going to most likely be rolling a Dwarf Priest so does that totally exclude Engineering? I had considered it briefly but I'm not sure it will help much... What are the reasons its not useful for a priest aside from jumper cables being useless?
---
True, but at the same time the Alliance was lucky Viscidus was an optional boss.
---
Again, overtuned on PSservers
---
shaman air totem and druid cat form are my favorite
---
looks good. The thing that draws me most to Hakurai's is all the 'in between' stuff. Like alliance grouping up and doing like 10 quests pre-deadmines to get Orc Crusher to be well geared to smash through the dungeon --- then X quests you do that you can get while running from southshore to SM, then turn in an hour later when you vendor, retrain, and make the run again.
---
it provides critaura!!
---
Look at mister money man over here, buying remove curse at lvl 18.
---
Hunters are one of the worst dueling classes in the game, they were never great in duels.
---
Thank you :)
---
&gt; Between the DH (tank) and the Prot Paladin, I barely noticed any difference (bear in mind this is lvl 100-102): Both have interrupts, both have aoe buffs, both have movement abilities, both have defensive CDs. I'm sure at end-game the game play varies a lot between the two but - aside from one using a shield and other not - everything looks and feels the same.
---
Dude, ***not even close.***
---
I main a prot paladin. It's the best class in the game. Prot Paladin offers you several group CDs that are game breaking good. Lay on hands has saved my bacon and other players more times than I can count. You get that early on in leveling. Blessing of Protection is likewise an amazing buff that saves teammates all the time. There's a talent that turns it into magic immunity rather than physical damage. 
---
You can use your Bubble macro to quickly clear buffs off of you, or bubble taunt to ignore debuffs but still hold aggro on the main target (for 3 seconds at least). You can also bubble to just remove debuffs entirely. So any time you lose control of your character, you can just get out of it. You have some of the best healing for a tank in the game and can often save your own teammates from death. Bouncing shields is always fun too!
---
All of that is 100% different from DH tanking, which is more "DPS" oriented than defensive, like the paladin. DH do not get any group buffs at all.
---
&gt; After all that, I decided to create a new character (draenei paladin) and got to lvl 6. Everyone I came across with was fully equipped in heirlooms, killing everything in 1 sec and moving and behaving like an AI bot on a pre-set path for the most optimized questing route, not on the same realm as me, and no one talking.
---
Leveling has always been a chore and most people hated it. I'm not sure what you were looking for? The game is 14 years old. To add to this, a lot of people seem to be in two camps. Either they don't want to level quickly because it "takes the fun out of it" or they want to level super fast and have it easy. 
---
&gt; The class trainers might as well be decoration assets at this point since I don't think they serve any purpose anymore, not even to reset your talents.
---
What would you want done with them? 
---
&gt; Anyways, I was bored and decided to log on retail for the first time in the longest time I've been without playing WoW, and boy it was awesome. It was awesome to further realize in my own eyes that Classic is gonna be absolutely amazing.
---
I'm not trying to shit on you for liking what you like, but almost everything you've said was simply not true. You barely played your high level characters and grossly oversimplified what they are capable of doing. 
---
You should have just stuck with, "I didn't really like retail and I am looking forward to playing Classic." instead of just making stuff up and checking off them buzz words for karma.
---
I’m proud of him, finally coming out as scum.
---
One extra mage at the same spot ruins the efficiency. Even if you do break away from the pack, any spots in the open world will more than likely not be viable.
---
&gt; co-gm who was the gf of the GM
---
That's a shit guild right there mate.
---
If you've come here to get an unbiased take on WoW Classic, you've come to the wrong place.
---
Just killing time, my dude. I don't mind them.
---
Makes sense, especially when you factor in the congestion caused by large amounts of people trying to do gathering quests on limited mobs.
---
Again, that doesn't explain the connection with your statement about streamers.
---
What about dungeon names, too?
---
If your tank is competent enough to stance dance or if you have a single dwarf priest in the raid at all, it doesn't matter.
---
Fear Ward helps, and it's quite a useful racial. It's not some necessity that makes human or dwarf priests worthless.
---
ya man
---
1. Priest class population is less on Horde, so there is higher demand for Horde priests. Personally, the "demand" aspect is most important for me because I gotta be different. 
---
2. The troll racial berserking, passive regeneration, and 5% dmg to beasts is noteworthy. 
---
3. Shadowguard is OP in combination with black out. Some PvE use as well. Hex of Weakness is insanely offensive in group PvP.
---
4. Fearward...arguably the best priest racial spell.
---
You’re forgetting about the time wasted NOT having your mount at 40 due to the lack of gold. I feel like gathering professions are good to get as you’re leveling. I mean even waiting to 60 and then skilling them up from 1-300 will take lots of time to do.
---
Aside from obvious things like food prep I will be doing a few others to get more out of my 10+ days off from work. 
---
Normally have a beard, shaving it off and letting it grow back while I am vacationing inside the game. 
---
Usually keep my hair pretty short, going to buzz it down and let it regrow with the beard. 
---
Staying up late the few days before launch so I can sleep during the day on launch day and stay up that night playing. 
---
Taking a shower an hour before launch (might as well get a good cleaning in).
---
The way you have framed this makes this 100% your opinion.  You don’t talk about racials at all and mostly just looks and leveling experience.  
---
I personally like the way undead looks and even though there’s a growing population of troll sympathizers undead has the better racials.  
---
Also don’t make a choice just based on leveling experience since you’re spending more time at 60.
---
Did you not play vanilla?
---
For some reason I never realized Stone form breaks blind. Game changer imo. Everyone be rolling dwarf priest for that fear ward and all I want is beards and blind breaks.
---
I am a long-time World of Warcraft player who began with my cousin in vanilla in a terrible MC/BWL guild and ended up raiding with Blood Legion in Cataclysm (pinnacle) for world 2nd and running my own US9th guild for the end of Cataclysm and beginning of MoP.
---
I would like to be a main tank warrior for a guild who is raiding EST and planning on clearing Naxxramas. I have extensive tanking experience and plan on rushing a Quel'Serrar and making a Thundefury so that our dps can actually play the game.
---
I'd like to raid between 7PM-1AM EST (4pm-10pm pst) a few nights a week. So if your guild falls into that category, please reach out. I'd come with a top tier mage and holy priest.
---
I don’t really understand the hate for alliance. I honestly just like the quests for alliance better
---
I am against the idea of race and name changes being added but I seriously think they might be added eventually if classic does well. Eventually investors will want additional monitization added.
---
Been going back and forth but I think me and my friends finally settled on Alliance because one wants to play a pally.
---
Played a gnome lock back in the day and was looking forward to rolling undead lock this time around. But it’s hard to imagine seeing a member of the opposite faction and not shouting HORDE!!!
---
I’m in the same boat. Going horde this time around. Was debating undead vs troll; don’t like how tier sets look on undead but their casting animation to me is superior. Racials bring a whole new element to the conversation but largely fine devouring plague overrated (long cooldown) however shadowgaurd is also hard to keep active at times from a GCD standpoint. Do what feels natural I suppose.
---
Dazed 100%
---
Did they not say that only the starting zones would have this sort of separation of player? Or was it a time based thing that would be removed after a few weeks and the initial rush was over?
---
Yeah I'll give you that. It's a good way to go in solo and end up in a decent place without having to look around.
---
Name change and server transfer is likely at some point hopefully they do not allow race change and if they did it should only be in the same faction. No wow tokens or mounts or boost should never be allowed if they started allowing boost or tokens i would be done with Blizzard.
---
I legit can not figure out why someone would base their entire class/faction choice on "ease of getting to a couple of dungeons," which constitutes *maybe* an hour or two of your many day gaming experience. Even then, the only real advantage horde has is SM, because you have dungeons on the opposite side that are much easier to reach for Alliance.
---
I have this guide. 
---
As a fellow speedrunner (solo) and guide writer, can only say a ton of work has gone into the guide. I think if you are seriously planning to run a group to 60, or want a summary of each dungeon and how to get the quests, it will tick the box. Hakurai also included some opportunistic questing between dungeon grinds and marked maps. 
---
Likely the most complete group guide available for either side. 
---
Great job Hakurai!
---
I just need leveling buddies because i am crazy and want to level as priest with my talents in healing.
---
Also, the dungeon accessibility point is pretty insignificant. Takes horde awhile to get black rock mountain. Takes alliance awhile to get to Silithus.
---
RAWRRR! RETAIL BAD, CLASSIC GOOD!!!
---
Yes. This was my buddy's logic lol.
---
I almost can’t tell if its copypasta.  These lists pop up for all highly anticipated game launches.
---
Hey, not always true!!!
---
So I used to lead a Mythic guild in WoD and Legion, but for Classic I started an actually casual guild that is all about maximizing our freedom in the game (including suboptimal specs and all-around minimal raid requirements). I've been intentionally looking to build up with players before release as those are people who are more likely to stay in the long haul. In fact, we're up to like 80-90+ members now! Our main raid night roster is pretty full at this point, but if you're a casual player looking for some light raiding opportunities and an actual community to enjoy ***the best game ever made with***, then leave a comment, message, or discord friend request (Oleon#2355)!
---
Here's a Blizz forum post about us:  [https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/hope-rises-1-raid-week-h-pvp-mediumcore/200275/32](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/hope-rises-1-raid-week-h-pvp-mediumcore/200275/32)

Good luck everyone! Happy hunting!
---
Blizzard boiiz HATE when you use this trick!  (Not a cheat)
---
Laughs in Orcish
---
As a rogue, sorry not sorry
---
&gt; -Leveling from 110-120 (did the level increase that came with buying BFA) was a joke and took 2 solid sessions to obtain and leveling felt meaningless with no new talents or anything between 110-120. Just a time gate to get to 120 with no actual change of gameplay from 110 to 120.
---
Ideally, the goal is for you to get to max level since you're now playing catch up on an expansion that's been out for two years already. It takes about 10-14 hours played time to get to 120, although I'm not sure if that's changed since launch. 
---
The goal being literally to get you and your buddies to end game so you can actually enjoy the game. 
---
&gt; -Graphics and general fluidity of the game (from a visual stance) have been amazing and I am glad that Classic will have this engine to run on.
---
Roughly it will. Physics like grass moving when you walk past it, and water effects will be in Classic. That is optional, however. You can go back to the old graphics. 
---
&gt; -Gear is literally thrown at you, I have one friend who has played pretty consistently from Cata to present and I have better gear than him in less than a month played. (not /played) Which makes getting gear feel a lot less rewarding.
---
Gear is less of a factor, but still important since like WoD. The game focuses more on you actually having to be good at your class and stand out of the fire. You have multiple ways to obtain gear, but the best gear is still gated behind the hardest content. 
---
&gt; -I really enjoy Mythics as they are definitely difficult and have nice change of mechanics between difficulty to keep them fresh.
---
One of the best things to come out of Legion. Mythic dungeons and Mythic+ helped to keep the game fresh and rewarding. Again, it's not so much the gear, but how good you are at the game. Does this make sense? 
---
&gt; I like the time walking events to play raids and dungeons I missed with gear that can be upgrades.
---
Blizzard has made great use of their scaling tech. You can also level with people that are in your relative level range and not put them at a disadvantage for xp. So old world content you can generally group up 20-59, etc etc. 
---
&gt; I dont like the lack of realm community and character identity, as in no one is "famous" and I dont get the "OMG this guy has x weapon or x armor piece" anymore.
---
That system wasn't very good though, honestly. X armor piece and Y weapon was not difficult to obtain, just time consuming. It wasn't "Wow, that guy is really good at the game." it was "Wow, that guy has literally no life and can spend a fuck ton of more time on this game than I can."
---
A lot of pvp rewards, for example, are skill based (like arenas). Titles and achievements likewise are awesome to throw around too. 
---
&gt; I like that I can play for a few hours and usually get some sort of upgrade, although that is diminishing as I get higher iLvl. To note, I only like this because I am not trying to play this version of WoW for the long run, so the "instant" gratification of getting gear is working out for what I am playing it for.
---
I like that I can get online, Queue up, and get into an instance and likely finish it within 30mins or so depending on group and difficulty. 
---
You can't do that in Classic. To put it in perspective, it took me typically about 45mins to create and complete a deadmines group on the beta servers. As time progressed and more people reached max level or didn't play as much, there would be times (later on in the beta) that I just didn't get to do deadmines at all because not enough people were online or that level. It'll be even harder to get groups together for higher level dungeons. The time frame will be at least an hour or more assuming your group doesn't wipe. 
---
Overall WoW is a time consuming game. You're not going to get far, or accomplish much if you only have an hour or less to play a day. 
---
&gt; -I dont like iLvL telling me what is an upgrade Means I dont even look at the stats or anything. Just oh, it has a higher iLVL with the substats im looking for, sweet upgrade.
---
That depends. Typically an ilvl will be an upgrade if it is large enough, but getting your main secondary stat is still important. For all its good and bad features, the heart of Azeroth system is designed to also put weight into some pieces. 
---
There's always the "best" for your spec though. Classic's armor system was not always intuitive in that way. 
---
&gt; I like the azerite powers/gear, i think that is a cool concept and fun to tinker with.
---
This system is a toned down version of the artifact system from Legion. It is a decent stop gap for players that want talent trees, and talent trees as you know them in Classic, being unworkable and generally bad design. 
---
&gt; Conclusions, it has been fun to kill the time waiting for Classic, but Classic will for sure be my main jam that I will sink countless hours into.
---
And there's nothing wrong with that. Classic is going to be a lot of people's jams. I can see why some people enjoy the features behind what Classic can offer, but I always have difficulty understanding why they like certain things over retail.

That’s the discord for the RP-PvP conclave NA side. I hear EU has one too but since I am not EU I don’t dabble in it.
---
You going in solo? Find a guild or some people to regularly play with and you wont regret it.
---
Play solo and you might regret race/faction
---
just the mental factor that they will be sweating that 5 point kidney shot can win you the battle. ive seen people say online they dont gank an orc because they can rely on their stuns.
---
Heres the shocker, for 2 decades the average age of a gamer has stuck around 28-35.
---
Warrior -&gt; rogue -&gt; shaman -&gt; try hard feral dps/OT -&gt; warrior

It does allow for all classes including opportunistic quests to gear up
---
If I knew all these guides would come out would have 2 years of my life back lol
---
If I was young again then the idea of spending most of my time at 60 would be true, but I'm not sure this is the case anymore. I will have very limited time and it could end up that just getting to 60 will be the majority of my Classic WoW experience (hoping not). I didn't mention racials by name but I guess thats what this post boils down to on some level. That and the number of dungeons you can easily access on the Alliance side.
---
"Looking for someone with 10 years experience in our proprietary programming language."
---
Dps feral says hello.
---
Most people wait until 60 with engineering but if you are leveling mining anyway then you could use the mats to level engi and have some fun with the pvp advantages.
---
Why people are basing their decision on what to roll on a lvl 40 duel tournament is beyond all logical comprehension.
---
&gt;I suspect they will have dozens if not hundreds of layers per server, with the goal likely of having a few hundred players per zone.
---
Agree here, going to be very fun!
---
Sucks for anyone who picks a streamer server - 6hour+ queues inc.
---
None of this shit really matters. Unless they are a currently raiding guild or a guild that played extensively on a private server none of what anyone says will hold up in two weeks.
---
1. Plenty of people won’t hit 60. They see that the record is 4:20 and think it will take them 5:00 or 5:12. WRONG!!! If you didn’t level in Vanilla pre Cata it will take you 7-10 days played easily. So many of the classes are painful to level, especially pre-30 where they don’t have much utility abilities.  
---
2. So many people will quit. They will quit during Onny’s attunement. They will quit during the gearing process. They will quit from the pre-raid grind because their guild says they have to have every tuber, pot, and scroll to enter MC. They will quit from the MC attunement.  They will quit because they are tired of farming soul shards and biscuits. They will quit because the rotations are just fucking boring as snot for Mages, Locks, Druids, Pallys, etc. 
---
3. Real guilds are going to snipe their people. We used to do it. We used to have it done to us. Warriors, Priests, and Mages will constantly have the option to upgrade and will take it. Nice Benediction you gave to your MH Priest...gone. That couple that is a Tank/Healer duo....gone. 
---
4. So many people are going to laugh at the difficulty. A serious Mythic or even Heroic level raider is going to be poking their eyes out if Phase 1 lasts more than a month. MC and BWL are easier than most Raid Finder runs. AQ and Naxx definitely raise the bar, but you have to get there first. 
---
5. Just wait two weeks. All these “casual guilds” will fall by the side and the serious guilds will have open spots.
---
I'd rather play a race I like looking at vs a race that is optimal that I hate looking at.
---
Yes. What does that have to do with this?
---
No races, make sure you pick your shit right the first time - server transfers confirmed but no date
---
Nah. Trolls are dope.
---
No. Undead racials are mediocre and the troll racials are actually good.
---
Oh beyond any doubt the bronze debuff on Chromaggus. Random stuns for 3 seconds with no internal cooldown and can only be removed with a very limited resource that drops from trash in the raid. I fucking hate that boss so much! It's the only time I've ever fisted my keyboard out of frustration.
---
Let's be honest, mages are too busy spamming Frostballs. Even if they have curse remove.
---
Nope, only those three and Dwight from alliance  side. Got a guild? ;)
---
Does the mark make you visible while stealthed to their group-members also, or just the hunter themself? I'll be playing a druid, but assuming it will work the same as rogue stealth.
---
Oh my god yes. This, 100% this.
---
Level 5
---
By access I don't mean getting into groups, I mean physically being able to get to the dungeons easily without wasting a lot of time. I feel like this might be an unnecessary concern but it seems like getting to dungeons is physically easier 0-40 on the horde side and with little time to play this is going to be a factor.
---
Disagree with the first point, if an item is a tiny upgrade and not bis, taking it over someone else it would be a huge upgrade for is a dick move.
---
restorative pot removes it btw
---
Arena PvP in a not-yet-announced expansion isn't going to be a factor in a hardcore raiding guild's decision to roll Alliance in Classic. Paladins just bring too much to the table in Classic.
---
Honestly I like the people on horde mode.  But I roll alliance because 1. night elves and 2. Stormwind and Ironforge are just too spectacular
---
The alliance side is more polished. Quest are better designed. Main cities are bigger. Some people really like the Barrens but it's a fact that Blizzard was running out of time when they did the Horde side in 2003-2004. That's why troll/orc share the same zone and the barrens is a massive low level zone. As a development point of vue they didn't have two factions until the last few months. Some people like the Barrens and Ogrimar. For me it just looked unfinished. Ironforge is an epic sight.
---
For shadow priests troll racials are ok, but if you plan on healing UD is better.  
---
And as far as dungeons it is nice that horde have SM.
---
Yeah it doesn’t make sense. People want Vanilla. They are willing to pay $15 a month to play a 20 year old game. There is like 0 development resources spent compared to developing a new Expansion. 
---
Blizz is the only company I would know that wasn’t excited about this. Imagine Apple’s face if they could sell the iPhone 1 for $600 or if Ford could sell you a 2004 Taurus for sticker price.
---
Yeah NE hunters can FD shadowmeld for a makeshift vanish, they can even kite away, FD, eat/drink, and shadowmeld to sit invisible drinking/eating
---
I flare spam whenever I farm.

That’s exactly what I’m doing with my stress test time!

Clicking is fine for abilities that you use less often, such as your buffs, mount, food/drink, certain consumables, etc..
---
For all the abilities that are part of your main toolkit, you will want to have those bound, and bound to keys that you can reach the easiest.  The less used, or the more situational the ability, you can bind it to a key that a bit harder to reach.
---
But by no means do you have to have every single ability bound.
---
I love their bar addon for more than the rest.

Their pizza is okay too.

I don't know if this technically classifies under what you're asking, but I'm in the middle of writing the first draft of a novella right now. 
---
I'm typically ranging about 1,000 - 1,500 words a day, and I want to keep this up during release week (which I also have off of work). 
---
I'm almost at 10,000 words so far, so I have intentions on finishing the rough draft before WoW is released. A novella typically ranges somewhere between 30,000 - 50,000 words so it could be possible if the story ends up being on the shorter side. 
---
I'm taking Tuesday off of life essentially, and letting myself bask in 2004 glory.. But then on Wednesday morning, I'm gonna have breakfast and write, and then when I'm done my 1,000 words (typically takes between 30 minutes to an hour depending on how much I know before I write), and then I have the rest of the day to play. But if I don't finish that, then I don't get to play.
---
Yeah! And make your dick fall off!
---
I started playing in BC. What is complicated about it? I recently was checking out shadow priest and frost mage rotations and a lot of vids from pservers are kills of Nefarian. All they do is spam Nef, then burst a pack of adds and finish Nef.
---
Alliance all the way. I’ve played both in retail but horde cities in classic are mud huts compared to Ironforge and Stormwind. Also horde doesn’t wear shoes.
---
I actually did exactly that once I killed enough Owlbeasts for the quest. Just Leeroyed myself into the Furbolg camp. Fuck waiting 30 min for it to wear off.
---
Others are 5-10 min usually so you might as well suck it up because the Graveyard run was horrible.
---
Even hard core guilds would probably realize that group farming would probably be less efficient then everyone doing their own thing.
---
It doesn’t change that you just didn’t understand the base concept of what I was saying and had to backtrack to asking if I played Vanilla as a self defense mechanism :/ 
---
Just because you thought something was X over a decade ago doesn’t mean it was, and my post was about how private servers are wrong. All you really did was realize you misunderstood what I said and made a claim that it’s just “Obvious” what Vanilla was like. It’s childish reasoning. Hindsight is always “Obvious”. It’s a fallacy.
---
No trial, but if you roll on a PVP server we can offer you an execution.
---
Bought it too. I didn't really except guide like that. I mean it looks so damn easy to follow. And its clear guide too! Gj Hakurai.
---
Sorry for Diggin this old post, but do you have bfa on thar acccount? I have a sub just not bfa and I can't see it in the bnet launcher
---
OS was a glorified world boss though. Just a bit longer than VoA. And after TotC it was just burst it till it die.
---
The closest thing in Classic is Onyxia. People don't expect wipes and don't expect to actually do more than press 1 on repeat. BWL is different, BWL is like an ICC pug aiming at least for 8 bosses.
---
You said release
---
Kill the drama before it kills the group. Tell people to play what they want but you should definitely make sure you have all your roles covered if you plan to dungeon/raid as a group, obviously.
---
Or the one that makes you miss like 40% of melee attacks in Ungoro
---
You are really projecting. I hope your day gets better.
---
THERES 0 REASON FOR IT TO BE IN THE GAME
---
Hunter's Mark only makes you visible to the hunter.
---
Faerie Fire makes the target completely unable to stealth.
---
Not all heroes wear capes.
---
Blizzard is retarded then, I'd pay double or triple the current sub price for vanilla or TBC only, not including a retail sub.
---
The common fallacy is we compare the current retail sub price to microtransaction potential and create a straw man argument. No one is asking the market what they're willing to pay for no bullshit microtransactions. I can assure you if Blizzard sees classic as a cash cow again, a conversation can actually happen regarding consumers paying more to keep treadmill skinner box bullshit out.
---
The amount of money I spend on rummaging through trash games is still more than if they doubled or tripled a vanilla subscription.
---

Are you talking about offering to sell items to guildies first or you actually just expect everyone to give anything rare they find away?

I played RS2 from 05-06. I left because I found Vanilla WoW right around it's first anniversary. i went only to play WoW for another 12 years after that.

WoW is less sandbox, more social. It has it's tradeoffs. I'm currently a 2k+ total level, max combat, 2B bank, wave 69 personal best inferno OSRS player. I plan on playing Classic and getting Master clue stat reqs while leveling an Orc Shaman in Classic.
---
My point is: Do it. If you hate it, there's plenty to fall back on in OSRS.
---
I have played on a Surface pro 4 during all of the stress tests without any issues. It does get a little warm after a few hours,  beyond that it should work just fine for gaming whole at work.
---
Considering that Troll Priest is the best Priest (or healer) on Horde I'm not really why you would be kicking yourself in the ass. If you are on the Horde side you aren't competing with Dwarf Priests!
---
82hours in 5 days thats fucking impressive

Use a push to talk so I don't have to hear you crinkling your 32nd candy wrapper of the dungeon or baby crying in the distance because it's being neglected.

You dont have to denigrate the whole thing - as if every youtuber doesnt put out the same old fucking content and plug their Patreon every video, and load the play through up with half a dozen ads.
---
LFR sometimes is harder than normal (pug) and heroic (static). People just want to press W and 1 and kill everything. In BFA I went to LFR to kill Ghuun (after successfully killing it normal with a pug as an orb carrier) because I forgot to do the quest. They had 4 stacks of that buff adding 5% to all stats and still wiped 2 times before I asked a priest to come with me and soloed all the orbs.

Easy there, Dr. Mengele.

I read a quarter, saw dungeon finder, and noped the f out.

---
The longevity of OSRS is largely thanks to the extremely slow power creep. It really helps not having to reset gear every two years, and makes the game feel far more rewarding when the reward is permanent.
---
Yeah, while WoW is $15, OSRS is 🦀$11🦀. So it's not that far off on the price. And really, the WoW sub is 2 games in 1 if retail is something OP is looking for.

Cool story bro.

For all of Vanilla, Gyth dropped a plate helm. 
---
From 1.1 - 1.9 it was called “Skull of Gyth”
---
From 1.10 - 1.12 it was called “Gyth’s Skull”
---
The change was made during the 1.10 dungeon gear buffs that acted as a catch-up mechanic.
---
Troll is the best race available to Priest across both factions.
---
Casual means different things to different people. Some guilds are casual in the sense that they don't raid many hours, yet nevertheless expect a high degree of professionalism to be able to down content within that time frame. Other guild no-life it, but spend a considerable amount of time dicking off and consider that environment "casual". Some guilds use "casual" to describe their progression level, feeling that unless they're raiding Naxx, they're not *really* "hardcore".
---
It's a relative term, everyone is casual compared to someone else, likewise plenty of normies might consider it hardcore to schedule time around a video game in the first place.
---
I've always enjoyed the majority of class quests, even just the very early ones like Priests when you have to heal and fortify a random guard... It really builds the class fantasy, gets you in the mood.
---
Also... Pretty dress from that level 6 quest.
---
What's "what debuff"?
---
Good news for OP: He hates the look of Undead and wants to roll Troll, which is the best Priest race.
---
Friendly reminder to remove all your armor before the Leeroy to avoid a repair bill.

Yoyoyo, chill

I thought that requirements miggt be same as in vanilla, that is why im asking

FINE!

If you're a hunter, druid or shaman its perhaps more tolerable. I just remember getting my mount and quality of life was much improved straight away. 
---
The way I look at it, its getting a little more coin from every mob that skinnable. You're leaving money on the ground at a time when money is very hard to make. Just seems like a no-brainer to me. To each their own though.
---
I plan on being a nightfall hunter if needed.
---
i wish i could remember what server oceanic people played on during vanilla
---
it was one of the pve us servers but no idea which ones 
---
dont think there were oceanic servers till bc but none of the names are familiar
---
guild was reverence i believe , but i was one of the younger players so the 1 guy i still know has kids and stuff now (like i probally should lol)
---
It's a very large amount of fun :D
---
No, the change was made in 1.9.x, and doesn't exist anymore in the 1.12 database.  Look at the [comments](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12952/gyths-skull#comments) saying that they had it in their bank and it changed to have different stats and name.
---
For those looking for a TLDR:
---
I'm a whiney complainer who doesn't understand anything.
---
Nice, do you have that in a better resolution tho? Can't read anything :/
---
Yes you will

Ok horde animal, go roll in the mud more

That's not how the report afk function ever worked though, it puts a debuff on you where if you don't do any PvP action for 2 minutes you're booted off.

you move slower backpedaling so if you backpedal and they are regular walking your gonna have a bad day

4-5 hours weekdays, 8 hours weekends. Gunna no life to 60!

I'll give u a big kiss bby
---
Beta female trolls are where it's at.
---
Horde filth, you're mud huts need more mud
---
It seems like almost nobody answered what you do at 60. Apart from fixing professions almost all the best gear outside of raiding will be obtained in dungeons. Once you decide your class you can look up the "Pre-Raid BiS" that you should try to get.
---
Regarding playing 12-16 hours per day I would just want to point out that there may only so much to do in Phase 1 outside of Raiding. So if you play that much you may end up with your Pre-Raid BiS rather fast and feel a bit bored. The progression of the phases may be balanced around people playing 4-6 hours per day.
---
In short Classic is a marathon not a race, level clases you enjoy and have fun. :)
---
I don't think calling out a company is whining. Do you bend over every time someone tries to scam you?

They never removed attack power.

A new day a new account for you!

I don't know the numbers, but I'd wager the elevator boss has one of the highest kill counts in a video game ever.

"Politics and religion have no place in polite company"

\&gt; Are you kidding me? I PLAYED THE GAME ALREADY IN 2007 IT WORKED FINE.
---
Should have done your research instead of rushing in with your ignorance. They explained perfectly why at the 2018 Blizzcon. And sorry to break this to. They just wanted your money 15 years ago. And people just like you claiming how greedy Blizzard was for charging a monthly fee.
---
I started alliance in classic then my new friends were Horde so I switched in wrath. Then different new friends went alliance and I switched again in Cata. Then I had no more friends and I had alliance till Legion until they had the new races on both sides. Battle for Azeroth got Horde and Alliance for two unique stories and I must say
---
For The Horde!!! All the way. I only play alliance to get the races cause I’m a collector and the story but nothing else.
---
And then to start it up again in classic I kinda want to do both sides for the story but raiding and pvp is all Horde
---
A 14 year old orc?
---
Stoneform is a major reason why I am rolling a troll instead of undead.
---
I've already decided to do a male Troll with a pink mohawk and I'm going to probably loose my shit trying to tame Mazzernache as my questing pet.
---
Well yes, Classic is being released because it will make them money. But that is a win-win. Not trusting Blizzard for X reason, you’re not wrong. But it’s not fair to pretend recreating this without creating a legacy designed mess is unrealistic. The data storage, the compatibility, the standards that Blizzard standardizes nowadays, it’s not fair to just say they’re copy pasting a game likes it nothing. They still pumped this out extremely quickly when they didn’t have to
---
The question is about the opportunity cost of skinning. Instead of skinning 2 mobs, I could have killed another.
---
I don't play bfa or anything related to blizzard
---
Please, keep whining.
---
Youre right because its about blizzard and they suck
---
Even if that was the case (if you've played on any reputable x1 vanilla Pserver in the last two years you would know this), its not about 'lots of bags' its about inventory management. Might be confusing for you, so let me explain.... You have an alt that you mail every single non-essential item in your bags to every time you are in a city near a mailbox, this ensures that your bags will be always empty, also making it so you do not have to fly back to main cities to sell items in AH.
---
Weird concept, right??
---
While Shadowguard is amazing, don't forget the other Priest ability exclusive to trolls: Hex of Weakness!
---
It's a mini Mortal Strike (20% reduced healing instead of 50%), but lasts for 2 minutes instead of 10 seconds. It can only be removed by Druids and Mages and has no cooldown, so Rank 1 (35 mana) can (and should be) applied to all PVP targets.
---
Ya why would anyone downvote you guys. Have a upvote
---
Absolutely agree. Blizzard is garbage
---
Out of curiosity I just took a look at the grey items and there are actually only about 15 grey items that vendor for over 1g and none of them vendor for over 2g. The lowest level one might start dropping around level 45.
---
Thank you for this list. I didn't start in vanilla so these are exactly the type of things I'm interested in.
---
If i wanted it id play on private servers, theres still plenty. This is about principle
---
Fuck i like yalls thinking.
---
Thank you
---
More loot for me
---
I have no idea
---
You seem to not realize that there is a limited number of people you can bring to a raid
---
What?
---
Mmos charged monthly fees since ultima online thats a dumb argument. The current compant blizzard deleted wow and thinks bfa is good and made you wait 2+ years for a 15 year old game while spraying out expansions out of their ass
---
I believe the 6 is out now. I'm guessing it will handle fine if not better. What average fps did you get if you remember.  Anything it struggled with?  Overall do you like system?
---
I can imagine that if the original item was REPLACED, in other words "Skull of Gyth" stopped existing and was replaced by Gyth's skull (even if it was in ones inventory already) that the only version that will be available come Classic will be the Blue Gyth's skull one. It sounds like part of the "progressive itemization" that happened back in the day but instead of being simple stat changes this item had a more detailed makeover.
---
NE warriors have the best two handed sword animations.
---
why would that matter, they would fix it if it didnt? Meld after food would be a commonly known mechanic.

It is extremely good on hunters in combat, warriors can use it to fear and drop combat with it, learn to play my dude.

You could always join a semi-hardcore raid guild as a casual/social member.

This comment chain was about how "*diseases* should last until dispelled".
---
But people sitting at home got private servers running for fairly large playerbases literally alone. Were talking about a major coorporation, its the same game, just more servers and more people
---
 As long as you take damage you are out of stealth instantly. Unless you stand right beside the warlock and manage to time it perfectly to vanish and use an opener when 3-4 dots are ticking, a pet is attacking and the shadow priest or warlock nuking. Not knowing a rogue is there is why you bring the felhunter, to see him from further away.
---
3(136) ÷ (160-136) = x
---
x = 408 ÷ 24 = 17s
---
Or without talents, 390÷30 = 13s
---
Any shorter travel time than that cheetah is better.
---
Without cheetah, 300 ÷ 60 = 5s. Meaning non-hunters should be using mounts pretty heavily.
---
Did nobody responding to this look at this guys name and not immediately see he is trolling. Don't even need to read the post to see this is a throw away troll account.
---
Wait is this like animation sexy or like damnn dat troll gurlll is banging?
---
it would still be good, a hunter can potentially use it twice or more in the same fight, and NELFS as a race will be more hunters than all the others combined (ofcourse excluding druids from the equation for obvious reasons).

I've always felt like horde players are more pvp oriented. Anyone else feel this way? It's why I like horde. Also, do you guys get the feeling that horde players are more mature?

What you guys need to just admit is "yes its a cash grab, yes blizzard is scummy as fuck, but i dont care because i want classic wow"

Thats the truth inside your head

Hi communist China! Seriously though, we don’t do that here. We are free to avoid them or join them. Just follow them to know what server not to pick or to pick if you so desire. Seems like a lot of useless work unless you intent on joining streamer servers with big groups of people and bully them into submission. Which is kind of malicious..

Too bad i'm fasting the first 5 days of Classic. I'm barely gonna be leaving my computer anyways, I don't need the calories. Plus this'll give my body some time to burn the fat I have stored away.
---
I imagine, though, that the team working on Classic isn't near the size as the initial team. And the time required to reverse engineer and replicate the experience isn't as quick as you would believe. From what I recall they are reimplementing the entire game on a much later platform. No small task to say the least, especially if you are attempting to make a profit (which I imagine is the goal).
---
I am literally doing the exact same thing currently with TFT. Hardstuck at plat 1, going between yolo (lose) and serious meta (win).
---
You keep using the words harder or easier yet you don't even define them. Vanilla raids and Retail raids are hard for completely different reasons. Vanilla raids are hard because of the farming you do outside of them as well as the difficulty of directing 40 people. Retail raids are hard because of the actual mechanics during the bossfights. If you scaled a Vanilla raid down to 20 people it would be mind numbingly easy. However, if you scaled a retail raid up to 40 people it would be almost impossible.
---
You're making yourself look silly because you don't even know what you're trying to convey to us.
---
Maybe continue reading then..
---
Well this looks better than the shitshow that first post was. Forcing people to use the addon or get "blacklisted" themselves was going to crash and burn. But this looks okay, even useful. The rest of those addons look great as well!
---
Most people? Wow, what a strong argument you have there mate! I am in awe. Btw you literally wrote in your last paragraph that most dumb of private server loot rules, namely the "any item is an upgrade over no item" - explicitly stating that +2 agi for a warrior vs. +6 int for a caster (or even +2 agi/+6 int for a hybrid) is fair game, so i have no idea what you're talking about with this "no scenario" bullshit. Just own up to the fact that you set out to write some kind of classic loot etiquette guideline, but in the end it turned out that you're no more sensible than MemesOut

Well, he knew where to put it at least...

Bill hader doesn't play classic wow cuz hes not retarded

No punishments for wipes in progress raids (unless intentional or 10+ mistakes in the row). No punishments for wipes on farm (unless intentional or 2+ mistakes in the row).
---
I was playing in semi-hardcore guild aiming for top1k in the world and if we didn't voice our mistakes after a wipe, doesn't matter if it did lead to a wipe, or just a mistake, we would never achieve anything. People should hear what mistakes are possible and try to learn on others.
---
Same here. WoW accomplishments make me feel so much better than osrs accomplishments.
---
Dark leather gear. Hillman's shoulders, toughened leather gloves, barbaric bracers, dusky gear, Nightscape (Tunic, Headband, Shoulders) are super common leveling items. These are sub level 40 items and that's when you have hunters and rogues both wanting these items desperately and these items aren't bad for warriors/shammies either. For gear above 40 it's not so simple though but up to then it's actually great assuming you can time the market well. Like be ready with the items before the demand starts peaking meaning you will have to level up faster then the early pack and grind out the skills points while you do it.
---
I had to make a throw away account to speak my mind thats how toxic this sub is. Im legit scared to post this on my main
---
By Server/Race changes do you mean actually changing the server or race of your character? I can imagine that the "traditional" server change system will become available at some point-in other words you pay a certain amount of RL cash to blizzard and are able to transfer to another server. There was conditions though such as characters from PvE servers could only transfer to PvE realms whereas players from PvP servers could go to either. I think at some point free character transfers were offered to certain realms but I can't remember as to why it happened or whether it will occur again.
---
I can't imagine changing your race will be a thing come Classic. If they are serious about maintaining the authentic classic feel then that is not an acceptable option.

The addon is completely agnostic to the types of players users wish to Blacklist. If a toxic streamer or otherwise undesirable player ends up on their server and the community wishes to drive them off, this addon can help do it, but only if that community decides to work together.
---
There absolutely can be dungeons eaven love level ones. Problem is what item level should dropp? Better then MC? Worse? If better why would any one run mc and if worse why would any one run the dungeon? And secondly blizzard have followed the same model for the game sins launch a couple of patches whit new end game content and then an expansion that ppl have to buy to play the new content. What reason do the vast majority of players have to pay the extra mony for the exception if all they get is an extra dungeon or 2?

-This post brought to you by /r/wowcirclejerk
---
That server would be a blood bath.
---
Excellent call out to that comment, which I missed. 
---
I think your answer is clearly definitive. 
---
The blue “Gyth’s Skull” version will be available from launch.
---
Thankfully that previously announced feature was removed within 24 hours of the original post in favor of a much better more useful tool.
---
Sub today so you can test addons and setup bindings during the Stress Test!
---
I see questions like this all the time, how poor are you guys? If you have serious financial problem I'd hope you could adress them before "dedicating your lives to Classic"! ;)
---
Quality response there my dude!
---
ehhh, idc tbh. i normally play horde and do on retail, but like most people i’ve talked to are going alliance for classic.
---
And bone reavers egde was shit on release but lo and behold, every item will have the 1.12 stats.
---
Mara comes on launch to, guess this game is doa After all.
---
Why dont you go and do something productive with your time instead of shit posting on reddit? Or is the minus karma your fetish?
---
Another menial skill I would do at work. In reference to fishing,  among other things,  is the touch screen usable to fish? Target things on a hunter with a tap then walk away with pet + auto to kill?
---
Read the post again, and probably 2 or 3 more times.  It's all there man, I'm sorry you can't see it.
---
You bring up that you have years of raiding experience and some of them have never played wow, yet they are opting for the most efficient way to level on launch &amp; are telling you not to play what is possibly the single worst dps spec in PvE. If they want to play at least somewhat optimally you can't blame them for anything that they've said. Sounds like you might need to find a more casual guild.
---
We know that the quest for rune of the guard captain will be in from launch based on the fact that the quest was available in 2004/2005.
---
The Hunter quest for Lok'delar/Rhok'delar was an amazing touch by Blizzard. A nice questline that required you to use your skills as a hunter to overcome the demons you were tasked to kill. Can't wait to have another crack at it!
---
I think that was more of a targeting thing. You’d get too close and the boss would have to turn around or move to continue hitting you.
---
Back in the day while tanking I’d just move around while still facing the boss to reposition them.
---
I think you’re just over-simplifying it. Blizzard doesn’t really have an option to copy that Mangos core that PServers have been building off for so long, nor is mangos correct in a lot of areas.
---
This leaves their best option with using their own stuff. That becomes messy because of how old it is. It’s on old databases which gets hairy since data is just stored differently, nothing they used is compatible with any modern system, and worst of all, copy pasting legacy now just creates a bigger issue later of now your 15 year old game needs to be fixed when it’s now 30 years out of date (Assuming someone wanted to fix it later down the line, which would have to happen)
---
So they need to modernize all of the backend, and make everything on the front end look and feel the same. It’s actually a pretty respectable project, they didn’t take the lazy route. It also creates tons of room for bugs and errors, which totally justifies a beta (Beta definitely should have had more players still)
---
It's a test to see how mature, patient and communicative you are. Everyone can say the were Rank 14 and cleared Naxx, it's harder to fake not being a child.

My usual combo is tailoring and skinning, lots of recipes use a little bit of leather and it helps out big time being able to make those items or bags for yourself or a friend without needing the AH for a few hides
---
Huh... I've never frozen my meals before and I don't know why I've never thought of that. And I'm almost 30. Fucking hell.
---
This subreddit is weird af.  Enjoy the journey, take your time posts, then threads like these are filled with do not take Skinning because it slows you down. You know what will slow you down? Majority of the players being in the same zone as you. Be ahead of the pack recommendations is silly, because that requires knowing an established route and you will be competing with people who done the route several times on private servers, optimizing it to perfection. Advising this to somebody who doesn't even know if Skinning is worth it is beyond ridiculous. He will end up frustrated by seeing others way ahead despite trying his best then ends up with no gold to buy a mount...and this is when he quits the game.
---
Fully agree with this!
---
Definitely is a pretty vague area. Set bonuses technically ARE from items, but they aren't "white text" in that sense so it's hard to tell.
---
Right so you are willing to accept the response you know you will get but are afraid to do it on your actual account. Why would it matter what account you do it on if you know the response you will get? Worried about reddit karma or something literally nothing changes if you make this on your real account or not beside looking like an obvious troll.
---
To help your comparison, once software is built, it doesn’t really matter how many copies exist. You gave examples of hardware where they could still have production problems. It’s even better for blizz than the other companies listed.
---
Grow up, be a man, and stop cowing to your “friends” like some pathetic worm?

Goldshire/Elwynn Forest would have to be an RP server.
---
&gt;Have weekly mandatory farming days. (I.e. Everyone must log like its a raid and meet to farm chimera steaks in felwood. Something like that. This also keeps players engaged and from becoming raid loggers.)
---
Unless you set a drop to 0 dkp for no show all you will be the only actually showing up. Not counting ones who do their farm themselves and aligning schedules by accident.

Mandatory stuff never works. Especially when it's about giving gold or spending time not doing raids.

I can’t believe *Sap*
---
Oh ffs at least let me *blind*
---
I guess my point is made :)
---
Nah that was the other guy.
---
So I’ll have like half a month to customize my character?
---
Set bonuses don't, that I'm sure of. Only white, nothing else is what I remember.
---
And my axe.
---
You're suggesting that a 2 minute cooldown on a Stealth that does not allow you to move or take an action of any kind without it instantly breaking, would be a perfectly viable racial along side the likes of Stoneform, Berserking, Hardiness, and War Stomp?
---
Oh I get to cleanse a whole array of poisons and bleeds and diseases every 2 minutes and get bonus armour, what can you do?
---
Oh I can... Uh... Sit around and ambush some guy in the FR once every 2 minutes. It's great, but sometimes people come when it's on CD :(
---
Not often I give a flat disagreement, but sorry no. Rofl. Shadowmeld as it is in Classic would suck dick if it had a 2 minute CD.
---
Fat quality tho
---
Pushing the boss back without turning it is the key here
---
And there you go. I'm going to stack up on items like these and bleed removers like luffa. Don't need cloak of shadows because i'll be using my own homemade cloak of fuck you
---
its not about that. fast food is the best food. its just that domino is shit pizza compared to others
---
I mean if it's anything like it was they'll have tons of servers. Pve servers, PvP servers, rp servers, rppvp servers. I'm not really sure what their current plans are but they're gonna need a lot of servers to take the huge influx of players.
---
Yep you’ll get in
---
Anyone that has a sub should get in.
---
&gt;to ensure the guild always has consumables
---
why would guild need consumables if everyone already are brining it for themselves?
---
&gt;builds relationships so people play better together
---
there's a thing called raids. The actual activity people joined your guild to do. On schedule, with team based mechanics and to spend 3-6 hours together with a lot of strangers building relationships. If you don't think enough value in this, then leading roles in team oriented games may not be for you. In real life as well.
---
You should be able to download the client now to sign in tomorrow.

Polymorph... let me just walk around as a sheep while you arcane power + POM + trinkets + pyroblast me for 3000+ damage. You know that feeling as a warrior when you’re about to charge the mage and halfway through the charge and you’re dead? And then the mage comes up to you and makes a bag of tea in your mouth with their sack.
---
Yes. Best to quickly create your character on August 12 right when Name Reservation begins without any care to appearance or even class or faction. Then many days later, at a time that when most of your region is sleeping, delete those characters and remake them how you want.
---
pretty sure feral was broken throughout the whole expansion. and they fucked up hunters in the ass, so there's that
---
You are correct-10 second cooldown and can only be used when you're out of combat. In the version of Classic were getting any action will break Shadowmeld but you can eat/drink while shadowmelded. In the older patches you were able to start casting and remain in SM until the cast was complete (example Hunters with aimed shot) but that won't be the case in this patch sadly.
---
Great uses for it are AFK'ing safely while out and about, guarding flags/nodes in BGs, setting up ambushes in World PvP, reducing your aggro radius against mobs (enemies will have to get a lot closer to you before aggroing when you're in SM, very useful when soloing dungeons) and my favourite use is resetting an enemy rogue's combo points.
---
I think that's what I'm gonna do. Get them bags because bag space is such a premium. Gonna really hurt not having 600 slot bags anymore.

---
You value exp over gold, the person you are talking to values exp per hour less than you. Different people have different priorities.
---
I actively murder hunter pets in pvp.
---
Accurate
---
You use it as a DKP bonus. It also can server as a way for newer members to catch up DKP wise. Another thing is this can be a simple 30min farm session. Like my example on chimera island 20 ppl can farm a lot of steak in 30min.  The other purpose this serves is it allows guildies who might not interact a lot have a chance to get a dialogue going. As raid convos are kept to a minimum, this can be seen as a free time for open talk.
---
Looking on Classic Wowhead, it appears that there are enough Stormwind quests to get you another 10k rep by level 60. So if you completed all of those quests, along with most of the other Alliance faction quests for spillover rep, it’s very possible that you could reach exalted with Stormwind by 60 without needing any (or very few) Runecloth turn-ins.
---
Good lad
---
Blackrock was the unofficial PvP server and Proudmore was the unofficial PvE one.     
---
    
---
Spinebreaker sort of became one as well after Blackrock became a laggy queue fest.  
---
Then of course later on Frostourne and Khazgoroth were the first of the servers labelled oceanic (but still actually just US servers).

No, only the base armor on items gets multiplied by Bear Form.
---
All of the above with the exception of rppvp have been confirmed. It sounds unlikely that we get RPPVP on launch at this point as the devs don't seem to think their will be a large enough playerbase to support it.

Similar to retail, no need to write scripts if you don't want to.

&gt;The only reason they even considered this is because private servers had an audience and they saw dollar signs.

I mean most of your post is just a giant rant, but this part is spot on. Private servers are the reason we're getting classic. Despite what people seem to think on this sub.
---
Based on my experience with private servers, I don't think it'll be that bad.  What I'm afraid will be annoying though is people wiping groups because they do stupid things and then brushing it off by saying "Huhuh, this isn't retail guys, huhuh."  I've encountered that so much and it's soooooooo annoying.
---
Realistically, I don't see them changing it. The amount of processing power to render dynamic text as opposed to scrolling text at that scale is probably insane.
---
honestly i think alliance is just less interesting, and i think that's the primary reason for the haters
---
we're all humans (hopefully) and you want to roll a human in this escapism video game? ok
---

Yes.

How'd they delete wow when they recovered 1.12 from an archive

Yeah that last point kinda makes sense but idk when I was a kid I liked to imagine that I was my character and that I could cast spells and shit.
---
Almost all of the new macro capabilities from Retail are in Classic and none of the Vanilla macro commands will work. One big exception is /focus. Focus-like targeting/frame addons existed in Vanilla, but worked on capabilities no longer available in the addon API. In TBC, Blizzard released their own version of Focus, with addon and macro support, but Classic won't have it. I really hope an addon developer figures out a way to recreate /focus, but so far it's not looking possible.

Gta is a totally different game to rp with the open voice chat. Plus just a different game in general. Popular streamers will flock to popular servers and all the followers will join them asap. Rp PvP wouldn’t be as popular as normal pvp severs and that’s what I want
---
No idea. For my needs I paid too much for the tablet functions I don't use.

Dude, Legion was amazing, I really miss how our characters felt in that expansion. Plus Stormheim as a zone is simply amazing, and the music... I got Howling Fjords feels all the way. Loved it 100%
---
I think you could clear all that up to Naxx in 3.5 or 4 hours. Naxx speed clears are usually like 1.5 or 2 hours themselves and I don’t the average guild speed running is going to be doing the balls hard MC/BWL 30 min clear strays
---
There is literally a place called, "The Valley of Trials", and last time I checked there are 8 playable races.
---
It’s similar to the issue of mass reporting to get someone a temp-bann, it’s creating exploitable tools. 4 friends and a pug join a group, and the pug wins a weapon that the hunter wanted. 4 reports being “Published” to blacklist the pug, well that sucks. They now need to justify it to anyone who asks why they’re on the blacklist :/

For PVE troll is better? Is this true, I have always thought the opposite...
---
Can second lemonparty.org as a great newbie resource.
---
Agreed. Also I think a lot of "hardcore" guilds will chill out a little once the grind sets in. Anyone can talk a big game and say you'll all be leveled up and clearing MC in the first few weeks.
---
Nice and simple. I like it. Thanks!

Male dwarf priests - grey hair, uber beard - always felt like classic 'ye olde grandpa' characters to me.

I'm not sure what you mean by Horde quest? It was the same quest for either faction.
---
Well wotf is nice in certain raid encounters.  But generally berzerking is something you can use.  It’s not much but it’s more than undead provides in most raid environments
---
this isnt 2004. people arent rolling nelf because they just watched lord of the rings. the informed enthusiast audience which makes up the majority of the people interested in vanilla know in most matchups horde racials will win the day in world pvp on a pvp server.
---
\#nochanges will doom the game to faction imbalance unless alliance racials are buffed or all racials are removed.
---
This is such a great post,
---
People have another thing coming if they think people truly casually playing the game are hitting level 60 within the first few months. Even the most lax raid schedule is almost still an oxymoron, good luck getting 40 people to commit to 2 let alone 3 nights a week. And even if you do? Pre Bis / consumables? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

I played horde on fenris for a bit Kiriel and Professor Oak
---
There skin though seems pretty tough and oof they wear no shoes, seems to get pretty grodie lol horde is basically Orcs. Lol Orcs wear clothes hah

horde locks too. cant wait to roll my orc and have a reliable defence that 50% of the opposite faction cant break and become immune to at will.

Bought most skills, and bought all LW patterns up to like 240.

The only way that player gets Blacklisted by anyone other than those 4 friends is if someone is subscribed to a Blacklist from one of those 4. The realm community can create a Blacklist that only gets added to by democratic vote over Discord and is held accountable through transparency. Attempts to abuse the trust of your Blacklist subscribers will quickly mean all of them unsubscribing.
---
I actually thought and felt (kinda still do) the exact same you do, compared to most others on this sub (obviously their acting their age). 
---
Too bad you made a throw away account to feel this way. What are you afraid of?
---
Honestly, tier 1 ( lawlbringer)  is fantastic for pvp.
---
Uh, this is Classic WoW. No flying.
---
It’s one of those “I’m very smart, smarter than everyone else so I don’t get scammed” kind of person
---
A time based thing. They haven’t really committed to anything that I’ve seen though. Could be weeks could be months. Who knows.
---
Forsure. If you do carry out, you can get a large 3 topping for 7.99. With 50% it comes out to be like 7.80 or something stupid. It's only worth on specialty pizzas. But also, some specialty pizzas fuck you. Like a hawaiin... You can get it cheaper ordering all the toppings. Same with BBQ chicken pizza.  Really, the specialty pizzas only become cost effective at like 5 items.

Some 13 years ago in vanilla I had an casual experience I'll never forget. I was in Scarlet Monastery with a group of late-night randos from /1, and our tank was this Troll warrior. He was really chill in chat and seemed laid back as hell. He had spent hours tanking us through all wings of SM. Near the end of the session we were all just chatting and I said:
---
"&lt;Trollname&gt;, dude thanks for helping us, you're cool as fuck. But I gotta ask, what's up with the pink hair?"
---
*... "It's Fuscia, cuz."*
---
I went horde after being in alliance for years. Needless to say I hated every moment of it, and transferred back months later
---
Ahh ok yeh its the same for either faction-you get the ancient petrified leaf from the Majordomo chest, go to felwood and there's three tree spirits that give the questlines.
---
But you expect everyone to have bis gear for their level and legit specs. Also you're full on druids.
---
I work there. Fuck their pizza. It's little caesars that delivers.
---
The bluest of all balls.
---
Whooooosh

depends how many beasts you kill on the way
---
Login and create char, cant play
---
Very funny. You crazy person, you...
---
Oh. You're serious?
---
That’s a good point the other two I mentioned seem really against the intended “rules” of the game
---
Give me statistics to show everyone uses AH add-ons or shut the fuck up, how about that?
---
Gotcha makes sense. Thanks bud.
---
10/10 healers. Only need 2 tanks out of 40 but you need 8+ healers.
---
You get hks for assisting with kills as well, most honor comes from winning bgs not the hks
---
It's almost certainly logging into the Classic client, choosing one of the launch realms, and creating the character. There's no reason for Blizzard to develop and publish a different unique method.
---
i like the design philosophy of vanilla but im not anti QOL either, a dungeon finder, for example is not the worst idea cuz i remember spamming chat for hours trying to get a pug together. i also liked flying mounts especially for gathering skills haha.  
---
but i think the arena focus that TBC went down ultimately lead us down the path to water down the game into the "balanced" state that everyone hates in current expansions.
---
Excellent counter argument. I especially liked calling him out for using the buzzwords that you seem to always see in "BFA BAD" posts. Keep up the good work
---
I thought so — can’t wait to do Molten Core again.
---
Alliance only. :(
---
Here is some more down votes, clearly you just want to farm them
---
I disagree. Most guilds have 4 tanks and way less people play tank than healer
---
You wish
---
Have fun!
---
DM at 18? You mean VC?
---
You're right, I assumed that was Thursday Australia time :(
---
2 main tanks and 2 fury warriors with prot gear or a feral. Sounds like OP wants to main tank.
---
Yeah I had this concern too. Rppvp would be my ideal server but I didn't wanna accidentally spend 3 months on a dead server
---
How can someone miss the point twice and this bad..... you truelly surprise me..
---
Sorry to burst your bubble I got a little excited too

Let's say Mr Warrior is using a 2.7 speed weapon.      His atk speed with Flurry is 2 seconds.  
---
So, let's say he is attacking every 1.5 second.  1/5 swings will proc WF, so he gets a WF proc every 7.5 seconds. 
---
94.5 atk power / 14 atk power / dps \*2.7 = 18.225 dmg  (This is how much damage imp wf is adding to your WF swing)
---
18.225 dmg / 7.5 sec = 2.43 dps

I'm sorry, but if you are asking reddit for advice on how to run/form a guild you might be in for a rough time.
---
Luckily you are living in 2019 and people have been running guilds for decades. Here's the main stuff  you need to square away:
---
 * Set up a discord server with roles, raid sign up channel/voice etc. Write introduction message (to 'hook' people into applying) , rules, loot system, faq etc. 
---
* Start recruiting. Make a recruitment post and spam it all over. Continously. You then have to go through applications and invite suitable people. This is a never ending process that will last 2 years. 
---
* Figure out which members are officer material. You need to weed out the incompetent, the inept, the socially disabled, the guys without the time commitment available, and worst of all, the fucking lootwhore officers who only get their role to get prio on loot. Good officers that you can trust is the backbone of the guild, and you are starting without any. 
---
* Find an experienced raid leader *or* learn all the fights/mechanics/assignments yourself and do the raid leading. Not many people are good GMs, not many good people are raid leaders. Few are both. 
---
* Get the backend sorted out, set up LC spreadsheet, raid assignment spreadsheet, guild banking etc. Will get easier as you get more officers.
---
And that's just the start. The real work starts when you have to get 40 people together for raiding and keep them all happy. This is the biggest challenge of classic.
---
Of course you can run your own guild. Some people have that capacity, carisma, intellect and knowledge, but you are in for it when starting out solo and have to find an officer team first. 
---
However, do not let this or any other shit people might say dissuade you, if your dream is to go be the GM of your own guild, then forge ahead. Perserverence and dedication will take you far, but you have a journey ahead of you.
---
If you need help with raid assignments sheet or discord shoot me a pm.
---
&gt;  how much easier alliance raiding is to horde
---
Oh, so let's start with Ulduar, as that was the first real challenge, and work our way forward for world firsts.
---
Horde: Ulduar, ToC, ICC, BWD, BoT, Tot4W, Firelands, MSV, HoF, ToES, ToT, SoO, Highmaul, Blackrock Foundry, HFC, Emerald Nightmare, ToV, Nighthold, Tomb of Sargeras, Antorus, Uldir, BoD, Eternal Palace
---
Alliance: Ruby Sanctum, Dragon Soul
---
Hmm.. So how is it easier if the cutting edge guilds roll the horde for a clear advantage with racials when pertaining to PvE? 
---
Currently, the only guilds with Mythic Azshara down, and there are 11 of them, are all Horde. 
---
There are 40 guilds that are 7/8. Of those 40, 5 of them are Alliance. 
---
So literally, out of the top 51 guilds in the world, 5 are Alliance. 
---
Fact check your shit.
---
There are dozens of us! I started at 8 years old around the middle of TBC... Got it from my family but I took it a lot further then them even then. When Wotlk released I promptly made a DK that I decided to twink at 60 (really odd but hey, I was a kid). I pugged vanilla raids weekly (minus Naxx) during WotLK on said DK - I definitely remember them being still hard at the time given I would just invite anyone who was level 60 or higher with varying amounts of people Often even level 80s would underestimate twin emps or the eye phase of C'thun, thinking that it'll just be a tank and spank because they were 80 in a 60 raid.
---
Anyway, one of my in game friends (who, as I remember, was a family man), mentioned that if I ever got eye of sulfuras he'd make me the sulfuron hammer pro bono. Well... Next MC raid it dropped and I, being raid leader, on master loot, at 9 years old, ninjad the shit out of it when I saw it. And of course, I got Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros promptly after having the help lined up (who may or may not have known of my unsavory looting of said eye at the time). After a month or so of having it I turned leveling back on and quit after LFG released because I thought it kinda ruined the social experience.
---
10 years later (like 2 weeks ago) I recovered that account and merged it with my regular bnet account. I regret ever leveling it and I don't think I could backlevel it but I might ask bliz nicely.
---
So I have some serious nostalgia for the raid content of MC, the leveling from BC and death knights.

Gnome mage looking for hardcore guild on a US pvp server (am disabled and unemployed so I’ll be on most hours of the day). No experience with vanilla, joined in tbc and also played some mop/legion. Will show high level of dedication and commitment.
---
Even if it "turned" it wasn't actually facing away.  You couldn't push a mob back and backstab it back then, even though it was "facing away" from you.  It was just a way for bosses to back up.  That's what I'm curious about.  On p-servers (and on live) you walk into a boss, they'll just stand there and even turn around if you run through them.  
---
Was hoping for some confirmation on if bosses just backed up on the classic beta.

No but seriously, do you label everything you disagree with as a shit post? Is this your version of calling everyone a liberal?
---
roughly half of your raid damage will be auto attacks. It depends on your spec and gear and weapons of course but generally 50%
---
From what I recall (I played holy paladin all thru WoW but mainly PvP vanilla/BC) healing gets tracked as well as damage in BG’s, you’ll get most of your honor from winning BG’s though. You can still get kills as a healer but find yourself a strong dps buddy and basically be his heal bot :) I had a ton of fun in BG’s healing my boy who was a sick warrior. We got gladiator s3 in BC was actually a lot of fun.
---
I’m rolling warrior this time around just because I’ve paid my dues healing but hope this helped !
---
Imagin actually having bag space for this.

Good bot

More than likely you will log in to the client, and then pick a server, and pick your 3 names on a character selection screen.

&gt; The crude divorce rate (divorces per 1,000 Australian residents) rose in the 1960s and 1970s and peaked at 4.6 per 1,000 resident population after the introduction of the Family Law Act 1975, which came into operation in January 1976 and allowed no-fault divorce. 
---
&gt; The divorce rate started trending down in the 2000s. In 2016 it was 1.9, the lowest rate since 1976. It rose slightly in 2017 to sit at 2.0.

WHAT CAME OUT IN 2004? IS IT SAFE TO SAY VANILLA WOW SAVED THE ~~WORLD~~ MARRIAGES? 
---
I think so.
---
I left vanilla because my Co-GM left and ninjad months of work from our guild bank after stalling in AQ40, he left to top server guild to push Naxx while literally breaking our guild apart as he slammed the door behind him. Was tough to handle as a freshman in college with bigger fish to fry and weeks of /played time flushed. Took me until wrath to build my bridge and get over it
---
If a big streamer is on the server, they have more than enough support to ever bother with such petty people using this add-on. As for the people using the it, it will reduce the pool of players who they can group up with by a large margin to the point they will be having way longer queues and either remove the add-on or swap servers.   
---
Thinking you can remove a streamer is laughable when someone like asmongold can fill a server by himself with his twitch chat alone.
---
I was very active in the game and had what I considered lots of friends back in the day, but I haven’t yet seen one person on my old server I recognize.  Not here or the other sites where people try to reconnect.
---
I've been a Horde main since Vanilla with the exception of a few lvl 1-20 Alliance alts and a brief faction-change stint in Wrath of the Lich King (My server was 5:1 A:H, so I thought changing to Alliance would mean faster group pugs. It did not, not at all. No idea why.) I have always felt that Horde was just more interesting to play, visually. "If I want to be a human, I can logoff and go pay some bills", that sort of mindset. But I am going to roll Alliance for Classic.
---
I want a fresh experience. I don't want to just re-make my old character from scratch all over again, I want to finally take the plunge and see the other side of the story. Especially in Classic, where the Alliance has all the major story-beats on its side. Onyxia, Thuarassian, etc. Classic was Alliance's playground, storywise, and I want to see what that was like.
---
I plan to play a Gnome Warrior, and nobody can stop me.
---
Now that you mention it, I think he got it at like 53/4. Must’ve been in AV 24/7 since the 50-59 bracket was almost always dead.
---
Ya I mean arena was fun back then, but also broken lmao. I think they made the rewards too good... it went from being a fun competitive side gig to wow being revamped with an arena focus.  Idk what the right or wrong way to fix it but I just knew that TBC was a ton of fun.
---
Retail is free up to level 20, but I have no idea if that counts
---
Maybe people don't want the constant gear grind @60 to be competitive in BGs ?
---
Also, and I know it's a side topic, have you ever considered that you might be a bit of an asshole? Just a thought.

Why make an encryption addon that shares the keys using blizzards servers, it's basically designing it with a MITM flaw.

No I won't be using any guide because it's A: part of the vanilla experience and B: I'm not a Zoomer who can't figure stuff out himself and needs everything spoonfed to him.

If you dont mind grinding mobs you could do that in a different zone if stv is too crowded, but if youre not into grinding mobs you could try dungeon leveling. Just make sure you have a group thats planning on running the instance multiple times. If you only run once or twice and then the group disbands its not that worth it. If you chain the same instance runs together it saves a ton of time if youre not waiting on people to walk to the instance all the time

Yeah, no chance signal or black market will be allowed or they would be used by every gold buyer/seller and undermine the games auction house, I'd be the first to report these as against the terms.
---
If it keeps you alive, yes.  
---
Also, in what world do you only get 400 hp from LHW?  0 sp/healing and lvl 36 rank of the spell?
---
12 healers in a raid, and like 3 tanks.    However, the raid will have like 8 warriors, and most of them will want to be DPS.
---
Quests in WoW are kind of like slayer tasks in OSRS.
---
It's very unrealistic to assume that a user's Blacklist would become so large as to negatively affect their play experience in finding groups.
---
But the opposite WILL happen. A streamer like Asmongold will only ever be able to group with his fans, they're the only ones that will see his chat, they're the only ones that will buy his auctions, and they're the only ones that will join his group. It will greatly reduce his success on the server. It's unlikely that those fans will be anymore than tourists on that realm, certainly not all level 60.
---
Yeah, but fart clouds doe
---
/u/Soapbox  For math sake that's why I said "an item everyone could use". In a situation like a healer item drops, we would have a healer count per guild plus you, and say it's 8 healers, 1 is you, 5 from my guild (#2-6), 2 from the other (#7-8).  I'd /roll 1-8, if it landed 2-6 I choose based on our loot rules what our guild decides to do with it.  Same would go for tank and dps gear. It happens fast and pretty seemless.
---
We don't want you anyway. Bye felicia
---
No, I don't own BfA.  I'm not home at the moment, so I can't check to confirm that the Classic client is available.
---
So if someone doesn’t like scheduled consumable farming they shouldn’t play team based games? You must realize how ridiculous that position is. I’d never join a guild that forced me to be in Felwood at X time to farm consumables, nor would most of this community, but we love the hell out of dungeons, raiding, team PvP, all the things that actually require teamwork. Farming is not one of those things, and it sounds like you approach WoW as a job instead of a hobby.
---
You think you do, but you don't.

... oh wait!

Perfect. Exactly.

Neither of these addons breaks any of the terms in Blizzard's EULA, nor is there a clear method for you to report addons. Blizzard also can't ban an addon (they've tried in the past) from being used on the client, they can only restrict the API to break the addon's functionality.

Naxx will probably come out next summer or fall. The community seems prettty split about future after that. People who play private servers are happy to get “fresh” vanilla servers, some people want more level 60 content, some want TBC straight up and others want a modified TBC
---
Iirc they didnt not roll it in, they ensured it was out. To make it as vanilla like as possible.

Back when reckful was cool he only had strafe left and right bound and toggled on and off auto run whenever he wanted to move forward!
---
I bet you will be able to level in two weeks and farming the blue BIS is a necessity for Molten Core. I'm sure you can farm 200gold and hour while grinding. World PvP are like duels, epic fights between hundreds of players and it's not just random ganking. 
---
Have fun rushing to 60. This game is nothing more than 150 hours of leveling, gear check and resist gear raids, 3 battleground. 
---
Your in for a disappointment if you think your going to get Grand Marshall with skills and min-maxing. This game is nothing more than a long grind.
---
During the stress test I went over to have a look and can confirm she has her old voice and model, as well as Varimathras.
---
Yup this is how I remember it
---
&gt; you'll have a split player base with the majority being the streamers viewers
---
No, I don't accept this premise. Even on the beta and stress tests, the number of followers of any given streamer was a very small minority.
---
While we do have promotional plans for these addons, we believe they will become widely adopted based on their own merits. Many of these addons have no competition and provide unique and powerful capabilities to their users. Those users will all have heard of Blacklist, which in itself is just a more powerful Ignore feature (the in-game ignore feature has a numerical limit and only blocks chat, duels, and mail).
---
Like I've said previously, we're only providing the tools. It's up to a realm's community to decide how to use them and to what effect/success.
---
To bad they still charge three fucking dollars to deliver. Local pizza shop that is rough 5x as good is free. Newmens own frozen pizza is incredible and can be sitting in your freezer before classic even starts.
---
Side note. Highly recommend Newman's own pizza, holy light is it good.
---
We don't know for sure. If it's a huge success they may follow the path of Old School RuneScape and extend the game further. Classic WoW will come in several month long phases, not to mention it takes time to achieve everything, and raids are limited 1/week, raid boss drops are 2-3 items per death.
---
Correlation does not equal causation

Username checks out

word bro. You can tell most of the developer effort in vanilla went into 1-60 than end game though.
---
Priests can bubble. Locks could summ a VW and bubble. Or you could wear any trinket that gives a shield.
---
It might be, it depends on how the consumables scale with spell power. Its a lot of extra gold for a few more percent of dps. But if youre min maxing its an option. Also keep in mind of the max amount of buffs is 32 in vanilla as far as we know, so that might affect how you use your available consumable choices. I dont know if recent pservers have this limit in place or not or if it was hotfixed in 1.12 at some point. Time will tell if anything once classic is out and people test it at lvl 60

Even though you've already made up your mind, I won't hurt to take a look at this little gem: http://www.imtwelve.com/1883-lock-builds-from-in-depth-warlock-talent-guide
---
I agree that SM/Ruin is the most suited for you, since it gives you the best of both worlds; I spend most of vanilla playing that spec and it performed admirably!
---
I can hear this icon.
---
Kings honor

There was definitely oceanic servers in vanilla. Don't remember them all but I played on Khaz'Goroth (pve). The big one was Frostwolf(PvP) I think. I think there we're a couple more too. Towards the end of vanilla Dath'Remar(pve) was added as well.
---
He looks like Ethan from h3h3
---
Oh man, I am so ready to run battlegrounds as a furbolg again.
---
In classic size actually does matter, a good number of horde characters cannot walk through the gap in the dwarven bunkers for instance. Female humans and downward in size can however
---
im totally for a dungeon finder in classic but a flying mount wont work in vanilla.
---
Gilneas
---
Coward.
---
Silence is worse imo (as caster, obv)
---
I would play retail then, reta raids are more interesting than they've ever been in vanilla. Vanilla wow raiding isnt that interesting tbh. Its "challenging" in a numbers way at first but eventually itll be easy and uninteresting.
---
Blizzard will not be able to read the contents of messages they intercept and log. Yes, they can modify the contents, but this is highly unlikely as they'd have to do it in real-time. In any case, the message would appear garbled to the recipient and would alert both users that their messages are being intercepted and modified.
---
i used this baby back then.  until i spilt lemonade all over it  =(
---
Does that pertain to classic? Sure doesn't look like it.
---
Exactly lol it's been 8 expacs and both are still fighting like before
---
“I can definitely do it 6 days played with a guide easy”
---
Dudes..speed runners set records on pristine conditions with a lot of practice. This is fresh classic. Even with layers it’s going to mayhem. Plus you’re going to be distracted by things (because this game is amazing and there’s a million things to do).
---
 I think most people should be adding at least 2 days played to their mental math.
---
Lmao
---
Plus then you can try and focus humanoid targets and just farm cloth without having to waste time on a profession.
---
There weren't any physical servers based in Oceania, but there were a few servers 'named' as Oceanic servers in the game (so we still copped between 180-300ms). These were announced as new realms: Frostmourne, Khaz'Goroth, Aman'Thul etc. Originally, Blackrock was THE server for Oceanic players and it had a solid mix of Aussies and Americans.
---
I can give you my input as a normal high school kid in 2006. The alliance were the fantasy geeks, horde was for the edgy kids who thought they were cool. I was horde, less edgy now, still not cool.
---
Where do I put in my order for a custom addon to the NR group? Pricing can be discussed privately.
---
I think people confuse single grey items with stacks. there are a bunch of grey stackable items in STV that sell for multiple gold per stack, but a stack takes a lot longer to obtain than a single grey item.
---
Yeah I remember the ping, I don't think I went below 300  for all of vanilla. That's why I ended up on a pve server, PvP was just awful with ping between 300-500. Thanks Aussie internet!
---
Didn't realise OP meant physical servers, my b!
---
The hardest choices require the strongest will.
---
Really loved fps like wolfenstein and battlefield that promoted and rewarded class play. Later on games like call of duty made classes matter much less. Class play definitely promoted teamwork which in turn equaled more fun imo
---
This is really funny. Serious question though: is there a subreddit or website that I can find guild recruitment? Thanks!
---
Ofcourse you don't, it goes against what you are trying to spew... its quite clear how far you are reaching when you use a closed beta or a sub required stress test as an example of streamer popularity..    
---
I'll be sure to use your add-ons to dodge blizzard when selling gold, I'm sure they won't break it if its being used by majority gold sellers and buyers...
---
Why not 12345 q e r f g c v ?
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ccqoho/movement_speed_overview/etscrgs/
---
No, you just don't understand how it works, lookup man in the middle attacks and key exchange, if you understood the basics like the limitations of diffie-hellman, then you would see why your signal has the exact same issue.
---
&gt; Foreman's Blackjack
---
Next up is the Foreman's Blackjack. This does a slap animation and makes a thwack noise. You can use this to pretend to slap NPC's, players, the alliance, etc. You get this from Foreman Thazz'ril in Durotar, the orc and troll starter zone, in the valley of trials. It has a very short cooldown of just a few seconds. You can even target yourself to play the sound and animation. Slap away.  
---
I've tested and confirmed this does not work in Classic.
---
Next year ? Vanilla lasted for over 2 years and was even cut abruptly at the end.
---
Why would they rush it that fast.
---
I can second this, but let me change Booty Bay to anywhere with Goblins/Gnomes. I get it in Ratched, Rusty Rocket, Booty Bay etc. What a frustrating debuff. &gt;:C
---
I rolled a female shadow priest in TBC and it was pretty fun. I’d imagine it’s about the same as in vanilla. I do know I’m gonna go a troll priest again for my second alt.
---
So you want to be invincible on retail?
---
So your thought process is to list off raids starting with wrath of the lich king when were on a forum discussing classic wow and then give a smart ass fact check your shit. Boy you take the cake.
---
yeah! troll priests own, basically.
---
Too much qq and not enough pew pew
---
The number of people min maxing and such is incredibly small compared to the number of people who saw a hunter looking cool in the trailer and will still pick it.
---
Fuck you kid
---
There's no investment. You got skin in the game, you stay in the game.
---
So I win 70% of the time (he has 30% resist) .... he also needs to be fast on that blind otherwise I am blinding him really fast if he resists my cheap shot opener. 
---
Its still heavily favored for me. If I don't hear cheap shot, he has like half a second to target and blind me (and he never does unless he spams a macro). 
---
Opening is EVERYTHING.
---
And the mob is 43 levels lower than you and still aggro'd from pretty far away.
---
This doesn't seem like it would be that big of a deal given that every class has healing now.
---
Lookup man in the middle attack and key exchange you clearly don't understand why this not safe to use their server to exchange keys.
---
Items like these are some of the most fun shit in WoW to me. TBC had a ton of them. Wrath was the beginning of no fun allowed Blizzard, and just about every quest after that said "must be used in the quest area" when you took it elsewhere.
---
One more reason roll alliance.
---
Last I checked you can't skip it. They put a LoS wall up so you can't Shadowstep up the ledge or similar now. Heroic Leap etc. all don't work anymore.
---
This battlegroup was the pick of the bunch back in the day imo...
---
Yeah the first two phases may be short but the later ones will be longer so Naxx the following spring makes more sense
---
"organic material relocation specialist"
---
So, a toilet cleaner.
---
I like the idea of classic plus but it really isn’t feasible
---
Good point. I never thought about it like that.
---
Satan will reign supreme before 1 happens.
---
Assuming things go well, which is a pretty big if, then blizzard will clone the current servers.  Clone1 stays the same.  Clone2 progresses onto tbc.  Then they'll make another server that basically starts classic all over again.
---
20 year hammer of Justice in any expansion
---
Unless you roll dwarf ;)
---
I have a Masters degree in CS and have worked in encryption quite extensively. What exactly do you think someone with only the public keys is capable of doing? I really think it's you that doesn't understand E2E encryption.
---
Makes you talk about minecraft on a wow forum.
---
If things go badly, then they'll leave the current servers as is, and start a fresh server for you to start over again.
---
It's not bad.  It has its ups and downs.
---
You will be lacking sanity for sure
---
it can’t be used in combat.. you’ll be basically waiting for combat to drop for u to shadowmeld which can be used to eat and bandage instead. sure it has its cliche uses but it’s not high on the tier list of racials.
---
the boredom alone would kill me
---
questing, exploring keeps it interesting
---
I assume this? https://youtu.be/7bNyXFhTUjU
---
&gt;Do you think this will be slower than questing?
---
Orgrimmar &gt; all.
---
Rogue -&gt; Priest -&gt; Mage -&gt; Warlock
---
But I'm almost certain im gonna stay with this choice. The Warlock community is amazing, and the whole fiction and lore behind this class got me.
---
If I may ask, have you played vanilla wow before?
---
You gotta be lvl 10 or some shit to see. Another dumb ass decision by blizzard. 
---
Their  subscriptions are nose diving and we desperately need to bring people back. What do they do? Put a paywall up blocking potential resubs from seeing if an old friend is coming back they might wanna play with.  Fuckin genius.
---
I love that you get Menethil Flightpath
---
Haha ya for sure. But I always enjoyed just grinding. Also I could always take breaks during the levels of my favorite zones if I werent enjoying it.
---
Like their gonna give us a flat no dude, that’s just not how business is conducted:
---
You'll never make it there.  You'll end your journey in Redridge, like so many before you.
---
Economy in OSRS is much better. WoW has always been rather terrible in this aspect compared with other MMO's.
---
Well people have been playing classic content for 15 years and are supposedly happy doing so. Why would retail classic change the trend?
---
Following any druid in the water is just suicidal.
---
Sounds like a matter of personal playstyles and expectations. PvP in a world without battlegrounds was a \*huge\* aspect of the vanilla experience. You know, PvPing just for fun - and not because it suits their gear progression goals if they can jump into BGs and start grinding for ranks as soon as they ding 60.
---
that was more entertaining than it needed to be.
---
&gt; warriors have multiple fear breaks.
---
Eh? I only know of Berserker Rage.
---
I always thought 49 was the best bracket, good to see other people talking about it.  One thing, for gold at 49 I'd suggest goblin-ing the AH in addition to fishing...  5 or 10 minutes checking auctions while you wait for a queue to pop can pay off.
---
[Yeah.] (https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19120/rune-of-the-guard-captain)
---
It wasn’t out from the beginning on K2/3 either.
---
With the burning of the night tree heh.. I dont blame him
---
As soon as the release date dropped I just can't give a fuck about any other game, I haven't been this excited since I was waiting to get a new pc to play vanilla originally in 2006
---
This. Humans only make sense to play as self inserts, since they're one of the least interesting races lorewise
---
like raid gear?
---
Thunderbluff &gt; Org
---
I think there's a period of 10 levels where flat grinding is more efficient. However quests are not only generally more efficient, but certain quests give strong loot to increase grinding speed. That's why guides always recommend doing a dungeon if one is readily available. Like the crescent staff. Its MELEE dps is unparalleled for its level range.
---
PvE servers are usually really near 50/50. For their part, PvP servers start out 50/50, but when a side starts getting the edge the scale always starts to dip.
---
If it’s possible to do that then great that sounds like a good idea. Didn’t know whether that was possible or not.
---
I'd love to know where you get your insider knowledge.
---
What 10 lvls is that?
---
Hmm... hope he accepts! O.K. Good thinking.
---
Ya I’m all about that upscale boujee shit baybee. Treat me like a Kardashian
---
I’m not counting BFA. I’m talking about from the very beginning
---
Arcane Shaft
---
Orc/Dwarf are the best rogues. Orc win slightly with the stun resist, Dwarf win with the cool factor.
---
consider watching something [really stupid / funny instead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRLfkBGb32E)
---
If you're a kiwi that works on multiple levels.
---
Which you should. Get that SatansHeteroFather aesthetic going.
---
Yea and most of them suck.
---
nobody called it vc
---
enough with this revisionist propaganda
---
So we can have barrens chat all over the world.
---
I always thought neutral dungeons as names would be cool and wouldn't imbalance servers.
---
Nice, which is your favorite?
---
Thanks!
---
Genie: What is your wish? You can have anything you can imagine.
---
You, holding a bagel: I wish this cupcake had sprinkles.
---
I forget the guide. Kargoz has some guides on Youtube, check that out.
---
Get grenades from engineering.  You will need them and lots of mana potions and drinks.
---
You should have to /sleep in a bed for 24 hours to rest off a disease.
---
Anything but fresh servers pls
---
They've not said they wont so just think possitive thoughts :)
---
&gt;I dont like iLvL telling me what is an upgrade Means I dont even look at the stats or anything. Just oh, it has a higher iLVL with the substats im looking for, sweet upgrade. 
---
funny cause people complain that ilvl doesnt mean everything anymore with sockets and benthic traits. But good job parroting stuff you have no clue about
---
The 20sec attack, casting and movement speed debuff from the harpies in north barrens
---
That’s a negative there, ghost rider. Pretty sure that wasn’t added til BC.
---
When morons have no knowledge about software development.
---
[Crystal Yield](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=4384) is a potentially useful item for raiding. Don't know if it will stack with other armor debuffs in classic yet.
---
Imagine the types of people he's talking to through the headset. More permanently reclined anti-chads.
---
Need to see under that pillow and keyboard to see if it's real or an imposter fupa
---
Stoneform made me go from my nostalgic night elf rogue to a dwarf
---
Pretty sure you meant to say 9. Elwynn Forest twink tournaments are where the skilled pvp is.
---
There's no dismount penalty for daze on retail. Only in classic.
---
Or you could do a little reading on the indexed comments instead of just lashing out. 
---
Earliest I could find was 1.5. Lines up neatly with phase 3.
---
Vanilla friend finder website is 10x better than the Blizzard forums anyway.
---
Not really
---
Her pussy is probably salivating rn
---
Paladin &gt; Priest &gt; Paladin &gt; Hunter &gt; Paladin &gt; Priest &gt; Paladin  
---
Alas my final plan is to roll paladin first. I love healing by FoL spamming. No need to respec for pvp at 60 as I like pally pvp healing. Unique mount that's also free at 40. 
---
My alt will be a hunter because I've never indulged in being a pew pew ranger type in nearly 20 years of MMOs. But I don't want to main this because I fear it might be tough getting a raid spot. 
---
I was considering priest over pally because they have a vastly easier time leveling. I also feel far stronger in wpvp during leveling as shadow than ret pally, and mind control is lulz. Truefaith Vestments also looks way better than the holy pally bis robes, I'm quite a sucker for aesthetics. 
---
In dungeons/raids I prefer to heal, but I want to melt face in pvp, so I'll need to respec more. I dislike playing around the 5 sec rule for mana. I heard spriest pvp has serious mana issues. 
---
Fuck...Now I feel like playing a priest again. Maybe I'll just learn to like priest healing in pvp, and leave killing to my hunter alt. Yeah, I'll pick a priest now...
---
One of many reasons to pick engineering as your profession.
---
Pretty much this. There is definitely a few high points, SS, WW, MS new wep upgrade. But the class lack of healing just makes leveling as a warrior *kinda* tough but most importantly slow.
---
Thats while ill probably be dungeon cleaving.
---
&gt; All I can say to you is he demonstrated on his stream that hamstring kiting is a lot lot less effective than it is on private servers.
---
That it can be, but im quite certain that it still is the fastest way, at least untill you get sweeping strikes (and the pulls between when its on CD). And if thats true, i wouldnt call it "out of the picture".
---
Yeah. I bought it, and haven't read it cover to cover, but I am impressed. 
---
The warrior talent build makes sense and is, if not unique, certainly nonstandard. I suspect it may be optimal. 
---
The rogue talent build, I am less certain of (it recommends taking 3/5 of dodge chance before improved sinister strike, but I assume that was just hakurai not being up on how bobo-talents saves the order you input stuff in). 
---
There is a good explanation of WHY you are doing what you are doing at the start of every segment, and this means that you could just opt out of a segment if necessary, to correct for any problems your group might encounter that the guide does not cover.
---
The weapon progression is extremely solid and basically guaranteed (it's a pair of quest weapons followed by an absolutely key dungeon drop you farm for as long as you have to to get all you need). 
---
My main concern is money management. It's assuming you are literally joined at the hip with your group, it's got stuff like "divvy up a paladin's money to the other members so that they can get mounts". Ain't pugging that, I suspect. 
---
It's also got some long segments with no clearing bags. I haven't read the whole guide, but "there are some sections of this
---
guide where we don’t visit a vendor for 10~ hours of gameplay" sets off alarm bells.
---
I suspect if there's one weakness in the testing method, it's giving people assumed gear for test segments using a private server repack. When you are clearing trash for 10 hours at a time without killing the bosses, and then not vendoring the drops? that could really hinder your ability to buy gear.
---
My initial assumption that you could easily keep your gear where it needs to be was based on you being rich, from fighting tons of elite mobs and vendoring everything they drop. If you stop visiting vendors or mailboxes for 10 hours at a time? I can see that no longer being true, and all of a sudden, knowing that private servers got the drop tables for BOE greens right all of a sudden matters a lot. 
---
I hope hakurai gave his test groups some really shitty gear, apart from the actual quest drops he includes and the couple key pieces of gear he just farms until he gets them (herod's hat and axe, basically).
---
She didn't respond after your 20-hour comment bruh.
---
I am not even sure what you think is controversial about what I said would happen?  Are you one of those crazies hoping for classic+?  Because that will never happen.  
---
It's not logical to hire talented developers, which they're in short supply of, to create new content for a small niche community, rather than to just hire some c team flunkies to recreate tbc.
---
I typed up my guilds loot rules/raid rules/loot rules. The biggest thing is reputation matters imo. The guild name is more important than the name above it. How someone acts reflects on the guild.
---
Just one more reason to have a Hydrocane ready
---
I don't think it's controversial. I just don't think you should go around talking like you know what's going to happen when at best you have guesses.
---
Also, whether I want it or not, wanting Classic+ doesn't make someone crazy, you really should stop labeling everyone you disagree with as crazy, it really weakens your argument.
---
“Read 22:18”
---
I change my opinions all the time, I've yet to be convinced by someone pointing out how strong words I use, and that I typed in one paragraph of text. Maybe you can explain how avoiding tax is moral Instead? English is not my first language so I'm sorry if you interpreted it like that. Good day.
---
There’s just so much to digest here.
---
True. Often getting to the sidebosses is the difficult part. That one chick in the basement at scholomance comes to mind.
---
Also faction rep is added in many/most quests, skipping all quests will put you behind in reputation.
---
Bookmarked &lt;3
---
There are no female dwarves, only the shaved ones.
---
&gt; Large Rope Net: Root/Snare - Drops of Murlocs in Westfall  
---
These were removed from the game prior to 1.12  
---
Not sure if they're in Classic or not.
---
Nothing was quite as ridiculously broken as DK's on WotLK release.
---
Unfortunately it's true. I played a femal gnome warlock for some time (one of many alts that never hit lvl 60). And I definitely experienced some perverts hitting on me.
---
yes
---
probably because its retarded
---
That's why I will play on a pve server. I don't enjoy make others life miserable.
---
I like to team up to conquest content.
---
&gt;The process itself takes extra 3 seconds with every beast you skin. 
---
Except that's 3 extra seconds I'm regening between each pull which adds up to no down time. While you're stopping and eating/drinking every 3 pulls for more than 9 seconds.
---
I was listening to a round table discussion with some prominent figures from the private server scene, it sounded like it was possible to clear like MC, BWL and AQ40 in like 4 hours with full world buff, consumes etc. Then it starts being worth it I'd say.
---
I have my own start-up with about 15 employees. They all know that us WoW fans will be taking 3 days off during the week to power level. Goal is 50+ before monday starts. :) We will have a meeting room set up for wow with energy drinks and bars...Ohh I cant wait for classic to release and the people I will meet on my road to 60! &lt;3 &lt;3  &lt;3
---
Huh? Stoneform is dwarf, not troll or undead...
---
&gt;Having to make choices that ultimately make your character different from another with the same class.
---
Exactly! Like having actually different characters with their pros and cons without everyone having the latest meme spec. I was thinking what if the character levels or "played" would trigger some passive effects which balance out the difference between epic gear and newly dinged lv60 characters? I know this doesn't fit into wow, but in the game "darkest dungeon" there's this kind of interesting mental health things which develope over over times.. like vulnerabilities towards certain kind of attacks. I guess it would be too harsh to give -5% vulnerability to e.g. frost resistance if the character has spent lots of time in the hot zones  like tanaris and silithus, but something similar would be appropriate.
---
Another thing they could do is to create emerald dream as an additional layer/filter/dimension for the vanilla environment which could be accessible through certain kind of consumables or something else.
---
i use q and e for strafing w forward. leaving a s d available. L alt as a modifyer is also convenient.
---
and my bow!
---
DMN Buffs aquired beforehand, meet-up in Grom’gol, run to ZG Island for buff, portal to Orgrimmar, fly to Felwood for Songflower (which is of course being camped by benched people so that you have the respawn timer), portal to Orgrimmar, have Ony head popped and, depending on how the WCB mechanics works, have a social of the guild pop WCB, HS to Kargarth!
---
Can’t wait enough for it!
---
A lot of these only work like this on private servers because of janky scripting. Most of this stuff requires you to be in a specific area or have a specific target in Classic.
---
 
---
As the best defense is good offense the best healer is deffinetly pompyro mage. Second is a priest using MC next to a cliff.
---
What rest of the group? The gem for the pala quest drops off the first elite mobs before the instance. You can pull them single and solo them. You usually get the gem within 3 kills.
---
For SFK you generally need a group, though it's also possible to solo, albeit quite hard. 
---
Also getting together a couple of paladins around your level to do the quest shouldn't be that hard, unless you are a speedleveler.
---
Imagine not having IF and SW...
---
Shadow Priests are big in pvp. I would pick up engineering.
---
Super Inspect may be misleading. There was already a 1.12.1 addon called that which lets you inspect people from far away and cache their gear.
---
For when you wanna go from benign to cancerous real quick
---
Why do I just see people frothing about Warriors in Classic like that's the only class people are going to play? What was so good about them
---
Was about to say this, glad it's #1.
---
Faerie Fire is next.
---
Go mage. The utility and CC they bring to a group is invaluable.
---
Only 2 days?
---
Just be honest with her; you’ll be gone for the upcoming 4 months and your relationship will never be the same
---
Hmm, Ok, I will have to keep an eye out and see. They are preferable over the Net-o-matic after all
---
Horde 45-50 on patch 1.2... but we are playing 1.12 so quests in hinterlands and searing gorge will be there... so you are better questing and killing every mob you meet.
---
Yes those could be good, along with a few of the other crystals. And they are fairly easy to obtain
---
We're not really concerned with overlapping addon names from private servers, only Retail and Classic.
---
What would you pair with engineering?
---
our guild has our own pvt server and we went undergeared and geared ourselves with some basic items that we may have gotten from the previous dungeons and did fine.
---
To put it lightly, ever since Nostalrius has shut down, I have been mentally shut off.  I couldn’t believe that the greatest thing to ever happen in gaming since actual vanilla had been shut down by blizzard.  I felt empty and soulless.  Then the announcement for vanilla at 2017 blizzcon, and every day between then and the release date announcement was unbearable.  Now with a mere three weeks to go until were back, all I can fathom for entertainment is either staring at the fucking wall, reading this subreddit or rereading the hundreds of rogue guides which I’ve memorized by heart at this point.  The pain is physical at this point.  I CAN’T FUCKING TAKE IT!  END MY AGONY!!!!!!!
---
this sub and its mods consists of &gt;50% Americans who seem to forget that the rest of the world exists
---
Hahaha that is fucking gold! Can very much relate
---
Are there any EU guilds here? I would love to join a casual group with chill people who have their daily responsibilities from EU.
---
Really, they kept that? Must be misremembering then, I thought, they made this change also specifically because of AV, but maybe I confused it with WSG or AB.
---
Not big on pvp, but when there is an opportunity.. you take it.
---
Mindcontrolled many alliance into the lava, from bridges, from mountains, into mobs, etc. The short while tarren mill vs southshore was a thing was pretty fun too.
---
This.
---
The guide I'm using suggests about 8 hours of straight grinding at one point and it's insane. Putting Netflix on a second monitor helps, but 8 hours is as long as I'm willing to go. It also only gets me from lvl 42 to 45.
---
seeing mc pop up and half a second later realizing I'm the one mc'd
---
Abuse is when you use it over recomended dose and just to get high all the time, I never took more than maximum daily intake that a doctor can perscribe to you.
---
If it has an icon in the lower section next to your minimap then it's a debuff. No matter who put it there.
---
If you don’t get Engineering get the EZ Thro Dynamite for ranged pulls or/and Linkens Boomerang
---
Hunters entrapment talent........................ theres this one hunter on horde on this one s whos name starts with skol and ends with ott who, my fucking god is the nerdiest most frustrating opponent i have ever faced. F entrapment. Lmaooooo (am warrior obviously.)
---
I need this so bad, I've been a rut here lately struggling at work, not finding enjoyment in other games, feeling depressed and im really hoping I can just pour myself into Classic and just ignore all my problems for a little while. Maybe I'll make some new friends, have a few memorable experiences and rediscover what made WoW so great for me.
---
Or like, 3s and not that much mana if they are leveling.
---
You clearly fail on reading comprehension... I didnt speak about ED even once.
---
E S F - Movement
---
Alt-E - Mount

Mousewheel/buttons - Party targetting/Jumping

Alt modifiers - Cooldowns/Trinkets etc. 
---
Also using [help]/[harm] in order to save buttons
---
I remember that originally blizzard started to have lots of problems with proc based items (tuf knockback unintentionally disrupting casting etc.) so they just increased the stats. What I don't know is whether they ever thought about future content expanding the skill range / spells or something else instead of stats &amp; levels.

Too slooooowwwwwwwwwww

Stoneform immediately dispels the Undead racial spell Devouring Plague, which lots of people say is the best racial spell on Horde.

Generally most classes are good at one role and decent in others, sometimes being the best in some roles.
---
Warriors are the best tank, melee dps and best group pvp, making them have the best average score for endgame, granted they are terrible duellers and levellers, but being the best at something in 3 spots is what is seen as somewhat busted.
---
There's no way that they would release Naxx anywhere close to a new retail expansion - which should be Aug-Oct 2020.
---
Grinding in out-of-the-way locations can be quicker than battling for quest mobs on a fresh server, but I also would recommend doing dungeons for gear upgrades. Quest itemization sucks in vanilla so you won't be losing out on gear upgrades if you do a combination of grinding and dungeon crawling.
---
Bet your ass
---
So like most of Reddit then?
---
fury warriors also have death wish which breaks fear so if your UD you can have 3. not worth it imo compared to the orc or tauren racials
---
Okay, this is first page of encryption for dummies level stuff, but I'll explain it to you.
---
Assume you have two people A and B who wants to exchange keys, when it happens Blizzard intercepts the keys calculates two key pairs and sends the new public keys to A and B.
---
Now you have a situation where both A and B think they have exchanged keys, but in reality they have a public keys that was made by Blizzard and Blizzard has the private key.
---
When A sends a message to B this happens.
---
A encrypts the message with the public send to them by Blizzard, which they think is B's public key. Blizzard intercepts the message and decrypt it, which they can do because they have the private key matching the public key. Blizzard now re-encrypt  the message with B original public key and send the message to B, B is then able decrypt the message using their private key making it look like the message was secure.
---
You would know and understand the basic concepts like this is you knew anything about encryption.

🦀 JAMFLEX IS POWERLESS AGAINST CLASSIC WOW🦀

No, they’ve given the politicians answer on it, and we won’t be getting it.

Surprised this hasn't been said:

I wish they had kept it. Lots of things were better in the Beta than initial release. Captain Placeholder. /salute

Plenty of pew pew when they're hunter's marked.

Careful, I failed my electromagnetism course and set myself back a semester the first time around :)
---
do it!
---
Hope you're a mage then!
---
Got it. The way the comment was worded, sounded like they were implying stoneform was a troll racial.
---
If there isn’t a bedpan u aren’t hardcore enough
---
In vanilla, guilds spent months trying to master MC.  Sure, the 'strategies' are well documents, but they were just as well documented back then.
---
Everyone acting like their raid of 40 people are going to ding 60 and show up in their hodgepodge random dugeon/quest gear and clear MC on their first attempt.
---
Sure, Molten Core is a cakewalk when your raid group is mostly geared up and your players have the mechanics down - but there will be a lot of wiping and failed attempts before then.
---
I'd watch the private server scene. There will undoubtedly come an interesting project or two that uses the Classic client.
---
Alch/herb for money or mining/engineering for pvp. Truefaith vestments are way too expensive to be worth it.
---
I relate dude. My exams conclude 23rd. Having a lot of trouble with the classes, but the thought of working hard now, passing them and getting to enjoy classic after is motivating me (and like a lot 2, it’s really cool). 
---
Best of luck at the new gig ! See you azeroth
---
Well, if you look at scripted npcs, they mostly walk on cutscenes so it makes sense... People does not run everywhere all day long

---
Think there's some kinda torch of flame from the duskwood stalan questline, it's an offhand held item that debuffs a target
---
I don't think that poll will be accurate when players realize hunter's aren't a buggy broken mess like they were int he beta.
---
It shifted a lot of us to reconsider our main class.  But I think that fear will subside and you'll have more hunters than are admitting it right now.
---
Plus it's the easiest leveling quest and you no for sure some IMA BE A WARRIOR CUZ ITS OP IN NAXX are going to die inside as they struggle to level 20 and reroll hunter.
---
It is a +5 Herbalism, not +15

Well, nothing exists in a vacuum.

Hey there Delilah...

His choices in general are always female and as young and chesty as the game allows.
---
Funny enough, the only gnome I remember him playing was a male level 19 twink rogue.
---
They didn't.  Fuck murlocs.
---
I was doing exactly the same, friend of mine wondered why I was always being spastic when I ran away from mobs and showed me the strafing technique
---
Horde is generally considered to have stronger racials for PvP.  So players who prioritized PvP tend to go Horde.  Namely Orc’s Hardiness that gives a 25% chance to resist stuns, can fuck up rogue stunlocks among other things.  And Shamman’s Windfury totem and Bloodlust.  And Will of the Foresaken.
---
I redact my previous statement. I'm retarded and have had way to little coffee before redditing today.
---
\+15 is correct
---
Warriors where still overall not really overpowered. They were amazing with proper support and amazing in pve. They did generally ok in solo PvP. I guess what I mean to say is warriors are great. But you’re never gonna see anything anywhere near what wotlk release death knights were. 
---
Although that being said, a bunch of the classes feel like flat out bullshit in PvP once they become decked in naxx gear and start one shotting each other with crits.
---
Fellow (ex) osrs player here. Just give it a shot, pretty sure that you'll love it!
---
Girls don’t play classic so rip finding a new girlfriend.
---
Maybe on a PvE server.
---
Im gonna play classic and love it, but raiding wont be the hard part compared to live, only hard thing will be finding and managing such a large group. Mecanics are a joke by now for experienced raiders, but werent back then.
---
ahem, disenchanting requires no rank up.
---
And wait for the day of the next patch, where gear or azerite progress you made means nothing as it gets easier to reach the same level in a matter of days. Except for mounts, more mounts, collect mounts , yes mounts , that game is about mounts now ...
---
I agree that mythic and mythic+ are the good stuff tho , but if you are not in a static group and have to PUG, people are quite toxic but it may be the era and not necessarily the game in itself.
---
At first I thought you saw our guild's advertisement. Then I read all that tryhardy shit and #nope. We figure 2-3 months for most people to hit 60 is reasonable. And any guild requiring you to be on an hour early and raid 3x times a week when you're just clearing MC &amp; Ony is wasting time. Should be able to clear MC in under 5hrs total. Split that up into 2 nights and you can do Ony real quick after you kill rag.
---
&gt;There are plenty of guilds on the server that shall not be named that get by just fine while only raiding once per week.
---
Not going to kill Onyxia on each reset ? And because you can do onyxia 4-6x per reset, its even more important to do 2 weekly raids. SHORT raids, but still 2 raids a week.
---
now she don’t gotta worry about you asking questions.
---
Raidings a bit easier in retail if you consider you don’t have to rope in 40 players and the end bosses don’t last longer than a week as oppose to 170ish days for the first rag kill.
---
Me and my friends are going to play horde but for some reason my brother wants to be retribution paladin and this drives me mad...
---
The zones and races for Alliance are better. They look more appealing, I don't see why should I play Horde. I did play them, had my fun with a Troll struggling in Durotar then The Barrens, both great zones, but the Alliance have Teldrassil, Elwynn Forest, Dun Morogh, Westfall, Redridge Mountains, even the gloomy Duskwood is amazing.
---
The people that hate Alliance are Horde fanboys that want to PvP day and night. I will play Alliance on a PvP server and whatever happens - happens. I want to be a Human Rogue and that's it. There are a lot of great people playing both sides, I just want to be Alliance, because I identify with them more than the Horde that look like a faction of beats and monsters.
---
Doesn't matter, we all know stoneform is for the dwarves, but
---
&gt;Stoneform is a major reason why I am rolling a troll priest instead of undead priest. 
---
Isn't worded to say that, it's worded to say trolls have it.
---
Yes, they will. Your paranoia would mean no one uses any messaging service EVER because of potential MITM attacks. Your fearmongering is utterly pointless and fucking asinine.
---
The goal of Signal is to prevent Blizzard from reading your in-game messages. You don't install it unless that's what you want. And of course you're going to use a 3rd party desktop client to make it work if that's the only way to make sure Blizzard can't read your messages.
---
 Im gonna play classic and love it, but raiding wont be the hard part compared to live, only hard thing will be finding and managing such a large group. Mecanics are a joke by now for experienced raiders, but werent back then.
---
Qwertyfgh and alt/ctrl combinations, same for 1-6. It's usually enough for everything I would ever need but it depends on the class
---
Best battlestation yet
---
Warrior is the worst solo PvP class in the game (they have terrible mobility and garbage self healing), but they become really powerful with good support. Put a paladin behind a warrior and they turn into a wrecking ball.
---
Strangely enough, Soul Link Warlock might be the closest thing to WotLK DK in vanilla because they're a tanky pet class that can self-heal and do damage with DoTs. They also have a self-sustaining resource system thanks to Life Tap, which is vaguely comparable to a DK's regenerating rune system.
---
I'm actually in a similar spot. Should be finishing my final project very soon which will give me plenty of time to get all the leveling done that I intend on doing. Should be able to get a solid couple weeks of hardcore gaming in before I have to get back to reality.
---
There are two types of people in the world: 
---
1.) Those that can extrapolate from incomplete data
---
Never end... Before WoW no longer make money and Blizzard decide to close it.
---
Ye UD casting animation is just THE best! Also the ability to remove fear is incredibly useful even in raid environment. Don´t underestimate this one! I am rolling UD priest for sure. Devouring plague is OP while leveling and meeting someone aggressive in wpvp.
---
This is such a backwards ass comment. No one gives a fuck how you play unless it negatively affects them every raid.
---
Private server people don't like being told not to min/max because it's no one elses business but their own.
---
It's a warrior ability that allows you to leap to a target location 8-40 yds away. It's used mostly as a gap closer generally, or mobility in PVE etc.
---
You used to be able to (once upon a time), jump and while in the air click the upper level of the Suppression Room, effectively landing you within Charge range of the boss.
---
Don’t use DKP
---
Don’t use Loot Council
---
Shit. Just don’t have loot because someone will get upset regardless of which system you use.
---
This is a U.S. site. What do you think?
---
I think more than anything he is telling you that you are wrong and you got butt hurt.
---
True, prep should be a thing. But I think the there's a fine line between prep you'r required to do now and what should be necessary. The more buffs stacks the more people will be required to spend time to prep instead of doing what's more fun: Actually raid.
---
Only English servers it seems :(
---
Ironically my retail main is an enhancement shaman. Kicks ass in retail though.
---
Female humans.. Except the emotes
---
I mean in what universe do you consider complaining as a joke?

Actually wotf is used a lot in raids/dungeons and helps you with healing others a loooot.
---
I know it takes a lot of effort to read my comment and notice I'm talking about retail doesnt it =/
---
Blacksmithing and herbalism.
---
Agreed. Too subjective.
---
As a tank, fear effects are the worst. Worked hard to keep the pull nice and tight, now I'm running around like a headless chicken and everything is a mess.
---
No comma in "Help Unle Jack off a horse" justsayin'pleasedon'tkillme
---
Horde have RFC, WC, SM, RFK, RFD
---
Some people say that Ironforge and Undercity are better structured and more accessible than any other city, but I feel like Stormwind is the most accessible for me. I know where everything is in there, I don't know any other city that well or where the NPCs I need are, like trainers and whatnot.  
---
Orgrimmar feels pretty cozy too, but I prefer Stormwind. Orgrimmar has some elevated areas where if you jump off or fall from, you have to walk all the way around to get back to. Aesthetically it looks cool, but in practice it's a pain in the ass.
---
&gt; Naxx will probably come out next summer or fall.
---
Do you even know how itemization works and how many items drop per boss? Releasing Naxx so soon means only one thing - people will farm trash, since they won't have the gear to take on bosses.
---
Not just parry rate, but also the crit penalty reduction. Flurry uptime will be decreased in Classic versus Private Servers.
---
Same bro, friend and I just moved spontaneously to Seattle from WI. If you know anything about Seattle, it's expensive as hell, we've been apartment hunting for a while, getting used to our new jobs, and it's been stressful. We absolutely adore the city and Washington state in general but it's been rough finding something in our price range. 95% sure we're going to secure a legit place tomorrow, but it's been a ride. Can't wait to sit down on release, on my day off (job is chill with that, most of my department are gamers), in my NEW APARTMENT, and just play the fuck out of WoW!
---
likewise we could say other things they are going to have in didn't exist at release, if you'd like to play that game.
---
Female Orc warlocks are the sexiest obviously.

Anyone from vienna here? :P

&lt; Apathy &gt; Alliance • PVP • CST • English
---
\*\*Introduction:\*\*  Apathy is an Alliance guild that is comprised of officership and many raiders with pserver+retail KT clear/ late Naxx and numerous Cutting Edge experience. Our goal is to create a guild culture that focuses on high-end PVE/PVP gameplay and a sense of urgency to progress through content but most importantly a place to call home for all of classic.

\*\*Ambitions:\*\*  Server firsts, while we all used to be in 5+ raid days/week we aim to take it a step slower and labeled as semi-hardcore.  
---
\*\*Schedule: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays 7pm-10pm CST.\*\*  Will most likely stick with 1-2 days until AQ40/Naxx but will utilize Thursdays if there were hiccups in clearing the instance. Sundays will also be optional 20-man/alt MC+BWL clears once the aforementioned instances are on farm.
---
\*\*Loot System:\*\*  Zero Sum DKP
---
\*\*Member Requirements:\*\*

I just feel pity when i see posts like this, if you're this negative and lack the basic empathy or understanding that you don't understand the process behind something and that it might take time and effort in ways that you don't yourself comprehend I'm sure you act as a piece of shit in many other aspects of life, bringing you frustration, hate and a feeling of being surrounded by idiots when in fact you are the idiot.
---
I hope I'm wrong and you are capable of living a decent life though, just quit jumping to hateful conclusions.
---
Lol high mythical really arnt hard until like 12s.
---
Heroic isnt hard either. 
---
Pvp is dead? Your point
---
&gt; Edit: oh and I thought combo points worked like in fighting games, so I'd furiously click on Eviscerate right after clicking on Gouge
---
How do they work in fighting games?

I have the same problem, it’s so ingrained that it’s hard to read it differently.
---
I'll do a lot of shitty things on my rogue. I will be hated.
---
But
---
I
---
Wont
---
Do
---
That
---
Eh, true, but you can generally get enough crit even with -4.8% crit for it not to matter as much anyway, and all classes recieve this reduced crit.
---
Shes gonna be an Ex-girlfriend before she gets home
---
Sorry man.
---
Sorry, what exactly was I wong about?
---
I only added it for that sake of dramatic pause, but you're right.
---
I always thought RP-PvP servers were mainly about avoiding being corpse-camped for hours due to a ~~casual~~ mature playerbase, while at the same time owning weirdos skinny-dipping in moonwells.
---
This is absolutely insane and I love it.
---
I mean alliance have dead mines.  I never really liked WC and rfk and sfk were never my favorites.  SM is the one that really stands out since it has such solid gear and it’s 4 separate dungeons.  
---
I’m not disagreeing with you I just am not partial to the ones you listed.  But yeah gnomer is awful so.
---
What's the point? I guess everyone should just be a GM according to your logic.
---
On a private server recently I decided to go full moron on my second char. I rolled a warrior and exclusively grinded (ground?) and did mining/Blacksmithing. No quests though I did group up to help people out with their elite quests if I happened to be nearby.
---
It was slow as shit, and inefficient as all hell obviously, but it had it’s own sort of zen to it. End of the story was that I outlevelled my class level with mining/BS so I always had gear waiting for me to level up, and I had a meteic fuckton of money (relaively speaking) so skills and the odd AH-upgrade was never an issue.
---
That being said, that was on a private server, and there is no guarentee that it won’t suck even more shit in Classic. I can’t really recommend the approach to anyone but the certifiably insane.
---
But I am also doing the same on a warrior alt come Classic, after I have at least gotten to 40 on a main char so I can funnel at least SOME support to the poor dude.
---
Back in the days, we used a system  where we rolled for all items.
---
You start with /roll 100, if you get an item you stay at 100.
---
If you rolled for that item but didnt win. your roll was increased bei 20 each time you lost a roll.
---
So after each missed item, your chance to win an item increased by 20%. (besides that, we had a very social guild and guildmates would have passed a roll to give others a chance)
---
TBC had it right. Every spec was viable for pve without classes getting homogenized.
---
I'm going skinning/herbalism and dropping skinning for alchemy at 60, trying to be self-sufficient with consumables.
---
I don't really care for tailoring, you go that route mainly for the robe that's BiS until Phase 3. I rather have alchemy.
---
If you plan on doing mostly PvP I would go engineering, could probably stay with Herbalism and farm herbs and just buy the ore from AH. Having Herbalism also helps with making consumables, probably some guy in your guild having alchemy.
---
Ask someone on here 2 post ur discord or something for the dude.
---
IIRC he said he was going to sit this one out. Feels sad man.
---
 She looks 12....
---
Most of them have loot, but 6 of them have a shared table I think... for that set that was somehow better than tier 0 for a lot of classes, but almost no one obsessed over because it didn't have as much effort put into its looks lol
---
I want the OLD Scholomance. I had no idea that 1.12 means it's a 5-man. Strat and Scholo were always 10-man instances and UBRS 15. Pretty gutted :(
---
True. Right there with the Ungoro debuff that increases your incoming damage by 50% for what feels the rest of your entire day.
---
Tanking paladins main ranged ability keeps them far away from dungeons.
---
    Cries in european.
---
100% agree! I replayed the original just now but would have been awesome to do so with the new graphics, definitely a missed opportunity.
---
Is there an alliance list somewhere? 
---
I remember having a deeprun flute, a stick that gave me a giant glowing orb around me, the fulborg rod, a disgusting oozeling that make me look poisened, but im sure i missed a lot.
---
Haha, the animations are the only reason I don’t like NE male hunters. The bow animation, ugh.
---
Yes, but only Warriors (and Seal Fate rogues) have benefits they depend on crits for.
---
tbh luffa is kind of shit. removing 1 bleed effect isn't worth it for a whole trinket slot. even against classes that have bleeds (warrior/rogue/druid) i'd rather have a damage or utility trinket equipped vs a trinket that's going to remove 1 rend or 1 rupture from me. something like renataki's charm (60 energy on use) and an attack power boosting trinket will be better in 99.9% of situations.
---
/u/meakgg was [right on the money](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cfz2vh/we_are_two_weeks_away_from_reddit_cringtopia/)
---
I can't speak for Warriors because I haven't done the math, but in comparing each phases BIS items for Rogues, your crit percentage actually decreases in Phases 3 through 5 in comparison to Phase 2.
---
Phase 1 pre-BIS: 11.14%
---
Phase 2 pre-BIS: 11.55%
---
Phase 2 BIS: 17.45%
---
Phase 3 BIS: 13.62%
---
Phase 4 BIS: 13.07%
---
Phase 5 BIS: 15.28%
---
Phase 6 BIS: 23.24%
---
So did I, until people started talking about 1.12 in YouTube-videos, saying "one point one two". :)
---
My notes from 2005 say they all did. I even distinctly remember, and have footage, of them being used in TBC / WotLK.
---
Filthy rogue
---
I rolled horde paladin in tbc as my main specifically to be a cleansing machine
---
I think the people who complain about morality of the case should not be applying for any tax-cuts or discounts on their own. Who wants to pay taxes... of course nobody wants to give money to the goverment everybody bitch about. Especially in America... all the way hurr durr, we make bombs and are evil and stuff...
---
Grey quests only give 10% of their normal reputation. If you want your saber heading to Night Elf territory is probably a smart move. That said Darkshore seems to be a popular levelling zone for min/maxers.
---
I live with my partner and she’s off to a conference for launch week so naturally I’ve taken the week off work. 😄
---
Really? 80-100 dungeon runs for 30-40? Didn't expect that but probably prefer it too stv
---
If you plan on getting the NE mount, then you NEED to run there and do every quest from L1 and up. Or you are going to kick yourself later spending a ton of gold turning in cloths. You really cant "grind the reputation".
---
Or just do normal human route and grind Reins of the Winterspring Frostsaber at L60.
---
Did this on a a pserver.  
---
It was actually faster than questing as the zones were really full of people contesting mobs.  
---
At lvl 60 I had around 300g, could have been more but I had to buy items from AH to be able to grind. 
---
Its lucrative, and something that can be done while watching Netflix. 
---
It will pay for your mount and you have the chance to get some epic world drops by farming that much, this alone could help you get the 100% mount.  
---
Depending on the population cap blizzard will put it could be worth it. 
---
I can give give more details if someone is interested.
---
Taking tailoring only so you can make your own bags is a bad idea and the gold it require isn't worth the bags.  
---
If you for example want some quick 6-8 slots bag then just have the linen or wool and shout for someone and tip a couple of silver for the effort.   
---
There will be enough people who wants the easy skillups, just make sure that you don't trade your linen/wool first but do the direct swap else someone might trick you into a trade and give nothing.  
---
If you also want enchanting then you could just swap the skinning later on and then level enchanting I guess.  
---
I would not take enchanting without a profession that can make the green items cause enchanting only will not result in that much as you could only disenchant your own gear.
---
She is your god. There's no removing her.
---
Not by you evidently
---
The 30 min magic debuffs in Strat Living when you are Horde and didn't bring a Priest
---
I think Esfand said he's waiting until a day after release to give his realm name to avoid trolls the first day and to get ahead. I'm sure most big streamers will do the same
---
Herb / Skinning &gt; Engineering at 60. Level 5 alt with Enchanting for disenchanting, later ultilize resting xp level it to 35 and pick alchemy, so you can max the skill and utilize transmute arcanite.
---
Probably getting feared and running into more mobs.
---
What’s that got to do with me comparing not being able to do it now?
---
You need 8 warriors later on, which every guild knows and will try to gear in advance. Healers are more common today.
---
Servernames coming this week
---
If there ever was a correct time to use the word cringeworthy, this is it
---
The orcs invaded the "stupid" Night Elves' sacred land and started defiling it.  
---
To understand, imagine your neighbor puts a tent in your yard and starts ripping your flowers from your garden, then calls you stupid when trying to tell him off.
---
Leclassygent explains why this is very well
---
She isn't ! Our only god is Decay ! We should eat her brain.
---
A majority for sure. Movement is very important. Slice &amp; dice as a rogue is key.
---
I love using my two side mouse buttons, and also scroll. Using it with alt modifier. Thats 12 abilities on mouse alone.
---
Also rebind strafe on AD.
---
12345
---
Q and E spamables, FG,CV for longer cooldowns.
---
This was for bfa playing melee. Dunno if il use less or more keybindings inclassic.
---
I love you both
---
And give up on that money? LMAO
---
Not currently.
---
Again, you only exist because of her. She can undo that if you wish.
---
Engineering is nice as hunt for ammo, guns etc
---
I think a lot will go Horde because Horde is currently, and has been for a decade or more, the pve/populated side. 
---
Still Alliance will still beat it but (pve and AV) even with lesser players. This isn't everyone is equal land.
---
I don't care. We will find a way to get rid of her and that. We want to be free !
---
Thanks, I live across the Atlantic but I’ll keep this in mind in case I end up there

you got any data to back that up or are you just talking out of your ass?
---
What is that hunter trick where you feign death and go into shadow meld then frost trap? Can it be done?
---
Sit to crit was known. they changed it. So idk they might? Other people said it does work so i am happy.
---
Do every orange/red quests whenever possible. You get +25% and +50% more rep per quest.
---
I understand why it seems weird it does to me as well, we have a family run company (go kart and lasertag centre) and I have seen it on resumes (till around 2010) more lately I've also seen stuff like pro-gamer vloggers e-team manager and influencer on cv's some even state the amount of followers they have.
---
Mage!
---
You do realize the sub you are in?
---
Realistically, the Alliance have higher numbers with humans, better tech with dwarves and gnomes (they have tanks/bombers/helicopters/machine guns/etc.) and much better guerilla troops in night elves, since they operate during nighttime and are naturally sneaky.  
---
The Horde's main pluses are:  
---
- The Forsaken don't need rest, food or water.  
---
- The orcs have a militaristic mindset.  
---
- Tauren are aided by their sheer size.  
---
But still, we've seen humans stand toe-to-toe with orcs, even with the size difference, and humans use better armor and weapons. A Tauren's size unfortunately doesn't compete with a tank, and the Alliance has a natural counter to the Forsaken, an army of Paladins, troops specifically trained to deal with them.  
---
It wouln't be an easy war, but there is no way groups of nomads and refugees can defeat established militaries with castles, more modern technology and tens of thousands of years of combat experience.
---
Shadowmeld and *then* trap? No.
---
I thought higher level gear required higher enchanting skill to disenchant. Am I remembering wrong?
---
&gt;If you're level forty, 20g may seem like a fortune, but for a level 60 it's matter of 20 minutes to farm an equal amount. Think about it, THE WHOLE ROAD of 1-40 with all your efforts is equalized to half a hour. Crazy isn't it?
---
but you're gonna need 100g (90 with honored discount) at 40, it doesn't matter how fast are you gonna farm it at 60.
---
You will make a banking alt anyway, why no Herb/Skin &gt; Engineering on main then pick enchanting/alchemy on your banking alt, getting it to 35 utilizing resting xp shouldn't be too hard, and for PvE multiple people with engineering is amazing, grenades/charges are huge.
---
Is loot council actually popular? I never experienced anything other than dkp based.
---
Well, you'll be limited to nothing above 60 FPS and with many TVs, only 30 FPS. But assuming you don't care and don't notice any input lag, you should be fine.
---
Back in MoP I used to play on a 42 inch, would sit on a sofa with the keyboard on my lap and mouse pad on the sofa, definitely not ideal lol but can be done
---
I have been thinking about enchanting. Just DE greens I dont need and sell the mats - is that viable? Does anyone know?
---
&gt; Since when did Druids take less magic damage? That's the thing, they dont. They'll be taking the same amount of spell damage, and actually the Warrior will be taking less due to defensive stance and dish out far more damage themselves. Warriors can tear apart a spellcaster, equip a 2H and cut the spell damage off from the source. Better off-role damage than Druid by miles. The warrior will also on average have better gear, as I said.
---
Because they won't be hit with nearly as much magic damage as warriors: They can't be polymorphed, they can't be rooted or frozen and they can dispell curses. They can go into travel or cat form and los the caster. They can use frenzied regeneration. You compare warrior to feral druids, when flag carriers a played much more like healers. When they focus you, you run. And druid is better at that than any other class and therefore takes less damage than any other class by miles. If they focus your dps or other healers, you heal them.
---
&gt; This feels like logic pulled from current WoW slapped on top of Vanilla with face value data that Druids are good Flag Carriers. 
---
I think that is actually what you are doing. You talk about warriors doing more damage, when the point of flag carrying druids is absolutly not their damage but their peel/kiting and their heal. Look at any of the private servers: Druids are the single best flag carrier on any of them. They take almost no damage because it's so damn hard to run them down. If you do they can still jump into bear and charge a caster. Pop out and give them self a huge instant heal. Pop into travel outdoors or cat+dash indoors and be off again.
---
&gt;Want to know how to actually tank Spell damage?
---
You don't tank it. You run away from it and not take it in the first place. You have no idea how druid flag carrier is played and it shows...
---
&gt;If you want a class to tank spell damage, you're looking at SL Warlock with a Felhunter.
---
YOU AREN'T LOOKING FOR A CLASS TO TANK THE DAMAGE. Druid can just avoid it in the first place.
---
&gt;Druids are great, definitely complex to maximize, but to say Prot Warrior is less viable? That's just a load of misleading rubbish.
---
Who's talking about "viable". Prot warriors are just not as good at it. Druids are the single best flag carrier there is because they don't take nearly as much damage **BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO FACE TANK EVERYTHING LIKE WARRIS DO**, can heal themselves and others, decurse, cc with roots and stuns, faerie fire rogues, innervate, are 10 times as fast and can brez. If you can't find a druid you can give the flag to a prot warri, it's the next best thing but it is  a big disadvantage.
---
Gosu!

I'd rather have multiple resistances: https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/pets/?f=2&amp;d=bWPoaZ9ZgZcgoLPC
---
Cosmetic microtransactions. And character boost.
---
yet they wont be worth the debuffslot tho.
---
Never played Warcraft 3, huh?
---
That was changed quite early in vanilla.
---
Glad to see you delivered and put this list together! Great work :)
---
Sure in a raid you're absolutely right
---
Depends on the talent.
---
If the talent affects a specific spell, then it's only applied to the base value. E.g. Improved renew increases only the base healing of renew by 15%, it's applied before +heal.
---
If the talent is a blanket percent buff, than it's multiplied after spelldmg/healing is added, e.g. spiritual healing increases healing done by done by healing spells by 10%, this modifier is applied after +heal is added.
---
Warcraft III ? What is this ? Here we are not talking videogames, we are talking about serious things.
---
A lot of players back in the day quit RS for WoW (back in vanilla and BC).
---
As an OSRS player, I can say that I really like both, but they feel different.
---
If you want to play on the TV: Check for "Game/Gaming Mode"  or anything of the sort, it will put the TV in 60Hz mode if it supports it.  
---
If you don't want to play on the TV: Blue/Green tint can be due to a bad contact, which should be a really easy/cheap fix. Unless it only tints while in-game, in which case it's worse.
---
Why are you discussing non-classic abilities in a classic forum?
---
You say 'we' a lot for a guy who is alone in his opinion.
---
I’m replying to a comment specifically saying you can skip most of it ‘now’.
---
FOR THE HORDE
---
I just roll horde for that sweet male Troll bow animaton
---
You still need Darn rep to use this mount btw.
---
This so much.
---
The video shows an interview with John Height and Omar Gonzales where they say they consider a RpPvP server. Since then, there has been no information clearly stating that there won't be one.
---
Define what kind of guild you will be. Make it in a clear statement. People would have to accept that, or they can find another guild.
---
Ex. Im joining a casual guild (real cassual). RL will not expect ANY preparations before raids. Only be on time. So many of us are gonna raid without consumables and buffs. 
---
He have said that out very clear. He will not tolerate drama when some raiders call out on others for not beeing prepared. All are free to min/max, but it is not demanded. Not at all.
---
This makes all of us know the criteria for the guild. If we are not happy about it, we can find another guild who are more suitable for us.
---
Don't last longer for who and at what difficulty? My semi-casual guild managed to do Jaina on heroic only a week before crucible came out. And I know many more hardcore guilds would say the same thing about mythic.
---
(Of Warcraft)
---
*cries in hunter*
---
I am not saying I like wiping. But the dungeons are actually a bit hard and you need to be aware of it while wearing green items and just dinged 60 and thats what I like. When you have tier 2 set, dungeons are easy and not that enjoyable anymore.
---
Like other poster said, first +bonuses from items/skills then the % over it.
---
If it would first add the % the better gear you get the less useful the talents will get as the bonus on items would far outweigh the amount you get from the % in the talenttree.
---
Immature Venom Sac from lbrs have a spoil timer of 8-10 minutes or so. You'd only ever use those to remove the poison from that crystal spider boss there. Jungle Remedy afaik shares a cd with healpots or other alchemy pots (like restorative potion).
---
And you forgot one of the most powerful/useful ones: Luffa, a trinket from a quest in Searing Gorge. Removes 1 Bleed effect (3 min cd).
---
I thought the 10%s don't scale
---
Sick troll man
---
The drunken debuff is also nice for chat
---
The thing is as a warrior you don't have to respec at all. Were you thinking to have to respec from arms/fury to prot each time you would tank a dungeon? That's definitly not necessary. I'm going to be planning arms to 60 and will tank all dungeons at least once. Prot levelling is bad because you only have a 1h and no damage boosting talents, giving you way lower dps which makes levelling way slower. You may take less damage per strike the monster does to you, but if you take twice as long to kill it the total damage it did to you will be higher.
---
Ok
---
What you talking about ? Warcraft is real life.
---
Here is a useful link [https://classic-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Reputation](https://classic-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Reputation) about the reputation decay. You can travel at level 1 and just start the leveling in Teldrassil. The only problem really is if you pick a class that Night Elves cannot be (Mage, Warlock and Paladin) finding a trainer is going to be hard.
---
Skinning isn't adding 25% more time to get to lvl 40
---
My mother isn't a tauren, kid.
---
Now you can eat them.
---
That's the one. I was Frostmourne and you knew when you got a horde group full of Tich and Blackrock shit was gonna be hard.
---
As a tauren player myself I find this post very amoosing.
---
WotLK pre-patch ret paladins say hello.
---
Come on, be real please. As much as I love Classic, I can never say that raiding is easier than retail.
---
The only reason bosses survived that long is because nobody tried as hard as today and obviously the game wasn't figured out.
---
Today there's a business behind world first and people play 15 hours + a day to clear a raid, which wasn't the case back then.
---
I use to play wow on a tv I had my desktop hooked up to one should be fine honestly never ran into problems
---
Also getting catch-up gear and collecting transmog is the main activity. Don't forget buying mounts and level boosts off the store at premium prices in a buy-to-play and monthly sub game to suPpOrT tHe DevElOpERs
---
No gear gripes. None.
---
It's up to the guild to be clear and straightforward about their particular system and up to the guild members to not bitch when that system doesn't swing their way.
---
You are not a Forsaken. You can't understand and mean nothing !
---
No. Why would you. There are no dwarves on horde.
---
Orcs stun resist is the only one that doesnt have a counterpart for alliance. Gnomes: escape artist, best for warriors, dwarfs stoneform; best for rogues. Paladins buffs are equal or better compared to shamans totems
---
For pve you want fire res in MC and ony, for your pvp pet you want frost and shadow res maxed before stamina
---
alliance or horde, eu or US ?
---
Free vanishes all day unless you have a magical DOT (Shadow word: Pain, Affliction, Siphon Life etc or a Curse :D
---
It's a cross breeding program, she like that tauren wang
---
I use to play video games on my desktop using a tv you should be fine honestly.
---
As I said, it depends on the talent. If the talent mentions a specific ability name, it doesn't scale. If it's a blanket statement like your one-handed weapons or your frost spells, then it scales.
---
Stop saying moo or you'll be part of my breeding !
---
Been forsaken since I started. I enjoy eating corpses as much as the next wandering corpse.
---
I saw the luffa yesterday but overlooked it. Which bleeds are worth debuffing off the top of your head?
---
Warrs increase enough to care about crit cap whilst dwing, so i'd say there may even be cased where they don't lose the whole 4.8% if they arr 3% over cap anyway, as then they only lose 1.8%, but that is probably naxx gear.
---
Ha ha we Tauren are not easily offended with so much chest hair.
---
Hmm an actual thoughtful comment? Am I on reddit??
---
Absolutly not, worst main city in the game, worst to navigate too
---
Never had the same experience
---
my goal is to enjoy the game and save some time. If maxing my proffesions after 60 is better for time saving I will propably do it. But I am not into a race or something. I am also thinking about picking up engineering for pvp.
---
*Laughs in ghost wolf*
---
One of the rogue class quests gives you a debuff poison that can't be cured called Touch of Zanzil. It lasts 7 days realtime but it cured by completing the next quest in the series (which can involve a fair bit of travel). It prevents you from using stealth. If you weren't aware that the debuff was coming it could really hem you up if you say wanted to PVP, explore, or basically do anything else between questing.
---
Why are you using a boar in raids? If you're allowed and going to bother using a pet in raids at all, it should be a wolf with max rank Furious Howl.
---
Where do you see "hate" for alliance lol?
---
Typical xenophobic alliance propoganda.
---
You'll be a burger soon.
---
Without a doubt.
---
u/Kattug are you ready to prep the bull?
---
This is untrue, mages can use 3pc T1, and 2-3 pieces of T2 ideally. No mage should use 8/8 of either tier in pve.
---
I will definitely be casual when the game starts, but yet here I am, so it is not all black and white...
---
Meeting an enhancement Shaman in a solo WPvP scenario is usually a gg, though. Context is very important and it's hard to deny often you end up dead before you even realized you were ganked - of course people bitch about the Shaman being OP after experiencing that. It simply just doesn't translate into PvE or even BGs well.
---
*complementary
---
I leveled a druid to 16 on retail a few months back. He has an epic thanks to the RNG on quest item upgrades.
---
He’s 16 and has an epic.
---
Hopefully classic will give Blizzard enough breething room amd leverage to sort Retail out. There’s a good game underneath all those business-driven game designs.
---
Honestly feral has been pretty broke in 1v1 since atleast wotlk
---
Then, why you don't want eat Sylvanas's brain and burgers made of taurens ? It look delicious !
---
Gnomes are not kids.
---
How touching....dare I say....how mooving
---
Yeah its gonna feel like a slog because it is one. Rested XP will do wonders to drag that number down drastically so it won't be as bad as it sounds, atleast for the people that won't play 16 hours a day. Add in the SM quests and a few RFD runs + those quests too and its really doable, plus some of the gear you can get is awesome.
---
Just remember how much of your time in STV will likely be taken up by waiting for respawns and running back to your corpse to keep things in perspective when it gets boring.
---
"I don't know who you are. I don't care what you want. If you are looking for upvotes I can tell you wont get them here, but what I can tell you is that i have a particular set of skills. Skills I have acquired when chosen to play as THE master race. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you take your words back now that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you, but if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you and I will kill you."
---
/moo
---
omg, amazing
---
12 days is 288 hours
---
\&gt;I think we should start a tauren breeding, RIGHT NOW. 
---
My male Tauren Warrior ERP character approves.
---
No. Us, Forsakens aren't into this kind of things...
---
The rep grind is nasty so you absolutely should do all NE quests you can while leveling to mitigate it if you really want that cat mount.
---
KT drops approx ilvl 90 gear.
---
In my experience, corpses are up for anything.
---
Sylvanas is like my mum yknow. 
---
Plus dwarf neat is much better. It's so compact and thick.
---
Prot was very good for leveling in tbc. In classic its not even worth talking about.
---
Dont care about min-maxing? Fuck this shit I am out!
---
I was seriously thinking about 3boxing with isboxer
---
made me to rage quit the game as a rogue
---
I would upvote, but it's stuck on 666.
---
Reminds me of an ad I once saw for a coding language, they asked for 7 years of experience while the language had only existed for 3. Fun times.
---
I dont know if they fixed disc priests yet, but disc was the worst when bfa began.. actually impossible to kill. Druids are always a pain tho  
---
I play healer myself so I might be biased :¨)
---
I'm literally on a pserver right now scouting hiding holes I can mind control people off cliffs, into lava and into elite mobs in heavily quested zones
---
What about Crafting? You into that as well?
---
They said they concider it for launch or maybe after launch. We don't know shit.
---
Just because you are casual doesn't mean you have to slack and when you only raid 1 day a week, flasks become much more needed to do as much as possible. 
---
One flask a week vs full pots 3 days a week and a flask for 1 raid, it is still cheaper.
---
It's not the og scholo if you can't ten man it with five people afk.
---
Oh yeah, true.
---
I don't care about their endgame viability, I like all the minutiae that comes with being a hunter. I like the fantasy of being a ranger who befriends the beasts of the wilderness. Gonna be either my first or second alt.
---
At least Tauren have a pulse.
---
About Midway. When they introduced epics to them right?
---
I'll be taking skinning/enchanting whilst leveling on my druid but that's because I need Smoking Heart of the Mountain first.
---
Ahh ok, thanks for clarifying dude.
---
You'll want to have enchanting on a feral tank for Smoking Heart of the Mountain.
---
You can level priest with any spec as long as you take Wand Spec + Spirit Tap as your first 10 points.
---
For rogue leveling you'll want to go Combat. If you play on a PvP server, it's probably a good idea to respec Hemo (Sub) at level 30 and then go back into Combat for Precision.
---
Yeah you don't use boar in pve
---
But hes wearing a shield? Keep trying.
---
I suggest that you watch the Warcraft movie and then play (or watch let's play) Warcraft III. I remember WC3 being quite difficult so you might waste too much time if you decide to play it. Then just keep up searching stuff from the Wowwiki.
---
Servers, game client, internet connection, all will be stable and working well. Also I have 12 ms (optical fiber !) with current retail servers.
---
I remember we were unable to play in large 80vs80 fights - this is a thing of the past, large battles will be possible without problems, as seen on the beta.
---
Hunter during leveling (WPvP)
---
The effectiveness of crowd control in PvE and PvP of the mage puts it up there as a contender. Maybe not as strong in 1v1 duels but in wPvP and engaging in an already started PvP encounter in a battleground means you get to clean up as a frost mage.
---
Sadly they dont deliver to my house as its outside the radius, sad times..

Drop me a line, I wasn’t going to start setting anything up until it gets closer but i got my old guild Discord back up and put together.
---
It’s casual, myself and a few friends and whoever else wants to join. We might raid when we get there but we’re going to take it one step at a time. Likely if we do raid it will only be one night a week. We all have real life and jobs to attend to.
---
Mostly the goal is PvP, dungeons and dank memes.
---
PM me if anyone is interested and I’ll shoot you a discord link.
---
The issue is that on a PvP server trolling will be much more likely to happen and Rpers are just not around that much. People who want to play on a RpPvP server will congregate on a RpPvP server. An unofficial RpPvP server is a suboptimal option.

I thought the "now" referred to PServers but nvm
---
Yeh I tried playing on the starter edition the other day (haven’t played on retail since Wrath) and I thought the updated graphics looked fantastic. Wouldn’t have minded if they had updated Classic in that regard.
---
I was also thinking about it that way. I don't really like playing mage once fire becomes "the" spec, so I could main it until I guess ZG/AQ then play something else and keep the mage as frost for pvp and farming, but then I assume my alt would probably be too undergeared to do the new content. Or I can respecc between frost and fire constantly which seems unsustainable, but stay caught up with gear. Or i just go wildcard and play warrior or druid because nobody is playing either of those in my group.
---
Yes but later on things go wild and you need 8 tanks and 15 healers (for 4hm and sapphiron)

You have disappointed me, brother.

I think a lot of people will have to get used (again) to the idea spending more then 20 minutes in a dungeon in general. So plan to do dungeons, on a Saturday/Sunday afternoon or early in the evening.
---
At least in America, Hulu has the far superior anime catalog, imo.
---
Just the sub will do ya
---
I really hope Blizzard finds a way to address this, I don't want the server I'm on to end up with one side being 70% or 80%, whether it's my side or not, it just isn't fun like this.
---
I kind of want to roll a healer in this bracket but gearing sound a little more tedious in 49's than 39's. I also dont want to invest in a twink that is an easy kill. But damn do I love playing support sometimes
---
If you're finding yourself frustrated because of wipes, instead of angrily bitching everyone out, or staying quiet while gritting your teeth, be helpful. Explain things.
---
Afaik just a sub. If you start it today or tomorrow you can participate in the stress test which starts Thursday at 3 pdt and name reservations Monday
---
Well, in the end I hope there will be guilds for all types. Worst thing that could happen is that you only have hardcore guilds that require WoW as full time job and casual guilds that just can't make it to a proper raiding schedule. I'd like to raid twice a week at a leisurous pace without needing to prep all the buffs every time because everything needs to be cleared in 1 hour.
---
That's probably the definition of semi-casual.
---
They look cool, but their bones showing up has been turning me off since day 1. I like how the Chinese Undead don't have bones, if this was the case here I'd play them definitely.
---
Yes yes I know, I meant selling enchanting components like dust and such, and well I thought enchanting my own gear would make it worth it since I assume enchanters will charge a lot for enchantments.
---
&gt;I dont like the lack of realm community and character identity, as in no one is "famous" and I dont get the "OMG this guy has x weapon or x armor piece" anymore.
---
This kind of thing definitely still exists, you probably just didn't hang around in your realm community/trade chat/raid general etc. long enough. 
---
Also this is /r/classicwow, not /r/classicvsretail. we don't need more blogs about what people like/dislike about retail.

LW has the quivers and some gear pieces that are good for leveling. But it's a gold sink. You will need all your leather and more mats. But it's fun, there are some quests too.
---
I'm doing a practice run of this on a pserver with a gnome and I was almost revered when I started Ashenvale. Hitting exalted in feralas seems doable, especially as human. Just make sure you know where all the quests are.
---
Dungeons drop 60-65, raids 65-90, increase by ~5 each tier.
---
Oh an I hate dying to them soo much. It feels like a true failure, dying their amongst their little patethic shacks.
---
&gt; Now that you mention it, why didn't they release WC3 Reforged already?
---
It's marketing, I think....they're drawing in a whole new crowd with Classic...I'm thinking November or early December Reforged will drop with the "Experience the stories that lead to the epic conflict" tagline.  The market for Reforged will be much larger after Classic launch than before it.
---
Gank spot? All the Vale's a stage.

Yea. Worldbuffs are on a timer. Pulled a D&amp;D and kinda forgot about that.

Is there any lists for BiS items for 49s? I'd be worried about accidentally leveling up to 50 while gathering items from dungeons

And what do queue times look like for the 49 bracket?

Congratulations?

Funny story: my freshman year of college s guy who lived in my hall announced to my roommate and I his girlfriend back home was pregnant and he was going to be moving back.

What? TB is, by far, the best city. A few reasons:
---
- The AH is outside, so you can stay mounted.
---
- The closest AH-mailbox distance out of all faction cities.
---
- Repair vendor and trade vendors are also outside. 
---
- The battlemasters are outside, so you can stay mounted. (Darn also as this, but... it's Darn)
---
And a big one...
---
YOU CAN DUEL AT THE BATTLEMASTERS.
---
This is revolutionary for any PvPer. No longer will you have to choose between queueing up or fighting in front of Org.

If only more people realised how amazing TB is.

So I decided to run it up. This assumes a Human Warrior with Swords:
---
Phase 1 pre-BIS: 14.6%	
---
Phase 2 pre-BIS: 15.6%	
---
Phase 2 BIS: 15.55%	
---
Phase 3 BIS: 13.25%	
---
Phase 4 BIS: 13.25%	
---
Phase 5 BIS: 12.5%	
---
Phase 6 BIS: 13.6%
---
So Warriors actually lose some of their crit potential the moment they step into raids and never have any higher than Phase 2 BIS.
---
1. measure the time to grind the 9g at 40
---
2. measure the time it takes to skin 9g in leather (3secs each corpse)
---
See if it's better just to grind that 9g at 40 than skinning corpses from 1-40.
---
Personally, I haven't done the math, so I hope someone will ;-)
---
It'll take you less than an hour to hit 10 on this game you despise. Stop whining.

Take an incel, throw in the wait for Classic and you get posts like this

&gt;Skinning is always worth it to have as one of your leveling professions, even if you vendor 100% of the skins. It's significant, and only gets more worthwhile after 40.
---
Indeed, even at 40, this is how i bought my first mount on my hunter i just skinned the raptors at STV  and earned my mount quickly by selling on AH by the time is was 41.
---
It ain't stoppin anytime soon this game isn't called fuckin World of Peacecraft
---
See here: https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/wowclassic
---
Everything is detailed here https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a1vrt6/on_skinning_for_gold_while_leveling/
---
Hunters can simply send their pet at the next mob while skinning... that's quite efficient.
---
as others have said, enable game mode for 60fps
---
Why the fuck do you think you get to tell me what to do?
---
I only mentioned it because the pet calculator you linked for Fire Resist only is a Boar.
---
I’m starting to think you are either Alexensual it blind supporter of him...
---
so probably early to mid phase 4.
---
I'm surprised there isn't a mobile version, honestly...most ipads and other similar tablets could run Classic without a sweat, they make the PC I originally played WoW on look like a flipphone in terms of capability.
---
ilvl is crap to go after anyway in classic
---
I am still undecided on whether to roll human warrior or orc warrior, on one hand nothing beats stormwind nights for rpg aspect and probably nostalgia but on the other hand maybe I will find similiar aspects if I roll a orc warrior?
---
🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
---
OK dude
---
Lol its mixer dude it's not like you have to avoid viewers or something.
---
I can cheekily get some wow time in at work; which is pretty lucky.
---
&lt;5% is an absurd number. Many people, including me, played vanilla but hardly did any dungeons. I think I did scholo once.
---
If so, then spiritual healing is the exception or something pservers got wrong. E.g. Piercing ice works after spelldmg is applied.
---
By level 40? Not a chance. Not even anywhere close to that.
---
Horde are not flagged in xroad right?
---
It's .com. Not .co.us!
---
You send your pet to the next Mob while looting and skinning. Free time
---
VMware! Remote desktop on android. Thats how I play the AH on private servers!
---
That's actually about right, not joking.
---
30 resist isn't nothing. In PVP it's a 13% chance to resist.
---
My choices:
---
Raid: https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/pets/?f=16&amp;d=bWPhJZ9ZgZCi (swap the Fire resist for others in later phases)
---
World: https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/pets/?f=0&amp;d=bWPjlZ9ZgZcgoLPC
---
BGs: https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/pets/?f=4&amp;d=bWProZ9ZgZdtVY6S
---
I’m talking about completely new players to wow. Vanilla dungeons are not hard. Mage sheep moon. Rogues sap star. There’s not much more to it. It’s about the basic understanding of the game that you need in vanilla dungeons. So only a completely new players might be surprised by what you’ll expect in the dungeon.
---
You'll shoot to the moon with that setup, pal. Well done.
---
- Not worth the hassle and the city layout imo
---
- Again, not worth the terrible city layout
---
- They are outside in orgrimmar too
---
- Again, if the city was filled with annoying bridges :D 
---
- This is literally the worst dueling zone in the game, its so small :D
---
The U.S. invented .com and the internet, itself. Deal with it.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0
---
Those numbers I have are ONLY gear and enchants, nothing else.
---
Stormwind doesn't have Orgrimmar bank, how are you meant to stand on Org bank roof and show off your sweet new loot if your Alliance?
---
BRD was certainly amazing. I remember picking and choosing which bosses we wanted to do depending on our group. Quite unique.
---
Think druids are pretty broken, you can't even get to them most of the time due to shape shifting.
---
Woah woah ease down with those hot takes mate, you are burning the house down
---
It's not worth the time to do it while leveling, you will not find enough gathering nodes to level your profession fast enough without spending time and farming for them.  
---
Time is money and at level 60 you can make money faster and buy some of the mats you need to level crafting professions.
---
I think those monitors are on an awful precarious position and could fall with a little kick
---
Is there any ingame addon for lore?
---
pretty sure there a re graphic options that you can increase or stay #nochanges so there will be some benefit.
---
i get that, but the argument that "you should know mechanics" shouldn't give someone a pass for being an ass.
---
Would max shadow/frost resist be enough for the pet to seriously bother people with fear or nova?
---
I was also not angrily bitching everyone out. I was just pointing out that wiping over and over isn’t fun. I hate the vanilla trihards that won’t everyone to experience the game they used to 15 years ago where everyone was pretty much a noob. Wake up people. Gamers are way better now. Vanilla dungeons will be extremely easy. You just need to do some CCs. I mean you can see it on the Pserver nowadays. Groups are rushing thru 60 dungeons like nothing and Pserver are confirmed to be harder
---
People will get massively frustrated with warriors.
---
They are great tanks they are great dps in pve with lots and lots of gear they are great in bgs with lots and lots of gear + pocket healer. That’s it.
---
Leveling? Horrible
---
Dps with bad gear? Horrible
---
Open world pvp? Horrible 
---
1v1s? Horrible?
---
Bgs without great gear and pocket healer? Horrible
---
No class will burst so many bubbles and leave people frustrated as warrior will
---
But because it is more difficult it can be more lucrative.  Herbs are also used by 1 profession in Vanilla, ores are used by two.
---
&gt;Takes horde awhile to get black rock mountain. Takes alliance awhile to get to Silithus.
---
In fact it takes us all a lot more time then we want to get anywhere in classic - i remember this is what started discussions/demands on having mini-games you could play while in flight.
---
Nah, it is not. One flask a week is not insane. If you cannot get about 300 gold a week, even as a casual, you are doing something wrong. 
---
Just selling CDs will be at least 150g a week. 
---
What you cant seem to understand is that for a casual guild, time is more valuable. This means that the difference in having a flask or not, can be clearing both MC and BWL vs MC and 50 % of BWL.
---
I don't get this. Why do you want gear in the first place then? Would you prefer to have gotten all you gear from Uldir a year ago and then not have any upgrades? 
---
I like gearing up my character, so each reset is really nice, because I get to do it all again. And I don't feel it's pointless at all because I need the gear for progress. I can't just sit on my 418 ilvl this entire tier and think I will manage to kill mythic bosses.
---
Simple things? Maybe... But this game was never made with touch-based controls in mind. Walking and navigating would be a goddamn nightmare
---
Scrolling....scrolling...ahh, there it is.
---
Yes, this is the truth. 
---
Anyone saying 10+ gold from censoring skins doesn't have a clue.
---
That it they're solely grinding beasts for skinning and not questing,  which means they're going slow as hell... will be behind the curve. It's best to just level fast as possible, get to 60/almost 60, and start making 50-100+ gold an hour.
---
Will u guys roll on the scandinavian megaserver? http://nordicclassic.jinnis.se/
---
I would extend this to religion as well unless you are a guild that advertises that it welcomes or focuses on faith based activities. It's unfortunate maybe but I've never seen any policy but zero tolerance actually work for keeping these conversations in check. Anything else just encourages too much runaway personal conflict when inevitably people disagree, and then if the conversation is squashed, disagree even louder about how it was handled (no matter who or what was allowed or disallowed).
---
The up side of this is that after a while you realize that when you never have any idea what peoples' IRL views are on politics or religion, you can get along nicely for years with loads of folks you probably would not give the time of day to if you knew more. We may not all have a lot in common, but in-game, we can all agree that it's a nice place to forget whatever we don't share and just have some fun.
---
Yeah I won't get a single level but I will set up as many addons/macros/ui as I can. Excited to mess around with it and nice to get it done before launch.
---
Why would a hunter have the disease in the first place?
---
4 hours a day and you define yourselves as casual? ROFL.
---
yeah not sure when they were added but i started fairly late but there still was no oce servers when i started , it may have been before bc when they made them i forget
---
1. Be nice.
---
2. Have fun.
---
3. No begging.
---
In Vanilla you should get look just for finding 40 people
---
All those keys and still no way to unlock your chastity belt
---
Mana Sting. Screw you hunters!
---
Deadmines, DM.
---
That'd be a great game! You log in and start walking around, waving hello to other players and help them with quests which are mostly picking flowers and delivering supplies from one village to another.

VIPER STING!
---
Banshee curse in SFK. If theres no decurser, Im not running it
---
I resubbed retail yesterday and spent half an hour in the capital cities checking if some of my retro items were worth any gold. 
---
The first thing I noticed was the absolute silence in chats. Nobody talked except for the occasional trade chat. It seems the sense of community is completely and utterly gone. I assume it has been moved to little bubbles: guilds, discord channels etc. But the world community, something that made vanilla WoW so great is just gone.
---
And then the inflation. Omg, the inflation! Some of my retro food was worth 1500g o.O
---
Damage inflation/stat inflation is a pet peeve of mine too. Why didn't they get rid of a couple of zero's here and there.
---
&gt;Tailoring/Enchanting (Being able to make your own bags as well as making your own wands for leveling is really helpful, also at the start of a new server bags are high demand so can make some good money there)
---
I still have this on the warlock i rolled in vanilla actually :) easy to level and you get a lot of benefits from it while leveling. I cant recall if it really gave a lot of gold though as i think i used most of it (pre-60) for my own needs.
---
Ok there patriot andy. We europoors have dealt with this all our lives. Let us complain that we had false hope we would get 50% off of dominos in peace
---
Seems a bit off, but those are without talents then? You do end up with around 30% with normal buffs/consumes still, but i expect all this will do is make crit more valuable and in turn change the bis list away from hit chance a bit to compensate, lowering the end result but for sure closing the gap between rogues and warriors.
---
Single target wise, at least, warriors just have a bit more cleave, so they are still going to be seen as the better dps, alongside being needed for offtanking in fury talents, but tbh rogues not being top mdps is bad design, they definitely should have gotten that with how the class is designed, at least for single target.
---
KuiNameplates is being made for Classic: https://github.com/kesava-wow/kuinameplates2/tree/classic
---
I don't know how far along it is or if it does what you're asking. TidyPlates is dead, ThreatPlates is the replacement and the developer has only expressed interest in a Classic version but has made no progress.
---
Came here hoping to find this very comment, have my upvote.
---
Listen, *I'm* gonna raid with 10 enhancement shamans and 15 balance druids because *my* guild is morally superior. We don't need to min-max, okay? It's a crutch. Besides, vanilla was so easy that monkeys could do it, it's just that humans hadn't evolved to comprehend raiding in those days. People were barely literate in 2004.
---
If you want to join our guild, you're welcome to apply. Currently 39 raid spots open. We expect to clear MC after a week. The plan is to have two raid teams that take turns raiding each week, so everyone gets at least a full clear every two weeks. That way you get plenty of rest. I wanted to let both teams raid every week but I can't figure out how to set up a second voice channel on Discord.
---
35-42ish hours.
---
grinding and skinning is a good combination and gives more than 30-50 Gold.
---
Mining is extremely profitable.
---
Also add fishing - free ingredients for a lot of food - as well as other professions (alchemy).
---
Frostbite procs, as a rogue those hurt my soul.
---
Lul
---
always hunter and so often answered the question. skinning and mining.
---
Yep, far as i remember it was like that, you'd have to flag up to engage.
---
...thats when the 10 Alliance rogues would appear behind you!
---
Haha, fair enough. I hope you do.
---
How is night elf weeb in any way shape or form?
---
been playing wow on a 55'  Samsung mid range 2018 smart TV. it is legit. 4k and 120hz so is good spec. got it on offer for about £900.
---
wow looks amazing on a big screen and is something worth experiencing. however after using a tv for a number of Months I am moving to monitor and here's why.
---
first point is screen tearing, which doesn't bother me much but I do notice it regularly. people on this thread have mentioned TV's being 60FPS ? which I don't get as my tv is 120Hz so surely it can reach 120 FPS? however I notice VERY LITTLE difference when I'm playing wow at 60fps compared to 100fps. I mean I swear I can notice some difference but nothing dramatic. could be as im using a HDMI as up until few days ago I thought were king but now Display port is apparently?
---
second and main reason is immersion, I never feel very immersed as I am sat further away from the screen compared to a monitor sat at a desk. for me immersion is massive and main reason I've chosen to buy a monitor for wow classic. 
---
I am looking at a 34 inch Ultrawide which apparently make all the difference with Wow? if someone with one could clarify?? so if you have a bit of money I would advise going for ultrawide. I have found a good one for cheap its 3440 x 1440p and 100hz for just over £300 [click this to see screen](https://www.laptopsdirect.co.uk/electriq-35-wqhd-100hz-hdr-height-and-tilt-adjustable-curved-gaming-monito-eiq-35cmuwq100gafsh/version.asp?wgu=272145_116019_15651696096974_6b262c643b&amp;wgexpiry=1572945609&amp;utm_source=digidip%20GmbH&amp;utm_medium=webgains&amp;refsource=webgains). but even that is still quite expensive you can get smaller screens with higher Hz's rate for much cheaper.
---
let us know what you decide to do.
---
I just installed the classic wow client and it had a Korean language option
---
&gt;but eventually itll be easy and uninteresting.
---
Then you don't have to play any more. It's fine.
---
The bests class will be hunter or mage I would say. IMO I think hunter will be the best.
---
Dont quote me on this but Druid’s can herb/skin without changing out of form which could be a huge time save. You will have to confirm this yourself.

Yeah, I'm aware of how wasteful and inefficient some tax money can be but I think you underestimates the importance of tax money for a state to function and actually help people in need (hence my confusion in the whole moral thing). In the end this whole discussion just comes down to trust in the government.
---
what? i never said you were an ass.
---
/spit   
---
/rude   
---
That's a fair amount of baseless assumptions.
---
Playing on private servers, which are a far more concentrated and lawless "toxic" environment than classic is going to be, assholes were almost always shut down in dungeons.
---
You'll come to discover that the scary, elitist boogeymen are usually contained within their own cliques.
---
How are the quest on these areas? Never leveled thouse places. Not on vanilla nor retail.
---
Okay then “i get that, but the argument that "you should know mechanics" shouldn't give someone a pass for being an ass.” This is irrelevant. Because just don’t ever be an ass.
---
*cries in prot pally*
---
What is the problem with eating taurens ?
---
Rend as a rogue in battlegrounds -_-
---
Sorry but not funny.
---
Sounds like you haven't played on private servers? If you plan on **farming** your gold I suggest going hunter, they're simply the best when it comes to farming gold. 
---
If you wanna **flip** your gold instead any class will do really. Best professions for gold making are very situational but enchanting, blacksmithing and alchemy are the easiest to make gold with, you do require to have a lot of recipes though.
---
Yea even on pvp server he would have to have a lowbie horde attack him, or have pvped recently. He's not goona have much fun there.
---
&gt; This is irrelevant. Because just don’t ever be an ass.
---
my motto
---
Hoping that Ninja going over to Mixer helps it really kick off. Sick and tired of all the adverts on Twitch. Having Prime made Twitch great, but now it's lost it's advertising feature it's wank.
---
30 second advert every time I open a new stream? 2 minutes of adverts every 10 minutes?
---
I've reached a point where I don't even watch streams anymore because of the adverts. I did look at Mixer but it was dead... so maybe this will help it gain some traction.
---
Is there a reddit equivalent of corpse camping?
---
Replying to all his posts on any sub with /spit maybe? :P
---
wtf is this
---
I would argue that Human Warlock could potentially be the best race/class combo for gold farming. Bonus reputation (discounted vendors, of course), Warlock mount costs nothing, solo potential is high, and the class itself is fun. Affliction could be a really good spec for mob farming
---
Rumor has it he invented golf as well .... might just be lies though.
---
&gt; and therefore replace you in a raid.
---
Just saying, as an officer in a raiding guild. That's not why you got benched. Unless your raid leader is an idiot, in which case that is your problem, not your gear.
---
&gt; Beyond raiding, dungeons, and PVP 
---
Isn't that enough?
---
US, probably Horde.
---
Depends on what's possible to farm. If Hunter trib farm is possible, then that's a clear winner. If not, then if mage BRD farm is doable then that will likely be the way to go.
---
Either way, both of those classes are likely the best options.
---
&gt;  to
---
I've never felt the need to backpeddle in my entire life of playing wow
---
Is there any specific reason you're not using adblock when adblock would literally solve every problem you just mentioned?
---
I have ~ for auto run and alt ~ for mount/dismount
---
What's the hardest class to kill in pvp ( not necessarily win the fight, just get out alive) judging by the amount of anti-classes on the server. Rogue, Hunter, Mage, or anyone else?
---
Gonna live my guldan fantasy and orc'lock it up. Stun lock me if you can!
---
Idk about city layout, all the relevant parts are on the same island or a single offshoot. How often do you actually use a trainer or visit a faction leader at 60?
---
Also the closest repair vendor in org is inside (the gun/ammo guy next to ah) and trade vendor is also inside at the other end of the plaza, so even worse.
---
If I want to stand still and show off I can just play that piece of shit ESO.
---
You can level in the undead area. It doesnt really matter. 
---
Also if you are following a step by step leveling guide it doesnt really matter cause all starter area's are kinda the same they will all get you to around lvl 12 and from what point the leveling guides really start.
---
My first child is due November 29th. At least you get to enjoy the first 8 or so months of Classic!
---
I just say stuff like "I like healing and I can fire off a dick joke in the midst of an intense raid encounter"
---
About 18% will be Warriors.
---
If you're a class that has to stop to eat and or drink every few pulls that time spent skinning can actually make a huge difference to how many you can kill before having to eat/drink early on.
---
Login and create a character, choose a name - make sure the looks are exactly like you want as you cant change them later on in classic.
---
Silithid Pox if you're a warrior. Basically, you can't play for 30 minutes
---
Yeah well immersion is probably the biggest factor to me too. I'm thinking a smaller screen would be more intimate for something like wow
---
Flying is also and will always be incompatible with pre-Cata Azeroth.
---
Definitely a troll, reported and blocked, bye retard.
---
This question comes up several times a week, so I’ll just keep posting the same response...
---
I can tell you from experience that you won’t be riding a saber for a long time. In the Beta, I only reached 3,715/21,000 revered with Darnassus by level 40, despite completing nearly every single Darnassus quest as well as most Alliance quests that gave spillover Darnassus rep. After Desolace and Feralas quests, you’d have to supplement with Morrowgrain/Un’Goro Soil turn-ins at level 47 and/or Runecloth turn-ins at level 50 to finally achieve exalted.
---
You can read through my entire quest completionist route here:

You can also find a complete list of Darnassus quests with correct rep values here:

I got permabanned on LH once for using recklessnes as a warrior when ganking in Burning Steppes. After two days of waiting for a response, they said I was "crit abusing", and refused to listen to anything I had to say. After about a week with my entire guild constantly harassing them for an answer 24/7 they actually decided to look at my case, and I got unbanned within 5 minutes. So yes, they will absolutely ban for anything they feel like. 
---
It was a manual ban, so a GM actually took the time to ban me (not some automated program). Probably ganked him one time too many and he got mad.
---
They did have free server transfers back in the day, to potentially relieve a server of some faction unbalance.
---
I down voted without reading. Have a nice day
---
Am stuck between Rogue, Druid &amp; Warrior. I was considering ranged classes but it isn't my style. 
---
In terms of gameplay I like Druid the most, I like tanking dungeons, I enjoy having self healing, their little teleport, form swapping for root break etc. However I feel like Druid is a class that has a more limited form of character progression; as in gear isn't as important for growing your character. Partly its because you dont really scale that well, use weird World and dungeon drops, and animal forms hide your appearance. 
---
Warrior seems good because I like the challenging nature of levelling with them and how things like food, bandages matter. Also how you can equip the heaviest armour. I like tanking too. However my concern is that its not a very solo friendly class and I do like to play solo a lot of the time. 
---
For Rogue I enjoy the stealth plus all the side RPG elements like pickpocketing, lockpicking &amp; poisons. They seem straightforward in a good way. Roles are limited though and likely face lots of competition.
---
Yeah but with bad sex I'd rather leave and have a wank.
---
Isn't it reduced by just 4.8% from crit aura suppression?

Classic wasn't just announced last week. Should of wrapped it to delay that until you were 60. Not planning ahead. Rip
---
Damn...
---
Literally... Escape artist
---
They're fun. I like Teldrassil and Darkshore, but you'll end up running *a lot* in Darkshore if don't optimize your route.
---
Its quite amazing what a motivating force classic is isn’t it? It really helps motivate me to focus on the work, limit fun activity and take care of my health, not to mention build good will with the misses (who is thankfully awesomely understanding of my hype)
---
This sounds like something an scummy Alliance would write 😂
---
Nothing remains to be seen. Warriors were the best DPS from the very get go and it's also only natural. Warriors are the pillar of RPG elements. They sort of kinda needed to be the strongest ones. This also has nothing to do with private servers. Just check most of the better guilds videos on all of the mc/bwl bosses. Warriors were king (always assuming same weapon levels as competing melees).
---
Abort mission
---
Spinebreaker? You mean ”Spain-breaker”?
---
No posts on Laughing Skull, clearly the server was full of core players(and P4L/BBZ) who can't be bothered to play retail, hence no one can post.
---
20Mbps down 5Mbps up should be more than enough for all types of playing and multiboxing and discord. The only reason to go more than that for gaming is if you intend on streaming or others in your house like watching netflix/youtube while you're gaming. Or if you just want to download patches faster.

Horde aren’t flagged-  What I used to do on my warlock was do /duel to the lowbies and then cancel/quit the duel mid fight so that they’d attack me and I could proceed to corpse camp them
---
You keep saying about mailing cost which is 30c per stack, which is virtually nothing. On top of that, you will be vendoring the majority of skins/leather anyway so what does that matter. Just make multiple bank alts if space is a real concern, which it shouldn't be.

That's some wisdom right here. You have to be a Rank 14 husband

Hydrocane maybe? Nice list, I've been saving some youtube videos with lists like this but it'd be good to have it on paper like this.

I grinded my first p-server char to 60 without doing any quests beyond level 18 (the usual alliance stuff, starter-area, westfall, redridge). I was playing a night elf hunter and visited all the fun places I remembered as a kid and grinded the living hell out of them. It got tedious on the 40-50 part but I experienced the same thing when I later leveld with optimized quest-routes. To shorten this post:  
---
  *Im looking to spend as much uptime grinding as possible to keep ahead of the pack.*   
---
Will only work if you know places of mobs that are not used for quests (also consider PvP-competition in the later stages) which limits the type of mobs you can farm at an efficent rate.
---
 *Do you think this will be slower than questing?*   
---
A 100% you will be slower than any player that knows his/her way around efficent quests routes. It is a common misconception from players who did not experience older MMOs that grinding is something different that questing but instead questing in Vanilla can be understood like the X that marks the spot for you to explore and kill mobs for a small bonus reward (xp/silver/gear).
---
I have a bit, and in general, you could pretty much write a bot in a macro back then. Today you cant abuse the WoW API, and blizzard are waaay better at detecting bots.
---
Druid or Mage are best at escaping and being hard to lock down. Pally, Lock or Warrior are best at face tanking.
---
birth control my dude
---
Uh no, Warriors were garbage DPS until the talent changes in Vanilla and Private Servers erroneously inflated the capability of Warriors.
---
Great idea. Thank you!
---
They can't tell, so it doesn't matter in the slightest.
---
Most of the people that make guides like that already lvled a bunch of characters to lvl 60. So they are rushing. 
---
So unless you are rushing i would just lvl my professions while lvling.
---
Read the tiny book that came with the CDs and said, hmm I like the sound of that. And just did that.
---
I would like some "light tunning" to some speccs!
---
I don't mind and never did in any game that has hybrid classes that said hybrids with their dps builds do less damage than pure dps classes...because those hybrids have more flexibility and more options and paths of gameplay.
---
But what I don't like are those builds being so  "meh" that they don't simply dont work on a group setting, clipping said flexibility and turning the tables: instead of more options you have less options now.
---
I will give you one of the worst offenders on Classic: Retribution Paladin.
---
I don't necessary think they should do a lot more damage and make them content for the top of the metters. I mean they could do that, I personally wouldn't mind much but I don't think thats the best idea.
---
They could give them "something", an incredible utility tool, buff or debuff that would make them  very desireable or even crutial to your raid group.
---
That specc, even not amazing DPS Wise would be with that change TOTALLY VIABLE.
---
They did this with some speccs, Balance Druid is "meh" DPS wise due to mana conservation issues but the aura they provide totally compensate that.
---
I just feel they forgot some of the Speccs...
---
And in later expansions, instead of sticking with the hybrid concept, that I personally like, they went with my 1st approach (which I don't like): everybody can pull great DPS, everybody has tools for every scenario (or almost), one third of your classes can Combat Ress, another third can bloodlust, etc, etc...
---
I mean the problem was solved...but at the cost of class identity!
---
My stepdad played a Hunter... I wanted 2 be just like him.. So i played a hunter.. Made him look the same 2.. Even got the same gear when i hit 60.
---
If alliances were starting tauren breedings, I would join them !
---
I'd like to play a class with a chance against anyone in PvP.
---
I played warrior when I was a kid and got shat on by mages and it sucked.
---
I've been thinking either warlock or Hunter, thoughts?
---
Early as possible, the raids take a lot of downtime - managing 39 other noobs is not a quick thing. Also, make sure to start 30 minutes AT LEAST before the actual raiding time - again, getting 40 people in on time is near impossible, make sure you have enough warlocks (willing) to summon those slackers.
---
depression room\* FTFY
---
And lol
---
Because the "Warrior" is a pillar-stone of classical RPG elements. They were - very likely - the first class to be designed by anyone in the game. Just next to the Priest and the Mage. Those three are evidently the most fleshed out classes in Classic WoW. And it's only understandable given their meaning to RPG in the widest of contexts.
---
They were not overpowered but they were simply the best at what they were supposed to do. Either deal shitton of damage or take it. All the other classes were designed later and while they should come close (ideally) to what the classical RPG-Pillars do, they were never meant to overtake them. That's something that only came later in the game-process due to player feedback.
---
Warlocks beat anything. You can make every class struggle against you.
---
I had no idea what I was doing. Did the same as you chose the evilest, ugliest thing I saw. Undead lock with a purple Mohawk and a swinging jaw. Still my main to this day.
---
I had an educated guess when back when I was 10 in 2005. DRUID TURNS INTO ANYMALS I PLAY DRUID
---
Getting to see the raid content in retail is a joke tho. You can literally press a button to q and afk. Same for most of its content. Accessibility has its place, but it makes the content so meaningless to me. The only reason to choose higher difficulty is higher item lvl on gear, which doesn’t matter in pvp anyway (or so it seems, since they won’t share the pvp gear scaling formula, another massive shortcoming of Beta for ass a lot)
---
Druids turn into bears, no other class turns into bears.
---
daze
---
Idk, I did that on Nostalrius but I started regretting it around lvl 40. I started to get withdrawals lmao. I just really don't like the Alliance races besides Night Elf.
---
I think my first character was a human warrior. Played for a while and it didn't really appeal to me so I decided to try a hunter as having a pet was something that really appealed to me-I ended up falling in love with the class and will be rolling another hunter come Classic.
---
Rfc is easier.
---
I don’t personally, but somebody posted something on it a few weeks back (maybe even a video) and said it played surprisingly well all things considered.  Will require some setting up for sure, but should be able to get some basic quests and things like that done which is better than nothing.
---
Blackfathom Deeps, end boss has a poison spit that affects everyone. Zul'Farrak has a few rooms with lots of beetles where it's nice to throw down a disease cleansing. 
---
The places where you can use these totems are few and far between but when you do need them, they're sooo nice to have. That's my view as a healer at least, primarily what I'll be doing in dungeons.
---
if your going to be solo, avoid warrior. i would go druid if i was you.
---
Can I ask you some insight about why you hated it please ?  
---
I'm an alliance guy but friends wants to go horde for classic.  
---
I'm about to agree "for new experience purpose".  
---
Not quite convinced yet though
---
i dont know why but the knock-down that some vulture mobs do absolutely infuriates me.  its just a stun like any other, but for some reason i find it more annoying.  maybe its their stupid squawking or the addition of bleed dots...
---
No, that needs updating: https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/bug-berserker-stance/196414
---
They found it was reduced by ~6% and Blizzard confirmed it was not a bug in that thread.
---
Would their dps be inflated by anything but the lower parry chance?
---
Can't wait to jump off the bridge at the start and skip some of this long ass instance
---
Sap.
---
And there seems to be nothing  I can do about it except for sitting it out.
---
Agreed, fair points. Keeping and maintaining a 40 man team is more difficult than keeping 25 tho, I think that was his main standpoint. In vanilla player retention was also more important due to the scarcity of gear.
---
&gt; Just DE greens I dont need and sell the mats - is that viable? Does anyone know?
---
Enchaniting mats until level 40 are dirt cheap because the AH is flodded with them. It's better to DE cheap gear (cloth and leather) and vendor the more expensive pieces (plate is almost always better to be vendored, even after 40 I think). It depends a little bit on the economy on your server, but if you start with the launch, I don't think it will be much different regardless.
---
Horde were for the outcasts, the downtrodden, those who didn't fit in and banded together. A true alliance formed on common grounds.
---
The alliance was just a bunch teenage brats who wanted sexy female night elves and humans.
---
Confirming this.... I used to be an ally priest and I love minmaxing but hate hate hate dwarves... it was a tough time!

Everyone had about 3% more crit chance on Pservers too because [the hidden aura reduction](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/bug-berserker-stance/196414) wasn't known. That means less Flurry procs.

enchanting isn't something you want to have on your main character.
---
with skill 1/300 you can enchant every item, even 60 epics.
---
level an alt to 5, place it in the main city and send him everything you want to enchant. then you got mats for enchants on your main, and you can sell the rest. 
---
this way you don't waste a profession slot on your main.
---
Vanish it Baby
---
what if Thrall would have been aborted
---
I have no real intention of playing anything other than Warlock.
---
I've only played a ranged caster / tank since vanilla. (with all classes played, just a few never to beyond 40/50). 
---
Is there a melee life option that would be fun for me? 
---
I enjoy doing well on meters in raids, and I enjoy being a pain to deal with / generally great in PvP.
---
i'm guessing that's gonna be like a ban-able exploit on classic?
---
I don't see the badge systems as the same.  Badges still had to be collected which took time and was also a part of the expansions from early on.  If anything it was a supplement to guarantee that you improved over time even if items were not dropping for you.  When I hear welfare gear I think of the Baleful items from Tanaan Jungle that gave just-below-raid-level gear for basically nothing and could be transferred across your characters.  You could collect a whole set in a matter of days.
---
I'd say it's because they look good and their racial are the worst.  
---
Also female dance  
---
A bit saved by druids though
---
Pretty sure if you go further down on that page they reacted to blizzards response, redoing the tests to confirm 4.84%, and then updating the github.
---
&gt; but if you don't have money to buy a mount then its a horrible feeling.
---
Hunters run with 36% without a mount anyway. If you have to farm for a mount as hunter and don't make good XP progress, you are doing it wrong. IIRC hunters are faster than mounting up for 20+ seconds. It really only matters over longer distances and those you should avoid while leveling fast anyway. Once you get to the point where you have to travel long more often, you should have enough for your mount.
---
The web is a British\Swiss invention
---
&gt;Really the issue with balance isn't that a couple classes are too strong it's that a couple are too weak behind the rest imo. In particular druid, pally(non holy), and hunter(pve).
---
And I am still going to play Resto Druid, knowing what you just said beforehand.
---
Being totally honest here, not sure what makes me: an idiot that could just pick Priest or Paladin and pull way bigger numbers...or very commited and loyal with the class and its hybrid nature.
---
Criminally underrated comment.
---
I mean it's in Azeroth.
---
Well, I wanted to play a dwarf. So, shaman, druid, mage and warlock were already out.
---
Pure warriors and rogues were never my style (usually in RPGs my character is a pure mage or battlemage character). Hunter is a pet class and I don't like pet classes.
---
So, I'm left with Paladin and Priest. I apply my D&amp;D as well as my WC 3 knowledge and settle on paladin, as I felt this would best give the paladin vibe and thought priests would be mostly focused on healing.
---

Theres actaully alot you can craft with LW from your skinning mats that will sell for more than just the skin to a vendor.
---
Mages never seemed OP to me, other than their ability to always escape Wpvp with a poly.
---
They hardcounter certain classes, and are hardcountered themselves by others.
---
If the phases are any shorter than 6 months they may as well not have phases at all and just release it all at the start. 
---
For the majority of players it'll be the same anyway.
---
Why do a "challenge" that isn't really challenging and just makes the game more boring?
---
This legit happened to me. We’re 14 weeks along and don’t get me wrong. I’m thrilled, but I think what I’m more excited for is getting my kid hooked just like I am. Then the girlfriend can hear about WoW twice as much.
---
Not a quest item, but Piccolo of the Flaming Fire is my favorite.
---
In my opinion rolling PvE is like installing 100% of the game and then deliberately limiting yourself to only be able to access 75% of it. Nobody enjoys being ganked, but the frustration is accompanied by feelings of excitement when you evade attackers, or elation when you experience something outside the usual killing mobs.
---
On a PvE server, you enter a zone and you know exactly what you are there for and what's going to happen. If you see another player, you probably aren't going to interact with them because you don't need to.
---
On a PvP server, you never know who you will encounter, and that results in much more varied gameplay. It can be less enjoyable, but it can also be a lot more enjoyable. It's worth the trade for me.
---
It also makes them immune to viper sting, it's an awesome racial

---
Lol, what? Try UCLA, funded by the U.S. defense department.
---
Nah, DK's on WotlK release were far too stupid.
---
If you played arenas and you weren't a DK you were essentially trolling. The only viable healers were paladins because they were the best ones with/against DK's.
---
Then, hunters became kind of a thing... Because they were really good with/against DK's. They literally were tiers above any other class during Season 5, and season 6 they got nerfed hard but still were the best by far. (Goes to show how strong they were in s5).
---
Then they got nerfed hard and became one of the worst classes in WotlK.
---
In PvE they were quite strong too, in both dps and tank duty.
---
Yes, a later comment quotes the github page you linked, but even later comments dispute this and suggest their tests were not sufficient at all, especially since their "retest" of ~4.8% did not match their first test of ~6%.
---
Where's the peeing tube and the feeding tube?

We'll hopefully those investors are also investing in private servers if that's the case because that's where everyone will go.

Thought you needed to kill Jandice to get her key and open the door?
---
Oh no!
---
I came from Diablo 2 to WoW. My favorite class was the Necromancer. 
---
The logical conclusion what to roll as Wow's release: Undead Warlock
---
🤔
---
What any teenage Asian kid would do. Play a rogue.
---
Yeah, I was excited for willitclassic until I started using it and realized  more than half of the addons just link to 8.2 versions and probably won’t work.  
---
Need find a database that only posts working confirmed Classic specific addons.
---
It's 30 days. So don't fuck up character creation! ;)
---
Go Orc Warlock. Rogues &amp; Warriors are one of Warlocks weaknesses and the stun resistance helps mitigate that.
---
What I mean in terms of gear progression being better in OSRS is that they introduce new pieces of gear but they don’t invalidate the gear you already have. They are better in certain areas of the game unlike in wow which are just across the board stat increases which do invalidate the gear you have.
---
30 res isnt "+13% chance to resist", maybe its ~13% resist chance in total including the base resist/miss chance. 30 magical resistance is somewhere around ~7.5% additional average resist-chance (https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Formulas:Magical_resistance).
---
But you also have to account that in pvp some classes have resistance-ignoring or lowering talents or spells like mage's passive 10 res ignore talent and very late in the game theres even resistance-lowering stats on caster gear, which is when "low" resistances becomes pretty much equal to having none.
---
"We use loot council" 
---
Casual guilds don't care about gear, tank item droped? You are a tank? You need it? Roll for it with every other tank.
---
Council loot is excuse to just gear up your buddys and be first to get the end game gear. This system only works in hard core guilds that strive to acomplish their goals over anything else.
---
Even though I'm a Horde player, Alliance definitely has the better questing experience. They're better written, better designed, and there's just a lot more of them. Their "exclusive" dungeons are also better.
---
For Alliance I'd say: Dwarf/Gnome &gt; Human &gt; Night Elf
---
For Horde I'd say: Tauren &gt; Undead &gt; Orc/Troll
---
Times change. I was surprised to see the amount of women in my current guild. It's almost 50 50.

---
Lots of raiding time np
---
Don´t think it stays reserved after deletion, otherwise what is the point of only 3 names? You could just keep reserving names.
---
As the other guy said I think I'll give my bank alt Enchanting cause that's genius. I can send him the stuff I want to DE and keep skinning and tailoring.
---
I am going to play solo for the most part, both due to the fact that I cannot commit to a guild schedule, and that it also fits my playstyle better.
---
In this sense, I am thinking of rolling a hunter, which most people seems to highlight as the best solo class. Warlock is often  cited aswell. Is there any other low-key good solo class, in your opinion?
---
I think i will cherish my nostalgia and level the human areas. And maybe later on grind the rep for saber
---
I was 12 back then so I didn't have any friends in-game. Just me and my wolf.

You can vanish while already stealthed to give yourself a high enough stealth level to open on the lock without being seen. Same vs perception.

---
The main reason I dont play alliance is i cant stand there leveling. Horde ftw.
---
Some might say it's a *classic*. Good choice!
---
Bruh
---
There is an old myth about the creation of the game where they finished Alliance zones and quests first and then had to rush Horde.
---
Teach your toddlers the art of herbing, skinning and/or mining. Let them at it while you rest. Profit.
---
Horde is faster, Alliance is more enjoyable.
---
I heard people getting in trouble because of things like this, be careful.
---
Huh, I used the same formula but definitely got OOP wrong to arrive at 13%, yes, it's 7.5%.
---
Druid is an honest consideration for me. I don't mind the idea of doing all three jobs while leveling (well, realistically healing/tanking). 
---
Rogue is definitely something I'm considering. It was the first toon I ever rolled... but never got it past 25 or 30 in vanilla. 
---
Cheers.
---
Excuse me? You got a problem with my forsaken brothers and sisters...? Dont worry, there's still enough plague for you. Filthy alliance scum.  :p

Found the Retail player.

I'm gonna play as a priest, so Anathema/Benediction definitely! Thanks for the suggestion!

Why the fuck are you using IE?

---
Even on retail names don't stay reserved to an account after character deletion, if the character was level 1. It's only after you've leveled the character that it counts (same deal with name changes). You'll be able to reserve the name for others. [Read this](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/reserve-your-name-in-wow-classic-on-august-12-at-3-00-p-m-pdt/242723/141)

If possible, get fiber instead of DSL. Any kind of DSL connection is more than enough to play the game and even download it since it's only ~4GB.

He can queue three times as much!
---
Personally going to level a hunter with only skinning for extra vendor gold. At 60 i am going to grab enchanting (leave at level 1) while i farm mara over and over until i have a big amount of gold to last me a long time. If you get unlucky with drops and get the 1-2g items, you can DE them and sell for 3-4g each instead on AH. Will drop both skinning and enchanting after im a rich boi.
---
Yes simpler days, we didn't have much information just choosing what we like!!!
---
Played paladin in Everquest and wanted to actually do something in raids, but with the minimum responsibility possible. Initially looked at mage, but the CC looked like it might be a hassle so went warlock. 
---
Necromancers were also able to actually solo things in EQ and I thought warlocks might be able to do that too, shouldn't have worried ;-)
---
Well a keyboard you can use any keyboard tbh
---
But a gaming mouse with loads of extra buttons is excellent for mmo’s unless you are a clicker
---
You‘ll need some massive gaming keyboard if you want to hotkey every oldschool button, but for standard gameplay with some klicking and shift-combo-keys you are totally fine with the usual stuff
---
That tiny chain looks so fucking scary. If it breaks, balllll crusher!
---
A mouse with Buttons on the side is definitely worth it, like the Logitech G600 or Razer Naga
---
We all have different perceptions as to how things looked like 15 years ago. I stick to the version I have in my head considering I've cleared all the content very close to the time of release ;)
---
I've never heard of anyone using IE. What is wrong with you?
---
/spit
---
Oh right!
---
Or private servers lol
---
I've been thinking of rolling priest, they are quite good at solo leveling. I tried it out on a relatively blizzlike pserver. Your tankiness and damage both are decent, but most importantly with the right build (wand+spirit tap) there's virtually no downtime to restore mana or health. 
---
You just go from one mob to another, wanding everything to death. But it may be tougher to solo elites than a pet class.
---
Can't learn professions before level 5
---
Personally it did not feel right as I was alliance for many years. I only kept seeing enemies all over the place that I want to kill but unable to.
---
Also, horde cities are horrible. The most populated city was Orgrimmar, which felt so red and humid, I feel like sweating when I was there. The only other place that wasn't absolutely deserted was Undercity, and that place was dead as fuck.
---
That fucking disease is basically a giant KILL ME sign because it turns you green too.
---
I'd been raiding in EQ for a couple of years, so yes. That knowledge was almost a negative in WoW though, as the classes and mechanics are different and my guild were trying to play WoW in an EQ style - we came over as a guild.
---
We assumed hunters we're 'pullers' for example, and would always be attempting single pulls in dungeons (as two mobs in EQ = death most likely). It was a shitshow ;-)
---
Take into account that endgame druid means healing.
---
I know there’s a lot of talks here about “Druid can” but in 4 months from now when it gets real you will either heal or jump through a million hoops just to be average (pots, grinding gnomer for mace, in/out of cat every 4-5 sec etc.).
---
Only in BWL+ does druid finally start getting some decent feral gear.
---
How viable is holy paladin to heal dungeons while leveling, all the way from DM to BRD?
---
Nah, he'll prob just be buying gold from susanexpress, lmao.
---
Can confirm. Both claims.
---
I mean... 
---
Both sides has shit heads and old people alike.
---
Horde, for some reason, always seemed to be a stronger and more tightknit group where  everyone had each other's back.
---
So basically less played classes are now going to be most played classes due to people wanting to try a new class.
---
What if i own a pizza restaurant, should i go close for the launch annual holliday. Or should i stay open and order myself a pizza?

I just quit OSRS and got my acc banned intentionally so it wouldn't interfere with playing Classic WoW. As much as MMORPGs by the very definition are grindfests, OSRS started to seem kind of pointless - and I'm very sure it will soon be ruined with MTX and all that crap. Not to mention it really isn't "Old School" at all any more.
---
Out of mage/rogue, I was going to play mage originally (nobody else in my group was going to play one and I enjoy frost pvp/solo play/quality of life spells). However, I'm worried about the ZG/AQ/Naxx phase and constantly respeccing fire to pve and frost to pvp/solo. I know pretty much every class has this dilemma with pve vs pvp specs, but at that gear level (assuimg you can get the right gear), SF daggers is enjoyable in both pve and pvp and equal to frost mage for me in that regard. Is respeccing all the time on the mage going to be unsustainable (maybe pve fire spec isn't as frustrating as it seems it would be in pvp and I don't respec a lot in the end?), or do I just grind it out all the way with rogue to eventually play SF daggers and not be "forced" to respec all the time?
---
That's gonna be a \[Citation needed\] from me, dog.
---
Even if it's a thing, no one's gonna give a boomkin their Neltharion's Tear and every single caster bis item just so he can barely compete with a bottom scraping hunter in a specific tier.
---
It really only becomes a "meme spec"when you're 60 and raiding.  For leveling and pvp it's a perfectly fine spec.  It's also not impossible to throw on some healing gear and keep your group alive while specced enhancement.
---
Thats no myth, it's been confirmed numerous times already by devs

That sounds good. At the very least, it would make an impact to (somewhat) minimize the runecloth turn-ins at 60. 
---
Also your guide is really helpful. I’ll be following that once Classic is released.
---
Hey, you're right, but consider this.. Your bank will have alot of space. You could potentially save all the bop stuff you want to de, and at 60 (or 40) drop skinning for enchanting then disenchant.

Naxx won't be out for at least a year. Imo you shouldn't worry about respec costs for Naxx content out the gate. You can reasonably have both a rogue and mage at 60 by then, or have accumulated so much gold that the 50g respec cost doesn't phase you.

Also having the switch back and forth is a personal choice. You can PvP as fire, or PvP on an alt, twink, etc

WASD for movement (A and D are strafe)
---
I use all 6 action bars and shift through them as per normal (I am left handed mouse so using right hand on WASD makes doing Shift + 1 etc pretty easy and quick for me)
---
From left to right order:
---
1-6, Shift A, Shift D, Shift Q, Shift E, Q, E
---
My bottom left extra action bar is:
---
Alt + 1-6, Ctrl/Shift/Alt + Mouse Wheel Button, Mouse Wheel Button (by itself), Ctrl + Q, Ctrl + E
---
My bottom right extra action bar is:
---
R, Shift R, Z, Shift Z, Ctrl + R, Ctrl + Z, ~, Shift/Ctrl/Alt + ~, Shift T, Ctrl T
---
I always bind Health Pot to R, Bandage to Shift R, Hearthstone to Ctrl T, and Autoshot to Shift T.
---
I use the alt modifier when it casts spells on yourself if holding Alt, so I always ensure my self-castable spells (including heals) are not on 1-6 (as my additional action bar variable includes alt for these).
---
I am definitely looking forward to making my life a bit easier with macros. I only started using the additional action bars maybe 6 months ago on the PS I play on, mainly for downranking.

It would have looked funny watching me play prior to using the additional action bars as I would have to cycle through all 6 different action bars to do stuff, so during intense moments if there was a camera facing my keyboard, my hand would go mental. But I’ve always played like that until 6 months ago and I’ve always been proficient with it. Nice to change things up though :)
---
That makes sense for mats I guess. But I was actually thinking of getting the prof to max for the endgame enchants. So, my guess is that it's still worth to go for gathering first and mail all my greens to an alt with enchanting.
---
Yet even in my animal forms, I'm still more civilized than most horde 😊
---
Yeah, same. I'll drop skinning at level 10-13 for enchanting, just for the wands, then get skinning back up. The wands are amazing, and they'll probably be hard to get for the first couple of days.
---
&gt;about 18% of players from private servers will initially roll warrior
---
Ftfy
---
Just fine, you just need to keep a set of int gear.
---
Just being on this subreddit means that one is more educated about Classic.
---
I think you are underestimating the amount of people that aren't hanging around classic wow forums or the subreddit that will play the game.
---
&gt; For Alliance I'd say: Dwarf/Gnome &gt; Human &gt; Night Elf
---
&gt; 
---
Dun Morgh &gt; Elwyn &gt; Teldrassil for sure, however
---
Darkshore&gt;Loch Modan &gt; Westfall
---
I'm sorry for some reason it added \_d to the link which made it really low resolution. I changed the link to a readable one.
---
Correct.
---
Was 11 at the time and my mate said Warrior was the worst to level, easy choice
---
thanks
---
Also once the baby is 4-5, it can farm gold for you while you're at work.
---
Haven't run her off yet!
---
Yes you can. You simply create a character with the name you wanna reserve. And when 27 august hit. You delete the character and the name will be free to Pick for your friend.
---
Sure, but everyone following a guide will be going to Darkshore in any case.
---
Internet speed won't matter in terms of latency. Having larger badwidth download upload will help however in keeping latency stable if someone is streaming media content (youtube or twitch) or even social media while you play.
---
For example i have a 4 mbits connection (yea i know... my country is behind the world in internet speeds) and my latency on EU servers from Lebanon is around 70-80ms.
---
However since its only a 4 mbits down and 1 mbit up, i get lag spikes if someone at home is using the internet for anything other than browsing.
---
Don't think of internet speed as how fast a packet it sent back and forth from your pc to the server.
---
Immagine the internet as water cylinder, the latency would be how fast the water can travel the tube from start to end x2 (as ping, latency, is the time each packet needs to go back and forth from your pc to the server then back to you pc with the response), while internet speed (bandwidth) would be how large (diameter) of the cylinder is. A wider cylinder (higher bandwidth) equal more data can be sent without bottlenecking or throttling each other.
---
That is why the physical distance between client and server is the primary cause of a low latency, the other factor is the cable quality (the travel medium) whether it is copper cables, infrared or fiber (fiber being the fastest as light does not cause interference in contrast to electric signal in copper cables).
---
I also can't decide what to pick while leveling. Tailoring seems pretty good the the robe at 60 but I really want engineering as well since I'm planning on doing a lot of pvp. So many good choices but engineering seems so good even when leveling but it requires mining...
---
You flex in the square instead.
---
“My firstborn is due” proceeds to give parenting advice lol okay guy
---
I don't know about the cities, I feel like I'm not playing the game for the cities layout. Even though it's the place where we spend the most time. Once you know the layout, it should be fine I guess
---
I'm more concerned about quests and lore but if it gives me new experience, it is less likely that I'll think "Hey, I'm doing the exact same thing that I loved 10 years ago, why I'm not that much excited?"
---
About raids, is it such an issue ? Are there so few PVE oriented guilds ?
---
Maybe op isn’t the right term. They excel in pretty much every scenario 
---
Lvling
---
Farming
---
Raiding
---
Dueling
---
Open world pvp
---
Bgs
---
...
---
While all other classes usually have at least some bad/mediocre areas.
---
If you're a touch typer shift and control are very legitimate "modifiers" so you can get more keys out of the same 9 keys.  You go from 9 options to 27.
---
I tried a Razer Naga for about a week, and now I basically turn the left side of my KB into one for every MMO i play through bindings.
---
Thanks. I'm wondering why the post specifically mentioned the name reservation period though. I'm just spooked of the possibility that if I reserve a name for a friend and it doesn't end up getting immediately released as I delete the character on launch.
---
Only noobs get demounted. :)
---
OP has no clue what they’re in for.
---
That’s why my child has a mother lol.
---
The question was about the most enjoyable questing, not "optimal". Also, most guides will have you do parts of Westfall as well. Also also, guides differ.
---
Yes. There are [1,140 Alliance exclusive quests](https://classic.wowhead.com/quests/side:-1), [923 Horde exclusive quests](https://classic.wowhead.com/quests/side:-2), and [1,995 neutral quests](https://classic.wowhead.com/quests/side:3).
---
Cant learn crafting profesions before lvl 5. Gathering professions have no lvl cap!
---
That's exactly my plan, word for word haha. Engineering is just such a huge buff to your character.
---
You still need forward, strafe left, strafe right to move, so all the other keys can be removed. Keep in mind, you can still backpedal with the arrow keys if you need to taunt someone.
---
Also, what I do to get free bind is move all my UI keybinds (such as C, G ,B,  N)  to numpad because you don't really need to open them on the go 
---
PS : N is for food, I don't need it close to my movement key
---
Thank you, sir. You are a scholar and a gentleman. 
---
As someone with limited play time and without a guild, I would love to not waste time looking for people to complete a group and wait for them to take their sweet time to get to the dungeon entrance.
---
Beta is over dude
---
I went Horde because I played Orc primarily in Warcraft 3 &amp; TFT. I couldn't betray my green bros
---
&gt; Improved Windfury Totem for your melee dps is no joke
---
It kind of is. 
---
You're spending 2 talent points and going deep enhance to give your allies an average of \~19 attack power per auto attack hit (93 attack power bonus, procs roughly every 5 hits).
---
Wifes pregnant aswell. We are getting the baby in sometimes in feb 2020, but ill sure enjoy playing classic untill then the max i can. Even after i hope, even if its more casual. 
---
GZ btw :)

Thank you, sir. You are a scholar and a gentleman.
---
This is true, MMO mice are terrible
---
They are heavy, buttons are too small too use instinctively, a lot of them come with shitty lasers and all those extra buttons are useless for anything other than MMOs
---
Yes, and since Dun Morogh is better than Teldrassil, you should start there and then go to Darkshore...
---
You can swap groups mid combat in vanilla, so raid leaders would constantly shuffle mana tides into one of the two healer groups.  
---
Bullshit numbers 10% ok to raid as that in a "good" guild, 90% ok to raid with that in a slow paced casual guild.  
---
No one can give you an accurate call on that 30/0/21 and raid potential.  I can tell you I was in a 2nd rate naxx progression guild in vanilla.  We did not allow shamans to raid without mana tide on anything that was cutting edge.  Middle of the week, alt run MC/zg/aq20 yea sure spec whatever.  I do not recall this perception that raiding as elemental was ok.  I think maybe this perception is a modern reaction to private server mechanics that devalue mana tide.  A lot of the private servers allowed raids to stack flasks and worldbuffs in such a way that should not be possible on classic, meaning fights will take longer on classic then they did on those private servers.  
---
Ele is very good at dueling, it is particularly oppressive against bad players.  It lacks control or escape so can suffer against control orientated classes like warlock, mage, and rogue.  
---
Ele is ok at farming, it has bad mana efficiency but high burst.  It cannot really aoe or deal with group pulls very well at all.  If you get some mage water beforehand you would be fine to do the off max level quest, that are quire rare in vanilla.
---
MoveAnything

First year is eat sleep poop repeat.

If you practice totem twisting a lot, your melee group is gonna love you.

Aside from that you are gonna be a nightfall bot.

My little Thex will be born in the next 2-3 weeks. That’s how you fuck up classic. Bad timing.

What is nightfall?
---
The computer isn't a fully US thing either, most of it was developed outside the US. Seriously dude, just [google some stuff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer) before making an arse of yourself.
---
**Computer**
---
A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks. A "complete" computer including the hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment required and used for "full" operation can be referred to as a computer system.

Wat? A MMO mouse was a game changer for me, the g600 that i bought in 2014 still holds strong and is AMAZING in WoW, i especially like the weight, i wouldn't want a heavy mouse like that for shooters but it's great for MMOs, if the buttons are too big for you, might i suggest losing some weight to get rid of the sausage fingers
---
That's a big reason I usually go alliance :) that and the architecture is better on average.
---
You really don't need them. Maybe in classic because some classes have a ridiculous amount of buttons (warlock, shaman) but I have 35 different keybinds in retail with just a normal mouse. I never adapted to using my thumb for pressing keybinds.
---
Whats the problem? You have at least 9 Month of time now!
---
That's honestly a worse analogy than you think. You're comparing the best players to everyone. I'd agree that the group of raiders at the very top have progressed and are better than they were in the past and compare it to sports like that, but this isn't really the case for the average raider, wow player, or gamer. 
---
If you're talking about PuGing dungeons, referring the skillcap of the best players improving doesn't really make sense. You basically never end up pugging dungeons with those people, and their skill doesn't really bleed into the lower levels quickly.
---
still have 9 mouths to play xD
---
i used to play with dial up so literally anything better than that should be fine
---
i had to look at the ground while in org to move without lagging
---
You too man, and I'll pray that we both will be able to get at least 2 hours in Azeroth a week, even if that's quite optimistic.
---
Gotta love coming to classic reddit to be told how to parent by someone without children....
---
Plenty of good mice/keyboards for $15-$30 . Since you mentioned Razer, let me tell you that I had firmware issues with a Blackwidow before, as half of the keys weren't working until I finally upgraded to some obscure version that worked fine. I've been using a $30 Lenovo rubber dome keyboard ever since and I'm never going back. For mice on the other hand, you want something that is physically sturdy. Read reviews and avoid any mouse that has reports of double clicking or mouse wheel functionality issues. Again, no need to buy something too expensive unless you play FPS games.
---
Thanks. I will go for this route. I will play 2 hours a day so will have rested xp bonus
---
yano what else is an awesome racial? Not being ugly AF...
---
Poor dwarves
---
the G600 is more sturdy and will most likely last longer, i've had 2 razer mice before the g600 in the span of 2 years, currently i use the g600 since 2014
---
You'll most likely be able to log in, choose realm and create a character. So yes, you can reserve for others. Just make a character with that name and delete it later.
---
If you have any old characters just log on them once since they are inactive. Then you should be able to post.
---
The bottom tier classes are still fine as long as you understand their limitations. As a resto druid you won't out heal other healers in raids and you won't provide better team support in bgs. BUT you will be a fantastic solo/world pvp/1v1 class with top tier survivability and mobility.
---
I can say with absolute certainty that nobody cares what you pick.
---
2 hours a week? Do you have to raise your child alone?
---
I'm talking from objective pov it's terrible mouse, it's nice that you enjoy a shitty mouse, some ppl enjoy eating shit , doesn't mean it's good
---
Chose it based on the trailer. Druid cat form looked so bad ass, so I went dr00d
---
considering going holy paladin but heard a lot about the specc being boring. why do people say that? is it due to their rotation? can someone shed a light of their healing rotation in pvp?
---
how is the specc in bgs? are they a strong healer?
---
also curious how good theyre at helping teammates - are they a good support?
---
I will be alliance ;)
---
Masque will let you skin Bartender to whatever you like, but I don't think you even need it to enable the original art.
---
The cities are so amazing!! Mulgore and kater silvermoon are pretty. But Ironforge alone makes the alliance have the most interesting city.
---
because they watch pvp videos where warriors have full epic pvp gear+ pocket healer and expect that to be the norm.
---
I mean it has to be. Imagine spending years and years playing WoW and you log back in and are just as bad as you used to be when you first played. I started with 14 and gosh was I a bad player. No comparison to today at all. I’m not godlike or anything but I can confidently say that I like the level of skill I’ve received. 
---
It’s just with any other thing. You spend time you get better. People spend so much time on WoW. It would be a surprise to see these people going to vanilla and suddenly failing all of the sudden. You won’t unlearn your skill. It’s like driving a Bycicle.
---
How does that exist? Due to transmog 99% of the equipment people wear isn't even the item they are using but some item, they think looks cool they got at some point in the past.
---
I just wish Thex is still acmvailable in 27th
---
This thread determines that the time spent skinning between 1-40, would be better spent just grinding for gold at 40 for the mount.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a1vrt6/on_skinning_for_gold_while_leveling/
---
The only limitation is if there is nothing to kill due to congestion, which is a much larger problem in itself.
---
Why 20 months specifically?
---
So roll a hunter and get server first 60 before the dungeon grinders, wow what a challenge
---
what the fuck am i reading
---
thanks for the response.
---
It‘s fairly shit in PvP to be honest, but tons of fun, so it doesn‘t feel bad.
---
I can feel the affects of this image.
---
&gt; What kind of an idiot uses mixer lol  
---
and 
---
&gt; Twitch TOS are wrong and the company is profiting off it's monopoly  
---
Are usually said by the same person
---
Usually, raids bring one. If you have a raid with friends you can probably bring two. Playing in a none hardcore guild also opens up for some meme specs.
---
You could just get gear for both, will take a while longer but it's doable. Get Benediction from MC and then farm honor to rank 10 and get the blue PvP set. Combined with some caster items from MC/BWL that no warlock/mage really needs or already has and you are set to go.
---
Then you can respec between raiding and PvPing. But doing premade in PvP while running disc/holy is also really enjoyable. Just make sure you have a team that can peel for you :)
---
Strat and Scholo had some major bug problems on the pserver i played on. Scholo was pretty much a no-go due to various annoying shit. Strat had 1 major hurdle: that gate-trap with the grubs/insects. They spawned in before visible and were hard to attack, and sometimes double or triple spawned, and the respawn was extremely short and the trigger area was huge...and fucking no room on the otherside between the patrols and the bug spawn... it was just a wipe fest in that little nook. And for fucks sake if the healer died and had to run back....eye naxx every god damn time...spawns in gargoyles to wreck you lol because people forget about the eye! &gt;.&lt;   so frustrating
---
Interesting didn't know that. I was looking through the TukUI files for retail and classic last night and noticed that the focus frame .lua files were missing in the classic version. This must be why. I used the focus frame a lot as a mage in TBC for sheep targets.
---
Nah, K had the correct values and Nost/LH had too much.
---
Only because you're unable to use something properly doesn't mean that it's shit
---
&gt; And then the inflation. Omg, the inflation! Some of my retro food was worth 1500g o.O
---
It's unbeleivqable really. A wow token costs 180k gold on EU. When I quit, I was considered quite rich at 35k gold. Now 35k is chump change.
---
&gt; Damage inflation/stat inflation is a pet peeve of mine too. Why didn't they get rid of a couple of zero's here and there.
---
They actually did that with Bfa. you'll notice your old gear having laughable stats. Eg Sulfuras is a 10dps weapon or soemthing like that. In Legion people were doing several million dmg per hit
---
Go mage
---
Level to 60, have a look around. If it's not good, hop ship to the next and level again to 60.
---
Pretty much a wasted half sub if you don't want a super common name.
---
A good idea for melee is to macro unequivocal and equip mainhand for melee so when you get MC you don’t cause as much damage
---
Nope.
---
Depends what you're into, friend.
---
Straight up dps to your fancy? Mage is #1 and is immensely enjoyable for PVP.
---
Fun? I've played Priest on off since vanilla and I've found it to be one of the funniest classes overall. The fun doesn't truly start until endgame, though. So until then enjoy wanding a boring but consistent grind to high levels. The plus side is you can heal or dps dungeons while you level - variety is nice.
---
It's been reposted to his sub a thousand times.
---
Pve content will be quiet more easy to beat since we already know everything, PC performances are better and so on. And because of that there wont be the need to min/max everything to the teeth in order to beat pve content giving more room for nosooptimal raidcompositions.
---
so dont worry! Play what you think is fun. I dont care and hopefully noone else does! :)
---
I mean it isn't really a meme spec, I think the only 1 raid spot thing just applies to the most hardcore guilds.  Most casuals and midgrade guilds would rather take an extra shadow priest along than a dps shaman or a boomkin.  Main problem you'd probably run into is getting pressure to heal instead.
---
Boy are you wrong
---
Most speedrunners won’t do dungeons anyway. It’s just the meta not really a challenge tho.
---
Even if u somehow manage to use all 12 buttons properly, it's still too heavy which is terrible for your wrist long term and it's laser is inaccurate which sucks for any day use of PC
---
Go research any mouse reviews on any site if you don't believe me
---
The schimitar is pretty much the exact same now just a more recent , probably the most recent addition to the MMO mice list. 
---
I'd just recommend any mouse other than Razer. I don't think an MMO mouse is necessary but whatever helps :)
---
In Vanilla, Mages started competing with Rogues in the AQ patch, Warriors were still mediocre. And no, I'm not just talking about the Mage that gets all the Ignite credit, you split that between all the fire-specced Mages.
---
Dwarf rogue coming through!
---
Idk of it works on classic. But I did the EXACT same thing with the addon called Buttonforge. Just remove the 2 bars on the right with the interface options and ADD the bars you want with the addon!
---
Play warcraft 3. It explains why the trolls and tauren joined the horde
---
You'll be fine bro! Once he's a bit older take him on your lap and show him Azeroth. I taught my daughter to jump from the highest point in Orgri with my druid and then shapeshift to flight form right before plummeting to a certain death. She finds that hilarious. My wife has a different vision but that's why you are daddy and you will be assiociated with the fun stuff ;-)
---
Hang all the server names on your wall, put on a blindfold then throw a dart.
---
Agreeing with the other dude here, opinion is opinion. Just because you think car A is shit, doesn't mean others HAVE to think car A is shit. 
---
You're just being narcissistic with your opinions
---
its also very simple :)
---
Yeah I played Priest back on vanilla and I want to play something different while still being a healer, because thats "ma thing" on MMORPGS.
---
I feel that Druid fits me like a glove for so many reasons:
---
1. I like its theme, nature aesthetics, with shapeshifts and restorative green abilities.
---
2. I am way more busier now that than I was on Vanilla and I feel that Druid is a very self suficient class and good to play if you have limited time sometimes: good leveler, can play all roles till some capacity, can even farm decently enough with a Resto Specc...since I will probably wont have much time for alts, Druid can even offer me some different options of gameplay.
---
3. Also, I hope I am not thinking to much of myself, but I consider my self a very good healer due to pretty much being one on every single MMO that I played so even tho I know I will be "out healed" due to class limitations, I know I can make it work "enough" for being competetive and acepted on a good guild, basically standing out enough and not only being brought to groups because I have a CR and an Innervate.

Nah the average is also getting betting. The average is better than it used to be back then. And now you can move to a even better position of that already better average.

You’re implying the average is just as good as the average back then which is plain wrong.

This was my experience on a private server. I was alliance, and I would get ganked by horde constantly, fellow alliance would ignore my calls for help

Im even more undecided man, hahahahaha. The thing I like about mages (regardless playstyle) is that they are gold machines, but I dont want to be kicked of a raid bc there are like 10 mages already, so idk. Is that important farming as a mage? Or its just a small advantage? Thanks for your reply mate!

I actually like how little i still know about the classes. I played hunter in vanilla and i am rolling warlock now. The class i know the least.😍
---
They don't need to have every realm available for name reservation nor do they need to have every realm that is available for name reservation available at the start of name reservation. As customers reserve names, they'll get numbers and can act accordingly. You can always add more realms but removing a realm is impossible (or at least very damaging).
---
I really hate how you don’t gain any power from level 100 to 120, we haven’t gotten a new talent row in 5 years, I also hate the warfront existing in its current state, giving heroic raid level gear for doing afk content, same with emissary quests in the world, same with titanforging, same with all of this shit. Ironically, me starting to mythic raid again on retail has dulled my classic hype whereas a few months ago right after I quit I was full on hype for classic but just some of the things have just made me so mad. Being FORCED to do monotonous boring AFK world quests as my only reliable source of artifact power doesn’t feel good to get compared to afkgrinding mobs for Timbermaw rep or something, essences and artifact power make alts so annoying to play that I just wont even touch them this tier, compared to classic where I might have 2 or even 3 alts that I will eventually level to 60. only reason I still play is Mythic+ still being really fun and progressing through the eternal palace with my guild.
---
AQ gates, was great. I also got rich on all that oozing thorium and archanite transmutes!
---
Was used to permanent skill choices from Diablo II, so I just deleted my level ~20 rogue to respec him. 
---
RIP
---
It was confirmed that deleting a character that’s been name reserved immediately makes it available for others right away.

When you're low level 30c per stack is a lot, when you're sending a lot of stacks all the time.
---
A 10% physical taken increase for 30 minutes.
---
Did you watch the video?  If all you saw was mashing moonfire, do you even know anything about pvp?
---
Yea i played K the 3rd of his name :p even there my guild would say that with 5 sunder stacks most raid mobs had 0 armor. You think its incorrect?
---
The last guardian is great, I also enjoyed rise of the horde which sort of leads up to the wow movie beginning
---
Fem night elf hunter is the og basic bitch race/class combo of choice.
---
Cool kids pick dwarves.
---
Depends on how you'll play your leveling phase.
---
If you rush to 60, don't bother with enchanting before being 60.
---
If you'll take the time as you level you might want to take enchant as it adds cool things to do, you can do some little enchants to your dungeon party member, etc...
---
Yeah but when you are wiping becasue you all suck and nobody is exactly sure what you are supposed to do (and you have plenty of time) it can be an amazing journey trying to figure out what to do together and getting better together. Only works if the other people are fun and relaxed though.
---
remindMe! 20 days
---
But you can also boost your raid mates dps as resto which is much better...
---
This is my favorite dungeon ever, it's a big reason I'm so excited for Classic.
---
The SOs annoy the shit out of me. They are a huge source for drama and the root cause of more important raiders either not showing up or leaving early because they cant say no to the SO.   As raid leader, your criticize some low effort guildy over a wipe or having zero consumes or something like that... UH OH that was so&amp;sos do no wrong darling! How dare you! Now your off tank quits the raid and takes his cruddy healbot and 2 other friends with him... so you gotta replace them while everyone else sits around
---
THAT'S GOIN' IN THE BOOK! shit wrong universe
---
I never said they had to have every realm already just that they are starting with more than one for the most part:
---
"If there are high numbers of players congregating on individual realms during the name reservation/character creation process, we will post warnings about the potential for long queues on those realms, giving you time to choose alternate realms."
---
Alternate realms. They are clearly stating that in most cases there will be more than one choice. Now you might not to get to pick between multiple German RP realms but for the example given by the OP it holds true that you are going to have some choice to make.
---
It's a decent comment and it might be right, but a lot of these are also just his own assumptions for is the worst thing that could happen. I think the streamer hate/attempt to avoid stems from people just being jealous of either their lifestyle or the fact that they got access to the beta.
---
\&gt;&gt; Overall and general not chill, toxic environment fostered by the streamer's personality. 
---
This is also just wrong. Few streamers get their renown and popularity from being toxic, and most of them get banned anyway (like the recent banning of methodjosh) or are forced to "straighten up" like Asmongold.
---
I've forgotten what this feels like tbh. I do not miss it.
---
Good, then you can skip them and find a guild that you don't have to bullshit your way into.
---
They’re doing a test tomorrow at 2pm est
---
&gt; and more
---
You convinced yourself. Look at how much fun comes out of just one racial ability. A 3 minute cool down used for specific PvP encounters ain't got shit on the plethora of fun and convenience that you would otherwise have. 
---
Tor ilisar'thera'nal!
---
More like Spinebroken. I played 4 expansions from vanilla to cata on that server and it constantly would be down for maintenance XD
---
play what you want. everything you've read on this sub about guilds doing this or that are only for the extreme elitist groups.
---
It's all very minor comparing to negative sides (destruction of the economy, whole guilds pandering to them and side effects of that).
---
Ragnaros had 3,731 armor on K3 which we were able to confirm is correct because of the GM spawns at the end of stress tests / beta. Sunder Armor reduces the target's armor by 450 per stack, up to 5 stacks. That still leaves Ragnaros with 1,481 armor.
---
Is it bad that I too secretly wish I lost my job , hence able to play classic hardcore?
---
&gt; later pve gear bad scaling
---
Don't ever worry about this. Only min-maxing content-rushing guilds will worry about it. If you're playing casually like you said, it's a non-issue entirely.
---
I would avoid warlock and mage if I were you. If you find the PVE rotation boring, then the whole raid experience is gonna be boring for you. It *sounds* like you want to play a hunter but are just worried about 2 things:
---
+ pvp skillcap
---
+ naxx dps scaling
---
The PVP skillcap is something you can overcome with practice. 
---
Nobody thinks that *all* hunters are huntards - just the ones that act like it. Don't be a dick, make some friends to PVP and PVE with, and you'll be fine. 
---
Naxx progression isn't something you should be worrying about imo. If you intend to play 'casually', then you may not be part of the .1% that ever has to worry about raiding in Naxx.
---
see you on the 26th!
---
People did that during Vanilla when streaming wasn't a thing.
---
Org best city
---
Dorf gun specialty means fuck all in the long run if you intend to raid.
---
For what it is worth, I still have an ancient wired Naga that works just fine.  The razer software doesn't even allow me to register it, the serial is too old, it thinks I made a typo.
---
This is why i went with the semi HC/HC guild. Instead of casual wiping and 4h long raids, you get one evening of 3h to clear all the content, and only two nights once Naxx is out. Raids start at exact time and last with predetermined breaks so they wont drag out waiting for that last guy to come back from smoke..
---
Did you just give this man advice based on retail? Why?
---
you don't have a rotation in pvp. You do what's needed.
---
As to broing, in pve, sure, oyu msotly spam fol and occasionally cleanse or put up a judgment.
---
In Pvp you have many tools to hlep out your teammates. blessing to buff them, short term blessings to hlep them out of sticky situations, bubble to heal even when pressured. HoJ to stun a target. Using your seals and judgments, when you aren't healing. Much to do.
---
Alternatively you could just take a long holiday :P
---
Good reference.  Bonus points for putting my class as the trash can.  I like being unkillable.
---
The one where I ding 60 I hate leveling lol
---
Steelseries G2 V2 keyboard here since 2015. Friggin love it. Qualitywise it feels like a keytronic. For you who dont know them they dont break. Ever. I also use a fps mouse steelseries rival 310. I feel steelseries sns logitech makes good stuff. I have bad experience with razer. Just low quality overall.
---
Good to see it back up on it's feet in classic
---
Mage has more options in pvp and better scaling late game. Hunters get to kite stuff.
---
&gt;picking and choosing
---
Trying to PUG this place with randoms hearthing out after every couple of bosses once they've finished their quest. Oof.
---
No, you get thrown into the char screen instantly.
---
Heculars Rod! It took me at least 500+ yetis to get it to drop on my first character. I hope to improve on that
---
Where are you imagining these raid groups from? lol. E'ko will be farmed for maybe an hour here and there but that is largely irrelevant to the rep grind. More people will form small groups and grind the repeatable quest while getting the power e'ko from the furlbolgs.
---
Well then I don't think many people will go through the extra work to take a pic at the login screen .
---
Maybe character select screen could work.
---
Bartender keeps the art bar. Let's you resize it and move it around even.
---
You will have fun. dps is not all of yor job in a raid. i felt me always special as hunter. PVP if you can handle your hunter is strong.
---
You can play enha if you want, Im all for it and good luck to you. You just wont ever find yourself in a party with me.
---
Well, the blue post is more or less just reiterating how the existing system works. There are ways around the 'systems' if you know enough (I have 3 DK's on a single server, for example).
---
You seem to not understand the point 
---
The point is that it's a terrible product, it's bad at what it's designed to do in relation to other products of it's kind 
---
There is nothing about opinion here, 
---
You understand?
---
Hey y’all. I’m torn between enhancement shaman, which is what I played in vanilla. (Never raises) or ret paladin (never played always dreamed) my question is how is ret in PvE and PvP situations?
---
Who can say no to those creepy smiles?!
---
I've been in numerous guilds that have lost multiple good people due to one person being, not even an asshole but a strong abrasive personality, talking in comms, acting like they are an officer when they aren't etc etc. Just being generally dislikeable.
---
In every case, it is better to kick the one person, before your guild makes the decision for you and starts quitting, even if you happen to like that person.
---
You will have as much chance of picking a good/bad/mediocre server as the rest of us.
---
Going in solo (I am too) means going in blind.  I think the only way to up your chances, is when the server names/types goes live, keep an eye out to see where some of the big name PvP guilds are going and if a bunch of them are all headed to a specific server then head there too.
---
Keyboard is more important than mouse. You don’t need a mouse with 12 buttons.
---
"Have fun. 
---
See you in MoP when xrealm comes."
---
I want to play ele shaman in bgs on a PVE server - that's my end goal.  I also want to raid once or twice a week, and while I prefer dps roles I know I'll probably have to heal instead.  Given that bgs aren't coming for several months and I can do 15hr no-life days until November, am I better off just rolling a warlock first (the only alt I intend to have) so that I can dps through the first two phases?  I don't know how feasible it is to have two decently raid geared toons by the time Phase 3 releases.  I haven't raided since wotlk and haven't played vanilla since vanilla so I'm not exactly going to be doing speed runs to 60.  
---
I'm just worried that I'll be bored to tears being 30/21 on a PVE realm until bgs come out.
---
Nah, the default software binds the numpad to the thumb buttons, which works just fine for MMOs.    
---
Full disclosure though, it probably only lasted this long because when I am not on an MMO binge it goes back in the box, and I use a steelseries for shooters/etc.    
---
The sensor is pretty bad compared to modern mice.  Doesn't matter for an MMO though.    
---
cheers
---
There's a function in AtlasLoot for saving items to a list, but I don't know if it gives you some kind of notification when you receive an item on said list.
---
There is. Swap en for de or fr
---
Closer to early raids? Horde has the best hearthstone location for blackrock mountain lol ally scum
---
Yeah I dealt with enough of the lawful good paladin save the princess guys playing DnD in high school and as an adult in my 20s.  That's their thing, and I've got my own preferences for darker fantasy, so I normally play horde.  Only thing that can change my mind is playing a gnome warlock.
---
To kill all of the other faction’s players. I don’t care for npc. Though I want to kill the fp if too many’s 60s come in
---
Flask runs.
---
Lots and lots of flask runs. 
---
Source: was alchemist.
---
I'm curious why you don't think she's Forsaken. She very clearly is.
---
Define your understanding of "Forsaken".
---
I’ve never seen a pro wow player use a naga or g600.
---
Any idea where to find a list of “big name” guilds to follow?
---
Missed the point of my comment. I'm just saying if you're a new player and this is your first trip into classic Azeroth then just enjoy the ride first and min max later.
---
Elv/tukui weakauras questie is prob The lost important for me
---
You can indeed get some piece that are sub lvl 60 in MC (and ZG too)
---
Ok so I’m going Druid for my class but I don’t know what faction to roll on. I need help fam. I’ve maxed toons on Alliance during Wrath and  Horde for Legion so I’ve played both sides and like the look of NE and Tauren. 
---
Questions I have:
---
1. Which faction has the better quest-lines and zones, in your opinion? 
---
2. Which faction can navigate the world more easily? 
---
3. I plan to both raid and PvP and will be rolling a PvP realm (or RP-PvP if possible, please and thank you Blizzard). 
---
4. Anything else that is worth mentioning? 
---
Thank you all so much. See you in Azeroth!
---
Why did you capitalize uncle? 
---
Is anyone in America named Uncle?
---
You get almost no xp in a 40man raid
---
Missed the whole point of my comment. Just saying, enjoy Classic the way we all enjoyed it first when it was Vanilla.
---
No one was leveling in Vanilla for the first time min maxing. They were exploring and enjoying the ride.
---
You only need the sub to play classic, but you can buy the battle chest code online for $10-$13, since it comes with a month of game time on a new account. Slightly cheaper than a regular sub.
---
I was a warrior in EQ and was always jealous of necromancers and their ability to solo things efficiently and handle multiple mobs at a time. EQ warriors literally could not solo except for vastly underleveled targets (and I had good raid gear). So when I saw the wow class list, Warlock looked the most similar to the necro with their pet and dots and fear so I rolled one and loved it.
---
Along with what that comment states, I'd also be worried about the streamer losing interest in the game and ending up with a dead server once the viewers move on to the next big thing.
---
That’s a grudgin’
---
Painful memories of waiting forever to get a group together for 1 of the sides specifically (purple I think). Totally worth it though. I still have the sceptre in my retail bank, even though it doesn't work anymore.
---
Oh you are a beast when it comes to farming, alongside hunters and rogues. I wouldn't sweat worrying about being kicked from a raid - there are a lot of guilds that require a lot of mages to run a lot of raids, you'll find a spot without any hassle unless you forget to upgrade your spells past rank 1 haha.
---
You won't be farming elite until the endgame, and by then what you want to think about is what you'll be spending that money on and how much you're going to commit to farming gold - are you going to make a point of farming or just going to do it casually? You could casually farm gold with any class (albeit not as efficiently) and make an alt mage. At the end of the day if your main pull for mage is the gold farming, you want to make sure that you enjoy devoting the time to it and then have a plan for the gold, otherwise why not just level a class you might have more fun with that takes a little bit longer to get that 60 mount? Food for thought
---
Yeah, if im correct the one for the felhunter also takes you to Kalimdor (Ashenvale). These are great one - but there are a lot more - the level 50 Scythe (you get to run ST for it if i remember correctly, while the quest starts in Aszhara)
---
And hate yourself for the amount of time you wasted
---
What are you talking about? Only 3 is WHY you can’t just keep reserving names
---
A lot of people here fail to realize that a mech keyboard allows multiple button presses without it ignoring any. 
---
For example, a good test of your keyboard is to hold down both shift keys and type “the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog”.
---
If you are missing any letters, your keyboard isn’t good enough for modern gaming by 2019 standards
---
Victimless crime!
---
I just meant, if this is your first time playing Classic then don't stress about min maxing and just play it like we all did our first times on Vanilla. THEN min max later on. 
---
But yes, to each their own.
---
On retail I play on Ru servers and it doesn't allow me use English text, but the audio isn't a problem.
---
Lol at the Paladin joke
---
the point is the skill cap is higher.. you backpedal while you cone of cold so they don't melee you with leeway then instantly nova.
---
You took 2 weeks off work and you only plan to be 40?  Bruh
---
Yikes
---
Nah I just expect my girlfriend want to spend time and then there's work and friends as well.
---
I don't know why you are going on all these tangents now.
---
You originally said that if there was competition then you could just group up to do the quests, but that is just no true since people will farm them in raids and not groups.
---
Human gives about a 5% dps boost. It’s not much but it is noticeable.
---
The calculator works nicely, but you really should consider not breaking the back button functionality. Currently nothing happens  when you press the back button after selecting a pet. I would expect that this action to take me back to the home screen.
---
Duskwood. Favourite zone by far
---
I've played retail at a pretty high level but I'm completely new to classic. I prefer melee classes and being able to do roles other than dps. I don't need to be a raid tank but being able to tank 5 mans could be fun. I'll be rolling on a PvP server but I'm more interested in raiding than wPvP.
---
I've *mostly* narrowed it down to paladin, shaman, or hunter. Pally seems like the most convenient with limited downranking, respeccing, and free mount, but I've heard it can be boring to play. Shaman was my first character, and I love Ele and Enh, but I'm meh on resto, and utilizing all the totems and downranked spells seems like chore. Hunter looks pretty good for a new player albeit with outplay potential but there's the issues of stigma and only being able to DPS. What say you?
---
I've been seeing 11pdt?
---
At the moment I am feeling that shaman swinging heally boy. 
---
Before Shaman i wanted to play; rogue, warrior, paladin, warrior, shaman, druid, mage, warrior, mage and then priest. 
---
Shaman seems the most appealing in terms of pvp and raiding. 
---
I like a cruisy raid experience with a gimmicky rng fun pvp.
---
Hunter or Shaman? Plan is to be somewhat casual on the PvE side of things and primarily spend my life out in the world or doing battlegrounds. 
---
I'm worried about the shaman, I feel like I would actually enjoy it more in PvE as a healer and playing it in PvP too but the thing that worries me are the respec costs and the ability to go out and farm gold is just poor/average. 
---
Even if I feel like I would enjoy the hunter less, it's a damn lot easier to PvP in the PvE spec and I get to farm anything and anywhere really efficiently. Plus kiting is really fun.
---
Sell me on one please, I'm horribly indecisive.
---
I will also play paladin, but instead of proving everyone saying paladin is shit wrong I will.... Not do that.
---
Chose whatever friends/old mates want to play.
---
Thats the most important part IMO.
---
1. Alliance has more beautiful zones and questlines, more nature focussed etc, what fits well to the druid.
---
2. For Raiding in MC/BWL it is Alliance, for AQ40/Naxx Horde has easier travel routes. All in all it is not problematic and your navigation will always be managable quite well, no matter of the faction you chose.
---
3. For what i have heard you will find more RP players on the Alliance side, more raiding guilds on pvp servers as Horde.
---
4. Even if i am going to play Horde, i need to be honest and tell you that the nightelf druids look much much better (by far!!) than a tauren! Especially in Tier-sets.
---
Hope i helped you some bit. :)
---
That’s good to know, and any idea on horde races?
---
If I can search in it, then yes.
---
There'll be a couple dozen guards on you, when you start trouble in Gadgetzan or attack a flightmaster
---
You guys live in the States but she doesn’t feel comfortable reading English? This could be a good opportunity for her to practice reading more English.
---
Cut off friends when they are not going to join your azeroth adventure. Good friends will still be there when you’re done with the game. /s
---
Your bank alt can't DE your quest rewards and obsolete equipment though.
---
Yeah I’m gonna play a shaman too. Gonna roll a troll and call him Thex I think.
---
if the differences are smaller than that  for Horde then I’m pretty comfortable choosing based on aesthetics, thanks
---
Clever use of game mechanics haha
---
100% will be used in world first clear.  
---
You can skip a TON of the trash in AQ40 as well
---
but there's ten different puzzle activities now where I need to hit a button over there and not stand in a green circle over here!! so mechanic, much complex
---
Debuff put on you by these golems in Westfall. Fuck it, you just hit 10-15 level, has no really good stats, and this bitch just lower you hp for 30 minutes?
---
Windfury can't affect druids, so if they go mage I'd strongly advise priest.
---
It’s August, 2019.
---
Classic is close.
---
Are you still struggling with the huge decision of what class to play in Classic? Flipping coins around the house deciding between options??
---

Cheers,

---
Yeah... atleast I know 100% for paladins there wasn't a quest at 40 it costs like 90s from the paladin trainer and does not actually require riding to be known if memory serves. But yes at 60 the paladin mount quest was extremely tedious.
---
Orc is the best but not by much. I wouldn’t say it’s noticeable on the dps charts like with humans.
---
my pvp team used to 10v10 in wsg vs nihilum, 20 ppl flasked up we would play 3hr warsongs :D
---
Not quietly though, they did put a blue post about it which made the front page here! Good move for them
---
Rolling rogue on alliance, but I’m curious how much each racial actually affects the gameplay experience. For example, how impactful is extra stealth as a night elf? Will it actually be a palpable change? Or humans weapon specialization, will I always be churning out more dps than other races/does perception actually come in handy out in the real world? And for dwarves, does stoneform simply make me win a lot more duels against other rogues, or does the benefit become negligible?
---
I’m really at a crossroads picking my race and I’m not sure if I should seriously consider racials or if they are simply a quality of life tweak that amounts to being a negligible difference
---
Pick random class, level till bored, delete, repeat.
---
Do this for 1,5 year.
---
Also watching like every single pvp video ever uploaded from vanilla till wotlk gave me a general idea about the gameplay of the classes.
---
I decided on Mage.
---
You know some of the newer dungeons arent all bad, but honestly the revamps are just ass
---
I'd say druid, they tank 5man easily, and have a couple different types of roles they can fulfill in raid groups.
---
Why do people say "streamers" when they clearly just mean Asmongold? Nobody else attracts anywhere close to his viewership nor do they attract such a large in game following. Sodapoppin is close in popularity, but even he didnt have 100 players following him around as much as they could. And I would be fine with Asmongold being on the alliance side of my server. Makes things interesting, and it really only ruins the alliance side economy, not mine.
---
&gt; -I like the azerite powers/gear, i think that is a cool concept and fun to tinker with.
---
​This is actually what killed it for me. They did the same in the previous expansion with the artefact weapons. If you stop playing/grinding azerite power, you can't use, or benefit entirely from the gear that drops in higher level dungeons / raids (some perks/abilities on that gear require a certain level of azerite power).
---
Yeah... when that 5th Perdition's Blade drops and you still haven't won (or maybe even seen) a Vis'kag, Brutality Blade, CTS, or Maladath because all the Warriors want them too, you'll think twice about refusing to change specs.
---
To be fair, it matters more how much the products are used once the leveling rush is done.
---
There's no worse feeling than when you spend a bunch of time &amp; money to craft items and put it up on AH only to be undercut in 5 minutes and have your auctions sit there for 2 days and come back unsold..
---
Ah i feel you. Sidenote, have you ever tried the Enchroma glasses for people who are color blind?
---
I have stocked up a shit ton of water bottles energy drinks pot noodle's,Korean spicy noodles and also coffee  so yes my toilet will be getting punished but i will enjoy every moment of wow vanilla.
---
Oh nice thex is a good name i may also call mine thex
---
&gt; I like the fantasy of being a ranger who befriends the beasts of the wilderness.
---
And the thing that I personally don't like about hunters is pet use. 
---
I would prefer archer with ability to temporarily summon beast (in the same way as shamans/mages summon elementals).
---
My choice mainly comes down to leveling speed. If this was 15 years ago and I was a kid, I'd play whatever I wanted. But reality sets in and after my real life responsibilities, I probably have less than 10 hours a week to play. Given that, how much faster is a Hunter than a Mage? I know Hunters are the fastest, and I do like their concept, but the QoL Mages have will swing me that way if the leveling speed isn't that drastically different. Also, I plan to play on a pvp server, so defending myself and being good at wpvp at all levels is a must.
---
Grinding will be the worst form of levelling during the first month. Grinding is good but we are in a special situation where the game is new everyone will start at level 1 so its not really the same world. The spots you would normally grind will have a lot of people ruining your pulls or opposite faction easily finishing you when you are eating between pulls. In a world where the majority is already at 60 sure but you gonna find your grinding spots filled with people at least during first month
---
phase 2
---
Plenty of guilds will be happy to just enjoy the game without the whole min max mentality I’m sure
---
You can gank with combat. Just choose your target wisely. Or don’t. That’s cool too. You jut have the option if you choose.
---
There is no difference in baseline dps between horde side races unless you are an orc and use axes. Agi axes definitely do exist and you absolutely can make the most of axe skill,  but while leveling you’ll rarely use an axe simply because the majority of blue rogue weapons are swords and daggers (rewards and 5 man boss drops).
---
To answer your question, axe and sword racial skills can result in a 5 to 8% dps increase, I believe. I’m sure someone will post back with the data from beta,
---
As a healer: Luna unit frames, bagnon, weak auras, DBM, and a damage/threat meter. Everything else will be just fluff and quality of life stuff
---
I don't use an mmo mouse. I have a steelseries sensei and have always had a mouse with about the same amount of buttons. It comes down to preference.
---
I've always used mechanical keyboards+ a non mmo mouse because of other games I play. I did just fine. Instead of having 20 buttons on my mouse, I just used shift+key binds if needed.
---
Play with what you are comfortable with. A specific mouse/keyboard won't make you a better player.
---
But then there's also the rough stones etc. It adds up real fast.
---
Tbh its more a meme that paladin is bad than it being the actual truth so alot of people who don't understand the meme or believe it too much will be surprised so that will be the most interesting. But then again im going holy from 10-60 and I plan on taking my sweet ass time about it so who knows.
---
I just discovered your podcasts last week and I’ve been binging them on all of my commutes since. Great stuff mate, keep up the good work!
---
When you use it on a player it says invalid target.
---
Sweet, nice, nope just gonna replay Vanilla....
---
Troll female
---
It is hard to argue against orc being the dominant choice for PvP as the stun resist racial is insanely good for all 3 specs.
---
PvE wise it is Troll or Orc and I don't think it really matters which.
---
They wanted it to be BFA expansion req with sub but the community massively disagreed so they got rid of that idea almost immediately after mentioning it.
---
PVP: Orc &gt; Tauren &gt; Troll

Apparently its not vanilla like in Classic.
---
Is there any list of all these race class combo specific spells, like devouring plague? Tried searching for one but found nothing.
---
He gay
---
Im pretty sure there will be 5 servers to choose from. In the blue post it says you'll be able to have 10 characters per server with a Max of 50 total.
---
Missed a "good luck" opportunity
---
Shamans cant dual wield in classic. You get 2h maces and axes with talent.
---
No one said that examples of misuse are irrelevant. I’m saying that examples of misuse aren’t nearly enough to make broad generalizations about the system as a whole.
---
In my experience, I haven’t seen a single misuse of right click reporting, but I have seen proper usage of it plenty of times.
---
But neither of us should attempt to generalize, and instead we should understand that our experiences are tiny pieces that probably aren’t perfect reflections of the whole.
---
Not when it comes to keybinds.   
---
In PvP where you will want to bind your engineering head, boots, grenade and if applicable belt, chest, offhand. On top of that you have a dozen or so useful PvP potions that you can bind and we haven't even started with a class's default abilities yet that can rack up to 40+ and now you'll have potential down-ranking and pet abilities to deal with. It's rather common to have over 50 binds if you take PvP semi-seriously.  
---
Downvote all you want but I stand by what I said, giving advice to new classic players based on retail is a bad idea.
---
I enjoy a MMO mouse for wow. I think it makes me a better player.
---
Is that an objective fact? No, it’s an opinion, because I think it helps me, which honestly it does for a class like mage. Some people like you think otherwise. Get over yourself.
---
Are you okay?
---
I grew up with the warcraft strategy games and books, but only played Wow 10 day trials every now and then. When I finally got my own account I made a human warrior first, since Anduin Lothar was my favorite character.
---
I've since converted to the Horde.
---
Even if you could, dw is always inferior to 2h in PvP. 2h = burst = PvP, dw = stable dmg = PvE.
---
Druids don't have the teleport in vanilla BTW. 
---
As for saying it has a limited form of character progression, I'd say the opposite. You can literally have 5 gear sets to do 5 different roles (tank, heal, decurse, melee dps, range dps)
---
Ancestors watch over you. Thanks for answer, didnt expect someone to say tauren but your comment made such a big smile on my face :)
---
&gt;· I have more buds playing Horde from playing Horde in the past.
---
For my 2cents worth...this=)
---
There are two entrances to Gadgetzan (+a secret one) and it’s also a very small perimeter.
---
It used to be a quest.
---
I just said that because I don’t wanna switch to pvp spec all the time, but if it’s a better gearing choice I’m totally down to eventually switch to daggers. Essentially I’d get daggers faster than swords?
---
Ya the Chinese economy is doing way to well for gold farming now
---
Invest in Microsoft if you want money in 10 years.
---
I had goosebumps reading this.
---
I use 1-5, Shift1-5 for main attacks. Qazsxedcrfvtgbyhn keys are Spells and macros. All with a shift and alt modifier. A few with control modifier. Also spell buttons with modifiers. Always have every possible spell slot on  my bars being used.
---
that fucking exploding zombie room...you tell the melee dps to stay out...but they dont....they never learn...
---
Another case of our playerbase must be -20IQ so they made IMPORTANT = BIG because otherwise we would never understand their importance
---
 Take into account that all healers in vanilla have sub-par dps trees, ranging from horrible to mediocre.
---
 That’s not to say they’re bad in pvp, but if you want Big Boys gear, even as enhancement, you gotta raid.
---
There’s rumors about raids taking 1 enh shaman as dps support in raids, for improved WF totems.
---
Don’t remember ever seeing that case in vanilla tho.
---
Friend - "Hey man, have you heard of this new game, world of Warcraft?"
---
Me - " No, what is it about"
---
Friend (15 minute sales pitch that included the cinematic and his character)
---
Me - Im in. What should I play?
---
Friend - Well, the guild needs Dwarf priests
---
So here I am 15 years later, still playing my dwarf priest, can't wait to start all over again.
---
I personally prefer the default UI with a bunch of addons specific to their purpose. And these are all updated for classic.

There's a time to stop, and that time was ages ago. 
---
Advice for the future: Not worth carrying that argument for twenty more posts.
---
Gnome or dwarf rogue? Never played alliance before so I have no experience with this, but I think my friend group is leaning that way this time around. Dwarf sounds good to get the clean vanishes, but i always secretly was jealous of tiny gnomes flying under the radar in bg's (combined with noggenfogger was nuts) + the root break which helps with the major weakness rogues have with being kited. Will mostly raid for gear and pvp with our own premades.
---
If you're counting LFR as seeing the raid content you might as well just say that you've seen the raid content because you watched someone clear heroic on twitch. If 'seeing' the content is all you care about, then the raid isn't made for you anyway so what's the problem?
---
From experience, enhance is easily kited. Cant speak to the others, never played paladin or druid. I have seen some pallys do some really nasty things in bgs, though. I think the druid spec for pvp is actually more resto/survival oriented.
---
Your DPS will always suck. But so does everyone elses. As a priest you do GOOD damage with wand, but throw your first skillpoints to shadow for the mana regen, and pick wands from disc tree second. Frontload you spells, so cast shield-&gt;MB-&gt;SWP-&gt;wand everything dead. Trick is to have 100% mana all the time (well, enought mana/hp to pull the next mob, without drinking or eating in between). 
---
Your time to kill is greater than others, but lack of eating/drinking will make up for it.
---
I like [only-kill-boars-challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh6iBkfvkY0) more.
---
No they stilled worked because of spell batching. You Sat and right when you would be hit, stood up because of spell batching it counted as a crit while standing thus the talents worked.
---
This is true. Hmm. Didn't consider that.
---
I thought I could get that demon hunter warglaive from the boxcover and warriors could use all the weapons
---
When molten core gets cleared start to finish in 3 hours on the very first clear, come back to this comment and just remind yourself how wrong you are
---
BRD and LBRS are not the worst ones. The one place where skipping trash very often waste more time then just clearing is in Scholomance.
---
Maybe in full heirloom.
---
I did a warrior and priest fresh start. Slower than you think
---
Which is the only class a rogue can't choose a fight with? Another rogue. Here we go human rogues with perception!
---
All you need
---
On alliance - there is only about about 4-5 spots on my warrior where I have to stop and grind. 
---
About halfway from 15-16. 
---
I think 26-27 has a small part where you grind the last 30% or so on the welps in wetlands. 
---
A small spot in your upper 30’s in swamp of sorrows. (About half a level) - although this spot is really good. 
---
When you’re in the badlands around level 41 you will kill everything you see for mount money so I guess this is a grinding spot but you’re doing quests too. 
---
44-45 is almost entirely a grind on the naga island in feralas. 
---
There is a small spot in your late 50’s depending on how many BRD groups you do. 
---
That’s about it. There’s no reason to grind really other than those spots being very exp efficient.
---
Bazelguese
---
Can I download WC3 online somewhere?
---
&gt;I mean it isn't really a meme spec, I think the only 1 raid spot thing just applies to the most hardcore guilds.
---
In hardcore guilds, you wont see any shadow priests DPSing. You can have one healer spec up to shadoweaving to apply and keep up the buff, but he/she will be healing the whole fight.
---
You do get loot for finding 40 people, that's literally what MC is. It's LFR without the queue
---
Keep inner fire up and you should be fine. Once the stuns are done, priest can easily eat the rogue. SWP+shield+flash heals.
---
Haha, of course I missed that. Thanks so much!
---
I would say bursty dps. Ele shaman, mage, war, lock, spriest
---
Read the description of the class at the creation screen and said, 'that sounds cool'.
---
I just got done having this conversation with a buddy last night. Our first character selection back in vanilla was like an arranged marriage. We had no idea what we were really really getting into, but we were committed to making it work and for most of us it did.
---
1-3h for a group of 5 people to make 300g each? Dude that's 1500g total... No way that's happening. Even if that were possible, expecting your roster to farm 300g per week is anything but casual.
---
I never thought of that....damn
---
My bad - thanks for the heads up!
---
I was talking Moonglade teleport. Probably will end up Druid, still not sure NE or Tauren though.
---
Good to know - thanks :)
---
Yeah the diet is gonna be dogshit but I will cook some pasta and other dishes than can be easily warmed up or just fast meals aswell.
---
&gt; You don't need a damagemeter, you don't need Gearscore. 
---
And for that we can all praise Elune
---
Gotcha, thanks for letting me know!
---
Dang man, thanks for the list and the link!
---
Well I keep arguing as long as there’s someone to argue with and there was somebody. It’s easy for you now to just post that out to me instead of my opponent which’ side your obviously taking. So spare me of your deep wide talk
---
No way, big beefy boi shows off tier sets much better
---
Enhance is the most limited. You basically try to get close with frost shock and hope for windfury. It's very one-dimensional. Your healing capability is very limited (due to gear availability, there are very few items made for enhancement shamans) and you also aren't very tanky.
---
Ret is similar, you have more defensive tools available, but also have a hard time closing on an enemy, because while oyu can be nearly immune to slows yourself, you also don't have a way to slow them. Then you hope for a SoC proc for burst, which is more likely than a windfury proc. However overall you are more versatile, as you can also go reckoning, which is harder to use, but can provide even more burst. A holy reckoning variant makes you a bursty healer. Gearwise you are a bit better off, as the pvp sets and t2.5 is very well suited for ret paladins. 
---
Feral is the most flexible of the three, you can quickly move with travel form, you can be tanky with bear form, you can be stealthy with cat form, you can heal yourself. Druids are great flag carriers in WSG as well. But ferals don't have the burst potential of the other classes and are generally a lower dmg threat than the other two are. Gearwise, you have to look more towards PVE here, the PVP set is trying to strike a balance between physical and caster stats, which may be not that good.
---
Could someone that has played healer only at level 60 help me out a bit?
---
I've played exclusively DPS on hardcore guilds but I really want to heal, the only things I'm worried about is being a complete pinata in the world, trying to level my professions, or just trying to farm items, etc. Are you just a squeaky toy that gets beaten up by everyone else?
---
I've played on servers with 5g respec caps but obviously those won't be a thing on Blizzard Classic, so I'm not sure what to do.
---
This is not bfa subreddit
---
Dazed
---
I was always into orcs, ever since I played Warcraft 1 as a kid. 
---
And orc with 2 axes is better than a normal orc xD
---
So I naturally went for Orc Warrior.
---
I agree, only if it was serious (lol). read the second paragraph, I mentioned that I was just trolling &lt;3
---
I'm gonna be playing horde but definitely think Dwarves are the BEST looking race in the game... Shame they're on the wrong side.
---
So many addons and no Grey Auto Sell? :P
---
Which makes me believe the next big thing in WoW could be to choose your allegiance.
---
Who says forsaken and gnomes can't be friends?
---
I had no issue in vanilla, can't see why I shouldn't be able to do it again :)
---
In the actual game and not private server non sense you have earth shock and there is no such spam cc annoying mobs.  The closest thing would be centaurs that have a nature spell they cast plus a heal you want to interrupt. Except very very few of them are above level 30.
---
I renewed my subscription on Sunday, logged into several characters between level 10 and 110, and still cannot post on the forums. I put in a ticket, but something seems to be broken right now.
---
I understand that. I've played Vanilla and Private Servers.
---
It still changes nothing: Level 60 gear, as a massive whole, is always better than gear from levels 1-59. There are obvious exceptions, of course, but these are exceptions.
---
I love how no one can legit refuse what I've said. This is a weird AF argument from people lol.
---
Linkens and In Dreams
---
So the scummy Alliance player turns out to be Horde at heart.
---
I am shocked and appalled.
---
Sounds like drug use with extra steps
---
just search *priest racials*, that's the only class that really has them
---
Bad advice
---
I think its because they are Heroes, like in Warcraft 3, the heroes unit were bigger then the footman.
---
I didn't realize that. I'll zoom it next time. I'm new to this.
---
Leveling: Shaman will be faster, Paladin will die less.
---
Endgame PVE: Both classes are expected to heal. *Maybe* one enh or ret per raid, but that's hit or miss. 
---
Endgame PVP: Ret can be good in PvP. Hard to kill them, as they have many different tools to survive. However for the average user, I would not say they are fantastic. You can always have fun, but optimally you pvp as Holy. Look up videos on ret in vanilla for a gameplay look.
---
Perception is not as strong as you think, rogue vs rogue orc will win your human
---
I planned to roll Alliance and reading Alliance hate, drives me even more! Cant wait to prove the haters wrong in pvp and worldpvp. Being looked as a underdog gives even more reason to crush em
---
I second this! I remember getting all the way to Stone Guard with my Shadow Priest at 49, with some decent dungeon gear + Hinterlands blues I was a god.
---
&gt;"DISCONNECTED."  i swear some asswipe at att had it in for me.
---
I dont think the choice of spec affects queue time at all.  You just queue up and whoever is there is there.  Premade BGs you would be more worthwhile to heal.
---
"I'm out of mongoose pots" suddently 5000 people rush to ah and empty it.
---

---
Thex is seriously so screwed!
---
Priest =&gt; Mage =&gt; Warrior =&gt; Druid =&gt; Priest =&gt; Druid
---
Priest is definitely not "out" yet, but Warrior and Mage pretty much are.
---
Gosh darn I just can’t choose. Been back and forth between Hunter and Druid for the past month of so. What I love to do in the game, and really want to enjoy, is all types of PVP. I plan on joining an raiding guild though and raiding multiple types of week in an attempt to get gear, though, and want that to be enjoyable. I want to play Druid because the leveling experience looks really dynamic and engaging, and also the diversity of specs is sweet. I want to play hunter because I feel that if I’m not doing very well I may get discouraged with my class, and hunter seems like it will wreck in pvp. I’ve Mained hunter in retail and loved that play style, I think I would love the play style in classic as well. My main worry about Druid is that even if I secure a raiding spot as a healer, I won’t be able to get gear for the specs I want to pvp on. Also, I am worried that I’m gonna be spending a LOT of money on respects and having an issue farming that much gold. My main worry about hunter is that I find it too easy and not engaging and I regret not maiming a Druid. Whatcha think?
---
You gotta ask yourself: Horde or Alliance? If either pally or shammy are on the table in class picking, then the question of which faction is really your main issue.
---
Right? Like, I read these posts of people talking about how they fully intend to clear raids via PuGs and I just stop and shake my head. Are Vanilla raids as hard as classic? Of course not. But when people on Retail still struggle in Normal and Heroic raids it's obvious that even in 2019 your average players *sucks*.
---
PServer players are literally the best of the best. People who take the time to download and level on a PServer usually are the ones who have the knowledge and skill to clear this content. So sure, PServer players can PuG the raids: they've literally done them all hundreds of times over the past 15 years. Your average WoW player? Not so much.
---
Changed in TBC if I remember correctly
---
On the flip side there's generally more demand for herbs since they make consumables that will need to be replenished. Most of the ore based items are gear so demand is lower.
---
I started on Crushridge or should I say Crashridge? 😜 Free migration from there to Twilights hammer and never looked back.
---
I don't know if I necessarily disagree with you but I think that's because Vanilla was the first iteration of this game. It's literally the foundation for all of WoW. They had to start somewhere and I'm sure it was fun and exciting to craft the world from 1-60.
---
That's pretty funny that you got Thex on there.
---
It's a terrible spec if you have a shit attitude to self improvement though. If you're the kind of player that always blames x, y and z when you lose, you'll end up frustrated by (lack of) windfury proccs.
---
If you're in NA central and rolling on a pvp server send me a message.
---
It's honestly a pretty common scenario, taken from someone that got r12 on classic on a paladin... It was annoying.
---
Chrome Remote Desktop?
---
Why bill gates? Amazon ceo has way more money.
---
So much cringe crammed into a single comment
---
I played with friends and our 5 man group was full. everyone else had choosen their class and they needed a healer. Priest was generaly known as the best helar so I took priest.
---
Placed from TBC but super hyped to get to finally enjoy that vanilla experience. Due to work and life commitments, I will really only get to play 5 - 6 hours a week maybe even less :( basically one day a week unless of cause I and doing home office or have a sick day.
---
I plan to Alliance as I just prefer the cities and leveling zones far more however I do prefer the Horde Races in general but I won't have time to make any alts so it doesn't matter too much.
---
For classes I have narrowed it down to the following:
---
Priest ( Dwarf) - Human priest was my mains back in the day and I truly enjoy healing and being an asset to any party I join. I want to roll Dwarf because of the racial and that I genuinely like the Race. I am really into PVP and Priest are meant to be dope however due to my lack of playing time I will likely not be able to do any serious ranking to get even halfway decent gear. Don't really want to be changing between Shadow and Holy all the time but I guess most classes have this drawback. Not sure how I feel about wanding my way to 60.
---
Warlock ( Human) - Not a huge fan of pet classes however the ease of leveling and being able to basically stay in one spec is a huge draw for me. Locks kill at PVP and I generally think for the filthy casual that I am it could be a good choice, also on the Alliance side Locks are typically more scarce so finding a raid spot or getting gear shouldn't be so difficult. I refuse to play as a Gnome even despite their better racial. Free Mounts would make things a bit easier.
---
Paladin ( Human ) - Wouldn't look forward to the leveling experience and basically auto attacking my way to 60 but the defensive spells are a huge positive to avoid being ganked all the time ( I will most certainly be playing PVP severer despite my lack of time available). Basically stuck healing in late game but that doesn't really matter to me as I mentioned I enjoy the healing. The free mount is also welcomed and I like the idea of being unkillable in PVP event if my damage output sucks. Really my only concern is the leveling experience which is meant to be super slow and boring.
---
Basically, the late gameplay of these three classes doesn't concern me nearly as much as the general leveling experience and how they play in PVP with basically shit gear. Any insighst will be appreciated.

&gt;p.s I’m not him.

Hahaha sure you aren't. Good old Thex. That's exactly what he would say!
---
I've downed pretty much all Mythic content up to BfA (quit before even hitting max level in BfA). I've also raided since late Vanilla and all of TBC, Wrath, Cata, MoP, WoD, and Legion. Raiding is what I like to do. But I also realize Classic is more of an RPG these days and while 40 man Classic raids won't be as mechanically complicated as Mythic, there's still a simple charm about them I enjoy.
---
Same. Judging by pserver numbers and the fact that most people travel towards the end of December... January is the safe bet.
---
Countdown has driven my hype about classic to record levels. 
---
So stoked for a launch month filled with epic interviews/topics from the aussie with the good questions and buttery voice.
---
Is it possible as a non subcriber to join the stress test tomorrow?
---
To quote the wisest of man Richard Sherman:”I’m better at life than you” :)
---
I came over from D2 as well.  Druid -&gt; Druid easy choice.  Race was easy too because my friends were Horde and only Tauren for druids.  But I do remember wishing I could play a NE druid.
---
I know I'll be looking for a good totem manager addon again
---
&gt;When a 'corporation pays taxes', who do you think loses out on money? 
---
It really depends on how the company is structured. If you're an hourly or salary employee who doesn't get bonuses then your wages would likely go semi-unaffected (assuming you're not laid off) regardless of the companies performance. If you're near the top tho (someone who receives bonuses) then you'd likely be affected, and shareholders would def be affected. 
---
&gt;A recent study by Hassett and Mathur found that for a 1% increase in tax rates, wages went down by .5%.
---
A quick google search of their work tells me that they are not people I'd be taking economic advice from if I'm being frank. And in all honesty the whole point of a company in a capitalist mode of production is to drive wages or keep them stagnant in relation to production which is [literally what has been happening for the past 4 decades if not more](https://www.piie.com/sites/default/files/realtime/files/2015/07/lawrence20150721-figure1.png).
---
 &gt;So, Blizzard being made to fork over more may have contributed to the layoffs.
---
I won't dispute that, any company will cut throats to preserve it's profits, but that doesn't mean we should bend over backwards and forwards for them, if anything it means we should be more critical and upset about it. They're a billion dollar corporation, they can afford to pay their employees a little more and not lay people off.
---
Sure, but the thing is that there has been private servers for classic content for ~15 years and overall popularity hasn't gone down.
---
You could say the same about the upcoming retail classic - people will come in and out, but the average player count won't change drastically.
---
Ideally I would like to see the content at a difficulty that makes it challenging and rewarding. Not caring about elitist shit like being first, lfr will often be out by the time I get to it. There being no tiers to content it’s always just do the latest one at whatever difficulty your item lvl qualifies for. It’s arbitrary and completely takes away any novelty.
---
Play what you like. Youll hate that you picked a race you dont like when you figure out the small differences dont matter in the casual raiding scene
---
I don't remember my first character in the beta, but my first character on launch was a tauren hunter. Played him to level 27 or so and then switched server.
---
I was around 14 years old and just picked what I liked and not what the class actually did.
---
I remember really enjoying the pet mechanics of taming, feeding, learning new pet spells...
---
Everytime I write something like this down I feel the need to play hunter again, but I know in my heart I'm a warrior!
---
It's fine pick what you like.
---
As a priest, were you spamming shadow word pain on about 70 targets at the same time? (Don’t need to explain *why* being able to combat this many enemies without difficulty makes a game bad) because otherwise you were far from capacity..
---
Nop, you have to have an active subscription to login / play during the stress test tomorrow
---
I've been using the G700 since 2010. Logitech hardware is always worth it imo.

Damn, I hope that doesn't mean people will be spread between SW and IF :(

An open heart
---
I was referring to speculation that the horde may have a population advantage which would give alliance shorter queues. It’s a poor item for me to mention given that it’s pure speculation. 
---
You’re making a lot of great points!
---
yeah fuck druids. it was also the only class that was busted in wod as far as i remember
---
Really excited for classic and the experience that for me hooked all those years ago. Looking forward to seeing all of you there!
---
Did this guy apply some sort of bass boost filter to his voice
---
Well if you care about dps go human, other than that its mostly cosmetic prefrence between nelf and human
---
Which class would be easiest to play with an Xbox controller?
---
Anything else than nelf quests, as Im planning 3 characters going through the rep grind.
---
Get out of here with your logic!!!!

Great Stamina adds very little in terms of overall survivability. The difference between rank 6 and rank 10 is only 23 stamina, coming out to 230 hp. That's like a third of a spell, and between a third and half of an auto at 60, compared to resistances at 60 nature and fire, and a great 90 at arcane, frost and shadow (both the most common spell damage types AND the most common cc types) will both give full resists and partial resists left and right. 
---
Even at one partially resisted spell a resistance stat has outweighed those 23 stamina, and being much more likely to resist fears, frost novas and polymorphs will give a lot more uptime, which is potentially great.
---
IMO, Great Stamina is exclusively for soloplay, and even then I often just end up running 60 to every resist and then stamina on top.
---
Tauren warrior because I wanted to be a bigass minotaur with a huge badass looking weapon, but I ended being more like a beggar with clothes, mail, leather,plate with the colours of the 80's
---
Alliance warrior
---
Human - PvE
---
Gnome - PvP
---
Dwarf - Women have beards
---
Night Elf - To be different?
---
End result I believe like 50% of warrior damage is auto attacks you will be fine picking what you want!
---
Skipping Dark Rune dropping mobs to *potentially* save 20 seconds should be a crime.
---
My alt was a gnome rogue and I loved every minute of it. You level weap skill faster with int bonus, you have engi bonus, you will use EA quite often, and finally, the click targeters will never get you in bgs. Your biggest issue as a gnome rogue are the various puddles and shallow bodies of water in Azeroth. Aside from that, they're great.
---
never going gnome again, I went gnome as my original max level and deeply regretted it
---
I was just speculating that horde would have more people PvPing which would make alliance paladins have shorter queue times. It was a bad point for me to make given that it’s all speculation.
---
They are incredibly strong healers in PvP. Like the other commenter said, you don’t really have a rotation in PvP. You’ll have to take into account everything that’s happening and make a decision on what the best play is. 
---
Obviously you’ll want to heal players who arent at full hp - Flash of Light for a small/fast heal and holy light for a big/slow heal. You can put Blessing of Protection on other players (or yourself) if they’re taking too much melee damage, especially if your ally is a caster. Blessing of Sacrifice to take some of your allies damage and apply it to yourself. This makes them harder to kill an harder for you to get CCed. Blessing of Freedom to help yourself or an ally from being kited or otherwise trapped in place. 
---
Cleanse removes one poison, disease, and magic effect for each use. This is probably one of a paladins most effective moves for PvP. It’s great not only for removing damage dealing debuffs, but also movement impairing effects or CC like polymorph. PvP will not be boring as a paladin. 
---
PvE might be boring for you depending on what you want from it. You won’t be killing mobs quickly, so it’ll take longer to level than other classes. Healing a raid will be 80% Flash of Light spamming.  
---
Keep in mind that at lower levels, the specs don’t matter very much for paladin. You can spec Ret to level faster and then switch holy if you wanna heal raids or BGs. Ret will still be able to heal 5 man dungeons before you get to high levels. Just make sure to have a healing set.
---
9% for mobs 15(3 levels) defense higher than you.
---
5% for same level mobs and most PvP iirc.
---
Use Leatrix Plus (Classic) for auto sell. Or BFA's Selljunk which will work on Classic.
---
paladin
---
if you're leaning mage, i'd say go mage.  the leveling speed difference for someone that isn't speedleveling is probably marginal and when you're done leveling you'll have an easier time finding groups with the mage.  can't go wrong with either choice though.
---
Old scholomance was legit. I remember the first time I ran it I kept thinking, “my goodness there’s more!?” Couldn’t believe all the stuff in there. Same for BRD, sunken temple, BRS etc. those old dungeons had that exploration factor. Just made the RPG experience.
---
Having a fat nose in front of the T3 helmet or looking like a moose with T2 isn't as astetic as a druid should be. Robes are also some fine Tauren butter.
---
No nightelves look better, the gear fits better and have a better hitbox as healer.
---
Does hydrocane and that one belt stack with druid aqua form?
---
Hi thanks for the reply!
---
you are probably right about the HZ I have only seen it once or twice on a advert by the company I bought it from. I was thinking as I am looking for Monitors that my tv was crazy high spec for what I spent on it and when I got it. 
---
this has made me want to get a monitor evenmore lol! one more question if I may? as you clearly know what your talking about.
---
im looking at a 34 inch wide 3440x1440p 100hz will my GTX1060 and clocked I58400 processor handle it ok? not fussed about achieve 100fps constantly but at least 50-60 all the time.
---
search on ebay for used / sealed ones. I am pretty sure you will find one.
---
Well the not visiting vendors portion would greatly depend on common sense. If your goal is entirely leveling as fast as you can, then forego vendoring. If you want the money, go do it at regular segments (this can be organized so you all do it at once to reduce time waste). I suspect this wouldn’t add crazy amounts of time to your overall time spent leveling, especially if it enables you to get mounts.
---
If you are clearing each dungeon multiple times, you’ll most likely keep most of your gear fairly up to date just from dungeons drops. Some slots might lag at times, but it wouldn’t be crippling. As long as you aren’t sporting 4 warriors trying to get all the same pieces and fighting over weapons, you’ll most likely be doing good.
---
Commenting to reference later. Thanks.
---
I do prefer horde but I think tools like blessing of freedom and other synergies with my warrior friend (he’s open to either faction) is making me consider alliance. I also never leveled as alliance so it would put a fresh coat of paint on my classic experience.
---
&gt; looking like a moose
---
&gt; isn't as astetic as a druid should be
---
That's because you think of a druid as a night elf, not a shapeshifter
---
That is such a great answer. Thank you very much, I think I'll go for the resistances: primarily focused on Frost, Shadow and Arcane, with a bit on Fire and Nature.
---
Appreciate the info man, thank you.
---
Do we know if twitch is going to put these add ons for classic up? Or have they already?
---
Mankrik's wife. I'm going to find her this time!
---
So only 3 servers will be available on 27th of August?
---
I'd buy a 2004 Taurus for sticker price. Great car.
---
Thank you! My warrior friend doesn’t have a preference. I just worry about being able to heal him in pvp since priest has less defensive capabilities like blessing of freedom and bubbles and poison dispel.
---
Two choices: UD mage it priest. Healing vs dps, both seem fun, not my biggest concern. 
---
Main question is which is more desired in raids? I know raids take more mages (6-7mage vs 4-5priest?), but also that he mage population is usually bigger. So which class does the raid traditionally have problems fillings?
---
anyone know if immersion the quest log addon is going to be in classic?
---
damn FD then SM is insane. that's a great combo.
---
can you add a link between that and the regular class talent build page?
---
Just know that shadowmeld cannot be used in combat. If you want to combat the squishyness you’re better of with stone form (not to mention fear ward and desperate prayer)
---
WeakAuras as a "nice to have" addon? Are you sure? It's the most versatile addon there is. You can create a ton of different stuff with it.
---
Hunter versus druid
---
I am torn between  the two after trimming my short list from mage, lock, druid, and hunter. 
---
Orginally I played a tauren huntard up until WoTlK. No idea what I was doing, feign death was my number 1 used ability, and I loved all my beasties. Didn't know what lupos was but I cried releasing my first pet. 
---
Druid I've been playing on a private server. Downed some raid bosses as a healer, enjoyed stealth kitty mode, and got to give everyone love with MoTW. I felt locked in though once my gear was all healing and I lost solo viability. 
---
So now with the return of classic I think I enjoy a more solo playstyle. Though healing was a good role for me and I liked it more than dps. I also like pvp and wonder if druid skill cap is higher than hunters? is it easy to be a semi okay huntard than  it is drood? 
---
Edit: also I think I'm more social as a gamer now, and druid benefits that because people like healers and buffs.
---
Truth
---
His new job is the wow classic grind
---
For horde, blood fury and berserking are both pretty equal in terms of value, and put them somewhat above UD for PvP dps.
---
For alliance, there is no race that has any particularly valuable dps cooldown.  
---
Humans have a slight advantage with swords, because of sword spec, but it's not that big compared to warriors because 5 weapon skill is in the tree.  Still, it represents some additional hit and you can get away with dropping a point in the combat tree or rather moving it to aggression, so really it's a little less glancing damage reduction (5% instead of 15%), a little hit rating, slightly less chance to be dodged and parried, and 2% sinister strike/eviscerate damage.  Overall if you're committed to swords, it's definitely the way to go Alliance side.
---
My favorite part of leveling Rogue was doing basically no damage versus Elementals — being immune to both poison/nature damage and bleeds. Slice-n-Dice and grit my teeth.
---
That was my impression as well. Which is lucky because that's what I wanted to play anyway.
---
Hoping to reconnect with my old buddy Thex who played warlock.
---
Except they are missing servers...
---
For example, Bleeding Hollow was a day 1 high population PvP server.. it's not on the list.. wtf?
---
Such a sad angry little man
---
As a unimportant manlet I confirm this
---
Hunters Concussive Shot. I can walk towards you but can't catch you as a melee when you are strafing away from me.
---
Lol are you serious. Imagine being so fanatic about a game that you dislike everything everyone else says who has another opinion and disagrees with you experiencing the game as it used to be. Like cmon dude. And you very obviously missed the point of his whole discussion unless you’re saying that wiping over and over in classic is how the game works. That’s just such a dumb sh$t to say. I was pointing out that even if we’re playing classic people just keep hanging on to this bullshit thesis to experience the game like back then where everybody was fresh and new to the game and didn’t know how to do things is so out of touch. People know every single bit about this game. So if you’re still wiping it’s because your not even trying to play the game correctly.
---
And the BEST boss fights.
---
Where you feel you actually earned your winnings.
---
Some of the best fights of the game.
---
Does anyone know if bartender and pitbull ui will be avalible for classic? Will be hard for me to play with Anything Else than these :p
---
There's a difference between undead and Orc/troll because of the dps cooldown.
---

Had this dilemma back on Vanilla. Eventually decided I was tired of watching my BM pet destroy people and I wanted to have some of that fun. Played Druid until I stopped in Wrath.
---
I have had a corsair scimitar and it wasn't good, the first one started double clicking so i got a new one and that had the same problem after a few months. Im using a Roccat Nyth now and i havnt had any problems with it (2 years old)
---
1. You clearly do play retail, "the truth will out". 
---
2. Why are you bringing world PvP into this. Again you're adding your own biases... It's getting boring.
---
Why is it more fair for it to be five people? Give an explanation for this, other than your vague sense of "ethics and fairness".
---
3. Again, injecting your own bias... When I and other players who enjoy twinking we're talking about the twink community, which plays with itself. You not understanding something doesn't make it stupid, there are many posts about this. Different twink brackets open up new and interesting metas, it's called variety and why those of us that have played Vanilla for a long, long time enjoy it. 
---
I'm glad you see your own fallacy in the argument though, complaining about twinking and then saying you have no problem with doing whatever you can within the game itself to have an advantage... 
---
4. I don't care that you feel embarrassed. You may even want to reflect and realise that you felt the need to cry about other people's playstyles, jumped all over my comment and vomited your opinion.
---
5. Strawman   
---
Thankfully, Blizzard don't listen to snowflakes such as yourself. See you in AV with my 5-10man Shaman turret.

Stoneform and fearward are hard to pass up

Buy a slow cooker and put casseroles on overnight. Makes the house smell lovely too haha

Yea keep talking shit about ENglish second language people. Retard
---
Different strokes. I find old school Orgrimmar to be pretty epic.
---
I'm jealous. But it's green skin this time around.
---
more like people would block them with their stupid gigantic mounts
---
are you saying my troll shaman Thex is not a hero?
---
Retard
---
Do whatever you want man.
---
They are quests
---
Bartender, Gatherer, and possibly Bagnon. I prefer to run lean on my addons else your UI starts looking more like a fighter jet’s cockpit.
---
I do care about dps, but how much dps will a human rogue do over a nelf rogue?? How much of a disparity does the weapon spec cause
---
You're welcome, happy to help!
---
Keep in mind that this is just my opinion, retraining your pet is fairly cheap (caps out at 1 or 5g I believe), so it's fairly cheap and fun to experiment.
---
IF is the most central and has very practical layout economy wise, so I predict IF will be the go to city for most alliance players.(as it is so in most private servers also)
---
Sounds like you don’t actually play retail and haven’t for some time. You are vastly oversimplifying how things work in retail to justify your ridiculous statement.
---
As others have said, it’s logistics and the raid group that are the main difficulty in Vanilla. The actually raid mechanics are for a majority of content incredibly basic. I’m not saying it cant or won’t be fun, it’s just not very complex.
---
Feral Druid’s are fine tanks for raiding. Check out baron/cstrike and skarm on YouTube.
---
If you level enchanting you probably want to keep it and might as well go all the way. Herb/skin leveling and drop one or the other at 60 for ench I would say.
---
It’s bad, if you don’t commit to making it work. I also don’t particularly enjoy the power shifting style of play. 
---
Yes it is.
---
Sounds like you should go druid because you want the higher skill cap and are worried about missing out. The issue being the lack of gear which will be harder to obtain but isnt impossible. If you raid you'll eventually get varieties of gear, especially if you can get feral OT. So you can get the pvp  gear set and a healing set and then either swap  specs or limp with a half spec for pvp/pve
---
The nostalgia is overwhelming
---
Most people will be in IF. You see lots of people in SW on retail because it became the hub for the Alliance, having boats to different areas, etc.
---
Just start a week after 27th and you will be able to estimate which server upis "good".
---
True, but at low levels herbs are bought to speed up leveling, not to replenish stocks, which is the same reason ore sells.  At 60 herbs are more lucrative for the reason you have stated.
---
&gt; Honestly I like the people on horde more.
---
My completely anecdotal experience playing both factions throughout WoW has been that I've encountered more talented players in my time playing horde. I've also encountered more a-holes on horde, though.
---
You never go full moron!
---
Do me do me
---
Yeah, if I see someone running my way, I run behind something and shadowmeld before going into combat and it takes them a while to find me, if at all. Then they eventually give up and run off. 
---
And the eating in shadowmeld is nice 
---
But yes good input, might just have to go dwarf, I do want to survive more!
---
75 a month is an incredibly cheap hobby though
---
Yeah I'm with you there, I mean the raids looked run for sure but I couldnt dedicate that amount of time. I had a PVP guild that we'd occasionally run instances but that's different.
---
It's just kind of a glib way of saying that I'd rather play a persona who is far-removed from how I am in real life, than one who mimics my real life.
---
https://www.vanillafriends.com/
---
Horde mode sounds good to me ;)
---
Notepad, for windows xp.
---
They don’t make the total *questing experience* any better, just running around completing mundane tasks for 10% value
---
People will run Ony immediately yes. Week 1 or 2 wtv.
---
There's less competition for daggers, since warriors generally don't want them as they are too fast.
---
On horde side there is slightly less competition for swords, since there is no sword skill race.  On Alliance side every warrior will want a sword.
---
Thats the name of a current retail-realm. It is a german pve realm that was there since the original vanilla launch. I have played there most of the time.
---
nope IF is popular because for most of vanilla it was the only alliance city with an AH
---
AS everything with classic the more hardcore you can the better
---
I’m more excited for the week after release. Leveling in the starting zones will be awful and will take a long time.
---
Yeah for like $1000.
---
You are the hero we need, but not the one we deserve
---
You can level in garbage gear, but I'd expect your leveling group to split and rejoin at 60 anyways.
---
Leveling with only the same people is largely impractical.
---
Horde cities are more streamlined for travel though. Very convenient zepplin takes you straight between Orgrimmar and UC. Meanwhile if Alliance wants to go to Darnassuss.....
---
It's very strange to me seeing Stormwind without a port in Classic. It really should of had one.
---
You asked the person if there were more quests he showed you they are.
---
Don't try to avoid streamer. There going to have streamers/youtubers in all the servers. I doesn't matter. Such an overblown issue...
---
If you want to play on a pvp server, choose the pvp server with the cooler name. More chance the server is going to be more popular. The realm list is going to be out before august 13.
---
Unleash your inner demons!
---
You did not play much then
---
I will definitely try out some specs and have fun experimenting!
---
When I first played Vanilla, I mailed a Hunter: now I'll be maining a Mage but I will definitely level up a Hunter: it's such a strange feeling, like "betraying my own nature" for not leveling a Nelf Hunter as a main.
---
I'll guess once you're a Huntard, you'll always be a Huntard.
---
Week 1 Ony is kindof a given for the race to 60 crowd.
---
Woah, really?
---
We will see. But I bet there’s more casual players then you think.
---
That pretty much expresses exactly how I feel about Classic coming out.
---
Please tell me if you find one! (:
---
Yep, convenience.
---
It's also enjoyable to chill in alliance cities, hordes got some nice stuff but, being a druid and having exclusive access to darnassus city unlike tauren druids million mile hike when they tp to moonglade, as well as stormwind being a pretty dern purty city connected directly to IF. it's purty gud
---
Big Slyvanas Feet
---
Didn't you know? If you roll a human the whole game becomes just like real life.
---
Hi,
---
I have never played / gotten into WOW as it seems like a money sink for buying the DLC and then membership monthly. Would classic WOW be any good to start playing? (when it comes out)
---
In retrospect it seems the general consesus for disc raiding and shadow levleing was undervalued, so i'll definetly change those rankings around. That said, neutral still is meant to show that spec is definitely viable in a role!
---
As for disc in world pvp, while it definitely has its moments, I stand by that rating due to the lack of mobility. being able to flee or chase down an opponent is critical, and aside from the occational moments near cliffs where mind control is downright hilarious, priests don't feel nearly as strong in the situation. 
---
As for dungeons, your probably right again and I should have put exceled. Dungeons are a hard one to rate because they are fairly easy, and even the most meme tier builds can handle them, but again in retrospect I must have been too harsh on the ratings!
---
As for the squishy factor, they may have some defensive capability, but compared to the other healers i'd still label them as squishy. A druid is extremly hard to kill with bear form and their insane mobility, a shaman is innately tankier with mail, and paladin obviously is immensely hard to kill with the combo of plate/burstheals/bubble
---
I'm still deciding what healer I want to play, at the moment I'm leaning towards Priest. 
---
However in raids, I mostly prefer to be a tank healer and don't really like raid healing. Was wondering if I go for priest, will I be automatically assigned to raid healing? 
---
What classes will be the dedicated tank healers (is there a difference alliance/horde)?
---
1 should roll tailoring and just funnel all excess cloth to him/her, make sure you get first aid up first. it's going to be a bit of a grind but should be doable and fun. if you are going to speed run just rely on quests items.
---
I’m still excited about now. Give me a few months.
---
&gt; If you’re trying to hire a truck driver, call them that! I s2g they call them “material placement specialists” and it’s cringey af for everyone...
---
Things like that also make it harder for your applicants to find you which just makes it harder for everyone involved.
---
As it should be :D Thrall should honestly be as large as a barrack and normal orc warriors half the size of a barrack. wc3 &lt;3
---
I always hated that too. Seeing a 200ft tirion fordring at the start of ICC was really weird to me.
---
I'm torn, I can't play the same I used to when I was in college - maybe I can get 2 hours a night in roughly, and maybe raid twice a week.    
---
I want to see raid content, at least to the end of AQ40, if I never saw the end of naxx I wouldn't be upset, but I want to focus on raiding.
---
I really want to play a warrior, and I would like to tank, but I'm worried I just won't have the time for it.  
---
Do you think I can realistically main tank as a casual (judging by playtime only). I'm going to allocate some time to level quickly, but after the first month I won't be able to play 6 hours a day.  
---
My other thought is to play a Hunter, or something like a dwarf priest who's taken on raids simply for being a dwarf.
---
So my question for you who have private server experience as a warrior, is the class enjoyable if you aren't putting in a ton of hours? Or should I play something that is more casual friendly, gears faster and isn't insanely reliant on gear.
---
I guess my point is the system is *very* easy to abuse and misuse. Especially with streamer culture being such a big thing mob rule can just fuck people
---
It’s not a closed beta. It’s the last stress test. And yes, anyone with a sub can play.
---
I was sure that i would go paladin cause they are a worse warr, but better for at more solo player (like pugging wsg, i dont like being stuck in cc). 
---
But i still need an alt... My plan was a mage, but now im thinking about switching it all up and go for warr main, and priest alt. I like roles like tank and heals more than dps, but sometimes its nice to just chill out and dps a raid or dungeon... The choices...
---
I'm not saying it's impossible to farm 300g a week. I'm just saying the 1-3hr estimate is a huge exaggeration.
---
Not only is the G600 way nicer build quality, it is also quite a bit cheaper last time I looked....like half the price...
---
Yeah sure but obviously i'm not going to check my notepad (which will be full of names) each time i see a guy from the other faction to see if he is in the list, i want an addon that constantly checks for the list for me so i can actually play the game without worrying about it.
---
11 am Thursday, Pacific Time.
---
I see, and with orcs axe skill they’re gonna want those? I may just go troll rogue with swords and see what I get in raiding first
---
As always a great show Josh!
---
STV would definetly be a pvp server.
---
His original comment was about a better questing experience. I just disagree that #number has anything to do with it. Read the thread next time.
---
Oh, absolutely.
---
Im rocking my Razer Naga Molten Edition now for over 6 Years ([https://www.amazon.de/Razer-Maus-Naga-Molten-SE/dp/B004AM5RAW](https://www.amazon.de/Razer-Maus-Naga-Molten-SE/dp/B004AM5RAW)) and I have no issue whatsoever.
---
I really love this edition of the Naga, since newer version have thicker button, which feels really uncomfortable.
---
But to answer your question, its not neccessary at all, but imo its worth it.
---
Unless you can get your hand on an old naga, i recommend a logitech mouse
---
Ive seen a few videos and read a lot of guides and it looks like something i wanna give a sjot atleast. Im for sure going for the enchanting trinket, as it will be bis for a long time, but Im not sure if it would be better with another while leveling, and I feel like everyone is going skinning and the market will be overfloaded.
---
What exactly is power shifting style of play? :o its impossible for me to not commit and do what ever i can to make My class work :)
---
Do You know what that macro is?
---
Probably viper sting for everyone with mana
---
There will be a lot of people playing either WoW or this version of WoW for the first time. There will also be people like myself playing for the first time in a very long time. I remember locations but zero boss mechanics. I plan to play a completely different class than I did in vanilla.
---
Your first post is just you shitting on anyone that didn’t come from a private server and min max everything. Get over it and let people play fresh. Your negative comment score should be a strong indicator of how in the wrong you are.
---
He obvi wants you to stick a USB in your ear and download it to your brain
---
This was the case in TBC aswell, at least inside the mount hyjal raid. Giant Jaina and Giant Thrall.
---
Yeah it isn’t a very obvious one, sorry. 
---
There is a link in the About page of both sites to the other. There is also a link to bobo-pet if you select hunter in the talent calculator.
---
it made me slightly aroused
---
I read that booklet, was triggered by the comment it would be a complex class to run - and rolled a warlock and had troubles getting my Imp ... lol
---
So i changed and rolled a Hunter, leveled that to 60, got bored then went back to my warlock and still playing him.
---
If you want to do dungeons together for gear at 60 it's going to be a little rough unless you're okay with running them a lot. Ultimately though playing what's fun for you will matter more in the long run than loot concerns.
---
ST is a nightmare lol
---
Closer to the mountain, so it probably will
---
I would say that horde questing is more efficient and grindy (zug zug, kill X of Y please), whereas alliance questing has a tighter story, but more backtracking and running around. Who doesn't like the Defias and Duskwood quests? As alliance, from 10-20 you will go to multiple zones to level, whereas horde can just park in Barrens and ride it to 22+.
---
Alliance zones, especially Redridge and Duskwood, have the misfortune of having lots of Horde coming in at various levels to gank and grief. The early leveling zones for horde are harder for alliance to get to. 
---
All of this said, the differences in faction questing only truly apply from 1-30. After that, you go into contested zones, where many quests are similar or shared, and they're not as story driven, with the exception of certain quests in WPL/EPL.
---
not any old sub, a sub to world of warcraft
---
It will be a struggle to get a raid spot as a spriest.  Not every guild takes one.  
---
On top of that it isn't particularly fun raiding as an spriest.  Your damage numbers will be abysmal for a multitude of reasons.
---
Spriests have a reputation as being less meme than other specs but it's not because of damage.  In fact, the more spriests you have the worse off you are because they require 2 debuff slots to do damage (aside from shadow weaving).  
---
Also note that their scalability is terrible.  While a moonkin can try to do things to manage their mana, spriests really only scale by getting more spell power.  Mind flay and SWP make up like 85% of your dps combined, and neither can crit.  So as gear levels increase the only way to squeeze more damage is by increasing spell power.  Any guild running more than 1 is doing so out of pure ignorance.
---
If this sounds fine to you, go for it.  If you are a designated spriest for a guild you're in it will be easier to raid for sure.  If you're trying to find a guild as an spriest you are going to have a hard time.
---
The best PvP racial by far goes to the orcs imo. 25% passive stun resistance is absolutely insane as almost every class uses stuns.
---
They make keyboards that have keys on the far left designed for macros. They are mechanical keyboards and usually $115+ for good ones. I have one and it’s a great buy.
---
Race and name changes are seriously where you think people would draw the line?  Who cares if an Orc becomes a Troll?
---
Why would anyone not use addons?
---
That is your personal opinion. They are quests.
---
You get lost once but after that its fine imo.
---
WoW back then had it so most likely: yes
---
Yes, the WoW classic client can be downloaded.
---

As a dude looking to run a casual guild i see this. My guilds goal is to clear mc before bwl release and clear bwl before the release of next raid so on and so forth. Guilds gatta respect peoples time investment as well as the people respecting the guilds time investment. Make the hours of raiding worth it but not burn ppl out or outcast them. Literal meaning of play smart not hard. Atleast thats how i see it.
---
Yes, it's mostly PvP but still has applications in some PvE fights.
---
Survivability&gt;minor dps increase as human. At least for me.
---
Bear in mind there is a "fairly" long attune for onyxia in comparison with MC is just a brd quest
---
Hello everyone one, light be with you. 
---
I really like to play a warrior, but cannot decide which race to go. I will probably play both PVE and PVP, so my choice is between gnome and human. Gnomes are good because mages (and druids, in some degree) are the bane of warrior existence, and I really want to have at least a chance vs a mage with the escape artist, on top of engineering. 
---
BUT humans are overall much better choice for PVE (both tanking and dps) cause of +5 weapon skills, and I kinda like how they look, although gnomes are not that bad too. 
---
What's your opinion on that topic?
---
I believe so, I think it's the working version of the game just with level caps.
---
This feels really overblown
---
Don't focus on Mbps. Games aren't nearly as bandwidth hungry as say streaming or downloading files. Generally anything around 10Mbit will suffice.
---
You want the ISP with the best peering to major networks to assure low latency to Blizzard servers. I don't know where you live but I assume this is generally true. Most ISPs are just virtual operators in the network infrastructure in which they operate, meaning they don't own the physical infrastructure but pay rent to be able to utilize it. These networks are connected to larger national and international networks and the traffic between them are very costly for the ISP, which is why some operators might have decent regional speeds but once you traverse into other networks the latency and bandwidth worsens dramatically. Technically you can get a 100Mbit connection that is much worse than a 10Mbit connection from another operator, all depending on the quality of peering provided.
---
All of this is hard to to know beforehand so my advice to you is to go with an ISP that seem serious enough, and don't sweat it too much regarding bandwidth.
---
Most people playing vanilla are gonna be people who have played it or have played retail for years and already have experience for the basic understanding of WoW. Is this wrong? No. Why? Because there’s almost zero Advertisment for classic wow. Only people wo know about the launch are people who are already invested in WoW. Playing a difference class or not having played in years won’t delete your basic understandment of how the game works. 
---
Good for you that vanilla is one of the easiest versions of the game. Dungeons are super easy and raid bosses have 2 different abilities at max. Dungeon packs are not hard or require any strategy whatsoever except using 1-2 CCs. 
---
So if you keep failing, and this is what my point was, OVER AND OVER, without improving then theres something wrong. And at that point it’s fair to be frustrated, which was my point to begin with.
---
There used to he an add-on called "spy" that did this. Not sure if it's still around.
---
As a maxed OSRS player, I can safely say that yes
---
Because I shouldn't have to crank up difficulty to feel rewarded. There has to be a balance between "Man did we win? I just finished my sandwich. Oh the tank needs a heal" and "fuck I blinked and the raid wiped because I was .002 seconds to slow to cast on the mob that has to die withing nth seconds of being alive."
---
Hah the problem is you can’t just jump into mythic difficulties. You gotta do the easy stuff first to even qualify for the q. 
---
“First” to me is an arbitrary competitive concept that often attracts elitists. It’s one thing to be “first” among your friends (or as In classic your server), but being first among a bunch of randoms for no real reason (particularly when gear is so meaningless) has no appeal to me. To each his own, I play games like sc2 to compete against myself and self improve. 
---
If you enjoy retail then all the more power to you m8. There are just a lot of us who don’t, and for very genuine reasons. Hence why we’re getting Classic.
---
&gt; Though, I'm not fond of having to run the length of the entire zone multiple times for those quests...
---
It's faster to fly to westfall and run to Ravenhill/Sven than it is to run down the road on foot.
---
&gt; the best feeling in the world.
---
You've missed a LOT of great feelings if you think running a dungeon is the best of the best.
---
There's always Annihilator as well.
---
This is no way confirms Kara or BC. BC is likely, but not because of this item.
---
I think you'd be surprised.
---
Nah this has nothing to do with TBC, everyone knows that Deadwind is the best place to farm gold farmers
---
u guys theorycraft some kinda nature dmg cheese or somethin?
---
youll have a ruid awakening if you use voidwalker as a personal tank =P
---
He’s gonna play only 4 hours a day I guess lol
---
My friend ran so many addons he couldn't find his character on the screen at times. He just said "I've got the boss targeted that's all that matters" lol
---
I’ve played a mage on private server and can tell you that the quality of life and gold making abilities as a mage is wonderful. You can make a ton of gold even as a fresh 60, so I think mage would be a great class to have as an alt.
---
I will be rolling priest once classic releases to try something else but I can definitely recommend mage.
---
They likely will.  These things don’t affect balance/gameplay and solve social problems.  Besides, a huge chunk of revenue these days comes from services.
---
This subreddit is just ravenous.  I actually had a guy tell me gold farmers are preferable to tokens.  There are some pretty obtuse opinions that float around here...
---
Sorry for all your downvotes
---
We have some good BiS lists in the discord's resources channel. Queue times should be quick with cross realm BGs, especially on the battlegroup we all decide to roll on.
---
No this is just a bad mess of what we all wanted to roll and trying to make it work :P
---
Warrior.
---
I like big swords and cannot lie...
---
I like mobility and stealth and want to go as a rogue. In retail my rogue can run on water, and has Link’s hookshot for a blink-type travel. And runs fast. My question is: in classic. How mobile is the rogue? How fast is stealth speed, I read it actually makes the rogue move slower, but some talent can make him fast again. Can stealth become faster than normal 100% speed? Thanks.
---
You got suckered into healing at the end?
---
That start to finish as in zero world buffs -&gt; buffed -&gt; travel time to AQ40 -&gt; any rebuffs between -&gt; BWL/MC?
---
It doesn't really make sense, since you've basically got two "world buff" periods.  So it's not like World Buff for AQ is saving you time on BWL/MC when you need to rebuff.  You're still clearing raids once a week.  I get it if you want to cram all your raids into a single day, maybe makes sense.  
---
You're likely going to do your order of AQ40 -&gt; BWL -&gt; MC just for sake of time to travel is faster from AQ to BWL vs BWL to AQ.  I don't know what they were cramming AQ into, but 4 hours to do all 3 means you're losing buffs half way through, which seems like BWL/MC are not with world buffs and just on consumes.  Maybe first bit of BWL.
---
If you're going to re-buff between AQ and BWL/MC, that's a whole other travel time to coordinate.  I feel you're talking about an hour of pre-raid time alone to get everyone's buffs up and fly out to AQ.  2 hours to clear AQ40.  Another 30 minutes minimum to rebuff ZG, if you want to try to get songflower, DM, etc you're probably talking another hour.  Then BWL in around an hour, MC in around an hour.  
---
I see world buffs not for clearing raids faster, but being able to split up a 40 man raid into 20:20 to double your loot drops.  That's really the only way I see doing world buffs that make sense.
---
Not really true.  There aren't enough debuff spots to justify two shadow priests, and their raid dps is probably lower than an oomkin or enh shaman.  Any guild doing so will be doing it out of pure ignorance as to how bad an idea it is.
---
With 2 spriests you need 5 debuff slots just for the two of them.  That leaves 11 for literally everything else.
---
My gf can't stand me anymore talking about classic and my social unavailability beyond the 27th
---
Rogue or Druid?
---
I have been trying to decide for so long as to which I would enjoy more. Rogue is by default much stronger in PvE, as well as being a PvP monster. However, rogues are sometimes pretty boring to play with their simplistic rotations throughout the leveling experience. Druids are okay in PvE and im fine with healing, but I really love their 1v1 and WPvP capabilities. I can go HOTW and heal PvE while still having a viable PvP spec. Druid gear is also easier to come by.
---
While druids have less boring of a rotation and a higher skill floor, they still don't have nearly the amount of burst that rogues do. Most druid PvP encounters are just a battle of attrition until you can finally widdle down your opponent.
---
Both classes have great perks but I need something to tip me in the right direction
---
Except we literally saved all of Azeroth multiple times and people call you THE hero of Azeroth.
---
Why the flux would an item that existed in vanilla be a clue if we get Classic-TBC or not.
---
I was rolling a Mage in the beta thinking i would main a mage for vanilla with a Druid as my main alt and AV weekend changed that complete.
---
To go from healing to back capping camps with rogues and the 2 games we won i tanked the boss. 
---
There so much fun in the utility of druids.
---
That being said if you like one shotting people Druid probably isn’t the look, really geared boomkins can do some massive crits but that’s a lot of work for something that can be done on another class much easier.

Old fart here!  Looking forward to playing.  Also, check out this thread to see the other fogies who have been lurking.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/87p5au/where\_are\_all\_the\_old\_farts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/87p5au/where_are_all_the_old_farts/)
---
I played Paladin in Diablo II and based my char on him. Still my main to this day and re-rolling for Classic!
---
World of Warcraft : A broken lore.
---
Sound good for me, for an expansion name.
---
Why's it easier for raiding and pvp as alliance?
---
Even pre-release there's a syndicate with like 25 already existing nordic guilds looking to play together on a single server. Nordics are like 5% of Europe. Add in the fact that the majority of players (judging by this subreddit's stickied poll) are just looking to roll somwhere on a whim. 
---
1 PvP English server seems extremely low.
---
Bartimeaus trilogy?
---
Horde is fine for pve. Thunder bluff is a great City imo. Horde quests and lore are deep and immersive. 
---
I've played alliance and horde extensively. I have a slight horde preference, mostly due to the races themselves and genuinely I enjoy the quests a bit more. The only zone I really miss as horde is duskwood.
---
Anyone who tells you that one faction is way better is biased. They're both really enjoyable experiences. Assuming you enjoy the horde races at all (in terms of animations and in terms of us having shaman instead of paladin) you'll have a great time.
---
Not if its a recreated true authentic vanilla experience.
---
I want to run horde, but I hate all the race animations. So stuck with alliance.
---
Clearing wont be an issue for neither Ony nor MC, getting enough people to 60 AND attuned will be the issue, onyxia attunement is very long and the end step requires you to do UBRS once for every single player in order for them to get attuned.
---
Always liked bows and arrows so I went hunter. Then I found out they have pets, which 14 year old me thought were "too easy", and that they used guns later which I didn't like. Switched to mage which was fun until I saw Maydie/Pat/Swifty PvP videos and I rerolled a warrior on a PvP server and stuck with that until half way through TBC where I found my calling of Warlock.
---
What did you get out of this smart ass comment? Did it improve your day?
---
He isn't porting any of his addons to classic, as far as I know.
---
I understand why it's good in a dungeon or raid as you want to be able to quickly identify important targets, but there is no need for them to be 12 feet when they are asking me to collect 10 big Bear arses.
---
If I'm surprised, I'll be surprised. But I just don't see floods of people leveling all the way to 60 in vanilla WoW and catering their entire experience around accommodating a streamer's every whim. It's not exactly quick and easy to get to max in classic.
---
Holy paladins are extremely tanky and hard to kill. Sound like the perfect choice for you.
---
I can tell you from my personal experience that gearing a BiS holy paladin at 49 is very easy. Most of the BiS gear is just "of the Eagle" green plate gear bought from the AH.
---
She is an elf ! She isn't like us ! She is ugly ! Pointy ears !
---
Soo true bro I bet you’re talking about sex I love that feeling haha. With hot babes too. Good call bro, can’t let him think dungeons are fun 👌🏻👌🏻😂
---
Improved revive pet is so hard to lose at 60 when you respec for raiding
---
You said you know what race/class combo you want, but not the faction? The race that you want should decide the faction then correct?
---
No it cannot, it is maximum of 85 percent if I remember correctly
---
Sodapoppins brought more than 600 players just to a shitty pserver
---
How many streamers have that kind of influence though?
---
You already flared up bro just embrace the HoTs
---
This is the correct answer.
---
Kui nameplates is working on a classic version, but I don't expect many BFA nameplate addons to be ported to classic due to how restricted nameplate functions were back then. But we'll see.
---
You don't understand basic human psychology then.
---
People (specially online) are desperate for attention. Yes you can bet they will do anything they can to be "recognised" by the streamer.
---
Totally agree, especially if they're going with the older anims/models. I don't mind having them, but they're damn ugly
---
As someone who had to run Scholo 27 times to get my 1% drop chance paladin libram not too long ago, FUCK scholomance

* Fighting PVE boss with &lt; 305 Weapon skill = 9% hit cap

* Fighting PVE boss with &gt;= 305 Weapon skill = 6% hit cap
---
* Fighting player in PVP = 5% hit cap
---
They haven't released the server list yet.  We still don't know server names, or even how many we are getting.
---
This is incorrect. 
---
https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table
---
Luckily my server will be picked by other people.
---
Hell yes. The sell junk add on is a requirement lol.
---
Pretty sure this was the effect even in Vanilla as a reward to bring you to the Kara raid when it was planned for vanilla release.
---
Kara would be cool in Classic, but it just wouldn’t fit the class design of Classic. Mechanics wouldn’t translate well and it might would make the place not have the same appeal it had in TBC.
---
Lol launching with 5 servers would be one of the most stupid things I've ever heard. Even 5 servers per region is such a stupid thought. Could you imagine ALL of the pvp EAST being lumped into one server? The que times would be fucking hours on a slow day lol.
---
I think it's between 15-30 realms to start off, maybe they merge some in a year or down the line.
---
Based on your scientific analysis, shouldn't Thunder Bluff be the best city in the game by that metric? By far the most open and surrounded by green rolling hills.
---
You should watch asmongolds stream once, people are literally lining up to trade him gold.
---
Male Gnomes are way more annoying, they have the goofiest faces in the game.
---
Okay?
---
This.  My brother was playing and I was tired of watching him play so I grabbed the booklet and read about each class.
---
Jokes aside, why phase 6 being naxx is so bad? their dps drops too much? are other classes too good at this point?
---
What did you get from this one?
---
I think you may have answered your question.
---
You understand what both classes do.
---
You seems to be slightly more negative on the side of rogues, and more positive on the side of Druid.
---
Rogues will be a much larger percentage of the player base.
---
If you're going for PvE you will have to possibly fight over spots/gear.
---
Druids you won't have to.
---
A fantastic Druid will be recognized more, but as the saying goes 'Jack of all trades, masters of none'.
---
Rogues absolutely do burst DPS. They are fantastic in PvE and PvP.
---
Druids can do the same thing, just not as well - however the utility they bring can completely adjust/change a fight be in PvE or PvP.
---
Do you want to be feared because of how dominant you are in your rotations/ganks?
---
Do you want to be loved because you understand the high skill cap for Druid, while bringing benefit to your group?
---
Just some thoughts.
---
Im keeping it minimal but item prices, decursive handy notes and some low impact mods are good using the stress test to get keybinds and addons setup

---
Thanks so much for the list.
---
Do you know that these will work on Classic release ? :)
---
It was the same way in vanilla. They knew TBC and Kara were coming out at that point, so it was just a cool on use item that had utility going into the next expansion.
---
Yes I think this was again part of being designed later they fixed the travel side of the Horde but didn't for the Alliance as it was too late
---
Not the first week. We (a semi-hardcore guild, EU) will start Onyxia/MC farm from week 3. Until then, we’ll probably run Onyxia and MC pugs until everyone in the core roster have sufficient gear.
---
Don't know yet, he hasn't answered
---
Alliance has the story in Vanilla.
---
You will be much slower than Retail. You can spec into faster movement speed in stealth, but it will be noticeably slower.
---
You have sprint, but you don't have the heal like in Retail. Rogues are mobile in Classic compared to other classes - but to set expectations it will feel much different.
---
If you dont see this discussed a lot you dont sort by new.
---
This has been discussed a thousand times and there is not a perfect solution. Layering isn't loved but its a necessery evil. Dynamic respawn will end up with every player picking 1 mob and farm that one over and over.
---
Authentic release would mean a ton of server crashes and extreemly long queues, something blizzard will never recreate.
---
No one knows exactly how release will go and thats fine.
---
At this point I'm convinced every post on this sub is a troll post
---
Not sure if this is the right place to ask, but trying to decide between a PvE and PvP server. From what I'm reading, so many people will be on PvP and i'm affraid PvE servers will become more sparse. I most likely plan on playing a hunter, unsure of faction yet. 
---
Ultimately i will have at max 5-10 hours a week to play, if that, and I worry about the prospect of spending some of that time dealing with griefers/being camped etc.  I also don't have a desire to be the ganker or camper or hang in STV to do ad hoc PvP.  Large scale WPVP seems fun and I think I remember enjoying BGs. 
---
Any thoughts on the above? I guess when typing it out it seems a bit crazy to go onto a pvp server, I just worry about how full the pve servers will be.
---
average max 15 fps :D feelsgoodman
---
I used to play on one.  It definitely got hot and I had to keep the graphics way low but was fine for casually leveling.
---

Did you find any gatherer related addon yet? I can´t find gatherer for classic.
---
Anything on two wheels is fine. The super tenere is big and boring, but keeps me out of trouble. It replaced a tiger xcx that I liked better. That triple just goes. But that garbage wp suspension never should've went to market. I'll never buy a modern triumph again. Besides that, I regret selling my Ducati urban enduro. I'll probably get another scrambler, but in the meantime I picked up a ninja 300 track bike that gets around okay. Next project is an old Ironhead chopper I came across.
---
This is what insecurity looks like, folks.
---
For me it's not a reason to change class, because ultimately it's only more time to invest in your raid preperation. Play what's fun for you.

&gt; E'ko will be farmed for maybe an hour here and there.
---
Irrelevant tangent.
---
&gt; More people will form small groups and grind the repeatable quest while getting the power e'ko from the furlbolgs.
---
Irrelevant tangent (not to mention it's even wrong since the furbolgs drop another E'ko.)
---
&gt; 90% of your time spent on the quest grind is in transit between the giver and the mobs, not killing them.
---
You didn't even respond to my original concern.
---
That's what I mean. I'm really not interested in a discussion where you just bring up a different topic when you get challenged on one.
---
KHAZUKAN KHAZAKIT HA!
---
I mean, you never need a damage meter, but most serious players want one so they can work to improve.
---
I use very minimal addons.  Once you have too many it starts to feel like a different game to me.  Just a few for QoL
---
It's a joke, I personally don't care for BC - I just wanted to create a discussion about it
---
Both are sought after pretty regularly. Mages will have a larger playerbase, but you most likely won't have to fight for a spot if you're good at planning/reaching out. DPS meters will be a focus depending on your goals.
---
Priests were slightly harder to find - just per the norm of MMOs.
---
\--
---
With that said you'll most likely find an easier time for finding a group with Priest, but mages won't struggle all that much. Both scale well through all content in Classic.
---
Reading this, i cant wait
---
post it notes
---
It's downloadable but you can't make any characters or choose a realm yet. Go into the WoW tab in the Battle.net client and right above the Install/Play button is a drop-down menu that lets you switch between the two versions.
---
Nice try Thex
---
To be honest I'm not sure.  WoW Classic has some seriously low requirements to play it.  I would recommend just using the TV.  You have a great TV and I bet it supports 1080p and 1440p resolution too.  Check [rtings.com](https://rtings.com) (tv review site) for your model number.  Down in the input section of that tv should be the support resolutions and their refresh rates you can achieve.  If necessary you could probably put the tv down to 1080p or 1440p at 60hz.  Your computer shouldn't have a problem with 1080p 60hz at the minimum.  Scale up from there while changing settings in the game until you have no tearings or achieve minimum 60fps at all time.
---
That’s how Classic is, you can easily invest a good bit of time into something and get no personal reward. It also encourages you to friend and re-group with people you have a good experience with, increasing the feel of an actual community on your server.
---
How about Arthas suddenly SWOLE after equipping that armor.  Or is that correct lorewise?

Constantly changing minds but atm:

I lost my Job and my new one starts in September, so I’m lowkey happy I lost it so I can at least play for almost a full week full time. My GF also never played WoW before and wants to start with me, so it’s gonna be extra exciting to start with someone who doesn’t know the game :D
---
See yall in STV!
---
Maybe it was just my server, but we used to raid X-roads regularly. It always turned into some huge conflicts between horde and alliance 60s. This was even on a PVE server. Did Xroads raids not happen everywhere? I hope I didn't get a better (not typical) alliance experience lol.
---
Druids are extremely strong tanks in low levels, so following the general leveling feral build is perfect to also allow good speed while questing too. Your first priority is to get the 30% movement speed from Feline Swiftness before you have flexibility in actual viable differences in the build. Movement speed is paramount while leveling. After Feline I’d heavily recommend Furor in resto. It’s incredible for many reasons, but the biggest for tanks to me it allows you to prehot pulls then pop bear, which gives you tons of aggro and makes you basically invincible for a bit, then you still have 10 rage which is even better than just staying in bear (Unless a chain pull will maintain rage and your healer wants that).
---
After Furor is where it’s more up to you IMO. I go Feral Charge next, which even in dungeons it’s such a short CD you can use it to root runners, which is fantastic. 
---
Then I go down Feral until around 51 when I can justify NS Feral. I’d suggest to at least stay in the feral Tree until NS Resto due to Predatory Strikes, Feral fraerie and HOTW being better than the 10% damage in the balance tree, but you could probably make the balance tree direction work instead. 
---
Honestly as long as you have leather gear with Stam you’ll probably do fine tanking anything anyway until higher levels when these talents help you be a great tank
---
It will run but it will get super hot. I have a 2016 Air and I can play it but it heats up very quickly. I also think it is ruining my battery as my laptop doesn't hold charge as long as it used to at all.

lfd is a one night stand

friending and regrouping people is a meaningful relationship
---
Do you want a one night stand or meangingful relationship? thats how i see lfd over regrouping and friending people.
---
The point is, in retail it doesn't matter at all. You could ignore new gear and new skills (I know I did that and I still killed everything fast).
---
In classic WoW doing a hard quest, like the warriors weapon, means that you will be more powerful for like a week. A new skill means more possibilities while fighting, it has something to look forward.
---
Doing leveling stuff while leveling in classic matters. Doing leveling stuff in retail doesnt. I tried it ~2 months ago, I created a worgen hunter, and I didn't care about new skills and new gear. When I got to level 15 and 30 I just didn't care about those 2 talent points. My rotation was "cast aimed shot and run to the mob while casting steady shot" by the time I got in melee range it was almost dead.
---
For leveling to matter it shouldn't affect the max level, it should feel rewarding so instead of getting burn out, you are engage in the leveling process
---
I hate this bot
---
Ive played druid on a pserver and can tell you, druids can destroy everything(with effort). The only classes youll have trouble with are a hunter and lock. But hunter is way more of a sit back and range kite a class to death. Fun but not exactly a challenging/rewarding class (imo). Youre also not as versatile when you play a hunter. Youre great at world pvp but youre not exceptional. As a druid, people are going to invite you to come hunt enemies in phase 1 and 2. and in phase 3 youll be a sought after flag carrier. 
---
Druids are highly rewarding. Youre abusing the shifts in for almost every fight, esp 1v1s. The skill cap on this is very high. Youre trying to keep track of your opponents slows, your mana, your rage/energy and if your hots are keeping up. I can assure you, if youre oom youre going to have a bad time. I ran feral all the way up lvling and I lost maybe 10% of fights. It got to the point where id walk up to people in bear form and start hitting them instead of a burst stealthed opener. 
---
If you learn the class, you'll love it. 
---
Some tips for lvl 60: You can play two specs. HOTW with a pvp emphasis. Or resto with feral charge and shapeshifting cost reduction. 
---
1. Hybrid HOTW is going to be good from the start of lvl 60 and only gets better in hybrid tier/pvp gear. Druids are one of the few classes that have sets designed for hybrid stats across the board. This is by no means a burst class where you get a kill in 4seconds. Youre going to have to rely on opening and dotting an opponent up, then shifting out for insects and moonfire, then hotting yourself up, then cat/bear form to wear them down. 
---
2. Resto you just never die lol. Not great damage at alllllll, but you can shift all day long and similarly wear your opponent down. Very good spec once you have some good healing gear. 
---
The best thing about being a druid is you can actually heal /tank / dps all in one spec.
---
It is 100% worth a shot at least for a month, will only cost you $15 and if you don't enjoy it you can easily unsub. You will enjoy it though.
---
Still having trouble deciding on what to play. The two friends I’ll be mostly playing with are rolling warrior/priest, so we’re already covered for tank/heals for dungeons. Which is fine, because I prefer dps anyway.   
---
With a focus on mostly PvE (I’ll still PvP, it just wont be a priority) I’d like to play a class that brings utility to groups and does competitive damage, but also does well solo. 
---
I’m also concerned about playing classes that are popular/overplayed because of raid spots and gear competition, but maybe it’s not as important as I’m making it out to be. 
---
Any suggestions?
---
Pre 1.0 Vanilla in the Beta there was a point where you where able to skin Tauren players when they died. It's a shame they took that out of the game.
---
Yep. Healing through all raids in vanilla. Managed to become feral in BC!
---
Faerie Fire would like a word about that free vanish...
---
thanks for your help! much appreciated!
---
Tirion was definitely the most jarring for me, too. This is when I started really noticing this trend and could no longer un-see it everywhere.
---
I mean he towered like 2 whole feet over my blood elf who I imagined to be on the lean side.
---
Barrens blugghghgh.  Westfall and the defias line is such a fun quest line for an early level.
---
I think they'll skip tbc and lk and go straight from classic to WoD
---
wouldn't recommend it 
---
unless you want to fry some eggs on it
---
It's not about floods of people. Small groups will have large impacts. For examples of this, look at the economies US Illidan or EU Tarren Mill compared to smaller but still high pop servers. Streamers servers will have very distorted economies. But it honestly might be worth it to play on a higher pop realm.
---
Ya id say I'm getting close to obsessed with it now hahaha. It's gonna be pretty sweet Aug 26
---
Mom won't know you're using gamer words if you put symbols in them
---
Are you calling our sweet moo moo cow female taurens ugly?
---
THEY ARE SWEET CINNAMON ROLLS YOU MONSTER
---
No, magic cleansing is the best part. Love the username, VSG.
---
It’s not that she’s not comfortable. It’s that korean is easier and it’s hard for me to explain “ smite, mind control, Frost mage etc” in English like what it does and how the attacks work. When it’s explained in korean it’s better and not exact translation. 
---
Her first time playing an MMO and I’m trying to get her on board and make it fun and easy,  it a teaching assignment. She reads and writes and speaks but her korean is obviously better. Thanks for the suggestion though!
---
Is that arses from big bears or big arses from normal bears?
---
I like the discussions happening here! Thanks for this!
---
I wish the duration was longer, that would make things so much easier lol
---
If you are alliance, for horde it’s 4x ubrs a Lbrs and 4 world dragons. Alliance only Chain can be done in one sitting.
---
God I hope not. There were great expansions in between that should not be skip! lol
---
Strange way to spell hardiness.
---
Warriors have the most benefit of having an upgraded weapon.
---
holy shit is this a real statistic? I mean my commute is 37 min but I figured I was on the higher end
---
Nope it's about convenience for content. Ironforge had the only AH for 14 months and the other cities had them for 11 months, so to the majority of players more time was spent with AH's in every capital. If SW was a more convenient location for a capital city there would have been a huge shift once it had its own auction house, but the location of SW sucks as it's much further from Onyxia, MC, BWL and Naxx than IF is.
---
Trust me my friend, roll a druid. It's so rewarding to kill people. you get bored of having to rely on a  cs to ks as a rogue just to kill someone lol. It's fairly straight forward where as a druid has to do many different things to make the class work. But you can beat mostly every class with the exception of hunters. 
---
If you are a decent druid, people will for sure invite you to come world pvp. You will make a huge name for yourself. Both pve and PvP. 
---
Druids are very strong in the world up to lvl 40. People arent going to beat you many times unless they heavily out gear you, which they will if they farm SM lol.  At 60 everyone becomes a bit stronger and are able to kill you easier, but your gear is easy to come by and the hybrid druid gear is incredible compared to other classes gear (imo). Not to mention, at 60, you have an instant heal (in HOTW) and a way higher mana pool to come out for hots and play with shifts. The three most popular classes are the easiest for you to kill. War Mage Rogue. although a good rogue can for sure eat your face. 
---
You just need to give the class some time and effort and it'll be rewarding. People "bash" druids for their inability to be good at one thing but they seriously make up for it with utility and ability to both sustain dps and heal.
---
no why would you think that?
---
It’s because of the reddit filter you stupid fuckface
---
As a long time Alliance main, TB is far and away my favorite Horde city. So serene and relaxing and sunny.
---
On alliance paladins pick up the tank heals, and priests do either of the two healing roles. On horde, priests pick up the tank heals while shaman do either of the two roles. Paladin heals are great single target, and shaman chain heal is great multitarget, so the priest role changes depending on faction.
---
I can only assume you're a troll at this point considering my comments were directly related to the competition that you imagined up. Also, you shouldn't dispute a comment without checking your own info. The Furbolgs give Winterfall E'ko which is used for Juju power, as stated.
---
Yeah once the community kicked off  a little bit they realized that it was more hassle than it was worth considering they are gonna make a ton of money from old/new players coming to play classic either way.
---
You can knock your Onyxia quest out while levling with a slight detour.  It's not entirely terrible to have it done before you hit 60.
---
First get Shadowforge Key and UBRS key.  
---
For Alliance, First quest has you killing 50-55ish elites.  Steps 2-8 are FedEx and then you go into BRD.  Turn in is in the dungeon, then FedEx step 9. 
---
Come back to BRD to grind mobs in BRD to get "A crumpled up Note" for step 10.  11 and 12 are in BRD escort quest.  13 is FedEx, 14 is escort in SW.  15 is a FedEx.  16 is killing Drak in UBRS.  The harder part is the UBRS, but you can easily do everything else pre-60.
---
WrA is sadly dying off too it seems like. We took a huge punch in the gut during WoD and then BfA wasn't kind to us either. I know a lot of RPers who switched over to MG
---
I was having trouble deciding the order for the top 3 between hunter, rogue or warrior BUT I wasn't sure how big a deal weapons are for caster classes
---
Take the opportunity to clean up a bit, or if you're in voice chat level an alt even.
---
Dungeons are fun. But saying they are the best is what he is mocking. I love video games too, but there are much better experiences than running a 5 man dungeon in life.
---
The fact you don't know people in general will be better at wow now than 15 years ago is mindblowing.
---
Hard to answer because there’s a lot of factors. PvE or PvP server? Do you want to raid? Do you already have a guild or do you have a history of successfully joining and participating in a guild? What do you want to do most of: solo instances and farm, wpvp solo, wpvp group, BG solo, BG group, 5s casually, raid, raid hardcore, etc.
---
I personally like priest of the three but hard to recommend to you without more info.
---
The female 1h animations are really nice, the male 2h animations are really nice.  
---
Choose based on that.
---
I would bet most guilds won't take the time to farm hydraxian rep outside of MC, and will instead go 8/10 for a couple weeks.
---
Gnomes are kill on sight.
---
I thought it might be fun to try to level in starter gear, except the weapon.
---
Hunter brings utility in tranq shot.    
---
Very little gear competition (comparatively)
---
They both have their charms. I think male looks cooler tanking, female looks cooler DPS and PvP
---
ilevel in classic is meaningless.
---
I hadn't thought of it that way either until life got busier. Actually had decent success advertising groups to do ST in pieces though to get it done over a few days rather than get block of time to do a full clear.
---
Yep, I'm going back to school in the fall. Between that and working full time I don't anticipate myself hitting 60 for probably three or four months.
---
I've made friends with whom I still have contact today!
---
We've had so much fun it's insane.
---
I'd say rogue, feral and warrior are at the bottom. A feral barely gets anythnig out of a weapon and the other two are so hit reliant, their damage will take a massive hit without gear. Rogue and feral can save it soemwhat with their non scaling finishers, but warriors are easily rock bottom.
---
In the middle tier, we have all the casters, ret paladin and enhancement shaman. The casters can rely on strong base values, so aren't that weapon reliant and the weapon is usually the biggest part of their spelldmg bonus. Ret and enhancement are less gear reliant due to several non-weapon based abilities, better hit chance and the weapon plays a big factor in their dmg.
---
Hunters are easily best, as their gear doesn't affect pet damage and the weapon is a mjor part of their dps, plus they have non weapon based abilities like arcane shot.
---
what level leatherworking do you need to make a green?
---
Also what level ench would you need to make lvl 5 wand?
---
Warlock or Mage. Warlock would let you summon 2 more to fill up 5s quickly. Mages are just insane DPS plus portals, food, water.
---
Im fond in two mechanics in RPGs when thinking about picking a class: bursting big dmgs and paying attention to timings (autoattacks swings, rngs and such). For these reasons I have usually been more intrigued by melee swingers such as warrior in Vanilla and paladin in Wotlk.
---
I really enjoy warrior gameplay but now that I have had plenty of time to think about my main class selection I have started to think more about Warlock. I am just wondering if instead of trying to catch my enemies the playstyle of trying to avoid people getting to me is satisfying.
---
Is there anyone who has had same kind of ideas, or any other insight if I should play the style Im used to or could I find satisfaction in Warlocks style of gameplay.
---
Tank healers on Horde side are a mix of druid and priest.   
---
The Shamans are raid healers with chain heal.  
---
On Alliance, Paladins become the defacto tank healer due to how flash of light works.
---
Rogues.
---
I have found LOTS of guides on a weapon progression track for warrior so I'd believe it but can you dig a little deeper into your reasoning?
---
I don't think any one, warrior or not, would complain about having a pocket healer of any variety.  You'll have plenty of your own tools with shields, psychic scream, mind control, etc.
---
You can always go to one of the instant 60 places around to test both out a bit in WSG/AB and see how they feel to you.
---
yeah drain taking could be a deceiving name for some people. I think it's called tanking because it's not the VW that's doing the tanking while leveling, but you for your succ.
---
Re-read your first post man.
---
You went off the rails about dungeon wipes when the OP never said anything about it. He just said he enjoyed running long dungeons like Scholomance, especially before you get gear that makes it easy.
---
It's not fun at all, but making it through the instance after all those trials and tribulations with some new gear is very rewarding. Maybe you made some friends along the way too :) (at least the ones who didn't suck)
---
People throw actual real world money at these guys...you think people won't buy them potions and shit?
---
Dude there are thousands of people crying for Asmons attention. It's obvious. Did you watch the beta? Him, Soda, Esfand even were all just gifted whatever they wanted. That was on a server with a very limited playerbase. That'll shoot up drastically in actual classic
---
I can't believe gift of the wild is just for base healing.  No wonder why druids are the worst healers.
---
This is such a great way to handle loot, best of luck with your guild and raid runs :D
---
\#WODNochanges
---
so is vw usable at all? I guess as a panic button for the shield but other wise seems like a pointless pet now, sadly :(
---
Oh snap. Ty.
---
Rag has just as much of a time sink into it.  The Onyxia quest chain can be trickeled down as you approach 60, so really the only large group quest you need is UBRS.
---
The Hydraxian Waterlords rep is what's stopping you from summoning Domo and killing Rag. You need 7 people wiath Aqual Quintessences in order to douse the 7 runes, or keep sending someone back/forth summoning to pick up new ones.  But really, you'll likely be farming MC trash and have a larger group to get the rep, so more people will have waters.  
---
Pretty sure Drak blood is lootable by everyone in the raid.  So you can attune 10 people at a time.
---
Druid is very difficult in Vanilla. It’s much better in TBC. I’d suggest going rogue for vanilla and you can always roll a Druid alt and play it casually, then main it in TBC when they are insane. It’s night and day. I loved my Druid in TBC but it was pretty bad in vanilla if you tried to play it like a rogue. If you want to tank 5s or heal, go Druid. But if you’re thinking cat vs rogue in vanilla, it’s no comparison: go rogue 100%
---
That is just the reality of it. I was in a Maraudon group the other day and with completing all the quests and all wings, took us somewhere around 4-5 hrs from forming to completing. The thing that you will find is different is that the average quality of player you come across will be a bit higher compared in retail. Those impatient or who can't handle sitting on their ass for 30min to an hour to form a group probably wont make it too far in classic.
---
The diseases that slow you are not so bad since any ability that removes movement impairing effects will also remove that. So things like improved sprint and vanish etc.
---
That's what you get for grabbing all those hunter weapons you greedy bastard. /s
---
Congratulations on first sponsor!!!
---
In my opinion for the first few weeks people will treat dungeon groups like LFD where the slightest non important issue to them will end up with them leaving but once they realize that dungeons are a case of working together for an hour + they will either not do dungeons at all or learn to not act like spoiled children and actually stick out a wipe or two without complaining about x player being shit for y reason.
---
just play what you like lol
---
Why stay in Ironforge for 11 months after Stormwind got its own AH? IF was the capital due to the much shorter travel times to every raid other than ZG.
---
A friend of mine was a Tauren Warrior. 
---
Started playing a few weeks after Vanilla came out. Sometime in TBC he noticed that he missed his lvl 10 defense stance quest.
---
He tanked through the entirety of Vanilla btw. Not very good, but he tanked.
---
And it has a very fast cast time so you need to be quick with the interrupts or stuns.
---
A pretty substantial difference at the top level. 
---
There's a 40% chance for a glancing blow to occur vs a level 63 boss. 
---
At 300 weapon skill, a glancing blow will deal 35% less damage. 
---
At 305 weapon skill, a glancing blow will now only deal 15% less damage. 
---
On top of the glancing blow penalty, weapon skill affects your hit cap and chance to miss. Allowing someone with weapon skill to use gear that gives more attack power or crit. 
---
300 weapon skill = 9% hit cap from gear, 8% chance to miss. 
---
305 weapon skill = 6% hit cap from gear, 6% chance to miss. 
---
There are gearing options that include an increase in weapon skill. But they are highly sought after or very expensive.

I haven’t got a proper answer for your question and i’m a newbie Druid but I can share what i’m thinking.
---
I’m rushing Feral Swiftness + Feral Charge then jumping to balance for Natural Weapons + Omen of Clarity and then going back to Feral. I think a must have talent for a Feral Druid will be Faerie Fire (Feral) so that might be something you’ll want to factor in your decision too. I think Furor is a great talent but I personally don’t want to get that untiil later as Power shifting doesn’t come online until level 40 when you get the Wolfshead Helm. 
---
As I said i’m a newbie so i’m probably not the best person to be listening to!
---
At least Wrath had the train set
---
Eh RFC &gt;&gt;&gt; Stockade. 
---
And Horde has easier access to early dungeons in general, but overall Alliance has a better questing experience.
---
Why use this over vanillafriends?
---
https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRNJPFfrTz8E83HrC7OAealxyTowhFN7CxRVo0ssMFIxnzo5fqn
---
I see Thex, I upvote
---
&gt; And I've considered them,
---
Really? You think you've managed to suss out and consider ever aspect of how streamer populations can affect a server?
---
That's pretty impressive.
---
Whoa buddy, don't want to look like a nationalist
---
Yet somehow we all managed to get by back in '04-'06.
---
I wonder why BMW was allowed to reserve their Shaman names before us: https://www.mueller-auto.com/picserver1/userdata/1/29619/VqkRDhdmBr/unbenannt-2.jpg
---
I prefer one night stands IRL and I much prefer classic in terms of wow
---
What’s cooler than a warlock? Summoning demons to do your bidding easy decision
---
Piccolo of the Flaming Fire. It interrupts node harvesting.
---
Yeah Im horde since the start but dabbled in ally a little back in the day.
---
Ally for SURE have the dopest questlines and zones with how the Westfall/Elwynn/Redridge &amp; Duskwood works. Astonishing really.
---
I googled ”vanilla wow playlist”. There was a lot. Tried any of them?
---
During which time the stress test will be available for us EU people?
---
If you're going Combat swords, you already get up to +5 swords/daggers from the weapon expertise talent.  That's the BIG breakpoint to hit, which gives you 3% hit back, so you only need to get 6% on your gear for yellow hits on mobs that are 3 levels above you.
---
Going human means you only spend 1 point in weapon expertise to get +8 swords.  But you really don't gain much except 1 point in poison or imp evis.  It's really not THAT big of a difference at that point.  The rogue talent revamp pretty much made every combat rogue a human or gave them +5 daggers.
---
Sure, if you get Maladath, you don't need to spend any points in weapon expertise, which means you get Riposte in your PvE spec.  But at the same point, you can just knock points out of imp poisons/evis on your assassination tree to get Riposte anyway.
---
Bottom line, Humans will have a SLIGHT edge, but it's not like you can't make it up with talents/gear on other races as well.  If you're planning to do a mix of PvP, I'd go Dwarf for Stoneform just for the Rogue and warrior match ups. Stoneform helps as well in AQ raiding, also helps in ZG.  Just in general being able to cleanse bleed/poison/disease from yourself too is great.
---
lul? Ahh you're one of those...
---
You will waste hours and hours without a single reward that is how classic works and why the rewards feel good.
---
But, I've acknowledged this over and over and over and over. I understand and agree that leveling in Classic is more impactful and meaningful.
---
I literally ONLY said that at 60 the 1-59 content becomes irrelevant in terms of gear. Because it 100% does.
---
As opposed to a salami sub? This is wow, you need to pay wow monies to play it.
---
"You" as in the third person. God...
---
Fuck man, I feel like that’s a hard perk to say no to. I believe there is a skill in the combat tree that raises weapon skill by a maximum of +5, so are there diminishing returns for that high of a weapon skill or does the benefit remain constant? I would prefer night elf for the uniqueness factor, but if I’m doing consistently lower dps I’d be pissed.
---
All rogues get +5 swords and +5 daggers in the combat tree through weapon expertise.  Both swords and daggers are equally viable.
---
Doing God's work friend.
---
Undercity looks like trash. It's so closed and small and the textures look horrid
---
One of my favorite moments in wow was the first time i was able to solo one of the ghoul rooms as a frost mage.
---
I remember saying "watch this" and the whole group went "oh no". But I jumped up onto the railing and kept casting nova/blizzard until they were all dead leaving just the boss untouched.
---
It was epic!
---
There will be PLENTY of people on PVE servers.
---
I broke 2 Nagas in the span of 2 years, and that was back when their build quality was a bit better. My G600 has been going strong for almost 5 years now.
---
11am PDT stress test, 3PM PDT name reservations
---
Warrior (tank)
---
Druid (heal)
---
Rogue
---
Then one person yet to decide.
---
Seems fairly balanced, all experienced dungeon levellers from vanilla. Mage to portal/AOE/CC. Rogue for single target. Experienced tank/healer combo with years of Warr/Dru playtime. The undecided will likely be meme spec or Hunter (hard to gauge).
---
So what you're saying is, its all about how you use it and not so much the size?
---
Yeah, but casters might as well be butter. They will die before getting a spell off to the hunter pet alone.
---
Ok guys real talk - what is the best “warm body” class?
---
I work a shitload so all I want to do when I get home is smoke bowls and kill murlocs. I am reasonably competent when faded so I can probably drop AoE and casual heals in dungeons, but certainly in no position to do complicated tasks like pull aggro or drop tank heals reliably. 
---
Basically, I can do stuff but don’t rely on me to do anything other than be on time and stay alive. Aka a warm body. 
---
What say you, classicwow? In my head I was thinking NE Druid.
---
Which people are you talking about? Do you mean everyone that will play classic? Because that's what I'm talking about.
---
If you're talking about the "average" hardcore raider, mythic+ runner, or person who's stuck it out on a private server for years, then literally what's your point? Obviously people improve with practice.
---
PVE can be even worse because since the enemy can’t attack you, they attack quest givers and flight masters, which will also slow you down a lot.  Also, get ready for the /spit tickle fights to replace actual fighting.  
---
Usually people just kill you and move on.  A true griefer is pretty rare and just a chance to take a break or work on your bank/profession alt.  Or play druid which is very hard to camp.
---
Bro I'll be honest I'm just gonna jam Pissy pamper by Playboi Carti on repeat.
---
If you haven't heard it, it's like God is speaking through Carti to us. Truly immaculate.
---
I've already said, agree to disagree. This is why I said people seem to really dislike me not agreeing with them. :) You apparently can't accept that I disagree, and are concerned with whether I've met some undefinable measure of "considering every aspect". Have you fully considered every aspect in coming to your conclusion that streamers will ruin everyone's experience?
---
I don't actually need an answer, because this is where I'm exiting the conversation. There's really no point in continuing.
---
Can anyone confirm if Leatrix plus (the alternative to lazypig that people were using on beta) dismounts you like lazy pig does when you use abilties or will we need to download another addon for that.
---

I have never once played WoW, always wanted to but never really got around to it. Have never really had any motivation to play BFA, but have ALWAYS wanted to play vanilla and was kicking my self for not giving it a go back in ‘05-‘06. I don’t really know what to play or what to do lol. All I know is I am really interested in both PvE &amp; PvP. I have always been drawn to high DPS in all mmo’s. What would you recommend a newbie like my self to play? Any tips? I do not know anyone who plays WoW so I don’t really know who ask but you all. Any tips/recommendations would be GREATLY appreciated.

Ps. Any “preparation”/informational videos that any of you could recommend thatI could watch to bring myself up to speed would be awesome!
---
Mind Control, obviously.
---
Those are the icons for the dwarf and undead races in the character creator. If your friend is going Alliance he won't be able to play as undead.
---
Let the bodies hit the floor, was the only song anyone used in wow videos.
---
Im sorry but where exactly did you learn to comment like this? Please reqd fully before commenting as this can cause you to look like a count. Not like we have a ton of that already but.. every lil count counts.
---
The respec cost is an essential gold sink in the game.  They should not add dual spec for that reason alone.
---
Whatever keybinds your comfortable with works best, it really depends on what your okay with pressing I know this is kind of weird but I keep my cooldowns on the f-keys (f1-4)
---
Soo the guy that’s asking if u need a mouse you don’t unless it’s pvp where your reaction time really matters so 👍
---
People will reject any change, this one in particular due to its added convenience and the fact it lowers the impact of your choices, or the identity of your character as a frost mage, or a protection warrior, etc.
---
I truly hope you're right.
---
Gnomes are the only reason I played alliance
---
But Night Elves
---
Probably slower but damn did I make money doing it. Grinded 20-45 (rogue), had 145g when I hit 40 even after buying lots from AH. Plan to do it again.
---
I can remember the death sound of almost any alliance races.
---
Thinking I'll eventually be the cause of it makes me wonder...
---
What if my inner demon is a dancing female night elve?
---
They want a “real” experience without any help
---
It is great, the problem is that in PVE it is almost always better to just keep windfury totem down for all situations, making grounding totem that is always used on CD in pvp almost obsolete in PVE.  I remember loving ST and RFD because I actually got to use some of my totems like grounding on all the spell casters, or tremor having some kind of use.  Otherwise, I was mindlessly the WF guy and if we were pulling back another back or two I could spend mana and globals laying mana spring and strength of earth.  Those exceptions from the rule were still group content and took a break from leveling to do dungeons (horrible xp per hour back then from all the wipes and healers without water).  After you run ST once, you usually were not going back to cast a lot of grounding totems unless you didn't have the right level of players to run blackrock or plaguelands instances.
---
That's the thing though, this is the pointy end of the min/max stick we're talking about here.  Any joe schmoe average guild isn't going to be doing this.  They'll probably get all world buffed up and die on Vael in BWL.
---
Don't get me wrong, all these private server guys are going to sperg out for all this shit.  But it is by no means required.  There are also implications of the 6 hour Onyxia/Nef head windows where you could start to raid, but realize you can't drop your head for the buff.  So guilds start pre-stacking buffs and logging out to save them.
---
While some say that you're wasting a character logging out, but these people probably have 1+ level 60 alts anyway that they can log on and play/gear out while their main sits with buffs logged out.
---
&gt;  As I think you need 1800 elemental kills for this?
---
Sounds about right, but you're forgetting it can be done in a 5 man group, so it shouldn't take more than a couple hours depending on respawns and how contested the area is.
---
If you send your first 58+ 5 man group (remember only 4 people need quintessence, not the 7 you suggested) down to farm them, they'll be done before the last guys you need hit 60.
---
Is farming SM profitable?
---
See I dont have this problem because I am the tank muhahahaha.
---
I definitely get how people would like alliance cities more, but people get so hyperbolic about the negatives of horde cities.
---
TB is amazing. Org has great music and is easy to navigate (plus I think it has the feeling of an orc warcamp that just kept filling out a canyon, and that's dope!)
---
But fuck undercity. I agree with all the UC hate.
---
Gotta have the true vanilla experience ofc.
---
Yea I keep coming back to mage, can't help feeling a ret pala is just going to be running around auto attacking stuff.
---
What would be the least gear dependant dps class/spec that's good for solo play focusing on pvp?
---
Lots of good stuff on Youtube. 
---
If it's your first time you may want to go hunter. Can always change after you have learnt more about the game.
---
Yes it's on willitclassic.com
---
I prefer the stink of cow shit over rotten flesh.
---
John just told me, to tell you to get BACK TO WORK!
---
I'll be playing a nelf druid. Can't decide between leatherworking or alchemy, tho. 
---
I don't plan to have alts, so I want something that could benefit me until later phases. 
---
Alchemy is the safest choice, but it looks like a lot of people are going alchemy or engineering. I think there's room to get some burst of gold whenever a raid with resistance requirement gets released and I assume people will need gear for alts after a few years and many would switch their BS/Leatherworking/Tailoring by then.
---
That's what I was thinking too.  I'm thinking my last few levels are not so much going to be grinding quests but finishing up my Onyxia attunement in BRD (and getting gear) and grinding Hydraxian rep.
---
But why only 4 waters? I thought there were 7 runes to douse?  Or do you just keep summoning them back and forth to get another water?  I'll be honest, when we were clearing MC I was never on water duty, so I just knew about it but never looked into the requirements to get it.
---
QoL changes - yes.
---
Spawn times and health regen are not QoL, they are gameplay changes.
---
Google is your friend.
---
I’m torn between 3 classes - Paladin, Warrior &amp; Mage.
---
I have 2 goals in classic:
---
I want to tank. I want to tank all instances while levelling and I want to be able to tank level 60 dungeons. I don’t think I’ll have the time commitment to tank Raids, although I am flirting with the idea of starting a casual guild where I could be the MT.
---
I want to make a PvP video. I know it might sound silly, but I used to love watching peoples PvP videos through vanilla and TBC. I always wanted to make one myself but never had a computer capable of running wow smoothly while recording. Now I do.
---
Paladin sounds great because it has high survivability, can tank dungeons, and seems like a good solo play class. But it consists of primarily auto attacking and while I’m fine with healing raids, I want to do damage in PVP and not heal. I really like the Zalgradis PvP video, and that war by attrition style looks so intriguing, but his videos were also on earlier patches and from what I’ve read that play style doesn’t really exist in 1.12.
---
Warrior sounds great because I can tank everything, and once I get a good weapon I should tear people up in PvP. But, it’s not a great solo play class. I’m fine with that when it comes to levelling, since I’ll manage and I’ll also be doing dungeons whenever I can. I’m not fine with it when I’m going to be out in the world solo farming and keep getting stomped in world PvP.
---
Mage sounds great because its one of the best solo play classes and its also desired in dungeons for vending machine purposes + polymorph. They’re also fantastic in world, organized, and solo PvP. But I can’t tank as a mage. So I lose out on that.
---
**Some questions:**
---
How hard is it to get into groups as a mage? I like the idea of tanking partly because as soon as I log in I can quickly assemble a group as a tank, since DPS is dime a dozen, and then I’m just waiting on a healer.
---
For people who played paladin back in the day, did you find PvP fights boring? Was it really just sitting around not pressing anything? Or are there things to think about and spells to cast despite the fact that there aren’t a lot of offensive abilities? Also, did you ever get shit for being a paladin tank? Or struggle with something where a warrior wouldn’t have?
---
Are warriors as bad out in the world as people make them out to be? Monkeynews on youtube has a video of him where only pre raid BiS gear and doing pretty good in world and battleground PvP. Is that just private server BS or is the class not actually all that bad solo?
---
This is exactly why I love classic. 3 completely separate choices that will have wildly different play styles. Each one of them has something the other doesn’t, and I constantly get pulled between the three of them. Aug 26 can’t get here soon enough.
---
my dad and I both quit our jobs lol
---
Personally, I've always thought the respect cost was too much. Even when I played in vanilla the first time around. People like to make the argument that your spec is your character, except it's really not. If you want to PvP with a hardcore group, you HAVE to have a PvP build. If you want to PvE with a raiding guild, you HAVE to have a raid build. This means you will be respecing. a lot.
---
On principle, I agree that the game shouldn't be changed and should be brought back pure. Personally, however, I've always thought the 50g was way to much - including when I played in vanilla the first time. I was farming constantly to switch between PvE and PvP and it sucked. I think a happy medium would be like 25g max instead of 50g.
---
Either way, it's a pain, but it's part of classic. Let's keep it classic.
---
He's a normal sized man in a gigantic suit of armour... with a big bobble head I guess.
---
Why semantics? It's a QoL and it's a change.
---
I feel so 2017 in this thread.
---
well, fuck. guess I can look for an add-on to block them.
---

Why would I see this? I'm going to be busy playing, not browsing r/wow
---
God damn it this is the kind of shit I miss from vanilla.
---
Champion! Go forth and do this quest Champion! I awaited you’re return Champion! Good job Champions! See you next week for tea at the maelstrom Champions!
---
Tell me again who’s the hero in WoW? Lol
---
&gt;should I choose another class so there's less cloth users?
---
If your goal in the game is to get drops while leveling? Great idea!
---
If your goal in the game is to play a Warlock? Terrbile idea.
---
Im Thex!
---
Heart of the Wild is one of the strongest talents in the game for any class and you would be massively gimping yourself if you wasted points in other trees before attaining 5/5 in this.  Feline Swiftness is a necessary deviation from your tanking talents, and the bonus to armor talent can be grabbed later.
---
People have their own reasons but the history of game gives the real reason. People congregated in IF and ogrimmar bc they were the only capital cities with AHs in them. Yes AH were opened elsewhere after but precedent was already set. This is the truth. Your reason although good is not the truth. I'm sorry but just because it makes sense doesn't make it true. Personally I'll be in SW more in classic trying to grab that Dragonslayer buff.
---
I see Josh, I updoot
---
That will get your account banned
---
I'm assuming you need an active subscription to reserve names?
---
Perfect song for this 😂😂
---
Im aiming for realm first 60, and im not gonna do any dungeons so i guess im doing that "challenge" already
---
305 is the sweet spot for dps. 307 is best. And anything after that is pretty negligible. 
---
There's a talent for hit chance, which is great, 5% free hit. And there's also a talent for improved mace weapon skill, but not improved sword weapon skill. So you will still suffer a large glancing penalty.
---
Swords are the best for maximizing dps with sword specialization. 
---
Take a look at this page if you want a detailed rundown on weapon skill testing. 
---
https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table#officially-confirmed-by-blizzard
---
No changes
---
Vanish... You know, being able to control minds or res might be useful.
---
But all I wana be able to do is dip unseen when GF aggro happens or theres something I dont feel like dealing with at work.
---
Summon succubus 😅
---
It's really overwhelming looking at all of these add-ons as someone who is coming back to the game after basically 13 years. I think I might just level without add-ons and slowly but surely figure them out as time goes by.
---
Happy cake day thanks for the funny crossover :)
---
I think with Discord, it's going to be MUCH easier to find/form groups.
---
Go to the #LFGdungeon  channel, "LFM _______ voice channel X", get your people in voice channel, group up without having to hit up a main city.
---
Hell, for the most part you could just park your ass at Light's Hope and do Strath/Scholo runs without every going back to IF.  Just send materials/gold to your bank alt to deal with IF trades.
---
Complaining or arguing.
---
I can't remember ever being kicked from a Vanilla group/raid.
---
It's a QoL change for sure. People can swap from PvE to PvP specs, hybrids can swap to a DPS tree to actually farm stuff for themselves etc.
---
Do I want it in Classic? If it came for a 1k gold price maybe. *shrug*
---
Until that happens, I'll settle for making a Hunter alt to farm everything I need.
---
Because they will use the same form after the game is released.
---
No, yes
---
Oh lawd!!
---
do you play with game sounds?  the female 'getting hit/crit' sound is pretty annoying.  they look terrible at low levels but kinda cool later on, but i think out of the taurens male still looks better
---
i would actually suggest considering female troll shaman, i really love their animations especially with 2h maces.  it feels very shaman-appropriate
---
This guy roleplays
---
Honestly... It's flipped now to me. Alliance are the underdogs.
---
I think you should read it again. I did not say Ogrimmar was deserted at all. Also it’s humidity is not due to its population, but just ogrimmar’s architecture. It’s predominantly reddish and has fires and braziers that gives out smoke everywhere. Not to mention it’s in a desert territory.
---
true. I just wanted a better looking troll.
---
its just the new generations ways to say "cool / woot / epic / awesome / tubular / righteous" ...
---
Just a random comment: I was jealous for years that I couldn't be a goblin. Like, all throughout vanilla I wanted to have been able to roll goblin rogue, damn it. And when they finally added them, the rest of the game was a shell of itself :(
---
Yes it is.  That 1k gold is 10weeks of respecting if you do it twice a week.
---
They aren't doing it, your bad math doesn't help your argument.
---
Feral druid
---
Enh shaman
---
Warrior tank
---
Frost mage 
---
Holy priest
---
Forgot the cannon from strat live. The one that drops off the canon master that you can put down and fires at people.
---
That is what ignore is for.
---
I'm gonna come back to the murloc village when I'm lvl 60 and go Anakin Skywalker on those fuckers.
---
Random party chat.
---
I had one upon entering the dungeon with rando's:
---
/p If you accidentally aggro, run to Bart.  He taunts on command.
---
Bart was my bear and was a good off tank.  Named after [Bart](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1075976/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1).
---
Hey buddy, my GM has a friend that's doing the same kinda thing for CST (it's like a mix of CST and EST guilds) would you be interested? 
---
We've got a spreadsheet of horde and alliance guilds on board - I'll add you on discord!
---
Mage. Because it was the *intellectual* choice.
---
We've got a spreadsheet of horde and alliance guilds on board
---
This is why you just ignore levelling dungeons unless you have a premade. It's generally quicker.
---
&gt; even the gloomy Duskwood is amazing
---
"even"
---
Hey, our group is looking for a priest to join our dungeon group, we have 3 warriors and 1 paladin and are going to play for 20 on 6 off for the first week or until 60.  Comment below or message Hideki#7399 on discord to apply, thanks!
---
Perhaps when all the patches are done in classic and if they choose to expand the game they can place a similar system to runescape where a super majority votes in certain features proposed by the community/devs. 
---
That way meaningful enhancements can be made like dual spec only IF the majority of the community wants it once classic has eventually concluded?
---
Wow that's great to know. Does it do it for opposing faction?
---
Polymorph
---
i have this exact problem.  have also played dwarf quite a bit, and nelf almost never.  the reason i chose hunter is because i have played it so much less than other classes too
---
dwarf voice lines are the best by far, and their animations are cooler than nelf ... but as you say, nelf looks better in gear and feels more fitting.  plus the starting zone is so god damn gorgeous
---
i think i'm going with nelf because it's less familiar.  i know i'm gonna regret it when i get blinded by a rogue but shadowmeld tricks should be fun
---
how does a streamer impact the factions economy?
---
'Questing' ' Enjoyable' yikes haha. From what I remember the alliance route felt a little more fluid. I hated the entire leveling experience in Vanilla however, so you can take that with a grain of salt. Regardless, I remember running out of quests around ~55 and just having to grind it out.
---
but you do need 40 onyxia scale cloaks to kill nefarian.
---
Not that we should really care, but they will do it while playing Classic, not on Reddit.
---
Alliance quests seem to require a lot more running around when I played compared to Horde quests.
---
&gt;How hard is it to get into groups as a mage?
---
not that hard at low level since everyone and their mother wants a mage for cc but since a lot of player plays mage you might have trouble when raiding for a spot.
---
&gt;  Are warriors as bad out in the world as people make them out to be? 
---
meh not really they are really bad from 1-30 then they become a really good class. (beserk stance/whirlwind axe I think)
---
This is a great way to create drama too go figuring out which guilds tank gets that first binding :)
---
Yes, you must have an active subscription to reserve up to 3 names per account, not server. No name reservations can be made without a subscription.
---
Plus, Rogue has stealth and once you go stealth, it's hard to go back. So useful in wPvP
---
My God. From Kevin Jordan to Thex, Josh knows how to please the people!
---
Retail bad 
---
Classic good
---
Really? I truthfully get 60+ np. I even main tank some raids.
---
&gt;be a bit of an asshole?
---
\^\^ camped by premades on 60 bgs and calling those who cooridnate games for competitive 10v10 premades outside 60 bracket
---
braindead777, seems you really dont have any experience with lategamepvp grind of vanilla back on retail 14-15years ago so you better start preparing your mindset for that
---
Hiding behind twinking and denying the reality? So reality is coordinated guild vs guild bis-twinks. That is totally one side stomping levelers ofc. Have a nice day, you will suffer a lot in Classic :) we love you
---
Yea, fuck that shit. I'm gonna stock up on em jungle remedies.
---
Reduce carb intake, increase protein and healthy fats, like nuts and avocados. Throw in some fruits like bananas and apples in the morning (or wake up time). Reduce caffeine intake (some will argue, but whatevs) increase water intake. When you start to feel a bit of fatigue do 5-10 push-ups or anything to increase blood flow and it'll wake you up better than coffee.
---
Yeah but you can shift click them and see that they are level 3
---
Prude
---
It shouldn't be possible to re-create anything like focus frames, because the most vital element of the focus frame: the ability to target someone based on said frame (be it with a macro like /target focus) will not be possible in the 'new API' in any way whatsoever.
---
Your neighbor who became your neighbor because he killed the previous owner of the house while on a drug rampage
---
start a week after. pff
---
Just looked it up, I could've sworn only the non-"naga" bosses had runes, apparently I was mistaken, apologies.
---
But yea, still probably not worth the time to have more than 5 people get it, you'll be summoning back and forth several times anyway.
---
Thanks for the input, this is really helpful. Didn't even consider Imp Thorns, but yes, Thorns are absolutely awesome for getting arggro and damage on Mobs.
---
I guess I'll drop the plans to get Furor before FFF.
---
This is absolutely not for PvP. I want to PvP as 8/12/31 Resto, which I will also use in Raids. But I figured that for Leveling I'd go a completely different route. Between 50 and 60 I'll just inform the Healer that I'll roll on Healer-Loot too.
---
Ironforge was the main city for a variety for a reasons and that includes close FP's to BRD/MC/BWL/Menethil also has a bank opposite from Auction house  and is also a lot closer to EPL/WPL also has BG arena masters the list goes on but I would be extremely surprised if SW or Dalaran became the new Home city. 
---
I should point out that for every vanilla pserver IF is still the main town and for TBC its still Shatt and WOTLK is still dalaran so I wouldnt worry about it.
---
Yeah, it's surprisingly really good. His comment really brought out the childhood nostalgia right there.
---
Name of the guide?
---
Same. My sub havet been active sin 2 months into bfa
---
Did you point the path to the correct folder? I have it working or at least I did during the beta. I can post a screenshot later if that would help.

Sunken Temple was the only dungeon that really unsettled me because of how labyrinthine it was

Avoid streamer servers.
---
I've been following all this quite closely but never saw that. Can you share a link?
---
You were tricked, you were backstabbed, and you were quite possibly, bamboozled.
---
No, I meant a city that has a desert climate.  It looks and feels very dry and hot to me.
---
Don't really see it overly valuable for my plans of leveling primarily in dungeons. Otherwise I'd agree.
---
I'm a female. That's the same reason all my characters are female.
---
&gt; That 1k gold is 10weeks of respecting if you do it twice a week.
---
And how much of the population do you think is doing this?
---
&gt; your bad math doesn't help your argument.
---
Please tell me where my math is bad.
---
mohawks don’t scream evil to me.
---
I was on Vek'nilash and it was even more stacked than Magtheridon (that housed Nihilum during that time).
---
We had Curse, SK, MYM(later became SK iirc), Sisu (I believe this is what became Paragon later), Chemical Rejects etc.
---
A bunch of dope ass guilds.
---
To each his own but personally I think dwarves are the most badass ally char
---
So what?  Just ignore the post or use filters for words like "models"
---
Of course!
---
https://youtu.be/unTcTXN-nnI
---
They level at similar speeds. You are right on the money about gear, as a priest its easier since the gear you naturally wear has int on it, whereas enhc shammys want str and agi when killing and int when healing. Otherwise shaman is super fun to play, I played both so I cant tell you one or the other, but I will say shaman are a treat if you are burned out on priest.
---
You don't have to buy expansions separately anymore as far as I know. You just buy the latest game + the sub,  or if you're just playing classic wow you only pay the sub, no buying the game required
---
He said he didnt want to derail the thread. He had already got the answers he needed, doesnt hurt to help somebody interested in bettering themselves.

Ktm
---
Onebag

Questie
---
Hunter timer
---
Thanks, tips; the obvious implication here was that neither of those classes are present in the group.
---
If I intend to spend most of my time leveling in Dungeons, I don't really see why I'd put so much priority into getting Feline Swiftness.
---
I also don't really see why I would respec into getting NS. Depending on whether BGs are out or not when I reach 60 I'll either go a 24/0/27 Moonglow-Resto-Build for Raid-Healing or 8/11/31 PvP-Resto. Don't really plan on going HotW-again, which I felt was a huge waste of talent-points for what I did in vanilla.
---
It was my favorite back in the day, too. It had the prefect eerie vibe after questing in the plaguelands.
---
I’ve been maining a human mage since psych 1.6 lol, yes I know how perception works. Even with the directionality limitation it helped me catch countless rogues… all you need for it to be useful is a vague notion of where the rogue may be or just dumb luck when hopping around.
---
And I’m not concerned at all with 1v1, all I really care for is battlegrounds. In that setting,, as said earlier, I wouldn’t engage. I’d just say you and let my teammates take it from there.
---
What was your method for making gold as a mage?
---
I lvled many characters and at some point I just stuck with Dwarf paladin. I loooooved Dun Morogh and just kept questing.
---
If anyone is wondering why, generally the old school trick was to go into game files and make all enemies some super bright pink texture and everything else muted. Makes them stand out like crazy and is a lot (was a lot) harder to detect than injected code for most games.
---
I can't remember which game (CS probably) but I used to do this as a teenager and it was super OP. In WoW I would have probably tried to break it down by enemey faction bright colour/class colours for BGs.
---
I didn't even know that that Burger King had lounges.
---
No new models
---
Unfortunately there there is no way to know. No one can predict the future. Only information you have before launch is what servers (most) streamers will be on and some hard core guilds. You can get an idea of realm "character" by waiting a few weeks after launch - but I am guessing you don't want to wait!
---
Good news is there isn't much difference between realms, you shouldn't have a bad experience on any of them. Some may have some bad inter-guild drama, or animosity from realm merging, but nothing too serious. I think the worst you can expect is being on a realm with a significant faction imbalance.
---
Anything is fine. A mouse and keyboard with extra/macro buttons is nice but for keybinding purposes, no modifier/Ctrl+/Shift+/Alt+ buttons really can cover a lot of keybinds. I see it as more of an economic/durability choice.
---
&gt; This will happen, and it happens the other way in retail too btw. The fact that you even bring this up probably means that you are one of those people. 
---
I haven't had a sub for like 5 years now.  Left right after I got the 10 year statue.  So I guess that blows your "probably" bullshit.
---
It's gonna be vanilla graphics, but there's options to turn the sliders up to have "better graphics" than vanilla. personally, I'd love to have retail graphics in classic, as a toggle of course
---
I'd say alchemy, because even if you don't MAKE gold with it, you'll definitely SAVE gold.  If you can collect 75% of what you need and only have to buy the remaining 25% of mats on the AH, you'll have saved a TON of gold over time.
---
LW, MIGHT make you some gold, but probably not as much as Alch will save you.
---
I guess you need to re-read the topic
---
Bland tank and spanks are more your speed, eh? Not everyone is cut out for active gameplay I suppose.
---
I'm not op and I'm not sure how much omen of clarity is supposed to proc but on priv server omen of clarity was soooo nice
---
I thought reddit is our friend... selling another platform on...
---
On the 27th, you log in and join or make a guild. Done.
---
Lights effect and such will have some newer options but the models will be the same. It will look like the old game.
---
There is a graffic option called "Classic" setting all option to how it was back in 06'. 
---
No new models.
---
Hey love the video, but you forgot to change the description and it reads "A brief guide on the lore of Uldaman..."
---
You cant download a server
---
For a long time I was set on female dwarf paladin, but now I'm wondering about Nelf male druid instead. I will heal in both cases. Interested in pve, pvp and general exploring (first time playing Classic). I'm torn, help!
---
Yeah I don’t like the feel or look of Darkshore but I’m 100% doing it anyway because the quest density is multiple times higher than the other two combined.
---
Is there any way to get all the following into one macro: 
---
Mouseover: switch to appropriate stance for charge/intercept and then charge/intercept + hamstring
---
Why is this they thing a meme
---
haha yep.  if only nelves had the male dwarf laugh voice line.  it sounds so cheeky
---
I can't sleep properly now it's getting bad.
---
We don’t even have a server list, so there is no way anything is shaping up to be a vibrant community. This won’t happen until after launch, so you can’t really know ahead of time
---
Thank you!
---
Oh snap does it?! I didn't know that you had a 50 character limit on retail. Thanks for clearing that up, I was thinking that 5 servers was pretty low considering time zone needa.
---
It's deleted.  Was it Thex?  I bet it was Thex.
---
Yes they will. It'll be patch 1.12, it's not starting from the release build.
---
For me, Vanilla leveling is boring at the get go. After a few levels, everybody has more abilities to work with, this is when the pvp danger starts to arise. This will force you to play a bit more actively just to stay alive and continue leveling. The end game is more satisfying since it takes more effort to even get to your raids or dungeons. I think they tried to smooth out all the un-fun parts of wow in the progression to current retail, making it all meaningless.
---
It's a shame, George is so hot I can't wait to play with him!
---
Ironforge was never the main city..
---
Sure alot of people hang out there due to fast access from ah to bank and mailbox. 
---
But stormwind is the main city where people meet up to buff ony head before raid.
---
THEX
---
Haha, it sounds so easy! But where Am I logging in to? What's your plan? :)
---
We won't be getting ZG for over a year :(
---
I think dwarfs and gnomes compliment each other quite well. More so than any other two races in the game. They both have a very strong PVP racial, they share the same starting zone, the same capital, and they get along very well
---
Yeah, it's really bad form because a lot of the time it can kill the group, too. Unfortunately, I may miss out on a lot of leveling dungeons because of time constraints and not wanting to be that guy :(
---
**BACKGROUND:**
---
I main Enhance/Resto and Shadow/Disc on retail and never got to experience Classic. (Started in Wrath) Would love to experience the classic xpac with one of these mains but cant really decide. 
---
**GOAL:** I realize unlike retail, Classic is normally choose a spec and stick to it because respecing can get expensive. But I mainly want to heal in PvE and dps in BGs. Is this possible with either class?
---
**CURRENT DECISION:** If the servers opened up now, I would most likely go with Priest as I am having fun with Shadow/Disc in retail.
---
Im a pocket shaman; I'll heal for days. Yours is a good response.
---
Don't worry I think I only did the whole thing twice, pre-BC. Too many people who only be willing to do certain "wings" for their quests, which I don't blame them
---
+1 for baked Shaman
---
Dual spec will make even more people goes warrior, they can raid and rank pvp at the same spec just different weapons maybe some gears
---
Yup. Just be a cool person in dungeons so that you get friended and invites. Also, friend people who you like and let them know you thought they played well. If you're not an impatient jerk who 'me me mes' the whole time, you will be getting whispers for groups constantly.   
---
Remember classic is LONG and the players are not disposable - so treat everyone like you will see them again.
---
I don't understand why this seems like a foreign concept to so many people. Shinier doesn't automatically mean better, especially if you're talking about a shiny high-poly character model in an old-school lower-poly world. It just looks jarring, definitely another thing that annoys me about retail, it's such a mishmash of model resolutions and things that it just looks haphazard (some zones noticeably worse than others). The "every expansion needs to be shinier than the last" design philosophy was honestly a mistake, especially when you consider how many great-looking indie games have retro graphics and stuff.
---
*rant rant rant*
---
Your english is basically perfect.
---
A native speaker would probably say "should I be concerned about *this*?" rather than *it*. Or they might say "Is this something I should be concerned about?" 
---
That's really nitpicky grammar though.
---
In terms of wow speak, people usually say they are "playing" a class, rather than "using" a class.
---
Anyways like I said your english is amazing for a non-native speaker
---
Yeah I am leaving all my friends behind for the most part. 😂
---
This is why I'm spending most of my time on IF as horde!
---
Yeah since TBC the player character powerlevels are off the fucking charts. Like the player character themselves should have been given faction leadership a long time ago. Groups of player Characters are stronger than entire faction leader groups by a large margin.
---
I found especially the legion storyline, like we basically defeat an old god and wield so much power.
---
I really hope the lvl squish coming next expansion goes along way to killing the players power and making the factions (or probably just one faction next expansion) way more powerful. 
---
I think if the idea is right that the player character dies (likely is a sacrifice) at the end of BFA they get sent to the shadowlands and squished to level 50. Fight you way out of the shadowlands to be 'rebirthed' as a 60 character but not nearly the god-level tier you where before (makes sense in-lore for lvl squish as you are half of what you were).
---
Sodapoppin and asmond will be the big ones.  There will be others but to a much lesser extent.
---
You're never using arcane shot and sting due to shared AS cooldown and debuff spots anyway. Also i'm interested in seeing the endgame agility stacking potential and switch into lightning reflexes.
---
Because retail treats dungeons as just a short, small event. In Classic, a dungeon while leveling is considered a massive event with huge investment cost. Difference in philosophy and thats why Classic dungeons are more fun. Look, nothings perfect, each design has its drawbacks. Retail is a quick hitting short dose of instant gratification. Classic is a slow buildup to an eventual release.
---
I played warrior in vanilla and I did this all the time, even without dual spec.
---
It's also punching down if you're insulting people for not knowing boss fights in World of Warcraft but you seem to have no problem with that
---
Level 3? You overestimate their resolve.
---
But the centaurs in retail are beautiful.
---
Where you log in to depends on the race you pick. Each race has a different starting zone.
---
I plan on dual leveling rogues with a friend for the ganking, stop I'll just join the first guild that invites us
---
I only recall 2 ban waves ever being sent out for people modifying aesthetics. One of them recently, since people were modyfing the WSG flag to be gigantic etc. Then everyone with modified files got banned for 3+ months. Regardless of wether they were cheating. 
---
So it's a risk. Yeah.
---
It's "Alenya and Umbra" on Patreon.
---
The guide is paid and Alliance only but my personal testing tells me it's worth the buck.
---
&gt; The active player base that has the most effect on the economy will be doing it.
---
They are also already either
---
A. just stacking up gold in their wallets, in which case them not having to pay for a respec changes literally nothing
---
or 
---
B. Generating gold to pay for these respecs, in which case them not having to pay for respecs will cause less gold to enter the economy in the first palce.
---
&gt; Your math is bad because the people that won't pay to respec also won't save up 1k gold
---
I honestly find it kind of hilarious how you're dismissing me having "bad math" you're being simply because I questioned your assertion made without having access to the required data to make it.
---
So let me ask you a question you should be able to answer in order to make your initial assertion:
---
What would dual spec have to cost in order for it to be a gold neutral change?
---
I watched the opening cinematic and was amazed at the human mage, so that's what I made. They made the frost nova and fireballs look so damn cool.
---
Far be it from me to criticize how anyone wants to play a video game....
---
Having said that I think twinking out a character at the top of a level bracket w/ the best BoE gear you can buy off the AH to beat up on regular players casually running BGs for fun while leveling is for giant pussies.
---
If we're talking PvP, ret gets fucked without gear. The class has so little control that you get completely fucked without the ability to soak damage.
---
Good job circling back around once the votes died down, just like i knew a big bitch like you would, lmao
---
Eh, something to look forward to!
---
I played vanilla and can confirm omen of clarity rocks.
---
Anyone know if the server list will come with information regarding the server's physical location (Like what state/region in the US it's in)
---
As far as i remember, you only need like one or two people to douse. If you use the douse, get summoned to the place you pick it up, pick up a new one and gets summoned back, you avoid the cd on it.
---
Adblock dawg
---
Yeah I was. That was hilariously efficient. Priest was way better, but damn if there was still a lot of running around
---
Leveling, tanks always have the easiest time finding groups.   
---
Raiding, mages are wanted because people like to stack mages.
---
Yeah I think annihilator debuff lasts much longer than nightfall though. Nightfall is like a 5-6 second debuff which is why you need a hunter/Paladin applying the debuff the whole time. Problem with shaman applying the debuff is they have no extra way to put the debuff on- hunters have wingclip, paladins have judgement. Yeah shamans have wf but that doesn’t reliably do it. 
---
Best way to keep annihilator debuff up is get three quick stacks and just have your tank swap his weapon when debuff is getting close to falling off. I’m pretty sure annihilator lasts like 30-45 seconds
---
Were you wanting advice or not?
---
You said smooth cat outdoor leveling, yet don’t want the most important talent for questing. You already have your 60 builds ready, and have an irrational hatred towards HOTW which is an incredible talent that scales extremely well, unlike Gift of Nature which doesn’t scale in the deeper Resto builds, and don’t seem to want feral charge for some reason which is one of your best abilities in PvP. 
---
Do what you want, but you don’t seem like you actually want advice
---
It's not *super* important but I would really like it. It was the name my current main had when I first made the character. My RL friends eventually convinced me to faction and server change to play with them but my name was taken so I had to change it to a slight variation on my original name. I'd like to have that name back. Tomorrow is pay day, we'll see how I feel.
---
how dare you
---
I'm a troll shaman named Thex
---
Certainly needed if you play shaman
---
But you have heard of the thing called 'layering'? 5 servers per Region is not that unrealistic.
---
There are no real classic communities yet.
---
There is the classic wow reddit communitie, wich is so big its not really a communitie.
---
There are private server players. Where all the bigboys are already together and has been together for years now.
---
And there are some small communities in the form of pre-made guilds before release.
---
You could join a guild and get to know the people in there. Or you can wait untill the game is out, pick a random realm and see how that server develops.
---
Right now there arn't many communities to join. The game isn't out yet.
---
How would you do that to show charge/intercept when in/out of combat?
---
I did this last time and I got a 4 hour old pizza - not a fan.
---
I main'ed a holy priest during Vanilla. Questing/killing things was obviously slower than shadow, but it wasn't to the point where I felt like I "needed" to respec every time I decided to quest/farm.
---
I made plenty of gold selling mats, unlocking UBRS, or healing for groups that I never really went shadow. And when I did I had enough gold to cover the respec costs anyway.
---
Don’t forget get the paladins 30% reduced threat buff. Enabling classes like warlocks to hit harder and not having to worry about threat as much.
---
Not really, anything like that you should be able to just buy.
---
From my personal/anecdotal experience at the tail end of Vanilla/start of BC:
---
The Alliance were mostly kids enthralled with the idea of being heroes vanquishing monsters. Additionally, alliance races simply looked better.
---
Horde players were mostly adults just looking to chill and kill after work, and enjoyed the more mature crowd via ventrilo/teamspeak.
---
The lines between the horde adults and alliance kids blurred when Blood Elves became the first sexy race on the Horde side. 
---
Granted, I was like 13 at the time and played horde because Tauren looked so powerful. Most of my recollection on the alliance/horde distribution came from my GM, and probably isn’t the most statistically accurate.
---
I’d say the difference now is that Blizzard is less about showing both factions as equals and has for several expansions made the horde out to be villains. As if the alliance could do no wrong being led by a 16yr old boy king.
---
Sure, there was Arthas. But arthas changed from Alliance to Lich King, and is less associated with the alliance than the scourge at this point.
---
Garrosh and Sylvanas not only (intentionally or not) got King Varian killed, but also committed multiple (unsupported by the player base) genocides while flying the horde banner and continuing to claim the Warchief title. Horde can’t catch a lore break, and there’s nothing we as players can do about it. It’s been since WotLK since horde could really be proud of their faction.
---
So hordies hate the alliance because Blizzard isn’t shitting on them continuously (maybe a little squirt here and there), and alliance players get all the cannon rights to call hordies genocide supporting assholes, which horde players get no say in.
---
I hope Anduin makes some unjustified immature stupid 16yr old hormone infused mistakes at some point so the alliance can be brought down a notch, but Blizzard doesn’t want to sea with their tears.
---
If the horde is elevated through good deeds to the alliance level, then there will be no more use in different factions. There needs to be conflict for factions to have meaning, and if the alliance can do no wrong then Horde HAVE to be villains.
---
Cant you re-roll the powers? I havent done it yet so i could be wrong. I guess i just like the abilities and perks that comes in them, maybe there is bigger flaws to it than the face value i am seeing. Still fairly new to BFA so I dont have the long standing play time of it to see the consequences of them yet.
---
I am tall and I am still not important, so this myth is debunked.
---
Layering is a temporary solution. 
---
Server A has a max of 5000 concurrent players and Server A max player count of 50,000. 25,000 players are logged into Server A this means that Server A has spooled up 5 Layers of 5000 players each, all playing on their own continent. An additional 500 people login to Server A, Layer #6 opens and now has 500/5000 players on it.
---
Launch:
---
Layer 1-10 is full on Server A. Player X on Layer #5 is competing with 5000 people to kill boars just like Player Y on Layer #10 is competing with 5000 people to kill those boars. Layering does not make it easier (in theory) to avoid other players. Sharding does, Sharding will not be present at the launch of Calssic.
---
Weeks/Months after launch: Layering Disabled
---
Given your scenario of 5 Servers at launch. Servers A to E have a capacity of 500,000 players total. 1 Million active players are playing at this point. Where do you go from there? In Server A they now have 100,000 users and only 5000 spots for that server, you'll be looking at daily queues of 1-2 hours for almost all players on Server A if a significant amount of those 100,000 players login daily. Without layering the servers hold a very limited number of concurrent players (as was the intent in Vanilla).
---
Go look at the numbers just for NA east/west players. A single PvP server in those regions will literally be impossible when layering is in. With 5 Servers across NA you're talking like 15-25K active concurrent available spots in that server pool for probably 250-500K people. Those numbers just don't add up.
---
There's a PALS post on the LS Alliance forums along with a few other folks (some from Spite, DV, DC, etc.). LS Horde was dead, last I checked.
---
Search for Yaht (yet another hunter timer). Its the best imo.
---
Vanish into ambush at the end of your adrenaline rush, or when you start getting high on threat.
---
Have you done raids in Vanilla, it's only gear checks and resist farming.    You are aware there's no real level 60 dungeons? They were designed for level 50-58. Maybe Scholo is still a little challenging but dungeons are not the end-game content.  
---
Don't rush leveling. It's the best part of the game and content is very slim in Vanilla.
---
The blue post saying when it starts also says when it ends.
---
Looks like I’ll be doing the same with pally main and mage alt. I want to tank with a paladin as well and I’ve been reading up on it a lot, I think it’ll work well if you commit to it. Definitely rushing consecrate and leveling eng for ranged pulls
---
I mean I've never dinged 60 on a priest but as far as I know there's nothing you need to kill as a priest outside of the benediction quest. At least as a druid I never actually needed to kill anything, I just grouped with people for my attunements and everything
---
Enhancement is considered a bit of a meme in PvE. The dps isn't that great, you're mostly a hybrid support role and totem twister.    
---
Yes you can PvP and PvE with similar specs as enhancement, but it's not as good as the 30/0/21 spec.
---
Did someone order extra sausage?
---
Sounds cool, i was thinking of main ranking raids tho.
---
Yeah i just actually ran into this issue last night. I need level 60 azerite in order to fully unlock 2 pieces I received. Really sucks but if I do grind it, they each will be 5 ilvl higher, so kinda makes it worth it. 
---
I guess i more  meant the perks/abilities within them that are fun to tinker with. I like the essences as well, just hit 55 on my azerite neck so i unlocked a minor which makes me have some more utility. But locking high end bonuses behind it is a little bit weird, you got the high end gear from completing the high end content but if you did not grind correctly, you dont unlock the full magnitude of that piece. But i guess it gives me something to grind towards.
---
I would rather see more AQ 20-level gear but with different tier set bonuses, allowing more specs to be viable.
---
improved revive pet my dude
---
Wouldnt mind playing on same server as hydra.  Great guy. Great pvper.  Im sure he would make the battlegroup fun.
---
Yeah but if numbers are pulled out of your ass they are useless.
---
The reasoning isn't bad, but without actual numbers we can't say if that's the case.
---
Does anyone have video of this? I've never played beyond TBC for very long.
---
It would actually be your neighbour who picked a fight with your neighbour two houses down because a loved one tricked him into taking a drug that caused him to go on a rampage. 
---
Who then got his ass kicked in and ran away to become your neighbour.
---
10 hours. Some players fun is ganking low level areas.
---
Those same people will get their asses handed to them when they hit max level and join BGs.
---
The really simple reason that players now a days will be substantially better than players back in vanilla is the easy access to information.
---
You watch your fav streamer you see his BiS program or rotation, so on so forth. You go to wowhead, icyveins, noxxic. (Yes I know they are all garbage guides, but they can give an idea). 
---
Where as back in the day you didn’t have anything. 
---
I swear I casted shadowbolt from level 1 to 40 solely. But now I can easily find out an optimal dps rotation, talent spec, and even simulate each new piece for a dps increase.
---
deadly boss mods isnt my thing either
---
Just found my first through those services, and that's spanning two servers for multiple years...
---
Unfortunately Private Servers seem to have given a lot of people the impression any class other than warrior shouldn't be tanking anything at all.
---
Yes, you need the int to raise your mana pool, and armor type will do.
---
Actual vanilla players during vanilla: 50g is way too much to change specs. We just want to be able to raid or pvp or do world content without having to do a bunch of farming in between to change specs. Please change this (players literally beg for a change with multiple forum threads with thousands of posts; dual spec announced but doesn't come til early BC) yay this dual spec is f*"kin awesome!
---
Modern wow players for classic: no this didn't exist in vanilla and would ruin the gameplay experience! #nochangss
---
Having 5 leather wearers is a really bad idea.
---
You will need to be deep prot then, and will have basically no place in a PvP environment until AV when you become the defacto tank.
---
You can definitely do this. It is definitely way easier than you're expecting. Playing a tank you should be watching your healers mana and getting a feel of when you should get healed anyways, so there's less extra info going on in your head than you'd think. Thought complexity wise, it only ends up being a littler harder than tanking well. 
---
I used to some times hop on my brothers account (he was a warrior) and do this back in the day if I ever had a tank leave while doing a dungeon. The funny thing is it usually ended up going smoother after because it meant the tank and healer were definitely coordinated.
---
What a solid reason. I love it
---
* You can also wrath/starfire then moonfire before the pool. Or pre-hot yourself. 
---
* But doing this before every pull can be tedious, mana intensive, or just simply isn't necessary. Druids are pretty OP tanks while leveling. You could probably get away with Feral charge into swipe spam most of the time.
---
You can use the condition *combat*. Any condition can be prefixed with with "no" to check for the absence of that condition. So it would be:
---
showtooltip [combat]Intercept;[nocombat]Charge
---
Be aware that this configuration makes it harder to view the cooldowns, which is particularly relevant in PvP. If you're running away to break combat and enable a Charge, you won't see Charge's cooldown until you're actually out of combat. Check out my warrior macro guide for more information on Charge/Intercept and stance dancing.
---
A lot of main spec tanks and Healers rolled a hunter or mage for gold farming. It was very common. My hunter had a higher /played than my tank.
---
Optimal setup would probably be shaman healer, 3 warriors and 1 mage to help control.
---
Old ST is so long. I remember the first time running it where none of us knew what we had to do. Probably spent 3+ hours between wipes and exploring.
---
Would the low base damage on thorns earlier kind of make this a moot point? Obviously very useful for end game tanking though.
---
Was this a thing you could do back in vanilla or a ps thing?
---
Since you've already decided on Pally and will be tanking I want to ask: Why Paladin over Warrior? Did you ever consider Warrior or was it always Paladin?
---
Look at osrs
---
I really wanted this tool, or something like that.  I have a ton of people I used to play with and even went back and found an Email/Twitter from somebody I knew forever ago.  I want this forum, but they may just not be that interested in subbing to get into it.
---
Definitely not optimal :P Just what we’re working with
---
You can either mine the stuff yourself or sell herbs and buy it. Either way works
---
Ganking and Twinks are different things...
---
I'm torn between a druid or a shaman, not interested in end game raiding but merely for the pure fun of lvling, pvp in Bg and world and dungeons. I want to be able to heal but also do damage if i ever get sick of being a heal bot and re-spec and vice versa if need be. I was quite keen to roll a druid but it seems every second post is dumping on druids for being crap at everything
---
Oh no this friend was me
---
Roll a tank or healer, problem solved.
---
You're definitely touching on some of my bias :)
---
I never meant to say Ashenvale is only for NE, but more that it is themed like a NE area. Though I'll admit that doesn't make it any less of a fun zone for horde, and in fact I'm hoping plenty of horde try to quest there because it's one of my favorite wpvp zones!
---
On private I wasnt even getting tge 5% crit from songflower bc im already crit capped. Losing 4.8 crit isnt going to be an issue.
---
Yes as ele you will be drinking after almost every fight. Enhancement you can save mana for cheap spells and healing if needed
---
Proudmoore was PvP.  I was on that server.
---
Trial runs showed elemental with EM being slightly faster per 20 mob kills than 2h enhc at level 55.  And i mean, slightly.
---
Right out of the gate. Some people only twink.
---
It finds my Classic folder just fine but when I click the addon on the Curse site the Twitch app pop's up and nothing happens, I've let it sit there for 20 minutes and still nothing. I sent my logs to twitch support. When I look at the logs the Twitch app says something to effect that it can't find/create the temp folder for downloads. So I've reinstalled it completely making sure to install as admin but still no luck. I might give it another go when Classic is in full swing cause I'm addicted to addons and keeping them all updated is a chore.
---
Thanks Bob Ross!
---
If the value of herbs gathered per hour &gt; value of ore/gems per hour then herbalism makes sense as you would just buy the ore you need. The one hang up here may be in that if there is only ORE listed on the AH you may need to have it smelted into bars. A guildie or an alt might solve that part easy enough.
---
Holy can solo pretty well for a healing spec, just keep a dps gear set.
---
Do herb since it sounds more fun and yolo. (:
---
I get we're posting funny videos but this has Water Elemental which was added in the TBC prepatch I think.
---
&gt;Bland tank and spanks are more your speed, eh?
---
I swear people like you have never played an MMORPG before. That's what MMO's are. They're a slow burn like TOS Star Trek the gameplay is in the statistics and the preperation.
---
&gt;Not everyone is cut out for active gameplay I suppose.
---
Again, that's not what an MMORPG is about. If you want mindless JJ Abrams Star Trek schlock then BFA is waiting for you.
---
Tomorrow. Look at the blue post
---
Herbalism isn’t going to help your engineering.
---
Mining provides most of the materials that engineering requires (also through items from engineering which are mats themselves ie. hand of copperbolts).
---
If you realy like the herbalism, better go for alchemy instead of engineering.
---
You *could* buy all the mats for 1-300 engi but I assume that will be a boat load of money you aren’t going to want to spend on it.
---
A quick google search or search on this sub would tell you it’s tomorrow.
---
it'll be the opposite.  a bunch of boomers spamming /1 with "WOW DAE remember this???? its so fun, fuck retail im glad i can play a real game again!!!!!!!"
---
It says it will end on Friday. It does not give a time, which is what OP is asking for.
---
At least you can still kill people from residual DoTs after leaving a BG...
---
That's why it was a hypothesis and not a declaration of fact. I never once said I am correct. I was saying this FEELS LIKE it could be the case for a hunter. That was very clear with my original post where the whole conversation started.
---
I think so because I saw some complaining about rep farming with the Thorium Brotherhood.
---
I can't help with the answer, I'm just dying to know why you'd want this feature?
---
Horde or Alliance?  I played there as well.

Until you realize Brack rotus is BoP and you have no use for them.

I've read several times that selling herbs and buying the mats is a more efficient time usage than farming raw mats with mining for engineering.

Blizz said awhile ago if Classic is enough of a success they would consider TBC and WotLK classic servers.
---
I would assume we won't hear anything definite until next year's Blizzcon.

No but, it ought to be since EQ blocks it now.

Thanks a lot! Do you mean the Warrior Stance Dance: complete macro suite?

You can gank on twinks.

So I played a mage in Vanilla but I have picked a rogue for my classic character. I have never played rogue before, in any expansion. How exactly does it work as far as swords/daggers? I am planning on doing combat until level 30ish and then doing a respec once I have enough points to get preperation and hemo. Do I have to use two daggers if I go Subtlety? I have heard it is better to do a slow weapon in the main hand and a fast one in the off hand, in my mind meaning a sword and a dagger? Is this correct? Also it seems engineering/mining is still best for pve and pvp? Is fadeleaf hard to get in classic for rogues? Wont I need a bunch for blind?
---
Seriously... Duskwood is probably my second favorite zone to level in.... after the deadly jungle of course.
---
Which should tell you that there is in fact no info, which is what OP is asking for.
---
I was on a country kick at one point and definitely remember listening to the first Little Big Town album that released and raiding AQ to it. Now those songs remind me of AQ

 A "twink" is usually considered a homosexual male with attractive, boyish qualities. Typically from the ages of 18-25, and often thought as a young, white, fashionable male.
---
Hmm... It's probably hard to notice how good Hotw is, when you always took it for granted and never compared it directly to not having it. An additional spell might feel more impactful but you are right, swiftmend and Natures Grasp probably can't really compete with what Hotw delivers overall.
---
Must be George Foreman.

Its only game! Why you hef to be mad ?

Creating your own WAs take a lot of time, especially for complex scripted and stateful ones, but I would say it's equally as common if not more to just use bundles from the community. Wago.io, Twitch sub only WAs from high end players etc were/are super popular in Legion and BfA.
---
I try not to think about addons as I had my ui perfected in 1.12 and recreating it in 1.13 is going to be impossible. F.
---
thought it was odd hmm
---
3pm PDT - Monday 26th: Americas launch tho? Name reservations is before the 26th
---
I started the game, watched the Intro, saw a nightelf running through a forest, shapeshifting into a panther like feline. Was mesmerized and decided: „I want that, too.“
---
Man... that is a risky click... sort of.
---
a lot of people like mulgore and TB, to each their own I guess
---
Well why does it need to be the reset day and the day before reset?
---
Well, we were outnumbered like 7 to 1 by alliance.  We only ever won if we got any organization.  I was starting to become known as a Raid Leader for AV such to the point that they would give me Raid Leader as soon as I showed up in AV.  But... that aside, I ran AV with a group lead by a guy named Nevus, and we were getting wins in AV at 22 mins (our fastest win).
---
Saving for later
---
Will engineering need much in the way of mats after I have it maxed and have crafted so my various trinkets and toys? I know iron grenades are dirt cheap, and I'm going gnomish, so I would need to buy my sappers either way. 
---
Am I correct in assuming that engineering required very few mining mats after it's leveled?
---
because we are magical Prophets of course!
---
As much as I love classic and especially dungeons, the bosses were kinda lacking. A couple good fights in there but a lot of bosses just plainly lacked mechanics. I'm not asking for 3 pages worth of adventurer's journal but many bosses were limited to a single ignorable mechanic. Like the 3 bosses in Strath UD side that guard the ziggurats, what did those even do? The ghost lady had a mind control and that was really interesting but the others? The spider had an aoe root (which is totally inconsequential) and the other guy ... cast frost bolts?
---
Not all Vanilla bosses were terrible but it sure had a fair share of very bland fights. I really enjoyed TBC bosses. Sadly the aesthetic of most dungeons was totally not my cup of tea.
---
And then it got sacked and everyone left for Zenedar on free transfers
---
Yeah lol why does it matter when in the week it is
---
For WoW, 1mbit would be enough. But I'd go for at least 10-20 for general usage since it helps with downloads and videos.
---
Yes. I can tolerate the chiropractored orcs. Wish they appeared in classic.
---
This guy is dead wrong about enhancement shaman being viable while only upgrading your weapon.
---
Went 1-40 on beta and gear was super important. Especially a few int pieces here and there.
---
Well you don't necessarily want to raid on the weekend if you're focused on PVP at all due to bonus honor.
---
Like i said, i can not find it, so maybe i overlooked something and therefore try finding my answer here. Or maybe we can base some info on how long the previous stress test took. I just wonder how likely it is that ill be able to play on friday. Simple question. You could just answer “It is unknown when on what time the stress test ends” or maybe dont even bother to respond and swipe/scroll further to posts that hopefully DO meet your requirements.
---
I personally didn’t max engineering so I can’t answer that question specifically, but I think once all the one time crafting items are done it’s just recrafting things like grenades or ammo or things you would reuse or sell.
---
If you’re in a more casual raiding guild I’m sure you could get away with a more hybrid build. If you’re looking for the best of both worlds then obviously you’re going to have to bite the bullet and respec.
---
When you're with the hermit and your hearth is on CD :(
---
just to get corpse camped in stranglethorn by level 50 hunters and some stray rogues
---
Thank you sir
---
you havent seen real hardcore gulds to call week 3 mc "hardcore"
---
I played Runescape from 2003 to 2007 and then I moved on to playing WoW for the first time half during Burning Crusade. The first several months were definitely more exciting.
---
it's your job to  HEAL things, not kill them. Bad priest!   Bad Bloodthirsty Priest!
---
So at what point would you pick it up then? :o
---
Thanks. Which class would you consider most mobile in classic? Not world mobility like mages teleportation. Druids and shamans perhaps?
---
Regardless of whether it's bop or boe, the spawn rates in classic are supposed to be way lower than pservers. I read that there is only ever one single black lotus up in any given zone at a time and it's on a one hour respawn timer.
---
I doubt I'll ever be hardcore enough to get one.
---
Yeah I think it makes sense that half ogres are twice as large.
---
So I guess all the edgy kids will be hating on Classic this Fall?
---
Im playing alliance, I might add
---
Whoops, corrected. Had the release date in my head :P
---
That's three months. You're going to be disappointed, as it is very likely.  
---
If we go off 7 days /played for the average player, that's 168 hours. If that person averages 4 hours of play a day, they will hit 60 in 42 days, or 7 weeks. That's already roughly half the window. Then you have gearing for MC/Ony, and completing the content.  
---
The majority of players won't be the ones racing to 60 with 12-hours/day pace, and most will hit it between 4-8 weeks. That gives the average guild only 4 weeks to attempt to clear the content before releasing the next one?  
---
My bet is 6 month phases.
---
I think hemo is the only non dagger dmg ability still releying on attackspeed calculations.. after they changed that for sinister, ghostly and the majority of all roher classes? Pls correct me if Im wrong here (does anyone have the calculations for the Classic Patch??)
---
So u want any slow mainhand, which is sword or mace usually.
---
If u PvP a lot ull spent some Time/Money on getting poisons and blindpowder, which can get expansiv if u want to Double Blind all the Time.. Most Rogues in back in the days didnt even use it in a normal fight if they werent damn srs about it 😁
---
Well, then they are the best at being crap of everything else!
---
Jokes aside, I'll roll a druid. They're great for 1v1 in world pvp, travel form is an amazing mobility skill and you can stealth!
---
Druid is a class to make you enjoy your time, in whatever content you're doing. The only problem is trying to be as inflexible as possible ("I'll be feral tank exclusively" or "I'll never leave moonking for after level 40") as the most flexible class. The druid can adapt to most of your needs, so I think you should at least try to adapt to your group/raid needs.
---
Layering isn’t even a long term solution.
---
It is being phased out after initial hype dies down (or doesn’t)
---
So yeah, pretty unrealistic given it is going to be leaving
---
I could stand to hear a little more...
---
For timbermaw/ argent dawn western plagueland fields rep grinds etc you should have zero problem being a holy priest. Rep grinds like those are best done in a group. 
---
 My advice would also be you start grinding Timbermaw rep as you are leveling, not saving it to 60. I did it like that on last private server I played on. Started grinding the Timbermaw mobs in southern Felwood at like level 45 I think. The Timbermaw mobs there are lower level than in the northern part or winterspring. Always made sure I teamed up with someone when I was there, usually did it in a 2 or 3 man group. Was overall pretty fun. Had I saved it until 60 I would probably not have enjoyed it, would have felt more like a chore.
---
3 Minute mage easily
---
If you clear MC on Tuesday and then on Wednesday. You get two times the loot.
---
If you clear MC on Wednesday and Thursday. You get loot once and then Thursday you are entering an empty raid?
---
You have time to test this during the stress test. No point actually playing it, so might as well settle your addons
---
Still faster to run to Westfall from what my wife and I have been testing lately.   Plus you can grab a drink or go pee rq while you're on that super short flight.
---
there is one in EU ebay for 200 pounds, but i reckon he'll take less. Considering a right handed is half that price... it doesn't look THAT bad. 
---
Or go to an electronic repair shop and see if they can fix yours. What's wrong with it?
---
How high do folks typically get engineering at lvl 60 in order to get all or most of the essential goodies?
---
Is it really that much different than people in full raid/pvp gear with enchants and conusumes beating up on casuals at lvl 60? And doing it in premades to top it all off?
---
Going against the grain here but human.  Perception, Mana burn racial spell and reputation gain for bgs.
---
If you are okay with joining a more relaxed guild, they might be accepting of a mixed spec.  I understand that there's a hybrid resto/ele shaman build that can do both PvE and PvP reasonably well.  I myself plan on running this Arms/Prot hybrid build as a Warrior, which gets most of the PvP goodies while still being sufficient as an offtank:

I have a metal spotify playlist from that time that is pretty full, not sure if it will be your thing but [here ya go](https://open.spotify.com/user/bryantpt/playlist/768lEdOGmtUoMlWDR7jB6x?si=okemVQngS-GBm6SuByozIA)
---
Yeah but you can live multiple lives in WoW!
---
You’ll definitely want to max it out
---
these are my go tos as well
---
Depends what you're looking for. I prefer horde because I prefer simple kill quests and less find-the-item-in-your-bags-then-do-this-then-do-this-then-do-this quests, and I prefer the aesthetic of the horde. 
---
But if you want as much story as possible, and some longer story arcs, you should probably choose alliance.
---
I am also interested in something like this, but so that it works on same-faction people as well. Sometimes ignoring a person isn't very useful but making a note of him being a ninja is. I couldn't find any addon at first so I decided to create one, but right before I started I found [Character Notes](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/character-notes). It lets you put a note and note-type (positive/negative/neutral) on a person. I haven't tried if it works on enemy faction people, but it probably should.
---
I have spoken with the creator about porting the addon to classic, and he said that he is planning on it, but he hasn't been invited to the beta/tests yet so he hasn't been able to test it out. I haven't heard about KOS until today but I'm not sure which one is better, when it comes to features.
---
don't worry, each realm will be large enough to host some sort of guild that with fit your needs.   Just go and play and let it develop naturally.
---
Vanas KoS might be updated for classic, the add-on does what you're looking for). https://willitclassic.com/view/6JWOzA6qDZfTckkzTkqT
---
I'm kind of saying similar to what you're saying in your edit. The fist time wow came out it was a lot of people's first mmorpg and for some their first PC game. This time around we're 15 years into wow in general and gaming in general and people have an overall better understanding of how the game works. The average player of 2019 will be make less mistakes and struggle less than the average player of 2005
---
Where have you read this?
---
I’m narrowing down to Paladin or Druid and can use some help. I mained a Holy Priest in vanilla and enjoyed healing in raids but was constantly too broke to respec Shadow for pvp fun and was super squishy in the world, which was really annoying. 
---
I like the idea of having a more tanky, self-sustaining healer, but would preferably also like to have a main that provides (a) some gold making opportunities, (b) a viable hybrid spec that can raid heal without going almost full Holy/Resto, and (c) survivability in wpvp, as well. 
---
Druid and Paladin both seem to check these boxes but input from folks that mained them would be helpful. In terms of class fantasy, Druid is more appealing but that’s no means a deal breaker.
---
Yea i mean the excitement has turned to torment with the days dragging on soooooooo slowwwwwwwwww COME ON THE  27TH
---
Would like to know as well
---
"Are you looking for a partner that never has something interesting to say?"
---
"Are you looking for someone to go bowling with on a Saturday night?"
---
"Do you want someone who goes to bed every night at 8pm?"
---
Www.Vanillafriends.com
---
* Deadmines is close to flight point
---
* Would be nice for getting to BFD
---
* Stockades is in SW.
---
After that you will have travel form.
---
I can't really pretend I have a definitive chill ranking for every race.
---
My experience has been that the most chill people play tauren, dwarf and troll.
---
The least chill people tend to play male undead, female humans and female night elves.
---
The other race/sex combinations are a bit inbetween. Some outliers are people that play females of the uglier races. Female undead players are generally very chill and female dwarf/female orc players tend to be very good at the game.
---
Is there any equivalent of LazyPig for classic?
---
Oh so what you're saying is essentially raid 1 day a week, gotcha. Well yeah that makes sense if you can clear all the raid content in 1 night.
---
Sounds like you would rather not have a gf at all...
---
That's a tough one. I grabbed it late but I could see how dope it would be while leveling. Even as cat it's a huge dps increase
---
there will be some big non-wow streamers that will play and probably attract a ton of fanboys too, so consider that
---
Im gonna go to org and get skinning when i have my first silver. Then it will hopefully get me my wands from the crafted gear.
---
You jump back and forth across the iron forge canal in front of bank
---
Imagine spending 4 hours in MC LUL. Back to retail.
---
A guild can be casual and still have goals.  My guild is cool to have casuals in it, but also has a group of players who are going to be hardcore and want to get server firsts.
---
They can coexist.
---
Undead because cannibalize is the ultimate bm
---
Just /ignore. It's simple.
---
&gt; Your first claim deviates massively from what I've experienced on a PServer and the results of the survery on the sidebar.
---
* I think the implication is that, while leveling, you don't need to have a dedicated tank spec... so there are more options. However this is also true for healers as well. 
---
* That being said. In my experience tanks are still the most highly sought after, even during leveling.
---
Started WoW back in WOTLK, been stoked for Classic. I've played a Pally my whole life, but seeing as they're automatically healbots in classic with not much to their Ret kit, and from what I've heard leveling is a pretty rough grind on a Pally, I've been trying to decide on a new main; and I think I've narrowed it down between **Priest** and **Mage**.
---
I'm still trying to decide which I want to do; I enjoy both healing and DPS. I like the convenience factor of Portals/Food/Water on mages, as well as great gold farming at 60, but something about a priest sounds like a fun change of pace. Their kit seems much more versatile and enjoyable than just spamming frostbolt, so I feel like I’m leaning towards them, but then the ease of leveling on a mage and farming at 60 makes me second guess it.
---
If any of you have opinions/main one of those two classes, or if any Paladin mains want to convince me to stick with my roots like in WOTLK, I'd love input! Thanks!
---
Why is that?
---
The previous stress tests were 2 hour stress windows and a full 24 hour access. Might be the same again.
---
I suspect there will be some autochess/TFT players in near meeting stones haha
---
&gt;Quietly
---
&gt;Linked in the main blue post Monday
---
Mind control for sure.   I'd love to mind control evil idiots like some well known world leaders and force them to make decisions that would benefit the world.   (or if that would be too complicated, Id settle for option two:  just let them jump off a cliff, after all that's in the spirit of the game :D )
---
Prove it.
---
I wanted to be an heroic plate-wearing human. I ended up choosing a paladin because they could heal and warriors couldn't. Now I really love the fantasy of being a holy warrior with a shield and being defender of the Light and the innocent.
---
anyone who uses quest helpers and non vanilla age addons is a a plebian
---
Closer to Menethil harbor too which will take you to both Darnassus and Theramore if I'm not mistaken. Making it easier to get to Silithus or Onyxia.
---
How? Twinking is super fun and is basically the same as level 60 pvp except with limits to abilities. You end up facing other twinks most of the time.
---
I did it manually back in Vanilla (copy paste and rename).
---
I wouldn’t advise it today, might get banned.
---
What's so special about August 8th? Serious question.
---
Well, you won't have to hold Shift to auto loot. So there's one.
---
yea... never heard of [b23.tv](https://b23.tv) so not clicking that link.
---
Ok I don't know what that website is so I'm not clicking. Are there articles or anywhere else? I find this suspicious, especially since they're more likely to make an official announcement first on such a big revelation.
---
Ah ok, that makes sense. Thank you!
---
Samsies bro
---
140 resistance is 35% chance to resist. If you get the T2 set bonus on top of that you end up with 50% chance to resist. So yes.
---
An extension of this; where does everyone plan to download their addons? I use twitch/curse for bfa, any idea if this platform will have vanilla specific addons?
---
This is all fucked up. Sargeras isn't listed and was an OG server. Emerald Dream is listed as a Normal server??? and Twisting Nether as just a PVP?
---
When you find that rare hunter who can trap CC well and has their pet movement and abilities under control, they can be really nice to have in dungeons - especially if people are a little under leveled for it.  I prefer them to warlocks since fear is such a bad dungeon CC, and essentially having an offtank can be really helpful if the healer is paying attention.
---
That place is a maze and I absolutely loved it
---
&gt; I miss being a piece, although an important piece,  but just a piece in the faction struggle for dominance. I don't like feeling like my character single handed changes the tides of war or what ever.
---
Completely agree. I hate whenever I'm given a title like commander, hero, etc. There are millions of players, there can't be this many heroes. I wanna be an adventurer. A good well known adventurer, if needed, but still an adventurer. A group of 20 heroes doesn't make sense. A group of 20 adventurer makes prefect sense.
---
Well the quest bow is rly ez to get in MC.. so Ur Fine already for 1/3 of Classic wow
---
I wouldnt be too concerned, with 15hrs/week ull find a semi hardcore raiding guild giving prio on Hunter waepons and ull shred 90% cloth guys, before they will even know where u are, since ull be ahead in gear.
---
Also u can kite kill Most of the Warriors/Rouges because if u play smart enough xP
---
Most guilds wont kick a member in the last Stage of the Game just behause other classes scale better now.. so if ur settled by then, which is ez with +10hrs/week i would not worry too much
---
The math just doesn’t add up to me for week 1. I recall record 60 runs taking almost 5 days of game time. 3 hours of downtime a day (tough to do) would bring that to 6 days, so &gt;30 people would need to get a record run to 60, then they all only have 24 hours to get gear and attuned and down her
---
Further? Tirion IS the Light. Enter into his grace, and be anointed.
---
Peggle loot is mandatory for my guild runs

Eight servers!?
---
**EIGHT**!?
---
Blizzard, that will barely handle all the no-lifers coming in, let alone the casual dad/mom-gamers that are returning to Classic.
---
They still think we don't, but we very clearly do.

It’s in the game.

Mage -&gt; Presence of Mind -Pyroblast
---
Like lambs to the slaughter...
---
that is a suss as fuck looking url lol
---
Looks fine.
---
Got baited huh
---
I may have gone a little off topic while defending myself lol. My original comment was 
---
&gt;&gt;Call me crazy, but I don't think players are really that much better. I just think marks (which came out in 1.11) make a HUGE difference for coordination. This made the game way easier for PuGs.
---
&gt;&gt;That and the internet is way faster. I don't need to time my heals through lag or have 30 seconds to a minute where I have no idea what's going on because I'm lagging.
---
&gt;&gt;Information is more available. It sucked when not only was the information scarce, but it took forever for the pages to load. It made searching for info take way longer.
---
which is basically just my edit in more words, or I intended for them to be. But yeah I 100p agree that people won't struggle as much. The internet is just way better now. It just grinds my gears to hear it phrased as "Gamers are way better now."
---
Sounds like my thing. They are good in PvP too right? Plus I can be that dwarf hunter of the Vanilla cinematic.
---
It's a website, not a .exe file in your inbox, lol.
---
note: there are only 4 dungeons while leveling
---
I feel really sorry for people who have had this happen to them regularly but it does not at all represent my average experience. Yea it happens from time to time and it's quite annoying (me having mained mage back then at least we could get people back to town to look for replacement quickly) but in my groups this has not been a common issue.
---
A lot of people here are straight up lying to you about what he needs to buy. Of course he'll need to buy the sub, but that's not enough to actually play the game, so he'll be facing another "surprise" charge on launch day: You must sell your soul to Blizzard.
---
As a rogue, definitely Faerie Fire.... with no cloak it is absolutely aids.

OMG WHATS NEXT LFR?!1!!?1!

Lol jk
---
Has anyone used this device. This guy on youtube used it to play classic beta.  I'm wondering on others thoughts on the device.
---
Quick note: what an executive in China says doesn't necessarily translate (linearly or otherwise) to NA/EU, so please take this with a huge grain of salt.
---
Make new friends?
---
How can we reserve names btw? By logging into server and literally make a character?
---
Well, you and like 24 of your friends are that strong.
---
You don't find it, you make it.
---
As a Resto Druid in retail and later on pServers I know this plight personally.
---
Put simply, if you have an endearing guild- they will help you do most of the things you need to do without much fuss over the fact you can only heal essentially. That being said, it is a bit harder to do certain things as a resto that other classes take for granted. Some of these things include:
---
* Onyx Atune Chain Quest
---
* Lights Hope Chapel Rep Quests for Naxx 
---
* AV Rep Quests After 60
---
Things things aren't impossible to do without respeccing or getting a guild to help. Just takes a bit of time to rustle up a pug for each of the events.
---
They should although check to see if you have separate client folders under your WoW directory. If you do, just make sure you copy over the relevant settings folders from the stress test to the live client. You can even do this across characters if you find certain settings aren't copying over (I do this with the live client because not all settings sych across characters). 
---
I'm not at home to check what files it is but they're pretty self explanatory. They should be under a directory for your server and character name. You'll have chat settings and a few other files. Just copy/paste everything under that character into the folder for the live client.
---
*Just note you'll have to wait until you create a character on the live Classic client.* Once you create a character for live Classic, a folder will be created with their settings. Close WoW, copy/paste all relevant files into your new character folder, and you should be good to go.
---
Now I want to replay wc3 with my wow main as hero

Does anyone know if Opie or a version of Opie will be released ?

VanasKoS and Spy both have such functionality.
---
Friends over faction every time
---
active subs at the time doesn't mean there's more of a demand for it in the present. Cata had much more subs that vanilla and BC but doesn't mean that there's a real demand for cata based servers.
---
Wait RP-PVP?
---
Watch your head

There’s some but not many.

I'm considering it in order to setup addons. I'm a bit neurotic when it comes to my UI so usually have no problem spending tons of time getting it to my liking. Would be nice doing it during the stress test. Feels a bit wasteful though to start subscribing 20 days early. Guess you would get to name reserve on the 12th as well though( but how would you know which server to reserve names for though?)
---
Isn't that cool, though? Isn't that what an RPG is about? Exploring and getting los? Seeing a maze like temple and STILL going in because you want whatever is in there?
---
ST is amazing. I hazily remember going in, doing the bottom part, coming back up and feeling "oh yea right, this was just the basement we wanted to 'quickly' clear before going up..."
---
Enhance as Elemental doesn't unlock the bread and butter combos until closer to 60.
---
Wait..people stil pay for guides..wut
---
&gt; Its the most annoying thing about authentic vanilla as a shaman right now. 
---
Fixed it for you.
---
Yeah, I always thought (and it was like this in og warcraft) that the faction leaders are the 'Hero' characters and the driving force behind the narrative. 
---
Now its just faction leaders being huge-boneheads and the player character doing the 'shit here we go again' meme.
---
Yeah, I'm mostly worried about the bwl xbow because it's quite rare and you need it if you don't want to be outscaled in pvp after AQ. How would you do to get a pvp 2hander like Ashkandi? Do you think I could get frustrated with hunters if I want to main it hardcore (like 30/40 hours a week)?
---
Test
---
This was my favorite dungeon by far. I ran it over and over again long after I got everything I wanted out of it, and ran it some more when the naxx event added new bosses to fight!
---
Also stoneform must be good vs UD priests and rogues?
---
Yes .
---
That's why I wanna be on a PVP server. No actual min/Max or progression benefits but pure tomfoolery
---
Weapons are a big deal for warriors, but since they are taking damage, they obviously need armor as well. Hunter is the answer based off your original question.
---
Haha I think so, I’m just relaying what I’ve read from classic class info/guides. I believe they can kite well in pvp and do good damage.
---
That's my number one problem being a prot warrior. I remember back in the day a lvl 40 dps could kill a lvl 40 mob faster than my lvl 60 prot warrior could kill the same mob.
---
This is in china which is basically run by a different company. I would assume most of this doesnt apply to NA/EU/OCE
---
I hope life is going better this time around for ya.
---
It's actually just to make them visible in gigantic crowds, so people can actually turn in quests and see them if they don't know how to /target Thrall or something.
---
Yep. I was severely underqualified on paper for an internship while I was in college... I got the position because I was literally the only one that applied. Everyone else was scared away by the job posting.
---
Scholo and Strat (both sides) are something I'm looking forward to the most. I loved those creepy dungeons!
---
It won’t happen.
---
They are going to release server list before starting name reservation.
---
I mean you could say the exact same thing for 60 if you’re decked out in the best gear available.
---
Honestly I either kept my pet (wolf) on follow and just made him use howl with a macro, or just unsummoned completely. You obviously lose a bit of dps by not having it fighting but it can also make your entire raid wipe pretty easily so I don't think it's worth the risk.
---
Recount. Custom UIs are ugly as shit. If there was a server that banned all UI mods I'd play on it.
---
I plan on doing the same. Run no add ons while leveling unless I feel a big need for one. Then add things on if I really feel it would be useful. I didn't run a ton of add ons in vanilla either though.
---
Wow is asmons main game, he’ll definitely have a legion of followers on his server. The others will have some followers for sure, but I wouldn’t worry about them too much.
---
Yes. But as I said, based on the player numbers, they should be similar. Back in 2005, China servers also limited 2500-3000 players per server, which is similar as other region.
---
You can choose a spec that works for both. You don't need to have perfect specs to do either of those things.
---
&gt; If you DE stuff while leveling you probably won't be able to buy your mount. Don't do that!
---
Just to clarify, are you saying that vendoring unnecessary items is better value than DEing and selling the mats?
---
haha dont remind me. Not even a rogue is safe in there
---
Are settings/macros/keybinds bound to the account or would I have to redo them if I log in with a different computer?
---
It depends who you ask
---
Theres vids of it dont take our word for it lmao go look. Its like a group of 10 or more bodyguards at all times
---
use this one:
---
Can confirm that's what he said. Seems legit blizzard guy speaking.
---
I plan on tanking as a warrior so really the only pvp I can do is wsg flag carrier. 
---
Oh well that's the life I chose.
---
The only thing a warrior needs in a weapon upgrade is higher damage ranges, stats are pretty much negligible... more damage more rage
---
They would just always be in the mail on his mule then. 5000 would last literally his entire time in game and he'd never ask for them again
---
My understanding is that this isn't about guild alliances so much as just making sure we all roll on the same server, to help ensure a somewhat higher population server.
---
Imagine thinking you had to do Jandice every time
---
How do you know how many players they will have or how many players we will have?
---
Sir. This is a christian subreddit.
---
thats just a small 2 second clip of wc3 btw
---
Well, the site I linked was last updated a month ago so it seems the AddOn is still going strong.
---
I also hope they'll branch to Classic!
---
Go with your friends, what a dumb question.

Where do you get Anhks?

lux vult, champion

First time playing mage on retail, gunna try to aoe farm for sure, looked many guides and it seems feasible since theres a lot of mob packs in obscure areas.
---
Power Infusion
---
Ty! :D
---
Ah ok. That should be very helpful. Guessing there will probably be a thread showing which servers streamers are planing to reserve on then. Just want to avoid those( EU though so probably less need to worry than on US which have biggest streamers).
---
For the horde!!! 
---
Plus that 25% stun resist mmmm tasty.
---
Give any class the ability to get a free ability, and it's going to cut down combat times by a very noticeable amount.  So yes, it is rather huge.
---
Friends &gt; Faction. Either convince him or go alliance.
---
That would actually be kinda badass except it wouldn't.
---
If you have a spreadsheet (I assume Google sheets?) can you just edit the post and share that with the rest of us?
---
Professional alts -&gt; Bgs open -&gt; Twinks. Some of the truly BiS require higher level friends to attain them, plus this helps with managing your xp. Having a 60 main makes life so much easier since higher level enchants require lots of gold or a high level farmer.
---
They are saved on local, that's why I keep those files on my drop box
---
I've played legion retail and vanilla private servers on my gpdwin 1. Legion would run but would suffer a little in crowded moments. Current versions played much easier because you don't need as many spells on your bars anymore. I'm not sure I'd really want to try and play classic on it.
---
Depends on the server economy.
---
Keybinds should save across characters, yet. But things like party/raid UI settings, chat settings will not. Although if you're using ElvUI then that will overwrite Blizz settings so you will want to go to the addon site to see how that works. Chances are you probably have a profile or something that saves your settings and you'd just need to select the correct profile upon creating a new character.
---
Why do people ruin their classic experience with soo many addons? I am sure addon support back then was way less and many of those addons weren't available.
---
Especially stuff like quest helper. People wanna play classic because you can experience the world and then you take out that fundamental part of quest reading and reading street signs with an addon.
---
I will never understand that :/
---
Immediately. If you're interested in the 49 bracket come join us in the [49 PvP Discord](https://discord.gg/Zn8Scvm). Some of us are definitely planning on rolling up to 49 right away, others as a second character once their main is 60.
---
I was 100% set on going Horde. My friends had other plans. I tried to change their minds.
---
I'm now going paladin. 
---
I'm happy with my decision. I'm happy with my decision, I'm happy with my decision.
---
Keep repeating it until it makes sense.
---
I think it was *kind of* okay that in WOTLK and Cataclysm it was technically an important lore figure that dealt the killing blow. After Cataclysm though, the story lines always made it seem like *our individual character* was the one performing these insane feats and not the raid group we were with or even acknowledging other players.
---
Powershifting were the days
---
Of course it is and nobody will buy enchanting mats while leveling up.
---
He also said there are more servers ready in case they get full.
---
You find people to group with along the way. My first character grouped with a tank and although we didnt level together he was constantly asking me to come to dungeons since we leveled at the same pace. Had a tank for the rest of the game after that. Much better than LFD were you dont care to know anyone.
---
But what class should I play?
---
Stone doesn't burn as well as your mudhuts mate
---
#Sorry couldn’t hear you over the sound of the arcane!
---
^^^^^^^peasent
---
its just a chinese video site, checked it out its 10 min of a blizz exec, and he does mention specifically rp pvp
---
Boo! What else do we have to discuss in here before this game drops that's more important?
---
You do realize that MC has been cleared in less than 20 minutes, including trash?
---
Walmart.
---
they did not learning from dark souls. closer to human size you are the more ridiculous your strength is and ... your attack delay.
---
Doesn’t matter if you sub with your credit card or with tokens, the income is the same for Blizz.
---
Not everyone wants to play ricer DDR with hackneyed arcade specs that all have a rage mechanic
---
Yeah, but China is bigger market right now for gaming than either US or EU. I think it is reasonable to expect less than 10 servers on EU and US as well.
---
Layering
---
the 2nd one looks pretty similar, maybe its the exact one, thanks dude
---
When it comes to certain classes, I strongly recommend leveling with a friend.  Warriors and Paladins greatly benefit speed wise in the act of leveling with a friend.  I would STRONGLY consider staying with your friend as a warrior assuming he will level with you.  Leveling a Warrior alone is arguably the hardest thing to do in WoW levelingwise.  Try to get him to hope over to Horde, if he is a PVPer express to him that Horde have better racials for that type of gameplay. Also point out if he is a raider the later phases will be easier for Horde because of Warchiefs world buff location near AQ and the ease of having the buff overall. 
---
If you can't convince him, I would play a Gnome/ Dwarf Warrior and just enjoy it. 
---
Just my opinion based on your class.
---
If not, you can quite easily tinker something similiar with weakauras :)
---
Yeah you judging on past conversation.  1-60 in under two weeks.  Prebis will take a week max, could prob get done in a weekend with luck and farming dungeons is 100+gold a day minimum.  More if doing solo gold.
---
Ah gotcha, guess that doesnt help much if the options are garbage. Thanks for the clarification!
---
Hello, I have played a mage on private servers and if you don't play on PvPing a lot you might find the 1-key rotation quite boring. Between those 2 I find the priest more interesting but I haven't really played a priest on max lvl.
---
On one of the vanilla private servers, some player had made a Dwarf called "Gryththurden". It was wearing the *exact* same outfit and haircut as the Ironforge flightmaster and he was standing on top of the actual flightmaster for a good 2 hours.
---
The only time you could click the actual flightmaster was when his characters idle animation wasn't in sync with the flightmaster's.
---
Praise Geraldo
---
Paladins can move around, but not quickly. 
---
Druids are very fast because of travel forms, and breaking slows/ccs.  
---
Rogues are fast, just not the same. 
---
Overall the game is a slower pace, is mainly the point I was trying to make :)
---
Fear is only seen as "bad" because people treat it like sheep; IE, fire and forget.  Don't just throw a fear out thinking that you have to CC something.  Everything has a time a place.  A fear used in the proper circumstances can save you from a wipe.
---
No they aren’t
---
Horde of course!  Because as you quest around the world you get to keep swatting down these pesky mobs called "Alliance".
---
Enhancement. Elemental's leveling speed only gets close (but still slightly worse) at level 40 when they have maxed out the lightning bolt cast time reducing talent. And it comes at a big cost as you'll need to glug water constantly to fill mana back up, which isn't cheap unless you are able to stock up on mage water quickly from a friend every time you log in.
---
I highly doubt that there will be support for conditional macros.
---
Source? Every server I've played I always get it to spam
---
and then he will need another item and the same thing happens again.
---
Rogue dps is actually insane, and he requires no downtime since he's not gated by mana.
---
Regarding loot: It is not a problem because you can target-farm bosses that drop the gear you want, and if you dungeon spam loot won't be an issue anyways.
---

Just subbed today to get addons set up tomorrow.  $3.75 is worth it to not have to deal with all of that on launch day.

Teldrassil, barrens, stv, elwynn, arathi highlands, duskwood, wetlands.

If i had to pick only 1; Teldrassil/ashenvale

If the test had a much better time window, then I would sub to test it. But because it is mostly during working hours (11am pst) and most likely ends the next day around 4pm pst like the last stress test….. RIP
---
The accomplishment of successfully leading a group of people through anything. The feeling of knowing you put your mind to something and accomplished your own short term goal. No where did I read "This dungeon made me feel the best in the world!"
---
What a new and original concept that definitely can't be found using the search function.
---
cant really believe it, unless everybody had fast run pots
---
The chinese all play on pservers and many aren’t switching from what I’ve seen, so they could have lowered expectstions
---
Is there any healing spec that has an ok time at farming gold and solo content? I like the idea of healing, but having to change spec to roam the world to do quests seems like such a big chore.
---
I personally don't think you should discount a class just because it isn't new for you. For instance, I mained a warrior for a couple years on a private server and will be doing so again. If you know you'll like mage then by all means go for it.
---
I actually cover that exact sequence in my [warrior macro guide.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cl85ma/warrior_stance_dance_complete_macro_suite/) The way I would do that is:
---
    #showtooltip [mod:shift]Charge;[mod:ctrl][stance:3]Intercept;[]
---
    /use [mod:shift]Battle Stance;[mod:ctrl]Berserker Stance
---
    /castsequence [@mouseover,stance:1][stance:1] reset=15 Charge,Hamstring;[@mouseover,stance:3][stance:3] reset=30 Intercept,Hamstring
---
This uses my modifier schema where shift is used for Battle Stance and ctrl is used for Berserker Stance. At a minimum, you'd want to use a modifier to differentiate between stances and this could be a single key (eg. holding shift always changes to the other stance).
---
If you only wanted a single modifier, it would look like this:
---
    #showtooltip [mod:shift]Charge;[combat]Intercept;[]
---
    /use [mod:shift,nocombat]Battle Stance;[mod:shift]Berserker Stance
---
    /castsequence [@mouseover,stance:1][stance:1] reset=15 Charge,Hamstring;[@mouseover][] reset=30 Intercept,Hamstring
---
Shift (or whatever modifier you want) switches stances, preferring to go to Battle Stance out of combat and use Charge. While in combat, it will switch to Berserker Stance and use Intercept. Let me know if you'd like a more detailed explanation of any of the conditions.
---
Yes it has been speculated so
---
sry, i will delete it. i cant test it because i am at work.
---
Lion's Pride Inn. Next question.
---
Shaman will be more common than druids. Raiding druids dont compete much for gear, but the better feral gear is all over the place.
---
I've changed my mind multiple times preparing for Classic. I started out totally set on mage, but I'm a healer at heart and changed my mind to priest. After testing out priest on a private server with my warrior buddy, I realized that priest just isn't the class for me. For now, I'm 90% sure that I'm going to play pally for those sweet single target heals.
---
My dilemma now is trying to figure out professions. I'm at a complete loss right now as what profs might go best with a Holy Pally. Obviously Engineering is top dog, but my Warrior buddy is going Engineering and I want to also to be able to provide some utility. My thought is Herb/Alch. I've leveled some on private servers, but never got to 60. Is Herb/Alch a good choice for leveling  (since there will be many farming node spawns) or should I just do skinning and maybe Tailoring (to make some bags and possibly some int gear) while leveling and level Herb/Alch when I get to 60?
---
😑 I don’t want to hurt your feelings but if you don’t want to grind some mats or consumables, there’s no class where some raid or premade is going to say “QUICK we need this (class) wearing greens with no pots because he’s a (class)”.
---
Yes the biggest obstacle in vanilla raiding is finding 40 warm bodies so you’ll find some raids to take you, but that’s not really class dependent.
---
Will still be fun and way more chill imo
---
&gt; They can win in nearly every situation if they "outplay" their opponent.
---
nah they can win in nearly every situation if they have cooldowns.  can't really outplay someone by walking at them and hoping they stop moving.  rogues are completely reliant on cooldowns.
---
I've seen cars with Alliance stickers on the back of them as well as Horde. I'm pretty sure it's equal in the people that feel pride in their pick, I think that's part of human nature. Everyone wants to feel like they picked the best side. I frankly chose horde because I consider them the underdog (on most servers they tended to be). However that did mean getting overrun in wintergrasp a lot.
---
Half the world population ? Get your proportion straight bro ... it's a name ...
---
It takes a lot of work for a small dps upgrade. With Lupos never being good it probably isn't worth it for most hunters. On private servers a good hunter could basically double their dps in early raids by using pet well.
---
the link in this thread brings up nothing for LS, which is weird
---
Too bad Archmage Vargoth's Staff is TBC. I loved seeing 20+ of those in screenshots.
---
Thanks for the reply. I use kind of a claw/palm grip so I'd be worried as well... Any other MMO Mice you've used that you might recommend?
---
The G600's biggest appeal to me was the price.
---
Might be rough at the start if this is true, but honestly I would prefer that to dead servers in 6+ months. Much prefer to start small and expand only if necessary.
---
It isn't hard at all to get a raid spot as a druid since the class was historically under represented, they do alot more than just brez and innervate.
---
Considering what I've read from you, you want to play a stealth class and sadly druids aren't really the ninja type.
---
I'd stick to rogue
---
Vanish into Backstab is going to be better if you're in a PVE spec.
---
[What-should-I-play-Wednesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cn3lu3/what_should_i_play_wednesdays_august_07_2019) is today
---
I think that's because asmon pretty much exclusively streams wow. A larger portion of his fan base was likely to get into the beta than sodas. On live classic, any soda fan can pay $15 a month to go play with him.
---
&gt; That's assuming you're healing for both
---
I'm not. At least don't want to.
---
Cure Disease, charge 2 bucks per disease. Will be rolling in that dough.
---
Once I got a gaming mouse with the tilt left/right middle mouse button it made my life much easier.   You won't need it all the time, but for PvP or hectic raid fights you'll be glad you have it.
---
Oh yeah, my bad! It's very much longer indeed yes. It's pretty much two weeks.
---
Ik it's not classic. But let's give a hoot or two for Karazhan. That place was incredible.
---
What would be a good time and place to use fear?   It's pretty rare to not have the next pack of mobs far away enough to be safe using it in a dungeon.
---
Are you threatening me with barrens chat? lol
---
As an addoholic I will use all of them.
---
No, almost no china players would play in pserver anymore at a latency of 200ms +.
---
Thousand needles
---
Stealth ofc
---
Might want to reconsider for your sanity, friend.
---
people being afraid of url:s in 2019 EXDEEEEEE
---
I mean I used a quest helper addon in classic, loved it. Won't be using it on the first character but will certainly be on the second. Everyone plays differently.
---
The real money is in the herbs for rogue consumables. Hoard that swiftthistle and fadeleaf!
---
Based on reading your post- I'd say you want a strong melee DPS for PVP purposes. In that case, I would 100% recommend a rogue. Druids feral form hasn't really taken shape yet and won't until TBC. To be blunt, druid is mostly Resto or GTFO in vanilla. **That being said Druids are the best WSG pvpers because of their insane CTF anti-CC tricks.**  
---
If I misunderstood you and you are someone who wants to raid I would look at it this way: Druid = Healer / Rouge = DPS. Druids can be okay tanks up to MC. But will severely struggle beyond that.  Again because Blizzard decided to bring useful hybrids in later in TBC. 
---
Hope that helps!
---
I wanted to be a magic user, priest sounded boring, so mage or warlock, and by my own logic «warlocks are pretty much just senior mages» that choice was simple..mained him all through vanilla and still keep him Max level.
---
I played vanilla but never got to raid (50ish Hunter). Came back for WOTLK and Cata and raided heavily as a Mage. Been gone from the game ever since.  Played several alts during both runs.
---
I decided that I definitely want to play a class that I have 0 experience with, and the one that fits best is Warrior. I don't intend on doing much PvP, but will be questing/dungeoning with a group of 3-4 friends on most days.  
---
Which spec should I choose for leveling? Is human a good race choice for Warrior (i have a soft spot for gnomes, so might go gnome instead)? Which professions should I choose?
---
Yup I like this system
---
Very useful situationally while leveling. Use him for difficult areas and escort quests.
---
Pardon my crassness, but I am so god damn tired of player ego-masturbation in my games. Not just WoW, all of them. I don't mind if we grow further and further in numerical power and ability, but if I have to hear one more fucking cutscene where they pat me on the back and pretend that I'm the Savior of Azeroth, like there aren't a million other Saviors of Azeroth out there doing exactly the same thing, I'm going to fucking scream.
---
When they try to pretend an individual player accomplished everything on their own in a multiplayer game, it's fucking maddening to me. It's like a Participation Trophy, it's condescending and disingenuous.
---
If anything I think it'd help it. I think the only issue of playing on a "streamer server" is potential queue times during any big event. Other than that I think people are blowing it out of proportion.
---
Convince me on which race to play as a WARRIOR!
---
I’ve been back and forth between Tauren for the range and stun, orc for the stun resistance, human for the weapon skill and reputation gains, and night elf for the sweet flips.
---
Someone settle this! Also open to other races, provided you can sell it.
---
Lmao that's genius
---
&gt;power shifting will be mana intensive.
---
I want to play feral and Horde but it's soooo much less viable Horde side.
---
Dun Morogh. That fucking soft piano gives me chills just thinking about it. Pretty sure Winterspring uses the same music.
---
When do we get the answers? :)
---
There's a boss you spawn from activating the statues in a specific order.
---
No. Just class popularity. Search for the class demogrpahics that include faction.
---
Haha I did the same thing!
---
Oh man fuck. RpPvP confirmed. Classic can come!
---
I’ve asked on Ndale what many of the plans are and most say they dont want to pay or its too much so they will stay. I’m certain some of the wealthier players will switch tho
---
(Only when things are on farm)
---
Druids are faster to level.
---
Druids can HoT.
---
Druids are great flag carriers in WSG.
---
Paladins are great healers in really any PvP scenario and also bring BoF/BoP.
---
Paladins bring more buffs and on its own, is a "better" support class.
---
Paladins have better single target HPS and overall HPS.
---
It's a little bit easier to find groups as paladin.
---
Better class: Paladin
---
More fun:  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
The only ones I would recommend starting with are extended questlog and a questhelper of some kind. Everything else can be added slowly as you find you want/need it. But those two are huge for a new player.
---
Okay thanks! I’ve done a lot of research and been seeing a lot of people saying engineering is pretty essential for tanking. So I may end up going with that
---
Innervate
---
*confirmed for China. Warcraft is managed by a different company in China
---
Oh yeah, escort quests is a good use case! Thanks
---
There are multiple videos up on YouTube, including an 18 minute and a 16 minute run.
---
Nevus kinda sounds familiar, I'm gonna ask my friends I played with if they remember the name, if we saw that premade it was just go AFK.
---
We are going Horde this time, gonna get the horde experience since we have been ally since Vanilla.
---
Which server type should I play on (RP, PVP, Normal)? I plan on mainly focusing on quests/dungeons with a couple friends, and will be playing a warrior.
---
You'll want to save them to the general keybinds section and not character-specific section.
---
Still better than no profession. Disenchanted items are worth more than vendor price.
---
&gt; I won't use addons, except for raiding
---
So you will use addons.
---
There are certain changes. The biggest one is without a doubt layering, which affects your experience in both positive and negative way. It came too far, that calling it a recreation of vanilla as it was, is not possible
---
The ship was pure nostalgia from Warcraft 2. I was in awe when I saw it
---
You can play AB too.
---
Just sit on a flag and survive.
---
rip me
---
Tbh I don't want to heal at all, but I've heard balance druid and ele shaman aren't viable in raids. My main focus would be PvP but I've heard I need to do raids in which I have to heal.
---
It's easier to have a farming alt with max level herb/ alch to make all the pots/ flasks directly.  This is also advantageous as you can park him at Black Lotus nodes to make A LOT of money.  You then have a 2nd Alt that uses an AH addon to play the AH with the excess mats you don't need for yourself. The most profitable player will change from month to month depending on the phase. Some months it will be the farmer because of the value of mats. Other months it'll be your AH toon because they will have been able to ride a spike in prices.
---
I forgot to ask that, how CD reliant are druids? That is probably one of the biggest downsides of playing rogue.
---
I wouldn't play on a TV, there is usually a host off issues that come along with using a TV.
---
Many TVs are locked at 60 or even 30 FPS.
---
Most TV's have massive input lag and response time issues. Stick to the monitor.
---
Second. You'll immediately have a noticeable dps spike with new weapons vs getting better shoulders.
---
Out of the loop... Who or what is Thex?
---
Just do shaman and warrior instead. 1 macro for put down all needed torment and 1 spam chain heal. And you can focus on warrior stuff.
---
just fyi, I played vanilla and private servers with omen of clarity and although it was about a decade in between : I didnt notice anything off. It's always procc'd a lot
---
Druid [Hotw spec](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BirMIEA1oVI)
---
This is why my friends and I are going to be rolling Tank, healer, and a dps or two. Also finding a congenial leveling guild helps a ton.
---
Troll would be better,  but marginally so
---
True. I didnt think of that. I guess I could also tank the bosses in av. Life is looking better. 
---
Thanks.
---
A few things to touch on: paladin leveling is tedious, but very efficient and easy. Not sure if I would call it a rough grind unless you mean rough to stay awake. Priest leveling is comparably efficient, but faster overall.
---
Another thing to consider is that raiding will likely only be a small percentage of your play time, even at 60. It's true that mages in raids mostly spam their main nuke, but in 5 mans, solo play, and PvP you'll be doing a lot more. Cone of cold, fireblast, arcane explosion, counterspell, polymorph, frost nova, blizzard, decurse, the list goes on. Mages get to press a lot of fun buttons outside of raids.
---
&gt;spending 'X' hours grinding 'Y' Mobs for gold
---
Typically yes.
---
No new models but the whole engine is modern so there are a lot of differences. Personally I think Classic looks great all settings maxed except for water(I want to see through it from the surface).
---
a good warlock can use curse of recklessness to cancel their fear effect if its getting too close to another pack of mobs.
---
&gt; they're more forsaken than paladins  
---
Very much likely, but it's been said that for example the Ashbringer would take on hordes of undead at at time, so paladins could fight while outnumbered.  
---
&gt;I don't know if the forsaken are like the army from game of thrones and use the dead to form there ranks.  
---
They're not, that would be the scourge. Mindless undead risen by the lich king. Forsaken are undead that have regained their sanity, and they are few and far between. The only way to "make" a forsaken without it being freed from the lich king's will is via val'kyr, which are again really few.
---
Heart of the Wild-NS druid is a good healing spec that can farm and solo quite well. Probably best of all healers. Look up Ebbnflow on youtube :)
---
no one cares
---
I mean, it's a trope that goes back to HL1 and further, I think it does have it's place sometimes.
---
At least make the group of heros in a raid or something that strong, like 'You and a bunch of Adventurers saved Azeroth Together!' isn't nearly as bad right?
---
Retail wow is a participation trophy for sure, you can pretty much clear 95% of the content by just showing up.
---
Troll is the best PVE resto because: 
---
Berserking: Increases your casting and attack speed by 10% to 25%. At full health the speed increase is 10% with a greater effect up to 25% if you are badly hurt when you activate Berserking. Lasts 10 sec. 3 min cooldown.
---
Regeneration: Health regeneration rate increased by 10%. 10% of total Health regeneration may continue during combat.
---
I was on last stress test but didn't do much.  This time I'll be doing keybinds and addon testing that are updated for Classic.  Looking forward to it as I will be hitting the ground running as soon as servers go live on August 26th, 6pm EST.
---
nice starter list
---
Yeah I mostly agree, or localized lag from the streamer and their posse holding an event somewhere
---
Stop spreading this misinformation. The amount of gimped healers you will see with shadow weaving will be negligible.
---
Ye i mean i could enjoy endless boobies but wth Lets do this instead
---
Um I think you underestimate how many big streamers will be playing this game its going to be inane that first 2 weeks....
---
Orcs are THE warriors in vanilla.
---
Order from BIS to least BIS: Orc &gt; Human &gt; Gnome(PvP) &gt; Tauren = Dwarf &gt; Night Elf &gt; Undead &gt; Troll
---
Take this with a grain of salt, for PvE human and orc are the real nobrainers.
---
ty
---
Is this the worst trash room in classic dungeons? It's STUFFED with mobs and shit
---
No idea what you're talking about. The game is playable as soon as you confirm payment. There has never been a wait.
---
Power infusion is essentially a 6 point talent that gimps your healing in exchange for a moderate boost in a mages damage during their cooldowns. 
---
It's certainly not worth it outside of farm content.
---
Teldrassil, hands down.
---
I didn't even care if I died in raids because then I got to play the *real* end-game content.
---
Yeah I understand. Gear and professions mats I enjoy farming them but I would hate to need to grind repetitive stuff over and over. Like gold to respec everytime or repair gear. Im looking for a casual experience, at least as casual as classic can be, where I can participate in all the content and have fun. I think I will go with hunter or priest.
---
that still qualifies as life changing!
---
Fear is seen as bad because the mob runs in an unpredictable direction. Rather use succubus for that charming (if humanoid). Don't use fear unless the tank tells you to fear.
---
Well then unless someone is super desperate, they should hold on to it until the gold is out there. Having been playing a game that constantly resets everyone back to zero and being broke (Path of Exile), hoarding things early when they're cheap and people are broke then reselling later is immensely profitable.      
---
       
---
I mean, uh... yeah vendor it. Do that.
---
Or, bear with me, turn on Nameplates and click on the npc one.
---
I love the chains that span continents, like the one you mention in your video.  Starts in Hinterlands, leads eventually to Durotar, and takes you to Zul'Farak.  You actually have to travel through the world!
---
xD
---
Started playing mid TBC as a rogue, but I didn’t know much back then so I didn’t really get to enjoy the class. Have changed main with every new expansion ever since, and have been considering either rogue or warlock for classic.
---
Rogues - they’re really good in both PvE and PvP but i’m a bit concerned about the fact that maybe too many people will try to roll rogue and places in raids will be super competitive.
---
Warlocks - as far as I’ve seen in guides so far, they’re pretty strong in both PvE and PvP (saw some really nice almost one shots in some videos, not sure with which spell though). 
---
I’m currently leaning a bit more towards warlock, but would appreciate if someone could tell me more about how the class performs and if it’s boring or not.
---
Oh if we only get 8 servers it’s going to be a nightmare launch.
---
I was big into taming pets, so I picked hunter. I liked the idea of making friends and bringing them along on my journey.
---
Yeah, definitely agree with you. Going to Argus, finding Turalyon who is now a thousand year old lightforged space marine, void elves and all that completely killed it for me. WoW is suffering from Dragonball syndrome. 
---
I feel the same way when I see how highly (relatively speaking) people rated all the recent marvel movies, and compared scenes like the end battles of Endgame with LoTR. 
---
Feel like people have really shitty taste in general these days.
---
Do you guys think that PvP-RP will be the most popular flavor of Classic?
---
Hunters are bugged!!1!1111!!1!1
---
I think many of them will kill their streams doing so, especially the variety guys. And how many of those viewers during the beta were just living vicariously while they waited for the official release? Will they still watch streamers once they have the game avaliable to them?
---
I might suggest making another post about those classes/specs to see what people think about how you can make it work.
---
Can't find any option for that on the [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) launcher..
---
Berserking lets you speed up cast time when things get dicey.  All tauren buys you is a minor hp increase.   So troll is certainly the minmax choice here.  But you won't be crippled as a tauren.
---
Strictly speaking Orc is probably the best race. However based off this line;  
---
&gt;Tauren has always been my favorite race in WoW  
---
I think the choice is quite obvious. Go tauren. Beserking will be a fraction of a % increase in output, compared to looking at your favorite race for hundreds of hours if not days /played?
---
Show isnt up on apples podcast app
---
I'd put cloth casters, maybe not mages if they're going aoe farming, up with hunters as wands are a huge part of their leveling process to limit downtime.
---
You decide which is more fun for you and you do that
---
For me it’s Gnome Mage or Warlock. I was originally super set on Mage as I’ve mained a Mage in retail since TBC. 
---
But, I recently learned that Mage was just frostbolt spam in classic raids (maybe fireball spam later) and I’m not stoked about that. Especially when I’ll still be playing my retail Mage with a much more enjoyable rotation.
---
I understand that they both have great utility and Mages are probably slightly higher damage. But, would the Warlock rotation be more engaging in 1.12 with some dots to keep up and pet to manage? 
---
If it’s more engaging I think that would outweigh the bit of extra damage I might do on a Mage before I pass out at my computer.
---
Revive pet ;__;
---
I assume you don't mean to add mouseover conditions to the showtooltip. I cover mouseover Charge/Intercept in my guide. This is an extremely simple version that only cares about whether you are in or out of combat. Due to its simplicity, it has some edge case errors. I definitely wouldn't use this for PvP, but it is easy to use and functional for PvE.
---
    #showtooltip [nocombat]Charge;Intercept 
---
    /use [nocombat]Battle Stance;Berserker Stance 
---
    /use [@mouseover,harm,stance:1][stance:1]Charge;[@mouseover,harm][]Intercept
---
Without a doubt, Stormwind.
---
I agree with you completely, there's hunters who knows how to play. when you LFM or /guild random, I never bring a hunter. Also leather and weapons drop. I'd rather bring a rogue that can sap and you always can find a DPS.
---
Like you ever use the berserking.
---
Probably chaining chain heal and cancel if target has too much health anyway.
---
I don’t expect the 10% to be a great buff, since you wont take damage in Pve, and if you do have aggro you’re fucked anyways.
---
War stomp on the other hand, can make quite a difference in dungeons and maybe raid thrash.
---
+ horns and hooves, fuck yeah 
---
May the winds guide you brother.
---
It’s just the nature of internet communities coupled with the nature of that type of content requiring more organized discussion and preparation. 
---
Other activities require less of that so you won’t see as much discussion about it. People will just be doing those things in game, not necessarily posting about it online.
---
It saddens me so much to see dead realms :(but I have a lot of alts there so no way I’m transferring
---
Yes I do 💕
---
Obviously you didn't read "first two weeks"
---
Berserk really helps for some specific boss moments in PvE though, Onyxia comes to mind for sure.
---
I do find that the Cows stomp is better in more situations though.
---
I do love poping berserk in PvP as an enhancement/elemental though.
---
You got your answer then.
---
Generally speaking, world pvp gives some rest from the monotony of grinding. Sometimes you're being annoyed, but it gives bonding experience against the rival faction and creates emergent content. As someone who doesn't play aggressive pvp, I still prefer it over pve.
---
RPing is for well, RPing. If you already like other forms of RPing, you'll probably like it here too. If you're completely new to Rping... I'd say pick a non-rp server. I don't think the average person will enjoy Rping in general (personal opinion of course).
---
Thank you for this!
---
3.75?
---
Blizzard doesn't care about history. It's all about the bottom line and China is a market almost three times larger than NA.
---
Well that's really our only option. They will release the realm names soon, before the reservation day, and we can decide where we will be playing. I can only assume that streamers and the like will be announcing their intended choices before the reservation day if you intended on avoiding them. Use http://avoidstreamers.com/ to be sure. Otherwise we won't know how well balanced the realms are until a few weeks / months go by and population settles.
---
The biggest in-combat differences are a bit of extra stamina and nature resist for tauren vs berserking as an "oh shit" cooldown (and absolutely negligible regeneration).  Trolls probably win that competition, but not by enough that it really matters much for healing.
---
Also, as a first-time player, there is literally zero chance you'll be doing any bleeding edge raiding.  This sub and a lot of guides vastly over-value the importance of choosing the "correct" race.  For 99% of players (yes, even most of us veterans), simply learning how to play the game and getting better at basic mechanics is far more important than choosing the right race.
---
Long story short, if you like tauren, be a tauren.
---
Sounds like one of my characters could be the Hero Of Azeroth, and they haven't been logged in since Cata.
---
That's weird - a sub usually processes and becomes active within a few minutes.
---
Yes, vastly so. It's the equivalent of beating on unprepared passers-by vs trying to beat up people who at least have a chance to be equally prepared.
---
jandice barov so flippppin sexy
---
There was a pumpkin treat/candy during the hollow's end event I would save that made you even larger and orange.  Would stack with growth potion.
---
No perks like that no, that was added in wrath.
---
There are some advantages to certain professions, like blacksmithing can make a unique blacksmithing only trinket that makes you immune to fear for 30 seconds, engineering has a ton of super useful engi-only stuff, and tailoring has a BoP chest for mage and warlocks, as well as 300tailoring is required to get a set bonus from a really OP crafted set later into the game called Bloodvine.
---
That's not true at all. It's not OPTIMAL, but it's definitely viable. Shaman CAN tank all the way up to level 60 in 5 mans. They don't tank as well as a warrior, but I'm not talking about tanking instead of a warrior, I'm talking about filling in when a group can't find a warrior tank rather than sitting around looking for one for hours.
---
Understanding boss mechanics. Pulling him back at right moment. Chain heal is big. If all else fails, I check healing meters to see who has been healing the pets and give them a stack of mana pots and a "tyvm" usually keeps the heals coming.
---
As an officer in a bfa raiding guild.
---
Let me stop you right there 
---
I don't play BFA, not do I lack enough braincells to raid in that expansion or even play it.
---
no confirmation until a blue-post covers this

Yes I missed that, my mistake.

And yes it is there:

[https://willitclassic.com/view/k56BFKERIHZD0nHxsF8n](https://willitclassic.com/view/k56BFKERIHZD0nHxsF8n)
---
No, that wasn't a thing til WotLK
---
Hence the ??. But this gives a lot of hope!
---
 I would gladly join a dungeon that had a shaman tank. Would just find it interesting. Have never seen it in action. My assumption would be that a shaman tank would stop working once you hit like ST/Maraudon? But that's just guesswork on my part obviously.
---
What if you are a class without one such ability?
---
if the loot council is corrupt thats ofc another issue, its more of someone getting upset they didnt get the first dft or something, its implied that the loot council isnt corrupt. Even with a completely un corrupt loot council youll still have loot drama between one person not liking a loot council decision. Its just how people are
---
&gt;For the Horde, it's just talking to Rexxar,
---
It's running UBRS 3 times, killing 4 elites placed in opposite corners of the map (even deep in enemy territory), and finding an NPC 3 times who wanders between 3 zones.
---
You can get away with some pretty memey specs pre-60 though. The 1 viable spec thing is really only true for raids.  That said shaman tank is something that even pre 60 is pretty ridiculous.
---
For the most part no. There are some crafted gear that is BoP. But that is not all crafted gear. Also Engineering gear is limited to Engineers.
---
You are a cow ! At Classic release, i'll duel taurens, beat them, and bring them to my slaughterhouse !
---
Security these days is usually laughably bad. Clicking malicious links is absolutely still a risk.
---
Id be surprised if EU has less than 6 servers if im honest and also they can just add servers where ever necessary.
---
No option for Dorf Priest..... = [
---
Direction is completley irrelevant, as long as both characters are running(not backpedalling) then leeway applies.
---
I'm working on one to track profession sales. Hoping to make an announcement post once I can test it tomorrow. https://github.com/JoeGannon/TrackSales
---
Nope, even in 1.12.they didn't summon.
---
there can be no hope! only yes or no :D
---
Week 1 Ony isn't happening, as you stated you need like 30-40 people to be very efficient at speed running to 60, then you need to farm the the LBRS key, then you need to do the entire ony chain and doing ALL of that within the first week is virtually impossible
---
It's gonna be a hard No.
---
And when you finally see it and are affected by it, then you will be upset you need to start over on a different server.
---
You can't blame people for being risk averse, especially when we have wanted this for so long.
---
Not possible in randoms, barely possible with a good group past the level 30 dungeons. The big thing is clear/pull rate, youll be twice as slow as a similar geared tank so you'll slow down people just because you want to tank with an offspec.
---
Shaman have no problem getting into dungeons while leveling normally, I was able to throw heals and dps quite well. As a tank though I would say you limit yourself to less than 10% of those groups.
---
It's up to you, you can make it work but will struggle.
---
Hmm alliance only alright
---
Those links take you to old versions of Pallypower, not actual classic versions - also, just because it isn't on this amateur website, doesn't mean it doesn't exist
---
I was fascinated by dots and warlocks had the most dots. Although I rolled a warr, hunter and mage before, my first 60 and main was warlock.
---
Druids are a *little bit* like every class....
---
Maybe something with a pet? Hunter or warlock would be my recommendation.
---
Do you have any numbers on the lethality bonus vs ambush ability stats being higher? I've never seen a good link and agree that early game the bonuses to backstab would make it better, but I would think once you get to later phases the higher weapon damage and overall critical chance would start to make up for not having lethality or the higher critical chance on the ability. Ambush should catch up as you improve in gear, no?
---
Both classes are very similar. They have the exact same playstyle for the most part, and a very large portion of rogue players usually go with a mage alt(otherwise they go hunter or warrior).
---
Mages are also extremely strong in world PvP. Rogues also have a ton of non-combat utility such as picking both pockets and locks. Rogues also have vastly superior class questlines and have the best RPG feel tied with hunters. Both are insanely popular, and you will be in a ton of competition for gear.
---
These two classes are so similar that you should just make both imo. Play on whichever one you feel like at that moment. Eventually, you will get one to 60 before the other. That's how you've figured out which one you like more. Since you said you are playing casually, you don't need to worry about getting stuck in the pack with the other casuals, and can level your way calmly while absorbing as much as possible.
---
This is because of latency between you and the NPC's server signal. On the NPC / server screen he is 8m closer to you. Essentially imagine him standing on the "?" .
---
I have, they're all over the age of 70 though. To be fair I have met a couple of people in WoW above that age.
---
Queue
---
Go with rogue, unless you plan on ranking a lot in bgs you will probably have a better time with rouge. Easier to gear, less gear dependant, easy to learn hard to master. Mages are too situational for a casual player imo and only really do well in PvE with a lot of gear.
---
Daze and dismounted fo sho :(

I think we be using TBC macros rework irrc.

WeakAuras for Classic Poggers
---
Thank you for the effort, will try them out tomorrow.
---
Dont forget Linkin Park.
---
Warlock or hunter.
---
this is one of the results of how badly they ran the beta. sad
---
Deadmines is easier to get to for the Horde than SM/SFK is for the Alliance.
---
There will be more materials but more players, so it balances out. Price will be set by demand. As player count drops, supply will drop but so will demand. Should balance out
---
Hello! I played a priest since vanilla as my main (except for legion, I played a druid), and I really enjoyed being a healer. I would like to do some PvE and even raiding if I can spare the time. But I will mostly PvP.
---
I'm thorn between priest, druid and shaman (I never played a shaman before). 
---
Priest: I know the class very well and I know I will enjoy it and it's probably the most versatile healer in classic. 
---
Druid : can do a bit of everything, I love the fact that it's not a popular class and it will be easier to gear. At the same time I heard that they are not that good for healing and only required in raid for innervate and battle rez. 
---
Shaman : I really don't know much about the class, I have heard that they are great healer. Managing totem add a dynamic to just watching raid frames as well as some synergy with your party. 
---
Even with consumes though a shaman tank is going to take 25-50% longer in clearing a dungeon than just a regular tank would. 
---
You're basically asking people to spend an extra hour killing trash mobs/watching you drink. It's a hard sell when they might have 2-3 warrior tanks waiting for a group too.
---
Honestly, what you level with doesn't matter a ton in my experience. Skinning is kinda convenient for extra vendor gold that you don't particularly hurt for as a pally due to free mount at 40. 
---
Endgame Herb/Alch isn't really utility so much as just money if the server population has a healthy economy, which it should at this stage. You can always make money some other way and buy the pots for you and your friend.
---
If you're really minmaxing it, maybe skinning/herb on the way up if you slow down your leveling here and there to keep those gathering professions raising with you and then swap out skinning for alch when you hit max level. I don't think minmaxing those types of professions are super critical, it's not like enchanting.
---
Heal for the win!!
---
Warlock has 0 appeal to me.
---
If you only got as far as "Horde" and are completely lost on what class to play, I would recommend a shaman, as they are in constant, never ending demand for every guild, even if you start late, even if you think you're not good enough, you will have absolutely no problems finding a raid and people to play with.
---
Dang, this really got me hype!  I totally forgot about all the original bosses.
---
Shaman "can tank" in the sense that you "can travel to Hawaii from California via canoe" technically true but the onpy reason you'd try it would be to prove you can do it.
---
My old lady is more excited for classic than I am. Thank god for that.
---
Warrior and druids. That's it. Group won't want to wipe for hours either. Sorry your mad about it. CAPS
---
What they want out of the experience may differ from you
---
The 1shot era of warlocks is dead by 1.12, but they are overall in their strongest pvp state by 1.12 and are generally considered the "best" class in pvp from a 1v1 perspective so you are not missing much.  
---
There is a mechanic for reducing damage from magic spells called spell resist, and a counter for it called spell penetration.  Default curse of elements and shadows provides 75 spell penetration to their respective damage types.  For about half of vanilla if you had more spell penetration then your opponent had spell resist the result was a chance to gain extra damage from what the game called spell vulnerability.  This could be upto x2 damage.  So warlocks would just seduce someone, curse of elements them, and soulfire them and there was a ~10% chance of 1shotting someone.  Even if it didn't 1shot them it would be greater then 50% of their hp.  Spell vulnerability was removed long before 1.12.
---
I don't think the leeway was this apparent in vanilla, people are saying it has to do with our modern hardware, or internet, or something like that.
---
I used to run 29/39 twinks, obviously you'll beat up on normal players, but the real draw was beating up on other twinks because you're a better player and/or you have better twink gear.
---
Running holy pally/warrior with a buddy and beating the piss out of every other twink we came across was great times.
---
CHAINS OF LIGHT!
---
Title is misleading, it should be flaired to avoid the spreading of false rumors.
---
I don't wanna play on a megaserver, I wanna play on a server where everyone knows everyone... D:
---
Can you explain why rogues are easier to gear then mages? I was always under the assumption that getting a good sword for rogues was hard due to all the competition from warriors.
---
Keep in mind too, that with layering 8 servers COULD mean 8 layers per server.
---
They just are doing realm mergers without having to change realm.names
---
*dual
---
Corrected
---
Part of the reason you get Skinning is so you *don't* have to grind at 40, and also so you aren't short on money to buy spells on the 1-40 range. The arithmetic of adding up time skinning mobs in the 1-40 range and comparing it "to level 60 grinding" is rather absurd. Well duh. I know some who won't even loot mobs because they determined it was more "worthwhile" to be too broke to buy food/water and get to 60 slightly faster. Nah, no thanks.
---
Yeah I'll sub to playtest it, get my settings and macros up and such. This is the first access to classic beta/demo/stresstest for me since I didn't sub prior, but since we gotta sub for naming I might aswell playtest this.
---
god this game is so hard why can't we just have exalted at level 1 its so dumb...
---
That's what vanilla is all about! These days it's just going to the zone right next door.
---
I play Dota and get wrecked. Also, Pillars of Eternity.
---
I saw the badass warlock in the vanilla cinematic so I made one :)
---
omg yes!!
---
I would write them in pen on my mousepad.
---
I've played a rogue since 2004, and a druid to rank 13. Like the above guy said, rogues REALLY depend on CDs, more than any other class. Druids aren't on the spectrum of being reliant on CDs.
---
Rogues don't have as much cc as people like to think they do. But being able to cheapshot one guy, gouge another, and blind a third is pretty fun every blue moon. If you like CC, I'd give that to druid. Roots are insane my dude.
---
Don't worry about raid slots, both classes will get invited. More rogues, but more slots for rogues... Less druid slots, but less druids playing.
---
100ms+ vs ~30ms is kinda obvious to be different tbh
---
Dynamic respawn never inflated server economy, that was just another shitty argument from people who hate everything pserver.
---
Good advice, would also recommend priest for those defensive dispells.
---
ElvUI, Weakauras, Skada, Big Wigs, some sort of Addon that tracks every reputation and collectible item, QoL Addons and and Simulationcraft
---
I mean I'm not talking about tanking at end game. I'm talking about leveling dungeons, and I'm talking about a group that has been trying to find a tank and can't find one. Would a group honestly rather sit around for an extra hour or two looking for a warrior or druid when a shaman is volunteering?
---
I feel like blizz woulda just said hey we got rp-pvp forever ago if they planned on it. Dont see the reason to let people rage for months
---
&gt; Debating the value of swapping mage for a paladin. Better buffs but no AOE :/
---
What do you need the warlock for?
---
You will not be getting any mage blades any time soon if you roll paladin. Casters are almost always prioritized on that one. Shokadin is kind of a memespec so dont lvl a paladin to 60 solely for that spec, make sure you like the core gameplay of the class first. We don't really now a whole lot about how the paladin spells scale with SP so noone can tell you until classic actually is out.
---
More interesting is the stratholme footage :D
---
 RemindMe! 28 Aug 2019
---
I see, that makes sense. Thanks a lot for taking the time to explain all of that!
---
Considering you start 60 at some 5x ilvl that's less than 40 itemlevels over four raid tiers.
---
Now I've seen people argue that ilvl doesn't scale linearly and an upgrade of 5ilvls back then is not the same as 5ilvls would be today but have the ilvl differences really been adapting all the time? I mean if that were true, there'd have to be a meaningful difference between the ilvl-delta in this expansion compared to last expansion. Is that even the case?
---
In all of these 20y examples its always a mage who blinked or shaman/ret proccing windfury/command.

---
&gt; Not possible with the API used for WoW Classic. Addons can't target to cast spells automatically.
---
Can't you just use WeakAuras somehow?
---
That's correct.
---
Ok thanks for correction regarding China launch.
---
I feel like if they care about bottom line they’d just open up more servers within launch week if all layers fill up and we have wait times. Servers are different now and can be expanded more easily due to cloud-based architecture.
---
It'll only be in up to a month of release and will not continue at all after phase 1 so the eco will balance out if it goes up or down after this feature is removed.
---
Or just a good old fashion merge. Man, I remember when we merged with a guild similar in size and progression and it propelled us so much. It was awesome getting to know all the new guildies.

There is an "Interact with Target" keybind you can use to get around it. Would have to type /tar X first though.

Watch streamers when the character creation unlocks and avoid those servers.

Seriously would temper excitement until a bluepost says otherwise. Netease runs wow in china and they are pretty separate from blizz

damn lucky. I wish my wife would try playing but she has shown zero interest in video games.

Up to until SM is kind of fine since most of your DPS can tank hits fine anyway.

Its less their durability and more about not having mana.

Long, tall, and handsome!

Potentially false hope.

Layering is only going to be active for the first few weeks or up to 2 months I believe. But the economy should balance out by the time it starts to shape itself. Regardless we’re going to have a weird economy on launch until prices on items start to settle and the player base becomes aware of how the auction house works in terms of WoW commerce
---
Two weeks off?  You best be max level by then.
---
If you have the FPs already it’s easy xp, just make sure you start it after you have already been to redridge or are on your way to redridge anyway
---
I think most people are looking to [willitclassic.com](https://willitclassic.com) to get the links from there. Best I can tell there's multiple sites that have different classic add-ons
---
Could this be just for China?  I assume they'll have their own realms
---
Wc3 buildings made me lol. I used to make a lot of large single character RPGs back in the day on the editor and I'd always make the buildings scale 3.0 to look less silly.
---
You've tested this I assume?
---
Its 2019. Browser related exploits are a thing of the past.

---
Your account has several "accounts" (like beta account, PTR, starter, retail, etc.).  It's a drop-down on the launcher.  Your retail account might not be there yet, but this is how you switch between them.
---
People who got W1 planned will farm Hydraxian rep while leveling from 50-60 on the elementals.
---
If you care about PvP and want to raid, you want Orc.   
---
The +5 axe expertise is equal to 3% hit rating, while it doesn't help in PvP it helps a lot in PvE.
---
For PvP the stun resist racial is by far the best racial on horde side as Wotf isn't needed much on a warrior.    
---
Tauren has a decent argument for increased melee leeway and war stomp + 5% hp, but if we're looking at PvE and PvP Orc is the best.
---
Of course it does. Grinding is not viable in Vanilla like on pservers. Respawn with devilsaur. More black lotus, So my things the respawn rate have a direct impact on the economy. There's less gold. All guilds can't flask for raids becaus of the straight lack of black lotus.
---
Good catch! We will get that working for tomorrow too.
---
Well, having a heath set up to the nearest Lock trainer on Kil would be my first thing. Also you can buy Lock books ahead of time for your pet. This will cut down on the trips back and forth.
---
I think it'll work on the stress test, at least I hope so. I'm going to try and log in and get all my add-ons set up tomorrow!
---
Awesome! Saved.
---
You were there for the test? lol
---
Just decurse.
---
Maybe you're thinking of counterspell?
---
they're much closer than Tirion in ICC.
---
Likely no. It'd be a bunch of work. It'd probably be a paid service if I were to work on it for others to consume.
---
Divine Spirit
---
Just a friendly reminder to those who may not be aware, but WillItClassic.com has a list of AddOns that are already verified to work/will be working when Classic drops.
---
Priests aren't in the same level of demand as Shaman.  
---
Lots of guilds run 8 shamans to a raid, totems for every group.
---
just hearthstone, thats it
---
Try and not cut on all that edge.
---
I would be fine with the bigger models if the character did something like buff themselves before fighting and grew as a result of that.
---
In fact that would be kind of a cool immersion mechanic. These people are members of their race and function that way normally, but the buffs they use also physically make them temporarily bigger.
---
Ah, good point.
---
Yeah, I saw Horde as the unfairly persecuted and marginalized faction back in the day.  Stupid writers had to kinda ruin that in later expansions with the slew of overtly evil warchiefs that didn't draw immediate condemnation from the rest of the horde.  I get it, plenty of times IRL we have bad leaders, but the Wrynn's are always cringingly righteous, and when there are bad leaders IRL there is always plenty of dissent - so like, you know, make Hellscream solidify his power by killing off generals who were disloyal, jail those who openly dissent, and have the horde form a secret rebellion rather than depend on the stupid alliance to save the horde from itself by invading it.
---
After i quit wow during TBC I didnt pick up any games for a few years, she got me into skyrim (I loved morrowind) and Ive been messing around in a few games, but when I heard classic was for real and had a release date I made sure to get her into a stress test and it got her hooked.
---
Maybe it's because which graphics are better is usually subjective and your own opinion. I don't see why anyone would complain about a toggle, literally everyone would win there, if you disagree with that there's something wrong with you lol
---
True, though curse of doom can't be used on players. Maybe on pets though? Don't know.
---
Idk who to believe!!
---
Mental.
---
This site is there to tell you if it is updated or not. Cmon dude. Grey means no.
---
Mulgore
---
Dude, they're general education classes. Everybody gets a slot. The world is bigger than you and your entitlement.
---
Thats really bizarre, i subbed for the first time since Cata for the last stress test and had no issues at all. Maybe it was because i activated my account for the free weekend a few months ago.
---
lol at me being the first and only post on the thread 5 days ago 
---
i end the post with Kek
---
Do I need to buy a specific sub or is just 6 month sub applicable to both Classic and Retail?
---
Rogue stealth is painfully slow in vanilla and still has an 85% movement cap after talents.
---
What this boils down to is that we know absolutely nothing yet about the number of NA servers being released or their RP/PvE/PvP configuration.  It could easily be more than 8.  We just don't know and we won't until an official announcement.
---
One important thing to remember is that spinning up new servers to accommodate a crush of new players is going to be much MUCH easier to do than it was 15 years ago, and they've publicly stated they're ready for this.
---
Clearly you have no idea how dynamic respawn works lmao
---
If he's playing very casually most of those swords won't be in demand by the time he's getting there.  
---
Also, if he's going PvP, he can play a dagger spec - and daggers aren't used by anyone other than maximum TPS tanks who can't get thunderfury (and other rogues of course).
---
Highly doubted. The stress test had what 15-20 servers?
---
Not really sure what you find fun so can't really comment about what would be wasting time for you
---
Reading this has made me realise how it all began with Arthas' model.
---
Tirion was probably some weird kind of compensation for a larger than life bad guy... Good night, sweet prince.
---
itssang took care of the first important point. More people, more mats farmed but more used.
---
Big thing for me, it's all good to worry about the economy but low level stuff is worthless in the long run. Having people be able to level efficiently is extremely important to the majority of the player base. Reddit and other forums are vocal minorities.
---
And really, the overinflated quantity of low lv mats is ideal given the zerg that will exist at launch. We already know it's going to be pretty short term
---
Whats the difference between PvP and Roleplaying servers? And I'm assuming that PvP Roleplaying realms just combine the two? Thanks everyone!
---
cleaning up my depression cave. setting up battlestation. testing it tomorrow
---
Damage doesn't break fear, that would make it almost entirely worthless to a WL.  Curse of recklessness makes mobs immune fear and can break it if they are already feared.
---
Ah I see, thank you!
---
I wonder if a more basic version can be made to at least show who is buffing what and any players that are missing buffs. The auto buff part isn't really necessary! Some people have been discussing it on the curseforge thread you referenced so I'll keep checking that
---
As long as you're having fun and enjoying yourself, you're not wasting any time.
---
How is a hunter with shadowmeld going to camp alliance?
---
In your opinion.
---
Yeah, but that's not really something you have to choose between.
---
Just remembered. It's not tits, it tips. TipsOut.
---
I remember spending time during the week preparing for a weekend Deadmines run. Gathering quests, leveling up, etc. I miss that.
---
Tbf I've ninjad more bases as a druid than a rogue. Roots and hibernate are too strong against most defenders.
---
Alsoo theres plenty of solo dungeon stuff you can do as a druid that you might not be able to do a rogue, or as effectively.
---
So I can’t troll RPers on a RP-PvP server either!?
---
He can enjoy Classic the way he wants to.
---
I would rather not. But if it's all there is okay.
---
Emptied one room and got it fit for wow :)
---
If the addon doesn't get updated for classic you can just use Weakauras and make it look like that yourself.
---
Find a guild (if you want)
---
Check out your class discord
---
Scope out addons
---
Not really a lot to do
---
The problem with raid slots is overstated. People talk about how you will need to fight for them, but plenty of guilds will be happy just to have a warm body.
---
The one-shot is just the basic shadowbolt on the lock. It is pretty much the vanilla version of chaos bolt.
---
It comes down to what you want: a tanky caster who is difficult to kill, even if they are caught off guard while they slowly not you down, or a sneaky boi that will kill you in a couple globals, but will die pretty fast if you are caught off guard.
---
In raids, rogues actually use more than a couple abilities and have an actual rotation. Warlocks sit in the back and spam shadowbolt, rarely touching any of their other buttons during a fight.
---
That was part of the vanilla WoW experience. It was not all sunshine and rainbows back then. The amount of time you had to spend in game in order to progress was far larger than in current WoW. 
---
For classic WoW, either you accept that or you go play BFA.
---
Well because they're tier set is actually good for them, both in PvP and PvE. The Dal'rend blades are really good, even compared to double Vis'kag they're not *that* bad and can be farmed.
---
It would be a huge insult to give one to China and not to the rest of the world

#&lt;Haven&gt; | Horde NA PvP | Raiding-focused | Tue/Wed 7-10p CST
---
At our core, we are an IRL gaming group looking for like-minded, team-oriented players to flesh out our raiding guild with one goal in mind - to slay virtual dragons.
---
**Core raid times**:
---
Tuesday &amp; Wednesday 7pm-10pm CST/CDT
---
**Priority**:
---
Raiding will be the priority for the core group, however we also do enjoy world PvP, premades etc. and are looking forward to the PvP content in phase 2.
---
&gt;*We are looking for players who plan to hit level 60 ideally by November and would be able to attend MC raids starting the first Tuesday (5th) of November.*
---
While this is *not* a hard requirement or deadline, we feel stating this general time frame is much more helpful to finding like-minded players than vague descriptions like "Semi-Casual" or "Semi-Hardcore". We feel setting expectations is important, as we do not want players to join expecting raids to happen in the first month of launch, nor are we really seeking out players who plan to hit 60 six months from now.
---
**Loot System &amp; Rules**:
---
Teamwork first and foremost.
---
We want players to stick with the guild for the long term, and we want loot distribution to be fair while still putting the overall progress of the guild first.
---
To that end, we plan on using a loot council system for the first few clears of MC and any new content. This will, for example, allow us to filter important gear pieces to the Main Tank and progress at an accelerated pace, benefitting everyone.
---
Class officers will be consulted to help determine to whom gear is allocated. A simple /roll or round-robin system may end up being used for many items that could go to more than one player.
---
We will always have 1 non-officer member, chosen at random each raid, to be present for the loot council discussion to promote transparency.
---
**Other Requirements**: 18+, punctual, good communication skills. Currently open to all classes and specs.
---
If you need any more information, feel free to [ask in our Discord](https://discord.gg/Nfmn6mq
---
)!
---
Lots of guilds would like that, yea, but they arent getting 8 every time. I was thinking more along the lines of priest in bgs, in pve the demand for shaman is definitely real no doubt.
---
In Beta default quality was @ 4 and it looked pretty much like classic. On 10 it looked better - almost modern wow. So it's really up to you how you want to play.
---
Dire Maul, DM.
---
i will need to buy her a bunch of gift cards for "Happy Feet".
---
Yeah hopefully I can find a good guild this time around.
---
Hi, /u/lolisbae
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cn8i8g/what_racegenderclass_combinations_do_you_hate/). 
---
Soul Stone.
---
The 49 bracket has the lowest difference in gear impact compared to all others. 
---
The whole appeal of the 49 bracket is that it's the most balanced PvP sub 60, because of the gear and everyone having all their important stuff and mounts...
---
50 character limit has nothing to do with amount of servers. There will absolutely be more than 5 servers. I'm guessing about 20.
---
I'm in line with the others here, subbing tomorrow to setup my UI before launch.  Hoping to have a semi working version of my setup to get me through till raiding.  At which point more addons will be added probably hehe.
---
For now, I’m listening to some audio books to catch up on lore when I’m driving to work/home.
---
Also, I’ve been saving some posts that relate to hunters/engineering that I come across since I will be playing a hunter w/ goblin engineering.
---
Lastly, (one that I’m excited about) I purchased the WoW cook book on Amazon. I plan on staying home all weekend the first weekend after release, and cooking up a few things on Saturday as I game. Then later in the evening, I will make a few alcoholic drinks (I really want to try the cherry grog). I plan to be in my pajamas all weekend, I’m 24 and idc lol. Should be a lot of fun!
---
I've seen some advertising for guilds that do city raids.  That may be up your ally.  They were advertising EU, but were on the match making monday, or some deal thread.
---
Didn't Faerie Fire also debuff armor?
---
Priority one is to learn how to totem twist. If you can, there should be room for you in raids.
---
&gt; I was saying this FEELS LIKE it could be the case for a hunter.
---
It most likely is not. It's very hard that the 3 seconds spent for skinning acount for 25% of your leveling time, when you're a BM hunter and you can send your pet attacking while you skin anyway.
---
Go to the store and buy yourself fruit to snack on.
---
If you don't mind doing a bit of prep cook some roast veg cous cous (it's as simple as it sounds, just drizzle a small amount of oil when roasting the veg).
---
&gt; a trope that goes back to HL1
---
lol wut?  youre a random scientist.
---
I mostly like lemon haha not much of a fan of the other stuff. Could also do Emergen-C for some kinda orange juice taste and immune boost, can't be getting sick!
---
I can't believe OP thinks increasing his speed from 5 mph to 10 mph means he gets to his destination instantly.
---
I know on the last stress test after they added more layering on the server I was on it became much more stable and playable. So hopefully they found a good balance as I can't imagine they want to be fudging with existing layers at launch like that if it can be avoided. That said, hopefully they were also able to sort out some of the "creative uses" of layering...
---
As a casual you want to pick professions that will pay well consistently on the AH. I would recommend herbalism and mining to level. You can sell the stack on the AH if they are in need or vendor the rest. **The profession that will be the most valuable after a few months will be fishing. This profession is needed to make a lot of consumables and is the most time consuming to level. This will mean there will be few people leveling it early in the game.**  Another good reason to do mining/ herbalism is for the endgame. When you get there you can choose to drop mining for alchemy for PVE mats. Or you can drop herbalism for Engineering for brutal PVP power.
---
I had good internet back in Classic, I played both Rogue and Hunter, and honestly the leeway looks exactly as I remember it.
---
Undead male rogue. They’re all assholes
---
Horde gets RFC with a ton of quests at 13-15, WC quests are all in barrens excluding the chain that starts in Barrens but takes you to TB.
---
8 servers for china? Isn't that a bit few?
---
May be wrong. It's somewhere between 1.11 and mid TBC. Would have to dig more to find out when but my guess is that if it is in with classic it would be labeled as something up for correcting since it's not impacting the game play.
---
I feel ya
---
Do you get anything if you kill thrall?
---
I did this recently on a stress test.  If you're soloing, you'll absolutely want the health potions.  If you're in a group you can manage without alchemy.
---
Read the thread, otherwise you do you. I don't care.
---
What? There is so much nonsense in this post.  
---
Most powerful cooldowns in the game? Lay on hands, shield wall, recklessness, ice block just to name a few.    
---
Druids level faster yes.   
---
Druids cannot tank raids without any gear, gear doesn't scale as well on them as it does on Warriors, but a pre-raid BiS warrior will out tank a druid any day of the week. Druids are not "better" tanks than Warriors in MC.  
---
This is true, but it's easier to find better guilds when you're a more in demand class, druids aren't really in demand and while it's true that Rogues aren't really either, a well geared Rogue has more potential to join a good guild than a well geared Druid.  
---
Druids do not have very low gear requirements, in a PvE environment everyone needs gear, Druids are just awkward to gear as they don't want agi - they want +AP and strength which doesn't really exist unless it's rank 14 gear or AQ40 stuff. Also, prep for raids? Feral druids need to farm MCP constantly which is by far the most annoying prep you could do for a raid because you can't buy the damn thing - and MCP isn't convenient for Horde to get to. Even tanks need an MCP for threat generation at the start of fights, kitty druids need like 20+ MCP's for a single night of progression.  
---
Seriously, Druids are for masochists, rogues are for complete casuals when you compare them to feral druids.
---
You're absolutely right about that. And mage is where I am leaning as of now. I like the rogue too, though. So I'm trying to do my due diligence to decide if Id be happier trying something new like a rogue.
---
I only join guilds that are "laid back".
---
If you ask a hooker: the size definitely matters 
---
if you ask someone who's a bit less slutty...
---
Would probably pair nicely with consoleport addon which brings something like the gamepad mode from ffxiv to wow. It works quite nice in ffxiv which has quite a few spells for each class.
---
The essential levels for warlock are lvl 5 for imp, and 10 for VW i'd say
---
There was a Blizzard April fools about in-game ordering panda express.
---
It looks super cool, but I agree that it's kinda crazy to be riding on a thing that literally changed the world as we knew it. But that's what playing an MMO is, you just have to look past it.
---
What makes you think OP is a programmer?
---
OP noted "outside of raids". Thrall and Jaina in Battle for Mt. Hyjal were also ridiculously tall.
---
Yes, you can remove it's assigned function in the logitech software, i never used it personally as the 12 buttons are enough for me, and no i dont click it by accident
---
wow should have ended after WOTLK
---
Start out by making food in advance. I like a big pot of chili(well without the chili in it and careful with the beans for obvious toilet reasons), this can sit in your fridge for like 2-3 days and you can eat off that. Another good tip is to have something frozen. Soup is great for that, you can make some portions of chicken noodle soup(because it's fucking delicious homemade), and just 30-60 mins before you want to eat you put it on low heat on the stove and forget it. 
---
Avoid junk food, avoid all sugar even fruits. That shit burns you out fast. Meal replacements are great too. Drink just plain water. Additionally caffeine pills are nice, cheap and easy to use instead of coffee or energy drinks, but obviously be aware and don't consume them 8 hours before you want to sleep, and don't overdo it. Caffeine has a halflife of about 6 hours in your system, and  you do not want to go anywhere near 500mg. 
---
Lastly make very good use of every single break you get. Flightpaths are a big one. Stretch, walk around and stuff you need breaks from sitting down. Hell even if you have to walk in a straight line for a big, just put on auto run and just stand up for a bit, trust me this makes night and day difference.
---
Also for big gamer tip, stay up 30-40 hours first day, then go 14-16 hours, it's so much more efficient in terms of leveling speed, because after such a long session you will be completely alone in zones.
---
Uis sre client side, what would yoy get out of banning UIs that would benefit you as a player o.O
---
Um....  Age is relative.....  I'm 40, and idc either hehe.... Kids and wife are gone for the weekend, I shall be neck bearding it too.....
---
&gt;Fuck you
---
-Blizzard
---
In general, I think human mages are tacky. This stems from the try-hards in retail that wanted to and I quote "look like the cinematic mage".
---
Time to redo the reddit poll, but with RPPVP in it this time.
---
At this point I am settled in on alliance and a hunter. I’m going to PVP and I’m pretty stinking casual at this point due to real life time constraints, where as my first go-round I was extra sweaty. My question: is stoneform or shadowmeld better for hunter? I will be solo a lot.
---
This works if everyone is a reasonable level for the instance and everyone knows what they're doing. A lot of noobs in vanilla but I have a feeling Classic will be better.
---
You’d be about as effective as a hunter pet or voidwalker, in that you can maybe keep the attention of one or two mobs.  I wouldn’t want you as a tank any more than I’d want a hunter or lock to tank with their pet.  It can be done, sure, but it’s not like this isn’t going to take equal parts convincing and desperation.
---
All classes can hit 60 in less than 6 days played.

The only people that could love windows 10 is you and satya nadella's mom.

Sold my soul for middle management baby |,,|  That's why I'm considering rolling NA, 1800 EST is 2200 here so I'll be home from work.

probably shackle undead.
---
Yaaa retail bad! Form a circle everyone!
---
Swifty also has a spreadsheet of most classic addons updated on his twitch if anyone is interested.
---
A redditor who jumped the gun too quick on his comment, impossible.
---
refering to myself if it isnt obvious
---
Broke up with my gf, put university on hold for a year and moved back in with my parentes to save time by not having to cook.
---
Mix it up with shaman. You can heal, melee, or cast spells.
---
World of Warfcraft 9: WRATH OF THE MURLOCS
---
Despite those will reduce my fun, yes. Because those are the minimum necessary
---
If horde go Orc. That stun resist is over powered when it comes to pvp. You will notice a drastic difference. When another rogue fails a cheap shot, then fails a kidney shot on you... op.
---
Perhaps now might be a good time to put RPPVP in the poll.
---
If you can login ;)
---
The early access costs me about 2 hours worth of salary... Hardly even worth mentioning tbh.
---
But I can understand not wanting to pay on principle.
---
Yes, but it's fun too
---
Pretty neat and simple. I'll def be giving this a try.
---
Warrior/Warrior/rogue ( to help Else 3 warrior) priest shaman.
---
Yes please
---
Gonna use a handful of unobtrusive ones, I want to keep as much of the original UI as possible
---
Laughs in cloth wearing holy pally
---
I would put Troll well above Tauren for PvE, Troll is actually BiS for tanks that are using thunderfury as the orc racial gives them nothing - but beserking gives them more TPS.  
---
The problem is, unless you're guaranteed the main tank spot (and even if you are, no guarantee you get a thunderfury) some of the best tanking weapons are axes.
---
Make it pre-nerf Scholo and I would be excited.
---
Classic uses the modern API, so that macro won't work. You can build something very similar, but include more powerful tools like mouseover targets. You can't quite make it toggle between attack and follow, but you can use modifier keys to get the same effect.
---
Thanks! It's built on my (Navak's) leveling route. I got Horde first level 30 on the Classic Beta running my route as a solo Warrior no less. I spent most of the Beta testing and improving my work.  
---
As you suggest, we're working on implementing more navigation features to skip throughout the guide as well as cookies to save progress and keybinds to quickly use the tool. The map will be fully integrated with our Atlas which will in time include layers such as FPs and graveyards. Super excited for what the future holds!
---
That macro will not work in classic
---
Looking good so far
---
I'd complete northshire and get your imp first, then go to the Nelf starter zone (Most should still be green), then when you get 10, I'd go and do the Voidwalker quest then come back, this will make the Barrow Den quests much easier haha
---
Playerbase: I'm avoiding rolling on a streamer server at all costs!          
---
Blizzard: pepeLaugh he doesn't know pepeLaugh
---
Wow, what an incredibly compelling argument.
---
YAHT is the bomb
---
i’m an old as man and i can’t muster that strength. one week is a long time after waiting 12 years
---
Thanks for the reply man - that’s what I figured. My only hesitation is I’m also rolling an orc hunter as my main so would be nice to get some race variety. Unless leeway seems super OP tho I’ll probably just do orc though for the reasons you mention.
---
^ As a druid my macros are relatively simple, but I see what you're saying. Modern problems require modern solutions.
---
You’re welcome.  Downvoted right back.
---
Looking really nice guys! Very gj!
---
I would say if you are wanting enchanting for the end game, level it just enough to get the greater magic wand through DEing tailoring items, then don't touch it until 60.
---
Yeah from the perspective of fury and PvP, forgot to mention that. Thanks
---
complete nonsense?
---
if you want to be a top level raider raiding 3/4 times a week enha probably isn't best.
---
Complete nonsense. But true if you are a top level player. Pick one man.
---
Looking forward to the full ones before release! ;)
---
Interesting. Love the option for a trio. If this does get done before launch I will most certainly be using it. Awesome idea.
---
The hero we need, not the one we deserve.
---
Not really. Usually the stronger guild (brings more members) dictates the dibs. Afterwards when they become big enough to do guild-only the remaining guilds bring a new guild in and the new strongest guild dictates and so on.
---
Not a perfect system, but i’ve been in 2 alliances and never had any drama. Wasn’t an officer tho so who knows?
---
Those shirts are only worth money if you took them off before they became soulbound.  The ones that weren't equipped became BOE, but if you were wearing them, they're now soulbound
---
Check the official WoW forums, Blizzard have added a sub forum specifically for guilds recruiting for launch. That’s how I found mine!
---
Kick AFK player, walk out of dungeon, /who the zone your in, PM people that fit what your looking for to see if they will come.
---
I mean, it is a Blizzard dev very clearly speaking in english about this. Don't know how more official it can get.
---
This is why I am playing a priest and my wife a warrior. Instant groups.
---
That's how it starts, you grab your crowbar and go, by the end of the game though you are recognized as a threat/power by earth and the aliens. Some theory goes that when Gordon was in the room with the teleporter thing at the beginning it changed him and made him faster/smarter/stronger than a normal human.
---
This all leads to HL2 where you are the hero, no matter how silent. People know your face/name anywhere you go, you're the savior for most of the NPCs.
---
I'm not saying it's on the same campy level, it was just a random example and probably not the best one!
---
Being able to eat and drink at the same time
---
I was actually thinking of doing this, except save the burritos for the 2nd week and make decent food for the first week and just fridge it. Maybe a salmon on rice or something in a bowl thats easy to eat while attacking stuff.
---
As for my drink, lots of water/red bull/coffee.
---
test them during stresstest tomorrow
---
Not being edgy, I just don't think many people if they are being honest with themselves would say vanilla had an enjoyable leveling experience. The end game was quite fun though.
---
"I am personally glad to see a peak 10000 online in one server, which is similar to private server." have fun farming any kind of mats what so ever, having a abysmall AH and server ques going on for hours.  
---
people tend to like this size of servers because Pservers did it and it worked.  
---
SPOILERS: they fucked around with the game a ton that is not even close to blizz like. THINGS that will NOT be in one classic.  
---
So, consider this being private server size BUT, no dynamic respawns for any mobs, so people in Phase 2 who are levling, have fun battling hours for 1 boss quest mobb.  
---
Then there is no 6 min spawn rate for things such as black lotus. You want to craft flasks, unless you have people backing you, your fucked to.  
---
And the community aspect will get so much worse on mega servers (we saw this in wrath prior to the group finder tool was even in the game)  
---
So yes, private server kids, hope your wish comes true for your dream version of wow. It will be a goddamn nightmare once all the fancy Pserver non-blizzlike BS is gone
---
The first handful of dungeons would be easy enough with a shaman. I wouldnt count on it past 30, especially not past 40 when bears get dire and warriors and ....technically paladins...  get plate
---
It's easiest to have Herbalism, then just have a guildie Alchemist make them if you don't want to be an Alchemist yourself (Arc transmute is good money). You will learn what herbs you need, and what routes are good for farming those. Just doing the routes a couple times a week will take care of your raiding needs. You can even sell the ones not used in your classes pots at all and make a bit of money. Eventually you reach a point where you have a big stockpile and you barely need to do that anymore too.
---
The only thing that could make this better from my short overview is if there was an option to use the AtlasMaps. Maps with the actual terrain make it easier to navigate in game while in use.
---
I love the simple design, it looks very sleek and gets right to the point. :)
---
It seems like you haven’t played vanilla before, so let me concur with the other commenter: that 30% movespeed is the best 2 points you will put into your talents before endgame. It’s absurdly useful

Literally the first time in reddit history that happened :P

Most of this, minus the Warlock specific stuff, was discussed in a similar thread earlier today:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cn2hnj/should_i_level_in_night_elf_zones_as_a_human_for/
---
If you were to follow a quest completionist route, (to get the most Darnassus rep from spillover rep from the other Alliance quests) then you would have plenty of chances to stop off at the Warlock trainer.
---
I know Orc is best but I’m really feeling the troll, and since damage seems to be just about even in pve, I think that’s what I’ll go. I’m not as concerned with being stronger in pvp since I’m already combat anyways.
---
Orc is basically the master race for Horde side. The stun resist is just so very strong.   
---
That being said, it's not a spell, so it's not like you will "miss" having the stun resist if you roll a different class.  
---
From a PvE perspective Orcs are superior for warriors because of the axe racial, but for pure PvP you won't go wrong with Tauren, and for pure PvE you won't go wrong with Troll - Orc just happens to have strong bonuses for both.  
---
For Hunter the arguments are basically Troll for PvE and Orc for PvE.
---

I'm sorry lol
---
The average is 10 days so if you’re new add a few days to that. Oh my 2nd 60 I had 16 days played. First 60 was longer. Lots of afk time I reckon but still people will be around those times imo.
---
Well still it is quite longer than MC, and it should def be done while lvling.
---
The ubrs key early in the weeks wont be so easy to obtain !
---
Gotta choose which one to reserve names on tho
---
what's the texas hold'em add on? does it use in game gold?
---
Not following a guide (people who have played vanilla should know all the quest by heart now) and just going to enjoy the game again. Ill just be meal prepping for 2 weeks so that saves me some wasted time. Hoping to get some buddies to come LAN with me haha.
---
I would look for a guild moving from a pserver, from what ive seen elseware and in my own experience, It seems like most of the hardercored guilds have a subsection devoted to PvP
---
Human anything.   You're in this vibrant fantasy world and out of all the choices you picked a regular ass human?
---
pretty neat, cant say id use it unless its make into an addon though
---
How dare he share his experience and opinion. So edgy
---
&gt; No spell power or healing power
---
uhh the set bonus is +28 damage/healing?
---
I mean, he won't break out of prison...  That'd be crazy.  Like, that never happens in WoW.  Totally permanent, like death in Marvel.
---
Nah, it really began in Burning Crusade, or even in Vanilla. Mechanically it just makes sense that the bosses are bigger for targeting reasons and being able to actually see the raid boss and their actions/spells and so on.
---
Illidan was also yuuge. Granted N.E were already pretty beefy and tall. But compared to other Night Elves he was yuuge.
---
You could say the demon metamorphosis made that happen.
---
But then take a look at Kael'thas. Kael was a *blood elf* they are one of the shorter races in the game, but Kael'Thas left leg was the size of a blood elf character model in game.
---
My guild and I will start doing Lbrs 10 mans starting at 58 to get my and my OT ring for Uber spams.
---
I saw Cdew do great in a dueling tournament, I’m assuming he’s a mix of elemental and enhance?
---
Thanks for your input mate! Will probably stick to warlock from what i’ve heard so far, would prefer a tanky caster that can handle the unexpected.
---
I’ve watched some vids again and it’d confirmed that shadow bolt is the hard hitting spell, which feels a bit weird thinking about later expansions, lol.
---
A cast bar and dps/threat meter.
---
I was planning to follow Hakurai's alliance warrior leveling guide..but this just seems so much more user friendly especially if you have two monitors...    
---
Can you talk about what guide you're basing your steps off of for alliance?  As Navak said in the comments his is mostly focused on the horde side.
---
Leatrix Plus (Classic) is the closest I've found. No Auto Dismount or Coin rolls it looks like, but I sent him a message, so we will see haha
---
Contrary to popular opinion (which in this case is dead wrong), Asian WoW player base is not even half of the NA or EU one, since WoD. No wonder that they only get 8 realms.
---
Very few people actually took the time to research about WoW China, in particular, and Asia, in general. China, before WoD, had about 1/3rd if the WoW player base, worldwide. 
---
China had so many WoW players, for 2 reasons : first, they didn't paid a monthly sub, but hourly, to access WoW, and secondly, it was dirt cheap.
---
Two MAJOR changes happened during WoD, for China. First one, at the beginning of WoD, was that the hourly fee for WoW rose 4 times. The second change, took place just months before WoD ended : China allowed for WoW to be on a monthly sub.
---
The impact of these 2 changes was devastating for the WoW Chinese player base : they lost more than HALF of their players, and the fact that WoD sucked balls, only added to this drop. It never recovered since than.
---
Today, WoW China, from being equal to NA or EU player base in the past, is a shadow of it's former self, with numbers that account for maybe 10% of the WoW player base, worldwide.
---
Asia (China, Japan, Korea) accounts for about 15% of the entire WoW player base, while NA and EU share almost equally (EU a bit larger) about 80% of the WoW player base, with AUS and OCE accounting for like 5%.
---
Thanks for this!

You sir are absolutely spot on!
---
Awesome dude, love that you built/tested it yourself! Too many re-hashes of Joanna these days and I do think theirs room for improvement when it comes to just leveling and not powering through content.
---
Good work! Pass on any praise if you have helpers :)
---
I forgot just how insanely long it took to hit cap level in this game
---
Right?  We’d always be able to get a group
---
Fair enough - I have no numbers or anything in front of me, just speculating is all. I was more questioning the usefulness of thorns during the leveling process instead of feral talents. Seems pretty good though with those numbers.
---
#GetDazed boi
---
mi first 60 took me 14 days played, lots of dungeons, pvp and overall enjoying the leveling experience
---
Coffee and nicotine.
---
Website freezes on mobile after clicking start leveling.
---
Haven’t subbed yet :)
---
But it is a "fun little community". There are websites and discords dedicated to it. And back in vanilla - TBC - wotlk the official bliz forums were full of threads trying to organize battlegrounds and arenas for twinks across all brackets.
---
I guess you didn't know about that. 
---
When 60s in full raid gear are camping flight points during phase 2 I'll be sure to tell them Lord-Scrambles (who was a jerk to lowbies in dark souls) approves because their lvl 60 victims have every reason to optimize their characters. That is, if I'm not too busy trying to organize 10v10 twink WSGs in the 49 bracket for phase 3.
---
Probably the logic option, keeping herbs will allow me to level alch pretty fast when i reach 60 and sell low level pots to AH for the alts that are going to pop around that time.
---

---
The same for herbs and devilsaur. That is going to make a huge difference in the economy.

---
Pretty much.  Also try finding a pc sized npc in a crowd of 50+ without a targetting macro.
---
i see how people think this, but in vanilla i NEVER had this problem, lfg somehow made it so much harder to find dedicated groups and players. Im excited for trying to find players running around the dungeon zone or in all chat
---
I can't begin until ~3:00 pdt, wondering if I should even bother subbing for the test or wait until character creation
---
They can OT most raid content from my experience as well.  You’ll probably be made to hold the last mob to die every time, but it’s still tanking.
---
People ask this shit all the time and it’s a stupid question. It all depends. Are you familiar with your class?  Leveling route?  Are you going to do professions?  Do every dungeon?  
---
How the fuck are we supposed to know. 
---
If you just do an optimal leveling route as best you can - even as a warrior - the average player can hit 60 within 6 days played. 
---
If you have no idea what you’re doing and you just run around doing random shit it could take you +20 days played. 
---
What exactly are you asking?  Are you talking if you play optimally and you know what you’re doing?  Are you brand new to wow?  Give us some actual information to go off of.
---
Hell yeah I'm still mogging that shirt on my rogue to this day.
---
There are several items that are unique to their professions. Smoking Heart of the Mountain is a pre-bis druid tanking trinket that's alchemy only. Glimmering Mithril Insignia is a cc break trinket that's Blacksmithing only, etc.
---
It's obviously for Europeans just based on the timing of when it starts.
---
I tried downloadning some from there for a private server, But nothing seemed to work. All of them we’re for newer versions When you pressed on em.
---
Is it me, or?
---
Nah I was just joking how theres only once race per side, but I do kind of like the NE cat form a little more than tauren but I'll just roll whichever my friends end up going.
---
I recommend to look up some guides in youtube. Hybrid classes can heal most dungeons while leveling with appropriate gear at least even when not specced to holy. You should level as retri, you can still heal dungeons while you level.
---
Yeah
---
Only the hunter sees you, so you can still stealth up on everyone else, unlike faerie fire
---
im so tired of these playershaha
---
It'll be slow but you'll certainly have more survivability. You can spec a few points into Ret tree to help with that, and if you have enough gold leveling Engineering does as well (but this is expensive). Otherwise I'd suggest trying to find random people to level with as you go, because it's just much slower and the dps rotation is boring.
---
Boo
---
Appreciate your work on this.  I have been looking for solutions to get the z-engine working again for the merc stealth ever since the Windows fall creator update from a few years back. Did you get what you needed to try and add support for the merc stealth? I attempted to use Fiddler 4, but I am not sure how to use the program.
---
Yes, same for me. If you search for the addons in the Twitch app under "Get More Addons" it finds some of them and will install them but only installs the WoW 8.2.x version to the classic folder.
---
2nd time to me today tbh I have nothing going on at work and i've drunk 3 coffees (think its drunk here...)
---
if they wanted us to do "our" part it would not cost us 12€, they would have made it free to get as much testers as possible.
---
Don't level as holy... I've done it on a 1x xp rate classic private server and it took ages.
---
A lot of zoomers will read this and think you're kidding lol
---
They're great off tanks, and they can main tank as well 95% of raid fights, the problem is warriors just do it better and they have easier access to gear that scales them much more effectively.
---
New models belong in the trash, aka BFA

Sexy jazz was a weird choice but i def want to see more of these, do maraudon!

My previous character was a NE hunter and doing Barrow Den before level 10 (without pet) gave my PTSD haha
---
If you dont care, always go shaman. They are the most needed healer.
---
You’re not wrong and by all means do you, but it’s also not cheap, you can’t really sell your creations. You’ll slow your levelling down drastically by not having a mount at 40, and that would slow your net worth down drastically given the same play time. 
---
I’m going orc warrior tank, skinning/herbal, then I’ll switch to engineering/? once I have my epic mount. You can buy engineering skill ups pretty easy if you can afford it, gotta keep that in mind.
---
I wish the 15ft sylvanas would step on me.

The website freezes after the map loads for me on mobile. Am i the only one having this issue?
---
Wow, that video is the real MVP here...
---
No he probably thinks he would get there in half the time, and he'd be correct. What he's forgetting is that the units used in the game to present attack speed are seconds per swing and not swings per second. The inversion is an important operation.
---
In a car, if you are driving 60mph (or 1 mile/minute, or 1 minute/mile) and you increase your speed 25%, you will be going 75mph, or 1.25 miles/minutes or (and this is where he's messing up his algebra) .8 minutes/mile, not .75 minutes/mile, which is actually 80 mph or a 33.33% increase in speed.
---
That depends on how much time you will be spending to watch porn while alt-tabbed
---
Hi! I plan to do this too.  I did a little testing on a p server to try and get familiar with the zones and pace etc...
---
On mobile...dont mind my awful formatting.
---
A few tips:
---
1) grab flight points in SW, IF, and Theramore.  I missed one in my excitement to get to teldrassil and it made returning to the trainer more of a chore.  Otherwise, training skills in IF isn't too much of a chore.  
---
2) dont train every 2 levels.  Plan which levels you will 100% need to train.  For me, those are any time a new corruption rank is available (levels that end in 4) and those levels where you plan to do important warlock quests.
---
3) get a good wand. I think there is a quest early in Auberdine at level 11 or 13.  Do it asap.  Early on your wand will  be better or on par with your spells which will allow you to skill up less frequently.
---
4) I dont recommend setting hearth to IF as someone else mentioned... it only halves the travel time (you still need to get back to your leveling zone once you skill up!) And if used correctly while leveling it will save you a decent chunk of time.  
---
5) dont stress about every little quest for rep.  There is more than enough quest rep to reach exalted by 40!  This doesnt even count high level zones like feralas that are full of rep.  So if you are stuck on a contested or difficult quest, skip it as long as it's not part of a big chain.
---
I'm still learning so I welcome any more tips/suggestions anyone has!
---
Yeah, because it's quite simple.
---
Thanks! This sounds like a minor inconvenience that I could deal with :D

I thought imp was level 2
---
If you know what you’re doing - even as a warrior - you can very easily hit 60 in 6-7 days /played or less on a fresh server.  The fluctuation largely depends on whether or not you’re on a PvP server and how progressed the server is.
---
shhh dont burst his bubble :D
---
Realistic for most players is 240 hours (10 days played)

most will play on Us servers and try to ruin our economies, as god intended

Navak thank you so much for the reply, I really appreciate it.  Could you give me an estimated /played to 60 using your alliance route?   
---
I'm definitely going to be testing this tomorrow and have joined the discord to give feedback and bug reports.
---
It didn't post my whole post :( retyping on a phone stinks so basically
---
I was wondering if we got them back in classic?
---
I miss using them in battlegrounds. 😏
---
3---------==  Get your pitchforks...  Down with retail.  Blah Blah Blah....  lol
---
i believe it runs from thursday to friday. they said for a lot of people to play during the first two hours though so they could test that
---
Warlock won't be overpopulated. They may not be the preferred caster in a lot of dungeons cause polymorph doesn't cause chain pulls like fear can, but you'll have no problems finding groups. Especially if you're willing to get to the dungeon fast and help summon.  Raiding DPS is limited by threat, but soulstones, healthstones, and banish are sought-after utility.
---
Engineering is a must for serious pvp and pve.  You'll definitely want tailoring during when Bloodvine is BiS.
---
I haven't done Priest in a while so anyone can feel free to correct me, but I think you'd wanna level - Power Word: Shield, Shadow Word: Pain, Mind Blast, Mind Flay (Once you have shadowform), Fear (Optional, it fears more targets at higher ranks), and probably pick one heal to level for healing dungeons, but not all of them, and Renew.
---
Threat meter is damn near required by any competent guild.
---
I generally agree, but the biggest personalities are big enough to cause server disruptions.  Anyone of medium or smaller followings though won't make much of a difference.
---
&gt; You get lost once but after that its EVERY DAM TIME imo.
---
Private server testing my lvl 1 to 20 quest path
---
“We ask that players please log-in and play as much as possible during the first two hours of the test – 11:00 a.m. PDT to 1:00 p.m. PDT, as that is when we’ll be actively monitoring for issues important to launch.”
---
It can still be all day I believe but I guess that’s when they are just monitoring. My apologies then
---
just get a usb mouse + kb and he's good to go.
---
People who use phones to play fortnite do the same thing.
---
Looks like Blizzard can still cater to the chinese mobile market with Classic lol
---
picking up alch at 40 is a great idea !
---
He might have misspoken. Some people get tonguetied when speaking publicly.
---
If blizz is staying true with #nochanges then yes they should be back for classic. Not many people will roll a nightelf priest so you wont see it often. It also doesn't really do enough damage to be a game changer especially in pvp.
---
Two abilities should be enough for anyone. -- Ion Hazzikostas
---
If you miss Velious, check out [Project 1999](www.project1999.com). The blue server only goes up to Velious and has been up for almost a decade. Player count is lower than normal right now because they're releasing a fresh "Green" server in October that stops at Velious again. Given the fact that the blue server had 1500+ players before this announcement, it should attract alot of attention.
---
Yeah I misunderstood the post. Apologies
---
I always thought Shamans were really cool in classic, especially being horde only. I'd go for that.
---
 [https://www.joanasworld.com/speedruns/](https://www.joanasworld.com/speedruns/)
---
Whoaaaaa you're getting racial now dude. Leave that shit at the door.
---
the difference is the lvl 39 guy didn't get those epic / crusader enchant / watheverelse by himself ; his main fed him all that gear. (or your fanboys, as we've seen with streamers during beta)
---
the lvl  60 guys however isn't 'twinked'; it's his own effort through raiding/pvp that got him there.
---
the end result? a naxx geared character facing a fresh 60 in green? yeah, pretty much the same... but a fresh 60 knows there's a lot of progression to be done (outside of level'ing) , the game being a MMO and all...
---
Just spitballing numbers here, but.
---
Lets assume there will be only 8 servers in each of NA, EU, and Asia, and another 8 total between RU and OCE realms. That's 32 total worldwide. If Blizzard believes that there will be only around 1 to 2 million players of Classic globally at launch, then that is around 30,000 to 60,000 players per server.
---
Also assume the layer cap is set to 3,000 to handle the launch day load, and that suggests that there would be between 10 and 20 layers per server. That implies that when layers are switched off they expect to have only around 100,000 players (3,000 \* 32) sticking with the game (give or take depending on the actual max players they have fixed on per layer and for a single realm with no layers).
---
Hard to tell until we see the actual realm list if this is where their heads are at on the numbers. But it's not totally implausible. In theory it shouldn't matter for launch even if 1 to 2 million is wildly underestimating the turnout, since they can presumably just let the layers keep piling up to absorb the load. But if they're way off on the total then it may cause some problems when it comes time to turn them off. Or, if they're smart, which they certainly are, they likely have a reserve of unnamed realms staged and ready to be spun up if things get too far out of control. Obviously they're banking on name reservations as their final reality check to see whether they need to make any last minute adjustments to the hardware schedule.
---
Those may not sound like super mind blowing numbers to the "10 million at launch!" crowd, but look at it in the context of the MMO market as a whole, and it's a launch that loads of MMOs would die for (including plenty that *have* died after doing a hell of a lot worse, on far bigger budgets). These may seem like "worst case numbers" on paper, but in the grand scheme of things it's a huge win, and an objectively fantastically successful game by any measure.
---
No chance. Even with the surveys that included RP-PVP as an option, PVP made up ~70%, PVE made up ~20%, RP-PVP made up ~7%, and RP made up ~3%.
---

---
my man
---
They should have more impressive gear, appearance, etc. though in Classic
---
Blood Elf players make up a disproportionate amount of the RP community in current WoW, as they did in BC too. There's more people willing to PvP/PvE as a bestial Horde race than there are willing to RP as one and try to immerse themselves in that character.
---
Old dungeons required more work then new raids.  DONT @ me!
---
Yeah and those drops to forge the thing are not 100% of the three bosses. I ran lbrs so many times trying to get the last one. Just had really bad luck with the RNG.
---
Never got as far as MT, but I believe it.
---
Scroll down, buddy.  There's been so many posts with addons lately.
---
This is overly done hyperbole, it's more like walking a 2 mile trip instead of driving.  One kind of sucks and takes a longer time but it does the job just fine.
---
If the mouse ain't working then definitely

Yeah that's still over $300 for a mouse. Way over my budget. 
---
Some of the side buttons don't respond anymore and the left click double clicks all the time.
---
I choose Alliance because I don't wanna live in a mud hut without decent plumbing. Haha
---
&gt; So you agree with taking Furor before HOTW?
---
No. Furor should be last. After FFF he should be getting Savage Fury then get the balance talents. Then HOTW/LOTP. Only then get Furor.
---
Starshards wasn't removed until Wrath so you'll be able to use them.
---
Gotcha, I’ll get this deleted. Thanks man
---
I want to build my new "29 fire shaman" twink to test if the build concept is even viable.  So yeah I'll be twinking from "day 1" like many others.
---
But as always, I'll be inevitably buying twink 19,29, and 39 BoE gear and stocking them until they skyrocket in price come BG's in phase 3.
---
You level as ret and take some gear to heal dungeons :)
---
You are wrong
---
We will definitely have much better step saving options. You are right that you can get lost easily. There isn't a way to jump into the guide part way through or to have it save your spot. We will be adding all of that very soon. Thanks for the suggestion.
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
google "willitclassic.com"
---
Yeah two rumors right now that I see commonly going around. The big one is that we are going back to azeroth and they will completely redo the world to bring up the old zones to all BFA standards, we quest through Azeroth as the primary location.
---
Second one that I've been hearing more of lately is a shadowlands idea I outlined above, and that when the heros are stuck in the shadow lands (individual faction zones) the old gods would be running amok in Azeroth proper and that leads into the 10.0 expansion where it's Azeroth redone.
---
I really really really want them to completely redo Azeroth from the 1-60 leveling experience but I do think that is the least likely. Shit isn't even cleaned up from Cata yet so they badly need a pass on all of the zones.
---
Yeah, this is certainly a part of their pre-release hype/marketing cycle.
---
That being said, I'm still gonna play just to see how horrible Durotar can be with 500+ people in it.
---
Pretty sure big streamers will avoid RP servers. I'm not an RPer, but I don't mind other people doing it. So I might give one a try. I imagine server population on RP might stay more consistent instead of a big rush and then rapid drop off.
---
Also it should be “fewer cloth users” not “less cloth users”, but most native english speakers get that wrong as well. 
---
To answer OP’s question - I wouldn’t change classes purely to have better loot distribution while leveling. If you plan to gear up in dungeons at level 60 with these players then the fact that you’re all cloth will slow you down, but if you plan on eventually gearing through raids or pvp, then it won’t hurt much in the long run.

Gonna work through lunch to try and be home at the start!

There was a guy, I think yesterday, advertising for a naked Troll punching guild. My mind is still reeling imagining trying to do that...
---
Can one still make large single player RPGs using this editor?
---
That is true, but I am probably going troll rogue, it’s just what I’ve been feeling from the start, and on horde side I’ll have a slightly higher chance of getting swords since they’re a little more sought after on alliance with human racial, vs orc axe racial. I want to use swords mostly for aesthetic reasons

NDale is shutting down though there was a huge blog post about it on the LH Forums.

I will usually keep it where I am leveling.  Joanas guides go really in depth on leveling routes and he has a good hearth strategy.  Once you progress into higher level zones and get your first mount, sheathing becomes less important I would think.
---
The links they provide for many addons are 8.2 versions for retail. Does this mean they will work for classic despite being 8.2 version?
---
Male Draenei anything  /s
---
I guess the Vanilla equivalent would be male night elf hunter. They're not all bad, it's just the bads are mostly male NE..
---
go ret. save all gear from quests that give intellect when there isn't a upgrade for ur ret gear. even if its cloth or leather, you will want to save it for healing bc armor type does not matter when you are a healer. all you need to heal is intellect, so don't waste any talents into holy early on. just go straight to seal of command. and try to get verigans fist if you can as soon as possible. it is an amazing weapon if you get it in the early 20s.
---
Still. It’s going to be a blood bath.
---
Devilsaur was not on really on dynamic spawn which is why the prices were so high because there was 10x the players for maybe 1.5x devilsaur skin.
---
Herbs were on dynamic spawn with proper blizzlike spawn rate divided by pop multipler.
---
Hey man. Are you ok?
---
I don’t understand what you mean? Only one race per faction can play Druid so you’re technically the best race for your faction!
---
&gt; You should have your pre-BiS and full consumables by then.
---
actually, this DOES sounds like a casual guild. or maybe a 'try-hard' guild would be a more accurate description.
---
the hardcore ones will farm barely enough gear to have a defense-capped tank then jump in MC with wathever mix of quest item and odd dungeon loot they have right at the moment.
---
Never going to happen.  Once the industry found out you can make more money a month by having a million suckers, than having three times as many dedicated players and a good reputation all bets were off.
---
The only hope is some up and coming third party shooting for the moon and making something that's cool before they get bought out.

As the dad you should play resto.

If you haven't heard of [Project 1999](www.project1999.com) check it out, it's locked to Velious and they're releasing a fresh "Green" server in October that will also only go up to Velious.
---
For sure, very good racial. Besides trolling with shadowmeld into MC it's definitely the best consistent racial Alliance has

Avid multiboxer here.  Get ISBoxer.  It’s very easy to setup.
---
I'm still waiting to see what faction my few friends remaining are planning to go. If alliance, it will be a little easier as I would only really be interested in playing a dwarf  priest.
---
Horde on the other hand, I have more trouble deciding. I like troll shaman, or tauren druid. I could do troll priest too, but I think I would rather to the shaman. My goal is to be a healer primarily at 60, would shaman be the best option?
---
Unable to select duo classes on iPhone.
---
&gt; So if I'm right, I should hit 60 on December 17th.
---
That's about when I calculated I would hit 60. I'll probably get more WoW time in than you've allotted but I'm not a fast leveller.
---
That is epic.
---
In your opinion, looking back at dungeon experiences, what classes looked to be the most fun in these dungeons?
---
I'd rather have one or two crouded Rp-PvP servers than 6 ones with a low pop. Two many Rp-PvP servers won't do the community any good.
---
Happily it will be the same as if there are 2 servers; we'll have an unlimited number of 3k pop layers on each server. There'll be no way of telling if a server has 1 layer or 100 layers other than the number of pages on the AH.
---
Warrior and Rogues are highly dependent on weapon upgrades.
---
Hunter / Enhance / Ret come in second, as they have other ways of damaging targets outside of their actual weapon stats.
---
Lastly is Feral druids and casters who's weapon is totally irrelevant. Exceptions being perhaps priests with their dependence on wands for efficient leveling.
---
Yeah, but the same to get Onyxia attuned doing some BRD grinding for BiS items as well to kill two birds with one stone.
---
There's a bit of a "race to 60" mentality but really if I can grind XP for instances that I'd be grinding at 60 for gear, evn though at a bit slower pace, I'm OK with that.
---
The first character I got to level 60 back during Vanilla was approximately 17 days, although I didn't level up in a super efficient way. Realistically, I'm guessing that I could cut that down to around 14 days of play time.
---
I had always more than enough potions from pick pocket
---
What are you talking about? Horde version is tbh  more relaxing than the alliance version.
---
Following that statement you think that level 50 class quests will be in the game aswell?
---
Player characters are called adventurers in lore, not heros
---
Theres no way you are getting exalted at 40.
---
So true man :( i miss the PS2 days
---
Balding hermit classic Fordring is sexier than super paladin ashbringer wrath Fordring.
---
Never tried it with the opposite faction. I just kill them.
---
bow spec is for trolls
---
no problem! just clarifying for anyone who might read this
---
Im not sure if it's the same but atlasloot had lots of items to look up and see how they look
---
Durotar/Barrens/Thousand Needles are basically all dusty desert wastelands.
---
Very fitting for the rough and gruff Horde, but honestly after killing 100 razor-somethings it can get really boring staring at brown/orange for levels 1-30.
---
Undead lands are much more enjoyable IMO but they are also laid out differently and questing takes a reasonable amount longer than Barrens.
---
So your options on Horde are bland brown/orange desert for hours upon hours of play. Or a nicer area with better visual designs but longer questing and longer leveling.
---
Alliance is by far the more enjoyable option.
---
There's a rope for mage, warlock and priest individually :)
---
Here's the priest: https://classicdb.ch/?spell=18456 and warlock: https://classicdb.ch/?spell=18458 version. The priest one is OP as fuck and the warlock one is pretty shite.
---
Ah, I see now. You are correct, that would be my mistake. Thanks for clarifying!
---
Basically, for summons so we can go back to town and sell / upgrade spells etc..
---
&gt;the difference is the lvl 39 guy didn't get those epic / crusader enchant / watheverelse by himself ; his main fed him all that gear. (or your fanboys, as we've seen with streamers during beta)
---
&gt;
---
&gt;the lvl  60 guys however isn't 'twinked'; it's his own effort through raiding/pvp that got him there.
---
Oh, so you dont send mats/gold from your main to your max level alts? You dont ever ask your friends/guildies for help?
---
And plenty of people twink their chars without having a lvl 60 main. You can make a lot of gold with fishing on low lvl char. Plus most of the twink gear isn't even that expensive, and most of the expensive items can be substituted with something cheaper.
---
If anything, twinking is much more accessible and cheaper than trying to pvp at max level, which is part of it's appeal.
---
Why not both?  
---

---
Personally even with my closest friends I could never make it work in vanilla/bc. I'm not a hardcore player and I think it's even more difficult that way. It takes 2-3 months of playing everyday to get to 60. 3 players we talking even more. Average is 150-200 hours, with a group maybe 200-250 hours? That's a lot of waiting around for your friend to log in, today I can't but tomorrow I'll be there.  Level fishing while I'm not there.

Interesting, I was pretty much in full BiS on the light server from BWL through naxx progression as a rogue and I thought it was rising most of that time, but I guess I skipped the MC gear bump (started basically in phase 3) early on and only felt the later rising.
---
So assuming that you have at least a Perdition's/Dragonfang Blade you always want to be Ambushing when you use Vanish. 121.55 was your value for Perdition's damage? How did you come to that number, out of curiosity? Isn't it 73-137 damage?
---
It was the difference between him and the other NPCs that really bothered me. You had Tirion as a skyscraper, Varian standing next to him only up to his like waist but still taller than my night elf, and then a bunch of human NPCs running around at the normal height, just looked bad.
---
Which boss fights do you like?
---
Yeah, a 15-year-old game will be an inspiration for future MMOs... That's exactly why Blizzard doesn't release a new MMO that's worth a damn... to inspire other companies.
---
A Tauren bear form was big enough to cover an entire goblin so could be done as early as level 10 in ratchet. It was hilarious.
---
Some people find it more immersive to play 'themselves' than a fantasy character.
---
I'm having the same debate myself. Hunter is harder to get into the raid but has less competition once it does, shaman will get invited everywhere but there will typically be more.
---
My biggest concern for the shaman is keeping up with the respec costs for healing in PvE and going ele for PvP. I think the shaman is probably more fun as well as better, but just harder to keep up with when it comes to gear and gold.
---
No, but you don't always do that. You almost always frost bolt spam, and nothing but that. The odd time you decurse, but paladin cleanse covers more stuff, so that's a bad comparison anyway.
---
Nothing. It’s a video game. Not something that needs careful planning or mindlessly following a script.
---
Any chance of making this an addon?
---
Yeah i always had Nagas and kept buying them when they broke because i was used to the software/feel of the mouse. 
---
Haven't played WoW in 5 years and switched to a Zowie for the time being. 
---
Just ordered a G600 this time for WoW. Im done with Razer...
---
Warrior Rogue Shaman Mage Warlock is our setup, only con I see is that I will have to share some stuff with lock and sometime shaman but it's no big deal as we'll probably grind the same dungeons anyways.
---
Just ignore the BFA babies.
---
For some reason this disturbed me quite a bit.  Well done.
---
Again we’ve got this down! I work during the day. She takes care of the house and critters. We have dinner. Then we play. If one gets ahead on a chain then we get some grinding time while the other catches up. Might slow us down a touch but it’s not too bad. We’ve done the “on follow” thing many times as well when someone needed a break for something quick.

Login in retail into any 10-20 level character. Or level new one.

This item? It's a bind on equip isn't it? I thought it was this item: 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14153/robe-of-the-void
---
That was pre-raid bis and the reason for taking tailoring before possibly swapping it out.
---
I've played 1-60 before but this is my first time tackling endgame in classic so I'm a bit in the dark.
---
People are really underestimating parry, bears are a lot better then people understand generally atm
---
Not as long as you start away from da voodoo
---
&gt; there are man
---
Besides paladins there is fear ward which just makes many bosses easier.
---
Does the 16 debuff change make warlocks better for raiding? Been stuck on deciding between mage and lock but if this benefits locks for a more fun play style it helps my decision.
---
"Hey guys,  it's really important that you stress our servers at this particular time"
---
\*Schedules time when people have work, taking kids to school or camps, or just generally at possibly the worst time possible to try to coordinate stressing\*
---
Initial NA launch had 89 servers.
---
Only time I kick people in non-raids is when it becomes clear they would rather argue, bitch, or complain than progress through the content we are currently doing. I give them 2 pulls from the time they stop moving. If they aren't doing their job by the end of pull #2 they get the boot. 
---
As long as we are moving forward I'll tolerate open-mic-bong-smoking-pot-heads, politics, racist jokes, drunk blabber mouths, foreign languages, and even crying infants.
---
shame this man only has 4 videos. that was super fun to watch
---
[Smoking Heart of the Mountain] is from Enchanting
---
Imagine being this braindead.
---
Pretty set on mage / lock dualbox but the faction has been creeping up - was alliance vanilla - wotlk and horde since cata.
---
It's hard to go horde since ironforge... but I have a feeling I should go horde.
---
Classic is already using new hardware that even Retail doesn't have. That's what layering is and I bet Blizz is testing it on classic before adding it to Retail in the next X-pac.
---
I would not “kill the Catholics” I would toss a small boy between them and watch them fight to the death
---
addon support back then was still pretty big. they even allowed for you to play healer with a single button in the worst cases. support over the years has increased, but they also squashed a lot of major things, like "if then else" style scripts. but plenty of those addons listed existed back then to some degree, like dbm, a form of quest helper, atlas loot/map stuff, swing timers, the five second rule addon, etc.
---
This is probably why I won't raid in Classic.  I just don't have the same time I had in my early twenties.    I will still have loads of fun doing things I actually never had a chance to do because I was rushed to 60 and raiding.  I missed out on a lot.  Rushed my Benediction /Anathema quest -- this time I won't rush.
---
The main forums are ass.

RPPvP is all I need.
---
Feral DPS vs Rogue (Spec undecided)  
---
I haven't really played rogue that much and I've play Feral a little bit on retail. I am curious what would be the best pick for mostly PVE and then some PVP. I like the appeal of Druids having any role but I've seen everywhere that they are quite sub par and would be harder to gear. As for Rogue I am not sure what I would be getting myself into and how viable each spec is.
---
I am ride or die horde, but Alliance has more varied quest lines and zones.  Duskwood is really good, Alliance human leveling is one of the best, with Gnome/Dwarf second.  Tauren is REALLY good though, and Barrens is quite an awesome quasi-cross faction zone.
---
Human paladins are KILL ON SITE. Male or female. 
---
Also, female night elf hunters are consistently trolling, corpse-camping, microphone reee-ing children. I’m not harboring any anger, promise.
---
It doesn\`t matter the design then when the hardware is exponentially better :) Spawn rates and stuff will be adjusted as we go.
---
I think companies need to scale back the focus on art and spectacle. I have spent thousands of hours playing EvE Online, Runescape, and WoW. 2/3 of those games were created by extremely small studios. The focus needs to be on creating a universe where interesting player interactions happen along with meaningful feeling progession.
---
Looking up to people playing Rune armor got me hooked early on to Runescape, even though it was just a blue recolor of the crappy bronze armor I got right off the bat. The people making MMO's don't understand this and dump too much money into art and spectacle. They all want to be the next fortnite or WoW but don't understand that those games became popular because of unique circumstances that you can't base a business model around replicating.
---
Make cheap subscription based MMO's that can be profitable with only 50k subs, that should be the goal.
---
i did
---
Yeah that could totally work too :)
---
As mentioned in the issues section we don't have the class quests showing correctly. They are there and will be shown correctly for release.
---
Ure right
---
I too do not like things that change the default UI, so I love all of these, but there are 2 addons I just can’t do without that no one ever mentions:
---
Class icons  - something to display the class icon on the portrait. How do people do without it? How do you know who are you fighting against or with (is that a priest or a paladin in cloth gear?). I know the UI displays it if you mouse over them and read the bottom - but to me this is just as important as knowing the target’s health and mana, and thus should be displayed near the target’s health/mana.
---
The other one is some form of cooldown count. I hate the way spell cooldown is displayed with a darkened icon going brighter around like an analog clock and the only way to know is to mouse over the spell to see how much time is left. Just put the damn numbers right on the icon! 30sec CD left? Cool, I now know that, and can plan for it accordingly.
---
People are even working on a spec/gear based on starshards
---
The game comes out in under a month.. you have to pay for a subscription in 20 days anyway. If you’re worried about 20 days of overlap you have bigger issues
---
You'll see a lot lower than than :)
---
It's their pre launch test - they'll want it as close to launch as possible so I'm assuming they wont have 1 or 2 servers up and plenty of layers.
---
&gt; Doesn’t matter if you sub with your credit card or with tokens, the income is *HIGHER for Blizz.
---
Go look at all the faction leaders in Classic.
---
Um... well, you see, my point must have gone over your head, sir. The bird known as AllyPwner is pwning the image of the alliance in the eyes of the horde. The bird kills horde, but pwns alliance by making them all look like angsty fetuses. But it wouldn’t surprise me that a complex exchange of this nature would go over the head of a lowly horde.

My friends and I four manned leveling dungeons in vanilla with a rogue tank. Its really not hard. Only will be an issue maybe around maraudon
---
Yea I had him fill that out before it was even vanillafriends.com - I we didn't even recognize any of the *guilds* let alone players that came up on there. The blizzard post we've already seen 3 guilds we recognized.
---
Please let people play how they want.
---
It's almost as if there are other time zones on planet earth
---
I just want a central or eastern data center server.
---
Bloodvine's set bonus actually requires tailoring https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=421  Non-tailors can equip but only get the stats on the items, not the set bonus.
---
You're correct about robe of the void. You can go tailoring, craft that, then switch off. But since you need to go back for bloodvine, many stay tailoring til that is no longer BiS.
---
And allowing character data to be used for transfers as well as lights-vengeance (think BC for LH, same guy who started lh). Don’t worry they’ll make a comeback too.
---
True I don't even get Less/Fewer correct. Lol
---
It was a fun healer steals pvp kill spell.  I used it as disc/shadow to get myself out of sticky situations.  It was just fun.  I am going super casual this go-round.
---
Real answer : you wait a week to play and look at the analytics
---
Hm. I’m almost not sure if I believe him. I feel like that would be some good bread-n-butter money that’s too good to pass up. Welp, I hope he sticks to his word, or at least announces what server he’s playing on in the case where he changes his mind.
---
&gt;Human paladins are KILL ON SITE.
---
*Laughs in bubblehearth.*
---
I'm going.horde :(
---
Will be dreaming of being a gnome every day tho
---
F in chat
---
Power word shield, shadow word pain, mind blast, and a good wand is all you need to level.
---
&gt;we're all humans (hopefully) and you want to roll a human in this escapism video game? ok
---
Some people say humans have more interesting and nuanced lore than the other races who might fall into the stereotype trap. I also wish other races would've gotten as much in-game lore as humans did.
---
Pretty accurate - a lot of people will laugh and say "a lot faster, more like 6 days" but they are just being ingorant.
---
I say for the average player that hasn't had a ton of vanilla experience their average /played will be 7-12 days.
---
So what I tell my new friends playing is - if you hit 60 in 10 days /played, and played 12 hours each day starting on launch, it would take 20 real life days to hit 60.
---
People in vanilla were bad beyond retarded. Even a complete bigger today has infinitely more mechanical skill and gamesense than any world first raider from 2004.
---
Thank you! I'll be referring to your list in the coming days. Haven't played in 10 years or so! Probably also going to check for e casting bar and titan bar/panel (forgot the names, it's been too long).

A few of the early holy talents seem quite good for dps tbf
---
Yeah definitely agree, that was the point I was trying to make (though you made it more eloquently), doing all this stuff makes sense for ultra-hardcore raiding guilds going for speed-runs and stuff. Like you said, it probably won't be necessary for the average raider.
---
&gt; since they're one of the least interesting races lorewise
---
Why? They've been "around" longer than other races and have all this history from every old Warcraft title.
---
No, 105 is Perdition's Blade's damage.
---
121.55 is the Attack Power modifier = AP / 14 * 1.7
---
Thanks for your reply:) I’m still unsure what a role player is. Is that someone who sticks to their role as either heals,dps, or tank? Thanks again for the info I appreciate it
---
Lol don't lie to the poor guy
---
Heck yeah.  Cloak of Rocks, kickass beards, thunder thighs - what's not to like?
---
what does jabaited mean ?
---
I am not saying people will act differently, I am literally telling you there is correlation between streamers and realm economy. Nothing in live leads to that conclusion, so why would Classic? If anything you literally have proven my point for me, people will not act differently.
---
Which spec has two abilities on retail? And for boss fights specifically that's twice as many abilities as a lot of classes use in vanilla. 
---
I love the shit out of classic, especially the dungeons, but 90% of the bosses are stupidly easy, even before gear. The joy of those dungeons is the trip to get to the bosses.
---
First they kidney shotted the cloth wearers, but I did not speak out because I was not a cloth wearer
---
Next they kidney shotted the leather wearers, but I did not speak out because I was not a leather wearer
---
And now I hear the unstealth sound I have nobody to ask for help
---
One thing I find is very apparent with classic compared to modern WoW and ESO (the current MMOs I have played) is that you very quickly feel invested in your character.
---
You can feel yourself getting stronger. Modern MMOs just have numbers that don't really represent anything. The scaling just makes the numbers feel meaningless, and it makes progression feel like a treadmill rather than a journey.
---
Troll mage...??? Right?
---
Agreed. Hardly anyone BGs pre-60. The X9 battle grounds are MORE fair, since the gear is pretty much capped. The particular level point is more of a personal choice of skill selection and pace of play.
---
Even in Classic, Archbishop Benedictus is taller than a night elf. IMMERSION RUINED, UNSUBBING
---
Garbage...rofl
---
Ironforge was also the most valuable city in vanilla. It's the closest one to all the Blackrock raids. Later there's AQ but it's just two raid dungeons and it's also a long way for horde players. 
---
(Ultrasafe Transporter: Gadgetzan ftw, engineer best profession)
---
I could do this once a year for sure.
---
Since we're on this topic, what about for someone that doesn't intend to PvP much, if at all? I plan to raid as Fury DPS/OT, and tank 5 mans in the same spec. I was originally going to pick Orc, but I'm curious of there's a better option for my style of play. I know Trolls racials are great for the tanking part, but is that worth giving up the Axe spec/the rest of the Orc racials? Does Tauren's melee range and stun have any impact at all in PvE?
---
Maybe at max efficiency and really micromanaging logouts to keep that time down. But that doesn't refute the overall point though. A human playing the game and still doing normal human things (e.g. sleeping), even with having time to just play the game, will not be 60 and ready to raid week 1. Week 2, sure. But that's still only going to be like the top &lt;1% of players. Rest of the regular people aren't going to be hitting 60 until month 2 or later.
---
I might use huel too. Then canned tuna and mackerel. Salat and some chicken breast. Gym each morning. Every 3 to 5 hours go for 30 min walk. Can't grind if I get a blood clot and die.
---
If I could choose exactly 2 addons to use: WA and TSM.
---
Haha. Better than nothing!
---
See how that combat responsiveness is with this scuffed version of spell batching.  It was NEVER this bad in retail classic.
---
60 fps at what settings ?
---
Probably.  Most of those send you to the Sunken Temple.  The only things I can see not being in the game in P1 is anything to do with Dire Maul and the updated loot tables (the added items at least) from the naxx patch.
---
Ah gotcha. Testing with Barman Shanker seems to give Backstab as higher damage, so some point between prebis and phase 3 you want to transition. Maybe with gutgore?
---
You should do research on Elder Scrolls Online, Final Fantasy 14, and Black Desert Online to accurately predict the MMO genre's future
---
I mean, it's definitely going to be better than their other ~~casino games~~ microtransaction-riddled masterpieces.
---
Remember, technology has gone a far way since 2005 :D
---
Truly hardcore players can go a week without sleep on launch
---
They don't exist! But no really we just forgot them in the dropdown. It'll get added asap.
---
It was already justified as a quality of like change.  Shame it was never in vanilla, so it won't be in classic.
---
But stitches smells like shit and also walking increasing likelihood of pvp lowering min max autism gains also if you furiously tap w instead of holding it you actually walk .1% faster
---
Level 20 ezzzzz
---
Yep.  already signed up.  But they too need to know about it.  The forum is a bit more centralized and isn't 3rd party.
---
This has me reconsidering. I was initially planning on pally but switched to priest because pally leveling looked slow, boring and repetitive. Do you think the difference might not be that great?
---
But the XP is cursed.
---
&gt; The AH is outside, so you can stay mounted.
---
True vanilla doesn't have any AH outside OG and SW! /s
---
The more the better - means a good economy!
---
I think that’s a valid concern, but it’s significantly different than the claim that the system is “more often abused than not”.
---
Right, but! (And hear me out).
---
You can go AFK on the flightpath...
---
Seems to have issues on mobile.
---
Going forward with just 8 servers sounds like a disaster.
---
8 servers across 4 types? Lets assume then its 2 each - so East and West?
---
This makes you chances of avoiding big name streamers and their goons virtually zero.
---
Very nice. Thanks for sharing !
---
AHs in the other cities existed before they were connected. I didn't play at release so I can't say for certain they always existed, but there was definitely a time when Undercity and Thunder Bluff had separate AHs that almost no one used.
---
Not when the EU Article 13 provisions kick in early next year. Western countries are going to start allowing companies with copyright claims to deal directly with your ISP. If there's a legitimate claim, your access to that offending site/server gets blocked no matter where it's hosted. Soon, the only way to play on a Private Server is for those servers to be hosted in a 3rd world country and for all its users to pay for a VPN inside that country. And if that hosting ISP does any business outside their country or hosts other companies that do business outside their country, that still won't work.
---
Tauren Druids aren’t hot? 😢 
---
*cries in /moo*
---
Around 250 hours. I think I will be 60 close to phase 2 because of limited play time (3-4 hour a day)
---
Not if the mobs are grey, and it also slows you down a lot
---
Going mage for my main but you level feral as a druid usually anyway its only end game / raids you go resto which, again, most people wont get to anyway soooooooooooooo yeah my alt will go feral likely. can do all 5 man content with the build so \*shrug\*. dont get the hate
---
Its 2004, lord of the rings is still at the height of its power.  Naturally I rolled a Dwarf named Balin.  The paladin part came from WC3 playing against humans online.
---
Those are just the ones who let themselves be summoned by warlocks every. single. time.
---
Most tanks were arms or fury exactly because of the high cost. This whole spec identity was just not a thing back then. It was more about how many points in each tree and which talents you take, but your identity was your class. No one liked the cost of spec in vanilla. If you think they did you simply just didn't play back then
---
What is the time for the stress test?
---
Does it start today in NA or tomorrow?
---
The absolute insane world PvP battles that I experienced on Nost/Ely more than make up for the other shit you've mentioned, although I can see why players who don't care about pvp may not be too happy.
---
Heck, recently-ish in Battle for Azeroth someone used a model edit to replace all Anchor Weed (the equivalent of Black Lotus, rare herb worth a metric butt-ton) with an incredibly large boss model. That made all the Anchor Weed super easy to find and visible from quite a distance
---
Also in no way accurate
---
No, it's because wow has no unit collision.
---
Properly worded question imo because we need most of them. I believe you can skip mind flay until rank 2 is available and even then you want shadow form. This is what I remember hearing from others but I don't level as shadow so you'll want to confirm. You can probably stop buying new ranks of smite once holy fire is available because it has a dot and the cast time shouldn't matter in most situations if you open with it. Skip all rez spells after rank 1. Psychic scream is optional but I find quite useful if I pull too many mobs, get attacked by alliance, or the tank can't keep dungeon mobs off me. I personally skip flash heal because the mana cost makes it hard to justify casting it during leveling. Mind blast is OK but not essential if you really want to save money. You should be able to holy fire, swp, wand mobs. Mind blast can be fit in before the wanding for extra damage but again it depends how many pennies you want to pinch.
---
The danger of having a dead server is pretty high tho if you have so many. They can always put more servers up if need be.
---
They changed WoW folder structure in anticipation of Classic. Nearly everything that used to be in the root \\World of Warcraft\\ folder is now in \\World of Warcraft\\_retail_\\. (Hence forth I'll shorten the root folder to WoW).
---
For example, the addons folder moved from \\WoW\\Interface\\AddOns to \\WoW\\_retail_\\Interface\\AddOns. 
---
Classic installs its specific files into \\WoW\\_classic\\. So its addons go into \\WoW\\_classic_\\Interface\\AddOns.
---
This also applied to the Classic beta which was in _classic_beta_ or some such (can't double check the exact name as I'm at work). I think this also applies to retail PTRs but haven't checked.
---
People misspeak all the time. Until it's confirmed I wouldn't get hopes up too high.
---
The fact he may have misspoke may provoke another response / dialog from Blizzard on the subject though.
---
Good to see more! Great video as always
---
Rogues are very low dps while leveling they have no aoe, nothing comes close to Hunter dps in leveling dungeons. I have been playing vanilla for years and have been top dps in literally every dungeon I've ran bar none there's just no comparison I do 40+% of the groups damage at all times you must be playing in very early level dungeons and with bad players.
---
Did not know that thanks for sharing
---
It's not hate it's just that resto is the raid spec for druids
---
Technically you gain less from mobs, but for drop quests you will need to kill more. Also a group should steam through quests faster and also doing dungeons when they feel like it.
---
he said maxed settings
---
I missed that. I can’t see them doing 10k peaks and being ok with it. I would imagine queues would start at 5k. Guess I should watch the video.
---
Horde doesn't really have a good exploration route, you wont find one better than Alliance. 
---
From Duro you can go up to Org, then down through barrens and TB, maybe grab dustwallow + 1000 needles. Hearth/FP back up to Org and fly to UC, Tristfal &gt; Silverpine &gt; Hilsbrad and work your way down to STV OR start at STV and work your way up. 
---
It doesn't really work on PvP servers either because Kalimdor is extremely sub-optimal to explore and you have to go through too many Alliance heavy zones in Eastern Kingdoms to make it worth while.
---
From Durotar if you use the hidden path down to Rachet and then get to TB and maybe try to ding to level 5 from running through mulgore+exploration, hearth back to Durotar and *maybe* you can get out and skip some quests to get ahead of the curve. 
---
It's probably just easier to slog through to level 5 in the starting area and then take 2-3 people and quest together to try and skip some quests (get to the barrens around LvL 8).
---
They’ve read a bunch of speculation on reddit, duh.
---
Hunters would be the only choice. No other classes uses guns or bows as a weapon.
---
looool
---
Amazin. Thank you.
---
Oh well of course not lol
---
MC and BWL yes. In aq and naxx you Fireball spam :)
---
I picked hunter because I thought the wc3 rifleman was cool, and back then I was a CoD kid so I enjoyed shooting things
---
3 weeks is casual to some guilds...
---
Leveling in 1 month is hardcore to the guy who levels in 2 months.
---
The proper term is x is more hardcore than y
---
If its only 8 severs for NA then it's going to be fucking awesome at 60 for wpvp. Everything everywhere is going to be contested.
---
For anyone that doesn't get it, this\^^ is the woman in the picture.
---
I swear you must get notified every time this gets linked.
---
And are expert devops people because they overclocked their videocard once
---
You should buy a new laptop. Under 60fps at max settings is unacceptable.
---
Not it isn't. That's why the reduced it and out in dual spec because it sucked and no one liked it. Like, did you even play vanilla? I already had to farm for a couple hours just to afford a raid night.
---
Where are you farming 65k gold per hour in Retail?
---
Bags are rare in Classic!? In Beta by the time I hit 10 I had already given away at least 5x 6 slot bags to ransoms.
---
Don’t even think Taurens can get exalted with TB without cloth.
---
Agreed lol...
---
probably. in 40 mans, yeah probably lower it to the next notch down. test it out on the next stress test (minus the raids obviously) and figure out what settings your computer works best with then :)
---
It's a 2004 game? So it will run flat out easy
---
Yeah, druid was on my list for awhile. The main issue I have with them is that even on retail it felt like I was fighting the class instead of playing it with all the macros and form switching. Keeping track of which hotkeys were where and could only be used in certain forms got frustrating.
---
I dunno.... I might be totally wrong with this, but a doing a quick guesstimation comparing sub numbers and server totals during vanilla it puts them at well above 10k total players on average.
---
Having played on a 20k pserver I can't say it felt overcrowded compared to a popular Blizz server.
---
If they have one RP-PvP server that server is going to be pretty damn populated.
---
Yes it’s confirmed
---
Look up enh shammy guides, they will go into it better than I could, but I'll give it a shot.
---
TT is deploying your winfury and grace of air totems in tandem. It keeps wf and goa up for max time with min use of mana. It is the best thing you have to offer the raid or dungeon group, other than off healing until mana gone.
---
It's not the same system requirements however that rig will run maxed. Out of raids but in a 40 man there's no way
---
Actually I’ve heard that when honor is out there is ways to farm honor by killing faction leaders. 
---
Heard it may be exclusively killing Tauren leader for alliance and night elf leader for horde. 
---
Some how you can get a bunch of honor for their kills
---
cash grab wouldn't be based around a monthly subscription, that makes no sense.
---
Rogue Druid hunter with mining can make fortunes doing thorium runs when dire maul comes out. 
---
For pure cloth farming though I’d give it to the hunter. Unless you find a spot that you can consistently AOE. Then it’s mage.
---
https://blizzardwatch.com/2019/08/06/wow-classic-getting-one-stress-test-launch/
---
All you private server people don't know what you're talking about. Just keeping up repairs for raids took farming.
---
For a very long time I only ever used specific addons over WA. I only ended up using WA for a really good shadow priest insanity bar WA, which at the start of BFA became its own standalone addon.
---
It's just not really necessary.
---
Sharded cross realms battlegrounds that auto complete in 20min is confirmed
---
I’m both excited and nervous for this. I’ve got two little girls (newborn, 2 year old). I can’t spend 3-4 hours uninterrupted on one task unless it’s really late... but you parents out there know that it’s hard to stay up really late when you have kids. Sleep is precious. 
---
Anyway, I’m really excited for the social part of the game. Just hoping to find like minded folks who don’t mind playing for just an hour here and there.
---
Ya the worst part is if you lose even 1-2 ticks from being hit. It's the best two ticks :( which totally sucks. So the damage output of it, is impacted far more than say arcane missiles or mind flay.
---
I second this
---
At the end of the day it's whether you hate getting blinded or rooted more when it comes to warriors and world pvp. Though I think if you're going to go ham and do pre-made bgs then Dwarf is *probably* the best option overall. That being said there are some great aspects to shadowmeld as well which make it pretty fun, but then I'd have to be a nelf.
---
Ok. I was just confused because Blizzard said the 27th is Classics release but it's actually launching on the 26th in NA.
---
I wanted to make sure the 8th isn't actually tonight (the 7th) sometime.
---
Blizzard fails sometimes at their dates.
---
How I wish EU had Classic forums...
---
It's a fact that group leveling is much slower. There's no denying it. I would still do it without hesitation with my friends if it was remotely possible for us. I just never been able to do it, there's always someone who want/can level faster at some point. I'll just finish this quest, I'll just do one dungeon. It seem like an easy thing but again, 3-4 months, playing every single day.
---
*goes back to previous statement about how majority of the player base will never reach that point* Queue endless loop.
---
Rofl. I live in NYC, my commute is over an hour each way.
---
Tauren have no bonus for pve other than 5% hp. If you're going fury dps/ot go orc for sure. Troll is only better if you're main tank and have a thunderfury. 
---
Some of the best weapons you can get are axes.
---
I played druid in vanilla, raided MC etc, I ended up feeling like an enervate bot.  Are you looking at pve or pvp?
---
What you described is layering, without hopping to your friends.
---
Most likely 4 pvp, 2 pve, 1 rp and 1 rp pvp
---
RemindMe! 19 Days
---
Looks very nice. I appreciate the work put into stuff like this, but I personally have no interest in leveling guides unless there's an addon component to it. As it stands, I'll be using Azeroth Autopilot at launch.
---
Basically. I missed it in BC but I could justify it a little locking exp at 60 or revisiting old content that wasn’t a complete steamroll. Once they changed the old world it set in that we were never going back.
---
Now we are going back so... YAY!!!
---
Small how?  Not enough girth?  Or is length an issue too
---
There are ~800,000 people playing WoW in China right now, at 2:47AM their time. That first link is updated on what I think is hourly intervals (reading their code is too difficult for me to confirm, but I've seen it change twice since I started posting in this thread).
---
~600,000 characters (including alts) were seen on Americas+Oceania in the last 30 days. That's NA, CA, SA, SEA, AUS, and NZ.
---
I agree and idk why. With wow classic everything feels important and worth it. Blue gear is amazing! Everything is hard and every bit matters.
---
All the other stress tests started at the same time tho?
---
True. I definitely underestimate how progression will be different this time around since we've done it already
---
&gt; This means even in phase 2 when the layers are no long exists, there should be more players in one server than the numbers in 2005. I am personally glad to see a peak 10000 online in one server
---
You can bet they'll keep layering permanently if it comes to this.
---
Yeah Enhancement is completely gimped in Vanilla, it's garbage pve dps and if you play anyone even half decent in pvp you will get kited to death with ease (they are literally the easiest class to kill on my Hunter I actually feel bad killing them they are that bad, and I am a Shaman at heart)
---
well yeah but this is a place mostly filled with serious players
---
not rando casuals that will quit month two
---
not really worth considering those folks
---
\&gt;I can forgive it in raids as it's easier mechanics-wise, but it always broke my immersion a bit when you're just out in the world to see a 15ft Sylvanas.  
---
You're losing the point, as an alliance player, Sylvana IS A RAID TARGER
---
Exactly. 
---
But it also addresses character name restrictions and minimizes damage to the economy. The very reason people are against layering is strictly because of the hopping.
---
how does that not answer your question?  The article says "the last stress test for WoW Classic will take place on Thursday, August 8 at 11 a.m. PDT, and it will last until Friday, August 9"
---
what more are you looking for?
---
Drood farms the shit out of whatever it wants.
---
I doubt there's only going to be one EU PvP server. That seems highly unlikely
---
I wouldn't consider it subjective. Who is going to argue getting world buffs is a fun process?
---
Maybe they want to do it right this time. I would guess they are trying to make a successful game.
---
Doing big DPS with them is fun, but they are an annoyance. You end up spending more time gathering world buffs before the raid than you do in the raid. If something goes wrong and you die during the raid (like losing the Vael lottery), you're essentially done for the night as you simply cannot compete without World Buffs against those who do. This makes deaths very tilting. A wipe (especially early) will sour the mood even more, as you just spent 45 minutes x 40 people gathering all these world buffs for someone to fuck up kiting on Razorgore. It also further trivializes already trivial content. My last private server we had several (at the time) world records for boss kills. We are talking Shazzrah in 9 seconds, Vael in 15 seconds, etc.
---
Indeed. I wonder if streamers will switch away from their dumpster-fire toxic communities and join the good servers though. Queues are super-important, as they really discourage new players from joining an already popular server because they aren't yet invested in it.
---
Jesus christ thats a lot of hanzi
---
This will be happening after 2-3 days let alone a week.
---
Panago - chicken club pizza but check thiz, extra cheese extra sauce and add extra jalapeno. This shit is my secret recipe "The Orgasm" straight outta Victoria playa
---
-You're Welcome
---
Makes no sense. Cash shop would ruin the whole appeal... you're just stupid lmao. They have a huge cash shop and player base in retail and having classic wouldnt add much to that.
---
What do you mean by "future MMOs"?  &gt;_&gt;
---
&gt;I've seen cars with Alliance stickers on the back of them as well as Horde.
---
Literally tribalism.
---
Absolutely hated it when they started making models over sized. It just looked stupid.
---
The layers might solve population problems, but it completely ruins the #1 most important thing about classic: A single cohesive world.
---
If they are only going with 8 servers, you can bet they'll keep layering indefinitely, no matter how much they try to convince you they'll be gone in a couple weeks.
---
Druid and Rogue are the best herbalism farmers as they don't need to tangle with mobs. **For skinning/ cloth farming the best is Mage. That said the melee leeway of classic makes this something you need to practice and master.  If you want to face roll farm, Hunter is the way to go.**
---
Go watch Punkrat's video on how to choose a server.
---
I second this so much. I've had 3 razer nagas my last being a chroma. They don't last, they mess up and they suck.
---
The G600 is awesome it took 10 minutes for me to get used to it and within those 10 minutes I already knew I liked it twice as much, get the g600 man. Not only is it better it's CHEAPER.
---
Hope the bot dosent nuke this, its rather amusing
---
We have been heavily debating a trace route between objectives, however, it presents unique challenges. A lot of lines are rendered across impassable terrain, mountains, rivers, lakes, etc. We considered doing manual traces of where to walk, of course this takes time. We're looking into options though for now will likely leave.
---
I think a repository for personal notes and route information would be cool and is a unique idea. We're still working heavily on the tool as well as accompanying features. Stay tuned fo
---
r future updates.
---
Okey i ok lets put it like this. I play bfa on setting 6 and all options on good/high. I have 60 fps all the time and dropping to 40 in raids. 
---
I played the classic stress test on 8 and all on high with 120 fps leveling. 
---
Do you think the laptop can hold the fps in dungeons and raids if i lower the settings abit?
---
Dawg you gotta read the community rules about low effort memes. It's funny and true tho have an upvote
---
NO
---
I was only minorly hyped and doing my best to keep hype levels to a minimum. Played around on private servers just to get a little refresher but didn't play too much, that helped scratch the itch a bit.
---
But now that we are in August and the last month is upon us, character creation is in a few days with realm names coming out?
---
I'm bursting at the seams I need this so bad right now.
---
It’s doable, with a remote access app on your phone and pc. I used to do it to play hearthstone on my iPhone before they released the mobile app.
---
He's 6'5" for comparison
---
Sweet, thank you!
---
This, but unironically.
---
Um, Classic already has been an inspiration for future MMOs... fifteen years ago.
---
Love every time these come out. Thanks for continuing the amazing work, Josh!
---
Sounds like my warrior lol.   
---
1 arms, 2 def, 3 fury, when in arms 1 charges, when in fury 3 intercepts, and 2 in def shield block.   
---
And like all of my stances matches perfectly its an art, also takes me 1 hour to fully setup in priv servers instant 60, big hassle but worth it.
---
I don’t believe Blizzard wants any of this to be possible via mobile. I know that the mobile auction house from way back majorly impacted the in-game economy.
---
You're absolutely right.
---
Exactly, on top of that the groups dps loss of having you in it does hurt the Raid overall. Having a Restoration shaman in the group is actually much better overall which is sad I know but this is why Enhancement and other support specs are not viable they simply don't do enough damage OR more importantly don't bring enough utility to a raid to offset the lack of damage. (this was fixed in TBC)
---
I dont think anyone ever said druid bad
---
just other classes do same job better than druid
---
It is doable. You will need a partnered app though such as Gforce Now or Stadia. You can easily level/ quest. Raiding/ PVP is harder as there is a greater latency delay. 
---
Hope this helps!
---
Hey there it is, the original got taken down for this.
---
Currently has several mobile bugs
---
&gt; a layer is supposed to emulate a vanilla server environment
---
That's how it should've been implemented, but it's not. Layers are not independent. You can switch layers, you can talk to people on other layers, and they share the economy. It's just layering with sunglasses on.
---
Yeah when I said region I meant language. Not one for the whole EU obviously.
---
I saw my friend playing and watched a guy running by in the distance just turn into a bear.  Around lv 35 I got destroyed by a rogue so then I made a rogue.
---
I have two other systems, a 2600x w/1080ti, and i5-3570k w/SLI 660ti 3gb.   
---
I though about moving the i5 system, but I got serious desk cable management I don't want to undo lol.
---
So this is just for convience, hence the low price I'm shooting for.
---
As much as mages may complain about leeway interfering with aoe form the fact that dungeon mob experience is higher than expected is very very promising for gold and xp farming post level 45
---
At one point I had one that replaced the Forsaken models with the Chinese versions (just the player/npc models, it didn't turn everything into bread), so that my armor could have sleeves. If anyone knows where to find that please let me know.
---
Traveling around WoW with your friends and guild is a good time.
---
I hope they do. I don’t play on PvP servers, but I know there’s a lot of people who want RP-PvP, and I hope they get it. I just want them to temper their expectations.
---
Druid (tank), Warrior, Rogue, Pally (heal) and a mage it will my composition most of the time
---
They'll just keep layering instead of having 10000 players at once.
---
Who is she though?
---
It is possible to get a remote desktop going but it's too small and laggy just toish.
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
I know you guys have your own site etc. Have you thought about partnering with the guy who did https://www.vanilla-questing.me/ though? I like your guides, but his site seems to have a lot of the functionality/polish that you guys are missing. 
---
Definitely appreciate the effort though, seems like leveling resources will be plentiful.
---
Hi, /u/Cudid
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cn9y51/3050_hogs_attack_you_in_elwynn_forest_while/). 
---
For what it’s worth I remember cone of cold being garbage in vanilla. Whiffing with it the majority of the time is definitely part of recapturing the mage vanilla experience haha.
---
why not just play one one of them?
---
Im confused
---
I'm gonna start working on my level 1 bank alt twink immediately after release.
---
Serious talk, there will definitely be people who will have their twinks ready in time for BG launch.
---
Vanilla was designed with 3k player cap in mind, if we get 10k server it's a complete different experience.
---
&gt; The dominate pvp faction has changed through the years depending on racial balance.
---
"Every man for himself" was the most overpowered pvp racial. Anyone who wanted to be on the top (and had a class that could be human) had very little choice but to switch to human. BG win rates aren't as important as this as the the number of gladiators.
---
Disorientated.
---
Sounds great and cant wait for more!
---
Hey man, thanks for the kind words :)
---
If you’re going to be mostly casual, I would suggest herb/skinning and drop skinning for alchemy. On top of that, I would say to take alch sooner than later.
---
The main reason i suggest this is because alchemy is going to feel the most useful throughout the leveling experience. You’ll always get utility at every point throughout 1-60. 
---
Tailoring is also great for the leveling experience, but I don’t think it’s as consistently useful as alchemy for leveling. For example, there are only a couple of stand-out patterns for tailoring that you will use for multiple levels (Robes of Power), where you will find potions and elixirs helpful throughout all of alchemy. 
---
Last point here, but Warlocks don’t get as much utility from their tailoring 300 BoP robes as other classes. The Robes of The Void are still great, but you’ll replace them sooner than later.
---
Idk, I liked the WotLK Sylvannas and Alexstraza

Feral and Rogue are going to be relatively hard to gear. Feral, more so than Swords/Dagger Rogue. As a Feral you will be competing with Warriors and Rogues on BiS gear and that can be a huge deterrent since both are very popular classes and are arguably better when it comes to DPS. Although, if your are determined to play Feral there is a good chance that there will be many casual guilds looking for warm bodies and you will eventually get the gear your looking for. If you go Resto/Feral Tank you will have a much easier time gearing. However, that might not be the playstyle your looking for. As far as spec viability goes. Most Rogues go Combat Swords for PvE and a Hemo Dagger build for PvP. Both are very good. Druids are great healers and off-tanks, but lack in the DPS department. Honestly, end game shouldn't be a huge worry since most of your time will be spent leveling. I would give both a try, if you have an active sub, this Thursday and get a feel of how both play. Which ever feels the best just pick up that class.
---
The moment I got endgame in TBC and realized the world pvp sucked and was nothing like it was in classic due to flying. 
---
I guess camping daily quest areas and killing those people was kind of fun, but it didn't feel as spontaneous.
---
So because it’s not fun it should be disabled? Ok.
---
Sorry but to be blunt you have no idea what you are talking about, the only time people thought Shaman were op was when they actually were due to Frostshock having no diminishing returns and Windfury being able to actually proc off Windfury. Guess what? Classic is running off 1.12 in which Enhancement is garbage in both pve and pvp, Windfury is nerfed.
---
I was in so many runs where someone would accidentally fall into the giant pit in the middle. The whole was like a magnet for people for some reason.
---
Laptop would be harder to use, small keyboard, small screen that would be vibrating with treadmill etc. That thought crossed my mind.
---
I just wasn't sure if any them stuck to the rules of nothing older than Vanilla.
---
&gt; on the other I remember being jealous of all the low alliance queue times that I heard rumors of back in the day
---
I heard there will be cross realm queue times so those will be short anyways.
---
they aren't doing dynamic respawns, jesus how do none of you understand how layering works, the amount of servers is irrelevant they will adjust the amount of layers to a normal realm size, it won't be over 5k at a guess per layer
---
School is started where I live.
---
:') hope
---
Batman is human and if you can be anything you want you should always chose batman. I have no idea what my point is either.
---
You really think they'll remove layering? I highly highly doubt that's every going to happen, regardless of what they claim.
---
Is doing corpse runs a fun process? Maybe we should make everyone immortal then.
---
Is farming consumables a fun process? Maybe we should remove them from the game.
---
Is being stuck on a flight path for 5+ minutes a fun process? Maybe we should replace them with teleports.
---
Hi Navak/Egregious!
---
A couple things I noticed leafing through the solo Orc Hunter guide:
---
1. The guide does not indicate how to complete the level 10 Hunter quests (pet taming).
---
2. Steps 14-18/18 (the final five steps in the current guide, beginning after the player loots Chen's Keg on his/her way to Crossroads) do not make sense.
---
Cheers!
---
Feel
---
I hear a stress test is gonna happen tomorrow, will the progress be saved? 
---
I'd rather get a full month of classic than have to pay early and waste 2 weeks of membership (I'm cheap).
---
Doesn't mean that's a good practice
---
Cant wait to try to solo them with my warrior... And die...
---
 These are the generic minimum settings and its massively low specced compared to modern gaming rigs so you should have zero issue's running at max.

---
* GPU: Nvidia GeForce 8800 GT 512MB or AMD Radeon HD 4850 512MB or Intel HD Graphics 4000
---
* RAM: 2GB (4 GB for integrated graphics such as Intel HD Graphics series)
---
* Storage: 5GB available space

* Resolution: 1024 x 768 minimum display resolution
---
Or maybe when heating up your hotpockets 
---
Obviously you'd only do 2:50 at a time
---
I'm considering rolling a nf hunter, but the expenses on ammo, food etc. Is hard for someone who loves hordeing gold. I'm not worried about the raid spot, because everyone needs a hunter with tranq shot even in nax. 
---
BUT! Mages are so awesome with portals, free food and drinks, huge dps and awesome spells! Same goes for warlocks.. so I guess I will level them all to 30 and then decide what to level to 60. It's not a race anyway :)
---
2 weeks of PTO already scheduled, baby!
---
I do it with chrome remote desktop and it's fine for playing the AH. I haven't tried fishing as it's a bit broken on pservers (usually ends in last second) but it should be fine.
---
Gnomish Cloaking Device? It's a trinket with a 1 hour cooldown, that gives invisibility rather than stealth.
---
No res while leveling and doing dungeons will be really sad
---
!RemindMe 1 year
---
don't go druid if you want to heal. very few slots allocated to druids
---
Lol op just wait for classic. The Druid naysayers will be proven wrong. Find a good pserver guild on your classic server. They’ll probably have ferals in their raid.
---
I really think they will. Multiple devs have promised it. They understand the issue with it being in past phase 2. Which is why phase 2 is the hard-line for it.
---
Tomorrow at 2PM EST.
---
Isn't the point of layering just to smooth out the launch experience so it's less of a clusterfuck?
---

---
&gt; So at the very least, both will get a PvE and PvP server
---
Did they confirm that? I figure they'll probably just go with one or the other, whichever seems more popular.
---
So you'll have, for example, English PVE, English PVP, French PVP, German PVP, and maybe a generic RP server.
---
Question: dwarf hunter, step 18/38 stage 5 "wetland wallclimb". Climb the mountains and go die over the border so we can spirit ress in wetlands and get the meth harbour flight point? Clever. Saves a very long multi death/corpse run. Is there a video or where and how we climb this wall?
---
 This will be one of the things I'll practise on the stress test. If there isn't a video guide of it made I guess I could make one when I practise it? what are the co-ords to start the climb?
---
yikes
---
Just to clarify, the reason you're probably confused about WotLK is because China delayed the release of WotLK massively. The Chinese government bans a lot of elements in games, and one of them in particular is things like skulls and skeletons. Basically the entire main theme of WotLK was just a huge no-no over there, which is why it took until two years(!) after the NA/EU release of WotLK for them to actually get WotLK, as essentially the entire freaking game had to be censored.
---
I'd recommend pair the check mark with an opacity filter. That way you're not trying to line up which step you have checked instead it's as simple as which one is the brightest. Another recommendation is I'd have the minimap steps disappear if they're marked as completed.   
---
No reason to clutter up the map with steps I've already completed.  
---
Love the design though, it's the first guide I've seen and haven't thought this is out of the 90s. It's modern and sleek. I think making some tweaks to the user experience will make it so much better than the current guides. Even if it's not in leveling as sure as hell with usability.
---
Indeed. Should be ironed out by tomorrow.
---
I think it's fun.
---
You have the option to do it or not if you do not like it. I personally like having stuff to do in the game, the travel around the world, doing diremaul every week, I like the risk of moving into raids with worldbuffs, I like the massive world pvp events that world buffs create, I like raiding with worldbuffs, I like the speedrun potential, I like the constant risk of death that loses me all my dps.
---
Stop being the fun police.
---
Username sort of relevant
---
Only drink water and make sure you eat enough protein, animal protein to be specific. Also, eat your fruits, veggies, and complex carbohydrates. Whole foods ftw. 
---
Simple, yet so effective.
---
Well September 9th is going to suck.
---
They're not going to combine coasts. At minimum, NA will have six. One of each type at each of the two datacenters that currently host WoW realms (Los Angeles and Chicago). More likely is nine, splitting up the Central and Eastern playerbases, as they're roughly equal in size by themselves to the Pacific playerbase.
---
Can’t get video to load and not gonna download the app to watch it. Does he actually say concurrent player caps will be 10k come phase 2?
---
This argument always cracks me up.
---
Ulduar was fucking good wasn't it.
---
I believe that classic is running a specific version that will be based on cata, someone below mentioned it's based off an 8.X version, but essentially think of classic as its own game, different from vanilla and different from retail.
---
Worked like a charm for me. Chrome on Samsung S10+ newly updated OS, for debugging purpuses.
---
While the site didn’t freeze for me, on iphoneX with the latest iOS the site dropdowns don’t allow me to select an option, just reverts to the “select your faction/player count.” Also, I do QA professionally, both automated and manual if you’d like some assistance. Can probably spin up a test script
---
Do keep in mind however that private servers were found to have drastically overtuned quest xp rewards past lvl 30, like 40-60% more xp per quest. It is still possible to hit it in 6 days, but it will require being efficient and not getting stuck in corpse runs/distracted by world pvp in zones.
---
ah thanks dude, will look into it for tomorrow
---
This is doable, I like this
---
Thank you, this made my day! I just burst out laughing so hard lol..
---
yes, but many of the hosts using the french servers are russians who can't be stopped by EU law
---
Took me a long time to decide. I'm chosen night elf hunter. I love that startng area going to Darkshore to ironforge is fun. I plan on making the journey to westfall lol. I'm going to save my human mage for second.
---
I have server firsts on pservers and top end raiding experience, and I want worldbuffs. I would prefer the method pservers have with no world buffs first month, but that's details. No worldbuffs and farming rag every week for over a year sounds boring af.
---
So desolace rare spawns all = random greens. Boring.
---
Hopefully they sort the download for the stress test! So I can set them up
---
Meep.
---
I picked a night elf warrior. Reason: stupidity.
---
I have a $1900 Asus Gaming Laptop from 2018 and it runs the Beta on max settings at 30 FPS max.
---
I assumed it would run better than that.
---
This was why I rolled a Priest in Vanilla.  I wanted to be able to easily find groups for dungeons.  Still, there were times when just no one on wanted to run whatever dungeon I needed (tended to be UBRS or BRD) so I would level an alt or go PVP instead.
---
I don't every think many people remember the REAL Classic WoW. I have spoke with people 3 different times now and none of them had a true remembrance of Classic. Most people remember BC. Classic was okay but people hoping and dreaming that the release of Classic WoW is the savior to future MMOs makes me laugh. It is purely a way for Blizzard to once again get some money for content they already have. Other MMO's have done the same thing and release "CLassic" servers but nothing more than the monthly Sub is required.  Not many people will be able to get the full feeling of Classic because guess what boys we have jobs and families now. Let's see what happens to the divorce rates lol.
---
I dunno, I wouldn't consider thousands of hours since the Classic announcement back in 2017 a casual attempt to churn out content. The route scored Navak Horde first 30 on the Beta as a Warrior... I think that's probably a mark in favor of quality.
---
Decursive was basically mandatory for bug trio as alliance in AQ40. Sadly it won't be useable this time lol
---
Literally day 1. People will be buying up lvl 19 BoE Blues from the get-go, using whatever little gold they have/is available.
---
That being said, if you get a  **Assassin's Blade** from SFK in the first week of Launch, put that shit in the bank and hold onto it. What might sell for 10g at launch (and will be considered a shit-ton of gold!), will easily sell for 60-90g in a month or two. So definitely save your Twink Items and sell them later! (this tip can arguably be applied to just about any BoE you acquire in the first few weeks of Classic).
---
So you honestly think they're just flipping the switch on the servers from 15 years ago?
---
Alliance druids get Judgement of Wisdom which enables them to power shit for much longer than Horde druids. I don't remember the exact math but spamming mana pots on CD gets Tauren druids to like 3 minutes.
---
Using "cloud gaming" services is against the Blizzard EULA.
---
Don't forget that Professions also play a big role in Gold farming. Being able to transmute Arcanite with Enchanting is huge. Being able to make mooncloth as a tailor is also a good money maker. Making and selling pots as an alchemist is good as well.
---
This isn't about moving wow forward, it's specifically about going back and not changing the game from how it was..
---
It's 20:00 in the first world
---
pfUI is ElvUI/TukUI remade for Vanilla 1.12 Clients mate, so just go with that.
---
Paladin (Ret)
---
Priest
---
Warrior/Mage
---
I hope the last one decides to roll a warrior :D
---
&gt; There's no need to make the content easier.
---
What is the argument for *not* making it easier?  Sounds to me like gathering world buffs is the opposite of "easy", since you yourself describe it as tedious.
---
&gt; Guilds are likely to favor giving loot to people performing well. This will cause people to get world buffs, and therefore push more/most people in said guild to spend time getting world buffs. The process is tedious &amp; not fun.
---
Same can be said about any pre-raid preparation like flasks, potions, etc.  
---
There's literally no negative impact on you if these are left *the way they were*.  Stop telling people what is/isn't fun or how to play the game and mind your own damn business.
---
&gt; ElvUI
---
Looks great thanks
---
Blizzard made the software for them to use LOL
---
Do you have a source for this?
---
I think this is the one I'm going to go with thanks
---
I can't imagine it being otherwise. The bare minmum should be a PvP and PvE server. If there is just one about 50% can't choose their prefered server type.
---
5 server won't be nearly enough.
---
Priest racials are a big deal. Fear ward from dwarf is a game changer for alliance groups, stoneform is very good for pvp.
---
Shadowmeld is fun for solo play but starshards isnt worth the channel time. 
---
Human....idk. unremarkable. 
---
Yeah dwarves are ugly but they are also powerful. If you want to be as useful as possible to a group then that's the best choice.
---
Amen, brother.
---
This is true as I was on one of the servers that was shut down. There were so many people in northshire after that.
---
&gt;I feel very bad for broke bois who can’t afford $15 a month for a game they love. Do you have a patreon I can donate to?
---
Well sure! I'm even gonna send you my gamer boy bathwater!  
---
Regardless if you want it or not.
---
My Laptop has more than double all those specs and it only gets about 30-35fps at max settings in Beta/Stress tests.
---
Some dev video. I’ll dig it up later.
---
If you're obligated to get them, find another guild.  Otherwise, you're not.
---
Question: Will leeway make hamstring kiting as a warrior impossible? I heard about this strat recently and I tried it on a p server. Yep, works great there. But I remember trying this on vanilla retail and it did not work at all.
---
I was taking Tailoring almost only for the Robe. I don't really know if I'll ever set foot in a raid so I assumed those would kinda hold me over pretty much forever.
---
I have the same issue.
---
8 servers with 10,000 Layers each is 80k servers...
---
No they won't. The people who will get mad will just stop playing like they always have. It's going to go the exact same way modern wow did.

Blizzard made the software these services use. It's not against the EULA LOL

Which would suggest the game isn't in need of a gold sink.

Me too had to long click of sort to have it work

Nice! Been doing a lot of long distance runs lately, to keep my heart healthy for a 30 hour classic grind, cant wait for it

So X = 0.7 would mean 70% crit chance before Improved Backstab, right? 
---
If we set X = 0.69, and using a Barman Shanker then wouldn't
---
this be Ambush

https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(2.5+*+73+%2B+121.55+%2B+290)+*+1.2+*+(1+-+0.69)+%2B+(2.5+*+73+%2B+121.55+%2B+290)+*+2+*+1.2+*+0.69

and this, slightly higher value, Backstab

https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(1.5+*+73+%2B+121.55+%2B+225)+*+1.2+*+(1+-+0.69+-+0.3)+%2B+(1.5+*+73+%2B+121.55+%2B+225)+*+2.3+*+1.2+*+(0.69+%2B+0.3)

then if we use X = 0.1 (10% crit right?) and a Barman Shanker

Ambush is

It seems like now that I plug it into wolfram, even Perd's has Backstab doing slightly more. Am I doing something wrong here?

X = 0.69 Ambush (https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(2.5+*+105+%2B+121.55+%2B+290)+*+1.2+*+(1+-+0.69)+%2B+(2.5+*+105+%2B+121.55+%2B+290)+*+2+*+1.2+*+0.69)

When has Blizz ever said 6pm PDT on August 27th? Even on [their announcement for the release date](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule) it clearly gives the time and dates for the various regions.
---
Reminds me of the requirements for a lot of jobs advertised online:
---
Looking for an entry level employee with 10 years of experience. Bachelor's degree required, masters degree preferred. Advanced certifications in \[something\].
---
$18/hr.
---
A fool and his money...
---
But I likes my guild
---
I agree this is a great point
---
I doubt anything done in a stress test will carry over to launch.
---
Epic mount and just costs of raiding was more than enough a gold sink
---
So huge. After installing and playing with it for years, I had some issue down the line where I had to disable everything to try and troubleshoot it. Completely forgot how horrible the default UI is.
---
Ah shit, here we go again...
---
Another week, another post in the weekly thread about my inability to decide a class. Currently leaning Warlock or Shadow Priest. Planning to do a lot of PvP (bg and world) with some dungeons and PUG raids sprinkled in. Priest was my first love, and shadow seems perfect for what I want to get out of Classic (don't think I'll be taking the SPriest to many raids...), but I'm concerned with locking myself in like that. Warlock seems to give me what I like about Priest while still allowing me to get some awesome DPS in later raid tiers.
---
So... What do? Should I Warlock or SPriest?
---
Clearly that's not the case. If it is objectively the best option, that's what they would be doing.
---
Was on my rogue doing dailies in the sunwell and just logged off. Didnt come back until this summer.
---
This is why I do not bother even trying to get into a relationship unless the lady is also a hardcore nolife gamer. Only another addict could understand and tolerate me.
---
I've played on private servers the several years.  The first time I leveled on a private server I played a warrior and had limited vanilla game knowledge.  My time to 60 was a little over 10 days played on a very gear dependent class.  Since it has been proven that group exp on private servers was incorrect (private servers didn't give as much as it should) I'd think that the majority of players will hit 60 in 8-10 days played.  This time will slip out of range if you choose to spend a ton of time in STVeitnam PvPing, leveling professions, exploring, etc.
---
I liked those long ass dungeons because most people skipped most stuff. Specifically doing the stuff people generally skip made it feel special and unique.
---
Tukui is also currently working on classic.
---
I had this (and like 4 other things0 macro'd to stealth. It was one of my favorites.
---
Skarm is going bear first at classic. If he is going bear, it has to be viable. There is a good talk on his youtube about it.
---
No one is doing that. Stop lying to yourself.
---
I don't really understand why you'd trust their promises. But even if they are genuine, what happens when the population doesn't divebomb to the extent they expect and more people stick around? They won't be able to keep their "promises" even if they wanted to. Layering will inevitably become permanent.
---
I remember there being talk that karazhan was supposed to be vanilla thing but was moved to TBC.
---
You'd be surprised. IF has great access to blackrock mountain and a quick boat trip to theramore for onyxia's layer. I think city player pop will be somewhere around 60% ironforge, 39% SW, 1% darnassus. Disclaimer: These percentages were pulled out of my ass.
---
lol wont even take a year by the time AQ40 is out they will have a cash shop and prob even a pay 50 bucks for a instant lvl 50 to join the fun!!! GIVE US YOUR MONEY! &lt;3
---
Maybe the decision wasnt made until very recently
---
Ah they must have just added it! Are there any posts for it? I can't see anything..
---
WARRI OMEGALUL R
---
Everyone is talking about basically 2 or 3 guilds. I highly doubt anyone is going to actually pull it off, but the only people who are crazy enough to even try are guilds shooting for world first. Otherwise why bother?
---
Just replied this as well. And i second this. Skarm is amazing, and if anyone has tank questions, check his youtube out. Im going pally so i can heal like always, but OT if needed for some content.
---
Is this real life?
---
He added that they have additional servers ready in case they get filled.... which I'm absolutely sure they will. LOL Hopefully they have plenty ready.
---
Yes ultra hardcore. Most people won’t be hitting 60 for atleast 2 months
---
[It was PvE.](https://web.archive.org/web/20041230034439/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/serverstatus/)

My mistake. 6pm PDT is for the name reservation.
---
At work, brain not functioning fully.
---
From what I've seen on this subreddit, just the opposite. Shaman seems very popular this time around.  Of course, this subreddit likely will have a different demographic than the launch population.
---
Yeah, you have no fucking idea what you're talking about.

dude, I used to save all my starting gear in banks on all my characters, I also have no idea but I'm so glad I did. But all my shirts are soulbound cuz I have them equipped
---
\*checks spreadsheet\*
---
These are what I'm going to skip (subject to change during leveling if I notice something to improve) prior to 40, but after a mount I will train everything:
---
* Smite after R4
---
* Fade
---
* Resurrection after R1
---
* Psychic Scream after R1
---
* Dispel Magic after R1
---
* Holy Fire after R2
---
* Mind Soothe (it's good in theory, but almost useless in practice; by the time you've sneaked past some monsters you would have already killed them and got XP)
---
* Mana Burn (PvE)
---
* Prayer of Healing
---

These I might skip depending on how Classic will feel (I've heard rumours that it's much easier than private servers, and I didn't even use these on private servers so I will probably skip them in Classic):

I raided aq40 as a hunter, but still put my giantstalker back on for pvp due to multishot set bonus being that powerful.
---
Chromaggus crossbow is the best thing until naxx so aq was a lot of sidegrades and hoping for the agi spear to drop.
---
Server transfers in no way garuntee a fix for high population servers and in my opinion are just as bad as server merges. They also have to keep layering in until it does fix it halting content or renegading on there promise of no layering in phase 2. The guy has legimate complaints and the only one bitching here is yourself towards him.
---
&gt; Nevdermind that, you either have some serious memory leaks
---
Me or the site?
---
All players are equal
---
but some players are more equal than others
---
I 100% believe people will no sleep to 60. Hell when I was 14 my brother would just play while I slept. They will figure out a way to get Rag first week imo.
---
Don't level holy paladin.. just don't. Sure you'll never die but it'll be exceptionally boring to level.
---
Thanks ! I don't know the existence of this reddit \^\^
---
I feel you on that, but in the end it is for a good cause
---
Gotta remember to watch this
---
The game is not to scale in any aspect. The world is a tiny fraction of its lore size. How I reconcile it all is that all of these events are already done and what we experience is our character's memory of it. Hence, why some important people are larger than life, distances between places are shorter, only important towns and cities show up, etc.
---
It's just wishful thinking, not gonna happen that soon.
---
They have a huge cash shop with microtransactions in retail WoW... and Diablo 3... and Starcraft 2... and Hearthstone... and Heroes of the Storm... and Overwatch... and... [wait a second, Starcraft 1 can't possibly have any microtransactions, right?](https://starcraft.com/en-us/articles/23053097). Wait, wait, wait, is that EVERY game that's available on battle.net ??? Now, why isn't Diablo 2 on bnet?
---
But WoW:Classic is going to be different, LMAO
---
yeah it'll probably be done by the ultra hardcore
---
Why are you wrong about almost every recent comment you've made? lol
---
So in my 2005 notes abandoning DID get rid of the item but in my re-testing they did not, with the exception of the distiller and extra-dimensional ghost revealer, as the NPC will just give you another if you lose it.
---

---
I actually didn't know about this either until today when I was looking through the guide. I was skeptical that I would be able to pull it off without something but if you just go to where the coordinates show, finding the way up the hill was easy. So see if you are as successful but I'll bet it will surprise you.
---
Damn, makes sense why they did it that way but it explains why all my shirts are soulbound haha. Never wanted to get rid of the starting shirts.
---
Once you craft bloodvine and equip the set as a tailor, if you were to remove tailoring as a profession would you keep the set bonus or do you lose it?
---
What's your twitch?  Do you still have vods of your Alliance runs in the beta?

i’ve def seen you around w39 on mine lol

That’s not what that means. Also, that’s sharing accounts and I’m sure will get reported/banned if you’re at the front of the pack

North and Ohgee brought up a very important point during the mage section. When do we realize that they are going way too far in their hard-line no changes stance. They are literally recreating bugs on purpose just to "be the same as vanilla". Game play is one of if not the most important part of a game so why are we having things in the game such as excessive spell batching? 400ms? Really? That's almost a full half second. Half of a global cool down of fake imposed input lag. Hunter traps allowed to be sprinted and charged through? Mage blizzard not hitting people with the slow effect if they move through it quickly, much like the hunter trap. At what point do we sit and ask ourselves is it better to recreate these annoyances or take the chance to fix it and not affect the "feel" of authenticity.
---
It's kind of awkward when you see old names that you kicked for poor raid performance lol
---
Would be nice if the map were interactable, especially for zooming in to see where the icons are exactly.
---
You know, when a warrior dings 60, he gets any lady he wants. That's the only reason to play it.
---
What do you mean by underestimating parry? Druids can't parry in form but they can be parried. At least that's what my memory tells me.
---
For the first time in a decade, the friends list shall live again!!
---
Deathbone set FTW
---
Nvidia Shield is not Geforce Now. One is an in-home streaming platform and the other is a cloud gaming service.
---
What on earth are you talking about? I don't think you are grasping what is being discussed. The games design limits it not technology.
---
Seriously though, fuck that guy. his only redeeming quality is that Scarlet Monestary sword
---
&gt;playing horde makes you the underdog
---
Not in PvP . . .
---
Well, let’s assemble the facts here.
---
Leveling to 60 is estimated to take, on average, 85-150 hours (not including speed levelers).
---
At 10 hours a day of play time, that’s 8.5-15 days to hit 60.
---
So you tell me, does that sound average or hardcore?
---
Same here, Ulduar was my favorite raid ever.  Trial of Crusaders was the last raid I ever did when we got A Tribute to Insanity.  It was like the good team developed Ulduar &amp; ICC from what I hear and the B team developed Trial of Crusaders in between them
---
&gt; They said they won't have layering in all the time though.
---
Not enough, it shouldn't even be in the code, let alone in the game for a single minute.
---
&gt; not sure why we have people like you bitching about this when it isn't brand new.
---
Of course it's not brand new, that doesn't mean it's good. The #1 people claimed to want from classic was NO SHARDS. Now they go and add sharding, or excuse me, "layering" (it's basically the same thing), and you're all white-knighting for Blizzard now.
---
I was just thinking maybe I missed some huge leveling tactic or something. I just remember hitting 60 to be a pretty big deal back in the day.
---
I'm still not exactly sure why people are calculating their 0-60 times. 
---
Perhaps it's just me, but raiding was literally a blip on the radar and I played WoW a ton back in the day. Maybe I'm just an altoholic...
---
Naming your pet the same as your main tank is the most galaxy brain chaotic good thing I've read in a while holy shit
---
Yeah why consider the majority of the playerbase thats silly!
---
Easily week 2. On every server? Eh maybe not. But some tryhardiest of tryhards will do it week 1-2 for sure.
---
I know its bannable but pretty hard to prove. I am sure ppl will get away w it.

I've gamed from hotels plenty in NA. The latency is really not bad for something with as much lag compensation as wow. Can't help you about Asia to EU, but it will add probably 100ms to your latency over what you'd have local.
---
The quitters are not the real player base lol they are temp players lol
---
False.
---
Around panda time I started playing private servers.
---
I might be missing something here... But why is the second step to undead leveling "Destroy Hearthstone"?
---
Genius, I use the shit daily. Gforce Now is just the name of the game streaming service.  Hence if it's on Gforce Now you can play it from any android device, shield, mac or pc. Which I do... often.
---
summer school, summer camps, prep-school, etc.
---
Cata 4.1 Firelands, that's where I felt the game was utter BS
---
I get the feeling classic isn't going to be for you.
---
Have fun while you can but don't expect the game to change much just because a minority or players doesn't like something
---
Doing thins efficiently it’ll take a normal player maybe 8 days played? Fuckin around and having fun will make it take much longer. Find a nice middle ground I’d say!
---
The Game/Fun/Social Interaction starts at LvL1, not 120 :)
---
&gt; I know the world record is less than 7 days but that was a hunter, most classes take longer.
---
Truly hardcore players are already set up into 5m dungeon cleave teams and have taken PTO for the first week. You're going to see a TON of shaman and warriors hitting 60 in week 1.
---
Of course it won't be enough, I completely agree with you. I'm just doubting that Blizzard will actually do it right. They still refuse to confirm or deny whether NA will get an RP-PVP server.
---
I doubt he will be down on every single server. But the top couple guilds will have him down first week, and whats more I don't think it will even be that close. My money is late on day 5 or early day 6.
---
That would be normal hardcore.  Ultra will get him week 1
---
In fact, the ENTIRE [Battle.Net](https://Battle.Net) suite is on there. I play Hearthstone, WoW, Starcraft, Diablo... OW all of them on my mac and android devices.
---
They double dipped on the scummyness: have to sub to stress test and have to sub to reserve names. I'll sub on Friday when i get home from work, they can scam my approximately 10 dollars from my pocket whatever i have a job.
---
Care to elaborate? Haha
---
I would say 10 hours a day, especially if you have a family or lets just say Mon - Friday 9-5 job, it's pretty hardcore...
---
Yes it is:

---
Blizzard didn't "make" any software specific to these services.
---
Live population data is far more accurate and useful than some idiot's conjecture that thinks WoW Vanilla had 100 million players.
---
Understandable. The chart with the dates and times has been there since the announcement though.
---
Yes, I want to be a Count..  Count Chocula...   =)
---
Just go troll. It's good for PVE and troll racials for shadow priest are amazing. Sure fear ward is better but since you would be horde side anyway it doesn't matter.
---
I'm not sure. I honestly don't know where OP got 10k from. I didn't hear him mention that at all on stage.
---
I have asked a GM during a online chat. Now I have a subscription and still can't post :) I have no idea right now.
---
Yeah you're right, must have been looking at something else.
---
But you can still run 1080p Medium/High settings at near 60 FPS with that APU

Many go into holy for some spells. there are a few guides out there for this. Ive seen some great ones on reddit and on the forums (What i do is go to the bliz forums &gt; classic general discussion &gt; Search paladin &gt; Run through some threads until you see something good) I would give a link, but i will have to go look again.
---
This guide was alright. starts with ELI5, so move forward in the video for interesting info. [https://youtu.be/C8BPATSVpRg](https://youtu.be/C8BPATSVpRg)
---
That is a very weak weapon compared to Rhok and is going to cost like 1,500g+. Pass.
---
Animals do not get parried, in general the idea is you cannot parry a claw as one would with a sword. Thusly mobs that the druid is tanking in the front will not receive the 30% off the next swing timer.
---
There is a difference in populations, perhaps you haven't noticed?  
---
With soo many people on both sides, there will be every kind of person on both sides, but there are some trends.  
---
Alliance likely has more women irl players, more young players, and also more casual old players.  
---
Horde has in my experience, both a higher number of people who are laid back, while also having more people who are just outright douchebags
---
This is a game changer. THANK YOU.
---
There is an interact keybind. No macro required for that portion.
---
Imagine thinking you’re going to down a raid boss week 1. Imagine the servers holding up.
---
You could stealth and eat, it wasn't a bug, rogues could do it. You framing it as a bug or questioning it was a fallacy to begin with, did you know regrowth heals the target, well yes it's a heal. I wasn't trying to be passive aggressive so I don't know where the downvotes came from.
---
You're definitely not alone in waiting. If you look at the pinned survey and scroll down to the do you have a guild yet question you'll see that over 70% of the 24,000 people that responded don't have a guild yet. I think there will be more activity with guilds forming once realms are announced, and even more will form during leveling and as people reach max level.
---
ultra hard core is week 1, id say dedicated players are gonna be doing week 2
---
Obviously a lot of people will be rolling priests, including myself. If druid is really your thing, I say go for it. Roll druid
---
They haven't given us anything concrete but it's safe to assume the layer lock out will solve most of the abuse. Also, they aren't really under any obligation to share with us. And there position definitely isnt scree the economy
---
ESO fucked up the the uniqueness of classes, having the possibility of being everything in one character. (That's a big NO to me), GW2 fucked up breaking the Holy Trinity and they had to make it "work"  with their expansions because raiding and dungeons were a fucking mess. Black Desert Online is a disgusting pay to win asian mmo. Only FF14 brought back the genre to it's glory when they remake it from the ground up.
---
Hmmm all very true.... I just can't wait to run from Kalimdor to IF again lol
---
Alright thanks!
---
Nope, they're born as adults!
---
Oh no! Here's hoping it works itself out. I don't have a sub but do have some old high-level characters. I think there's a level or acct. age minimum, but neither are very high.
---
&gt; but the right to not have your own image (which your avatar is an extension of that you control) does exist even in public venues.
---
TIL I'm a big fat cow
---
I think it's important that the game at least starts as authentically as possible.  As time goes on they can fix these annoyances, or even change the game if they (hopefully) move in to Classic+.
---
Thanks for the reply. Hope you get to create many more memories shortly!
---
From your post history:
---
&gt; Well, over 130 million people played WoW at some point, with over 70 million of them being players from Vanilla, TBC and Wrath.
---
Lifetime sales of Vanilla, TBC, and Wrath combined don't even total 70 million copies kid.
---
u have 1337 hacker skills, tell me whats going down on NA PVP Stormreaver.
---
Revive pet...
---
Sounds like this guy knows what he's talking about and may also steal your girl.
---
I've read that you can get away healing 5 mans as 30/21 but for raids its better to go deep resto. Not 100% sure if thats accurate but that's just what i've gathered from different websites/posts.
---
IDK is it trash? I guess since the most popular/ best MMO in the world uses it yea must be trash ROFL nahhhhh dude
---
Is it on Cruse/twitch?
---
Even using some of the slowest leveling classes, people have been beating Joana's old world record during the beta.   
---
Nobody is suggesting that MC will be cleared week 1 by veteran dad gamers who keep going on about smelling the roses. It will be a coordinated effort by world class NEETs who have been mapping every aspect of the game for the past decade.
---
Haha
---
Are you a sovereign citizen?
---
blizzard can eat a dick.
---
Must be subbed
---
Must be a dumb fucking moron
---
Who is such a dumbfuck that they would waste their time helping blizzard after they shafted us with the beta? Why doesn't their streamer friends get their loser followers to do it for them?
---
Yeah we'll see what happens. He is already a millionaire after all and he's already used to playing vanilla off-stream from private servers over the last few years. I'm cautiously optimistic that he's telling the truth.
---
Played alliance all of vanilla.  
---
Am 'open' to go alliance again, but would really rather go horde.  
---
Friend who wants to play classic, but never has, but wants to play paladin. So i guess I have to play alliance again :l
---
Some have as early as day 10 Rag kills. The changes would have to be MASSIVE to stall these types of groups by an additional 4+ days. I couldn’t even fathom the types of changes it’d require.
---
imagine needing a guide to win against anything as a mage
---
I don’t take more than a day off every week to train. I’m scared to take a few days off from the gym haha, but at least I’m getting GAINS in the game
---
Frostadaumus (sp?) elaborated on this a bit from his beta experience on his youtube channel but it really just boils down to this, imo: just hope that it doesnt last very long. There's nothing else you can do
---
You young bucks just don’t know hard it was! We didn’t have 1080 back then’! 
---
Crazy when I see Fraps videos now with such poor quality...it did the trick back then though
---
These 3 are the only current non-wow MMOs that are popular in the west
---
*excessive moonfireing begins*
---
Leveling to 30 still takes a long while, and there are myriad dungeon quests to get that involve running (and prior quest steps) and compose the majority of the exp gains you get from “dungeon leveling”. Were he to literally just travel to dungeons and spam them without the tandem quests (and never go to/navigate capital cities),he wouldn’t need fast kitty. But I think it’s safe to assume he won’t , making it worth it, even for just 21 - 30. I’m not sure you’ve ever played vanilla before, and underestimate how much running you do.
---
Ya my plan is to heal my way into sick elemental gear and then once I feel like I’m sufficiently geared with atleast aq40 shit and possibly a few naxx pieces I’m gonna bounce on my guild and spend the rest of my days zapping dwarfs with trankets.
---
I can't imagine they'd be THAT crowded after two months.
---
We will know this week. Blizzard opens up 8 servers in China. Now I don't know how big the interest in Classic is in China, but I doubt it's that much higher than in the US/EU. 5 servers would be totally flooded even with layering. I think Blizzard can think so far. I'd expect around 8 to 12 servers for EU/NA.
---
lol @ people tying to avoid streamers now
---
Leaning Orc Warlock, but I played Undead Mage in WotLK and wouldn't mind recreating him. Planning on a Tauren Druid alt and I always end up playing Druid, since I like tanking dungeons. I'd like to play affliction, especially in AV, so I'm currently sticking with it, but could end up with either of the others come launch day.
---
I've been looking for this too! It doesn't have to be the exact same, but I would like some sort of simplified buff tracker for the raid other than raid frames.
---
Level holy; meet a tank, go steady, reap the rewards of back to back dungeons with 2.5x bonus xp, hit 60 fast. GG
---
Check out "2. Blizzard's Ownership" [here](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/legal/fba4d00f-c7e4-4883-b8b9-1b4500a402ea/blizzard-end-user-license-agreement).
---
Interesting to listen to. I wonder how many servers US will get.
---
For QOL, could you make it so clicking the links opens a new tab instead of loading over the guide?
---
If we only get 5 servers, than all the promises blizzard made about shutting Layering off before p2 is a lie. No way 5 normal servers will be enough
---
They are implemented that way, just not how *you'd* like it. If you separate everything like that then you essentially have separate servers (which doesn't fix the problem layering is here for.) 
---
Layers are to balance the *population* not the server's economy or social space. Yes, there will be a shit load of stuff going on at launch in general chat and on the AH but isn't that what everyone asked for? **Chaos**, but manageable. 
---
If layers are independent then you might as well just make server groups and Blizzard doesn't want that.
---
Asians aren't known for their interest in roleplaying. It will be interesting to see.
---
Wanna know how you actually shut down streamers?  You stream snipe and gank them into the ground.
---
Here's what playing on a streamers realm means. Unless you're playing in that streamers guild your own guild will never be the number one guild on the server. You won't ever be the person to hit the AQ gong. Anywhere that streamer goes there will probably be a big group following them and you'll never be able to compete against that group for anything. The biggest issues here is competition. I wouldn't be surprised if some stream or their fans take control of something in the world like never letting anyone else tag world bosses or something. I've played on private servers (SWG) where this has happened and it honestly does ruin the game. Do I think this will happen? Probably not. I think for the most part most people on a streamer server won't have any interaction with them 95% of the time. If anything I think there are more pros than cons to streamers than people give them credit for. My biggest fear is ending up on a dead or dying/ low pop server. Streamers guarantee a large influx of players joining a server. This has a snow ball effect. Lots of people just want to be on the biggest most successful server and will piggy back on that wave. Larger server populations means easier recruitment for raiding, more things on the AH and selling faster. I wouldn't mind being on a streamer server but I have to wait and see. It seems that most of the streamers are in time zones that I'm not a part of so I may miss them by virtue of looking for server that'll have raid times that fit what I need.
---
I spent thousands of hours in game raiding. It was definitely a massive part for a ton of people. 0-60 times is both a curiosity for me as well as a planning tool to figure out when our guild may be able to raid.
---
What exactly do you think is required to play those games on cloud services? They all run an OS that already installs and plays WoW. Blizzard didn't have to "make" anything. But they DID pull their license and make cloud gaming against the EULA in the last year.
---
of course.
---
The download page says: Click here to [Download AllyRoute](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/allyroute) from CurseForge.com
---
I've heard that you can be effective without it like the dude said. If you're not pushing PvE super hard the spec is probably fine. It's your group that really decides if its a big deal and you can lie to them until it's too late.
---
Blind is vastly outnumbered by all the snare effects you'll have to deal with though. Dwarf Warriors would counter Rogues best, but Gnomes would fare better against Mages and Hunters.

---
Well, it belongs to Blizzard more than anyone else, but the streaming culture creates an odd side business to the whole process. Obviously the streamer owns their own actions they perform and any commentary or whatnot they put over said actions, but then so does everyone else acting in their way as wells. Blizzard owns the data or telemetry of what we do and of course all game play mechanics, graphics, sounds etc but the volition and action and choices, they own the right to use that data as they see fit but not the direct actions in the way we performed them. 
---
Put it this way, if I filmed inside a public venue say Gamestop, Gamestop doesn't have to blur the faces of their customers in their own security feeds, but I would if I didn't get permission from all those on film. And Gamestop would probably want extra permission to ever use the customers likenesses in any advertisement or other profit generating manner.
---
Nice, I'll be testing it
---
Damn I forgot about digg. It went the way of the MySpace after selling out. Shame.
---
WARNING!
---
This vid is for Classic players who know how to have fun only. Serious anal raiders look away now!
---
I enjoyed all the QoL changes over the years but I enjoyed classic just as much for its own reasons. I don't think that it will really inspire other MMOs or prevent WoW from dying out in the next few years, but I do disagree to a certain extend about people not returning. Being grown up and having a job means I can afford the monthly sub and play more casually, making the game last longer. My wife will be playing as well and she goes a little more hardcore than me these days so she'll be too busy grinding to 60 to be able to serve divorce papers. And i've got more gamer friends now (since they control their own gaming with their own money and mostly play on PC) so i've got more people to play with than I did when I was younger. Ezpz
---
This is so retarded.
---
Hi Mel, you're awesome!
---
So you're just going to regurgitate internet rumors instead of show me official links. Nice LOL
---
If it's a big issue they might open up servers and offer free transfers. It's something they've done in the past though I'm not sure if it happened in Vanilla.
---
Why not just use Questie?
---
&gt; very weak weapon compared to Rhok
---
4 crit rating?
---
This looks so good. Awesome work man. I hope you can monetize it somehow, because I'll definitely be using it a lot.
---
Dude well see, only 3 weeks to wait
---
I just look up old vanilla pvp videos and listen to that. Par the warrior,unbreakable,jamaz and so in all have great music in their videos
---
The number of realms at launch is not indicative of the number of realms available even a week after launch let alone months later when Phase 2 drops.
---
Once Blizzard has actual launch numbers, they can make more realms if needed. There's absolutely no good reason to have more than the bare minimum number of realms at launch. It's just a risk.
---
What these videos fail to account for is that the people you meet and befriend and play with might be okay with you playing in a spec that is sub-optimal. Or that not every group or every raid leader Personally checks your spec.
---
But this is a question that will only be fully answered by your experience and you get to play a part in What that experience is.
---
People role play on WoW?  Now that’s cringe
---
&gt;Half of a global cool down of fake imposed input lag. Hunter traps allowed to be sprinted and charged through? Mage blizzard not hitting people with the slow effect if they move through it quickly, much like the hunter trap. At what point do we sit and ask ourselves is it better to recreate these annoyances or take the chance to fix it and not affect the "feel" of authenticity.
---
And it's a hard line to walk. But at the end of the day the gameplay suffers- and I don't think any of us want that.
---
The class quests should be in there by tomorrow. We have baked all the class quests, including the 50 quests, into both the Horde and Alliance routes. 
---
It appears the steps you mentioned after Chen's are incorrectly parsing Shaman class specific steps to obtain the Fire Totem. Thanks for pointing that out, we have fixed it now.
---
Changes made to the route(s) will go live when we push the new data forward.
---
Great idea. Thanks!
---
meta bad, druid good
---
why is this trash allowed to be posted here? unconfirmed bs. Good job mods.
---
It's legally binding to the extent you have given fair notice and warning of your intent. Follow that up with said message appearing on their stream, archive the clip and maybe even send a more formal email to whomever the streamer is and you have a trail of notices being delivered and received. From there it would be a matter of seeing through the tort which is probably not worth it to most people, but if one person did follow through and win, it would open the doors to any other future cases with the same level of actions being taken.
---
Cash grab is making a hollow game that everything goes through microtransactions, Retail is more of a Cash grab with the expansions, instant max lvl cap and all the crappy things of the store, rather than Classic.  
---
Classic is more like a recycled asset put together to be working again to atract more subs, ergo sustained money every month, different of huge flow of money in X or Y things on the store for limited time, aka cash grabs.
---
You can try and fill those roles, the specs just aren’t built competitively. Whether a guild will have a spot for them depends on how hardcore you plan to play.
---
The game is more than those roles though, and is still fun to experience and explore.
---
Extreme optimization
---
I SHOWED you links kid. NO Blizzard games are currently listed as licensed on the Geforce Now page.
---
That's why there is layering.
---
Raiding is a small part of classic, and it was never intended for every single class's every single spec to perform optimally in raids.
---
Up to the courts to decide, like most things in America.
---
I'd say Alliance.
---
I could always use more HKs.
---
Honestly, this is the kind of gaming gatekeeping literally everywhere is protesting. I don't personally like Fortnite, but phone games are understandable. They're literally a socially acceptable way to keep yourself entertained away from home/PC. I play a couple of weeb rhythm games and they're fine, and "tolerable".
---
Well, you're picking the absolute worst race for Rogues on either faction, so logic from us isn't going to help you.
---
I would also figure out what precautions to take to not get banned for suspicious activity when your account logs in from China. That would be my concern. I don't know if that's likely to happen or not though.
---
Yes those are their /played, and i understand how fast that can be. I am saying that I don’t think anyone will play from 1-60 without sleeping.
---
The frogurt is also cursed :(
---
Plenty of guilds will have cleared MC on week two. Even some big streamers are aiming for a week 2 MC. The real challenge is to clear it in week 1 which only the ultra hardcore guilds will achieve.
---
Thanks for sharing. 12 minutes a day doesn’t seem like much but it can save you a lot of trouble. This is very important and people that disregard physical health will have subpar performance in game anyway.

Unless they are able to create new realms instantly, they should start with 50 servers minimum worldwide.
---
Teleports to Gnomeregan, Horde is easy mode. meanwhile we have to risk our lives by sneaking past a Capital city when going to SM.
---
Im fuking spraying arcane brilliance
---
A mage did it
---
why would you want to play a dead server? the more players on a server the better for any mmo
---
Any hardcore player will be there in a week tops.  Fastest guys do it under 3 days played.  All the hardcore players will mostly dungeon spam to level to avoid the crowds and quest mob respawn timers.
---
If they are recruiting... probably not.  By now, they would already have their ultra ready to go people set.  It's possible, but I'm dubious on it.
---
I'm also very interested in this
---
That is not at all apparent when looking at the image.
---
Where can one find said analytics?
---
I know people are saying to skip the smaller heals but if you plan to run early dungeons and be a smart healer that uses correct heals in certain situations, you should have lesser heal r1 and r3, heal r1, and renew. 
---
Keep in mind Power Word Shield should only be used on yourself or the DPS's. Tanks don't want shields, just heals. Obviously this is strictly for dungeons.
---
Save yourself the pain of fighting orcs, just go horde.

Always thought of it as playing D&amp;D but in a video game world.

Plan to just have a bunch of really messy lvl 1 mules that I fill the mailboxes of omw to 60. Won't be buying anything except for training/mount/bags.
---
Then consolidate this into two bank alts (one will get enchanting and get left at some twink X9 level bracket) as I search for profitable farming niches by selling literally everything I have gathered. 
---
Continue to farm the most profitable and funnel the gold early to influence the market on items which: 
---
* are needed for progression
---
* supply is low
---
* on a timer
---
* large demand fluctuations (ore during the weekends)

I believe the only complete vods I saved were Horde unfortunately. I'll be demonstrating routes during tomorrow's stress test, probably 1 Horde and 1 Alliance.
---
And Onyxia isn't his mom, the entire post is a joke
---
I am very much in agreement with you bud... like 150% 
---
But sadly, they will not listen and they're going to force feed layering for atleast 6months. People say it'll be less, people say it'll be more... whatever it'll be, if it's anything more than 2 weeks it's going to SUCK. SUCK HARD.
---
Except this would happen regardless....  Layering is effectively just a clean painless way to do server merging.   If we went with the dirty method of server merging, it would be the same result.
---
Also, most people don't bother to sell everything they have gathered just before they quit the game either.
---
If any addon maker is prowling this thread, I'd love something to track my session/lifetime Pickpocket stats.  Especially if I can export the data to a spreadsheet.
---
You have a Capital City on either side of Blackrock Mountain, the Horde has a mudhut we have to use to access the first two major raids.
---
No complaints about who has it easy.
---
&gt; isnt this entire thread real world politics?    
---
Answer? Yes. The mods on this sub are not fair or unbiased. They are clear about what pisses them off and what type of comments get banned.
---
That has not been my experience, and have never had reason to believe your generalizations are correct. What I have noticed is a lot of "Grr [other faction] is full of douchebags!" from both sides, mostly stemming from people getting camped by douchebag individuals, faction irrelevant. From my personal experience, I've encountered more obviously child players while playing Horde, but not enough to make a blanket statement that Horde has more children. There are plenty of female and casual old people on both sides that any difference is not noticeable.       
---
Demographically both sides are the same with insignificant variance. Without hard, large scale data from Blizzard to the contrary, there's no reason to think otherwise.
---
People roleplay in real life.
---
Your brain tells you NE rogue? What?
---
The raid meta is set in stone. People have been playing vanilla in one form or another (retail or private server) since 2004. The game is figured out. So yeah, raiding is completely linear at this point. There will be no surprises in Classic.
---
Maybe but the client is the one used in legion so 7.x.x something. 
---
But legion addons wont work anyway probably since database and everything is different. You need ones that are specifically updated for classic.
---
I used an addon called Opium for this, but I don't know if it's going to be available for classic. Definitely keeping my ear to the ground on this though.
---
Looks like the developer gave up three months ago: https://github.com/Ellypse/Storyline/tree/classic
---
A tank 
---
Warrior 
---
Druid 
---
Pally 
---
Probably in that order
---
In fucking cataclysm
---
Not to mention the economy will suck.
---
I think you'll have a hard time coming up with gold for repairs (plate is expensive) if you're playing that casually
---
Heh, exactly.  Takes forever to set up, but it works so well once your used to it.  And switching stances/forms is one of those things that really needs to flow without thinking about it, so taking the time to figure a system that works for you is well worth the trouble.
---
I read the manual that came with cd and rly likes the idea of revive spells x) so i made a ud priest named deadreviver cos i rly wanted to rez people hahaha
---
&gt;By the time like 50% of people get to 60 the lower level zones will clear up and layering will keep them populated.
---
No, that isn't what layering does at all.    That's cross realm sharding, which won't be in the game.
---
You’re right that they’re both acceptable, because its obvious what someone means regardless of which word they use. It’s still not technically correct, though. 
---
https://www.dictionary.com/e/fewer-vs-less/
---
I like your choice of words.
---
That addon looks nice. I'll give it a try.
---
Imagine thinking that you need skill to win against a rogue in a open field while having a get-out-of-jail-free-card every 15 seconds called blink.
---
To be fair, thats not your fault, isn't that the rogues for not inserting feint into their rotation?
---
i would like to see this duel with "leeway" thou, feels like the rogue could have connected
---
Don't be obtuse. You know fairly well that there are people who just can't afford to spend it needlessly. We don't know the truth about their situation. Empathize while you read and you won't sound like an asshole.
---
This was a post asking for more volunteers, it was a valid argument. Bashing them for their inability to waste $10 was not needed.
---
Layering literally can't stay:  world bosses
---
Redcar isn’t an orc that’s why :p
---
&gt;I have a feeling that alliance in general, are more friendly.
---
Yeah, so friendly that they never help each other in wpvp...
---
Find a mentor willing to teach you things while you're playing. You can become competitive quickly if you focus on it
---
Seconding warrior tank. Instant 5 man, just add commonly available DPS who will be begging for dungeon slots anyway.

Memory may be hazy, but IIRC my battlegroup still had long enough queues to get in a duel or two at least before they popped.

Lol what? No one has ever said this.
---
Bought a new chair, bought a blue yetti microphone, bought some...snacks heh... what else... oh yea got vacation time approved, cleaned my desk off, alcohol'ed the mouse/keyboard. oiled the squeaky keyboard sliders...honestly im running out of shit to do to kill time.
---
Been playing Ark: Survival a little bit to help pass the time until wow but its getting old
---
Can I ask you, sir.  Do you know if this version resembles the blue mmog version? I have the latter one, and been using it for 7 years now. And I wouldn't trade it for anything except one of the same caliber. Unfortunately the wheel-button doesn't work any more. So I've been looking for replacement forever. Problem is they are impossible to come by second hand. But the Molten version seems to be more sourceable. In any way. Razer Naga comrade here too, and it's irreplaceable really!
---
The cities NEVER had separate Auction Houses.
---
Until Patch 1.9, only Ironforge and Orgrimmar had them. Then all of them got them, but they were always linked.
---
Mage vs. Rogue is one of my favorite matchups in Vanilla- if every cooldown is up in a fight where both classes are PvP Spec'd the potential # of resets and mindgames makes it one of the most fast-paced, skill-centric 1v1's.
---
I tried to break it down by the cooldowns you need to be concerned with and approaches to take in various parts of the rogue vs. mage fight life cycle.
---
No difference, mate. The key phrasing is for commercial purposes. You cant commercialize other peoples likeness or what they own without permission. The key question then becomes, do we own the actions and messages we put into the World of Warcraft client. The data derived from those actions we know we don't own, as Blizzard does and says they do in their EULA. But, the more immediate and direct "I press space so I jump" or "I sent this message" is probably still protected.
---
If we would’ve been hardcore we’d aim for a clear on week 1.
---
We have already gone for the ”MC-first-week”-race on multiple private projects before for the past 5-6 years, but things have slightly changed over the years!
---
8 servers worldwide or per area/continent?
---
Ah thanks mate.
---
never said spectacle detracts, it's just that spectacle isn't a substitute for a game that is fun to play. Rather than focusing on being a GPU melter games should focus on being games, and having graphics that serve gameplay.
---
In WoW upgrading your character means nothing not because the character is ugly but because nobody cares what your character looks like no matter how badass your transmog is. In classic even end game characters had the weird AQ sets mixed with random pieces of naxx gear and it looked stupid, but people recognized that your character was awesome at a glance.
---
There were no AHs in SW, Darn, TB, or UC before patch 1.9. There were never separate auction houses depending on what city you were in, just only two cities that had AHs before the patch (Org and IF).
---
Imagine not knowing that a skilled rogue with trinkets will beat a less-skilled mage any day.
---
Then we all go back to the starting zones and die.
---
imo its because theyre the underdogs and arent for weak willed people. its a generalization but people on ally seem to be more carebearish and on horde its more like survival of fittest. still drunk from last night tho and im talking out my bootycrack
---
You’re turning this into an emotional conversation. If 50 cents a day for a hobby is an issue, I feel bad but they’re probably not on a wow forum a month from launch complaining about their financial situation. 
---
Also you’re not wasting money. Like I said you are starting the same subscription you need to play anyway, 20 days in advance.
---
The main thing is to put enough points in Ret to get Seal of Command. After that you can play around with your talents without horribly slowing your leveling.
---
It depends on when you like to play, may want to look for the time zones and play on servers that are local to your time.  I used to play late nights so I selected a Central time zone server to balance things out.
---
You're very welcome! We hope everyone can put it to good use.
---
Is Tyler really short?
---
Diplomacy man. So fucking good. In retail, every time I can be a Human, I am.
---
This is great! Been looking for a good 1v1 guide for ages. Thanks
---
8 servers is absolutely ridiculous. I think Blizzard is really underestimating how many people will be playing this game. Also I have experienced the 10k servers on illegal servers and it was absolute cancer. I do not want the game to be like that, classic wasn’t designed for that
---
nothing so far
---
Watch out, we got a minmaxer here.
---
I'm gonna make a troll shaman named thex. hehehe
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1caknw/eli5_why_do_peoples_faces_have_to_be_blurred_on/
---
This makes it sound like it's not an obligation.
---
I think you’ve found your character name.
---
I never used add ons in classic. I might get some but I’m happy with default regardless. So no essential ones.
---
Human hunter?
---
That is 20k/server from this sub for fucks sake, they are REALLY underestimating how many people are going to play this.  
---
Don't make their mistake, prepare for a rough launch.
---
Only length and width, not height. Gnomes are too tall. I want to play a flat monocolor plane
---
Imagine being this guy
---
Have been talking extensively with friends since I wanted to play alliance cuz of the leveling. But horde seems to be worse from 1-30ish, then after that it’s way better than alliance.
---
Alliance is great until you hit STV, where your quest hub is not as secure or centrally located, and beyond that you’re stuck traveling to remote areas like Feralas and Tanaris and Ungoro which are all awful for alliance because there is no easy access to get there and there aren’t any main cities. You’d have less flight paths on that continent in general. Not good.
---
Plus SM is next to Undercity, and that’s good exp from 30-40.. 
---
So all in all Alliance blows horde out of the water until the later half of the mid game leveling range, where levels get much longer and slower and being in remote areas in Kalimdor tends to be more convenient for the horde than it is for the alliance. Plus SM is way easier to access for Horde and it’s one of the most relevant (if not the most relevant) dungeons while leveling.
---
from what I know about warlock, their raiding damage rotations were complicated and they had to always keep soul shards.
---
World pvp, rogues were always dominant because they always chose which fights to engage in, and which to avoid.
---
Honestly you should just play what you enjoy.
---
Don't count on RP-PVP being available for you just because a Blizzard VP said the word in China. Until there's blue text with a list of realms, it's safer to assume you won't have the choice.
---
Druid, Priest, mage is our core.  Have 2 rogues, 1 druid, 1 warrior, and a shaman interested in joining but not committed to 100% sticking to our schedule.  If we are slow I’ll make an alt to stick with them and level my priest ahead.  Likely a warrior or rogue depending on the comp.
---
We will hit every dungeon at least once since the both of them never played vanilla, and never saw most of them.
---
The issue will be competition more so than melee leeway if anything.
---
We have weapon purchases and valuable items from vendors seeded throughout the guide. However, it sounds like you're talking about an item progression / weapon progression guide. We don't have any plans to make one per se, however, there are many guides out there that could be used in tandem, such as the ones Kargoz produces, which outline intelligent gearing practices while leveling.
---
I think its unbound by default
---
F is to /target targettarget even back then I think
---
id only play ally for dwarves but yeah ive always had an affinity for the beauty in ugly things. i do black n white photography and you can make ugly horrid or depressing scenes look absolutely beautiful. imo horde are like these photos and ally are like post card photos a generic beautiful.
---
Shaman should be an easy choice. Biggest downfall that you might have to gather different gear for different specs but the plus side is, that's more to do so you won't get bored so easily.
---
Healers are always wanted and useful, especially shamans (everyone loves wf).
---
The red ones go faster
---
your definition means every single thing a business does is a "cash grab". 
---
what would the point of the term even be if that was the case?
---
Super effective
---
My heart tells me NE rogue, my brain tells me Gnome rogue.  
---
Idk why people saying Alliance don't back each other up in world pvp, that's the only reason why I fight is to back up a brother.
---
Will there be further quest details beyond this?
---
Random Reddit people vs lawyers....
---
shamens were always PVP gods from what I remember.
---
It literally autocorrected to Redcar with a capital R. I have no idea what Redcar is. I’m hoping someone can chime in and tell me.

---
I play a little bit of mindless dice wars on the toilet from time to time, but to spend hours and hours playing fortnite on the phone is disgusting. A phone game can be good but nobody who wants to make a good game for the sake of being good is going to choose a phone as their primary platform.
---
I guess I can't blame poor people but they should really look into a 200 dollar wal-mart laptop.
---
I'ma post here so I can download all these right before launch, because that's a LOT!
---
Trust me man. I’m just gonna throw it on in the back ground. I wanna see if they have a queuing system enabled at this point
---
Level a hunter alt
---
Fair enough.
---
&gt;Would like a class that can pvp and can do pve content. 
---
mage/lock score highest there imo. Mage is the king of farming due to AoE, but warlocks (along with hunters) can do some interesting dungeon soloing due to their pet being able to tank for you. Both are happily accepted in raids. I don't know the rep on shamans, I'm under the impression they're a neat class that has some hurdles with gearing/grouping.
---
Druids are perfectly competant soloers, so you can basically play anything with them and it'll work.
---
If your druid does not want to go resto, I would say you almost have to play a priest though. Having a healer will make getting groups for non-resto druids much easier.
---
Nefarion was normal size in his human form yes, you could sit on his chair once you murdered him to death.
---
Human's can't be hunters.
---
Female trolls
---
They’ll have enough time to know if they need more servers and get them started up by the time phase 2 rolls around. It’ll be fine when layering is definitely gone for good.
---
this is not a problem because i am using a VPN (and lowers the ping from 300 to 250)
---
Hopefully they allow server xfers so dont get stuck in trash server
---
Doesn’t work on safari mobile at all. 
---
Another small thing is it bothers me nothing is capitalized (not trying to be THAT guy, just saying)
---
Yeah I never trusted Blizzard with layering, and now I am even more worried that layering is here to stay
---
Yes we are going to be adding a notes section which will include npc pictures, quest notes, coordinates, and more to help explain steps.
---
NOOOOOOOOO

How's an ele/resto for a semi casual player who is focused on BGs but still wants to raid? plan is to go the hybrid build as soon as possible to hopefully avoid the insane respec cost. I think I would really enjoy the gameplay of a shaman but they seem a bit casual unfriendly, give me some tips pls because I think I'd love to play it. I would be able to get into groups easily as a healer which would help me with the playtime constraints etc but can I do all this as 30/0/21??
---
&gt;Best way to do it is to just stumble upon a guild during leveling
---
I don't know about best but I will do it that way. I just plan to build up a friend list as I level, find some cool people and hopefully get invited to their guild. 
---
 Joining a guild before launch would feel strange to me. I mean not knowing a single person and be in the guild.
---
Complete nonsense.
---
There are 160K people _in this sub alone_, who would the kinds of player most likely to stick around for the longer-haul, not tourists for the first month.  That alone is enough to fill at least 40-50 "high pop" servers.
---
Even with layering, there's not a chance Blizzard hasn't at least run basic math on this.
---
Any Addon like this for horde?
---
We’re horde tho! 
---
Orc will be the race no doubt, just down to Rogue/Warrior. I change my mind every day
---
Yeah the zone sucks  a bit. Try taking a look at something like westfall if you want some full in unique loot action!
---
The drop down menus for faction and group size aren’t working on mobile. It drops down, but then doesn’t register when I try to select an option.
---
thank you
---
Gross.
---
&gt; Currently leaning Warlock or Shadow Priest... some dungeons and PUG raids sprinkled in.
---
For the love of all that is holy, don't shadow priest and try to pug for your own sanity. They are one of the more looked down specs out there. If you're pugging, a respectable affliction warlock will make your life a lot more enjoyable.
---
Classic is not 1.12 client
---
You will never have issues finding a spot as a mage. Any guild going for Naxx will need atleast 7. Best way to get introduced to guilds is to meet and play with others in game and get an understanding of the community.
---
Really? Wow that is surprising.
---
Then pick another class that will do a better job at the role you want.
---
Dwarf rogues are cool and stone form works like a pseudo shadow cloak.

* Priest

Druid tank, priest heals.  Battle rez, soulstone, divine intervention, cc, rez, good buffs, summons, paladin gets all the plate, hunter gets the mail, druid gets leather, warlock gets stam cloth, and priest gets spirit cloth.
---
We all have mains that we will level solo, but when we're all on, we'll take advantage of that sweet sweet rested xp in dungeons.
---
Me not that kind of orc.
---
About a few months into TBC. Those were fun couple of months but just didn't keep me interested like vanilla did.
---
Probably because it's funny to kill tiny gnomes when you're that big
---
Warrior grinding at 60 with fury or arms is just okay. Picking mining is lucrative, particularly when you can solo DM and grab the thorium nodes. Herb and alchemy is also a decent pick.
---
In phase 1 you could farm elements (badlands is good) for easy cash and be close to BRM to pick up a group.
---
A lot of people seem to forget about black Pearl's too which I think come from chests in STV?
---
It will be full cleared week 1 by some guilds. Just need 40 people to no life.
---
Some kind of product made with love/altruism would not be a cash grab.
---
Also classic wouldn't grab any cash if it featured changes to the monetization model because despite how out of touch Blizzard may seem they haven't gone full retard quite yet. No changes is a primary selling point. If Blizzard announced WoW tokens or Unarmored epic mounts for classic in the cash shop I think people would throw a shit fit and classic would not be worth the investment.

if you can make the whole map zone for it would be much better and less clusterfuck with quest and map movement. idk why the other guider always rewamps the map for the local quest locations. just use big map its markers. would be appreciated bro &lt;3
---
Will never work.
---
Facts.  As a paladin healer in pvp, nothing is more frustrating then getting curse of tongues and watching all those mages just run by and  not decursing
---
Totally. Watched a couple of your videos. I was just pointing out even further how lame desolace is. Bad loot.
---
Blizz has set a precedent for servers holding up for major releases in the last 3 years and the only reason MC wouldn’t be fully cleared week 1 is if the servers do go down for a significant amount of time
---

You're not denying anything, the person playing can easily record or stream their content and monetize it as well. You're argument is very flawed, Blizzard has *all* the rights here. Streamers have none, and the players have none.
---
Make your wish come true: Create a post there.
---
There is a lot of theory crafting that post level 48 AoE grinding in Mara and BRD is not only great xp but also gold
---
No you cannot.
---
Considering their swiss army knife is pretty rusty with most of their utility being fairly sub-par, and lacking a res for dungeons, I'm hard pressed to suggest druid to a stranger.
---
It's not that it wouldn't work, it's just priest will feel better and the biggest problem priests have is leveling solo which you have taken care of.
---
That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I want to play on a server that isn't overcrowded, not one that's a ghost town.
---
Have another one.
---
Yeah no music can so immediately and thoroughly make me feel or think something as the login screen music
---
Spend 2 months leveling it and let us know.
---
Op is lying, it's not better than nothing. You're probably gonnadie.
---

That's bad
---
If you’re not in the financial position to “waste” 20 days of sub time, then you can’t be mad that you don’t get the perks of subbing early. Namely, participating in the stress test and the name reservation on Monday. Do you know how entitled you sound thinking blizzard OWES you the opportunity to take part in a stress test for free?
---
No, because there are going to be very few raid spots available for Ret Paladins and I don't want you to take one of them from me.

It's a motor vehicle used for transportation that's been coated with a material that refracts light with a wavelength around 700~635nm for aesthetic purposes. They also go faster than other cars.

In BC I twinked a 29 hunter with that same gun as Marksmen. The damage was completely unfair.

Level one and let us know.

10K is just my guess based on the assumption that they don't add more servers before phase 2. They said layers will be remove before phase 2. So if there are only 8 servers in phase 2, players in each server would probably reach 10k in peak time and that's totally 80k.
---
Do you just show up wherever this picture is linked like a genie somehow, or are you a huge wow fan, I'm only asking because I'm not subbed here so I'm also transient to this sub.
---
first you say a real video card would be nice (when an APU in this situation works just fine), then you it should work on low settings (wrong), now you're saying you dont need those specs. 
---
Ok your opinion officially means nothing, Thanks for your input.
---
the downside to the cinematic was it made the classes it didnt feature feel sorta disconnected from the game (was priest in vanilla)
---
Play what you like mate, I was not only a ret palla in vanilla but I was also pretty terrible. I got groups and managed to do ok in 5 mans, learned from guildies and kind people I met in pugs. I even managed to do the epic mount quest.
---
 You'll never be in a top guild or set the world alight as a ret palla but you'll do 5mans, maybe sneak into a few pug raids and you'll have a blast doing it.
---
I find that you can level Elemental like you would play enhance... the added benefit are clear casting and later dbl crit damage... the downside is longer ghost wolf and less melee crit chance / flurry...
---
I noticed on beta having elemental was super helpful when facing melee elites... I could more efficiently kill them with frost shock and take no damage... had I been enhance I would been OOM...
---
I have played alot of shaman in Vanilla (not pserv) I had a 52 tauren who was enhance and a troll 60 ele/resto (or just plan raid spec resto)
---
I don't actually have much experience with priests or shamans, but shadow priests can fuck up some melee classses in PvP, especially if you go troll and get lucky with blackout procs. For shaman all I know is that the 30/0/21 spec is nice because you do both PvP and PvE with it.
---
Imagine comparing a skilled player to an unskilled player. A skilled rogue player will win against a mage that is borderline mentally retarded 8 times out of 10. As a mage your bar isn't too high in this regard. As long as you can think and breathe at the same time you should be doing fine against the average rogue.
---
Idk why I'm continuing this argument tbh, it's really dumb, maybe I'm just bored. Blizzard owns everything within World of Warcraft. They let people stream their game and that's all the permission anyone needs.

---
But we are both horde. What shadow Council nonsense is this??
---
not all of us get to enjoy being a regular ass human in the real world ;\_;
---
Warlocks do 15% extra dmg thanks to shadow weaving. If the raid has about 5 locks and you count their extra dmg as your dmg (since without you they would do less dmg) you are going to be a good addition to the raid. You can also throw heals if shit goes south. However no one should bring more than 1 spriest. So u will have a hard time finding raids. If u want big numbers and cant see support value go warlock.
---
Both good in pvp. Not sure since never did lock, but spriest seems harder in pvp
---
Horde or Alliance?!
---
The wife desperately prefers Alliance, and we have a lot of nostalgia for those zones as we met playing in Vanilla.  I also have a great guild situation lined up.
---
However, on retail, I play Horde.  She gets by because of Blood Elves, which aren’t in Classic.  There are no Horde races she likes.  However, Horde is where my heart is.
---
Being a good Ret involves using all of your support abilities, farming some extra consumables, and probably taking engineering to cover some gaps in your toolkit
---
Also expect to take twice as long to gear up. Some dungeon groups won't invite you as Ret DPS. I know if I were a Rogue or Fury I wouldn't invite you to my BRD group.
---
I didnt have test the beta.
---
I want to go fully in WoW Classic at the release.
---
What interesting things could I do during the stress test ?
---
Verify and configure addon ? Or it will be different at the release ? Can I save them ?
---
F.
---
Haha yeah I think so just a set of curtains
---
2 weeks of irl time, whats unrealistic about that?
---
This is pretty solid and I agree with basically all of it. I was surprised when most were saying Hunter, considering their DPS is considered mediocre because their pets don't scale. That and arcane shot, and your weapon isn't as crucial as everyone is acting. Sure it's very important, but a rogue/warrior are definitely higher up there imo.
---
You have a really bad memory leak on mobile platforms. Crashes after 3 "next"s. So it's either pulling massive tables and bricking it, or it's a major memory leak. This is with an Note S9.

BUT I’M A DAD GAMER. I HAVE KIDS AND A CAREER AND I CAN ONLY PLAY 15 MINUTES A DAY SO I THINK LAYERING IS PERFECT.

here is "classicwow", not "classicwowexcludingchina".
---
OK. The real reason is I want to make it a big news. 
---
No, i am kidding.
---
I remember not bothering with a tank or healer in RFC.  It seemed more prudent to take bandages and 5dps to mitigate damage by killing mobs quicker.
---
Hard to focus on sheeping Star if your shoulder hurts!
---
I think that message will lead to a quicker group kick than asking if you can reserve off spec gear

As I started reading I was thinking you’re just trolling but damn you’re actually serious...
---
It’s understandable if your like 12 yrs old because you likely don’t know any better but holy shit do you not have a grasp of how complex software programming is?
---
They mentioned it themselves that they only found the last patch for classic and that it had many problem running on the latest client and assets which they have developed over time.
---
Do you not take in information in anything you do? There were a crap ton of bugs that had to be fixed in beta. Imagine if they just put out classic the moment they found the last patch of vanilla...
---
Who gives a shit if you’re not playing we know you will you’re just as stupid as you sound
---
Pantheon sounds like this, in a lot of ways. They’re aiming for more of an EverQuest feel, but I don’t doubt the combat systems will be heavily influenced by WoW (and others). The game is still in pre-alpha and has been for a while, so it probably won’t be out for a few more years. The devs certainly have their specific vision of the game, though, and refuse to release until it’s ready.
---
Don’t forget to use blessing of protection.
---
And I'm apparently a horse's ass.

Mass quit the only thing they have to play lol I don’t think so

2. Vendor + Repair.

3. Die.

4. Spirit Rez at Razor Hill. 
---
The fuck is this guide? Also other shit like take the "esports shortcut"?
---
You can always store it in the bank until level 40 or until you absolutely need gold for skills and then either A/H it or vendor it.
---
Vendoring it when you don’t need to leaves money on the table.
---
15 minutes until another post like this
---
Everquest is a remnant from another era - it established its brand while its monetization model and genre was still hugely relevant - you can't replicate WoW/Everquest's success with a new brand in today's industry, which is the point I'm making.
---
Love melee classes, so I initially rolled a Tauren Warrior.  But couldn't get it past lvl 13, so I rolled a UD rogue.  Couldn't get passed building combos, so I abandon him.  Then on a lark I made a UD warlock and quickly feel in love with that class.  Raided with her and did some serious PVP.  On off nights I made a NE druid on another server.  That druid became my raider (resto) throughout WoLTK.  Come classic, I'm rolling a druid as my main and a lock as my alt.
---
Plenty of people said this when they switched from sharding the starting zones to layering 1-60.
---
It doesn’t matter. They’re gonna do what makes them the most money
---
I lost 10 points worth of IQ reading this and I am not particularly gifted to begin with.
---
Why you gotta do me like that?
---
Yeah, you have no fucking idea what you're talking about. You only ever have to worry about appropriating someone's likeness for commercial gain. And there are exceptions for live broadcasts in every state. And that's real-life. You have no likeness or rights in the game.
---
It also contains potassium benzoate.
---
Seems pretty easy to choose alliance in this case.
---
I've heard Warlocks become really strong in PvP and PvE after they get a ton of gear. I'm worried that I won't have enough time to grind out raid gear with the time I'll play. However I'm also worried I'll lose out on rogue gear due to competition. I might just go Rogue for the WPvP power.
---
the laptop should replace the desktop pc. a laptop without external monitor and keyboard/mouse would be terrible ;D
---
Indeed.
---
sigh..
---
Yep. you got me.
---
nothing more natural than double crusader enchant on a lvl 19 rogue.
---
now moving on...
---
I gave you actual examples from the game, literal titles and examples of when main characters (Khadgar, Thrall, Sylvannas, etc.) call you champions or hero of the horde / alliance. I know it sucks to be wrong, and probably even moreso since I am an asshole, but you should probably come to terms with it.
---
There seems to be quite a bit on the EU forums now https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/c/wow-classic
---
That's $10.  $10 to STRESS TEST for Blizzard?? You're an idiot if you think that's fair or even good for the game. I mean it's good for Blizzard's bottom line.  Do you own stock in ActiBlizz?  Because that's the only way you can make your argument in good faith without simply being a fool.
---
Dwarf or Orc Rogue? Stoneform or Hardiness? which would provide more long-term benefit?
---
Wait...RP-PVP are actually coming out?! Did Blizzard confirm it somewhere?!
---
Its not THAT awful if you go holy/prot and try to aoe. That said, as someone who plans to heal hardcore while leveling, I’d still go down ret to get mana cost reduction for seals/judgement and get the judgement cooldown. Thatll help for leveling. Then holy for divine int and so on. The pushback is kinda meh, because of concentration aura and unless youll be on a hardcore pvp server and ganking its not too useful, and apparently improved seal of righteousness is awful.
---
I'm struggling between druid and pally. Both will be healing in raids so that's a wash.
---
Druid leveling, dungeons, and pvp seems much more interesting. I just can't get passed the look and possibility of full T2 and a hand of rag on a pally. The argument sounds ridiculous, cosmetics vs engagement but I can't get over it. 
---
Hopefully by August 26 I can decide
---
Love that this sub is bringing back the popularity of the simpsons cursed frogurt bit.
---
Pfft. Too easy matchup.
---
How about you do some guides on mage v shamans or mage v locks. 
---
N please!
---
Not only that, its niche. It's a niche genre. Modern mmos are so much more gameplay oriented and and less grindy because the audience isnt there for a big name AAA sandbox style game.
---
WoW can do it because its wow and it's already got many of the assets. But I'd honestly not expect any modern game to ever do something like this from scratch. Too expensive for too niche an audience.
---
I was really impressed with some of the steps in the warlock guide. Some of the steps almost looked bugged like - 'destroy your hearthstone' or 'die'. But they were actually really well thought out. Even if you guys dont change a thing I think this site is going to be really popular.
---
pros of allys: No que on BGs easy for warlocks to get into a guild, Iornforge is best in slot city, Paladins 
---
Pros of horde: BG dominate, FOR THE HORDE, shamans
---
cons of allys: Gnomes, sissybois who love pve
---
cons of horde: Ogrimmar looks like it was made with MS paint
---
Dwarf Priest is not an option.
---
Right except because it's so streamlined and easy to use, it can be abused. Just because someone has a bad experience with a player doesn't mean their name should be uploaded to a list that can then be easily downloaded and updated by everyone using an addon. That shit is downright scary. As soon as you start automating/streamlining social features, things become messy. I hope these addons go nowhere and aren't widely used.
---
Nice !
---
Did someone have classify it by zone/level ?
---
Bro you’re literally just spewing bullshit that can be disproven with 5 minutes of googling. Please stop talking about stuff you know nothing about. Just in life in general too
---
I've been going back through Warcraft 3 to remind myself of where the setting was at during vanilla WoW, and it made me realized why I've always rolled Horde and always saw them as the good guys. The humans are *so unlikable* in Warcraft 3, which was my first exposure to the franchise.
---
Tutorial? The humans are enslaving orcs who are just trying to leave.
---
Reign of Chaos? The Prophet shows up with news on how to survive the coming apocalypse. He tells King Terenas, who throws him out and dooms his people over pride. He tells Arthas, who doesn't listen and dooms his people over revenge. He tells Antonidas, who laughs him off and dooms his people with overconfidence. He tells Thrall, who says "okay" and saves his people.
---
Frozen Throne? The human general is overtly racist and is single-handedly responsible for driving Kael'Thas and the Blood Elves away from the Alliance.
---
So coming into vanilla WoW, I had no sympathy for the Alliance, and nothing but respect for Thrall, Cairne, and Sylvanas. I like some of the other Alliance races, but the humans always seem to front and center, and I could only assume that all the human kingdoms were as rotten as they were in War3.
---
Who is "they"?

---
Thanks for the advice! But I’m gonna rebel and go troll probably, I’m just really feeling it. Also someone kinda proved / worked out trolls are better in pve compared to Orcs at a certain high gear level, and especially when lower on health do to the troll racial. I’m pretty sure I want to roll horde for classic anyways, and I won’t be that invested in PvP.
---
I can't be bothered to download and config  half a dozen/dozen addons just for the UI. I'm using UI overhauls.
---
I'm rolling with Tukui + EZJunk + Questie and/or classicwow.live/leveling on second monitor during leveling. Also use dashingDismount for travel forms and mounts.
---
This is the full list I'm rolling for a Priest, these are all Classic updated:
---
A complete UI overhaul like [*TukUI*](https://git.tukui.org/Tukz/Tukui/-/archive/Classic/Tukui-Classic.zip)  with [*Clique*](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/clique/) (mouse-over cast on mouse buttons), if for some reason the UI overhaul isn’t tracking outgoing heals, download [*HealComm*](https://codeload.github.com/Aviana/HealComm/zip/master).
---
Use [*Questie*](https://github.com/AeroScripts/QuestieDev/wiki/FAQ&amp;Readme) to help you with leveling (read the FAQ), along with [*dashingDismount*](https://github.com/ForgetfulScarab/dashingDismount) to easily dismount using skills also [*EZJunk*](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/ezjunk) to sell junk items easily, also displays the sell value of the items.
---
For raiding you want to use [*DeadlyBossMod*](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Classic) along with [*DetailsDamageMeter*](https://github.com/Tercioo/Details-Damage-Meter/releases) ( “-Classic” tag among the releases) in a later phase consider an auto need addon for the ZG coins &amp; bijous.
---
Consider using something like [*Auctioneer*](https://gitlab.com/norganna-wow) to easily determine the AH value of an item. Alternatively, if you are fine with the default UI but want to enhance it capabilities, take a look at [*CTMod*](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/ctmod). Note that [*WeakAuras2* ](https://github.com/WeakAuras/WeakAuras2)is also a popular addon, consider browsing profiles for it on [*Wago.io*](https://wago.io/weakauras/classes/priest) when it becomes available.
---
In the pinned pole on Reddit, more than 50% voted they will play Horde. Doesn't sound like underdogs to me.
---
No, *you* have and upvote.
---
Bruh, rogue is like the easiest thing to handle as a mage after a warrior. Show me how to deal with a fear spamming warlock or turbo shifting druid.
---
maybe he updated the image but what i see it as is its 2:03 to walk to raven hill then flying from there to darkshire it ends up being a total travel time of 4:03
---
That's good!
---
where does rogue rank?
---
Sometimes the thought bothers me that I miss out on potential friendships or cool guilds by picking X server over Y server. Such is fate I guess, just like making decisions in life.
---
I just hope I end up on a satisfactory server, where things work out for me. I'm very casual with limited random play time, so guilds that are focusing on committed raiders are generally not an option for me (and that seems to be most guilds).
---
Nice appeal to authority dip shit.
---
Wow I did not expect you to comment on my response haha. Yeah I completely agree it's a very hard line to walk for a developer. Do you give the fans the exact same thing as literally as possible? Or do you give them the same "feel" and fix certain things that at the end of the day just don't make sense. How far is too far when fixing those issues? So I get the impossible position they were in in that respect. 
---
I am glad we are able to experience classic as a timepiece and love letter to the fans though, obviously. I am eager to see how it "feels" since I haven't been a part of beta or stress tests yet.
---
Neither incinerate or shadowfury are in vanilla.
---
There were a number of people who said exactly this on this sub-Reddit. Misinformed, delusional people, but I've read it personally 3-4 times.
---
The Onyxia key quest is very long and time consuming. The fight itself is much less difficult than Rag, both mechanically and tuning.
---
At least I don't. Betcha the Horde started it. xD
---
&gt; Now my heart is telling me Druid
---
Then you want to go Druid.
---
&gt;lack of a resurrect is kind of shying me away from it
---
This one ability is *not* worth going a class you're less interested in. You are going to spend a lot of time *alone* and solo leveling. *If* you are a good healer, you will not be using resurrect too often in dungeons anyways.
---
Think about this: Many Priests bemoan the fact that after a raid wipe they are stuck reviving everyone. It's nice to have, but you can easily let "some other Priest" be the revive monkey.
---
Druids are much desired for their utility in raids and healing is pretty reasonable, you shouldn't have too much trouble healing any raids except Naxx and if you're geared well you will make it just fine.
---
There will also be, a massive abundance of Priests. Priests will be the De-Facto healing class and will be a dime a dozen.
---
Gearing as a Druid will be easier. Solo leveling will be easier. It sounds like you want to go Druid (love) versus Priest (logical/practical) but in reality, a Druid will be just as logical/practical if you're already set on being a healer.
---
Plus wild forms are a lot of fun to play around with, and travel form is really nice for getting around early without a 100G level 40 mount.
---
Dang.
---
Can you not add a flair to a post either? Some sports subs are able to add misleading etc. to the title. Just curious!
---
You are right about that but from my experience, as long as you get a blizzard slow on them before any of them break they stay close enough.
---
Stopped playing pubg a few months ago because of the hax.... meanwhile community is just like yeah GIT GUD... like yeah I'll pass running hax.

Except you do have Minecraft which is primarily younger gamers and proves graphics aren't a requirement for success.  There is probably room for a MMORPG that scales back the graphics and animations but has deep RPG aspects and a huge world to explore.

Blue path best path. Get those mining nodes and potential chest spawns along the way 👌
---
Get John Hight back in mainland USA sitting in front of computer eating a hot pocket where he belongs.  Dude is a fish out of water in China.
---
I could see myself using such addon, although I would probably get too bored if an addon played my class instead of me, and not like downranking and precasting is that hard.
---
Was looking into this one aswell. Looks similar to shadowed unit frames.
---
rofl like the people on this subreddit are gonna even raid in the first 2 months. Their concerns are squarely rooted in level 27 gameplay.
---
You're making absolutely 0 sense. Layering is in the game to prevent overcrowding. You dont want 50k people in your starting zone fighting over 10 boars. You're lying to yourself if you think that's what you want. They aren't gonna waste time and money creating more servers just to have them be unpopulated. the whole point of layering is to prevent this. It isn't to segregate the community, they have layering in the game for probably a month only in the starting zones and then it goes away. Stop being a whiny bitch please
---
You're\* :-)
---
I know the story to a certain extent, I don't think I will play Warcraft 3. I'd much rather read the Wikia, it's a lot more fun than playing some boring RTS. It's not even half as good as Age of Empires 2.
---
Sure it is, it's just not possible without Morrowgrain *or* cloth.
---
If 3k server caps are wrong I don't wanna be right
---
I'm not defending that, stop making shit up and use your head.
---
Morrowgrain
---
\^ You can ignore him, he thinks Stadia and Nvidia an't authorized. And they are XD
---
Respectfully, and assuming I understand you right , 2x each levels gained will do absolutely nothing for you longterm.
---
A healthy routine would be 120 pushups/sit-ups/weightless squats every day. 
---
I do this routine in roughly 15 minutes every morning to start my day.
---
Honestly if it sounds like bragging I implore you guys to try and realize that once it becomes part of your morning it’s really nothing, does wonders for my body and mental state in terms of being in forward momentum mode.
---
I can do the 120 pushups in around 3 minutes. 60 with a 1 minute break.
---
I used to be an ACE certified personal trainer and I’ve been a gamer for the entirety of my life.
---
Your stress response  and overall enjoyment of the game/ health and ability will go up.
---
Do each one at a different part of the day.
---
Personally I workout 5x a week, but I know that’s unnecessary for most on here.
---
I work a desk job and that’s just to stay prime.
---
Merge 'em. But do it properly this time.
---
Remindme! 19 days
---
Then post a link to a Blizzard owned site/article/quote saying so.
---
Oh, didn't even think about a VPN :)
---
I am a spy
---
Always like the show, but I'm not sure I see the benefit of interviewing someone who when asked about why you should play druid says to play warrior. I get that he's doing a bit or whatever, but it just feels pointless or counterproductive from an information perspective.

There will be far less Shamans than Hunters. Class exclusivity may or may not be a good thing in your mind.
---
Both will be fairly fun to level.
---
Hunters at level 1 are probably one of the strongest classes but fall off at higher levels compared to other DPS classes. Still viable for raids.
---
Shamans will end up healing and respec costs are a bitch if you want to PVP.
---
If you ever fuck up as a hunter people will sling huntard at you.
---
Shaman is kind of a messy character and Hunters are less so, but Hunters also have to keep their pets happy.
---
So, ymmv.

Swear I was playing in vanilla. Maybe I'm wrong, my memory isn't great. Either way I spent a long time playing
---
Threx is the Alliance equivalent.
---
Just like at 60.  If you're unprepared, prepare to get shat on.
---
Lmao. Exactly what's going to happen.
---
For me (not lvling only dungeons, ymmv) I would go feline swift + feral until 30.  Then respec to get omen, and the rest into feral again leaving out swift if primarally tanking.  If doing more dps than tanking, or if pvping a bunch, 35 or 36 starts furor so that your set on it near 40 when you can get wolves head.
---
I'd get swiftness anyway, as I feel you could leave delaying 1 point of claws and especially charge at lower lvls wouldn't cost you as much time as you gain from it....but this is just a gut feeling and I have no proof.  Wouldn't guess that it would make much of a diff either way.
---
Minecraft is not an MMO, nor does it have a subscription fee, or even a high price tag. I never referred to graphics being required to succeed - a game's visuals/gimmick is what sells it in the first place, but that doesn't necessarily mean good graphics.
---
I agree that there could be a place for a "real" MMORPG, but it would need to be produced at a very low cost to turn a profit on the niche market it'd serve.
---
But think back of how many shitty MMO attempts we've seen, even by established studios with large budgets - they're clearly hard to make, even disregarding modern design choices like accessibility.
---
Not a class problem but rather faction problem.
---
Considering PvE, which faction would be the better ?
---
At first sight, it seems that it is Alliance thank to paladin and dwarf priest (fear ward).
---
But shaman are good raid healers too.
---
What is your opinion on that ?
---
Do you think it is impactfull ?
---
No, he didn't. I edited the post to avoid misunderstanding.
---
Na
---
Darn, sucks because I will not be supporting anything with the Twitch name on it. Rather not endorse such a shitty company.
---
remember that when you get one-shot from a warrior at 60
---
I downloaded the classic client from the launcher but it still says that the game is unavailable to be played. Why is this?
---
Those people are playing retail.
---
Well according to you everything is a script. What you just stated above is a script. When you go to work it’s a script. So what isn’t a script?
---
&gt; They are implemented that way
---
No, they literally are *not* implemented that way. That's not something you can argue about.
---
&gt; If you separate everything like that then you essentially have separate servers (which doesn't fix the problem layering is here for.)
---
No, it completely 100% solves the problem layering is "here for", without the enormous downside of ruining the community aspect of the game.
---
&gt; Layers are to balance the population not the server's economy or social space.
---
Then let's balance the others too by making the layers independent.
---
PVE is so scripted that a bot can do it and macros in Vanilla DID do it.
---
No piece of software has ever been competitive in PVP.
---
Yes, in the interface menu. 'Display Cloak', and 'Display Helmet'.
---
The closer it gets the harder it is to know what to do with myself. I pretty much run around on alts thinking bout things while watching YouTube vanilla and classic vids
---
Honey, we been knew.
---
thanks :D
---
Hunter or Shaman is your best bet.
---
Shaman if you want to heal and fuck around with totems.
---
Hunter if you want to DPS and fuck around with pets.
---
Lol good one.
---
&gt;not literally every Forsaken is evil
---
I know I read about some Dwarf Adventurer who got lost in Tirisfal Glades and some Forsaken helped him and was cool to him. I know they aren't all bad, but their nature disgusts me.
---
Why is the 2nd step for the Human Mage to destroy Hearthstone? lol
---
Pushing myself to the max in regards of DPS/HPS and clearing the content as fast as we possibly can
---
Smiling grin face with no mustache.
---
XD
---
Terrible idea, you wont be able to train anything except maybe in Darnassus? (i could be wrong)
---
I really don't care about this stress test or the names. I only jumped in to call you a dick for poor-shaming.
---
Yeah but that's when I poop
---
lol
---
&gt; the implementation is completely different
---
It's literally, and I mean literally, the exact same tech they use for sharding. The similarities are significantly stronger than the differences. Blizzard just tweaked sharding a bit, called it by a new name, and half of the subreddit fell for it.
---
Both have plus and negative.
---
Regular people with good sleep will be 60 much longer than it will take to kill rag.
---
I heard stay safe is looking for day 12 rag kill... unlikely but crazy stuff has been done before - going to be fun to watch while it takes me forever to level :)
---
See the problem is that these people should be adapting to the genre; the genre shouldn't be adapting to them.
---
I'd be an asshole if I played battlefield and started whining on the forums for them to add MMORPG elements to the game.
---
It's one thing to have a casual version of an MMORPG, which is what WoW was at launch, but it's another thing to dilute core elements of the genre. If someone wants to not interact with anyone ever, and only play 45 minute sessions, they should not expect to see all the content or just stick to offline RPGs.
---
Go Night Elf if you love them, for sure. Racials don't mean shit unless you're playing in a top tier hardcore raiding guild. Keep in mind you'll be investing a lot of your time looking at your character, so make sure you pick something that *you* like
---
this reply just gave me cancer. Sigh. Never change, people who want pvp in a pve game.
---
Then merge the servers. They could even use their sharding tech to do it if they just kept each layer 100% independent from one another except for things like player names.
---
You showed em!
---
From what I understand, in an MMO game before wow (not sure which one, probably EQ) when you had high level gear or enchants your character would twinkle, hence they would be twinked.  Not sure how that came to mean only low level characters though.
---
The issue is wow open world pvp skirts the line of carebear. You don’t lose items , exp, progress at all for Pvp. Pve carries wow and always will.
---
Ok thex cant fool us.
---
Guild Message of the day: Have fun but min/max and play what you want and enjoy the game and explore everything.
---
We're going to try to down Rag on the first week.
---
They are not hideous you are litterally just saying that because you’re on the classic hype / bfa hate train. Just like everyone else on this thread
---
Ion Hazzikostas has come out to explicitly state that layering will not exist into Phase 2, because that's when World Bosses are introduced.
---
I hope you die from it.
---
Balanced around 2500-3k. Otherwise you are right, after you go past that number all sorts of things break.
---
MC and BWL will probably be the better part of a year in terms of content progression. Not to mention BRD, Ubrs and Lbrs are also all housed in BRM.
---
BRD alone makes it a gank haven for undergeared 60s
---
This competitive outlook definitely might be the push I need for myself
---
Weird concept to not support terrible companies, right?
---
Plan to make a Rogue with engineering as PVP is my main focus, what racial abilites would benefit me the most? Orc's 25% global stun resist *and* Blood Fury seems like the obvious choice but could Stoneform be equally as useful?
---
congrats you won the dumbest post of the day
---
Saw that, thanks!
---
Same reason that undead leader in night elf, and horde king is goblin, it's fantasy lmao, learn your memes mon
---
That's what layering is.... It's just a seamless way to merge the servers.
---
Doesn't even load on older OS
---
Nah, sorry, I’m coming in.
---
I’d rather role play as the “silent mercenary Druid” than play with the “Alright boys! We got cloth boys! Get me some tin boys!” streamer crowd.
---
I’ll see you there 😃
---
There are number of reasons of why I wouldn't literally do that that should be self explanatory.
---
&gt;based solely on fortnite
---
Based solely on Candy Crush, Clash of Clans, etc
---
If you are playing Fortnite on a phone because you have to then your are poor, if you play Fortnite on the phone because you like it then you are casual scum.
---
How do I join a guild prior? I have no contacts.
---
You cap the servers at 3k and implement dynamic respawns for the first week. You add way more than 8 total servers. You have server queues, and yes you fight for mobs. If a server dies somewhere down the road you have a free transfer to another realm, you might have to change your name if you choose to transfer oh well that's better than layering by a mile. That's the best way to do it.  They won't do that because it would cost blizzard more money and all the retail morons will rage quit because a server queue takes 45 minutes and they want to have their instant gratification. 
---
Classic should be handled exactly like vanilla was handled. It shouldn't be some hybrid where they use modern garbage server mechanics that ruins everyone experience and has people popping in and out of zones or mobs disappearing and crafting exploits, private servers have been doing it for over a decade. Blizzard just can't let that happen they need to find a way to pinch pennies and ruin the game by limiting servers and implementing layering.
---
Yeah, it was super weird with Gul’Dan being a massive giant with no explanation in the Legion introduction area, too.
---
I'll test out TukUI + Questie + EZJunk + dashingDismount and EZCoordinates if TukUI is missing it. I had a list of close to 20 addons which I decided to shrink down. This covers everything I need during the leveling phase.
---
Thank you, but I already know the lore of Warcraft.
---
Yeah im allaince for same reason. She loved blood elfs but wants to gnome.
---
With its own dedicated devs to add content that would fit in with the older style.
---
I’ve tried in the browser from Apollo and also on Firefox (iPhone 6), and it’s not letting me choose the options. The choices appear, but after I tap them they go away and my choice isn’t reflected.
---
You dont matter in the equation. Doesn't matter if you exist or not.
---
By not downloading an Addon made by someone who has no affiliation with that company, pretty smart way! /s
---
This right here. Even if you could argue PvP is scripted, it not nearly in the same level as PvE which the same thing ALWAYS happens
---
Don't say that, his dad works at blizz, you know
---
You're right, the BFA Models and animations are gorgeous, i dont know why they dont put them in Classic, it would please so many people. More BFA please /s
---
Lazypig
---
6 months in, people will be saying "Don't worry, Blizzard *promised* they'd remove it when Naxx comes out". Like always, these people just keep letting Blizzard move the goalposts.
---
Layering will be around until the servers run dry and the game officially dies.
---
A giant dwarf!
---
Orc PVP.
---
Tauren PVE.
---
Tauren are easy targets in PVP, and Orc stun resist is invaluable in PVP.
---
Tauren's HP bonus in PVE is very nice to have, and your size matters less.
---
Plus, Tauren warriors are the biggest, fattest, thiccest meanest fucking murder cows on the planet and look fierce as shit.
---
But Orc will take the cake in PVP.
---
It is indeed a meme. There are [tons](https://reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bstkbx/are_druids_really_as_bad_as_they_seem/) [of](https://reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bqhpso/hello_is_a_classicvanilla_druid_really_that_bad/) [threads](https://reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bw4xrc/is_balance_druid_really_that_bad/) [asking](https://reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/asg62l/druids_seem_kinda_bad/) [about](https://reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9rnsl8/resto_druid_in_classic_really_that_bad/) druids being bad, and almost every response is 'No, they're fine'.
---
I doubt that they'll have feral**s** in their raid. They might have a feral in their raid.
---
I only need 3:
---
1. Map that's windowed
---
2. Quest markers so I don't waste too much time
---
3. DPS meter
---
Thanks for letting me know
---
Ill have to choose carefully O_o
---
Right, it is 2500-3k concurrent players. Thats what the game was designed around. They expanded a little in BC and some more in wrath but that 45K is a useless number because they aren't all online at once. The population cap will probably be vanilla, so less than 3k per layer, and when the layering goes away you have the normal cap of 2500-3k and queues for anyone above that.
---
Can you swap weapons while sapped?
---
HEY! lol
---
Mulgore and TB are two of the best in the game.
---
Warrior is the most social class in the game.  You make gold by being social.  You sell yourself as a tank (Orb reserve runs, etc.).  You become social with a healer and farm—remember they suck solo as well.  The answer of how to play warrior, whether PVP or PVE, is to make friends.
---
How certain are you that they can't be parried? I can't find info on that anywhere. I see stuff about how they can't parry. How they can't be disarmed. But I don't see anything about how they can't be parried.
---
Blueplz the podcast ah I miss TB
---
There were around 10 servers when the test launched (There were 20 before the stress test started but some where removed but not the last 10 so there were numbers between 1 and 20 in their names so some people got confused by that) and 10-15 minutes into the test they removed most of those servers leave 2 or 3
---
I saw both of these, I thought Story Line was a bit over the top especially on PvP server where your head has to be on a swivel.
---
I tried Immersion and loved it on the Beta... I am going to run it when the game comes out.
---
1/10
---
Start walking now, Stave off those leg blood clots
---
Gnome anything
---
Horde pvp and alliance pve
---
I take your point I guess. Thanks. Better to adjust expectations
---
MMORPG..
---
&gt;Looking at recent polls, it seems nearly 60% of you have never played on a private server, which means 60% of you have an unrealistic expectation of what Classic WoW will be, based on what Classic Wow used to be. I am here to tell you that just about everything you are crusading for, is wrong.
---
WE DETERMINE WHAT OUR FATES WILL BE! WE WILL NOT BE STRONGARMED BY THOSE FOREIGN PLAYERS AND HOSTS - THIS IS CLASSIC AND EVERYONE SHALL HAVE FUN!
---
Shaman baby.
---
You never played them before, it's a new year, a new WOW, a new you!
---
Plus competent Shamans are never gonna struggle to find a spot in dungeons or raids.
---
North road and grind exp ofc.
---
Unpopular opinion indeed. I used to play on a low pop vanilla retail server at that time and it was nothing but FUN, feels like throwing money out of the window, always need to alt on a new server, etc. Compared to Nost where I had the most FUN ever, always populated which ever the hour. It’s a MMORPG after all not a RPG.

This is stupid I'm going to drink 10 BAWLS a day

 Hi. There is a beta version for Classic that I made during the last stress test, available here [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/storyline/files/2732340](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/storyline/files/2732340)
---
Sadly since I didn't get access to the beta and there is no open  testing, there will not be a proper release build ready for day one when  Classic launches. Blizzard really dropped the ball for add-on  developers here. But I will do my best to have something working as soon  as possible.
---
go NE because that's what you like. Racials are only for min/maxers. 
---
Plus, you can shadowmeld charge to get a surprise attack on Horde passing by. Very rare for warriors to catch opponents off guard.
---
Hi, /u/utd2096

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cnbqi8/is_anyone_who_was_there_in_emerald_dream_rppvp/). 
---
Serious raiders go Alliance. They are much better at early raids and stay better.
---
Horde get warchiefs but i think its on like a 6hr or 12 hr CD. (From a quest people will turn in for the items disregarding the buff.)
---
But they're treating it like their modern wow garbage where they release a new expansions and everything is time gated and takes 1 week to hit max level and complete all the content then you wait for the next patch and most subs just quit out of boredom.  Classic is actually a full game that takes months to get through the first phase of content, even then there's so much more enjoyment from making alts and farming gold, it has way more lasting appeal.
---
RemindMe! 28 Aug 2019
---
No effort troll post
---
All of the restrictions you're talking about only apply to endgame raiding and even then the min-maxing of specs isn't even necessary in the earlier raids. Classic has so much content that isn't based around endgame raiding. To me it sounds like you're looking at this from a modern mmorpg standpoint which doesn't really work when looking at classic where the content is very front-loaded.  
---
That said if you're class/spec decision is going to be mainly decided by it's performance in raids then you also need to keep in mind that a lot of the time raids will take whoever they can get in order to fill out their 40 man roster. The scale of raiding in classic creates a situation where raids are often forced to take whoever they can get. Unlike most modern mmo's, Classic is a marathon not a race. This only adds to the acceptance of un-optimal specs because max level characters are harder to come by and more valued.
---
Don't worry about it, the servers population caps have no reason to be higher than vanilla. Once layering goes away we will have normal sized servers, not overpopulated messes.
---
To expand on this, it was specifically in reference to over-geared tanks going dw fury for higher tps on private servers. I believe *that* warrior would out-dps a hunter, but I don't think we'll see dw fury tanks the same way we did on private servers due to some of the confirmed changes (crit suppression and parry rates, specifically).
---
Kinda like our lives
---
My commute is also more miles than minutes!
---
I guess it’s more realistic to move slower when stealthing. Hm. Not sure if it is a dealbreaker for the class or no
---
I love the looks and atmosphere but the efficiency for certain things is certainly a factor.
---
If you're a blacksmith and don't need access to the specialty trainers in Org then you have the mailbox, AH, trainer, and forge/anvil all right there by the pond. It's awesome, plus a short run to the flight master.
---
INJECT THIS STRAIGHT INTO MY VEINS
---
R i p John Bain. For sure I will be playing some classic blue plz when classic launches.
---
I never suggested otherwise.
---
My friends and me pick a random EU PVP server. If it sucks we migrate our char after a while. I cant be bothered about the money tbh. I only do it once anyway. Back in the days i had to scrape for my gamecards, but nowadays i have a job so yeah..
---
Hence why they went with layering rather than dynamic respawns.  Layering they can separate everyone into 2k-3k groups and keep all the spawn timers the same.  If there are 5 layers with 15k people then you get 3k on each layer and the economy is preserved.
---
Does anyone know of a minimap addon that has been updated for Classic WoW yet? Or one from BFA that works?
---
The game would absolutely have succeeded had they instead of going F2P (which they had planned all along) maybe added endgame content that the community was begging for. The MTX went in with the F2P because EA. There was absolutely no need to do this but EA tried to milk every drop from a product within the first 6 months. They have no vision towards the future. They absolutely had the numbers needed but they refused to put any endgame content in so everyone leveled the classes they wanted to then quit because there was nothing to do. Mismanaged into unprofitable is the thing that has been happening to MMO's for a long time.
---
But that's roleplaying to some level. Or at least being respectful. I'll be glad to see you there and /wave.
---
But if you log in The Wyrmrest Accord now in retail and go to Orgrimmar, 9 times out of 10 people will be talking about Trump.
---
If you ask about roleplaying, the most probable answer will be "RP in 2019 OMEGALUL".
---
Do you like healing? Because in Vanilla as a Paladin you're going to end up healing.
---
The T2 armor set is one of the coolest in WOW, but you sound like you want to play another class that can wear the Paladin T2, not that you actually want to play a Paladin.
---
People would quit in droves, you are crazy to think otherwise
---
Dammit..that's what I came here to post.
---
I had a 39 ret pally twink
---
A large part of the fun probably came from the chinese gold to get amazing enchants
---
It was a great time whomping on peeps
---
Set on mage. However, I cannot decide between male/female and professions. Any suggestions or reflections welcome !
---
This shit disgusts me and ruins all soul of the game. Clearly made for zoomers who zoom to retail.
---
Your classic Community experience is exactly what you make it. Just because you automatically assume your experience will be a failure does not mean anybody else's will.
---
But it pretty much fails anyway the moment you make a vague call out post like this.
---
Likely won't be quite 3K, original cap was 2500-3k.
---
If it was a BC thing then we won’t have it. But I do have fond memories of healing many runs for the Rams since healers were so sought after back then and I had lots of friends
---
Yep.  And piggybacking on that they would do it staggered across various regions.  Do an EU test during 'prime time' for that region and then another one for us Americans.  I'm at work guys.. Don't even get home til about 4pm PST.  What a crocker.
---
Or you can reroll on another server... Instead of quitting.
---
Druids are horrible at pretty much everything.  They aren't going to be taken as healers to dungeons because they don't even have a real rez.
---
Depends on the server. :P
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cil0yq/warcraft_radio_returns?sort=confidence

Some say his modem is still catching up on vent comms to this day.
---
According to a recent Countdown to Classic episode a lot of the old wow radio folks are getting back together to do something similar for Classic.
---
I downloaded it... but will it be trouble for me to play through that... Is that account ban worthy?
---
No, sorry, only engineers
---
That's not what we're referring to as roleplaying. I am specifically talking about dedicated in-character dialogue, not the act of playing an RPG.
---
Don't even try arguing, there are tons of folks here who conflate feeling the *VALUE* isn't there, with calling you a filthy poor.  It's not worth your time.
---
Here is the thing dog. Can and should are two different things. 
---
If you have a guild that doesn’t care about progression and is super casual. You will be fine. Your DPS will never leave the middle of the pack unless your team mates are complete trash/you out gear them by miles. You would be fine in PVP. But raids you would be more help to the raid as Holy/Hybrid Holy. 
---
Just know you are asking you’re guild to carry your dead weight in raids. 
---
My question to you would be. Why not look at Warrior or Rogue for melee DPS. 
---
I am a tank. I have mained Prot as a Paladin since BC prepatch. I have gone back Holy or gone Ret “for the good of the raid” a few times but I have always liked tanking. I am rolling Warrior because of this. I have mained a paladin for 14 years but I plan on Main Tanking for our guild. So I am rolling Warrior. 
---
Back in the day we never knew if a patch might change paladins for the better. BC and Wrath did that. But we know what we are getting in Classic. There will be no patch making hybrids viable. The class has been theory crafted for almost 15 years. We know what it can and can’t do. 
---
If you want to play a sub optimal build please do so. Just set realistic expectations. Last thing we need is another thread trying to get them to buff/fix hybrids. 
---
If we get BC/Wrath Classic I will be the first to re-role back to Paladin.
---
a lego nintendo ?!
---
Easy, just join the rp-pvp server.
---
And so Begins the trend that began with the private server Community, wanting to go home every 18 months.
---
It just depends on how the graveyards are set up in the area. Some can be exploited quite alot, like the kharanos one.
---
Casual scum. There it is again. You're gatekeeping. You do not get to decide who gets to be in the realm of video gaming. You're holding onto a very outdated view of gaming if you think the only correct platform is PC. What are you, Duke Nukem 3D?
---
&gt;With layering they can change the number to make it not overcrowded. Sitting here saying it's going to severely impact the starting zones without knowing the exact numbers is really stupid of you
---
You are in for a rude awakening at launch if you think that is a case.  Go ask other people if the launch starting area will be packed with layers. I'm not just pulling this out of my ass. Everything that Blizzard has said on the subject hints that layers will be equivalent to a vanilla realm at launch.
---
Undead male priests and warlocks.
---
Orc male/female shamans as well
---
Get chicks
---
I played 800 hours of ESO from March 2018 until December 2018 (got the game in 2015 when it went B2P, but didn't play it much) and at first I was a bit invested into my character, but the more I played, the more I realized how dumbed-down the game is, catering to casual noobs, combat sucks, limited number of skills you can use on one weapon and many more issues made me completely hate the game, and uninstall it vowing to never touch it again. The game is trash for narcissist whales who just sit in hubs showing off their cosmetics.
---
" Retail community will be toxic and likely what causes the most people to quit and return to classic WoW. "
---
I fixed this for you
---
Lol N0st had 10k people concurrent and a lot more active daily and that wasnt even the peak of the vanilla pservers
---
9 days until 9 days until 1 day before classic! 
---
When Classic launches it will be 1 day before I can get any quests done.
---
Once I can get some quests done it will be 10 days played until I hit 60.
---
Once I hit 60, it will be 200 days played until my life is ruined!
---
I focused on using clips from rogues that I trusted but a lot of stuff was hard to capture without UI and the crispness I wanted (I kept not popping evo / mana gems because I wouldn't be able to see my own mana).
---
I tried to incorporate caveats for stuff like sheep- noting how they have options if you don't choose to combo you sheep up with a nade and that polymorping out of the gate RELIES on breaking the distance, which might not happen if the rogue has a tidal and closes on top of you- in which case the "how to recover" becomes what the guide is instructing you to do- if you can't break distance you're going to need to block the kidney 100%- and when you do you're going to want to try to break distance again as you wear down the rogue.
---
That being said I think going forward I'll include full duels with my commentary over them- one win and one loss at the end of the video to illustrate what I'm trying to guide in- I wanted to do that in part 2 (as well as include what gear / gadgets you SHOULD use and how to counter ideal rogue gadgetry) but it might be smart to just make part 1 a bit longer.
---
A handful of quests, not much else. Besides the dragon and the water lord... good for grinding I guess?
---
Uhh if your server dies come up with a new name... Seriously, this is a reason to ruin the game with layering? A name? Your name means a lot less on a new server anyways. It's a free name change.
---
Ha!  Im in that and I helped organize it.  Im Norsu, shown right at the front of the vid.  That junk was so fun.  One of my favorite moments in all of my wow experiences.
---
I have the same expectations and I find this a super curious case for social science. I’m so looking forward to see what the classic wow culture will be like.
---
You don’t, just need a sub. More importantly, do I need to buy beer for classic? I normally just drink water, this is a special occasion tho. I’m afraid if I’m just having fun and pounding them I’m gonna pass out really quickly on release night.
---
\*sad trombone\*
---
Alliance get escape artist and engineering boost with gnomes.  By far the best rogues.
---
 Do you like people that can type in complete sentences?
---
If so, pick RP-PVP.  The difference is night and day.
---
People actually have died playing. So a 10 min streach could really save your life.
---
&gt; No, it completely 100% solves the problem layering is "here for", without the enormous downside of ruining the community aspect of the game.
---
So it solves dead servers, transfers, mergers, 4 hour long queues? What happens if your assigned layer is full? Now you have to wait in a queue while the other layer could be struggling with it's population because it happened to have a high number of burnouts. 
---
You're all over ranting and raving about layering but it's here to stay. How about just waiting for the final iteration and giving constructive feedback instead of complaining about the inevitable.
---
a warlock.. or summon things could be cool! going to start a warlock... drop her at level 20 and then started my warrior xD i loved the warrior but wasn't able to find a raid group so i went back to my warlock leveled her and found a raiding guild really fast :(
---
I'd say slightly bigger than tiny, but as has been said,not confirmed yet.
---
Yeah but it kind of sucks
---
PVP is the true game as it was intended.

PVE is for casuals who really just want to solo-play and not ever be annoyed by other players or interact with the enemy faction outside battlegrounds. IMO even if you don't PVP ever, you still lose something going to PVE.
---
RP is for lore serious roleplay people who will get their guild together and perform ceremonies and other shit that don't mean anything but make everyone feel immersed.
---
I'm going PVP.
---
Yeah, a 60 warrior against a 20 mage maybe.
---
Isn't it kind of ridiculous how early people are churning out content? I mean wait until the game comes out; we all know you want the first clicks but there's only so much that can be covered &amp; you're trying to do it before the games even out. Milking an unborn cow.
---
Knees on the ground - assisted pushups.
---
Do sets of 10 and after you can do 20 try 3-5 regular pushups!
---
Lol i came to this thread to poach a priest and I your comment feels like a personal attack
---
No it's for a subscription. You not wanting to play half of the games you're subscribing to is what makes it cost $10 for a stress test.
---
Should it require a sub to get in? No, but you're not purchasing access to a stress test, regardless
---
Ikr imagine what a guy would look like who complains about video games rofl
---
The fear mongering about how bad "streamer" servers will be is ridiculous.  It already happened on Tich, and it was the quintessential server for a reason.  It's literally going to be some of the same people lol.
---
If you want world pvp, top dueling realm, and a lively community then play there.  Obviously it will be hard to rank up.
---
If you think the economy will be affected by them being there you're delusional.
---
It doesn't *have* to be a subscription.  You could instead buy a month of game time, which is a non-recurring transaction.
---
Yep, definitely going to explore and fish instead of questing the first day
---
I’ll also be using Huel for a large portion of meals (as I already do). Avoiding caffeine as much as possible and leveling through sheer self discipline! I’ll celebrate and eat Korean fried chicken when I hit 60.
---
Can’t even own up to the fact you were wrong, nice.
---
Don't care played wow classic:-)  But yeah, it shoulda been free.
---
No I'd say that the economy would still be ruined, considered that there are multiple layers to farm materials on, and it would eventually make the supply overtake the demand, ruining the prices.
---
The only one confused is you “endorsed by twitch” lmao
---
I'm going for tailoring on my warlock, and planning to use fishing as a big money source. For my second primary, I don't want to use enchanting, should I go for:  
---
Mining, Engineering, Herbalism, or Alchemy.
---
&gt; Egalitarianism doesn't mean everyone's paycheck is the same. Why would incomes need to be equalized? And I didn't say there shouldn't be any taxes.
---
Then I don't understand where you are going with your egalitarianism.
---
&gt; Ya, particularly easy for people with money. That's why putting an increasingly high tax rate on them, that they just pass down on their customers btw, is increasingly stupid.
---
This is not true for a variety of reasons:
---
* Companies do not know what their tax rate is before the end of a term, so factoring it into the pricing is kinda difficult
---
* Increasing prices will always reduce the number of people that will buy the product, so there is a certain price where the profit is maximized: As in, an additional increase in price would lose you an amount of customers that you will have less profit; or if you decrease your price, the increase in customers will not offset the loss
---
* There is competition, which would mean that smaller companies, with lower tax rates, would be able to commit to lower prices, thus making the big firm less competitive (if they would increase the prices based on tax)
---
&gt; All it's ever actually done is bottleneck growth to the tastes of politicians because then wealthy business owners are more likely to work with them for exemptions. It's always rules for thee but not for me bullshit.
---
Fair enough, this is about corruption/lobbying though and has nothing to do with the tax-rate itself. And whatever comes out of any deals is relevant for the whole industry and not just for one company
---
&gt; In the 1950s, the highest tax bracket was over 90%. Do you think anyone actually paid that? The answer is as clear as a cursory glance at the tax code at the time. 11,000 pages, the first of which basically laid the rules out for the filthy poors as it included all of the normal tax brackets based on income. The rest was pretty much entirely specialized exemptions that rich people paid for.
---
Well, if the tax code is shit and has loopholes then there is no surprise that nobody pays it. If there wouldn't be any loopholes (however likely that might be), then everyone would have to pay their taxes. So it's not about the tax rates, but about the laws/codes that are connected to it. Also, if the tax rate would be too high, companies would generally just want to leave that country.
---
Coming up with a good tax system is probably pretty hard, especially since there are so many factors to consider. But that does not mean that high taxes are a bad idea in general.
---
It won’t even let me select a faction from the drop down bar on my I phone
---
Nah those are all pretty minor differences.
---
* Single vs cross realm doesn't really matter, it's not like the world is cohesive anyway. They are essentially just putting many realms into one big server so they can say it's "not cross realm" but the effect on the player is identical. 
---
* Zone specific vs multi-world also doesn't really matter, since the world isn't cohesive anyway (hey look, same reason!). World sized shards *could* be ideal, if Blizzard completely disabled the ability for you to ever change layers under any condition, but that's not how it works.
---
* Aggressive vs. passive? Not really sure what you're on about here. Layering isn't very passive, and sharding isn't very aggressive. You may be confusing sharding with phasing which is quite aggressive in the modern game. You can elaborate on this if you want.
---
* The frequency of switching layers/shards probably is cut down, so I'll give you that, but I still don't consider that much improvement. It just hides layering a bit better, but the effects are still just as problematic on the server even if they aren't directly visible. This was never the problem with sharding.
---
Low level the human quest lines are probably the best (Duskwood being the tipping point), but I think the Dwarf zones end up better long term, though it's been 15 years so my memory might be shot.
---
Kalimdor is miserable after 30, Tanaris and Un'goro excepted. There's a reason everyone and their cousin is in STV for their 30s.
---
Thunder bluff is an amazing city and yes it is the best city by that metric, but it's also an outlier and has a low player population usually making it less viable :( and the surrounding horde leveling zones do not follow this green trend. 
---
On another note it would be epic to have TB  and the tauren join the alliance some day. One can never have enough relaxing capitals :P
---
The title, like you said, is “what’s *your* essential addons?”. The “your”part provides the answerer the ability to use their own opinion to realize a conclusion, which is something different than a fact. If someone has a different opinion than you, its not your place to refute such thing. You are more than welcome to create your own parent comment with your own opinion should it differ from anyone elses.

Thank you for understanding.

\- Safe choice for keeping wife happy / interested in her character. Therefore you can play more WoW.
---
We've got a bit of work to do for mobile. One of my major hopes for the guide is that it *is* very mobile friendly because, as we all know, ... "don't [we] all have phones?"
---
Pantheon does look cool but what doesnt look cool is the last gameplay videos are from 2018.....yikes idk about that
---
Good thing no one cares about what you have to say.
---
Reality is often disappointing. 
---
"Now please tell me why you didn't go heal you Spriest little..."
---
I mean, maybe, but Alliance side people rp all over the place in Stormwind, literally constantly. I've seen a lot in Boralus too.
---
I'm fine with non-RPers rolling on RP servers for the nicer community, fun events they can participate in/watch/creep on, or for any other wholesome reason...so long as they are respectful of RPers.
---
Yea community aspect isnt even close:
---
As for the raiding thing you mentioned.. 100% agree that mechanically modern raids are better. But conceptually, content is atrocious. Whether its via the repeat system (M+ or LFR&gt;N&gt;HC&gt;M) or if its through the lack of content etc.
---
The fact that blizz just added a few difficulties (3 of which are imo too easy) to raids and completely moved away from horizontal progress (think multiple raids on the same tier of content like SSC/TK in TBC) is SO lame for me personally. I get bored of a raid in retail after doing Normal and then a few HC runs. TO then continue again through M is just too repetitive and feels like a lazy concept. More content rather than higher numbers and an added mechanic here and there is better. 
---
Side-rant so sorry but yea.. Agree with you :)
---
Its not about having experience in the game to know that. Anyone with common sense can understand that concept. It's not a trick of the trade or something. Like if you were in a construction crew and someone had to stop to get a drink so all of construction is at a stand still waiting for one man to drink, sounds pretty dumb to me.
---
I don't know how you label me as toxic. If I was in a group with someone who didnt understand that I'd say, "dude drink, just join the fight when you have mana" and keep pulling not all that toxic or terrible of a thing.
---
Thank you for the feedback. We'll look into more robust mobile support and get these issues resolved.
---
What. My ”fellow” horde used to run the fuck away in stv when I was dying to alliance. Theres not any kind of characteristics in the behaviour of either faction players. Its all in your personal experience and bias
---
Didn't the 4 strength 4 stam leather belt, level 18, ahhggg uugghhh drop in Westfall?
---
Very thoughtful of you! yet another reason I love (most of) the WoW Classic community.
---
*11:00 AM PDT*
---
So that would be 20:00 on EU servers (or 7:00 PM in UK summertime)
---
They probably intentionally left it that way so Blizz could pull the plug whenever they want.  My guess is they will do a 24 hour test.
---
Most people aren’t off work until 5-7 pm so I assume they will have a big influx of people logging in as soon as the server is up, and then again when people are off work.
---
Me too. Except the hunter that rolled need on my emberstone staff!
---
What? The number of specific decisions any unit in Starcraft can make is tiny compared to a WoW player. It's checkers versus chess. And I would know since I'm still waiting on Bossland's bankruptcy to go through.
---
I think your better off putting your effort into something else.
---
*triggered*
---
&gt;but could Stoneform be equally as useful?
---
Play whichever faction you'd prefer to play on.  Don't base it on racials.
---
Just get engineering and mining from the get go and level them up as you're going. The thing about classic is that the rush isn't to 60. getting to 60 is probably just less than half of your total character development. You've got primary professions, your secondary professions, gearing, attunments. The list can go on. Some people suggest getting two gathering professions from the get go, one being skinning, becase you can just vendor the leathers and squeeze more money out of beasts you're killing.
---
 Also it'll only take like a days play time to max out both mining and engineering once you hit 60 and have your mount. But having engineering on par while you're leveling is such a good stop gap for most classes. Between that and alch, I think both of them are worth it to level as you go.
---
Also, they both immediately provide benefit. Where as leather working, tailoring, or even BS are more about the long game
---
Be a creepy dude who stands in dark corners and sells suspicious potions to unwary travelers.
---
I've never tried it and Google didn't yield any results either, so who knows lol
---
Building friendships, finishing the set, or BIS list, finally getting that super rare sword that wouldn’t drop.
---
You’ll still see some of the less established players/guilds taking them up on the offer. Or if most/all of an established guild who wants to try to move to somewhere they can actually compete for server first in decides to move...  
---
There ain’t any amazing solutions, just one(s) that is/are least bad.
---
You realize that layering and sharding is similar right? You're being really dumb rn. Layering is for the entire world and sharding is for a certain zone. Layering is basically exactly like sharding because once the game launches you don't need 5k people in each zone because people will all be low level.
---
I say, sir, *you* have an upvote.
---
You're correct.  
---
The reason I say stack INT for OP's purpose, spell power won't have much of an impact.  If you're Blizzard is dealing 39 damage instead of 34 because of the spell power gear you found - that sounds great.  But, if you had more INT instead of spellpower you'd be able to cast an extra Blizzard before going OOM which is way better for grinding.  Obviously that goes for more frost bolts or arcane explosions etc as well.
---
You can stock up on those Halloween wands
---
Heck, on youtube there was a Chinese guild in '06 that ran a mega stacked Rogue to tank Ony.
---
Yeah I dunno guess depends on the dynamics of your server... I was on Mannoroth/Destromath (after free transfer) originally Alliance.... I would often be in pvp situations and its just felt like more horde showed up....
---
So then around late 2005 I switched to Horde on Firetree... Still often found myself in PvP situations and well in my case the Horde still rallied when it came to world PvP...
---
SO based on my personal experience this rains true for me.
---
This "confirms" nothing of the sort.. Lol, you dudes are delusional.
---
Best event ever, such a shame we won't get it.
---
Please do, more Zombies for me
---
Damn your post is Shakespearean. Told by an idiot, full of Sound and fury, and signifying nothing.
---
Fuck off. How's that for community?
---
a subscription to wow
---
I re-rolled on Jubei'Thos at oceanic server launch I think, that's where I did all my raiding as an alliance rogue. So that's another one...
---
Hi, /u/John_dorian_classic
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cnc1qj/mojito_social_guildhardcore_is_recruiting_for/).
---
And from another longtime private server player. Enormous amount of players live for the hustle and bustle and Insanity of launch.
---
This is the biggest issue IMO. If population stays insanely high on a couple of realms, those realms will have overflowering AHs and low prices, which is great to buy, but less good if you want to farm to sell; the time to farm stays the same while the price plummets? No thanks.
---
But then people tend to favor raw gold farming instead, so...maybe it'll work itself out.
---
No other capital city is as cozy as Ironforge, I love that place.
---
30 hours grind?  Lazy, 72 hours straight or you are not grinding hard enough.
---
&gt;You can (and should) login into your account early. Like 15 mins before the server's launch time.
---
Try hours before the launch time. The most probable bottleneck is the authentication/login servers.
---
I can't really recommend that.
---
A server launch only happens ONCE. It's like unique event.
---
It's a struggle but it's also fun. Just play and experience the game with everyone else.
---
You will get to play the optimal way later.
---
Isn’t there layering for the first couple of weeks in the starter zones to help prevent this?
---
In classic will paladin be restricted to ally only again? And vice versa for Shaman? I didnt want to make a new thread to ask.
---
Thanks :) I feel better because of these replies honestly, appreciated.
---
1500-3k on 5m respawn timers is good. I like 10,000 players too, because low level dungeons are a bitch to setup during slow times on low pop. But without dynamic respawns I think everything would be awful with 10,000 people.
---
I like clash of clans lol, but yea seeing my favorite big name company pivot towards mobile sickens me almost as much when Blizz announced real money auction house was coming to Diablo 3.  Ugh
---
How about do it for 50seconds and then rest for 2 minutes cause your exhausted already?
---
Ur officially that guy
---
We have player from all over the world. From South Africa to Iceland, at the moment!
---
Cheers! :&gt;)
---
stoneform is almost as valuable as hardiness in pvp, since i think it helps you deal with a larger variety of things. Also, it's a big boost to pve in AQ, since you can just full soak a boss debuf
---
Aye it definitely depends of the server. I always felt like getting jumped by the horde when playing alliance, and vice versa on horde.
---
Holy Light, Divine Shield, Devotion Aura and Redemption should do it
---
Thanks for the info, I remember reading the +hit is needed for warlocks when it becomes available so that makes sense.
---
Correct. We kill you to save your time.
---
Curse also has a filter for 1.3/1.3.2 where there's dozens of working addons
---
Ehh, I've done server launches. I doubt the hustle and bustle will even be over after 2 days
---
Can I go now
---
If you're going full-healer, it's pretty obvious which talents to take in both trees.  IMHO at least 14 points should go in disc, and 18 in holy.
---
Basically, put 31 in disc or 30/31 in holy, the 14 or 18 into the other spec as I previously mentioned, and then put your leftover talents more or less wherever you prefer.
---
[Skarm has a good video that goes over all the racials from a warrior min-max perspective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2HVPa8VhRw)
---
Resources are preserved, the economy as a whole is not. 15k people using the same AH will drive prices into the ground quickly I would imagine. Of course, if half those people quit, things will end up being pretty smooth down the road.
---
Mobile support would make this amazing for me.
---
Cairne has pointy ears too! Large fluffy goblin! ***THEY'RE EVERYWHERE***
---
Don't need a rez if you don't let anyone die :bigbraintime:
---
Yes paladin is ally shaman is horde only.
---
Raid!
---
It sounds simple, but my computer back then made 40 mans impossible. The most I got into was a ZG and that was really pushing my machine.
---
I would mostly hang out at my buddies place and watch him do BWL and AQ40 while I played Halo 2 on the Xbox.
---
Side note, I don't recommend doing free character transfer ... I went from a full server (queues) to a low-med pop server... was great short term, bad long term...
---
And on a pvp server, less potential gankers in my experience
---
Sbemu still going strong for the people who can ! Still having 150 person banes weekly.
---
On the other hand you could be the dude who killed Ragnaros and Nefarian and Kel'Thuzad with Sulfuras on your back and Thunderfury on your hip and people would still be like "hey rando gather poop for me".
---
No shit dumb ass
---
I wouldnt worry. It doesnt add up imo.. lets say theres only 8 realms in NA. Then  after phasing goes away, the cap is 10k (VERY Optimistic number btw, def gonna be lower imo).. ya'll really think NA will only have around 80k active players at once in peaks? 
---
Or that there will be even less than that for the PvP servers (since 2 of the realms are prob PvE &amp; RP in this scenario) ?
---
Idk these playerbase &amp; server numbers sound low to me and the cap a bit high.
---
I expect server caps to be atleast 5k but not as high as 10k.
---
&gt; Take what you want from it and apply it to Classic.
---
I can't tell how different it will be with layering because we never got to experience it.
---
The Beta launch was nothing. Only a couple of players in it.
---
More like scheduled for the best time for them?
---
With all 3 pieces, that's really low
---
Nah that's Arthas
---
Oh it’s doable and I’ve done it before, it’s just a 45 min trip when you factor in the journey from menethil and the horde ganking all over hillsbrad.
---
Huh, we had very little trouble with Vari Mythic. I guess that my Discipline Priesting helped a lot, though.
---
Classic WoW catered to casuals. Go play EQ if you wanted something truly esoteric.
---
Retail WoW is the combination of many factors, and not all of them are, as you say "catering to casuals".
---
It's not hard to level to 60, just requires time and dedication.
---
If this were a perfect recreation of classic with all the patches, than MC would be a lot more challenging.   The fact is that 1.12 characters and the gear are far more powerful than they were back in 1.1.  
---
Combine that with the knowledge we have about the classes, gearing, and the bosses and MC in classic should be more or less an absolute faceroll.  
---
Again, this is dependent on guild, but you should be able to switch to that pvp build fairly quickly.  Certainly by phase 2 there should be no reason you can't use that build.  Dire Maul has a ton of very powerful gear in it.
---
Respec cost shouldn't be that bad really.  You will probably level up as enhancement, then switch to Resto at 60. That's only 1g.  Then by phase 2 you go Elem, which will be 5g.  Then phase 3 you might want to go back to resto, so 10g.    Then you switch back to elem at some point in BWL, which is 15g. 
---
Phase 1 and 2 will only be like 2 months long.  So, it's really not that expensive, unless you are constantly changing from resto to elem for pvp or something.
---
Thanks for repeating what I said in a slightly less exagerated way.
---
I just get confused when he says “edgemasters basically negates the reason to roll human” because theoretically wouldn’t it be better to have gloves that would give hit, crit or str? Instead of having to waste an item slot for the weapon skill?
---
The idea that the modern gamer changed in any way is kinda silly.
---
How many managers do you have?
---
I completely get that logic and I use it for every game that I play. If there is another Star Wars MMO I'm totally going Wookiee. Hutt, if possible.
---
Unfortunately, in vanilla my playing group made me go Alliance and now I have some sort of attachment to it. And on top of that, I'm all too familiar with the game to know that the horde cities suck compared to Alliance. I want to try RP this time and alliance cities seem much more conducive for that
---
Join a non-PVP server. Streamers will all go PvP because it makes for better viewership. RP players would prefer a healthier population of people willing to adapt to the intent of the server, and not just folks seeking sanctuary.
---
China drives majority of wow subscriptions for activision blizzard.  IDK how they like classic vs modern, but there are vastly more active chinese accounts than all other regions combined.
---
Yeah, this guy doesn't have friends and is the type of player who declines a group invite no matter what.
---
Osrs isn't based on the original version of the game, in fact osrs is based on what people consider runescape 2.
---
yeah then don't bother with spirit tap if you're always with others.
---
Yep, exactly! There is no Resurrection Sickness penalty for players level 10 and under so we take full advantage of the potential to reduce travel time.
---
That screenshot has less people than the second day of the last stress test in silverpine.
---
BUUUUUUUURRRRRN-   ...oh..
---
This thread can be summarized as so: 
---
1. For a first toon, skinning can be worthwhile to smooth the leveling process (skills, bags, etc)
---
2. The majority of the money is coming post-40 when you’re receiving medium and thick leather (so don’t count on it being enough to completely prevent needing to grind some for the first mount)
---
3. For alt accounts being supported, it is more efficient to front the bill and grind it back at 60.
---
I think a lot of folks take skinning while leveling just for more vendor trash to sell, then later on when they swap it for alch they can just retrieve everything sent to their bank alt
---
Mr. Height also said they'll have additional servers ready to launch if the 8 that are initially available reach their maximum capacity.
---
That's an awfully strange way to spell Thunder Bluff
---
Elegantly put
---
When choosing Duo Leveling (Tauren warrior and Troll Hunter), it only shows the guide for the first race/class combo.  Is the guide assuming that the 2nd person is going to run to the starting zone for the 1st person?  Does that even work? I don't know if a Troll can get the starter quests in the Tauren zone.
---
Might be better to have a side by side until they can meet up in a zone in common.
---
(Citation missing) Blizzard has stated that the classic servers will not be named the same as their retail counterparts.
---
I personally hope they have reconsidered since then. It would be amazing to play on the resurrected versions of old servers, and if Emerald Dream exists and is RP-PVP I will be playing there.
---
So the vast majority of MMORPGs aren't MMORPGS, only the ones that came out in 2004 or before are the real ones. Would it be too much for you to accept that there are multiple styles of MMORPGs and different people like different ones for different reasons and you happen to like the one where you play dress up and press some buttons for a 5% chance at a new pair of shoes?
---
If you don't like that idea, don't worry, you can still point out the person to whom you replied is wrong because many of those bosses in the original version did have mechanics that needed to be done.
---
No brewfest, but there is the thanksgiving feast event should be there.  That's a great one for leveling up cooking for cheap, if it has the same things as the event in WotLK.
---
That's how I usually do it
---
Does this only hide the helm and cloak on your PC? Or does it display as hidden to other players too?
---
&gt;Do you think I can still off tank raids even though I cannot fully commit to a hardcore raiding schedule?
---
There's no such thing anymore.   Even the "hardcore" guilds raid 2 nights a week.
---
I never said i wanted it to be named the same as ED. Just have similiar culture of rp-pvp
---
I’m on my iphone and the site won’t allow me to select a drop down option.
---
Couldn't have made a more uninformed comment.
---
I don’t remember getting ganked but there was a patrol of undead in Arathi that definitely got me.
---
Long term goals are clear BWL and hit R10. Reasonable enough, yet still ambitious with possible RL time constraints. 
---
Short term are Darnassus exalted and professions maxed.
---
those folders get created when you first start the client and log into a char (since the file structure uses account/server/name for some stuff)
---
you can just create those folders like in retail or vanilla client
---
If you’re literally only going to level as a bear in dungeons, then yes, Feline Swiftness will be of limited use. 
---
If at any point he starts doing any questing at all, Feline Swiftness will be worth it. It’s just *so* good.
---
Druids are fine, it's just that most of the things they can do, there's a class/spec doing it better.
---
Want to tank? You can do that. But you'll will usually get beaten by a similar geared/skilled Warrior. With the exception of a few things.
---
Want to heal? You can do that. You can't stack Hots with other druids and your raw healing output is considered the worst. In Naxxramas, people might like your Tier 3 set effect for extra DPS.
---
Want to DPS? You can do that. But Moonkin is considered terrible, due to not only mana problems, but also terrible scaling due to resistances now being lowered, just like Elemental. Feral is actually decent to good if you put in the time to farm the gear and put in the time to learn to powershift. If you can do that, you can rival Rogues/Warriors on Patchwerk fights.
---
Innervate? With 1.12 talents the need for Innervate is much lower due to much faster clear times.
---
Rebirth? It's nice to CR someone, but if a MT/OT dies and the boss starts running around killing people, the fight is usually over anyways. I usually ended up using it on cooldown on stupid deaths by our DPS. It's usually not the "saving the group/raid spell" everybody keeps talking about.
---
yes it will be achieved
---
To generate much needed bag space. Bags are extremely rare in Classic so that 1/16th of your bag is valuable real-estate. To obtain a new Hearthstone simply speak to an Innkeeper.
---
Actually side question? What are y’all doing with the skins? Vendoring them? I can’t imagine there’s really a launch demand for them on the auction house.
---
Aww
---
So, based on your “yes” answer to a non-yes-or-no question, this means Classic AND BFA?
---
I understand the joke, but I genuinely want to know the answer.
---
We're hoping to have this mobile and tablet friendly very quickly for those of us without secondary monitors.
---
Fuck outta here with that gibberish
---
Only 200 days played? Noob
---
Actually, if you DO any of the  boss fights when you are 4 to 6 levels lower, they are ALL a blast, especially if you are in greens.
---
Those fights become epic in nature.  Doing RFK as soon as you are eligible for the quest (me, priest - level 18) -- with the end boss being in the high 20's or 30's is fun.
---
BRD at levels 54 - 58 is good except for the suppression room and Emperor.  That's some trash, and it's hard.
---
Just do the instances lower, it's more fun as you concentrate on defense, mana, skills, and even if you 'miss' more than you hit, you sweat it out to the end.
---
or just dont use 123456 as password
---
You? Confused? Never....
---
How it goes in pvp? 
---
Shaman ele vs rogue
---
Rogue vs shadow priest
---
You can create the folders yourself or just launch the game once and have it automatically create them.
---
i'll allow it, roll your CON check
---
I’m just glad Varian will be gone
---
Hey, a WoW classic frost mage called, he wants that second ability you're talking about. Says it would be really nice to have one.
---
Seriously though, there aren't any "two button" specs in BFA, but there are in Classic. If you'd like to make fun of BFA try one of its actual flaws.
---
I feel it's more cringe to not role play on a Massive Multiplayer Online ROLE PLAYING game
---
people will remember names and good players get myth staus and ending in a raid. people who dosent know about classic will learn it.
---
Loved watching you and Kargoz duo levelsz You are a damn legend.
---
Layering will still allow up to 3000 people per layer. That's a LOT of new players in one zone.
---
That I get gear for pvping.
---
Website doesn’t work on mobile. I tried selecting faction/class but nothing happens.
---
4weird
---
Sure, but even if you're not power leveling, the higher level you are, the more money you can make. Across the board. So spending time grinding low level stuff is never beneficial if we're just talking income--gold per hour.
---
That's what I've been wondering too. Would be great to get some clarification on this.
---
Yes, vendor them.
---
Only 8 servers for China? I almost feel like that's a low expectation depending on server cap
---
damnit......
---
they are kind of sleeping on it.  8 servers for all of china? that place has way more subscribers than NA or EU and combined even.  Maybe they only like modern tho.
---
Have you logged out of the forums and logged back in? I had to do that yesterday after logging in to my TBC character.
---
Don't play a meme spec and don't forget to not tell anyone how to play.
---
Sounds like you are going to dungeon grind, have fun!
---
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Thank you so much!
---
Classic will be even bigger than any server launch you know
---
Thank you for the response :D
---
Does anyone know any addon that hides your XP bar?
---
Good thing nobody has made a game like that then. Sounds terrible.
---
Saved
---
Can I only play the test If I have a sub or also when I only have palytime?
---
12 minutes? Sorry, I have that bookmarked for staring at the auction hall hitting refresh on the 1 mat I need
---
First aid and potions are your new friends.
---
Thunder Bluff is amazing, but not cozy. It's mostly outdoors and has bright sky overhead. Doesn't remind me of my childhood bedroom at all.
---
Both
---
&gt; Id rather have server merges than over population.
---
Not me. Im glad they arent going to let realms be empty then randomly merge them into clusters of random economies and communities stitched together like frankenstein realms.
---
Terrible idea. I much prefer a full mmorpg.
---
Shift V Click on nameplate GG EZ Clap
---
Not gonna use adderall tho. lol
---
&gt; Only FF14 brought back the genre to it's glory when they remake it from the ground up.
---
And even then, I wouldn't call FF14 perfect. It does a lot of the things WoW does wrong, people just dont talk about it. Things like level boosts/ real money shop items etc.
---
I guarantee you that it is exponentially more difficult on a pserver than it will be on Classic
---
to be one of the Best player of your class on server is a good goal. people see you and whisper begins because you a hero.
---
You're really dumb. Having 50k people in the starting area isn't what made anything fun. Nothing I say can convince you how stupid your logic is
---
They said it would last 48 hours lol just like the last one
---
I was extremely put off by the segment they did on druids. I was a bit dissapointed in Teledril to be honest.
---
&gt;At least 15 deaths later I’m level 13. 
---
Welcome to the Thunderdome bitch.
---
There is a decent on in AQ40.  Don't think it is quite as good as the BWL xbow, but it's not far off.   Raiding in vanilla is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you are gonna get.   Some items just don't drop, so you can't just expect to have X.  You will likely never get your BIS list.
---
But the stress tests showed exactly what they're doing... the first was a shit show and the second was too many open servers.
---
Launch will be fine - the only reason layering exists is to make launch playable.
---
500 people per zone in a layer is not playable...
---
Wc3 editor has been massively upgraded over the last 6 months and most* maps will be portable to WC3 reforged this coming December.
---
On top of this, the WC3 custom game community is far from dead.
---
Lua has been added as an alternative (or supplement) to the existing languages supported by the editor.
---
In short, keep making your maps. Come Reforged, we’ll have more people to play them.
---
That's the password for my luggage.
---
Not gonna happen...
---
That's unplayable which defeats the point of layering.
---
There wont be 500 people in each starting zone.
---
You guys are hyping shaman quiet a bit, how bad would be getting loot as a rip shaman in raid?
---
Thanks so much for the replies
---
Being logged in 15 minutes or 15 hours early makes no difference, you still cant do squat til the server goes live.
---
One of the few reasons I still think Dwarfs have one of the best starting areas. It all just looks cinematic to me.
---
Hamstring kite, use rend and demo shout. Buy health potions keep up first aid. I know people say don't buy any gear, but look for good cheap gear especially a 2 hander.
---
Pls do lol
---
PVP is where it doesn't matter at all. PVEwise Min/Max or gtfo.
---
MT of my guild here, I also usually have a hunter or mage alt, my hunter had a higher /played than my warrior.
---
Hinterlands yes and the quests and rewards for horde is funny and cool.
---
With a blue post
---
Min maxers are comparing themselves to other min maxers. They have a right to pick the most optimal set up for themselves and their guild.
---
I do like the sentiment that RPGers should play what they regardless of optimization.
---
But for fuxs sake, stop bringing down people for wanting to squeeze in their optimization. A lot of people have been playing pservers for 3, 5, or 10 years. The RPG aspect isnt their focus. They want to own shit.
---
What do streamers do to negatively impact servers? I think I stopped playing before they became so popular, so pardon my ignorance
---
Yea screw it. Its more worth playing what you want to play rather than trying to play something just to have a good group comp. Well done!
---
No wow server start event could be as bad as the day the dark portal to burning crusade opened. 
---
Its one thing to have 8 Races on 2 factions with 3 starting areas, but funneling the entire server population through one portal and 1 zone was plain stupidity.
---
You are referring to the point in the guide where Shaman are completing Call of Fire (part 3). It is significantly faster to die back from the cave after obtaining the Reagent Pouch than it is to run back, so we have you die. 
---

Unrealistic: Kill KT
---
Realistic: Become a respected member of my server / guild.
---
I mean, you only need 1 server for the cash shop to function, really.
---
what are these macros, explicitly, so I know to stay away from them?
---
I've never made the mistake 3 times.  Thanks for the warning friend!
---
How do people not see just how impressive this is. Congratulations on your amazing work !
---
NO YOU!!!11!
---
Just like you didn't live up to your parents.
---
Not as many druids as other healers so it balances out - and who doesn't like brez and innervate for a raid
---
Get spirit gear for minimal down time and only look for weapon upgrades.
---
All to avoid the extremely minute influence a streamer has on their lives.
---
Impossible. He already hearthed.
---
I'm not subscribed and none of my friends are. Mainly because I've played wow retail extensively and even played some private servers before, so getting to play a stress test to level 5/10/15 or whatever is no big deal for me and I'd even rather save the hype for release. Moreover, my name is almost certainly not going to be taken so the reservation doesn't entice me to subscribe, so I reckon a lot of people feel the same and sub a day before release.
---
Not really, because you're also shitting on people lower level then you.  
---
There is a vast difference then being a new 60 fighting old geared 60s, and using your level 60 main to twink your level 39's gear w/ enchants and all the best BoE stuff you can get off the AH.  You can call it what you will but like another guy said it's just trying to be a big fish in small pond because you can't man up and compete at 60.
---
&gt;Classic WoW catered to casuals.
---
That isn't wrong, but it isn't right either. Retail caters to people who need instant gratification, classic WoW can be enjoyed casually but it requires investment, even casual investment, which seems like a relatively hardcore concept in this day and age.
---
Mines to see the end of Naxx in retail as a Resto Druid.  I only made it to AQ40 as I was late to the party.
---
That's a good question mate. Here are some general facts you should know. Much more Is out there and many people have done "what we know about classic" YouTube videos.
---
Release Aug 26 NA, 27 EU. Final stress test is tomorrow if you want to play it you can download it right now from the launcher and play a few hours. Beta is no longer running. 
---
There are 6 phases of content release. 
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/120346
---
No lfg, no cross realm except bgs. No transmog, no wow token, no mtx. There will be sharding for the first phase, which is expected to last til 60 for most people. This is purely to prevent servers from crashing, but people have found out you can exploit it to dodge PvP or gather nodes and stuff on various shards. They call it layering and have confirmed it will be gone by phase 2 when the risk of crashes no longer happen. 
---
The game is using the modern engine with all things modern stripped out. This means sometimes subtle things will be different, like at first rogue energy worked in the modern way instead of in chunks like the old way. Things like this are fixed when noticed, but inevitable. It can't and likely won't be 100% a perfect recreation, but they've dumbed down the engine in many ways to make it as close as they can, and truthfully they seem like they're devoted to making it as close as they can.
---
If Dark Souls taught me anything, it's that giant monsters can be deadly, but when you get invaded by a regular sized dude who's naked save for a loincloth and wielding a katana...you're about to die.
---
Just a line "LIGHT GIVE ME 6 FEET" and having him scale up to ground it would have been better.
---
If you decide that you would like to premade competitivly (especially WSG/AB, AV will be a faceroll shitfest either way) it matters as much as if you would min/max PvE.
---
The real test is getting past the 30s
---
No just sub
---
Yeah 30-50 is the shit box of existence lol.
---
alexensual
---
With role queue coming?  I don't think so, bub.
---
I see... none of us are worthy of your time and you are here to tell us that Classic will be toxic by being toxic. Great thanks, now fuck off please.
---
Minecraft costs more than every f2p game.
---
\&gt; even by established studios with large budgets - they're clearly hard to make
---
They are hard to make for business people who don't understand why people play MMO's and want to cater to people with impulse control problems for profit.
---
Imagine a guy sitting on a very specific subreddit, complaining about the game that the sub is designed around. What he must look like...
---
We can only hope.
---
I like how everyone knows AV is going to be Alliance owned 😂 #experience
---
Salzman, from accounting
---
are you aware that there are other regions that play wow?
---
I forgot about this, because no hunter I knew was willing to save dkp for it over xbow, and melee were happy to take it.
---
She doesn't look Druish
---
A gathering profession as you need the extra income.
---
I’m hoping they use blizzlike (3k) layers do that this isn’t so much of a problem.
---
What makes you want to go horde? I played Alliance all of vanilla and I feel like I want to go horde, but I feel a stronger pull to go Alliance again
---
I’m genuinely willing to take a bet on that.
---
PM me some discord info and if MC gets downed week 1 I’ll buy you a pizza.
---
In before Thex.
---
Blizzard has openly admitted (Jeff kaplan specifically) that they rarely come up with their own ideas, and that they usually just mash good ideas together and endlessly polish
---
~20 days played if you've never done it.
---
Priest because you have more friends on horde and it sounds like they will be more fun for you
---
Lmao, you don't have a poop bucket?
---
It will be surely big but the servers won't have 20k caps and also don't forget layering.
---
That was my favorite boss in that raid
---
Kargoz has quickly become one of my favorite content creators and this site has been bookmarked since the Skarm podcast.
---
There definitely will, at least in Europe for younger people. August 26th is holiday but most uni's/schools start in September/October. I know I will be playing most of the day for the first week of launch, after that, not so much.
---
How are weak auras essential to your vanilla experience? Mind sharing your ui?
---
That video is just people funneling items/nodes to someone else. It's funny how you say you'd rather have 50k people in your starting zone than have certain people funneling items to a certain player for a month. Who cares if like 50 streamers get items funneled to them. 99.9999% of players would rather have a good starting experience and "deal with (who even cares) some streamers being slightly richer.
---
&gt; It's as if people have forgotten that this is a role-playing game, and now their whole enjoyment of the game depends on living up to what a spreadsheet says
---
It's as if people have forgotten that this is also a multiplayer game that requires a lot of teamwork.
---
I don't know about you, but I prefer when people on my team can pull their own weight...
---
Yes and no? There will be tons of players, but also tons of servers and layering
---
ohh wow that thing is ugly.  If it wasn't nicknamed the bug dick, then I hereby take credit for it.
---
Literally the only reason I even consider rolling a hunter.
---
That shit is some of the best class flavor out there. Nobody else can do it IDC it it's useful like twice per battleground.
---
This hits the nail on the head.  Watching these guys scramble to try to explain why being a BoE enchant twinked 39 ganking 32s in battlegrounds isn't cheese dicking has been really entertaining.  Just admit you're too fragile to compete at the top and move on.
---
just fyi, troll is very weak warrior early due to not having 2hander learnt, and pservers 1-10 is a lot harder than classic.
---
No stop, don’t say it, looking for some real answers.
---
Yeah I trust random people on Reddit alot more than a billion dollar powerhouse in the gaming industry
---
I'm rolling Alliance Mage and it's either Human or Gnome. I *have* never and *will* never play Gnome anything.
---
Troll rogue easy healsyou
---
Bro the line for rumbleshot ammo starts back there. Get to the back or you're "blacklisted".
---
All solid advice. As a pserver vet I'm kind of just laughing at people watching through joanas videos where he levels on a dead server with 0 interaction with other players. They need to see posts like this.
---
"Stuncontroll" is my vote
---
Some guilds will pay for tank repairs
---
I mean sure, at a casual level, but if you want to take it seriously then it wouldn't be good enough
---
Does this work if I play in bed laid on my back or like half-half?
---
No bagnon?
---
I picked the name Fisher_P. Thought it sounded alright so I just went with it.
---
Well, Onyxia is not the hardest boss out there...
---
Doesn’t work on mobile
---
No they are

---
layering is continent wide
---
dude just play ret trust me, in PvE they suck but in PvP they are pretty good. Just play what is the most fun to YOU. I play ret my entire life and will play in vanilla too without even thinking. The worst thing you can is to pick something that you don't want to play just because it's in high demand. You will only be frustrated in the end because you are not having fun. I don't care about PvE and will pick up engineering just to get upper hand in PvP. Good luck.
---
We can't think like this dude, we gotta be positive.
---
Positive vibes only, then a few weeks after launch, we start an onslought of meme-related content and just take them to town.
---
Which is alot of hunters lol
---
yes ok
---
I'm going to wait and see if there's an RP PVP realm before I decide a faction. Alliance seems like it would have better RP
---
Did the same about 1.5 years starting mid BC of altism. 
---
Finally had the levers fall into place with warrior and that was my only main for 6+ years
---
&gt; it’s going to be used for cosmetic purposes
---
first thing I'd do is never, ever, ever tell anyone this
---
The issue shouldn't be about performing optimally in a DPS/healing meter. The issue should be if your character is built the way the facilitates the way that you want to play. If the way that someone wants to play is under-represented mechanically, that will effect their enjoyment and make their time playing the game less worthwhile.
---
People aren't going to "just have fun". This doesn't mean that they need to spec exactly as the most cutting-edge guide (from 2006) says in order to be OK with the game. However, most people are going to want their character to work well and to convey their class fantasy desires in a way that is significant and useful.
---
There is a healthy balance.
---
Engineering is a resource sink, I haven't really heard of people making money off it. You take it because some items from engineering can only be used by engineers.
---
Mining = money by AHing what you mine. Alternatively you can use it in your engineering for personal use.
---
That's rather silly.   You shouldn't want 8 shaman.   Shaman do almost nothing for some classes, like mages.
---
My DnD sense told me rogue, but there was no spellslots.. soo brain said caster.
---
Dead guy with a demon looked cool in the trailer.
---
Years later...
---
I did just because I was indecisive on class and wanted to make sure I was making the right choice.
---
Id say if I was primarily leveling solo, shadow is the way to go. You can still heal dungeons while leveling (would not recommend healing BRD or higher as shadow though) while having a more efficient spec for questing. But if you aren't leveling alone much at all then disc/holy is definitely good as you wont even have to change spec once you hit 60.
---
My god.
---
I think there's something to be said for having limited playtime and trying to ensure that when you do play, you already have people to run with. That said, these kinds of groups tend to form naturally by being friendly and making friends via PuGs and zone channels and things like that. See also: guild groups.
---
I'm not too worried about finding people to dungeon with right from the start of the expansion: they may fly by me in level (or the other way around), which would make the whole thing pointless. I'll just enjoy the ride to 60 and hopefully make some friends on the way there, so that when I hit 60 I'm getting those whispers to come with people to a dungeon. :)
---
lol thanks for posting this anyway, i'd love to see more content like this on this sub
---
welcome *back* ! ^^
---
Made me laugh, I'll give you that.
---
Yeah, you can have a middle ground, but now you're being worse at both. If you want to enjoy PvP and PvE to it's fullest extent without gimping yourself, you're going to want a spec dedicated for each. And if you're someone like me who enjoys doing both, you're going to be respecting a lot.
---
Name another class that shaman totems don't help that much. 
---
Even tranquil air is amazing for warlocks.
---
In the beta launch there were like 15 people in the starting zones...
---
In the weekend tests people were capped to level 5/10. There was no real reason to even bother leveling. And there was a Ragnaros and stuff in the starting zone... So yeah they were testing other things. Not the launch.
---
This will be the real launch test in which they decide layering numbers and such.
---
Are you serious?  Do you know how much behind I will get having to hit replay every 10 hours?
---
Ok but what if your max is like fucking 10 pushups in a minute. You're straight in there with the big boy numbers...
---
But yeah alright dude I'm fully prepped to go down this route I'm slowly improving my life in other areas anyway and fitness is one of those everyone alwaysss talks about undertaking so I'll do that.
---
I'm going to have to go for sets that are WAY below your healthy routine discussed. 120 pushups will have me shit my intestines, I genuinely can't do  that, I'm not a big man I'm just a bone on bone man with zilch muscle.
---
I've a lot of areas of improvement, muscle and general fitness is a good few of these.
---
Considering you only raid with people from your faction, I don't see how it's important. If you're minmaxing to that degree for world firsts, you'd need to find that ultrahardcore guild anyway and they'd be deciding the faction. Outside that? Nah.
---
If you're interested in playing solo-ish until you find a guild (or going pugs), I think shamans are the easiest to level out of the three you mentioned. If that helps tip the scale any.
---
Ooh I see, I only played mage in vanilla so I didnt know this, interesting!
---
I had no idea Night Elves could be Mages in the current version of WoW. That's odd.
---
The real question is; do you want to press shadowbolt or frostbolt? Fireball is not untill AQ/Nax?
---
You can start a toon at cap lvl on some private servers. U know that right? Much better gauge for that
---
Yeah I had figured that lol, I’m just going to tell them that I want to respec into ret paladin and want to pvp with it. I’ve did some research and saw that warriors shouldn’t want it since fury should dual wield, so I only have to worry about other paladins and hunters ;)
---
Is there an addon (download) manager that will work with Classic?
---
Troll has mage
---
I knew what i was going to play and my professions about 2 years ago. 
---
Whatever you pick, you will have fun!
---
It could cost seconds!!!!
---
I... CAN’T.....WAIT!!
---
Oceanic will probably only have 1 or 2 servers. Won't have much choice. Bonus is that there should be no streamers :D
---
Every time he says hamstring, my warrior reflexes kick in..
---
&gt; Also I just gotta take the subway to stormwind and theres a boat that goes there correct?
---
Yes, you'll just have to wait few years for the dock to open
---
Aye, I mained a warrior in vanilla so changed to a PVE realm after a week getting ganked sideways in STV.. But considering rolling hunter this time which may be a bit more craic in wPvP, plus I gather PvP realms are better for player-generated content. Considering an RP-PvP either.. I am, clearly, no closer to a decision now than when I posted 🤣
---
&gt;Pantheon Rise of the Fallen
---
There's videos from April on their youtube page.
---
Crud I didnt think of that. That's not gonna be a fun time.
---
My favorite race+class combination is without doubt undead warrior. I've always played that combo and would love to again. But the thing is, PvP is my main content. It's the sole reason I play WoW and I just think at some point i'm gonna regret not picking orc. At some point i'm gonna sit in a rogues stun lock or something like that, and think to myself "if only I had picked orc".  
---
It's a pretty awkward situation because I really enjoy playing undead but I also don't want to gimp myself since I know I struggle vs. good rogues so I think it would be foolish of me not to pick orc to counter them.
---
But if we merge 2 layers that have 500 people under level 30 we'd have 1000 people right? Which is twice as many.
---
Unless you thought that they wouldn't have merged some layers by the time 50% of people hit lvl 60, which would be absurd.
---
Pallies are weapon dependent, require drinks between EVERY SINGLE  pull, and have no real instant heals, and have extremely slow dps.  That coupled with the fact the their loot tables are the weakest in the game makes them arguably the worst to level. (Other than warriors.)  These two classes have a long history of burning people out in Vanilla because of their tedious slog to 60.
---

Lots of people have hammered modern WoW's class design but it comes down to this. At launch, most classes had a Depletive Resource - Mana. Now most classes have a Generative Resource.
---
I agree 100% and will be rolling pvp. I just wanted to offer an alternative for those with an absolute phobia of joining a streamer's server (though there is a website to track current big streamers' intentions that would be better to utilize).
---
My guy was the one who got me into WoW and now I'm the one who keeps bringing him back. When Classic hits he'll be staying in retail and I'll be playing the game he originally played and see if I can convince him to join in on the fun.
---
Good advice, I'm enjoying browsing the guild ads. Cheers :)
---
When I raided I was the main tank and raid leader (during WotLK.) I got an immense amount of satisfaction from achieving the goals we set forth. Recruitment, training, scheduling. All these things built up to that first clear. I dunno it just felt great when you clear the raid and everyone in raid chat and guild chat is so happy. 
---
Also phat loot.
---
I rarely drinked between pulls, unless you mean aoe. Instant heals in classic? Not common.
---
They're slow for sure.
---
Does Shadow UI actually work for Classic? This one was always my favorite.
---
Tomorrow 11 am PST
---
Classic is using modern API which doesn't allow anything like this or decursive.
---
“I expect, with no proof obviously other than my own assumptions... dat China and Russia poor lol”
---
Warlocks are 1 button in raids too, one lock casts curse of elements and everyone else shadowbolt spam.
---
Humblebrag
---
Get your spouse to play with you but don't force them to heal you. In fact, offer to heal them.
---
&gt; Did you just.... go into everything he said and shadow box it?
---
Yea. It makes it easier to follow so you know exactly what points I am talking about as you read. 
---
&gt; Honestly what are you doing here?
---
Am I not allowed?
---
&gt; For me retail wow feels very disjointed as an experience. Here is a small list of flaws:
---
&gt; The retail’s talent system is a joke. It is just an illusion of choice more or less.
---
The old talent system was an illusion of choice because there was no choice. You almost always picked the same talents. You almost always picked up the "main" talents going down the tree. You never weighed a talent between two options and picked one over the other in a given tree because it wasn't set up that way. 
---
Furthermore, during the leveling process, getting 1% crit, or 5% mana reduction isn't noticeable. You're not actually seeing your character change in an appreciable way. 
---
At max level, you typically went into the spec for the job you were doing and that was it. No option to switch talents around and try something new based on the content you were doing. 
---
For Legion, I would swap around talents fairly often as a prot paladin to help with progression, or to try a different tactic on a boss as the situation arose. 
---
&gt; Class homogenization is at an all time high. Nearly every class has “spenders” and “builders”
---
For certain specs, in certain classes certainly. Although it's not quite the same. There's levels of nuance there too that you are overlooking. 
---
For Classic you should get comfortable with spamming one or two abilities because that will be your rotation. 
---
&gt; You literally race through expansions while never really experiencing them.
---
There's 14 years worth of content for people to go through in this game. It is not feasible to force people to go through all of it to reach endgame. They also have the opportunity to "halt" their level and "smell the roses" if they really want to. 
---
Besides, Blizzard heard your complaints and actually slowed the leveling process, much to the complaints of everyone else who wanted to just get to endgame as fast as possible. 
---
&gt; You instantly queue like an arena game into Bgs and Raids.
---
Which was a needed improvement. Let me reiterate what happened to me in the beta:
---
&gt; You can't do that in Classic. To put it in perspective, it took me typically about 45mins to create and complete a deadmines group on the beta servers (the second week). As time progressed and more people reached max level or didn't play as much, there would be times (later on in the beta) that I just didn't get to do deadmines at all because not enough people were online or that level. It'll be even harder to get groups together for higher level dungeons. The time frame will be at least an hour or more assuming your group doesn't wipe.
---
About a month or so into the beta, I found myself unable to actually get groups to do deadmines. I would like on, spam general in westfall, go to SW and spam there and I could not find anyone to go. This was on a Saturday around noon as a druid. 
---
The issue with how it works in Classic, is that this will be a problem once the game has "grown up" and most players are max level. It was like that during Vanilla as well. 
---
Now you perhaps see the need for a queuing system. 
---
&gt; Professions are a joke.
---
If by joke you mean, "Gear Professions can't keep up", then yes, it has almost always been that way. It started to be difficult once gear became skill capped rather than time capped. 
---
&gt; Current lore is aids, we have Hellscream two pretty much.
---
Oh certainly. The writing department went to shit around the time of Legion which is coincidentally when Chris Metzen retired. My guess is that he mainly let the "new group" of writers do Legion and was in an advisory role. 
---
&gt; Talent system and going from 110-120 felt like I went from 110-90 in retrospect.
---
Going from artifact weapon to not is going to feel weird for sure. That is why they tried to make the Azerite system work. Although it seems to me like that Azerite system will be the new system going forward. Since you say you were worried about talents not being a choice, the Azerite system is that for you. If the talents are balanced enough, choices present themselves and they do actually when you get to the higher level pieces. 
---
&gt; There is essentially negative sense of community, only exasperated by huge conglomerate guilds.
---
I understand the community aspect, but I wonder if that's because there's so much to do in the game, and so many places you could be. You don't have ti "stand around" in Ironforge and spam for a group. It's not really the hub of the game, so to speak. But a fair point to make.
---
This is the precise reason I’m going alch/herb
---
Theremoore Isle has the mage trainer to Hearth too. Also SW doesn't have ships. They are in Mith xD
---
Yeah but I don’t get to start at cap in a few weeks and I didn’t know if I had it in me to play a vanilla warrior again.
---
Vanilla WoW was designed to be a more casual friendly EQ. It's ironic that now it isn't considered casual at all. It shows you where games have gone in the last 15 years. I am not saying things are better or worse, it's just that PC gaming has gone from a niche appeal for people who were for lack of a better word "nerds" to trying to appeal to an even more mainstream audience. 
---
WoW existed at a time when some games were keeping the replayability up by simply making the game very difficult. So things being difficult in games was totally expected. Now, game companies try and have it all ways, they can make games large enough so that there are hundreds of hours of gameplay without super high difficulty. At the same time companies like Blizzard want to keep their totally hardcore players happy by creating very difficult raids and content. They try to make hardcore players and casually super happy all at the same time to create mass appeal. That doesn't work for me, it screws with the emersion. I dont care that I'll never see Naxx most likely. I like the fact that occasionally a guy in tier 3 walks through Ironforge and I can be impressed. I don't care that I am the best I just like to be part of the world.
---
I made it up
---
Discussing concurrent users in relation to how many servers they need is completely pointless unless you can come up with a reasonable number for how many concurrent users they will have during the first few days.
---
I used total users, as I think somewhere between 1-5 million is a somewhat accepted and reasonable estimate.
---
Didn't you have glow-in-the-dark stars on your ceiling? 😮
---
Raw healing output of a druid depends on the fight, and scales extremely well with gear thanks to high coefficients on HT and swiftmend. Since swiftmend does healing equal to 4 ticks of rejuvenate, which has an 80% spell coefficient, it gets almost double the bonus heals of any instant spell. Unlike holy shock, it's actually worth using. On top of that, ns+ht is about 3k instant heal. Basically lay on hands with 1/20th the cd.
---
If you want to be a hps meter whore, sure, go pally and spam max rank fol on the tank. If you want to keep multiple people alive and save wipes with powerful tools, go druid.
---
Cannabalize, naturally.
---
Delicious man-flesh. Meat is back on the menu!
---
I would say that two trinkets is better than 1 trinket + stun resist.
---
oh hey. Your cosplay is amazing, and I'm super envious
---
Dude its World of Warcraft. Its not Starcraft where you need super high APM.
---
I own a generic $20 keyboard for over 10 years now, you can't even see any letters/numbers on it anymore.
---
I've raided world top 20 in WoW and ranked top 10 in lots of boss fights with my logs, i played around rank 3800-4100 in OW and in all others games im everything but not a casual. (feels cringe to say this but im not trying to brag here lol)
---
And while there might be lots of hardware that could improve my skill in video games i never felt like i was being held back by my $20 keyboard.
---
This, along with TBC were the 2 finest pieces of intro ever created for a video game.
---
Yeah I’m not sure this is the game for you.
---
CWL manager here: These guides were written by seasoned speed-levelers. Hard to get more optimal.
---
Thanks so much for all your work, it's looking incredible. Will the full 1-60 guides be behind a paywall?
---
I signed as orc warrior and just read the directions, which somehow was for shaman. There was a lot of death warping, much more than is possible before level 12. I think it must've said to die, hearth or rez 6 times. You need to straighten that up.
---
Ah yeah I think you're right
---
you can make scopes and certain parts that are required for quests as engineer but it’s somewhat harder to make money as an engineer vs other crafting professions.  Mining and all gathering professions are great money makers as you can just sell the mats you’ve gathered.  Thorium, crystals, and especially higher-end herbs sell for a lot.
---
As an OSRS veteran, Blizzard account security is a breeze.
---
OSRS is so full of holes that I'm pretty sure the fucking President could get his RS account hacked if he didn't use a unique randomly-generated alphanumeric email, username, and 20-character passphrase.
---
Bitter sweet. 
---
Bitter: The pvp community was really special before cross realm bg’s. I was a rank 10 elemental shaman and really loved how you got to know your opposition. Over time, people gained a reputation amongst their own faction and with the other faction (often opposite opinions).  Realm forums exacerbated these opinions.  I loved it.  My 15 year old self thought it was amazing seeing my toon talked about on the forums.  That sense of pvp community was really cool.  I can’t say it was totally gone with cross realm but I would imagine it exists at a higher level. I bet that reputation will only truly exist with premades.
---
Sweet: Queue times were awful and made significantly better with cross realm bg’s.
---
This is totally worth it.
---
On a pserver I got [Living Root](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6631/living-root) from WC at level 20 and used it till level 30. You look like a spaz swinging a staff but it's totally worth it
---
You only need low health at the moment you pop it. Even if you get healed right after you get the full effect for the duration.
---
I will definitely be utilizing this guide, thanks guys!  Are you all considering developing an in-game addon for questing?
---
That's good to know. I think I'll definitely stick with warlock then. Thanks!
---
Classic is getting the retail party raid frames which are perfectly fine for basically any content
---
World of Warcraft is huge in China. I don't know how they decided on 8 servers but I'm under the assumption they know what they're doing.
---
Well if you're picking an unconventional spec which are mostly going to dps, then you're comparing yourself to every non-healer on the damage meter.  Kinda apparent who is being carried and who is pulling their weight.
---
Im gonna enjoy it irl in Munich hopefuly
---
I hate the Horde...but this made me laugh.
---
For sure- if they get an opener and you weren't prepared for a fight you should GTFO 100%
---
where do I get this.
---
There's an absurd amount of Chinese players on Vanilla private servers so I don't see why they wouldn't be interested in Classic.
---
Concurrent users in relation to the population cap of each layer is an extremely important concern. And it is the final number to figure how many servers you need. At peak time, your server can only hold 2500-3000 people once layering goes away. So you need enough servers to make that happen by phase two.
---
Overall users is a number that has no bearing on anything, simply how many servers for peak demand due to concurrent cap.
---
I don’t agree and neither does the serious guilds.
---
No because I realized in my heart I always knew what classes I would play.
---
Come up with a name for each of the class/race combos you are considering, then when you go to make your character, the first one you think of is what you want.
---
Go with your gut
---
It's a psychological effect that isnt specific to WoW. It's not even hype. Your brain is overloaded with choice. You constantly change your mind because you make decisions on a set of factors and then reconsider when looking at another factor.
---
Want to get over it? Dont make a choice. You dont have to commit yourself to anything until Aug. 26.
---
Until then, just focus on learning and having an open mind.
---
I'm not staying it's a cure, but at least give yourself a break and remember you aren't obligated to make constant comparisons.
---
You sound like a boomer “Bbbut according to my local County news station, China is a poor third world country that can’t pay for video games”

exactly
---
Are warriors on their own as bad as people are making them out to be? People are saying to avoid warriors if you plan to do anything solo like queuing for BGs or just questing at 60.
---
How much of this is truth and how much is it people trying to over optimize? Does the weak soloing fade at higher levels/60/with gear?
---
And levelling dungeons are balanced for people in dps specs tanking and healing.
---
OP, if you're serious about levelling only that way, and you and the priest spec appropriately, you can probably 4-man (possibly even 3-man, though boss fights will take forever) them.
---
They have 25% more XP
---
Looking at the beta, not sure it's nearly as useful even if it worked. Warriors leveling seem to have a much easier time compared to say LH. Either they don't seem to be taking as much damage/dealing more damage/faster regen, or combination of them all. Probably not immediately noticeable but I think you see it after a while and compare the 2 side by side.
---
They are still probably the weakest levelers but it seems more forgiving, we will see tomorrow I guess.

---
I honestly think players who primarily play ret that have never played vanilla wow will spec into ret in classic and be like “wtf is this bullshit”. Ret was boring as hell for everything save maybe dueling. That spec / class has received so many reworks and optimization that it will be unrecognizable and borderline offensive to people who aren’t familiar with with its vanilla iteration.

that's just a 6 minute vid on the topic but is the thing that everybody has seen and references.

Gist of it isn't so much the streamers, but their followers. 'notice me senpai' e.t.c.
---
Really appreciate the thought-out answer my dude. This is what I needed to hear. I'm confident enough in my healing, so here's hoping battle res and soulstone will be enough when mistakes inevitably happen. Thanks, man!
---
Does the blue path time include corpse runs from getting smacked by  [Mor'Ladim](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Mor%27Ladim)?
---
Healers never passed on dps loot, in fact it was the same loot while leveling in most situations.  Tanks never passed on dps loot either.  What world did you live in in vanilla.
---
Are you  "deluded" to think there isn't one group of people that can't achieve this?
---
People are taking the week off work, there's no weird time restrictions you're making up. It's going to be pure levelling and minimal sleep. The average adult isn't getting 6 hours of sleep when they're trying, what makes you think that's remotely the standard you should use...
---
They've specifically said that you will "stick" to your layer through play session so it doesn't feel like you're logging in to a random server every time. So yes, it does fill up layers by total population, just like a normal server, not just who is online atm.
---
Also, anything more than five layers is really starting to push it. That's basically saying more than 80% of the server will quit before phase 2 or there will be over-crowding. Ten layers would basically set the server up to be a complete disaster.
---
Hell yeah ⚡
---
Ironforge is amazing cuz there's no bullshit in your way. No bridges or levels or stairwells. Just a circle. O you went the wrong way? Just keep going and you will get where you want to go. Flight point is in the center. Bank and ah are straight across from eachother. The only downside is when you lag and fall in the pit.
---
Orc stun resist
---
Hurray for official confirmation on RP-PvE server(s)!
---
edit: For non-roleplayers looking to roll on RP servers to avoid the omegalel neckbeard streamerdrones, I hope you guys enjoy the server atmosphere and may even get enticed to give it a shot.
---
On the survey something like 66% of people on this sub do not have an active wow Acct.  says a lot.
---
Is it 25% more from the mob because it is elite or because the group xp ratios are different than on private servers?
---
There may be fewer spots for Hunters than Mages, but Mages might be so over-populated at 60 that you will have to fight for a spot more.
---
Fun fact: NobleGarden is technically classic since the eggs were spawning and contained random Easter-themed items for one day. Like the totally un-PC Easter Dress which never made a return. A new item named the Elegant Dress was added instead in future versions. My warrior that I've preserved in level 60 Vanilla jelly still has an Easter Dress.
---
I can't remember which other holidays had vanilla origins.
---
Ha, a little bit. I was pretty proud of my Discipline Priest game during Legion. But, more importantly, the shields from Disc were super helpful for surviving his 0% healing debuff.
---
Rogue because that was my main and I know I have fun with it.  Priest due to usefulness and I’ve never really healed before.  Warlock due to usefulness/good compromise between damage and fun spells or utility.  Probably all undead.
---
Look at this guy able to afford flights in classic. *cries in repair bills*
---
Exactly. This is insane. I'm keeping my $10 until the games releases. Checkmate Blizzard
---
Pure horde but am considering an ally alt on another server for the experience. 100% going dwarf mostly because this

---
good luck using shift modifiers with movement keys on a $20 walmart keyboard
---
Hunters can be split up into the melee groups, and there's probably only 2-3 in the raid. 
---
Something like this, 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/raid-composition#0gFtvBcccccpppnszzzzsjwjhsgqjhshhjFshhjFs
---
How? If you’re talking about Paladin abilities bs undead, Forsaken arent undead
---
I completely agree with you, but I don't think Blizzard will do it.
---
It really isn't, because one of them will have the aggro while the other does not get parried anymore which can be huge.
---
You also won't get ganked nearly as much if you grind in the middle of the pack.
---
You would need to be ganged on by 3-5 players to take you down.
---
No downtime due to the paladin just saving mana for heals, so it's just an endless pewpewpew whereas paladin or warrior solo would have to drink/eat all the time.
---
I did the leveling to 60 alt tabbing on a pserver which allowed that sort of multiboxing and leveling a warrior + shaman in 8 day /played was a blast really.
---
Last private server I played on it looked more busy than this and I was playing 24+ hours after the launch.
---
Get a cat pet first. Then spec it to the raid you're going to do. Most likely Onxy and MC first. You should spec for claw, Fire resist, shadow resist, stamina and depending on your points in bm  (if you take beastial swift)i'd say dash. Then its about know the encounters, learn the melee rotation in boss fights. Onxyia for example. After Raid leader says light damage put your pet on it and make sure its positioned good. not in front or back but side where melee is. It should stay up the whole first phase. phase 2 you can top him up and put him back on follow. phase 3 is same as phase 1. This goes for all bosses in which no special debuff would be put on pets. For rag fight i put my pet in melee group and use the stay function to go in and out at the same time as melee. If submerge happens you can revive or top him up.
---
I bought a HP EliteDesk 800 G1 and stuck a GTX 1050 Ti in it. Cost like $350 and plays most things at 120+ FPS.
---
Same reason i like clicker games.
---
"just a little bit further next time"
---
&gt; they have already literally said they won't.
---
They have said they literally won't to many things. You guys *seriously* need to stop trusting companies with blank promises like this. Time and time again, they go back on what they say.
---
Wait rly what's the interact keybind?
---
Group XP rate is exactly the same.

Elites in dungeons give 25% more XP baseline.

Not even in Darnassus my friend :(

whatever you do, don't just accept the random guild invites people will send your way unless you know the player. there will be tons of absolute trash zerg guilds
---
Same.
---
WoW tokens, lol. WoW tokens ruined wow. Go get a job if you can't pay your sub, and grind for your gold instead of buying it. Oh, and cross realm BGs -- it's in. Nobody wants to wait 2 hours for a BG.
---
To this day, watching this intro gives me hard shivers and goosebumps. TBC and wotlk too, but the vanilla intro is something else.
---
If you hide your helmet you won't be a power ranger.
---
Are you playing range? If so, you can just chain-pull/dot and have him finish off enemies. Makes for nice loot piles
---
And then they'll say "Whoopsies! See, we totally *wanted* to remove layering, but the game is so popular that the servers are a bit too packed still, so you'll just have to wait a *wittle bit longer*, okay?"
---
Definitely not rogue, but troll, it is tempting
---
Ditto! I've been waiting for a legit Classic WoW experience for SO LONG. It's crazy that we're finally almost there!
---
The point is Blizzard will dictate exactly how busy launch areas will be (and they want launch to be playable, not require people to spam instants and tag mobs before they're even visible) no matter how many people log on so the starting zone picture you linked won't be a thing with Classic. That aside that only invalidates your third point, the other 4 are still valid :p
---
Sage advice
---
Laughs in alternate layer
---
I'm not sure what I want to play. I have a few things that I know I'll enjoy doing. I've never been able to raid or do anything that requires voice chat because of some pretty bad anxiety issues. I'm looking for some advice between priest and mage. So most of my playtime will mostly end up as farming, dungeons, or casual pvp. 
---
I'd like to be able to farm materials to make bags, mostly just because I enjoy a relaxing farm, and because I'd like to focus on tailoring/enchanting for making gold. I'd like to do some dungeons, and do enjoy healing as well as dpsing. I'm leaning a bit more towards mage because that's what I played during classic. Mage has some upsides that I'd like, namely ease of travel and being self-sufficient on food for farming. But it might be harder to get into groups for dungeons. So, I'm not really sure which to pick. I think either way I'll play human, and on an RP realm. I don't really crave world pvp the way I used to, so I think I'm set there. 
---
I'd appreciate any feedback, thanks.
---
Oh didn’t know, thank you!
---
Or you know... have vacation days.
---
Oh man, the amount of childhood memories, achievements and emotions I had in Runescape are in a league of their own.

The first time I obtained Mithril Armor...

The few times I lost it.. tears were shed

Friend got scammed
---
I got scammed
---
The memories are an endless nostalgia trip. The game was just 'this other fantasy world' me and my friends could hang out and progress in parallel to the real world.
---
Too cool.
---
oh damn, you are right man, I just checked and it doesn't work :( sorry my bad.
---
The whole macro this, macro that and yada-yada scares the hell out of me. I just want a class that just... works? Without too many buttons nor high IQ plays (did I just roast myself?)
---
I don’t want to be the reason stuff fails... I want to contribute, but not be a main focus? Meh. 
---
TL;DR
---
I suck at games, what’s an easy class?
---
Nothing but respect for my man Dankenstein.
---
Well I'm just going to assume the reason the OP hasn't responded yet is because he has been sent into a deep deep depression. 
---
Meet me in Kharanos or Thelsamar my man and I will buy you a few rounds.
---
Great thanks :)
---
You still haven't posted a response. you said you hate layering, which means you want to have 50k people in your starting zone (there is no other alternative). Instead of typing a response, you keep typing retarded "this is wut ur argument iz lolol". 
---
you're a dumbass. If you can't defend your point, stop responding. It's embarrassing
---
the day BGs go live there will already be fully decked out twinks and twink guilds
---
Do it
---
Private server spirit regen is half of what it will be on Classic.
---
If horde(pvp) pm me - I'm planning on rolling rogue and hopefully landing one of these groups :D
---
Which would hold up better over time with little to no raiding for gear?
---
Well, you could move the hunters out of the melee groups, and reduce it by 1.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/raid-composition#0gFtvBcccccppwnszzzqswzgFpFjhhshhjjshhjjs
---
A single priest, mage or hunter could kill them both 2v1 without skipping a beat. The paladin would probably survive though assuming they have a bubble hearth macro. 
---
Also a shamen and pally are not even remotely the same thing. You have way more mana, way more gap closers, way more mobility.
---
Note: The priest would have to jump the charge.  So mage and hunter have it easier.
---
Before you make a post asking what to name your gnome mage, might I suggest:  Crockfood
---
That depends how many of the big streamers announce their server intentions early to allow their followers to reserve names on the server and faction of their picking. And if they change their mind...well lol.
---
8 servers for China. this is not worldwide server count
---
Layers are not independent. They share an economy, they share chat channel, they share the auction house, you can jump to different layer by joining a group (or possibly a new guild) etc. They aren't independent like a server.
---
Man, I’m gunna play horde because I love their mounts but iron forge makes me wanna play ally
---
The numbers are fairly relative to each other. A server with twice as many total players will have about twice as many concurrent players. But again, unless you can supply a number for how many total concurrent they will have it's impossible to say if 20 or 50 or 100 servers will be enough.
---
This is such an amazing concept. This will help a lot with the players that seem to get “lost” in the leveling process or hit “walls” in terms of where to go. I’ve seen it posted in chat channels for years.. “[2]: Where is the best place to level at lvl xx?”.
---
They later borrowed ideas like lfg, queueing for pvp, world quests and numerous other things from WHOAOR
---
Pservers launch: 1 at a time
---
Classic launch: X servers per region
---
All classic players will be split among many servers, not just 1. And those servers will be Russian/Chinese free
---
Hilarious that 3-4 hrs a day is “limited play time”. I’ll be lucky to get 2 hrs per x 3 nights per week.
---
They are heavily gear dependant and harder to level than most classes. You will need cooking and bandages.
---
Once you get to 60 they only get better with gear, to the point where it can be absurd. Still fairly squishy in BGs if targeted down; hence why most pro pvp warrs queue with a pocket healer.
---
I mean, how in hell are you gonna take this shit? Aerial assault? Frontal assault? Good one. Assaulting from bellow would be the idea, or a massive earth quake. But you'd figure the dwarves are prepared for that. A siege would last forever too.
---
Ironforge.. The most dwarven city ever.
---
Do you have a favorite fantasy series? Maybe a character from that, or in the style of a name from that. Or if you have a favorite letter pick that and try to make a troll sounding name from it.
---
Why would they ban you for that
---
Very true, 10k doesn't work w/o dynamic respawn. If we did end up with mega servers though, surely blizzard could implement something similar?
---
As a beautifully bearded dwarf, I had to leave the cloak off if anyone (including myself) was going to see my tabard.
---
It makes healers heal you in raids lol when they under pressure and think your a fellow healer
---
Tauren paladins was where I drew the line.
---
Aye.
---
This is the right advice though. I've leveled 6 Priests to 60 in Vanilla (1 retail, 5 pvt) and here's my thoughts on it.
---
\#1- Shadow Spec can heal any 5-man dungeon up to 60 in the game without issue.   
---
\#2 - Most 5-mans are easy and you will not be required to heal full-time, meaning you should be helping with DPS and Shadow is clearly the best bet there.   
---
\#3 - At some point you're going to have to do quests/farming on your own, whether that's class specific quests, attunements or materials farming and Shadow reigns supreme for that as well.  
---
\#4 - Healing gear does not become a thing until you're higher level. As you level the gear you'll get will provide the most benefit to the Shadow spec, specifically high Spirit for crazy Spirit Tap regeneration. At 60 +healing gear is all over and that's the best time to switch over.
---
Obviously this choice is completely yours but it's important to note that Shadow is, without question, the best spec to level a Priest with. If you're in a group just ask them to let you get 1 Killing Blow per pack and you'll never need to stop the group to drink (should do this as Holy anyway imo, Spirit Tap is OP for leveling/grinding/dungeons). 
---
This doesn't even take into account that Shadow Priests are beasts in PvP. In a game that's going to be absolutely packed with Paladins and Mages rolling a Shadow Priest is going to be fun as hell. Paladins are basically unkillable for most classes 1-on-1 but not Shadow Priests. Anyone with mana will run away from you as fast as they can.
---
his brain is broken
---
&gt;That depends how many of the big streamers announce their server intentions early
---
No, it doesn't, because you don't have any proof whatsoever they are being genuine.
---
This isn't what they are talking about. You are so ignorant
---
I think I've finally sorted out my class. Idk what I'm going to do for race. My favorite Priest from vanilla was a NE but idk if that is going to be min maxed enough for my own interest.
---
Sylvanas is probably the only one who could if she hadn't blown her plague load in Undercity.
---
⛈️🌎🔥 baby
---
It's the constant missing, parrying and dodging that I found made private servers far more difficult. Orc/Human racials make a significant different on private servers, while in vanilla it was fairly unnoticeable except on damage meters.
---
I don’t wanna do a straight name copy, but something troll sounding would be cool.

All hail onixya
---
Hey, this looks awesome! I'm having trouble with my mobile Android at the moment, so I can't review it in detail.
---
One question that I have. Is there a quick way to view the previous quests in a chain in the case that your on the 4th or 5th leg and aren't sure if you've missed one or if you're ahead? 
---
It also looks like there are some dungeon quests that are important and have been included here (like Deadmines). Some dungeons always seem to have quests and drops that are really good for some classes, and not others. It would be super cool to be able to include lead up quests for dungeons that you know you're going to do, versus ones that won't gain you much. Would there be a way to add certain dungeons to your route?
---
You literally told them 'you do you' and fishing and exploring \*is\* their version of that. ;)
---
gw2?
---
Of course they aren't...  It doesn't make sense for the to be independent.   The number of layers is dynamic, and controlled by the server.
---
And I actually like it. But they would be better as burgers and leather gear.
---
Type English names into Google translate and mess around with different languages to find a name that looks cool to you
---
Just convert the timezone.... wow
---
Fun is key! Thanks for the reminder!
---
Idk if it's naturally bound, but you can find it and bind it yourself in the keybind settings. Interact with target it's called.
---
i was under the influence of substances at 3am trying to figure out a name. then the chuck norris total body gym infomercial came on. totalbodygym was born.
---
There are 2-3x common stun effects as there are Charm/Sleep/Fear effects and the primary class using those effects is Warlock, one of the least played classes on Alliance.
---
good points thanks!
---
layers are great for world bosses, more people show up and faster spawn times, what's not to like?
---
All options are pretty competent, actually.
---
Keep in mind that most good pvp gear will be in raids at some point, so ele sham and s priest are gonna have to respec healer and do some runs.
---
&gt; So it solves dead servers, transfers, mergers, 4 hour long queues?
---
If the layers are independent, they can still do exactly the same thing they are already planning to do: They will reduce the number of layers over time. Whether or not they are independent doesn't change that.
---
Each layer can still be around the size of a vanilla server, so you shouldn't have queue times any longer than with current layering.
---
&gt; You're all over ranting and raving about layering but it's here to stay. How about just waiting for the final iteration and giving constructive feedback instead of complaining about the inevitable.
---
Nah, fuck that defeatist attitude.
---
Id go with Thexjr personally
---
Dude great idea!
---
Yes it is. And this change to the EULA was made at the same time Blizzard pulled their licenses for Geforce Now.
---
Thanks for the list and download link.
---
This has worked for me before, thanks for reminding me! I highly recommend to anyone else
---
Mine has 2. so thats plural.
---
Those spreadsheet kids are the reason why layering exist. They will be so disappointed when they realize that Classic is a long grind. Pvp is about farming Honor and have nothing to do with racial.
---
I dont want new MMOs. All I want is Classic+.
---
And maybe a Warhammer Online/SWG relaunch
---
great points thanks for sharing!
---
How much of a meme spec is shadow, really? (Every thread seems to have a different opinion on it)
---
Like, how viable and competitive is it in  solo content, 5mans and raids.
---
\&gt;I'm considering holy paly, mage, and shaman. 
---
Well, we have three character slots. My main is warlock, but I was also considering rogue, so that's going on one of my other slots. I'm also creating a warrior for a few different reasons.
---
I will be looking forward to that episode.
---
Thise run around and talk to other NPC quests are so irritating
---
Yeah. I’m endorsed by twitch.
---
That's not how layering works nor the purpose. The purpose of layering is to make the game playable. 3000 players in the first 6 starting zones is not playable, 3000 players spread out between 25 zones is probably managable. Layering is dynamic and it's entire purpose is to ensure the game is playable which means it will dynamically update (ie start merging layers as players spread out) to ensure the game is not completely overcrowded)

Good to know thanks 👍 a little bit glad that ice claw bears 1 level above you won't be able to solo you this time around

I would suggest finding a guild and seeing what roles they might need the most help with. That helped me narrow down my choice. Best of luck and have fun my dude!
---
You can hamstring kite in pswrvers... not sure if u can do that in vanilla replica
---
Theres no fun/social interaction at level 120
---
Goosebumps everytime
---
There's only 2 purchases you can make in WoW: A sub, and BfA. A sub grants you everything up to BfA, and obviously access to Classic.
---
Nothing beats wotlk intro. It's like lord of the rings, only more
---
How would server infrastructure change the fact that several hundred players are flocking the same quest?
---
Modern retail expansion launches have been relatively smooth, with only like 0-2 server restarts, not much lag and sharding making it so that there's enough mobs to level. I doubt it will be anything like the private server launches.
---
LOTRO is a successful game, it just has a different audience
---
Hunter definitely, my father plays hunter and it he can anybody can
---
You won't be power shifting while leveling. It's too mana intensive. You want mana to heal yourself between pulls and rebuffs
---
This is news to me, where did you hear that?
---
Thankyou
---
&gt; they want launch to be playable, not require people to spam instants and tag mobs before they're even visible 
---
Source?
---
Yeah it's a word, but he meant to say 'wary' in this context -- displaying caution.
---
Wary &amp; weary = 2 separate words.
---
You are better off pulling with FFF.
---
You can, but you'll likely be asked/told to heal regardless. Vanilla saw Paladins as providing the best single target healing, and it's likely in this day that guild recruiters and raid leaders will look down their nose at you.
---
Classes felt like they had more identity at launch, with them becoming more and more interchangeable as time has marched on. As long as you understand the potential of your paladin's toolbox, and can bring those tools to full effect with your play, you'll be an asset to your group.
---
I played paladin at launch, ended up being in charge of a little paladin squad for raids. There would certainly be conversation within our little group in the guild about how to best use our abilities for various fights. Sometimes (most of the time) we were all healing all the time with cleansing duties, as that's just what the best use for us was. A few times I would task a couple of the paladins to hitting stuff so they could roll around with the melee crowd and support them more closely. I never had a straight up ret paladin in the group though. 
---
Looking back, I wouldn't give one a hard no on joining paladin squad. Again, that hinges on if the tools the ret paladin brings to the table are potent enough for the encounters we're facing.
---
End of the day, play what you want. Just be aware that your class spec choices my cause you social grief.
---
*should have
---
I’m still confused as to whether i use 1h or 2h for fury leveling...
---
Unless arms is better?
---
I will have to, i was wondering if someone with Beta experience would be able to reply.
---
I initially thought that I was going to play a mage, but I later changed to warlock because it seems a lot more chill (demon friend to hang out with, lifesteal mechanics to stay alive, etc.).
---
However, after learning more about rogues, I also want to play a rogue. That will likely be my secondary character.

Seems weird that everyone is predicting huge numbers of rogues and hunters and they're the least represented classes next to druids.
---
This is the exact thing that got me into multiboxing back in Vanilla. Warriors were brutal to level when I started but I had a nice T2 priest so I got a second account and healbotted the warrior. The difference in having a pocket healer as a warrior vs going solo is indescribable. It basically goes from torture to Bliss. My advice for you as a warrior is to make friends with healers :)

I'm going Human Pally, leveling Ret and then making the jump to the infamous Tankadin. I love the 5 man dungeons so I'll be looking at tanking those, working out the meme class then spacing Holy or Ret for pvp. 
---
I've been trying to make the perfect Paladin type class on Skyrim for a few years, 1H, Shield and heaps of Holy firepower so I want to try and translate that to WoW. Don't really care if that fits with other gamers ideals soz.
---
that'll be $15 and 1 soul pls
---
Layering exists as a way to control population without having the server eventually die due to underpopulation.
---
They want a realm to hold \~2.5k people, so it's split up into several *layers* of 2.5k, allowing it to shed layers once the playercount drops, instead of population density.
---
10g per totem
---
Yeah 15 minutes? Enjoy your queue 😅

Warlocks are much more common on PvP servers than they are on PvE ones:

Its absolutely possible by 2004 standards, but game publishers dont make such games anymore because microtransactions on crappy Battle Royale games are better income.
---
WoW survived primarily by the absurd amount of subs
---
Good call brother, I often forget to stretch before gaming and damn it reminds me a lot has changed from 12 to 27 haha.
---
It's actually spaghetti-Os.
---
Since I'm rolling a Troll Shaman named Thex instead of my old Tauren, I'll be running all the way to Mulgore. Love that zone.
---
Loot competition shouldn't be too bad, you'll likely want to stack different stats than your husbands warrior.
---
Weapons should always go to your husband's warrior first though, it will make leveling a lot faster for you both.
---
I already play CS and TF2, both of which are more physically demanding. I just do kettlebell swings between rounds.
---
&gt;their raiding damage rotations were complicated
---
They spam shadowbolt.
---
Most will go fury dps or arms pvp.
---
Should note this is not a speed leveling guide
---
Well elf can't be warlock and i ain't playing a shorty
---
And neither I'm playing a horde savage
---
I played on an RP server in retail without problems, because I didn't bother anyone and I don't fill trade chat with garbage. I don't think I'm selfish, but you're welcome to your own opinion.
---
There was a guide posted a few days ago here that had grind only leveling 1-40 for undead rogues where the guidemaker claimed 200g at 40 as well as some decent leveling to a few professions (might have just been first aid though).
---
Not generally the way I like to experience the game but it makes the idea of a rogue alt and main other class more appealing to me.
---
2h for leveling. Arms definitely better lvl 40 and on. 10-40 either works
---
Those smart enough will raid as tank and get all the dps plate and respect when bgs are available
---
&gt;So what’s everyone’s guess on this? Everyone just going to PvP and not run Raids? They do know that gear for PvP comes from PvE for the most part correct?
---
I mean you understand that most warriors in a raid will not be tanking, correct?
---
I'm going to be the warrior and my friend will be a shaman.
---
Layering.
---
Jesus fuck does my post really need a /s tag?
---
What are you some sort of super hero ? I tried this and my body was on fire after like 3 minutes.
---
Most will go fury and tank dungeons anyway.
---
For sure going troll shaman. Personal bloodlust is insane, their self utility is also insane, and chain heal is my favorite spell in the game. Haven’t nailed down an alt yet but I’m sure I’m gonna be so busy with my main I won’t even bother with an alt
---
Dude the distribution is almost perfect.  It's actually really good.  Don't pick a class based on what other people aren't or aren't playing, pick a class that seems most fun to you.  Then make yourself stand out by being good at the class and fun to play with.
---
Ah yea I think that's where the disconnect is. I manually downloaded them and put them in the folder. It recognized and knew when they needed updates after that. 
---
I did it this way because at the time curse wasn't supporting the classic filter yet.
---
I don't think there's a need for a reddit discord.  LFG and trade facilitation would be pointless because of all the servers blended.  The only thing you'd get on there is the same shit I'm reading here, which honestly I wouldn't want an up to date live feed of that.
---
Unless someone wants to make a Reddit guild, but I'd like to know what server that is, so I can avoid it. haha
---
I am not sure if this is a meme to how bad WoW expansion launches are or if you are serious. 
---
Ugh do I upvote for sarcasm or downvote for being serious?
---
same man, always hated the vanilla private caps.
---
BROOOOOOOO we Horde have fucking AQ! Like lemme just get my Warchiefs and skip on down to AQ with max buff duration.

---
Item and game object links are not yet implemented in the tool. The data distinguishes this with the brackets which is what you are seeing. The final product will detect square brackets, identify this as an item ID, and provide the correct link while not displaying the brackets themselves. Same thing with angle brackets and game objects, i.e. &lt;Water Pitcher&gt;.
---
Yep
---
/u/WhyLater as well 
---
we only had 1 druid so we could barely use the roar to move between positions in the freezing phase. Plus people focused too much on nuking the boss so they didn't care about the clones (or whatever they were called). Literally every wipe since the 10th were because we were massive idiots. 
---
Worst part was when we killed Vari I had to switch from SV hunter (which I loved) to MM hunter on coven. Dullest progress of my life(But it was one of my favorite bosses. It should've been the first or second boss though, with how easy it was) . I just sat near the boomkin for 100+ wipes doing my standard rotation on every single pull. I refused to log on on raid nights after killing that because I was so sick of spending 100 attempts because people refused to do the bare minimum of thinking.
---
Layering would change that.  Server infrastructure would change the long login ques.

It's better to stack int spirit and Stam over agile and str for enhance or shamans in general while leveling. Strength doesn't provide enough ap to be useful at lower levels compared to say, intellect and spirit giving you a much larger mana pool.

---
This is the right advice. Gear prio is wep &gt; spirit &gt; stam, at least for like the first half of leveling. From 1-15 or so literally buy vendor axes if they are better.
---
Healers do all the work anyway.  Tanks just stand around taking damage!
---
Organizing up everyone's blessing assignments for 40 person raids though. That I don't miss.
---
Rehash everything. Legacy servers on every mmo out there.
---
How viable would druid 0/30/21 be for raiding?
---
I like feral druid, i like pvp too. Itemization for feral is best in raids, therefore i have to raid, at least up to AQ20.
---
Even full resto druid heals are mediocre.  
---
Main pros of a druid in a raid are innervate (for priest) and Brez.
---
Thoughts?
---
2 is RNG
---
Have you ever heard the tragedy of the Hakkar blood-plague in vanilla Ironforge?
---
World PvP adds a layer but is not necessary to enjoy the game imo.  I think the biggest thing for me is getting to 60 and being unable to contest other gatherers of the other faction as they gather herbs/ mine.  
---
It's so fun to be gathering/farming, seeing someone of the opposite faction, and killing them to take their lotus/rtv.  Of course it sucks when it happens to you though.
---
I'm going addon-less just like I did 15 years ago.
---
PREACH!
---
&gt; the fact that this game has such great feeling combat and responsiveness.
---
Debatable. Classic currently has those "leeway" features added to the game. Players are able to hit players further away than normal, and there's the Tauren hit box thing. 
---
These are things that were fixed in later editions, but it was added to Classic for authenticity. 
---
&gt; The time sink on leveling and on gear really makes the epic items feel truly epic/rare and rewarding.
---
This is a feature that will likely not return in future WoW expansions or games in general. You'll find that most of Classic content is gated by time, not by skill. Getting certain mounts, titles, or the best gear in retail requires you to be good at the game. Classic is not going to have that level of difficulty and it will be interesting to see how well people do with raids once people make it to endgame. 
---
The other thing is your perception of reward. You are giving an object or task value based on your time spent, rather than other factors, like difficulty, or coordination. Games like Wild Star attempted to do that and it did not work out very well for them. 
---
&gt; And the 2 opposing factions giving the players an "enemy" that's a real person.
---
Not sure what to say to this. You have that now I think.
---
&gt; The fact that they naturally let the factions encounter each other in the world creating endless dynamic conflict and struggle.
---
That is more so in retail and past expansions that Classic by a long shot. 
---
&gt; Not just sitting around queing up to meet your enemy in a completely controlled and repetitive environment.
---
To be clear, that was the only way to get titles like Grand Marshal in Classic. And to point to your "time spent" argument, the only way to get Grand Marshal was to quite literally do nothing but pvp for 8-10 hours a day, every day, for a month or two.
---
Oof bad news homie
---
Honestly that's about as good as a kill as it forces the paladin to leave the area completely. I will be playing alliance, but if I were Horde I think I would love this outcome.
---
The best option for alliance rogue pvp is dwarf because you can stoneform into vanish.
---
The best option for horde rogue pvp is orc because stun resist is greater than either a haste buff or wotf. WotF is unneccessary because of the numerous ways to break fear, charm, sleep compared to the extremely limited amount of options to break or be immune to stuns.
---
Coming from a vanilla rogue that played UD through vanilla and TBC.
---
I fell asleep waiting for the dark portal to open. I woke up two hours later and ran straight inside. There was no-one around. And even the first quests were not crowded. I guess most people did not fall asleep...
---
Please remember to set up your authentication for your luggage.
---
Yes you will be able to configure addons for launch day on the stress test.
---
Lol its not an argument its just things i enjoyed about the game cool your jets buddy
---
Won't be that either... I guess nobody participated in the stress tests... they are easily able to increase and decrease the amount of layers of each server on the fly.
---
It's not 2004 where they had to cap at 3k... again someone that didn't watch the devs interviews. They specifically said back then it wasn't a gameplay decision to cap at 3k.
---
We could have a server edith 47 layers on day 1 and 32 layers on day 3

It entirely depends on when and where. Their heights are completely random based on current need.
---
General rule of thumb, overworld&lt;dungeon&lt;raid in sizes
---
Which part are you refuting?
---
You're going to have a full ideal server population per layer, as Blizzard has stated multiple times, so your launch experience will still be a clusterfuck.
---
Even with layering, you're going to have 500+ people in both the Orc and Human start zones for sure.
---
OP Please share where you got this!?
---
on launch, no one has money. There is no gold in the economy. So even if you spent time listing leather on the auction house, no one would buy it, and even if they could, they would not be able to compete with vendor prices.
---
This obviously changes quickly in the first couple weeks, but on a fresh server, everyone relies on vendors and quests to inject money into the economy.

They only wear the rouge as a camouflage.
---
I think it has the chance to influence future iterations of WoW if it ends up being a huge draw. Otherwise the model will stay the same.
---
All of the P2W / monetization stuff weakens the overall game. It's a race to the bottom that no one is winning, least of all gamers.
---
Warriors are not hard to level as long as you do the following: Never grind higher level mobs(That's for OPed classes like hunters).  Go herbing/acly for ends HP pots and work them into your rotation and use them when you get an extra mob in your pull.  Get a new weapon as often as possible(at least every 5 levels) and make sure it's slow hard hitting weapon.  Learn to hamstring and run via strafing when you bite off too much. It's not hard.  
---
Finally, the fun part of leveling a warrior is see how close you can get to death without dying in order to maximize your grind speed.  It's a lot of fun.
---
Focus on getting the best dungeon gear first. While saving to create an arcane reaper or hammer off the titans. After that then just do it. Have fun killing stuffs. Alchemy also helps as you can buff yourself with some nice potion buffs again.
---
I mean private servers are so far from actual vanilla.
---
We are also going to have sharding.... So no way will this happen.
---
I saw there was a fan update for Peggle for Classic. I'mma hafta try it out tomorrow lol.
---
Why do you need cooking? I just lvled a warrior on a pserver to lvl 43 and mostly used bandages. I think I bought 2 stacks of food max, rest are from drops or quests. Isn't cooking annoying to level?
---
    /tar Jandice
---
People really do this?
---
But you will probably get the nemesis helmet from Ony early. Maybe even before your tier 1 headpiece. iirc the tier 2 head is BiS until tier 3. Another thing that sucks is post ZG warlocks have to wear the bloodvine set with their tier 2 head, which looks awful lol.
---
I like to think a lot of people fudged their answer.

Looks like they updated the post to show your local time

Because everything in classic had to serve a larger purpose or be about efficiency? People just couldn’t enjoy some camaraderie, trying to complete a long dungeon?
---
Do what? RP?
---
Four starting zones. Multiple layers.

Make “big items” that are trinkets or weapons 50.

Make BIS rings, amulets, and cloaks, as well as  tier set pieces 30.

Suboptimal weapons  and situational trinkets 25.

Suboptimal jewelry and accessories, 10 or 15.

Meme items, mounts or things like onyxia hide backpack, free roll.

Aren’t they a California based company?
---
You can certainly die that many times. It's quite simple. 
---
Can you point to any specific circumstance where a death warp would not be possible or somewhere you think there is a data issue? The routes have been extensively tested and mapped on pservers and beta. Everything done in the guide is quite possible, what could very well be an issue is the data displaying incorrectly.
---
So you shouldn't get stunned by Charge or Intercept but will get feared by Intimidating Shout? yeah okay...
---
And no, it's 5 classes: Druids has Bash and Pounce, Hunters have Intimidation, Paladins have Hammer of Justice, Rogues have Cheap Shot and Kidney Shot, Warriors have Charge, Intercept, and Concussive Blow.
---
I've pretty much considered every class combo at least once, and so far, I've gone back to Priest the most. 
---
For now, I'm set on Priest. Let's just see what happens when we finally get to the character screen, though.
---
You do realize this whole discussion topic was about Tanking correct?
---
Tried twice using Android Firefox. Froze both times
---
It was big news the first week of beta and was one of the first things on the [not a bug list](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-not-a-bug-list/175887). Privates server's use TBC core where warrior health regen was halved.   
---
[Here's a clip.](https://youtu.be/vbmOn_sus_A?t=1115) Just in normal gear without spirit stacking he heals a 4% a tick out of combat, healing from 50% to 100% in 25 seconds. This is nothing like private servers where if you venture out above level 10 you better have stacks of food with you because it would take you many minutes to regen if you run out of food and bandages.
---
Nice, those are logical reasons. I'm thinking about going elemental shaman myself. I never tried it before but I like the class flavor, ghostwolf is pretty rad. Also like the battlemage aspect that I assume it feels like playing, like a non squishy caster with a bit of melee.
---
Also considering Warrior just cuz. Either Troll or undead if horde
---
Wrong or else you'd source where they say "your launch experience will be a clusterfuck"
---
Swear people love just making shit up on this sub lol...
---
People still don't understand how layering works a couple weeks out form classic.. bananas.
---
The amount of layers only increases if the "cup flows over".
---
It doesn't dilute playerbases, if it did it would literally just be sharding. It sections them into layers of a flat amount.
---
ElvUI

Yeah. That’s true.
---
I am not arguing. You asked me what I thought.
---
&gt;Honestly its super lame and sad to me that no other company has come even close to capturing this again. This is what all other MMOs fail to create IMO, is a the feeling of a real world with real people and real danger. ***What do you guys think?***
---
If anything, I've hopefully helped to manage your expectations, or the expectations of others who do not know anything about the game or don't remember. 
---
Or maybe that could be considered spoiling?
---
*Relative* to other giant launches, WoW has had a pretty decent run of things. Some of the launches have been pretty smooth even.
---
At 9:20... look how lit WoW was back then. Orgimmar was PACKED.

Yeah, it's a weird thing on this sub that everyday I see way more comments and threads about being off meta and supporting fellow off meta folks, and that people shouldn't push them down, but I don't actually see anyone here that's shitting on the things they want to play. Think it's just how reddit works.
---
Right!? I’m so pumped!
---
Absurd in a good way, yes; dps-wise. A well geared Arms warrior can go through most players like they’re nothing.
---
But again that means some commitment to getting good gear. Pvp, raids; initially crafting and and dungeons.
---
Going alchemy is actually good for you since you can make Arcanite Bars, which are required for Arcanite Reaper; basically a pre-raid BiS item.
---
And to think it's an automatic system that can't be manipulated for the first couple of days is just being ignorant.
---
Makes me want to roll a dwarf hunter for classic!
---
Didnt they decide those aren't valid anymore? Or was it just announced that they will stop working soon?
---
Wait so the flight is actually the quickest? I thought you were saying it was slowest by a lot. And I think so did others looking at the top comment...
---
Need wallpaper link
---
Mainly Ironforge is the defacto capital because of it's location. Closer to Blackrock Mountain where a lot of endgame content is. Closer to Menethil Harbor which takes you over to Darnassus and Theramore. Centrally located on the continent so it's a good universal starting point for any flight in the Eastern Kingdoms.
---
Back in Vanilla I kept my Hearth in Menethil Harbor. I rather fly up to Ironforge in order to use the city's ameneties then fly down to the harbor any time I needed to travel.
---
Which race? I would play alliances female and hordiesbmale.
---
Yes, absolutely!
---
The point is when we're looking for the best daggers, we don't want the first dagger listed to be 8th in the list of results.
---
I always take this, felt like the fastest one to me. Apparently it wasn't.
---
I see. I don't know too much about tanking but I know that a few raid bosses such as Onyxia and Nefarian use fear, so I guess Will of the Forsaken could come in handy there.
---
I mean I like undead a lot too, but I feel like the orc racial is just too good to pass up. Depends on how far your aim is I guess, but yeah that's one of the tougher choices.
---
It actually will.
---
I've been wanting wow classic for a long time. A long grindy game with a community. Didnt get into private servers because I knew I'd lose my progress eventually. I can now legitly play
---
It is, yes. Food recipes however usually also give some nice buffs. Theoretically, cooking is useful for any class without heals.
---
Raid bosses are a totally separate phenomenon and have nothing to do with the OP
---
We are experiencing issues on mobile support. Dev time on mobile support is very high prio.
---
Naw dude, Org is the shit.
---
You're both right? Except for the phrase "only for", otherwise layering is serving both purposes mentioned. Not sure that there is even a disagreement here.
---
Really?! Oh man... I kept hearing hunters are super difficult to play well :(
---
They were experimenting with layer sizes last stress test. Some were filled to the brim and others were like ghost towns.
---
For Maraudon farming, even Shadow and Nature resist are pretty useful for your pet. Shadow to resist the goblin's fear which can semi-wipe you. And Nature to resist Princess' fart AOE.
---
What if everyone knew everyone on a megaserver?
---
Cool thanks, I'm leaning more and more towards mage
---
you seem like the one who haven't done your research. What uimbtw says is actually the case, the reason why it will vanish after a while (latest possible date is end of phase 1) is because of the tourist who go with the hype and just want to try it out. The vast majority of those people will quit after days or weeks, after the initial rush only a fraction of all the people who started out remain, to prevent servers from being empty afterwards they use layers.
---
Is this were you will include the number of an item for 'loot' steps? For example, Im going through human warrior and section 14, step 4 says too loot Chunk of Boar Meat, but it doesnt say how many.
---
I love the utility mages have... plus dps is basically just 1 button. Would you say a mage is easier than a warlock?
---
Thats what I am doing its totally legit spec for raid healing.
---
The topic was why so many people will roll a Warrior but so few will tank. And your assumption is because they will want to pvp. Which is entirely incorrect because most warriors will roll Fury since it’s the highest dps spec in the game.
---
I concur. People, don't roll Druids. They are terrible. 
---
\^sweet sweet Druid lootz...
---
&gt; Just be thankful the crazy people didn't win the argument and we didn't just get even more people packed together.
---
This is the correct take. I haven't seen any of those "RALLY AGAINST LAYERING" posters lately come to think of it.
---
“Level 20 warrrior DPS LFG WC”
---
While you seem to paint my opinions as rash and unfounded, there is a lot to be said for what I said.
---
You seem to have the opinion that your approach is pragmatic, but tbh I don't think so. What horde and alliance have to offer, both lore and aesthetically speaking, are in fact likely to attract slightly different kinds of people. 
---
As an example, someone looking to play a character that is very "humanoid" or human looking, will be heavily inclined to play on alliance.
---
It's no coincidence, at all, that wows first expansion gave horde their most feminine and humanoid looking race, and alliance got their most brutish and least humanoid looking race.
---
Truth be told I do appreciate your train of thought. It's just I think it's clear that there are differences between the factions
---
funny, I'll use the list to roll on the streamer server... also I may just play on US because the EU streamer scene feels dead
---
Windfury for every melee, mana tide for every caster. 8 easy.
---
Nah hes decent at tanking.
---
What are you talking about? We're discussing its intended purpose, not how you can manipulate a bad system.
---
Touche.

When I played on a unofficial server I spent a month thinking of a name for my Tauren Druid, who I knew I was gonna go for an all in tank spec. I wanted bear to be somehow incorporated into the name. I saw Ursoc somewhere which I believe is the Latin name for bear. I liked that a lot but thought it was too simple. I was in my brothers room one day and saw a book of Socrates works. And then I figured it out. Ursocrates. I felt so clever. Kinda sucked at max level though. Full feral is meh in PvP compared to hybrid Druid, and even if I wanted to tank or dps in raids I wasn’t allowed cause I was too casual to bring a feral in. The name was too cool for my sucky feral Druid. So I thought I should make a more basic name for my next character since I’m a casual player who won’t be able to gear up very fast. So at first I was thinking of the name Kraig, just like Craig but with a k. Nothing fancy and the k makes it seem orcish. And then I’d just be an average warrior and not feel bad if I’m not that good haha. I was messing around on a private server and doing some testing and made typed something kinda random in my head that sounds kind of orcish and is a jumbled up common phrase. I’m very excited about it so I won’t share. But think of what you want your name to be like, perhaps something with Thex in it would be fitting and you’re going to be playing the race of our guardian. Hope that helps!
---
VuhDo? :)
---
Yep. Even korean market is falling for mobile games
---
Yes. Very much bigger.
---
No, people are insisting that layers only exist to hold this fictitious number of "2.5 or 3k" players.
---
Blizzard has not given exact numbers of population per layer, nor the number of layers being used at launch or 2 weeks into release. 
---
Layering is only implemented (going back to my original point) to allow the game to be playable by everyone with a wow sub... to assume that layers will only open up when one reaches this imaginary number is false.
---
That's how it works.
---
I guess I was thinking the late late game stuff might be more relevant since we are starting in 1.12. But yeah, you’re right about mages being fun for that AoE!
---
Thanks for the input!
---
??
---
Yea blizzard slow is like.. 85% when talented (and absolutely should be talented for this to work). If they break oddly they're crawling anyway
---
warrior main here, in classic warrior were very hard to manage and to master, reason:
---
\+ not cc
---
\+ absurdly gear dependant, even the gear quest are hard to a warrior
---
\+ not regeneration besides potions / food / bandages
---
\+ less mobility ( 2 charges in differents stances )
---
\+ need a healer in pvp, but also need a top tier weapon or their dmg is very low
---
\+ cant bypass armor, so the plates are a pain
---
\+ uberkitteables
---
\+ dance stance, is a cool mechanic but need a lot of hands
---
\+ the best dmg abilitie in each aspect are in top tier on the abilitie tree ( shield slam, mortal strike, bloodthirst )
---
\+ fury need a lot of gear since is 2 one hand weapons
---
\+ protection dont have mechanics to deal with direct magic dmg or autohealing mechanic
---
\+ the gearing is very important, also the stat customization, a few points less in the hit cap make you have a lot of less threat or loss a lot of dps as fury, there is no mastery or versatility so in general warrior feel a little squishy
---
\+ In a group you can take advantage of a lot of buff ( like windfury ) and shine since you dont need mana or energy, but in solo is very hard to manage, specially with the fact that double specialization dont exist, so past lvl 15 if you choose protection, lvl is very very slow
---
Orc is way better than dwarf, but pick what you like in the end.
---
I have to say that I hope you are wrong too. People where concerned that they will make to many layers and the launch day experience will get lost, since this is what could be seen on the beta. In a recent eurogamer interview they confirmed layers in the beta were only as small as they were because of testing reasons and that a layer will have the population of a vanilla realm.

TL;DR. MMORPG's as we love and know it is dead, and the market only allows developers to make MMORPG's with microtransactions.
---
  If you want subscribers to a game you need "the casuals", the big mass of players that doesn't hit endgame or barely play for more than the level cap.   
---
  These casuals needs to be lulled into subscribtion by the current hype, clever advertisement and/or good looking graphics, and this has always been the case. 
---
  They are the thousands of players that doesn't really "play" the game, they are the passerby that just came along for the hypetrain and support the developers so they can keep the hypetrain going by making more content and/or new expansions. 
---
Look at games like LoL, Fortnite, Candy Crush and to some extend Counter Strike, these games all have a few things in common, super hyped, decent looking, not needing a $1000+ device to play and most importantly they are "free". 
---
  These games are designed to hog this big mass of casuals with micro transactions, clever advertisement and regular updates. 
---
  The market simply does not allow for the risk of making  big investments in game types like MMORPG's that doesn't support microtransactions.
---
I believe MMORPG's as we now it is dead, the next big MMORPG-like experience has to offer something very new, dazzling and unique to lure this casual mass back into a subscription-based format. 
---
  Maybe a VR+treadmill game with vastly improved tech; no noticeable latency between movement and response, etc.
---
Anyone have this shot in high quality for an ultra wide monitor?

Except the tanks get the dps plate gear first in good guilds
---
Neither. They're simply [discontinued](https://www.wowhead.com/news=294120/blizzard-no-longer-manufactures-physical-authenticators). So they'll still work as long as your current one has power, but after that it's the phone app.
---
You'll be [Gravy from Flintlocke vs the Horde.](http://flintlockevshorde.thecomicseries.com/comics/3)
---
Each layer has 3000 people in it. There are 6 starting zones across both factions. 3000/6=500. Therefore if it is a full layer and all zones are distributed evenly on launch, there will be 500 in each zone. Of course the less popular races like Tauren will probably have less and more popular like orc/troll will have more.
---
Maybe you guys don't understand the difference between #of servers and layers.
---
Oh well it wont affect you guys anyway! Have fun, ignorance is bliss I suppose.
---
You will be totally fine. You have plenty of tank/healing. Your dps won’t be too bad. The only real con I see is you all wear leather gear. 
---
One Druid go tank, the other heal. Have the shaman off tank with enhancement or go ele for more dmg. 
---
You will be fine in all the dungeons. Don’t pay much attention to min maxers
---
But then how do you strike the balance between people who want a challenge because they are clearing mythic before most average guilds clear heroic, and the people that don't give a flying fuck about anything except what happened to aszhara in the new raid? One difficulty fits all is cool in theory but unfortunately if people can't muster up the 3 brain cells to clear the raid then they complain, because its too hard and I dont want to google the lore etc etc. Conversely, if that one difficulty is too easy, then it becomes a snorefest for competitive players like myself that want a challenge and not just an allocated nap period 3 times a week. 
---
Believe me when I say that if they had one raid difficulty and people actually had to use their brain to clear it, that would be fantastic in an ideal worls. Forcing people to step up and get better, but people dont want to get better because putting in any effort to not stand in fire is elitist.
---
Hell yeah. Fury for life.
---
I never made the claim that gear ever mattered. I simply refuted the one that 1-59 gear does.

---
I still have my luffa in the bank T_T
---
I would say so yes, I've never played lock though.
---
I feel like Zenimax struck a good balance with ESO wrt monetization.  Not at launch certainly when you *had* to pay the monthly fee, whereas now you just *want* to pay the monthly fee.  Then they get a mark for having scaling so you as more content gets added it just means theres more to do without invalidating all the old stuff.  Whereas with wow you only do dungeons for the latest expacs, and only do the most recent raid tier, and have more limited options for leveling while zoning.  That said, I'm still ditching ESO+ for Classic in a few weeks.
---
Get in the habit of using middle mouse click.  
---
Middle mouse click also closes tabs.
---
Logical, thanks!
---
Yes, of course they can.
---
Regardless, the entire point of layering is for it to be separate from sharding - in that it creates a full, consistent realm experience per layer contrary to the dynamic, jarring phasing in and out that comes with sharding. If it was "manipulated" to fluctuate during classic, it would not serve its advertised purpose.
---

I leveled the same in vanilla. Non-warrior friends thought I was nuts for taking herb/alch and not getting an early start on engi or at least bs. They really had no idea.
---
Specifically it allows you to read multiple class and race specific steps at once to direct your leveling group as you go. It also adjusts for the XP losses suffered by grouping compared to solo. Grouping obviously reduces XP gained when doing kill quests and grinding mobs. That difference in experience has to be accounted for to make sure everyone is at the same pace through the leveling experience.
---
Does anyone know if we can use the Twitch app to download add-ons for classic? I tried but it doesnt seem to work and the twitch app doesnt separate retail from classic.
---
Literally the best thing about Cata was the launch. Took me 3 hours to realize that I had barely lagged at all, and I was on a high pop server. That was a fun couple days.
---
Yea i asked what you think makes wow great...Lets see is there anything in there that's not just shit talking all the points i made hmmmm nope.
---
This is actually so genius and yet obvious...dunno why it didn't occur to me lol
---
I played Diablo 2 and loved the Amazon, but having a gun was even cooler, so I rolled a hunter.
---
I've considered it. I'm not too worried about the whole "you have to be a dwarf priest" thing. That and Dwarves look stupid.
---
Uhm it says, 4k wants to be warrior, and 3.3k wants to be a tank, maybe some druids and pala's and stoned shammy's in there but still way to high for raiding.
---
I mean yeah, warrior leveling is harder than some classes but I think that it's fine, as long as you play with a brain!
---
Added on BNet
---
Hmm. Well okay then!
---
Old armor looks bad?  Some of it does, but almost all of my mogs are built around Vanilla/BC chest pieces.
---
Hahahahaha, this.. *sad trombone*
---
Yes I completely agree. WotF really shines when you get caught by a fear in battle or defensive stance but other than that it just feels like a "win-more" racial for warriors. From a PvP perspective I do like Cannibalize as well as the shadow resistance (feels really good when you resist a warlocks death coil) but compared to orc racials its kinda "meh".
---
The other thing is. If your not pvping.  You can do your one or two raids a week. There is nothing you can really do solo over wise after you are past your five man gear stage.

---
Yeah my bad, thinking only about us muricans, my bad europe
---
I'll fully admit to being an elitist, but being first on your realm for example doesn't have to be competitive against others. You can view it as self improvement. Seeing yourself get better logs over the course of the tier as you improve, pushing for a higher world rank with your guild in the next tier. Competing against yourselves so to speak. Maybe it's just somebody pushing themself to get better and clear heroic. It only becomes competitive if you want it to be competitive.
---
Priest, definitely not at low levels with bad gear. Hunters have dead zone, and paladin will have blessing of freedom. Mage is the unknown factor due to some very skilled mages being extremely OP, polymorph essentially taking one person out of the fight. Warrior + paladin, rogue + paladin and hunter + paladin was very much powerhouse duo combo in PvP.
---
I played both paladin and shaman back in vanilla to 60, and 1v1 paladin will generally take out the shaman, while the same is not true the other way around.
---
All of this is moot though because we are for sure rolling on a PvE server. We have two kids that we're going to try to teach to fish for us. :) Don't want them getting ganked and swearing off the game forever.

&gt;When you mention it being absurd, do you mean it in a good way? Like once they get gear at 60, they are absurd? And do you just mean it for like raids, dungeons, or pvp? How about on soloing and farming?
---
This ended up quite long but I'll give you my 2 cents on Warriors and explain a few of the mechanics that makes them scale so well. 
---
\#1 - As you level in Vanilla your abilities do more damage. This is the case for all classes.  
---
\#2 - Warriors need rage to use their abilities.  
---
\#3 - Rage is generated by taking or doing damage. The more damage the more rage generated. 
---
So, as Warriors level and get better gear they do more damage which in turn generates more rage which allows them to use their skills more often. They're the only class in the game that scales this way and they become godly at max level with top end gear because of it. 
---
Realistically it's slow to level on your own unless you have gold to buy AH gear upgrades every so often. Warriors have no healing so soloing tough mobs is out of the question and you'll need First Aid/Cooking to keep your downtime minimal. If you don't you'll have to sit and eat after every single mob. Warriors is best leveled with a partner/group or as an Alt once you have $$ to gear it as it levels. 
---
To gear a DPS Warrior @ 60. Tank. I know that sounds counter intuitive but it works very well. In Vanilla/Classic Prot Warriors are in such high demand that you'll be able to demand priority on off-spec gear and most groups will accept that just to get you to come. Using tanking to build a DPS set and then switch over if you don't want to tank anymore. Once you have a good 60+ DPS set you'll be a top raid DPS contender and will have no problem finding groups for the rest of the vanilla content. There is also no way to avoid tanking as a Warrior. You WILL be asked to off-tank at some point so the best bet is to commit right at 60, learn the basics and get an OK prot set going, build out that DPS set and switch over. At that point you've got the spec you want to play, you've built up some decent prot gear and you've learned the basics of tanking in a easier environment (5-mans, Ony, etc.) Doing it this way will set you up to be a huge part of all Classic content. Warriors are the lynchpin class and if you can play both DPS/Tank well you'll always be the most important person in every group or guild. Enjoy!
---
Ah gotcha
---
Sadly so :/
---
That’s how I took it.
---
Shadow is nice, put em in tank group in raids, for heals. The 15% shadowdmg boost for warlocks is awesome to.
---
just under 5 gigs

I mean, he has a point for a big portion of us.  It's anywhere from 11am to 2pm start time in mainland US.   I can't make that start time, but it's easy to make that time if you're EU.  I'll be working for the first 4 hours of that, so I won't help stress test anything of note.
---
Is the client available for download?
---
Really interested to see how you guys implement this with multi-class groups, especially priests who [have to go back tho their racial capitals](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cmfwmk/question_about_leveling_with_a_friend/ew24o8x/).
---
&gt;Regardless, the entire point of layering is for it to be separate from sharding - in that it creates a full, consistent realm experience per layer contrary to the dynamic, jarring phasing in and out that comes with sharding. If it was "manipulated" to fluctuate during classic, it would not serve its advertised purpose.
---
Wrong - they had to create layering instead of sharding because people like to be literal and would cry to their mothers about "no sharding" layering is sharding... just not a zone by zone instance - again to think that blizzard would say " we are going to have X amount of servers and then set pop cap to XX amount, and ONLY when the layer reaches that number will a new layer be turned on" that's just setting themselves up for a headache and anyone who thinks that blizzard is going to have 500 players per starting zone day one is just being ignorant.
---
Honestly? I literally just start typing and see what shit comes out.
---
X.... Xi? Xin, Xin something yeah, good start.
---
Mits.... Mits something... MITTENS. Mits...... Kitten mittens, are those a thing? FOCUS.
---
T....Do I want a T name? Te.... Telly? Telm. Tem. Temin. Tembi? Kembi? Temble? Thimble? Wtf even is a thimble I forget..... Oh right names.
---
This is just a few examples of the thought process I go through when I'm writing random shit in that tiny name box.
---
Wait, wasn't Rexxar introduced to WoW in TBC?
---
If not, please tell me the region he's in and if he's faction restricted.  His WC3 bonus campaign was a very entertaining and unique experience.
---
It is easy to be a decent healing and support paladin, yes.
---
Outtapocket.
---
&gt;Only FF14 brought back the genre to it's glory when they remake it from the ground up.
---
--
---
&gt;fucked up the the uniqueness of classes, having the possibility of being everything in one character
---
[raised eyebrow emoji]

You do you ^^^how ^^^I ^^^want ^^^you ^^^to ^^^do ^^^you
---
Yeah enjoy being ignorant - thinking they would use the same numbers as 15 years ago when you
---
A. Haven't watched the interviews 
---
B. Don't understand layering
---
Have fun with fortnite after you quit 2 months into classic.
---
PDT is just the summer version of PST afaik
---
Pserver levelling is also the mythic version of levelling. its much easier on classic
---
I see your tricks, you want MY treasure chest...nice try! I will be the first!!!
---
As warrior, you’ll have to mostly rely on your gear to get you through battle.  You have the opportunity to outplay warlocks, priests, and rogues and hunters to some extent, but smart druids, paladins, and mages will pretty much always wipe the floor with you. 
---
It’s still a blast - especially AV when you can charge into a group and intimidating shout - healers have a hidden instinct to pocket heal you if you’re being effective at your job.
---
Nice. I belong in this subreddit.
---
This comp defeats all odds. Baffled!
---
They were separate AHs, so people only ever used the IF one.
---
They can have a very high skill ceiling, but the difference between just playing and min/maxing in your play style/rotations is lower for hunters than most other classes.
---
Edit: in my opinion
---
I wasn't able to recreate the exact request, as i never got the  CLFR02 error, but i was able to record a request to the zengine db update service.  I hope this will give you the information you are looking for.

You be lucky to get one mob every 30 minutes
---
And frankly I can't WAIT
---
Great combo. Couldn't get much better and you will only ever have to find 3 DPS for dungeons, with no loot sharing
---
jokes on you! ill be buying skins for +50c sell price. People will flock to me!!!

What timezone are you in?

---
I wager Darnassus was as empty and forlorn an AH as Gadgetzan.
---
I think a smaller, non-epic MMO could work fine. Something with a theme similar to TF2: Red vs Blu, no real complicated story, no gigantic world that contains tons of zones you never revisit after you out level them (wtf is Loch Modan, Redridge, Westfall, etc.).
---
What ultimately keeps people playing is new content : new raids, new BGs, new arena seasons.
---
Step 20 for tauren warrior - Teleport to moonglade?
---
Thanks, this helped alleviate some of the anxiety I was getting thinking about how crowded it will be.  You're right, its no marathon, and eventually it'll get much more stable (ie less fighting for spawns) :D
---
They said their plan was to only use it for the first couple weeks but that they will absolutely not have it past the first month.  But if that's true it will still be a painful transition after 2 weeks.
---
where did they say that?
---
What do you mean? 
---
You said:
---
Retail has that now if not more so? 
---
Time spent gives the impression of worth, which is good for some. 
---
Personally, I get satisfaction out of defeating difficult content for my gear / rewards. That is not something that Classic has but what Retail offers in multiple avenues. 
---
Couldn't really comment since this didn't really make sense to me. 
---
This is more of a thing in retail than in Classic. There's no world pvp in Classic and it only existed organically because there was nothing else to do. 
---
A hammer will of course see everything as a nail.
---
This should be the top voted comment.
---
Apart from the fact that it's a security risk to download random files from random people, it's also rather pointless, even if OP has the best intentions. You save 30 secs but then you have to figure out wtf you downloaded, find the pages of the authors (where you should have been in the first place) for guides, then delete the add-ons you don't want.
---
Download the add-ons from the creator's page. Faster and safer.
---
It's not a macro, it's an unbound keybind setting.
---
Yep, I'm pretty sure I remember standing in Org, next to the ring of portals and a little system message popped up saying something like "World of Warcraft Cataclysm is now live" and we could start the trek to 85.
---
Why does that Attack Table article talk about level 80's?  I don't know why, but something about that tells me it's not Vanilla based.  Maybe there's some other explanation?
---
dont forget the poop knife attachment for the bucket
---
where though? on the blue post it just says "Our global pre-launch test of WoW Classic will begin on Thursday, 8  August at 20:00 CEST and is scheduled to end on Friday, August 9. "
---
He says that, but he's clearly wielding a 2h hammer.
---
“Aww yea, I got this with 10% health to sp- oh shit he’s running, hamstrung but can’t...get...him.. fast.. eno-“
---
“Rwlrwlrwlrwlrwl”
---
“Aaargh...” *writes Aaargh to mark his death*
---
I mean when leveling is a month(s) long quest to 60, I don't think starting at 60 is a "much better gauge" for what the gameplay will be like.
---
In PvP, there's a lot of skill and nuance to any class if you want to consistently win. In pve, it's truly not that big of a deal. Almost every class has an easy rotation, and even if you're not perfecting it, pulling aggro is a big issue and at least you won't be doing that.
---
Classic just makes me want to also relive Guild Wars 1 all over again too
---
That IMO was one of the only few that got close, if not better in some aspects
---
I went Dwarf hunter because of this scene, its also the scene that made me notice the game.
---
A backend error leaked through. We have since fixed that and it will be live on the next data push.
---
We've seen it time and time again. Being on Fel makes you swole. Do they really gotta spell it out for you?
---
Ofcourse warriors want it. It's a sick pvp weapon.
---
Just playing word games now.
---
In my case, she had interest in wow being a gamer and all, but there was always someone there to tell her the game wasnt the same, wait for classic, play private servers, etc. Well, classic is here now!
---
No problem! Helps me with my CHS (Classic Hype Syndrome). 
---
That sounds like a great plan though. I'd personally focus on Prot as soon as you realistically can. Tanking is a lot more involved than anything else in this game and takes the longest to master. While you're getting good at that you'll be getting more than enough gear for both of your specs. When you do eventually switch you'll already know how to tank the bosses, how to position yourself and that will make you shine as a melee DPS class. Once you're there respeccing is a joke because you'll be rich. If you're not just offer your tanking services for $$ and after a run or two respec and go murder kids in PvP lol
---
Roll Alliance.
---
I'm contemplating making a training routine while playing. Everytime there is mandatory wait time from flightpaths, drinking/eating, waiting for spawns and long auto-runs.
---
Push-ups are easy to do in between the short breaks. Maybe some stretches might be good on the longer ones.
---
Given that his answer wasn't scripted, it's entirely possible he made a mistake.
---
"EXECUTE! EXECUTE GODDAMN YOU!"
---
"Not Enough Rage"
---
"FUCK YOU!"
---
It is? I’ve heard warriors would be better off going dual wield.
---
Thanks for the reply! There is much more coming. This was a bit rushed out so we can have something available for the stress test tomorrow. Should be much more fully fledged out with saving and other useability addons
---
It was a goofy thing i came up with that just doesnt stop making people smile
---
This tbh
---
Mobile gaming and MTX has killed the industry. And it's just not going to recover. Why would it? They make 100x more for half the effort
---
Ahh I will bathe in tears of those ppl that will go on and cry on forums how hard classic leveling is.  
---
Hey! Atleast you have community right? kappa
---
Yes we deserved to be quarantined.
