glad you like that. i will likely make a post about it timorrow. link scents to memory and eventually nostalgia.

---
Y'know what I hate? How much thorium.
---
I would love to see how this pans out in 2019. Because I agree with your point. 2005 pib would never have rolled on one of those fresh servers. After all I am losing way too much work. That being said 2019 pib. Would be super happy for a fresh realm a year in. Fresh realms are the best part of classic.
---
But then the Dwarf only guilds aren't exclusive anymore :\*(
---
My God you'd be jacked by the time you hit 60 on a pvp server. Hell, you'd be in pretty solid shape even on a pve server, lol
---
There are a bunch of outhouses in the game.
---
&gt; I personally don’t like playing humans in a fantasy game.
---

---
Why not?
---
&gt;  It really doesn’t effect you at all. 
---
It *affects* everyone you're playing with though.
---
&gt;&gt; Or healed any instance without being full restoration or holy?
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Only with friends.
---
That's an asshole thing to do, why would you slight your friends?
---
CPUs arent important? I doubled my FPS with a CPU change. 
---
Best part of being a Rogue on a PvP server is sitting in stealth and trying to decide if you can burst a target down or whether they'll escape/make a fight out of it.
---
sure maybe in like chess or dota or some other game where skill might actually play a part.
---
Vanilla wow is hella easy.  My main tank through BWL was a keyboard turner.
---
Because I’m playing a fantasy game.  If I wanted to play a human I’d go outside.
---
Because I knew all my friends were okay with it and doing the same thing?
---
Much better interface customization (meaning click-drag movement for windows, enlarging one frame but not others).
---
Cooldown timers on icons toggle on/off via interface.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Honestly mate 90% are agreeing that min max is not necessary, and there are posts seemingly every day praising your right to do whatever you want in the game. So just ignore the few people you don't like, instead of getting your panties in a twist and hating people who want to play a game hardcore.
---
"Witness a Chuck Norris joke in general chat - 20 situps"  
---
FUCK DUDE, I'M ONLY HUMAN.
---
So why don't you have that same expectation of strangers?
---
Nobody's trying to govern anyone, until you try to get a spot in MY raid and then I reserve the right to scrutinize you thoroughly.

Regardless of what gloves he is wearing, whatever he types (such as chat, emote, etc) is more epic than any BiS glove.  Basically he doesn't need BiS items to be the best.
---
Blizzard forced that role on the class by making dps Paladin simply awful. Blame them.
---
So the fact that when you open your character sheet it says "Human" instead of "Gnome" is somehow going to hurt your experience playing the game? That's pretty silly.
---
&gt; My main tank through BWL was a keyboard turner.
---
and your tank in naxx?
---
I 100% agree too, even though I am a sweaty hardcore as you would say, please play the game! It's the community that makes the game so special, let us week 1 rag kill guilds not inhibit your play experience.
---
Many people will roll druid in the beginning but they will fade away when you get higher level. At 60 there won't be that many. 
---
If you ever googled a spreadsheet to decide that piece of gear you wanted to upgrade next, you are a neckbeard shitlord and your min-maxing is oppressing me!!!
---
I admit I am morbidly curious about how long you will stay on the hook even if I stop posting. I am hoping for more insults, followed up ten minutes later with a demand for a response, and if I am really lucky a third post days later after everyone else has moved on proclaiming that this has been a personal victory for you.
---
There's some addons that people are going to use that give a big advantage in PvP that should be an option you can toggle in interface by default.
---
For example:
---
1) Enemy Cast Bar - Yeah there's no enemy castbar in vanilla. You have to get an addon to do this. So long as such an addon works, it's a much disadvantage not to have this (though I recognize if blizzard can prevent such an addon from working, that would also level the playing field).
---
2) Autodismount - In Vanilla, you hold to manually dispell your mounted buff (or recast or reuse the item). If you didn't, and tried to use a spell, it would prevent you and bring up the "can't do that" message. But there's addons that will cause you to dismount automatically when you cast a spell or try to otherwise attack somebody.
---
Then there's still that lazypig offers that would be cool to have as a toggle:
---
1) Auto-repair and auto-sell greys to vendors
---
2) Auto accept (or decline) certain group invitations, BG queues, summons
---
The whole game is going to basically be a mashup of new and old. IIRC it's the modern engine being fed old textures and restored animations and lighting to be as close to Vanilla as possible.
---
However, it seems like certain things they made a point to keep like the modern water effects. Not sure of the reason, maybe they just think it's an objectively better design. But for these they built a "Classic" toggle (in the demo at least) that adjusts them to look like Vanilla if that's what you prefer.

**&lt;After Dark&gt; Alliance NA - PvE**
---
**Raid Time:** Monday &amp; Wednesday 12:00 AM CT (midnight) and Sunday 7:00 PM CT. **Subject to change upon discussion.**
---
**About:** &lt;After Dark&gt; is a semi-hardcore raiding guild. It will be on a PvP server, because what is vanilla without PvP. It is open to everyone. English is the primary language. I am a busy adult that works 2nd shift. It has been hard to find a raiding guild on current WoW with my schedule. I'm sure a lot of you are in this same boat. This is our chance to experience Classic WoW, while still holding a second shift job. We may be few and far between, so we must come together as **night owls!**
---
**Goal:** My goal is to bring everyone together with a late night schedule. We will be able to **form dungeon groups, raid, and PvP, late at night.**
---
**Expectations:** I expect **you** to be somewhat respectful. But, if you do something **stupid,** you will get **flamed.** But, leave our mothers out of it. Or not. Oh yeah, we **will** be downing **Kel' Thuzad**.
---
**Extra Info:** I am not expecting to be the guild leader, but I can be. I will organize raids and other events, if so. I will promote a select number of **officers**. I do not have extreme Vanilla WoW knowledge, as I only hit level 30 in vanilla. I have played private servers and know the Molten Core mechanics. Again, it was hard to raid with my late night schedule. **If you have excessive Vanilla experience, or raiding leading experience in general, then DM me.**
---
**Discord:** https://discord.gg/fua5p6f
---
**Let's get it**
---
if I actually like the people I'm raiding with I tend to want content to last longer anyways. I've done MC in under an hour, the "rushing through content to get good clear times" thing is overrated AF, as long as we're clearing each week we're still getting the same drops as the guys who do it in half an hour but spending more time bonding and having fun.
---
I do assume most people share that mindset, but as you have no way of knowing you should be polite to random people you play with.
---
I'm curious when BFAs finial patch is, I bet they use the Classic release as a means to float on until the next retail expansion lands. 
---
After I asked I went and found it, thank you
---
Well part of this case to do with warriors having stronger mechanics in 1.12 as compared to earlier parts of the game.
---
Is this the only way you can feel like you have control in your life? Convincing strangers on the internet you're stupid?
---
Who the hell advertises a dire maul run without specifying a wing?
---
Yup, I agree
---
Don’t release it early because you overestimated how soon it could be ready! 
---
Great meme. 10/10.
---
Not a chance in hell that sort of language will be tolerated.
---
A few more graveyards.
---
I think some people are just very insecure/nervous/anxious/whatever about getting into raiding at 60 (as if even 3/4 of players make it there lol), and see things like those monster huge forum post guides full of numbers/data from pserver players that only makes it worse, so they complain about the min-max hardcore raiders to feel better about how their own playstyle.  Then it just becomes a trend on Reddit because the hivemind always has trends.
---
 I'm also one of those people who finds those guides about perfecting your character intimidating too, but that doesn't mean I tear down the people into that.
---
We don't really fully know how macro's are gonna work, probably retail-like but honestly it's not really something you should worry about before we get more information
---
I think one of the biggest misconception of wow vanilla is that the raids are easy, therefor min maxing is seen as elitist. If you think wow vanilla is easy, then you are else an elite or misinformed. The truth is that casual guilds are not gonna progress much and the less you try to min-max, the less you're going to progress. The last post about having fun had good points but in my experience, the type of guilds that are so casual, that they will take any class/spec and won't care at all about min-maxing will not progress much, maybe not even raid at all or even worst, end up disbanding because of the lack of players/progression.
---
Those type of guilds can survive in official wow because of 10 man raids. You can play with a bunch of friends and not care about progressing, just having fun. I've been in those type of guilds and i had a lot of fun. But 40 mans are completely different. Just getting 40 man together is a hard task in itself. When people start realizing that raiding in wow vanilla is not as easy as they thought, a lot more people are gonna start min-maxing and that's when you're gonna see people leave the super casual guilds for guilds that at least put some effort in trying to progress. 
---
I can't wait for people to get into MC, wipe on the aoe goblins on the way to magmadar, finally getting through it, dying on the packs that you need to kill all at the same time, then dying on magmadar and realizing that the packs have respawned...
---
Weren't you also baffled as to how people could have fun playing suboptimal specs?
---
And you literally just admitted to doing it? Why would you do it if it wasn't fun? How do you quantify playing a suboptimal spec?
---
If you agree that most people share that mindset, then by default that makes it the majority and default mindset. Why should the majority have to signal out that they're apart of the majority? Why is the onus on them to stipulate that they share the same mindset as the majority of the player base?
---
I still remember one dude who was trying to get a holy priest to heal him in Wailing Caverns. He didn't want anyone with points in shadow because he had heard they were bad at healing.
---
Yes it will.  Why does it bother you?  Just don’t group with any rogue that’s not a human.  
---
And honestly I was just using a gnome rogue as an example.  You should play what you want to play and just know that means you might not get into every group/raid/guild you want.  But I raided with tons of gnome rogues and we did just fine in raids.  Got all the way through aq40 with gnome rogues!!! It’s crazy!!!!
---
I’ll personally be playing a UD priest because I like healing and spriest is a lot of fun in PvP.
---
Just a simple taunt, nothing more.
---
Oh i thought the young turks became a wow classic channel or something.
---
Omg, the sit-ups...... Oh God no
---
You've made the classic (Classic?) error of thinking people prioritize the things you do.  There are going to be PLENTY of hunters out there.

Thank you!
---
Hunters are great at solo, and a lot of people make hunter alts for farming or some such.
---
A very valid concern, which is why so many people want Blizzard to release a server list prior to launch. 
---
As an Oceanic player, our choices might be a little more limited as we probably won't be getting as many servers to choose from. 
---
I think it is too early to look into server communities and guilds, but if you are then good on you for getting a headstart. I think this kind of stuff will ramp up one or two months out - which isn't really that long now when I look at the calendar!
---
I've seen some pservers where the songflower could be simultaneously clicked by multiple people.
---
On another pserver the songflower just had like 15 second respawn time so each player could buff themselves one at a time rather quickly.
---
&gt; here's nothing wrong with ANY way you choose to play 
---
Well, there are wrong ways to play in some sense because WoW is in some cases a team game. If a mage in a 5-toon instance dungeon starts every pull with a Blizzard or a tank only ever targets one mob while letting the rest run loose they are doing something badly wrong.
---
If you play badly solo you aren't hurting anybody, but MMORPGs aren't entirely solo games.
---
But why should anyone care?
---
Lol yeah because that would work
---
Do literally the opposite and the result is the same tho.
---
Yea thats what im thinking, playing is the best way to find a community, i've been trying to hold off on some of these guild recruitment posts for this reason.
---
Druid because it's always druid.  
---
Also to be fair you have to combine paladin and shaman into 1 class.  
---
So many good memes
---
NA, active from 6:30 to 9pm CST.  Haven’t picked horde or alliance just yet.  Probably don’t have enough time to raid, but I’d like to part of a solid group.  I loved BC because I had the best guild at that point.  I’m in it for friendships formed.
---
I like to tank , so I might be a warrior.  I just like to pitch in and help with quests, dungeons, and stupid jokes.
---
Thanks for checking my post out.  -will

In another thread this guy is literally arguing that anyone who does not min/max is a disrespectful asshole

&gt; Weren't you also baffled as to how people could have fun playing suboptimal specs?
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; And you literally just admitted to doing it?
---
I was baffled as to how they could find it more enjoyable than playing a proper spec yes.
---
&gt; Why would you do it if it wasn't fun?
---
Because the downside to respeccing back and forth for all 5 of us was greater than the upside of doing it.
---
Also, it was fun, just not as fun as it could've been had we all been specced properly.
---
&gt; Why should the majority have to signal out that they're apart of the majority?
---
Because you should be polite to random people and just because someone is probably okay with it being one way it does not mean you should assume it's that way when there's no downside to not assuming it.
---
No, they don't. Horde warriors will deal more raw DPS at all tiers of content.
---
However, if you pull aggro off WF procs and die and lose your world buffs, you will do significantly less DPS. Horde warriors do have to deal with real threat problems, and it starts to lead to horde tanks raiding with creative specs (partial or full fury) just to keep up with threat.
---
&gt; So just ignore the few people you don't like, instead of getting your panties in a twist and hating people who want to play a game hardcore.
---
Way to feel attacked.
---
I like to min-max to certain degrees too, but I'm not here posting how non min-maxers are choosing to be bad, trolling every other person in the raid or comparing them to afk players.
---
And I'm pretty sure you aren't doing that stuff either.
---
as important*, as in the way I would parse my spending dollars would go into a GPU&gt;RAM&gt;CPU waterfall
---
See that's strange to me because I found that Druid gets more and more fun as you level up.
---
At level 10 you get bear form, and can start having some fun with that.
---
In your late teens you can start healing dungeons. 
---
At level 20 you get cat form and levelling becomes much easier. You're also able to start tanking dungeons in bear form. 
---
By level 21 you can have 2 points in feline swiftness and can try your luck at flag running. You'll be too squishy usually, but between feline swiftness and dash you can make complete runs more often than most, and from then on whenever you're bored of levelling you can pop back into WSG. 
---
At level 29 you're a god of WSG so you might as well have some fun in there. 
---
At level 30 you get travel form, which adds even more fun to the game.
---
And from there it basically gets better whether you want to tank dungeons, run flags (until 40 when people start getting mounts), heal dungeons, dps dungeons, or quest. 
---
But I guess I'm a bit biased so maybe I'm seeing it through rose-colored glasses. 
---
No

You're too low for Dire Maul.
---
Most pservers have buffed boss armor. People are going to be shocked at how much damage melee are doing in Classic.
---
&gt; DKP (capitalism) than loot counsel (communism).
---
Actually DKP is communism when everyone get the same salary.
---
The taxi driver have the same salary as the doctor so after a while the doctor will move.
---
Haha that sounds horrible and cringey but I empathise so strongly.
---
If you're in Stormwind, it's all anal jokes.
---
Thanks for the laugh lol
---
Most pservers have buffed boss armor. People are going to be shocked at how much damage rogues &amp; warriors are doing in Classic.
---
&gt; There's a dude on here, /u/awesometographer, that plays a paladin and has an INSANE guide for leveling one at super quick speed. If you do some planning, it can speed things up. You should look his guide/spreadsheet up if you're interested in paladin things.
---
I hear that dude's an asshole that plays the game wrong.
---
Anytime! :D
---
Just my 2 cents - you could always just focus 100% on eating at a caloric deficit to lose weight. Don’t need to go outside to jog, go to the gym or anything fancy. Just eat way less and the weight will fall off 
---
This is awesome! I love the detail, especially on the building layout in Andorhal.
---
As a n00b dwarf hunter I really loved to explore (probably why it took me so long to level). 
---
Learnt my lesson as my passion for exploration changed the day I got stuck and lost in darnassus for like 3 Days!! The endless walking around I am surprised I was not the most athletic dwarf there was. 
---
I remember logging in each time thinking FML. Day 3 I just did the /cry emote repeatedly by the bank until a kind person reminded me to use my hearthstone.. 
---
I am sure my story gave that person a laugh as they gave me 1 gold!! Probably for sympathy but I was certainly very grateful indeed!! 
---
 Straight after that I took my ass back to Dun Morogh and stayed put lmao. 
---
Yeah, I definitely hope there's rebalancing in Classic. Frozen 1.12 talents/spells/mechanics with accurate boss numbers is going to make the game significantly undertuned (both in terms of what you would want for a good game, and also in terms of how it compares to actual vanilla). 
---
I don't know how classic will work, but on the pserver I played recently, Mocking Blow wasn't a true taunt. It didn't set your threat to the top of the table, just made the boss attack you for 6 seconds. So when the Mocking Blow ended, the boss would go back to attacking whoever had the highest threat, which was usually the other tank. If they hadn't dropped their stacks yet, you could be in trouble.
---
How far can a warrior reasonably tank dungeons without being prot spec?
---
Obviously as a raid tank you'll be prot and doing things like Deadmines/Gnomer it doesn't matter.  But what about say, Uldaman/Maurodon/BRD or the endgame dungeons (Strat, Scholo, and BRS/Dire Maul)
---
Is it feasible to tank them with no prot talents in good blues or is it like a "Be prot or have T2 quality gear" situation.  
---
Thanks! I can't take too much credit though. Inkarnate did most of the drawing and asset material. If you want to check it out go visit their website! [https://inkarnate.com](https://inkarnate.com)
---
That’s a druid rite of passage my dude! What self respecting druid didn’t do that?
---
Two shaman, warlock, 2 warriors. Two groups of this. Can get agi and str/stoneskin baby.
---
&gt;Because you should be polite to random people and just because someone is probably okay with it being one way it does not mean you should assume it's that way when there's no downside to not assuming it.
---
Seeing as you're in the minority, you should be the polite one to stipulate your standards before you begin. You're one of the few expecting people not to maximize a game for their personal enjoyment.
---
&gt;Because the downside to respeccing back and forth for all 5 of us was greater than the upside of doing it.
---
So you're saying it was more... enjoyable? Interesting. When other people choose to maximize the game for their enjoyment, they are assholes.
---
Also, didn't you say this? 
---
&gt;just because you find someone hungry enough to eat shit doesn't make it okay for your to serve them that.
---
So you are your friends were hungry enough to eat shit, but by your logic it doesn't make it okay for you to serve each other that. You literally used this as a reason to not play suboptimal builds even if people expect it and implicitly accept it. Yet you do it. You're coming off as bit of a hypocrite here.
---
You are even more clueless if you think raids wipe because there were rets or moonkins in it. But whatever you are helpless at that point.
---
I don't see what's hard to understand about that. You aren't a caster because you don't cast spells with a cast time (aside from on the pull). But even then, most of the damage you deal is magic-based.
---
If you have ever leveled up a Shaman, then you know that the limiting factor in how fast you level up is not how fast you kill things. You can kill things very fast if you want to. But you will run out of mana and need to drink. The early talents in the Elemental tree will make your mana pool last longer and let you kill more mobs before you need to drink. 
---
As an added bonus, the Elemental tree has better survivability talents. Notably, Eye of the Storm allows you to heal uninterrupted every time it procs. You can solo harder quests as Elemental.
---
On my most recent pserver if you knew you were going to pull aggro (thanks to the modern innovation of relatively accurate threat meters), you could just walk in front of the boss and eat a single wing buffet, then go back to your safe position. This was mostly only necessary for melee, who happened to be in the best position to do it.
---
The upgraded CPU was twice the price of my RAM. My RAM isnt the bottleneck either. Like I said, a CPU upgrade doubled my FPS. Same GPU and RAM.
---
You know what I mean. Aside from that playing as a villian or someone who does their worst to troll other players is also a valid style of play, it's just one that will get them ostracized from groups pretty quickly!
---

I would personally love balancing. Especially MC and BWL are a joke with 1.12 talents, 1.10 itemization and player knowledge. But I think the #nochanges crowd would absolutely riot and the game would fragment.
---
But like I said people are also going to be shocked at how easy content is... there's quite a vocal crowd of people who never touched a "pirate server" constantly claiming how easy and bugged they are... they are in for a rude awakening when they get to MC.
---
can u make some alliance ones :)
---
Butters disappears for like 5-6 episodes and no one notices till like the 5th episode and it turns out he was in his room playing Classic the whole time.
---
Hey, I would be interested in a guild similar to yours. Where do I sign up? 
---
We had threat meters at the time, but they were inaccurate and I was the first week of BWL that we got to Firemaw. We didn’t know exactly how wing buffet worked and this was the strategy we came up with on our 2nd reset. 
---
I know this is a bit old now, but I was wondering if you could elaborate a bit more on some of these items? You say Mirah’s Song and thrash blade are pre-BIS. However, I thought the goal of sword spec was to have a fast OH and a slow MH. This seems to directly against that, doesn’t it?
---
You’ll be level 10 before the wonders of Teldrassil wears off 
---
&gt;Make your own raid groups and have fun wiping in MC
---
You can do MC almost entirely with meme specs, get a life sweaty
---
I have a buddy who recently built a "new" computer for Classic. It contains no parts released after 2006. Keeps saying they haven't done any work to the game and there's no reason why they can't release it now, other than to trick people into staying subscribed to retail. I keep telling him the game isn't going to work like that. He doesn't believe me.
---
The fool is even planning on throttling his bandwith to perform like the 56k he had at launch.
---
Big enough damage, but none of it is on demand. Big slow 2 handers with big procs, but 0% of that happens when you press a button.
---
We hit like trucks, but we're the Ronco Rotisserie Oven of classes. Set it and forget it.
---
Others say we're slow, but we're fine. It's just that we have like 1 button we can press to do more damage, and that damage is like 10% of the rest, so, it's just meh.
---
Fury Warriors were top tier in progression guilds in AQ40 and Naxx. That was largely the patch cycle, basically every patch buffed Warriors to some degree. So they were definitely played a ton in vanilla, but it was in later vanilla and, because of the way they scaled with gear, really only abused by the top guilds. 
---
Naxx guilds poaching Warriors was so horrific because of 4H, but end of 1.12 Naxx raids for the guilds that survived and managed to do the poaching rather then getting poached looked basically like min/maxed pserver raids do now, 8+ Warriors.
---
I don’t know who is right and I don’t care. I quit pvp when they got rod of same server bgs and the old rank system. I want my same server rivalries again.
---
Lol they have all the data. You should read up on the demo mistakes they cover them all.
---
I don't like survivability talents that are unreliable. Ancestral Healing is the definition of unreliable. You might have 20% crit on your heals in epic raid gear. That's one proc every five heals. But you won't cast five heals in a short PvP fight. And even then, you can't choose when you get that proc. You might get one when you don't need it.
---
Regarding Fire Nova: we're going in circles here. It does not matter how slow it is. Drop it and stand still. If the melee moves away from it, then you start casting and punish him for moving.
---
This is my last post on this topic because we don't seem to be getting anywhere.
---
The biggest thing that enables the PvE boss rush race strategies is the backdoors into each base. Remove the backdoors, enabling defenders to turtle the chokepoints, and things will get a lot more dynamic. Even just buying 5 minutes before people get in the bossroom gives time for small teams to clear out towers/bunkers.
---
Also if they completely remove any kind of split pulling strategies/exploits and you have to fight the boss with all of the warmasters it's going to be very hard to do that rush.
---
I love darnassus. I’m never there but its still my favorite.
---
I would disagree with that. Just because a game lets you do something to someone else does not mean it is necessarily "valid" or okay or correct to do it. Some people will use any opportunity to be a jerk and I do not think that is morally okay or "valid".

"Playing as a villain" is fine if you're playing Darth Vader in a FPS against people playing rebels, that is part of the game, but "playing as a villain" by screwing over your own team is not. That's just using IC stance as an excuse to be a jerk.
---
&gt; When other people choose to maximize the game for their enjoyment, they are assholes.
---
Yea, because their enjoyment comes at the detriment of others,.
---
&gt; You're coming off as bit of a hypocrite here.
---
You don't see how doing something with strangers and doing it with friends is different?
---
When I'm at my friends house I know I can just go to the fridge and grab a beer, especially if I bring him one, but if I do that with someone I just met, I'm an asshole.
---
I follow this train of thought. If they haven't announced the date by now (which they haven't), then it's gonna be the very tail end of Summer. Or a delay until Q4 2019.
---
Even with a server list, it will be quite difficult to tell what may happen 2 months after release. A lot of factors will affect it: twitch streamers, tourists, private server guilds, etc.
---
Even if you pick an absolutely popping server on release, it may die after 2 months.
---
I am hoping that this subreddit will have a stickied server thread when we get closer to release and we can see where some ready-made guilds and streamers are rolling. This is the only way we can really prepare and have the best chance for longevity.
---
You can also pretty much just HOT + run away from anything except a rogue stunlock or warlock fear chain
---
Seeing how lvling took a while back in the days, and will probably take quite some time for alot of people this time around aswell, before an actual community has been established, Blizzard should keep a steady eye on the population of each server.
---
If server A drops from 3000 players to 500, 10 days into the game and server B drops from 3000 to 800, they should consider merging those 2 servers together.
---
10 days. I don't know how many are gonna speed run, I don't know how many will not give a damn about getting to 60 asap, but 10 days shouldn't be an issue, right?
---
Atlest server A isn't half dead, and instead they merge becoming server C with 1300 players.
---
Friccin Morons
---
Guild banks 
---
How far out do you think we'll get a date?  I'm guessing 6 weeks....but thats just out of my ass.
---
Considering most releases have been Aug-Dec. im guessing somewhere around that date.
---
&gt; Druid definitely. They get far less giant crits in pvp videos :P
---
I saw a WSG video once, 10 boomkins just ... obliterating everyone with coordinated moonfire. It was glorious.
---
Hunters are great at solo questing, grinding, and farming. They are wicked brutal in both world pvp and battlegrounds. They are even required for some raid content.
---
Not everyone raids, and even among those that do not everyone picks their character based on raid performance. I think there are more reasons to choose hunter than to not.
---
They buffed them respective to what?
---
There is no official source for either the armour values or how the damage gets really calculated. It's guesswork.
---
Most pservers have buffed armour compared to the *common guess*. How that relates to reality is unknown.
---
My friends played retail on a PvE server and I inevitably transferred to their realm so I could play with them. 
---
I really missed ganking people so I would just stand really close to any enemy characters who might use an AoE move so I could get them flagged and then I’d kill em. It worked until they changed the way PvP flagging worked on PvE servers. Then all my fun was ruined. 
---
All level 60 dungeons including UBRS are tankable as any spec without too much trouble. But prot is definitely significantly better at it.
---
ofc
---
It doesn't really make up for it. Horde Warriors do far more damage because of the extra attacks+increased rage generation. Paladins are basically the best force multiplier buffer in vanilla, with four of them buffing the entire raid. Yet WF is so brokenly good for Warriors that Horde is only 10-15% behind in terms of RDPS with three Shaman buffing a bunch of DPS Warriors group-only with WF.
---
This is one of the major reasons the classes were added to both factions come TBC. The theorycrafting websites were starting to generate a lot of crazy data, there was specifically a massive Alliance vs Horde theorycrafting post on EJ in late vanilla Naxx, and the imbalance for the way Paladins scaled with the more people you added to a raid was just to difficult to deal with vs WF Totem barely making up the difference. Ironically it was actually less of an issue in TBC, because of reduced raid size, but it certainly fixed the problem. 
---
Considering there’s nothing been announced it’ll probably be as late as ‘Summer’ is, so late August. 
---
Yep, I played shaman for the entirety of retail Vanilla. All I wanted was to be enhancement, but Blizzard just kept stringing us along and when we finally got our class "rework" it was still garbage. When TBC came out I rerolled rogue :(
---
Never buy vendor bags they are overpriced. Buy bags from the AH.
---
Holy shit yes I was so sick of reading that garbage about 2021.
---
hey are you me?
---
I would like better controls for splitting item stacks. Shift clicking on a stack and then using the arrows to change the number is a pain in the butt. I think the way minecraft did it worked very well. Pick up a stack and right click on a slot to drop just one, or shift and drag to split in half etc.
---
I had a guild in TBC and they all did this with this random little empty camp in the wetlands.
---
Later they told me it's because of the access to the boat.
---
There is zero chance they'd ever do that. 
---

There are some bug reports that shows some video data that back calculates to all around the same amount of armor (3700) for a variety of bosses.
---
here is a recent post from this sub doing the same type of calculation and arriving at the same conclusion:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/az8jju/proof_kelthuzad_had_just_3000_armor_at_zenedar_eu/
---
But a lot of pservers (basically every one that doesn't start with a K have 4700 or 5600 armor for most bosses)
---
Hand of reckoning had two functions. If you targeted a friendly player, it would taunt 3 mobs targeting that player. If you instead targeted a mob, it would taunt only that mob.
---
Actually I'm almost certain those bug report links are going to get removed. They are from the K server, issue # 11519, 11520, 11521 if you care to look them up. I have instead transcribed the text here:
---
#VANILLA-11519: Instructor Razuvious armor
---
Bug: Instructor Razuvious should have about 3700 armour instead of the standard 4691 that all bosses have hard-coded right now.
---

685 - 610 = 75
---
Single crusader gives 200*0.45 = 90 damage unmitigated by armour.
---
1 - 75/90 = amount of damage reduced by armour
---
Solving (x - 2550) / (60 * 85 + 400 + x - 2550) = 1 - 75/90.0
---
yields x = 3650

---
Solving (x - 2250 - 505) / (60 * 85 + 400 + x - 2250 - 505) = 1 - 84/99

---
4:00 Crusader fades
---
4:07 1552 BT crit
---
1750 - 1552 = 198 damage boosted by crusader on a crit
---
Crusader should give 200 * 1.1 * 1.15 * 0.45 * 2.2 = 250.47 damage unmitigated by armour (multiplying by 1.1 and 1.15 because the warrior has kings and zandalar).
---
1 - 198/250.47 = amount of damage reduced by armour
---
Solving (x - 2250) / (60 * 85 + 400 + x - 2250) = 1 - 198/250.47
---
yields x = 3707.5
---
Interesting stats, thanks for posting that!
---
I really hope the 6000+ people who voted are a good look at the larger population, cause it would be amazing to have 50/50 horde balance.
---
It's also interesting that Warrior will be the most played class but tank will be the least played role.  
---
You can have extra attack with extra ap and extra ap and critt whit every attack or treath reduction just use another wind totem and dropp wf every 12 sec
---
Yea they can do crazy burst damage. It’s just really tough to find the gear for it. You pretty much have to wait for your casters to get geared up first. 
---
Lol , aptly put.
---
Maybe this isn’t a question, but it’s not worth starting a fresh post to discuss it.
---
I hate feeling dependent on other players. I’d love to play Hunter or maybe a caster, but I hate the feeling of begging in /2 or even asking a guildie to tank or heal.
---
I almost always get stuck playing heal or tank so that I don’t get that feeling. Im much more comfortable saying “LF2M VC, need DPS” and watching the PST flow in than spamming “need tank, heal” and just having to wait.
---
Sigh...warrior, Druid, or paladin it is. Again 😔
---
I have never found fishing to be less rewarding than when I am eager and expecting.
---
How is that an official source?
---
&gt; I really hope the 6000+ people who voted are a good look at the larger population, cause it would be amazing to have 50/50 horde balance.
---
Overall I think this will be the case, but I think there'll still likely be some servers which are 45-55ish in one direction or another. 
---
I think the only naive one here is you believing anyone cares about your reddit prediction
---
Jingled 
---
Not sure about the RP thing, but Alliance have better PvE abilities (Fear Ward and Blessing of Salvation) whereas horde have better PvP (wotf / stun resist / blood fury / war stomp)
---
The premade group finder feature in retail that we use for pugging raids and m+. It’s far better than spamming general chat “lf1m scholo tank” for hours on end.
---
Just relax and do your thing man. It's getting kind of ridiculous seeing you whine constantly about how other people don't appreciate your number crunching. Which I do appreciate btw.
---
Something something glass houses
---
I love this candle, mood lighting, etc feelz
---
Add in the obvious snacks (can we get some old discontinued snack releases too? Haha), beer, liqour. I was 12 at release, so not like alcohol itself is nostolgic  though... :) 
---
Yeah, depends on how many shaman you have. Gotta have 1 for the priests, 1 for the mages, 1 for the fury's, and 1 for the hunters.
---
Gamescom
---
Bravo man. It's pretty crazy that there's people out there trying to dictate how others play the game, and then acting butt hurt when people tell them that's kind of shitty. 
---
I do blame them, but at the same time, that wasn't their intention. It was time constraints that meant that their balancing for hybrid DPS wasn't done as well as they wanted. That's why I also blame people who are totally against even giving them a slight dps boost to make them unoptimal but not totally unviable.
---
A mage with no dps meter? I like the raid frames sorted by class though.
---
Please do! I will probably play Alliance to start, so maybe also do alliance zones? Pretty please... ;) 
---
I can find some quotes of casuals being toxic toward minmaxers too. It's really easy to feel smugly superior to a large group of people by fixating on a negative vocal minority within that group and mistakenly concluding that everyone in the group is also worthy of scorn, but you really shouldn't.
---
I'll try and tone it down. My levels of give a fuck are usually pretty low, but the amount of messages I get behind the scenes requires a little bit of self deprecation to poke the bear :P
---
There's no such thing as too many dwarfs tho.
---
I Still have my original T from vanila wow with the orignal logo and the character outlines. the logo is a little faded now but i still love that shirt. 
---
I wish we corks remove min-maxers from wow entirely. Can't stand someone judging you on how you play the game. 
---
I hope your buddy is make believe, for his sake 🤨
---
I played Druid before the revamp, when innervate was the 31 point resto talent and that tree was the only tree worth damn. Unfortunately that turned me off from them forever. They were really bad.
---
Love it. I tanked in wrath as a prot pally, and it seemed there were so many tanks I had to wait for LFG....it sucked. 
---
clearly lacks a thunderfury condition
---
People like you make us minmaxers look bad. Please stop doing that.
---
You are not getting carried just because you don't min max. As long as you play with other people who don't care too much about minmaxing it's completely fine. People can play however the fuck they want. Do I want a boomkin in my guild? Prolly not, but that's okay. 
---
Well excuse me for trying to make the game more enjoyable for everyone.
---
slows don't work on bosses though
---
Ooph, that's rough man. I was lucky enough to avoid shit like that for the most part when I was a druid. That's absolutely nutty, that dude knew nothing of Druid talents, clearly. 
---
&gt;It's really easy to feel smugly superior to a large group of people by fixating on a negative vocal minority within that group and mistakenly concluding that everyone in the group is also worthy of scorn, but you really shouldn't.
---
The [original thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b2ko2o/why_so_much_hate_for_minmaxing/) was asking why it is hated. It's hated because of the vocal minority, which a few characters in that thread admirably demonstrated.
---
min maxers does not equal entitled elitist jerks. this post has no point 
---
My personal favourite spot will be the smiley face under Karazhan.
---
The lack of self-awareness in this comment is staggering.

**Paradox of tolerance**
---
The paradox of tolerance states that if a society is tolerant without limit, its ability to be tolerant is eventually seized or destroyed by the intolerant.

Oh my bad.

Fixed. 
---
Not really, nobody says "DM" to refer to Dire Maul, they add East/North/West/Tribute to it as DM:T or DME, just like nobody says "LFM BRS". They either type LBRS or UBRS, not BRS. Ditto for DM:E/W/N/T.
---
Careful now, it's supposed to be a fitness plan, not a death sentence.
---
He's very real. Every time I try to send him something namely the Blizzcon panel where they described what it took to get the beta build working), he won't watch it because of "spoilers" even though he believes it's going to be the exact same game as vanilla was. Bitch, you already know the game, you're playing a pserver and [you don't want to be spoiled?](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/018/489/nick-young-confused-face-300x256-nqlyaa.jpg)
---
for non current raidtier content druid is the vastly superior tank, and these days most people know that
---
Maybe instead of a fitness plan you could read a dictionary instead. Your brain muscle is just as important as your other muscles.
---
So, where in the chain of intolerance do we decide to stop tolerating? Because it seems awfully convenient to stop just exactly at the place that fits your views.
---
no lol.
---
Lmao, sorry, my bad, I've just been attacked so much today for trying to be nice to strangers that I legitimately thought you were serious.
---
&gt; All the rankers knew each other with the old system and you were kicked out of the premades if you played past the agreed upon time and had a much harder road spending more time.
---
Are you saying that xrbg makes rank fixing and collusion more difficult?
---
Hahah.. well shiz... he seems, unique? 
---
Love the meme, also AGREE on the pserver thing. I desperately want to login to one but I refuse to play because I know it'll ruin some of the experience, if not a lot of it. 
---
I was pretty set on playing Resto Shaman but then this post happened, and I remembered how glorious Druid T3 is and... urgh... I think I'm undecided once more.
---
Aren’t they developing it in the newer engine though? I realize vanilla was a single thread program, but I believe that’s supposed to change with the classic launch?
---
To me, the game is a balance between total fantasy immersion and dry lifeless min-maxing. I honestly get both out of it, often at the same time.
---
I love getting lost in a zone and lore, and really experiencing the world, but I also love theory crafting in a totally abstract math-land. I feel like this game was made for me :D
---
You literally would not be able to keep up with the situps.
---
You good. I understand how people can be. End of the day don't let others tell you how to live. Except maybe the cops. 
---
Who wants to go there with me? 
---
If we're thinking of the same video, I'm pretty sure that was after the TBC pre-patch when boomkins got a massive buff. 
---
Got it, I'm with you, that makes more sense
---
I've been playing the same mage as a main since the day BC launched (played a warrior during vanilla), so I decided I wanted to roll a hunter for Classic. I know almost nothing about hunter, so I ever so briefly played a pserver to get used to the combat. I played it about a week, feel good about the mechanics and I'm ready to tackle Classic when it launches.
---
All while he fights with his PC to run the game properly.
---
&gt; End of the day don't let others tell you how to live.
---
This is hilariously ironic, because the guy you are responding to was calling people assholes for not playing the game to his standards.
---
I was a tauren shaman so of course.
---
bfa launched 7 months ago though, its still got another 17 months for it's content cycle
---
The dungeon journal from retail. It outlines the loot for each boss and would save me from an alt-tab or looking at a 2nd screen.
---
Still doesn't answer my question.
---
Actually, I'm calling them assholes for putting their interests above the interests of others, but nice try.
---
people gonna be maaaaaaaaad when i be rolling around on my fat laser chicken having fun. 
---
Way better than the ones that guy made last week then deleted like an emo- kid.
---
I'm playing with my friends from high school fo this and now we all need to coordinate PTO at work, Batchelor parties and more real life distractions.  I already had to pick engagement photos date for summer.  Hope they don't conflict.  Please sooon
---
Life is what happens to us while we are making other plans.
---
Min-maxing is often synonymous with rushing, not stopping to smell the roses, ignoring all the details that make vanilla magical compared to modern wow.
---
If you go to a club with a plan to only dance with 10s then you might miss out on a lot of fun with some 7s and 8s.
---
Answered with my edit. You start with a flawed premise making your whole argument flawed. Only one group has the database’s and all of them and that’s blizzard. If you don’t believe that then that’s on you but it is the truth.
---
Now do the same thing for all the people here calling min-maxers sweaty virgins who are ruining everyone else's fun.
---
I remember this but I also recall it being a very small window of space to hide in.
---
[I couldn't find any of that in this thread.](https://np.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b2ko2o/why_so_much_hate_for_minmaxing/) Plenty of min/max assholes, however.
---
Hahahaha this is gold 
---
I think actually the fair way is to multiply the anount of shamans and the amaount of pallys by 2 to be the most fair. 
---
Maybe that isn't a fair representation, so you'd have to divide it by: The least played class for the Horde is: X and the least played class for the alliance is: Y (probably X = Y = Druid).
---
Druids tank 5 mans and UBRS all the time, even on private servers no problem. Only a few hardcore droods bear tank raids, but it can be done decently.
---
Bro, people are downvoting posts saying it's okay to not invite certain specs.
---
I know we don't seem to be getting anywhere, but if you want me to consider your pov you have to consider mine, so far all I'm getting from you is " this talent sux cause I dont like it", you dont like ancestral healing because it's about 20% chance of happening, about the same as a WF proc or slightly less than your spell crits, would you give up the ability to get an even stronger bonus when you crit for about 10 mana off a totem's cost? that's up to you but you can't go " this talent is garbage" cause it isn't, it has a function and is picked way more than the mana for totems because of a simple thing called utility.
---
You don't pick fire nova talent to force people to run out, you pick it so they can't run out even if they tried, also so they don't have time to break it , especially if you fit it in a grenade-&gt; firenova, it'll proc before the stun wears off and right as you get your chain lightning off , getting quite a kick out of it.
---
You'd rather take the braindead passive talent because you don't want to interact with fire nova that's on you, but saying it's garbage in pvp because you only wanna spam lightning bolts in a bg isn't gonna make it worthless at all.
---
I live in an area where all I have is Pizza hut, Domino's and little Cesar's
---
I don't min/maxing your group composition just for leveling is a good idea. Leveling a temporary arrangement that happens 1 time.  
---
I'd consider things a bit further in the future. I would also consider what class you truly want to play on your own before attempting to satisfy a group composition.  
---
Can someone explain how he has 5 bars all with the same hotkeys?
---
druids in wsg thats the dream
---
Jacked meaning ripped, swole, beefy, meat head. With this workout guide 
---
Warlock imo.  Because of soulshards, having to manage a pet, and a lot of people will say screw it I’ll be a mage and get portals.  
---
this is what peak performance looks like
---
Diremaul is definitely NOT DM. When you say DM for Diremaul which Diremaul are you referring to?
---
Are the people saying that being an asshole about it, similar to the image posted?
---
No one adopted it because it makes no sense.
---
I'm so torn between factions. Started alliance, switched to horde because of RL buddies. Going to come down to the RP imo.
---
Don't know about that; but if you're rolling DPS warrior a mixture of leather, mail and plate is viable when you're working your way to 60. Bump those stats, boi. 
---
I'm not an expert but they all seem strong to me. Shaman/druid has a built in healer and tank for dungeons, but the other 2 have at least a healer which is pretty good too. The first two both have fast travel on foot (aspect of cheetah/ghost wolf/travel form) so you won't run into run speed annoyances where one is fast and one is slow. (warlock and priest are both slow, so its fine). Warlock + priest=good shadow dots synergy, and being able to dot and heal as priest probably is way better than the boredom of single player priest.  
---
Maybe you should base it more off of end game? If you care about going in as a duo to BGs at all, shaman/druid doesn't seem as strong a combo as the other 2. I'm too biased towards warlock/priest because I've done that combo in pvp with a friend a bunch back in BC. (good synergy!)
---
Nope. The op is objectively correct. He's getting down voted because this moron sub has changed the topic to being a witch hunt against their pathetic demigod streamers. There is no good argument for cross realm bgs. It's self evident that cross realm has no place in vanilla. 
---
The Hut is probably your best bet then, yeah. 
---
my computer wouldve been exploding so hard, the entire video if I had recorded would be the ground while on follow lol.
---
Ok...don’t join it then? Either you’re not good enough to get into a good guild or you intentionally choose bad guilds. I get it, you think you’re good. Nobody’s saying you elites can’t optimize you’re characters. Play how you want. Good god.
---
That's funny. I played a hunter at launch till a little after WotlK. I'm seriously thinking about mage, for that sweet raid utility.
---
If your guild allows people to play ret paladin then they should also be allowed loot...
---
But you can have loot council with rules btw.. Like certain items are prioritzed to classes that benefits the most from, like high hit(boa in this case) items not going to 2hand specs
---
It will feel extra good when your laser chicken 1 shots them and they cry nerf &gt;.&lt;
---
always gave me that indiana jones feels, and i thought that sunken temple was what all the ulduman and zul farrack and other mysterious dungeons led to.
---
&gt;DON'T
---
&gt;Be forced into playing a certain way if it doesn't feel right
---
Be prepared to never be allowed to play in a group.
---
I hope they do keep an eye on population.  Would absolutely prefer merged servers over a dead one.  Playing on a dead realm would kill the game for me rather quickly.

Typically I would find that loot officers know less about what is good for and what individuals actually want of loot, but I can understand what you are trying to do.
---
Ironically, the only "asshole" in your picture recieved an upvote from you.

And with our recent conversation in mind, I highly doubt you're remaining unbiased when you're judging, but I don't think anyone could reasonably call this respond "being an asshole about it"

It may use more cores, but should still run fine on most machines. The tax on the gpu will be essentially non existent

Yep. Which is why #nochanges is retarded.

This is upvoted:

&gt;We just hate how they project it on everyone else. A simple “sorry no ferals” turns into “pick a new spec and get good. No carries/meme specs in my group”.

Here's an asshole:

&gt;I will never raid with Retardins or Oomkins and nobody can force me to.

&gt;And I will use Excelsheets and shit &amp; love it.

&gt;No one cares if you min/max, you're confusing the point. People just don't like the people who claim anyone not min/max'ing is actively being bad and ruining the experience for everyone around them. There are a few extreme folks who demand that every player be in the absolute min/max or else they're awful people. If that doesn't describe you then you're not the one being complained about, so I wouldn't worry about it.
---
There can be rules which prioritizes people with high hit requirements(DW fury and rogue) on high hit gear and downpriors low hit requirement classes like hunter and 2hand specs. That's a completely normal thing to do really. 
---
If whether I have war stomp or not makes or breaks an attempt on any 5 / 20 / 40 man raid boss then honestly we weren’t close as a group to getting the kill in the first place
---
For me my first ever character was a troll shaman, and if I’m going to make alts after that I want to diversify; or it might come down to something as simple as loving echo isles more than something like deathknell but it shouldn’t matter to anyone but me is the point
---
I get your point about optimization and I do consider that when making new characters, but for you to claim it takes no effort, or it should be thought of by people just picking up the game is exactly why people dislike min maxers and fear elitists, therefore limiting Classic and WoWs healthy growth; variety is NOT a bad thing and people like you and even blizzard need to understand that, even if there’s a “more optimal” path
---
Makes me laugh when people roll on a PvP server and then expect not to get ganked or camped. Then bitch about it. Whiney babies. I've gotten into arguments about this on this sub before. Apparently I'm an asshole for pvping.
---
There's been a couple of serious guilds on pservers that did DKP. It's rare yes but not impossible.
---
They're just numbers, not the actual hotkey.
---
I'm not serious
---
People are interested in different things? Just because some people don’t care about world firsts on classic doesn’t mean everyone doesn’t. 
---
Only allowed to level when i have rested experience MINMAX HARDCORE
---
This attitude is why LFG and the butchered retail talent tree exist. People like you gatekeep people who don't care about BiS and the game gets dumbed down so the rest of us can play together, away from people like you.
---
Stop being an asshole and the game will remain difficult for all of us.
---
It is just a joke man....
---
Hunter/Shaman:  Poor, if you level the shaman conventionally you are both competing for the same mail gear.  Hunters don't benefit from windfury, nor do they really speed up from having support since they take very little damage if they manage their pet correctly.  
---
Shaman/Druid:  Subpar, both classes self sustain well enough that their partners healing helps.  Once again druid doesn't benefit from windfury.  There is some buff synergy at least with the other buffs.  
---
priest/warlock:  Good, as you both can multidot and the debuffs can buff each others damage.  Only not S tier because you have same armor type and your main CC is on the same DR, but this is somewhat minor.  
---
Warrior goes from being basically the worst class to level solo, to being basically the best in duo with any support partner.  On it's own before good gear their lack of control or self sustain limits warriors to very slow single pulls, but with someone healing they can be hyper aggressive and do a lot of aoe as their damage goes up the more damage they take.  Shaman partner adds more damage, paladin is more survival focused, and priest is best raw healer while leveling.  Druid works as well, but it is quite as natural of a fit in this role.

So that was 4 months in advance. Someone needs to make a list of all blizzard release dates Vs announcement of release day dates.
---
How was the population balance on the Ayn Rand server?  I tried to make a character there but every permutation of Johngalt was taken so I just said fuck it and rolled on Lightbringer.
---
the problem are people who play... "too casually"... yet demanding raid spots in top guilds, equal treatment to people who put work in their choices, have a higher standard for doing things etc...

basically like UK

Anyone who gets their jimmies rustled this much about [optimizing characters beyond belief and feeling superior] is surely on the spectrum

Game months away from release with no release date has forum filled with neurotic trolls. Wow who could have guessed. Will be completely irrelevant once game is actually out. Join a guild that suits your goals, problem solved.
---
My mom says I'm very artistic
---
be careful about that best feral part... involves a lot of gnomeregan :P
---
Funnily enough druid is usually less then either shaman or pally on vanilla PS.
---
Do you think since so many ppl are gonna play warriors in classic that this may be a problem as a tank as well? 
---
Well you know how it looks. Think of it this way, you have two options:
---
1. Guild with a Warrior Main Tank as the GM.
---
2. Guild with a Ret Palladin as the GM.
---
Which one will you rather choose just based on this info? When I see someone being a GM/officer with a class &amp; spec that is about the guild I choose that over a GM/officer who is about themselves.
---
I like min-maxing!  The reasons I dislike what frequently passes as min-maxing here is:
---
1. The people spouting optimal play are not capable of theorycrafting the strategy.  They are just repeating what they've read or have been told.
---
2. Vanilla is presented as a closed book, with no room for improvement or equivalent alternatives.
---
3. Private server numbers and mechanics are considered gospel.
---
Summer 2019. I live in Florida and summer is next month CANT WAIT /s
---
Don't know how many times I died to a lag spike from that.

They're even pretty good at raiding for T1/2 and even into AQ. It's really only the end 5% off content that they fall off that the vast majority of people never see.

#NOMAPS
---
August 31, 2019
---
Lol, some people care about minmax and others don't, like to each their own 
---
I have a feeling we will see a late summer release, maybe in August? I feel like if it was coming out in June, we'd have heard something by now. I hope I'm wrong.
---
The two most popular I've done while waiting for Classic with my group comp was
---
Stealth run, 1-2 druids, 3-4 rogues. Just skip everything. Fastest run time by far
---
WF Melee.  Shaman with 4 melee, being almost exclusively warriors.
---
Don't need a dedicated tank for killing as everything dies so fast with 4 warriors DPS + WF. If anyone grabs aggro they just weapon swap macro to a shield.  Bosses, just whoever has aggro is the "tank" as one of the other melee will inevitably grab it off while dps'ing.
---
Probably. I've been looking to go back to classic where I mained a warlock, but going back as something new....like a tank. lol   
---
I'd love to play a healer, but I suck at it. Respect to all healers.
---
It's the best we can get. Multiple independent videos all calculating out to the same value of 3700. If you don't have a conflicting source then don't waste your time responding with your "nobody knows anything" drivel
---
I don't think I ever tried with 2 tanks, just because of how hard it was to find 1.  
---
2 healers isn't that abnormal as I think the design is to have one hybrid offhealer.  So assuming those 2 healers are adding damage whenever they don't need to heal, it functions basically the same way.  
---
Hopefully, fuck loot council, most of them are just about ass kissing.
---
It's the characterization that players who are simply trying to find a fun way to play the game are instead doing so intentionally in order to frustrate other players.
---
Which is idiotic, of course.
---
what's with the civil war between casual and hardcore players, you might as well be arguing over which flavor of ice cream is best tbh 
---
Okay because i’ve heard a lot of people say that one of the benefits of being a warrior is that you can find groups easier than classes with dps roles.  I’ve never played WoW and thinking about playing warrior in classic.
---
Frost is the highest single target dps spec while levelling, frostbite and shatter is crazy strong. I get why people like going fire/arcane levelling to mix things up but practically speaking frost is just better in every way. 
---
I live in america. Might as well just turn in my two weeks.
---
So the key to being fit is to never stop doing sit ups?
---
Bfa was released 9 months after it was shown. I have faith the same table will be for classic
---
Maybe he's playing BFA? Even if you bought every single best BoE for a given level i doubt you would ever be able to aoe farm same level mobs with arcane explosion in Vanilla. It costs a shit ton of mana and does no damage. It is absolutely terrible compared to blizzard aoe farming.
---
The thing is funny but inconsistent/dishonest.
---
The Chad theme would be funnier if it focused more on the social/rp aspects IMO instead of things like "(...) but mobs the floor with horde scum anyway" and "puts in fear into hearts (...)". That's just wishful thinking and reveals the author as a wannabe winner instead of someone who stays true to his theme and focussed on just having *fun* and make that his goal.
---
The Chad can't compete with Virgin in the ingame PvE/PvP aspects, but will still laugh and make friends and choose his own adventure, so he is winning in a completely different and self directed way.
---
I would love it if they balanced the specs in vanilla. Too bad the #nochanges crowd would lose their minds and the collective REEEEEEEEEEEE would probably destabilize the fabric of the universe
---
I want a date too but they probably don’t want to set one because they aren’t sure how long it’ll take to finish. I kinda prefer it this way so they have more room to polish it. We don’t want a rushed product! 
---
I hear you, I started my druid JUST before that patch. You're right, they were terrible before that revamp. Boomkin wasn't even a thing back then if I recall. 
---
I did something like that, I played warlock until just before the revamp lol. Apparently they were way better afterwards.
---
Keep in mind that tanking is a huge role. If you have never played WoW I'd suggest you start with a DPS class so you can get to know the dungeons w/o being blacklisted for sucking as a tank/heal. lol  
---
Tanking can be stressful, especially way back on a classic (vanilla) server. Not a good place to start as a new guy. Learn the dungeons and raids first before you try and tank it. 
---
&gt; Here's some posts from people that weren't assholes across the entire thread
---
The first one literally says you shouldn't be allowed to only invite certain specs when pugging and is upvoted.
---
The second one is just asking to phrase the same thing differently.
---
&gt; You called everyone who doesn't play the game like you an asshole and you're the victim?
---
Citation Needed.
---
At least pick a bad set from modern WoW
---
Why else would you choose to not only be at your own detriment, but the detriment of others?
---
The problem with merging late on in the game is the community. Suddenly one day magically, 200 new people show up from nowhere and disturbs the community. Nobody know if a person is a ninja, an asshole (will probably be seen by many quite quickly..) or anything else.
---
And I agree, if my realm is dead 3 months into the game, I just rather leave the game for good.
---
After a few months you’ll just be raid logging anyway
---
I've leveled an alliance balance druid to 60 back in TBC, with no shapeshifting and the mini-map turned completely off.
---
Because I wanted a better leveling challenge.
---
People use the slippery slope argument, but I don't agree. They say if we let them use sharding in the start zones, they will shard Blackrock mountain, or silithus, or un'goro crater, and it will change how farming works on the server.
---
The thing is, its doubtful that there will be hundreds in any of those zones at the same time, and if there is, those people will already be committed to the game.
---
Blizzard is really worried that people who would otherwise love classic would get turned off to it if they can't do shit for the first 3 weeks of launch, and when they can finally play in a reasonable state, there are already 60s, with nothing better to do than camp out in STV or similar in their downtime

And you don't think intentionally making things more challenging for a group of strangers qualifies as trolling?
---
More like 8 hours. Private server players are just dumb and ruined their own lives. Full time students were able to get warlord. The losers on private servers who rank have no lives and are dependents. The fact they think Classic should be designed around them shows how out of touch with reality they are. Someone like "Tribe" who lobbied for it needs to seek professional help as do any of these "pros" who have done this 18 hour a day grind for months multiple times. I feel bad for their caregivers and I hope they stop being such selfish pricks. Their parents should just kick them out of the house honestly.  
---
Why because you care about PVE more than PVP? It's just as big a difference.

How the hell can you be annoyed that people have more knowledge of a 15 year old game you never played.

Yea, that not everyone not playing like me, but again, nice try.. seems like maybe if you can't be honest, maybe you're not on the wrong side of the argument, just saying.
---
Haha, I'm actually considering Resto Shaman as well man. I've never played a shaman before to a high level. 
---
I've decided I want to be a healer, and it sounds like priests are best at that in vanilla. Any thoughts on the choice between Priest and Shaman? Either way it's gonna be hard not to just roll druid and have a blast. 
---
Shadowprey Village. 
---
Yeah I had a bunch of fun with this sort of thing.
---
Hah, one time I actually tried to tank with my warlock voidwalker, and got surprisingly far into wailing caverns before everything fell apart. 
---
What?
---
100% no
---
Not really. 1-2 per mob. Your playstyle doesn't really change whether you take Enhance talents or Elemental talents. No matter what talents you choose, the fastest way to level a Shaman is by doing the following:
---
* Wear a 1H + shield (can switch to a 2H against casters)
---
* Cast Lightning Bolt to pull
---
* Drop Searing Totem
---
* Cast a shock (usually Flame Shock)
---
* Wear it down with auto attacks + Lightning Shield
---
* Rinse and repeat
---
* Drink every few mobs
---
The Elemental talents buff your damage on the Lightning Bolt, Searing Totem, and shocks while also reducing your mana usage, allowing you to kill more before you need to drink. The Enhancement talents buff your damage on auto attacks. There's no wrong choice here, but I tried both and Elemental was definitely my preference.
---
Cmon bro, lol jump in right before ur ally dies. 
---
Seems to me like you're a min/maxer calling anyone who doesn't min/max an asshole. Can you explain how that's different than
---
&gt;Yea, that not everyone not playing like me
---
Seems like a distinction without a difference.
---
&gt;You literally linked the comments yourself.
---
Identify exactly where in the comments that it says what you allege:
---
-
---
&gt;Actually yea, if you're demanding someone play a certain way, that it just wrong.
---
&gt;Like sure if you're in the guild &lt;try hard minmaxers&gt; then you can invite whoever you want, but if you're grouping with strangers or people outside your guild (aka 90% of the game) then demanding they do things a certain way is arrogant.
---
&gt;Acting like a teamplayer includes accepting how others want to play.
---
You’re right it does. Back in 05-06 I used to play with a zippo lighter while I was on the flight paths. Anytime I smell a zippo now I’m right back in vanilla WoW. Dustwallow marsh actually is the strongest association for some reason. 
---
Changing group making from a social activity to an automatic queue is not the same thing as adding a bigger population to the battleground queue system. 
---
Did it stop win trading on modern Arenas? Nope. People still banned for that. It just makes it harder to track by the players. I doubt Blizzard wants to hire people they just fired for a 2004 game to police it 24/7 across tons of BG's. With no cross realm BG's popping at 3 in the morning sticks out like a sore thumb. 
---
Rogue code 101
---
Which part of my argument is flawed though? you say I don't follow the demo but I've been well tuned long before classic was announced, a pserver ( or the people in it to be more precise) started the movement that led to blizzard's decision to make classic, this is FACT, you can google it if you like, blizzard barely had enough data about vanilla wow left, ended up hiring some of the people who were in said movement because they had some of the data needed to fill in the gaps, it wasn't enough surely because neither blizzard nor pservers had the complete data, so some of those were filled via guesswork mostly, watching old videos/estimations , does this mean that blizzard now has the complete data of vanilla ? 
---
No because neither did pservers, they were both slightly off but then came the tweaks ( I'm not talking about the overlaps that legion regen and such that were tweaked ).
---
Since servers at blizz these days aren't built to handle the stress of massive amounts of players in one zone like their old servers could ( around wotlk ), since after mop the game was tailored towards limiting the amount of people in one spot at any given time, as such reduced server load and shortened capacity would be the most cost efficient way for blizzard to go forward , since they do love to make more money after all and probably made the decision to downsize in order to reduce costs.
---
So even though they could have 50k players on a server these days, you'd never see more than 50-100 around you in any scenario whatsoever.
---
This means blizzard HAS to implement sharding ( fully or partially) or limit server populations because they truly can't do otherwise unless they actually upgrade their classic server specifically which would cost them.
---
That notion pushes classic into a modern version of vanilla wow, which is even further away from original vanilla. 
---
Which means that you will never have tarren mill vs south shore battles the way you had in the early stages of vanilla nor will you be able to experience the massive server crushing numbers swarming the gates of AQ during the event, nor will you see as many people when an opposing faction raids the other faction's capital city, this is a very big change to vanilla identity at all stages of the patch progression and as such would place classic further away from classic than pservers not only at the end.
---
You might think I'm trying to bash classic in favor of pservers due to how i'm choosing my words, but in reality I want classic wow to succeed just as much as you do, I hate pservers and love the old blizzard, but I'm afraid people on classic reddit are too busy reliving and sharing their nostalgia to point out the things that need to be iterated , if points are not answered or heard enough then blizzard will do as it pleases and we've seen how that went.
---
Tailor/enchant is the way if you want to min/max to the bone, but it will be very expensive. Alch/herb will probably make you a lot of gold, depending how goes the economy on the AH, since most people will tend to hoard their gold to buy mounts. Personally, I plan to level a warlock with tailoring/herbalism, so I can craft a little bit and also gather some herbs to make some gold (maybe).
---
After painstakingliy deliberating between hunter, priest and rogue I eventually settled on paladin. Currently testing on an 'undocumented server' and loving it.
---
My hatred of the min-maxing mentality really comes from my time as a DM for D&amp;D. Min-Maxers are people who LOVE to game the system and NEED to win. That lends itself great to  some games but for D&amp;D is causes problems. A min-maxer in a group setting like that gives you issues as a DM - do you keep things where they are and risk the game being boring/other players feeling irrelevant or do you ramp things up to meet the min-maxer and risk other players dying. 
---
Min-maxing in a solo game? That's just fine. It's you vs the computer so who cares? It's when your min-maxing effects how the game has to treat other people that is the problem. But a lot of WoW's later philosophy was tuned to casual players because they decided to go in the other direction. Vanilla ramped it up to 100 expecting those people so it got to the the point where only a fraction of the min-maxers were seeing Kel Thuzad. 
---
And you know what? I'm fine with that. I play on PVE servers so the min-maxers, as long as they aren't full of themselves and spouting abuse to those of us who don't think like them, don't effect me one bit. The only time they annoy me is things like "A level 22 Paladin can't tank VC! I'm not going to waste my time and soul shards on this." 
---
Blizzard has all the data. You haven’t been tuned in if you think blizzard has crowdsourced data. They have the original databases. It was covered in blizzcon. The errors in the demo weren’t from them not having the data. They were errors that should be expected when you move data like they did. They covered and addressed every error in the demo and some that pserver players said were errors weren’t.
---

&gt; We just hate how they project it on everyone else. A simple “sorry no ferals” turns into “pick a new spec and get good. No carries/meme specs in my group”.
---
He's giving you two quotes that say the exact same things, but one is phrased slightly more politely.
---
&gt; Seems to me like you're a min/maxer calling anyone who doesn't min/max an asshole. Can you explain how that's different than
---
Again, how do you then explain that I literally wrote hours ago that people can play all the shit specs they want to? and that I "don't give a shit"?
---
Alright, thanks. That's probably what I'll go.
---
*laughs in warrior*  simple rogue thinking he can gank meh!! How you will learn to fear me
---
TL;DR - A small number of hardcore players spend a lot of time on forums/reddit telling people that you **can't** play Vanilla in certain ways.
---
As a result some people have started making posts/responses telling people that you don't have to min-max to play the game. Some have gone further and assumed everyone who plays hardcore/semi-hardcore is here to ruin your day.
---
Reality is people should play how they want but you can see where it's coming from. Even in this thread people are *seriously* responding that you won't get groups if you don't play the game "properly"
---
Honestly the mods should make a rule about this on both sides because it's getting increasingly toxic.
---
Were we able to turn off exp in Classic? I don't remember ever doing it pre WotLK afiak

---
&gt;i.e. if you don't invite someone who plays bad specs, you're not a team player

Why are you being dishonest? It says "demanding", not "not inviting." Two completely different things. Do you honestly not see the difference between
---
&gt;“sorry no ferals” (not inviting)
---
and 
---
&gt;“pick a new spec and get good. No carries/meme specs in my group” (demanding they play a certain way)
---
&gt;Again, how do you then explain that I literally wrote hours ago that people can play all the shit specs they want to? and that I "don't give a shit"?
---
Bruh you plastered that thread calling anyone that didn't play like you an asshole, that is the complete opposite of not giving a shit.
---
I know. But this is also a comment section.
---
While not a direct answer to your question.  Don't forget about the extra long attunement quest to that everyone will have to complete first. 
---
Then they reroll Druid to play the OP class and realize it's not at all what they thought
---
I would really like a September release.. summer time is when I do a lot of my overtime. September would be perfect!!
---
&gt; Why are you being dishonest? It says "demanding", not "not inviting." Two completely different things. Do you honestly not see the difference between
---
Only inviting people of a certain spec is definitely demanding the people you're grouping with play a certain spec.
---
So no, I do not see the difference between the two.
---
&gt; “pick a new spec and get good. No carries/meme specs in my group” (demanding they play a certain way)
---
Not inviting, and articulating the reason behind it, so upside and downside depending on how you look at it, I'd prefer if someone gave me the latter version.
---
&gt; Bruh you plastered that thread calling anyone that didn't play like you an asshole
---
Maybe that's your interpretation of what happened, but if you cared to actually look at the posts, we're clearly dealing with a subset of the players who didn't play like me, again... if you have to be this dishonest about what's happening, then maybe, just maybe, you're not on the right side of the argument.
---
I hesitate with alch/herb, because I like the RP/flavour of it, and it's nice to make potions. But with tailoring you can make bags and have some BiS gear later on, hnngg can't still decide yet ;)
---
I've already told you I've seen all the replies, the errors in the demo aren't what I was talking about , I literally said that wasn't talking about the demo above nor was I talking about the voidwalker despawning because I remember that 's how it functioned in vanilla.
---
Anyway I think we've written enough, don't think there's much room for discussion left between us.
---
In peace.

I'm onto you. You and your schemes to get others to be healthier both physically and mentally.

Yeah same, it seems like being able to make potions can be helpful at times as well.
---
That’s great! Would make sense too, he feels a sense of accomplishment and bragging rights because he missed out on the epic montage of leveling and etc. he was but the noob, now he’s the master. 
---
+28 intellect....damnnnn
---
I switched from Shaman to Priest at 30. Also switched from Illidan-Horde to Mal'Ganis-Horde at the same time.
---
Login ques were horrid. 
---
And you keep ignoring your claim of blizzard not having the data which they do.
---
Not everyone gets the same DKP. I suggest you research, or at least read the links provided in the OP.
---
I don't care about people who played the game 15 years ago, in fact I find it cool that they had that unique chance. 
---
That said, nobody honest has had 15 years of experience on it. Since it has been unavailable for 13 years or so. People who played it back then most likely don't remember much and will be a near fresh experience. The only people with a real advantage are scummy players who have been playing on pirate servers illegaly for god knows how much time.
---
\&gt; Beyond retarded
---
Good ol' ad-hominem comes in handy when you don't have any arguments huh? ♥
---
Whatever, man. I linked ample evidence of you outright berating people who don't min/max, arguing that they are selfish assholes.
---
You can try to spin that however you want, but the fact is you're what makes the min/max culture so toxic. There are a lot of out there who are really passionate and helpful when it comes to min/maxing and people like you give them a terrible name.
---
I knew several full time students who had jobs who got their rank. It's based on a curve. He isn't lying. Queues mainly popped after school and work and then after raiding. Private servers release Rank 14 gear at server release which makes it stupidly overpowered and that is another reason why it's so contested. That never happened in real WoW and pvp gear actually had to be buffed later on because it was just not worth the grind and people felt like they had completely wasted their time.
---
The only person here that is "lying" are the little kids who played vanilla pugging and who then played on private servers a decade later and think it's the same. They look like Esfand, Asmongold, Staysafe and Tip's Out. The people who ranked in premades look like Swifty. The Classicast and Asmon crowd didn't accomplish much until WOTLK. It's not their fault, they were little kids. When they act like they are experts or act like they have experience though? I will call them out as frauds. The fearmongering and scenarios they use to state that it will be needed won't exist with a 3k cap and a player base that is not made of autistic people that do a 18 hour grind for 3 months every single year like they do on private servers.
---
I don't think you understand the meaning of the word "intentionally".
---
If I play a balance druid with the intent of having fun and someone wants me to heal their 5-man, I am not intending to troll them by healing as a balance druid.
---
Hurricane was the 31 point balance talent and it was a terrible spell that had to be channeled.
---
There are a few videos of people 3 manning Onyxia, though they were in full T3. Videos of 4 manning with T2 or similar gear, 5 or even 6 manning with T1.
---
If you push people to grab enough good gear, know everything you need to know - 15? 20? 
---
Also consider that Koreans killed Onyxia 10 days after they had their game released, so you can probably pull it off ;)
---
I’ve already warned the office when I take my week vacation this year.  I’m going to Azeroth and won’t be available unless they send me in game mail. Then I’ll respond next time my questing brings me to a mailbox. I also reserve the right to ignore said mail unless it comes with a nice tip. 
---
Duuuude! So much this!
---
Like why am I just refreshing this sub constantly? I'm hooked man, I am ready to begin my adventure once again!
---
Most warriors are going to want to dps
---
Not really. Apex Legends is super fun, it doesn't mean I like Overwatch any less.
---
Retail and Classic are fundamentally two different games and as much as I want to re-explore Classic and do the things I couldn't when I was a child I still enjoy playing Retail.
---
Been playing destiny 2 because a friend bought it for me bailed on him all weekend to refresh sub. 
---
Or if you want to just get slim: no food and only water until raid on farm.
---
Play classic with friend, problem solved
---
You got me considering it. I played vanilla from 2005-2007. Warrior tank as my main and hunter alt. And a 19rogue twink, lol twink was the term right? Anyway I was leaning towards starting Classic as Shaman, but now idk...
---
Been meaning to get to so much homework, and possibly play some WC3 TFT... But damnit, why do that when I could share my nostalgia and hype for this amazing game?!
---
&gt; Whatever, man. I linked ample evidence of you outright berating people who don't min/max, arguing that they are selfish assholes.
---
And again, all of those people i called selfish assholes belong to the same subset of people who aren't minmaxing, which also happens to be a subset of objectively selfish assholes putting their interests above the interests of others as a minority over the interests of the majority.
---
&gt; but the fact is you're what makes the min/max culture so toxic.
---
It's still mind-boggling to me that people consider wanting people to be polite to and show respect for others is considered toxic these days.
---
There has to be some sort of gear check, though. I was just reading that her flame breath can do up to 4K damage, so presumably fire resist gear is going to be necessary for the tank?
---
I mean, does it affect player power in a significant way? I can't imagine they're going to hold it just for the sake of holding it. 
---
r/buildapc
---
I have felt that way since classic was announced to be honest. I haven't been able to play a game for more than a few hours, which is a very weird thing for a person like me.
---
Thank god for Youtube, Twitch and cryptocurrencies
---
We have no quantifiable proof that there will be a mass exodus of 75% of the population. In all of World of Warcraft history I have never seen that big of a population dip, even when an expansion hasn’t done well.  
---
I know long term population stability is the main argument, but that argument is built off of speculation. I understand it’s the core fear of any true fan of Vanilla WoW, I just don’t think there is any way to ensure end game server stability from the start. That responsibility lands on us as a community, as in no running off new players, being friendly, being helpful, etc.
---
You forgot the part where it takes a single realm experience where you see the same names from low level to high level and in instances and PVP and ruins that. 
---
This is so accurate on so many intellectual levels (no pun intended there).
---
Yeh I get other games are fun but I just haven’t wanted to play them as badly as I’ve wanted to start leveling a orc warrior slaying boars in the starting zone. 
---
If they're all okay with you being balance, then more power to all of you, that's great, hell I'd probably accept you too if you were up front about being balance.
---
However if someone is looking for a healer and you just say "hey, I can heal", then you're being self-entitled by expecting them to accept that you're not performing as well as you could be.
---
Heh, twink was definitely a thing.
---
In fact, I actually levelled my druid to 39 and just kept him as a twink at that level for a while (traditionally one needs a main to have a twink, but I was horde so just sold deviate scales and deviate fish and from that got all the money I needed to twink out). 
---
If I were you, I'd consider having a Druid as a twink if you enjoy that. 
---
Tailoring/Engineering.
---
Ah, a man of culture as well
---
Not really. The thing BFA has over classic is mythic plus and me and my friends do 15s or higher so gaming drive not at all killed there. 
---
maybe if i don't interfere they wont gank me or sorry bro just her for an herb/mine laterzzzzz.
---
You're severely underestimating how much CPU affects FPS. Having high clock speeds on your cores makes a tremendous difference. GPU's importance depends on what resolution they are gonna play at. if it's 1920x1080p then something like a 1060 is more then enough. However if their reso was 2440x1440p they're gonna need a much more powerful gpu.  
---
CPU &gt; GPU &gt; RAM , unless you have a very small amount of ram like 1gb this is the order I would upgrade.
---
It is the thought the counts right?...
---
I just find the difficulty curve on those to be a bit obnoxious. I finished up to a 12 last season and had no drive to continue dealing with un-fun mechanics. I'm glad your enjoying BFA still though. WOW should be enjoyed in all forms. 
---
I've seen some solid 2h slam builds.... Just saying. 
---
Yeah all the downvoting in here from Chads lol. I hope they try playing on PvP servers, it's going to be incredibly fun based on the % of yeah players voting in this thread.
---
Yeah I've been doing some research but all I can find is "it's not optimal unless you are horde with bre" "dw is better" but how much worse is 2h compared to dw with similar gear and without WF
---
He was on moonguard RPing professor chaos.
---
Yeah, that's exactly what I never understood either.  It feels like they had two different teams for Alliance and Horde that didn't communicate, and honestly, that's not so unlikely considering the little bit of what I've read about the game's development.
---
I'd probably say shaman because totems are fucked in classic. Otherwise probably paladin because they are utterly boring compared to other classes while leveling.

Huh, and the April Fool's joke deliberately says it's under Raven Hill Cemetary, which would be in the general area you're talking about...hmm.  I guess there was someone from the original dev team that was randomly thinking about this and made it into an April Fool's joke.  Cool!
---
Yeah but his point still stands I think, neither group should hate the other due to a vocal minority on either side
---
I think you might need a little bit of fire resistance...
---
I'll take that as a yes.
---
I always feel blizz favored horde back in those days even though everyone thought they favored alliance. 
---
Yo don't make fun of the staff of shadow flame!
---
Avoid it by doing one of the following:
---
1) play on the same server as a major streamer (cant vouch for the quality of the people there, but there will be bodies)
---
2) pick a realm near the top of the list (for example, I'm playing on the first server listed as RP)
---
3) pick a realm named after one of the major lore characters (arthas, illidan, etc)
---
4) if your server dies pay $25 and transfer to a new one with a higher pop.

2 tank groups 2 Warrior/or 1war1feral, 2 shaman, one warlock ---- 3 melee dps groups of Shaman, Warrior Feral Druid, Rogue, and War/Rogue/hunter mix --- and 2 caster groups of Mage x2 Warlock x2 Boomkin ---- 1 Healer group of Priest Priest Priest Priest Druid. Lets raid.
---
First one that hasn’t said bfa q&amp;a in a long time. Fingers crossed for info
---
Druid - NE
---
Hunter - NE (there's an argument to be made for Orcs due to Rexxar being half orc, and also for Dwarfs due to the trailer, and due to Dwarf riflemen). 
---
Paladin - Human
---
Warrior - Dwarf, Tauren, and Orc (Muradin Bronzebeard, Cairn Bloodhoof, Grom Hellscream...)
---
Shaman - Orc mainly (I see the arguement for Tauren too, but I feel like most of the WC3 storyline was essentially Orcs remembering their Shamanic roots led by thrall. 
---
Warlock - Undead (there's definitely an argument to be made for Orc as well, and maybe even human, but at the end of the day, Undead are the chief wielders of dark magic.)
---
Mage - Human (everything to do with Dalaran, the archmages, Jaina, etc.) 
---
Priest - Human (this one's tough as there's a strong argument to be made for trolls being big healers, but that's not really a "holy" type of heal, and undead priests as well, but I see priests as being primarily holy, and thus, Human). 
---
If all you care about is leveling than anything will work.
---
If you're interested in raiding, lock/priest will have best odds of getting into a raiding guild
---
I get that.  I'm just talking about people's perception.  If someone wants to play an Arcane Mage, they should be allowed to play an Arcane Mage as long as they're with the right group of people.  But when those groups cross over and someone tells them
---
&gt; "*hey, you'd do more DPS as Frost"*
---
that person gets characterized as a sweaty tryhard with his nose in everyone's business, whether justified or not.  And that's a best case scenario, as people are rarely that polite about it.  It's usually something more along the lines of
---
&gt; *"lol, this dumbass is specced Arcane.  Someone kick him from the group, what a noob."*
---
Reasonable people can all agree that there's nothing wrong with playing the game in a way that's fun to you.  Whether that means optimizing your character to beat content or playing the goofiest spec you can imagine doesn't matter.  People just need to learn to find their own birds of a feather and leave the other crowd alone.
---
What if you say, "I'm specced balance, but I have a healing set". Is that trolling?
---
On the website itself, it does say it's for BFA, unfortunately.
---
Don't get you hopes up, most likely will see 8.2 PTR details and mostly a BFA focus, if they have Classic news they'll do a post about it, not put it in a Q&amp;A I don't think. 
---
good point!
---
You cared enough to insult me lol. Hopefully 1 day you'll be able to cope with differing opinions. 
---
If not specified, all of them
---
I have never played druid before (except when Legion dropped I used my instant max level token on one and played for a little but never xpd one) and I have already decided that will be main’ing a druid :) but this made me SO MUCH MORE EXCITED! 
---
Thank you friend. 
---
There will be 500 other warriors every night looking for a group and competing for the same loot as you. It's a pretty simple choice for me. But, follow your gut. Warrior is awesome.
---

---
I'm sorry but if it's allowable in game and not against the rules it is in fact okay or valid, why wouldn't it be?
---
Thrall drives a Tesla; not a Fusion.
---
&gt;**what would you think classic wow would be like if it had TBC class design?**
---
I think it'd be basically perfect, or at least a huge upgrade. Class design in TBC was a real strength of it. Although a lot of it was just the diversity of gear. For example feral druid leathers rather than having to borrow rogue stuff.
---
Night elves are really big on being priests too considering their lore 
---
Since TBC, I've only been in guilds that tried to be as laid back as possible while still intended to clear stuff at a reasonable pace, and I've always tried to lead raids the same way whenever I had to lead a raid.  And a large majority of the time, you get someone that just can't take it seriously enough, even from people that intend to.
---
That's fine for one or two people, but if you get too many like that then your raid can't progress well, and when that happens, there's a certain kind of malaise that spreads that wouldn't generally affect "serious" raiders but because your team is intentionally casual they are often vulnerable to it.
---
And to also talk about the last thing you said: Sometimes it's nice to break up the monotony by doing silly stuff, such as deliberately looting a voodoo doll in ZG far away from the raid but still in range to aggro them to see how much damage can be done before you're dealt with or, in TBC, rushing to someone during Gruul's Shatter and see if they can get away from you.  The problem with 40-player raids, or really any large number of people, is that you can easily get way too many people trying to be the "class clown" so to speak, and then you get the problem you described.  Also see: Any Twitch chat with more than 30 people.  It's just chaos as everyone tries to talk, even when they don't intend to be disruptive children.
---
So basically, in short, what you said. :P
---
Not antagonizing someone who would otherwise pass on faction killing also protects that space.
---
That's a little beyond the scope of this meme where someone is already being attacked though.
---
Oh right! Yeah I'll give you that. POTM and all that. Yep, I might need to revise it to NE... I'm still going to give the SLIGHT edge to human, for now on that one. I could be convinced however.
---
The horde thing is not exactly true but you need GOOD gear to make it work well on Alliance. Early you are going to get crushed by Dal'rends humans. 2h as ally is also harder to dps with. It's definitely good to learn with the swing timer because many people won't want to use that Ashkandi as dps on Alliance and you can get it easier on Alliance side. If the loot is more than just a pvp item it's not a wasted item which is a good thing. Here is a quick google search and someone has a video.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI8FzDYk2ro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI8FzDYk2ro) 
---
Horde on the other hand can abuse hamstring for wf procs in between cooldown abilities. You can still use slam on Horde but most don't because it's just  a much harder rotation for not much payoff. Sometimes we spec it if we especially bored that week on raid night. 
---
Not trolling, slightly entitled maybe, but not trolling.
---
Was your entire guild undead?
---
They barely even whisper classic in these things 
---
17?!? No way it makes it
---
People can play the game however they want, by themselves. 
---
Hmm anything for gnomes? O.o
---
Given the lack of any sort of marketing for Classic I don’t feel it will be part of this, at least at any depth.
---
Agreed 
---
There's a certain ret paladin I know who used to lead a guild on a vanilla server who would call for power infuse for bigger seal of command procs ;)
---
The engineering profession I'd say. Heh, and I forgot about rogues somehow, I'll add them in but I don't think gnomes are chief among them. 
---
I picked up Red Dead Redemption 2 a few weeks ago, and I really can't say enough good things about the game.  I'm really loving it.  But there are also times where I'd rather sit here and refresh /r/classicwow/new than play it.  It's not RDR2's fault, it's a fantastic game, but I feel that way about a lot of things.
---
I was always one to stop and help out. Sometimes I’d even go out of my way to deal with a ganker. Especially if it was a lowbie that I could one-shot. 
---
However I do recall an instance where it did bite me in the ass. I was running through STV to help a few friends fill out a pug raid for ZG when someone in general asked for help with a ganker. I whispered him and he told me it was a level 41 warrior. I figured since it was kinda on the way I’d do my part, smack him once and be on my way. 
---
Nope. 
---
I killed him just as planned but it turned out he had two rogues and a stealthed Druid with him.
---
I got ganked. Then got ganked again when I rezzed. A few people decided to zone out of 
---
ZG to help kill them (which I didn’t ask for). As we wiped them another 10 enemies showed up and killed us. 
---
A few more decided to zone out and help too. It went back and forth for like 30 minutes, tons of fun. But eventually the Lock and the few others who waited patiently inside the instance /raidquit.
---
One of whom was the friend that asked me to join. He didn’t talk to me for like two days because he was pissed that I derailed the raid. Lol
---
Same. I've spent the past week neglecting my steam collection and rewatching all the wow guides on YouTube
---
Bollocks. The only way to get in to it, is to jump into it. You can learn while you actively seek out dungeons to tank while you level your warrior. Any but the most hard core guild will appreciate any player, with a genuine wish to play well and a critical view of their own performance.
---
I only live to play classic and also get a handy
---
Well said. We are adults now with responsibilities and paid vacation. let us get our cards in order. 
---
Be thankful they released a time frame instead of leaving us in the dark about it. They could have said nothing and we'd be having ~~discu~~ fights about what year it was releasing instead of wondering what month (out of 4) it will come.
---
This is the best.
---
Man, I have some great memories running Heroic 5 mans in TBC with a Windfury Beatdown group.  We ran them with a 2-Hander Warrior "tank," a Rogue, a Ret Paladin, an Enh Shaman and a healer.  Blazed through some content, it was a blast.
---
I nominate the Grinch. 
---
Then you have very poor reaching comprehension since win trading took off post Arena /crbg's and there are entire business built around it. It's just harder to police as players. 
---
You are also under the illusion 3 k pop servers will have multiple premades on both factions all the time when Classic (and real Vanilla) isn't like private servers who have BG's and often updated rank 14 gear (completely retarded as the gear was buffed later on) which is why people no life to chase the gear so hard. Sorry that ain't happening. You aren't going to have to wintrade champ.
---
Want to know what the grind to rank 14 looks like? Crushing people who afk after the first fight and if you have the better premade you get dodged. Now if you want to change it so premades play premades? Good luck with that. People will queue the amount until the system kicks in.  Then if you try to address that you end up punishing a few friends who are dps who queue and who don't even have a healer and get matched up against premades.
---
Absolutely no harm, problem is you give them an inch for boomkin and ret, they will take a mile with cash shops and DKs and LFD/Rs and more cash shop and then they'll remove a bunch of the "useless" skills to streamline the game and hopefully you get where I'm going.
---
The only way to stop the creep is to freak out over every tiny change. Only way to not die from death by paper cuts is to burn all the paper.
---
The flak is received almost exclusively for their lackluster performance in raids, where top guilds will resort to bring only one or two druids. The second one being on the roster just to make sure that there actually is a druid in the raid at all times. Cat form won't pull the weight taking gear from Rogues. Bear form is very situational, and it's better to just have one of the two druids (or both) have a bear set available should it be required. Balance is lolspecc, brought on farm nights to boost spell crit for fun.
---
Just glanced at that sub, already see a decent computer within range.
---
there is no cringe in having a hobby and being clear about it 
---
Basically anything we really want to know probably gets screened out...
---
Blizzard deliberately designed to druid class to be THE hybrid class. Playing a single talent build is playing the class improperly in my opinion. 
---
Yup I've viewed these videos and they are very informative, but they never say by how much less which if it isn't a very big gap I'd rather by what I want to play but if it's a huge gap in do compared to dw I would never want to put 39 other people at a big disadvantage for me to be selfish.
---
I have this too. I'm trying to cope by playing osrs but it's only helping a little and less and less each day. I need classic now :(
---
It's totally viable in BWL if you've got nutty gear but at that point you might as well be playing dual wield and having an easier time.
---
Absolutely agree. HC nerds are often super helpful and approachable and they often put their guild first.
---
Putting your guild first also means you spec/gear for the guild and not yourself, because you rather accomplish something together in a smooth way. It isn't "elitist" but social.
---
Social guilds are similar, they are also about their guild and the community but just have very different in game goals than raiders.
---
It is the ones that are between that are problematic. The ones that want to raid into high tier stuff but don't want to farm the consumables and don't want to min-max. It is a mix of false expectations, greed and egocentrism that fuels the drama in these and brings them down. Many of us have seen or experienced it first hand.
---
That’s true Itemization is something that would shift balance too yeah, if classic had better gear for the underrepresented classes it could be a different tale entirely 
---
They probably don't really know so they can't give an exact date, other than summer.
---
You think they'll just pay Asmongold for the goods? :V
---
Hey whatever happened to the Elitist Jerks site? When did they shut down. Did they go somewhere else?
---
Smug face 
---
I want to think that, but probably he already saw that everything was going down the drain and didn't want to stick around to see it all.
---
DW you don't have to play with the trash you are talking to, just boot them out of your parties using a rating add-on. You don't want to be in that tanks group anyways, probably will be spending 6 hours in ZF 6 months after the game had come out.
---
Just be around the first week the only people at high level will be likeminded and will respect your time, let the others inflict their stupidity and ignorance on each other :)
---
I agree with you that class balance and itemisaton was alot better in tbc. I still don't want them in classic for me classic is a known quantity. And I want it just as it is flaws and all. But we can always hope that in 2-2,5 years we have a chance to relive the tbc splendour 
---
If you are using Ashkandi for dps and not just for pvp? You aren't being selfish. The reason people don't play it isn't because it's bad dps. It's because the other rotation with 1 handers can be done with one hand and a xbox controller. Vanilla had really easy rotations in pve for the most part and pvp is where you used all your abilities. Exceptions like 2 h fury slam, feral druid shifting simply aren't played much because they aren't the norm. Hunters are also often played EXTREMELY bad because they level so easy, but their endgame raid rotation relies on a shot timer like the slam spec and moving wrong is so punishing with autoshot.
---
If you want to play it, play it and have a blast. You are playing one of the only 3 harder dps rotations in vanilla. At least you won't be bored like the mages and locks :)
---
Ony isn't hard because of crazy damage or a ton of hit points. It's all a mechanic fight. As soon as you have 40 people attuned you could start attempts. In fact, if they don't know the encounter starting off early will probably be good practice and a growing experience for your guild. 
---
If people are standing in the right places and doing the right things, it doesn't really matter their stats. All gear does there is give room for mistakes and makes the fight end faster. 
---
Even with the Scarlet Monastery thing, it's still my perspective that there's considerable Alliance favoritism, but I'm not nearly as biased as I was back then.  Hm, I guess now that'll be another thing to see for myself when Classic is rereleased.
---
Is that bad?
---
&gt; Like any class, the class quests for druid are epic and the rewards feel epic. 
---
Until you hit level 20, and there's no quest for cat form.
---
Or for travel form.
---
All the troll healers are shamans in wc3 trolls and orcs splitt the shaman roll orcs are the nature warriors and trolls are the healers whit different totems
---
Thanks for the comments, yeah I don't mind difficulty I just like the animations and feel of using a 2hander. I don't mind having to time slams with swing timers
---
This really feels like a "letter to self" from a former Druid player, haha.
---
But really, the problem with Druid is that it's totally fine to play non-Restoration the entire time while levelling to 60, but then the game extremely suddenly and sharply flat-out says, "NO," if you want to play non-Restoration in PVE.
---
That's my only warning to people that want to play Druid because that's what made me really hate Classic as much as I did.  However, this time I'll be pushing back about Feral a little more than I did back then and see what happens.
---
Well it’s just a thought experiment, what would classic wow look like with tbc classes I’m not asking blizzard to make it so because first of all I know it would never be accepted by the playerbase 
---
It is 5-10% once your gear is good enough that the otherwise inconsistent rage generation stops being an issue (BWL+) assuming we're comparing the same level of weapons+gear to DW vs 2h. It is actually higher on trash/mutli-target situations. 
---
It is also just more loot efficient, as otherwise those 2hers aren't being used much. Since a raid has ~660 gear slots and you get like ~27 pieces per clear, being loot efficient makes a big difference.
---
right, that's why I'm asking. I never did Ony in Vanilla so I'm completely unfamiliar with the level of difficulty. 
---
AND it was self-targeted.  It could not be cast at range.  Yeah...
---
Can you reasonably do Ony with less than 40? How much fire resistance do you think everyone needs, or are Potions of Greater Fire Resistance sufficient?
---
The Warden was kinda rogue-ish too
---
I can agree with almost everything except that you should feel "lucky" if you aren't raid healing. Healing/supporting in raids is quite frankly multitudes more challenging than dealing damage and resto Druids are beasts in PvP too.
---
I've seen this theme in multiple threads now and I'am suprised at how much people think healing is some kind of boring stuff someone does on the side in raids. To be a *good* raid healer you need to be attentively watching surroundings and predict incomming damage spikes all the time. As a DPS you basically move to the right places and press buttons in a predefined way. Raid healing is much more skill-expressive than dealing damage. And I don't mean 20% more I mean 2x-3x more.
---
Yeah that’s fair. I was considering including a line about that.
---
Except this is a team based game, and if you’re deliberately choosing awful specs and gear that doesn’t perform like everyone else then you are holding others back and expecting them to pick up the slack for you. I’m never gonna say anything to you in game, but that’s an asshole move 
---
Only a handful of those will hit max level. And of those, only a fraction will make viable tanks. I don't think tanks will have a hard time in classic. 
---
I think I might be one of the few who's actually done 2hand fury on alliance side. There was 2 things that made it even remotely decent, a OP BRE and world buffs. Without both of these I really just don't see it happening.
---
Anyway I played a 2hand fury spec with imp slam (I think I had 3 or 4 points) and some points into improved 2hander in arms. I was quite competitive on meters actually, top 10 on the server in BWL which I think was mostly from cheesing meters with high burst on the trash in razorgore/nef. 
---
I don't think 2hand fury is possible without both worldbuffs and 1.12 version of BRE. Bre shreds so much armor and worldbuffs seemed really important to keep up flurry and have enough rage for BT+WW spam (and the occasional slam).
---
Since you decided to include absolutely zero information about what your goals are or anything even remotely related to your preferences, I'll flip a coin a couple times for you.  
---
**Rogue** vs *Warrior* - **Heads** vs *Tails*. Result: Tails, Warrior.  
---
**Warrior** vs *Mage* - **Heads** vs *Tails*. Result: Tails, Mage.  
---
Congrats, you're a mage.  
---
I won't deny it's one of the greatest to me for levelling.
---
I found mage to be really boring in vanilla, even though in most games I go mage.
---
If you’re all about the DPS, go rogue. If you like tanking a bit too, and want a class that scales really well, go warrior.
---
Also I’d post this question on the “what should I play Wednesday” post that comes out on Wednesdays.
---
being ganked is a part of the experience.
---
Red is dead. If you aren't attacking every member of the enemy faction you can then you are doing it wrong.
---
If you dont think my mage is going to become insanely powerful because I can turn into a fish...
---
Not my experience.
---
Maybe from a lore or PvE perspective but I played on a pvp server and it always seem like the horde got the best of it 
---
It's true there's technically no reason to play a Druid for tanking or damage dealing.  That was the argument back then, and of course that hasn't changed because it can't: it's the same game.
---
But we're not robots, so who can say what attracts people like the OP or me to Druids even if we know we're missing extremely key things like Defense, Berserker Rage, or proper weapon damage stat scaling.
---
Although I know you're not being antagonistic, just using your post as a backboard here. :P
---
In raiding all the classes are watered down versions of themselves though, because they are brought for a very specific reason.
---
PvP is the place where all the classes and specs really start to shine and a huge variety of abilities are used. It is also where you see a lot more hybrid specs that trade min-maxing for utility/mobility/control.
---
I mean just as an example because you brought up Priests and Warriors. Just think about how many things a Piests uses/does in a Raid versus in PvP. Now for a Warrior. It's vastly different. 
---
Play a mage, a universally good class across all of the aspects of the game, stages and gear levels. geared, not geared, pve, pvp, flagcarrying, grinding, leveling, solo, group, mage does everything well.
---
And if you decide to main something else after a mage, you always will have it as a farm char. so its never really a wasted time to level a mage.
---
You're counting the typical year long drought into your equation. Its probably closer to 10 than 17. 
---
Well, arcane explosion and cone of cold don't benefit much from spell power too
---
Thankfully, that will definitely be very different in Classic 2019 vs. 2005/2006.  Although I didn't have to struggle that much to tank dungeons as a Druid back then, I could feel there was a lot of suspicion.
---
Nah. Asmongold burnt his own bridges and wasn't even given a media pass the last Blizzcon and they aren't paying any HUGE streamer to promote WoW. Overwatch? Probably, especially if they add a battle royale. They need to do something to save that game. 
---
Who knows might be a girl. Overwatch has a larger potential female playerbase from animation/style alone than a game like Apex and girls spend money to. Maybe Pokimane? 
---
idk, thats still in the cards seeing its march, and we dont have information about even a beta. if its summer, theres a good likelihood it'll be a shitshow. 
---
i would prolly live in a small hut near the lake in teldrassil
---
That is *far* from true. Many actually prefer Druid tanks in 5mans because their tank/dps gear and spec are extremely close, while Warriors are either much more damage or tanking oriented. As a Feral druid you get /w all the time from people who are looking for tanks.
---
each patch cycle is usually 6 months right? I'm assuming theres at least three raids- 18 months of progression, so yeah you might be right. I do hope BFA ends soon, it is the literal worst expansion so far...
---
You ignored the part where I said starter zones will be sharded and on top of that I bet over 30% of players will drop out before level 25. Yeah it can be rough but I would rather have 4 servers than have 25 and not be merged. 
---
I think you need a somewhat modern system. The retail client runs like garbage without an SSD. I'm not sure if thats a symptom of the zones/art or the client itself. 
---
You're gonna have a bad time if you use a ten year old rig to play Classic, I think.
---
Well i don't want to get into class specifics so lets just talk about roles in a 5 man dungeon group. Warriors tend to be the leader some people expect them to know dungeons like the back of their hand.  Your the best at what you do and groups are constantly looking for tanks to fill a group. Or if you happen to know a healer you shouldn't ever have to wait for a  group. Unfortunately gearing and leveling can be a chore on a warrior.  Mages your a the best friend to any healer because they are going to expect water.  You have some of the best CC in the game and can dish out good damage and survive pulling aggro.  You can AOE level and teleport around the world. Unfortunately you are squishy making you a prime target for rogues in pvp. Also damage is relative to gear and caster gear isn't as good as melee during phase 1 content. Rogues are a class i don't know much about other than their dps is usually high.  I had a bad time leveling one in BC but i was burn't out then. 
---
Something like that. Its typically 3 big patches, and we havent gotten a 8.2 yet. That should come out in like 3-4 months? then maybe another 5 months for 8.3? Which is around Blizzcon. And then I'd imagine a 9.0 9-14 months after that. 
---
Doh, totally forgot about that for cat form. Thought there was one somehow. 
---
I knew there wasn't for travel form though.
---
Man, that's actually kind of lame :(. 
---
Uh, not really. If people don't like that then they can just not accept sub-par specs into their group in game. There's no need to call anyone an asshole in these forums for their choice of playstyle. 
---
Ah my bad
---
Since we're not getting updated models or textures in Classic, a GPU is probably fairly low on the priority list. AFAIK modern WoW taxes GPUs mostly from too many high-poly-count models on screen, and that's not likely to be a thing in Classic.
---
With that said, a PC can obviously be used to play things other than Classic, so that has to be taken into account. It's just that shelling out for a high end GPU isn't very cost effective (but then, neither are the crappier ones).
---
Really, the one thing that anyone wanting to build a PC should be looking at closely is... a not-too-crappy SSD. It's night and day compared to an old arse HD. Other than that, a modern mid range CPU from either brand along with 16gb of decent dual channel RAM should make short work of classic.
---
I thought about helping. 
---
Sounds fun but man heroics in TBC are brutal, can't imagine healing a two handed warrior through them until the content is extremely outgeared.
---
I can respect that, I think I was letting that internalized bias get to me there. That's a really fair point honestly, it's largely why I'm thinking of rolling a priest this time. You're also right about resto druids in PvP, that's great times.
---
I feel like warlock has to be orc, since they were the first warlocks, right? But undead are indeed the masters of shadow damage. That's tough one.
---
I’ve been out of the loop, when does classic come out?
---
Oh yeah, that's what it was.  I did come to feel as though Alliance was for PVE with its racials and proximity to raid zones (until Ahn'qiraj, and even then it's not that bad as Alliance), and Horde was for PVP with its racials and general atmosphere.
---
This isn't counting the unbelievably terrible Alterac Valley map balance, but I wouldn't want to judge on only one thing.
---
Female Dwarf. I like playing the least played race/gender combos in mmos cuz i feel special but also I like making an axe wielding barbarian woman with braids the size of her torso. It's a good aesthetic all in all. 
---
That or I recreate the first character I ever made: Zoltar the Gnome Warrior. I'm truly torn, between the two.
---
I level efficiently. That's always my goal, even back in retail.
---
Yeah all good just different playstyles. I am excited for Classic to finally have action in the open world again.
---
Good point. That still leaves Garona as the most famous Rogue though I think... Plus the Warden is all about retributive justice which is the opposite of Rogue... But I do see what you're saying in that fan of knives and venomous strike (or whatever that DoT was called in WC3) are super rogueish and the melee agility playstyle in general, and you're also right about blademaster being more of an arms warrior (although there's also that blademaster in act two of the founding of durotar who's entire role is a stealth mission).
---
In fact, really it's the Draenai (WC3 version, not those ridiculous space goats of TBC) who are the quintessential rogue race. 
---
They said this summer so could be anywhere between June-July-August.
---
Do you have to buy the game, or just download it from online? Is it vastly different from retail or just different servers? Will everything be the same, no sharing account items with your characters? Will add-ons work at all or should we use vanilla specific versions? 
---
I mean... the numbers aren’t there. It’s just objectively worse than what else you could have chosen. When you play a ret paladin in PVE you’re expecting the rest of the DPS to make up the difference because you like the class fantasy and think it looks cool or whatever. A lot of people think that’s selfish, no matter your level of investment in the game 
---
BC "Launched" in 2.0.3 -- but 41-point talent trees were released in 2.0.1. So we did get a *little* bit of Classic with "BC class design". 
---
Mages and Warlocks were *insane*. Ret was upgraded from "meme spec" to "bad spec" (this was when crusader strike was added permanently). Druids got the best kit they had ever seen. Enhancement was upgraded from "bad spec" to "kinda ok if lucky spec". Fury Warriors got a really fun playstyle. Holy priest went from "best healer" to "best x 100 healer" (jesus CoH was op). Shadow priest also became fairly decent. Prot Paladin was somewhat viable as an OT.. kind of. Hunter BM spec was nuts-o. Other specs stayed similar, but hunter overall felt better.
---
Then rogues... Ugh. Just thinking of Rogue/Druid 2s makes me sick. 
---
True, they were the first warlocks. And WC2 Death Knights are much more "warlock" than they are death knight. 
---
If you can do it with less than 40 or not depends too much on the skill and experience of the raid for me to give you a good answer. It's certainly achievable, and sometimes going with a few less is easier because there is more room to spread in p2 and less people to get knocked around in 3.
---
Fr isn't needed on the raid at all. If you're fresh 60s you're better off getting gear with stats than resists, it will pay off more. They should use greater fire protection though. Pre-pop them before the pull then use again in place of a healing potion. The only fire damage the raid should take are fire balls in p2, and the healers just need to toss a hot on them, and the p3 eruptions, which can be mitigated with good positioning and only happen every 20-40 seconds. Fr is more effective if there is a lot of fire damage or very very strong fire damage. Ony isn't really either. 
---
Main tank could benefit from fr, but only use strong pieces. Don't gimp their def or hp to stack fr. The purpose there is to try and reduce flame breath damage, which is the only fire damage the tank should take.  Not because it hits very hard, but if we are talking fresh 60 their damage intake will be very spiky, healers will over heal and then their threat becomes an issue.

2h slam compete on top dps, but its hard to master hardest ingame if you ask me.
---
World of Warcraft, in its original form, is a social game.  Having the luxury to take your time and enjoy the company of others is the crux of the Classic movement - to experience the original game at a leisurely, friendly pace again, as it was intended, instead of being railroaded content at 5000c.
---
If you want to zoom to the endgame, smash dungeons while breaking the sound barrier, and burn yourself out on raiding at the speed of light, that's cool, nobody can stop you from doing that... But don't be upset at anyone but yourself when you get blacklisted from group events, dungeons, or raids because you're known on your server as the "antisocial, angry spreadsheet guy."
---
Classic is FAR more fulfilling compared to retail, no matter how many hours you put in.
---
I'd say if you're planning to play any of the instances/raids you're gonna dependent on other players no matter what. Do what you want to most. If it's gonna be that annoying to you then you'll have to go a tank like you've mentioned. 
---
"Get ready for a Classic Summer" is the most recent information we've gotten. It wouldn't really be much of a "Classic Summer" if it comes out on the last day of the season, would it?
---
The practice itself is just math, and RPGs are about numbers, so it all seems sound enough to me, if a little strangely obsessive.  I can get like that about things, and I like numbers and math too, so that's all fine.
---
The problem is when it's distilled without context to people that can't properly process the math or the resulting numbers.  These people take the math as gospel, and even though it's true numbers can't lie, they don't realize how small of an effect it will actually have when playing the game and end up playing a spreadsheet instead of the actual game and stomping over anyone and everyone in the process.
---
Even the theorycrafters sometimes get too far up their own asses and declare someone "useless" because their class does &lt;10% less DPS than someone else's, which makes practically no difference when actually playing the game.
---
It's also sometimes used as an excuse to cover up bad play, and this is likely what ticks me off the most, though thankfully this kind of misuse doesn't happen often.
---
And not to mention in all of this, it just kills the "heroic" spirit of the game, the immersion.  Like why even have graphics and sounds or anything?  Some people might as well go write a numbers simulator and stare at it all day instead of playing a video game.
---
Yeah I could see that also, I remember when playing vanilla like every warrior was 2h but that's without the 1.12 talents and gear. Anyways I guess I'll just have to switch with dals until I can get a BRE OR untamable blade

[Orc Forge](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/h-na-rp-pvp-orc-forge/76890) Horde guild recruiting here.
---
So, are you saying they'll pay a girl to be the face of WoW Classic? :V With a T-shirt that says "Sylvanus was right."
---
2h fury on horde side with a bonereavers edge must be good, because  I recall seeing it used by Dreamstate in their speed clears
---
My first classic character was a druid. I Loved it because healing was an easy way to relax during raid days, it got repetitive however.
---
Because druid can only be tauren and elf I'd say druid will be the least picked class.
---
Warriors are the god class that I'll be playing on launch day
---
Don't go enchanting unless you're planning to go all-in playing WoW. It's stupid expensive to level and getting the good recipes isn't something you can do easily without help as a Priest.   
---
I'd go herb and alc after you get your mount while storing all cloth for Truefaith Vestements if you decide to switch to healer.
---
Healing in raids while shadowspecced is not something I'd do without approval from the rest of the raid, I wouldn't recommend it either way.
---
Healing in dungeons as shadow is easy until you get to strat/scholo. It's not impossible to run them as shadow, with a skilled/well geared party it isn't a problem but on a fresh server that's usually not the case. 
---
Since you asked about talent tree specs I've got a few setups if you're interested:
---
With [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVRhsVZZxrxzbxRt) spec you can try to top off your party members with shadow damage spells + vampiric embrace with threat reduction for shadow spells and lower cooldown on fade if you accidentally pull aggro. If you're getting aggro with normal healing spells way before you run out of mana then you could try moving points in the disc tree from mental agility to silent resolve.    
---
I'd say this is a safest option if you're running stratholme but you lose some strength in solo play.  
---
With [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVRhsVZZxMgzcxkt) spec I've traded off the improved-vampbrace and threat reduction for longer range and psychic scream. I think I used this spec for stratholme as a fresh 60 on LH. It worked but the rest in the groups were way better geared than me for most runs.   
---
A lot less safe in but stronger for farming and leveling. 
---
Finally [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVRhsZZEMgzctot) is my favorite spec which I'm going to use on a Troll priest when WoW classic comes. Troll racial gives you a 3 hit shield that can proc blackout stuns on melee attackers,   
---
A shit-mix of PvP and PvE since I'm going to be PvP-ing with a friend while leveling. It's probably sub-optimal but I enjoy it too much.
---
Haha sorry didn’t think about that. I played a rogue back in vanilla and all the way up until bfa but I feel like I may need a switch up. The three classes I posted about are the most interesting to me.
---
If you played rogue for the last fifteen years, I'd recommend not doing that in Classic...
---
Yeah, I've seen it, thanks. It doesn't change what I said in the last post. The fact is we don't know the specifics because Blizz hasn't elaborated.

They are using the 7.3.5 engine, proper multi core support was introduced in BfA. So no multi core for Classic.

I'd want either damage shield (protection warrior talent from wotlk.) Or titans grip (fury talent can't remember if it was wotlk or cataclysm).
---
Pretty much every class was dramatically improved in TBC.   
---
The spells that jump out at me as mainly a TBC pvp'er.
---
Hunter - Silencing Shot -&gt; Turned hunter into a powerful CC/lockdown class
---
Druid - Cyclone -&gt; Super unique powerful cc to a class with really weak cc  
---
Mage - Ice Lance -&gt; Makes shatter combo a core part of gameplay  
---
Paladin - Crusader Strike -&gt; Turns out having an active attack is nice for a dps class  
---
Priest - Vamp Touch -&gt; Turned spriest from meme into fun useful spec  
---
Rogue - Cloak of Shadows -&gt; Made rogue feel like a ninja instead of a weak warrior  
---
Warrior - Second wind -&gt; Might seem like a boring talent but made warrior feel like a beast that had to be dealt with, kiting just fed them rage/hp
---
Shaman - Bloodlust -&gt; Pretty self explanatory  
---
Warlock - UA -&gt; A dot with a drawback to be dispelled completely changed the viability of the class  
---
So there's a start but there's plenty of other changes to that were really big in making WoW just make more sense and be more fun. Debuff limit raised, pvp trinket CD and effect, CC duration change, pet scaling, gear sets for every spec etc etc
---
Although the first reply here is technically correct, what it really ends up as is obsessing over tiny 2%  increases in effectiveness that don't really end up mattering, in my opinion.  Even 5% differences barely matter.  Personally, I say 10% is where things become noticeable.
---
The practical application is that it covers for people making human mistakes, which is fair, but then again, people could just play better.  The game doesn't require you to be perfect.  No video game does, or else it wouldn't really be a game but just a bot simulator.
---
The impractial application is very seriously competing with others on DPS or other things in PVE, which is mostly silly to me, but I won't really harp on those that do it.
---
Too bad they only have 3 armor designs per raid
---
My boss games a bit but really casually, that's the problem, she wanted to know what classic WoW was. She knew what WoW was so i tried to explain to her that it's the first version of the game that came out and the game today is bad so people want to play the old game. She answered with "but isn't the game like super old with bad graphics?" which i replied with "yeah, and buggy but... it's fun" lol
---
Yeah, I figured we'd have fire resist pots for everyone, but I wasn't sure how much FR the tank would need. It seems like he would need a bit more than the 15 FR on the Drakefire Amulet. 
---
We'll be running UBRS a bit for the attunements so I figured the tank would have a Draconian Deflector shield by that point. I guess the real goal is to hope we can get a Breastplate of the Chromatic Flight crafted as well.
---
It was fun but didn't really make any sense with only 51 talent points and none of the new lvl 62-70 skills. Just putting the 2.0.1 patch in vanilla is really a bit of a mess, it was never designed to work.
---
I'm not overly worried about it but I just want to be able to do what I can do on pservers 
---
Yes tanking is very stressful during vanilla wow but there's classes that does crowd control like majors can probably morph an enemy and rogues can sap enemies. Then you pull so now there's two enemies sitting there for half a minute to a minute while you tank a couple enemies. But it's easy to get the hang up but it's also very easy to fail at tanking. I'm going warrior because it is my favorite and I'm damn good at it. And about the not being able to find a group because there's too many tanks I call bs. There Will be know group finder so basically you have to either type /Who all x (x being the level) and message people to see if they want to join your group for an instance. Or join a guild and find friends that you can always play with. Or wait in a town and join a group that needs a tank. Guilds usually have a few main tanks that are always the tanks and raids. Don't be fearful to tank. It's a blast
---
What the... Tank LFG?
---
We had a Godfathers on base back when I was in the military. No clue how they stayed in business.
---
Everyday they had the all you can eat lunch buffet - where 300 dirt poor 20 somethings with athlete metabolism stuff their faces for $4.99 or something.
---
Blues with good players in good specs i'd imagine 30 could probably do it. You'd want all mana users to have a full set of mana pots and everyone to have FR pots. It will be fun to see the videos of the first kills in Classic to see what the setup is.
---
and the best part about healing as druid is you dont ress people, so after a wipe everyone has to run back togetrher and not just the healer ;D i think it makes everyone play a bit better too because of this.
---
Human - Mage or Paladin.Night Elf - Druid or Priest
---
Dwarf - Warrior or Hunter
---
Gnome - Rogue or Mage? I've never played a gnome so I don't know.
---
Orc - Warrior, Warlock, or Shaman
---
Tauren - Warrior or Shaman
---
Undead - Rogue or Warlock
---
Troll - Hunter or Shaman
---
&gt; It will be fun to see the videos of the first kills in Classic to see what the setup is.
---
I expect the new world first kills will be with less than 40 as the guilds try to down Ony before they've got the full set of 40 attuned players.
---
I wouldn't worry about it too much.  Not every guild will be hardcore min/maxing.
---
I remember finding my way into a guild (Ancient Aegis)  simply through LFG'ing.  The guild was doing a bunch of dungeon runs and I managed to get picked up by them.  As we chit-chatted about various things in life throughout the dungeon, and after the guild saw that I knew how to play my class/spec, they invited me to their guild.  My spec was not min/maxed in the least for PvE; it was optimized for my style of play in PvP.  Regardless, the guild was a good fit for me and the guild felt the same way, hence the invite.  I guess you could say I (inadvertently) interviewed with the guild and made the cut.  I raided with this guild (without having to respec) and, while we weren't one-shot'ing every boss, we had no issues progressing through the various raids.  I may not have topped the DPS charts, but I was pulling my weight because I knew how to play my class/spec and I learned the fights.
---
On your way to 60 you should eventually find a good group of people who you will gel with and vice versa.  You'll form bonds with these people, possibly even join their guild or form one of your own with them.  If you play regularly enough with the guild, help guildies and run dungeons with them, you'll find your place and you will eventually be considered a part of the guild core.  Any good guild worth their salt and with the bonds you will have formed...I can't see how you would be barred from raiding with your chosen class/spec.
---
The OP is right, play how you want to play; have fun with the game.  Don't let the hardcore min/maxers scare ya.
---
Vanilla is actually hard. You might not even make it to level 30 yet alone clear MC. Take every piece of advice you can get from the min-maxers. They are heros for bothering to help you. If you don't like what they have to say, don't listen. Please stop making posts of how they are ruining your game experience!

Haha, I love this addition. Especially as it puts a positive spin on that. It's not a bug, it's a feature!

---
Again: If people don't like that then they can just not accept sub-par specs into their group in game. 
---
It's as simple as that. You're really not helping your case by insisting on telling people things they already know in this thread.
---
Attunement isn't really a problem at all, it basically just lbrs, brd, ubrs or something. Easily doable in one night for anyone playing enough to rush lvl 60. This isn't TBC where you have to slog through heroics with bad gear. Even ubrs can be done very quickly by 10 fresh 60s that know how to play their class. I think the hardcore rushing guilds will have no problem getting 40 players to 60 in 10 days so it won't take long at any rate.

I love that this dude just came in here and basically proved your point. 
---
Most of the better guilds on private servers split up the guild in 2 and 20man it. You don't need fire resistance but you do want to pop greater fire protection. 
---
everything you said is right except paladins are hands down the best healers pvp and pve.
---
But did you punch the feminist in RDR2?
---
&gt; Your only downside is that your only resurrection spell has a 30 minute cooldown
---
On the flipside; it works when stuck in combat. Which can be rather handy in PvE/P
---
So am I the only one who kills other Druids in Moonglade? I know all of the spots where I can attack without catching aggro from the guards. They always seem shocked when I kill them. Like I'm just supposed to let a level 10 LIVE...
---
You couldn’t pay me to play current wow
---
I’m thinking of playing one as well. Mained one in vanilla until i lost it and rerolled a warlock.
---
The main issue that i want to avoid, and everyone rolling a druid should be aware of, is that if you want to play balance/feral properly you will have to min/max a lot. And this requires time.
---
BiS gear is basically mandatory since you need all the help you can get.
---
PvP is where the druid fares way better and you can see that. Even in vanilla, with proper gear (epic pvp set, AQ mallet etc) feral is an absolute beast. I’ve seen 2.8k crits. To get that far however you need to master it and that ceiling is very high.
---
Druid is fun, but serious druid requires serious dedicatiob
---
Every raid has Ferals on private servers. Feral is probably the best Druid spec in 1.12 if played correctly. 
---
That said, you should be prepared to make your own groups if necessary. Tanking is most definitely a leadership role. Everyone wants to play Feral, but few want to be leaders.
---
Tauren Shaman brings the BBQ; that's all you need to know. :V Now go forth, and moo.
---
Hahaha, you asshole lol. That's kind of awesome though. You do you in this game, we can't all be pacifists haha, and I think it's kind of a good thing to imbue your victim with a seething hatred for your faction, it gets them more into pride for their faction. 
---
Therese a spot in raids for all classes. 
---
Balance is really not necessary as long as you have rock paper scissors. 
---
You are totally lacking in self-awareness if you think telling people not to play the game in the way that is most appealing to them makes the game more enjoyable for anyone but yourself and those who think like you.
---
Same goes for Shaman, though. The end-game basically expects you to heal.
---
#Never trust an elf
---
You avoided the question and then changed the topic. Now you have written 3 paragraph about even more unprompted topics. How can anyone take your stance seriously when you respond like this.
---
what does this mean
---
The recent news actually drove me to start playing on a pserver, and it’s been absolutely amazing. While a little overpopulated, a lot if not all of the great parts of vanilla are there, including the community. I’ve got a warrior to lvl 29 and I’ve already made friends with people I grouped up to do quests with and generally people have been very friendly and helpful when grouping up. It’s a very welcome experience after the complete lack of social interaction I dealt with on retail.
---
&gt;walking on water is absolutely baller.
---
OMG I FORGOT ABOUT THAT!!!
---
Damn, I may need to go shaman... Sigh, I was so close to having my class decided lol. 
---
Don't forget giving pally tanks a taunt.
---
Then the chicken realizes all mana is gone after one enemy and gets rekt.
---
I think a date isn't to far off if we continue to get new information on classic at a steadier pace.
---
I would take + damage/healing over int and spirit all day erry day. Depends on class of course - Lock, Spriest and Mage benefit more from the + damage stats imo
---
Nothing announced? We got two fairly big blue posts in the past two weeks...one outlining the phases in which content will be released. Pretty significant if you ask me.
---
Sent you a PM!
---
Except that's not allowed either, as per the thread this post is referencing.
---
Can I get a summary before I randomly click links that may require eye bleach?
---
Spirit isn't half bad if you are playing a druid or priest(they are able to utilize mana regen in combat). Int isn't half bad on paladins either because they want crit+ high mana pool.
---
How good comparably? It's kinda hard to say. For a caster though, int is pretty shit. In terms of DPS for a mage, 8 int = 1 SP. But that's ofc assuming no mana issues. 
---
I'm not telling people how they should play the game, I'm telling them how not to play the game, i.e. do something shitty knowing it's shit and then expect others to carry them.
---
Sent you a PM.
---
People still play retail wow? Lol....
---
I'm pretty sure his point wasn't that minmaxers are the only ones thinking about other people than themselves.
---
Vanilla wow with TBC itemisation and class specs is my wet dream. Those are by far the best thing the expansion brought to the table.
---
It’s also kind of like dreaming of winning the lottery when you don’t play; impossible.
---
Don't worry. His bosa will understand if you tell him you need time to Roleplay a Tauren.
---
LF literally this exact guild except Horde.
---
Depends on class, race and situation.
---
all these elitist minmaxers still keyboard turn anyways lol
---
Generally you just want to stack the crap out of power. You can plug running oom with consumables and buffs in raids, but if your spellpower is low you’ll suck no matter what you do.
---
Having played on both on pservers:
---
I think there's some good stuff done to hybrid classes. I personally like the hybrid tax but assuming I was against it, then the way classes been buffed is pretty good. However way too much would need to be changed to fix itemization for these specs. And honestly it all breaks PVP a lot. BG's in TBC are garbage because of all the hybrids. 
---
As for abilities and such? Honestly not that much is even changed. Spellsteal for mages sounds nice until you realize people have prebuffs and that just makes it annoying. Ice lance is kinda silly because of how OP the damage is but the constant of nova breaking from other people ruins it. Rogues just get way too much garbage overpowered abilities, warlocks are retarded in pvp and pve but not so much because of new abilities just SL SL being broken. Warriors spellsteal is fucking amazing and I wish that was a thing in vanilla though. Esp because warriors struggle so much with for mages warlocks and priest. 
---
Shhhh!  We don't need any more competition for gear!  :P  All joking aside, for me the fun comes with the shape-shifting.  I love being able to adapt on the fly to the situation at hand.  I revel in PvP'ing as a feral druid.  Classic cannot come soon enough!
---
Jacked? You mean *ripped*.
---
This is a great analogy that more than likely went over a bunch of peoples heads lol 
---
Gnomish for better teleport I guess.
---
Goblin if you actually want to craft shit to make money or save a penny. 
---
It really doesn't matter too much. 
---
&gt; Also consider that Koreans killed Onyxia 10 days after they had their game released
---
Keep in mind, Koreans kept their beta characters.
---
Yes it's build on speculation, of course it is. But it's realistic. And there's nothing wrong with every single person interested in wow trying it out. That's cool, the game isn't for everyone, and that isn't a negative thing. The problem is just for blizzard to handle the launch so that people can see what the game is all about, and the dedicated players won't get fucked by it. 
---
If he did, that should be an instant ban.
---
Starting with a few little bags instead of a set of Netherweave ones will be one thing that gets me talking. 'Hi...can you please make me a linen bag, I have the mats!'
---
This may be the best and most logical response I’ve seen on the topic. Thank you for the response.
---
I think up to MC 2H Fury is acceptable as people are getting geared out and transitioning away from 2H weapons into dw onehanders but I wouldn't expect many 2Hers past that. Fury lends itself to DW far more. Unbridled Wrath, DW Spec, Flurry, and Bloodthirst.(and Enrage but that's upon getting critted) all lend themselves to DW. 2H Fury will find that they just don't get the best usage out of those procs.
---
Those comments lmao
---
The breath can be entirely avoided by hugging the correct part of the walls when she does breath.
---
FR only necessary if the raid doesn't have two brain cells combined to rub together.
---
You mentioned garona, but she was not the only devious actor in the original warcraft.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Brigand_(Warcraft_I)
---
Druid, statistically.
---
I think this about warlocks. Especially alliance ones. You've got the Slaughtered Lamb, the minion quests...epic stuff.
---
My man I honestly hope you do everything else in your life with the enthusiasm you have when min/maxing on a damn game 
---
&gt; and then expect others to carry them.
---
See, it's this part that I'm just not seeing. Where are non-minmaxers expecting to be carried?
---
Interestingly though, on my pserver, whose name sounds like Crow’s Nose 3, shaman is the second most played class on horde behind warrior.
---
What is the hard part about it? Making sure that the mobs stay on you and not other people?
---
Blizzard tends to drop random announcements in their Q/As 
---
For sure, Warlocks are a very well fleshed out class in 1.12, the minion quests and the mount quests are amazing. (I actually never did the epic mount quest, but I hear it's awesome). 
---
But do you guys have your own zone?! I think not! :P 
---
I think the issue stems from being told by another player "you can't play as that spec if you want to raid."
---
Enchanting is a complete waste and does nothing for your character.
---
You could go herb, have enough gold to buy all your enchants, and make far far more gold than you would with enchanting.
---
Taking enchanting vs herb and just buying enchants will give you less gold total.
---
Enchanting is a gold sink at every stage of the game.
---
He obviously has no idea what he's talking about.
---
Make servers with the same name but numbered so that if they end up dead just merge em. Server merges could fix the population spike and collapse.
---
You want to be rich foverer? Take alch + herb.
---
Take a look at some pserver stats and you might change your mind on this. Hunter is far from the bottom. And that’s the more hardcore players. More casual players coming in won’t know all this about raid slots. Remember in actual vanilla how many hunters there were?
---
Why would I play a game if I didn't like playing the game?
---
&gt; Where are non-minmaxers expecting to be carried?
---
Everywhere they go with other players?
---
dwarf master race confirmed
---
I genuinely don't get it though, why do you care? Are you scared that some casual will ruin the game for you? I mean that's why hardcore guilds exist. You don't get a say on what people do or don't do. You can only choose who you want to play with. If I want to RP a mage that wants his target to be at the perfect temperature and only cast alternating fireball and frostbolt then that's on me, I might not get invited to many serious groups but that's not your problem now, is it?
---
&gt;:(
---
On these forums? Can you provide a link? It sounds like you're talking out your ass since you're not providing sources. Sounds like you're just paranoid. 
---
A high effort post with iron clad points on this sub? Downvoted.
---
I PvPed on a low pop RP server during retail Vanilla and had absolutely no problems without cross realm queues. We all knew each other to a degree and saw each other in the open world.
---
My friend group had multiple r14s, I myself only made it to r10 due to time constraints.
---
There was never a complaint about queues or anything.
---
The *day* cross realm bgs came out, we no longer knew anyone who PvPed. All faceless matchmade strangers.
---
People are salty people are making maps and posting it here on this sub. It’s not like we have much else to post 
---
Great argument
---
100% agreed.  SPOT ON.
---
Well I played rogue in vanilla and twinked my druid late tbc. I fell instantly in love with the class. Sometimes I would make the tree and heal, but sometimes people wanted to go zul Aman and asked if I could tank.
---
When people write that they have to heal, that is a none issue. I will also tank np. I think what I love about the class is, that I can fill out anything, this class shines if you want to be versitile. 
---
But my main goal is to get back to naxx. And I know, if I want to be a powerful healer and lift my weight, I got to go priest. This class is the best healer for me.
---
But druid is for sure a class too easily overlooked and can bring so much to the table, especially in pvp where you can use every single skill. 
---
How so? If I can get 30 hours in on the weekend, I can easily get 10 hours spread out from monday to friday with a full time job as well. 
---
You just wouldn't have a lot of time left for other stuff :)
---
Silence Shot was garbo, Survial Hunter was way better at locking down things (Wyvern &gt; Silence).  
---
Druid went from full gimp mana-bot, to pvp dominance.  One of the most drastic overhauls.  
---
Mage - 100% Agree here  
---
Paladin - TBC Ret was 'fine', TBC 'prot' was a druid-level overhaul  
---
Priest - Same as TBC Ret, TBC Mana Burn was broken though.  
---
Rogue - CloS was just another F U to Rogue v Caster, and removed all timing for stealth iirc.  
---
Warrior - classic warriors were mostly fine, maybe some scaling issues with rage on the high and low ends.  
---
Shaman - not much exp pre-tbc  
---
Warlock - UA was so mandatory in PvP it felt like it should have been a default ability.  The DoT vs Cleanse meta required skill and timing, and modern WoW just said NOPE 6s ugly stacking cooldown shit.
---
Naw dude this fixation with optimal performance for some imagined community betterment is fucking wild. The reality is vanilla wow is just not that serious and people who want to play night elf priests or gnome warriors are not hurting or inconveniencing anyone. If you fucking care that much you don't have to invite them to your MC pug or whatever but many people are going to rightly mock you for treating what is at this point fairly easy content by mmo standards so seriously. 
---
If you thought this way about like, pursuing a career in life. Say disapproving of a friend's desire to be an artist when he could be a doctor or something, just as a hypothetical, I would say it's misguided but that there's a logic to that thought process. Being this puritan about classic wow race choices is fucking crazy though. 
---
See, I understand your viewpoint but where do you draw the line? When are you "min-maxing enough"? Are some classes selfish because there are other better classes? Are you selfish if you don't use all consumeables when the boss is already super easy for your group?
---
The mechanics are actually easier with less people. We consistently downed ony with 20 in vanilla. 30 is almost to many. 40 is ridiculous. She doesn't do much and there is no enrage timer. And no need for fr. 2 healers can keep the tank up just fine. And 1 healer for the tards that cant position correctly. 
---
what are you doing in azeroth? go back to new eden!
---
Will i have issues healing in dungeons/raids? I know i wanna play a healer and definitely want to raid but thematically i love paladin and druid but im scared of being left behind if i don't go priest (although i wouldn't mind priest)
---
Is it genuinely this surprising to hear someone care about other players?
---
&gt; You can only choose who you want to play with
---
&gt; I might not get invited to many serious groups 
---
Careful now, you're getting very close to acting like people who enjoy minmaxing are allowed to decide who they want to play with, which is against the popular opinion in the other thread.
---
&gt; If I want to RP a mage that wants his target to be at the perfect temperature and only cast alternating fireball and frostbolt then that's on me
---
Well as long as it is on you and you don't bring that stuff when you're playing with strangers then I have no issues with what you're doing, why would I care?
---
Words honestly dont do it justice
---
Mobs?
---
I'm coming back so I can say DING and put a point into a talent node.
---
I don't give a shit about raiding anymore. Been there, done that. Realm firsts, pushing top US rankings, etc etc. I just want to run around and farm and fuck around with other people doing the same. Then I want to log off knowing I have no commitments and look forward to the next session. 
---
Whats wrong witg "of course" ?
---
Did they use mc to get kings or what am I missing? 
---
I was thinking about warlock and spriest earlier today. 
---
&gt; They buff eachothers damage
---
&gt; Same walk speed
---
&gt; VW tank, both can dps and off heal the vw, so essentially a full group that could clear any elite quest.
---
Probably because you’re a virgin
---
Definitely not in dungeons, and depends on what you mean by "left behind" if you mean literally left behind, as in not taken on raids, absofuckinglutely not. Guilds absolutely need druids, (bunch of utility such as mark of the wild and brez among other things) and druids aren't played that often so it's honestly quite easy to find a raid spot if you're even half decent. 
---
In terms of raw numbers, you'll probably be behind priests, but as long as everyone's staying full health, that's what's important IMO. 
---
Additionally, I don't have experience as Paladin but I've heard several times here that they outheal even priests (although I suspect that's in relatively lame cloth gear, which feels silly when you want to be a badass battle healer holy warrior). 
---
This is somewhat of a generalization, but here goes:
---
* while leveling, prioritize spirit (for regen) then int then stam
---
* while in early endgame, prioritize +heal, but don't sacrifice individual pieces with good +heal but bad int/spirit until you collectively have more than ~250 +heal on your gear
---
* depending on your spec, spirit may or may not contribute additional +heal so its importance is situational. you will be in combat for longer but also have more opportunities to drink so it's no longer as important
---
* for short endgame encounters (dungeon bosses, trash, raid bosses on farm) intellect and +heal are king
---
* for longer endgame encounters you will be regenning and potting on cooldown so int isn't as important as +mp5 and +heal
---
**tl;dr** - +heal is godly but there is a minimum threshold you have to pass for it to be really useful and start to outbalance int. mp5 is also clutch in later fights. spirit's usefulness depends on your spec.
---
Missing Uther’s tomb and the barns at the fields :(
---
What is debuff limit for 100 Alex?
---
It's coming out in August
---
that checks out. 
---
O fuck I forgot about the great Shaman Review and all the memes.
---
spell power tends to be about 6 good where as spirit and int are 4.5 good each 
---
Wait, I think I misunderstood your question.
---
Are you asking where the people wanting to get carried are, or where they want to be carried?
---
Loot trading and sharding is the only difference, but if you think about it and don't overthink it, it's nothing major. (Sharding WOULD be something major and game breaking if they extended it's use  from what they've said now).
---
Sharding early zones would still make them insane with a lot of people, but you would be able to play instead of crashing, disconnects, world server down. How is that a bad thing, and it's something we'll have for a smooth launch in the start. Nothing that "changes" vanilla in the long run, nothing you'll experience when you're even lvl 12. And only way you'll notice it, is that the servers won't crash.
---
Loot trading already existed but took 4-5 days though GMs. Having it automated is just a smart move by Blizzard.
---
The gameplay, scripts, health on bosses, armor on bosses, everything in the entire game will be "Blizzlike" as most pservers call it.
---
Everything in the game will be exactly as vanilla was, even the graphics if you  choose to, except for that you can solve wrongly given loot faster (which still existed in vanilla through GMs) and have a smooth launch.
---
Every pserver have a lot of things wrong. Especially loot drops (a lot higher droprate even if they say 1x), gold drops, spawn rates etc. Basic things are wrong on every Pserver I've played.
---
You'd be surprised how many players just want to quest without incident. I won't engage players unless they look hostile and on private servers rarely end up in any form of PvP while levelling. 
---
Each to their own, I have no issue defending myself or potentially being killed but PvP isn't everyone's primary drive while levelling. 
---
Even that was fine because paladins could stop them from moving over 100% MS, until they complained so hard they could even shift out of that.
---
Can’t spell boomkin without oom.
---
You'll never do any jumping jacks because people never use "DM" for a Dire Maul wing
---
I leveled to 60 on a PvP server, I'm not doing that again
---
You mention that Druid tanks in raiding are rare. Isn't it like that only in the sense that there's usually only 1 druid off tank? I mean, you'd probably have to find a guild that needs it, but most guilds need at least 1 dedicated bear, right? Like if I tank BiS up my bear, no one will scoff at me trying to join a guild as an off tank, right? 
---
I hear there are good tanking and healing hybrid specs all in one as well.
---
Literally no one.
---
I mean shit, who had a 40 yard pull as a tank back then?  
---
The taunt thing is one thing, but the range is the other.  Also so many 'OH SHIT' moments with our overaggressive prot paladin during multi mob tank swaps.
---
Not sure why I’m gettIng downvoted. There was a fishing competition that awarded a title of “salty.”  I’m not making any insults here. 
---
Because min maxers only think fun is derived from numbers, dps logs, and human competition.  Everyones pushing for world firsts and optimized raids, when this is a super old game and only a small fraction even care about that bs.  And world firsts mean nothing more than that you have a lot of free time.  Vanilla has always been about the community, the mental fortitude to build, grow, and maintain the core group you play with.  Its never been about the end, its always been about the journey.  
---
Do you like playing with kobe bryant on your team?  Do you like him telling you how to play and always pushing your buttons everyday?  Do you like to win more games than not but kinda hate yourself and others a bit more?  Or do you like playing pickupball with your scrub friends?  If i was a professional it might be different, but i play games to chill and relax from the struggles of everyday life.  We already have cs and dota and overwatch for hypercompetitive gaming... thats brainwashing our newer generations of gamers into thinking there is only one way to do things.  People that tell others and judge them for how they spend their freetime are zeroes in my book.    
---
engineering requires lots of ore aka mining, so i'll either drop eng and pick up alchemy, or drop herb and pick up mining.
---
No one is selfish cause they want to play something they enjoy while also raiding. Ffs you don’t have to be a human rogue to raid. If you want to be a gnome rogue that’s awesome you aren’t selfish for doing so.
---
If your guild thinks you are then you are in the wrong guild. Classic/vanilla doesn’t require 40 min mixers to clear content. Maybe for late late end game but sure as hell not for Anything pre AQ40.
---
I live in northern Sweden and there is still 70cm of snow outside, I surely hope they go by Florida summer standards... :)
---
No way, locks are awesome 
---
I mean, using this scenario you could go to Westfall and advertise for DM but really be running any other dungeon in the game, not just Dire Maul. No one says "DM" meaning a Dire Maul run. 
---
Plus or Minus 2 Weeks within July 2nd, 2019
---
In those days mp5 trumped everything, end of story.
---
Spirit you had to stop casting for 5+s, +SP was rare and went to damage casters, +Heal was even more rare (BC exclusive iirc, where it became ubiquitous.).  
---
You are still a hybrid if you focus on feral tree. Not only is feral the DPS and the Tank spec, you can, and still will be the main healer in a 5man or provide offhealing when needed.
---
I doubt he brought up the girlfriend as an example of a BAD loot council decision due to her being a literal god gamer and getting loot she rightfully deserved....
---
Well yeh, naturally, but it's like
---
virgin virgin vs. chad virgin
---
No one runs all wings....literally no group ever will do this.
---
I think both sides have a point but as long as they can find guilds that match their expectations it isn’t a problem,
---
If a minmaxer joins a casual guild or dungeon group that isn’t using consumables and invites ret paladins and such then he shouldn’t expect the guild/group to conform to his ideals. He/she is free to leave.
---
On the other hand, if ret paladin wants to join a group or a guild but gets rejected because of his spec then he shouldn’t get angry either for the same reason. He/she is free to make his own group or guild and will likely have a better time doing so.
---
What was that music again? It was very prominent in classic, was it the login?
---
I played in a DKP guild in Wotlk. I would never do that in Vanilla. It makes no sense with the loot you get in raids with so much cross-over between tank/dps, healers/dps and pve/pvp and rare bis and legendaries on top of that. And then you have all between raid activites and world buffs etc... Good luck in having a fair and fun credit based system in Vanilla. You will need it.
---
Nah, I will play in a Loot Council guild. That way every drop will be used in the optimal way for the guild based on all factors.
---
Tbh, the Chad objectively sounds more like a virgin.
---
Apex had no streamers? Didn't they pay ninja a ton of money to stream it? Would think he wasn't the only one.
---
Well for example, Feral was a Rogue with less abilities, but also mana and 2 hotbars.
---
I think think that given tbc talents which we had for a couple of months would make alot of raiding alot easier one of the most important changes in tbc was raid size. Given the opportunity to have shadow priests in mana users group or elemental shaman and boomkin in mage groups fights will be almost trivial. When you give classes eaven more utility and make there damage competitive you need to make raids smaller aswell
---
What i see is that free rolls for everything can work in mc.  Your more dedicated players will leave at the end of mc and starting bwl when they see little timmy taking an item your dedicated players wanted.  After so many times, your guild will lose good players to a system that rewards their time and effort, and your free roll system will attract players who put in little effort.  It gets tiring after a while from what ive seen.  It turns more into a pug than a guild vibe.

I'm confused about this thinking. Do you expect everyone to roll warrior mage and priest?  
---
There's no better tank/mdps than warrior
---
There's no better aoe/rpds than mage (except warlock later)
---
There's no better healer than priest.  
---
People hate minmaxers because they are jelly. They would if they knew how but don't want to invest any time or effort into getting good. "15 year old game who cares hur dur!"
---
As a random guy on the internet have I got the perfect life plan for you OP. Drop out of college and move back in mom's basement and pick up crystal meth for extra min-maxing efficiency. /s
---
Or you can could play retail *shudders* 
---
they still do these for that dogshit expansion they call BFA?
---
Yeah wtf is that. I do it for the loot crates.

Lc is the best when the officer core are trustworthy.  Dkp is easily gamed and rewards attendance over whats best for the guild.  Sk is by far the worst.  Sk creates drama because your good players are not rewarded and typically bis items dont go to your bis players, and progression takes a big hit when the first t2 pants goes to a new guy
---
Why do you hate yourself?

That's a lot of time, but most vanilla classes change so significantly between 20 and 30 that they don't feel the same at all.
---
:bobbyk:
---
Vanilla doesn't contain titles besides PvP ranks. :)
---
You might want to take up tailoring instead of engineering. Keep it until 60 craft your chest and a couple of bags drop it and take up engineering ones more as a mage you don't really need engineering while levelling so only pick it uf you are going pvp
---
RELEASE DATE PLS. 
---
I. CAN'T. WAIT.
---
Do you think we will actually get an oceanic located server? Didnt even have that in original vanilla!!
---
They so late with the release date... i don't think the game will come before august.
---
Yeah that’s called Aggro or threat in wow. (Not sure if you played any other mmos so I’m doing a simple explanation) the only tank in vanilla with a taunt (single target aggro/threat generator) is warrior. There are other reasons why they are the best tanks, but that’s the one I see most common.
---
Also, it’s hard to keep threat in vanilla moreso than retail (current) wow, because when you’re a low-mid level warrior you pretty much can only auto attack (not using spells/abilities) because your rage (warriors resource used to use said abilities (like mana,energy, etc)) generation is awful. 
---
Furthermore, and this isn’t really gameplay wise but more social, dungeoning with pugs (pick up groups, random people you don’t know/are on your friends list) in vanilla is different in retail wow. In vanilla, there is no group finder. You have to talk to people or advertise a group. You’ll often see LFXM (Looking for x number more, sometimes with a role after - example, LF1M tank gtg — In this case that means they have 4 people with the last slot needed being a tank then they are good to go (gtg)). Anyways, vanilla requires you getting those people together and running to the dungeon, which can take quite a bit of time before you even pull the first mob. 
---
Now all that, sorry I’m rambling but I’m tired and have homework, if someone feels their tank is incompetent and let’s say dies on the first boss they will leave. This is because they don’t want to waste more time than they already have. Now, in retail if someone leaves it’s not a big deal at all as you can queue up and wait for someone of that role to join. In vanilla though, you have to stop what you’re doing, leave the dungeon and find another role of whatever. Not only on your end, but it’s very very rare that someone will join when the dungeon is almost cleared. 
---
Hopefully that was a good enough explanation. Lemme know if you need it cleared up. 
---
&gt;  When are you "min-maxing enough"? 
---
I mean, that depends on the context, but IMO in general as far as pugging is concerned, once you start having to put effort into it outside of the bare minimum of consumables (i.e. poisons, ammo and maybe a lower tier health potion), you're doing fine.
---
I'm personally spamming sapper charges and potions nearly on cooldown, but I get that not everyone enjoys farming those things, so I understand they wont do it.
---
&gt; Are some classes selfish because there are other better classes?
---
Which class is worse than others? Genuinely curious, because as far as I'm aware there isn't any.
---
&gt; Are you selfish if you don't use all consumeables when the boss is already super easy for your group?
---
That's between you and your guild in all honesty and as such is outside the scope of what we're (at least what I'm intending to discuss (i.e. pugging)). With that said though, if the norm in your guild is that no one (or very few) are using potions, then no, I wouldn't consider it selfish, however if you were in a guild where the norm were everyone used every consumable and you didn't, yea I'd say that's selfish.
---
even facebook normies hate retail WoW.
---
That was so close to TBC. I know technically it's vanilla but that would also mean LFG tool, 41 point talents, etc all are Vanilla too. But yeah, I'd totally forgotten they dropped right before TBC.
---
Of course!
---
So basically a group of people get hated on, because of a few people who missbehave.
---
This sounds familiar. 
---
One way to fix the itemization problem is just to have a one-way tier gear turn in system (similar to the tier 0.5 quest turn in). So you could have druids (and shamans and paladins) have the ability to turn their tier gear into their tier 0.5 dealer for a feral/enhancement/ret statted version. 
---
No. I think because the ratio is still 4:1 for tanks spots it might be super balanced and quick to find a spot. Also don’t forget, a lot of people are going to demand they are dps only (not me)
---
No there was no option for it, but BGs didn’t give any xp.
---
I'd say 30 should be enough.
---
The hard will be to have enough people with the attunement more than the stuff.   
---
&gt; The reality is vanilla wow is just not that serious
---
I completely disagree, the entire point of vanilla as far as I'm concerned is that you can be serious and have fun at the same time.
---
&gt;  If you fucking care that much you don't have to invite them to your MC pug or whatever 
---
Careful, that goes against the popular opinion in this thread.
---
&gt; Say disapproving of a friend's desire to be an artist when he could be a doctor or something, just as a hypothetical, I would say it's misguided but that there's a logic to that thought process.
---
Again, I disagree, it has no impact on me whether he's a doctor or an artist, yet it has a massive impact on him, so that's none of my business.
---
Not even close.
---
Please do keep ik mind that consumables will not be as viable (most probably) as theyvare on private servers.
---
There will probably be less spawns for herbs and such. And high end guild will also probably camp the spawn locations of these herbs ;( -JustVanillaThings
---
I haven't played on any private servers so I don't know, it sounds like that might be the case there. I'm just reiterating my experience in vanilla here. 
---
I hate to break it to you but you need to lose more than you realise. It's what every single guy discovers when they cut down. Here's a photo of me at 212lb and 6'1" with my abs coming through : [https://imgur.com/a/2Xqnq#TkYdB1u](https://imgur.com/a/2Xqnq#TkYdB1u) I still have over 30lb to lose in that photo. You're also going to be much smaller than you realise. If I tried to cut down for something like a bodybuilding competition I'd be dropping 50lb from that photo....
---
I think its stormwinds theme music
---
I've seen a "4DHORDE"
---
This actually made me laugh, thanks.
---
If you want to get a date you shouldn't be playing Classic WoW amirite
---
Gonna be fun doing Garr without locks, being unable to clear enrages without hunters, doing supression room without rogues all while gimping your dps, hps and hp due to lack of buffs.
---
Hey it's me you
---
Legion release date was announce April 18th didn’t come out till August 30th.
---
WoD’s announcement was August 14th and came out November 13th.
---
MoP’s announcement was July 25th and came out September 25th.
---
Cata’s announcement was October 4th and came out December 7th.
---
WoTLK’s announcement was September 15th and came out November 13th.
---
BC’s announcement was Nov 9th and came out January 16th.
---
Yeah, and it's a damned shame.  I mean, to be clear, I didn't hate **all** of Classic.  I had a great time levelling and doing other things.  But that part did really sour me.
---
You respect them but call them trash ?
---
I'd go herb/tailoring or herb/skinning for gold until 60 then herb/tailoring for the Trufaith Vestiments and then herb/alch 
---
Alternatively, herb/alch is fun by itself even while levelling, and the potions can be handy.
---
And I get called plenty of names too, I own them.
---
I mean yeah, but this is basically the same points we've all made a bazillion times. Still, always nice to hear it again I guess.
---
In a way, yeah.  I have read good things, thankfully.  I always had a feeling Cat Feral wasn't *that* bad, but the game still doesn't support it.  I definitely knew Bear Feral wasn't particularly bad, at least.  And to clarify, I didn't hate **all** of Classic.  That part just really soured me.
---
Btw, that last thing you said literally did happen to me sometimes but for bad reasons like a raid leader without confidence or not attending for the night. :P  But yeah, having raided 2005-2014, I totally understand how tanks are looked on as the leaders just due to how their role works, whether they want that or not.
---
In pve context, if you go feral you will do everything, you will tank when needed, heal when needed, decurse when needed and dps. Being a true hybrid with the ability to do multiple job is really fun.
---
Hah! Glad to hear it. Definitely one of the best parts of TBC for me honestly. 
---
If it's on a fresh server, you are the best since what matter is how fast you can tag something and you got moonfire, instant cast with big range.
---
add to that the idiocy of wasting several hours each week on preparations only so you can cut your raid time 30 mins short.
---
which ironically should be the fun part of the game.
---
Hey my pleasure buddy! Glad you enjoyed it :). 
---
I suppose videos like these are aimed at the newbie/retail crowd
---
&gt;Bear tanking is nice to be able to do, but just doesn't feel as good as warrior tanking - you just have less buttons. 
---
This is not true. When ur a feral druid you are not simply a tank. You are a DPS, a off-tank and a healer/decurser all at once.  
---
Say you are doing Gehennas. You start by tanking one of the adds, when the add is dead you switch to cat form and do DPS, when curses come up you change form and start decursing, when curses are gone you go catform again.  
---
There is no other class that can do this, druids truely are a hybrid class. 
---
I cant wait for this
---
This makes me almost worried about wanting to remake my dorf hunter and gnome warrior/warlock if the retail mindset has bled into classic and 'min max or gtfo'
---
I honestly don't know if I will be able to play classic. It's a big question mark for me. I mean, I know I'll play the shit out of it for a week, maybe a month, but can I really grind to level 60? Am I really going to have the mental ability to even get near the point of seeing raid content?
---
That's the beauty of it - I really don't know how far I'm going to get. I might try to see the content I didn't ever see, like AQ40 or Naxx, but I also might decide "fuck this shit" at level 16 and then that will be that. I see both sides of the "classic was just homework and chores and terrible QoL for metered out slow rewards, and these rewards don't mean anything now that you've earned them once" argument. I mean, 13 years ago I was motivated to just SEE Rag and SEE Nefarian, and that pushed me to put up with all the farming and grinding for days on end with no end in sight. But I've seen them now, so I honestly don't know what will motivate me or if I'll be able to do it. 
---
And I get the flip side. The whole fun of classic is that there's not a carrot on a stick for everything you should do. You want to see gnomeragan, go see it. You don't want to, don't see it. Your gain/loss. You want to down C'thun in a hardcore raiding guild, be ready to farm consumables and do the various HW to earn your keep in a hardcore raiding guild. If you don't want to do that, then you don't down C'thun and that's OK too. 
---
I just don't even know what my story is going to be in classic wow. Which was the magic of vanilla the first time around. I quit my first time around at level 43 in Desolace. I just gave up on leveling and was like "I am never going to join all my friends in MC, its not happening, I missed the boat." But then I powered through after a break and some 12 months later, I downed Nef and was even considering leaving my beloved guild for a hardcore guild that was deep in Naxx / AQ40. I had changed from a casual gamer to a hardcore gamer that frequented elitist jerks during class breaks. 
---
Now I am a casual gamer again. I can't play more than like 3 games of League without feeling mental fog and boredom, and I barely play more than 2-3 hrs of WoW a week. 
---
Will this game inspire me to be middle of the road? Hardcore? Casual RPer? Quit after 2 weeks because it's soulcrushingly empty and nostalgia only took me so far?
---
I just don't know. Some people know what they want to do in classic wow, and that's great for them. But for everyone who's not sure -- just embrace that. You didn't know you were going to be the grand poobah of Ironforge in marshall gear when you killed your first trogg. You didn't know you were going to be a toxic ganking rogue, or a raid leader, or a friendly mentor to someone, or a auction whiz, or whatever it is. You don't have to go in with a plan. Just make a goofy toon and see what happens. 
---
I'll echo what some others have said here and say the fight actually feels easier with less people. It just takes longer, if you aren't shy with consumable usage though the fight should be pretty trivial. Splitting the fight (doing 2 20-man raids) was pretty common in vanilla. By the time we had some AQ gear we were basically doing it with between 8-10 people to farm bags. 
---
People also cascaded her constantly but I'm still really hoping that won't be possible in Classic. 
---
There was real tank competition in wotlk
---
4 classes actually strong tanks
---
&gt; The hate being based on jealousy or envy
---
you only like to tell yourself that to feed your own ego.  
---
Warlock or druid probably.
---
Druid because it's a weird master of non type class and warlock because people don't enjoy being portal slaves and/or it isn't mage so its bad
---
I'm a mage. If I minmax everything I do more damage than pvp build mages.
---
I'll play in higher guilds because of this. I'll get good gear because of it. And once I'm decked in epics...
---
I swap to a memebuild! Pom pyro'ing in BG's. Deep frost for the 1v3 vurtne plays or elemental mage if I feel like it.
---
New scenario.... I'm a druid.
---
I roll resto druid so I'm as usefull as posible that my class can be. I minmax to stay on top and raid in a good guild because of this. Guess what.. I'm now in full tier2!
---
So what now.. I swap to memebuild! I'm now a lazerchicken in full tier 2 recking every gearless enhancement shaman, shadowpriest, feraldruid and other gearless "filthy casuals"*.
---
There are diffrent ways to enjoy the game. I personally love to be in a server top guild and be geared to the bone. To be able to achieve it I do what it takes. And guess what... doing what it takes IS the fun for me!
---
*its a joke, chill :)
---
Elitist can be a bit more nice and patient sometimes.
---
Casuals need realistic expectations.
---
For 5 mans tanks will be in huge demand
---
For raids it will be very hard. Guilds dont need many and they likely already have them as gm or officers. 
---
Minus the 
---
"Gnome for all classes it can be" joke
---
NE-Druid
---
Dwarf-Hunter/warrior
---
Gnome-Mage/lock/rogue
---
Human-priest/pally
---
Hoard would be
---
Orc-Warrior
---
Undead-Rogue/warlock/mage
---
Tauren-Shaman/druid
---
Troll-Hunter/Rogue
---
For 5 mans and small raids yeah
---
For 40 mans no
---
The hard part is having the money to sustain it
---
Its expensive af and you are a weak farmer
---
Argh, this alone makes me question the choice of going PvE this time around.
---
Im so salty its not on pc
---
I always kept my MC raid buffed with unending breath... *Just in case.*
---
your problem is your perspective.  
---
you only see PvE and raids. the game is more than that.
---
gnome and dwarf rogue are the best choice for PvP for example.  
---
I would feel way more trolled if a human in PvP sucks ass because he cant get rid of poisons or slows.  
---
PvE in vanilla is so basic anyway that you can do w/e the fuck you want and get away with it.
---
solution for you, find an all PvE guild with no one in it who is even remotely interested in PvP and you'll get what you want. everyone speccing and gearing purely for PvE performance.
---
I'll stick to layed back PvP/PvE guilds who enjoy each and every part of the game equally and accept that this already beaten game is not a chore, but a spare time activity.
---
Yikes.  How to go from 100% attractive to completely undesirable in an instant, you say?  That sticker, that's how
---
No need for respecs
---
Play the versatile hotw spec and you fill any role
---
Minmax - level with mining+skinning, take engeneering+tailering max level.
---
Pvp - mining + engenering
---
Rp fitting - tailering + enchanting
---
Money - herbalism + alchemy
---
Pick what you like :)
---
Who?
---
Yeah obviously you can personally take any game as seriously as you want. But interpretating other people's unoptimized choices as inconsiderate or as even minor misbehavior is absurd. Given how low the stakes are and how small the impact.
---
Can I tank non-raid content as a feral druid?
---
I’m getting married and going on a two week honeymoon, it’ll be my first holiday for ten years. I can almost guarantee you that classic will launch on my wedding day and I’ll miss the first two weeks of classic. 
---
Obviously there’s no comparison to the two events, at the end of the day it’s a once in a lifetime day that I’ve been looking forward to for 10 years and the other is a wedding. 
---
Cost 149g on the ah ? Because it's really not the same on a fresh server, especially the official one will have a really different economy
---
The Horde Ford. 
---
I joined a rebirth guild of an old aq40 raiding guild aiming for naxx this time. Pritty serieus guild.
---
We will use DKP.
---
There will always be people minmaxing in a game like this. 
---
The beauty of classic, in my opinion is that there is room for everyone. Every HC and even semi HC guild will tell what they require by their members. You are no way compelled to join them. Majority of the guilds will be casual. Let the hardcore people play the game like they want, and you play as you want. Just dont expect to get into one of the high end raiding guilds with a meme spec. 
---
There is a place for everyone in the game, whether you just love leveling and never complete a single attunement quest at 60, or you like playing your twink, or you just like to do the 60 dungeons and never worry about a thing.
---
See that core raider of a HC guild in your capital with all the neat gear you have never heard of, dont feel bad. The guy just worked his ass for it. If you want the same gear you will have to make the same sacrifices as he did. You should play the game the way you want, there is a good market, thanks to everyone playing the game different way. You need money, you pick flowers and sell them, the buyer is a minmaxer that needs them to progress further in the game. You progress by gaining wealth, he progresses in further content.
---
The reason i will join a semi HC guild, is that i dont have as much time as i used to 15 years ago. I want my raids to be done in a timely fashion. A non optimized raid with a few meme specs and pugs in pvp spec can clear MC or even BWL, they just will take hours to do them. Where your optimized group with proper specs and gear will do the same job in 30 minutes.
---
Fun thing is, that in a min maxing guild several people will have to play support roles. If I, as a priest main, would want to hit the world record for #1 healing done, i wouldn't be playing in a group that takes nearly no damage, kills the bosses too fast to get on any sort of HPS ranking and so on. It would be much better to join a pug that has a long fight and people that cant move from fire on the ground. Instead i want the whole raid to be success, and have the fast clear time, to see my guild name up in the leaderboards, and to show out my accomplishments in ogrimmar.
---
Don’t worry, the entirety of this sub will be **surprised pikachu** when they realize it’s not about classic, despite the fact that this exact thing has happened a dozen times before. 
---
&gt;  Given how low the stakes are and how small the impact.
---
You can't just put those two and say that's all that matters, if I someone offered to give save the children $5 for blinking twice I'd also consider you inconsiderate if you didn't do it, despite the small impact... effort required also matters.
---
You could pay me to play BfA. But too little pay or too many hours, no deal.
---
No expansion has had a shorter life than 21 months. We haven’t even had an announcement of the last patch in BfA and no word on the new wexpansion (should be announced at blizzcon this year) 
---
Source: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline_(World_of_Warcraft)
---
If you have an active retail subscription, you have access to classic, as i understand it - so probably just a download.
---
&gt; Is it vastly different from retail or just different servers?
---
I'm not sure what you mean? Its different servers. The client will probably be much the same, but the content is different.
---
You will probably have to use classic specific addons.
---
At what point did BG's start to give XP?
---
I Vanilla I played with a subpar guild that was full of wipefests. In early TBC I joined a very good guild (top 50 world through TBC, some top 10 world kills) and I felt much more at home, despite leaving friends behind. In Vanilla our 40 mans had a small core group that carried most of the content. This group included tanks and some of our healers. I was a rogue and I would often find myself 50% ahead of 2nd place on the dps charts. I spent unknown hours running back because people pulling half my dps couldn't avoid fire on the ground. I would see other people with horrible specs and horrible gear, despite the countless hours I'd spent farming gold for respecs and enchants for minor upgrades. I became really resentful. In TBC I changed guilds and it was amazing. I maintained 100% raid attendance on a 6 night schedule over 18 months, keeping in mind once T6 was on farm our raid week was around 6 hours. The tanks could tank well, the dps could dps well, the healers could heal. 80% of the raid had "Gladiator" as their title. I felt like I had found my place in the world (of Warcraft). We had some of the fastest ZA runs in the world, it was so much fun.
---
Experiences vary. I found a casual attitude leading to resent when I was a min-maxer. Others like yourself might have hated the elitist attitude.
---
All my friends are playing division 2 and I’m putting ultimately pointless hours into pserver levelling. 
---
Herbalism and Engineering are perfect. Don't let the noob top comment make you think you need mining. You can easily sell the herbs to get all the ore you need and have extra profit left over.
---
Me: lf1m dps fast strath run!
---
Boomkin: inv
---
Me: nah
---
Boomkin: why not?
---
Me: whatever I say is wrong :(
---
My advise is always minmax because I can't give advise about how to play the game but I can give advise of how to be better at the game.
---
Please dont hate me for not inviting
---
I think a lot of people will quit classes that "aren't good enough" - druids, hunters, paladins.
---
Not all people have vanilla experience and they aren't aware that there are specs that are just dead, or some classes are more valuable as a utility than being very good dps/healers/tanks.
---
Should probably double a lot of those tbh
---
Shaman paladin warlock
---
They said early summer no?
---
Usualy they mention BFA somewhere, no ? It seems to be only "warcraft" here. A chance ? A hope
---
I feel like this guy may be my long lost brother.
---
Link?
---
It's kinda interesting that "pure" PvE servers are 70% Alliance and ony 30% horde, and the numbers are more healthy (60/40) on PR-PVE.
---
This is seriously an issue!
---
My employer wants to know when my vacation is going to be, and "-Ask Blizzard?" isn't a great answer in the long run.
---
Where do you people live where September is seen as summer? For me autumn starts at like end of August. Summer for me is like end May- mid August
---
Troll village on the southern coast of desolace.
---
For fucks sake this is me! I’m supposed to take a week to get my warr to 60 because I only get about 25-35 hours a week tops so I don’t have time for leveling,
---
I'm still sticking by my first guesstimation which is June 16th. 
---
*The year the World got a second chance.*
---
Wearing priesty cloths as a raiding pala sucks
---
What. On undocumented I dinged 60 yday as a mage and have 134 spell power.
---
Yeah so I levelled to 60.on private server
---
Plot twist he plays ff xiv
---
I imagine we are taking about raids right?
---
Hot yourself before going in. thorns + demoralizing roar and swipe initially. Tab + maul = great threat building. Once you build enough threat then you let people DPS.
---
&gt;chances are you will be full tier 2 before tier .5 ever becomes a thing.
---
Yeah. I get the "no changes" and all, but .5 should really be available before T1 - it was just useless for so many people when it finally came.
---
7s and 8s are the best anyway.
---
Yeah we had the raidleader warn where to move
---
Lol
---
Why
---
Love this so much.
---
Something as simple as no dungeon finder leads to incredible adventures.   Probably my biggest reason for classic.
---
\*Tank goes link dead or pisses off.  You've already spent an hour getting the group together/traveling (unless pvp happens then who knows) and a solid hour on the dungeon.   The four of you know it's either quit or try out some fancy shit.  You end up spending a lot longer finishing the dungeon with a hunter pet and/or voidwalker but everyone learns to use every single spell and ability they have overlooked and it actually works out.
---
Everyone adds to friends and you meet up for more dungeons knowing that not only are you all decent people but you have the willingness to stick it out to the end and learn as you go.   You end up meeting more people just like you and the next thing you know a really good guild is formed.
---
Classic just forces you into social interaction and that's just so much more important than anything retail can give.
---
No other melee either thrn
---
So mage
---
Itemization was so much better in TBC but RIP 40 man raids :(.
---
Not a zone, no.  There are unique areas for the quests, especially the mount quest when it comes with Dire Maul.
---
And what's the average amount of days from announcement to release?
---
Press swipe
---
Press swipe and tab if tanking more than 3 mobs
---
Press maul and swipe if you're getting crazy amount of rage
---
FF every possible target.
---
Myep for all puposes the mage is best
---
No, you can play troll druid.
---
Wait I'm confused. Isn't asmongold emperor of neckbeards?
---
Streamlined
---
wrong
---
It amazing how it can be so different. On every server I have played at Dire Maul would be referred to as "DM".
---
A bit, i have episdodes where i dont want to play at all, but my friends and i bought division 2 so now im happy playing this. i would still alt f4 no matter whats happening ingame if classic released right now.
---
Amazing painting, I saved a few for my wallpaper :P
---
Are you able to perhaps do Elwyn Forrest? I know the color is quite the opposite of this, but would look nice with your skills in oil painting
---
Playing in a guild where every single warrior, rogue and paladin is a human, every single caster is a gnome and every single priest is a dwarf doesn't sound fun for me.
---
That's where you have it land on a tower on top of UC and then down via an elevator. No more zigzagging all the way for 2 minutes to actually get in UC.
---
It does look awesome...
---
but i would pick Stranglethorn Vale,
---
a lot of trolls and a lot of a badass arena!
---
[Crank Dat Druid Boy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5W6XK6evyQ)
---
Right?  
---
When people say they are considering playing a hunter everyone says, oh just roll a mage, hunters are crap/not needed. Same for locks (but using soul shards as deterrent).  
---
When people say roll a rogue everyone says just roll a fury warrior, it has more dps and you can offtank.  
---
I feel like too many people come with a retail mindset of higher number = better class, but in reality, while you're spamming frostbolt, the hunter is removing enrages, the druid is brezzing/innervating a healer, the shaman/paladin is managing totems/buffs, all while also throwing some heals. It's because of those worse classes that raids go smooth, not your fat deeps
---
Gonna revive my Troll Hunter. 
---
Thats risky lol
---
For dungeons, definitely not. I recently leveled a Warrior preparing for classic, and from the moment I got into Ashenvale I got so many whispers asking if I wanna tank first BFD, then Stockade, and as I leveled up I got asked for new dungeons. You don’t even have to be prot, people are crazy impatient when it comes to lfg.
---
I've been trying to beat all the games I can before I get hooked on another MMO, honestly.
---
same here. i am 42 on my rogue now and its amazing. i am even fine with 'loosing' the character when classic hits. its just so much fun. and the community is just great. i dont experience any of this 'private server toxicity' many people here are talking about. 
---
little side story: when i hit 40 i was 40g short of my mount + riding. asked in /world if someone would lend me 40g, i will pay 46g back. some stranger answered me and lend me the money. he didnt knew me at all. that was sunday, yesterday i payed it back to him. its is such a great experience.
---
One huge skill you forgot to add that can provide WF: Sunder Armor, basically most tanks will use a skill capable of proccing WF on most gcds.
---
Haven't we learned from all the shit that goes on in this world that you can't judge the whole based on outliers like these giant assholes? Play how you want to play, join a large group of like minded individuals called a guild and enjoy your experience.
---
yeah pretty much, thanks for the feed back ill try and make more unkown fun facts about wow, cant wait for summer!!
---
Isn’t there still confusion as to how armor debuffs stacked in vanilla though? From what I’ve heard we just really can’t know exactly how it worked back then, so they could have reduced effectiveness.
---
You are clueless mate 
---
I’m going to play human rogue like I did back in the day. I can’t wait to get to level 14 and get that defias mask so I can walk around like a bad ass. 
---
My first Character on maxlevel was a human Rogue. I will roll an undead Rogue when classic comes up.
---
I'm sure some guilds will allow it, but if I should add it I will still point it out to be a rather none-viable specc.   
---
As for the Nightfall idea. It's a good idea but post-BWL the idea kind of collapses, as the weapon is rather useless in terms of individual DPS. Same thing goes for enhancement shamans. Nightfall is better utalized by a offtanking prot warrior or even a holy paladin/resto shaman in certain encounters. With a +healing enchant on the Nightfall you can be up front auto-bashing while healing. It works quite good actually - we have tried it.
---
You’re lucky I’m so bored
---
This is a pretty rough estimate (132+120+60+60+60+70)/6 = 84 days between announce and release
---
Keep in mind that number is skewed lower because their earlier releases were only 60 days apart from announcement, which is incredibly unlikely based on their more recent timelines
---
Yeah, me too. I used to make sure I had farmed enough shards for MC runs, and then log out.
---
Healthstone/soulsstones and the liked where temp - soulshards where not.
---
*Wooo* It's your **4th Cakeday** povilaslt2! ^(hug)
---
See you on whatever RP-PvP server crops up my dude. Gotta have both my fix of cringe and rage.
---
A long answer is to say that games have explicit rules, or code in the case of computer games, but also implicit expectations about how you will play. If you join a four-player boardgame and don't even try to win, but rather just try to throw the game to someone else because you know that will ruin the game for the other three players, you probably have not broken any of the explicit rules of the game but you are still a massive dick. The fact that the rules did not stop you being a dick does not mean you were not a dick.
---
A short answer is that you know when you are being a dick, we all know that you are being disingenuous when you pretend you don't understand how you can possibly be a dick, and you should stop being a dick.
---
Deadly does more dps than instant as long as you don't clip stacks (that is apply one when there's already 5). On your MH you will clip stacks due to the more attacks from abilities. So mh instant/oh deadly is optimal dps. That's what I remember anyway, might be completely wrong lol.
---
I will make them care.... \*shakes fist\*
---
Hear that they started to give a little at the end of Wrath.

Maybe you can help me out /u/sc2noob100

I'm super torn between rolling a druid or warrior. I used to play paladin and not sure if I really want to be a hybrid class again (forced to heal end-game). I'm teaming up with two of my friends, and I'll be tanking through dungeons.
---
Right now, I'm leaning warrior, as druids' bear tanking just seems kind of uninteresting (in terms of abilities) - just spamming Maul and Swipe, while warriors seem to have a lot more dedicated tanking abilities.
---
Any thoughts? Thanks :)
---
Most likely warrior. I realy enjoy tanking and I will always play together with a rogue so demage while leveling shouldn't be a real problem.
---
Thanks, I'd do it my self but I'm at work with no access to computer 
---
C'Thun bless you
---
Hunter - so I can roll on every weapon.
---
&gt; Harvesting shards depends on a ratio between your level and the level of the mob. The ideal ratio (highest drop rate) is from a mob at the same level as you are.
---
Nah, as long as the mob would give you xp, ie not has it level shown as grey, you would gain a soulshard.
---
It varies with your level when the mob turns grey
---
&gt;It's based on a value called "Zero Difference'
---
&gt;* ZD = 5, when Char Level = 1 - 7
---
* ZD = 6, when Char Level = 8 - 9
---
* ZD = 7, when Char Level = 10 - 11
---
* ZD = 8, when Char Level = 12 - 15
---
* ZD = 9, when Char Level = 16 - 19
---
* ZD = 11, when Char Level = 20 - 29
---
* ZD = 12, when Char Level = 30 - 39
---
* ZD = 13, when Char Level = 40 - 44
---
* ZD = 14, when Char Level = 45 - 49
---
* ZD = 15, when Char Level = 50 - 54
---
* ZD = 16, when Char Level = 55 - 59
---
&gt;With ZD being "how many levels below you is the mob gray" So looking at the first line, the first grey you'll see is a level 1 when you hit 6.
---
Thanks, that is fascinating and I did not know.
---
I can't decide! I was thinking undead warlock for a long time but nelf hunter, dwarf hunter or even tauren warrior all seem good. I've always had problems deciding what to pick. Maybe I'll leave it to a dice roll or something.
---
I still would support someone asking for a release date - Doesnt hurt anyone.
---
If someone actually got a damn accurate release date we would be much happier. None of this Soon or Summer BS.
---
I think it happened before wotlk, but I might be wrong.
---
As I remember it, they started awarding XP in battleground to combat twinks. You could disable battleground XP, but then you get put in a queue with other who had disabled BG-XP, hence other twinks.
---
I think my rogue started out as a twink, and then i abandoned that when they introduced BG-XP - and I remember playing him as level 70 in TBC.
---
Magnificent and thank you!   The Cauldron field brings back strong memories.  I did them as red quests and used every trick in the book to complete them
---
 Magnificent and thank you! The Cauldron field brings back strong memories. I did them as red quests and used every trick in the book to complete them.  Definitely worth a silver tip!!!
---
I used to think 2H fury sucked on alliance as well. But then, on Elysium, my alliance guild had a 2H warrior that had some of highest warrior DPS out of any warrior listed in the raidstats charts during BWL. (Of course, it helped that we were one of the 10 guilds to clear BWL week 1). And he of course crushed the rest of us in DPS, including several well geared and skilled dual-wield warriors.
---
The trick? Being a human and using BRE. On Elysium, at least early on, having 305 weapon skill reduced your base miss chance against a lv 63 enemy (aka raid bosses) to 6% (whereas it would be 9% if you had 300 skill). So if you're using a 2H sword, you only need 6% hit to be hit capped, which allows you to swap out hit gear for crit gear. (Compare to a dual wield warrior who has an additional 15% miss chance from dual wielding).
---
The biggest thing is BRE though. It granted 700 armor pen stacking up to 3 times, which had basically constant uptime. So you would be dealing an additional ~25% physical damage compared to other physical damage dealers, just as a function of not having to deal with the boss's armor. Then of course BRE itself has great damage stats.
---
Whether you could recreate this in classic is going to depend on 2 things:
---
1) How BRE works. On Elysium it was 700 stacking, and would proc often enough that so long as he attacking, it would have 100% uptime. If it procs a lot less often, or doesn't stack, or gives less armor pen, then this will all make it weaker.
---
2) Raid Boss Armor. It seems very likely that raid boss armor was overtuned on Elysium compared to the actual armor of raid bosses in 1.12. If the armor values on classic are low enough to make it so that Sunder, Faerie Fire, and Curse of Recklessness reduce a boss to 0 armor already, then Bonereaver edge's armor pen will do nothing. In which case, you won't have the extra 25% damage from armor pen as you would earlier, which would significantly lower your dps as compared to other dual-wield. 
---
Druid and Warlock.
---
Like always. That's my prediction. 
---
15 hours a day on your saturday &amp; sunday is probably unhealthy
---
i could imagine that for raiding, but why deadly while leveling/questing? a mob dies in 10-15 seconds. when i apply deadly at the start of the fight, it does the same damage as a procc of instant. so at best deadly is equal to instant, if it doesnt proc at the start of the fight, its worse.
---

Edit Note: My first response was deleted for containing the name of the private server. I have edited my comment to change this. The private server was the direct successor to nost
---
Hunter a dead class? Surely you’re not talking about PvP then, right?
---
I'm more interested in the person playing than the pixels they're playing, but you do you
---
You remember totally wrong
---
Leveling my Warlock I abhorred the idea of wasting precious HP for mana in the form of life tap. It never reached my bars until i started Raiding. As well, i was wearing spirit gear, and lots of it until well into the 50's untill i talked to a fellow warlock about the whole thing. He still couldn't convince me Life Tap was worth it's salt though.
---
seems to be always DPS LF tank  :P
---
I can't wait to be playing away in the world and getting whispered to run dungeons again :')
---
Yes. I just sit here at work, reading this sub. Waiting. Wanting. I've created a facebookgroup for past-wow friends so that we me join the same server. Noone seem as hyped as I am though.
---
Was thinking about starting up on a p-server, but that would ruin it.
---
I was talking about PVE and I am not calling and class dead, read again, it was about certain specs like balance, enh/ele shamans, retry paladins, arms warriors, bm hunters
---
Possibly yea - I was kinda surpsied though by your link. I remember Blizzard to post some false patchnotes for April fools, but making a whole page for new Content was kinda over the top lol.
---
This sub has a hate-boner for anything introduced past 2.0
---
I should have 2 copies lying around somewhere on the adic. I should clean that place.
---
Casual means you are going to equip the server for other raids. Except for the core group, people will come and go, because of the lack of progress. 
---
Make no mistakes, during the Sommer, the progress raids will poach your best players. 
---
Then you are left with very irregular attendance players and you basically always start from step 1 to equip new players. 
---
It's the hamster-wheel of raiding. 
---
Too hardcore means a huge time investment, because like someone already said the grind, the optimization. And at some point there is nothing left to do, but to stand in ironforge. 
---
I'm like you, I want to play progress, but I also can't play casual. 
---
Just go like myself with the middle ground. 
---
A raid that has good players, where everyone is on the same page, fully buffed, but not necessarily optimized all the way. 
---
Do semi-progress my friend. There will be tons of raids like that. 
---
I never had to type that as tank.
---
Just grab my coffee, sit back sipping it, reading trade chat. I shift click ppl to see their class/guild, slowly drink my coffee, then I am ready to make my decision, I graciously offer them I will tank.
---
It makes me sad, how true this is.
---
I've dropped all MMOs. Ff14, was even doing swtor. All done with them. Doing primarily Division 2 as it's awesome and different genre. 
---
Thank you for the detailed response, even with a hypothetical boss armor = 0 wouldn't other what weapons such as ashkandi or zinrohk still provide high dmg just slightly less than dw since everyone would be starting from a 0 value
---
Orcs and Humans are literally the first warlocks (in their respective planets) and the entire reason we have Warcraft in the first place.
---
Orcs became consorting with demons as Warlocks and were lead to Azeroth through the portal, which has helped to open up on the other side by Human warlocks.
---
BRE on private servers, on versions with 700 armor pen is BIS 2hander for pve until naxx. It’s actually crazy how much dps it can put out compared to DW and other 2handers. 2h fury with any other weapon, and no wind fury, is pretty rough. I played with hand of rag 2h fury on a private server and couldn’t get close to what I did as DW fury, apart from fights where I could get huge value from WW on adds.
---
PvE, 5 mans are fine you just need to drink a lot. Raids, you will be required to heal until the debuff slots open up to 16, from there you're at your prime until maybe the end of AQ. Naxx isn't much fun as shadow (but most people don't make it that far anyway). SP requires a lot of work, you need to gear yourself properly to max hit and come to every raid with full world buffs and consumables. As others have mentioned, guilds will only have one per roster and that person needs to be dedicated or they will find someone else (I remember having to wait for two shadow priests to quit before I got my turn). PvP, you can dominate any class 1v1, and BGs are so much fun. You can still have fun in only moderate gear, so you can raid as holy and get off-spec gear over time/use PVP rewards.
---
In actual vanilla i played a rogue. Not this time! Ever since Wotlk I've mained a Druid. 
---
I'm gonna be the jack of all trades sort of spec, the 0/30/21 most likely. "What role are you?" "Yes."
---
Wow, thanks for that.
---
So the older ones were all around 2 months, but the more recent ones were 3, 3.5, &amp; 4.
---
You'd probably get a lot of appreciation with this in it's own topic, and maybe people will add announcement info from Bliz's other recent games. If all the recent announcements are 3-4 months prior we can start ruling out dates as summer approaches.
---
....I don't want to rule out any dates though. I want classic NOW! :)
---
No, I can't see a world were Blizzard is not selling server transfer.
---
Not for classic though I don't think
---
Ensure Thorns is up.
---
Cast Rejuvenation on yourself before the pull if possible.

Inb4 "Wtf interview was only about BFA has ACTIVISION forgotten about VANILLA !?!?!?!??!" posts
---
People tend to forget that the OP version of BRE that people are referencing won't be out till naxx patch, and until then it'll just be a "good" not "op" weapon.
---
Literally can't bother with any game for too long right now, at least not alone... I just wanna dive real deep into Classic, can't wait
---
Same. 
---
I need a release date soon, I need to put in my 2 weeks off work. :/
---
With lower gear levels 2h fury is comparable. DW fury without 9% hit is a struggle, but it’s a little more manageable with fury.
---
I'm not sure how big the gap would be, but I'd say it is probably manageable if you can make use of the lowered hitcap. Again, I'd stress if you want to try it, you should go human (assuming weapon skill works the same way between private servers and classic). As for weapons, if The Untamed Blade has a decent proc chance, it's probably worth using that one over ashkandi or zin'rohk for PvE dps. I know our warrior was thinking about switching over if they nerfed BRE.
---
100% this. I don’t recall what alliance does, but it is a huge chain for horde, and a real barrier to getting ony down is getting enough people attuned 
---
For some people the best part of the game is being that super geared dude afk in Ironforge that everyone inspects. There’s also a competition amongst the no life’s on a server to clear raids faster and get the best gear. 
---
But fuck Activision-Classic. I want the info about what exactly is in and out of the game, why get exited over stuff that leans towards shit?
---
I mean like look at retail..
---
This is the internet where you are not supposed to like what other people like. 
---
amazing stuff!
---
Quit worrying about how other people enjoy the game. Not everybody can be exactly like you. 
---
The only thing I can say is that will all 3 combinations you share gear type. Hunter shaman is both leather and mail at 40. Shaman Druid is both leather till 40. Warlock / Priest is both cloth till 60. This will mean that for every piece of gear that drops at any point in the game you'll compete with each other for this gear.   
---
While if you would go Priest/Rogue for example you would not have this problem. 
---
I couldn't stand anymore and started playing wow again. Even it's not classic I am trying all classes up to 50-60 level 
---
I prefer the Rotation mentioned by Optenka.
---
It's the same on retail WoW, tbh. Every guild under the sun *claims* to be Hardcore. "We're starting with Heroic and then moving to Mythic" but 9/10 of these guilds never make it out of the Heroic runs. Everyone's hardcore until it's time to step up and put the work in. Classic will be the same I feel. Personally - I just need competent people who are fun to be around and I'll be happy out raiding away.
---
I completely understand what you’re saying and share your view of taking the time to enjoy the journey. However, the wonderful thing about Classic is that you can do whatever you want and for some speed levelling and Uber min maxing is their way.
---
Bottom line is, don’t think it’s ‘sad’ by judgment of your own feeling just be content that you can play in a way that’s not worse or better but just different. 👍
---
&gt; they can just not accept sub-par specs into their group in game.
---
And then be called names on this subreddit for being toxic, elitist, intolerant, what have you. Yep, we've gone full circle. 
---
I have the first three expansions still in great condition I see them often however as I clean my house regularly.
---
Its almost as if people have different concepts of what is enjoyable for them..
---
Have you ever considered some people simply don't share your opinion of what is or isn't fun ?
---
Imagine that
---
The way I remember things (as a hunter) is the tank/healer/dps mismatch being way less of a problem back then.  I can think of a few reasons why:
---
* It might be because dungeons could easily be tanked by dps warriors or druids while being healed by balance druids or shadow priests. 
---
* Another reason might be the importance of utility back then. Classes like a warlock for summon or a mage for poly&amp;portals were often sought after more than a tank or healer. 
---
* My memories are incorrect due to my server being pretty low-pop
---
Either way, searching for a group always took way longer than it did right now.
---
so about 3 months average
---
or a minimum of 2
---
No you can't. 
---
Nice
---
Jebaited
---
Go tank nefarian while you're stuck in cat for 30 seconds ;)
---
Just be a leech; go hard for MC/BWL, hopefully you will be 80% BiS within a few months. After that you just gquit and focus on life, play when you have time and do stuff you actually enjoy in-game. Unless you actually enjoy farming consumables/rep just buy the gold/rep and spend that extra daily hour in the gym, hopefully you paid for some poor dudes meal that day as well,   
---
Once AQ40 is released you hop into a new/the same guild with a nice excuse as to why you had to stop playing for a while. Not the nicest thing to do towards the guild but in the end afk  &gt; in-game even though it might require some discipline on my part to not get swallowed by Classic :P
---
I would level tailoring and skinning for leveling. Not only can you gain some gold from skinning, but some things like bags require leather to make, so once you get up to silk and beyond you can make your own bags without buying leather from the AH.
---
Hope it doesnt turn out to be like Winter 2017 for osrs mobile
---
Is that just a bad luck chuck moment? This isn't definitely going to happen but is always a possibility.
---
Locks on alliance are usually a lot less than on horde. Orc and UD are amazing for pvp!
---
It may be because people min-maxed way less back then than we do now but tanking in fury or critcat spec was definitely a thing back then. It's completely feasible to tank them in a dps spec with level-appropriate gear but it probably wasn't optimal. People simply cared less about the dungeon being finished 3 minutes earlier then they do now.
---
Yes it's effectively equivalent to being 50% AFK during group efforts, how does that not make someone an asshole? 
---
Nailed it
---
This one looks really good. Do they sell it anywhere I’m guessing not? 
---
For me crawling through raids with your friends on raid nights was my fun.
---
The grind before it ive done many many many times before mostly alone.
---
Dont tell me what i should like about a game
---
It hasn't killed my gaming drive but it's certainly killed my excitement for any games coming out. My standard go-tos still appeal but besides WoWC... I don't know. The FF7 remake? Maybe? 
---
Dwarfs are better for pvp than humans. Stoneform is a strong pick.
---
This is the main reason I laugh at min/maxers. Usually they forgot to see the big picture.
---
They do unfortunately mention BFA here: https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/live-developer-q-a-ask-questions-here/127817
---
Tfw you find out that they release it the day your vacation is over
---
Not sure if this worked in classic. But we used this exploit a lot on a private server I used to play on.
---
So on Razorgore you could completely skip having new adds spawn by simply kiting the starting 5-9 adds around the ramp. Using slowing totems and whatnot to keep the kiter from taking damage, the raid would idely watch on as the warrior kited these mobs up and around the ramp until all eggs were destroyed.
---
The idea is that if you don't kill the starting adds that protect and control the orb, no new adds will spawn. 
---
But like i said, this was executed on a 5-man raid setting on a private server. Not sure if this is confirmed in classic or in a 40 man setting. 
---
If I talk about what is optimal and suboptimal, others will correct me on my errors and I will learn.
---
Counterpoint: You come into my group saying "lol guys im a melee hunter", im kicking you, it might be fun for you, but meme specs are just that, memes for enjoyment with other people consenting to having their play hindered by your meme spec.
---
Scarab Lord
---
That is actually not what min/maxing entails. You need druids, paladins, etc. Because of their utility and kit. But each of those classes have good, okayish and horrible ways to play them. 
---
This. I also enjoy leveling but in the same time I understand why some people want to level as fast as possible. Gear grinding and optimising your charakter can be realy fun. 
---
Tbh mage is a blast in pvp, it's only pve thats boring
---
It's not about worse classes, its about worse specs. That boomkin who is innervating the healer could also be a solid healer if went resto.
---
That cat dps could be a solid offtank if went for beartanking specs. Or if he had int gear could be decursing instead (while innervating and brezzing)
---
Synopsis: People are different.
---
One week to get to 60? With warrior at that? I wish I had your optimism...
---
ayy, thank you man!
---
planning on doing all the zones eventually
---
&gt;&gt; If I want to RP a mage that wants his target to be at the perfect temperature and only cast alternating fireball and frostbolt then that's on me
---
&gt;Well as long as it is on you and you don't bring that stuff when you're playing with strangers then I have no issues with what you're doing, why would I care?
---
I disagree. Running into strangers like that is some of the best fun you can have.
---
&gt; The people who don't want to min-max, hunt for BiS, whatever, are worried there won't be a place for them at all in later game content.
---
And they should be worried if they knowingly picked a spec that performs poorly and will likely be often rejected for end-game dungeons and raids. But the unrefined balance of this old game is to blame for that really, not the raid leaders.
---
It stopped before this bait thread man!
---
That's a funny way to spell troll. 
---
&gt; Isn't the point to enjoy the game
---
Who are you to tell other people how they should enjoy the game?
---
I had a look and at the moment all I found was an old forum post from 2010 with a link to buy the shirt but of course it was shut down 
---
Underpowered how? You mean a hybrid class pumps out lower numbers when shoehorned into a one dimensional role in raids?
---
Druids are extremely strong in dungeons, in world PvP, while leveling, and in BGs.
---
You should look up manual crowd pummeler...cause your gonna be farming that item over and over again
---
As a memespec im not saying you cant but your gonna have to put in a lot more work if you want to make it into progression raids, if thats not your goal then disregard me. Not being elitist just realistic
---
Is that legal? 
---
I've done 2 Maraudon runs with my current character. First time it was really not fun because the hunter couldn't manage his pet and was taunting and stealing adds, priest was constantly hotting and shielding me because I was rage-starved and we waited for half a min after each pull. 
---
After 2 hours of torture, I left, halfway through. I did not enjoy the experience and I was only keeping up for 2 hours because I was in a party and didnt want to be the asshole quitter.
---
Second time we've done the whole place in 1,5. We had time to joke around while killing stuff. I wasn't rage starved, the mages only used nova when needed and the hunter managed his pet well. There was one lousy lock but it was okay, it was his first char and was learning quick. (After each mistake we wrote it down and he avoided it in the future)
---
Being a good player means pushing the right buttons (like in this scenario) but also choosing the useful items and specs.
---
If I play with good players, I enjoy the game more. If I play with bad players, I don't. Now I understand people aren't born pr0s (and I'm not one myself) but if you refuse to improve yourself you are ruining my experience.
---
I'd rather have a good all-around druid who is feral/resto and switching between forms than one that stays in chicken and auto-attacks the mob after he is oom, even if the latter enjoys what he is doing.
---
It has killed my drive to play "other" games yes.
---
Deadlines = VC are ya new?
---
LoS is a game mechanic, though, not an exploit. Wall jumping was always an exploit and never a mechanic.
---
The title didn't come in til TBC

Yeah the Draenei Stalker unit is similar to the rogue class. Imo Warden is still the most rogue-esque, especially if we limit ourselves to heroes only. Dubbed the "special police", besides being jailers they're also assassins or bounty hunters and their playstyle as an "assassination type" reinforces that. Shadowmeld also gives them that stealthiness although it isn't the same as proper invisibility.
---
Out of all the memespecs I think tanking druid is actually one of the more viable. 
---
What region will you be in ?
---
Chromag maybe chromag? You might not have the CD to survive his tank debuff
---
Instructor razuvious is definitely one you cant take  ;) 
---
Something tells me you cant main tank some resistance fights due to not being able to optimise both your resistance and regular stats, (hit crit stam etc.) Several naxx fights come to mind
---
You forgot to use demo roar
---
Everybody knows all the zones already and it's a common adage that the game starts at 60 not in Levelling. I'll power level. 
---
They're good at levelling, and have a niche in wsg. They aren't extremely strong in dungeons like at all? They are good at running away in world PvP... dunno if I'd call that extremely strong.
---
So, you don't like people playing non-optimally so you choose to not group with them. Exactly what the guy you're responding to said is the solution, so i'm not sure what you're even arguing here. Nobody (except an extreme minority) has any problems with that. The type of minmaxer people have problems with is those who continue to berrate/insult people and call them assholes for playing the way they prefer, even when they're in no way forcing themselves upon the minmaxer, but just happily staying in their own guild of like minded people and minding their own business. 
---
Since Classic is not your average expansion you can't conclude anything  based on these dates imho.
---
There isn't even a Beta announced, maybe there won't be any at all.
---
Imo the only things wrong with a feral tank is it has no CD's (no panic button to potential save raid from wiping) and it having the largest skill gap between being bad and passable.
---
At the end of the day id still bring a feral tank to OT but only let someone i know who would spend  20 hours a week of raid prep sense he needs so many consumables.  Warriors can do everything a feral can do but better and easier. Still feral is the most raid viable of the memespecs
---
I'm gonna take my time and do both. As a main UD warlock, some of the choices was made with a heavy heart but I tried to stay true to Warcraft 1-3 lore and Vanilla WoW as much as possible, disregarding obvious siedtracks like introvideos and trailers  that are clearly made to highlight WoW's diversity 
---
Human: Paladin (Humans are the dominant wielders of holy magic and while priests dabble in both light and darkness, the Holy warrior class represents the Human race the best)  
---
Dwarf:  Warrior (Dwarves are sturdy fighters first and foremost. If a cleric class existed in WoW it would a tougher choice)  
---
Night Elf: Druid (Their race is the first and, until wow launch, the only druidic race. No brainer)  
---
Gnome: Mage (Gnomes make up for a poor constitution by wits and intelligence, naturally drawn to the magical arts as a result)  
---
Orc: Shaman  (As a race they have generally managed to re-establish their connection to the elements, and while thyey were the quintissential Warlock, in WoW, the Legion has been defeated and the orcs are striving to become someting apart form their former fel-connection.)  
---
Tauren: Hunter (Tauren are a nomadic people, who live off the land. They don't grow any crops and are dependant on their hunters to provide for their society)  
---
Forsaken: Rogue  (Shunned by most of the society, forsaken prefer to work form the shadows)  
---
Troll: Hunter (Much like the Tauren, the Darkspear trolls dont have any culture for agriculture, Also their strongest fighters in Lore are their "Shadow Hunters" A hybrid that isn't playable in the game (Vol'jin). All things considered i gravitate to the hunter class)  
---
Paladin: Human (Arthas, Uther, every single lore paladin of any importance has been human)
---
Priest:    Priest is a very allcompassing class which Blizzard even gave special racials to, to prove it, because in lore there are no cut and dry priest class, but in game u cant possibly balance priest/cleric/witch doctor/light/dark priests. Looking at both spectrums of the class, from Holy to shadow, id say Humans AND Forsaken   
---
Mage:    Human (Kirin Tor)
---
Hunter: Tauren (see explanation above regarding Taurens)
---
Rogue:   Forsaken (See explanation above regarding Forsaken)
---
Warlock: Orc (The badge as the original warlock race, gives them the edge over Forsaken when u consider warlocks as wielders of "Fel" magic over shadow magic)
---
Druid:     Night Elf
---
Warrior: Again a class that literally encompasses every race. What constitutes a orc warrior and human warrior are very different, but blizz had to make a generic fits-all-class to even the playing field. If you look at it like this; Upon meeting what race on the battle field would you expect 100% to fight hand to hand combat? I'd say Dwarf.
---
Shaman: Orc (See explanation above regarding orcs)
---
Warlocks easily
---
You're literally calling people who do not play the optimal way assholes. Do you not see how ridiculous that is? It's a game, and people should be able to enjoy it however they like. The lack of self awareness you're showing is amazing. 
---
Why? 
---
My character got that mask at level 6 in vanilla because I asked a few friends to help me kill the Defias in Westfall while I was sitting in stealth. I still got that mask in my bank. I plan to do something similar this time around!
---
PVP as a resto healer though? Yeah. That sucks. Bear is one thing, but resto is not fun in pvp compared to ANY of the other healers, even shaman.
---
“adic”
---
Ah darn ok I see what you mean, how about enhancement for pvp spec?
---
So we are getting the real vanilla experience!
---
Why are so many people going warrior?
---
I was a warrior in vanilla and it was slow and painful. The way they improve exponentially with gear is awesome, at 60 even with BWL gear I was stacked. Eventually got naxx gear and yeah... Ended up selling my account for $1200.
---
So true. All games now feel pointless. I just read about classic wow, nothing interesting left to read about it:d
---
Sorted all what had to be sorted in real life, pc setup ready, family knows, that next hobby to me will be classic wow:d
---
Im ready to sink into classic.
---
Yes they should be somewhere on the adic. One is shredded because I read it so much the other one should look pritty oke.
---
Did I say something wrong?
---
Hmmm one shot PvP is pretty cool, I like being able to heal myself while fighting too. But yea maybe mediocre over all...
---
what is this rank 14, like high ranked PvPers?
---

---
"Hi, this is Jack's twin brother. Jack is dead."
---
Hmmm darn i see what you mean.
---
You don't hate min/maxers, you hate not being invited to raiding groups because of your choices. A lot of people feel entitled to raid spots everywhere and can't seem to stomach the idea that sometimes you have to put up with some inconveniences for the sake of the raid group. 
---
Most people have no idea what min/maxing is. Asking you to always have the best consumables on you, to farm and spend insane amounts of gold to buy all the epics you can get on the AH and so forth is min/maxing. Asking you to play your best raiding spec isn't min/maxing. 
---
Anyone who think you can't raid without min/maxing is just as autistic as everyone here yelling that just because they can ~~get carried~~raid as niche/meme specs then it's fair that 39 others should put up with them. 
---
You have an attitude problem, not a spec problem.

It's a joke. Guy got banned from YouTube for posting a video of him beating up/dragging onto the train tracks this loud feminist character 
---
In the future should you find yourself referencing the room right below the roof of a house, that’s an attic.
---
Now go find those Classic WoW cases because they are a treasure to have!
---
In private servers you have dynamic respawns, that's why people prefer to share the area. In Classic I plan to attack anyone and clear the area for my faction.
---
Tank LFG (Drake no meme)
---
LF4M Need heals and dps (Drake yes meme)
---
You say you can't get bored playing a druid, but raiding as a druid is HT and HT Only. That's hardly engaging.
---
I concede outside of raiding, yes, it's fun, but raiding as resto it's just not fun.
---
Druid. I love to feeling to travel to moonglade long before any other class can set their feet in this zone. Also I realy enjoyed the shapeshift quests. Warrior is funny with brawl island (don't know the actual name anymore)
---
Same. I do random boss random class pov.
---
Because nothing is better than people wasting your time, right?
---
Warlock. I did a prot warrior during Classic WoW which was great for leveling in dungeons but I had a hard time finding spots in raids, started a mage as a second class to do dps in raids.  Since I've done warrior and mage I think warlock sounds fun but druid could also be cool 
---
I don’t know, my 8 year old laptop with no graphics card can have trouble running private server and too many Mozilla tabs. 
---
2min CD - Strike 1 additional target - reduce energy regen. - 15 sec duration.
---
If the mob dies within 15 sec you didn't need it anyway since you have other options to incapacitate the other mob (or Evasion etc)
---
It was still good but just a small extra for leveling. 
---
Which would be no different if they paid to move to a new server or made new characters.  Let people play on populates servers  
---
Many practice friend. Much optimism
---
You should go for spirit as a priest. if you have a talent that increases spirit and youre wanding most of the time anywas so big regen.
---
basically you wanna waste all you mana until youre almost oom then you dot and wand until u regen fully and then again.
---
Atleast people are being a bit creative. would be boring if people just asked questions about what speck is best or what char to play. I like the maps :)
---
Nobody cares. You can be as bad as you want just don't get angry and make post on a forum about how min-maxers ruin everything. People who actually put in the effort will not want to play with you if you are intent on being lazy or bad at the game.
---
&gt; You're literally calling people who do not play the optimal way assholes.
---
No, I'm not, I'm calling assholes assholes, if people don't want to play the optimal way, then they shouldn't feel forced, but they should take the consequence of that and not group rely on others who do.
---
&gt; Do you not see how ridiculous that is? 
---
No, I do not see why it's ridiculous to call people so narcissistic that they're not only putting their own interest above the interest of others to the point where they're literally demanding others carry them through content assholes.
---
Hunter.
---
No, people hate minmaxers because the obnoxious ones stubbornly insist that non minmaxers are objectively being narcisistic assholes. When in reality that is your subjective opinion, and the fact that the majority of this sub has downvoted this opinion of yours wherever it surfaces should tell you that despite how much importance you place on people playing the game optimally, and how much you rationalize it by saying it's about politeness and treating strangers with respect, the rest of this community just does not fucking see it that way.
---
You can continue handwaving away people who disagree with your opinions by asserting that you're trying to make the game better for everyone, that you're trying to improve the community. Or that disagreeing with your premise makes us secretly extremely selfish and that we just don't realize it yet. But, speaking personally, I find your stubborn insistence and ironic obsession with altruism far more obnoxious, toxic, and less respectful or polite to strangers than I find the mere concept of people not minmaxing in pugs.
---
TL;DR
---
Your opinions are not objective. I understand your point of view. I disagree with it. I think you are worse than the thing you hate. That is what people mean when they say they hate minmaxers. Not what you decide they mean.
---
Even if each individual form feels like a lite version of another class, the fact that you combine them all into one character for the huge boost in versatility doesn't ever leave me feeling "I'm basically a worse version of a rogue". 
---
Also, while not PvE viable, if you want something that feels unique, moonkin is the closest we have to "battlemages", possibly a bit of competition for that role from elem shaman, but those don't play similarly.
---
Fd becomes available on lvl30 so don't worry.
---
Mage had the worst. Screw Dustwallow Marsh and screw Tabetha. 
---
Story 1 ) I used to logg off in beds when i first started playing the game since i thought your character would still be visible. ( like people afk in major cities or dead corpses that stayed there for days )
---
Story 2 ) I ended up in a ZF group were a mage had vendord his staff because he wanted to get an upgrade in the dungeon ( it didnt drop , and if it ould have dropped, there was another guy who would roll on it anyways )
---
I would assume that it is two completely different teams working on BFA and Classic. Since the Q&amp;A is about BFA with the BFA team, they would most likely not be able to answer. But, I do however also support this. We need to put pressure on Blizzard as a whole. ;-)
---
In the end you have the same benefit with paladin and druids in dungeons because they can tank as well, and for hybrids more generally as a healer you don't struggle to find a group either.
---
Its still fine
---
For quite some time after the announcement I've been bored out of my brain. Recently started playing PoE again and listening to classic videos/podcasts while grinding in game.
---
It's helping a lot to pass the time.
---
&gt;  and the fact that the majority of this sub has downvoted this opinion
---
Lmao, implying up and downvotes decide right and wrong, in a thread where the concept of letting group leaders decide who they bring in their group is downvoted, you can't make this shit up.
---
&gt;  Your opinions are not objective. 
---
How is "you should try to not be an asshole" not an objective truth?
---
You don't play warrior. While leveling, red means you die. 
---
I really enjoy levelling blacksmithing and mining, are there any classes that can benefit from these professions aside from warrior/paladin?
---
OMG looks amazing! especially "Tomb of the So Called Lightbringer"
---
/u/Krissam on suicide watch.
---
&gt; Exactly what the guy you're responding to said is the solution, 
---
Except, we're not allowed to not group with them either, as per the popular opinion in the other thread.
---
Nope, it’s a video game which is separate from my real life breathing 
---
Wow this is exactly me. I almost always have a game or two going at anyone time, now I spend that time watching classic wow videos on YouTube. 
---
My body is ready
---
I'm not implying up and downvotes imply right and wrong. I'm implying they should tell you people don't agree with you.
---
"You should try to not be an asshole" is not objective truth in this case because it isn't objective that not minmaxing in wow makes someone an asshole. The fact that people disagree with that idea should prove this to you.
---
I too like to totally immerse myself and when I have to eat as a warrior I eat IRL.
---
Had to use voice assistance to type this because my hands simply smother the keyboard.
---
Not really, if he wants to be a boomkin he can be a boomkin, the fuck do I care? He just shouldn't be an asshole to other players.
---
Did we read the same thread? The majority upvoted opinion on that topic was "Play exactly how/what you want, just don't get angry if I won't invite you". 
---
i like mining while leveling because it takes up less bag slots.
---
I don't know why but seeing that sticker on a car has the same effect as when I see a hatchet man... a strange and foul odor enters my memory and flashbacks occur.
---
You don't need it, but it's a great excuse to update. I sure am.
---
I honestly felt very uncomfortable when being over the immensely deep crack in Vash'jir. 
---
It was simply too unsettling and I took a wide berth around that area.
---
I got this exact same feeling since Nostalrius shutdown
---
Well, the fact that the majority agrees that group leaders should not be allowed to decide who they're in group with should tell you something about the people who set the popular opinion on the subreddit.
---
&gt; is not objective truth in this case because it isn't objective that not minmaxing in wow makes someone an asshole.
---
You're right, it's not, but it is an objective truth that expecting others to put in effort because you don't want to yourself makes you an asshole.
---
My best friend and I will take our time leveling ... and ganking others as a rogue and feral duo. It's gonna be so much fun. So you are not alone!
---
So you hate the entirety of min-maxers because of a few misbehaving people?  
---
Someone else pointed out already that you could do the very same post about casual players who act toxic towards min-maxers.
---
You say you can't find them in that post, but there were definitely a few of them in the chad/virgin meme threads.  
---
There shouldn't actually ever be any friction between the two factions because they will usually surround themselves with their own people. If you're in a casual guild you probably won't have to deal with "tryhards", and hardcore raiders won't raid with suboptimal specs which might be played by the casual faction.  
---
As someone else said: People are angry about it because they're afraid that the majority of people will be "tryhard" and thus, they won't get invited to any raiding group.  
---
While it's understandable to have a certain anxiety about it considering how the gaming meta evolved over the last few years, it still doesn't justify demonizing said faction.
---
NE Hunter, played it in vanilla wow and then rolled BE Pally. Will be going for Hunter again, i miss having a pet with me!
---
Except the post straight up stating the raidleader should be free to not invite certain people were downvoted and the post stating that you're not allowed to dictate how the people you play with play was upvoted.
---
I'm sure his boss will *udderstand* if he gives a *mooving* explanation. 
---
So if that Boomkin wants to pug dungeons would you consider him an asshole or not?
---
&gt; ) play on the same server as a major streamer (cant vouch for the quality of the people there, but there will be bodies
---
That sounds fucking awful.
---
Then he's an asshole, yea.
---
It's all I want right now.... Homework? screw that! Family? They'll live.  Wow Classic? YES PLEASE! Friends you say? I'll see you in /trade
---
The highest upvoted comments were still of the opinion stated above. 
---
&gt;&gt;you're not allowed to dictate how the people you play with play was upvoted.
---
Probably was upvoted because it's a little ambiguous. You are not allowed to dictate to some random ele shammy you run into for a group quest when lvling that he should respec into a more optimal spec. However you are totally allowed to dictate to whatever raid or pug dungeon group you've made that they should play a certain way. 
---
Yes and no. WoW (from vanilla through wotlk) was \_the\_ game I played that I \_loved\_.  Everything else was just filler.  Same is true now.  I like other games but I haven't found a game that I would play over pre-ruined Wow.
---
 I have a few games I've bought on sale over the past year that I can't play due to my gaming bc being old.  I am planning to update my pc for Classic but I was thinking maybe I should go ahead and update it now so I can play those games I bought because once Classic arrives I'm probably not going to play another game for a year or so.
---
You're assuming that everyone is interested in clearing content as quickly and efficiently as possible, which is false. If sub optimal speccs bother you that much, just join a hardcore guild and run dungeons with them. 
---
rank 14 is the highest pvp rank and its incredibly hard to get
---
its more of a measurement of playtime than skill tho cuz you have to play a lot like absolutely nolife 
---
Yet, this comment as unambiguous and supporting people in playing however the hell they want as this wass downvoted.
---
Of course extreme min/maxing is just silly. But you have to understand the other side as well. You can't avoid bad players so easily. You can't choose to not play with them because sometimes you play in pugs. Or you aren't the GM/Raid Leader of your guild. It is much easier to tell people which are the good picks in the beginning then persuading them to switch over.
---
I do not like people calling others assholes for picking a different race. But there IS an optimal race choice and it DOES affect gameplay by quite a bit and as such, affects not just you, but everybody else around you.
---
My penis gets bigger for every epic I loot
---
Warlocks were so bad in the early patches that some locks leveled underwater (with underwater breathing) to avoid being ganked.
---
They got ok in 1.6 and good in patch 1.8
---
I'm enjoying the hell out of Far Cry and RDR2, but I do feel stressed to finish them before Classic is released ^^,
---
I really dont like this trend where taurens are called trolls and dwarfs
---
The highest upvoted comments were still of the opinion stated above. The majority, or popular opinion, was that choosing to not invite sub-optimal specs to your group/raid is totally justified. 
---
the class itself didnt changed too much. the numbers were fixed
---
Not one bit. Not worth doing if you ask me. 
---
Much censorship. Many wow.
---
But wasnt shamanism even an older tradition with taurens, I remember reading some lore related stuff about that
---
Hey it's been a while since I've been able to use the /oom emote unironically so it should be fun :p
---
Kinda the opposite for me. Once Classic comes out you won't be playing any other games, so you need to get them in now. I've already bought 4 new games this month
---
Find it hilarious how many people down voted something I enjoy 
---
My experience playing druid ass offtank/DPS was pleasant, once I proved myself.  When I applied to guilds with no raiding experience it was hard tbh.  
---
Eventually, I met people running pugs and got invited to a raiding guild.  Eventually it got really expensive for progression as I would switch roles fight to fight, and had tank, DPS and healing sets.   But it was alot of fun being so versatile.
---
You needed resistances for pretty much every fight
---
Human - Paladin, Mage
---
Night Elf - Druid, Hunter
---
Dwarf - Warrior, Hunter
---
Gnome - Mage, Rogue
---
Orc - Shaman, Warlock
---
Troll - Shaman, Hunter
---
Tauren - Shaman, Warrior
---
Undead - Priest, Rogue
---
I've never played vanilla as Horde and likely won't in Classic either. So I'm very casually levelling a shaman on a PS just to scratch the itch. Not sure if you can use that tactic but it's quite fun. I have no plans to ever get to 60 or anything. Just playing when I'm jonesing real bad.
---
I wonder how hooked I’ll be with the actual game when I’m already refreshing this sub 5 times a day
---
A lot of the streamers and YouTubers have to do that to remain relevant and keep having people watch them. That's why normal people almost never get as popular; the plebs don't want to watch someone just casually going through the game like them, they want to see someone "elite" (or pretending to be in the case of many of these guys). 
---
Sad but true. I think most of us plan to play the game slow, take it all in and experience the joy of Classic (again if you did it before but for a lot of people it'll be the first time). Just your popular guys do that, and they'll bleed subs. 
---
No, I'm telling you when you're teaming up with someone towards a common goal, in a video game, your goal number one should be to make that experience as enjoyable as possible for everyone, getting through a dungeon fast and painlessly helps achieve that goal better than anything else you could do, at least as something that will work every time.
---
&gt; If sub optimal speccs bother you that much
---
Not totally related, what's with this sub and its fetish for calling bad specs "suboptimal"? For someone who hates minmaxing they sure are putting in a lot of work to make the specs sound better than they are.
---
&gt;just join a hardcore guild and run dungeons with them.
---
I am gonna, but that doesn't help the new guy who spends 5 hours stuck in BFD because someone decided playing ret was totally viable.
---
Similar situation. I’ll do a bookend vacation so I end up with 13 days off in a row at launch then I’ll do another normal week of vacation a week or two afterwards. I’ll still go to the gym, do chores, and cut my lawn though.
---
&gt;You can't choose to not play with them because sometimes you play in pugs.
---
so choose to not join that pug if it's that important to you. Make your own groups where you make the rules. 
---
&gt;Or you aren't the GM/Raid Leader of your guild.
---
Join a guild which is aligned with your views. 
---
&gt;I do not like people calling others assholes for picking a different race. But there IS an optimal race choice and it DOES affect gameplay by quite a bit and as such, affects not just you, but everybody else around you.
---
good, we agree then. Yes race choice affects other people by a tiny amount, but as long as the guy who chose night elf priest doesn't throw a hissy fit when &lt;hardcore&gt; doesn't invite him to their guild, and instead he finds his own place of likeminded people, he is not being an asshole what so ever. 
---
Also remember that "bad players" will most likely be the vast majority of the population. So you can't expect people to play to your (the minority's) wishes in places like open world questing, pug dungeons, and pug bgs etc. 
---
That comment sits at exactly 0 votes. I wouldn't call that downvoted.
---
The user also had a bit of an obnoxious attitude so I can see why he got downvotes for some of his comments.
---
As /u/Coasteland said the majority opinion was that choosing to not invite sub-optimal specs to your group/raid is totally justified.
---
Best aoe tank? They out tank warriors for sure, when it comes to dungeons.
---
Personally i'm taking herbalism for gold making and tailoring to make [truefaith vestments](https://classicdb.ch/?item=14512) and then level engineering instead of tailoring for max benefits.
---
Its just fact, that Cross Realm BGs are needed long term, you can believe whatever you want, but you are factually wrong.  /shrug
---
actually they were removed because they were flagged as spam.  
---
sincerely,  
---
emo-kid.
---
more hate for people who use the phrase 'hate boner' 
---
Would if i could.
---
I mean technically i could, i'm single and i don't have kids.
---
But i'm not too sure how lvl60 t3 warrior would change that 😂
---
I know alot won't agree with me, but I remember doing my aquatic quest, right at 16.  A level 18 druid saw me struggle and she spent the next three hours helping me run all over the place.   It was so gruelling, but I remember the epic feeling once it was complete, it's honestly such a fond memory.
---
I lost way too much of my childhood because I was too busy in WoW. If I'm going to play, I'll make sure I'm not losing that much of my young adulthood. I'd only play when I have nothing better to do, so my TV time.
---
This sub is full of immature children.
---
Ignore them and enjoy. 
---
Good to know. 
---
Is he still an asshole if he discloses the fact that he is a boomkin beforehand and the group is fine with it?
---
I saw your post where you said you deleted all of them due to negative feedback and wrote a giant sob story, stop lying bro  
---
yuuuup
---
Druid, they always are the least played. I dunno why exactly but for me, what is really off putting is a combination of healer role but with no reliable rez, while still being the worst of the 4 healer classes in vanilla
---
(This is just my interpretation, they may not be THAT bad but afaik they are, please do correct me if im wrong and somehow priest is preforming worse - I am pretty sure neither paladins or shamans get outhealed by druids but they do both bring more raid tools in the form of blessings and totems)
---
Highest voted comment doesn't touch on the topic, second highest says you're not allowed to.
---
So no, I'm no longer sure we were reading the same thread.
---
I think they just hate the unsolicited criticism from someone who was never asked. I’ve seen plenty of people chime in with their condescending views on someone’s class and race or spec choice without being asked. Those are the people I hate. 
---
Why mention "more in the desc". Obviously that's what the description is for, it doesn't need to be said.
---
Dont Nelfs have some sort of beard option?
---
No, of course not.
---
No really. Have a couple of games lined up. Just don't have time this month. 
---
oh no
---
It shows at -2 for me, guess it's the vote scrambling, but that still doesn't change the fact that there are several posts with many upvotes (considering the sub) telling people they're not allowed to.
---
i just found this in on my old harddrive and wanted to share this nostalgia experience with you guys. i used to watch this video sooo many times back in the old days &lt;3. dem feels...

You get a soup shard for killing a mob that is 5 levels below you so that should take about 6 sec per mob. Multiply by 40 and there you go. 
---
Wiping in vanilla is not same as wiping in retail. You won't see 50th wipe on cthun before guild disbands
---
I do this too when I go through random bouts of insomnia. Back when Alex used to do streams I’d watch his streams to fall asleep. Soupa is good to because he’s so wholesome.
---
Nelf hunter 
---
That's what I'm trying to tell you. Getting through the game as fast and painlessly as possible is not the goal for everyone.
---
Youre actually saying that the chosen RACE would have such an effect on gameplay with everyone else around me that you would have to leave a dungeon group?? One could be playing a night elf holy priest and still work his way as a DPS in any non-raid in Vanilla. 
---
Sure but isn't the record held by that Joana guy/gal with like 4 days and 12 hours /played?
---
So why say stuff like that:
---
&gt;See, that's impossible because playing a balance druid automatically makes you an asshole.
---
?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b2ko2o/why_so_much_hate_for_minmaxing/eitj8rj/
---
Also interested.  Team of two, Warrior and Mage, both have played on p-server, but taking a break for a fresh experience.
---
There's a difference between a goal and a positive outcome.
---
Really? Then there should be just a few races playing the game, hell, only few classes too, as all the others are really sub-par and unoptimal.
---
Cant wait to destroy some murlocs with you!
---
Great for bears, that is why I get tribal spec. in the beginning and dump it later for herb. 
---
It's still just a guess, assuming a simplistic formula. We *know* that many aspects of pservers are not accurate.
---
We **don't** know. There are no sources. You are just speculating and intentionally share misinformation based on pserver behaviour.
---
It doesn't change the fact that the majority opinion was that choosing to not invite sub-optimal specs to your group/raid is totally justified.
---
Downvoted people just expressed their views in a dickish way. I also just looked into the thread and no initial comment sits lower than 0.
---
Yeah and when you look into it with detail, theres actually only couple most optimal playable races. So the others are totally obsolete, as they could be better. 
---
No joke, my guild on an unnamed server starting with K ending in 3, has more druids show up than warlocks on raid day. 
---
Ally side so I suspect that has something to say, most people if starting on a server alone, will probably roll horde if they just wanna play warlock since no tremor totems and no undeads. 
---
Because there's a difference between asking 4 people if they're okay with something and expecting a rl tell them they should be okay with something.
---
Nah but to this day whenever I am playing a game and suddenly drop off a cliff I still get major vertigo.
---
One minute you are looking at a map and the next second you are trying to find your blink button but you can't cause first you gotta find your legs and open your eyes.
---
"The majority upvoted opinion on that topic" aka the highest upvoted comments on the topic of it being okay /not okay to decline inviting sub optimal specs, not the highest upvoted comments in the thread as a whole. 
---
Yeah I also used to set myself on fire for every immolate casted on me, I used to run out my chair for every fear and throw sand my eyes for a blind.
---
Very immersive.
---
I never argued that group leaders shouldn't be allowed to decide who they group with. Just because I agree with the majority on one issue doesn't mean I always have to agree with them. For the record I do think a lot of the majority opinions on this sub are stupid.
---
It'd be impossible for me to disagree with the sentiment you express in your second paragraph. I could imagine a scenario where I'm playing a game with someone who is so lazy that our team loses because he was the weakest link, and I know he could do better. I probably would be upset with him, or at least not want to play with him anymore. I just feel that someone playing a suboptimal wow character is on such a lighter degree of this concept that it's not worth me being upset about.
---
You're more than welcome to disagree with how severe of asshole-ery that behavior is, and group with people accordingly. Not every non minmaxer is a moron who would seek to deny you that right.
---
I don't think I'm going to continue this conversation, as I doubt either of us will convince the other of anything, and I'm not really in the habit of engaging in long, seemingly fruitless discussions. At least, not any longer than this. And even though you still seem like a bit of a prick to me, I'm sorry for kind of blowing up at you out of nowhere. This was clearly a mistake, and I apologize for wasting both of us's time.
---
When facing a big and difficult mob pack, my rotation is:
---
Cast Regrowth
---
Cast Rejuv
---
Cast Barkskin
---
Hop Into Bear Form
---
Faire Fire (Feral) on skull
---
Demo Roar
---
Swipe
---
Maul on skull
---
You don't need to target another mob for swipe if only 3 are present.
---
Basically this pull ensures that:
---
You have highest mitigation (barkskin)
---
Enough rage initially (furor and wolfshead helm at low level)
---
Really high threat on primary target (thanks to FF, maul, swipe)
---
High threat on everything else (swipes and heals)
---
Remember that you only need to gain threat on non-targeted mobs to beat the threat made by the healer, which isn't that much. On targeted, a few mauls can get you by.
---
At higher levels with better crit you can use swipe more and more because each crit will give you rage.
---
I play both sides so I always come out on top
---
You mean the second highest upvoted comment in the thread? The one that says it's not okay?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b2ko2o/why_so_much_hate_for_minmaxing/eit8ybi/
---
Second highest voted post in the thread says it's not ok.
---
Well yes, I’m gonna go his way as well. Otherwise we could just be on discord and make calculations on excel who has the best theoretical damage, as those pixels dont matter right? Its a roleplaying game.
---
Please, the water form quest forces you to travel to Westfall and the chest is difficult to find even with a guide and video. You will die from going out of breath or fatigue. Who puts a quest item into the fatigue zone?!
---
What does one person's character choice have to do with your enjoyment of the game. 
---
WTF 
---
20 hours and on a hunter. The fastest warrior on a new economy will probably be around 5 days. 
---
Is it safe to say that picking up herbalism or mining with skinning while leveling, is the best way to make gold?  
---
And if so, does one just vendor everything gathered from those professions or is it maybe better at certain point to go auction?
---
Hory sheet, normies downvoting me.
---
So where do you draw the line with the min-maxing? Are you telling ’no’ for everyone who isnt the ultimate optimal? Or is it just about spec? Or race? Or their whole gear? Their keybinds? 
---
Druids and Warlocks hands down.
---
As a former Warlock I still remember at LvL20, when I got my quest "Seeking Strahad". Basically it's a get to Ratchet quest. Now for alliance you have two choices. Get to Menethil Harbor, boat to Auberdine and run through Ashenvale and The Barrens. Or you can go through Duskwood and corpse run STV. Suffice to say on a PvP server you are screwed either way.
---
Still, every 10 level you have a quest for a new demon and a lot of good flavour quests. For example in Stormwind you get to poison an anti-warlock noble and there is also a quest for a great robe at level 31. I think I actually had that until the late 40s. And don't even get me started on the Dreadsteed quest. That stuff is completely awesome.
---
Always prehot crazy threat if you prehot before a pull because the healing aggro getting amplified with tank coefficient.
---
I'll take a week off work and get the bulk of the levelling done then.
---
But that is not true. Each race is pretty good, but at different things. Human beats everything else when talking about a PVE warrior tank and dps due to sword specialization. But will every warrior only roll swords/maces? If you have one or more non humans, you can give them axes, more option.
---
Dwarfs and gnomes are better at PvP. In a PvP server, the guild who is better at pvp is better at pve. Yeah, you lose some dps in BWL because of no sword specialization, but you lose even more if you wipe at the entrace to a horde raid and lose the wBuffs.
---
The only exception to this rule would be dwarf priests, because fear ward is just so stupidly broken. But at least Nelves can be good in BGs and PVPs, but fear ward is just so good. Does that mean I will only play with dwarves? Of course not.
---
It's okay but only druids use it early for tanking until they replace the ba gear in dungeons
---
I think  Warlock/Priest  is the best comp of the three, u have  no downtime, they deal more damage,  lots of healing and dmg mitigation, cc (mind the dr on fear) but cant aoe like the other comps can and both wear cloth do u have to compete for them.
---
shaman/druid might be slower but atleast is more diverse , decent aoe and can find dungeon groups easily while leveling.
---
Reminds me when Athene would eat raw broccoli when his Paladin was eating.
---
How is having fun a waste of time?
---
Are you or your wife azn? Your child could be valuable for your character's in-game economy.
---
A guy just wrote here that min-maxer should get removed entirely from playing the game.
---
And the op can't see anyone behaving like dicks, speaks volumes. 
---
Also got a couple of upvote, so it's not like this is the only guy thinking that way. 
---
Kek
---
Apex Legends has been the perfect cure for this. 
---
You need to see a doctor. Stat.
---
Comment is a bit vague. To me it seems like he's talking about pugs. And in pugs if you're not the leader, and telling other people how big assholes they are for not minmaxing as much as you, then yeah i think you deserve some hate because the rules are not yours to make. If it's a guild raid with clear rules that memespecs won't be brough then it's 100% fine. Same if you're the one leading the pug and setting the rules for it. Also he used the words "lash out" aka probably insulting whoever plays as a memespec instead of simply telling them they won't invite them. 
---
Definitely better dungeon tanks.
---
You can say the same thing to the same person in two different ways and get two different responses. Nerds have no tact though. 
---
OP asked for a solution
---
Blizz already did this when they launched new servers back then
---
They are actually among most played classes per faction.
---
How is something that negatively affects your ability to achieve a goal you set out to do fun?
---
It won't affect you as much as you think. It will cause the ocasional deaths on really populated zones at level 20 and below.
---
And we can make the argument that if the zone is THAT populated, it'll be easy to find groups to do those quests.
---
I feel the same way, lots of planning is put on hold until we can get a release date. Gotta come up with a plan to send my wife and 3 kids away for something fun for a while if the launch happens on a bad date :p
---
&gt; Please keep in mind that the answer to "progressing is too hard" should not be "then don't play".
---
But that's what classic is all about. It should be hard so we can have a sense of community.
---
I really think you want to play retail bro. Vanilla was fine when it launched and we had no sharding. It can be fine again.
---
Yeah shaman and paladin are least played overall, as theyre faction restricted. Per faction theyre among the most popular classes after warrior
---
Same goes for me, I started playing in BC and played throughout the years with about 15 RL Friends, and none of them are "coming back" for classic. 
---
It will be the first time for me to play wow without RL friends, that's why I'm a little afraid of my wow experience overall.
---
All 3 pixels of her? 
---
I have played both Vanilla and TBC extensively (on Blizzard servers).
---
I would never add anything from TBC into Vanilla.
---
I would never add anything from Vanilla into TBC.
---
The ONLY possibility that I, personally, would accept a mix between Vanilla and TBC is a WoW 2 game.
---
But, we don't have a WoW 2 in the works (yet).
---
I requested last week in July last week in August.
---
Could be wrong, but I don't think Kings lasted that long in vanilla; I believe it was 5 minutes. That's a different buff.
---
Yes not talking about exclusively raiding. He's talking about **groups.**
---
You're right, that part is pretty vague, but you're choosing to ignore the first part, that answers ops question (i.e. why don't people like minmaxers) with "because they wont invite shit specs to their groups"
---
My goal is to have fun, how does having fun negatively impact that?
---
Haha no i'm not, but the idea is interresting...  Need to convince my wife now.. 
---
There are so many items from engineering that is (almost) mandatory as a raiding warrior, and even more so if you are a tank.
---
- Resistance trinkets
---
- AoE tanking shield
---
- Grenades/Bombs/dynamites/Sapper charges
---
- Gnomish battle chicken (5% haste buff for your party for 5min woth 30min CD. Amazing for bosses)
---
- Arcanite Dragonling (Puts fire debuff on bosses that increases fire mage DPS and consequently raid dps).
---
- Lots and lots and LOTS of other gimmicks that will help you in both PvE and PvP.
---
I never had a problem. I can't remember how many I used to carry, but I never really had a problem with building them up. I always carried a few on me and then if I had a raid coming up I would just send some extra time farming to ensure I was in a good spot. Overall, it wasn't as time consuming as people make it out to be.
---
Already forgot the fatique part. Still liked it and I always level in Westfall so the travel wasn't a real problem for me.
---
Sure, but it's doable with a full time job! :)
---
It entirely depends on your guild. 
---
In my hardcore guild, every melee gets thee hearthstones, 0/2, 1/2, and 2/2. Others who need it get 2/2 depending on the raid.
---
Everyone is summoned to keep worldbuff timers up.
---
That is an absolute shitload of shards. And you won't be farming it right before the raid like a nooblet, because you need to be logged off along with everyone else to keep your world buffs up.
---
MS debuff takes up a debuff slot on bosses so no guild that even considers themselves half-serious will allow you to raid as arms.
---
I was talking about your other goal.
---
Well, someone in this very thread has argued that you're an asshole if you don't pick the best race for your class. 
---
A lot of that depends on how many locks are in your raid group.  Back in vanilla I was the only lock in my group and it was a pain in the ass farming HS/summons for everyone in the raid. Honestly its the one thing that almost makes me consider rolling a mage when Classic drops.
---
No way. Swipe has really poor scaling. Warriors can stack block to take no damage on aoe pulls if needed, or can fury tank with good gear which puts to shame every other dps or tank in the game, taking multiple packs with constant 1.5k + dps. Bears have a few nice moments but are rarely actually better than warriors, and warriors can do tons of things bears can’t.
---
Only downside of druid is that you always look at the same furry butt. Sure, eventually you have this awesome tier gear, but you look at your level 20 catform or lvl 10 bear form nonetheless. Only as a healer you can appreciate your looks.
---
Why would it? As far as I know, the protection systems that thwart .MPQ modifications cant really tell the difference between a modified character looks and a 100 feet high black lotus plant.
---
So, ignore my points where I provide a workable alternative that offers the least impact to everyone, then pretend that your opinion is fact. Nice job.
---
I'm done.
---
and a black lotus to be 100 feet tall as to make it alot more easier to find.
---
yeah... Blizzard wont allow modifications on their models. No way.
---
Yes, I agree. I'm gonna play a druid and do a bit of everything because I want to. If people don't want to group with me because of that, I don't really mind. I'm going to play with around 20 of my old guildies so it will be fine.
---
I just wanted to know where people who feel that non optimal characters are selfish draw the line.
---
"However, I happen to have the same education, work experience and name as him and I'm available from October 1st"

You should see BfA. +10 years of class balance. Much better than rusty old Vanilla or WotLK.
---
Same! Bird form was amazing.
---
So, my guess from few months back WAS correct... i knew if they are in schedule for summer release, GDC 2019 (18-22th) would be a great time to give information. The focus is on gaming news from other ppl too, so makes sense to release info at the same time to compete with others and get helped on the increased gaming industry spam.
---
If everyone in the raid plays the optimal race for their class it CAN absolutely make a difference. The 5 additional weapon skill that humans get accounts for about the same increase in percent to that characters overall DPS. Basically A human warrior in identic gear but with the added benefit of the weapon skill will do 5% more DPS than a dwarf in the same gear but with no weapon skill.
---
Apply that to a raid consisting of 6-8 warriors and 3-4 rogues.
---
LF39M MC!!!
---
&gt;"because they wont invite shit specs to their groups"
---
I don't think this is what anyone is saying (maybe an extreme minority). People are saying that minmaxers who are excessively hating on/berating/telling people how to play or that they're assholes for not playing optimally, in areas of the game where that's not the minmaxers right to dictate, that those particular minmaxers are assholes (a small minority of minmaxers i'm sure). Like pug dungeons/raids (where the insulting minmaxer is not the leader) or if you solo queue for a pug BG and run into a ret paladin, you are in the wrong for berating him and calling him an asshole in such cases, imo. 
---
I disagree that mp5 trumps (for priest at least). True, 1 mp5 = ~9 spirit outside of casting but if you can make it work, knowing your timing and encounter spirit woth right build gives more benefit. Meditation + spiritual healing + divine spirit gives both boost to regen AND healing at same time. Early in endgame mp5 (especially mind taps 11m/5) is beast but it falls off with progress. That is thing that you need yo balance for yourself.
---
tell him you are welcome on the condition you play with my classic. if you roll warrior, you force him on a priest. and after those 3 weeks he trade you all his gold and thank you for hosting him.
---
I tested it out back in the days of Vanilla. It was pretty fun and you could get some H.U.G.E damage spikes. I didn't stick with the build myself, but I would certainly say that it's viable and a lot of fun.
---
Yeh I did that after the announcement with my cousin we leveled to max got pre bis then the server died because every pserver released a new realm and I wasn’t about to spend time leveling again for it to all be a waste. So now I’m waiting till official launch. The game was still amazing even on a pserver. 
---
Hello fellow Pittsburgher
---
Can you aquire them during trash?
---
I'm in the exact same boat. Our summer vacation planing is due in a few weeks.
---
they really need to tell us a date by mid april if it is releasing in july  and by the end of this month if it is releasing in june.
---
Well, to be really fair, a difficult mob pack should be partly CC'd. Some healers in leveling gear can't keep up healing you if 3-4 mobs beat you down. 
---
I honestly don't know.
---
I might take some days off depending on when its released and how many days of holiday I can burn.
---
But outside of that initial zerg, I'll probably be happy if I can work WoW in very much at all outside of my normal day-to-day commitments. :( 
---
It's a shame I don't get off of work at 3:30 and have someone to cook me meals and all of that. Highschool sucked and was pretty stressful but at least I had more "free" time.
---
You'll meet plenty of people ingame that share your mindset, more than those who don't.
---
Raiders/minmaxers/powerlevelers/ etc. exist in every game and they can be very useful to the community as a whole but they are always a minority of the playerbase, yet the majority of those who write on the forums.
---
Keep that in mind when reading forums/reddit and stop worrying, you won't be alone.
---
Holy fuck, that is impressive.
---
Shaman has better AoE Healing, Priest has better overall healing. 
---
Shammy has more utility and totems are epic - but Priest comes with CC at 60 in UD instances. 
---
Shammy has Ankh though. 
---
It's a toss up. I personally think shamans are more fun.
---
I wouldn't go Druid for healing purposes at 60 because no res makes it not as useful as the other two. 
---
You can, it's just harder as you have to get the killing blow on the trash mob. 
---
You're still giving me justifications about why loot trading and sharding are good. :p
---
I'm not arguing that they are good, I'm just saying that they are so far off from vanilla , vanilla didnt have these and pservers in general tend to try to recreate vanilla , even though some fail but others are pretty damn close, in which case I'm only trying to show you that since some pservers are very close to perfect, basically almost exactly what classic is going to look like but without the loot trading and sharding.
---
By the way, im not talking about all the garbage pservers, there are good ones which I can't name sadly but know that I'm talking about ND mostly here, it has accurate exp rates , drops rates  and everything,it's not perfect but damned close.
---
The down side to this is larger populations and no filtering of massive players in a zone, which is why I'm debating which one of these is closer to vanilla, in my eyes even though servers like ND have massive pop they are still closer to vanilla design mainly because the features in classic just didn't exist in vanilla.
---
Nope. There's a difference between "sorry no ferals, we need more DPS" and "lol feral what a joke git gud scrub and roll a real spec." 
---
The former is perfectly acceptable, the latter is being an asshole which rubs people the wrong way.
---
BM Hunter is the best levelling spec in the game imo
---
But this mean he will face little competition. Only others like him (leveling as fast as possible AND skilling fishing at the same time) will be able to participate. Which will not be many. Most people are either rushers to 60s (and they skill up their stuff) or casual players skilling everything while leveling
---
Sure, but for raids, no one will take seriously.
---
Absolutely, loved my lock quests!
---
Got proof?
---
well most pple here probably wont get to 60 during vacation time. If you have to lock in weeks soon be safe and put them in August. You might miss launch and fall behind a little but it would not be fun being home for 5 weeks doing nothing and then it launches when you go back to work.
---
No, you dont
---
I'm waiting for streamers to announce which realms they're playing on just so I can avoid them. The crowd which streamers bring is something I definitely don't want to be involved with. 
---
That’s awesome. Similarly, yesterday I grouped with a 31 warrior (who I’m assuming was an alt) who out of no where asked me if I wanted green iron gear because he was leveling his blacksmithing. Later on in the mail he sent me a helm, shoulders, legs, boots, and gloves free of charge, which I’m sure wasn’t optimal for leveling it up.
---
Yeah that's what I mean. A non optimal class/race combo spamming sapper charges and pots can perform better than an optimal class/race combo. I'm just curious where the line is drawn. Seems most hate on non optimal specs but I doubt most require playing optimally.
---
I should've clarified. I'm not sure which class does most damage but let's say it's rogues. If a guild is min maxing, it would be best to only bring the needed amount of other classes and fill the raid with rogues no? Same could say with healers. Priests are the best afaik, why bring more than one druid for example?
---
Doesn't have to be raids. I've seen people being called out for wanting to play feral/ret/whatever in 5 man as well because it's not optimal. I know all 5 mans are easily doable with pretty much any comp as long as you have some sort of tank, healer and dps. 
---
Warrior is basically the absolute best choice for tanking in Vanilla, with Druids or Paladins sometimes serving as off-tanks or maybe main tanks in non-raid situations (but, honestly, rarely in raids).
---
As far as race, there are a lot of good options. I don't think you can go *wrong* really. 
---
*Hyperventilating* 😬
---
Yea I have a write up on my plans as long as I can get the time off.
---
Why do you think Resto PVP is not fun? I only have PVP exp with my Holy Paladin and that was really fun. However I'm thinking about rolling a Druid in Classic. Would you share your experiences? I always imagined throwing out HoTs, Roots, Fairy Fires and being able to Prowl to be fun.

I have a few friends who are playing classic private servers for last decade and they are leveling with no life and then sell the account for \~50-300$. I bet a classic on retail will make this prices even bigger. So few my friends are preparing for this rush on few first months just because a prices will be outnormous. 
---
&gt; I don’t wanna play whatever game I’ve been playing I want to start my adventures in classic
---
My god yes! I've been browsing through my old vids and screenshots from back then, and while I *know* it's never going to be the same as back then there are so many things I can't wait to do again.
---
I'm even looking forward to listening to audio books while grinding elementals in Arathi highlands for level-40-mount-money.
---
Agreed, no idea why you got downvoted for this.
---
I thought I somehow missed that as a nickname for a decade you had me worried
---
I’m doing a test run to 60 on a Vanilla private server in preparation for classic. This helps keep my gaming drive alive until release.
---
Sorta more relative to the other players gear level, aq for a general answer though, warriors get more rage in crits a crit steroid bonus, and a bleeding crit steroid, on top of doing more damage after receiving a crit so they scale extremely well as long as you keep your gear current though you will be fine.
---
No I am in the wrong I said something positive about BFA. It’s like saying there’s old gods in BFA. It’s not a thing. (I love old memes)
---
If all you've been playing ever since TBC have been EQ1 and RuneScape and handling spreadsheets... then you will need a new rig, hell of a powerful rig with dedicated graphics and all that, so a mini-itx size desktop at least, because laptops can't really handle the single thread performance 40-man raids require.
---
Pretty sure no ones offered you so I guess you don’t have to worry about that. 
---
Well mages help a lot.
---
Go to ZG isle and get ZG buff, mage port to sw get dmf buff then ony, mage port to Darnassus and fly to felwood to get songflower buff. Port to City closest to the raid you want to run.
---
I did mean 4 days 20h just to be clear. 
---
In dungeons, there's no reason a feral with healing gear shouldn't be able to heal if asked to, and boomkin would be easier than feral.
---
When you ask to join a group people will ask "what spec" or "can you heal". Very rarely will you hear "are you 5/10/36?" Because in a PuG dungeon, that means very little compared to the person's skill and their gear.
---
yup. i set up my own offline private server to test and theorycraft. i did it with the intent of trying it for a few hours. now i find myself spending 10s of hours on it. i probably have over 25 hours by now.
---
However, i am taking the initiative not to touch it for the next 3 months.
---
I am currently finishing to download metro exodus. i will play it while i download sekiro. then after sekiro  i will hardcore the division 2. Those 3 should keep me occupied for the next 2 months.

So release date announced 5 weeks from now?

I will try to avoid my vanilla mistakes and not play a character who will be terrible in raids because at last we all meet there. So I am considering warrior/mage/rogue/warlock. I dream to play pally/shammy, but I don't want to be one of those who are waiting in queue for raid while there is another 20 pallies in a guild who are way better geared than me.
---
Why are you trying to skip leveling so fast? For me at least, a big draw of older MMOs, including WoW Classic is the journey getting there. Getting to explore new lands, shooting the breeze in town, helping others out in the open world, all that goodness. I might roll Horde to see all these "new" zones just because I played Alliance back in the day.
---
*Cow* can I? 
---
HaHahaahaha... ok.
---
Same feeling! Which server out of interest? Just hit level 25 and i am loving it :)
---
Lol, my bad ! I would say : convince her to trade our futur daughter for in-game benefits. :p
---
Hots are too weak in PVP. Holy paladins are great in PVP, but that's due to their utility and flat instant heals. Unfortunately as much as I love Vanilla, resilience was one of many key factors that propelled resto druids to stardom in TBC. Hots are just very weak, which is also why they're not used in raiding (if you're trying to min-max, it's all about the various downranking of Healing Touch).
---
Anyway, yeah, it's just that hots are weak in PVP. If you love being a flag carrier in WSG you'll love druids, but put them in arathi basin, and you've got zero reason to take them over a priest or pal.
---
I love druids too, this comes from a place of love.
---
I wish I could play more but I will pretty much only be able to play on weekends. 
---
But most weekends I can go pretty hard so I should still land on 10-16hours a week. Will fight my way to 60 slowly but surely :)
---
Ah ok, you got me scared for a bit. Yeah I guess it will be beaten, but still I think that 7 days IRL are not enough to level a warrior (especially one that is first char, without a main funneling gear and consumables). 
---
Most guilds start with DM tribute buffs and skip the felwood part
---
There is no need for marketing yet, considering almost everybody knows it is in development.  
---
1-2 months prior the release is the time to advertise it better.
---
I feel you. 
---
But just the other day I've done ST, where the dragons can't be polymorphed, can't be banished, can't be hibernated (due to them being part of the Green Dragonflight). We also didn't have a hunter with us, and no warrior or priest for aoe fear. We had a rather average paladin healer (with no spirit or int on his gear, whats up with that?) 2 mages and a warlock, and me as beartank. Not the best composition, I know.
---
After me as tank dying to one of the harder packs we figured using blizzard and me kiting 2-3 of the mobs is better, but still there are situations where I just tanked them, since this was a PUG and that seemed easier at the time.
---
Yes, it's a terrible and ongoing problem. I occasionally lose consciousness from holding it too long.
---
Yep, that comment was just very ignorant. I have built multiple rigs for Vanilla wow private servers and the CPU is the most important piece. In fact almost nothing else matters at all, you can do fine without graphics card, you would have same FPS with with freaking DDR2 memory and any HDD would do with somewhat longer loading times between zones. CPU is the king of Classic wow. I would put half of the budget to CPU and half to everything else combined.
---
While they are unpopular overall... on their respective factions you are going to see A LOT of them. A lot.
---
I'm one of the casuals since I can't devote the time needed to minmax properly. It has nothing to do with my ego. The people complaining about minmaxing however...
---
Okay so far Ony and ZG, this means having people that have saved the heads in their banks and coordinating one person to turn it in per week? Songflower buff I'll look up, but what's DMF buff?
---
The madman who runs all the wings
---
I haven't raided on my current pserver yet, but I frequently get Onyxia and ZF buffs just by standing around BB and SW. So it's not just hc raiders doing this, but everybody. And why wouldn't you do this? It's really easy.
---
Basically some of your guild members keep the heart/head trophies you've earned from the raid last week. Then the whole raid meets up in a city, and goes around and pops these with the whole raid being there. Comment below explained the usual route.
---
These buffs last 1-2 hours but don't pesist upon death, so wiping from PvP at the entrance is a real pain.
---
And trust me, these buffs are stupidly strong. The onyxia one alone gives me enough rage as a bear tank to be able to spam swipes.
---
I wouldn't go hunter / shammy personally as they don't really compliment each other that much. The other options seem more viable though.
---
That was a fun read, I wish you all the best luck... I will be taking 2 or 3 weeks off to level my rogue. I won't be going for server first or anything like that but I do want to have a leveled 60 before I go back to work. Cheers!
---
If you put that in, this will turn into the fitness regime of One Punch Man.
---
Chicken, rice, fruit/veg smoothies and fiber. That should be your only diet. Other than that, you should induce Ketosis by fasting 10-12 hours per day. Have 2 large courses. That also reduces your time eating = more game time.
---
I still can't decide, it is so hard.
---
I started out as an Orc Hunter in retail which is what I am leaning to for my first character.
---
However, Orc Shaman en Undead Spriest seems such good choices for what I have in mind and also from a fantasy perspective they are really cool.
---
Okay, so not so crazy as I imagined. Thank you!
---
I love the comments in the screencap lmao
---
4 weeks off work. House empty. Schedule cleared. Cat fed.
---
Another day another clickbait video
---
You're saying that pservers are closer to vanilla than classic is. You say it's because of loot trading and sharding.
---
You won't have sharding on vanilla.  You'll have a smooth launch because of sharding though. But nothing you'll really notice and nothing that'll actually be in the game. So nothing is changed in this departement aorund 99.9999999999% of your game time in vanilla if you play regularly. All of that time is after the first 1-2 weeks as well..
---
So, start playing after 2 weeks and you'll ONLY have loot trading that's different. 
---
Other than that, Classic fix the maybe over 1 000 things pservers got wrong.
---
You're saying that something that have almost everything wrong, even if it's close. Is more like vanilla, than something that actually is exactly as vanilla, except for loot trading (which was still in vanilla through GMs, it's just how it works that change).
---
Now i've explained it in very different ways a few times. Can you please stop now?  Just play Pservers then, and we'll enjoy the real classic :)

Semi-Hardcore/Casual | PvP | US-East | Horde
---
Hello! &lt;Magic&gt; is recruiting new members to for world pvp and casual raiding. Our team has an experienced/knowledgeable community. &lt;Magic&gt; is building an army to decimate the alliance and pve as well.
---
**Our Goals:**
---
\- Aiming to hit level 60 within 2-3 months of release. We'll accept all members and work with your schedule. We aim to have fun, and play semi-serious as well.
---
**Expectations:**
---
\- Willing to listen and learn
---
\-Communicate somewhat effectively
---
**Schedule:**
---
\-Hoping to avoid late night raids on weeknights. Maybe 6-9 EST a couple nights a week. If that doesn't work, we'll do the weekend. It's really up to our members to decide what works best; and it's too early to make that decision.
---
Nailed it.
---
\&gt; Summer is right around the corner 
---
 *Summer 2019 in Northern Hemisphere will begin on Friday, June 21*
---
Even by "colloquial" standards, summer doesn't begin until June 1st.  May if you want to really stretch the boundaries.
---
We have over a full month before summer even hits.  Hell, I woke up this morning and it was 42 degrees outside, cold enough to warrant a jacket.
---
That is not summer, nor is it even close to it.
---
**TLDR: This sub is mercurial and puerile as hell.**
---
8 would agree. I'd take 6 hours a sleep non stop gaming 8 days. That's my plan at least. 
---
Haha, kinda reminds me of this:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w9DUTcAI0o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w9DUTcAI0o)
---
This is awesome.
---
But not as awesome as one I saw that had "LFM UBRS", hahaha. 
---
enjoying the game literally requires having something to enjoy, doesn't it? if you burn it in a week aren't you out of it ? Raiding is still there two weeks later, see what I mean ?
---
I'm leveling a warrior alt with a druid pockethealer. It still feels crap with the constant misses, being rage starved, no movement speed. Can't imagine how much torture it is solo without constant hots coming from your buddy.
---
Lets say you join a normal raiding guild that wants to clear MC a few months after server launch. You should know what talents are good for your raiding role and ofc you need to respec. 
---
You should bring your own pots and buffs. If you have been 60 for a few weeks you should have some pre raid BIS gear. 
---
It is too much to ask of the other 39 ppl pick up your slack.
---
ofcourse i would help a person figure out thier keybinds if i see them stuggling.
---
Dire Maul. When you only kill the endboss you will become the new king and you will get a lot of buffs from your new oger subjects (they will be friendly after the endboss kill). 
---
To be honest, we raided Nax back then and rarly min/maxed like this. Ony head sure, also potions and stuff like that but nothing else. I guess the whole worlds buff thing is a meta-thing from the pservers where they got way more time to find other and probably more effective ways of raiding.
---
That is my plan as well.
---
It's hard, I went dual weilding fury because I cant stand missing with a slow 2 hander and no rage. atleast with dual weilding I can get a better crit chance since I have two weapons and let flurry take over lol. 
---
I'll be honest you had me in the first half
---
[since you are so tuned in yet you didn’t watch anything from blizzcon](https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM) 
---
So far, not crazy with only 3 of us in a 40m.  I typically have 30 or so and am okay.
---
What is life?
---
The point is that dynamic spawns have an effect on gameplay whereas sharding doesn't. 
---
Seeing 100 people in redridge instead of 500 isn't going to change your gameplay experience.
---
Thanks for the diet plan. I actually have been doing KETO for almost a year now with fasting 20/4 and sometimes 72 hour fasts and am down 60lbs with about 20 more to go.
---
But I'll have you know, I am gonna eat myself a stuffed crust pizza from pizza hut on launch day because totally worth. I hope I get all the feels back from original vanilla lol. 
---
I'm not talking about content being *difficult*, I'm talking about not being able to tag anything because some people think having 600 people in the Valley of Trials is "the vanilla experience."
---
&gt;So on Razorgore you could completely skip having new adds spawn by simply kiting the starting 5-9 adds around the ramp. Using slowing totems and whatnot to keep the kiter from taking damage, the raid would idely watch on as the warrior kited these mobs up and around the ramp until all eggs were destroyed.
---
I think the dragons had maximum number of spawns, this might be what we did in actual vanilla too. Cant remember for sure. But in private servers you just KILL them all. Because you have loads more dps.
---
Plan to stream it 25 hours minimun / week 😅
---
Oh sure, life would be boring af without some goodies every once in a while.
---
It's just that eating fast food consistently while gaming is bad idea. It really takes a toll on your body. (I know from my childhood LUL)
---
My main of course so Human Paladin and then do a hunter alt after thats done though alot slower and enjoy everything on it.
---
Jesus if you think Horde has a bad Ony attunement then you shouldnt roll Ally, just look it up, its way worse.
---
NE Priest.

My permanent residence will be the Booty Bay boat.

Nobody runs all wings of DM and you either do Maraudon (quest run being implied) or princess run. You don't do purple or orange (but to be honest you should, it is a really long dungeon)

I get married 14th June, with honeymoon 27th July to 10th August - it's like a game of minesweeper for release date!
---
I always kept 40-50 shards on me so it wasn't too much of a problem. It's really no big deal since you're always doing "something" in WoW which involves killing mobs so I never had a problem having them on me - apart from the inventory space.
---
It's not just summoning "slackers", it's about keeping the world buffs on them. I've only passed healthstones for the tanks and maybe a rogue every now and then. The most important thing is SS-ing a healer for wipe recovery.

Yeah. I don't get fast food anymore. Every once in a while I go out and get myself a burger and a french fry because I dont want to completely never look back at that stuff, but I am not eating taco bell 4 times a week, a pizza once a week, and drinking a 24 pack of sunkist orange pop in a week either lol. I wish when I was a kid I knew what I knew today, because holy cow why did my parents let me eat like that lol. 
---
To be honest one of the most fun part of vanilla is the leveling. You can do that in any pace you like. You just have to watch your friends careful, see who plays how much and align yourself with those who are leveling at a similar pace.
---
Thanks m8 glad you liked it!
---
A friend and I did and I’d recommend it if nothing other than the purpose of learning the quests and zones again for when it comes time to level up. 
---
I thought for sure we'd get an announcement 3/18, as it was the 15th anniversary of the start of the vanilla beta.
---
I have noticed that the big info drops the past couple weeks have all come just a few minutes before noon EST.  
---
I now wait with baited breath, spamming refresh on the blue trackers, for 10 minutes each day from 11:55 to 12:05.  THIS IS NO WAY TO LIVE!!!
---
&gt; "because they wont invite shit specs to their groups"
---
This is why people don't like min/maxers: because you're condescending towards anyone else who doesn't have the same mindset.
---
"Sorry man, we need a pure DPS class" &lt;- A-okay
---
"Sorry man, we don't have room for shit DPS" &lt;- being an asshole, what you're doing 
---
It's really that simple. The majority of the people in both this thread, and the thread this post references, are fine with raid and group leaders selecting specific specs. They are *not* okay with group leaders insulting, berating, or making demands of other players for it.
---
I got s solution, but its kinda wild. 
---
If you like to min-max, join a min-max guild and vise versa. 
---
Some are able to care about minmaxing without being stupid assholes, some are not. And those who can not can go fuck themselves.
---
lol you're giving false hope to them 
---
That’s what toon number two it for. Lol! Nah, look, my whole wow career (last 13 years) I’ve been shooting the breeze and exploring new lands. I’ve never been a max level character and raiding current content, I’ve done all the stop and smell the roses you can possibly do. I want to play the endgame for once in my life. This is me trying the other side 
---
Here's a great in-depth video about duo leveling by Kargoz, give it a watch, it should answer any questions you have! :-) https://youtu.be/8YCBd1VZVb4
---
What do you mean "cascaded her constantly"? Just wondering, I don't understand what it means. Never heard of this.
---
Hmm I guess at that point you could still swap if you feel like doing so without losing to much in terms of time investment. 
---
I think you are right on that, and even if I wanted to, I could just roll a 2nd character.
---
Yes, very much.  I hate it.  I'm trying to bang out some older final fantasy titles that I have been neglecting to complete but between class and new shows with the wife I have not done much gaming.  In my mind I am taking a break from hard gaming because I can not wait to glue myself to my chair and 'WOW the fuck out of my computer'.
---
You are free to play with whomever you like. But in your special case, the problem is that you're an asshole about it, and now you even start to whine about being called an asshole for, well, acting like an asshole.
---
It is especially painful after playing druid with furor and wolfshead helm. Every time I needed bear form I had enough rage to do something. With warrior, especially at low levels? Hahahaha.
---
That says it's not okay to lash out at people who don't min/max.
---
Are you saying it *is* okay to lash out at them?
---
Me too, but I keep accidentally piling games on the list instead of playing them :(
---
If blizzard doesn't change it from 1.12, those buffs are going to be a lot rarer than they are on pservers.
---
The fact that you think Taurens would be down for leatherworking... is disturbing...
---
The Warrior and Resto Sham were both T6 / Sunwell geared.  Me, the Ret and the Enh Sham were ~T5ish.
---
I'm aiming to take at least a week off work. I don't want to loose track of my other hobbies and responsibilities, but I should still easily have 4-5hrs a day to spend on the game if I want to. 
---
I never really started adulting and I'm just fine with that.
---
I'm now torn between druid and warrior. Turns out tanking is the one thing I enjoy the most in dungeons and I'm afraid my beartank won't be enough at classic. On the other hand, being the jack of all trades and master of pvp is just amazing.
---
To a lot of people, the real fun starts at 60. Especially when you’ve done the leveling from 1-60 so many times.
---
Spirit is decent for leveling warriors - though it's not as good as it is for priests. If he can get his hands on a good weapon with spirit - good, but he shouldn't roll that away from you.
---
Doesn't change the fact that you can't do those weird LoS "mechanics" in retail anymore. 
---
Baby, don't hurt me.
---
Staffs have kind of the same DPS but always have a low speed, which increases it's max damage and thus increased the damage from attack abilitys. The DPS is lower on higher lvls.
---
Though, staffs usually only have stamina as a stat your Warrior would want and he'd be a prick if he took a staff from a magic user.
---
I wouldn't even say it has to be new. I would be in the market for used as well. Look for a used laptop with a dedicated graphics card (something that won't use your RAM) and pop a SSD in the laptop and you are good to go.

If you use 30-40 of those on huhuran poison damage phase, you can just burn him down and nobody takes any damage. You get like extra 90-120 targets for the aoe damage... Not to mention they do pretty nice damage. And you dont have to use any NR gear...

&gt; It's really that simple. The majority of the people in both this thread, and the thread this post references, are fine with raid and group leaders selecting specific specs.
---
Is mutually exclusive with 
---
&gt; They are not okay with group leaders insulting, berating, or making demands of other players for it.
---
They both cannot be true, so which one is it.
---
I'm going to start with a Human Warlock. Because your first character really has to blaze a trail of being SUPER poor and must have the ability to be self reliant. To me, that means the Human quest path + the warlock class lends itself to setting up a healthy start to my future stable of alts
---
Orc Hunter, so I can farm for my main. (troll resto shaman)
---
It’s so hilarious to see all of the like minded 30 year olds who just wanna get down and game like the old days. 
---
One thing I really hate in low level dungeons is healers with no spirit and only +healing. You don't need that miniscule healing power to heal since low level healing spells are quite powerful, but you do need to regen mana during pulls. A good healer never has to stop a party for drinking, but for that you need spirit.
---
Warlock probably.
---
That being said, I played a Warrior in vanilla and I thought their quests were pretty cool. I was alliance and I got a quest somewhere in the 20’s to go to Stonetalon and slay some Chimeras to use their parts in some new mail armor. I had never even heard of Stonetalon at the time and I can still remember venturing there to this day. Really felt epic.
---
Also WW Axe is badass and super strong if you get it early, but you’re definitely going to need a lot of help if you wanna get it ASAP.
---
Early vanilla had different item stats. Almost no item had spellpower.
---
 Some additional observations:  
---
The wand talent is indeed quite useless. Arcane Missiles + Clearcasting is such a bomb that you'll never run out of mana anyway, if you've specced accordingly around level 19/20.   
---
I might be completely wrong, but Improved Arcane Explosion hardly seems useful either.. even for me as a tailor who likes to farm stuff. Arcane Explosion does wonders for AoE farming, but the difference with the talent seems kinda negligible anyway. Clearcasting + Mana shield + Arcane Focus (skip the two last points, because you've already hitcapped yourself for +2 level mobs) go already does the trick. And you don't wanna farm mobs that are more than say, one (or in the worst case scenario - two) level(s) above you, anyway. 
---
Now for the downside: while Arcane works extremely smoothly, it can get a bit dull at times in open world PvE. I just do level 1 frost bolt (unless I'm on clearcasting which would make that a complete waste) then spam Arcane Missiles and everything dies. Drinking hardly ever needed – heck I even forget to use invocation at times. Yes, there's the occasional sheeping and nova and such – but it feels a little dumbed down compared to frost.   
---
What I'll be aiming for eventually is something like this:   
---
  [http://classicdb.ch/?talent#ocxi0RcquZbhhh](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#ocxi0RcquZbhhh)   
---
 (a bit tempted to go for the Counterspell talent as well – though I don't feel I've had any problems with solo survivability so far. But looks neat to me.)  
---
Suggestions welcome. Although please note that I'm not looking to minmax things.. just a fun spec for some casual PvE and the occasional PvP.   
---
  =) 
---
&gt; That says it's not okay to lash out at people who don't min/max.
---
It also says you're not allowed to choose who to group with.
---
&gt; Are you saying it is okay to lash out at them?
---
I mean, that depends on what you would qualify as lash out, but in the sense you would frame it if I said yes, I definitely do not think is okay.
---
It's because they are.  It's obvious you did one for fun, got a fair amount of upvotes on it, and then proceeded to karma whore the shit out of the rest of them.  
---
The only reason your first few got upvotes was because people thought you were hand-drawing these.  (literally if you look at the comments on the first 2 people were like "this is amazing!  this is incredible detail!")
---
Once people found out you were using essentially using pre-rendered art assets similar to Mario Paint stamps the karma farm stopped.
---
Then I read the last thread where you quite literally said "I'll keep this one up until the next one is ready to post, then this will be deleted.  PM me for copies if you want them."
---
What's more hilarious is you're so very much trying to karma farm because you have reddit premium account on a 4 month old account.  Enjoy paying 30 bucks a year to post "ad free". 
---
I'd rather see the same "what spec should I roll" or "what class should I play" questions every week than someone intentionally trying to karma farm; especially with pre-rendered assets.
---
I probably would have been perfectly at home in a guild like that, too.  I think a big part of why I was able to stick it out through WotLK was that there were 10-man variants of the raids.  In our guild, there were probably ~12 players who would have belonged in any of the worlds best guilds, and then another ~30 super duper casual players who weren't very good.  But the 12 of us really liked the other 30 and had fun shooting the shit in Vent, and the core squad stayed geared doing the 10-man hard modes, so it wasn't as frustrating as it could have been.
---
How so? By having an open-to-any specs guild, is false hoping? You are the ones that will have problem finding guildmates, not me ;)
---
Big question is if this will work in Classic anyway. Most if not all Pservers never implemented World Buffs correctly i think. Atleast every pserver i know lets you get for example the Ony buff all the time. While when Vanilla was current you could only get the buff every 2 hours. This might be the same for the ZG buff, not 100% sure though. 
---
I wish I could do all these things but I feel like I had my period of no life back when it was all original and I can’t see myself having the opportunity to take off work for it.
---
That being said I can easily see myself putting around 20 hours or so in the first week, but gonna are the days of 40-60 hours for a game. 
---
Classic isnt an expansion at all!
---
No, pretty sure it was done earlier too. You just spammed mana pots and runes to keep it up. 
---
Technically anyone can roll on anything. Getting your group to not kick you is the problem
---
SSD is a luxury and is in no way required when on a budget
---
Yes, it did the last few months but Division 2 right now is fun and I hope it stays this way until Classic Release.
---
&gt;&gt; "Sorry man, we don't have room for shit DPS" &lt;- being an asshole, what you're doing
---
&gt;I've literally never done this, but for the 3rd time, you need to invent things in your head to make me seem like the bad guy.
---
You have called non minmaxers assholes, referenced "shit specs," and demanded to know how people have fun in sub-optimal specs constantly. How are you not doing this?
---
&gt;&gt; It's really that simple. The majority of the people in both this thread, and the thread this post references, are fine with raid and group leaders selecting specific specs.

---
&gt;&gt; They are not okay with group leaders insulting, berating, or making demands of other players for it.
---
&gt;They both cannot be true, so which one is it.
---
I literally said it. I gave an example in my post.
---
This is not berating, insulting, or making demands:
---
&gt; Sorry man, we need a pure DPS class
---
This is berating, insulting, or making demands:
---
&gt; Sorry man, we don't need a shit DPS spec
---
Do you honestly not see a difference in presentation and tact between the two hypothetical responses? 
---
It's entirely possible that AE is inefficient in comparison to blizzard. Mana hasn't been a problem though - clearcasting and invocation and all that. Obviously - I can't just completely mindlessly pull any amount of mobs around the same level - but 3/4/5 for a little cloth farming etc forks fine enough.
---
I actually prefer the brez over regular one. You aren't supposed to wipe more than once in a 2 hour dungeon run, so you don't really save any time with rezzing people, especially if you die with them.
---
But brez has MUCH shorter cast time, can be used in combat and gives you quite a bit of health and mana. The perfect oh-shit/wipe-prevention spell.
---
Closer to 600e would be more realistic 
---
I am also going to take a week for this but it won't be at launch due to the inevitable amount of issues almost every launch has.  It will probably be a week or two in.  I'm not going full ham because I will need something like lawn work and household chores to break up the sit fest that will be vanilla wow.  I might even raise my desk to make it a standing one but it requires re-configuring for that so probably not.
---
Wrong. Druids are just as good, if not better, tanks than warrior and can do okayish dps for a 5man.
---
I think druid stands out the most for me.  Moonglade is a place only druids can go and that's cool.  Shaman is a close 2nd though.  I really enjoyed the communing and binding elementals to your totems.  Sometimes it's forgotten Shaman are one with the elements just as druids are with the earthmother.
---
Good point but games always get silly at the extreme ends. 
---
You see NE/UD warriors, Tauren shamans and other Tier.B races all the time. So I don't think of it as a big problem.
---
Besides is that a good reason to hate min-maxers? Cause they figured it out.
---
He is asking to play on a laptop... SSD would be a must not a luxury. You want to play wow on a crappy 5400RPM spinny drive? His instance, hearth, death, all those load times will be crap. Plus a 250GB drive is like $60 that's more than enough for Windows and WoW.
---
Thanks
---
1. I play a hunter, I never really die.
---
2. Would happen.
---
3. I always leave general chat.
---
4. No idea why that should give me PTSD.
---
5. I play Alliance.
---
6. Never had this confusion happen to me.
---
7. I am that hunter.
---
So, 10 squats now and then. Guess I'll just stay fat.
---
At least you dont die stupid
---
Broodlord Lashlayer, chromaggus and nefarian is a 100% no go. 
---
Magmadar and onyxia if you are horde. 
---
Broodlord 1 or 2 shots you in gear from mc+bwl with 8-9k mortar strikes, chromaggus hits for about 5k in private servers the last 20% or so and he hits really fast.
---
&gt;&gt; That says it's not okay to lash out at people who don't min/max.
---
&gt;It also says you're not allowed to choose who to group with.
---
No, it doesn't. Quote exactly where it says that.
---
Well said.
---
&lt;3
---
It's like religion. It's fine to enjoy doing it, but once you shove it down people's throughts it gets annoying.
---
Do DM tribute, get mage portal to darnassus, fly to felwood and get songflower, HS to Westfall and logout until raid is due. Login and join raid, go to zg Island and get zg buff, portal to stormwind and get onyxia buff. Then you are set for raid.
---
If dark moon fair is up you weave that in in different ways. Either get DM tribute buffs then HS to stormwind and pray getting a 10% DMF, if you get one, get portal to darnassus and repeat from that step same as above.
---
I have said this before in a similar post, but I took 2 years off back in December so I will just no-life the crap out of classic WoW.
---
If it drops at a good time then I'll take a week off to enjoy the leveling race if I can. After that? Unlikely that I'll be able to keep a raiding schedule for at least the first half year so that blows.
---
Loving The Division 2. 
---
I’m not going to hire anyone to do any of that shit, I’m just not gonna do it at all, does it really matter that much if you don’t cut your lawn for a week? It must grow ridiculously fast.
---
As for no lifting I’ll probably average 8 hours a day for at least the first month
---
The thread in no way specifies early pre spell power vanilla though
---
Hunter have the single best class quest, but most others have more in general. Druid bear form quest is great, and Pallies/Shaman have some cool stuff early on.
---
Then get ganked by the pvp guild stood outside the instance and lose all your buffs!
---
Definitely has made my retail wow experience pretty crappy knowing Classic is coming. 
---
NE hunter because that is what I thrive at in pservers, and it's better to have a hunter early on before they suffer from scaling.
---
Is there a guide to Darkmaster Gandling? I tried googling, but it seems I’m the only person who has trouble with him. My biggest issue is, he’ll teleport me (the tank), and as a Prot Warrior, I can’t kill the skeletons before a second wave spawns. 
---
&gt; You have called non minmaxers assholes
---
Yes, but not for not minmaxing.
---
&gt; referenced "shit specs,"
---
Do you not see the difference between calling a player shit and calling a spec shit?
---
&gt; demanded to know how people have fun in sub-optimal specs constantly. How are you not doing this?
---
Yea, when people use "but it's fun" as an argument for something unethical, it seems pretty reasonable to ask why they find it fun.
---
If someone supported murder because it's fun, I'd personally like to know what they find fun about it.
---
&gt; Do you honestly not see a difference in presentation and tact between the two hypothetical responses?
---
I do see the difference one is a whitelist the other is a blacklist, but I disagree with your interpretation, both are demanding, neither is berating or insulting.
---
Do they even sell laptops without SSD nowadays? Haven't seen one in my country for years.
---
OP, 300€ would only give you integrated graphics which has an average 10-20 fps in WoW. Unless you buy used, you're looking at atleast 400€ eur to play on medium/low graphics with stable fps, maybe even close to 500€ depending on how expensive your country is.
---
I initially wanted to be a troll priest, but a few good friends have said they are only rolling alliance, so probably a human priest. Back in vanilla I used to play an undead warlock, had so much fun on that character, levelled as destruction with my trusty succubus sidekick... It was ineffective to say the least. 
---
A lot of the weapons are good for Hunter, but engineering’s probably better for them. 
---
Indeed!
---
&gt; the hate is more directed towards those who demand that others minmax
---
The main issue is that once you switch to WWA or whatever at L30-40 then you'll have to grind up weapon skill from scratch. It's not the end of the world through, just expect some downtime.
---
But now *he* has to go through the effort of playing with who he likes, instead of everyone playing like him. Why would you put that kind of weight on his shoulders? So selfish!
---
What does or doesn't happen in BfA is completely irrelevant to me.
---
You're saying that tanks aren't going to be able to LoS pull ranged mobs in dungeons? PvPers won't be able to LoS hide to avoid getting hit by casters?
---
You can MT UBRS as a Fury, but you need a good healer. I’ve also MTed ZG arms (but again, probably group dependent).
---
Unfortunately that ship has sailed for me. My vacation request was due last friday.
---
Here is hoping we get an announcement in time for you and everyone else.
---
Majority of the cheaper ones in the USA come with no ssd drive and usually older intel processors too haha... It amazes me, I get that it is unused but shelling out $300-$400 for a laptop that has a Haswell or Broadwell processor in 2019 seems crazy.
---
As a druid I frequently offtank or offheal when relegated to DPS role. Not every pull, but quite a lot of them.
---
Warrior.
---
After waiting so many years, I just want to game to be as great as it can be. If that means we will have to wait a bit longer, I'm fine with that. 
---
I am planning on request vacation on launch, but I am in no rush to get to maxlevel. I will enjoy the game over years, since playing as hard as back then is definitely not possible for me anymore. So if it's not possible to have vacation on launch, it's fine. At least you will not have to worry about mob-tagging or picking up questitems that only spawn every two mintues when you level a bit slower than everyone else :D
---
Fuck man, I'm legit sorry :(
---
The biggest I’d buy from a vendor is 8 slot, but it’s probably a better idea to grind XP on Quillboars in the barrens and have a priest who’s leveling tailoring make you 8-slot bags. 
---
Other classes can get to moonglade; there is just no reason too.  
---
There was a tunnel ( I think ) though timbermaul hold.
---
Baby dont hurt me.
---
For sure the Ancient Petrified Leaf quest. It wont be as easily accessible as a lot of other class quest though. 
---
The thread no, but the comment above us using past tense. Hence I though I could explain the confusion away.
---
&gt; Cat fed.
---
did you buy a few extra litter boxes?
---
Yeah I thought about that. In the end the time you save fighting enemies is spent somewhere else...
---
Unless you intend to last hit the mobs with drain soul or shadowburn with 39 other people in the raid group, then no.
---
Mining is a good second choice but I'm just going to be honest with you here, you're going to make far more gold with herbalism.
---
Arcanite Crystals will be camped heavily, and they're the only real money makers for mining. Lower level ores etc are only relevant for leveling professions.
---
But with herbalism, absolutely every level range of herbs are relevant all the way to the end of server life. Low level potions like Free Action Pots, Swiftness Pots, Lesser Invis Pots take low level herbs but are still relevant and demand good prices.
---
But still, mining will make you some good gold.
---
If your main concern is gold you're still better off going herbalism, but you can always switch professions along the line.
---
It does on private server, that’s all we know. Best way to check would be with a DPS meter and 2 enemies of the same type/level. 
---
I mean, both hunter and druid benefits greatly from GoA so it's not awful, as the shaman would drop it if solo, if they want fun they can use wf weapon but can sit there knowing rockbiter is more effective. 
---
I know what you mean about warrior though, wf and whirlwind axe, oh baby thats a fast few levels
---
They're extremely strong in dungeons. I don't know how much actual experience you have playing Vanilla, but except for UBRS, druids are just as good and in some cases better thanks than warriors, especially depending on the progression of the server.
---
omg no DMT buffs. Slack.
---
&gt;&gt; You have called non minmaxers assholes
---
&gt;Yes, but not for not minmaxing.
---
&gt;&gt; referenced "shit specs,"
---
You call anyone who isn't "respectful" an asshole.
---
Your definition of "respectful" is minmaxing.
---
Distinction without a difference. You're trying to obfuscate your message.
---
&gt;Do you not see the difference between calling a player shit and calling a spec shit?
---
"You're not shit, but your in game decisions are shit." Distinction without a difference. You're calling someone's preferences and gameplay style shit.
---
&gt;&gt; demanded to know how people have fun in sub-optimal specs constantly. How are you not doing this?
---
&gt;Yea, when people use "but it's fun" as an argument for something unethical, it seems pretty reasonable to ask why they find it fun.
---
"Unethical." You're literally calling non minmaxers unethical.
---
&gt;If someone supported murder because it's fun, I'd personally like to know what they find fun about it.
---
Now you're comparing non minmaxing to murder? Holy shit.
---
&gt;&gt; Do you honestly not see a difference in presentation and tact between the two hypothetical responses?
---
&gt;I do see the difference one is a whitelist the other is a blacklist, but I disagree with your interpretation, both are demanding, neither is berating or insulting.
---
If you are unable to distinguish neutral statements, from demands, to insults, then I think that may explain why you are utterly unable to understand how you are the asshole in this scenario. I'm not sure that social queues and presence and be taught, so you may just be doomed to be an insufferable asshole for the remainder of your life.
---
Wrong.
---
DMF = Darkmoon Faire = Sayges fortunes.
---
DMT = Dire Maul Tribute
---
Thanks everyone for the answers!
---
I live in Ireland therefore I’ll have to check if it’s better to buy it through Amazon, Currys or Argos.
---
I’ll let you know!
---
Priest or Druid and I am going full healer mode.
---
Not sure yet - because it seems that priest will be better for pve and druid for pvp.
---
Hard decision.
---
A pittance to charity is vastly more important than time saved based on race selection in vanilla wow. I don't even think they're in the same league.
---
Prioritizing your own preferences at character creation, if you genuinely believe that's being notably selfish, I have no idea how you make decisions in real life regarding things that are actually important. I'm willing to bet you're not this strident about anything else.
---
Can’t you just bid 1dkp on everything?
---
During MC/BWL/AQ you're guild is likely to use more than 1head/1heart per week as you can split your raid groups up, and Ony has a 5 day reset and ZG has a 3 day reset. By the time of Naxx you probably wont be popping your Ony/Nef heads/Hakkar hearts of lower tier raids but only using them for Naxx.
---
Yep, **demand.** Remember that conversation we just had? Demanding someone play a certain way is being an asshole.
---
Same but can’t keep my attention for long, it’s all wrong lol
---
Paladin. Can heal as you like and gets a "free" mount so you dont have to grind gold for it.
---
Druids are my second most favorite class, and they'd probably be my number one if I hadn't fallen in with a wonderful set of people to raid on my warlock with.
---
However. It's a chore to level a druid the first 10 levels. You feel like you're bad at pretty much everything. Can't wear decent armor. Runs out of mana every 10 seconds. Can't do anything "special" like warriors' charge or rogues' stealth. You're a leather-wearing gimp with a large stick.
---
And then you get to level 10 and learn to transform! Suddenly you're not so puny any more. You can take on tough mobs and actually not die. You escape snares. You're a shape-shifting badass.
---
Then comes level 16. Now you can swim faster than anyone, and you can breathe underwater. Sweet!
---
And then comes level 20, and you're the baddest ass around. Rogue, Warrior, and Priest, all rolled into one. You're always welcome in instance groups, you can solo pretty much everything, and don't have to run away if you pull a few extra adds while you're killing some mob for a quest. Just hop into bear form and take it slow.
---
..and just to top the awesome-cake with an extra special cherry, you even get to pick Moonkin if you feel like it when you hit level 50.
---
This is a stupid argument. I'd rather play 3 AB's in an hour, than play one and wait for 40 minutes. 
---
"/1 lf tank for brd ironfoe is yours if it drops"
---
Forty minutes pass.
---
"idk i've tried all my friends list, let's start spamming warriors druids and paladins"
---
Warlock
---
-Free mount
---
-If you aren't raiding or doing anything hardcore you don't need many soulshards, one for pet and one for healthstones
---
-Free pet at level 2
---
-Free tanking pet at level 10
---
-Pets don't require ANY maintenance aside from training at an NPC
---
-Healthstones for your group
---
-Soulstones for your group
---
-Summoning for your group
---
-Voidwalker is OP for soloing
---
-Great self healing and pet healing
---
-Literally can never run oom with spirit tap + healthdrain
---
yeah, a troll paladin come up from every corner
---
There was a point where Heart buff actually persisted through death if I recall correct but it was changed around AQ release.
---
This is legit the first game in my life I’m planning on taking time off for work for at release. Give us a date!
---
What made you stop loving Druid?  That's definitely the class for you!
---
Now tell us dishonestly.
---
I remember the dragonslayer cooldown, as long as a head was still standing in org you wouldn't get the buff if you turned in another.  I'm not sure there was a cooldown on the ZG buff though.  My server only had 1 horde raiding guild still active at the end of naxx, but two alliance and I don't think we ever ran into a situation where we couldn't  get the ZG buff.  Been so long though, who knows. 
---
&gt;Schedule
---
No more.
---
Cat diapers.
---
As horde the process is as follows:
---
1. Get Dire Maul Tribute buffs. -&gt; portal back to Orgrimmar.
---
2. Run to Zep -&gt; Grom'gol, Run/Swim to Zandalar island. Get potion Spirit of Zanza and have someone hand in their Hakkar heart and get Spirit of the Zandalari buff. -&gt; Port back to Orgrimmar.
---
3. Fly to Felwood and Grab songflower buff. -&gt; Port back to Orgrimmar.
---
4. Have someone hand in their Onyxia/Nefarian head for Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer buff and have another person hand in their Head of Rend to Thrall to get Warchiefs Blessing. -&gt; Portal to Thunderbluff.
---
5. Get Darkmoon faire buff Sayges fortune. Hearthstone to Kargath, Cenarion Hold or EPL and start raiding.
---
EDIT: Bonus. Get the 10% stats buffs from killing Omen in Moonglade during Lunar festival.
---
Too bad they're not real oil paintings.  I'd probably buy some.
---
Just a warning; if you plan on raid tanking as a druid be preparerad to invest a lot of time if you want to be viable and actually contribute something over a warrior.  
---
You need a lot of consumables, both for tanking and cat dps including grinding pummelers.
---
You need a DPS set, at TPS set, a mitigation set, resistance sets and preferably also a INT set. (TPS and mitigation set are quite simular AQ+)
---
You need 260 enchanting, devilsaur set and warden staff (atleast pre-DM). Can be quite costly  
---
Some prebis pices like shoulders and gloves requires a lot of grinding since they have both low drop chance and diffrent versions (xxxx - of stamina, xxxx - of the monkey)  
---
You need WSG and AB exalted items eventually
---
For cat dps you have a lot of competition with rogues, huntards and even warriors for gear.  
---
Some possitives are that most of the gear for bear tank are useless for other classes so not much compitition. Also a few pices are easy to obtain with rank 5 in PvP  
---
It's totaly doable but it is a long grind in the begining, but after you have the basic sets only getting consumables is a chore. It's also totaly worth it, i dont think there is any other expantion any class can tank, dps and heal/decurse/depoision in one raid, sometimes even in a single fight.  
---
How are they fuckesd?
---
No worries. I might still be able to finagle a day or two. If it happens after August I can just put in vacation then.  Worst case scenario I have 3 personal days. Hopefully Blizzard communicates with us soon though :)
---
This is the first game of my life that I’m missing work. I’ve been addicted to video games forever, yet this will be the first that I’m willing to miss work for 
---
Dude, that game is utter crap. Huge letdown in all honesty. I plan on playing War Craft 3 again to get to grips with the story once more. 
---
This is kinda my reasoning for going PvE also. 
---
But I will still miss the PvP aspect. I wish there could be a middleground, that encouraged at-level-pvp,  and discouraged or straight up stopped griefing.
---
This is the biggest unintentional strawman response I've seen.  None of this has to do with gear OR spec.
---
&gt;I've done 2 Maraudon runs with my current character. First time it was really not fun because the hunter couldn't manage his pet and was taunting and stealing adds, priest was constantly hotting and shielding me thus I was rage-starved and we waited for half a min after each pull.
---
Any hunter has a pet.  This is not dictated by spec, and requires you teaching them correct group play.  I know it's hard to believe but PLENTY of people don't ever micro their pets; so that Growl on that bear?  Yup, it's on autocast.  TEACH THE HUNTER TO TOGGLE AUTO-GROWL OFF IN GROUPS.
---
As for the priest, plenty of priests...MYSELF included...back in vanilla through "pre-HoT/pre-shield" was the safest way to begin pulls.  They were not aware that the shield would make you rage starved or the heal would snap aggro to you.  TEACH THE PRIEST NOT TO PRE-HOT OR PRE-SHIELD WARRIORS.
---
&gt;After 2 hours of torture, I left, halfway through. I did not enjoy the experience and I was only keeping up for 2 hours because I was in a party and didnt want to be the asshole quitter.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Second time we've done the whole place in 1,5 hour. We had time to joke around while killing stuff. It was a smooth run. I wasn't rage starved, the mages only used nova when needed and the hunter managed his pet well. There was one lousy lock but it was okay, it was his first char and was learning quick. (After each mistake we wrote it down and he avoided it in the future)  
---
&gt;Being a good player means pushing the right buttons (like in this scenario) but also choosing the useful items and specs.
---
Again, your first group had NOTHING to do with items or spec.  The problems were character usage in a group scenario.  For a hunter who rarely groups,  keeping your pet taunting while you solo grind is a GOOD thing.  Not so much for grouping.  For a priest who rarely groups, pre-HoTing and pre-shielding yourself improves your ability to live through difficult pulls while solo grinding.  Not so much for a warrior tank in your group.
---
&gt;If I play with good players, I enjoy the game more. If I play with bad players, I don't. Now I understand people aren't born pr0s (and I'm not one myself) but if you refuse to improve yourself you are ruining my experience.
---
Yes, you're experience was lessoned, and as a result you got frustrated.  In this situation you have a few options:
---
1) Silently detest the n00bs and suffer through half a dungeon without saying anything?
---
2) Lash out like an ElitistJerk^(TM) and tell them that they are playing completely incorrectly and that their exact rotation at level 42 should be Aimed Shot&gt;Arcane Shot&gt;Serpent Sting? And that they should be running X/X/X spec with XYZ gear, and should really be using ABC weapon from &lt;X&gt; quest that is super easy to get, and the fact that they don't have it means that they are legally retarded?
---
3) Ask the hunter to stop pulling, and to turn off his pet's growl.  And then ask the priest to not pre-shield/pre-hot you?
---
Which one seems like the best option to you?
---
&gt;I'd rather have a good all-around druid who is feral/resto and switching between forms than one that stays in chicken and auto-attacks the mob after he is oom, even if the latter enjoys what he is doing.
---
The only time a feral/resto hybrid should switch forms in a dungeon is if:
---
A) A boss or boss-type mob is casting a spell that will kill a member.  Since feral spends most of their time in Cat Form, the only time a feral/resto druid will switch into bear is to use bash/Charge to interrupt a cast of some sort that would otherwise kill/wipe the party.  
---
B) The tank has already died for some reason.  The druid will shift from cat form into bear form to play as "emergency tank" to help prevent a group wipe.
---
C) The healer has already died for some reason.  The druid will take over healing responsibilities or will battle-rez the healer and help keep the group topped off until the healer can take over again. (See also: Healer is in long term crowd control like sleep or polymorph)
---
&gt;If the pally refuses to wear cloth and has shitty spirit and int and spell power because of it, I have to afk after each pull. If he works his ass off and gets okayish plate, then we don't have to wait a lot (or at all, if he is good player) so at that point I don't care. Because it does not affect me. But when it does affect me, I care.
---
Actually paladin's staying power in healing comes from Illumination procs.  So unless you're below level 30 (read: no dungeon is that hard below level 30); you will be fine if the paladin doesn't have a ton of spirit.  In fact, if I recall: paladin's want more INT than spirit since they will be spamming flash heals for the chance to crit and thus be "free" heals and they don't have any "regen mana while in-combat" talents other than Blessing of Wisdom, which is of course a spell and not a talent.
---
Literally, everything you listed as a problem was not a problem of specs or gear.
---
Short answer, we don’t know yet. Other than the lack of DM drops, I’d plan on some of your pre-BIS blues being greens with poor stats, and grabbing a few items from dungeons as early as Uldaman. 
---
I don't know how it is in other countries, but you can't find a laptop (even cheaper ones) in Sweden that doesn't have an SSD right now.
---
No, I'm saying (some) of the LoS exploits outlined in the article won't work. The ones where you stick the boss in an awkward corner so that you can DPS him without having your DPS in the LoS of the boss mechanics. 
---
&gt; Demanding is not requesting and it's not declining.
---
If that's what you believe, then maybe you should take a second to open a dictionary.
---
If you’re a tank, you need 315 FR for some fights in MC, but the UBRS buff is like 75 FR, so it’s not terribly hard to get. 
---
Right? At first I’m like “oh this is r/Pittsburgh”.... waaaaait a minute!  (Now former Pittsburgher, but you know it’s gonna drive me crazy trying to work out where this is!)
---
My first car (also when I lived in Pittsburgh) was a 2 door 2001 cavalier red with the horde decal on the back window. Never had the cash or desire to fork over the cash for a vanity plate. 
---
I would suggest either paladin, druid or shaman.  Hybrid specs are fun and heal just fine with a healing set of gear.  If you love healing and grouping they bring a good versatility.  A bonus to hybrid spec is you don't have to heal all the time.  If a friend or guildie invites you along and they want to heal you can just put on another set of gear and have fun.
---
What makes blacksmithing go to Orc over Dwarves?
---
Blinking twice is also vastly more effort than selecting a different race in an mmo.
---
&gt; I have no idea how you make decisions in real life regarding things that are actually important. 
---
See, that's exactly it, in real life, decisions actually matter and have multiple vectors to weigh from, what race or spec you play your character only matters in one vector, so why not optimize for that?
---
Congratz Sir! Even though you're an internet WoWClassoc stranger, I'm truly happy for you for the blessing of your Child
---
The best class for a casual player is the one you like the most, nothing more and nothing less. As a casual player, you only play for fun. So try out all classes and see what you like :)
---
I was the same. This time I'm going it alone. I tried a Pserver to remind myself how things were and was pleasantly surprised. I have no doubt that when the real game comes, I will make lots of new friends.
---
&gt; Your definition of "respectful" is minmaxing.
---
No, my definition of respectful is, in this context, not assuming others will carry you.
---
&gt; Distinction without a difference. You're calling someone's preferences and gameplay style shit.
---
There's a major difference between calling someone shit and calling their spec shit, calling them shit implies there's something wrong with them, calling their spec shit implies the spec isn't for you.
---
&gt; Now you're comparing non minmaxing to murder? Holy shit.
---
[It's called hyperbole big guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUt7UYUMynw)
---
&gt; If you are unable to distinguish neutral statements,
---
And I think maybe if you take "I don't like your spec" as an insult, then maybe you have a pretty damn thin skin.
---
&gt; so you may just be doomed to be an insufferable asshole for the remainder of your life.
---
And now you just called minmaxers insufferable assholes, pot meet kettle.
---
Classic is based off of the Legion client, not the BfA client.
---
You should absolutely use a staff if it's the best weapon you've got.  Int and Spirit are still useful and the slow weapon speed is good for Warriors.  Also, think of the PvP style points.
---
In TBC twink Warriors used staves, I know from experience.
---
&gt; Being a good player means pushing the right buttons (like in this scenario) but also choosing the useful items and specs.
---
COrrect
---
I've mained warlock (Classic/TBC) and later tank warrior (TBC), high five.
---
Both are fun classes. Tanking was a real challenge though, specifically threat management. 
---
I'm gonna play lock again because I don't have the time to get a warrior properly geared.
---
As a druid, I did not know this.
---
What part?
---
Gosh, I wish I could no life the shit outta classic. My life is so different now. I’ll be taking my time, but I will be jealous of all you hard core players.
---
Spirit is literally the only class it works for, and partly because cast time does not count, so you could mp5 tick spirit with long GHeal casts.
---
It did for a few months. 
---
Now I have Satisfactory to play, and soon Anno 1800. 
---
Should keep me busy till at least June. 
---
It depends on the class. A lot of people say 30, but some classes can't be judged by then. There will be some outliners, like warriors. As fury and arms you get your main ability as the last talent in their respective trees. Furthermore you get Whirlwind at level 36. This means your two most damaging abilities are not available at level 30 and instead you spam Heroic Strike, which is just a rage dumb at level 60. 
---
So it really depends on the class. Overall, to me the below list is approximately how I'd go about judging a class,
---
* Warrior: level 40 (for Mortal Strike / Bloodlust, Whirlwind at 36)
---
* Warlock: level 30 (for generally feeling fleshed out)
---
* Shaman: level 32 (for Chain Lighting,  Windfury at 30)
---
* Rogue: level 26 OR 30 (for Cheap Shot and generally full rotation. Kidney Shot for full stunlock at 30)
---
* Priest: level 30 (for generally feeling fleshed out)
---
* Paladin: level 20 (generally if you don't like them by then it won't change much. You won't get more to the rotation. Keep in mind Divine Shield at 34 and Hammer of Wrath at 44)
---
* Mage: level 29 (you have most spells by now and at 29 you got Shatter at frost)
---
* Hunter: level 30 (for Feign Death allowing for "in combat" traps. I'd advice to try out MM since the most fun dps aspect of a hunter is using Aimed Shot, which you get with 11 points in MM, so earliest at level 20)
---
* Druid: level 26 OR 32 (at 26 you generally have most core spells for Balance and Resto while having Cat Form with Dash and Tiger's Fury. At 32 you are a little bit more fleshed out and got Ravage and Ferocious Bite, making feral more fun)
---
As a last note, this is just to know whether you generally like the class. Some classes might not be fun to your before you have the full level 60 talents available (for example druids in PvP are often played as a hybrid of all 3 specs. This is quite special and might feel underwhelming and boring at level 32 without proper stats or talents, but at 60 with full talents and some gear to make it work it can be really fun).
---
Great idea, but is not a troll restro shaman the most mini-max? Thinking about Berserking (that give haste)
---
I’ve leveled several warriors 1-60, and you can’t ever count on mining to provide money for your mount. At a certain point, the only way to skill up mining is to run around Ashenvale looking for silver deposits. I normally wait to do this until AFTER I have my mount. So, don’t count on it to help you buy your mount. 
---
Soooo many DK tanks, because... WotLK.  80% were horrible.  
---
I mained a healer, and during WotLK, I used to log off and go play my hunter because of the nonstop requests to get me to heal.   
---
Speaking minmax terms, yeah warriors can be better. Much higher skill cap though, so those warriors are far and few in between. Druids can swipe their life away, and still generate just enough threat. There's a better chance of a druid tank being more competent than a warrior tank.
---
Great note in the guide about usage of viable and optimal
---
&gt;"The topic of Viable and Optimal is a highly controversial topic as some people simply don't see the difference or mixed these words up and commonly interject their own misguided philosophy onto it. To put it simply, Optimal is the most efficient and foolproof solution to solve a problem that eliminates as many negative variables as possible and favors a more easy going route. Next, is Viable or commonly referred to as possible, which is often seen as the more challenging path to take but to many feels like a greater personal achievement. "
---
I want to look forward to the FF7 remake......but I seriously doubt its going to feel the same, especially with it being live action fights rather than turn based. If it was turn based then I'd be excited. I think I just have doubts they will make it work.
---
Request: an act of asking politely or formally for something
---
&gt; Can you play resto for this? We need as much pure DPS as possible and we could use a healer
---
Demand: an insistent and peremptory request, made as if by right.
---
&gt; Play resto or you're not playing with me
---
Decline: politely refuse (an invitation or offer).
---
&gt; Sorry man we need pure DPS for this 
---
Valid points, as a hardcore player and raider in Classic/TBC both Warlock and Warrior tank I get your point.
---
&gt; Not only on your end, but it’s very very rare that someone will join when the dungeon is almost cleared.
---
Vanilla had no lock-outs IIRC? From what I remember I loved entering for the last boss, easy loot (if lucky) and if you got a summon it was very worth it.
---
Why is this a click bait?
---
I'll be getting candles as well, most importantly I'm getting some banging headphones. Looking to drop about 400 I think.
---
I rather wanted to make a point that dedication and class roster in a raid has a bigger contribution than the proper race.
---
Furthermoret here are simply no hardcore guilds such as method on pservers or will be on WoW classic, because it simply is not necessary and world firsts are already done.
---
Guilds such as Dreamstate who were #1 in raiding for a very long time had tauren fury warriors, because they knew that they will never get people who raid 16hours a day 6days a week.
---
99,9% of hardcore guilds know that turnover may be high and therefore they will take subpar races playing optimal classes.
---
Also content is far too easy in the beginning to give a shit for melees. Nobody will stroke their ego for world firsting MC or BWL and by the time you start to actually wipe and need to progress 3 times a week in raids like AQ40 warriors dont even need weapon kill anymore, because 90% of their attacks are yellow.
---
Min/maxers figured it out that by the time you need to min/max, these min/max theories often do not apply anymore in vanilla WoW.
---
Because a lot of people enjoy the game far more if they pick a race based on aesthetics rather than gameplay optimization. I hate playing gnome mages for example, I just don't like being that short. According to you, by picking human I'm being unethical and that seems absurd to me. 
---
Definitionally, on some level I'm being selfish, but then prioritizing your own happiness is selfish no matter what you're doing. My point is, if you're willing to say that something as small as not considering maximal group efficiency in a decade old game is notably selfish, I'm not sure how you aren't a complete doormat when there are actually things at stake. 
---
And one of those classes basically had 3 viable tanking specs that played only slightly differently than corresponding DPS specs.
---
RIP Frost DK 5man tanking :( Most fun I had in WoW since... well, vanilla.
---
I am taking 2-4 months off, and plan on multi boxing 10 characters to 60 in 2 groups.
---
Pally warrior mage mage mage and mage mage mage mage warlock
---
Before launch I will have meal prepped for 3-4 weeks in advance, and will be paying someone to do housework so it doesn’t fall behind.
---
Meal prep is important, because maintaining a healthy diet is a key factor in avoiding crashing when playing 18ish hours a day for long periods of time.
---
Paladin and shaman are pure mp5 classes when it comes to regen, druid however can use it same way as priest but to lesser extent (Htouch). 
---
Gheal rank one when timed right is best example for priest abusing 5s rule. Know when to cancel or let it through to min-max regen from spirit. 
---
Not true for MMOs, there CPU is more important usually. But doesn't matter, WoW doesn't need resources, neither does the 1.12 or legion or bfa client, so likely the classic client won't need it either.
---
&gt;  I’ll still go to the gym, do chores, and cut my lawn though.
---
Let's see how long that lasts :P
---
Druids were the shittiest class in Vanilla, can't wait for Retailers to roll them thinking they are Godlike. OMEGALUL
---
&gt; hunter probably
---
there are piles of Hunters, easy to level, desent in PVE and PVP.
---
This, and I have a feeling it will be a touch of amazing.  One of the best memories of WoW I have is a full clear of BRD with a group who had no clue and just went everywhere.
---
Druid is the only class that can heal while also being great at doing content solo without having to respect (if you use the 0/30/21 Heart of the Wild build). Priests, paladins and shamans have it much harder. Shaman can dish out great damage if specced 30/0/21, but the sustain is not very good, meaning that it's mostly relevant in PvP. Similarly, a paladin can spec 20/0/31 or 21/0/30 to get some neat retribution power while being a healer, but playing paladin can get very dull (not much gimmicky stuff aside from Reckoning).
---
Will roll the first character I ever made in WoW or perhaps Everquest. For WoW it was a NE hunter. In EQ it was a dwarf warrior. 
---
Does 5 shamans count? Because we did all the way through Gnomeregan with 5 shamans in Vanilla until it got toooo time consuming haha.
---
The reason you don’t want to shield a tank is because it stops then from generating rage. That means he can’t hold threat as well. However, if it stops a death, use that shield 100% of the time. 
---
That sounds more like an issue of underpopulation though, which with today's tech Blizzard should easily be able to solve by merging multiple servers down the line.
---
Not sure what to do about overpopulated servers with faction imbalances (e.g. big streamer servers), I'd say tough luck and faction specific character server transfers.
---
This is how it works for horde. Usually you clear Dire Maul Tribute about an hour and a half before raid start time and keep a team of summoners and mage there to bring the raid (little by little) for buffs followed by ports to Orgrimmar. Players, individually or in small groups, make their way to ZG island and LOG OUT to save buffs. 10 min before raid (add extra 5 for DMF in TB) all players log in and a ZG heart is turned in. All players take a portal to TB if DMF is up or otherwise take a portal to Org for one or both dragon heads. All players hearth to Kargath for MC/BWL raiding. Songflower buffs are an individual responsibilitity but the raid team will prioritize summons for these players wherever to reduce buff time lost in transit.  
---
Just wait till they get to experience the joys of plate armor repairs pre-rep discounts and gold inflation while trying to save for their 1000g mount.
---
I salute you 
---
Paladin
---
Its not comparable. Ive leveled a couple of warriors lately and i can definitely recommend using staves (ones i frequently use are the ones that drop in WC and BFD).
---
On the contrary. I'm currently deployed in the middle east, and I will be returning stateside sometime around the middle of July.
---
I can **PROMISE YOU** that Classic will release early July, and I will miss the first few weeks because of this.
---
Interesting how you should choose the definition of request that fits your idea of what's going on, when the next definition says
---
&gt; a thing that is asked for.
---
Which would also make it not oxymoronic with your definition of Demand.
---
But then again, if you had chosen that definition of request, it would be pretty obvious that both are requests and both are demands.
---
&gt;And now you just called minmaxers insufferable assholes, pot meet kettle.
---
Nope, just you.
---
July 28th.
---
... because that's when I got my annual summer vacation.
---
Things like people waiting for boats, and pvp outside of raid instances were the things that made WoW actually WoW and not some shitty quick-lobby bad knockoff.
---
Troll Shamans = Witch Doctors!
---
In vanilla, totems affect only your party, not the whole raid. This means that Horde raids try to get one shaman in every single group, so it's pretty much garanteed you'll be sought after for raids if you are resto at 60 and know what you are doing. Also, for PvE healing, troll is the most optimal choice, which is also my favorite horde race, so it all fit together.
---
But the problem is that I hear in vanilla they really a lot on sp pots (I've maybe resto shaman only in WotLK), and you are also stuck wearing lame dresses, as are paladins. Some people complain about totem management, but with add-ons it's probably not so bad. You have to place one at a time, but that's not the end of the world, except harder things like timing tremor totem in certain bosses. Overall the healing experience seems pretty simple, where you spam chain heal, making you arguably the best AoE healer in vanilla.
---
Overall resto shaman seems to be a very sought after spec on endgame, essential for horde raids and not a nightmare to play/level. Certainly better healers than druids, at least.
---
All that said and done, the wilds call me once more...
---
I’ve leveled both a Warrior and a priest. When I tank, I’ll click off HoTs before I pull. But, when leveling or in 5-mans I’ll drop a renew on the tank because it buys me an extra second or two to get a heal off. Is it efficient? No. But, if it keeps the tank alive, I’m doing my job. 
---
Have you logged into retail recently? Classic isn’t going to be super bro club where all the old heads hang out. It’s going to have the same community as retail, and the same customer support.
---
Ok. Changes nothing.
---
Request: a thing that is asked for
---
&gt; Can you play resto for this? 
---
&gt;Play resto or you're not playing with me
---
&gt; Sorry man, not today, we need pure DPS for this 
---
so the shards are farmed on the trash elites then
---
Once you get a ton of +healing, renew is less valuable because of its low coefficient, but generally this stands true. 
---
Oh I still love it from vanilla to wotlk. After cata, want a fan of the class
---
&gt;They do exist!
---
Honestly, only the hardcore guilds should have a reason to exclude people for not having a full schedule dedicated to WoW. I'd say there are 3 types of guilds: The Hardcore, the casual and the casual that thinks they are hardcore and pro. The last one you probably don't want to be part of.
---
Are you suggesting an event must last a certain amount of time for it to be fun?  
---
For example sex with me lasts about 35 seconds and I have a great time. Usually followed by hours of crying and calling my ex girlfriends and talking about what our life could have been, but that's not the point. 
---
So, when I call a subset of people who don't minmax assholes, you somehow need to repeatedly slander me by saying I'm calling all of them assholes.
---
But when you call a subset of minmaxers assholes suddently the distinction between super- and subset become very important?
---
Wasn't it you who called me a hypocrite earlier as well? Again, pot meet kettle.
---
For me it's [Exploration the movie](https://youtu.be/UWMz7-7SGlo?t=176) him walking towards the blue dark portal and "Airwave - When things go wrong" playing. 
---
A bit unrelated but I thought it was pretty neat: Last friday on the way back home from work I was flipping chans looking for some music on the radio and, to my surprise, the classical channel was playing some WoW music! They played all main cities songs back to back. Turns out, each friday they play game soundtracks and it just happened to be WoW day. Hit me straight in the nostalgia feels.. Can't wait to jump back into it
---
Hey mom, I'm famous!
---
My comment is the first one. Point still 100% stands. If you're knowingly playing really sub-optimally but *still* expect people to invite you to their group content, you're an asshole.
---
This is too true.  It would absolutely suck to have to do that, and it would no doubt alter the servers community.  But I think it’s the better of two evils. 
---
Also definitely a classic one! 
---
When we had pre-raid BIS, I 2 manned BRD with a Prot Warrior and Ench Shaman. We only killed one boss because we were clearing to the dark forge to make Nightfall for the Shaman, but it was actually really fun. 
---
But that was so they could sell an unfinished product. Classic breaks the mold in that it's not Activision approved cancer. 
---
Yes, but I’m perfectly fine with that.  
---
You're calling anyone who doesn't minmax an asshole.
---
I'm calling you, specifically, an asshole. 
---
Okay that's what I was thinking I thought there was an npc's that had a longer lasting duration but I was wrong. Ty! 
---
The tones *are* indeed very different, but it still changes everything, because all of a sudden. saying "Hey man, I'm sorry, I really need a rogue, unfortunately a feral wont cut it", as that is a demand, and as such it's what the poster was complaining about minmaxers doing.
---
Uhh was this on a vanilla server/client?  I saw the sparkly effect on ground collectibles and I thought that only came after TBC.
---
Save my user name 
---
If you roll alliance on a PvP server, find me before you get back. I have no life so I’ll be leveled up with some gold and will drop you a welcome home package of some gold and leveling gear and shit 
---
My one concern is that a lot of Druid tank gear was added in DM:E. So you might be slightly less efficient. 
---
There are a select few staves that are very good for warriors.
---
Crescent staff from Wailing Caverns will be worn by 99% of warriors, because you do WC at level 18-20 and the staff does 20+DPS. 
---
It just comes down to what does the most DPS. Swing speed only becomes important at level 36, when warriors get their instant attack (whirlwind).
---
Later on you may have bad drop luck and go with [https://classicdb.ch/?item=17743](https://classicdb.ch/?item=17743) (Resurgence Rod). 
---
I did Uldaman for Stoneslayer/Rockpounder, both didnt drop, I did not have the funds for Executioners Cleavers, so I just did Maraudon as level 46, the axe and mace did not drop, so got myself the rod. Specced into 5% 2h damage and did just fine in BGs. 
---
Some people found it funny, but I was always right in the faces of the alliance smashing them to pieces.
---
Bonus: when you crit people with a staff, it makes a wooden "clonk". Really funny!
---
How would that make the n-word tolerable? 
---
Toss up between Mage and Hunter. But I think Mage edges out as a more desirable class overall. Hunter can be fun in raids tho. 
---
You might meet a GIRL?
---
&gt; you're calling anyone who doesn't minmax an asshole.
---
4th? time now you're inventing things in your head to make me seem like a bad guy, I haven't kept super close track, but it's at least that.
---
“We hinted at July 16...so we will now announce...WoW mobile to be released on the 16th a week before launch!!!!!
---
You have phones dont you??” 
---
I don’t think it was blessing that did it...
---
You don't need to last hit with drain soul to get a shard
---
Got a feeling people will complain about more maps post.. but honestly I like it - something different than the same topics being discussed every week. 
---
"Best class?, min-maxing hate or love, I'm gonna play [insert unconventional spec], do you guys also spend a lot of time on reddit?, Hey look at my old vanilla box."
---
I'm in the same boat. 
---
Nope. Demanding would be telling them to reroll a Rogue if they want to do DPS, or telling them to spec resto if they want to find a group. It would be telling them how to play the game. In your scenario, the response did not tell the player how to play the game. 
---
If you're casual then the only thing that matters is what you think will be the most fun, what fits you best. 
---
It's a full clear of lbrs, 3 ubrs runs, and killing 4 elite world dragons. At least on the horde-side.
---
You fight mobs that are one level above being grey, therefore you still have a very high chance of hitting and spam away hamstring for 10rage. You do that for 15minutes and your weapon skill is high enough that you can commence questing normally.
---
You need to deal a "killing blow", and since you will likely have no dots, or at least corruption, up. It will be that much harder to reliably do.
---
Haha will do man. We haven't decided if we are going Alliance or Horde yet, but I'm 100% going to play on a PvP server. Appreciate the gesture, either way. 
---
When leveling my Shadow priest, even if I was healing, I’d get the killing blow with mind blast. Basically never had to drink. 
---
IIRC 20 man was not impossible.  
---
looking for semi hardcore  NA-PVP east coast guild on alliance side, preferably using LC. raid times looking for 7-8pm EST starts on weekdays. will be playing dwarf priest healer and have extensive experience on multiple private servers. pm me!
---
July 16th is the meme guess
---
What's up with video gamers and Ford Fusions?
---
&gt; If I decline to invite a Warlock because we already have a Warlock, that isn't demanding anything of the second Warlock.
---
You're demanding he's not a warlock if he wants to get in the group.
---
Im almost certain i wont be raiding all that seriously, but even with that (combined with the fact that i wanted to be a dwarf) ive decided to go priest instead.  
---
Lack of soulwell is just a killer for me.  I dont really feel like being a healthstone bitch.
---
No, im not asking for a change.  Im just saying with the way it is i dont really feel like going through the hassle.
---
Thrall is no peasant
---
That's an incredible stretch of logic. Not biting. Sorry. Good luck convincing others of this, I'm done.
---
I hear ya, I meal prep before the week to give me some time and stay healthy. Might help you!
---
I understand that.  But you were blaming the people in your scenario on gear and spec, when the problems had nothing to do with gear or spec.
---
To further exacerbate this: gear and spec only become problems in dungeon/group content if your group (whether it's 5 man or 40 man) is getting bosses down to 5% or less but wiping continually.  Then, gear/spec .
---
And you can go down that rabbit hole even further.  
---
"Is our tank dying too often?"  --&gt; The tank or healer may not be specced or geared properly.
---
"Are we hitting enrage timers/phases too much?" --&gt;DPS may not be specced or geared properly.
---
Beyond that, a kill is a kill.  As long as your group is clearing content, it shouldn't matter if someone isn't wearing that cloth chest with +10 stam and +2 int instead of their more fashionable plate chest. 
---
Thanks for the link. Good video.
---
This is the Warlock version of Bloodrage + Bandage. 
---
might aswell when playing casual (:
---
Don’t you guys have phones?
---
This is me too.
---
From what I can remember there were no paid character transfers. I've no idea how they should tackle this problem.
---
Aww, finally met someone that didn't bend a knee to your insults and slander?
---
I really doubt there will be too many pallies and shamans.. ?
---
i'm coming up with 84.33 repeating of course
---
Oh hells yeah! Glyphed howling blast right? Hands down my favourite tanking spec.
---
This is exactly what we did, people learned pretty quickly to not fuck around with BS bids... :)
---
You can stagger raid instance IDs such that they would expire in a way that allowed you to run the instance every day on the same character.
---
The Raid ID system was moved to a weekly static reset time (Tue Downtime) afterwards.
---
Is he going to be making the groups, or whining when people don't add him to their groups because it makes the content harder? It's a big difference.
---
If it's the former, I really need to ask how it's any different or less elitist for people to turn me away from group content for playing my agi-only boomkin.
---
20 situps for every chuck norris joke, does sound time consuming
---
Warrior is definitively the slowest/hardest class to level. Usually a lot of players roll one at the start and quickly switch to an easier class. By the time you hit 60 warriors are very very high in demand.
---
I forgot to add in summoning to that, Sargeras help you if you're in a guild of people who always expect a summon. 
---
Thank you ! We already love her and i can't wait to teach her the important things... like avoiding alliance guys at all cost ! Lok'Tar Ogar ! 
---
They need to take a page from the Apex Legends playbook and just release it suddenly. Creates massive instant hype and people will also impulse try it out. I mean imagine if after nexts weeks maintenance Classic was all of a sudden live? 
---
I remember the quests for Doomguard and Infernal being quite fun. 
---
This is actually the secret to being a gamer and getting laid. Don’t apologize for your cool hobbies you nerd.
---
I remember one Warrior I leveled, I wasn’t able to complete the Berserker Stance quest until level 37. I actually ran out of time and the mobs despawned on one attempt. 
---
Meh. All I see are crutches for noobs. I’ll pass. 
---
They were clunky as hell to use. It felt more like a chore to put them down than it being useful. The quests to get the totems were also a HUGE pain in the ass.
---
I always play some Travian. A real-time MMO strategy, where, you know, you send troops and wait 20 minutes until they arrive, etc.
---
I always use the downtime for exercises. Works quite well.
---
I'd cry. There. I said it. I'm not ashamed!
---
Really? There’s a bunch of rare crafting recipes in Moonglade and the rest of us have to death run in order to get them. 
---
No you dont. And shadowburn costs a shard so you can never use that to gain shards.
---
I will play and because I don't like to dabble around  in-game I will most likely be gaming with a more hardcore guild that gets shit done &amp; progresses quickly. Hopefully this doesn't interfere with my life too much, but if it does then I have the option of backing off the time commitment somewhat - I have been part of the Blizzlike pserver community since 2014, and retail for several expansions before that, so it's not a big deal if I wind up missing out on AQ40 &amp; Naxx progression.
---
"Hey &lt;%PCName&gt;, you should go see Tabetha! She has a nice level 30 quest with great gear!"
---
"Sounds good, where is she?"
---
"In the middle of nowhere, surrounded by level 40 elites."
---
"..."
---
"Have fun!"
---
(In all seriousness though, this is such a rite of passage that I end up doing the quest every time. It's an ordeal, but the wand is just *so good*.)
---
Then enjoy retail since that is the game for you. Classic wow will require waiting in many ways for many things. 
---
You think you do, but you don't. 
---
I’m looking for a similar option here, in the UK. I think used is the way to go but I went trawling for a post like this one (before making my own) to see just what specs I would need to aim for when searching.
---
Some of the prices and suggested specs look a bit much for what I want the laptop to do though, which is to run a decade old game at half decent resolution/fps. Surely it’s not that demanding?
---
This was my experience as well. In AV and AB, Shamans and priests will purge/dispell the shit out of you and everyone else will destroy you as you run away.  
---
WSG is different because you're not really depending on HoTs on yourself as much as others (like paladins) are keeping you alive, and WSG can be a huge blast. Flag carrying is great but eventually YOU WILL burn out on WSG doing the honor grind if that's your thing.
---
1v1, you're amazing at running away as resto but that's about all you can do...which might be completely fine if you want to raid heal and gather herbs. If you're looking to heal 5 mans, it can be rough unless the group REALLY needs a healer and can't find anyone else. Otherwise "LF1M heals" with a reply from a druid vs a paladin, priest, or shaman...you're not getting the spot.
---
I feel like I want to play classic now.
---
But, about gaming, I feel more like watching some youtube videos about classic, than playing other games. So, true.
---
On the other hand, WOW Classic is the first game that kept me persistently hyped for 5 moths so far. With other games I was waiting for, the hype diminished after a few days, and then returned after months. With WOW, it's constant.
---
Most raiders maintain at least 1 farming alt, so that won't be a big deal. The drawback is that Songflower only lasts for 1 hour, so it will take some planning &amp; time management to make it worthwhile...it's depressing to get a world buff &amp; then zone into the raid instance with less than 30 minutes remaining.
---
Ahh I see. Yea doubt we'll see that this summer.
---
I know perfectly well what classic is, and though some concerns from CRBG is valid, "but waiting was fun" was not one of them. 
---
&gt;To further exacerbate this: gear and spec only become problems in dungeon/group content if your group (whether it's 5 man or 40 man) is getting bosses down to 5% or less but wiping continually. Then, gear/spec .
---
That is not true.
---
Let's say you want to clear Uldaman for the quests and the loot. You want to allocate enough time for that, but also leave room for other activites. How much time do you allocate? 2hours?
---
With a good group you can clear it in an hour and a half. With a bad group it might take 3 or more. At some point it will stop being fun or you might actually have to leave. At that point, progression-wise you've wasted 2+ hours for nothing and you didn't actually enjoy it, so you really didn't get anything out of it.
---
I'm not saying I'm kicking non min/maxers out of my group the first time we are slowing down. But there are situations that are actually ruined by those who refuse to play well, for whatever reason.
---
If one player is doing a bad job, the party can still proceed fine. If 2-3, then it compounds. You have lower dps, so the healer has to heal more (because of longer fights) but then has to drink even more, which slows down everything even more.
---
In vanilla boss kill speeds don't really matter. Wiping once or twice doesn't matter. But if it takes 50% more time clearing a trash-pack, you've just added an hour or two to the whole dungeon.
---
At level 40 on my hunter I started to swap out blue leather pieces for grey mail pieces because I finally got the "upgrade" to mail.
---
Thanks :)
---
Honestly, aside from a few niche encounters when you need a ranged tank or a tank that can take significantly reduced spell damage, an ordinary geared ele shaman with mail is fine.
---
I.e. I've seen a lot of shamans tank bellinda, Mara Princess and other spell caster type bosses really well. Full on instance tanking is doable, but just isn't as good.
---
Still a very interesting read anyway. I learned a couple things from it at least.
---
I don’t think you will be able to do this on a warrior in 7 days without help from another player(s). Joana’s guide is meant for hunters, who can take on some elite quests solo, and alot of the quests are 1-2 levels above your character. Warriors usually need to level in zones 1-2 levels below their level. If you do this on a hunter, you still will not beat Joana’s time, his guide is doctored so that following it to the T results in a much slower (albeit still faster than average) 1-60 time than he accomplished. 
---
You would be best off practicing the run with a warrior first, and modifying it to ensure you don’t waste time dying repeatedly to harpies in the northwestern barrens for 5 hours. (There are other sections of his guide like this too.) 
---
It took him just under 5 days /played. Do you really think you will match his time on a hunter with a warrior? I’ve seen maybe 4-5 players on private servers that can match or beat his time.
---
While I agree about the immersion and story, I had the opposite opinion about the Druid’s gameplay. I’d already leveled a Warrior, Rogue, Priest, and Mage before I decided to give Druid a try. Everything the Druid did felt like a poor imitation of those classes. To be honest, gameplay-wise, casting nukes was far more fun than playing a poor man’s Rogue. 
---
For phase 1 you will have only 2 world buffs to worry about getting, which will be the Songflower Serenade and Rallying Cry. Songflower is a buff you can get with your whole raid or smaller groups if you prefer, simultaneously clicking a songflower together. Rallying Cry is from Onyxia/Nefarian heads and will supposedly be on a 2hr CD for each dragon head, respectively, which is the duration of which the Heads are up in Orgrimmar/Stormwind. If there is no Head in the cities turning in the quest will give people the buff. So for phase 1 the process is simple enough where you would either 
---
1) Get a Songflower first -&gt; portal to your respective city of Org/SW -&gt; either snipe an Ony head by scouting on an alt (in case someone ninja pops) or get the buff with your guild if you're not afraid of being sniped -&gt; Hearthstone to Kargath if Horde, fly to Morgan's Vigil or Thorium Point if Alliance.
---
2) After getting Rallying Cry (either sniping yourself or getting with your guild) -&gt; Get to Felwood and search for a flower -&gt; Get to Kargath/portal IF and fly, same as in 1).  
---
In phase 2 you get the addition of Dire Maul, which introduces the DM: Tribute buffs. This is done by leaving all the Guards, which are the mini bosses in Dire Maul North alive while you kill the final boss, King Gordok. After killing the king you can gain a specific debuff which makes you friendly with all the rest of the instanced ogres inside Dire Maul North, and the Guards that you didn't kill will give you a buff each which lasts 2hrs, disappearing upon death. The buffs being 3% spell crit, 200 melee AP, 15% increased total stamina. Phase 2 buff route can be the same as phase 1, except you start getting DM:T buffs first.  
---
Phase 3 introduces the Darkmoon Faire, which spawns the first week of each month, rotating between Elwynn Forest and Mulgore. DMF gives you a powerful world buff of either increased dmg%, or you can pick and choose a stat of your choice for example (like 10% int, or spirit, etc.). The buff lasts 2hrs. This is a little more tricky to get, especially if the Faire is the opposite factions zone, where there may be gankers around the faire waiting for raiders to show up with buffs. One way to do it if DMF is in your home faction zone is you get DMT buffs first, Portal to Thunder Bluff/Stormwind, get your DMF buff (or "fish" for a better dmg roll) -&gt; proceed with the rest of your buffs. Obviously this is not a "usual" buff you get, only once per month, so it's not that big of a deal to do it when the Faire rolls around at the start of the month.  
---
Phase 4 has ZG, which introduces the Heart of Hakkar item which gives you another 2hr buff (+15% stats and movement speed), from what I recall no cooldown like the dragon heads. You can get this buff while being on Yojamba Island or in Booty Bay. This complicates the buffing route a bit but usually the process is that after getting DMT (+SF optional) you get to Grom'gol if Horde or Westfall if Alliance, get to the island and pop the heart with your guild before proceeding with Rallying Cry or SF.  
---
This about covers all the normal world buffs that one would get for a normal non-casual private server guild. 
---
I did not include Warchief's Blessing because that is a buff that may be harder to get for most people. From what I've heard it might be on a 12hr CD in 1.12, which is quite a long while, and it being popped whenever someone proceeds in the Onyxia attunement quest (it drops when you turn in the quest which requires you to kill Rend Blackhand) makes it harder to get,which would probably require you to snipe it a good while before raid, at least until much later on in the server's lifespan where there aren't many new players attuning themselves. Supposedly it is blizzlike that mind controlled alliance players can get this buff, which a lot of hardcore alliance pserver players do, but that's something 99% of people won't even attempt in classic.  
---
Later on you can get the EPL world pvp buffs from controlling the Towers, or stuff like Silithyst for 30 mins, but those are maybe starting to be a little extreme. I also omitted seasonal buffs, such as Lunar Blessings or Valentines buffs or the wickerman Halloween buff, since they're only available as long as the seasonal events are happening.
---
I can assure you people try for a long, long time to conceive =/ 
---
It doesn't matter who makes the group.
---
You can turn away whoever you want any spec you want. You can play a 17/17/17 agi only boomkin if you wish. That is the point. You are not an asshole for playing any spec. If the group has no issues with your spec then there is no problem. You sure as hell aren't an asshole for playing any spec is the point.
---
My noob story is pretty funny in retrospect. I made a warrior and ran from Dun Morogh to the human areas to play with friends and they told me that my job was to taunt enemies away from them. I hadn't been to a trainer to know that I had the taunt skill, so I spammed /taunt at the mobs. I figured out after a few pulls that it wasn't doing anything and figured it all out, but they never said a word. 
---
That'll do it!
---
&gt; You need a lot of consumables, both for tanking and cat dps including grinding pummelers.
---
You can't take consumeables as a tank once the pull has started, since you shift out of bear form
---
&gt; You need 260 enchanting, devilsaur set and warden staff (atleast pre-DM). Can be quite costly
---
260 enchanting is temporary and can be dropped as soon as you craft the trinket.
---
There's a Silithus quest reward that's 99% as good as the Warden Staff, making it a lot easier and cheaper to acquire
---
Devilsaur set is only useful for cat dps
---
&gt; Some prebis pices like shoulders and gloves requires a lot of grinding since they have both low drop chance and diffrent versions (xxxx - of stamina, xxxx - of the monkey)
---
You can get the Wyrmtongue Shoulders off of Balnazzar, or Shadowcraft Spaulders off of Cannon Master Willey, both in Strat. Those are comparable to any of the random Atal'ai Spaulders **except** "of Stamina' and "of the Money", and don't require sacrificing chickens to the RNG gods.
---
&gt;You need WSG and AB exalted items eventually
---
Won't be available for many months after launch. The only significant PVP upgrade for *bears* are the WSG pants and the AB boots (Revered)
---
Yeah, I think that is fair. I realize this is a PvE spreadsheet but I think it will help with PvP as well, as far as Ret goes. I can tell you in PvP Ret is a monster, and I'm just trying to find a good resource to refer to as I gear one up again. I play one in a private server and on a typical day, I'm a nightmare for people to deal with a BG. I believe Might of Menithil, Hand of Rag, Grand Marshall's Longsword, Dark Edge of Insanity, Tier 2.5 would be a start on BiS ret gear.
---
Didn't BM do a total 180 for raid viability in TBC? I vaguely remember it being a viable spec. 
---
&gt;You can turn away whoever you want and any spec you want.
---
That's not what the vast majority of the "anti min-max" group is arguing. They're saying it's elitist to do that, and a dick move. Why do you think OP included the 2nd category in his post? It's just a few comments basically saying "yea playing weird meme specs in groups is kind of a dick move".
---
No you do, one thing about warlock leveling that I’ve learned is driansoul macros. If your voidwalker kills your target while you are drainsouling, you don’t get a shard. So, you have to have a macro to send back your voidwalker and then drainsoul
---
Agree - problem is most PLAYERS don't grasp the concept of "utility" and/or severely undervalue it...probably both.
---
\- DPS - meters
---
\- healing - meters
---
\- tanking - how much mana do you soak and how easily can you maintain threat and survive
---
"Utility" - what's that??? Brez? Nah, we won't wipe. Innervate? Nah we have world buffs and pots. MoTW? ...OK, stand outside the instance and buff everyone on the way in and we'll use a priest to heal.
---
It's unfortunate, but there are really players who think like this which completely destroys the game.
---
Do you sell prints of these? I'd hang that Caer Darrow on my wall immediately.
---
Never said waiting was fun and I agree that it generally isn't. Waiting at a restaurant for a table, in a line to ride a roller coaster, or the dreaded DMV.... these can all be grating. But, if the restaurant is awesome, the ride is insane, or you really need to get your license renewed, then the waiting is worth it because the end result means something. 
---
I'd rather wait 40 minutes to fight in a BG with players on my server then wait 40 seconds and fight randoms from wherever. To me, that wait is worth it. 
---
getting that weapon skill up doesnt take that long tbh, the first 130 hits or so are like guaranteed skill points
---
a robo-lawnmower is very worth it.
---
There's a huge difference between playing a spec that isn't mathematical gaming perfection and intentionally trying to make your character as shit as possible.
---
In America, summer starts the day the first big blockbuster movies are released. So that means whenever Avengers Endgame comes out :)  
---
Don't go full resto, it's not worth it and you'll still get a spot and have a lot more fun!  You can have a lot of points in elemental and still enough in resto to be effective and it's fun in PvP too. Better quality of life. Don't take my word for it, go research it.
---
Super snacks for me. 
---
It wasn't meant to retroactively fix something they thought was unbalanced though, in the way the class changes applied in patches were, or some item nerfs were. Tier .5, along with some of the blues added to Strat/Scholo/BRD etc. were introduced as "catch-up gear" to help players who started the game later jump more easily into endgame content.
---
For the purposes of Classic I think we will see fewee Johnny Come Latelies than in actual vanilla when it was a growing cultural phenomenon, but I'm fine with leaving tier .5 as catch-up.
---
Apex worked because people werent even expecting a new game release. You will see these threads more and more. Hopefully they will give the date in the GDC WOW BFA stream.
---
It's super fun, at least the first few times. Nothing like moving 40 people across the world from buff to buff and dealing with the enemy faction trying to do the same thing. Definitely more engaging than just meeting in kargath at 530 raid time. 
---
That’s why World buffs are only for farm nights and not progression. You die too much on progression raiding to make use of world buffs. 
---
It won't deter hardcore players that want to raid with buffs. A 2hr CD on Onyxia is not a big deal to snipe yourself. Guilds raiding at the same time will probably come to an agreement when not to pop as to not fuck themselves over, until casuals start being able to pug Onyxia. Nefarian's buff is on a separate CD and I doubt BWL pugs will be happening until much later in the server's lifespan, so there will be no threat of ninja pops when it comes to that head.  
---
If it is accurate that Warchief's Blessing is on a 12hr CD, then that is the only buff that will be at all difficult to get due to the circumstances of how it is popped, and in that regard significantly different to private servers.
---
I don't recall ZG buff having a cooldown like the dragon heads, at least I can't find any evidence and that buff doesn't have a visual representation like the dragon heads/WCB, so that's a guaranteed buff basically.  
---
DMT and Songflower have no CDs so those will be also free.   
---
The buffs will be there for people who can put in the minimum effort of doing them. WCB not being readily available will reduce melee raid dps, but all things considered people vastly exaggerate how different raiding with world buffs will be in classic compared to private servers.
---
Hibernate is a solid CC against beasts (and dragonkins).
---
Feral dps is good for 5mans because in every pull you can offtank an elite or add healing for the tank, if the party needs it. If the rest of the group consists of good players then yeah, you suck, but thats rarely the case.
---
&gt;Okay min/maxers, sit this one out.
---
WhAt'S wItH aLl ThE hAtE fOr ThE mIn MaXeRs!
---
Very much depends on the release date. If i can, i will take my summer holiday (month) at release.
---
That's pretty optimistic, I was thinking August or September. 
---
&gt; I'd rather wait 40 minutes to fight in a BG with players on my server then wait 40 seconds and fight randoms from wherever. To me, that wait is worth it.
---
Fair enough!
---
Won’t be out at release so I didn’t add them.
---
What if somebody has a disability or was injured at work? Come on man.
---
Dm won’t be at release. 
---
Never happened to my guild on pservers.
---
Using a mobile phone isn't healthy either, but I doubt you're over on the Apple or Samsung reddit telling people about it.
---
Guys! I know a lot of people say that Classic raids might be too easy this time.
---
Maybe this will make room for bad speccs.
---
Maybe we can finally invite boomkins, ret paladins and enhancement shamans without worrying. 😃
---
Dire Maul won’t be at classic release so I didn’t add it.
---
It was a decision not to add the cooldown, as unlike retail vanilla, popular vanilla server had 4x its cap on population and also a lot more raiding guilds and they were international, so a lot of raid times.
---
Back in vanilla,there were only few serious raiding guilds and they would just have arranged time to use buff, someone could mess it up for them by turning in earlier, but it usually worked. 
---
Also you can pick any cloth/leather dress, just for fun. 
---
Pretty often they can be with affex of the tiger or bear, armor really doesn't matter. 
---
Dire maul won’t be at release so I didn’t include it.
---
Good RL/GM will make sure there is never more then 5people that needs summons. If you want permanent raid spot you came on time with proper hs location. If you knew you will be late you just notified the raid you will be logging in late for whatever reason and everything was fine. We were more hardcore then casual, but far from The hardcore guild.
---
Good for you but that has nothing to do with this comment chain, all I said was you will not get through Naxx without a good amount of  consumes. 
---
And again, 40 people who don't bother to prep properly can show up and spend 4-5 hours in BWL or everyone can spend a few hours each weeks farming consumes and blow through BWL in 90 minutes. 
---
DKP was the initial revision basically.  EPGP, ZeroSum, and others were all refinements on how to Value Items, Reward Points, and prevent gaming the system.  
---
The initial DKP systems were flawed in that new players were punished unfairly from 'garbage loot' (aka Void Crystals) and mismatched DKP income/spend ratios leading to DKP inflation/hoarding.
---
EPGP solves some, but poorly imo.
---
The best system I used was a silent bid style system, based primarily on boss-attendance.  The silent bid part is key to establishing value base (and stopping stupid gaming like 'one more than bob').
---
I didnt mean any negative connotation by it. But yes also disabled etc. Just someone who has lots of free time. 
---
Dm won’t be at release which is why I didn’t include it.
---
wtf you're crazy man! 😂
---
It’s gotten better since year 2 but the launch was absolutely terrible. 
---
Should have put in a request for the week of July 16th just in case.
---
&gt;That's not what the vast majority of the "anti min-max" group is arguing. They're saying it's elitist to do that, and a dick move.
---
Not really from what I have seen. What I have seen is someone literally saying "playing a balance druid makes you an asshole".
---
I don't mind min-maxers at all and I don't mind people who only play gnomes either. Chances are they wont end up in the same guilds so there is no issue. Everybody knows high end guilds will look for competitive dps and if you are underperforming you likely wont keep your raiding spot no matter what class/spec you play.
---
More laid back guilds/groups probably wont have a problem with some people performing under average etc.
---
As alliance:
---
DMT buffs -&gt; darnassus teleport -&gt; felwood, songflower -&gt; teleport to SW, fly to westfall, log out untill raid starts. At raid start we pop ZG buff, teleport to SW, pop ony/nef head.
---
Then HS to silithus and go do AQ40. Ppl do have L20 warlocks around the world to summon themselves/others.
---
Not sure if you can do that in classic, if there is a CD on buffs like onyxia etc.
---
I actually preferred Druid tanks for 5 mans because they were pretty gear independent and super beefy 
---
DMF buff is random 1-10% damage so truly min max people would roll even days before the raid for good DMF roll (every 2 hours), this would thus be step 1.
---
Before you hit the weapon spec talents in the arms tree, it absolutely doesn't matter which weapon type you are using. I personally always take the Crescent staff from the WC quest over the Wingblade.
---
Because it hits all of the tropes. Your video headline reads like a buzzfeed article or something you would see on one of those blog websites that give you ads as you scroll.
---
Did I really just have to explain that to this guy lol 
---
There are several buffs to be taken and it can be done pretty efficiently. Most guilds do a similar rotation to this: Take DM North buffs (organized groups or individually), then meet at SW/OG for Ony/Rend buff, then go to Felwood and get Songflower buff (this is pserver thing, might be different). Optional buffs are for example a fire resistance buff you get by MCing a mob in BRD, but there are more options that are not very impactful. Of course if its Darkmoon Faire week, you want to grab that buff as well. It can all be done in like 15 minutes if you are coordinated well enough.
---
Orc Shaman, Troll Rogue
---
Orc shaman for pvp and group play.
---
Troll rogue for solo play, ganking and pick pocketing.
---
TBC isn't vanilla. BM was the king in TBC.
---
I might take a couple 3 day weekends but mostly I am fine with letting the rush die down a bit.  Will also be nice to see which servers shake out to be "the big ones."
---
Right. Seemed to remember maximum spawns in vanilla too.
---
But why kill when you can kite ;) 
---
I remember the first time I got an ony buff in vanilla. I was mid 30s, about to head back to STV for some late night questing. (My schedule was nuts, but that meant I was playing like 1-6am when there was no pvp). Suddenly boom lightning! Wtf? I had no idea. But then I noticed the buff and hauled ass back to STV to make use of it. Only learned it was Onyxia awhile later. 
---
I’m going Mage as my first time but this time i’ll be Horde. It’s the class i always play in mmo so easy choice for me🙃
---
I am most definitetly not going to play so much as to cause physical harm to my body. Add to that its summer...the sun will be out, the beaches warm, the trails dry, and the days long. There will be time for wow but secondary to fun in the sun.
---
Try it with your friends first...
---
Used laptops are usually garbage. I've owned about 3-4 gaming laptops over the course of 10 years and they always crap out. They aren't built to last more than a couple years and the gpus always shit out around the 3-5 year mark. So if you buy a 2 year old laptop it will end up dying in 1-2 years. Also the batteries on gaming laptops usually need replacing since they also aren't really made for durability and usually required to be plugged in constantly after awhile.
---
Could not be a issue if guilds just talk to each other. And you could just pickup the buffs 1-3 days before the raid and use summons to get the rest.
---
&gt; For the purposes of Classic I think we will see fewer Johnny Come Latelies than in actual vanilla when it was a growing cultural phenomenon
---
That makes an even better argument for introducing them earlier, giving people a chance to gear up for raids - but yeah, its fine. I just felt sad that it was never really usuable to many i guess. :)
---
I love the guide, and as a vanilla shaman main this brings me a possible alternative end-game goal.
---
That being said...
---
I disagree with the quote from Nocturn "If you've ever tanked and had to tell your dps to wait a few seconds, or to slow down, you as a tank are not generating enough threat and therefore not doing your job correctly.".
---
This I disagree with 100%.  
---
Threat is the responsibility of **everyone**.  Sure if the tank is able to maintain aggro without ever telling dps to slow down, then that's just gravy. Everyone's happy, easy-peasy.  But there's a reason addons like DPS-meters and threat-meters exist (or existed in the context of vanilla).  Threat was a real problem in vanilla, and holding onto it took not only skill but patience and guidance.
---
To say : If you have to tell DPS to slow down, you aren't doing your job.  As a "blanket statement" is ....well absolutist and puerile at it's heart.  There are PLENTY of raid bosses and mechanics in raids, even maybe a few dungeons where people have to stop dpsing because of threat wipes, threat swapping, etc.  
---
Plenty of tanks/guilds had the "3 sunder rule".  That's no different then saying "wait a few seconds".  So I find this quote by Nocturn to be disingenuous at best, and outright arrogant/condescending at worst.
---
my 6 week old will be a 6 month old. I will be playing an hour or two a day, but that's ok too. 
---
&gt; refreshing this sub 5 times a **day**
---
Was that a typo?
---
[If not....](https://i.imgur.com/x9dUvCu.jpg)
---
Depends on how my interview goes and whether i'm still working on launch day. 
---
Either way...
---
All of my free time will be dedicated towards leveling Warrior and Mage.
---
Summer ends on September 23rd in the northern hemisphere.
---
Thanks for telling me where seasons start in the country I live in! /s
---
Video is not bad, but man ... you need to get rid of this intro it is disaster. 
---
Caer Darrow definately my favorite. Nice work.
---
&gt;There's a Silithus quest reward that's 99% as good as the Warden Staff, making it a lot easier and cheaper to acquire. Not sure if the Silithus zone quests are available at Classic launch.
---
What quest? To my knowledge the only item that comes close would be the DM Tribute mace and even that is a bit worse than Warden. Warden really is a must have item if you are serious about being a Bear tank.
---
He was replying to a comment that mentions ZG Buff so he isn't talking about release.
---
Nice, a PUG being able to pull it off with an average healer is a good PUG!
---
Poor kitty! :(
---
I enjoy rushing.  Being capped by end 9f week one is a personal challenge.  And being geared out ahead of each new content patch is who makes the game fun for me.  Going slow burns me out and makes me not want to play.
---
Yeah, I was trying to work out a progression where my warrior uses 2h-maces from 1-60 (because that’s what Tauren start with and weapon skills cost ether 10s or 1g). But I’m not sure it’s possible. At the very least, I’ll have to learn axes as well. Also keep in mind that you may have to cross the world to buy one weapon skill. For instance, Horde side, unless you’re undead, you have to go to UC to learn Swords, and if you’re not a Tauren, 2h-maces, staves, and gun’s are only available in TB. 
---
I will say that taking the launch week off of work is very risky. The week after is a better investment. I would also plan for the possibility of rerolling a few days later based on server pops, which servers streamers are not using, faction/class balance, etc.
---
Just be warned, my fellow no-life scumbags, many people took time off for Nost 2.0's launch and wasted those vacation days due to downtime related to server stability, bugs, etc.
---
Also, somebody here might think they know what "no-life" means. There will be players who grind mobs, no quests, and hit 60 in 4 days. Within 1 week Ragnaros will be killed. So keep expectations realistic.
---
Guy in real life? 
---
I have this, bough around 2011
---
https://www.notebookcheck.net/HP-Pavilion-dv6-7034tx.76490.0.html pretty hot thing, can't run processor on 100% or it will burn lol.
---
Anyway 
---
Old vanilla client on pservers run smooth almost 60fps, but in crowded areas 40ppl raids, cities have like 30fps. 
---
But when i tried classic demo on private server, ye you can setup your own classic demo on your pc, with no npc or objects, just bare map and your character, i had like 25fps so, i want to get new pc, and definitely not a laptop. 
---
I work for the state, and to this day I have roughly 4 weeks of vacation time to use. &lt; we get time off like candy in the candy store &gt;
---
I've told my Gf I'd be looking to take three weeks off to no life it, she complained that it's way to much time and that's un-attractive. 
---
Might just make it 4
---
This has to do with now network time scales with players X^n while the logic only scales X*n.
---
Does it have to be a laptop?
---
Why do you have to put summer vacation in so early? We don't have any deadline on it. The only deadline I have is being polite to my boss and giving her enough time to plan to cover for me if I take days off, but really only applies for full vacations. She takes single days off (and I fill in for her) which such short notice that I could easily take 1-2 days off without much notice, either.
---
I’d say swing speed starts to matter as soon as you start kiting at level 8. Slower weapons mean you need fewer hits to kill, and therefor fewer hits taken (assuming good ping and one hit delivered per one hit taken).
---
If I were your friends I'd sell the same account multiple times.  Since he's got the original key it would be pretty easy to just change the password back on it.  TLDR: don't buy accounts, your friends are hurting the game.
---
Druid could too yea, but they were like 35% less effective at it or something, I would have to look at what the priest thing was.
---
When I played warlock I announced to the raid that I refuse to summon anyone that is still standing in the city while everyone else is in Molten Core or w/e.
---
I was lazy on the shard farming, yes, but my argument still stands. Everyone else came to the instance and I have to waste my shard on you? they are reserved for those who need it!
---
Yep, that's how I'll enjoy Classic as well.
---
Now I have a lovely girlfriend which is the mother of my 2-months old daughter and I won't waste them on WoW.
---
Back in 2005 I leveled solo to 60, ran a few dungeons here and there, and played a loooooot of BGs (Alterac Valley was really something).
---
I plan to do the exact same thing come summer when it's released because I had a blast doing it as a child.
---
That feeling when you get invited to a deadmines group advertised as diremaul, and you realize that dire maul isn't even out yet.

&gt; Godfather's Pizza
---
All hail Godfather's Pizza. I'll take one jumbo pepperoni and black olives, please.
---
Yeah I know, I was just being tangential 
---
glad to know i'm not the only one with these problems
---
SSD is cheap as shit and should not be considered optional at this point.
---
Greetings from Robinson Township
---
Yeah the DPS was amazing and while I was slightly lower level than I wanted (52) I had only blue gear so I was usually resilient enough. We had a good 1hour clear, really quick. We screwed up hakkar summon though :(
---
If i remember right, for priest regen was base+spirit/9 as mana returned outside of casting. For druid it was something like base +spirit/11-12 .
---
If I had a nickel for every time a beautiful girl has come up to me and asked me that...
---
*Well, I'd be broke.*
---
Ofc you can, but it's a dps loss.
---
You don't need the last hit to make a shard, only the talent proc need it
---
Someone just write an “anyone can tank” post already.  You held aggro and didn’t die and you completed an encounter?  Here’s your tank participation award.  
---
I know how you feel man. The other thing we are burderned with now is knowledge -- the knowledge that the itemization for many classes was not great. The quest chain to upgrade tier 0 to .5 was not exactly short, either, so I'm guessing even if it was there on launch, so many people now know it's not worth it and would skip it anyway.

That kind of itemization -- where Blizzard hands you a set and says 'look this is designed specifically for your class at the stage of the game you're in!' but it winds up *still* being less useful to you than assorted other pieces -- is what makes Classic so dynamic, though. So many other games have more "mindless" loot schemas, where the stuff "for you" or for your class is automatically BiS and there's not too much thinking beyond that.
---
Warlock mount quest wont he available until DM is released I believe. Just in case you were relying on that for free mounts 
---
And then? Sell the accounts? 
---
My son is due 7/21. RIP my playtime. Hopefully I can squeeze some in during my paid family leave, but obviously taking care of my kid and spending time with the wife is priority.
---
Spirit is not very useful for paladin.
---
I'm not, I'm taking it slow. One of the things currently bugging me about retail WoW is how quickly you earn things and thus how quickly content becomes worthless, unfun, and you get bored. I loved how games 10-12 years ago took longer to level, longer to gear up, you had more reasons to do the same content over and over and enjoy it, alts started the long, fun journey over again instead of being sped up. There was more to it as well but I'm more casual now and think that's going to work to my benefit. I do plan to heal as I always do since I love it, but I'm not going to rush this. I'll play when I can and enjoy every moment instead of rushing to burn myself out and quit.
---
Have the guy do your chores as payment for staying at your house so you can play WoW.
---
I work as custodial staff at a large college. Summer is really busy because we have to clean all the dorm rooms before the kids come back. So its a pretty strict timeline, especially with summer programs, late departures and early arrivals. With summer being a popular time for vacations and having things like seniority to deal with, as well as a week of black out in May and another at the beginning of August its a staffing issue I guess. They ask for it early so they can let us know if there are any issues by the start of April.
---
You answered the question yourself.  If you can clear it with a good group in 1.5 hours, then you generally want to add 30-60 mins for PUG or "questionable" groups.  Unless you're running with someone twink geared, your kill times/downtime between packs is going to be the same.  
---
Mobs don't suddenly do MORE damage because you have a crappy hunter or priest.  And during the leveling process as you so aptly gave the example of Uldaman, you generally don't have a ton of gear with +healing or +spell damage on it.  MOST (read: not all) of the time you will have people looking for raw stats (stam, int, str, agility, etc)
---
I don't think there's very few, if any situations where I've looked at someone and said your gear and spec are just not cut out for this dungeon, barring a few situations where it was clear a kid was playing and was wearing level 20 green leather at level 40 as a warrior.  
---
And once again, most of these situations are easily resolved by educating the person on their mistakes.  
---
A lot of what you are saying boils down to "This person doesn't know as much about &lt;X&gt; as me, therefore the are stupid and are wasting my time!".  When in reality...YOU were that stupid at one point when you started until someone educated you about the same shit.
---
So in the first post I responded to: your argument was that people ruined your time by taking threat off you, which I described as being un-knowledgeable about how their mechanics interacted with yours.
---
Now in this post your argument is that people being bad at their jobs is increasing the duration of dungeons and thus causing your "angst" because you allocated X time, but now that time is going over your expected view. And you're adding hypotheticals by saying "now I'm in a group with 2-3 bad people who are wasting my time!"
---
And this boils down to you being responsible for curating your own experience.  If you don't want to risk grouping with "bads" or "normies" then don't.  Only group with friends or guildmates, but I have to warn you; making assumptions on people based on their gear, spec, or making a mistake (or any combination there-in) is a good way to make a name for yourself as an asshole on your server.
---
In short:  **If someone makes a mistake, help correct it nicely**.  Educate them...whatever it may be.   If they act nasty to you, berate you, or ignore you/proceed to repeat the mistake; then it's on them.  But if someone is making a mistake, it's often just that: an unintentional mistake.  It's not like they are out to piss you off.  They probably don't want a 3 hour long Uldaman run just as much as you don't.
---
Yeah im just starting to learn that in another topic. TIL.
---
Sadly, yes. I have my desktop computer in my country origin and I’m living in another for almost two years.
---
Otherwise I won’t need to buy anything :(
---
You just answered your own question
---
An argument made by a Mage that pulls mobs with Pyroblast.
---
Not a rogue. Maybe a warrior. But not a rogue. A priest or a mage?  I dunno. But not a rogue. For sure not a orc rogue.  I could go shaman or warlock.  I could go Druid or Hunter.  But I will not roll rogue.  PS, ima roll rogue
---
I leveled a warrior night elf without knowing how hard it would be to level, it was frustrating and incredibly fun and I couldn't wait to log on everyday to see what new loot I would get and what horde I would meet that would ultimately destroy me as I had no idea what I was doing, how to play.
---
I also understood very little when it came to English, so it was hard to learn anything or know what my abilities did, other than trying them out.
---
&gt; I am taking 2-4 months off
---
What do you do that this is even possible...?
---
* Orc - Warrior
---
* Troll -  Shaman
---
* Tauren - Druid
---
* Undead - Rogue
---
* Human - Paladin
---
* Dwarf - Priest
---
* Gnome - Mage
---
* Night Elf - Druid
---
Mandalorian sumbol too?? I fucks with this guy
---
huh?  Are you saying I play a mage or is this Nocturn guy a mage?  I have no idea any of these people in the guide are, from the auther the "self proclaimed fringe tanking god" to the two people he quoted.  I'm just responding to the guide itself in terms of readability and how much it connects with it's target audience (Which is shaman players, and tank players where they overlap.)
---
Ill take you all on a date
---
As a lock in a good raiding guild, I used to farm around 60 shards for a raid (basically, your bags should be full), so you can HS, SS, summon (not this much considering ppl should have HS bind close to the raid) and you can cast shadowburn instead of souldrain during trashes.
---
Always keep a bunch of shards in bank so you'll never go in a raid out of shards.
---
Try to clean DMT before your raid so you can make shards, being usefull for your guild, make some gold and take WB.
---

I have to find a 2004 dell xps for sale...
---
OK, I'll bite. WTF is BRE?
---
I was really pulling for you that you’d go this direction with your comparison. Thanks for not letting us down. Light be with you.
---
Not wasting any of my vacation time on a video game, especially one I've already played and especially in the summer, and I think everyone who does is a sucker.
---
&gt; What quest? To my knowledge the only item that comes close would be the DM Tribute mace and even that is a bit worse than Warden. Warden really is a must have item if you are serious about being a Bear tank.
---
Thank you for this. I was relying on memory and yes, it is the DM mace (Unyielding Maul) that I was talking about. It is not that much worse than the Warden Staff at all, however.
---
As an example, here are the weighted values for the top pre-raid BIS bear weapons. You can easily see how close the DM weapon is compared to the alternatives:
---
1. Warden Staff   (322)  &lt;&lt;== world drop
---
2. Unyielding Maul  (311)  &lt;&lt;== DM quest reward
---
3. Headmaster's Charge (188)  &lt;&lt;== stamina only
---
4. Twig of the World Tree (131) &lt;&lt;== world drop
---
5. Spire of the Stoneshaper (125) &lt;&lt;== BRD drop
---
&gt; I would argue Devilsaur is pretty good for tanking. Hit is very valuable and hard to come by, and your other options for this slot arent that great. 
---
Devilsaur is great if you are lacking threat generation on other pieces. But it's not about getting a specific, perfect piece of gear for a slot but something good enough to get you a raid upgrade.
---
For example, the Warstrife Leggings are definitely pre-raid BIS for bear mitigation, but the Shadowcraft Pants, Wildheart Kilt, Cadaverous Leggings and Plaguehound Leggings all also have good mitigation (not quite as good as the BRD legs), but they have more threat/dps. The Devilsaur Leggings have even less mitigation but even more dps. So it's really a trade-off and good players will know what all of their options are rather than trying to laser-focus on one particular drop.
---
Mp5 disappeared with Cataclysm iirc
---
I think there is actually a really good chance of it coming out in September! I wish you luck man I really hope they come out with some dates soon. 
---
Snow removal.
---
&gt; delaying the release date. 
---
They haven't delayed anything, its excepted summer of 2019 so they have a lot of room to work with.
---
I've been managing just fine to be honest. Lots of Apex since it came out, lots of Civ 6 since it's on sale for $15, working my way through The Forest, also played a bunch of Conan Exiles during it's free weekend. There's no shortage of good games to play in the mean time.
---
It's a sword off of rag that procs for reduce armor on Target but supposedly it procs too much on private servers compared to vanilla
---
I would prefer DKP for 40 man groups, simply because it'll be a huge pain in the add to make decisions for that many people. 
---
For smaller, tight knit groups, I prefer loot council. Sometimes it's better to prioritize your better skilled players who will be the back bone of progression. 
---
Brother, it's not having a sticker that's the problem.  It's having a *Horde* sticker that renders him forever unattractive to females
---
Thanks!
---
No, because you need the killing blow to get the shard.
---
Same!  Congrats on the baby!l
---
Where was this? I'm levelling a warlock on a private server right now and this is not the case. As long as you are chanelling while it dies I get a shard, but only get the mana regen if I get the final blow. Could be a difference in servers?
---
Is it anything like Viscera Cleanup Detail? I loved that game!
---

I've given it some more thought, and what you say isn't far from the truth. I'm most likely going to add ranks to grant to more dedicated and well-behaved players so they get first picks or a positive modifier to their roll. But i'll have to see, thanks for your input; i am quite serious about getting this to work myself.
---
And someone in this very thread said that people should be banned for that very reason from classic. 
---
It's hard right now to determine right now for me who is an asshole and who isn't. 
---
Right now I feel like everyone on this sub is one. 
---
If your guild expects you to summon 20+ people or provide everyone with cookies for each boss attempt, then you need to find a new guild.
---
Mage,  because I started as a warrior in classic and always envied mages. Also, the Drifting Mage PVP video from classic always made me want to PVP as a mage. 
---
Mine was last week, but I saved all of my days from the previous year, so I should be OK. 
---
I remember one of the early rogue quests sucking REALLY bad. But it was immersive though!
---
There are simply too many videos about vanilla at this point and people keep creating more and more. And most of them have the same stuff on it just from other perspective
---
That moment when the Forum looks better than Blizzards
---
&gt; does it really matter that much if you don’t cut your lawn for a week? It must grow ridiculously fast.
---
Not OP, I live in the Midwest, and if I don't mow twice a week, it gets completely out of hand.
---
/moo
---
Balance of Light and Shadow is the Priest quest to get Benediction/Anathema. By far my favorite quest.
---
Mate you do get a Soul shard as long as you’re channeling Drain soul when the mob dies. 
---
The macro to lure your VW back is to make sure you get the killing blow with drain soul for the Improved Drain soul the talent for mana regen. In a raid al you want is the shard, you shouldn’t have the talent raiding anyway. 
---
Hope this clears that all up 👍
---
World buffs in a nutshell: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6zrQJquPbI
---
Yes, that is correct.
---
Gonna continue my journey on my main of 12 years, nelf druid :)
---
Considering I missed vanilla and only started in late BC, this gives me a chance to experience druid at every version of the game
---
Blasphemy! Go play retail WoW and get off this sub
---
Even without going sweaty neckbeard on the weekend its just not that hard.
---
4 hours per weeknight already gets you half your time.  10 hours per weekend day and youre at 40.
---
Depending on travel/work schedule that leaves 2-4 hours of other time on weeknights, and 6 hours for other stuff on each weekend day.
---
I mean, i probably dont have time for that really, especially with summer coming up, but 9 hour days, an hour and a half of driving, gym 3 nights per week, etc factor into that.
---
Before i started going back to the gym and it was winter it was really easy to do that because fuck going outside more than i have to when its 30 below.
---
Fortunately Resident Evil 2 is also a huge nostalgia trip for me. So I'm just trying to finish the game on hardcore mode with S+ rank so I can put it behind me once and for all. I love Mr X in the game. And this is coming from a non-gamer.
---
The interesting thing about these are the “here are all the buffs you need to get this to work”, which I usually don’t see offered up.  Never thought about MCing a paladin for blessings.  
---
Spoken like someone who's never actually tried engineering and seen just how usefull and actually *fun* it is.
---
Incorrect. You only need the killing blow to proc Improved Drain Soul, which any raiding Warlock shouldn't have.
---
u/dngrs You want to have all the shards beforehand so you can craft + trade the healthstones while everyone is being summoned. There is no time to distribute the stones once the raid gets going, except to replenish the tank or some melees if they ask for it.
---
Unless you're really wanting to try something new, it sounds to me like Druid is the class for you.  It's the only one that can Tank/Heal/DPS 5 mans, so you could get a taste of all 3 roles at level 60 without needing to level anything else.  Could be fun running dungeons with friends and working towards building out different gear sets for each spec!
---
What will you use for scent for searing gorge?
---
ZG comes with or after BWL, you will never have ZG without DMT
---
Im going dwarf priest (good option because of fear ward, but would probably still play one without it) simply because i want to be a dwarf.  Theyre badass.
---
If you play with a priest as OP stated who can heal you up for a pittance of their mana pool, then being hit by the mob is actually favorable, because you can accumulate rage while the highest DPS the priest can  economically gain is done by wands. 
---
Other than that we will have to wait if Blizzard tweaks the current movement patterns of mobs.   
---
As it stands now, mobs behave differently from vanilla WoW and can not be hamstring kited in classic. 
---
We will have to see how it works out for solo leveling warriors.
---
At times, yes
---
Every race does, Dwarves just have the best ones.
---
Gnomes actually get a couple of pretty big/neat beards, but theyre not Dwarven beards.  A Dwarf has a beard the size of a gnome.
---
I would love for them to start re-releasing the old expansions. I mean, we see how profitable it is for studios to release "enhanced edition" versions of games on a previous console. Some people may have missed out on specific expansions, while others would love to reply them. 
---
I regrettably missed out on WotLK and skipped MoP. I would love to get a chance to replay both of these with a fresh start, especially WotLK. 
---
If the numbers are there, I can't see why Blizz wouldn't do it. 
---
letting a virtual world control your real world. get a life
---
Lol, I did something similar the first time I went to ubrs. Got ganked by 2 rogues in brm. asked for help. Entire raid zones out. MC raid ruins our shit. Most of us zone back in, but some poor bastard gets mind controlled into the lava, so he rage quits. A couple more drop, and then everyone does.
---
LOL stealth was so FUN!!
---
I loved ganking Alliance when they were killing mobs. Just so damn fun. Let their health and mana go down a bit then jump in at the most opportune time. You could feel their rage through the screen. One of the perks being a rogue.
---
I’m starting to think my buddy is getting sick of me responding to everything in Discord with “but is classic out yet?”
---
Taking a week of PTO, and my wife is going to a Yoga retreat in the mountains.  Just gonna be me, my dogs, WoW, energy drinks and some sort of microwavable food.
---
Farm gold. Dominate the economy on my server.
---
Getting teleported as the tank is always rough. Best you can do is swap into a 2hander, zerker stance, whirlwind + berserker rage + bloodrage and spam cleave. If retaliation is off cooldown then going battle stance and using it will instantly solve the problem.

Spirit is great for warrior and there are staves with like 27 spirit very early in the game
---
Auction the items off. Way more income that way. I would say that gathering professions are easier money while production professions will generate more after putting the time in to build them up. 
---
Good to know thanks for the info. To be honest though I was hoping to be ripped by then but, it's okay that I won't be. I discovered Joe Rogans podcast which led me to a ton of alternate ways to work out which I love. I always hated the bench press and the curl ect.. ect.. the normal tradition gym rat exercises and tools.
---
Turns out though. I absolutely adore using maces, clubs, sand bags and persian meels. I just feel like a bad ass the entire time I am working out. War dancing is also way more fun then any traditional work out but, I guess thats wrong because technically war dancing is the most traditional lol.
---
Yeh. I did that last year I’m glad I have some distance between when I last played and launch. Doesn’t reduce the cravings of wanting to start my permanent character. 
---
Thanks man, this is exactly what I was looking for. I was worried my healer would get jumped on by half a dozen mobs lol Didn't think of using heals. I just hope DPS will behave.
---
Not for me until later expansions.
---
I love to dps. Druids only are good for tanking and healing in classic. 
---
The nostalgia and gameplay are just as fun as you remember. 
---
What I do specifically isn't important, but it's the fact we have a strong union that will allow me to get the time off.
---
I was just making a joke about some not thinking threat management is everyone's responsibility.
---
Played retail wow from end of legion to bfa it’s not in a good place with a write armour. 
---
Very good point !
---
Full time students got HW by either failing out or sharing accounts. Is it your honest opinion people will be so casual about HW that you will be able to get it with just 8 hours a day? You have no idea the depths of depravity and neck beardom this community is capable of.
---
Your brother self sustaining with spirit and lets you focus on dmg instead of healin.
---
Yea, it's up there with illegal danish imo as one of the iconic vanilla vids. The soundtrack choice was outstanding as well
---
As a dedicated druid healer since day one of vanilla... You really didn't rely that much on hots back then. That started it TBC
---
Beat me to it.  This is 100% right.
---
Look at you, living somewhere you can go 4 months without snow.
---
There is not a single month of the year I haven't encountered snow where I live. It's just a fact of life. Yay for mountains.
---
gz!
---
The first question you have to ask yourself is. Do you want Vanilla or do you want something different? You can't have both.
---
I think the soundtrack choice is what made it so special to me. And still does. It just fits 100%
---
Warrior tank. Because I am a masochist.
---
Unless they are like me and get way too overconfident, especially before they get feign death. 
---
"An elite 2 levels higher than me? Idk, I DO have the onyxia buff..."
---
Dude....... In what universe could this possibly be a good idea? Why do people keep asking for changes? What is even the allure of classic for someone who is actively seeking changes to the game before it even comes out. If you want a fully balanced mmo with the kinks worked out play retail. If you want the best mmo ever made play classic. 
---
I’ve said it many times and I’ll say it again.
---
NO CHANGES
---
I mean I’m all for it. plan on going combat swords, so my experience will be more or less the same as classic. 
---
It's been gone for years and the best you can do is find some archived pages on the internet wayback machine or some guides that were copy/pasted to the ownedcore forums.
---
I think the warrior whirlwind quest is most fitting:
---
"here young warrior I present to you a quest that will be nearly impossible for you to do for the next 10 levels even if you have help from equal level friends, you will die alot, enjoy." 
---
Fits right in with the rest of warrior leveling.
---
Bro I have felt that way since 2005 when the game first dropped. This might sound stupid but WoW killed video games for me. After wow nothing was ever big enough. Nothing was ever social enough. Nothing was ever rewarding enough. This is the only game worth playing in my world. No substitutions. 
---
Mage!
---
I cry...
---
I like to take my time waking up in the morning.  I used to take flight paths before getting in the shower, kill a couple mobs before I finish getting dressed, or fish some fish before putting on my work boots and heading out the door.
---
The extra 15 minutes a morning really added up in the long run.  It was also nice to start my day with a small accomplishment already completed and clears my head before jumping into work.
---
I'm married now so this time I'll probably get a strange look thrown my way, but everyone has a process and mines pretty harmless.  Lol
---
I would love to just no life the shit outta the game when it comes out, but sadly, I don't think I will be able to. So even if I would love to raid, I think it's out of the question as of now. Thank you for all the informations though !
---
I'd like to play a hybrid tank/heal class (for the Horde!) so there's only the Druid choice at least at a pre-raid level (even if I need 6 months to reach that). If I don't, I'll either play Warrior or a Priest, depending on what can get me in dungeons/raids the easiest way. I think I will let a dice choose in the end..
---
I did this all the time. Good memories
---
In 15years of WoW there has no balance been achieved so far. 
---
In TBC they had to butcher faction pride and cohesion by implemented paladins and shamans for both factions, because they could not get the balance right.
---
What makes you think they wouldnt get it wrong once again?
---
Definitely. I tried so many other games trying to about a certain BC Pvt server... But in the end could not resist... I'm dying over here waiting for classic.
---
5 guys is alright, you'll be broke eating it all the time 
---
You make valid points but Resto druid PVP has many strengths as well
---
You are extremely effective vs melee and rogues especially.  Faerie fire is a joke to rogues- 1 minute of no stealth LOL.  Roots are crazy as well, if they don't have a paladin or priest nearby to dispel it lasts like.. 10 seconds at least if they aren't being damaged by other dots or nukes. 
---
You are extremely effective while healing mages because of your mobility and CC combined with theirs.  I've done 2v3 or even 2v4 with a mage friend between sheep, nova, roots (all on different DR) and the nuke potential of a mage combined with your wrath/moonfire can drop someone right quickly.   THen when you're playing defensively you are using roots, hots, or regrowth to keep the mage up while they blink/nova etc.  
---
A paladin on the other team is your hardest counter- dispelling all your roots and dots and counteracting your hots by doing quick, efficient heals of their own.  And of course any druid that roots a paladin needs to re-examine their life's priorities =P
---
But even in larger scale fights, stand in a safe spot and do close-to-max rank healing touch for big heals, or downranked healing touch/hots if no one is critically low.  You can put out a lot of hp/s across 2-5 targets on par with any other good healer.  Your weakness is big instant heals- other than NS of course.  max rank healing touch is still 3s with talents and regrowth is extremely mana inefficient, and doesn't heal as much as shaman LHW or priest flash heal to make a big difference. 
---
I've pvped a lot as resto druid and AB is the best.. standing back from a fight and keeping people up- node defense is great with your survivability and CC.   Focus on what you do best and do that as much as you can!  Screw those melee!
---
Think about it this way: if you go PvE you're basicsally an extra in a movie. Nothing that happens to you matters and you're existence is forgotten save a few who may recognize you.
---
As a chad PvPer your heroics will be the stuff of legend. Tales will be told of your acts and exploitations in the field of battle. 
---
Ah Yes, silent bid has always been a thing for me as well. Seems like there are quite a few mechanisms that I have experience with while using DKP that are not necessarily normal. 
---
Deciding between 1-2 weeks off from work. I’m going all in, wife and I have plans for our first kiddo next year, this may be my last hoorah.
---
World buffs weren’t reserved for ‘hardcore guilds’ at all. Almost every guild I was in would ask whoever got the head of Ony/nef or heart of hakkar to hold it until the next raid if we were progressing through content. 
---
The main difference between pservers and classic was that originally, there was a two hour cool down on turning in the head of each respective boss, but since the population on private servers is that much higher, most of them have removed the cooldown.
---
I haven’t seen that statement actually, anyone else know where that was said?
---
You do not need to land the killing blow to get a soul shard. I used to top off shards on trash all the time.
---
The music soundtrack was fitting for this topic. This is a masterpiece in the WoW movie genre, for sure.
---
That is a hardcore player...
---
Inb4 yeah it seems like wow classic wasn't received the way we had hoped so we're cancelling the project. We thought you wanted this but turns out you don't.
---
Smugface
---
Balancing specs out is a great idea in a bubble, but that would change how content is completed as well.  The domino effect would be too great.
---
I feel sorry for you, if you feel that you'll need world buffs to clear BWL.
---
They're gone after one death anyways, so functionally useless in harder raids. 
---
I received many requests from people to be able to search my [progressive itemization db](https://https://itemization.github.io) for item names or at least lookup by item ID; I decided to take it a step further and wrote a comprehensive search frontend for it. There are summary tables on the home page of the new site that explain how to use the search feature, and if you have any questions/suggestions/bugs to report don't hesitate to post here or DM me on the Discord.
---
Current plans going forward are to add more search operators/categories and a UI with dynamic dropdown lists to be able to choose search filters visually instead of having to type it in the search bar.
---
I'm leaving the old site up because many people have already linked to it in guides/posts/etc.
---
Yeah I've got Sekiro pre-ordered but all I wanna do rn is sit and watch god damn vanilla videos and read about stuff I already know all about like guides etc.
---
Beautiful. Thank you.
---
As a former Enhancement Shaman who occasionally tanked Onyxia and MC trash I appreciate that we are not forgotten.  
---
No. I'm going to enjoy it in a relaxed manner.
---
My only intention is leveling *all* my professions along with my character, even if I have to spend a week fishing and cooking, and not doing anything "XP-productive".
---
I've nolife'd before, and frankly it took the fun out of the game.
---
This time I'm going forward at a very leisurely pace. But if anyone wants some idle banter in /g at night, I'm your guy.
---
If I hit a PvP server, then just enough to hit 60 without getting griefed too bad. Otherwise, it's a marathon not a sprint on a PvE server.
---
No. You can't play Ret paladin cos they'll fuck it up and content will be trivialised. Why do people insist on playing vanilla but also playing meme specs. I just don't get it.
---
You won't have to reroll anything but you have to set your expectations correctly. Don't try to guild a hardcore guild has a sub-optimal race/class combo and no one will tell you to reroll. 
---
Go on arguing guys, it's really insightful :D
---
That’s a good point, I guess I just feel for the people that want to dps or tank as a pally or Druid. But at this point, if you are rolling it you know what you are getting yourself into? 
---
Keepin those priorities straight, my man!

Sounds pretty fun to me, sounds like that guild is gonna get shit done and not waste any time.
---
Not a lot of faith in blizz Ayy? Guess I can’t blame  you. Considering what wow is today. 
---
There is about 10 SF spawnpoints in Felwood with a 25min CD for respawn. You cant have SF as an individual responsibility without having players of the same guild/raid fucking each other over. SF should be picked as a collective effort with the raid standing around it and counting down before click.
---
If memory serves: Hunter, Ret Paladin, and Rogue were the go-to classes for casuals back in the day.
---
&gt; Hell, I woke up this morning and it was 42 degrees outside
---
Damn it this guy must live in Australia or some shit
---
&gt; cold enough to warrant a jacket
---
Oh, Fahrenheit. Nevermind.
---
In Vanilla, as in Classic, Rallying Cry buff and ZG buff were / will be on a 6 hour CD. On private servers, there is no CD.
---
DM buffs were used in Vanilla, albeit not by many guilds, only those actually raiding AQ40/Naxx.
---
In Classic, the usage of World Buffs will be impeded by the 6 hr CD. Yes, you can use it, in cooperation with other guilds, before raids. But if you wipe...you will continue without. On Pservers, due to 4-5 times more guilds, Ony on 3 day CD, and no internal CD of buffs, Rallying Cry (the most powerful buff) can be used at any time, repeatedly.
---
That opening line is so obnoxious fucking hell.
---
I'm no expert but I believe weapon DPS &gt;&gt; any stat, so inferior stats or no, a slow, high damage staff will beat a lower dps strength mace any day
---
&gt; A 2hr CD on Onyxia 
---
It was 6 hours. 
---
Priest. Reason I say that is you hate grinding and farming and you love healing. Priest is very easy to get a full set of nice blues at 60, you can run instances and make pretty OK money doing RR orb runs, etc. You can collect as much cloth as you can and try out tailoring so you don't have to go out into the world and grind. Getting a group is pretty easy, not as easy as a tank but pretty easy. 
---
PvP kinda sucks on a healing priest TBH. AV is your best bet, otherwise you'll be purged/dispelled/locked and that bubble and inner fire will wear right down and you'll be hamburger meat. Leveling up on a PvP server until shadow form is pretty rough as well as far as fighting gankers, but fortunately if you stack nothing but spirit the leveling in general is VERY easy.
---
You leveled to 60 with a warrior on fresh in 4 days and 20h? How?
---
You’re doing it wrong. Fly over enemy player. Shift to bear. Feral charge down. It’s called Bear bombing.
---
Well said!
---
Maybe in low level dungeons, of course you could also just get a lock or hunter pet to tank those.
---
Hah! I once died to a priest dotting me right before I hit the ground. It put me in combat so I couldn't change form.
---
Light watch over you on the other side of the world, my brother.
---
I'm mainly poking fun at Tabetha's quests. The other mage stuff is far from the worst, especially the quest for Polymorph: Pig (which is hilarious).
---
&gt; I have something like 220 hours right now
---
I'm gonna take a wild guess and say you don't live in America lol
---
Play whatever class/spec you want to play. Aside from arcane mage I truly believe you can make anything work. 2h fury is still top-tier for dps, so don't worry about losing damage, you'll still hit like a truck. Bring rage potions. 
---
Genuinely made me laugh. :P
---
Here's the real tea on min maxing.
---
People that don't min max do it because they prefer something else aesthetically and play for fun. However, they also do not like the idea that people that do min max might have an edge over them or be more desirable in any way. The truth hurts but there is a "best" when it comes to certain aspects of the game. If you don't want to follow the "best" then you are free to not do it, but you also can't get mad at people for doing what has been proven to be superior. 
---
It's a game people, if you want to push server first min max no life go do that, and if you want to be a pretty night elf priest do that. No one is stopping you. And if we're being completely honest the people that min max and the people that don't will most likely not play together. The people that do min max will probably be 60 in less than 2 weeks while the rest takes a month or more. I'm sure there will be plenty of room for both so this entire argument is very silly.
---
People that min max aren't taking your spots because most likely you will not be in the same wave of 60s anyways! Just have fun, if you prefer aesthetics over stats/utility that's okay, just don't go shaming the rest!
---
I have a yoga ball and am going to buy one of those under the desk peddles (like a bike) and my SO and I are going to rotate them when we play since this game will likely take over our lives. 
---
Can’t wait!!! 
---
Ya same here. I sit down to my PC, and I have a disappointing feeling that classic is not installed. 
---
Ayo pittsburgh! 412 baby 
---
&gt;I feel sorry for you, if you feel that you'll need world buffs to clear BWL.
---
I feel sorry for you, if you're wiping in BWL and your sole concern isn't the speed of the clear.
---
My current plans are to roll a Holy Paladin, mostly because I've never actually had a Paladin in the many years I've played WoW. I enjoy healing which Holy Pally was one of the best back then and class identity was real strong so I'm getting pretty hyped for it.
---
Warlock, Resto Shaman, and Fire mage (in roughly that order) all have some serious nostalgia going on for me though so I'll probably  start some alts eventually.
---
The only ones I remember doing were the warlock ones and I had a good but expensive time. I had help from my paladin buddy that was levelling with me and a higher level warlock in my guild for the Dreadsteed 
---
there is no hate towards min/maxing.  
---
the hate goes towards the attitude that anything else then min/maxing won't net you proper results in this game.  
---
and its always purely from a PvE perspective which is inherently wrong anyways.  
---
you can min/max for PvP too and still raid. 
---
telling people they won't raid as XYZ or that they be stuck wiping in MC if they don't comply are retarded misinformation.
---
you'll raid as w/e you want. you clear the content as w/e you want.  
---
the game is so fucking basic and already tuned to be beatable by way less then the most efficient setup.
---
I'm not wiping in BWL chum. I'm a main tank, subbed since launch, have bronze statue, and did it all in original wow. You are just a tryhard.
---
Orc - Warrior, Shaman, Warlock
---
Dwarf - Hunter, Warrior
---
Tauren - Shaman, Hunter, Warrior
---
Nelf - Druid, Hunter, Priest
---
Troll - Hunter, Shaman
---
There is the slam spec, which is definitely strong, and there is a heavy bleed/dot spec you can do after debuff increase. 2h fury is sweet, man. 
---
I've pretty much given up on waiting on the FF7 remake. I feel like I've been waiting for it for 10 years. 
---
Oh man I’ve done 4 play through in assisted. I should try hardcore but I’m scared of even more limited ammo and heals. 
---
The funny thing is we all know the first week will be absolute hell of a launch. I'll be requesting work off the following week to actually be productive.
---
You don't need a killing blow to get a shard through Drain Soul. Stop spreading misinformation.
---
That's exactly what I do, and you're right, it does help a lot.
---
But I also need to go grocery shopping, clean my flat every other week, get some studying in so that I can continue to grow my career, Gym 3 times a week, wash dishes, keep up with finances, etc.
---
This means that I only have a couple of hours in the evenings and maybe evenings on the weekends.
---
I'm just in a special time in my life where I am a bachelor living alone so I have to do everything myself but I am too young to outsource any of that since I don't make enough money. I can see now why most bachelors live in a shithole, it's a lot of work for one person to keep it all together.
---
On top of that, I have a GF who I have been doing LDR with for 3 years now. (We've been together for 5.) So every month I either fly to see her or she flys to see me and she doesn't like it if I have raid nights while she's here. (Though she didn't say anything about it, she's not exactly happy that I'll be picking up Classic.)
---
It would also help if we got rid of this 8 hour a day work week. I'm not doing 8 hours of solid work which isnt just bad for the company, its bad for me as well since that's time I could be using keeping my shit together.
---
It's fine, I'll work it in, I want to work it in. But I won't be a hardcore raider, that's for sure. (What I like most about Classic was the social aspects and levelling anyway.)
---
Mages = scum
---
when i started wow, not to long before the aq events started, I asked a friend what the least played class was and played that because I wanted to be useful.
---
I was a warlock and, because my friends were on the faction, a human.
---
I justify the pointless hours by saying it'll help me figure out what class I want to play come launch. Been trying paladin and still unsure if it's what I want.
---
Any good links? I just started playing on a private server for the first time (because I couldn't wait for classic release and want to settle on a class) and are in total vanilla mood just like I were 25 years ago.
---
Alchemy: Orc? That's a bit of a stretch. I think undead and their apothecaries are much more fitting alchemists, wouldn't you agree?
---
You have no taunt.  You have Demon Armor, but it doesn't add up to plate OR a shield, let alone both.  Your AoE damage will burn a lot of mana, especially if you're getting hit and lose out on channel ticks.  Hellfire costs health in addition to mana, as does life tap (to get mana back), so you have a lot more healing your healer has to do.
---
You have a problem with my guild and I striving to play as optimally as we can?
---
The specs are viable.  The fact they are not viable in the area you want them to be is you trying to force the spec to be something it isn't.
---
Like trying to  haul a 5th wheel with a Smart Car.  Or trying to parallel park a semi-truck.
---
My hype has already started to die unfortunately. It's taken way too long. 
---
Never played a mage. I only mention shaman because I'm overweight and the quests involve so much running... I still have nightmares man.
---
You take tryharding to an absolutely absurd degree. This hyper-preparation just really masks the fact that your guild probably performs like shit. We don't need any of this.
---
Hey man, whatever gets your goat.
---
OF COOOOUUURRRRSE. 
---
I'll be really sick of doing bicycle crunches 
---
Searing pain is a repeatable high threat spell so, which is alot better than something like earth shock for example but on the aoe sides of things maybe they would take to much damage so maybe single target only?
---
Good point.
---
I'll probably just start a fire in my waste basket. Or burning paper.
---
Let us not forget incense
---
Druid excels at being the "Swiss Army knife" class, but for any given role, there are other classes that can excel. They are best suited for Resto in the endgame, but even in that role if you want to be the God of healing there are other classes that do it better. I enjoy being able to heal strongly through skill &amp; dedication to improving my gear, and keeping a set of tanking gear to put me at the front of the line for 5-man dungeons. No other class can change roles so easily &amp; have access to performing any role the game has to offer.
---
&gt; It's a mechanic that punishes players who can't farm or PvP with their raiding spec and punishes trying to participate in PvP and PvE content.
---
I really wish it was easier to get this through the thick skulls of the #NOCHANGES people.  Out of all the great things about vanilla the whole respec cost was not one of them.  It made certain classes very, very frustrating to enjoy and essentially punishes you for wanting to be participate and be competent in pvp and pve.
---
Sure, but my experience isn't that. The hate I personally see for mixmaxing seems to always come from people who weren't talked down to, they were just denied a spot in a raid. Just like "sorry dude, I'm gonna take someone else instead" type deals, or even more frequently on retail, no dialogue at all, just no invite sent. It's even more exacerbated in TCGs (as I mentioned earlier), where that happens way more often. People without any prompting will just shit all over netdeckers or people who actively try to improve their decks (the equivalent to minmaxers). Nobody will have even said a word to them and they come into a conversation with "netdecking is bullshit, real players build their own decks, netdecks only win cause they have money to buy expensive cards!" etc. etc.
---
I can't see a reason for unprompted hate for minmaxing outside of it being an ego thing for the person hating.
---
Yea, man, these dudes online make it look easy. I managed to get to Birkin 1 and saved there.
---
I've noticed Leon doesn't like to draw the fucking knife when I press the L button. It's 50/50 on whether or not he pulls out the knife on time. Using an xbox controller on a PC
---
&gt; cern is that a lot of Druid tank gear was added in DM:E. So you might be slightly less
---
I'm more concerned with getting enough gear in order to get into DM (and the other five mans) than what I can get out of there.  The group I'd be playing with will just funnel me whatever gear doesn't get grabbed.  I hope that eventually they will be geared well enough to compensate for my lack of preraid bis tanking gear and I will be able to jump into whatever group is looking for either a tank or a healer.
---
Anyone care to make a friendly wager? I say no release date 
---
While leveling, Int and Spirit all the way.  Your spells are plenty strong, but your mana pool is not.
---
At higher levels, SP starts to take over.  This because you can start to make use of downranking to be more efficient, and SP kind of also becomes an efficiency stat.  
---
If you're overgeared for your level to the point that you don't have mana problems, or if you'd rather drink than regen your mana pool, then going SP over Int/Spi will start to make sense.  
---
We have two Thunderfury, two Ateish almost done (absorbed someone from another guild) and 15/15 Naxx cleared on E****** server.
---
Please enlighten me, what exactly do you think is "performs like shit"? The fact that we get world buffs?
---
There is only one change i would "like" but i don't want it because while it would be nice it takes away from what the game was back them. In my case auto flight path so you don't have to hop off and on, but I don't want it done.
---
Everyone has their ideal version and because of that there will be no true consensus. And I, like many others i assume, would prefer to keep it how it was than make changes that people think are "for the better" it is what it is and hey that's why people are so excited.
---
No lock outs except if you spammed too many dungeons. Could only do so many a day. But a lot of people will only join a full run in my experience. It was rare people were ok with continuing a run already almost done. My experience though.
---
It's decent, not my favorite. I don't have a good burger place near me anymore (or non that I know of). But I agree, its super expensive and I'm not sure why. 
---
DKP is objectively better than LC for everything but the most competitive guilds.
---
Topkek, there won't be dedicated servers, it will be in their shitty cloud still (and I am not even sure if they keep their promise about disabling sharding after launch..)
---
What about having two Thunderfury's and one legitimate Ateish says that you are good raiders? You are beholden to the luck of the binding drops, nothing more.
---
Also, almost done isn't done. Just saying.
---
Well I don't have school or anything but it would certainly suck either way since I know a few people online that won't be able to play as much if it releases that late. Of all the people I have talked to (that goes to high school/Uni or work), early/mid summer is the date they are hoping for since they will be able to play much more compared to late summer when things starts picking up again in real life.
---
"Get ready for a classic summer" and it's literally in the final days of summer... that would be straight up trolling.
---
I do live in the US! I get 16 hours sick and 16 hours annual per month. Plus 14.5% employer matching 401a. Life's good.
---
Yes, my hype is already dying, I have to submit my long vacation plans in 10 days and we still don't know shit of an exact release. I will most certainly miss the launch because of this early notice bullshit.
---
I will play classic only if its released on first or third week of the month.
---
I’ve only played on PS4 my last Claire run on assisted was 3h43min so now that I know the path I’m pretty sure I could get an s rank completion in normal. I haven’t really watched any hardcore mode videos. 
---
I'm in the same boat, if it's September I don't know if I'll be able to play, I assume they aren't going to do that to us but it's 2019, nothing matters anymore.
---
Druid is vastly superior to hunter and lock pets. They can tank every dungeon in-game without any difficulty coming from the class and in most cases, better than warrior. They have more HP, more mitigation, more threat.
---
The only place they have trouble is in 20-40 man raids against hard-hitting bosses, due to no defense gear and no CD abilities. At that point warrior gets more avoidance and more mitigation against spike damage (but druid still gets to have more armor) 
---
That is the only place warrior is clearly better and preferred.
---
It's bearable..
---
&gt; Also, almost done isn't done. Just saying.
---
We're looking forward to server first. It will be hype.
---
Also, I'm sure this isn't the first time you're hearing this, but you sound like a completely insufferable twit. I can almost smell your neckbeard from here.
---
Sure the Epic mount won't be available. The lvl 40 will be though. I'm a fulltime career + husband, so if I even make it to 60 before DM is released then a miracle has happened lol
---
That's probably an accurate time frame.
---
Hype is here and can't stop. I will start a new job starting september so there is no way to take time off right in the start. June would be way better. But that doesn't really matter. I just have the few hours I got count more.
---
Im the opposite of nearly everyone, probably.
---
The game coming out before late September will be really bad for me.  I live in WI, so i only get 3 months of nice weather per year (okay, 4-5)...and i want to be able to enjoy that when its here.  Things like going fishing are pretty important to me, and i'd rather not feel 'obligated' to choose between the two.
---
Now, once late September hits, thats out the fucking window and i dont want to step foot outside any more than i have to for the next ~6 months, so even if i dont plan to play 'hardcore' i can still borderline no life it because theres nothing outside that interests me.
---
So i guess worst case is June 21st, best case is September 21st.
---
Plus ill know exactly how much vacation i have left at that point (resets in Nov) and can take a couple days here and there to play.
---
It's possible.  But at that point you probably have a main tank and would be better served to deal damage.
---
Instead of speccing around tanking, it's more that you would be a stop-gap for the healer to try and peel something off the healer.
---
Guys you shouldn't no life a video game. You're going to burn yourself out, this isn't retail, there's no rush for 60. Do your regular shit, chores, exercise, social commitments and play wow only after all that is done. The joy of vanilla is the journey, take your time and enjoy what has been in the attic for the past 10+ years. See you in azeroth 😊
---
Nightelf and tauren conflict is stonetalon mountains. Dwarf conflict is Arathi highlands with the undead. Generally you will go to every quest area. It isn't uncommon to do the wetlands as every alliance race. 
---
What are you asking? Are you talking about players or NPCs?
---
Just about every faction will have to kill NPCs of every race, unless you go out of your way to grind other areas when you have quests to kill said faction. You'll kill more alliance-side NPCs as a horde than alliance, but you'll kill some horde as well.
---
I'm already pretty hyped, but as soon as a date is announced my excitement is going to fly through the roof.  My job offers 30 days of PTO and I'm just sitting on a chunk of them waiting for a date.
---
Just about the only way I would be disappointed is if they announced a release date in late April, as I'll be on a work trip for a week.  But that's super unlikely.
---
In order to summon yourself you'd need several accounts, which implies multiboxing. This is allowed in retail and will probably also be allowed in classic. More accounts means more subs for blizzard so I dont think they'll mind.
---
Yep, did this a lot. Got up in the morning before work/school and hearthed back since my HS was on cooldown when I logged out the night before. Super legit strategy.
---
You don't like killing certain races? I have a solution for you, PvE realms.
---
Watch Madseasonshow on Youtube instead of all the other rubbish. He's very chill. Video's are way more aimed at the people who want to play it casual and enjoy the game. Nothing about BiS Lists xp/hour and the lot. Just appreciation for the game we all love. His class picking video is also awesome. Just 1 hour without commercials in the middle of explaining each class, what the pro's and con's are. What your roll will be. Nothing about you should pick talent A over talent B and all that other nonsense.
---
Honestly I think it wont make much difference to me. I am super hyped. But the real hype will be for around 1month before. 
---
I’m in this boat, mainly because I just want another summer before classic consumes all my free time &gt;.&lt;
---
Got my S rank a few weeks back. It felt damn good as I'm not a gamer by any means. Shit, it took me several hours to get used to using analogue sticks. I was always a D-Pad kid. Even in the PS1 days.
---
Classic was THE world pvp time of WoW. If you don't want any conflicts you will have to play on a PvE-Server. Otherwise depending on your leveling speed you will have to fight your way through from level 30ish on till 60. And with lvl 60 the instance entzry gangs and fights for farming zones begin to start. My advise is, play on an PvE-Server.
---
Greetings from Brookline!
---
I'm so glad I don't have a wife, I'm even more glad I don't have any kids, so it's just the job I have that's stopping me from nolifeing. 
---
Weekends though will be good.
---
depends on how many people expect healthstones and if you can hand them out as you go. I remember doing mc and just handing them out one by one as we killed the mobs on the way to the first boss and i would just soul drain each one and make them.
---
I never actually dealt damage until I was done just drain and hand out.
---
Yeah that's a valid concern.  I might have to play it by ear with regards to server health....
---
You're welcome! Glad I could help. 
---
That's the spirit!
---
&gt; After killing the king you can gain a specific debuff which makes you friendly with all the rest of the instanced ogres inside Dire Maul North, and the Guards that you didn't kill will give you a buff each which lasts 2hrs,
---
Can you get a buff from the last Guard that most DMT groups kill?  The one just before killing the King?
---
If everyone stealthed past or invisible potted what buff would he give?
---
In the yee ol'days of Vanilla I ran into a few Locks that tanked for my groups. It can work, it just requires quite a bit of coordination. Viable but certainly not optimal. If you have friends you will run instances with and are on voice chat, I would say you can pull it off.
---
Warlock alt to summon to raid entrance + a raid group that doesn't dick around and you can get the first pull with 55 minutes left
---
Hot pockets!
---
&gt; don't waste your time responding with your "nobody knows anything" drivel
---
You really aren't good at listening
---
You could roll on a PvE server if you don't want to kill opposing players.
---
Not really he's just clearly communicating he's not looking for min/max hard core input. The advice given after that request is very different then the advice given before. For instance if you aren't a min maxxers you should not play a warrior. They suck way too much if you aren't.
---
Autoflightpath was in classic, not at release but they patched that in there. 
---
I did 1-60 on a Warrior in about 8 days as my first time playing classic WoW. I did play a shit ton though.
---
&gt; I haven't raided on my current pserver yet, but I frequently get Onyxia and ZF buffs just by standing around BB and SW. So it's not just hc raiders doing this, but everybody. And why wouldn't you do this? It's really easy.
---
You've misunderstood.
---
The buff hits everyone in the zone - these buffs are being activated at a specific time to hit 40 people in a raid group.  You benefit from being there at the same time.
---
Later down the line when classic is established, I would entertain this idea. Not right now though. Let them get the foundations in place first.
---
Rogue, I always avoid rogue and mage. Especially mage because I consider them the spoiled kid classes of classic wow. They want for nothing and basically have everything handed to them on a silver platter. Well for the first time in my life. I want that platter. 
---
Yeah as i said Mirah's Song is BiS OH (off hand) until maladath or hakkari. So i think you just misunderstood me. Slow wep = Main Hand, Fast wep = Off hand. So for this example Thrash Blade would be MH wep and Mirah's would be OH. Other viable Pre-bis MH's are sword of zeal and krol blade, with Dal'rends set being the best but hardest to obtain. I'd recommend trying to get a Viskag asap and pair that with Mirah's until ZG comes out.
---
Except I didn’t log out, I just shadowmelted. 
---
Anyone want to exchange emails for a classic pittsburgh group this summer?
---
I've heard that people would actually use warlock tanks on some high shadow damage fights, but I can't remember which boss. Searing pain can keep threat pretty well, and you've got VW sacrifice bubble as well as very high HP.
---
However the are *not* good tanks by any means, or in any other fights. They definitely are not good raid tanks. You could possibly do dungeons, but you'll be pretty bad at it and will need a very good healer. I wouldn't recommend trying it out, unless a tank bails halfway through a dungeon and your group is willing to try it out.
---
The only thing lacking on that pserver experience was that I couldn’t get into a bg at lower levels. Really missing some old school pvp lol but the community and environment felt great !! Laid back for the most part and people were really willing to help out and just enjoy the collective experience. 
---
Fantastic tool. Makes it very easy to see what items were added in patch 1.10 and 1.11 that won't be available until AQ releases in classic according to their current phase release schedule.
---
Huh for some reason I thought that was bc, but I remember stopping at paths in vanilla. My mistake.
---
You're talking about Captain Kromcrush. He doesn't give any buff, but if you leave him alive he gives you a quest to kill the last boss in DM: West, giving you some blue gloves.
---
Honestly, it's a tough decision for me, but I think I'm going to take it in strides and really enjoy my time. I don't want to set aside my real life responsibilities for a game anymore, but no disrespect to anyone who's living the #nolife.
---
No. It was less effective than shaman tanking and even that was barely viable. Against caster bosses yes but even then you'd have to stack his elemental resist and stam. Better to just let the warrior do it, with spell reflects and interrupts.
---
I'm not obliged in any way to listen to you.
---
Holy shit that sounds like a sweet deal. Is that common for your state?
---
My old main, the mage, though I keep going back and forth if I should give horde a try but damn their cities suck compared to allies.
---
Hi, /u/fearthepib
---
Should of got married last year just to get it out of the way mang!

I'm 95% sure we/AutoMod didn't remove these, but I'd need to dig further through the mod logs to be certain.
---
I've started to make my apartment wow-compatibel. I'm about to build a second PC, a "media computer" from my old computer parts and connect it to the TV in the living room. My fiancée actually belives me when i lying about its purpose. So   
---
But I'm getting married 2nd of august and going on a 3w honeymoon. Atleast I will have rested bonus when I get back.
---
Made a new account just to comment. I guess I have you blocked... I wonder why.
---
Lmao I was thinking kinda the same thing.  I'm a tryhard wpvp gank enthusiast and casual players are so delicious :P
---
Check out some Beyer Dynamics. I got the DT770s for only $200 or so CAD. Fantastic cans!
---
Stealthed as a Rogue, I'll sap people and then run away. Or, if I see someone auto-running or /following, I'll try to chuck a Distract at them to stop them. IIRC, the Distract completely breaks auto-run or /follow until the person comes back to their keyboard and re-enables auto-run or /follow.
---
Rogues can be peak petty, IMO.
---
I didn't but I did say the fastest will. People like monkeynews are monster of efficiency and have done it so many times already. I myself am still wondering how I will do without ww at 30, and I'm just hoping to find people for SM for bone biter. On a non fresh server however I already did it in 6 days and I wasn't as efficient as I am now. Just kill every mob in sight on the way to your quests, grind some times, and it's not too hard. 
---
Yeah, the fundamental limitation in group content is: Can the healer heal through it? If yes you succeed. If not you fail.
---
It is pretty damn sweet. Though no, not common at all.
---
Have a look at the announcements for their other titles compared to when they actually released.
---
Shammy, Druid or Paladin seem to suit your needs best.
---
I didn't misunderstand, you did.
---
I meant the world buffs get popped too frequently for them to be only done by hardcore raiders. It is done by everybody, as in every raider, casuals as well.
---
Cool, I don’t mind going after a lot of gear. Thanks
---
bahaha
---
Ah, thanks for clarifying. In the end, I was looking at the speed of Mirah’s Song incorrectly. For some reason, I was thinking that was 2.8, not 1.8.
---
Remember Hobbs? I used to watch so much of his stuff. Truly a YouTuber before it is what it is today.
---
Get mad.
---
Yeah I didn't think it was. If it was I would move wherever that is in a heartbeat, lol
---
Yeah and people would pay for respecs, being able to tank, I would usually make sure no rogues came along to make sure I got all the leather 
---
Wish I could but I'll play every day for a few hours probably. Just can't allow myself to actually go all out like a 15 year old again. 
---
Searing Pain tanking gets used on Twin Emps, and heavy Destro AoE talents can be used to tank adds as they spawn during phase 1 of Nefarian.
---
Spirit tap fishing while healing dungeons as shadow spec adds an enjoyable element / mini game to otherwise routine healing jobs during 1-59. Agree with mind blast, or even mind flay for the ones that run away 
---
That simply isn't true with a competent tank. I cleared up to 4hm in vanilla and only nub guilds with garbo tanks "waited" on DPS. You have gotten laughed out of any competitive guild for not going as hard as you fucking could, and if doing so pulled from the tank then the tank wild be replaced.
---
Sorry it's so hard to imagine, but based on your text you have never really experienced a skilled tank or group in general.
---
It was never as bad as people tried to make it out to be. You soulstoned, summoned a few people, gave a few healthstones to high priority targets (tanks) then refilled them on trash. Real talk...
---
All these stories about people carrying 28 in the bag, and another 30 in their main bags was seriously not common. MAYBE to push the guild over the top for a C'thun kill or some shit. But there ain't nobody handing out no 40 fucking healthstones for Chromaggus man gtfoh.
---
Its seriously seriously exaggerated.
---
Well duh. No one said you have to accommodate people in your raid. That's not what anyone is saying. 
---
Ret paladin was just prot paladin. https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/AcwEP8A4MAM8kDA I dont remember the exact build (on mobile) but that is roughly it. 
---
Imagine being so hatefull you want a beloved game to fail and see the people who love it in anguish. 
---
Then again the enjoyment I have from knowing how sad you must be, is tasty :)
---
I won't be able to. Work and other commitments. 
---
Considering I have 0 experience in the game, for a while I'll probably be playing the class improperly no matter what I do, and I don't like healing so I chose to play feral because it seems the most fun.
---
ya I am the same. I want to do all the dungeons and explore all the zones. I am banking on probably 6-8 months before I hit 60. My original toon had 32 days played once I finally hit 60, and I think that pace is what made my love the game.
---
Do you really struggle to understand that people have different goals / ideas of what they find fun? You know that famous quote about the journey being worth more than the destination? Not everyone wants to blow through everything in this game at hyper speed
---
Yeah as others here have said. Earlier in the summer would be a lot better.
---
yes ofc
---
The boss that warlock is using as a tank is Twin Emperors in AQ. It's actually better than a warrior tank. Outside of that, warlock is highly suboptimal.
---
Ok i got it i'm just starting so naturally i copied what i saw from other youtubers.
---
Thanks for the feedback,
---
 ill try and make sure my videos are more on point with the title and less generic then the usual vids that you see...
---
Meh, as long as each lock brings 10ish with them into the raid, it's totally fine. You'd have 40-60 total and you won't need more than that. People just have to pull their own weight.
---
I’ll be hyped either way, but as a teacher the earlier in the summer the better. Give me a solid couple months to no-life the crap out of it. 
---
I'm highly amused that anyone who is in a group with a gnome rogue would be a "poor soul". Because the extra fraction of a percent of damage that comes from being a human or whatever will be the absolute worst thing that could happen to those "poor souls".
---
I think it was for resistance tanking.  Demo locks with the felhunter out got a good deal of extra resistances (60 resist all? Been a while).
---
F
---
breh some of us have been waiting for 2 years, you can wait a little longer. if real life shit comes in the way that's a big ol' too bad.
---
Warlocks have the coolest. 
---
Always thought the Paladin ones could have been cooler. 
---
Shaman feel cool but the traveling is annoying.
---
Warrior is definitely underrated. 
---
The boss that warlock is used for as a tank is Twin Emperors in AQ. It's actually better than a warrior tank. Outside of that, warlock is highly suboptimal, but it can work with some coordination for world farming or maybe some 5 mans.
---
Put the kids to bed -&gt; put on some laundry -&gt; bang out dishes -&gt; Be logged in and productive in game by 9PM -&gt; flip the laundry -&gt; be asleep by 12:30AM -&gt; wake up the kids by 7AM -&gt; abuse auction house on second laptop at work -&gt; come home and spend some time with family -&gt; help get dinner on the table -&gt; put kids to bed.
---
Friday &amp; Saturday night do social adult things with the wife.
---
I'm so hyped for this.  
---
Content is a joke either way IMO, might as well tune hybrids to be play worthy.
---
Are you a chemist by chance? Going off your name. 
---
Hey and I also was in a LDR but we've since gone through immigration process now and are married and living together. 
---
Hope you get a good work schedule sometime! I work in a research hospital and my schedule is totally flexible so I choose to come in at 6:45am and I leave at 3:00pm every day like school! 
---
Just my opinion--druid was really fun to level for all the reasons you stated. Going feral and having good tanking and good dps at your disposal plus good enough healing for 5 mans makes leveling a blast (so long as your group as someone with a standard res spell). 
---
At level 60, I mainly wanted to raid and I was pretty disappointed with my options. I could heal and that's it. Talk about viable vs optimal all you want, but balance and feral are going to be hard sells to just about every guild unless you're good friends with the gm.
---
By "over heal" do you mean "heal beyond the maximum hit points of the tank" or "heal too much"?  The first one doesn't generate threat.
---
We don't know that. They've only stated " Along the way, we’ve taken a close look at items that provide the biggest power gains, many of which were introduced in 1.10 as part of a sweeping dungeon itemization pass. That patch was when Tier 0.5 gear was introduced, and Relics were added to the drop tables of many bosses. It also adjusted drop rates and drop locations of a lot of gear (to make room for the Relics). We’ve gone back and reconstructed many of the most heavily affected drop tables as they existed prior to the 1.10 patch, and we’re planning to update the drop tables alongside the Ahn’Qiraj War Effort. Prior to the Ahn’Qiraj unlock, most of the drop rates and locations will look as they did in the patches prior to 1.10, with exceptions—there are lots of little changes made in earlier patches that don’t have a big effect on player power, and in those cases, we’re planning to use the 1.12 drop rates and locations. "
---
So we don't know what versions of what we are getting when yet.
---
I've gotten a 60 on a pserv recently.  If you PM me your pserv and faction and they happen to be the same as mine, I'll mail you some 10 slot bags (best I can make atm).
---
Morning shit routine vs. Morning wow routine. When you get married you can’t have both. 
---
First of all i wouldnt say that hitting tropes make the video a clickbait, as for the title i see what you mean and next ill make sure it wont look like one of those godaweful buzzfeed clickbait videos, so thanks for feedback.
---
But the 23rd is on a Friday!!
---
Thank you ill take that into account! 
---
Yeah. Whatever class you like the most is the one you can level to 60 and not get tired of. And one you enjoy playing at 60. 
---
Druid seems fine, though. I'll probably end up rolling a bear druid, not having the time for lots of raiding, but I can tank any 5 man and will still be a viable tank for pug raids. 
---
Shamans can tank dungeons fine, and paladins do fine dps. Shaman tank is the worst of its 3 play styles, and ret is its worst, but ret will be just as useful in pve as a balance druid. Neither is really better by much
---
My loading times were so long, and sometimes my server would be full that I would hide somewhere whilst doing simple rl stuff, instead of logging out. Sometimes coming back to a corpse.
---
Telling someone who rolls a Tauren shaman for the first time they picked the wrong race; or telling a ref pally on his third alt that his build isn’t worth a damn and he should respec if he wants to run Sunken Temple with you isn’t making the game more enjoyable for anyone. Variety in MMORPG games is the spice of life and as long as they aren’t in your hardcore group / guild what does it matter to you?
---
I’m really tall IRL but love playing soccer, can’t wait for a stranger on the street to bring up why I should’ve played basketball my whole life!
---
That is a tbc server just ddnt get out lv 20 zones for the video, p.s look at the talent tree.
---
And thanks for watching
---
I like the way you explained this.
---
My philosophy has always been that if you can hold your own and we can get through whatever we’re doing, you can play whatever your heart desires.
---
The real answer to all this is just join a guild of people who enjoy the game in the same ways you do and all will be fine. 
---
Wow, Classic. 
---
I fucking miss that. Sucks to lose a raid but that kind of shit makes the game so much more fun than anything like it today. Frustrating sometimes, but worth it. 
---
This is fantastic! One question, is it possible to have a sort option in there that looks at class requirements? For example if I could say "class:Rogue" I would only rogue tier and PVP gear, but if I said "type:armor subtype:leather usable:Rogue" then I would see all leather, that a Rogue could use (i.e. not Druid Class Gear). Either way, this is my new favorite vanilla db!!! Thank you!!! 
---
Hand of Reckoning was 30 yards. Same as Exorcism. 
---
Yeah just keep sticking your fingers in your ears and yelling "WE DONT KNOW ANYTHING THERE ARE NO SOURCES"
---
Enhancement shaman lfg.   
---
Played vanilla as a druid, mostly feral.   Offtank alot, went kitty and healed.
---
I never leveled a Horde character in vanilla and am looking forward to it.  Interested in a daytime guild, I'm from Toronto, but work nights.  I'll be a nightfall b*TCH, will even craft it myself.
---
Was barrens really that cool?  Chuck Norris kicking me in the face for 200k Crits is exciting, 
---
There are so many things appealing to be changed and they appear to be objectively good, but we really dont know what a small change could cause. For example, part of what could make bad specs viable is having more gearing options for them - it plays a huge part in viability of some hybrid specs. But that could be easily used by some pure dps classes and it would just make them even more OP. It's kind of better to just let it as it is.
---
&gt; my real life breathing
---
I don't even know how to react to this sentence.
---
I'm hoping it releases 7am US CST time on a Wednesday. That way I'd get to get ahead of everyone else a little bit easier =P. I just hope it's not a late night release.
---
You're a hunter. No one's gonna take you seriously anyway ;)
---
&gt; Always keep a bunch of shards in bank so you'll never go in a raid out of shards.
---
I swear I've read something about putting bags full of pre-farmed shards in your bank somehow or other.   Do you know anything about that? I thought you couldn't bank bags that had stuff in them.  Is it different for soulbags, or am I missing some piece of the puzzle, or did I just misread something?
---
Trying to decide between mage and warlock for my alt and this is one of the things I'm trying to figure out.
---
These are great stories, guys! Even more stocked to play. To be the guy helping and being helped. The community will be so much better than retail.
---
The hero all of us, shaman tanks need
---
But they're not Big Fuckoff beards.
---
Got about six weeks of vacation to burn that I've saved up over the last few years. Heading to the beach in early June (please baby Jesus don't let Classic drop that week) and then will probably burn a few weeks on launch. 
---
I've warned the missus about what's going to happen post-release, but I don't think she fully comprehends the monumental importance of this event - or just how willing I am to go full on troglodyte mode for a couple months.  I suppose how hard I no life the game will be directly tied to her patience...
---
Exactly, it's a Q&amp;A about a different game. Why won't people understand that?
---
double down and be a moonkin tank.
---
Three buckets. One for piss, one for puke and one for beer. And make sure that I label them carefully. 
---
That's what I mean though. I agree that everyone (min-maxers included) decide who they want to play with!! If the popular opinion says otherwise, I'd love to hear what's their point, cause I don't get it.
---
What’s the problem?
---
Assuming you aren't being sarcastic my issue with this is simply how little gold matters in vanilla wow. Unless you are going to gdkp runs and overpaying for raid loot a tier behind, it doesn't really offer anything tangible outside of a few viable BoEs. My girlfriend had gold capped toons in vanilla... didn't really mean anything other than I got to respec as much as I wanted lololol.
---
9 mounth after wow classic demo. Seems like someone enjoy the demo a lot more than other...
---
Well... Fuck.
---
I'm starting to get anxious about the release date, as I'm in the same boat as many others regarding vacation time. If it releases in June/July, then I'm fucked, especially if they don't announce it soon, so I'm hoping mid-August or later.
---
lame
---
A good hunter can make your life a lot easier too!
---
Definitely would log on before school every morning to chat with other kids in my school. I don't remember being productive really but I probably did a bit of leveling too. 
---
I'm getting in some quality RvRing in DAoC while I wait. 
---
Check out Monkeynews if you want to learn how strong warriors are 1v1. Most people are just bad players!
---
Asking for this now is like asking to be crucified.
---
Wait for a year or two, when people have played and get bored and the “no changes” trend moves to “omg fix this shit”.
---
Besides i want to see if the meme specs are still as bad as they were. People on pservers have been able to do some crazy stuff with them, given time and resources. I am cautiously optimistic that they will be a bit better this time around. We will have to wait and see.
---
Hey guys, Hobbs here. Today were running sm
---
I agree. 
---
This was my mentality with another MMO, to wait as long possible to see who the top 5 guilds will be, but it ended up backfiring and costing me not being in the best guild on the server. By the time you know who the top 5 are going to be, it might be too late and they won't have a need for your class anymore, so I recommend joining some prospective good raiding oriented guilds ASAP. By the time guilds establish themselves as well as the top on the server, they will be pretty picky. You can always guild switch to a better guild later.
---
If a Hybrid or Warrior announces “DPS LFG”, they don’t get an invite, even if I need a DPS.
---
If they advertise as “LFG, can DPS or Heal/Tank”, try get that DPS spot. 
---
WE WANT KORAK
---
Apply hunters mark to players way to high level for me to attack anyway.  Just to make them freak out. 
---
Played hunter for 4y on a private server and unless they need tranq shot or traping u were just the guys for the aura. 
---
I am still going for hunter anyway. It has been my main for ages. I would say the best class for solo elite quests, some dungeons etc.
---
I don't know. It kinda just breaks my brain. Weird.
---
Hey good luck getting 40 man on a 1.25k (50/50 horde/alliance) server that will speed run it with you my man. Especially with the influx of new players and previous stated deviations that are on private servers.
---
That sucks to hear. Why remove Korak? This is not a good thing fellas.
---
I think the people who talk about “private server toxicity” must just be talking about for posts, either that or they expect an exact vanilla community replica which isn’t possible 
---
Imagine the day before!
---
put a blessing of protection on the warrior right before you duel them
---
Depends on the quality of the guild and number of warlocks in the raid. But honestly its fine, you will get into habit of keeping SS on your and farming them continually and it's not really much different from buffing the whole raid or distributing water to all the healers. I wouldnt let this fact turn you off from chosing a warlock because it's pretty minor in the grand scheme of things. Actually, if you do your job well, people will like you and you might get some benefits ;)
---
This, as a rogue main since vanilla I always toyed around with sap and distract.
---
I'll do that, and you can keep peddling YouTube screenshots with text added in MS Paint as a reliable source.
---
Did ford and gm like... come together and say "hey lets make the same car!!!"??
---

---
Could maybe do something for iOS with this with an API, if you think an app version would be nice
---
Huge difference between that and a spec. I’m all for human warlocks
---
15 minute AVs it is.
---
Hahahaha you've gone full "world is flat" retard now, they are full youtube videos that are over 7 years old...
---
Not a warlock perspective but rather from a melee dps/tank, the healthstone stuff is a non-issue. Your melee should be generally using Whipper Root Tubers and keeping a stack or two on them for raids. Yes, Whippers give less health than a Healthstone, especially if the lock has the talent to increase its potency, but no melee is going to be bothering trading and waiting for a healthstone in a good guild. The pace is fast enough where you simply shouldn't have time to get that shit, especially compared to how convenient Whippers are to farm. If anything I can see Healthstones being passed around before raid or at the start before pulls happen but I wouldn't be bother with that.  
---
The only exception to this would be Loatheb, where the difference in hp is significant enough to make or break an attempt, but that's the only fight that comes to mind where the warlocks would give out healthstones to most of the raid.  
---
Similarly, the summoning stuff is also overblown. Guilds on private servers mandate specific Hearthstones depending on what the relevant content tier is. For Horde they will have a Hearthstone in Kargath pre-AQ release, then Cenarion Hold in Silithus and finally LH Chapel in EPL, you wouldn't be expected to summon more than maybe a couple of people at most, and even then it's on those people to have the right Hearthstone. The only exception to this is if your guild is being targeted by the opposing faction where they might set a trap in Kargath or Cenarion Hold etc,, which is a situation where you may have a contingency plan of having summoning alts help out with getting the raid infront of the instance (this is not an issue for the vast majority of guilds).
---
If they don’t have the data from previous AV this makes sense. I would rather we get an exact re creation than a total guess at the older versions. It would have been cool to have started with the old version and then switch to the newer one though.
---
I guess you're talking about OP, I don't think min-maxers will ruin anything. My point is that  they shouldn't get pissed when ppl say they don't want to play the optimal spec, cause it shouldn't concern them. You can choose not to play with the "lazy or bad" as you call casuals.
---
Onyxia disagrees.
---
I ask about quests I don’t carw much about pvp.
---
Don’t care about pvp  asked about quests.
---
If it releases in May-June, constantly. 
---
If it releases in August I will fall behind and literally cannot play it at all due to school.
---
It better come out early summer...
---
Bonereaver's Edge

---
good, fuck the mines
---
I would say that a June 21 release date would be preferable to my current situation, as I am going back to school in Sept and all I have until then is work and house renos.
---
My first char was gonna be a dwarf pally anyway but I suppose I’ll stick to Alliance.
---
&gt; You don't hate min/maxers, you hate not being invited to their raiding groups because of your choices.
---
Nah. I lead the raids. I boot people who are dicks to other people in the raid, especially when they freak out about what they feel to be less than perfect spec and gear choices. 
---
I've been refreshing this sub on the daily just waiting for a release date. No other games are capturing my attention at all.
---
I feel you ! Planned same  - now my girlfriend's pregnant and we gotta move to our new /bigger home in summer x)
---
Luckily birth is expected September #soon(™)
---
Honestly. I liked it. I would show up early and just head out near whatever raid we were doing and listen to music. I only needed to get about 20-30 to use shadowburn whenever I wanted and summon people. Our raid had 5 locks though so we were sharing the burden of support tasks. 
---
Shut up dork. We bitched and moaned for “classic” but want everything revamped. Part of the fun of classic was imbalance. If you want everything the same or optimal, retail is still 15 bucks. Have fun. 
---
yeah. pretty weird there is still no date.
---
&gt; You can't take consumeables as a tank once the pull has started, since you shift out of bear form. At least that's how I remember it! 
---
True, but not my point. I am not talking about potions, i am talking abour elixirs, pummelers, juju's and flasks. Also manapotions are required for powershifting as a cat.
---
&gt; 260 enchanting is temporary and can be dropped as soon as you craft the trinket 
---
Yes, but its still quite a gold sink, especially if you drop it after getting the trinket. 
---
&gt; Devilsaur set is only useful for cat dps 
---
Yes, but if you want to be useful as a feral druid you have to use ur whole toolset. That means tanking some fights and DPS'ing or healing other fights. There is little reason for taking a druid over another warrior otherwise.
---
&gt; Won't be available for many months after launch. The only significant PVP upgrade for *bears* are the WSG pants and the AB boots (Revered) 
---
The upgrades (that also are BIS) are  [Highlander's Leather Shoulders](https://classicdb.ch/?item=20059) and [Outrider's Leather Pants](https://classicdb.ch/?item=22740). Yes they wont come until a later stage, but the grind is still real.  
---
Point is that feral druid requires quite an investment. You do not need to do all the grinding but since there is such a stigma against feral druids and also since your total usefullness can't be shown in any DPS or HPS meter you need to show that you are dedicated. This also depens heavily your guild. But as i said there is litte point in taking a druid over a warrior unless the druid is comitted, if your guild allows it and you can live with being the fifth weel most of the time you dont't need to do half the stuff i mentioned.
---
It's ironic because April Fool's jokes are supposed to be things you're glad aren't real, but this actually looked really cool and scary, something that people would really want.  They've tried to do something similar in things like the Vault of the Wardens dungeon in Legion, but it's just not really it even though that is a cool dungeon.
---
As for Classic Alpha, because it literally uses Warcraft III's engine, no doubt they were trying to use the fog of war from that game, and it's a shame they couldn't implement it.  Oh well.
---
An unhealty amount, plus some
---
Not if the boomkin has a dark iron pulverizer pops out of cat instant auto 8 second stun, double starfall gg.
---
Dual wield is higher damage but requires more hit% and thus more gear. Early in progressiom 2h warrior will kill the meters, then DW overtakes it as they get gear
---
It's not a bad base start point. Given there's going to be some time between Classic release and PVP release hopefully that gives Blizzard some room to take a look at BGs a bit more.
---
They could certainly add some iterations of the earlier AV into the base to flesh it out if there's community demand.
---
I’m playing FFXIV but I’m just watching non-stop classic YouTube vids on my other monitor. I’m looking forward to the new Shadowbringers expansion but it is gonna get dropped as soon as I get access to Classic.
---
Ah! To be excited about gear upgrades again!
---
“My what a big staff!”
---
“The better to PWN you with!”
---
If one or two die, then it's a royal pain in the ass. I was okay healing dungeons on my druid, but I'd only do it if someone else in the group had a normal resurrect spell.
---
I’ve tried tank dps and healer in multiple mmos. I choose to heal because a bad healer can ruin a group more easily and quickly than a bad tank or bad dps. I’ve witnessed it and compared and contrasted runs and runs. It’s also a thankless job. 
---
To play healer in a 5-man group is also completely different than playing it in a game like overwatch where they are very much “support”. Many misconceptions are made about MMO healers from people coming from those team-based shooters, assuming it is a passive role where you stay behind. On the contrary, you need to have eyes everywhere and manage the situation by-the-pull; to tunnel vision will spell your group’s death. 
---
I love being the healer. 
---
trinket mage is stupid fun
---
No drops from enemy players is pretty lame.
---
That makes doing av way less profitable unless you have herbalism or mining. 
---
Horde exists, yo.
---
Confirmed how? You can play defense.
---
Holy hell, *full* seven year old videos? I am so convinced now.
---
There are a lot of full YouTube videos by Flat Earthers. Not exactly convincing.
---
Maybe I need to explain what I mean by "It's guesswork". I don't mean that they just pull out numbers out of nowhere. But there is no official source and no reliable documentation for the numbers.
---
A YouTube detective is not a reliable source. A few data points fitted to get the same number is not reliable. They might be correct by accident, but when I say "we don't know if it's correct", I'm saying just that. We don't know, and you don't know. Maybe they are, probably they are close, maybe they are way off.
---
Just saying we know is misinformation. We don't know, and pservers have been proven wrong before, despite screenshots and YouTube videos.
---
There was nothing "well said" about that post...
---
There’s a reason it’s called a trinity though. All roles need to pull through the requirements, it’s just that bad play simply makes it harder for everyone, and depending on the challenge certain roles will have it harder of course so I would say it’s not a matter of meeting the minimum requirements but who has it easier overall I think.
---
What’s **usually** the most impactful role in high end PvE though? Seems like it’s DPS right?
---
&gt;Korak
---
They're not removing him themselves, he was removed with 1.10, before 1.12. 
---
“My god if you aren’t playing this game to chase world first then you shouldn’t be playing. Frickin casuals” 
---
When I roll warrior, I refuse to group with other warriors while tanking. If a warrior begs for a tank in trade, I tell him to learn to tank. Not here to carry dps warriors.
---
Healing dungeons is fine, however you don't have a standard resurrect spell. If one or two people die, it instantly becomes a huge pain. 
---
No issues healing in raids since you'll definitely have all the other healing classes in there as well.
---
All of the classes you want to buff in DPS are already very formidable in PvP. You will shake that balance up by balancing them. IMO, the best thing you can do for them is give them better gear in a new raid tier long after Naxx gets boring.   
---
Not to nitpick too hard but have you heard of powershifting?
---
TrIgGeReD sAlT 
---
There were many different iterations of AV that existed in Vanilla.
---
If you play on the big private servers now (you all know their names) it's a weird mix between all of them.
---
So just be aware when you talk about how much you hate/love this update that you're probably assuming a lot of stuff that you don't realize.
---
I want to try tanking but I’m nervous that I don’t know the dungeons well enough especially the higher level ones. Is there a comprehensive guide for the dungeon layouts? 
---
Thanks!!
---
Yea I plan on rolling a mage and just throwing food and water at people. Also ports. Probably will do enchanting / tailoring and help some people out with bags and stuff. Looking forward to just being a part of the WoW community again
---
AV Korak weekend!  I can see it now
---
What aboue AOE tanking? 
---
There are not that many enrage timers, it's more like oom timers on healers
---
You are only responsible for what is enjoyable to you with the limit of not interfering with someone else. So long as everyone has fun, what difference does it make if you clear MC in 3 hours or 1?
---
Simply amazing. Thanks for the reminder of why I love this subreddit
---
You have a point, strategically speaking. As a Tank you have much more bargaining power, so you can refuse DPS warriors for that extra mail/plate drops.
---
I didn't respec prot until after UBRS as an ot back in the day. 
---
My guild asked me to respec prot for raiding. I agreed if they reserved loot for tanking for me, then I'd respec once I had some decent taking gear. 
---
I approve this message.
---
We should make some noise on this. I'm not schreeching on this one but, this is a mistake. New AV sucks it's just an annoying badge farm. If they put in 1.12.1 AV I will avoid it like the plague. Just like 90% of the player base. That being said this isn't a deal breaker for me.
---
Considering they're starting with 1.12, all of this makes sense. 
---
Isn't the point of playing Classic is to see things like Korak again?
---
Underwhelming decision.
---
&gt; Is it genuinely this surprising to hear someone care about other players?
---
You do not care about other players. You only care about yourself. If you cared about other players you would not have any issue inviting a 41 point ret who really enjoys what they do into your group.
---
Some people get so mad that they have to keep going. There's no middle ground. 
---
Thats great, i love it.  If you've got the will and sacrifice to play the most important classic role in the game -- you've got the clout to gatekeep.  respect
---
I mean, it's wow - you can probably run it on a high-end waffle maker...
---
I have this thought as well. 
---
Dispensation
---
 noun
---
an act or instance of dispensing; distribution.
---
Here is the thing about going 2H fury on alliance:  
---
1. It is pretty good, especially early in progression. You get 1 good 2H from a raid and you are probably topping meters until the dual wielders get alot more gear
---
2. Everyone knows dual wielding is optimal and takes more effort.
---
3. Every other fury warrior and even the tanks still want a 2 Hander to PvP with. They don't just want a shitty 2 hander either, they want Ashkandi/BRE, the best weapons basically.  
---
So you got a bunch of dual wielding warriors trying their best and then there is one lazy warrior who says "I wanna be the two hander guy". Now he basically gets priority on all the best 2 handers for the rest of your guild's progression. So he takes all the good PvP weapons from the warriors who are actually trying hard, basically because he is too lazy to play optimally/put the effort in to dual wield. The tanks want those PvP weapons too. 
---
You should only have to make cookies for tanks and people that you really like
---
I’m not saying that a person isn’t being a dick, I’m saying it’s a perfectly valid style of play and being dick isn’t a “wrong” way of playing the game. That style of play gave us things like Angwe, guy was a massive dickbag but it made WoW a richer, more memorable experience.
---
I work a 7/70 shift, so I’ll have every other week to devote to WoW! 
---
Yeah, I studied chemistry at university but now I work as a data analyst. One of our teachers was teaching us about persistent organic pollutants and he had to draw a lot of aromatic chemical structures on the whiteboard. A friend of mine called him Benzene Bro and so I stole the name because it sounded cool.
---
We met at university, and luckily we're both Britsh/European citizens so we don't have to deal with immigration thanks to Brexit. She's doing her PhD and I'm currently working. So now it's just a matter of coordinating moving in together when she's done. 
---
I for one am glad that it used the later iterations of Alterac Valley. AV in its inception with the days-long matches might've been fun the first time, but not the twentieth time. In the end, you're grinding for rep with AV to get those weapons/gear and people just want to get their tokens. At least, that's the way I feel about it. I hated the pve aspects of the battleground. I just want to kill other players.
---
Like a Rumba but gas powered and far more dangerous. :D
---
I don't think a casual player is going to want into a min-maxer group.
---
You can, but it really isn't effective. From my WoW experience, if the Horde actually tries to mount a serious defense, it is almost inevitably a loss due to graveyard placement. Horde's only hope of winning is an all out rush with maybe 5-10 guys on defense.
---
Shut up scrub. Sit this one out.
---
And nobody will after the first week of 'let's turtle alterac for fun' will be gone and the 'I need exalted with frostwolves' era will begin.
---
Exactly our point.
---
Schedule your vacation for September.  If classic comes out in June you'll have your vacation to farm prebis etc
---
I honestly don't understand warriors who don't at least off tank in classic. They are missing out on at least 50% of the classes kit and 90% of the classes purpose. Just level a rogue instead if you aren't gonna at least tank 5s at end game. 
---
Another one I do -- when pugging dungeons as offrole healer
---
If the group has one or two "bad"/inexcusable/worrying wipes, I'll lie to the group that I'm running out of time irl and if we wipe again I'll have to leave.  I find players tend to tighten up and play more attentively and organized after I do this lol
---
Yeah but you can probably do a 5 man dungeon with 5 tanks. 
---
&gt; you hate not being invited to their raiding groups
---
You literally made this up. 
---
absolutely insane
---
Ranged looting got me exalted in the first few days of AV, then it was kiting the horde general back to the Alliance General.
---
The quest for the paladin epic mount was amazing! Expensive, but so much fun! There were 3 others in my guild doing the quest. So the 4 of us teamed up to get the quests done, and the mount for all of us.
---
Relevant User Name.
---
Npcs I said quests. Guess I’ll stick to Alliance exclusively.
---
Well considering everyone here dislikes current wow. But mythic+ is the only reason to play retail at all. It is one of the best changes the game has ever had, and something I would enjoy a version of in classic in a dream scenario.
---
I disapprove, but I wasn't expecting to approve. Most of Blizzards decisions aren't ones I like(minus the 6 stages of content release, that one was good)
---
That's the least viable setup possible.
---
&gt; not waste any time.
---
wut. Aren't we all wasting time?
---
Someone on the forums broke down the relevant changes, in case anyone was unaware: 
---
1.8  
---
\-A great avalanche has closed off both the eastern and western segments of Alterac Valley. This has displaced the Syndicate Wildpaw Gnolls, and many of the Winterax Trolls.  
---
\-Due to the avalanche, Korrak the Bloodrager and a small band of surviving Trolls have made the Snowfall Graveyard their new home. Players will find that Snowfall is now under Korrak’s control and they must defeat Korrak and his Troll guards if they wish to take Snowfall.  
---
\-NPC difficulty has been scaled down. All NPCs have had their power reduced by 15-30%.
---
1.10  
---
\-Korrak the Bloodrager and his band of trolls have packed up their bags and left Alterac Valley for greener pastures.
---
1.11  
---
\-Most of the NPC guard units have been removed.  
---
\-Creatures that remain in Alterac Valley have had their hit points reduced.
---
Please allow a way to filter weapons that have armor. Great work!
---
i dont think people are claiming it doesnt fit, its just disappointing to have the worst version of the BG system in with no chance of having the previous versions people loved.
---
play on a roleplaying server
---
**Summarized:**
---
&gt; First and foremost, we’re planning to use the 1.12 version of Alterac Valley. For many parts of the game like this, we’re picking an original WoW patch that gives us the most clarity for WoW: Classic, and 1.12 is that patch.
---
This is sad. We‘re getting the lame 15 minute version of AV, not the epic battle the veterans of us remember and (most of us) like to look back to. 
---
Seriously this is one of the few points where I had a strong opinion and it‘s sad to see they decided for this version of AV. :/
---
Putting a marker on a party member to annoy him.
---
Its three days grace, breaking Ben, stone sour, etc for me! 
---
I'm actually taking this opportunity to edit my pretty extensive BIS list for feral to remove all of the items that won't be available in Phase 1 (like the DM weapon).
---
How long does it take to obtain all of the usual world buffs? By the time you get the last one how much has worn off of the first ones you picked up? How much effective time of buffs do you get to actually use in a raid?
---
If it comes out July 16th as per the speculation I’ll cry because I’m leaving for a music festival the next day 😒.
---
Some people want to go in 100% blind, some want to figure out what class they're going to play, some want to crunch numbers and min/max and others want to be server first on raid boss take-downs.  It's actually no different from Vanilla, different strokes for different folks.  
---
What they're doing won't directly affect what you want to do.  My GF and I know what faction and classes we want to play.  We have a rough idea of what we want to do end game (casual raids), but other than that we both intend to just enjoy playing the game together.  A bunch of guys running off to race to be the first to take down Nefarion won't affect us or our enjoyment of the game.
---
Ignore it after you get exalted you mean.
---
Tank &gt; Healer &gt; DPS in terms of how much difference a player's skill and gear will influence the difficulty of a dungeon run.
---
The only thing that'll reduce my desire to play is if it's postponed. 
---
I'll play however much I play, regardless of when it's realeased.
---
Ah I see lol.
---
That's great! Immigration is one of the worst things you can do in the first world lol. Specifically to the US anyway. Lots of paperwork, time, sweat, tears and $$. 
---
Be patient and you'll be sailing soon enough! 
---
Gnomish, get all the items, drop and relevel for goblin infinite bombs.
---
My license plate is TANKADIN. I rolled a Draeni tank for BC and that was my main for BC and WotK.
---
Looks nice. Do you have any plans for an API?
---
Playing games isn't a waste of time for me. Sad if it is for anyone else. If gaming is a waste of time for someone then they probably shouldn't be gaming.
---
Inb4 "Has Activision ABANDONED Classic?" Youtube videos.
---
No moral
---
&gt; Don't try to join a hardcore guild as a sub-optimal race/class combo and no one will tell you to reroll.
---
Why do the min maxers believe casuals will demand to join their guild?
---
Not true at all. Mythic raiding, lore as the war campaign continues, anything that has to do with Bwonsamdi. There’s a ton of things to do. Maybe just not something that people on Reddit want to do. 
---
Turtling kills your honor per hour.  There's no point in doing it outside of trolling.
---
They don’t have the data for previous iterations of AV, so I am not sure how you guys would expect them to implement it.
---
yea,  I think that's the mental exercise at hand here
---
I want to so bad, but I’m starting my first full time career in July  as I am graduating this May. I have a feeling I’m not going to get to play it as much as I could while in school :( . I don’t want to grow up guys. 
---
Let a man dream
---
I was going to offer to eat a bunch of taco bell and raw onions and hang out in your game room.
---
No korak. Shit 15min av skipping snowfall.
---
1 step forward with content phases. 1 step backwards. Yay.
---
Some people just see leveling as a means to the endgame. These are the same people that are going to be the vocal minority complaining that the time between phases is too long because they no-lifed to 60 in a couple week. I honestly hope the first phase lasts 4-6 months, giving casual players enough time to level to 60 and experience MC and Onyxia before BWL is out.
---
Paladins are kings of AoE tanking, in TBC they got even better.  I miss my BELF Protadin. :(
---
&gt; the min-maxers. They are heros
---
No. People with experience who offer advise and help to those who are new or struggling are heroes.
---
&gt; Vanilla is actually hard. You might not even make it to level 30 yet alone clear MC.
---
Lol wtf. 
---
Yeah, I understand that this *was* a version of AV in Vanilla, but most of AV's existence (iirc) in Vanilla included the player drops. Korak being removed bums me out too, but again, I see why they'd do such a thing.
---
Those days long AV's were terrible in retrospect.  At least quick AV's encourage you to queue for it.
---
Video dungeon guides on youtube will be your best resource, though I don't have any specific suggestions.
---
Can't wait to experience AV from 1.12. My only memories are from TBC and onward when Horde turtled and then over time devs made changes and the map was a pure Alliance zerg.
---
I was on the Allies, so the turtling drove me made, then when it turned into a giant zerg I just lost interest. It was so boring and predictable.
---
I loved the concept of PvPvE. I am huge on PvE but throwing another opposing faction in the mix was always an appealing idea in my mind. Can't wait to give 'er a go!
---
I don’t get what you don’t understand lol 
---
BFA was a worldwide launch, first time ever and it went relatively smooth. 
---
Time to make some noise on the forums. 
---
Summer 2019 is technically June 21st through September 20th. Personally I'm hoping for an early September release so I can spend the summer outside and then the Fall glued to my computer.

Nice. This reminds me of a light green VW bug that I saw in traffic one time with the license plate "ZUG ZUG." I think I still have the picture somewhere. Maybe if I figure out Imgur, I'll post it.
---
yeah i dont want to play anything not even a private server for classic until it comes out
---
What is a wizard? 
---
Can anyone explain this to me? I NEVER experienced this during Classic when it was retail. I thought these type of games were like, more of a quirk of Wrath than 1.12. 
---
Lol at people expecting to ever have their hour long AVs back. The only hour long AV's that occur will be because the zergs failed for both sides, everyone with a brain cell dropped, and literally no one is left in the game that is capable of finishing it off. All new players who join will leave as they realize they got the shitty AV instance.
---
Vanilla has been theorycrafted into oblivion for better or worse- the no-change crowd is hard at work to make sure the experience wouldn't be the same as it was back them (there is nothing blizzard can do to bring back shitty hour long AVs if they can't even try to make changes).
---
pointy hat, dress, magic, crits you for 834930953570 and you die
---
A small independent company like blizzard could never recreate a battleground.
---
Because he was never there in the patch that classic is being based off.
---
I couldn't take the wait anymore so I rolled a Druid on Northdale. Even though I know it's going to get bulldozed at classic release, it's 100% worth it in terms of how much fun I'm having questing, meeting passionate/hilarious people, an actual challenge and rewarding experience, a VERY healthy population, etc.
---
If you can't wait for classic I'd highly recommend playing on Northdale until then. To me, it's a great personal test to see if you're really as hyped as you think you are and help you get into the rhythm of classic. The worry of impermanence fades away so quickly once you realize you're home. You start to remember one by one all the reasons this version of the game is so legendary.
---
Enjoyment is a thing in games
---
Have you ever played with what was called a "huntard" back then ? :D
---
Yes I see the point that day-long AVs are demotivating but 15 minutes AVs are not better. AV is an epic battleground. **battle**ground. There‘s no battle when you rush to the other factions base to nuke the boss. Even AB has longer lasting games. 
---
I am totally open to any suggestion that makes this battleground not feel like a race and more like the actual epic battle it should be. 
---
Except for on weekends!
---
Yup, same here!  I actually hold myself to pretty strict min-max standards.  But I'd rather fail at content with a friendly group of people who are having fun than beat content with a group of people who treat the game like a job.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ax1hpx/maxing_bags/ehweci5/
---
Go to retail if you want that.
---
Old AV is fun one time. Once people figure it out it becomes the same 40v40 run past eachother and race to the final boss. Even when Korrak is a thing, no one ever does it. 
---
I want to experience the AV so many people claim  was the closest thing to an actual War. 
---
Heal too much, too often. Having to spam higher ranks than you would if the tanks hp isn't spikey.  You're right, the amount the heal could have done after the target was at full hp doesn't generate threat. It does waste mana and time, but that's a different issue and is more a question of how skilled the healers are. 
---
Honestly I've never wanted to abuse mod powers more in my entire life.
---
Jaw-less Undead are the best Undead.
---
&gt; WoW was ruined because Blizzard listened to complaining players.
---
&gt; 1.12 AV? Reeeeee...
---
As long as I can take a month off at launch and a month off during the AQ patch I will be happy.
---
1.12 AV is way better than early installments, I'm not alone in thinking that.
---
Game won't fail if a few toxic losers refuse to play because of sharding.  I don't want the game to fail, and I can't see how people who threaten to quit over something so ridiculously minor can claim to "love" the game.
---
Classic is happening exclusively because of those same people who actually bothered to rally for it, fuck off for flaming them for wanting it to be as good as possible
---
We're in the same boat; she's playing Rogue, I'm playing Druid.  We can gank together, I can keep her healed to reduce downtime and we should never have issues finding groups.
---
Yeah competitive guilds didn't wait on tanks to build threat...
---
All I can say is that I'm disappointed. I was hoping for the fun version of Alterac Valley.
---
I was initially disappointed when I read the update. I really enjoyed the hours to days long AVs. Reading through the replies on the official forum suggests this is a common sentiment--lots of disappointment.
---
Seems to me older versions of AV are far more popular and highly requested, so I can only assume the reason they went with 1.12 on this one is because they don't have enough data to recreate other versions.
---
It'll still be fun, I've always enjoyed AV, even the wham bam thank you ma'am zergfest it was when I quit in WoD. I'm just disappointed that it won't be the version most people--including a lot of those who missed out on it--want to see.
---
Horrible decision. Old school AV is one of the main selling points of Classic.  
---
"Let's do the Alterac Valley that is pretty much the same as in retail, because people want to play Classic to have the same experience as in retail"  
---
What are they even talking about with turning in armor scraps? It's totally pointless when 90% of the NPC's are removed.
---
I feel you could argue that they should start at the absolute earliest version then. They have to start someone and adding Korak only to remove him after would seem somewhat jarring. 
---
lol the fuck kinda radio stations you have? that's cool.
---
I get why people who only want the rewards see it that way,  but I liked the gameplay of early AV. I'd do it for 0 rewards, not even honor points. That's why I'm a bit sad about this decision. It will mean one less thing that might keep me playing long term. I could get sucked into other things (World PvP, old dungeons) but AV will be less appealing to me to play for fun. 
---
I was on a pserver over the weekend. Got caught up in a questing group with 2 warriors. I wasn't even on those quests but the grind XP was too good to pass up. It was funny how their playstyle changed once a holy priest joined the group. They quickly went from calculated methodical pulls to a tidal wave rampage attacking anything they could see. If I managed to pull a mob with heal threat they both charged over to decimate it! Never spoke a word in party chat.
---
Boy do I love grouping with warriors!
---
&gt;  You must control each character individually/no input can be sent to multiple windows as per current EULA
---
I don't think you've read the EULA.
---
From blizzard themselves:
---
&gt;The simultaneous use of multiple game clients and multiple accounts by the account holder of said accounts is fully allowed within the game Terms of Use as long as no actual automation is taking place (i.e. as long as one keypress only initiates one action per client).
---
Im fine with this. 
---
Unfortunate 
---
&gt; Confirmed how? You can play defense.
---
No one does this, even on the Private Servers that have the OLD AV with the ridiculous elites, people still run up the side of the map to the other base and race the bosses down.
---
Im serious, go check them out, half of it is the developers, but half of the problem is the players....
---
This is a great resource. Thank you!
---
Oh boy, I can not wait to be stalled indefinitely on that bridge which serves as the Alliances single defensible choke point of entry, while they get to just storm across open plains to our keep with ease.
---
Good as possible is subjective. You probably don't/won't ever realize that so this conversation is ending here.
---
Hour long? Try days long.
---
Lmao - I just realized your a mod here. I’m still using your leveling videos as a reference - keep up the good work :)
---
It’s so absolutely not subjective. Get the fuck out of here
---
Yep, if you have a healer on warrior life is a breeze! You can go absolutely wild. However, solo, without those heals, you’re right. Every pull is calculated and pulling more than one mob is almost certain death until you’re level 20-25. 
---
I think you took an extreme take there with "extreme guess." They may not have exactly preserved data for old AV versions, but they can do better than guess I'm sure. I don't need something that is preserved down to the decimal point, I just want the experience to be recreated. That experience includes the old NPC numbers and the trolls at the GY. 
---
I play a dwarf paladin I kill lowbie hunter pets and then spam sit and fuck their pets. Specifically turtles.
---
I think people waiting 15 years for vanilla wow could probably wait a couple of months lmfao
---
I love this pedantic response to anything people disagree with.  Way to contribute to the conversation.
---
Well, remove tons of obstacles, objectives and streamline the map and it is bound to be easier to bypass each other.
---
You just contradicted yourself.  1.12 is not a killing other players version of AV.  It's rush towers, rush base, kill boss, leave.
---
Yeah, lol, AV was one of the strong points for me to sub to Classic, now...
---
I want AV battles, not a races for the bases. We will have WSG for that. 
---
15 minute AV games result from a combination of a player mentality shift and dramatically fewer and weaker NPC enemies blocking enemy progress which makes defending harder. Nowadays the meta for people who just want to hit exalted for the rep rewards or maximize their honor is to ignore the enemy faction and rush to the final objective of killing the enemy faction raid boss.

Female Gnome Rogue.  I like the idea of huge burst damage coming from arguably the tiniest toon in the game.
---
While I don't quite have that level of luxury as a healer, my goal is to get on tank FL with my superior healing skills so those that finish their coffee and are ready to do a dungeon can contact me and then take his pick of which 3 dps classes he wants from trade chat.
---
As mush as I want to take a lot of time off I doubt I will. I can maybe manage a day or 2 depending on when the release day is in the week. 
---
My thoughts of leveling speed for #noliving, is as follows: 
---
Joana set the World Record during real vanilla something like 4.5 days /played. Assuming new routes have been made/polished up, lets assume the 100% fastest is 4 days played. Most people aren't going to hit that, lets assume the "average" no lifer is doing 60 in 5.5 days played. That gets us 132 hours needed. play for 18 hours and sleep for 6 gets us 7.3 days IRL to hit 60. Or if sleeping for 8 and playing 16 gets us 8.25 days in real time
---
I guess if somebody takes a week off it's just about possible to lvl to 60 in a week
---
Though I cannot stress enough most people are not going to be hitting these kinds of numbers at all.
---
I figure I will hit 60 in about 10 days /played assuming I don't get too distracted while leveling up. I can on average put maybe 30 hours a week into classic, some weeks more some weeks less. That will get me to 60 in 8 weeks or about 2 months. I think this is a nice spot to be in. By the time I hit 60 there should be enough others at 60 to run dungeons with
---
:(
---
Maybe it changes with later itemization, but in a 5 man / MC scenario there's no way a war tank starting a fight with 0 rage  can reliably build enough threat to maintain agro if the DPS are giving everything instantly.
---
Even if you charge and or take a rage pot it's very easy for the DPS to take back agro.
---
Bummer, but man do I love these weekly updates.
---
Grandma is raid leader
---

---
Right, im just confused why I never saw that behavior in 2006.
---
I keep my pisswizards next to my poopsocks.
---
&gt; I am totally open to any suggestion that makes this battleground not feel like a race and more like the actual epic battle it should be
---
Unfortunately they'd have to really overhaul AV to find a better balance.  After nerfing NPC's people figured out that the honor per hour was optimized by only putting a few people on defense and rushing the towers/bosses.
---
The honor gained from farming kills just doesn't compare.  And if they redid the honor formula in AV this sub would freak out over changes.  It's a lose/lose for Blizzard.
---
No no, Blizzard should listen to ME! Its the other players who have shitty ideas.
---
Off topic I guess, but is there any information lurking out there about historically what the population breakdown of the factions and the available race / class combinations was over the life span of vanilla?
---
you can kill ppl on the way to the base tho
---
Nice progress, keep pursuing your goal! You might also consider getting a treadmill-computer setup, for a sustained brisk walk while playing, if you find OP's fitness plan unsatisfactory
---
aggg you got me
---
Sekiro is gonna fix that for me :)
---
Yeah those exalted pieces are pretty amazing
---
:( I hope you're wrong. But I fear that it's possible that you're not wrong! :S
---
WoW: Classic is still the 1.12 experience, for better and worse. It is unfortunate that Blizzard does not want the 2004/2005 WoW to live again, though I suppose 2006 WoW is a fine, if not ideal, substitute.

"If you don't want my vision of classic then go play retail" is a shit argument.
---
The requirements of having LITERALLY EVERY BUFF IN THE GAME for a shaman to be a half decent raid tank should be an immediate red flag, for specifically leaving this all in theory because no sane human would try this in game come classic without being exceedingly bored.
---
Dude mad respect ! Just leveling as prot is something but on a PVP server ? Wow !
---
Which is the version that would only pop once a week and last like 2-3 days? That’s the one I remember haha.
---
&gt; Considering they're starting with 1.12, all of this makes sense.
---
I keep forgetting that they only have the 1.12 data right? So this is kind of forced? No wonder they have to do the progressive itemization and stuff by hand. Geez.
---
I agree, but there's definitely no way they're going to please everyone. This seems like a good compromise to me.
---
Everyone fking hated long AVs, it was epic the first time, after that it was not enjoyable.
---
It’s a perfect contribution, not their problem that it went over your head
---
The point of Classic is to be way different than retail. Why try to make that less so
---
&gt;It's gonna take longer to remake a game they have all the assets for than it took them to make it in the first place
---
I wouldn't be surprised if there are some people who want things like turtling to be considered griefing, and thus a reportable offence.
---
What's your point?  The way AV is designed discourages playing defense.  Most people are in AV for honor/rep, not to sit around farming kills for inefficient honor per hour.
---
I was just trying to put this guy's mind at ease. No one will tell him to re-roll. I never mentioned anything about casuals demanding things and I'm not sure where you got that from. Some casuals might humbly apply to these guilds though and they should expect to have their application nitpicked over.
---
I have a Cubi pro. It's like an elliptical that goes under your desk. I don't use it like a tread mill though. I just periodically go nuts on it when my legs feel restless. I am a much bigger fan of throwing around heavy weights over cardio. At my size I got plenty of room to pack on muscle and every pound of muscles burns 70 calaroos a day. So build 10 pounds and you get to be lazy about burning 700 calories lol. I work to work less lol.
---
When I first started playing wow back in HS I remember playing in the mornings for maybe 10-30 minutes. 
---
My best memory of this was the day I entered 1k Needles. I took this giant lift down to a new and exciting area. I ran among these massive pillars of stone, following a path to an outpost unknown. I finally make a right hand turn following the trusty signs pointing me towards my goal, and take a winding path up one of the many plateaus I was just walking beneath. I crossed several roap bridges to my goal. And what do I find, a lift down, right around the corner from where I walked off the trail, after trusting a sign. 
---
I will always remember that morning, and every time I am in 1k needles I think of that first trip in
---
It may have been in vanilla, but it was just at the tail-end. I like the idea of a battle lasting the length of a battle, and not a tiny skirmish.
---
Sounds good. Just bring the Taco Bell with you. ;D
---
This makes me imagine a meme with a big daddy and a little sister as the warrior and priest. That's at least how it feels from the priest perspective. 
---
Smash him Mr. Bubbles!
---
I feel like they're good for raiding, but unless there's pally or spriest they aren't great for 5 mans due to no reliable res.
---
Copy pasta from wow wiki

AV v1.5.0
---
Enemy NPC lieutenants and commanders now have a team bonus honor value.
---
Enemy NPC lieutenants and commanders no longer respawn.
---
Enemy towers are now destroyed rather than captured (a one-time event per tower). The mechanics for destroying a tower are very similar to their previous capture mechanic.
---
The enemy NPC mine layer no longer respawns when killed.
---
The respawn time for laying mines has been slowed.
---
All Alterac Valley quest items (ie: armor scraps) are zone-bound, and will be lost if taken outside the battleground instance.
---
Korrak’s respawn time has been increased to 30 minutes.
---
NPC’s in the entrance tunnels will no longer fight enemy NPCs, only enemy players.
---
Lok’holar the ice lord and Ivus the forest lord are now friendly to Horde and Alliance players (respectively), and will therefore no longer affect friendly players with area-of-effect spells.
---
Sound effects have been added to critical battleground events (ie: a graveyard being assaulted).
---
Additional items for purchasing have been added to the quartermasters in the entrance tunnels. The types of items you may purchase is based on your reputation with the quartermaster.
---
The Alliance and Horde NPC captains now periodically shout a “rallying cry”, granting a powerful effect to all friendly players in the battleground. Killing the enemy’s captain will deny the ability for the enemy to gain a rallying cry.
---
Ivus the Forest Lord now uses a winter Ancient Protector model rather than a Keeper of the Grove model
---
AV v1.6.0
---
Each team will now gain additional bonus honor if their towers are not destroyed by the end of the map. The more towers that remained intact, the more honor received.
---
If you manage to keep your faction’s Captain alive for the duration of a battle, you will be granted extra points upon victory.
---
Several Alterac Valley vendor items are now bind on acquire.
---
The respawn time for tower guards (assuming the tower has not been destroyed) has been greatly increased.
---
Korrak the Bloodrager has gained immunities to many different spell and ability effects.
---
The minimum reputation needed to send a cavalry charge has been reduced to Honored.
---
Players of Revered or higher reputation may now call offensive air strikes if they have managed to rescue their respective Wing Commanders.
---
Alterac Valley’s guard spawn is now controlled via a more intuitive mechanism. Please check the Officer Supply vendors for your faction to read up on the changes.
---
Fixed a bug that sometimes prevented the Alliance team from receiving honor for destroying towers.
---
Fixed a bug that was not awarding Horde credit for owning a mine at the end of a game.
---
AV 1.7.0 (general BG changes)
---
Battleground “holidays” have been added to Warsong Gulch, Alterac Valley and Arathi Basin. Holidays occur during most weekends, starting on Thursday night at midnight and continuing until Tuesday morning. During a holiday, emissaries from that Battleground will be found in the major cities, and honor/faction rewards for performing objectives in that battleground are increased.
---
Alterac Valley now correctly rewards honor for owning graveyards at the end of the game.
---
Fixed a bug that would cause players to stand up when a turnin was made in Alterac Valley.
---
Players will no longer be able to gain health by repeatedly entering and leaving the effect of a Battle Standard.
---
Entering a battleground now resets the timer for the AFK flag. This should prevent players being kicked by the AFK timer moments after they enter the Battleground instance.
---
BGs in general v 1.8.0:
---
Each Battleground has an individual turn-in quest associated with its related victory/loss condition. Upon completion of a Battleground, the winning side will be awarded three Marks of Honor while the losing side will be awarded one Mark of Honor. Three Marks of Honor may be turned in to the associated questgiver for Honor points and faction increase. Should players complete this turn-in quest, they will find that the bonus Honor Points for completion are twice that of normal turn-in conditions (individual).
---
AV v1.8.0:
---
In order to keep teams in Alterac Valley more numerically balanced, players will now enter Alterac Valley on a one-for-one basis (i.e. if there are 30 players in the battleground for each side with 10 players in the Alliance queue and 2 players in the Horde queue, only two players from each team will be added, bringing the total to 32 per side).
---
The minimum number of players required to start a battle in Alterac Valley has been lowered to 20 (the maximum is still 40).
---
Points for completing the map and winning have been slightly decreased.
---
Graveyards and graveyard capture points are now at different locations. The banners players must interact with in order to capture a graveyard have been distanced from each other somewhat in order to alleviate “graveyard zerging” and make graveyards more meaningful to both defense and offense.
---
Several terrain changes were made to fix some geometry exploits as well as to adjust for the new graveyard mechanic.
---
Iceblood Graveyard has been fortified.
---
The Frostwolf Relief Hut now has appropriate guards.
---
A great avalanche has closed off both the eastern and western segments of Alterac Valley. This has displaced the Syndicate, the Wildpaw Gnolls, and many of the Winterax Trolls.
---
Due to the avalanche, Korrak the Bloodrager and a small band of surviving Trolls have made the Snowfall Graveyard their new home. Players will find that Snowfall is now under Korrak’s control and they must defeat Korrak and his Troll guards if they wish to take Snowfall.
---
The quests Korrak the Bloodrager (Alliance), Korrak the Everliving (Alliance), The Legend of Korrak (Horde), and The Return of Korrak (Horde) have been removed from the game. The rewards for the initial quest involving Korrak have been moved and can be acquired by completing the quest associated with winning a match in Alterac Valley. We realize that some players may have had the Korrak quest and never completed it. These players may have already completed the quest for killing the General and thus might not be able to benefit from the rewards from the previous quest line. We have opted to add an extra quest step at the end of the General kill quests to reward players that fall under such conditions.
---
A new item has been added as one of the reward choices for the quests Hero of the Stormpike and Hero of the Frostwolf.
---
NPC difficulty has been scaled down. All NPCs have had their power reduced by 15-30%.
---
There is now a portcullis at the end of each of the entrance tunnels inside Alterac Valley. They will rise two minutes into the battle.
---
AV v1.9.0
---
No specific changes listed
---
AV v1.9.3
---
The default graveyards in Alterac Valley for each side were moved further up the tunnels away from the battleground exit. This should prevent accidentally leaving the battleground.
---
AV v1.10.0
---
Flavor items from player loot in Alterac Valley will now stack and can be sold for a small value. These are items like Documents from Boomstick Imports, Worn Running Shoes, etc.
---
Players in Alterac Valley will no longer drop Darkspear Troll Mojo, Dwarf Spines, Forsaken Hearts, Human Bone Chips, Orc Teeth, etc. and the quests have been removed for these items. Instead when a player is slain in Alterac Valley, any enemies that were in that player’s threat list will gain 1 point of reputation with either the Frostwolf or Stormpike factions.
---
Frostwolf and Stormpike faction will now be gained by killing players of the opposite faction. Reputation will no longer be split up among the entire raid group.
---
Tower Banners in Alterac Valley can no longer be used through walls.
---
Korrak the Bloodrager and his band of trolls have packed up their bags and left Alterac Valley for greener pastures.
---
AV v1.11.0
---
Most of the NPC guard units have been removed.
---
Players now drop more quest items.
---
Creatures that remain in Alterac Valley have had their hit points reduced.
---
The buff that is periodically cast by each faction’s Captain has been changed to a flat 20% hit point buff.
---
Upgrading troops through armor scrap turn-ins will also now result in your team’s General enabling a periodic buff to your melee and spell damage. This buff scales from 10% at the Seasoned unit level, 20% at the Veteran unit level, and 30% at the Champion unit level.
---
AV v1.12.0
---
When you join a battleground, you are automatically added to a raid group. You MAY NOT leave that group. To speak in this raid, use /bg instead of /ra.
---
Leadership of the battleground raid is granted to whomever has the highest PvP rank when the raid is formed (approximately 1 minute before the battleground starts).
---
&gt;Like many aspects of the game, Alterac Valley was tuned and adjusted in different ways from patch to patch in 2005-2006.
---
&gt;First and foremost, we’re planning to use the 1.12 version of Alterac Valley. For many parts of the game like this, we’re picking an original WoW patch that gives us the most clarity for WoW: Classic, and 1.12 is that patch.
---
I’m reading “We don’t have the 1.5 data. Sorry.” Anyone else seeing that? 
---
Get an appropriate baby carrier and a large exercise ball. Your wife will love you for giving her a break and your baby will sleep for hours. If the exercise ball just so happens to replace your computer chair I don't think anyone will notice. 
---
&gt; The point of Classic is to be way different than retail
---
Except the "faster" version of AV was in Classic sooo.....
---
You claimed there was no point out side of trolling.
---
You are mistaken, defensive wars in AV are fun and have a strong RO aspect which is quite important.
---
Whether they happen or not is irrelevant to the point you made
---
Most vanilla players seem to prefer the old AV.
---
Wait, what?
---
But it won't actually happen.
---
rip :(
---
want a later release?
---
I cant say I really want to spend days doing AV anyway.
---
Good change for me.
---
slot:'main hand' is:green weapon-subtype:axe
---
I get nothing, what I'm doing wrong ?
---
Can we choose by level too or is it only high lvll 60+ items ?
---
how come a lot of updates says they got updated but are exactly the same?
---
like Gloves of Holy Might, says they updated in 1.5 but nothing changed
---
also nothing has extraattacks?  
---
truth stings sometimes
---
Games would last days at a time, it would have to be longer than a weekend. 
---
&gt; defensive wars in AV are fun and have a strong RO aspect which is quite important
---
This is completely subjective.  I personally hate it when games turn into a turtlefest since it's a giant waste of time.  If you want to kill people play WSG or AB.
---
Have you never played Bioshock? 
---
Ugh this post sums up my entire thoughts about classic 
---
5 we 931
---
Mv
---
Yes I do want that, if you want fast action AB and WSG is for you. AV’s draw was the epic war of attrition grind fest
---
Yeah I don’t have an opinion on that, I just wanted to point out what was said. Everyone thinks their way is the best and any other way is bad..
---
The devs have some hard decisions to make but i’m keen for classic.
---
This sucks extra hard when turning in the quest the first time netted a pretty significant xp reward. Was part of my strategy to get past the last few levels of 50 quickly.
---
Not a raid leader - but I don't expect my RL to give them anything.
---
Their incentive will be the fact that they will be in high demand for a spot in the raid. They will have less competition than DPS trying to acquire a spot.
---
It's a good versatile set for both Cats &amp; Bears. I like it because it's decent for tanking, and I don't have to carry around extra chest+legs for when I want to go cat dps. I like stuff I can use in both roles because it saves bag space.
---
I suppose Rogues could use this set as well, until they find something else.
---
I was really hoping for either the 1.8 version or pre-1.8 of AV
---
Bear tank is the best dungeon tank in my opinion (and a lot of others'), and at worst on par with warrior. So go for it! 
---
Tell me one area moonkin is viable? Enh Shaman is a slot machine joke that only works in PVP 1v1 and is retarded strong for 3% of encounters and a wet noodle the rest. So is Reckbomb Paladin, which isn't even a Ret spec.
---
It's more like trying to haul a 5th wheel with an anchor or parallel park a statue to get them to work in any capacity of the game.
---
First off, the only objectively "worst" pvp class (I speak in terms of wpvp since that's the most fun *for me*) is paladin, as in 1v1 in the world, they really are just walking auto attackers with a 6 second stun and a bubble hearth. In group combat, whole different story. For my examples, we gunna be talking about wpvp, 1v1 or 1v2...
---
Shaman and Druids both have decently high skill caps, with Druids having possibly the highest alongside Warlocks (anyone have different input here?). As a Shaman, to do your best, you'll really want to be a mix of Elem / Resto for instant Chain Lightnings and less dependency on gear / consumables. Enhancement has the pitfall of relying heavily on swing-timers and lucky WF procs to do any considerable / consistent burst. Though, even an enhancement with near 0 spell power can do a lot of burst with fire nova + stormstrike + earthshock, at the expense of about 20-30% of their entire mana pool... so now you see the issue with Enh, low, low mana efficiency and reliance. You'll be pretty fairly matched against any classes but being kited and lacking CC is the Shaman's pitfall, a good frost mage, Affliction Warlock, or hunter can get the jump on a shaman and dance circles around them while kiting. If you get the jump, not so much.
---
Druids on the other hand do exceptionally well vs most classes in the wPvP scene and can choose many more fights to their liking- escaping and resetting with travel / cat form stealth. Druids also have some soft cc in the form of entangling roots to allow for more 1v2 scenarios to go in their favor. I plan on going Druid or Shadow Priest, still not sure which, mainly because as a Druid, I will have better control over my mana pool compared to a Shaman (which really needs a much better gear level, close to endgame, to feel comfortable in long fights and multiple engagements). But, don't be confused, a 1h + shield Elem Shaman in some AQ pieces is an absolute beast, can self heal like crazy, purge buffs / shields, has 3 shocks all that are useful, a perma slow, and a fast travel form. They're very resilient.
---
Druids can do most of that as well, going 28/11/11 or 29/0/21 are both very viable specs for wpvp and allows you to pull off great damage through insect swarm, starfire, and wraths when able to hardcast, as well as pop in for bear form stuns and charges if you go 11/11 route. 
---
I'm not. I'll be just getting cleared from back surgery to return too work early June. So all summer my fitness and work life have too come first. 
---
I have a feeling that if classic WoW does in fact attract a good amount of players outside of the private realm crowd (new players, players who are returning but never played private servers, or others) then we will probably see longer battles in AV and less of this hyper optimized bypass for honor farming.
---
And so was the older and better version.
---
I did a lot of reading on this recently. And the short version is bear tanks do great. They can rock most 5 man's, and can even tank in raids. Although you DO have to work hard to get the gear/spec/and consumables to tank raids. But there are some boss fights where druids are preferred over warrior. (All though not many, and not until mid-late patch release) Plus bears have much higher threat generation than warriors, so DPS doesn't have to worry about threat as much. So if you want to druid, and tank...do it!
---
Onyxia does not need 30+ to do. If your dps get songflower and know how to use their cool downs appropriately it can be done with 20-25 pre-raid BiS players. Prepopping fire protection helps but the real killer of onyxia is the deep breath. Deep breath can happen in phase 2 but only about 20 seconds in. Phase 2 starts at 66% and ends at 40%. This means you have 20 seconds to do 26% damage. You need to have everyone pop their CD during this time and healers help dps also. If you don’t get a deep breath in p2 then the fight is significantly easier.
---
Yes, I really want that. Go figure
---
Nope. I live alone for the time being. Due to financial reasons my wife and I are living about 2 hours away from each other for a year or 2. So I have all the free time in the world during the week. Classic can drop at any time and I will be just as excited and ready to play
---
We never gave incentives to hybrids. They filled the roll we needed or we got a different person in the raid. It wasn't to be a jerk to the hybrids, but we needed what we needed and I'm not sure what else you can say about it. In general, we did try to get them in as an offtank or DPS or whatever when possible, but more often than not, we needed healers.
---
What a beautiful strawman you've made for me, have I ever done anything remotely close to that?
---
Orc Hunter.
---
Hunter because I have never played one before, and my friends have me sold on the utility side of the class; which is why I always end up playing Paladin if I'm left to my own devices. Orc because I'm getting off to the thought of being on the other side of resisting a HoJ. I also plan to farm an Arcanite Reaper early and use it for a long time, so that'll be a nice little axe bonus + orc style point combo.
---
Gotta get that Unstoppable Force. 
---
US - Either Faction - Warrior/Rogue/Priest (still deciding)
---
Looking for a guild for Classic in the "Serious but not Hardcore" range that will be raiding in the 8PM-1AM Central Time range. Looking to take a week off for launch and play the game hard but not take everything over the top. I want to clear all raid content as I never had the chance to play Vanilla back in the day. I've raided Cata - Legion with experience as an officer and leveled to 60 on a private server. Most importantly, I want to play with friends and be a part of a group working together. Please message me if you have something matching this!
---
1.8 - what a time to be alive.
---
Nah that's where people who don't like long BGs should go instead of dumbing down AV.
---
RIP hunter xbow RIP wand of biting cold.
---
This is the strangest take I've ever seen regarding hybrids. First you assume that none want to heal. Then you say they're deserving of something extra just for showing up with a proper raid spec. You know what they're getting in return? A fucking raid spot. This is coming from someone who's maining either a resto shaman or holy paladin. Quit your whinging.
---
I will probably suffer a heart attack xD
---
Ahh, a long time ago and never played far enough in to get to any Big Daddies. 
---
Out of context I was confused
---
It didn't happen much back in the day, if at all, but it's the sort of thing that happens when a game gets analyzed as thoroughly as Vanilla has been for well over a decade. 
---
Gamers care much more about making the absolute most out of everything they can these days, whether it's min-maxing stats, party or raid compositions, or finding the quickest path through a dungeon or raid, nothing goes to waste anymore. Everybody cares about these sort of things these days, where as back then it was only the top players.
---
The private server experience is already very different from what it was in retail Vanilla because of this shift in mentality (and more), and obviously the same will be true of Classic.
---
The only AV version I can fondly recollect from 2005-2006 is the one prior to the 1.8 avalanche with the all-seeing eye, shredder, free grouping etc. After that the memories just seem to blur together.
---
That's a pity. More wipes, more gratification from kill.
---
Druid is different for pvp, you don't heal, you run flags. Priest is the better healer otherwise. 
---
Except not everyone hates those. How is a 15 minutes honor farm run better?
---
As I said: I am open to suggestions that make AV a **battle**ground again. 
---
I think it shifted this way because the slight majority of people *did* care about hitting exalted, as most should- it offers excellent rewards. And because *not* doing AV's in this manner meant a single game could last a few hours, up to *days*. By shifting from one extreme to the next, you just mitigate RNG and say, ok, here's what we're here for, let's just gun it for that.
---
I'm 30, and i logged on before work this morning to make sure i was an Inn (for that rested XP) before i set off. So i can go home and get those levels :)
---
I knew they'd find some way to fuck it up after getting us all excited with that revised timeline announcement. It was too good to be true.
---
"We heard you like a challenge, so we're giving you the gutted, post-nerf version of AV!"
---
My girlfriend expects me to do things with her in the summer like travel, visit family and stuff. I'm fine with that but I actually hope classic will be delayed until after that. 
---
Since I don't really plan to raid much...if at all, I decided to go with the class fantasy I liked the most. So I'm play Paladin! I've always preferred the hybrid classes, hybrid tax or not. And the class fantasy for paladins in classic is too good. It's a lot of fun for me! I'm not worried about gear, lol at best I'll probably just have the dungeon sets.
---
The amount of time i had this Video open with Wow open at the same time trying to learn how to explore. Figured out wall riding back in 05 and used the left rocks near Orgrimmar entrance to scale to the top of Orgrimmar. Good times
---
You are in for a shock if you try to join a raiding guild as a hybrid with this kind of entitlement.
---
I think that a good healer can elevate the group better than a good tank, but a bad tank can hurt the group worse than a bad healer.
---
This is with the exception of any player who actively sabotages the group (whether on purpose or accident) by pulling extra mobs, breaking CC, etc.
---
Can mage iceblock be used as an agro reset if your pew pewing too hard?
---
"You get to raid" is not a great offer when the other raid says "raid with us and we will give you X"
---
You can get away with having your voidwalker tank in lower level dungeons with a proper group (CC, other durable classes or other pet classes) that helps mitigate the lack of threat and true tankiness. 
---
I've definitely tanked or had players tank low level instances with a pet. Not optimal though, but fun.
---
Give me the nipple.
---
I actually do not mind. For me, AV is only a means to get the gear. It is by far the most boring battleground in classic. I just want my Unstoppable Force for my Enh set and that's it. Furthermore, Horde can force a turtle if they really want to, just have to wipe Alliance at Galv and control the bunkers nearby. You can still have the epic battles of the past, you just need to be proactive a bit. 
---
&gt; Do you really struggle to understand that people have different goals / ideas of what they find fun?
---
I do not, but when two people set the same goal, I assume that for a moment they share that goal.
---
Imo it is fine. I love pvp and BGs in vanilla, but AV is just a snoozefest, especially old AV. It is little pvp and basically just pve. Making it 1.12 makes AV much shorter for the rep grind and makes more pve players queue AV in terms of fast rep etc.
---
you are in for a shock if you expect to have a raid with hybrids who want to be there come 60
---
If they genuinely do not want to play optimally for their class and ask for special treatment to do so I will give them the boot. Coordinating 40 people is hard enough without people trying to extort the rest of the guild.
---
Reckbomb is a meme that probably won't even work on Private Servers, but a Reckoning Paladin certainly has a place in solo and PvP.
---
Moonkin and Enhancement have their place as hybrid specs.
---
Sadly, most of this cool stuff will not be possible due to wall walking being killed in Cata(?)/
---
It will be funny when you guys realize hes right.
---
If you took all that time, planing and analytical mind and spent it in the real world you could probably become rich irl instead of in a game where nobody cares how much gold you have and where most will hate you.
---
who can resist such a sexy hammer? almost as erotic as that vomit-green epic shield!
---
I assumed it was ubiquitous enough that I could mention it without context.
---
Big Daddys in the game are heavily armored and will smash the shit out of anything. They protect the little girls who harvest the blue goo out of corpses. There is a cut scene early in the game where a splicer finds a little sister alone. When he tries to attack her a big daddy comes in, smashes his skull against the wall 3 times, then throws the corpse through a plate glass window. 
---
Best part is, i know this isn't nostalgia like everyones loves to tell me. I've been playing on a private server for the first time in ages recently, got a group together for Deadmines, just a bunch of randoms. My god it was fun, stopping to talk about which mobs to CC, wiping, one guy not finding the entrance, so we had a guy walk all the way back through just to guide him. We wiped so much, took  us 3 hours, but we did it. At the end we all added each other as friends and it's just fucking awesome. God i love this game.
---
It was not a factual comment, the post was poorly worded. It was literally not well said. 
---
Hard agree. We should really ask Blizz to reconsider. We have 2 BGs for nice quick matches as is, let's let AV stay epic.
---
We already knew BG's weren't in phase 1 - it wouldn't have been an option either way unless you planned on leviling very slowly.
---
Warrior gnome, I totally understand. 
---
There is no iron chin in Vanilla.
---
Dude. AI or PW:F costs like 30% of mana. A Blessing is basically free. If you follow me around and bless me for half an hour, I'll give you AI :P
---
Once I know I'm flying to a major city, I'll walk away from my computer for 8 hours so long as I turn off the monitor and speakers.
---
Yeah, get the fuck out of here...chicken little
---
Great point, I agree completely. To be honest I was kind of mailing it in at that point. You're right, Undead for sure. 
---
Why cant they do AV as they do raid content? Just have classic AV in the beginning, and then come with the updated one when it would make sense with the other released.
---
If I can afford to take 3-4 months off to playing a game, I'm definitely not doing poorly irl.
---
There is a super easy solution to all of this, just play with people you want to play with. I personally have no plans to play with people who are playing extremely suboptimally for basically no reason.
---
As a career support player I have found my spirit animal.  I do this frequently in any game I play as support.
---
hahaha
---
Haha, ah the ol RAWR-bomb, yeah I've tried that a few times. You gotta get the timing just right. :) 
---
Better is completely subjective
---
Uhhh...what? If you're playing Ret without Conviction and Vengeance, you're doing it very very wrong.
---
Awful change. You can play your AV on retail. People who enjoyed the better version are just fucked.
---
Correct answer.
---
I am an asshole, a tryhard minmaxing asshole. I have dealt with willfully ignorant people to the point it broke me and now I have no filter or patience with them. 0.
---
I think if you show up to a group uninformed about your class build and the groups intended content, you are inflicting your willful ignorance and stupidity upon others, which makes you the asshole.
---
But I'm aware that this point of view also makes me an asshole, I've just accepted it because I believe the affore paragraph from the bottom of my heart.
---
But those people are assholes too. You are either an asshole that refuses to suffer an idiot or you are an asshole for inflicting your idiocy upon others. So in the end everyone here is an asshole I guess...
---
My first character ever was a NE warrior. it took forever to get to level 10 but I was finally ready to leave tedrassil. I looked at the world map and concluded that I would have to jump off the high branches into the ocean and swim to the mainland (I hadn't noticed the coastal village or portal in darnassus). I also decided that I wanted to go to the eastern kingdoms next instead of to darkshore, so I figured I would have to jump off the western side of tedrassil and swim off the west side of the map to loop around to the east side. Then I learned what the word "fatigue" meant. Playing in 5th grade was great for my vocabulary
---
Also, some nurses/health professionals have to request off 6-12 months in advance.  Can't imagine being that organized, working in Tech I pretty much need to give 3 days 
---
My mistake, it's been so long I kind of blurred those two together. 
---
Absolutely, if it means old AV
---
This is great, thanks!
---
Can someone clarify the blue post about their proposed change to what gear will be available at launch?  My understanding is that gear is going to be available when it was during classic, but it'll have the 1.10 version of the stats, is this correct?  I'm trying to put together a list of BiS pre-raid gear for a mage.
---
&gt; Good for you but that has nothing to do with this comment chain
---
I didn’t think I had to draw the obvious connection for you, but I’ve been wrong before, so here it is:
---
Your comment implied that raiding in order to clear Naxx is the ultimate goal for myself and people like myself, and I pointed out to you that it isn’t - the ultimate goal is to have fun playing and get as far as I can doing it the fun way. 
---
And just in case you can’t draw the conclusion from this comment as well - my point is that your comment is of no consequence, because people like me do not care if we can’t clear Naxx as long as we have fun. If we run into issues and see that we can’t get things done, we’ll find another way or do something other than raiding - PvP is more fun anyway, raids are just to get gear to PvP 😋
---
Unless you level really slowly, pvp rewards and bgs won't be available during phase 1 regardless. 
---
I mean....yes? This is one of those things where, just because you can doesn't mean you should. I mean, you CAN drive with your feet, but you should use your hands...
---
&gt; To be honest, gameplay-wise, casting nukes was far more fun than playing a poor man’s Rogue.
---
I agree with this bit at least, I did enjoy boomkin for that reason. 
---
So... I interpreted the announcement as item availability was going to be progressive, not their stats. All items will be in the 1.12 form but items not available in previous patches wont be available until their content is released.
---
And a lot of people don't.  AV was changed because of the very real issues the BG had upon release.
---
To each their own :P 
---
Before I went support I played a gnome mage and it has always my alt toon through wow.  I'm thinking I'm going to drop support (resto druid) simply because resto in classic doesn't sound like my jam and go full on mage.  The utility of mage really draws me in.
---
Yeah, I was aiming for no duplicates, but you're right that it's more of a dwarf thing than anything.
---
That is the incentive. Hunters, rogues, warriors, etc. will be fighting for their spot. Resto druids (like myself) would have an easier chance for just applying - even if it's used as a filler spot.
---
You also assume that guilds will not be using DKP in order to distribute loot. Most will not do loot council.
---
Also...another poster just said some hybrids would prefer to heal
---
ITT: My opinion is more valid/important than yours.
---
Also removes one of the Incentives "to kill other players" and the desire for lower level players to join up in the mid-50's for that XP gain from the quest turn-ins... pretty sad. Having players from 51-60 running around there was sort of a neat unique part of it, sort of an extension of World PvP into the BG - at least when people fight one another.
---
I was hoping to finally see a return of the Gnomish Shredding Machines and at the very least I felt Korak was a given to be in there ... to know all the upcoming "WoW Classic" won't see those things or be able to loot a Night Elf Head, etc, is kind of a let-down.
---
Haha, I was wondering if anyone would catch that.
---
You can be one of those cool teachers who lets the kids watch movies in class but instead of being hungover, you'll be playing WoW on your laptop. :D
---
It is absolutely not. The point of Classic is for it to be way different than retail. This isn’t BFA Lite, it’s supposed to be the game as it was. Something 12 patches in is barely Vanilla-authentic
---
There's a better chance of a hybrid (healer) to have slots open up vs. a DPS class.
---
That's their incentive.
---
Nothing triggers me harder than a warrior that holds up a dungeon group forming because they don't want to tank, especially in leveling dungeons. Like bro, all you need is a shield, you have no excuses.
---
Devilsaur is bis for them so not really worth it tbh
---
&gt; Only downside of druid is that you always look at the same furry butt. Sure, eventually you have this awesome tier gear, but you look at your level 20 catform or lvl 10 bear form nonetheless. Only as a healer you can appreciate your looks.
---
Oh that's very true. I should've included a bit about that actually as that's probably my biggest critique of druids. Great point there. 
---
The thing about Korrak (and the design decision behind the changes to alterac valley) that some may not recollect is that you needed to slay him for the AV quest rewards (Ice-barbed spear, xbow for hunters etc.), with his removal they instead changed the quest for these rewards to require a victory within Alterac Valley. What actually happens is that previously players formed individual groups/raids within Alterac Valley to complete various objectives together (such as Korrak), which commonly caused conflicts at various parts within the battleground. With these changes and streamlining players were instead heavily encouraged to rush towards the end objective and thus we experience shorter games.
---
more industry focused than state.  I'm sure he works in some Tech. or consulting field.  
---
As close to 1.0 AV as possible, please. Shredders, mine fields, EVERYTHING. This is the true authentic vanilla experience. I want day(s) long epic AVs. Fighting at a choke for days, kiting entire zergs to mines to watch them all die, summoning epic npcs to push into the alliance or horde base to finally move some ground. Desperately defending from the enemies summoned champions trying to hold your ground.
---
All of this felt so EPIC and an experience you haven't been able to ever get again in WoW since the massive nerfs. Give us our truly unique experience that's the AV I remember from my times playing Vanilla back in the day.
---
AV went from a massive battlefield - a true war where every persons contribution mattered all over the entire huge map - to a a centralized zerg on a single objective where you ignore PvP to end the game faster due to all these nerfs over time.
---
You can get 15 min PvE rushes on live servers, and have been able to for over a decade. Classic should be where you experience the unique versions of how content originally was.
---
GIVE US DAY(S) LONG TURTLE AVS! GIVE US OUR EPIC STRUGGLE INTO THE HORDE OR ALLIANCE BASE BACK! GIVE US WHAT MADE THIS BG WORTHY OF ITS EPIC TITLE!
---
K3 warrior population is 2x shaman on Horde.
---
http://www.kronos-wow.com/server-statistics-kronos-3/
---
Ret was a dead tree.
---
This is the most logic choise. Gj. 
---
My crisis is the trade-off between cool glowing eyes, or crossed straps? 
---
But always missing jaw.
---
Warrior is by far the best tank, but Druids have been theorycrafted heavily on pservers recently and are actually excellent off tanks. In some fights they are actually preferable to Warriors, and in situations where fully progressed guilds wish to speedrun/minimize time in older raids, a Druid is sometimes more optimal than a Warrior due to DPS output. There are many video guides on the subject on what a Feral Druid tank brings to a raid group.   
---
Be warned though, it's a very difficult role to prepare for.   
---
Paladin tanks are a meme outside of 5mans, don't bother. 
---
That was part of the BG. If you wanted rank you went to WSG. AV was supposed to be a slog.
---
Hi, /u/dj1491
---
I believe Ion is also technically in charge of the Classic development team too, right? But yeah this Q&amp;A is exclusively for BFA.
---
crow3 warrior population is 2x shaman on Horde.
---
https://bit.ly/2W9BRZd &lt;-- to crow3 stats page
---
A later AV release if needed. Then yes. 
---
Surely BoW would restore more mana over five minutes than the cost of AI though. Plus mages get free water.
---
Boring. Thanks for making sure I never visit AV.
---
Sure, the Unyielding Maul is close. My point is more that Warden staff IS better, even though its not by much. As a Bear you are already fighting a lot of prejudice and peoples perceptions of the class, and since you wont ever replace Warden staff once you have it for mitigation, may as well get it right away. 
---
The reason I value Devilsaur so high is that Druid mitigation is already in a very good place for Molten Core once you start raiding there after getting prebis items and threat is a much more important factor to consider. Because you cannot wear Plate, you are already locked out from a lot of the hit options warriors use at this point, such as Lionheart Helm, and you need to make this up somehow. Pre ZG there just arent that many options to choose from sadly, so you take what you can get.
---
Devilsaur is an excellent set to use as it not only has stamina, but also crit and hit in abundance. The only time I would use Warstrife+Slaghide Gauntlets would be for tanking Broodlord in BWL.
---
At the end of the day though, you should try to get lots of different gear options and just change it around depending on your needs. If you have less healers than normal for a raid, switch to more defensive gear. If you have great DPS and everyone got world buffs, use more offensive pieces etc. Tanking is all about adapting to the situations, which I believe is the point you are trying to make as well.
---
I admit, I did quite literally have a blast with the ol' AP + POM + Pyro, 3-minute mage build (and eventually I switched to frost instead, though I actually think I had more fun as arcane/fire) 
---
It's reddit.
---
*Everything* Looks more popular here than it really is.
---
I'm so lost. When has WoW ever had dedicated servers? WoW isn't p2p and you can't host servers.
---
You badass.
---
Uhhh, what? 
---
thank you for the advice ! It sound like a good plan. :) 
---
The stats page of that server says warrior has 2x the population of shaman on horde. https://i.imgur.com/T024qD6.png
---
That's a useful comparison. Thanks for that.
---
Yup
---
Don't worry, you can rush the last boss and get it by defeating him.
---
Can't seem to find the post that I saw a bit ago, where is the thread with all the info about classes? That thread had links to specific classes with general discussion 
---
And so it begins. 1.12 AV is essentially retail AV. Im in the minority that welcome an "updated classic" experience with small QOL changes and not strictly #NoChange. 
---
..but if there was one thing I was looking forward to it was the long battles of old AV. The blue post even started by saying it's a question being asked frequently. Very surprised this is what we will get, I guess those memories of old AV will continue to be just that, memories. RIP classic AV. 
---
Depends on the day of release. I'll take a couple days or the whole week off.
---
Will do, thanks buddy. 
---
Uuhh....no. After Korrak had been removed they just made it so you had to defeat Vandar/Drek'thar to finish the quest. Simply win an AV. That's it.
---
People aren't going to queue for a slog.  If they don't implement battlegroups and have PVP purely based on each server's population there's going to be a number of servers where AV's simply won't pop after a while.
---
Old AV is one of the biggest things people look at through rose-colored glasses.  It's fun a few times but loses its appeal quickly.
---
Something to bear in mind if you're planning to go DW fury at 60 is that Thrash Blade is usually the go-to MH weapon you'll use, especially for humans. Resurgence Rod and Thrash Blade are both rewards from the same quest, so unfortunately it means choosing between a great 2H for levelling vs a great MH at 60. 
---
I think players just needed time to adjust to the changes.  Convincing 39 other random players to deviate from established strategy requires a lot of effort and persistence.  We no longer have that inertia to work against.   If anything, the opposite is true: even if we returned to the days-long slug fest that was old AV, we'd still see a large number of players using the same zerg strategy they're familiar with on Live.  That's what they know.
---
But at the same time, you need to make sure you don't have Blessing of Protection activated while you try.
---
If you look at it as "cat isn't that bad" or "bear isn't that bad" then you're doing it wrong. Saying "I'm a cat" or "I'm a bear" is missing the whole point.
---
You play like a hybrid. Feral Druids are the best flex in the game. No one else can play both roles as effectively as you can. The extra battle rez + innervate + offheals is just icing on the cake.
---
You're correct. The quest starts in the DM library and requires you to kill Hydrospawn in DME.
---
Most vanilla players haven't played the original AV, most of the ones that did don't remember it correctly, and most of the people playing Vanilla in 2019 don't give two shits about that cesspit of a battleground, and just want to farm rep and honor for welfare epics.
---
This is why I plan to never take warriors into Scholomance while I Pally tank it. Get your Deathbone the hard way.
---
A someone who joined in TBC one of the things I have been looking forward to most were the fabled days-long-AV battles. 
---
Pretty disappointed, hope Blizz will reconsider.
---
I was around when Nost was shut down and the whole movement for classic servers started. It wasn’t the people who now want it to be as far removed from Classic as possible that were rallying for classic servers. They were too busy mocking people for it
---
They should not be accomodated now that it’s happening and get to call the shots for the people who actually care about it.
---
Not everybody is only interested in their "honor per hour" bullshit. Many people just enjoyed having an epic 3 hour tug of war for a single important graveyard with skeletons strewn EVERYWHERE. THAT is fun, not doing something the fastest it can be done just to get higher numbers every hour. It's not a race to see how fast you can progress. I don't want to be done right away, I want it to last a long time.
---
This is good news. AV has always been a shit battleground that heavily favours the Alliance, but the rewards are just too good to ignore. Let me rush this lame battleground for the reputation so I never have to step in there again. You people calling for hour long AVs can turtle on the bridge for maximum "fun" and nostalgia, it's the same effect.
---
&gt;Vanilla has been theorycrafted into oblivion 
---
Hasn't this already been debunked? How can a game be theorycrafted into oblivion if old guides are bad, and new ones are based on private servers that get so many things wrong?
---
Correct, mages cant make lvl55 water before Dire Maul. You can however buy Enriched Manna Biscuit from Argent Dawn that give same mana.
---
The fundamental limitation is “can you kill it before it kills you?”  Whether you do that being being an unstoppable force or an immovable object is a matter of flavor.  
---
I could see them introducing the long AV's as maybe a side mode but I wouldn't be surprised at all if it was empty after the novelty wore off. I felt that the 15-25 minute AV's were still pretty epic, you often had large pushes of troops in choke points battling over graveyards. I remember fondly looking forward to AV weekend during Burning Crusade. 
---
I don't hate this choice at all. 
---
You still get the wand. The new quest objective is to just win a game.
---
But not enough people want to lose all the time. You can turtle up, fight it out and horde still loses because of the alliance bias in the setup of the BG it just takes longer. Not rushing and killing the boss asap means your team loses because in that version of AV the boss is rushable and the other team is not going to wait because you want a fun game. 
---
Having this version guarantees fast no fun games where neither side really fights each other. It is the worst possible version we could get, only slightly better than the current retail version where even if you turtle the game is only 15 minutes long because of reinforcements.
---
Orc Shaman of course :)
---
Made me snort. Thanks
---
Absolutely, I can see why some people would hate it, I find it quite fun but would get annoyed if it was too frequent.  
---
It IS an incentive. I could halfass my rotation, let priests pick up the slack while I watched TV, put down my totems and healed semi-efficiently and I still got lots of drops as resto shaman.
---
As warrior you have to fight tooth and nail to defend your core raid spot.
---
As resto shaman it's a breeze and guilds put up with your antics, because they know that shamans get invited into guilds at level 57 and carried through preBiS in a day by the guilds MT.
---
Resto shamans and other not so much played classes get carried on a silver platter.
---
I'd bring 28 to an average raid. You can farm shards easily on trash. The only raids where I made sure to bring 50+ was for Naxx, specifically Lotheb. 
---
go hang yourself. classic should not be designed for people who hate it as is
---
The servers are/were hosted by Blizzard, but they're different now from how they used to be. When the game first came out, you joined a single dedicated server and the people on that server was the pool of people you played with.
---
Since that time, they've introduced various cross-server functionality between players, so now you're playing with a pool of people across many servers rather than just your dedicated server.
---
You still technically play on a dedicated server that you have to choose, but you're also playing with people across multiple other servers. It's a kind of hybrid, and it effectively killed the persistent community that would form on any given server.
---
My brother is a doctor and while I don't know how much advance notice he needs to give, I do know he can only take vacation in week long blocks. That's because they have this outside service that has a person come in for the week to fill in for him. Can't imagine not being able to take single days off for those nice long weekends. Feels like a waste taking an entire week outside of summer and holiday vacations!
---
based
---
You can still play suboptimal specs incorrectly. And that's what you're advocating here.
---
Calm down you mental case.
---
This wasn't my experience at all in these games. Often youd have the losing team bottle necking the opponents near the mountain passes and I often found myself in pretty awesome PVP fights. Youd have a contingent of defenders holding off the tide. It was fun. 
---
All of this information and ramping up over blue posts for classic tells me a release date or beta of some sort is very very close. 
---
Good luck with that plan lol
---
LOL
---
I've seen your replies in this thread and there's no point in enganging in discussion with you.
---
You know if were doing the old PVP ladder with HK's being super meaningful people will want to draw these out to maximize their kills. AV was great for HK's
---
Bullshit. Long AVs were the only AVs that were fun/memorable at all.
---
Casual does not = intentionally lazy or bad. 
---
I have played quite alot of Vanilla, never seen a min-maxer getting pissed at a random boomkin passing him by in the city. It always has to do with group effort and lack of contribution. And even then it was not even once in an angry condecending tone.
---
It might just be that the dialog on this forum is different from the actual game. Still if a min-maxer with alot of experience is offering his advice on a spec then you can choose to take it or not. Do not take it as an insult or as if he is being a jerk. 
---
MT and ST are the only ones who get preferential treatment. Everyone else is easily replaceable. A shaman or druid asking for extra loot priority will get laughed out of the raid group.
---
That's simply not true man, even back in the day there were plenty of supporters of long AVs. It wasn't everyone, but it was quite a large minority. 
---
That's what I said? You can't compare retail expansion releases to Classic because Classic is going to be handeled like a new Blizzard game. In addition Classic is basically a remake, they don't have to develop everything from scratch.
---
No one plays retail tho.
---
Hang yourself.
---
You're misusing the term. That's not what a dedicated server means. 
---
I'm good with this. Yeah, I also experienced the day long AVs and imo they were funny, but no fun. You did them one time to get your spear from Korrak, 1 more time for the lulz at 60 and then you went to WSG to get your honor rank. 1.12 AV is still leagues better than what we have today. 
---
Such a weird ass question -- this game is called world of WARcraft-- go kill everything with a red name plate
---
Because you’d lose the argument.
---
Nothing, don't pick a class who's primary job you don't want to do. I am not hating alt specs but, it's not my job to reward you for being not being sub optimal.
---
Yes, you can.
---
&gt;People aren't going to queue for a slog.
---
They did before, I don't see why they wouldn't again. Especially if it's cross-server BGs (which I also have mixed feelings about, but at least cross server BGs would work well with long AVs)
---
Not op and not too fussed about this discussion, but what constitutes as 'good for the game' is literally just a bunch of different people's opinions, so it is for the most part subjective.
---
And even with the benefits of hindsight and comparisons to private servers, no one knows what is actually going to happen with classic. It's just a bunch of extrapolations from people's memories of 13 years ago.
---
Of course they have the data lol.
---
    git checkout v1.5.0
---
There you go, you have the data.
---
Please don't troll. You can still go in raid as a healer and ask to get some retribution gear when no one need it
---
Warbear is not a BiS set, it's something halfway-decent you can slap on at level 55ish to be ok at your role until something better comes along. It's not going to be a long term gear solution for anyone.
---
Dear God. I played a mage in vanilla and I was almost certain that it was so but I hoped that my memory hasn't served me well. 60lvl farming won't be that fun until DM pops up.
---
AV was supposed to be somewhat rare, it was part of the reason why those games went so long - everyone joined up because it didn't happen often, and tended to want to stick around to see if they could get that elusive win.
---
I'm talking about the official forums.
---
To be fair, it's likely only people who feel strongly either way are posting on the forums about much of anything. But the only feedback I've been able to see overwhelmingly supports older versions of AV and is at least mildly disappointed by the announcement.
---
Some one else linked this: [https://imgur.com/a/PS6gIC6](https://imgur.com/a/PS6gIC6)
---
Which I find neat.  Combined with the patches you quoted:
---
1.5 AV lasted 125 days on live servers.
---
1.8 AV lasted 169 days on live servers.
---
1.10 AV lasted 84 days on live servers.
---
1.11 AV lasted 168 days on live servers until TBC dropped, at least.
---
Making 1.8 the longest-run Vanilla AV experience by a day.
---
he does sarcasm, that's what
---
Too bad, I never got to play AV in classic but it was always my favorite battleground in retail since it was like a combination of PvE and PvP.  Would be cool to see all the quest/npc things that were originally in it, but probably not so cool to be stuck 10 hours in a losing match being farmed either.
---
Always brother. As I said the only acceptable alternative is if you play an undead tank. With special dispensation from the crown. You will be allowed to wear an iron jaw over your floppy tongue. It's a necessary evil to help them with tanking.
---
Absolutely.   
---
Thought about that but forgot to mention. 
---
However personally I always just tanked my own UBRS runs and got the swords in about 10 runs, so I never really bothered with Thrash Blade.
---
Of cooourse theramore genocide didn't happen! What are you, alt-alliance?
---
ESPECIALLY if they're insisting on keeping cross realm battle grounds. I can understand not wanting long AVs if it's not cross-realm due to que times. But if they're already basically fixing that by implementing cross realm BGs (the only redeeming quality of cross realm) then they might as well have the long AV matches, like why wouldn't you? 
---
1.8 would be my preferred patch. 
---
Nope. The objective point of Classic is to be the most authentic Vanilla experience, and so people on retail don’t have their game altered to meet demand
---
Speak for yourself, I loved joining an AV and just fighting other players in an endless back and forth battle for a few hours, then logging off to go to work for 6-8 hours. I'd come home and join back into the same AV and see familiar faces fighting the same damn battle!
---
Bullshit.
---
They will not be tweeting classes...
---
op, check if you like warlock, cuz its probs the best pick
---
Incoming 100 videos explaining these changes and why/dont want these changes and that XYZ was better.
---
On a serious note though, i am fine with this. Anyone that thinks AV will be "Like the good old days" where you had 36 hour AV's of people purely farming drops from mobs for money instead of PvPing is an oaf, 100% oaf.
---
It will be exactly how it is on retail and Private servers where you just zerg to the end capture RH or AS pull out marshal's and burn the boss, yeah you will have the odd game where it lasts longer than 10-15 minutes and goes for an hour or two but that is a rare occurrence and where you've either been turtled or being farmed by a premade.
---
They did it over a decade ago because that's all they had.  AV's original concept had a ton of issues thus the changes they made during Classic.
---
Dude, many/most people here have played Vanilla for many years. Personally I started in 2015 so that means I have played longer on private servers than Vanilla retail even existed.
---
I have raided as Paladin and Shaman. I choose those classes because I like TO HEAL N RAIDS! lol
---
Yeah I was playing 6+ hour AV well into BC. The players are the problem.
---
I'm just super bummed out we can't collect human bone shards or night elf heads...
---
I really hope they have the cloth turn in quests available at launch so horde can actually get other racial mounts.
---
min-maxers sometimes = People with experience who offer advise and help to those who are new or struggling.
---
Do you think Vanilla is easy? Do you think no one ever gave up in STV?
---
And full arcane mages. And ferals. And dps shamans in pve. And mana issues for spriests in long pve.And other tanks to be on point with warrior on every raid boss.
---
If you want to change one class then every class is will have to be changed. Every talent tree branch sucks at something. You might not like it but paladin is built to be support dps, aoe tank or single target heal. 
---
I want to play an old game I loved. I want to see as little improvements and balance changes as possible.
---
&gt; AV was supposed to be somewhat rare
---
What are you basing this on?
---
You can install moonlight and play wow on your phone from the toilet.
---
Just abnormal to have no dates for an expected summer release and we’re days away from Q2 2019
---
&gt; I wonder if the game could ever go back to what it was for me during BC.
---
Vanilla is all the great parts of TBC except for class balance, IMO.  And other things, like world content being relevant, it actually does a lot better than TBC.
---
Regarding the community, I think it will come back.  In fact, I dare say that specific part is why a lot of us are really excited for Classic!
---
Jesus christ this is the best thing ever.. Definitely using this a ton to help plan what gear to try and plan to get ahead of time or know when something is about to get updated and then not go after a certain raid drop. 
---
I used to log in from work at the end of the day, queue up for AV, lock the computer and drive home, then log in from home and wait for the queue to pop.
---
Half the time it was already in progress which made the suckage even more sucky.
---
Why do people think more npcs = longer AV? Several private servers have had AV with shredders, mines, guards, captains+++.
---
People still just ignore everything they can, kill whatever gives honor and then rush for the last boss. The bgs end in around 15mins even wtih all the npcs. Only way for the AV to last hours is if the opposite faction is turteling instead of rushing boss. And that can be done on both 1.12 AV and pre-1.12 AV.
---
You are correct.
---
I do not think this will affect the majority of players if the dire maul update comes out within 2 months of launch. If you consider medium pace of 8 days played to 60 then at a rate of 4 hours every day it will take that player 48 real days to reach 60.
---
/u/genesis88's reply is already good but I just want to explain it in my words, too:
---
I was playing AV because it was genuinely \*\*fun\*\*. I don't want to rush through it just to get those honor points. I don't give a dry shit about how much honor I make and how much honor per hour this is. I play WoW for the fun large and epic world, not to be the fastest player having max pvp gear or rank 14 on my server. Those 15 minutes AV are not fun. They are just a "tool" to gain a lot of honor in a short time. This is cool for the low percentage of min/max bois who really need to be the best/quickest/first in everything. This is not cool for "most of us".
---
Well I mean, you’re gonna get ganked on any Warrior spec. Lol
---
My first desktop raid array was specifically to speed up wow load times.
---
do you realize you're retarded?
---
I never saw this during AV in Classic during 1.12. Most all of the AVs I did were 1 team turtling. Many HKs on Alliance bridge. It was amazing.
---
But those few ruin it for everyone.
---
&gt; ays long AV's were terrible in retrospect.
---
I had many multi-hour AVs in Classic after 1.12. Turtle power!
---
No changes 
---
By the end of vanilla on my server queues weren't terrible and games essentially rushed vann/drak lasting about 20-30 minutes tops
---
They've already confirmed they do not, they only have 1.12 data.
---
Play a real class
---
Sure the source isnt official or 100% conclusive. But the same can be said for something like the world being round or flat. Or the Big Bang Theory vs creationism. Most people tend to follow what is indicated by the evidence we do have available.
---
I think its fair to say that the boss armor values on private servers are most likely too high.  Its not certain, but its more likely than the opposite
---
I get you, I really do, but the 'most authentic Vanilla experience' is subjective, because we had vanilla for what, 3 years-ish through a number of patches. Different people played at different times during this period, meaning their 'authenic vanilla experience' was different.
---
You're framing it as if no one ever plays hybrid because they like it, but rather because the evil raid leaders force them to do slave labour.
---
better is definitely subjective. I think its better this way. see how subjective it is? Did you forget when blizz said they wanted to start in 1.12? or are you just picking and choosing at this point?
---
Point is, 1.12 AV is vanilla, whether you like it or not
---
Devilsaur is level 53 I'm saying rogues wont use it because they can just get devilsaur.
---
I’m going to be leveling with a rogue buddy, but unless I’m grabbing cat DPS gear, we found there isn’t a helluva lot of overlap. Where there is we’re just gonna farm, heh.
---
Cant wait for all the salt
---
TIL its possible to have a dagger skill of ~327
---
&gt;It was terrible game design.
---
I don't agree with that. I loved playing games dedicated to exactly this experience back in the day (DAOC, Planetside), and i also liked the "endless" version of AV - It felt like a more "organized" Southshore-Tarren Mill battle with actual goals and rewards.
---
It just didn't fit well with the other two (Quick, small) BGs and (Imo) should have stayed a seperate thing, like an instanced Wintergrasp.
---
I think you spawn to the closest one that is in your current zone. If you can get a map of the graveyard locations then you should be able to estimate the demarcation.
---
&gt; It gives us several early improvements to the BG that we’re glad to have in place. Early on in AV, there were too many NPCs and they were too hard to kill.
---
This right here is the problem. It's a question of Blizzard having a fundamentally different view of what is fun and what isn't.
---
They're basically just saying it was too hard. Old AV required more teamwork, new AV is just a rush. It is disturbing that Blizzard essentially removed NPC's like Korak because "they were too hard". If they had said "hey guys we only have 1.12 data, so we're gonna go with that even though we know many of you loved 1.8 AV" that would have been fine.
---
Saying the reason they're doing 1.12 AV is because earlier versions were too hard is not comforting.
---
Well this sucks.
---
&gt;They did it over a decade ago because that's all they had.  
---
Right, and in classic that's "all" they'll have again, and thus they'll still queue. (I feel like saying "that's all they had" makes it sound like it was a bad thing, when really that's pretty subjective. They also still had WSG as well if you wanted short BGs). 
---
Retail is back to 40min average AV with BfA changes, which imho is good amount of time for big BG
---
Solution; turtle the fuck out of every match so you can summon ice lord and wolves
---
If Dire Maul releases 3/4 after release then it will be fine. Only hardcore people will suffer. Not being 15 anymore shields me from thing being a real problem for me :)
---
Loatheb would be extremely poor for a Druid. Most of Abom wing druids can shine. Druids are extremely good on MC/BWL fire resist fights as well.
---
No doubt, but vacation culture does vary from state to state too (not to mention labor laws). And there are fewer barriers to me moving to a new state than there are working in a different industry.
---
when people talk about classic AV no one means the version that was in the game for only 6 months, which is basically unchanged for 10+ years after.
---
1.12.1 AV with cross realm BGs are not at all what people loved AV for but its the reality of what we're going to get
---
Would be 1.8 I believe, but I remember vividly AV lasting hours even in TBC.
---
Maybe unpopular opinion, but I’d rather not have AV at all than having AV where both teams just run past each other to PvE the enemy boss and then we all sit and pretend this somehow even remotely qualifies as PvP.
---
Yes but they are calling it classic wow, not 1.12 wow. This would infer that they would include trademark classic features such as AV with tons of NPCs that were actually meaningful.
---
Especially for something like a BG that is instanced there is no reason not to use what the playerbase considers the best version.
---
in overwatch I found that a bad tank is worse than a bad healer
---
they are much more important there
---
Healing gear won't help you tank.  And honestly, back then, a healer meant more.l
---
Made Caer Darrow my background absolutely love it, Though if you're taking requests a group fighting/preparing to fight KT or Nefarian would be insane!
---
I envy you. If Blizzard really sticks with the 1.12 version I sincerely hope that the players on the server I choose will also rather fight than rush.
---
No, but I don't think you are in the majority judging from the comments on both this forum and others.
---
They lasted longer than 15 minutes. I remember vividly some in TBC lasting hours.
---
Old AV is fun one time. Once people figure it out it becomes the same 40v40 run past eachother and race to the final boss. Even when Korrak is a thing, no one ever does it.
---
Getting 3 shot by bowmen is not fun.
---
You can't just say it has a place. I asked you for a single example. This is an MMO, solo play should not be the only place you can do anything, that isn't viable. Reckoning does not have a place in pvp, it is a slot machine and just plain stupid. And again, it is the PROT tree. Ret still has no place in anything.
---
I started playing on one in january but stopped at 33. I was having an absolute ball and loved my guild, but the thought of getting to 60 and losing my character forever ultimately made me put it down and wait for classic. (My server has stated they intend to shut down on classic release).
---
The game has aged marvelously. Seriously, I struggle to play dark souls 2 (2012) because I feel it’s aged poorly, but I find WoW classic to still be just as enticing as it was 15 years ago.
---
Abnormal? I'm this hype fueled landscape sure. Its smart though. 
---
Giving a vague time when they're going to release it allows blizzard to delay longer if they require it. It allows them to fix more issues before launch without getting all the neckbeards mad because the game got delayed or launch buggy as fuck.
---
Imagine taking time off only to have the game be delayed or release in a broken state.
---
I liked the vid! Keep working on future content. Nice idea!
---
100% agree. If AVs will be nothing but rushing past each other they can as well flood the damn valley and make it the largest fishing area WoW has ever seen. Would at least make it useful to everyone.
---
because muh #nochanges
---
4 days 20 hours and ~50 min
---
Just leave AV the way it was for fucks sake
---
How is it worse? Horde have to do LBRS, kill rend in UBRS, then after going and turning in quests and a lot of flying around you need to do UBRS again to collect dragon eyes, then you need to kill 3 dragons in the world that need at least 3-4 people to kill. Then you need to go back to UBRS for a 3rd time to kill the final boss.
---
Alliance you have to do BRD but only around the entrance and prison area, then a bunch of running around the world, then one UBRS run. Sounds hard...
---
Conviction was crap, flat 5% crit for ret is moot. Vengeance was useless as you lost the utility and safety of having prot and holy talents. Pvp and pve in classic ret was utility, not core dps. You could dps but you were largely an aura and healbot.
---
I think I could argue the healer has always been the most important part of a group, including in BFA. It's anecdotal, but there's no biger disaster in a m+ than bringing a bad healer. I've found that good healers can mask bad tanks more than good tanks can mask bad healers.
---
For Vanilla, the tried and true equilibrium is still there -- the tank's job is to create more threat than the healer, the healer's job is keep the tank alive so he cna absorb the damage and the DPS' job is to kill the enemies before the healer runs out of mana. Everyone is important, but it always seems to feel like you're better off if the best skilled player in the group is healing and the most geared player in the group is tanking.
---
The thing is that i've never heard anyone say they really like 1.12 AV. It's just a thing you do because you have to. However many people do like the earlier versions, and some people hated it too. But at least there was some emotion there. 1.12 AV is just boring. It's not hard, it's not super fun, nothing really matters except rushing and Alliance will win 95% of the time.
---
I'd rather have a battleground that actually felt like an epic battle, even if it had some bullshit mechanics, over a quick race to the boss where nobody gives a shit.
---
And yet...solo play is a significant portion of the game.  You can't just handwave it away and say it doesn't matter.
---
Of course man. I will be RP'in!
---
You shouldn't play Ret Paladin if your goal is to raid and be seen as an equal to specs that you're not equal to.  If you can't accept being a Ret Paladin within the realm of what it's realistically capable of doing then you're not going to enjoy it most likely.
---
Probably a rare experience to be honest. But I hope maybe the mentality of us will bring us towards true battles even with the 1.12 version. Who knows. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Second this, TBC AV was long for me in whatever battle group Zenedar-EU was in.
---
Out of curiosity, how did they hold up in Pvpz both battleground snd world ?
---
They should just have two distinct versions of AV and be done with it.
---
Agree the fuck kinda radio stations you have?
---
Like 90% of the people who will play this. I will play for one month then quit because I don’t have the time / have already played this content 
---
Gnome mage! I like alliance the best and have not really tried out mage. And I never play as human, to me its a boring bland choice when there is more interesting races.
---
Planing leveling with fire and 21 points into arcane for pom pyroblast for ganking lulz. Or maybe I will go frost for better survivability/efficiency.. decisions!
---
Well mine is battery powered, but it is kinda dangerous. 
---
What you are asking for was The Burning Crusade. It will come out eventually, and with that you will see a great balancing and fix to the classes. 
---
The way I see it, it was a easy way for people to jump into a world-pvp like setting easily with others that wanted to participate in it. Battlegrounds in older MMOs were meant to last for days. AV and WSG were fairly unique due to the fact that they only lasted for a good 30 minutes or so, this wasn't all that common of game design in MMO pvp back then.
---
AV was added  in Patch 1.5 in June 2007. Just 9 short months later, Patch 1.10 released in March 2006, and is basically the version we're getting in Classic.  
---
FYI: This means, that the version we're getting in Classic was the longest version that was in the game.  
---
I'm not sure why all of the hate about this announcement. There will still be multi-hour turtling AVs just like there were after Patch 1.10.  
---
try subtype:axe, weapon-subtype is one of the possible categories of values for subtype: (which includes axe inside of it, check the second table), the other being armor-subtype.
---
Well instead of saying "supposed to be" I should have just said "they were rare" because a 40v40 battle wouldn't happen very often. The inter-BG incentives got people to remain inside there and fight one another, rather than with a TM/SS eventually people shrug and do something else - or most are lowish levels.
---
It would be shouted from the rooftops "AV IS UP OMG!!" and people would excitedly enjoy the BG as long as it was up since it was a rare thing.
---
So no actual example of a place then? Okay that's what I thought.
---
Solo play should never be the balance of an MMO. That's the antithesis of what an MMO is.
---
In Vanilla and TBC i find tanks to be by far the most important role. A bad tank will make the run unplayable, even if you have the greatest healer. A bad healer and a good tank will be mostly fine.
---
Bad tank means that aggro goes everywhere, and you have accidental pulls, so the healer needs to be godlike to stop wipes. 
---
Bad healer is fine so long as the tank keeps aggro on himself.
---
I say this as a tank player in vanilla, and i've healed TBC/wotlk. But a good tank in vanilla will almost always determine the quality of the run.
---
Started doing this and by level 25 I felt like it would ruin the experience by just quitting that toon and going through the adventure all over again when classic launches.
---
I recently started on an undocumented server myself. Like you, I wanted to test some classes. I got 5 classes up to 15-20. And I fell in love with the game all over again! Most importantly, with class fantasy back, I fell in love with Paladin again. 
---
On a side note, the first day of playing was....a change. Lol I died a lot. You can't just face roll fields of mobs. So changing mentalities was difficult at first. But once I calmed down, and reminded myself to enjoy the journey, things got way better!
---
Horde will have to kill nelf if they quest in Ashenvale. Every race will kill dwarves in Searing Gourge, Burning Steppes, BRD, Hillsbrad Foothills, etc. Unless you don't care about the dark iron dwarves, which, screw those guys ;) 
---
IIRC, you will almost never have to kill Tauren
---
Taurens are chonkier. Big badda boom.
---
It's kind of a strange question because classes don't dictate what you do. You cna play any class casually, so you should play the class that interests you most.
---
On the opposite end of the spectrum, there are certain classes that are easier to play than others at a high level.
---
Good suggestion, I will work on adding usable: and classes:
---
I played all the versions extensively back in vanilla. The 1.12 isn't the one that gave the unique gameplay that made AV special for me.  
---
That's not going to change just because the Devs weren't able to implement the earlier versions within budget/timeframe.  
---
And it's definitely not going to change because some forum smartypants goes "you think you do, but you don't".  
---
The inability / unwillingness to sell me the old AV is currently enough of a disappointment that I suspect it will shorten my engagement significantly. And that's fine either way, Blizz are the ones with the numbers that need to make the choices.  
---
But fuck anyone who tells me I am supposed to be happy because "it's 1.12, Hallelujah!" like it's gospel from the lord almighty.
---
Not sure if you are being sarcastic, I can give you a full comparison write up after class if you really want it
---
Will do, and thanks!
---
Teacher here... I really hope it comes out in early July. I would have a lot of time to just sink into it. I may teach summer school but once that ends I will be able to play 10 hours a day for a few weeks. I want to get a level 60 before I start up work again in the fall. I can then play less and still accomplish end game goals.
---
Lol sorry. My pocket seem to have replied
---
you can get exalted in 2 days with either version of AV, the fun of it matters a lot more than how long it takes to get rewards
---
No, no they certainly did not. It isn't about simply the time length, it's the strategy and team effort required, and not rewarding instant gratification with a fast match that is most efficient.
---
what about rogues or hunters? u gonna bring 4 casters?
---
Wait.  What?
---
realistically I would think the phases are more likely to be at least 3 months apart.
---
Horde side restoshamans are hardest raid class to find.  When I was MT on private server I actively sought to play with any resto shaman I could find and then try and get them in my guild.  Was still tough finding enough.  As for keeping them around... we just gave them raid loot and they kept coming.
---
Should be pretty obvious that the right movie is to look at everything on a case by case basis and make it as far removed from what’s already available today as possible
---
The 1.10/1.12 version we're getting in Classic is the version that was live for a majority of Vanilla. Most of the AVs were HK farming and turtling. This is all before reinforcements, and they went on for hours. Not as long as when Korak was up, but this is not the 5 minute AV rush that everyone is worried about.
---
&gt; The honor gained from farming kills just doesn't compare
---
Then go to WSG
---
&gt; players using the same zerg strategy they're familiar with on Live. That's what they know.
---
That's why it *could* be an idea to use the version where this didn't work.
---
I don't get it, Old AV was fun for the first few times but that was also back when most people playing had time to play for extended hours, even the most hardcore of players nowadays have a job or family I so I don't see how this is a bad thing.
---
Paladins in Vanilla were majority of the time a Cleanse, Buff and Heal bot. Rest of the time a tank.
---
Regarding healthstones, it's all based on the goals of the guild. Everyone in your guild doesn't need to pot either, but it sure as hell will increase your chances of success. Ideally, while everyone is clearing trash, you're handing out cookies for the next boss fight.
---
Though summoning 20 people seems a bit absurd -- it's one thing to pull in some straglers, but if half your guild is late to raid, there's a biger issue.
---
How does going to WSG help fix the issues with AV?
---
I know exactly what you mean; I know it's not going to match what Blizzard releases perfectly, but the way you play is completely different between BfA and Classic.
---
I'm looking forward to the challenge and actually having to think about things. As it is, every class can just faceroll everything.
---
This x1000. 
---
For fucks sake, have people learned nothing over the last 15 years? Streamlining everything to maximize efficiency per hour is what got us the shit show that is retail, with everything and every class playing the same. God forbid we have a game mode that lets people just fight and enjoy some large scale PvP. Nope! Better nerf it so that it's easier to just go semi-AFK while wracking up virtual currency at a faster rate!
---
Unfortunately im starting to feel the same... One can only look at the same posts only for so long..
---
There are still some items that trigger my change detection code when they shouldn't, will check it later today. If you find more please post them here as a comment to this comment so that I get notified, thanks!
---
if you wanted to take a gamble (assuming no release date within the next 10 days) you could put it in for july 16th https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9u755q/classic_release_date_july_16th_2019/
---
No. The focus of every group is downing content. If mobs aren't dying, you aren't getting anything done. Tanks tank stuff so the dps doesn't die. The healers heal tanks, so they can tank stuff, so the dps doesn't die. 
---
I bring rogues and hunters, even locks. These aren't hybrid or tank classes. Despite what people will meme, rogues aren't meant to tank dungeons. 
---
That doesn’t make it good by definition. Something so late in is barely Vanilla.
---
Yep. Or (if AV is out) Alterac Manna Biscuits which cost 50 copper more each but restore twice as much HP.
---
&gt; Just like 90% of the player base. 
---
Okay then.
---
&gt; We will have WSG for that.
---
But I thought the point of WSG was to fight in the middle?
---
- every pug
---
Yes it adds to rage. Plus there is an amazing tanking hammer at the end of BRD that drops off the last boss. I forget the name but tanks love it, because of its proc. On hit it has a chance to make your next attack hit two more times. (Total of 3) And those can trigger windfurry, which can trigger the proc....ect ect
---
Well you wouldn't start a fight with zero rage 
---
&gt; Edit: Wow, you guys REALLY want 3 day battlegrounds again? It was terrible game design.
---
All of Classic could be dismissed like that. Just because you don't associate the Karak version with the unique experience you don't have to be dumbfounded that others do.   
---
I could just as well go "You must be thick to want the old talents back, those were terrible game design."  
---
&gt; Battlegrounds in older MMOs were meant to last for days
---
I hope not. I don't want to have to wait 18 months for naxx.
---
Played horde mage on pserver.
---
Alliance healer in classic. Sufficiently different.
---
Fml lol. The Grind is real! and this is why there were very little alts in Vanilla. 
---
The problem is not with game design, but with your arrogance that you believe everyone should play the way you want to play.
---
then play retail. don’t fucking entice them to make classic servers then make it as close to an already existing version as possible
---
What does that mean exactly? During Vanilla it was version 1.10 for almost 2 years, and it was launch version for 9 months.
---
Why are they doing this??? Come on give us the 1.8 av. We are getting current as without reinforcements. This is a disgrace. This is stupid. I hate it.
---
Why not implement the best parts of AV from all the classic patches? So we get a good hybrid between the day long AV's and the boring 15 zerg fests?
---
Ohh, I remember now....  cuz the #nochanges people are idiots. 
---
Yes, everyone used to get annoyed with how long they can last. There would constantly be one AV up that had been up for minimum hours and people would join it then leave.
---
EVERYONE was trying to get on the AVs with the quick finish teams in. 
---
I wouldn't say I lost my childhood to WoW, but honestly I'm going to go fully back into it and everything else but work be damned.  I don't have a lot of friends and never did and won't have to worry about a significant other ever so why not play WoW
---
They don't have the 1.5 Data so 1.12 AV is the best you can get.
---
This should have been obvious from the start when they said they were basing the game on 1.12
---
well thats almost the time line of the original releases.  I seriously doubt blizzard would split Dire Maul from phase 1 if that period only lasted 8 weeks.  Vanilla content cycle is approx 2 years, split between 6 content phases thats one every four months.
---
Healing is its own separate game. Paying attention to the 5 bars and making decisions based off of who needs the heals more. I play what I call a lazy style of healing, in that I dont like to heal unless people are sub 50%, even tanks. It also helps mana efficiency rolling the 5 second rule as often as possible.
---
Dart your eyes around a bit in the encounters gone wrong to see who is doing what and how many mobs are where (are the dps kiting them safely? Are they heading my way?) Then makikg split second decisions as to who gets my ever so limited resources.
---
Oh the Enhance shammy who hasn't drank once this entire instance while oom 80% of the time is as close to death as the mage who is outdpsing him. Easy choice. Plus the shaman should have his ahnk up. I enjoy healer quite a bit, especially when I'm feeling a bit tired or just not as focused. 
---
Was a war main throughout vanilla - cata but really enjoyed healing on all classes that could, but especially druids once they got lifebloom. Even as such leveling a druid now in vanilla and still enjoying healing more than tanking or dpsing. 
---
I would rather they just redesigned it in the spirit of the original intentions than any bastardized hogepoge. But was 1.12 AV really 15min zergs? Too long ago to remember properly
---
&gt;"Give us the vanilla experience, with no changes!"
---
&gt;"1.12 is a great patch!"
---
&gt;"Except change these things which was better in the older patches."
---
The healer is important, but in this case the healer is largely there to support the DPS.  Ever since WotLK, timers have been more important than mana.  Enrage timers on every fight, and dungeons being more about how fast you can clear them than whether or not you live.
---
Maybe in M+ it's different, but my experience with everything after TBC is that DPS &gt; Tank &gt; Healer in terms of importance.
---
Are you sure? I must confess that now this makes me unsure about my previously strong opinion. If you are right then most of the rage going on here would be totally unjustified - my comments included. Which I would gladly own up to if I'm wrong (and I hope I am wrong and you are right).
---
I guess we'll just have to wait and see what Classic brings..
---
You could make do with 100 gold. If you're aiming to buy epics and what not then this price goes up, but if you farm out what you need and buy the enchants it shouldn't be too ridiculous. 
---
Mind you this is based off my original servers economy. I remember decking out my old twink in enchants for roughly 100 gold 
---
Was definitely not a rare experience in my battle group for Zenedar-EU at the time.
---
The most disappointing news so far to be fair. I wasn't worried when they announced a 4-phase concept, and while loot trading is trash I think that'll turn out alright one way or another too.
---
This, though, this makes me sad. I really hope that Blizzard goes back on this decision, but it's not phrased in a manner which suggests it is open for debate.
---
Ooh, nice and slow, too (gotta make those procs count).
---
I was looking forward to stepping into the old epic long AV with my best friend at least one more time. This decision is regrettable. It’s one of the things I was most looking forward to and most talked about with my friends.
---
The extra NPCs are what made AV an epic grindy slugfest. I get what was said that this is 1.12 and you said 1.12 but to leave out something so iconic is disappointing. It made AV feel like a larger more spread out battle and more fulfilling to win. I remember asking people the day after leaving one to ask how the AV went and being excited if we won. If I wanted to race to the boss and either turtle at the bridge/hillside-gate or dps race the boss I’d play current wow.
---
Removing and nerfing NPCs is what created the base race that everyone hates about modern wow. Is it the same as current wow? No. It is however entirely reasonable to win AV without doing any pvp. The only argument I understand from a classic standpoint is that it is better for min-maxers because AV is only the best honor in 1.12 on the AV weekend. It allows you to do other bgs during the week if you are only interested in grinding honor.
---
Early summer is key. School + work + wow + everything else would ruin the ability to get to a point where you can get stockpiles of consumes at 60 plus pre raid bis, if it were to release later in the summer. 
---
How can they do that if they only have 1.12 data?
---
It's a player culture problem now. No matter how they did AV it won't ever be a 3 day event like it was in Vanilla. 
---
I completely agree. The context of those battles is what made them awesome, not the micro interactions.
---
I kill fuck turtle pets and look into the eyes of the hunter while doing it
---
You were talking about "Honor gained from farming kills" and back then WSG was where you went to get your efficient honor to rank, not farming HKs in AV
---
Good one Blizzard. Now we all can do 6minute base rushes in AV over and over where we dont meet a single player from the opposing faction.
---
Dumb af.
---
Probably not exactly as it was. Which would mean changes...
---
New flash: Not everyone likes the same stuff. Crazy, right??
---
AV had enough issues that it went through several changes before the first expansion.
---
&gt; I could just as well go "You must be thick to want the old talents back, those were terrible game design."
---
But they weren't though...
---
No guarantee they even have versions of the game that old still, but nice smart ass comment, love me some git jokes.
---
But I think that’s where you’re wrong, if someone’s goal isn’t to go through a dungeon as fast as possible cause maybe it’s their first time and are learning mechanics / enjoying it, can’t you see how that differs from your own who might be on their 100th? I’m cool accepting that the goal needs to be in between both but that’s where being understanding of other people’s goals is a two way street 
---
Don't get me wrong, I'd love to have the old AV back.  I'm just pointing out that our collective memory and meta knowledge as players (both old veterans and Live transplants) is going to color our reintroduction to AV regardless of its specific implementation.
---
I dont want some level 60 cycling between npcs in westfall or the barrens without punishment. Grinding is a part of classic but the quests you did while grinding helped.
---
You're getting eaten alive out here.
---
As a Druid player myself, I can expect nothing from current progression raids.  If we're in BWL, I can get offspec items from Ony or MC, and only if we're not giving that gear to new members who need their raid spec gear.
---
Well that's a little rude.
---
A bit disappointing to hear. It was a long shot that they would create an AV mix from different patches other than 1.12 though. If the Classic community remains vocal maybe they will alter AV in some regard. This is why it is great to get these updates.
---
I can only speak for myself and what I did in Vanilla when I was grinding AV. AV launched in 1.05 June 2005 and became the final version in 1.10 March 2006. A vast majority of my AV farming was post-1.10. There were no reinforcements, and it was just a turtle HK cluster f***. I generally just hung out at the Alliance bridge for most of the AVs I did spamming Blizzard.
---
Yeah you can afford BiS twink gear without much trouble because at those levels you have access to max level professions. Just level fishing up and then go fish for nightfin snappers. With a proper setup all you need to do is keep your mouse cursor at a specific position and press a sequence of three buttons when you hear the fishing bobber noise so you can chill and watch videos on another monitor. You'll probably make like 15-20g per hour for minimal effort.
---
I feel they are important and serve a purpose.
---
&gt; Why cant they do AV as they do raid content? 
---
They might simply not have good enough data that can be put through the "refurnishing" process that they are doing with the 1.12-&gt;7.xx version conversion.  
---
All the staged content have 1.12 data structures. Karak and the AV maps/NPCs might not have that and the extra step of converting 1.5/1.8 data to 1.12 and then to 7.xx might not be feasible.    
---
With that said, I loathe that this is the case and it will probably cost them several months of playtime from me.  
---
Maybe if Classic becomes popular enough it will make the budget/team get prioritized and they can implement it further down the line. They are probably not unaware over how special this is for many people.
---
Except for the people who were in them. If you are interested in a quick game of AV to collect your marks on AV weekend, there are other AV instances to join. Some people don't mind a longer match where intermediate objectives feel like more of an accomplishment.
---
Your first mistake was getting married 
---
This makes sense. I approve!
---
Because it offers a place to farm optimal honor/hour while leaving the AV for the players who just want to have fun and kill horde without constantly maximizing the gains from every reward system in the game
---
This tbh.
---
Defect? 
---
Early on it will be expensive but give it a few months and crusader will cost next to nothing. I believe in current private server economies blue 14-19 items are on par with their vanilla servers about 3-9g depending on population.
---
The first news I've heard about Classic that has legit pissed me off. 
---
Sacrificing gameplay in the name of more efficiently "farming" some bullshit currency. Great. Cause, y'know, those of us that like to rank don't have WSG and AB to do that already - at a more efficient rate and with smaller premades, I'll add.
---
I don't get how people can support this, or advocate for similar changes. What's the point of high rank PvP gear without awesome fights to use it in? Whatever. Be warned, everyone: I will be turtling the shit out of every AV I'm in.
---
Esfand looks like he was probably born with a penis, Staysafe does too and I appreciate that.
---
I really cannot remember when I was playing most AVs. I hope you're right. I also remember those Alliance bridge fights. Those were epic! Even as Horde it was (mostly) fun!
---
Sounds fun for you. Sounds miserable for the poor fuckers that were in there for 6-8 hours banging their heads against a wall while everyone else is AFKing out.
---
You missed my point.  The OP was asking about suggestions to help make AV competitive rather than just rushing towers and bosses without playing defense.  The point is that if you boost the honor gained from killing the opposing faction in AV it may bring it closer to WSG in terms of a viable way to farm honor.
---
In this scenario, playing defense would be advantageous since it results in decent honor gains, as opposed to turtling just delaying the inevitable and acting as a huge waste of time for everyone.
---
I should re iterate. The only other MMO that had BGs that I remember before WoW was DAOC, and they battlegrounds were permanent. Battles lasted for days. One could make a case that AV was inspired by DAOC, due to how you have to kill a keep boss.  I personally dont see an issue with long AV battles. You have two that are shorter and one that is long and ongoing. 
---
That's what almost everyone did in AV during all of Vanilla... This version of AV was the version that was live the longest in Vanilla.  
---
The 5-minute rushes did not start until reinforcements and TBC.
---
From the posts yesterday, you claimed it inline with asshole behavior to pick the wrong class / race combination or trying to use unpopular specs because they need to be carried. Now you talk about how you’re trying to make the game more enjoyable for everyone... reference my reply above and see how it’s not strawman? 
---
Hell there was a post today about Shaman tanks and while we both know that’s not optimal at all, don’t you have fun seeing what people try in this game?
---
Warlocks summoning is an exploit?  Sounds like proper use of your class skills to me.
---
This.  This is why we can’t have nice things.  Who hurt you?
---
Classic_Cometh this is 100% right. Resto shamans are the pot head class of wow. The benifits you get are that everyone will let you get away with murder. While basically doing all but farming your pre-bis for you. Because they are the pot heads of classic. They get all the normal pot head friend benefits.
---
You know what your sandal wearing pot head friends never get though? First shot at the best stuff. Your friends will help and support you. They will even carry you when your on bong rip 15 and can barely even chain heal. They will even find your stupidy hilarious. Any other class would get G kicked for it. That is your benifit to being a shaman. Take it or leave it but, thats what it is.
---
Personally unless you specifically want to be resto. I highly recommend you main some other class first. Then shimmy over to your shaman alt after AQ40 drops and Elemental is actually playable in pvp. Before AQ40 shamans are just a bad class at everything but being a support.
---
Yeah, and it's a shame because I feel like the numbers will dwindle even further by the time it releases and then blizzard will be like 'told you so'.... 'you thought you did, but you didn't'
---
Well thats a shame, would enjoy a non-nerfed AV honestly.
---
That's very unlikely. 8.2 was already announced back at Blizzcon. With the release of 8.1 in January and 8.1.5 last week, we can expect this to drop roughly three months from now, at the start of the summer. Assuming that the next expansion releases late summer/autumn like in the past, that'd mean a content drought of over 14 months with Azshara as the very anticlimactic last boss of the expac. With the all the foreshadowing we've had so far in BfA, this seems very unlikely. I'd be extremely surprised if we get only two raid patches in BfA. Historically there has only been one expansion to have ended on its second major patch (which technically was its first because 6.1 could barely be called a major patch). Also because of the shared subscription between classic and retail Blizzard have a major opportunity. They'll be pulling in a buttload of subscribers who might be tempted to try retail again just for the sake of it. It's in Blizzard's own interest to make the retail game appealing enough that these people stick around, even if their primary interest is classic. And having a year long drought isn't going to fix that. If they're smart they'll time their content cycle around the release of classic. Something like this: 8.2-&gt;2 months-&gt;Classic-&gt;2 months-&gt;8.3.
---
Really need to hit that 10 min mark on what is an extremely small update?
---
you mean Ünderbheit?
---
I'm curious how the general meta is gonna change how the game is played in all aspects.
---
There's a healthy middle ground between the 10 min AV strats we have currently and the 3 day slogs
---
The premades I’ve been running as horde in AV we take SF while clearing SHB and soon Bal. SHGY is too hard to take with IB right there, so we skip SHGY.  Then we move north after IB/Bal and go SPGY into north south bunkers then aids then Van and it’s usually 20-25 minute wins. Snowfall isn’t useless.  
---
No. Ice block doesn't change your threat level, it just makes the mob not attack you for the duration.
---
It's not a joke. It is guaranteed that Blizzard has all the data of all its versions.
---
What are you talking about? They've said they have a lot of data from older patches. How do you think they can do release the content release plan they are doing if they didn't?
---
So still no actual *single* example of a place they hold reasonable viability? Okay, that's what I thought.
---
The problem is in the specs not fulfilling their intended role correctly. Enh is supposed to be offtank/melee dps comprable to a fury warrior that gives aura buffs. Ret is supposed to be melee/holy spell hybrid damage with some utility. Balance is supposed to be able to cast more than 6 spells before needing to drink. None of these specs are in the same ballpark as others in any area of the game. All hybrids are viable in all aspects of the game, but only as healers. Sure, druids and pally's can tank some dungeons or get carried in a raid as an offtank. Sure, Elemental shamans can burst you in pvp and a BIS geared, legitimate PRO feral can powershift his way into the middle of the dps pack on a raid boss.
---
The three original specs I mentioned have no place they excel or even perform in the 50th percentile in. At any stage of leveling or gearing. A person of equal skill, with equal gear, and on any comparable class or spec will beat them in any aspect of the game 100% of the time, guaranteed. 
---
The problem is your baseless claims that everything is fine and holds a place, with no evidence to support it. You can't even give me anecdotal evidence
---
Ret pallies got there comeup w/ AQ gear, and could do well enough in PvP to be a threat.
---
Yes but does he have a shield ? :)
---
Are you looking for the [Classy Friday](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=classy+friday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) threads?
---
In high end PvE it is first and foremost about your main/boss-tank. Your tank is the 'carry' of a raid or group because...
---
* influences positioning the most
---
* possible DPS is capped by the TPS of your tank (see gear check bosses)
---
* only your tank(s) can even dream of surviving boss aggro
---
* the survivability of your tank is *your* survivability
---
This is the reason why every good guild will heavily funnel gear into your most active (main) tank.
---
Secondarily come your healers. Because they keep everyone alive while bosses/adds/trash will dish out damage that would otherwise rip your group/raid apart in seconds. Also healers have the most difficult job:
---
* their mana magement is way more difficult and important than any other class
---
* they need to be attentive/reactive to incomming damage, movement etc.
---
* they are skill-expressive: the difference between a good and a bad healer is much bigger than between a good and bad DPS
---
* the better your players overall, the less healers you have to bring because each of them can carry more weight.
---
DPS are the *least* important factor, because they have the simplest job for the vast majority of encounters. A well equiped DPS player can speed things up a bit, but will often be limited by the tanks and healers. It is much easier to find a servicable mage/rogue than a priest/druid etc. Your group/raid damage output matters, yes, but that just naturally goes up as you bring the right specs and gear pieces and has little to do with player ability.
---
Is there a list of blue gear, epic gear and what spec they suit the most and comparison to tier? 
---
the husband and i REALLY want to no life it but being adults with responsibilities really gets in the way of our game time T\_T we'll do our best to get a few days off though. good luck getting a decent amount of game time! 
---
Is the version we are getting that middle groun? That is my question. I didnt play a lot of AV in vanilla so I dont know much about the changes it got. 
---
You know what's terrible game design? Two raid teams of 40 players zooming past each other and racing to see who kills the PvE boss first.
---
You can literally have that exact experience on retail right now. Fuck off. 
---
Yeah, the tank is the most important by far. Especially in TBC and vanilla where threat is such a challenge 
---
So they're going with the good version of AV where you actually fight other players instead of NPCs(If i wanted to fight NPCs I wouldn't be in a BG in the first place)
---
And this is the version before they added reinforcements which is what really turned AV into a race.
---
Because one is greater than three?
---
I saved up an extra 4 vacation days from 2018 that I carried over to this year so I could take some extra time off once Classic launches so I can jumpstart my way to 60.  
---
Time of work? Maybe a friday or monday to make weekend longer. Other than that ill just start drinking redbull instead of sleeping.
---
Also, the original version of Korrak spawned 2 hours into the BG right in the middle. So to kill him, usually one side would turtle and then around the 2 hour mark everyone would camp mid far enough away from each other to not fight and try to tag Korrak. They would then kite him back to their npcs at the gy and the other faction couldn't keep up due to all the super powerful NPCs that would be up. Multi-hour AV is fun once, and then becomes something you /afk out of as soon as you realizing that the game is going that direction.
---
It's probably getting delayed or launched really late summer at this point. I don't anticipate a date announcement anytime soon - every post they make makes it sound like they still have a good ways to go and is very limited in information. 
---
&gt; The objective point of Classic is to be the most authentic Vanilla experience, so nothing about retail needs to be altered
---
Better get your windows XP and shitty addons ready. Don't forget the long ass server queue times.
---
We don't yet know whether or not we will be getting the updated PvP sets at launch or at a later phase so it's difficult to say precisely.
---
Disappointing to hear, at the VERY least it needs to be pre-1.11 thats what completely killed AV and made it into the PvE race that it was. And what I hate most is the justification used, NPCs "brought down to a reasonable level", theyre not, theyre at an extremely inadequate level where they can be ignored and the bosses can be rushed. Bonus honor and rep are broken in 1.12, I really hope something changes, I dont want to see every single Warrior/Paladin/Shaman running around with TuF and every melee/Hunter with a Don Julio's a week after hitting 60.
---
If you don't see the difference between encouraging good behavior and telling people off for bad behavior, I'm not sure what to tell you.
---
Why not just quit you job and focus on whats important!
---
&gt; Something so late in is barely Vanilla
---
[The 1.11 version was on live servers for the 2nd longest time of all versions of AV pre Burning Crusade.  Only beaten by 1.8 version by 1 day.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b2zg97/alterac_valley_in_classic/eiw7xni/)
---
this sucks, i wanted pre 1.8 AV, full map without so much removed. Right now we're getting the retail map.
---
ffxi private servers are better
---
Thanks man!!
---
The team running Classic has proved time and again they have our best interests in mind. They would not drop the ball on the biggest PvP map we'll have. Most of the confusion people have are (probably) because of 1: bad memory; or 2) private server hodgepodge nonsense.
---
I fucking love this so much. People have gone crazy with #NoChanges but the second they announce no changes from 1.12 people bitch and moan.
---
It's not a problem; just prioritize getting spellpower gear over Int gear and you won't have such a huge mana pool to refi- OH WAIT.
---
orc warrior because its either play whats over populated or be irrelevant
---
&gt; I’m cool accepting that the goal needs to be in between both but that’s where being understanding of other people’s goals is a two way street
---
I completely agree, yet this entire thing is about people wanting to make it a one-way street instead with their "memememe" retail wow attitude.
---
But what can you tank? U speak of 5-10 man's, some boss raid but show us in a video 
---
Well considering git was released in 2005, it might not be guaranteed. Neither of us can confirm or deny how blizzard works with old game data files.
---
Pretty similar story for me man, I heard about it a week ago, and man I’ve got the bug again bad to relive the old days with a real MMO community. Can’t wait to get started :). 
---
My opinion on AV's design really got you mad enough to tell me to F off?  Get off the internet kid
---
If you think sharding is not a major reason as to why people hate retail, you dont know WoW whatsoever
---
I'm guessing by your Okay you disagree. That being said you might be right about that. If you are Alliance you may actually enjoy this rigged shit fest of a bg. As a horde player though. Well you know there is a reason blizz had to bribe us with Unstoppable force and, it's no because blizzard created a good bg. 1.12.1 Av is a rigged pile of shit. I am not going to rage at blizz about it because at the end of the day it's just one bg. That being said. It's actual garbage.
---
Except that all abilities are database based. They already covered this. Databases are very rarely version controlled.
---
You dont have to stay in AV for 3 days, you can leave and come back. That was the way AV was designed, you werent meant to just burn through it fast. Join in, see whats up, help out, get some kills and rep, leave at some point. Old AV rep and honor was in line with the other BGs, 1.12 AV is broken as shit.
---
Pretty much but I loved watching him gather the whole place and smash everything at once. He seemed like a god when I was starting out.
---
who the frick asked for 1.12, 1.8 removed so much stuff...anything after that is garbage
---
&gt; 260 enchanting is temporary and can be dropped as soon as you craft the trinket.
---
Wait so after I craft it I can drop the profession? Will I be able to freely take on and off the trinket?
---
Oh Bobos...
---
They could implement the first iteration but the bg will still be rushed, the problem is not AV per se, the problem is that the players are now far different than 15 years ago.
---
Indeed the AV race didn't start until they added reinforcements.  Up until then there were plenty of long games, all it takes is a few people playing D and bam.
---
i definitely did both of these things lol. its super important to always hearth back for the rested exp and get a jump on those long fps \^\^
---
I opted to keep going with this, but didn't want to bloat my totally-relevant post, so while this is relevant, it does go wandering a bit.  That said, if you're interested, you're interested, so, here we go.  Other dates of interest:
---
5/22/07 - 2.1.0, Fishing removed from AV.
---
11/13/07 - 2.3.0, AV revamp.
---
3/25/08 - 2.4.0, AV balance updates.
---
10/14/08 - 3.0.2, Wrath pre-patch.
---
4/14/09 - 3.1.0, health update, the only AV change in Wrath.
---
So why'd I go and figure out dates in TBC and Wrath?  Well I was curious, so here's the results:
---
If we consider the pre-patches for expansions as different versions of AV:
---
|Patch:|Date Released:|Days on Patch:|
---
|:-|:-|:-|
---
|1.5|6/7/05|125|
---
|1.8|10/10/05|169|
---
|1.10|3/28/06|84|
---
|1.11|6/20/06|168|
---
|2.0|12/5/06|168|
---
|2.1|5/22/07|175|
---
|2.3|11/13/07|133|
---
|2.4|3/25/08|203|
---
|3.0|10/14/08|182|
---
|3.1|4/14/09|Who cares?|
---
Whadda ya know!  Vanilla longest patch on AV is 169 days (1.8), and in TBC, it's 203 (2.4).
---
The change in 2.1?  Oh, fishing was removed from AV, and obviously there'd been an added level bracket during 2.0.
---
So, 2.0 was kind of some minor changes.  Not none, being very clear about that, but I was curious, what happens if we kind of... erase 2.0 and 2.1 from the list?  Classes changed, to be sure, but AV didn't besides some minor things.  To be fair, let's remove 3.0 -- it just added another level bracket as well.
---
|1.11|6/20/06|511|
---
|2.4|3/25/08|385|
---
Oh hey!  It looks like the version of AV that was active in 1.12 was the one most present in -TBC- as well.
---
Clearly the last chart ignores class changes, but for those who say they started during TBC -- sorry to say, but you may not be seeing anything really new beyond different class abilities.
---
How do mob movement patterns effect kiting? I stopped during TBC and only briefly played Cata well after the fact. 
---
Even then they aren’t viable to be a good enough tank for raids in most boss fights
---
It's because OP copy-pasted the original fitness plan which is based on mistakes raiders can make in the latest raid. The planking one is originally "Die to Mekkatorque" (the third last boss in Battle for Dazar'alor, which generally you can only die to individually if you do something stupid).
---
The majority of the pserver crowd I'd imagine.  From what I've read, they seem to widely agree that 1.12 was the best start point because of progressive content. 
---
any sources to back that up?
---
More like blood DK 1-man tanking.  I remember those early days where with decent gear a blood DK could solo almost all non-heroic instances.
---
Typical. Can't debate the substance because you know you'd lose, so you hard focus on the style
---
Haha, as a tank, I had random healers who had me on friends list, I was out doing some stuff, suddenly a whisper from a random "wanna tank X?", I was confused, "Who are you again?", "Oh you tanked Y yesterday, I was the healer, thought I would add you".
---
This is what I am looking forward to the most tbh. I consider myself a social person, but I don't like hunting for guilds, and communities to join. I mean, if there is an established group of friends forming a guild, it is usually incredibly hard to be accepted in their circle.
---
So I would rather build up my own friends circle, and these interactions in pugs are the best way for me to do it. Whenever I played on a private server, I always ended up with at least half a dozen people on my friends list, before I reached max level! On retail, this is just not possible anymore :( (I don't have experience with M+ dungeons yet, maybe those are better in this aspect).
---
I mean, its an easy justification to rollback instead of doing an honor/rep nerf. They just have to justify it and say out loud that the rewards are far too powerful for how easy they are to obtain in 1.12 AV
---
On private servers I've played on people just run to bunkers then kill the bosses.  Usually 5ish total players, usually mages and rogues, try to recap graveyards and towers.  
---
I'd love to avoid that, but doing so would require Blizzad to rework AV.  People here would freak out over that too (because "no changes") so it's a tough call.  The original AV's were really tedious and I can't see people actually enjoying them long term if that version made it's way into the real game.
---
Personally I think it's people's nostalgia getting the better of them.
---
Getting 2 shot by bowmen is though
---
I know most of the die hard classic fans are going oppose this but if a class with a dps spec cant compete with other classes then there is a major flaw
---
AV is a pve on race on every private server and Classic will be no different. 
---
DUN DUN DUN DUHNUNHNUNHDNANANANIN NUNUNNHNNANANHNNA 
---
You are free to feel this way. That being said as a horde player. No thanks I will take my epic week long battle. Over a rigged pile of shit where I just mindless run forward in a race to try to win a rigged game. 1.12.1 is the worst bg in classic hands down. It offers nothing unique while being completely rigged and shitty. 1.15.1 Av may have had problems but I used to actually play that one back in the day it was fun. It was different. I would rather have no AV. and it's rewards linked to something else over 1.12.1 av. That being said it's just one bg and not a deal breaker for me.
---
When I travel between quests in contested zones I'm usually stealthed to avoid the high number of ganking level 60s. Any alliance I see get a /drool;/cleartarget;/hungry as I sneak past. I've no intention of ganking them unless they show up on my KoS list, but it's fun to watch them panic nonetheless.
---
From a very basic perspective this is true, but in terms of gear and skill requirement there is much more weight on tanks and healers.
---
they really need to announce soon, its already almost april O\_O 
---
Yeah, I have a feeling private servers fucked up when they had this encounter respawn. I don’t remember having any trouble during retail, but the Darkmaster haunts my dreams now that I played private server. 
---
&gt; Old AV rep and honor
---
The honor was absolutely not in line with WSG or AB for pushing ranks
---
Well I certainly didn't.  I was a mage.  I ported to whichever city I felt like logged out in; I didn't have to wait for my hearthstone to come of CD like a filthy pleb.  
---
-_-
---
Warlocks will tank Twins Emperor in AQ40 with 300+ shadow resist
---
NE Druid, why? it will be my main. I will then log out and make my personal bank. Then make the 2 Guild Bank Alts, then make my Lock alt for summoning
---
I mean, you say that, but its not even about min/maxers, its about all the people that want instant gratification rewards, which is what I thought was one of the major reasons people wanted Classic in the first place.
---
They could re-create the old data, the quests are stored online you can find the npc's in wowhead, as for the object placement you can do some guesswork there, the general layout of the troll's village and gnolls camp + syndicate cave are known.
---
&gt;The team running Classic has proved time and again they have our best interests in mind. They would not drop the ball on the biggest PvP map we'll have.
---
This is what I also think. As for now I am happy with their decisions.
---
&gt;1: bad memory;
---
I pledge guilty of this one. Luckily I have no private server AV experience so this cannot confuse me. Only my memory can confuse me. :-)
---
I've read about 95-99% of all posts with more than two upvotes in the last year. I'm jones'n man....
---
If you want to dps, why does it need to be a ret paladin? Pick a class for the roll you want, don't try to force a class to do what you want. Want melee dps? Rogue, Warrior. Want ranged dps? Mage, lock, hunter. Plenty of choices to fit your goal of dps. 
---
The fine tuning doesn't have to happen to paladin, it has to do with your choices.
---
Nah man, most of those warriors are going to want to DPS and will refuse to tank, most of the ones that will go prot will be terrible tanks, and even more won't even hit level cap.
---
lol truth. We just ran warrior tanks all day every day 
---
what about the gnolls and the trolls
---
I quit AV because of this long before tbc was released. Everyone just rushed. No fun in that zone anymore. Was a PvE Battleground with a timer against the other faction.
---
Ah thank you, that's the fight I was thinking of.
---
Wait, I thought this was the sub that didn't believe in all that "rose-tinted goggles" nonsense...
---
The change one, change all argument is not always applicable. Retribution is so bad in dps it needs the boost to compete with others. 
---
I’m not saying for them to make a huge overhaul but to increase their dps in any way whether in maces or somewhere that it won’t affect the actual play style
---
Oh yeah, you'll be farming it....from the last boss.....of a massive dungeon. But trust me, it's worth it.
---
&gt; Things like going fishing are pretty important to me, and i'd rather not feel 'obligated' to choose between the two.
---
Minnesotan here.  Considering the setups I've seen people have in their ice houses for ice fishing, I'm sure you'd be able to bring a laptop/tablet and conjure some wi-fi on the lake so you could fish and level at the same time.  
---
we are gonna get RIPPED
---
Agreed, as someone who joined in wrath and always heard about vanilla I always heard of how big a battle AV was and I personally was looking forward to it. I liked the idea of wintergrasp and having a big battle in an instanced zone seemed awesome contrast from the other 2.
---
Whereas 1.12 AV was never fun for anyone, just a grind for fast rewards that are far too powerful for the time it takes to get them.
---
I guess I was the only one that read his post then...
---
--"I'm a very competitive person (min/max type) and as much as I love WoW I'm not sure I could play it "casually""--
---
Obviously you can do the whole game very casually, I levelled to 60 just before xmas on ND which was like 6 months after release. Gave up almost immediately tho because I didn't have time for 3 hour dungeons, never mind raiding, but the 1-60 journey was very enjoyable.
---
Fuck
---
The only change is increasing dps potential, play style will be intact. 
---
I wish. Real life these days ... will definitely give it a few 3 day weekends the first month though!
---
Just because they made changes doesnt mean any of them were any good.
---
No it was frequently up. The difficulty was getting a spot in the BG.
---
No offense, but you guys are out of your fucking minds. Rescheduling your entire life to play the re-release of a soon to be 15 year old game is mental. Classic will be here to stay, unchanged, for a very long time with no sudden end to the experience like a new expansion release. Have fun though.
---
Sounds like you probably won't like Vanilla. Don't get me wrong - I would be totally down for post naxx content and they could change up the meta by adding gear or something along those lines, but they shouldn't be outright re-balancing specs for Classic. It goes against the entire project.
---
Why are you not using your last talent point? it's 29/11/11 30/0/21. 
---
I agree with everything you said. I think a selling point for druids would be that you can raid and PvP with the same spec(s). As a shaman you'll be expected to bring mana tide totem if you're raiding. So at least for a while after hitting 60 you'll be a cloth wearing resto shaman. It isn't until late MC/early BWL/pvp gear you can start playing elemental. Respec costs in classic will most likely be 50g so you need to keep that in mind if you plan to play elemental shaman and decide if you're ready to raid, PvP and pay 100 gold every week doing it. 
---
They will get the honor of fighting alongside 39 other players to defeat a monster in the hopes that gear will drop that they will have the privilege of perhaps winning. 
---
I have some old screenshots somewhere of a RET Paladin telling me that they were going to come to my raid and they were going to DPS. I informed them they were recruited as a healer and thus would be healing or not coming. Nope, they told me they were going to DPS and I /Gkicked them right then and there. 
---
completely agree!! Or working from home, can't imagine not having that option haha
---
So is full arcane mage. No one plays it in pve. If your favourite build is bad and gets buffed others will demand change of their favourite builds. And so on and on. To think ret paladin is the only build that doesn't provide very well in pve is just plain wrong.
---
Holy shit someone got my reference even with the poor spelling lol. Also yeas.
---
I'm very glad with the change. It is not the changes to the map that change the way it is played, it is the changes to the players. You can rest assured that opening weekend for AV you will have your 40 on 40 bloodbaths because that is what everyone is going to want. You can also rest assured that months/years later, when the novelty has worn off, you will actually be able to finish games without pounding your face on ridiculously tuned over-abundant NPCs.
---
You don’t see how ridiculous that is?? Wtf lol
---
You’re implying that I just miss out on raids as retribution until everyone is done.
---
Don’t project
---
haha, right on I got you now.
---
I dont get that mentality at all. Seems weird to queue for something and then want it to be over asap.
---
Ignoring \#NoChanges it's a hard topic for me, because on one hand I get that losing rank because of an accidental dhk, on the other I've seen what the removal of dhks have done to some pservers.
---
Everyone hates 1.12 AV so much that they get exalted quickly and never play it again. People would give AV a try all the time before the NPCs were nerfed.
---
If horde caps snowfall then AVs would last for hours in TBC. 
---
Didn't Nostalrius use 1.12 model? We had AVs lasting for hours there too. 
---
ALTS
---
What you're missing here is a hidden nerf to the NPC's from TBC though. The NPC's scaled absolutely pathatically in TBC, making them only marginally stronger than they were at level 60. 1.12 NPC's are weak, but in TBC they were a complete joke.
---
Regardless though, I simply want an earlier version due to the amount of content removed in later versions, such as the Shredder or the Mine Layers. The buffed NPC's are nice too however, as NPC's such as the riders were actually major.
---
It's not current zone. At least not from what I remember in classic. It will move you to another zone if that zones gy is closer. Could be wrong but I have a memory of being super mad I died in the barrens one time and resed in Ashenvale. Could be faulty memory though. We are talking 15 years ago lol.
---
Wall walking was killed in vanilla. Look up “the last wall walk” by Dopefish.
---
As for the time, that's why raiding guilds are great. Having a scheduled time where you can get on 15 min before and know you'll be playing and not sitting around is crucial for people without a lot of free time.
---
In the demo that was released for the Blizzcon mobs moved differently from what I've heard. They somewhat predicted the pathing of the moving character, therefore were able to keep up with the warrior to hit him once more even though he was moving away rendering the shortrange kiting useless.
---
I will be incredibly disappointed if the version of AV we get is the fast/base rush variant. Long, epic, multiple hour/sometimes day long games of AV are part of my favourite memories from Vanilla. They were a large contributing factor to my excitement to play Classic and I will feel let down if it’s the short version we get. Play WSG/AB if you want to finish a game in 20mins. AV should feel like an epic battle. 
---
not everybody has to be good at everything mate
---
We do not know. They have not said anything.
---
If its coming out in June, I would be ecstatic to play! Summer time BBQ with some Classic, go swimming and tan and come back to Classic would be amazing.
---
If its Sept. I'd be devasted as I wouldnt have nearly as much time to play the game. And its alot longer to wait
---
#JunePls
---
I don't think we will see av rushing until a few weeks or months after av is released. Even if there are many who want to do rush strat there will be too many who are unaware, or doing their own thing, or don't want to rush.
---
It will take time for the masses to devolve into av rushing.
---
It's possible but some planning is required as you most likely need drops from dungeons and those give exp. That means paying a 60 to run you through. All said and done with enchants you can spend at least 300-500 gold depending on server prices and maturity.
---
N O.  C H A N G E S.
---
I'm curious if there are some server-side things that can't be authentically replicated and thus simply aren't going to be. Maybe it's one area they don't want to do guesswork because the 1.12 version is still "sufficient". If memory serves the actual 1.12 version wasn't the same zerg-fest it is today.
---
Not at all since I dont want to ruin my own experience
---
I always did that stuff. 
---
Lame. Thanks for the reply =)  
---
gl hf
---
wasn't sure if you were referencing Venture Bros at first lol
---
&gt;What you're missing here is a hidden nerf to the NPC's from TBC though.
---
Curses!  I was not aware of that, as I was just skimming patch notes and my memory of TBC AV is a bit murky these days.  Still, the idea I was trying to communicate is that we're getting a version of the game (even if the scaling was terrible) that was, mechanically, still used for the majority of TBC, meaning everyone who wants to see something different... well, it's not going to be -all- that different.
---
I hope Blizz reconsiders, as they did with progressive gearing, and gives us a more 'Vanilla' experience, with all the various complexities of one of the earlier versions.
---
care to give more information about what kind of gear you should get to maximize your kitty burst dps(or burst dps as a druid in general)? I want to play feral druid in PVP focused around hitting hard with an initial burst crit, setting up some bleeds, then shifting into bear to tank them if they're melee or running away with travel form and roots to do it again a few seconds later. leveraging the druid's survivability to escape and do hit and run guerilla tactics if that makes sense. is that even possible/viable?
---
Well it was the 1.11 patch that nerfed it, but my server didnt see the races start until 1.12 when xrealm BGs hit. The established meta was a big pushfest, but people slowly started to learn that rushing could now work. When Xrealms hit, the rush strat became common knowledge and spread quickly. Every AV I played was a rush, where the main raids on each side would be on opposite sides of the map. Maybe you didnt play too much AV that late into Vanilla, but it was certainly the only AV matches I saw post Xrealms.
---
lol, i dont ice fish.  i need to be able to move around when i fish, whether thats in the kayak or walking a river.
---
They are calling it Classic because it is a classic edition of the game. It isn't called "World of Warcraft: As released in 2004 with all changes exactly how they were completely untouched".
---
There is still AV, there are a lot of NPCs, Korak being gone isn't a gamebreaking change and anyone who is threatening to not sub over it (as others here have) are never going to be happy with what Blizzard puts out.
---
If they released AV as it was in 1.5 Korak still wouldn't be there. They aren't removing AV but rather they made a decision to use the most polished version of the battleground as it was in 2005-2006. It would be great if everything was 1:1 but if we want the game to ever get released there needs to be compromises made.
---
Vanilla lasted over 2 years, Korak was in the game for less than 6 months.
---
It’s only 80 players. As long as there are 40 people on each side who want to try it, then who cares what the remainder of the server population thinks?
---
If the sever pop cap is 3000, then you need less than 3% of players to want to run AV to have a full game. That’s not bad.
---
Blizz explicitly said they were going to start off of 1.12 because it was the most representative patch of era. If this patch is "barely vanilla" then why are you even bothering about playing classic?
---
Perhaps you can answer this for me:
---
Do the current Pserver iterations use the original map, before the Horde base was moved back? Or is it basically the current retail version populated with all the old stuffs?
---
Dishonorable kills are a shit stain on the overall state of the game.
---
They existed shortly after BG's were put in and immediately removed in the TBC pre-patch.  They should not be a part of Classic.
---
Grinding rep, quicker games gave more rep so the idea was to finish them as soon as possible. Eventually people would just leave the long ones and hope to get in one of the fast cycles going on. I played classic for 2 years and my memory of people's opinion of AV is very different to what people here were saying. 
---
Sounds like maybe classic wont be for you or at very least not that class.  
---
Get friends and kill him?
---
originally i started alliance but i very quickly switched to horde and would like to stay horde for classic, but in the end it depends on what my group wants to play. if we play horde i'm gonna start with an orc lock but alt a tauren (obv) druid. if i have to play alliance i'll play gnome lock and alt nelf druid. they're my favorite classes (even after all this time) and i am looking forward to playing through classic as them once more. 
---
Damn they stretched that out for 10 minutes lol
---
In the same boat here. Gonna take it slow with classic. Think this is the most enjoyable and healthy way to play the game which also increases the longevity of the game for me. I had very limited time to play videogames from november-january and only played some single player games instead of WoW. I wanted to return to the game like 2 weeks after the new season started in january and every single item I had equipped or stored in my bag was absolutely worthless. From mid August-November 2018 I grinded an ilvl of 384, with the new season the most casual players who barely manage to complete m+5 keys were had ilvl 400+ in every single slot days after the new season started. Months of farming wiped out overnight on patch day. WTF
---
Classic will be here to stay, unchanged, for a very long time with no sudden gear resetting patches and no end to the experience like a new expansion release. There is absolutely no need to rush anything in classic.
---
I think most people are unhappy about this, but readers are fatigued and just want to play. 
---
Still, it's obvious that Blizzard is cherry picking what content to include as a matter of convenience, not quality. The only raid will be Molten Core, but it's the nerfed version. The only battleground might be AV, but it's the nerfed version.
---
If they're going to do a gated release of content, then all of the juicy parts that made that content shine need to be included. AV needs to be the **real** Alterac Valley. Ragnaros needs to be the **real** Ragnaros.
---
There's a lot more information yet to come but I have a bad feeling that 1.13 is going to be a bone dry frankenstein patch with too many unfit pieces jammed together.
---
I'll grab my level 13s and go after him. Mount up boys.
---
Not sure I follow your point in this context, shaman is still second most played
---
well the devs were always going to have to make some decisions on this front. Hopefully people will come to understand that not every single person can be pleased
---
Depends on class, bracket, and how strong you want them to be.
---
Also depends highly on server economy. Could be 50g bis without enchants for a class, or 1200g.
---
Wrath had a lot of great aspects, but the addition of the LFG system was to me a big indicator of wows future as more of an instance q-hub simulator than a real world. Today it is neither an mmo, nor an rpg imo (more of an action game honestly). 
---
So yeah, agreed on the raid finder breaking the community aspect and effectively ruining the mmo of the game. There is no way that is present in classic (if it is i wont be anyways), and so i do think the community could return - especially with how hyped it is.
---
You're right, this is just off memory. I never main'd that spec in classic back in the day. It's one I'm looking forward to. 
---
This sucks, I was looking forward to the long battles again.
---
Sure I did that all the time... although it usually ended up with me looking at the clock and realizing 3 more hours had passed...
---
I'm waiting for the release date to be announced and I'm taking my entire two months off for the fiscal year starting that day.
---
the 20's agi cape is 25-30g, the butcher 10g or so, crusader 40-80g i forget exactly, libram enchants 100g each.
---
&gt; and killing opposing players no longer drops items like Dwarf Spines, Orc Teeth, or Human Bone Chips. Gross.
---
Anyone else feel like this greatly demonstrates how out-of-touch Blizzard is what comes to RPG elements and flavor that people *want* to see in an MMORPG game?
---
That's not gross, it's fucking amazing.
---
Content creators salivating at every blue post
---
And my memory is not the best either, but I do know that a vast majority of my AV experience was post-1.10 and most of my AVs were Turtle Power. I'm sure there will rushing, but I believe it will be minimal compared to HK farming. Besides, if that's what people really want to do (as it appears that's the case from what we're reading here) then that's exactly what they'll do.
---
i LOVE THESE! thank you so much \^\_\^
---
To be fair the people on private servers who are getting to 60 and playing AV and risking losing all their hardwork due to it beinf a pserver are in general way more hardcore than the general pop thats going to be trying classic. A lot of people just want to have that epic feeling of a giant battle. Personally it feels like being a foot soldier in W3 and I love it.
---
So I take it you want HKs to deteoriate at 25% per kill and to have to form your own groups at the start of a BG as well. Along with that you have a tighter Honour System making it harder to rank. 
---
Be careful with the all or nothing authenticity statements.
---
&gt; AV but rather they made a decision to use the most ~~polished~~ version
---
more streamlined version rendering most of the mechanics completely null and void, great decision. 
---
If you're coming from retail then I completely understand why you think that, because in the context of retail you're right.  In retail, you are your spec, in vanilla you're a class.
---
As a Druid player, my spec doesn't matter.  Only two talents in the entire feral tree make me more tanky.  My gear is what allows me to tank.  Swap on some +healing and bam I'm resto with marginal losses of healing capabilities compared to a specced resto.
---
Now imagine being a Paladin that can DPS like a rogue, be much harder to kill than a Warrior and heals well enough for 5mans without changing gear.   It's op.
---
They said they would use 1.12 as the base of vanilla. Having 1.12 makes sense. Why are people shocked?
---
I would give them a piece of advice: play a useful spec or reroll.  
---
When your guild gets raids on farm its fine to loosen up and let your hunters tank core hounds in MC, but during progression you should be contributing.
---
I'm not very knowledgeable about Paladins. What are Ret Paladins *good* at? If they're good at something then I'm perfectly fine with them being bad at raiding.
---
No way they are putting BG's at phase 1 if blizzard's main concern is that pvp rewards are stronk.
---
&gt;also stuck wearing lame dresses
---
SO WHY I ASK, THIS DOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE
---
i do this sometimes too \^\_\^ its oddly soothing 
---
Yes sir! Thank you kindly
---
wasn't sure if you were referencing Venture Bros at first lol. I was lol.
---
Secondly I am sorry but you edit means you will haved to be resed. No chin having filth will be allowed in my forsaken army. Back to being a human with you lol.
---
Depends. I may be getting a new job and if that's the case I can't take off right as I get it which would suck. I'd also have to move out of state which would take lots of time away from WoW.
---
If I end up staying at my current job and not moving I'm taking a week off and playing 10+ hours a day that week. When I go back to work I'm playing at least 2 hours a night during the week, 4-6 hours on Saturday, and 8-10 hours on Sunday. 
---
Yes. You can tank. Good job! Nobody is going to let you tank a full raid, though. Maybe as an afterthought after MC is fully farmed and the GM wants to “let that shaman who has been asking for months to tank MC.” Outside of that, you won’t be tanking raid bosses, and nobody is going to take you seriously. The requirements here are obnoxious. I’m sorry, but cmon man, lets be real.
---
What about sharding?  This game mechanic seems to break the feel of the game and the community for me.
---
Again, another conundrum.  How do you stop servers from dying and manage horde/alliance balance, without sharding.  The guys you play with should be on your same server 24/7, and you shouldnt be allowed to talk to the other faction.  
---
I completely disagree, especially if the groups they're joining continuously fail to complete the content they want to tackle.
---
You just shadowmelted my heart
---
Druid is normally the least played class. However I think Druid will be played more in Classic than in vanilla. I feel like with the ability to do 2 or 3 roles with a single spec I think Druid will have bit more because of this.
---
I was wary at first, but the more I've looked into it, I'm getting more excited.  I've heard a druid who's proficient at changing roles to fill gaps is generally considered better than one who masters a single role.
---
&gt; sources
---
Basic mathematics.
---
AV was added to the game on June 7, 2005 (1.5).
---
AV was heavily reworked in Oct 10, 2005 (1.8). 
---
Unless you played AV in that 4-month window, you didn't experience the original AV. Vanilla was picking up new players, and dropping them, throughout its lifespan. 
---
Vanilla had ~4 million active subs through Q3 2005. Many of those players, especially in EU, did not even hit 51 by that point.
---
It had 8.5 million active subs through Q1, 2007 (1.12)
---
Assuming that not a single person unsubbed through the lifetime of Vanilla (Which is, of course, bonkers, as playerbase churn was &gt;50% through Vanilla's lifespan), there were 4.5 million players who joined AFTER AV was heavily reworked. And there were only 4 million players who were active before the rework.
---
Realistically, between not hitting 51, starting late, and player churn, less then 20% of the Vanilla playerbase played the original AV.
---
This version of Av was around for over 6 months. Thats pretty vanilla wow. Chill out nerd. 
---
Why no jawless female models though...
---
Most likely exact copies of original realm list.
---
Aye, but I was saying no need to overhaul just to "make AV competative" because that was not what the BG was designed to be. For that honor grinding mentality WSG was the play.
---
It would be interesting to modify the HK decay system but in the end I don't see a problem to be fixed. AV was there to be experienced as an epic battle with a shifting front-line depending on Reaver rushes, armor upgrades, Lok, etc - over the course of hours or more. Fighting the enemy was one of the best parts of AV since it was on such a huge scale and you were penned-in, almost forced to do battle. It's amusing you mention turtling as delaying the inevitable, when I've witnessed quite a few matches swing back and forth multiple times over a day, before the underdog ends up winning.
---
Those were incredible. And those matches were also ones where some would describe as "boring" and "a huge waste of time" but they were also some of the most epic moments in videogames I've experienced where you have both sides in almost full BWL+ epic gear and it's down to 30~ seconds when one group has Drek at 10% and they lose. And everyone screams and yells and queues up again drenched in nerd sweat hoping this one is just as hectic.
---
A bad tank means your going to have a bad time. S bad healer means the tanks gonna have a bad time.  A bad dps just makes things slower or causes wipes of they don’t cc properly. 
---
The biggest omission as a result of this for most players will be that the frost damage wand from Korrak won't be available anymore.
---
I think that is more of the definition of what people call the "try-hards" then people who min/max. 
---
I feel like the majority of min/max people do the research to see what is out there and then weigh that with what is practical for their play styles.  A player trying to min/max may be happy with the 2nd or 3rd BiS item because obtaining the #1 BiS might be more effort for a tiny upgrade then the player deems worth it.
---
A min/max player will understand their role and "rotation", will optimize their talents for their role (Raid/PvP), and have knowledge of what gear is "best" for their class/role vs the effort to obtain the item. They will use consumables that are on hand, but might not be obsessed about using them for \*Every\* fight, just when it seems like consumables could make a difference in the fight.
---
You could want to play in an optimal way, without being a nit-picking elitist.
---
To be honest what I would really prefer is to play TBC again. The end game in TBC was phenomenal. So many great raids and dungeons, plus all the vanilla leveling was still slow and hard enough. Combine that with pretty much all class specs feeling decent, and general class fantasy and breadth still being a thing, it really was the time where I felt like you could do or be anything. Arenas and BGs felt a lot more fun. Item sets and tiers were dope. Raids were hard -- for a casual raiding guild that took the whole xpac to clear everything, progression was slow and satisfying, and improved you as a player. 
---
But, I understand why we will probably not get that from blizzard ever, and I get why people are more nostalgic for classic. 
---
I am very much of the belief that slight intelligent changes should be made to vanilla so as to make the game better at delivering what vanilla was trying to deliver. After all, 1.12 was still basically a beta game in many ways, there was a lot of stuff the devs planned or wanted to fix or still implement, but they decided to just defer it to TBC. 
---
Which is why if I think of the perfect game, it's probably more towards the TBC end of things. 
---
But I am willing to do into this with an open mind and just experience classic and see where it takes me. If I can goof around in SM or deadmines with some friends, that will be well worth it for me.
---
This OP did not play vanilla. Heh.
---
I was like this for months and months. Finally got tired of the cyclical conversations and kinda stopped coming here *as* frequently (I still do, obviously). Got hooked on autochess &amp; apex legends, I'm so glad to finally have games I'm into again. I was planning on WC3 Reforged holding me over till Classic, but it seems like that may be coming out after classic at this point -_- seems to defeat the whole point to me.
---
They added those same rewards to the Van/Drek quest even before they removed Korrak, so you could get the rewards twice. I got my IBS on my Paladin in 1.9 without ever even seeing Korrak.
---
Except that this isn't the case and AVs still could last hours in this iteration of the game. The way AV will be played will depend on how players want it to be played. If your team is there for a brawl a game can easily last hours. If your goal is to run past like a bitch games will last 30 minutes.
---
The reality is that AV wasn't a "last 3 days" event for the majority of Vanilla. I know people wish this were the case but we can't just rewrite history to relive those things.
---
I loved those games, I would leave for school at 7am and come home 8 hours later to queue into the exact same game but we have known Blizzards general philosophy since day 1. Their goal is to create an authentic vanilla experience but that it won't be 1:1 like it was in actual vanilla. 
---
Classic, just like Private Servers, isn't Vanilla and until people can understand that they are going to be perpetually disappointed.
---
15 minutes? I used to go to bed early and wake up 2-3 hours before school just so that I could get a level or two. My friend group was none-the-wiser when they all were jealous of “how efficiently” i leveled. Little did they know, while they were sleeping I was grinding my ass off!
---
Make one for Gnome vs Human for Mage🙃
---
This big [list](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/axl5zw/the_big_list_of_wow_classic_resources/) of resources perhaps? 
---
Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. DKP is superior because it takes power out of the hands of the ruling class. 
---
On my server you only had access to AV on the AV weekends
---
This isn't 2004. Class roles and capabilities are widely known and easily researched.
---
Hybrids understand that if they graciously fill the healer role they will have an easier time finding/keeping a raid spot and acquiring loot.
---
If they act entitled to off spec loot and preferential treatment then they will likely be kicked/not invited for their personality flaw.
---
The demand for hybrid healers will never be so high that this sort of thing will become necessary. There are always plenty of dedicated hybrid healers.
---
They will still be days long. Contrary to popular belief battles will take longer than 15 minutes and can go on for a decent amount of time. 
---
I would prefer an older version, 1.7 I think was pretty good but it's not as terrible as some are making it out to be.
---
Unfortunately I'll probably fall into the terrible tank category seeing as I've never tanked in WoW.
---
It was fun for like... 12 hours.
---
No, Blizzard chose it because it was the most complete version they had on file so it was the least work for them. Not really surprising for them to half ass, it has been their norm since Activision took over. Just disappointing. Everything about the progression of Vanilla is different in 1.12
---
Greetings from Shadyside!
---
In my experience you will lose a good 15 minutes as a minimum off of all buffs, considering the DM run also takes around 25mins, people are wasting an HOUR in prep just to save maybe 20mins in clear time.  It is literally a waste of time unless you are pushing for record clear times.  
---
I honestly hope that ALL raid buffs outside of heads are removed when entering a raid instance.
---
A steamer? What are you on aboat?
---
I couldn’t be more in the same boat as you. I’m doing a massive shopping trip a couple days before launch, planning out my sleep schedule for max efficiency and taking 1.5 weeks off. I’ve already let my live-in girlfriend know that she should find something else to do than spend time with me, lest she be disgusted by the manchild I will become for that first couple weeks. 
---
She doesn’t care, and even offered to cook me meals and bring me cans of Monster. I cannot wait.
---
i think by the time you hit 30 - 35 (ish) you know enough whether or not you like the class. if i don't like the class i don't usually make it past 40.
---
A little. Summer is the least busy time of year at work so I'd prefer a June release so I can maximize my time. A September release would hurt as the Fall is the busiest time of year, meaning I'd have very little time to play.
---
***If*** Retribution needs a buff why does it *need* to be a buff to dps? I say buff what makes Retribution unique.
---
Why you gotta play dumb?
---
I missed the info. Where did they talk about cross realm battlegrounds?
---
Don't forget, they were much more few and far between back then, too. Like 1 or 2 per zone, usually. 
---
How long are the average 1.12 AV battles? For me classic AV was a war, and it was fine if it didn't end. If 1.12 AV isn't like that then I strongly disagree.
---
I have a hard time picking a side here.  I didn’t play AV a ton in vanilla because for some reason it didn’t click, but when I played on Nostalrius something just clicked and I had the most fun ever.  I can’t get enough of the BG even just turtle feats because I can round up rams/hounds, farm herbs, or coordinate a mines assault to get infantry.  And those things actually *worked* surprisingly.  Granted your own team can fuck it up more easily than the opponents can deal with it, but a push with NPCs was unique and satisfying.  No other BG, event, or instance was like that.
---
I remember making good money just playing in there looting things and turning in.  I suppose for inflation purposes there might be good reason to remove that.  I don’t hate rush AV necessarily, but it feels lackluster in comparison.  Since I can’t say I remember 1.12 with good clarity, I guess I’ll wait to pass judgment.  I have a distinct feeling it’s going to be underwhelming however.
---
Are xrealm BG's confirmed?
---
My friends and I are beginning to consider making a progression guild. We plan on bringing 3 druids, 1 Feral OT 2 resto. 5 paladins 1 into Blessing of Sanc. 
---
Well The druids get rewarded by getting gear very fast, even the feral will need to heal on a lot of fights with only 3 druids to give healing gear to they will be geared much faster than the other raid memebrs. 
---
Having 5 paladins is about normal for a class, so they won't be geared too much faster than others.
---
Do they active get more things? No. They get rewarded by passively getting more loot than their fellow raiders. Paladins will get all healing mail and plate since no shamans on ally side. All healing shields as well. As I said before with only 3 Druids they get geared very fast, all healing leather and tier gears goes to them. 
---
We can get the PVE "boss rush" version of AV in current retail; if people think that's better, they've been able to play it for a dozen years now.
---
If they're recreating Classic, they might as well use it to offer the most epic version of AV as originally envisioned before it was diluted. After all, there's no requirement that people play it in Classic and there are no "random" queues that force people into it - so the people that didn't like the version that required people to PvP don't ever have to experience it.
---
An hour long video on bags...?  Didn't know I needed it until I had it.  Lol
---
In my experience you should have a full shard bad before you arrive.  Cookies are your responsibility but one fill shard bag is enough health cookies for half a raid and a SS and still have some spares.  Learn to gather a SS off every trash kill, you will never need to do more than that.
---
YOU SHOULD NEVER BE SUMMONING LAZY PLAYERS.  If your raid leader asks for a person or two to speed things up I understand, but I would literally drop raid if I as expected to summon more than a couple of people.  You are not there to allow others to neglect their responsibilities ,  they should be on time and at the raid.  A raid leader should be calling out and berating ANYONE that is late for the first pull.
---
I'm just having pun, my dude. Have an upvote.
---
Thanks so much u/magey. Would love to see where the items drop as well.
---
Wow Classic is waaaaay better than the current Wow.  Classic is how the game was designed and envisioned.  The current Wow is the product of suits trying to maximize revenue.
---
From what I can tell, it's basically the map version that was used in subsequent expansions (TBC, etc)
---
This, 100% if you want to tank 5 mans as a druid you will have zero problems. Groups are desperate for tanks, especially at end game, and druids are absolutely fine with any semi-competent group. They have decent armor, a taunt, and better AoE threat and threat gen than a warrior, and faerie fire is amazing. Plus, they can heal, have a battle rez, and can CC beasts with hibernate.
---
Druid is 100% the easiest class to get into 5-man PUGs because they can fill any role with HotW spec, so if you just want to do casual 5-mans, it's by far the most fun class IMO.
---
Thats sick dude, why are you even here?
---
It was fun and I made a few friends playing those endless grindy battles which is more than i can say for the game experiences ive had after vanilla.
---
Yeah. Feels like people are recalling TBC era AV.
---
Funny part too. Blizz added the reinforcement counter at some point specifically because AV was *still* the longest BG. Which also runs counter to the claims of “15 minute AVs”.
---
It’s consistent enough that I almost wonder which specific YouTuber is spreading this myth. 
---
Yeah I missed the server availability roulette game 
---
&gt; (i.e. as long as one keypress only initiates one action per client)
---
&gt; You must control each character individually/no input can be sent to *multiple windows* as per current EULA
---
did you even read what you qutoed LMFAO GL with that reading comprehension acomplishing anything.
---
You seriously need that many shards?  I have NEVER farmed more than 24 shards before any raid and I have never even got close to running out.  Also worth mentioning EVERY lock can get a shard off EVERY mob, so there should be no reason to pre-farm more than 24 shards.
---
I just don’t see how picking a Tauren shaman or Gnome rogue is bad behavior I guess, most people won’t set foot in Naxx so optimizing races just feels like getting annoyed for annoyance sake
---
Tanking is scary
---
That's what I'll do probably and hope I can change it when we do get a confirmation.
---
I am going to get my two weeks either way but it would be cool if I could experience the launch.
---
I am totally with you. Possibly moving in Aug/September and would love to be fully set up and not looking for a job so I can play as much as possible
---
Because this sub is trash and its full of people that obviously have no experience in vanilla but argue about it anyways. 
---
I know what you mean.  Adulting really sucks at times.  Who wants to deal with basement water and mold problems (my life right now) when there's wow classic to play?
---
GOOD. 1.12 AV is best AV.
---
It's fun and can be long or short depending if its a turtle game or not.
---
i dunno if they'll make a new episode about classic but i would be thrilled if they did. at the very least, it would be nice if they threw in a one off joke about how they're going back to kill boars. i love that episode it's one of my favorites lol. 
---
Especially because you dont even have to respec. Just put on a shield and you'll probably get full dibs on any plate gear and 2hers anyway. 
---
After a few hours, you’ll probably have had enough.  The old AV raged for days.  This was seen as a problem.  
---
I hate warlocks. I hate life tap. I've let Warlocks die while i'm healing over that. Look if we are mid fight and you go oom, life tap away kiddo. If we are between pulls, fucking drink you piece of shit, dont trade your mana for my mana then force me to drink and stop the tanks momentum. This is specifically in leveling dungeons as +healing gear makes it less annoying at 60.
---
Yes! very much so.
---
I am super afraid of ending up on a dead/low pop server
---
please don’t try this
---
&gt;you've got 10 minutes left on your hearthstone. So you log out in a safe spot, go brush your teeth and change into your PJs. Then you go and log in, only to hearth and log back out.
---
I kept doing that repeately, with the Morrowgrain \[Evergreen Pouch\], which had 10 minute cooldown.
---
&gt; log out in Orgrimmar 
---
I wanted to go back to Stormwind before logging out, but the server crashed and I had to fetch my sister from train.
---
I logged in in Orgrimmar the next day.
---
People constantly turtle on 1.12 servers. Despite everyone knowing rush games are optimal. They definitely WILL.
---
Saying that 1.12 was Vanilla WoW lololol
---
Only on tanks really.  Healing isn’t particularly hard relative to controlling whole encounters.  Better gear and skill increases your HPS and longevity, but everything still plays out the same.  Compare that to a tank who has to keep things facing the right way and controlling enemies to make them less dangerous.  Its very movement intensive and requires a huge base of knowledge regarding who is going to hit you with what so you can throw an interrupt or a stun or whatever else out of your bag of tricks.
---
Sure, healing is a step above face-rolling DPS, but it’s not really on par with all the stuff a good tank has to keep track of.  I can see how they get a big head about things, given their relative abundance means they are usually waiting on a tank to the point they’ll take anyone who keeps them from getting smacked around, but the better a tank the less the healer has to work to keep them standing and the more they have to focus on the idiot DPS standing in green fire.
---
Logically speaking, a tank who can’t be killed eliminates the need for a healer.  A healer isn’t going to operate without SOMEONE keeping the enemy off their squishy butt.  Their experience is very much about the better everyone else is doing, the less intense their own play is.   Still a step above those filthy DPS though, who see a good healer as a chance to stop paying attention and while their boots melt in a puddle of dragon piss.
---
and you seem to have misunderstood the part where it was mentioned that ony head has like a 2 hr cooldown when it’s sitting on the spike at the city entrance.
---
I never got to play the version with Korak but having the all tough guards is part of AV, imo. I really hope they change their mind on this and use an older version.
---
no u
---
Downvote for catering.
---
Yeah, thats worked on classis. Btw thats "official" tactic from that days.
---
For the record I never claimed to be in my fucking mind 😉.   But your post did make me remember that content is gated and will be released periodically so I'll need to have a way to sustain a periodic #nolife.  I've been wanting an aq black mount for years.
---
If you are that much of an immoral asshole that you would attack n innocent priest on a pvp server, youre going to notice that you’ve suddenly lost control of your character, and you’re suddenly running directly into a pack of mobs... 
---
Then play that on retail?
---
Classic AV was hours-long BG for the longest time, fullstop.
---
I wish wow had the dungeon trainer for new players like FFXIV does, you basically queued into an instance and you had some npcs tell you what to do, for example they make it very clear that your role as dps is to make sure nothing is attacking the healer and if something is, draw aggro from the healer and regroup with the tank so that he may regain aggro. It’s common dungeoning knowledge but that usually isn’t what happens in wow.
---
That's the 1.12 version in a nutshell. Organized groups can ransack the BG and end it quickly.
---
&gt; Well, remove tons of obstacles, objectives and streamline the map and it is bound to be easier to bypass each other.
---
Now lets be honest.... People even on Private Servers today on the old map with all the npcs still ride past each other and zerg:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zt4qFJ2tvQc&amp;t=
---
How much of this is on the players and how much of this is on the AV changes?
---
It can be, but I believe in you! Taunt some dudes and hit shield block, once you stop hyperventilating you will realize it really isn't that bad. Promise.
---
I think you overestimate how many people care about streamers.
---
My guess is the next xpac will be BC Classic or something like that.  Its a huge gamble for Blizzard.  
---
Same here. AV is one of the major elements for me and how much time I'll spend in Classic. The version they've chosen definitely isn't ideal.
---
To be fair most people had one, maybe two, rarely three characters that they actually played in classic
---
That's a very reasonable compromise. That's how you know the huge crowd of #nochangers will vehemently fight to the death to prevent it. I agree that all of the hybrid DPS specs need an overhaul to the utility they bring a group. Their main problem is that their heal spec brings all of the relevant utility needed. Some of the really poor ones (I'm talking less than 50% of the damage done of other dps classes) should really be brought up to 70% of pure dps classes. I'd like to see them bringing more utility to increase damage of others in meaningful ways. I would love to see hybrids have the option to not wear dresses and sprinkle light on their allies.
---
But letting people play their class in interesting and varied ways that changes the private server meta/experience isn't vanilla like.
---
Are we talking a cleveland steamer here?  Because I definitely wouldn’t roll in that.
---
Upvote for food.
---
There are like 7 other expansions where ret is relevant. Play there. It is very relevant in classic outside of raids. 
---
You can’t have the authentic min max raiding experience of vanilla while crying about balance and fine tuning. 
---
“I’m not trying to min max I just want to raid” - then find a guild that doesn’t care about you being ret. 
---
You either want a hardcore guild to raid with in which case you’re pigeonholed or you find a more casual one and play ret.
---
Shut the fuck up. 
---
Don't watch it then :D
---
I wish me and my friends still did sleep overs.
---
This is one of the main reasons I decided to roll a Mage in Classic. I have limited play time and don't intend to spend it all travelling 
---
15 minutes - 2 hours+
---
I already have a guild bro but thanks 
---
There are shorter versions of AV than 1.12 but a coordinated group could end the 1.12 AV pretty quickly as well. It's definitely not the version vanilla veterans wanted.
---
i'm hoping that's exactly why they aren't saying anything yet. its getting way to close to a "summer release" for them not to be ready for it, i think they just want to be strategic for the best turnout.
---
but i'm getting anxious about it lol, i just wanna know when i can play &gt;.&lt;
---
What are they doing about loot getting ninjaed?  Class specific rolling to me was a **HUGE PLUS** vs trolls stealing loot from dungeons for no other reason other than to DE etc.  Or raid masters handing out loot to favorites vs the new guy getting a fair roll etc.  
---
As loot was such a bigger part of the game in vanilla, how are they going to fix ninjaing?
---
Since day 1 I've stood by the no changes community actually having no idea what vanilla even was. Half the people don't even remember the game. This is a major glaring part. The av they "remember so fondly" barely existed, it was patched over and over early as can be. Even in vanilla we had the one closer to retail for longer than that abomination that was released. 
---
People worrying about streamers are the new streamers.
---
without korak and all the other cool stuff removed i hope its not to ugly and boring.
---
Downvote for water.
---
Lol, we always called it the Condom...
---
Not a single thing lmao. The best damage Paladin spec is Reckbomb, which is a slot machine 1v1 PVP trick spec like windfury Shaman that only ever worked when the talent was bugged. Oh! Also it is a primarily PROT tree spec lol. Ret, Balance, and Enh were all below average in every situation.
---
Do you even play on a 1.12 private server? Games range from 15 minutes - 2+ hours
---
Streamers do it for two reasons, they like the game or they like popularity (99% of them)
---
99% Streamers will follow the latest trend, WoW classic will keep them occupied for maybe 3 months then once 60 they will move on to the next FotM game taking their followers with them.
---
IMO the popular streamers will be the reason some realms literally collapse in population after a couple of months.
---
The 1% of streamers that having been playing classic for the fun, wont care about their sub numbers and will have zero impact on population.
---
There will be streamers on EVERY realm, the ones you have to worry about are those that are doing it for a living, not those that just want to share their gameplay
---
No, it wasn't. It was still longer than the others, but wasn't the shitfest that launch av was. The Zerg nonsense didn't happen until reinforcements.
---
Would love to see more! Please consider using a Mulgore setting sometime :)
---
And my comment clearly rattled you enough to call me a kid. Take your own advice, lol. 
---
If they don't want to play that role, I'm not giving them anything because they won't be invited.
---
Hello All! 
---
I played a Pally in Vanilla but was still too young to really care about following "meta" when it comes to raiding and builds. Looking to be semi-hardcore this time but not too crazy since I am a working adult now.
---
* NA
---
* PvE and/or PvP - don't really care right now so this will depend on guild
---
* Leaning Alliance but this can also change if the fit with the potential (Horde) guild is right
---
* Live in Eastern but will consider Central based guilds as well
---
* Social experience and the ability to become a leader/officer. Most guild that are advertising are coming from retail and will have the same people in charge of everything. I'm not against that but I do have a bad taste with guilds that are controlled by the same 4-5 people.
---
* Discord: Pieisgood#0724 
---
No I don't and I don't think I want to use private servers as a reference.
---
Been Holy paladin since OG vanilla, I'll be there again. Cause I like it.
---
I’m actually going to be starting another cycle of Madcow to coincide with launch so I can have a character that levels up with my gains!
---
enchants alone wont even be covered by your 100g figure.  Just an example, rogue wants crusader enchant there goes around 150g and thats just ONE weapon enchant.
---
Probably 2-3 hours per day maximum 
---
I'm fine with a later release if it means official classic won't be below the private server experience.
---
That was always my thing too. Getting a character to 51 meant I could start AV quests for good XP and quest rewards. Certainly helped that I really loved pre-1.12 AV.
---
Define original? The first 89 servers from launch day? Or the server list before TBC? Original isn't clear. And I doubt they'll have that many to start.
---
This is a non-negotiable issue for myself &amp; inner circle (6 people).  Either we get old AV as it was pre-nerfs or we are out.  Its the only content we are interested in.  We don't want nerfed/missing NPC's that encourage zerging.  
---
I mean I know the exact rotations, all the vanilla dungeons layouts etc. I just don't like the responsibility to be a leader, it stresses me out and isn't fun.
---
Mmm soup shards
---
So do squats, but they’re just like...one of the absolute best exercises for building muscle. Just because something puts pressure on your discs doesn’t mean its detrimental to your health! Stabilizers will catch up if you exercise in moderation.
---
&gt;I’ll be honest, I just want to know this for banking purposes.
---
Works well for fast traveling between levels 1-9 when there's no res sickness.
---
You saucy.
---
It's not scary, it's annoying when your group is full of morons, who insist that they don't need salv.
---
Agreed. AV is probably where I spent most of my time before the 1.12 patch. Despite the long matches it was the first PvP rep I got to exalted, and the first I got all the gear from. WSG and AB were okay but AV was really hard to quit playing.
---
4 hours a day? You underestimate the power of a WoW addiction
---
the current server list the day 1.12 launched yes, why is that hard to grasp xD
---
Blizz has been tinkering with AV for 14 years, and then tried to do it fresh with Ashran, and have never been able to find the balance you are looking for. 
---
My mind is racing.  Something I remember is that things like Quest Helper were such a big quality of life improvement, but at the same time killed leveling.
---
FFS the first time I leveled a character (warrior) it took me 3 months before I hit 60 haha.
---
Evntually I found a printed out guide I was using to level a few other characters, but I still had to use coordinates to find stuff.  Mind numbing and horribly tedious, but it felt rewarding for some reason.
---
Will an add-on like Quest Helper be allowed?
---
I recommend joining a guild as soon as possible (even before Classic releases, preferably). Get to know like minded people. Don't rely on pugs. That way you get the best of both worlds. A strong community and no (or much shorter) waits for group content. (And of course basically no wait for raids, which will/should be scheduled.)
---
"Listen here you knife-eared piece of shit" - Your dwarf, probably
---
I know it was a long time ago, but based on those descriptions, IIRC 1.11 is what killed it.
---
As someone said above, if a guild expects you to make HP stones for the entire guild then you need a new guild. 
---
Back in the day we only had locks make stones for tanks and some boss ass healers... We didnt event bother wasting any on summons, get your lazy asses to the portal like everyone else.
---
I have no idea what Ashran is. And I am not looking for any sort of balance. The long AV runs are what I want. What I was saying is that I would agree to a more balanced version if this would please all those who disliked the day-long AVs.
---
It really makes no sense. You can essentially play 1.12 on retail, and have been able to for over a decade now. The people who WANT long epic AV's have no such option, and will continue to have no option for it. Why are we not getting the true classic version of AV that was in WoW for the majority of vanillas lifespan?
---
This is such a bad decision.
---
Ping also has a big impact. Maybe the servers were strained too much, causing additional hits. 
---
1.8 doesn't have minefield/shredder iirc so no that's too late
---
Cant believe I didnt mention this earlier either.  I eventually ended up into more PVP back them and the thing that totally killed the game for me, was botting.  I would spend hundreds of hours grinding loot, and some lowlife was just botting to accomplish the game thing.  
---
It invalidated any achievements and completely killed PVP for me.
---
At some point Blizzard seem to give up on bots.  How will this time be different?  Fool me once etc?  They just stopped giving a sht at some point which destroyed the game.  
---
So your entirely private server experience, where every server database varies and likely most of the data is inaccurate, is greater than someone who played the whole of Vanilla? Because you've played longer, realtime out of game? On serparate, incomplete imitations? Gotcha
---
Early patches of Vanilla saw hybrids DPSing. 1.12 is one of the minority of patches where they were only useful as healers. Sorry that's the only experience you have of Vanilla, but that is not the entire story.
---
For the last one gbid is actually a thing on pservers now. Haven’t seen it in action, but apparently some people who are friends with raid leader will “outbid” and just not pay and just basically get reserved loot. I’m hoping this doesn’t become a thing on classic. 
---
For all the disappointment: Kingdom Hearts 3 had an excellent combat system. If Square takes cues from it then I think it'll be great. If using Materia is anything like the magic in KH3 it'll be super satisfying to integrate it into combat.
---
People who are thinking this is the "ZERG IT DOWN" version of AV are the people that very, very clearly don't even know what vanilla was or what they were playing. The zerg it down version didn't happen until BC in patch 2.3 when they added reinforcements. AV will still last a long time, just not an eternity like the AV that launched (That we barely even had mind you). We legit only had the shitfest  AV for 4 months. 4 MONTHS. Stop acting like this is even a thing to be mad about. That version of AV barely even existed. It wasn't even around for a quarter of vanilla.
---
Yup.  My memory of the time is hazy, but AV generally got worse over time.
---
When AV launched, I thought it was kind of overwhelming.  A lot of the areas, tasks, and NPCs felt superfluous or annoying.  But each time stuff was removed/nerfed, it made AV feel a bit smaller and closer to a "regular" BG.
---
How much imbalance are we actually talking about here? Just the fact that there are meme specs like Ret or Balance, or that some classes are just inherently weaker? Because it seems like every one of the 9 classes has something elite to offer, you ask me.
---
Blizzard is drawing a line in the sand and sticking to a hard template. This is critical if they want to stay on track and not stray from "classic." We can discuss changes and QoL improvements after release. This is exactly how OSRS went and it is super successful now.
---
When crafters/enchanters advertise something (excluding rare recipes) I need but charge a fee on top of that, I'll try to avoid them and find someone who isn't expecting something in return then I'll tip them more than the other players fee would have been.
---
If I am forced to pay the fee from the original player in question then I will not tip on top of that.
---
I am a very generous tipper but hate being told how much I have to give lol 👿
---
You can tank things as a warlock if you significantly overgear the content and it wasn't that difficult to begin with. In ~T2 gear I did 2-man runs of various lvl 60 dungeons with a healer, just for fun. 
---
Otherwise, just Twin Emps and I feel like I offtanked something in AQ20? Been a long time but I do have a memory of it. 
---
If you hate grinding/farming, then I don't know what to tell you. You're going to have to grind your ass off like it's 2004 again regardless of what you play -- even the fastest leveling spec like hunter is still going to take a fuckload of time grinding on mobs. 
---
A good casual class is one that you enjoy grinding with, because this is old WoW - getting to level 20 in classic is like getting to level cap in retail. 
---
So it doesn't matter if a class is slower (ie, paladin) or miserable (ie, warrior) to level if you enjoy it. 300 hrs of inefficient fun is better than 150 hrs of efficient boredom. 
---
All classes have robust toolkits with gaping holes. Ie Druids have their hand in every cookie jar, like really fun world exploration and leveling with feral / stealth, great grouped utility, strong healing, etc but the "gaping holes"  are that their balance spec is low dps and too mana gated to be even mediocre. And feral is very hard to itemize for and even if you cleverly max your dps with the right gear, you should always underperform an equally strong rogue. For me, these gaping holes are not big problems because I could give a shit if I can keep up with rogues and mages, and I like the broad utility enough to stay entertained leveling as druid. 
---
You should pick a class where you can live with the gaping holes. Can you live with priest leveling? Can you live with poor end game hunter dps scaling? Can you live with paladin's expected raid spec? 
---
So this will shave off a few classes for most people right off the bat. These are your classes you could live with. Beyond that, you should go by class fantasy and fun. What do you want to do, and what class do you see yourself on doing those things?
---
I am going to play a Druid because I like raid healing, I like rogue leveling, and I like hybrid class fantasy and druid emergency multitool style utility. I also think Druid pvp was really rewarding. Boomkin Mana problems and low dps is a bummer, but with every class, there is going to be some gaping holes. It's just about picking what you can live with.
---
Good news for you then! You, and everyone who agrees with you can play it on retail, and have been able to for over a decade!
---
Guess what the people who disagree with you get to play? NOTHING. Give us our version to play too.
---
hunter mage warlock and rogue are all close to 2nd place so its not like thats a worthwhile difference
---
Most people don't understand how much quicker runs can go if they minimize the healers need to constantly heal. Stuns, interrupts, etc. may lower their DPS but the runs go much faster.
---
The less a healer has to heal the less time they have to spend drinking and wasting time. I've been on runs where I only had to throw a renew on the tank and an occasional heal. How? Good rogues using their combo points to stun/interrupt instead of DPS. 
---
I started playing when TBC launched and most of the AVs I did as a noob lasted a long time
---
One thing people nostalgic about vanilla remember the most is AV battles that lasted literal days, that's not gonna be a thing now rip
---
Spell reflect was TBC
---
I think there are a lot of cool hardcore players out there. Great to nerd out with.
---
However, one thing I noticed when I first played in the private server scene is that there are a lot of condescending pricks there. Most of the elitist pricks I have run into on private servers barely played vanilla back in the day and their “expertise” is around how private servers are built. 
---
Back in the day, players who were super hardcore always helped people out and were almost ‘stoic’ as a group, with very few exceptions. 
---
I’ve seen a lot of millennials(i am one, so put your pitchforks away) representing this new class of elitist pricks in the vanilla private server scene. 
---
Really hopeful that once vanilla comes out and the faux historian class of condescending know-it-alls spread out across the various servers produced by blizz, rather than concentrate their mass in one place.
---
&gt;i.e. as long as one keypress only initiates one action per client
---
One keypress: I press one button
---
One action: Character initiates what is bound to that key
---
Per client: Each of my clients can receive that keypress.
---
What part of that do you think means keystroke broadcasting is not ok?
---
Seeing as you've failed basic reading comprehension, have clearly not read the EULA, have made comments that lead me to believe you've never actually played vanilla wow, and have failed to provide any evidence of your claim... I'm just going to come out and say you're a retard who's full of shit.
---
The same could be said about WoW in general.  If people want to play "1.12 AV", they can fire up retail and play it right now.
---
avavavavavavavavavav que pls
---
I don't think the 1.12 version is nearly as fast as everyone thinks it is. It is pre-reinforcements, and reinforcements are what really force the base-race game because its effectively impossible for Horde to win a war of attrition.
---
My prediction is that many games will be base races, but certainly not all of them, because there isn't a timer on how long Horde have to win the game.
---
10:18 lol
---
Indeed we all are.
---
True dat.
---
&gt; Korak the Bloodrager was removed, and killing opposing players no longer drops items like Dwarf Spines, Orc Teeth, or Human Bone Chips. Gross.
---
Then it's the wrong version, those should be in the game.
---
After the 1.11 change groups were forming on Malfurion to time their queue in an attempt to get as many players in Ventrilo into the same AV just so they could rush it down.
---
Even with just a few groups making into the same AV it dramatically reduced the duration of the BG.
---
This continued until TBC came out as they were taking turns creating High Warlords with this method.
---
For some reason this never really happened until after the NPC nerfs.
---
You talk like ret is the only spec that is not very good in raids, every class has bad spec for raiding
---
A highly skilled hunter is quite amazing to watch! They are so rare though. It's like seeing a unicorn!
---
Used to do that with 5mans. Once the entire group was formed everyone should be making their way to the instance. As soon as I get there, and I'm able I'll start summoning the remaining folks making their way there but if you are still at the bank in SW, you aren't getting a summon.
---
Seriously. AV was my first exalted rep in vanilla...
---
Laughs in Vanilla
---
A decent Warlock won't expect healing from Life Tap. Between Fel Armor and Drain Life, I shouldn't need it.
---
I don't think you understand the meaning of "rattled"
---
[Guilty](https://i.gifer.com/2871.gif)
---
As a casual player, you should just play what you enjoy. That's really it lol
---
blizz claims that sharding will only be in the first few weeks of launch, if they end up doing sharding at all
---
Most likely slipped Chabois mind but he is almost always killed in a buff run, because you normally have much more than just the 5 people who killed it going through. Often you can have half your raid running through the one ID. So it just makes it easier to kill him rather than doing feign death pulls or invis potting past.
---
Onyxia takes a deep breath....and disagrees.
---
You better be taking just tiny bites or all that food is gonna catch up to you xD
---
&gt; Yes. You can tank. Good job! Nobody is going to let you tank a full raid, though.
---
I'm not even a tryhard, and I wouldn't even join a 5 man with a shaman 'tank.' The group would fall apart at the first sign of trouble. Ain't nobody got time for that.
---
Pallies have 8% running and mount speed in Ret tree. No need for enchants, trinkets, etc.
---
Its as bad as bronchitis.
---
There will be potential for long games but the 1.11 nerf to NPCs sped things up a lot. Adding the reinforcement system later was the final nail.
---
Farm up and risk overleveling
---
Yes, the trinket is bind on pickup so you have to craft it yourself, but there's no enchanting requirement to wear it.
---
I'm sure you're getting blown up with messages about this, but my reason for wanting the days long AV is it felt like something truly epic. Logging in and join a battle and playing an intense few hours of fighting and strategy then leaving. coming back the next day or the next time you could log in you really got a feeling that this was a true war for that space. It was meant to be the true war between the alliance and horde over a vast supply of resources. 
---
The elation you felt logging in and seeing the AV veterans in your battlegroup. Every server had a few "generals" who people trusted to lead the war and when you joined an AV without one of those people the difference was staggering. 
---
When you think of getting yourself immersed in the world, a new war every 30 minutes with 0 ramifications from the previous half-hour breaks the fantasy way more than a war where the towers you downed yesterday have an impact on the game today. To me it was the best way to really feel that fantasy PvP. 
---
If the raid tiers are going to be released in phases, why can't AV be released in phases too?
---
This would give the players who loved the earlier versions some time to play it the way they liked, and the haters could just wait until the version they liked was patched in.
---
Just like the raid phases that will end in a couple of years (at most), AV would eventually settle in to the its long term final form, but at least you let everyone have something along the way.
---
Lol what kind of argument is this? They don't have data for whenever they are in development to launch a new patch or expansion either. It might only be 95% accurate but they can at least attempt to recreate an older version of AV. 
---
Blizzard is just taking the easy road because it's slightly more time-consuming on their part and they don't think they'll lose any people signing up over it. It was one of the things I was looking forward to most. I only played any AV after all the changes in the pre-TBC patch for the marks when they revamped the pvp system, after that I probably played the same amount of AV all the way through TBC-WotLK that I did in about one week of pre-nerf AV. 
---
AV was so boring afterwards I don't know how anyone could honestly find it enjoyable. If anything, I'd rather see an honest attempt at a 1.8 version with even more foot soldiers patrolling around.
---
I hadn't even considered the scent game till I read this
---
... because I like the game and am looking forward to spending a reasonable amount of time playing it?
---
What's sick about not wanting to burn up my limited vacation time to nolife a video game?
---
&gt; “hey we know we haven’t released ANY information just yet but want to let you know we are working HARD to get these out to you in it’s best form and are still on target to get it to you by summer!”.
---
This makes on sense at all.
---
Why would they make a memo just to tell us that they are still on schedule? If anything, a memo would be out to inform that the schedule is changing.
---
If there's radio silence, then it means that everything's according to plan and there's no surprises looming around.
---
You people need to take some axiety pills or whatever
---
Crusader costs nowhere close to 150g, more like 50g.
---
Only TBC enchanting enchants had a level requirement of 35. There's no such limitation in vanilla.
---
Yeah no
---
If that's the case then I would not be opposed to Ret getting a buff so that it's good at *something*.
---
&gt; The point is that dynamic spawns have an effect on gameplay whereas sharding doesn't.
---
Yeah, right, seeing people dissapear in the world won't affect immersion at all.
---
Sorry I assume every main tank is an engineer.
---
Thats really autistic holy shit.
---
Well then you aren't educated on the matter at all. There's plenty of ways you can extend games. stick a few people on choke. stick a few rogues to defend the marshalls and wipe the tank on pulls. stick a few rogues on def to recap the gy when the enemy team goes all in on drek/van. stick a few people on def to recap towers.
---
Yo, making a 920 guild if your interested ;)
---
It will happen but only after a year or two
---
I....suddenly want to roll priest on a pvp server now.
---
It was the vanilla experience if you played at launch/new server launch.
---
&gt; If we are between pulls
---
Conversely...healers, stop fucking wasting your mana healing me between pulls.  I'm LT'ing so I don't have to drink, and I'm going to siphon life/drain life the first mob we pull.
---
am not sure whether to take that as compliment or insult.
---
Vanilla was in a live process of tweaking 
---
You want vanilla again then expect 1.13
---
Don’t care about them one way or the other. Don’t run with people killing civilians if you care.
---
Please do so we can laugh at people spamming the chat with "Tank Shaman LF raidspot"
---
You’re in a thread full of players fraternizing around the idea of vegging out hard for a couple weeks on something they have looked forward to for years. Who cares if its a video game or cancun?
---
Your post is blatantly made with the intent to act like you are better than everyone here, except it backfired and you just look like an asshole. Just don’t post at all next time. 
---
If you think sharding in classic is going to be implemented the same as it is in retail, you don't know WoW whatsoever.
---
If you think most of the population that'll be giving classic a try is going to be as bent out of shape as a few extremely vocal people in this echo chamber of a subreddit, you don't know WoW whatsoever.
---
If you think you speak for the majority of the game's fans, you don't know WoW whatsoever.
---
A lot. I'll ruin my adult life just like I ruined my teenage one.
---
Youre really going to use the rose-tinted glasses argument, which is basically the biggest meme of whole classic community, unironically?
---
June and September are equally bad for me since they are quarter ends and I'm an accountant.
---
Give me any other month than a quarter end month and I'll be happy.
---
hahahaha preach brother
---
he can't hear you. he died
---
They don't say things like that because, as a whole, gamers are petulant crybabies.  If a Blizz rep said something like *"hey guys, no promises, but we are aiming for a July release,"* the second August 1st happened people would lose their shit.  They'd call Blizzard liars, scream about how disappointing it is, and probably even try to argue stuff like *"obviously they are pulling resources off of it, Classic is going to be dead on arrival..."*
---
As a community, we did this to ourselves.  Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
---
Itemization is a big problem
---
Cloth priest bis on a pala? Wtf blizz make a plate variant ffs or its just lazy design
---
It's a thread asking how much time people are going to spend in the game, and you're shitting on someone for having a different opinion?  Get the fuck over yourself, you pathetic child.
---
It’s a circle. The DPS help the healer by killing the boss before mana runs out, the healer helps the tank by keeping him alive, the tank helps the DPS by keeping aggro. 
---
This isn't an opinion you get to have. The idea that everyone is going to want to join a min-max guild is speculation at best. 
---
AoE tanking on Shamans is a lot more challenging because their AoE totems don't generate threat to the Shaman.
---
You're absolutely right. Pros and cons.
---
It feels like Korraks reign of terror over snowfall was much longer, or maybe that's just because of the gy runs
---
Nope, hybrid tax. You can probably find a guild that will take you along for your buffs but it won't be a hardcore one. 
---
What makes you think you're entitled to it? 
---
Unless u are a warlock
---
AV from 1.10 would probably be simple enough since it was basically removing guard NPCs and nerfing their HPs.
---
It would be cool to see Korrak and such but all that would definitely take more work.
---
okay, dirty sanchez
---
just you
---
If only it had been a warlock.
---
Currently Blizzard's plans are:
---
Items stats will not change throughout classic WoW. At launch item stats will be in their final 1.12 state.
---
However, new items that were added to drop tables of already available enemies/bosses in 1.10 and beyond will not be present in the drop tables at launch. When AQ releases they will all be put in the drop tables.
---
Tank looking for gas
---
Yeah same-ish, it's gonna take years to reach 60 but luckily I love levelling and don't plan to raid 
---
Obviously you think I didn't play AV at all. I know very well how it works and played it during vanilla a lot, I just cannot remember which version gave me the longest lasting memories. Private servers are not a valid reference at all. A lot of what they do are guesses. They don't have the original code or values. They are close, but I will never accept them as the source of truth, as shouldn't you and anyone else. If you don't know this then it appears that you are not educated on the matter.
---
That said - look at the edits in my initial comment. I already said that I seem to remember it wrong before you even wrote your first comment.
---
This. Played all different roles through vanilla, BC and WOTLK and I found that healing was not only the most rewarding role (for me personally) in most cases but I found that it was the one role where incompetent play can damage gameplay the most, except maybe main tanks in raids. 
---
Looking forward to healing again in classic.
---
Usually after a long and involved courtship of trading insults and abusing broken game mechanics. I remember the snake trap debacle. 
---
This. On my server games usually were like 10-18.5 hours, sure they went longer but that was by far the norm. I wouldn't mind if they were typically like 6-8 hour games or something, but short rushed matches just remind me of WotLK dungeons where you'd just non-stop aoe pull trash and burst down a boss. There's no excitement to it and adding something like that to Classic is really counter-intuitive. 
---
Blizzard took the easiest route possible when deciding what AV to use.  
---
Thanks, dude. Much appreciated.
---
And 113 others too
---
Ummm.... That's not how it works lol. The longer a server is up the more expensive items get because players have MORE money. 
---
Where are you pulling those prices from? 3-9 gold for twink items? What planet are you from. Good twink items go for HUNDREDS of gold. lol 3-9 gold
---
Huh, that makes a lot of sense. I am seeing all of the fuss about 1.12 AV being a Zerg race and I'm thinking: I know it was a long time ago, but I never remember zerg races in AV and I played AV from Vanilla well into TBC...
---
When they release the new raid tiers you can still go back and do the other ones.
---
Patching AV in stages would be moronic because people who enjoy the AV they get will be pretty frustrated that its changing to a version they don't enjoy and vice versa people who don't like older AV will just avoid it till patch 1.12.
---
Regardless of which AV version they eventually settle on, or even some sort hybrid, doing a tiered rollout of the AV patches wouldn't make anybody happy.
---
“Not wasting any of my time...and I think anyone who does is a sucker.” 
---
I’m the one shitting on people for having a different opinion?
---
Not sure what server or battlegroup you played on but it definitely was.
---
Outland EU had a player going for rank 14 taking breaks from AB to play AV and just base race.
---
Grouped with them several times
---
Dont pallies or shamans compete for leather?
---
1.12 AV is literally just regular AV from retail wow
---
Why would I want to go back and play the same shitty BG I can play Today, it wasnt fun in 1.12 and it isnt fun today
---
What a fucking waste of everyones time. No one is talking about 1.12 AV when they talk about vanilla AV
---
Uh huh.. and no one has that much gold. So it isn't going to sell. 
---
I imagine that's how it was for a lot of people but I played AV a LOT. I didn't get to experience it until just after 1.9 ish so I never saw Korrak and all that stuff but I do remember the large amounts of guards.
---
AV was my favorite thing in vanilla WoW until the 1.11 nerf. AV was my first non-city rep to reach exalted.
---
Who knows if I would still like it that much but starting with the 1.12 version is bad news for a lot vanilla players. Better than having reinforcements but just barely.
---
Vague statements about "working hard" and making "progress" are just going to whip the community into a fury. They'll announce something when they have something to announce.
---
Enchanting only isn’t a gold sink if you are one of the first people with it. Get rare recipes and get paid. If you are the first person on a server with the right enchants you can make a stupid amount of money. Unless you no life, plan your leveling around grinding certain mobs, and get lucky or you will lose money on enchanting. 
---
Thats how you get camped
---
OSRS are literal dog shit now
---
\&gt;max 99 melee from 6 hour afking
---
Quality gameplay
---
99s are 100% irrelevant now
---
Not me!  I'm the guy that is protecting our flag and gets steamrolled by 4 people that nobody stopped for some reason despite my entire team being in mid.
---
The fastest way to a man's heart is through his ribcage.
---
It takes 117 runs to have an even chance of getting it. :|
---
A voidwalker can't hold threat on a single target without DPS having to hold back significantly. And it won't be able to keep other mobs off the healer. But yeah you can have a voidwalker tank one of the secondary targets in a dungeon and it's good at that.
---
I think one obstacle is that we don’t know if some items may be in phase 1. Patch 1.11 contained several “catch up items” and I have a feeling those won’t be included in phase 1. Crafted items like Enchanted Thoroum Breastplate or Warding Cloak. Even several Dungeon items were updated, like the Deathbone set from Scholo. I have a feeling that at least some of these items will be included with the their 0.5 sets. 
---
As long as we get Arathi Basin ill be fine.
---
This is how you do speedruns
---
I dont think the honor per hour focused people liked the rushing either, it was just the best strategy to win. 
---
If you want long AV's you can group up with some friends and defend your factions boss regardless.  It's hilarious listening to players in your BG whine about giving up so they can queue for another AV that isn't a turtle. 
---
three mages and a priest.
---
This is what made PvP on PvE servers so great imo. You couldn't just gank someone, there was a whole ritual involved. You had to be resourceful, and decide how much abuse you were going to put up with before defending the pride of your faction. 
---
While that would be interesting, there’s no way to know for certain. 
---
Alchemy is 100% better to level on an alt. In the extremely unlikely chance you get a flask recipe, you can just send it to your alt.
---
Technically, if a mob hits you, you tanked it. How effective you are is up for debate.
---
This is depressing. I personally was [hoping for a combination](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/97i3zw/patchwerk_wednesday_alterac_valley/) of all the patches so we could have epic but still reasonably timed games come classic but, that doesn’t appear to be what we’re getting.
---
I had a feeling this was coming, to be fair, but that little bit of hope I had was just crushed. 
---
I am so mad
---
I dont even play video games any at all anymore, I was ready to take off a good 3 weeks of vacation time to relive vanilla  on launch and it turns out its going to be shit retail AV. I cant wait to see what else is watered down due to laziness
---
Nostalgia is one hell of a drug haha
---
While I don't necessarily condone this type of "group hostage holding" (by threat of leaving).  I understand where you're coming from.  I also hate grouping with those people you are referring to.  You know the type...the ones who are trying to play WoW and watch a movie on Netflix at the same time!
---
When it's appropriate?  Absolutely.  By no means was Classic perfect.
---
Its less bad if u get good CC classes and be patient to organise the pull
---
This is a crushing blow to my interest in Classic.  If I wanted to race in AV, I'd re-sub to retail.  I have been hyped for Classic since the first mention of it, and this is just devastating news.  I had hope that in a game being put out to re-live epic times, that I would actually be able to.  This is just brutal.
---
literally no one wants this
---
I have never in my entire life heard someone say they miss the 1.12 AV. 
---
How is this a compromise? No one wants this
---
They always say they dont have one
---
i agree with the longer more grindy version of AV aswell. Or battleground farm will just end up beeing; During week, AV premades. During Weekends, Weekly BG.
---
Personally i dont like the fast AV's because it just become to profitable honor/per hour. 
---
First and foremost, play whatever Race and Class you think is the coolest.  If what you think is the coolest is character fantasy, then play whatever suits you.  If what you think is the coolest is min-maxing your character, then you can find those answers, too.  But the important thing is that it's something you *want* to do, not what you feel like you *should* do.  It's going to take hundreds of hours just to level to 60, there's no point doing it on a Race/Class you aren't in love with.
---
Having said that, at the endgame -- Priest will be expected to heal.  Hunter is great at leveling and solo'ing content, but if you plan on raiding your damage doesn't scale very well into higher tiers.  Mage is a solid class pretty much no matter what.
---
Dude, I don't even freaking know. My brother wanted to be an undead priest, now a rogue. My friend wants to be a warlock, but realized trolls can't be warlocks, so he may roll undead. I have a couple other friends who want to play, but I'll have no idea what. 
---
It all depends what my friends play. I really want to play shaman, or druid tank, but I also want to quest in EPL. I feel I'll be pushed into a tanking or healing role, just unsure which yet
---
So when blizzard / anti-classic people use the same rhetoric, its stupid, but you using it selectively is just good logic and appropriate.
---
I'm with you. June-July I'd no life for 2 weeks straight! Late August or September, though, I'd only play maybe an hour a day.  Pretty much be completely unhyped if it's late summer.
---
I do not under any circumstance want to be on the same server/faction as a streamer. The white knights and brown nosers that surrounds them extremely undesirable.
---
With the 1.12 version it will likely be base rushes lasting 15-20 minutes with little actual PvP.
---
I am dissappointed in this decision but understand the reason behind it - somewhat. However, we already have gated content and progressive itemization. Perhaps Blizzard does not want to imitate PS too much, which is a shame in this instance.
---
Ok, I can see your point, so how about a dual AV queue that you pick between AV (old school) or AV (1.12), both versions fall within the time frame of "classic".
---
Not really realistic I know, but it seems like people are pretty divided on this subject.
---
Dont worry. You will have never ending AV when its not AV weekend.
---
It might not be the pvp that makes people think that.
---
1.12 AV is basically current AV without the reinforcement system. Before 1.11 there were NPC patrols along the roads, in the towers, etc. and they could take a beating. Your team had to take down Balinda/Galvangar to stop some of the spawns to make it easier to push further up the road. The slowness of assault is kind of what allowed the time for doing the side quests, which were sometimes **required** to break a defense.
---
Is there any possibility you could share your map as a PNG or other lossless format?
---
&gt;1.12 AV is literally just regular AV from retail wow
---
It is not though.
---
Retail AV has the reinforcements and 1.12. This is not the only difference but a significant one.
---
How much is needed to exclude glancing blows in raid?
---
I mean I'm no angel, but that is some petty shit.  At least throw a HoT on them...
---
This isn't 2006 anymore when 1000 people could crash a server. And most streamwatcher don't even play on the same server as the streamer. To be honest I don't think a streamer will have any impact on the server.
---
So is that a Tips Out diss?
---
Please tell me how I can max melee to 99 in 6 hours?
---
Neat idea, but definitely a handful of hurdles in place for it.  Not the least of which are console's approach to player reports and bans.  I don't see Blizzard being willing to let go of those reins.
---
I really actually have hard time seeing why they’d so such a thing. If it was because of a version data theyre not able to retrieve or something like that it would make sense. Now it just seems they are actually put of touch with the community, and have a very different view of what people want in Classic. 
---
I would love to play classic WoW on PS4. 
---
Lol the only time hybrids were dps'ing in end game vanilla raids is when they didn't know better, or didn't care that it hampered progress. Don't pretend it was actually good pre 1.12.
---
Yeah, no
---
Coordinated queue exploitation sounds like it was more of an issue than the changes, in that case. Premades stop non premades. 
---
i would go on a streamer sever just to gank the shit out of them and give them a living hell, showing location all the time, yes thank you.
---
this, thank you.  I played vanilla and tbc and i never once remembered joining AV to 'farm' and get it over with.  back then you joined it knowing what you were getting into and playing it for the sake of it. and i played the era's where i remember logging in before school and joining one and getting home 8 hours later and playing the same one.  it wasn't about completion then.  and if they start on 1.12 version now where that isn't going to happen i feel the same way, i'm still gonna join it for the reason of battling the enemy, whether it's an hour or 3 days.  
---
i dont want to say my experience is the right one but i can absolutely see why people are fine with the 1.12 version being the one released with classic, that's still FINE and fun for those of us that played the game in that way.  anyone serious pvp'd in warsong or open world anyway
---
Impossible beauty standards these days amirite? Don’t do the thing you like and have been waiting years for, gross.
---
Assuming the rewards from each stay the same, why would you ever want to queue for the "more difficult version" of AV when you can get the same rewards from the 1.12 version.
---
Have you ever sen anyone ask for this version of AV?
---
The reason is theyre lazy and shitty developers. You dont get a quality programmer for $60,000 a year thats for sure.
---
The medium salary for a blizzard game developers is $50,000 less than you get as a starting salary for a computer science major. You have to be a garbage programmer to want to work for blizzard at that horrible salary. 
---
Wow has a solution for this. Poopsock. 
---
Private servers are terrible representations of earlier and harder versions of AV. There is a massive language barrier in private server games, where the team is split between English, Russian, Chinese, etc, not interacting with each other, having entirely different goals and play styles...so you get these very divided teams with minimally effective leadership. Games are further drawn out and “not fun” for those reasons.
---
Blizzard servers will allow (for example) mostly NA servers, speaking mostly English. You will have a team you can understand, can read what you’re saying, and at least respond in English to how they’ll bang your mom instead of helping you cap a graveyard.
---
I really actually have hard time understandin the decision. If it was because of a version data theyre not able to retrieve or something like that it would make sense. Now it just seems they are actually put of touch with the community, and have a very different view of what people want in Classic. 
---
So correct me if I am wrong. Isn't this the point that both sides started zerging it? If so, that is hugely disappointing. 
---
Leaving a battle and going to bed and waking up to find the exact same battle going on was cool at first, then it became tedious and annoying. AV was legit broken and never really got "fixed". Ideally the BG would last somewhere between 30 minutes to a couple hours tops.  Instead AV is painfully slow, monotonous, trench warfare that could take a day or more. I'd like to see it tuned to where the turn-ins and NPCs made the game swing much harder and there was more back and forth swinginess involved. Albeit I like the turtlefest better than the dual base rush, it's still full of its own very major problems.
---
[/r/techsupport](https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/)
---
We may still see some usage of the quests for summons but it won't be as common in 1.12 as it was before 1.11.
---
And yeah... one of my best memories from vanilla still is a single long AV where we summoned Wyverns, Riders, and Infantry at the same time and pushed through SP GY and into the Alliance base all at once.
---
Seeing the Wyverns over head and wolf riders and grunts charging down the road with a ton of Horde players in tow was awesome.
---
My excitement level just dropped 3 points. 
---
How is being PvP or solo not a place? Prot is a great PvP spec that gives pretty much only pvp improvements so if you're ranking to 10 for that sweet spell power set 50/50 holy/prot is completely viable. They're great at aoe farming as well So you can also be a rich healer for once.
---
But they changed it in classic already, its part of vanilla, how can u be crushed by this, it was totally expected..
---
Pre 1.7 the pure dps couldn't do much damage because of threat issues so hybrid DPS 100% were brought to endgame things. Also pre Talent changes things like Retribution 31 point talent as Blessing of Kings made them more viable.
---
The talent buff to pure classes and removal of Spec specific utility killed hybrid dps. Don't pretend you know what you're talking about.
---
Same situation. Met a girl at the gym a few weeks ago, it was going great. Then I remembered I have plans for the summer, so it isn’t going to work out.
---
That’s like getting a gf on Feb 13.

I dont like this, i want the longer more grindy version of AV. Or battleground farm will just end up beeing; During week, AV premades. During Weekends, Weekly BG. Personally i dont like the fast AV's because it just become to profitable honor/per hour. And it makes it harder to get WSG and AB during "non-weekends"
---
Imagine if a single raid took 2 days, and there was a solid 50 percent chance that you fail the whole thing. It's not about instant gratification. It's about an already grindy system (honor) potentially being even more grindy just because some people on reddit say they found it more fun.
---
I personally wouldn't mind if they balanced the games to take longer or even much longer, just so long as the honor per hour is kept the same.

---
I disagree.  My Undead Rogue was smooth and savvy as hell, and he wouldn't be able to sneak up on *anything* if he left a damn snail trail of drool everywhere he went.  And god help you as a caster if any of your spells had verbal components.
---
i replied to another post above in defense of 1.12 AV but i also agree with this.  AV and later IoC were flawed in the same way that they discouraged 'real' pvp, but AV is still iconic it's own way.  I don't think AV needs to be analyzed to the ground about how it shoud be when it was never a serious pvp mode in the first place

Or you could grow a pair, play some D and force a long game.
---
The thing is that the honor system was already disgustingly time consuming. You don't have to be a minmax no fun tryhard to not want to massively extend that grind. Imagine if a single raid took two whole days and there was a roughly 50 percent chance you fail, every single time. And the rewards weren't increased. Now tell me, do you think the raiders would complain? And if they did, would you tell them they're being too tryhard for not wanting to slow down progress 10 fold?

When I was in Alterac I didnt even care for winning it. For me it was just a big world PvP zone. Thats what I loved about it because it is completly unique in the game.
---
Ther alterac that came after is just completly different and I absolutly can not understand why they wouldnt have the good alterac versions in their CLASSIC wow installment.
---
Yup. I played the Alterac ALL the time, even after getting all the gear. It was my favorite part of vanilla honestly.
---
The NPC nerf really gutted it.
---
I don't know how you made it through TBC. The T5 dungeons had huge skill-checks as both final bosses and you simply needed a solid 25 man raid to get through. You could maybe carry 2-3 deadweight. All the casual guilds I know got stuck on T5, even after repeated nurfs, until they simply made it not a requirement for T6.
---
Smash and dash 
---
Do they have arenas in WoW Classic or is it just BG grinding?
---
Lmao...I wanna use my powers for self defense, but this looks fun too.
---
It would be an interesting experiment for sure, but I think you'd be amazed to find that the "harder" one would almost never pop.  People will talk about loving 3 day AVs till they are blue in the face, but people also tend to go with the path of least resistance and you'd likely see the quick one popping constantly as opposed to the long one.
---
When it comes to game design sometimes its really not best to give a player a choice.  Its kind of like when people argue about flying mounts and how it ruined wpvp and exploring, they will get people who go "well just don't fly then you're choosing to fly".  The problem is even the people who dislike flying because of how it affected exploration and questing will usually still do it just because its "how the game is".
---
If you give people a choice between 3 day AV with a ton of mobs and korak, and then give them a version with nerfed NPCs and no miniboss and its generally 10x faster, almost everybody will gravitate towards the easy one.
---
Well, you certainly aren't the only one to make a clickbait title to your post.
---
"Comprehensive" is right, jesus.
---
Great work!
---
You need any help wiring up a more user friendly UI? (With buttons, easy filtering, etc.) I know that's generally a pain, but imma have some free time, wouldn't mind taking a tab at it.

&gt; play whatever Race and Class you think is the coolest
---
Omg what a TERRIBLE advice. What a cruel "advice" when people will realize after 250h if they made a mistake.
---
No no no, make damn sure that your class and role is what you want.

I mean to be fair, yes a bit. But on average the leather will still go to Druids since it's the best for them.

These ***SPECIALIZATIONS*** (i.e. Talent Trees) perform in the bottom 50% in every aspect of the game. They are not good in PVP for the reasons stated before. They aren't even in the top 50% for solo play, but either way that is absolutely NOT an important factor in an MMO. It's all about group play. This isn't god of war. I even answered this further in my other 2 posts right above your comment.
---
We never cleared a single raid tier.  Just farmed the earlier bosses in all of them.  Our raid schedule was basically like, Gruul, Loot Reaver, the first ~3-4 bosses in Hyjal, and the first few bosses in BT.  It was frustrating, but also my first real raiding experience, and I really liked all the players.  When WotLK dropped and we were able to distill our core down to the 12 excellent players, we breezed through all of the 10-man hard modes.  But we still never cleared any of the 25-man tiers.
---
First off, I don't represent this sub.  A lot of stuff they complain about is pedantic.
---
Getting to the point, you are oversimplifying the argument.  The old AV is a specific example of poor game design.  Blizzard clearly wasn't happy with it which is why they made many modifications to AV from 1.5 to 1.12.
---
3 day turtlefests aren't particularly interesting.  People are basing their opinions off of 14 year old experiences.  If every AV was as long as the old AV's were nobody would queue for them after a month.
---
Sindragosa wants a chat with you 
---
I suggest you evaluate your priorities. There will always be time for women and children, but the Classic launch is once in a lifetime. 
---
Eh....fair enough I guess
---
First off, picking a race depends on how the small details are important to you. Do you wish to min/max or play it casual? Imo race selection is only important if you wish to push your character to its best potential. If not, any race combination is fine. Just look at what racials you prefer or the playstyle you want to go for.
---
For me, I would go for Troll or Orc if I'd pick a hunter. Trolls: Bow spec is useful for Hunters, Berserking is nice for the attack speed buff and regen is definitely a useful tool for minimum downtime while leveling. Orcs are also good if you wish for a more melee spec with a hunter.
---
For mages, I would definitely pick troll. The cast speed boost is a nice bonus to leveling and running instances. HP5 is also always useful.
---
For priests, the general consensus is to pick forsaken because of the special priest racials [Touch of Weakness](http://classicdb.ch/?spell=2652) and [Devouring Plague](http://classicdb.ch/?spell=2944). The former is an okay tool and the latter is very good if you wish to spec Shadow while leveling (which I would recommend). However, trolls also have very good racials, [Hex of Weakness](http://classicdb.ch/?spell=9035) (which is really good in dungeons and raids) and [Shadowguard](http://classicdb.ch/?spell=18137), a useful tool while leveling (or if you wanna maximize your dps potential). Both races are good but I would personally lean more toward trolls (don't forget, you have the cast speed racial as well!).
---
This the ain't classic AV I long for :(
---
So little time? You literally have 2 months and 2 weeks until Summer even starts - and Classic probably won't release well into July. What could you possibly need to do in preparation that would take 3-4 months?
---
I get that we're all excited to see Classic return, but that's just nonsense.
---
That’s actually something I hadn’t considered. I just feel there has to be a way. The direction gaming is moving I feel like wow classic on console would be insane for the gaming industry
---
Thank you!!
---
Just play good def and you can make AV as long as you need.
---
Guess it depends on the server. On Malfurion the NPC nerf was all it took to make AV a non-pvp zerg rush. AV matches lasting 5-20 minutes were the new norm.
---
The first time I went to Darnassus I saw 3 NPCs with mounts and didnt know they were NPCs. I thought they were max lvl players flexing HARD. I actually said out loud "Nice mount" and they kept walking. I've never felt like a bigger loser then watching them keep walking their patrol route.
---
We're going back to the mid 2000s when people were seeking professional help for WoW addiction. I see no problem with this. #nochanges

I'd argue that if someone starts playing something that doesn't appeal to them, they aren't likely to make it past the 30's.  They'll probably burn out and quit the game altogether if there's not some level of appeal.

As a priest through all of vanilla, thank you for your post.

Can only be done if the warrior is in a party with you.

Oh yeah it matters. Two weeks and it's a jungle and a whole lot of extra work. Once a week is pretty much as long as you can wait during the peak of summer without having a nightmare on your hands. Source: Texas

I tank a lot on vanilla and the true MVPs are the rogues who stun. Absolute legends.

Almost every Druid in TBC that was in a pvp spec had feral charge. As a result druids had 2(3 if Tauren) stuns, hibernate, cyclone, entangling roots &amp; natures grasp. Other than warlocks what other class had access to as many as 7cc abilities on 4 separate drs?
---
While the fact we arn't getting the real AV is already disappointing, as a WPvP main my heart is broken with the removal of the race specific turn ins.
---
I always kept a full set in my inventory, then when I was in a neutral town I could link the item in /say like \[Severed Night Elf Head\] to let the enemy know that I was going to fuck them up the moment they walked outside, and this was something I was specifically looking forward to (a lot actually). Yea it was half RP, and half mind games - but it was also 100% badass.

The Healer is the most powerful role in a Group. 
---
You can carry any dungeon group so fucking hard as a Healer. It's the most exciting role for me. The cherry on top is also the Mana-Management in Classic. It adds another level of depth.
---
I feel that the minimum skill level required to heal a Dungeon is far, far lower than that of a tank. He’ll, the tank needs to know all the encounters beforehand, which isn’t much of a problem for a 15 year old game. But, my level 20 Shadow Priest wandered into Wailing Caverns and had no trouble, despite never healing a Dungeon before. 
---
Will post there but I might inspire some good ideas here.
---
Why would you need a subwoofer to hear spell effects... 
---
This is pretty twisted. Even for the internet...
---
Yeah, they said at Blizzcon that they did not have any patch versions before 1.12. So if we were to somehow get AV before 1.12, it would have to be coded from scratch most likely. 
---
Imo the best initial gear you can get for feral pvp is actually the pvp blue set. That’s not easy to get, however. Tier 0.5 unfortunately also won’t launch with the game (that gives pretty decent feral stats).
---
Below is a video showing pre-raid BiS for feral druid pve dps. While not all examples are great (that helm is really not that big of a deal in pvp) it’s still a good starter:
---
https://youtu.be/a_b-vtx67eU
---
Druid does have survivability but hit and run is too general to consider as a strategy. You will have moments in a fight when, against a melee, you will want to put some distance, but generally assume that once you start the fight, you are commited to it. The high ceiling comes from knowing when and what to use. Against melees you might bear stun and cast entangling roots to get some room, heal, and then cast a wrath+moonfire before jumping back in. With casters however you will always want to stay on them, even after stun+heal.
---
I would advise against using cat bleed as it does next to potato damage and you could use that energy to cast a shred, positioning yourself behind the target. Also never sit too much in cat at first since it makes you vulnerable, even against casters. Your lack of damage and less hp makes cat a weak option once they start targeting you. After you get epic pvp set, cat becomes much more viable. Until then however you will spend around two thirds of a fight in bear form, due to higher HP and stun/charge. Never try to out-dps somebody. If you don’t care about faction i’d advise going tauren for the extra stun. Not obligatory however; i’ve seen perfectly good nelf druids in pvp.
---
Get ready to raid too. The best feral weapons drop in raids (BWL, AQ, Naxx). they are druid specific weapons too so you will only have to outbid other druids for them (save your DKP). Raiding also means healing, but if you find a guild that accepts you without a respec then you should be fine; if not, go for 0/30/21 which is still a feral hybrid.  
---
As the video above shows, if you’re really devoted and lucky you might find a guild willing to accept you in raids as feral. If that’s the case, i congratulate you. Remember however that you always need to bring your A-game to reach even mid-dps meter. If you half-arse it you risk falling even below the tank and that’s pretty bad. Good news is that AQ set has feral stats, Naxx too IIRC. So vanilla-end feral is actually pretty strong if you stick to raiding.
---
Pro-tip: as a druid you can solo quite a few dungeon bosses, mainly the ones without adds or spell damage that are tank&amp;spank and not immune to stun. Sneak in to them, find a safe place to pull and then get ready for a 5-10 minute fight. Heal on stun and use bear heal when stun fails. Get some potions too.
---
Get Exalted in 24-36 hours after AV release, then never play again unless on AV weekends (if going for PVP gear). :)

Just in case they drown in magma...*Wait a minute*

Most of the crafting professions in Vanilla WoW were money sinks, not money makers, for a vast majority of players.  Alchemy and Enchanting could make you some money but both require significant time and material cost to get to where you can make any money with them.
---
Let other people do the crafting if you want to make more money, and just pick up skinning with herbalism/mining to make more money while leveling.  Download something like Auctionator to speed up auction posting.
---
My vanilla experience was the server being down for most of the day... I'd like to not repeat that, or have new players experience that.
---
Care to elaborate? Isn’t protection a talent tree for them?
---
&gt;shit retail AV.
---
that'd include reinforcements, though. 
---
I don't think it requires much effort for any role to do wailing caverns. It's good that at least one person knows what direction to go.
---
why would you bother responding to duels with people you arent grouped with?
---
Haha what?
---
&gt; Imagine trying to do a dungeon without a healer without relying on kiting strategies that avoid damage altogether.
---
I believe a group 5-manned ZF with 5 level appropriate mages. The idea was, whoever got aggro would kite until the mob got close then ice block. They had one fire Mage who died repeatedly. 
---
to **feel** them
---
&gt;you can play it on retail, and have been able to for over a decade!
---
No reinforcements, or further changes, so this is inaccurate, and it strikes me as fairly obvious. 
---
&gt;Give us our version to play too.
---
Which one? 1.5, 1.8? All of them? Why? 
---
Any physical damage class could benefit from the weapons, but only warrior/paladin can use most of the armor.  I think there was some shaman/hunter armor maybe?  but you should look that up before taking my word for it.
---
Don’t hate the way I RP
---
The whole "risking losing all their hardwork" is kinda a meme mate. That stuff is really really rare, even nostalrius technically came back, all the characters were revived and the server lived on though with less pop. 
---
I have troubles sorting out the different patch AVs in my memory, but all I can remember is everyone on the hill trying to snipe Korak for the  quest. You could basically go to Hillsbrad and experience the same between Southshore and TM - a meatgrinder of 40v40 without any real goals or benefits because it never ended. 
---
I made it to exalted several times on alts for the Unstoppable Force (as it was a good weapon for a Warrior to start at 60). But I definitely did this past 1.12 and it was still a great BG. Absolutely nothing compared to what we have today. 
---
It's basically a warrior without taunts and damage mitigation both in terms of cooldowns and base abilities.
---
Their threat is inflated by very gimmicky sources such as potions/buffs etc.
---
Well Dark Irons are assholes in classic just like Grimtotems and such so I don’t care for those, thank though! I’ll stick to Alliance then.
---
So long as it simply adds to the player add and we get to play with each other. 
---
As soon as a guildie of mine said “You should pull with auto shot, and use a shot spell between auto-shots for maximal dps.” I thought “I’m in love. 
---
What if the crafter is working off of customer's mats only? Would charging a service fee be acceptable then?
---
I played a lock for awhile and I would farm a ton of soul shards just to spend half of them summoning people who were busy heating up tendies while everybody else was running to the raid.
---
I would usually let it slide but I kept notes of people who had to be summoned every time and I would 
---
This is disappointing, but I'm willing to overlook this on the basis that they moved to 6 content patches.
---
Let's be real, 1.5 AV is more fun but after you do hit exalted you never want to do it again. There are more important issues.
---
What career gets you a 7/70? That sounds awesome. I’ve been hoping a 4/10 or the 9/80 becomes commonplace
---
Paid sick time accrual is the law in my state
---
Underbite meaning the jaw exposed right?
---
If its any comfort, I remember AV as it was.  It looks like it will die with those of us who were there.  If Blizzard decides to go through with this decision instead of a 1.8 or earlier build I'm cutting off my investment to this project &amp; just moving on.  Its getting so far away from an authentic Classic experience that I don't even care anymore.
---
This is the entire reason I'm even considering rolling on a server that a big steamer is on
---
not that significant, as both are almost always just a race to kill the boss
---
From what I remember they don’t have taunts so it’s not great
---
They can do dungeons but not raids
---
No taunt
---
Mana issues
---
No defensive CDs
---
Paladins can tank dungeons, and that's about it.
---
Not having taunt, poor threat regen, poor itemization from raids, just means that anyone raiding with a paladin tank even with salvation is going to bore themselves to sleep over not being able to dps. 
---
What you mean is ISOLATED servers, not dedicated. They already are dedicated servers by definition. 
---
Paladins are not raid tanks in Vanilla. You can tank dungeons and do good aoe damage/threat but its pretty annoying without a taunt and you go oom all the time.
---
wouldn't matter if it's just a race
---
Yeah it was cheesy. Really damaged the fun potential.
---
But again, it only happened after the NPCs were nerfed. I guess they saw the potential for better honor/hour at that point, not sure.
---
For professions, it depends on how committed you are to making money or crafting yourself items while leveling. Picking 1 or 2 harvesting professions is a must if you wanna maximize your gold, so always at least pick 1. Herb is very good, some can be expensive especially in late game; skinning is also useful since most beasts are skinnable (and you'll kill a lot of them, so why waste it?). Mining is good depending on which class you pick, but it can be a good source of gold. 
---
I would personally recommend doing this strat: pick your harvesting professions on your main and level an alts crafting on the side with some of the ingredients! For example, if you pick tailoring, leatherworking or enchanting, you'll be able to craft bags, quivers (if you play hunter) and cloth greens. If you have enchanting, you'll be able to disenchant those items (and any greens your main may mail to your alt) and with those resource craft some wands to help you in the early levels. 
---
Having those professions early can be very useful especially if you have a cloth class since you can craft some greens to fill your gear slots (in case you're unlucky looting). And on top of that, you can use your alt as a an extra bank and make him stay in a major city to go auction your stuff while your main is far away leveling, so you won't waste any time!
---
Another thing: never vendor your leathers or herbs. Always auction them, and make sure you look at the current prices to get the most out of your ingredients.
---
Final thing: if you wanna take things slow and steady, or in the case where you really want to make yourself gear while leveling on your main, pick either leatherworking/skinning or tailoring/something else (like enchanting, always useful). It's slower but you're definitely gonna like having some crafted greens when your gear gets outdated and any recipes you find will be useful. On top of that, you can auction any extra crafted items you make for a pretty penny, depending on what recipes you get (rare recipes can make you a ton of gold!). Having a max level profession is always a plus, on any character. But don't be afraid to drop one if it's not useful to you anymore, especially at max level.
---
And you keept going on about reckoning as well which in integral to prot and is as much of "slot machine" as getting % increase to crit. You will always get crit in pvp. Both ret and enh work in pvp even if they have to be geared through a different spec, stuff doesn't have to be the absolute best to be viable. 
---
I really can't see how you think that being stronger on your own without a group is somehow bad. Is getting mats and trading not part of the mmo experience?
---
I love everything about druid EXCEPT healing at 60, so I'm afraid if I spend what little time I've got with the game having fun leveling to 60 I'm then gonna be stuck with a class that has to do one specific role in PvE that I don't like doing :/
---
You are blowing this way out of proportion. This is the version of AV that existed for the longest duration in Vanilla. This backwards understanding of what is your preferred version of Vanilla isn’t everyone’s. Attempting to speak for everyone like this is toxic and insulting to the educated people who actually prefer the 1.12 version. I have fond memories of long battles in this version of AV during Vanilla. 
---
Kids are a way worse thing to plan on to ruin you life
---
Technically speaking, it has plenty of damage mitigation. It can block, parry, has Devotion Aura, etc.
---
Their threat is generated from healing/seals. It's not any more*gimmicky* than needing to spam Revenge, after a dodge/block/parry as a warrior.
---
If you're not a warrior, no one will want you raid tanking bosses.
---
This is an assumption based on what information has been released, but if they bring back the vanilla attack table like they probably will, any tank besides warrior is going to be subject to crushing blows, and probably crits as well.  In addition, itemization is simply not there for any class other than warrior to tank beyond 5-mans and raid off-tanking.  So you basically don't have the ability toolkit or the itemization to tank bosses unless you're a warrior.  And, even if you're willing to settle for a back seat role, you'll have to beat out ALL the OT warriors to do it.  So, good luck with that.
---
Now, if you're not interested in raiding, then druid, paladin, and even shaman can tank dungeons all the way up through 60.
---
For the millionths time... NO!
---
Are you seriously comparing planned parenthood to a fucking videogame?
---
I disagree, I think you underestimate how many people will be watching classic wow steamers. Don't get me wrong, I don't watch them. A huge amount of people do though. A seriously huge amount of people
---
I started on one but I don't want to lose that magical feel when it does release so I stopped at level 12.
---
I mean not really. Current psever AV forces players to take objectives and even rewards you for defending towers while winning. Games take at least 15 min.
---
It sure is a lot better than back when it was more similar to this version where it was literally 6-10 min wins where everyone raced to opposite base, killed generals and then vann(or horde equivalent bc ally usually won). No pvp no nothing.
---
Precisely. I really think this is something where rose tinted glasses *are* playing a part. While some Vanilla players will be returning, a large portion of the player base will be younger gamers, the novelty of long AVs will not last, even amongst players in favour of a slower paced experience.
---
I honestly think this is the best thing for the continued interest in AV throughout the lifespan of Classic.
---
Yeah, priest races are very much important to consider before starting out.
---
All classes offer something, assuming you're ok doing what they offer to do well. So yea, paladins are great as long as you want to heal. So in a macro sense, there's some balance, but on an individual spec sense, there's strong imbalance.
---
Still, Vanilla is still way better than TBC for the simple reason of the great leveling experience and that all the content lives in Azeroth rather than Outlands. The imbalances are masked a bit by the fact that you know what you're getting into in advance. In current WoW, it might feel bad to play a mage right now because Blizzard isn't addressing them balance-wise and there's an expectation going in that they will and should. In classic, if you go in intending to play a Ret paladin, it's all on you. Blizzard isn't coming to save the day with a patch. So pick the class and spec you know you'll be happy with.
---
Playing what is the coolest sounds like youd be pretty sure of that choice.
---
More likely they will be based on what update it is. Something like DM release is bound to be pretty early. 
---
Fine, I'll play alliance anyway. I'll have fun killing y'all stinky undead edgelords :P
---
Here's a simple question - does ganking a low level enemy that comes up as grey give dishonour points?
---
I just thought I would let him know. Imo it is significant since in the reinforcement variant there can never exist a long AV match.
---
The earlier the better for me. I'm doing a full time internship this summer and then going to grad school next term, so I'll have much more time to play July/August.
---
Life as a dps warrior is tough. Glad I'm playing a caster as my main this go around. 
---
maybe on a 2 year old realm, good luck getting a righteous orb for under 75g each on ANY realm under a year old.
---
If I have a hybrid who is not happy playing a healer I'll probably just kick them.
---
A well geared Druid can tank 5 mans just fine, but I wouldn’t even attempt a 50+ level instance with a pally tank. Sure it’s possible but it’s unnecessary rough. 
---
You haven't played 1.12 for very long have you?
---
Hibernate -&gt; almost useless, any competent player will shift out before it lands  
---
Roots -&gt; very little use against any non melee  
---
Pounce -&gt; requires stealth... good for opening and being annoying but very little use as CC
---
Bash -&gt; has to survive miss/resist/dodge/parry rolls, nice but very unreliable  
---
Charge -&gt; a short snare and very easy to see coming interrupt  
---
Cyclone is a CC that immunes the target, preventing heals and damage. Which is both often and upside or a downside making it a very unique and powerful CC...
---
Late summer, less kids to deal with
---
Righteous Fury giving 110% threat gen is "Poor"? Sure must suck holding threat just by healing yourself.
---
That's what im referring to. 
---
When they say "your mats +5g" for example.
---
Just a personal peeve of redundancy. Back on retail people didn't often do this, tipping was called tipping for a reason and it was just expected.
---
Druids are great tanks, but there is some old fashioned people who have rolled warriors who can’t handle competition. Druids have some drawbacks compared to warriors and vice versa. Both are tier 1 tanks with palas being tier 2, and shamans tier 3. 
---
Not talking about crashing the server, I sure hope that won't happen in today's day and age. Simply worried about queue times to get into the server
---
&gt; This is the version of AV that existed for the longest duration in Vanilla. 
---
The other thread someone did the math, and it was the 1.8 version that was around the longest.
---
&gt; It can block, parry, Devotion Aura 
---
All classes can parry, anyone who wears a shield can block and Devotion Aura is just flat armor. Your examples are as garbage as they get.
---
Not being sarcastic, that was actually super handy. The comparison between ret and balance was easy to conceptualize for me. That said, I'd love a full comparison write up if you're still down. Hope classes are going well. Undergrad or grad school? 
---
So we just run to the end of the race as fast as possible but theres no timer?
---
And only if it's a Tuesday, but not if the Tuesday coincides with a full moon, unless the moon is visible at 3pm, but not if the temperature is below 25°C
---
Yes
---
Crossplay would be amazing too, and like I said with keyboard and mouse on console there’s not much holding it back
---
nah
---
warriors are tier 1
---
druids are like tier 10
---
paladins tier 99
---
there are no other tiers
---
It's definitely the hardest role. You have the most important job that requires the most execution, you're the group leader and are expected to know the dungeon layouts, boss mechanics, proper pull techniques, and to keep a pace while monitoring your group to make sure they are keeping up and doing their jobs. You often are the group leader and are responsible for forming and communicating in all aspects. 
---
And while some groups are laid back and this isn't always the case, a lot of people have it in their minds that it will be, thus the anxiety you often hear people prescribe to tanking. Everyone has been in a group with a bad tank and felt the consequences. They don't want to be that guy. 
---
Tanking is tough and is not for everyone. There are a lot of people who are interested in dps warriors, but not tanking. It is immensely rewarding if you can rise to the challenge though. 
---
Petty for a mage? Giving r1 arcane int to save my own mana. Maybe following them around and polymorphing their targets if they really pissed me off. 
---
It's not the original, original map. But it is before the horde base was moved back. And that is where the maps differ. One server tries to add all the features back of 1.5 like land mines and there being herb and mining nodes in the map. Others just try to emulate the 1.12 version.
---
My mage in vanilla was the no jaw model.  His name was Na
---
As in "What's your name?" 
---
"NAAAAA!"
---
And what does a warrior have over a paladin? Your examples don't even exist. :V
---
That was likely due to the addon that would do something strange and attempt to queue an entire 40 man group into the same AV. I remember abusing that with my guild after raid.
---
Nope, you got passive bonus honor in AV that heavily outweighed honor from kills, especially since honor from kills diminishes the longer a match lasts. 
---
I was specifically responding to you saying how you would quit a match and come back 8 hours later and the match would still be ongoing. This is maybe cool for you just because it is a unique experience, but is it really that much better than coming back 8 hours later to a different game? Meanwhile the guy who has been in there for 8 hours doesn't want to leave because of how much time he has sunk in and if he left now he wouldn't get the honor from the match ending, but he is so bored he wants to blow his brains out.
---
Ok I'll bite. What makes you say they are comparable?
---
Ah, I thought you were talking about crafters that would sell you a crafted piece and then charge a service fee on top of that.
---
Frankly I don't see anything wrong with a crafter charging for their service if you bring the mats. They went through the effort to level the profession and get the recipe (assuming dungeon/raid drop). They should be compensated for their labor, and a service fee guarantees that rather than relying on people to be good natured enough to tip.
---
Okay, you're either trolling or genuinely never going to understand because it's a very simple concept. This is my last attempt.
---
First, Reckoning was only good when it wasn't working as intended. Back before this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX2JEKVn-U4
---
You don't even understand the /sit macro meta to force crit and reckbomb someone. That's simply exploiting spaghetti code and is not an argument AGAINST fixing the class.
---
Second, that is a prot spec.
---
Retribution
---
Enhancement
---
Balance
---
ANYTHING else you mention is irrelevant to what I am discussing and is at best a tangent and at worst a simple deflection of your own inability to genuinely rebuke me.
---
They perform in the BOTTOM 50% of PVP. That is not viable.
---
I really can't see how you think I am saying being stronger on your own is a bad thing unless you are genuinely trolling. I am saying that "This talent tree can solo well" is NOT a viable reason to make their group play utter trash and below 50% in every aspect of the game. The whole thing is moot in any case, because those three talent trees ALSO sit snugly in the bottom 50% for solo play.
---
I have done all I can to explain this to you. So please don't fill my inbox with another notification unless you have something relevant to argue. You have now tried to counter my statement of "XYZ do not get the opportunity to even be average in anything" with "Yeah, but Q is totally awesome!!!!!!!"
---
You're mistake about the market value of righteous orbs. They were cheap enough when I was leveling my warrior back on Elysium less than 2 months after it launched that I enchanted my thrash blade with crusader at level 50. I'm not currently playing on a server but if you log onto a popular vanilla private server right now and check their prices I'd bet good money they'll be close to 25g each than 75g.
---
Hey guys, my new ScoreCraft episode is out! This time I'm recounting the tale of our expedition through the dark portal, the bastion of Honor Hold and the music that plays there. Really hope you enjoy it!
---
How are you making that kind of money with Dire Maul not being out on release? Are you going to be on a pve server? Are you going to bother with professions (outside of 1 enchanting to d/e stuff)?
---
I play wow with a 2.1 setup and it is pretty badass to feel my lock’s lifetaps.
---
Gonna check them out! Thanks comrade 
---
exactly, which isn't fun
---
Yes, I'll bet my horse those addons will be allowed &amp; released within a couple days of release tops.
---
"I disagree. My Undead Rogue was smooth and savvy as hell, and he wouldn't be able to sneak up on anything if he left a damn snail trail of drool everywhere he went."
---
The snail trail can be used to deceive. Pull your tongue all the way out and use it to make false trails. Then pop that sucker back in for later. 
---
"And god help you as a caster if any of your spells had verbal components."
---
We gurgle in the old tongue. I'm talking deep magics son.
---
Glad im not the only one :D
---
Just spending too many hours on something that will frustrate and disappoint you with intermittent joy that keeps bringing you back
---
Troll
---
absolutely!
---
You're wrong about the market value of righteous orbs. They were cheap enough when I was leveling my warrior back on Ely less than 2 months after it launched that I enchanted my thrash blade with crusader at level 50.

---
the old long grind AV was fun as hell :D sure.. not good for honor but was good fun!
---
In what way do warlocks up shadow priest damage?
---
Sorry, I’ve never heard that before!
---
Probably. I was young and dumb and lawful good.
---
Got Ice Cold Milk?
---
Think about it for half a second though, if it's a big streamer like asmongold, towellie or any of the other shit PvE streamers, they either won't roll a PvP server or they will have a raid at their disposal day and night. Sure it'd be nice to gank them for their awful content but chances are it'll never be a fair fight. 
---
Are mining and herb nodes even in 1.12 AV?
---
Yes it is poor.
---
currently playing on 3 different realms, prices vary from 35g on the cheapest to 75g on the most expensive.  ALL of these realms are over a year old.
---
Improved shadowbolt increases shadow damage taken by the target by 20% after a shadowbolt ctit.
---
Might be a tbc talent tbh, i started then
---
Most players don’t care about that stuff, especially if their classes get good pvp gear from raiding. Besides that once most pvpers get their wanted rank (13/14) they don’t care either about DKs.
---
Pretty simple really; if you want to avoid DKs, wpvp in endgame zones (EPL, Silithus etc.)
---
I say no to dailies and flying, other than that tbc was good, specially for class balance
---
Curse of recklessness max rank on all the mobs when people steal the tag with instant damage when i already engaged.
---
Its often the ones getting hungry and pulling more than one mob. So they take a shit ton of damage and have to stop and eat.
---
Im obviously talking about leveling here.
---
No kidding lol. He wants an update for an update telling us everything is gonna be ok. Like your nervous dog that barks the entire time you're gone for work.
---
I work in a medical laboratory. I’m the guy who runs the tests that doctors will order. Seems like a lot of places are doing away with the 7/70s, but I’ll take it. Only work half the year really and still get paid like a 40hr/week
---
Makes sense to me that they are using a 1.12 version of AV considering they're using a 1.12 version of vanilla. I don't know how this goes against the whole #nochanges argument considering the game is being played on 1.12 from the outset
---
Senior in undergrad, walking to my room now
---
Honestly your assumption that an older realm will have lower prices is fundamentally flawed. There's more gold in the economy compared to a new launch.
---
Dude after cata I literally could no longer heal through the heroics I had been grinding. I had no idea if somehow I actually just sucked or what, but I'd go oom on trash and people would be dying left and right. Made me stop playing honestly. I wasn't the best druid healer but my gear was certainly like average and I had a decent understanding of the strategy. And at that point in the game people had ZERO tolerance for any kind of fuckin around with wiping or waiting for Mana. The tank would just keep pulling mobs one after another and then we'd all die because, yo, no mana douchebag.
---
Then they'd just bail on the party and I'd just give up lol
---
You don't need DM if you're multiboxing a whole group.
---
Professions will be: Engineering+Enchanting on the pally, skinning on one member of each 5man while leveling.
---
All non-pally characters will be alchemists+tailors for arcanite+mooncloth cooldowns, with the exception of one which will be a leatherworker for thickleather profit.
---
Hmm yeah, that actually might be a nice goal to have.
---
Numbers, pl0x :V
---
Just include feign death.
---
Crossrealm BGs were in vanilla. Why wouldn't they be in classic?
---
Just your typical Classical FM radio (I'm from Montreal).  I listen to it every now and then but I never knew about these gaming theme friday nights. Pretty cool indeed :)
---
That's absolutely what's happening. At no point have they talked about changing stats - they've only talked about delaying item introductions until later content releases.
---
If you think that classic will have progressive itemisation, please do not flood this place with complaints when release happens because at no point have blizzard promised that. 
---
As an aside, their reference client doesn't even have the old data anyway - and they aren't going to rely on third party sources.
---
I seem to recall “FOR FUCK SAKES DONT FIGHT IN THE CENTER” turtles then too.
---
Nostalgia really is a hell of a drug lol 
---
It’s just bullshit that they love the earlier versions, because nobody remembers them and they were changed for a reason. 
---
You have a valid complaint. Especially since warlocks are one of the more difficult dps classes and many people suck. But a good player won't do this to you. Don't hate all us warlocks :(. 
---
No arenas, they were introduced in TBC. We're not entirely certain about battlegrounds even - warsong gulch &amp; AV were added in 1.5, and [given the progressive 6-phase plan we've seen](https://www.shacknews.com/article/110428/wow-classic-lays-out-six-phase-content-plan), it's uncertain whether battlegrounds will be in at launch, or if it'll just be wpvp for a bit.
---
I am giving you EXACT PRICES ON A CURRENT REALM, well three of them.  
---
Prices fluctuate with demand, crusader becomes less useful once AQ is out.
---
He has all the rights to attempt to speak for others, if it is not liked he will be downvoted. If they agree, it will be upvoted
---
Bgs only and those probably not even  at launch
---
I've played hundreds of retail AV games and the reinforcements almost never matter, they decide maybe 5% of games. 1.12 AV is practically the same as BfA AV. The gameplay and strategies utilized is extremely similar. 
---
Go to r/wowservers as this sub is only for the official Blizzard release of Classic Wow
---
There is simply a handful of players on any given server that will *ever* make any marginal profit by going enchanting.
---
Those are extremely terrible odds. If you like the flavor, enjoy the idea, etc, then of course power to you and don't let anything stop you.
---
But if you're thinking about benefiting your character's strength or making gold, then literally any profession (other than Gnomish Engi) will make you far more gold than enchanting will (which is a net loss for most players, and not a marginal profit for ~99% of enchanters).
---
If you simply take any gathering profession, even skinning, you'll make far more gold than you could ever dream of.
---
Yes, if you are server first to get Crusader you'll make good gold for a while. But even that doesn't last. I'll tell you right now, on a 2 year old server at the moment, you can't give Crusader enchants away for free. Everyone that can afford the mats already has it, and if you do chant someone for it, you get 10g tip if you're lucky.
---
Contrast this with herbalism, where you can make a decent gold selling even simple Dreamfoil from day 1 to the very last week of the server's life.
---
Hibernate is incredibly useful in getting rid of hunter pets, and with nature’s grace/luck it was possible to get druids in travel form which was devastating. 
---
Roots have situational uses against range and are borderline broken against melee without a dispel.
---
Pounce, feral charge, and bash were all used in almost every single game. Resetting with stealth and reopening was a very big thing for some comps. Feral charge and bash were both great as an escape, interrupt, and stun. 
---
Cyclone is likely the druids most broken ability in pvp. The immune thing you act like it is a bad thing. With the enemy being immune you could eliminate the positive benefits of buffs, hots, incoming heals. Proper use of cyclone made the biggest difference of a duelist and a gladiator level Druid in TBC. 
---
Yes. Def alone against 40 people rushing over you
---
This is my main drive too. Absolutely doing pvp server but need to get to 60 before the contested zones get too violent. Even 50 should be good enough as the rest can be grinded out in 5 mans. 
---
You cant hold threat by healing yourself as a Paladin - Paladin heals have a -50% threat component to them compared to other healers.
---
Yea, i think most people probably haven't tried it, you're right. But 1.12 AV is no fun for anyone.
---
If AV was it its original state it would be such a huge event when it would be released. EVERYONE would wanna try it, it would be so much fun. Even if some shit like mines and archers were OP i still prefer that to the ignore-all-npcs 1.12 AV.
---
I'm the night elf who shadowmelds in front of the flag and doesn't move when the horde take it.
---
Like afk-ing, but with extra steps.
---
I just remembered a german webside host who was pretty big then. There was no twitch in 2006 but he had an internet radio show. Whenever he hosted events, he picked a low pop server and made stuff like gnome runs to og etc. Servers back then couldn't handel it. His main server on the other hand was alright. Populated but not over the top. Maybe in the begining there will be some fanboys who jump on the same server like there favorite streamer, but in the long run I don't belive that it will be an huge problem.
---
Just because you were a frustrating disappointment to your parents doesn't mean every child is. Fucking hell man
---
Wilco thanks
---
Well, you can always tell your raid "No soup for you!"
---
on the subject of more money in the economy, that is also flawed logic because EVERY player that quits removes money from the economy.. Older realms have fewer players than fresh realms, meaning people have quit and that money is REMOVED from the economy.
---
I believe there was a leak of info about all of this, that people worked for a shitty salary (but tbh, 60.000$ for me sounds like a dream, I wonder if the cost of living in the US, California exactly, is so fucking expensive) manipulated to stay there because of passion, because if you start to complain about your payment "You will get instantly replaced by bunch of other people that want to work in Blizzard because it's prestigious to have a title of working/previously being a worker of Blizzard".
---
They will quit the game when they play a character like a shadow priest who is literally brought to a raid just to be a mana battery
---
That's an excellent point. If they have a raid with them, I'll need a raid of my own. Sounds like a proper vanilla warzone is on the horizon!
---
On Malf the players were trying to queue as a raid, sort of. Organized in Ventrilo and queueing at the same time on a countdown. Didn't often get everyone but could usually get most of the players into the same AV.
---
It was pretty unfair but that's what started happening after the NPC nerfs.
---
Cross straps for the added BDSM for rogues and their hitting it from behind ways, iron jaw for warriors, glow eyes for casters. 
---
It is known. 
---
This sub doesn’t encourage the promotion of private servers, but you can google it and find the one that most people seem to use pretty easily. 
---
This is the thing that will make or break it for me. I remember the joy of days-long AVs, and if Blizz doesn't change their mind on this one, I probably won't be playing classic.
---
See, they don't mention that in the tooltips. :V Thanks for clarifying.
---
Blizzard still combats bots. It's an eternal arms race between bots and bot-detection, so nowadays they ban in huge waves, refining their banhammer before striking so that fewer slip through the cracks.
---
I don't have any stats on botting in wow over time, but whenever I stop by r/wow I don't see massive outrage over bots, so I assume Blizzard is keeping them from being too outrageous.
---
Thought your name was crackhead_tv at first. It fit pretty well. You must be smoking some if you think private servers are vanilla and if you got the idea that I didn't play 1.12 for very long from my comment.
---
I played it as long as anyone else who played in 06. About 3-4 months. Shocker for you, Vanilla was so much more than a single one of it's 12 major content patches. People can still talk about actual Vanilla even though Blizzard went with the lazy option of using 1.12 client base. It's useful as an example to show that real Vanilla changed constantly and if you want an authentic Vanilla experience it involves rolling changes to mechanics. Go play on {insert private server name here since automod removes comments that name them for whatever reason}
---
Yes because defending your boss in your base is the same as an epic long battle with reinforcements 
---
Wrong, did you even play then?
---
I gave you an example and you rejected it because it doesn't fit what YOU want it to do.  Why should I bother wasting my effort on another example if you're just going to make an excuse for why that area of the game doesn't matter, either?
---
That's awesome! I'm going to try to find that.
---
I think there will absolutely be fanboys who follow the big streamers wherever they go. Maybe that's not a problem at all, we've yet to see
---
It's gone anyway, long AV's will never exist in classic due to the inherent difference of the playerbase. 
---
Every BG will be horde turtling for 35 minutes 
---
If  your team is incompetent and you are only one really playing any iteration of av sucks ass. 
---
What a monumental weak assed fail on Blizzard's part.
---
I encourage you to redo the math, because that is incorrect. 
---
&gt;isn’t a timer on how long horde have to win the game. 
---
Too real man
---
Quite a bit. 
---
A guy I know who fixed printers for 4 years in the military got an $80,000 starting salary in japan working for the us government with no degree or anything. $60,000 is abysmal in California
---
This was my understanding as well. There’s no reason to change the stats progressively, especially if the items themselves won’t all be available immediately.
---
It is only logical from everything they’ve said about using patch 1.12 as the basis for everything that the stats will mirror what they were during that patch. 
---
Why do you think turtleing in base is the same as an epic battle with reinforcements, summonable helpers and drops?
---
Not sure if referring to the skills available... Or just REALLY into the roleplay. 
---
(/s, making a joke about Paladins and Warlocks)
---
Yeah, in WoW you actually have to talk to people.
---
Guess which game I played for more than a month before I got bored and quit.
---
Okay, that's not fair, because every expansion starting with MoP I've done that with WoW.
---
\&gt;ragefire gasm
---
Probably won't need that much of a raid, those that follow the two I mentioned at least (I'm talking in-game and such) are usually just as awful as those two in general. Towellie I watched for a bit and got fed up of how many stupid questions he asked, he used twitch chat as his personal Wowhead voice assistant, and he's an awful player on top of it all.
---
I don't mean to bad mouth people who are making a living I just can't understand the entertainment value after the first 5 minutes. At least top pvp streamers are good at the game, or top raiders/m+  are usually doing new content noone has seen, or high keys. 
---
IMHO 1.7 was the high water mark. Afterward began the nerfs.
---
That was pretty much my point. Personally I will have herbalism on an alt rogue to make use of a few farms I couldn’t do with my main. The group I am Leveling/raiding with have predefined professions for various officers. Guild enchanter happens to be mine, so hypothetically I will get any and all recipes during guild runs. It really helps when you have a group of people that will trade you greens. For my part I am commiting to grinding certain reps like timbermaw hold during the leveling process.
---
I think it has to do with the experience vs just for the PVP rewards.
---
Some people want the big epic feel and working together to achieve it, where some just want max honor.
---
That is where the essence of the debate lies.
---
I would say I fall into both camps, some days I want that big battle and working to make it happen, having fun and living in the moment, and some days I just want to log in for an hour and grab as much as I can in that time so you keep moving ahead.
---
I have fond memories of playing AV almost all day on Saturday and even leaving for an hour to come back and the battle is still raging, then something breaks and the Horde would surge ahead and make a push, finally securing the alliance base and then walking that tightrope of trying to hold it, versus going back to defend the Horde base, lest the Alliance take advantage and make their own push.
---
Either way, i think some people are going to be disappointed and it is a tough call.
---
In the runs my friend I do (er...did...back in the day...) I'm typically around 10-12% of the group's damage as the healer, and the majority of it is wanding while I wait for regen.
---
People don't understand this. Even on pservers with "old av" had both teams still trying to zerg and win as quickly as possible
---
Very good and expected. AV is a total shit show on private servers that use the old versions. If you're not a stealth class, and you get separated from the group for any reason, you're basically dead weight to your team. Most NPCs are impossible to get around solo.
---
You're the first person accusing me of this.
---
Peace Leute,
---
zum Aufbau einer WOW CLASSIC Community habe ich einen Discord Sever erstellt auf dem ich euch mit den **neusten Infos zum Classic Release** versorge! Außerdem möchte ich eine Plattform bieten sich auszutauschen &amp; Gruppen zu finden.
---
Ziel ist es zum Release eine Gilde auf einem deutschen Sever zu gründen und das schon im Vorfeld hier zu planen. Langfristiges Ziel für die Gilde ist der Aufbau eines Stammraids um den Content regelmäßig zu clearen.
---
Grüße

Der Gamsch 
---
Fair enough, but this pleading to Blizzard as if he is some prophet of the people is so ridiculous to read over and over again. 
---
Pose a question, don’t cry to mommy every time you don’t get your way. 
---
Agreed. They had one chance after over a decade to do AV justice. They want my $15? Sorry, phoning in a huge part of endgame does not earn it.
---
I’m going to have to steal this. 
---
Thanks for the gold!
---
I just checked classic talents and it’s there! Thanks! TIL
---
Hi, /u/Eurothemist
---
It isn't an accusation.
---
If they are on a military base it could be they don't pay taxes. Having worked in food service for 10 years of my life I can tell you. The average food service place stays open at about a 2% profit margin. One of the things many of the fast food workers demanding higher pay don't get is that to work food service is to be a monkey grinding an organ for pennies. It's a horrible line of work and frankly as an industry food service should be tax exempt. 
---
If you are only working at a 2% profit margin. Imagine how valuable even a 1% tax cut is to you. Not only is everything you are doing far more profitable. It also opens up new profit venues that were just a little to expensive to be profitable before. 
---
Waiting for the group for a Dungeon? My Shadow Priest used to wait around dungeons waiting to heal without shadowform? And when some random Fury Warrior would challenge me, I’d shapeshifter and drink up before fighting. 
---
Old-school AV is how Warfronts should have been.
---
That can't be a serious question..
---
No you said solo play. Ret, Enh, Balance are all bottom 50% for solo play still. They don't excel in anything, but even if they did solo well, I am saying that "this spec can solo well" is not a viable reason to have them perform in the bottom 50% for everything group related in an MMO.
---
You aren't giving another example because there isn't one. Even though I know wholeheartedly that every single response you give me will be (as they have been) "Yeah well I gave you a response for Paladin that wasn't even the spec being discussed when you asked for an area of the game moonkin/balance was viable, on top of that area not being a factor in a group game. Why should I be bothered to even attempt to defend my view when I can just keep responding with 'nah man'?" I have still outlined my stance. You know why? Because my side actually has points to it and you have absolutely nothing of value to contribute to the dialogue
---
Nailed it. Offering us a shit version when a shittier version already exists doesn't cut the mustard.
---
Thanks for confirming, this is what I thought.  
---
Just rent the cat out to your neighbor for a few weeks 
---
Newsflash, furies! If a mob attacks the healer, you can taunt it!
---
See I never once found a guild who was willing to talk through anything because by the time I would get up to spec all the new dungeons/raids were basically run exactly the same based on the forums and shit so not knowing an aspect of a raid made me an idiot noob.
---
Really takes the fun out of everything. I transitioned to a warrior and it took months to find someone to actually explain how to effectively dps as one. Ugh.
---
The other thread said that 1.8 was longer by one day... It's a bit pedantic to decide which AV to use based on 24 hours of time that happened 15 years ago 
---
The blues comical "yuck!" crap made me want to punch my screen.
---
This is great tool. All it needs is a drop down list with common search queries.
---
I do want to point out though that they have only specified that the phased loot will be for the dungeon 1.10 revamp. I'm pretty sure that means that the 1.4 MC loot revamp is still in phase 1.
---
Doesn't really matter since i can just do Phase 4 to search.
---
That can't be a serious answer...
---
BYE don't let the door hit you on the way out.
---
ITT: backseat drivers with no experience or information on optimized paladin tank specs and viability.
---
I specifically don’t heal Warlocks during dungeons. If they say something, I’ll tell them that. So far, nobody’s said anything. 
---
I can no longer find their official policy on ninja looting, but it's my expectation that there isn't much GM intervention for ninja looting. As the story goes, server reputation is important so the community self-polices itself to keep people in line, join guild runs instead of pugs, yada yada
---
At the entrance of The Deadmines as a Mage you could blink past the instance portal. If you kept going you would eventually phase through the mesh and start falling through the world. If at that moment you used your Slow Fall spell you would glide to some water that you didn't lose any oxygen swimming through. Eventually you would surface and end up in this area. Remember someone showing me one day and for like a week after that I would find low level mages running around and tell them to follow me lol
---
There’s this little thing called the Autumnal equinox...happens in September for those of us in the northern hemisphere. 
---
Personally it's more about elitism/expectations. If you have questions no ones gonna give you the time of day, and they have no tolerance for confused people doing a raid for the first time and dying for a dumb reason.
---
Like damn I don't want a tutor or anything, I just want to go through it with everyone else instead of always playing catch up.
---
I feel the same way. I just moved from Philly to Dallas two years ago. Honestly the Taco's here are amazing but I wanna know. How in a city of over 5 million people. There not a single passable pizza or hoagie shop. How the hell can 5 million people not be able to make a proper sandwhich?
---
HoTs are way less mana efficient than flash heals. If you want heals, learn to bandage. 
---
Except that they're trying to deliver the vanilla experience most people have in mind, and patch 1.0 was only available in the US, so the European players have actually 0 memory of anything 1.0, including AV.
---
I could maybe get 1.8 AV, but I can see why they chose 1.12. Being stuck in AV is for 3 days might be fun for the first couple of times, but over time it will lose its appeal and less people will queue for it, resulting in massive queue times or it just not popping at all.
---
You dont understand. If the battleground is designed this way, its not incompetent to not defend. Of course people will rush, if its the way to win. Theres no use trying to turtle and saying others are playing wrong

From 2008.

" We do feel Alterac Valley is fairly well tuned at the moment "
---
First of you we're talking about reckoning so that is what i'm talking about i honestly don't really give a shit about the other stuff.
---
&gt;First, Reckoning was only good when it wasn't working as intended. Back before this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX2JEKVn-U4 You don't even understand the /sit macro meta to force crit and reckbomb someone. That's simply exploiting spaghetti code and is not an argument AGAINST fixing the class.
---
Even without sit abuse and being able to stack in forever it still functions. Even without all that shit you will still get crit and being able to hit four extra times in one swing after getting kited by a hunter or mage for a bit is still amazing. Those two bugs are completely irrelevant too anything. Working as intended reckoning is still good in pvp.
---
If you're able to pick shaman get some gear and go enh and do alright in pvp it's still viable to some degree. Okay it's bottom 50% but if you perform at that 50% as enh it's still viable, easy, you're right in the middle. And if you want to do pvp but are bored of whatever other spec you were using then having more fun by switching to something else is still viable.
---
Some people happen to enjoy solo play in a larger world and might not actually give a shit how they preform in raid gameplay. There is more to the mmos that just pure group performance. Doing things other than top performance in group content is still having a place and you just can't seem to accept that some people don't give a shit about the things you give a shit about, it's a mmo without any real goals but the ones you make.
---
It works, thanks.
---
Some private servers made Mind Control greifing a bannable offends. I learned this after running a NElf off the Booty Bay boat. 
---
while that is true, reinforcements also encourages people to play defense, unlike the 1.12 variant
---
Ya I'll easily be doing 6 hours a day on weekdays and probably 12-14 a day on weekends
---
I genuinely think they will reconsider their decision here. 1.12 Alterac isn't the version of Alterac that anybody is going to subscribe for.
---
 The massive, sprawling Alterac battles where resources matter are one of the aspects of vanilla that people pine for. 
---
I literally stopped reading after first sentence. Don't fucking respond to a thread with a tangent. YOU'RE talking about reckoning. Go back and read. I only mentioned reckoning to show it as the only Paladin damage. I have always been talking about RET BALANCE AND ENH on this thread. Fuck off dude, blocked
---
Yes. Any warrior looking for a free ride gets nothing but a laugh. 
---
Are you serious? You bring no CC, no healing, no portals or useful buffs, your only utility other than DPS is to mitigate damage and you don't offer that service? 
---
Fellow healers unite! 🤘
---
Never liked doing anything else.
---
It didn't matter if you were there for the entire BG (prior to the cancer that was marks of honor. ie: AFKer candy). You could make considerable honor and rep just playing during a portion of the match, completing objectives, doing turnins.
---
Not doubting that, just sharing my experience buying crusader on private servers. I'd be tanking strath live all day for orbs if they were 75g a pop so I find it hard to believe they would stabilize at that price unless the realm was low pop and hard to get groups together for content.
---
My preference - whatever they go with, have the occasional special event where AV becomes another versions' AV. Like one week per month you get 1.12 av instead of 1.8, or vise versa
---
I did most of my AH shenanigans between waking up and going to school.
---
Good deal, glad you have that lifestyle.

[This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9fb2bo/john_staats_ama_author_of_the_world_of_warcraft/e5ymu7a/) by John Staats would seem to be relevant to this whole thread. 
---
&gt;AV wasn’t very popular, While some people enjoyed the mix of PVP and PVE, most did not. Thx!
---
I played from release and John was 100% right on this. When AV came out, the forums were swamped with players saying they hated the battleground. Foremost were the PvP crowd, who were outraged that Blizzard had put too much PvE in their PvP. They wanted to fight other players, not NPCs. 
---
Give us 1.7 but with 1000 reinforcements.
---
He's beyond reasoning. Just let him embarrass himself on the live servers.
---
&gt;this, thank you.  I played vanilla and tbc and i never once remembered joining AV to 'farm' and get it over with.
---
Marks of honor were a huge motivation for the pro-race people, as well as the "hurry up and lose" people.
---
This was my vanilla experience for a while! You will do okay without raiding, the PvP gear is good but not great. Also, you will likely be focus fired first gear is pretty important, even with your spells and skillset. Stick with two or three other players and you'll be less frustrated than I was! 
---
Well, I healed every Dungeon 1-60 Without a problem. I would ask guildies for advice, but I don’t feel I had any innate skill at healing. 
---
But having fun is the primary goal. All other goals are just there to help achieve the primary goal. 
---
If something stops me from completely a secondary goal but at the same time helps me achieve my primary goal it's not a waste of time. 
---
Then don't defend. Go pick up herbs or whatever that rocks your boat. 
---
I would argue the existence of reinforcement alone discourages people from going for a more lenghty game.
---
Whyyyy.
---
I remember that as well lol, of course we tried to win every single time but no one ever thought to rush through the boss, the fun was the fight, not the reward.
---
No one can recreate those moments, if the player want to rush, they will, I really doubt we will ever see these battlegrounds again.
---
They're doing 1.12 because the whole game is 1.12 this is hardly some shocking revalation. 
---
I went through the plague lands the other day after not being there in a decade or so on retail... It's not anything like it was.
---
No! STOP! RIGHT THERE!! I never tipped my password so fast so I don't hear the fucking ~~reeeee~~ screaming from sindragosa  
---
why not just play retail if all you want is a quick transactional experience?
---
With defense cap and proper shield block management, warriors can push crushing blows off the table. Paladins have to be Crit to have their mitigation up, which often times can mean a dead tank anyways. Oh and a warrior has defensive cool downs. Oh and a warrior doesn’t have mana issues. Oh and a warrior has great itemization. 
---
Prior to marks of honor and diminishing returns, it very much was.
---
I agree with this. However, my first 60 took over a year back in vanilla due to terrible connection at the time, so by the time I got to end game, there wasn't much left. I want to experience more of the end game in classic this go around, so I'll be leveling my first char fairly quickly. The leveling process is super fun though. I'll probably slowly level a ret pally at some point.
---
&gt; If you think that classic will have progressive itemisation, please do not flood this place with complaints when release happens because at no point have blizzard promised that.
---
Is there anyone here that would even care? I mean, I don't think anyone is going to be upset that Azure Silk Vest has 7 frost spell damage instead of 5 or whatever. I dont think anything but the 1.10 stuff is big enough to matter. If Im wrong someone let me know though, but as far as I know the important stuff is the stuff being gated.
---
It really depended on what the teams were like and if the horde team actually defended or not. Another big factor was gear levels. The npc's in AV didn't scale with each patch so toward the end of the expansion you could just rush in and pull everything in high end gear.   
---
The best AV's I can remember are back in wrath just after BG experience was introduced. I leveled something like 5 toons 70-80 in AV and it was amazing. Numerous battles where we would summon the bosses and utilize the wing commanders. 
---
I guess was getting a large paycheck bonus for some shit like serving on the foreign territory, but still impressive for this kind of labor.
---
No. Just low lvl npcs
---
But the whole game isn't 1.12. Naxx isn't out, BWL isn't out, BG's aren't even out. So it's not like they are just striahgt releasing 1.12.
---
Besides, if that was the case they could just say so. Saying how the are glad to have 1.12 AV makes it seem like a choice they would've made regardless, which is troublesome.
---
That was pretty badass. Loved the narration &amp; explanation of the music. Really adds to the artistic value of the game that we may or may not see while playing.
---
You can make 300k a year to drive trucks in Syria for the US government fam

---
Week long AV's were fucking EPIC.  This was on Gorgonnash back in the day.  I'd log off to sleep, come back on, same game.  For up to a week.  It felt so god damn epic, and so immersive.  I realize some people hated this, but anything really good is gonna also be really bad for some people.
---
WoW is generally easy to run, so I totes magotes agree. 
---
Would they have to somehow port it? Would it be difficult? That's the extent of my naivety 
---
What time is it?

---
The drops and summons are still in 1.12. 
---
If my ping is any less than 600 I'm headed straight to the forums to complain!
---
The OP was whining about wanting long AV battles, well play some D and you'll get your long AV battles.
---
Piscano one of the really neat parts of classic wow. Is that yes some classes are completely underpowered at some aspects of the game but, they then get the benefit of being overpowered in another part of the game.
---
Take warriors widely accepted and loved as the best pvp melle class in classic. That being said that's in BG's or a group with organized healing. They are utter dog shit in 1v1 pvp or world pvp. Rogues on the other hand suck more and more as groups get larger. However in world pvp and 1v1 pvp. They are OP as hell.
---
In classic wow every class has it's own stage. They all feel different and excel for different reasons. Picking your class is more about asking yourself what you want from the game and less about what is OP.
---
For instance if you want to tank but never intend on raiding. Or only plan on raiding casually. Druids are 100% better then warriors for that but, If you wanna go full hard core neck bearded up MT progression tanking. Their is no replacement for a warrior. It's all relative in classic.
---
They probably made a list of how and when to drop these disappointments on us.  Can't wait for the one about sharding and no wpvp.  
---
&gt;In modern WoW, it's the DPS - how much damage can you bring? 
---
No. In M+ it doesn't matter how much DPS you bring or how good the healer is. If the tank doesn't know his shit you won't get far. 
---
if your guild is speedrunning you want 60+ otherwise just 5/10.
---
also soulshard "farming" is just something people who dont play locks think is a thing. you just casually get soulshards from playing and draining mobs as you play(raid trash, dungeons, moving to dungeons/waiting on people)
---
soul shards in vanilla are about as intensive to manage as rogue poisons
---
I got it my first time there on my druid. No one needed it, and it was DE'd. My guild tank cried.
---
I was the heathen just logging out where ever especially after 60. 
---
Links?
---
The bigger problem is that if they leave to play another game after 2 months, their followers leave too, which could be a substantial blow to a server/faction. A lot of streamers simply choose the game they are playing based on what is new or popular, not necessarily what they feel passionate about playing, so the nature of their presence is often quite transient.
---
You risk your life in Syria tho.
---
I meant for AV my bad
---
He means in quests 
---
Queues deter tourists from settling in your realm.
---
I’m taking a week but release date affects how many days total I’ll have off. 
---
I've carried so many runs as a healer, without even being healer spec. A good tank does make a substantial difference in my ability to maintain the group but even more important is dps NOT taking damage if at all possible. Nothing gets you oom faster than having to keep 3 people up instead of 1. Also, to tanks who run off around the corner and start the next fight without checking healer mana, this is the most stressful thing you can do to the healer (for me anyway) and it is costing them money only getting a few ticks out of each drink.
---
There's nothing better than playing WoW after you've taken care of the rest of the stuff in your life. Putting off things in your life to play wow will only cause anxiety and make you resent the game eventually.
---
I don't know about everyone else, but I don't really play other video games that much, so i'm not in a rush to complete this one, i kinda want it to last the rest of my life.
---
I'm gonna be honest, I don't really understand people taking a vacation to play a video game. I take vacations to travel, spending 3 weeks holiday to sit in front of my computer seems like a waste. But hey, if that's what people want then that's cool.
---
Mod power abuse is something an Undead would do.
---
It'd be in character.
---
Do it.
---
I said Moonkin and Elemental (what was being discussed) have their place as hybrid specs.
---
Do you know how many dungeons I've done where I've been glad to have a hybrid DPS?  A moonkin can decurse easier than a Feral and actually has a mana pool if they need to off-heal.  It's also easier for them to use utility abilities like Roots (if outdoors) or Hibernate.
---
I've never done a dungeon run where the melee DPS says "no, please do not bring an enhancement shaman."
---
You're the one who first brought up Reckbomb, so don't pin that on me.
---
Thanks a lot Garbluck! Really glad you liked it! 
---
you say total radio silence, and yet there was just a (small) update today about AV, and a fairly large update last week about content pacing, which is something people had been fretting over quite a bit.
---
I am, but I'm not going to prepare for it. I'm jumping in with only my memories of vanilla and the last private server I played on back in 2014-2015. I plan on taking my time and keeping my professions up to date. I will run dungeons even after I've done all the quests for them. I will stop the grind and participate in World PvP if help is needed or take a 30 minute break if I'm excessively being camped and I'm unable to get a group started. I have no reason to rush to 60 despite being able to so if I wanted. I expect to hit 60 within 2 months after launch.
---
Hmm, if they removed Korrak in 1.10 how did people complete the quest they got for a good rare weapon at 51? I had done the version where you had to kill Korrak before they changed it.
---
I still try to log out in an inn even at 60.
---
Idk why.
---
Someone was saying blizzard wouldn’t want to give up control of bans and such but I don’t see consoles minding letting them take over that aspect of it, I don’t even mind paying a sub for it
---
Yeah 1.11 turned it into speedrunning madness. But korrak getting yoinked also sped up the process of crossing the middle of the map greatly, and allowed you to quickly ninja snowfall gy.
---
Looking forward to true OG av... at least for a little. 
---
Those patches look rapid, but ppl forget there were plenty of months in between each 
---
I am confident we will, certain actually. We may not get too many. We only have around 10 now (more but I count connected realms as a single). If we get 4 or 5 servers it is going to be hard to know which one of those will fall low pop, and low pop matters a hell of a lot more in classic than it does in retail.
---
I agree with you, however I've seen a few comments around the place that seem to assume we're getting it.

2 much more in-depth breakdowns as to why they do and don't work
---
No real options here. No time left to take, going to be mostly a weekend game. But it's fine because I mostly played WoW for the questing and AV.
---
if you think you can MT in classic without worldbuffs you're in for a rude awakening or just a shit guild
---
Yea when you spend 4 hours in the same BG you really start getting into it. You and all the other people just form this bond, people start talking shit in chat some start talking strategy, it just takes on a whole new meaning.
---
I remember those long BG's, there'd be like little groups doing these mini objectives, coordinating with eachother. Or everyone would start farming materials to get the boss out.
---
Really saddened I won’t get to experience old AV. Was one of my biggest draws to Classic. 
---
Why would you want to roll with a steamer; to get your carpet cleaner?
---
I think the biggest missconception about vanilla is that you play specs like in modern wow. You actually play your class in vanilla not a spec
---
As a tank, can confirm. I really don't care about the numbers "damage dealers" are putting out. I want them to CC, interrupt, peel off the cloth wearers as situations develop, help me kite and mitigate if needed, make the occasional pull, and survive situations I can't take control of. Most of the time I'd rather you do LESS DPS and focus on doing other things that make you useful TO THE GROUP as a class and as a player. And I feel that the role labels "DPS and Damage Dealer" are subconsciously harmful in that sense. Play your class to its fullest, don't shoehorn yourself into a role... 
---
If a DPS warrior pulls his shield, offers to spend his rage on demo shout and thunder clap to help gather aggro and mitigate for the start of a big pull, I'm fucking floored. More often I'm wondering why the rogue is trying to tank and burn down X by himself while the rest of the team is killing skull. 
---
You 100% should raid MC for anathema/benediction then focus on ranking up. That staff is comparable to rank 14 weapons and you can get it while healing then transform it into the shadow spell power staff
---
The argument was that 1.12 was the definitive version of AV.  It's not.  It's the shittiest, stripped down, race-AV version that Vanilla had.  It's not the best.  It's not the most memorable.  It's not the most epic.  It's not the greatest.
---
AV was not a battleground.  AV was a world PVP zone that you queued for.  People would leave their raid when their AV queue popped.  It was that fucking epic.
---
AV is my favorite part of all of the Wold of Warcraft.
---
I can even be on board for demanding no changes out of great if fucking the game up, but when people act like there are no ways to improve the game that wouldn't somehow damage it I find that pretty silly. (Oh and yeah. I was a tank and want good at playing the auction house so I was pretty much always broke. Imagine if I just had that extra 100 gold pretty week.)
---
&gt; It's anecdotal, but there's no biger disaster in a m+ than bringing a bad healer. I've found that good healers can mask bad tanks more than good tanks can mask bad healers.
---
I don't think you were ever pushing really high keys tbh. The best healer immaginable won't change much if the tank doesn't know the deal.
---
A paladin can get the def cap to be crit immune.
---
He can't push crushing blow though.
---
The game IS 1.12. Read the posts. The only thing that has changed is the phased raid introduction. 
---
But there are two other battlegrounds that people can play in for quicker games and potentially better honour/hour. I don't understand why AV is held as the BG that must fit the "best honour/hour" ideal. Let that be AB or WSG and let the people who want something different, have something different.
---
AV was clearly designed to provide a different experience, the feel of a back and forth battle, something a little more involved and epic and time-consuming than AB. I have never understood the push to make this BG conform to a design principle it was never made for. 
---
Why must everything be everything to everyone? Life is full of alternatives. 
---
Righteous fury specifically increases the threat of "holy attacks". I'll admit I'm not 100% certain as I've never tried heal tanking, but don't think it applies to heals.
---
This reminds me of when I used to play Age of Conan. Game had FFA pvp even within guilds unless you are partied. My guild was meeting with an opposing guild to talk alliance for the next guild war. When the opposing guild leader starting whining that he didn't think our guild showed enough respect to our guild leaders and officers in general. I used my place assistant raid leader to start throwing condoms on all my boys. The exact following exchange between my guild lead and theirs was pretty hilarious.
---
Other leader: "Why are condoms popping up on all your members?"
---
My leader: "Shit" [starts hauling ass running] "Umm bro you may want to start running"
---
Other leader: "Why?"
---
My leader: "We are a bit of a... Roudey bunch and I think negotiations just broke down... They don't like your tone"
---
Other leader: " What does that mean?" [beggining to sound nervous]
---
My Leader: "Look man they are willing to give us a head start and you already wasted 30 seconds."
---
Thats about when my first lighting bolt hit home and he demanded to know what I was doing. My only reply was to say. I dunno man why do you put on a condom. Good times.
---
Mannnnnn, might just buy some 2.1 and crank up the bass
---
I know, that's a long time to have to pay attention to one thing. 
---
Oh I was mostly talking about pvp, dps meters are a whole different story.
---
Well, twice in a lifetime so far, technically.
---
Actually, I’m saying your opinion and my opinion are different. So stop whining because they chose a version half of us like, but you’re on the side that doesn’t.
---
Everyone would try it for an hour, realize they're not going to get anything from it, get tired of never getting anywhere and quit. 
---
No matter what AV is going to suck, either from the 1.12 implementation or the fact barely anyone will queue for it.
---
In BFA m+ a lot of the mechanics and affixes require the healer to put out numbers as there is no way to avoid alot of the damage. You are also expected to do decent dps as a healer if you are pushing high keys. In Legion, tanks felt a lot more independent but healers actually have to heal tanks this expansion. I would say for m+ healers generally have the most stressful job. For raids, its hard to say since it really depends on each fight... Every now and then there is a hard tank boss but usually tanks have just as easy a job as anyone else.
---
Can someone redpill me on why making videos is bad? 
---
That's fair. Mentioning a 24 hour difference between the two isn't a defining point on why 1.12 AV should not be in classic, though 
---
Laziness!? They literally took the same version of AV that existed in the version of Vanilla they are releasing, i.e. the purely logical and natural choice. Were you people expecting a specific exception to this rule that holds for literally everything else?
---
There is a special place in hell for you my friend :(
---
Just give it up my guy. It's too late for use to have any say in anyone playing any game now days much less WoW. Ever since cataclysm the game has been made to cater to casuals and simplified as nasuem. It's best to leave it be or find those who know how to play the game. 
---
You're getting the old version of AV that's applicable for the patch. If you don't like it that sucks, time to move on its not for you.
---
I don't get it because warriors are pretty bad at farming gold and tanking for hire is a great way to make gold.
---
Imagine inviting this guy to a group and he starts spewing these philosophical dingleberries 
---
Sounds like you get to play god alot
---
To be fair with the rogue tanking, if they have evasion up they will dodge every hit. It can help sometimes. 
---
The game took a sharp decline at the end of Wrath. LfD was the beginning  of the end.
---
Theyre LITERALLY creating content. Whether you like it or not doesnt change that. 
---
lmao you're getting this mad over a video game that you're grasping at straws to insult the developer??
---
No wonder blizzard didn't want to make vanilla again with people like you existing.
---
It's a shame you refuse to comprehend everything blizzard has said since the announcement and act surprised when the obvious happens.
---
&gt; Nobody is going to let you tank a full raid
---
I’d be surprised if the majority would even let you tank 5 mans. I’m a filthy casual just as much as the next guy but there’s no way I’m inviting a shaman “tank” into my group. 
---
Like the commenter below me said, by the time you get a full group you spent at least an hour looking for a tank. At the first sign of trouble, the group will definitely fall apart. Then you have to hearth back to look for another tank on /2
---
Taking 7 days at least off work. Loading up on weed,adderall, snacks. Wont stop playing till the shadow people come knocking on my door XD
---
&gt; it's about the fun and chance to make a new friend
---
And friendship is magical!
---
The reason they are doing this is because 1.12 is the version they chose for classic WoW because that was the most refined iteration of Vanilla.
---
Trying to mix-and-match multiple versions of different areas of content would be a complete and utter mess.
---
Get over yourself.
---
Ive been playing vanilla pservers since 2011. I dont want retail?
---
Was just freeflowing conversation and didnt feel stretched at all. 
---
The ridicilously oversensitive hatred in this sub sometimes is just beyond stupid. 
---
Dont watch it if you have some wierd time-cap in mind. 
---
Roll on a pserver and practice away....
---
I work in the exact same field of software engineering
---
The average starting salary is $120,000 from what I've seen
---
These losers make $60,000, that isnt a straw. Your salary determines how valueable you are at your job, its quite clear these people are garbage
---
&gt; So stop whining
---
So you are here whining about me whining?  Nice job.
---
Why don't you provide numbers to prove it isn't poor?
---
Was gonna say the same thing. If the tank can’t maintain order, guess what? The healer goes down or dps starts dropping. All hell breaks loose and the group wipes.
---
Was actually wondering about this since I dont have the best memory when it comes to the many AV iterations that was and has been.
---
Will also be super interesting to see when they decide to roll in the BGs soon and if they will feature battlegroups or not. 
---
Hybrid dps are a LAST choice. That’s not called having a place.
---
Mage also decurses and is a dime a dozen. The hybrid DPS is bottom tier across the board. Every spec should fit in group pvp or group pve in an mmo. If not, it’s a dead spec and a failing of the development. Not a design philosophy. 
---
You said they have a place. Having a place means they feel good to play as and have in your party. No party has ever been better off for having a Ret, Bal, or Enh. They have nothing new original that they wouldn’t bring as a healer.
---
You can clear 5 man content with 5 fury warriors swapping aggro and bandaging. That doesn’t make it viable or good design if that was the only way. Bottom tier in pvp, pve and still below halfway in solo, only not utter bottom because self healing classes have a slight edge. Such viable, definitely no cause to look into them further. A+++ thanks for helping me see the light
---
lol peace out loser, you losers find a way to complain about anything
---
&gt; with a lot of PvP, especially if you roll the opposite faction from that streamer
---
With all this talk about ganking streamers I bet they'll all go PvE.
---
I only hope they'll announce where beforehand so I can avoid them completely.
---
Progressive patch cycle the way the game was originally released 
---
Rage issues*
---
But I Get the point. :V
---
Well, heals are listed as "Holy". So who knows... It's been ages since I played vanilla :shrug:
---
They can also block, parry and can get devotion aura from another paladin and then they have everything a warrior has to offer over a paladin.
---
You need to be within ~10 skill of a boss' defense iirc?
---
Never really raided as a melee, or honestly gave much care for min-maxing, but I think the rule is as you want to get with 10, and bosses in vanilla are considered level 63, so a defense of 315.  While I don't think a weapon skill of 305 removes them, it greatly reduces them. 
---
I think there are substantial diminishing returns after 310 weapon skill where there is very little to actually gain.  You would need to get an answer from someone who is more involved with raiding as melee dps.
---
I'm assuming when your weapon skill and the enemy defense match, there are none? So at best you'd need is 315.  Even then, I don't know of many orcs going for things like edgmaster's and getting any noticeable gain at 312 axe skill -- rather they just stick with 305 and go ham stacking crit/hit.
---
Ladies first :V.
---
Sounds like you don't like AV at all so why root for a shitty version of something you won't play either way. 
---
Yeah I'm open to the possibility, wouldn't be the only misleading tooltip in Vanilla.
---
Clear every raid during progression without Warrior tanks and then I'll agree Druids are tier 1 tanks.
---
Dreams crushed.
---
Where is the av news?
---
The only thing I’d like to know is how you managed to turn a 1-paragraph update post into a 28 min video 
---
Different people have different memories because they were going for different goals. Many of us wanted long AVs because that is the experience we were after. It was very clear to see the tourists who were after quick honour. I don't know why they didn't just do an AB or WSG. 
---
AV was not designed for quick honour and the people who expected it to be seem kind of strange to me. It was clear is wasn't designed that way so why that expectation was there is really odd.
---
I personally didn't know too many people that wanted quick games in AV, but that is because my crew and I didn't want quick games and gravitated (on both factions) towards people of the same ilk. This is pretty natural behaviour.
---
Your experience of AV is different because you ran with a crowd who wanted fast games to maximise honor, I ran with a crowd who didn't. The issue is, those of us who aren't focused on the fast games and just want to play the epic battleground as it was intended can't do this, and which is why we find the news a little dissapointing.
---
I haven't been in an AV for 5 years. I'll give it a go. If it works out ok, then I'll continue to do them until the zerg rush mentality is enabled and then I'll forget about AV again. Lamentable yes, but I'm not going to boycott classic or any other extremist nonsense. I'll just be a little sad at what could have been: an opportunity to please more people than less that was not taken.
---
I think the focus should be more on the DPS. Tanks and healers have very specific jobs and of course if they do them incorrectly you wipe.  
---
From the eyes of the DPS, there are so many things you can do to speed up fights and progress through the dungeon faster, such as Interrupting/Stunning and prioritizing your targets. You won't wipe (most of the time) if you don't do this, but if you do then you'll drastically improve clear speed.  
---
I see so many DPS in retail wow not actively using their CDs/Stuns because they're solely focused on their DPS rotation rather than optimizing their play for whatever they're doing. An example of this would be if the boss is 3-3.5 minutes away, you can use a 2 minute CD on a pack of mobs and you'll still have your CD up for the boss but many DPS avoid that for some reason.  
---
This also isn't to say Healers/Tanks aren't important, but in terms of clear speed/efficiency, I think DPS need to learn the most. 
---
The best mod power abuse is the kind you don't realize is abusive.
---
Pro-tip: I stickied my comment to the top of this post.
---
Just wanted to address something in your post, OP, that many others seem to gloss over. You said you want to be main tank, and for that role a paladin is most certainly not an option. All main tanks will be warriors. With the right gear and spec you will be able to tank some bosses as a paladin, but sub optimally in comparison to warriors and druids. 
---
I can’t really speak for naxx but as far as I know, warriors still reign supreme as main tanks. 
---
That said, if you’re happy to tank some stuff and heal others, I am sure you’ll be able to find a guild that’ll take you! Bear this in mind: you’ll have to put more effort into farming and also convincing people that you can effectively tank. 
---
For me, I play the class that appeals to me, not the role that it can fulfil/be viable. Obviously others take a lot more consideration into their choice!
---
cause they were brought in right at the end of vanilla
---
"Geared group" is putting it mildly
---
And not be able to use any AddOns.
---
Hybrid DPS are not my last choice.  They have a place in my groups, and a place in many groups from discussions I've had.
---
The only place they don't have is in YOUR groups, which from what I can tell is probably a good reason to play a hybrid DPS.
---
But that's just timegating. When each phase comes out the content released is always in its 1.12 state. There is no example of mix-and-matching different versions of content and it's baffling how everyone was apparently expecting them to make an exception for this one thing.
---
To learn the most, yes.  But the most important person is the healer.
---
Actually, the game is going to be 1.13. and they've said they'll use 1.12. as a base to build upon.     
---
Given that 1.12. is just a base for them to modify, they could - due to player demand - easily justify a change such as rolling AV back a bit more. Not a *change* to add new stuff to the game, but to use a different version that was at one point in vanilla.
---
Right? ”Oh god how I hate that these people try to make money while providing us content for free”
---
Doesn't mean that wouldn't happen even on a buffed AV - rather if AV was harder i'd argue its more likely to happen.
---
Really wont effect me either way. My job I can take off essentially whenever I please (as long as I give a decent notice) 
---
I may be buying my first home around that time, so it could be a small hiccup, but one way or the other I'm playing
---
Aaand congratulations on demonstrating why it would be a bad idea to try to mix-and-match different versions of Vanilla content: everyone wants a different version while also championing "no changes".
---
Taunt, and multiple ways of reducing incoming damage like demo shout, thunder clap, and they have a kick in shield bash.  Effective CDs like shield wall, and last stand.  Warriors also have passive 10% redux from defensive stance, higher base HP, and set gear that is very well itemized for tanking.  Their talent tree actually makes sense compared to paladins.  For example, paladin can't get both 5/5 parry and consecration.  In addition the prot tree has too many 5 pt talents, so you are practically forced to skip some defensive talents or threat talents.  
---
Almost all of the warrior threat output scale with strength and agility whereas righteous fury only buffs your holy damage.  The problem is all of the +def gear has str on it.  There is no practical way to get enough spell power to have good single target threat while at the same time getting enough +def to boss tank.  
---
Probably most important thing, warriors have rage and their threat output goes up the more damage they take.  Paladins being mana based can OOM on longer progression fights.  If you are past progression and speed running raids waiting for your MT to drink between pulls is full on cancer.  
---
In terms of offtanking, a feral, fury, or arms warrior can pretty effectively tank an add or trash long enough to kill it, and then very easily swap weapons/forms and do effective dps.  Prot paladin cannot do effective damage single target.   
---
Literally the only things paladins have over warrior tanks is lay on hands(but would be better off being the healer then), slightly better aoe threat, and they are more shiny.  
---
Also, the idea of healing for aggro is dumb, and only works in situations where you are taking nearly 0 damage to begin with.  You will not have much +healing on your gear as a tank, so you wouldn't heal for much to begin with, plus you lose the ability to dodge, block, and parry while channeling a spell.  Other then your seal, all of your healing has a cast time, and if you are using seal of light, then you are giving up even more damage by not using righteousness.  
---
Because that makes it unwatchable?
---
Happy to answer, figured this may be coming.  I thought the exact same thing as you when I first saw the post - it can be summarised in one sentence, "we're getting 1.12 AV in Classic". And I thought little of it.
---
Then I started reading comments and saw that some people were pissed.  This is a bit of a bigger deal to some members of the PvP community than I realised.  So figured it warranted some discussion.
---
Plus, there's 4 people in on the call, so everyone should get a bit of a say, so that extends the time.
---
But, obviously, it's not for everyone at that length, which is fine and I'll happily take any heat that comes of it.  Thanks for checking in on it anyway though, appreciate it.
---
But he said ‘etc’!!!!
---
Apparently not being able to solo cap towers was "too hard".
---

And the patch they are using is the final Vanilla patch. Carry the two...
---
Yes. That is the length of the video. Good observation
---
Hurp durp change the whole experience and game to my liking ... 
---
You are the reason mmorpgs suck.
---
How do the ones with no jaw use canabalise? They must just scrape the meat off with their top teeth and use their head like a shovel to get it down their throats? 
---
I literary cannot imagine how your enjoyment of this game could be affected in any other way. There is no meaningful interaction you can possibly have with these people outside of dungeons and raids, and without any meaningful interaction I don't see how any mature individual could ever be so affected by another person's opinion. It's just common sense to me. 
---
Like, if I tell you "ur spec sux lol" the only conceivable way that it could hurt your enjoyment of this game (which seems to be the major recurring theme of every complaint/circlejerk against "min-maxers") is if you are not being invited to dungeons/raids because of their opinions. Otherwise it would just be sticks and stones, right?
---
Nope. The original WoW launch was once in a lifetime. It's gone. This isn't the same, but it'll have to do.
---
Now that's the kind of efficiency I like to see.
---
1.7 was the high water mark. 1.8 was when things began to be removed/nerfed.

---
***\_\*\*AV v1.6.0\*\*\_***
---
***\* Each team will now gain additional bonus honor if their towers are not destroyed by the end of the map. The more towers that remained intact, the more honor received.***

---
***\_\*\*AV 1.7.0 (general BG changes)\*\*\_***
---
***\* Battleground “holidays” have been added to Warsong Gulch, Alterac Valley and Arathi Basin. Holidays occur during most weekends, starting on Thursday night at midnight and continuing until Tuesday morning. During a holiday, emissaries from that Battleground will be found in the major cities, and honor/faction rewards for performing objectives in that battleground are increased.***
---
***\* Alterac Valley now correctly rewards honor for owning graveyards at the end of the game.***
---
***\* Fixed a bug that would cause players to stand up when a turnin was made in Alterac Valley.***
---
***\* Players will no longer be able to gain health by repeatedly entering and leaving the effect of a Battle Standard.***
---
***\* Entering a battleground now resets the timer for the AFK flag. This should prevent players being kicked by the AFK timer moments after they enter the Battleground instance.***
---
***\_\*\*BGs in general v 1.8.0:\*\*\_***
---
***\* Each Battleground has an individual turn-in quest associated with its related victory/loss condition. Upon completion of a Battleground, the winning side will be awarded three Marks of Honor while the losing side will be awarded one Mark of Honor. Three Marks of Honor may be turned in to the associated questgiver for Honor points and faction increase. Should players complete this turn-in quest, they will find that the bonus Honor Points for completion are twice that of normal turn-in conditions (individual).***
---
***\_\*\*AV v1.8.0:\*\*\_***
---
***\* In order to keep teams in Alterac Valley more numerically balanced, players will now enter Alterac Valley on a one-for-one basis (i.e. if there are 30 players in the battleground for each side with 10 players in the Alliance queue and 2 players in the Horde queue, only two players from each team will be added, bringing the total to 32 per side).***
---
***\* The minimum number of players required to start a battle in Alterac Valley has been lowered to 20 (the maximum is still 40).***
---
***\* Points for completing the map and winning have been slightly decreased.***
---
***\* Graveyards and graveyard capture points are now at different locations. The banners players must interact with in order to capture a graveyard have been distanced from each other somewhat in order to alleviate “graveyard zerging” and make graveyards more meaningful to both defense and offense.***
---
***\* Several terrain changes were made to fix some geometry exploits as well as to adjust for the new graveyard mechanic.***
---
***\* Iceblood Graveyard has been fortified.***
---
***\* The Frostwolf Relief Hut now has appropriate guards.***
---
***\* A great avalanche has closed off both the eastern and western segments of Alterac Valley. This has displaced the Syndicate, the Wildpaw Gnolls, and many of the Winterax Trolls.***
---
***\* Due to the avalanche, Korrak the Bloodrager and a small band of surviving Trolls have made the Snowfall Graveyard their new home. Players will find that Snowfall is now under Korrak’s control and they must defeat Korrak and his Troll guards if they wish to take Snowfall.***
---
***\* The quests Korrak the Bloodrager (Alliance), Korrak the Everliving (Alliance), The Legend of Korrak (Horde), and The Return of Korrak (Horde) have been removed from the game. The rewards for the initial quest involving Korrak have been moved and can be acquired by completing the quest associated with winning a match in Alterac Valley. We realize that some players may have had the Korrak quest and never completed it. These players may have already completed the quest for killing the General and thus might not be able to benefit from the rewards from the previous quest line. We have opted to add an extra quest step at the end of the General kill quests to reward players that fall under such conditions.***
---
***\* A new item has been added as one of the reward choices for the quests Hero of the Stormpike and Hero of the Frostwolf.***
---
***\* NPC difficulty has been scaled down. All NPCs have had their power reduced by 15-30%.***
---
***\* There is now a portcullis at the end of each of the entrance tunnels inside Alterac Valley. They will rise two minutes into the battle.***

---
***No specific changes listed***
---
***\_\*\*AV v1.9.3\*\*\_***
---
***\* The default graveyards in Alterac Valley for each side were moved further up the tunnels away from the battleground exit. This should prevent accidentally leaving the battleground.***
---
***\_\*\*AV v1.10.0\*\*\_***
---
***\* Flavor items from player loot in Alterac Valley will now stack and can be sold for a small value. These are items like Documents from Boomstick Imports, Worn Running Shoes, etc.***
---
***\* Players in Alterac Valley will no longer drop Darkspear Troll Mojo, Dwarf Spines, Forsaken Hearts, Human Bone Chips, Orc Teeth, etc. and the quests have been removed for these items. Instead when a player is slain in Alterac Valley, any enemies that were in that player’s threat list will gain 1 point of reputation with either the Frostwolf or Stormpike factions.***
---
***\* Frostwolf and Stormpike faction will now be gained by killing players of the opposite faction. Reputation will no longer be split up among the entire raid group.***
---
***\* Tower Banners in Alterac Valley can no longer be used through walls.***
---
***\* Korrak the Bloodrager and his band of trolls have packed up their bags and left Alterac Valley for greener pastures.***

---
***\_\*\*AV v1.12.0\*\*\_***

***\* When you join a battleground, you are automatically added to a raid group. You MAY NOT leave that group. To speak in this raid, use /bg instead of /ra.***
---
***\* Leadership of the battleground raid is granted to whomever has the highest PvP rank when the raid is formed (approximately 1 minute before the battleground starts).***
---
I'm mixed. Those are one of those things that are fun a couple times. They want people to keep playing and the 1.12 version is definitely more replayable, even if it is a bit worse. Still expect them to potentially last hours in this state though, which is plenty long imo. 
---
First page is full of backlash over that statement.

A geared  warrior with consumes/trinkets/engineering is certainly not shit 1v1.  Warrior has amazing pvp spec, amazing pve damage, best tank in game. Retarted imo
---
I hope they  don't  do it at all. Sharing would seriously turn me off from the game
---
1 step backwards for being consistent and firm on using the 1.12 patch this entire time and not buckling to each person's  individual idealised Vanilla experience... You people are a joke.
---
&gt;  how little gold matters in vanilla wow. 
---
said no one ever
---
Honestly. Even in the current game, the tank is more important. 
---
As a tank, if a healer isn’t keeping up on big pulls, you just pull less, and request more CC.
---
As a healer, if a tank over pulls, or doesn’t request CC, there’s literally nothing I can do to stop them.
---
Tank has control over that. Healer doesn’t. So a bad tank with a good healer will wipe you, whereas a bad healer with a good tank won’t. 
---
Yes! I don't want to start getting invested in another game because I know I'll just abandon it when classic comes.
---
Lol the entire reason they made BoK easier to get was because in any decent raid comp you had a single pally going 31 point ret to get it even though they still healed.
---
One reason why SPriests are so effective in pvp is because a large chunk of their initial scaling comes from talents. Similar to Ferals too.
---
You start out strong with bad gear. Likely this will carry a SPriest far until further tiers become available for all classes.
---
:'( but the stupid amount of OP npcs is what we all wanted.
---
This response is far too reasonable for my liking. Please include more insults and maybe some aLtErNaTiNg CapS to spice it up plz.

Huh, didn’t actually expect a reply. Regardless,  It’s too long for me personally, but thanks for replying and filling in the details

---
Yep, people just want quick games for honor and rep. This will be the case on classic too regardless of what version of AV there is.

Not a worry, I should thank you for making me realise I should have put a bit of a warning in about the time, given that people wouldn't know until they click the link.  I thrown that in by way of an edit now, cheers!
---
I was thinking about starting a rogue alt guild, welcome to anyone willing to roll a rogue alt, to roll on a streamer server just to gank and run.  
---
I wasn't sure how popular it would be though so I haven't moved forward with it.  
---
Tbh all you'd really need is a core group of 5 rogues. If it grew to something more than that, all the better.  
---
Do you want hype? because this is how you get hype.
---
There is small silver lining. AV rushes only really appeared in tbc patch (and onwards), because they changed how honor worked. Suddenly it was very efficient to do AV rushes over and over ... 
---
In vanilla, you probably want to do wsg for your rank farm (if you have group) and you want to play long AV where you get 40+ HK if you are solo players. 
---
So I expect a lot of defenders on both sides. 
---
You’re right, but the implication from Blizzcon was that all data prior to 1.12 was overwritten in an effort to keep a quick release pace.
---
It would seem the only way they could get progressive stats is to do it manually...and I don’t see that happening.
---
If he means BfA, no. 5 good tanks can generate better aoe dps than a tank with 3 bad dps and a healer. It’s a fun comp to mess around with. 
---
If he means Vanilla, yes. It’s terrible. No self heals. Bad dps. Literally no reason to do it. 
---
Greetings from South Hills..!
---
I would give it a shot. If someone came up to me and asked to tank a dungeon as a Shaman, I would be eager to see the results. I would expect someone willing to try Shaman tanking to have some reasonable gear and a good grasp on how their class plays.
---
Role playing, I presume. Everyone is the hero of their story.
---
Yep. I have a lot of experience playing both and you are completely right. The tank sets the pace/tone for the dungeon/raid
---
c0m3 4t m3 Br0!!!
---
Against almost any other class using the same trinkets and extras. Yea they actually are dog shit 1v1. You are basically just being the standard I watched a youtube video kid. Having your warrior with 10X the gear and using consumables no one else is in your pvp videos is a great way to make you look better then you are. Warriors suck as at 1v1. If you go against a player of equal skill/gear. You will be eviscerated 1v1.
---
Right but it's a clear milk. This isn't "freeflowing conversation" when it's aimed to just talk till you hit 10 minute mark... Its, we have 10 minutes to kill, let's tag the update and just shoot shit. Not quality content, sorry.
---
The original horde that invaded the Alliance territories were blood thirsty Orcs.
---
Troll Priest
---
So i can troll people with mindcontrol
---
100% agree with OP. Most of the time you can see the healer and tank struggling with their roles because DPSers are just wildly attacking mobs that the tank has no threat on yet and they never peel for their healer if he ever gets early healing aggro. It's been how many years you know and people still mess up the basics.
---
One side always considers the other side as bad when at war.
---
what the god damn fuc 
---
I want 1.8. That was way better than the later versions.
---
Don't watch the in-depth guides. Don't spoil the experience for yourself. Go in completely raw. You will never regret it
---
I really disagree. I regularly heal content I’m unfamiliar with, before tanking it, as tanking is more work, and requires more knowledge. 
---
As a healer I can move out of fire, and play health bar whack a mole, and keep a party up. With no knowledge of the instance. 
---
You just can’t do that on a tank. 
---
i am already there
---
Yes they are using that patch for ease of talents and bugs, by your logic they should just have naxx released from the start cause its 1.12
---
I don't think anyone was, but they are literally saying in that post that they are glad to have AV in 1.12.
---
As i said, if they went "we are doing 1.12 AV since that's what we have the data for sadly" then cool. It's just strange the way they worded it like they're doing us a favor.
---
How often do you go up against equal skill and geared opponents ? The game revolves around not being balanced and your sterilized example of balance rarely rings true in classic pvp.
---
But you are correct if all things equal I do agree warriors "should" usually loose. 
---
Too long and personal, *let me just continually comment on this subject that does not interest me*
---
How the fuck is it half-assed? They picked the latest, most complete patch of Vanilla which is the most natural  and logical choice. It's pretty wild to try to pin this decision on laziness or Activision.
---
"I want Vanilla WoW with NO CHANGES! Oh, but the latest patch doesn't really count; go with x version. But only for content pieces a, b, and c. For d, e, f , g, go with vedsion y. And also throw in version z for this part. But NO CHANGES! AUTHENTIC VANILLA EXPERIENCE!"
---
I believe you just have to win 1 game of AV after that
---
That's really intriguing. Some items were buffed and others were nerfed, but I think more of the former.
---
I'd rather have to be careful when doing world PvP than have 10x as much downtime whole levelling because some dick(probably a rogue) can't help repeatedly kill quest givers
---
But why does the tank do all that?
---
So the healer can have an easy time.
---
But is everyone addicted? I know between work and commitments I'll be lucky to get 2-3 hrs in a day. The question is what amount of time the average wow player will play daily.
---
Hi I'll be the level 60 in all purples killing scrubs like you while you're leveling :)
---
One is the generic Tolkien / DnD races, who are always the "good guys" in fantasy and the other are zombies, minotaurs, and orcs -- whom are usually portrayed as the bad guys.
---
Red - Bad!
---
Blue - Good!
---
In reality, the Alliance in lore are pretty fucking wicked.  Dwarves are ok.
---
You wont be getting true OG av ever, they're not doing progressive AV, its just 1.12 off the bat.
---
Was a joke :)
---
It's not even *long* AVs that people want. They just want 40v40 smash fests. I do too, who doesn't. But putting old AV won't get you that in the day and age where everyone is trying to maximize rep or honor per hour. Everyone will do it the first week for fun, after that it'll be back to base race because that's the most efficient. It's not fun on the old map. It would basically kill AV.
---
&gt; I will have zero problems keeping my lolcasual raid ahead of the jackasses who think they are awesome.
---
Coolstorybro.
---
Yup. Plus, look what the forsaken did at the wrath gate.
---
I'd like if their other specs leaked more into their dps specs. I could see Retribution partially being an offensive healer.
---
1.10+ AV, the version they’re going with, lasted the longest during Vanilla. 
---
no
---
Are you seriously linking me the blizzcon video xD 
---
I've already told you I've seen it, live in fact.
---
If you had paid attention to what they say in the database data , he explicitly says " so when going back and looking at our database data , we cracked it open and said how far back do you still have data? fortunately we still had 1.12 and slightly before, so this gave us sort of a medium level of confidence in restoring original data".
---
\- This means that they only had data for 1.12 but nothing prior to that, given that they are going to do patch progressions they DO need a lot more data than what 1.12 and slightly prior offers.
---
He legit said afterwards they desperately needed to find some of the original data and had to look off-site but weren't sure what they were going to find, this is them referring to the pserver group i was mentioning earlier, then he said "so now that we have 1.12 versions of these three... and we were ready to reconstruct 1.12 with these PIECES ... we shoved them in a blend and to our amazing delight we had A VERSION of 1.12 that we could run internally.
---
\- This means that they mixed all the data they had gathered and were able to make a functioning version, notice he says A version not THE complete version of 1.12 or the optimal version or just 1.12 , he specifically says A VERSION of 1.12 for a reason, it's incomplete data.
---
He also said " a lot of what we don't like about this version is in the SOURCE CODE"  as well as how they took out some of the things they didn't like and put in some more modernized stuff.
---
\- this is basically where they decided to fill in the small gaps they had left with modern stuff.
---
Now what this all means is that it's not a true recreation of vanilla, it's vanilla + , to say things like pservers don't have accurate data but classic doesn't would be incorrect, neither has the complete version, classic has more correct data than pservers , that I can agree on, but then again they added some modernization to their version which also veered it away from the perfect recreation of vanilla.
---
Which is why I'm asking the question, which is closer to the authentic version of vanilla in this case? you cannot say classic because they have added modernized things that weren't in the old vanilla, whether that is good or bad isn't the case.
---
You kept trying to drag the argument back into a different corner because you thought you had that info covered ,even though your assumption was wrong, not to mention it wasn't what I was asking at all, yet you kept trying to find something to defend classic instead of looking at the matter objectively , your obvious bias has blinded you to the truth in front of you but you still you refuse to acknowledge.
---
Even IF blizzard had somehow found the full data and recovered all of vanilla, their decision to modernize classic would have also moved it away from the original version, so even had you won that argument you still would not have changed my mind regarding the main question.
---
Racing each other to kill the bosses was a super boring meta. The previous AV was very fun, sure it was not good for people grinding highwarlord but the majority of people play this game for the experience and want to just have fun waging war on the opposite faction. There was plenty to do and to discover.
---
If you plat Feral and end up healing 5mans instead of tanking, you are doing it wrong.
---
Yoooooooope.
---
Dwarves are my personal favorite.  Descendants of the titans themselves.
---
True
---
I really don't thing you understand what clickbait means...
---
Lol hey everyone look at the loser with his limited vacation time. 
---
I’d rather the horde be the bad guys. More fun and fits undead better.
---
Marry her
---
Defense wins AV though
---
I mean youre saying its structured around hitting a timegoal with 0 proof or signs of it. 
---
To me theyre literally talking the whole fucking time about the topic at hand and its not repeating the same stuff nonstop to make the time go either.
---
Its not a "clear milk". Its you being ridicilously gatekeeping, thinking 10m discussion on some news is too much &amp; greedy. It doesnt get more millenial than that. 
---
Thanks! I've mostly just been watching class &amp; race guides so I don't get way in over my head. I will avoid the other stuff. At the moment, I'm thinking I'm going to roll a Night Elf Druid due to the versatility and survivability. I was thinking Dwarf Hunter, but to be honest, I see myself getting bored with that class long-term. 
---
Work in a tourist restaurant in the Summer. The 7 day work weejs are going to fuck me. A sept release would be perfect because we slow down between sept and march.
---
You had me at "refuses to get engineering for PvP"
---
Fuck engineering
---
To put it shortly: 
---
Spriest is a spec which is strong in 1v1. But it is a meme spec. People don't want meme specs in their raids or premade PvP. 
---
But you need gear from PvP or raids. That means you have to work extra hard to prove yourself. If you don't want to go hard on spriest you might want to reconsider your class/spec choice.
---
Oh boy, an hour long. Look forward to watching this while playing some Auto Chess when I'm home later haha.
---
Where I take offense is the time I saw an alliance player say "Only teenage edgelords want to play the bad guys!"
---
Its was over dramatic to compare it to retail AV...
---
Dude you're going to love it. My advice is this: pick the most flavorful, interesting race and class combination. Give 0 heed to how "optimized" it is, because it has 0 bearing on your enjoyment. 
---
Next, don't look super into guides.
---
Things you should look into: 
---
Professions and what they make, to see which you want. It can be really helpful to take these on early and keep them leveled with you in your "downtime" so leveling doesn't feel so monotonous, but also so you aren't stuck at 60 as a priest with blacksmithing and skinning! 
---
Warlocks are tier 98, they have to tank in at least 1 raid boss.
---
Therefore, by this logic Warlock &gt; Paladin as tanks.
---
This is more than likely a deal breaker for me unfortunately.  
---
No. So the party doesn’t wipe. Healer is just part of the team. 
---
As is a dps can off heal, often, if a healer does drop.
---
To be honest, like most situations in life, the focus is on the most competent person involved. Which needs to be your tank, if you want to have a smooth run. 
---
Yikes. Remind me how free flowing conversations just naturally end at 10 minutes throughout the universe? Got it. . .
---
They could put BG's in phase 1 without putting the gear in phase 1. 
---
Happy microphone day!
---
I’m a good guy in real life. When I play games I always pick the bad guys if I can.
---
You're absolutely right. In game I'm not going to have problems, but on this sub reddit the problems exist. People ask simple questions &amp; get berated. In game it won't matter because casuals won't mingle with hardcore.
---
So much this.
---
Thank you, this helps. As silly of a question as this is, what would be a pvp class that does not require the best of the best raid gear for wpvp?
---
I dont know.  Bots will always be a problem.  If Blizzard hasnt fixed this (or comes out with some statement saying they are taking the problem seriously etc), then Im out.  
---
Thank you! 
---
Yeah but among all the phases without taking PvP into account, it doesn't make sense to put phase 2 four months after phase 1.
---
From your childish posts it sounds like you don't work at all.
---
Very helpful! 
---
I think you never played shaman. I raise you the Call of Water quest line. :D
---
Wait what? Haha.. are you telling me if a conversation ends around 10m its by default not natural or free flowing? 
---
You must be the most socially awkward person in the world. 
---
Big battles sound cool till you realize they are a waste of time when it comes to efficiently slogging through pvp. 
---
Get your jaws on. Keep those filthy tongues inside.
---
Damn, I was hoping this wasnt the Case. But I guess it is vanilla 
---
Hello I acknowledge that this video is over 10 minutes long haha I hate Esfand and scuffed Asmongold :)
---
It means a title that requires you to click to learn more. 
---
The title of this post is a clickbait because it forces you to give a click before you can actually understand what the post will be about.
---
A better title would have been something like, "If I ever had to wait on a hearthstone cooldown, I used to go complete a chore to pass the time. What meta things did you use to do?"
---
“Which patch is vanilla using?”
---
“1.12”
---
“Oh, which AV are they going to use?”
---
“This is bullshit! #nochanges” 
---
Wat?
---
&gt; does it really matter that much if you don’t cut your lawn for a week?
---
It sounded more like he was hiring them ongoing, not just for the 1 week, so he could nolife every weekend.
---
Don’t think they’re gonna do that.
---
Did they take out the 'bone' drops just to let it be released that way in China?
---
It depends on how you define 'most important', because if any of the 3 roles just disappeared from the fight, you'd wipe. 
---
I've never forgiven them for Lothar's murder.
---
Oh I know. I constantly stun tanks as they pull marshalls and have  them wipe. 
---
Yeah, beating warriors on threat is irrelevant, because it is either or. Thanks for proving my point tho
---
one doesnt need 10 alt accounts and 1000g a day to use consumables. Jesus how autistic can you be? 
---
Just like you are on a spectrum, so too is money making. I managed to spam consumables nonstop pushing for r14 and had no issue with just 2 accounts with optimal professions.
---
That costs money.  And time.  They just laid off a ton of workers to save money.  Do you think they care to spend an additional 2 months and lose all that subscriber money?
---
Nah, pretty lax. But I'm also not a dunce who thinks a YouTube content creator self promoting a video on a Reddit sub who's video just happens to hit 10 minutes is due to "natural free flowing conversation." 
---
Honestly, the only people that will feel the difference with phases instead of without phases are pservers players. Most pserver players are gonna be really fast anyway. So in my opinion I think Blizzard don't need to make the phase last too long. I would understand to have quite sometime for between BWL and AQ, and between AQ and naxx, but for the rest most players won't notice (and most players won't be ex pserver players)
---
I mained enhancement late vanilla through cataclysm. Tanking sounds like a fun experiment, but it's FAR from viable. These 'guides' are misleading at best, especially to new players. Shaman tanking is a meme taken too far.
---
Bravo. *clapping intensifies*
---
This is what the OP demands.
---
Does this mean that horde will never win AV in Classic?  Because I remember a point where horde just couldn't win because alliance had an easier time getting into the horde base than vice versa.
---
Instead of gamking level 40’s on my Druid, I’d use rank 1 Entangling Roots until DR kicked in. 
---
Then I’d spam rank 1 moonfire. 
---
In TBC I’d throw in Cyclone too just to make it extra annoying. 
---
Then I’d run stealth nearby, leave them alone for a few minutes before killing them. 
---
You literally can’t play fire in MC/BWL. Majority of the mobs are immune to fire damage or have very high fire resist. 
---
This literally was the latest version of Vanilla AV. Holy shit you people...
---
Even if your points were flawless Blizzard has already stated a few times. The 1.12 data is sacrosanct, meaning it’s they feel it’s not theirs to change and won’t. Progressive itemisation won’t happen, they’ve said that. However, item Gating will. The pvp items are the exception hence why they’re missing from the new 6 phase content timeline. 
---
Just no, because I dont like it. There. No no. Noooo. Boooo. Reeeee
---
Not really.  I've done plenty of fights with just tank + healer that went swimmingly smooth (even if they took forever).
---
Most groups if a DPS drops will opt to 4-man the run instead of replacing the member.
---
Another ”just no reee” response
---
I’m separating knowledge from skill. Tanks, by far, need to be the most prepared and most geared, but a less skilled tank can get the job done with a good healer from my experience. 
---
To be clear, I play a Mage, so I have no dog in the hunt.
---
I found tanking dungeons as a paladin frantic and annoying to stop and drink every pull. Especially the number of dps warriors you will get in pugs ripping aggro.
---
So yes it is viable but realize it's an uphill battle compared to warrior or druid.
---
Fire in MC/BWL is pointless due to resistances. Its not 10% difference it's a football field size margin. 
---
I mean it's called MOLTEN core, using fire spells in a place called that is just a daft idea
---
Well I guess that answers it lol. How about Arcane? Or at that point is it just not worth it
---
The upside is you never run oom, because there's no point casting fire spells because the majority of mobs in MC/BWL are immune or have very high fire resistance. Hope you have a good wand.
---
To this day I'm still trying to figure out the plot of Zinwrath
---
NP when I record you casting 5 frostbolts at once and you get banned for it it'l be super entertaining.
---
You cannot push glancing blows off the attack table, but with weapon skill you can increase the damage of those attacks. For level 60 player auto attacking level 63 boss, 40% of attacks will be glancing blows, this cannot be changed. With 300 weapon skill glancing blows will deal 35% less damage than a normal white attacks. With 305 you will deal 15% reduced damage and with 310 weapon skill 5% reduced damage, and no glancing blow damage reduction with 315 skill.
---
At the point where you're just a tank and healer why even bother if it's taking forever? Trying to get through a dungeon with only 2 people doesn't seem worth it at all.
---
Well my core point had more to do with class balance in vanilla wow more then pvp rating specifically. The only thing I was saying is that every class has something they are OP for. So picking a class is more about asking yourself what you like doing. More then it is about picking a class that is specifically OP. 
---
As far as overall OP'ness. I consider Mages to be classic wows overall most powerful class. With Warriors in a close second.
---
It shouldn't be too bad, you don't even need to down rag but at that point, may as well
---
Systems and content are different things. They are timegating _content_, but using 1.12 _systems_ right off the bat.
---
How is that a "waste of time"? By that logic, walking to any instance or any having group finds are "efficient". If you want some efficiency for pvp, go WSG and AB premade. The most efficient thing to do is premade anyway, let people have their AV battles, some people just want to feel like they are in a big battle. 
---
I think you have to compare the skill floor/ceiling for healers and tanks to really make a fair comparison. 
---
I feel like healers have a lower skill floor compared to tanks but a higher ceiling. 
---
The barrier to entry for a healer is just being able to click on people with low health and cast heals, with a priority on the tank.
---
But the barrier for a tank is much higher. You have to set the pace, initiate pulls, keeps aggro, pop defensives, and position correctly. 
---
Basically, it's easier to be a "good" healer than a "good" tank, but it's a lot harder to be a "great" healer vs. a "great" tank.
---
taunting rats goes a long way.
---
It's still sad not being able to do some lvl 60 quests such as paladin/warlock or that mage quest for longer than 2-3 months after release. If we are slow, we won't notice anything anyway. We will have catchup gear while doing MC, and we will probably have a bit of ZG gear for BWL / AQ.
---
All that phasing things is a bit overrated for non-pservers players.
---
At that point there’s no reason to play fire, I’m not playing it to a wand only mage lmao
---
So wait, glancing blows are the first thing on the hit table? I main a warrior and I'm used to crushing blows being last.
---
It was just one of the first tone deaf "we know better than the players do what is fun" detachments.
---
I guess you could spec fire and just throw frost bolts. However your overall damage compared to a Mage who specs frost will be considerably lower. 
---
No Baron Von Underbite is a character from the venture brothers. Hes a giant musclebound eastern European man with an iron jaw. He lost his original jaw and had to have it replaced.
---
The only reason this is acceptable is because some warrior tanks need the iron jaw. Loose tongues are just not good for tanks. Which is why I pointed out this model is acceptable with special dispensation from the crown for main tanks.
---
Mages farm gold well. Mages respec every week. It's simply the mage life. Play whatever the heck you want to outside  raid night. There are lots of viable specs. Elemental (means you spec in the fire and frost trees) with ice barrier, elemental with blastwave, pom/blastwave much later. 17/0/34 Frost is just the least gear dependent in PvP. 
---
Rogues are the same way, they just farm gold worse. Their raid specs are a joke in pvp to. Not as bad as Arcane/frost which is what all mages but one will be specc in tier 1/2, but still bad.
---
**Don't stress it. Mages have one of the highest qualities of life in the game.**
---

---
Gruggle orgle gurugle!!!
---
They seem to be the best available option.
---
 But they're hard to come by since they drop of a rare spawn.
---
But good choice!
---
I think you would be able to say "NAAAAAA" without a lower jaw. 
---
I wish I could have picked Thunder Bluff, but the risk of non-pvp related death is far worse than any other city.
---
They havnt confirmed that anywhere (especially not cross realm BGs as there would be uproar)
---
And the 'Vanilla WoW Classic' launch that follows it will also be once in a lifetime.
---
Fucking rip. Didnt even read the blizz forum post.
---
Thats a massive dissapointment 
---
I... don't know how to feel about this. I think I approve? Not that you need my approval.
---
Luckily I have a good strategy for this myself so I guess I'll be good. But it's true that not much will be available from the start and the competition will be high.
---
Bullshit. I too was there and what I remember is that with each patch 1.8 and forward, the forums were bitching about them nerfing the BG.
---
8 days played to 60? I wouldn't call that moderate at all.
---
what if I live in Iceland?
---
Arcane wasn’t really much of a thing. All arcane had back then was Arcane missiles and arcane explosion. It saw some action when people started picking up a specific trinket from ZG but otherwise people were just Frost/Fire.  Once your guild was through BWL and into AQ and Naxx all mages switched fire. 
---
Thats a good question, because the class i want to main always changes me and i can never decide what i want and it annoys me to no end.
---
The orcs were mind controlled by the legion. After being freed, despite being lethargic, they were kept as slaves by the Alliance.
---
Only after reconnecting with their shamanistic spiritual roots did their lethargy get cured. All this is communicated through the clickable books in Vanilla WoW.
---
But the average, lore ignorant player thinks - "Not blond white humans? Looks monstrous? Must be bad guys!"
---
But how do you know sharding won't be used? can you see the future?
---
As I've said previously, if a massive event like the opening of the gates of AQ occurs , most of the server will be there, so does that mean sharding will not be activated because you think they only implemented sharding for the launch ?  If it's an on/off thing, when do they decide where it's okay to use it and when it's not ?
---
Also regarding data, I've done an extensive debate with another person in this thread discussing why blizzard's data isn't exactly too far apart from some pservers.
---
Also why do you lump all pservers together? you do realize I'm speaking about a very specific few "authentic" servers , but I use "some pservers" because I cannot name them, you obviously have never tried "some pservers" given how you think they are all exactly the same.
---
One final thing I'd like to tell you is , this thread was never a pserver vs classic debate in order to show pservers are better, it was about authenticity vs modernization, you should know by now that most pserver players will be playing classic as well, in fact blizzard made classic to bring pserver players.
---
Not to be confused with me saying it was made ONLY for pserver players, but for if we were to talk about it from a business pov pulling in non subscribed players or old players who arent subbed to current wow back is more subscription money for blizz and people already playing BFA are already subscribed , so in the end blizzard doesn't make anything for free.
---
I just want to say that all I'm trying to do is increase awareness so we'll end up having a truly authentic vanilla experience.
---
no it means playing for a goal and in most cases the goal is to win the game not be stuck in a 3 day battle with shit rewards. 
---
Doubling down on your retardation rather than showing any evidence.
---
It’s a bold strategy.
---
/duel  
---
/forfeit
---
/pvp
---
As soon as the duel is about to start. 
---
&gt;Most NPCs are impossible to get around solo.
---
That was the point of them. Christ sake.
---
Well how else am I meant to turn? I need the house to click all my buttons!
---
Bro I wouldn't worry about it. MC is the first raid. If thats all you need. Then you hardly need raiding. That being said yes even without any raid items Shadow priest are very powerful. Dispel magic is the goat. Also your rank 10 gear is crazy good for pvp.
---
That being said. You are still going to want to do. MC for Anathema and, ToEp. Then do ZG for hero charm. I know they are both raids but one is MC. The easiest joke raid in classic and the other is ZG. A very puggable 20 man. So it's not too bad.
---
Those three items alone though. Jesus himself could not find the words to tell you how OP Hero charm and ToEp are.
---
I’m beyond envious you get to do this for the first time.
---
Kargoz has good class guides on YouTube, but besides that, try to hold off on reading about every mechanic and every dungeon. Don’t worry about optimal specs or best weapons. Just level and take your time.
---
Welcome to the original World of Warcrack  
---
TIL seeking pre-raid BiS is now considered min/maxing. 
---
RIP
---
Dude, multi boxing is 100% allowed. 1 keypress = 1 action per client. Per client. That means as long as one button press only activates 1 action in each client it’s okay. Blizzard has said many times over the years that multi boxing is okay.  Why wouldn’t they? They get 5-10x the subs. You’re kind of just making a fool of yourself.
---
Because why waste the travel time?
---
There's been times I've found it faster because you don't have to deal with screw-ups.
---
Human- Priest
---
Dwarf- Paladin
---
Gnome- Mage
---
N. Elf- Druid
---
Tauren- Shaman
---
Orc- Warrior
---
Troll- Hunter
---
Undead- Warlock
---
Honestly, the reason I’m rolling priest for classic is because of how much of a god you are in dungeons. I remember doing some crazy stuff to save the group from wiping on bad pulls back in vanilla. 
---
Which makes sense with the whole - You do but you don't - doesn't it.
---
Stop being toxic. It's not productive.
---
Holy Moly! Bag quests!! Yess
---
and the Vanilla WoW Classic 2: Electric boogaloo lanch will be once in a lifetime.
---
Seems that "everyone clicking Songflower at the same time" requires spell batching so it's not sure it'll be possible.
---
self cleaning litter box, best investment I ever made.
---
Pve server for maximum efficiency while playing, rekt scrub. 
---
Actually those occured quite often in private servers
---
Except enhancement/ret are perfectly viable and useful specs during levelling that turn into turds once you hit 60 and try to do any end game content. So it's entirely possible you get to 59 very happy with your class and hit 60 and get very annoyed.
---
Arcane was good for PvP with AP, PoM Pyro but people didn’t really spec it for PvE. 
---
Not even just war, even political opponents or even other sports teams. People are tribalistic and many have head up ass syndrome. 
---
That doesn't change the fact that they did it, and it's not unfathomable to think they'll be manipulated again.  
---
I don't really think a majority of any streamer's player base will stick to leveling a character for hundreds of hours just to keep up with said streamer. Sure, it's going to be annoying but I think the people who will stay after the first 20 levels are people who like the game and dont just play it to troll or ruin other people's time. And if those shitty players associated with the streamers all stick to one guild, they'll be easy to identify and disregard.
---
50%. Happy medium between the crazy and the casual.
---
For a while I thought about true no-lifing but recently I’ve been showing my housemate a private server and I’ve realized I just can’t game for crazy long stretches.
---
I love playing WoW but I also love going for walks with my dog, i also love reading, love drinking with my friends, love working out. I live a simple life so WoW will have a big place but it won’t take over like I once fantasized it might.
---
PLUS the new phase schedule makes me realize that BWL won’t be out for 6+ months, and that’s where the real endgame starts IMO. In vanilla I entered a hardcore raiding guild halfway through BWL and I got so many epics so quickly since they had already been clearing MC and Ony weekly for months.
---
It's honestly not that hard, I think people just overthink the whole thing and feel pressured to perform, because as the tank everyone's eyes are on you.
---
Most are, if private servers are any indication you're going to have more who actually want to get the exalted rep rewards. When it first releases, it's just just going to be people rushing for rep. You might think they're the minority but they really aren't.
---
No. Dgaf about streamers. 
---
You should not avoid raids if you want to be a top pvper. I know that is a bit counter-intuitive based on moderm MMOs but vanilla mixed everything together. This always meant that, for any class and any spec, somewhere in a raid there was a BiS for pvp.
---
I suggest finding a casual raiding guild that will accept you healing wilst shadow spec and just saving DKP for when you can roll on the items you want; you will most likely not have first dibs on anything, but if you do your part and are loyal to the guild you should eventually get what you want.
---
Upside is you don’t *need* that gear to be decent at PvP, but later on when most people have end-game gear you will feel the sting.
---
Also later on some people sell a raid slot for priest epic staff quest so you could go that way as well.
---
I disagree. Maybe it's my bias, but i feel like it's harder to be a great tank too. As a tank you have to memorize each dungeon, each patrol.
---
Tanking scholomance for example means you have to know where and how to pull each mob, hold aggro on them, you have to memorize all the abilties of the mobs, especially the ghosts and casters. You're also the one marking, so you have to keep track of who can CC, and what to CC. You're also the one keeping track of mana and cooldowns.
---
Basically you're the quarterback of the group. Everything runs through you.
---
I love healers, and being a good healer takes skill, of course. But i cannot imagine that it's harder to be a great healer than a great tank, at least not for most content. Of course as we get into raiding we're talking about different skills.
---
But i'd really like to see someone tank Scholo, Strat, or UBRS and say that healing isn't much easier at every level.
---
Awww man! I'm NA, so not sure how viable that would be. Thanks though, hope you guys and gals have fun!
---
Wild, incorrect assumptions being made about me buddy. I'm going to need you to take a deep breath.
---
It's half assed because Vanilla with no changes would progress 1.1-1.12 exactly the same as it did before minus bugs which obviously would never be brought back. It's half assed because they are making a legal private server, not Vanilla. It's called classic for a reason. It's half assed because they only chose 1.12 because it was what they had the most hard data for so it was the easier choice.
---
I actually don't want Vanilla with no changes buddy. Vanilla was 12 major content patches. Vanilla was change. If you want 1.12 go play a private server. Classic should have regular patches every few months if you want it to be authentic Vanilla. The power dynamic of 1.12 is not Vanilla.
---
Also, I was talking about them half assing AV to 1.12 because it was easier for them.
---
Are you me from the future?
---
I like you man, you do you. 
---
This is so not true though. I am raiding on private servers, and I fun druid very engaging. When I was raiding as Resto, the following spells would be on my bars, and used extensively:
---
Healing Touch Rank 3
---
Healing Touch Rank 4
---
Healing Touch Rank 6
---
Healing Touch Rank 9(10 after AQ)
---
Rejuvenation Rank 4
---
Rejuvenation Rank 10(11 after AQ)
---
Regrowth Rank 2
---
Regrowth Rank 4
---
Regrowth Rank 9
---
And I would actively use all of these during a raid with the exception of Rank 9 Regrowth which is purely an emergency heal for when shit hits the fan. This was as Balance(Moonglow) spec. Deep resto also gain Swiftmend and crit chance on Regrowth, making even more ranks of Regrowth usable. It's a very engaging class to heal with. Much more so than Paladin f.ex. 
---
The auto attack table for players and mobs is a bit different. Mobs can't glance and players can't crush. So the table for player hitting boss is miss, dodge, parry, glancing blow, block, crit, hit.
---
You can carry any fucking dungeon as a fury tank. Need deeps or tps? Go DW. Need mitigation? Slap on shield + tank gear. The CC, the DPS, the TPS means you can take just about any bunch of shitters not actively trying to throw and carry through.
---
Healer? Healer can go OOM, LOL. 
---
This is bad advice Tin. firstly he ignored your statement where you said you don't wanna raid. Secondly every raid is gonna have a shadow to stack shadow weaving. You will never get first crack at dps gear if you raid as shadow. So to be clear as a DPS shadow is a raiding meme spec but, it's not a meme spec because it's there as a support not a dps. Which is why you will be able to raid but you will be last in line for the dopest loot.
---
Moving on from that if you wanna pvp really well and never have to raid. Your four best class choices are Priest, Rogue, Mage and Hunter. With mage being in last place of the four.
---
You see what separates the men from the boys in classic is crit rating. Most classes need it to win and pre raid. You can't get it. The thing that makes Rogues and Hunters good is that agility is their primary stat so they have a good chance to crit even without raid gear. For shadow priests it's the same thing. They don't need crit so they tend to be very strong. Also and I can not say this enough. Dispel magic is the goat. It's the best spell in classic wow and it don't need to scale lol.
---
The Horde aren't "evil" but the Undead were never "good". Weirdos who make video game characters their waifu's just threw a fit about Sylvanas because that is what mentally ill people do. 
---
This is the Undead intro from Vanilla WoW. I think it's pretty clear that undead don't give a single f@#% about anyone but themselves, including everyone on their own faction. Undead characters even start with a different reputation with factions because they are "forsaken". 
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZNHpsdB1Aw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZNHpsdB1Aw) 
---
Orcs and Thrall are basically a play on Moses. They had a exodus, Thrall is in the basket in the river. 
---
Tauren like you said are more about Native Americans.
---
The pantheon, a lot of the void stuff and even some of the characters like Broxigar (Tolkien's Fingolfin) are straight up ripoffs from Tolkien with Lovecraft being more the inspiration for the "bad guys" outside Sargeras (Tolkien's Melkor).
---
You also have design heavily influenced from TSR/Dragonlance with the gnomes and kind of tech you see in WoW. 
---
Nothing is really black and white. It's just a bunch of things that were "borrowed" that made for fun video games. It's not exactly "high fantasy".  
---
There was an update that made it so you couldn't pull warmasters out of the boss room to kill separately. That update made towers more relevant.
---
Yes, you can still equip it... it's only Engineering that has restrictions about keeping the profession
---
Your reaching a bit to make it fit, most Reddit posts would fit your definition, leading one to instead read your post and get a "get off my lawn" vibe instead.
---
Clickbait is an intentionally sensationalized or misleading title that is purely designed to get you to click on the link, and it's contents often have little to do with the subject.
---
Horde are STINKY, and ZOMBIES, Have you ever SMELLED a BARN,  
---
I vote for sharping for the first day in the starting area and that’s it. 
---
I'm working overtime right now while renovating my old room at my parents house into a supreme gaming lounge for only the most distinguished elite gamer, me. One week before classic launch i will move back there and quit my job, using my savings for food and other household goods while living at my parents free of charge i have all day everyday to become the most powerful mage on the server, good luck  losers!
---
No problem :) we do have an NA guy with us because the saturday raid times suit him, but for the vast majority sadly our times won't suit NA peeps. I hope you find what you're looking for though!
---
I exclusively played Warrior and DK dps in Legion and BFA and stopped once season 1 in BFA ended. 
---
A good tank can also get the job done with a less skilled healer. At some point in high keys the tank will simply just die, if he doesn't play the situation properly and fucks up his mitigation. No matter how good the healer is. 
---
You can also look at it this way. If you play with 4 DPS and had to choose between a tank and a healer then you will get higher keys done with the tank.
---
AV will still end up being the way you don't like eventually though. You realize that?
---
BWAHN BWAAH BWOWH
---
First rule of C2C fight club?
---
Nah, I'm EU.
---
I don't think variety streamers that will only stream WoW for a month will make a lot of people join them, when Lirik streamed and played on the Legion launch and \~2 months in or whatever it was he barely got any following in-game because his audience doesn't care. What affects a server balance are streamers like Sodapoppin and Asmongold, but those guys will probably stream non-stop until classic ends so you can't really blame them for it either.
---
So check their streams on launch and avoid them, nothing more you can do.
---
Go for it. Like the others said, throw out your guides, research nothing. Forget that list of "essential" addons, look them and macros up as you progress and realize what you actually need. Appreciate what you're given to work with, read those quest dialogues and explore the zones. Back in my day, if we didn't know how to do something or where it was... we asked for help, found someone who did, and made a friend. Enter vanilla as a noob if you can, it's a journey that hooked millions. 
---
"Just play good def and you can make AV as long as you need."
---
Spoken like an ally. There is no defending if your horde. It's very obvious that a blind man would be our raid leader for that bg. Because only a blind ass hole would put up a defense with that many holes in it. 
---
That doesn't seem to be the case said but 20 other people here and realmstatus player logs. Almost all the top.bwl warriors are 2h bre slam spec someone already pointed it out?
---
Ok bye
---
Of course they haven't decided. Respawn rates, quest items, max zone population, max realm population, sharding rules and implementation will all be very much up in the air until they get a few good beta stress tests under the belt, and probably into a few patches in the weeks post release. You can do all the theorycrafting you want but until it's tested out in game with the actual client/server setup it's all pretty pointless. What matters is how it plays, just creating arbitrary rules would be stupid.  
---
No it won't be like vanilla, because vanilla was a complete shit show for 6 months at release and a simultaneous online release with 4 million players is completely different to selling boxed copies of a new game in 2004.
---
Hunters: Ya never know whatcha might need
---
It's not just about threat dude and Im not saying Druid are shit tanks. The point is you literally can't raid progression without Warrior tanks, but you can without Druid tanks. For this simple reason you can't put Warrior and Druid tanks into the same tier. Period.
---
AV sucks. Want to push into the enemy base? Oh too bad someone next to you detonated a couple invisible mines and you're all dead now. Great design /s
---
Not entirely true.  Given enough spell power things like Renew are way more efficient.  Renew has 100% +healing added to it as it's coefficient. So if you're moving through a dungeon and don't want to be left behind or lag behind the group,  throwing a Renew on someone while OOC isn't gonna kill ya.  *And the fact that you compared Renew to Flash Heal in terms of efficiency is so funny it's clear you've never played a healer in your life.  Just go back to playing your huntard or rogue; mmkay pumpkin?*
---
Also, if you're in a dungeon and not healing as a healer, I'll just straight up kick you.  There, that's my "hilarious, feeble, petty" move.  Pretty funny isn't it? HAHAHAHA.  /s 
---
Don't wanna do your role out of spite?  /kick .  Don't let the door hit you where the good lord split you.  At least the warlock in Echo's example is **doing his job of damage and then keeping his mana up with lifetap.**    
---
Sweet summer child. I honestly hope they do make the AVs long and then you can sit in the horde cave for a couple hours getting aoe'ed down by a turtle squad
---
&gt;Most Reddit posts would fit your definition
---
Well, for 1) I don't visit "most of Reddit" for that exact reason and 2) even to the extent that is true, this isn't about most of Reddit. This is about /r/ClassicWoW, which a casual glance through the posts shows that this is literally the only trending one with a title like that.
---
&gt;Clickbait is an intentionally sensationalized or misleading title that is purely designed to get you to click on the link, and it's contents often have little to do with the subject.
---
So, literally this post?
---
The guy sensationalized his title with the usual "DAE do THIS?" type garbage and it is clearly purely designed to get you to click on the post so that the poster can get that sweet karma and comments on the post. And as far as contents often having little to do with the subject, 1) there's literally nothing provided in the subject of the title so there's nothing that could possibly have anything to do with it and 2) the operative word is often - not always.
---
Of course, if someone drinks demon blood on their behalf and their entire race is corrupted by fel, then they could be mind controlled again.
---
It's very important for all the narrow minded people to play on Alliance. It makes Horde a haven, especially on RP servers.
---
The three day long AVs were cool for about a week. Then it was just irritating that you could never win a match. 
---
I’d wait until in queue for an hour and pvp for another 2 hours and realize the fight isn’t going anywhere at all. 
---
??? Unless AV was changed and I don't remember, Horde had a mean choke point at the gates to the Keep. It's not as good as the bridge that the Alliance has but it's still defendable.
---
There was a really nifty talent added to deep Prot and Ret in Wrath. Prot got 'Touched by the Light' Increaded Spellpower by 60% of strength and increased crit heals by 30%. Ret got 'Shealth of Light' which increased Spellpower by 30% of Attack Power and your crit heals healed for an additional 60% over 12 seconds.
---
Now, these were kind of wasted on the way WotLK played and really only helped with self healing. However, I really think something along those lines along with some slight mana fixing in their trees would produce a result like what you were thinking in Vanilla. It would add an interesting component and allow for more flex picking.
---
Obviously everyone would lose their minds if hybrids were able to actually *gasp* play as a hybrid. It wasn't in muh Vanilla, so it's a pipe dream.
---
Not long enough, need to pad this out to at least 2 hours.
---
I have a commute to and from work to fill!
---
Blizzard has run wow for 14 years. I actually do believe they have all the statistics they need to make a decision without a “beta stress test”, something I highly doubt Blizzard would do. They could just emulate it, wasn’t the last beta stress test in 2004?
---
Thanks for your input, strange last paragraph that has nothing to do with my post though. 
---
I played a dwarf priest, I loved to duel horde at the meeting stone for Black Rock depths, mind control them and run them off the edge into the lava. Back then not many classes had the ability to survive and get out of it, so most would die and have to run back. It was great. 
---
That would definitely be a huge nerf to songflowers. I wouldn't be too fussed personally but I bet there'd definitely be some outcry if that's the case. Guess we'll see in the beta, if there is one.
---
Yea I had looked at profit margins for some chains before and I'm aware of how crazy tight things can be.
---
It was IIRC Dominoes that was averaging something like 7-8k a year.
---
WHAT ?
---
Any idea if an alliance holy dmg priest would be viable dps with the best spell dmg gear?
---
He makes his money from twitch streaming, youtube ad revenue is nothing. I am failing to see what is the problem with people promoting themselves as content creators in an enthusiat forum. What is the point in whinging about ten minute videos, it just comes off as petty.
---
Never been this happy to have my ears bleed.
---
Are you saying that dual wield doesn't seem to outperform 2H BRE slam?  
---
Well, look past the BWL parses and into the AQ40/Naxx parses.   
---
However, yes, if BRE is in it's final form, if you are good enough with slam spec,  then it is competitive with dual wield for the majority of the game, especially horde side. You also get some alternative BiS pieces which is nice for your gearing.   
---
My main point was that you are taking the best PvP weapons from all the other warriors. Usually these are given to your guild's top performer/best pvpers.
---
I have been playing on a private server clearing MC each week for over 6 months now and only one BRE drop. Should we give it to the player who says he wants to be 2 H warrior cause it sounds fun, the one who tops the meters because he comes extra prepared to every raid or the one who actively PvPs all the time and grinds honor/pvp gear?  
---
In the mean time, how many other 2H weapons are you going to take? Will you be performing well with them compared to the dual wielders?
---
This is the comment people need to see. What you say is true. It doesn't really matter what version of AV we use. They all turn into this stupid rush fest. 
---
The hardware/server/client side of it is only a small part of it, and yes they should have a good idea of how to handle that before launch. The problem is the gameplay, all the npcs/drops/quests that were dramatically altered or revamped throughout the xpacs. How many people can quest at once in Elwyn Forest or Westfall or Redridge or Duskwood? If the quests are overloaded how many people can grind mobs in those zones and still get some sort of progress? How slow is so slow you just feel frustrated and quit?  
---
These are the sort of things you might want to think about before investing millions of company dollars in a game launch.
---
The big political conflict is the continued Warsong occupation of Ashenvale.  The orcs are pretty much on par with trolls for having a bunch of splinter groups and all of them being hostile.  
---
The forsaken are a walking succession crisis, with them being dead and all but still holding the land.    Their open hostility to the living doesn’t help.  Yes, it’s hard to tell them apart from the scourge.  The scourge only got a foothold by infiltration and spreading plague, so having some more dead guys showing up had a tendency to put people on edge. 
---
The only ones who the alliance has little beef with are the Tauren, but they hopped in bed with the orcs as soon as they landed because allying with them put them in a key position to settle their conflicts with the quilboar, centaurs, and harpies in their favor.  They made their bed, and now they’re as legitimate targets as anyone else.  
---
Any take on morality is beside the point.  The horde are the enemy.   The alliance isn’t without its own hostile acts, sure, but it’s pretty much par for the course given that anything that isn’t a human, dwarf, gnome or elf wants them all dead, except the goblins who just want all their money.
---
Out of those classes I would go druid/lock or priest/hunter. This way you dont have to really share loot and they work well together for world pvp and grp quests.
---
If u really want to play shaman consider picking a melee to benefit from windfury.
---
You can if you take those bosses as special cases, which they are. 
---
As a counter example, druids aren’t considered the best healers just because other healers can’t decurse. And so on.
---
It’s fair to put then in the same ”top” tier, for the most part, because it gives the correct impression of the class as a great tier. The step down yo palas in tier 2 is pretty huge and who wants a shaman tank, probably very few people.
---
Warrior: can tank all content
---
Druid: can tank most content by far, superior to warrior in various situations
---
Palas: can only tank 5 mans
---
Shamans: can only tank at low level
---
I think you see why warrior and druids go in roughtly the same tier...
---
It's not that AV changed. It's that the bg is 15 years old at this point and while the choke at the keep used to be real. People figured out the frozen waterfall just plain lets you walk up it. So now allies just stroll right on by. Unless the horde group is 100x better then the alliance. The horde should never win. 
---
Not without exploits like above. Late in progression, holy priests can smite etc during downtime on farm bosses, but pretty much meh overall.
---
Really disappointed as well.  I can't remember exactly which version it was, but I really loved the day-long battles.  It felt like an epic war, and was so much more fun than the 15 minute race to the generals.  I loved summoning the old gods and frostwolves etc.
---
Very small difference either way. If you're a pvp try hard go dwarf, otherwise whatever tickles your pickle.
---
Same boat here in Seattle. While it's true I'm getting less and less excited the longer I wait - I'm not giving up my summer to grind argent dawn rep.
---
I see what you’re saying, I agree. However I do believe they will have to make a decision in advance and when it might impact gameplay a great deal I hope they will share their decision with us sometime before launch. 
---
You argued that 1.12 was the longest duration AC and called those who thought so “educated”. Well you’re wrong and calling other people pedantic when they call you out on it is toxic, so how about *you* stop calling people uneducated and toxic.
---
The MC griefing isnt the problem here, pservers have an issue with where the body ends up being after falling off the boat. It usually ends up needing gm assitance to move the body to someweher accesible for the player which is just a headache for everyone involved. 
---
Pay me the salary of a Blizz dev and I will.
---
Happy cake day. And yes. This is much more prevalent even in pservers today compared to retail. 
---
Yes most people think corporations are just hording wealth at the top to screw everyone. However thats not how the rich get so rich and the poor get so poor. No one gets rich on their salary. They get rich off investment. The difference between having 50 extra dollars a month just to invest. Is the difference between dying poor or dying a millionaire. Shit adds up like a mother across time.
---
Thank you as well. I really appreciate you taking the time to write this out.
---
Now if you had to choose a class that didnt require much raiding, but you still could if you wished and also was main focused on world pvp, would you do spriest of rogue? 
---
It's not that I never wanna do raids, I just prefer doing pvp. 
---
Blizzard have stated time and time again that they pay attention to the community on many different forums. If nobody created threads like these they would think everything is fine and everyone is happy with what they’re proposing when that is clearly not the case.
---
Also as if I think I’m a “prophet” - get bent. People are free to upvote and downvote if they disagree, how is speaking for myself and others who think the same way making myself out to be some kind of prophet? Weirdo.
---
Soap shards
---
That's actually pretty comforting.  Will I have issues getting Into raids as a spriest or should I be holy for raids and ask for the spriest gear? Or is that just weird/greedy. 
---
I'm torn between a rogue and spriest atm, but something about spriest just seems so intriguing 
---
Zhurion you are feeding the trolls. Just listen to this miserable ass hat. He just wants to whine. Ignore him and move on.
---
You couldn't feasibly stack world buffs in vanilla very much afaik. Pservers are different in this regard.
---
Them be fightin' words, son.
---
The most useful dwarf skill, find treasure, doesn't work with hunter tracking abilities and herblism/ mining, very useful professions for a hunter. For that reason, I think NE pulls ahead but just barely. 
---
Makes me not so sad about wanting to be a spriest :):). Thank you 
---
Do you have 8 day old body stench? That was the smell associated with every zone in Vanilla for me.  
---
&gt; Technically speaking, it has plenty of damage mitigation. **It can block**, parry, Devotion Aura, etc.
---
Terrible design point: They have reasonable block after they're crit.
---
Tanks should not be crit. Warriors don't need to be crit for same / better block stats.
---
I agree, maybe 3 at max and only for the first few starter zones.
---
Nah Kargoz and madseason are content creators. These are just streamers who are riding the hype at the right time. 
---
&gt; A paladin can get the def cap to be crit immune.
---
&gt; He can't push crushing blow though.
---
Therein lies the problem. Become crit immune = lose like 75% of your block, threat, etc.
---
Frost and fire also play different than retail. You may find you like frost more than you think. I tried BFA out and didn't like mage at all but loved it in vanilla. 
---
Also for comparison, on a private server I had a full t3 mage. Basically bis in every slot or close to it. I then did a pug mc for fun while fire spec and did about the same damage as a frost mage in blues and greens, and behind every t1+ frost mage. 
---
Or make a WoW mobile like Diablo!
---
its not the same.
---
Nice.
---
Show me forum posts or youtube videos or ANYTHING of outrage when the changes to av were added in 1.10 and 1.12
---
Spoiler: You won't. The player base welcomed those changes because 1.5 and 1.8 AV were awful. Just because you read about it from someone with rose tinted glasses of when they were 12 doesn't mean it was or is good. 1.12 AV is the best form of AV.
---
Auto attack on 1. Checks out. 
---
its not much of a big deal anymore.
---
I can't tell who's trolling anymore.
---
One of the few race choices that truly doesn’t matter 
---
Nice! That is awesome. Of course I might still keep enchanting, but It's nice to have the option to drop it
---
Plus, we have the inherit DPS overflow to compensate for. A problem that has plauged WoW since...... forever?
---
If anything, we'll need healers.
---
I see you are also a connoisseur of the finest puns. 
---
This linguist sommelier deserves more up votes.
---
Man I'm glad someone else brought up the win rate. Of course this is anecdotal but my experience as Horde was that AV was a 25% or less win rate if the Alliance had a pulse. They could hop right over the base walls, capturing towers was laughably easy, and they could escape and grief so easily on towers. Trying to do it in their base was a death sentence.
---
I used to /who people of different classes and try to find people. Seriously, wtf are you even doing if you aren't tanking some awesome shit with a group? 
---
You don't want to come? Clearly you didn't hear me. You want to join us. We're GOING places man.
---
This..... this was back in the DPS days, long before I tanked or healed.
---
I came
---
This is just making me more excited. I hope I can actually get a chance to connect with some people. Thank you! 
---
When classic hits, you just might.
---
Yeah, I wish they would give us multiple trackings but REEEE no changes :/
---
Fuck what everyone else says. If you want to be really cool, have all the bitches and lots of friends, roll a Warrior and tank. Seriously, people love team players.
---
Or...... you know, roll a healer. Prettymuch the same thing applies.
---
I wish they would give us Aimed shot from stealth lmao 
---
Yeah, I’ve just done the class guides from Kargoz. Fortunately nothing really beyond that, besides vids like “things I love about classic”, which is pretty much the same list over and over again: feeling of smallness, difficulty, rewarding etc. can’t wait to actually have classic dungeons mean something other than just a meaningless obstacle en route to level cap in retail. Thank you a :D
---
I think 3 hours is the sweet spot
---
&gt; I’m not saying that a person isn’t being a dick, I’m saying it’s a perfectly valid style of play and being dick isn’t a “wrong” way of playing the game. 
---
It is only "not wrong" from the dysfunctional and antisocial viewpoint that there are no rules of behaviour in any games other than "follow the letter of the rules".
---
&gt; That style of play gave us things like Angwe, guy was a massive dickbag but it made WoW a richer, more memorable experience.
---
As I see it Angwe was on the borderline but he was on a PvP server and by rolling on a PvP server you consent to world PvP. You accept that you might get ganked at Menethil, in return for the opportunity to gank others. If you want to opt out of Angwe ganking you then you can roll on a PvE server at any time.
---
Nobody consented to ninja looting, people deliberately wiping their own groups or raids or other forms of deliberate dickery. Those are thing which are possible within the limits of the game code but also not okay and not "valid". Unless you mean something weird by "valid".
---
My choice entirely depends on some variables we still don't have an answer to.
---
I made a little flow chart:
---
1) Are pre-patch 1.4 epic mounts available? If no, then Undead Warlock, if yes proceed to the next question.  
---
2) If they ARE available, is quest rep spillover a thing? As in, if I do a quest and get 400 Undercity rep, I also get 100 Orgrimmar, TB and Darkspear rep? If Yes, Undead Warlock. If no, proceed to the next question.  
---
3) Are rep turn ins (like wool, for example) in the game? If yes, Undead Warlock, if no, Troll Mage.  
---
Basically, I'm playing an Undead Warlock, unless the oldschool Red and White Raptors are available (and if like retail, they were only available to Trolls since Darkspear Exalted wasn't possible) in which case I'll be playing Troll Mage.
---
I'm trolling? Lol... Nah dawg. I respect the grind but low effort is low effort, and that's what y'all are defending here. Its like making an unboxing video 10 minutes and stretching it out for time... Low. Effort.
---
Nelf for that +9 base agi.
---
Well that depends on the type of pvp you will be doing in the world. If you plan on being alone. Rogue is the goat of world pvp. No other class even comes close. One of the major benefits of a rogue. Is that far more then gear. Skill and items make a rogue. Items like Gnomish Death Ray, Goblin Helm, Grenades, Free action pots, skull of impending doom. These are what define a deadly rogue far more then better gear. All of that stuff has nothing to do with raiding. On a rogue if you are willing to go all in on the consumables. You can kill people with grey gear. That being said. The larger the pvp groups get. The worse it gets for a rogue. The trade off to being the goat in world pvp. Is that in BG pvp you are midling on your best day.
---
S. Priests on the other hand crush in 1v1 pvp. They are super hard to kill and hit like a mac truck out of the box. They don't need crit and having some of the best support abilities in the game. Dispel magic is the goat. (sorry can't say it enough.) Which means not only are they very strong in 1v1. They are also amazing in groups. Warriors will literally fall to their knees and kiss your feet if you keep them dangerous spells from making them do nothing.
---
So in conclusion. Both are amazing. Go rogue if you are a loner who wants to dominate world pvp. Go priest if you wanna be really strong in bg's and play with groups of people in pvp. To be clear Neither is good for R14 grind though. A rogue is just bad at farming warlord. Lucky he don't need to and, a shadow priest will be asked to reroll disc. That being said unless you plan on playing 18 hours a day. I wouldn't worry about what HW farm teams want.

Fuck asmonthot
---
Wtf lol it’s obvious you don’t play ret paladin 
---
Thanks for the tip on professions. I have no clue what it will feel like to have them actually matter, so that will hopefully add a whole other dimension to the game. I have always loved going out and searching for resources, only to get lost into something else on the way. 
---
I’m completely torn between two classes. Night Elf Druid, or Troll Shaman. Each one seems equally fascinating and flavorful to me, and I could see myself finding continual enjoyment in either. I might just do both, but I don’t want to spread myself too thin and rob myself of really diving into one. Each one would totally transform the character of the game, and I feel spoiled to get to choose between the two!
---
This is a great example (even though it ignores the fact that the orca weren’t brought here willingly). But I guess what I missed in my question, is why don’t Horde players imply that the alliance are the bad guys? 
---
&gt; I think I speak for many when I say we *want* those epic battles.
---
You speak only for yourself

"^something ^something Deratus Bellum" idk what random string of latin words are used but good gods that music is ageless
---
36 hour AVs are a waste of time in terms of efficiency. Even if you don't play efficiently, there are MUCH better uses of your time if you wish to progress.
---
Just FYI, 
---
These were first posted on /R/WoW where they removed them due to them consistently covering the first page, I went to /r/classicwow and pulled them down stating the same thing, and that i'd stick to one a week,
---
then I just pulled them down because were upset that they were getting upvoted,
---
Despite the fact that in every single post , I stated it was Inkarnate asset and their engine,
---
anyway they're over at /r/imaginarywow now to stop people getting upset about it.
---
I have literally zero interest in forum karma, I only use reddit to browse 4 subreddits, and to keep maps coming for people to track the progress of my addon project.
---
also my first 3 maps got virtually no interest so that isn't entirely true, it was basically the crossroads and northshire abbey people enjoyed.
---
I remember probably over 90% of player were excited for flying mounts too, and LFD was fairly popular when it was announced, i distinctly remember that. Sometimes it's not until later that people relalize why something is bad.
---
People have been asking for AV back since TBC. I so remember during all of TBC how people complained that AV was worse.
---
Are you unemployed op ? Or maybe retired ? Because those are the only ways you could possible enjoy the 4-6 hours long AVs.
---
&gt; whatever tickles your pickle
---
Wouldn't you want to tickle a dwarf pickle?
---
Well....did you invite him to tank?
---
Haha for sure. I'm torn between tauren druid and troll priest myself, with a running 3rd for undead warlock. Struggle is real!
---
Sorry if my sentence structure is poor. I have dyslexia. So while I am very knowledgeable. It can be hard for me to type out in a coherent manner. lol
---
there is no "don't care" option
---
Let's say you're a casual player. A large % of players fall into this camp. Let's say you don't bother to grind out your pre-bis and you head into MC. The little dungeon gear you do have equipped if they go with the 1.12 state are pretty decent stat-wise.
---
There is lots of loot in MC that is absolutely garbage with spirit on it etc. and nobody would ever use it under any circumstance unless they had nothing better. This is where having super crappy dungeon gear comes in. Because the dungeon gear has such poor stats the value of those crappy MC epics goes up. Now instead of walking into MC with literally no upgrades to look forward to besides the rare bis drops that have a long wait list attached to them, now you can possibly seek out these "crappy items". 
---
This adds more excitement to your run. You end up stuck in MC for literally forever in vanilla, you want to give the items in there as much value for as long as possible. Having changing item stats is a great way to achieve this.
---
That would be correct, because no one would care if that was your opinion
---
You sound like a fucking delight to group with.  
---
I am not defending it. I'm grown. I've been in the working world long enough to understand the grind is the grind. Saying people who are working for money are doing things for money. Is teenager crap. It's annoying and no one wants to hear about it. If youtube wants their 10. Then a tuber you give it to them and as a viewer you deal with it or you don't. Whining that the sky is blue won't change its shade.
---
There wouldn't be add-ons so that would make console players pretty scrub
---
I'd be okay with Sharding in areas like Valley of Trials, you know, the very begginning zones. But as soon as we leave the area it should be gone.
---
Alliance characters kind of do have reason to be wary of trolls, orcs and undead. At the time of vanilla WoW, this war was just kicking off after a tenuous peace. The orcs just had a demonic relapse and killed Cenarius while butting heads with the Sentinels, and made off with a city's worth of lumber from their sacred forest (and are still in there doing it). Nobody really knew what was up with the Forsaken, but people knew the Scourge annihilated Lordaeron and now these undead are running around with free will. Trolls have been living savagely and getting into conflicts with those around them forever. And the tauren... just happen to be in league with all of them. 
---
I clearly remember to have won several time even if I was a horde member. The bridge was kinda hard but far from impossible to pass through.
---
Things were different back then, people tried to defend every single tower and position, that’s the main reason the games were so long.
---
I remember that one time the alliance was at our boss, but we shield up and after three hours we were able to push them back to their bridge thanks to the icelord, we then won the match, it was epic.
---
Please god no. If you ever want to see 100 players all fighting each other in hillsbrad foothills then you need to vote no for battlegrounds in phase 1.
---
Lol at least you have your faction picked out fam! For some reason, I always get an itch that I’m missing out on either Stormwind or Orgrimmar when I’m playing the opposite faction. Given they’re about even in my opinion, part of choosing a race will come down to the other cities in the faction. 
---
I wish you would stop posting this misinformation. Not only was it not the longest (by one day, but still...) but the rush also started well before TBC. 
---
Yes, you also still had long, multi-hour AVs, in TBC, but those were usually because a dedicated group of people (horde) decided to turtle. We were regularly abused for doing so because people wanted fast games. Twelve years later and we would probably be called griefers, but AV was really the last bastion for some solid PvP - flying was killing world PvP and city raids were almost non-existent. 
---
The long AVs were the minority after 1.12, and the changes started to happen pretty quickly.  
---
Pvp = dwarf. Stoneform is probably the best racial alliance has for pvp. Getting out of a rogue blind, devouring plague, a bunch of stuff is great.
---
Shadowmeld is too gimecky and you can use a invis potion if you really want to as a dwarf. Although fun, meh.
---
Also night elf’s have 1% dodge which actually helps a warrior to kill you...sometimes. If you dodge a white attack he over powers and wins. If you dodge a mortal strike he overpowers and still hurts.
---
Pve= NE has a little advantage cause of more agility. It’s so small though it doesn’t matter too much.
---
Dwarfs attack animations look better for melee and they also actually use a bow like a bow. Night elf’s shoot it sideways which is dumb.
---
Dwarf wins (but I’m biased and love dwarfs)
---
Also something else to consider. As someone who already played a shadow priest up to rank 10 with no raiding on nost. They are very powerful but their is not art to a shadow priest. You pretty much hit the same buttons regardless of whats happening. Which can be good but if you like to feel rewarded by big skill plays. It may also not be the class for you.
---
Just when I think you are being helping you throw a curve ball at me. 
---
I am a loner in the game but I also wanna not suck at bgs and pairing up with people to pvp could be fun too.
---
I got lots to think about. And I 100% wont be playing 14 hour days.  I got maybe 2 hours a day in me for it
---
they can come too
---
They are good in 5 mans 
---
And that’s about it 
---
Hope.  Hope is the problem.  When Classic was announced, people hoped.  They hoped that the best things from Vanilla would be in Classic.  1.12 is not the best version of AV for many people.
---
They crushed my hopes today.
---
Yup. lfg sm library
---
The thing that many people haven't touched upon is that old-school Alterac Valley (Pre-1.8 when all of its original features were still untouched) wasn't just a battleground, it was almost a zone in itself. There was something there for all players to do, regardless if they were level 51 or level 60, low-geared or high-geared. You're a level 60 in epics? Great! Fight in the vanguard and try to break through the enemy's ranks. You're under level sixty or have poor gear? That's okay too - go farm hides, armor scraps, or blood and crystals to summon the faction boss. Fishing with friends in Alterac Valley was pretty scummy since you weren't contributing to the battle, but it was also a really fun and relaxing thing to do when you grow tired of the zerg. I also vaguely remember people farming the harpies north of the Stormpike base, and I'm pretty sure I saw the plans for Stronghold Gauntlets drop for some lucky SOB as well. 
---
The point is, old Alterac Valley has less in common with Warsong Gulch and Arathi Basin and far more in common with Wintergrasp and Ashran. It was unique to Vanilla WoW, and Blizzard has never really replicated it since. Was day long AVs poor for honor? Sure! But if you want to farm honor, Warsong Gulch and Arathi Basin are there for you (and even with the zerg meta on private servers, WSG and AB are still much more honor-efficient except on AV weekends). Would it be a shame for you to have to wait an extra couple of weeks to get your pig-stick, your turtle shell, and your frosty tome? Sure. But I'd much rather have slower epics, if it means I get a battleground that is completely unique to WoW Classic and thus something which will always stay relevant. 
---
Even on 1.12,  Alterac Valley is a joke. Rushing from one end of the map to another, while completely ignoring the enemy faction, cannot be what the developers had in mind when they created an epic-scale 40vs40 battleground. Let honor-farmers grind their hearts out in WSG and AB. Restore Alterac Valley to its former glory so both old and new players can enjoy it as it was meant to be. 
---
It will be worth it. You not feeling a connection to your character/guild/community or feeling a lack of accomplishment in retail wasn't because you bought a boost. That's just the game now, and why we're excited for classic to come back. 
---
This actually is appealing to me lol... this is a huge factor for me. I hated pvp in some of the recent expansions because there are so many buttons and choices to make
---
Just to be clear. I am not saying rogues can't bg. They can. I am just saying they aren't very useful to the team if your goal is to win. You can rickedy rock people in BG's you just won't be as productive to winning as some other classes lol.
---
ACCEPT THE INVITE NOOB, WE'RE BOLDLY GOING!
---
Staff is nice as fuck, I want my mage in classic to look exactly like this at level 40. 
---
Will that work? 
---
asking the real questions, Knowing these boundaries leads to knowing the best places to pvp for maximum trolling (longest ghost walks) 
---
100% sure it was still possible in TBC. Since I used to use it to check out ZA. You could also abuse levitate in Wrath iirc to achieve the same effect.
---
Best source I could find says 2.4 patched it out.
---
Then yea you might be looking at a shadow. A shadow priest really feels like a man who made a compact with the devil for power. They just tend to brute force over their enemies. No finesse just overwhelming force lol.
---
Okay, what's your point?
---
Esfand literally comes from youtube... 
---
And being a streamer and youtube doesnt make you less of a content creator. 
---
They create content. Thats what a content creator is.
---
Youre just dont like him/them for some reason and try to discredit them like a hateful cretin. Fucking hell thats so sad. 
---
Why wouldn't it?
---
Kill Hogger at level 9.
---
Die to nearby mobs.
---
Res just above Goldshire.
---
Turn in. 
---
BAM fast travel.
---
1.12 BASELINE 
---
Theres no mine fields, players will just bypass each other and race towards the end like usual.
---
Exactly.
---
There are tauren in dungeons aren’t there? Brd maybe?
---
This is the first character I created and played him all through vanilla.
---
I was pretty focused on just one character back then.
---
DPS is a science, healing is an art and tanking is knowledge. 
---
I spent most of my early days playing WoW convinced that Healer was the most important role in the group. Then I switched to playing it and realized that it was actually the tank. So then I switched to playing tank and it put into perspective just how huge of a difference there is between a run with good DPS and a run with bad DPS.
---
Now that I'm playing DPS again, I just wish I was still a tank so I'd have an easy time starting groups.
---
go watch the us forums...
---
oh and well search google for topics since the announcement...
---
That sounds awesome! If you decide to go ahead with that when classic rolls around, send me a DM. I'd love to join such a guild
---
I never played og classic so I dont have reference for what AV was like prior but I did find it humerous that people were cool with 1.12 no changes but want this changed.
---
another correct response
---
With no Korak, what happens to the loot like the Ice Barbed Spear?
---
My sister has one of those.  ive thought about getting one, but im not sure how my cat would like it.  
---
[quote] killing opposing players no longer drops items like Dwarf Spines, Orc Teeth, or Human Bone Chips. Gross.[/quote]
---
wtf is this? even in wod they had a system that dropped player parts
---
what is going on at modern blizzard?
---
Ohh I thought you were talking about running from one gy to another to avoid high level mobs. Ie: rebel camp gy to booty bay gy.
---
I for one like this version. 
---
* I dislike reinforcements, not having them is huge
---
I played old old AV, and yeah it was super fun, but super boring imo. I like the version where the main thing to do is Defend towers longer than your enemy. Once commanders are all dead, bum rush the last boss. There is normally enough defense going on where farming scarps is still helpful, for the NPCs and for the players.
---
So are you saying you want Naxx in at release and no AQ launch event? At this point I have to wonder if this isn't astroturfing/forum manipulation. Maybe I am just underestimating how stupid people can be and how easily they can be manipulated by content creators with such curious logic.
---
Probably the case. Hanlon's razor blah blah. In before some streamer/content creator replies to me with "strawman" when they are defending a strawman. 
---
I will definitely queue for it, although it seems like I’m in the minority. I miss old AV. 
---
Yea let me just kill one instances boss on repeat because it's more efficient than anything else in the entire game. Excellent game design. Let's just add new items and powercreep melee ranged and mage into one hit kill territory.
---
Mobs are still elite, towers still have lieutenants, generals still have 8 guards, graveyards still have guards.
---
The majority of features that made the zerg a reality came in TBC
---
I'd prefer an earlier version but it's not the 15 minute rush people are claiming
---
Secretly everyone shitting on them are extremely jealous and probably got nothing better to do than complain (Cuz they certainly aren't trying to make better content)
---
Pretty disappointed with this. It's the easy cop out option. Everyone and his dog has played 1.12 AV. They should use pre 1.8 AV. 
---
A) Most people will never have played this version, therefore it has the wow factor and newness. 
---
B) Even those who have played it probably don't remember it so it'll be cool for them too
---
C) They wanted a museum. Well, put something cool in there, not something anyone can see at any time
---
What's the point in bringing back vanilla if you're not going to do it properly? 1.12 is basically the same as retail only without reinforcements. Lazy from Blizz. Hopefully the community can generate enough positive discussion to get them to change their ideas.
---
funfact: Its actually not much colder there right now (on the coast) than where i live...and i bet 2 weeks-2 months ago it was quite a bit warmer.
---
Granted, they get less sun in the winter...
---
It was just one of many ways that classic WoW made people **not results-oriented.** For the majority of the game's lifespan now, most players only do content for the reward at the end, or just until they can say they've done it once and then never again. Literally any challenge or delay that happens between starting and finishing anything is wasted time and will make people salty. And really it's not the people's fault, it's Blizzard's fault for designing their game that way: the content sucks and isn't fun, but do it for something shiny.
---
Classic WoW did a fantastic job of beating that tendency out of you. Progress in anything was far slower and rewards were more evenly distributed across the process of doing things. If you only finished 50% of something you still got like 30% of the reward you would have gotten for finishing it. Nowadays if you lose a BG you might as well have not queued at all. 
---
The fact that lvl 60 was so far away allowed you to enjoy being lvl 40. The fact that Naxx was so far away allowed you to enjoy moving up to AQ. And the fact that the enemy general was so far away allowed you to have a blast just fighting for a single objective along the way. Even if you never got to see the end of that battle, you still made a significant contribution to it and actually got something out of it (I know people will harp on about the "honor cap" but let's be real, actually killing other players was far more rewarding in classic than it was afterwards, where honorable kills meant basically nothing and the only reliable way to get honor was to WIN a battleground)
---
My noob thing was thinking every class needed to keep weapon skill up and you needed to always press the auto attack button. :P
---
I think I kept all my healing spells on the next cycle of toolbars as well.
---
ITT: lots of people who claim to remember shifts in meta from 12 years ago... Private servers have tried pre-1.12 AV and it's always near universally hated. Whatever you think you're remembering, you're wrong. AV was hated.
---
I think Tribe put it very well:  
---
https://youtu.be/jwKCNtAxL8Y?t=716
---
It's utter laziness. Blizz has he manpower to recode vanilla from the ground up if they needed to. They can make old AV work. Higher ups at activision just don't wanna pay the employee who will have to do it. Corporate greed at its finest. We get a worse product because they're cheap.
---
Its not really helping. Most replies on the forums and topics posted suggest people are disappointed. However so far with the small sample says it would suggest people are happy with the announcement
---
Orc warrior for 2h fury slam spec with windfury. So underplayed but completely bonkers in the dps department. 
---
Australian? 
---
I see that OG familiar yellow latency bar haha. One change I can’t wait for, Classic with less than 350 ping 👏. 
---
I still remember my first epic, the wand that drops off the 3rd boss in MC. Man I was so stoked even tho it was shit lol 
---
The beauty of it is that any player on any server can join. They just have to roll an alt and slowly level the rogue over the course of 5-6 months. Gear isn't even required really. 5 rogues in greens on a single target should kill him.  
---
It was more or less willingly.  It only became "we were tricked" when they lost and were abandoned by their demon masters.  
---
The alliance are the bad guys from the horde perspective for the most part.  The night elves are trying to keep them from getting the critical lumber they need to tame their lands, the Dwarves are digging up the Tauren's back yard and shooting them up when approached about it, the survivors of lordaeron are trying to genocide the forsaken free-will or not, and the remnants of Kul Tiras are committing hostile acts all along the coast.  
---
The problem is both sides keep the hostilities going, and there wasn't much incentive not to until they started flinging WMDs at each other.  Well, that's mostly one side doing the flinging, but its for their own protection/retaliation generally speaking.  The situation might be better if they could manage to parlay with each other, but they can't even trust the other to do that.
---
Wait a min, what's this "extra speed not working when faking death" never heard of it, could you explain a little bit more?
---
^^he isn’t wrong lol
---
One thing I remember that nearly killed the game for me was faction imbalance on a nearly dead server.   What a disaster and you’re basically locked in unless you pay $ to get yourself out of there.  
---
How can this be avoided?  Any websites still tracking server stats?
---
I thought all humanoids, or atleast mobs that weren't "evil" like BlackRock orcs for example ran away at 2%
---
1.12.1 is the baseline. They are already having itemization that will change over time. Claiming this is supposed to be just pure 1.12.1 is just bunk. Again 1.12.1 is just the skeleton they are working from. Saying people wanting 1.15.1 av want changes is just an out and out lie. Both 1.12.1 Av and 1.15.1 av both fit the communities conception about exactly what #nochanges means. We just had to decide which side would win out and thats what blizzard did. I think it was a massive mistake but not game breaking like if they did sharding.
---
I'm not sure I'd say paladin is the worst 1v1. I play a ret/reck paladin on a pserver and I'm pretty sure it's one of the strongest 1v1 classes in the game. In fact I really don't fear anything 1v1 unless it's a good spriest or lock. If you want an idea of how ridiculous a ret pally in vanilla can be, check: https://youtu.be/F--7qCNn9e0 
---
Usually in a BG I cut through 3-4 people before they pile on me and I die. I don't have Rag like that guy but Grand Marshalls Great sword and Dark Edge of Insanity. Either way it's some of the best PvP I've ever experienced. And this is coming from a vanilla Rogue and Ele Shaman.
---
Those long AV battles weren't there because of Blizzard. There were there because the player base hadn't yet learned how to play. Once a winning tactic was devised by zerging, the AV battles because quick honor and rep grabs. Blizzard can't do anything to make everyone else play the way you want them to.
---
Since some people are having trouble seeing the message "hidden" here: Blizzard tweaked Alterac Valley fairly significantly almost every single patch after it was added. It was NOT popular, no matter what your nostalgia tells you.
---
You think you’re gonna get oceanic realms? In 2019? Ya right....
---
#nochanges
---
(I’m also in Australia)
---
Probably barely at all. I stayed up all night on the original release date in 2004, plus Thanksgiving break. All that. I would love to do it again, but I'm married with a 2 year old and I'm changing jobs from April. I might get some days off that coincide with early release but my wife would kill me if I no-lifed it. I'll have to eventually find a class that can PvP with easier to get gear if I want to stick with it (or get Sulfuras again).
---
You must really suck at reading. The blue post just explained that 1.12 AV still has strong elite lieutenants, captains, and no reinforcements. It's nothing like retail.
---
That's true, though ideally you'd like to have some geared rouges doing this kind of shenanigans. As somebody pointed out before, any steamer will likely have a huge entourage of people with them. We certainly aren't the only people planning on doing this and they know that
---
For dungeons, yes. 
---
For raids? Not outside a very few select fights, or as a 3rd/4th string off tank
---
Well retail is losing subscribers fast and has been for a very long time and classic is the only thing that brings any passion back to the community so the potential revenue they have to gain by buckling down and doing this the right way is way more than they would lose hiring a small team of guys to remake the old AV.
---
&gt; As far as overall OP'ness. I consider Mages to be classic wows overall most powerful class. With Warriors in a close second.
---
Rogues are scissors
---
Warriors are rock
---
Hunters, shamans, paladins, mages, priests, and druids are paper
---
Warlocks are mushrooms
---
Paper beats rock
---
Scissors beats paper
---
Scissors also happens to beat rock
---
That is until rock hits level 60 and becomes an unstoppable killing machine and beats paper and would beat scissors, but it can't find scissors because scissors are invisible.
---
So scissors beat paper and hide from rock, and that is called balance.

Idunno, I was very much looking forward to being able to PvP in AV, not zerg.  I just want to voice my opinion that i'd rather have the longer, more drawn out matches than a zerg, but I also am not aware of which version of AV that is.  
---
As mentioned above, Stone form is insane for pvp and many pve moments too. Eg. the crocodile in Mara hits like a truck but with stone form you can wipe the stacking crazy bleed effect assuming your pet dies which isn’t uncommon with that croc. 
---
However, I’d pick NE because I like there look better. Another big plus for NE is the very early/easy access to the Owl pet which is completely op because of its AoE threat ability I think it was called screech. 
---
yeah it kind of was, fair enough
---
I followed Esfand on lightbringer and really liked him a lot. I don’t like him so much anymore and that’s okay. If you link your videos to this subreddit you open yourself up to opinions. Your white knighting is admirable though. 
---
They probably do to be honest. Though, when new realms were introduced, they would redo the event on each one. It’s probably a switch.
---
This post is not thought out. If we wanted 1.12 we would want Naxx on release. We want the core of 1.12 with the raid and item progression of past patches. 1.12 AV is retail AV without the reinforcement ticker, its boring garbage. 
---
/whoosh
---
Do you actually think older version would have stopped players from using today's tactics?
---
I followed Esfand on lightbringer and really liked him and his streams. I don’t like him so much anymore and that’s okay. If you link your videos to this subreddit you open yourself up to opinions. Your white knighting is admirable though, keep it up. 
---
yea, they still have it in WoD. This change makes zero sense.
---
Guess those AV quests are going to be removed?
---
Looks like you'd just made the transition from runescape too based on that character name :P
---
I consider gnomes the bad guys
---
Guru the best part about classic wow is how easy it is to just pick up and play. As compared with any other expansion this one is great for the uninitiated. All of the classes are super easy to play at a basic level but, also allow for deep levels of mastery as you get more experienced. Of any wow expansion I would say this one holds the most for you. That being said I am also of the opinion retail has sustained itself on Classic, TBC and WOTLK nostalgia. I am biased to the point that I think retail will die within six months of classics release. So take my opinion for what its worth lol.
---
Where's Monk. Windwalker ALL the way bro GET IT
---
The Trolls are victims. They were living in the forests all their lives and then the night elf’s came through, stole their Forests and killed 90% of them. Trolls were just trying to defend their lands. Now it’s a war between trolls and NE because they want their homes back.
---
Humans same thing. They were living peacefully until the big dumb orcs came trying to steal their lands. Orcs destroyed their world because they listened to guldan, their own fault. So screw them.
---
This comment sums up exactly the problem; you and a ton of other people have no idea what you're even talking about. They only removed one of the damn drops, there are _plenty_ remaining, including every single one that summoned bosses/reinforcements.
---
except it didnt.
---
Actually United States, played Vanilla via Dial Up connection with only one phone line in house. Parents really loved that one /s
---
Mage&gt;Warrior. Sure you can create some situations where a warrior is the better pvp class but over all Mage is the best hands down.
---
It looks like you are right.

---
In the past, new servers would go live with the AQ gates closed, resulting in Blood Elves and Draenei being able to obtain the Scarab Lord title and the black AQ mount, but nowadays all realms go live with the gates already open to prevent anyone from ever opening the gates again.  
---
How  weird. I guess they wanted people to be able to get the title up to 2009.
---
ha it wouldnt surprise me. But then again, with how snowflake blizzard has become its probably just someone injecting their own opinion into it and trying to purify it.
---
ironically though identical quests are still in WoD.
---
Why not keep old AV, but reward Honor every 20 minutes you are in the battleground. So if it goes on for 2 days and you only stay a few hours you still get an Honor Reward.
---
Is it possible to pick the color in these strawpoll's?
---
If so OP dropped the ball
---
They shove the flesh down their throats like good undead.
---
PvP server = Dwarf
---
PvE server = Reroll to PvP server
---
Thot Flips vs Midget Beard
---
Take your pick

It's just a quest, to win 1 av. It was that way when I first got to 60. So no changes for me!
---
too real for the leftists running blizzard
---
An uproar of... joy?
---
As someone who spent lots of Vanilla pvping, and who is looking forward to spending Classic primarily pvping, there had damn well _better_ be crossrealm battlegrounds. They are flat out better.
---
Fortunately, I am certain they will be there. They have said they are reimplementing 1.12, crossrealm BGs were in 1.12, so this seems like a closed question.
---
This is why they've been silent for so long they know they have news that will anger a lot of people. This is just the beginning a true shit storm is on the horizon regarding progressive item stats.
---
Very few people have a reference for that. 1.12 AV is what most people got to experience. The amount of comments you'll see that think that 1.12 AV had reinforcements and such shows that most people berating this decision literally didn't even read the blue post.
---
There's a reason Blizzard changed AV almost every single patch after it was released, and it's definnitely not because it was too popular.
---
&gt; I think it was a massive mistake but not game breaking like if they did sharding.
---
No - but this is slowly turning into a death by a thousands cuts for me, with seemingly every new release of information bringing some kind of disappointment. 
---
Yes outside of the av rep but if you wanted to progress wsg and ab are better uses of time for honor, some people just like having those big battles for fun. 
---
Is it worth it guys?
---
&gt;1.12 AV is retail AV without the reinforcement ticker
---
These comments are starting to grow on me, because you're showing Blizzard you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
---
AVs still went on for several hours throughout all of vanilla and even most of TBC. Most strong elite mobs actually remained all the way up until WotLK, such as captains and lieutenants ,
---
Assets is one part of their job. The entire network infrastructure still needs to be migrated to 2019 model. That isn't fast and easy work just because the assets are from 2005.
---
I won.
---
Get ready because it's going to just be more disappointment. This is why blizzard has been silent for so long. They were never going to be able to please everyone and they know it. Just wait for the first blue acknowledgement that there won't be progressive item stats.
---
Can you prove to me that 1.10-1.12 didn’t last the longest?
---
Warriors have: 
---
* Shield Block
---
* Last Stand
---
* Shield Wall 
---
* Taunt
---
* Challenging Shout
---
* Mocking Blow
---
* Stance Dancing
---
* Shield bash to stop casting
---
* Disarm
---
Look I plan on tanking as a Druid, and even I yield the fact warriors are plain better tanks than all other tanking classes. Paladins were great tanks in BC I was one through T6 content. But in Vanilla they are missing too many(basically all) of the things that allowed them to be viable in BC. Warriors have everything that is needed to tank in Vanilla. The only reason why Bears can even tank is they have insane amounts of armor and health, all the while having some of the things warriors have, like taunt.
---
It’s to appease to the die hard mass that don’t want any changes done to it. 
---
I just want retribution to be viable and allow for more variety in classic, something that most of these people don’t see
---
When trying to please the 1.12 ps neckbeards backfires
---
Whitemanes Chapeau. So legit, farmed for it forever on my UD priest too!
---
I dont know what battlegroup you were in but starting mid BC on my battlegroup AV would last 2 hours at most, it became a zerg usually ending in 30 minutes, so few defended or even did the objectives past the few guys goiing for mines or graveyards.
---
Exactly why I made this post lol
---
People on both sides seem to care way too much how others play the game.
---
Can I ask what else they did to displease you. For me I don't like sharding of any kind. I think it's defenders have no place in the classic wow community and are dangerously close to being a Trojan horse sent to destroy classic. That being said if it's just starting zones I still despise it but, I'll live. Other then that and the AV choice. It's been mostly roses for me. I am just curious about what else they did wrong?
