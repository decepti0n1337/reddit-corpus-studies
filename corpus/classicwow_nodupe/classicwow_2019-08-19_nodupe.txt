It will only take months I’m talking about end game when there is only farming naxx

Bruh wtf is elwinn

Well that sux, but I wonder how long it will be before there is at least one on every server. While I hope it doesn’t happen, I am afraid it might.

Best of luck to you and your friends on Mankirk. I may be there eventually myself. We will see.

Why troll priest over undead?

I was able to find [LetMeCast](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25109-LetMeCast.html) which has been updated for Classic. It's a 2-in-1 addon for both dismounting and casting while sitting.
---
If you're going to call him a charlatan, you'll need to come up with a better source than that article.  Holy crap, almost the entire article is her quoting him, stating "that's absurd that he said that!", but then making no attempt to argue against it.  She's preaching to people who have the same viewpoint as her, and make no attempt to actually think about the points JBP is making.
---
Mage is better than most, especially if you level frost (which you should). I wouldn't be worried.
---
But honestly, the difficulty and slowness of certain leveling classes is way overplayed. If it takes a hunter 10 days played to get to 60 it would only take a warrior like 12 days to get to 60. Yes it's long and you'll die more, but it isn't nearly as bad as some people would think
---
Hell yeah man, at the AV part. I used to love TMV and the soundtrack with RJD2 and that made me a huge fan.
---
This. Why does the brain automatically think of hunters instead of locks? Fkn hunters in my head. Get out.
---
And I’m guessing from the name alone that oomkin isn’t that viable in raids either?
---
&gt;LFR in Wrath
---
LFR was added at the end of Cata...
---
Warrior is just knowing the class and you limitations. Paladin is just knowing where to download your porn.
---
Interesting, I'll have a look cheers. My handwriting is illegible. A friend bought me a old school quill and calligraphy set, was like whyyyy. It looks nice though
---
I miss that about MMOs. It may seem silly to people who never played them at that time but I remember looking at those players with full tier sets and the name of a well known guild above their heads and being so jealous.
---
Yeah no Hunters in pvp are fun as fuck and it's rewarding (unless you get feared lol) but in pve people literally put the pet on aggressive and afk.
---
And of course, there's macros to simplify the class even further. Because God forbid you have to press a separate button for hunter's mark and auto shot.
---
Sucks about scatter shot and frost trap sharing diminishing returns. Not like they were some pvp powerhouse anyway.
---
Because at full health it only gives 10% haste for seconds. So your Frostbolts now go off a whopping 0.25 seconds faster. 
---
At low health it gives 30% haste which I admit is a lot more powerful and can get you out of a tight spot with a quick sheep for example. But I don’t know if it’s better than Will.
---
Its not that hard to understand why people wont relocate willingly... they would have to get all their friends to do the same, and give up their names they reserved on the original realm.
---
As a druid who isnt healing primarily, you will always work twice as hard for half the reward. Im sorry its that way, but it really is. Bears can keep tanking into 40 mans but you wont be the mt 90% of the time, and cat dps requires farming a very specific weapon from gnomer over and over again, simply to stay halfway competitive in dps. As alliance you will have an easier time bear tanking, however. Druids are in a strange spot in vanilla.
---
This is better!
---
It takes too long for a profession slave to break even with what can be made farming on a level 60 character. Even for players with a very long term perspective that already have absolutely everything they want right now it's not a great idea. They could spend their time grinding gold now and then invest it in something like elemental earth that will rise in value later.
---
If you enjoy leveling more than grinding and/or want the alt for other reasons then it can be worth it, but how much you will enjoy the character isn't something quantifiable. For example an extreme altoholic who knows they will level every class to max could first level one of every class to 35 to start raking in profession cooldown money and then use rested xp to gradually work all their characters up to max level.
---
Definitely doesn't surprise me to hear the Classic dev team is the happiest. They're delivering something that's far more wholesome than modern offerings from Blizzard, and it's a product that's already loved, so that eliminates all the "will they love or hate this" stress. 
---
Getting Classic WoW is literally a dream come true for many, so the devs being able to deliver that must feel extremely fulfilling!

Sunken cost fallacy.
---
You just listed all of the reasons why classic wow is a success.
---
WoW was my first MMO ever.  I started back in BC.  I remember questing through and finishing Elwynn, and then being sent to Westfall, and I was like WHAT THERE'S A WHOLE NEW ZONE??
---
How could a  priest get close enough to PS me if i'm a mage though?
---
To a dungeon, yeah, some. Healers strongly dislike taking other healing classes because of gear competition. Additionally theres a lot of people that refuse to heal because theyre simply bad at the game, so people are often wary of ele/enh shaman out of worrying theyll be a burden.

I played BFA at 120 just for the first raid and even on Heroic difficulty, it was much harder than BWL. Even some of the mythic dungeons were much, much more difficult than mechanics you'd encounter anywhere in Vanilla.  
---
The reason I am going to be playing Classic over Retail has nothing to do with the PvE content. Dungeons and Raids these days are much more difficult, much MORE engaging, and honestly, much more FUN. It's everything else that sucks and you're deluding yourself if you believe otherwise.
---

---
99% of Netflix is complete garbage, and 99.9% of Prime Video is also garbage though. Not to mention Amazon is a terrible company.
---
if you are looking to join a 5 man dungeon nobody is gonna tell a mage "sorry we cant take you we already have a mage and are looking for a lock instead"
---
Dungeons, sure. Raids? Well, it will take some effort on your part to make that work, or else you will be standing around oom or watching all your spells get resisted.
---
The classes in Classic ARE the standard. Whatever extra is in the retail version is just that, extra (non standard) classes.
---

Were they charging $20 back then? They were charging $15, just like they are today.

Just looked it up, there is a trainer in Sepulcher. Might be another one somewhere in the zone.
---
If you are in your "proper" zone, chances are there is a trainer for you somewhere in on of the quest hub areas.
---
It will be done classic isn’t getting an expansion
---
I love you thank you

Weak Auras

My first toon was a Tauren Shaman on Warsong. I was attracted to the Native American theme and being nature centric. I saw the alliance as a threat to that natural balance and it made it feel more personal and alive. They are, and always will be, a threat to the Earth Mother.
---
Into the Pagle Pile
---
&gt; Drenden
---
They included one after launch, but only ones that were released sometime during vanilla. Ones launched in TBC or later are not included.
---
They’re the same just different terminology.
---
Your probably right. The major game breaking bugs have been sust out for a while now moreso fine tuning game mechanics and minor asthetic bugs
---
I get the reporting gold farmers and bots thing, as it has a serious impact on the in game economy and other players’ experiences. Why do people really care about carries and powerleveling though? What impact does it have on anyone else’s experience?
---
Possibly the worst raid spec in the entire game
---
Is it covered under warranty?  Flying monitors seems like a manufacturing defect.
---
Yes, but just as a note, Imp runs out of mana very fast, so making him go OOM faster isnt really helpful. Its a bad talent.
---
When did you get hired by Blizzard?
---
There’s no need to actually think about “maybe we should make women be second class citizens permanently” because it’s absurd on its face, this guy is fash and bad.
---
please explain
---
Highly doubt it. Anyone claiming Classic will seriously damage the retail version of the game are being as silly at the people claiming Classic can't be successful.
---
Tribalism is pointless.
---
They are the hardest to level.
---
A mount, within the CD on blink
---
" I look at upcoming releases and they all feel so thrown together "
---
I'm unsure whether there ever was a game more *thrown together* than Vanilla WoW, but at least it was thrown together with massive amounts of love and care &lt;3
---
i play a lot of rust these days. if its good enough for jeff kaplan its good enough for me. honestly, rust will be cutting into some of my classic time more than likely. not for eveyone, but its been my big addiction since retail died for me in mop, and i realized what a waste of life league of legends was.
---
Bro that sucks. Great for ratings though.
---
I agree, /u/DubbethTheLastest, I will edit for tomorrow :)
---
Thought as much. Idk what I’m going to do now. I’d play rogue but it feels like everyone’s doing that.
---
I leveled and raided with a Mage, 1-70. It’s fine. You’re efficient, work well with others, and I found that you avoid death a lot by getting out of sticky situations. 
---
Honestly I bet it’s better than fine. Was way faster than either my Paladin or Priest.
---
Gonna make more? :)
---
If he was missing more than an ear :)
---
Every class that an undead can be, are also classes that orc/tauren/troll can be so shouldnt all the classes have trainers in the barrens then
---
So ELE shaman is really only a char to be made for PVP?
---
I've never played alliance but am rolling it on launch to play with some friends! So thank you for this so much!
---
Yeah it looks a little odd :)
---
Fear is a common and crippling mechanic in almost every raid.  Haste doesn't when in the end when you can get cc'd out of the fight for upwards to 20 seconds.
---
most people in vanilla didn't use addons, no.  and many people thought those addons which were far too powerful were cheating, yes.
---
I watch skarm religiously :D his content is excellent, and I like the fact that hes going to tank as a druid in phase 1, it's encouraging.
---
I like how he's a warrior tank too so he can give both sides.
---
Probably likely. Gehannas is already high and is nearing full.
---
why do retail players feel so threatened by Classic.
---
shit is hilarious
---
They probably won't announce it until after the first phase and layering is removed, otherwise people would be encouraged to level on low pop servers and transfer to high pop ones and really skew realm populations.
---
Triggered
---
 Devilsaur wasn't until tbc
---
Phasing isn't being used in Classic. Phasing is when you have a quest that changes an area in the game world physically (say, Teldrassil being burned down), and when your friend is on a different stage of that quest you are "phased" away from each other. You can't see each other.
---
Sharding is multiple copies of a single zone. So as you walk into a new zone alongside some random person who isn't grouped with you, you'd likely see them fade away because you went into different "shards" of the new zone.
---
Layering is multiple copies of the entire world, so none of that fading away at zone borders stuff.
---
Layering is being used in Classic and it's temporary. We're not sure how soon it will be removed, but we know for a fact it will be removed before Phase 2 of the content unlocks.
---
Atleast it was today and not release day. that woulda sucked!
---
People like you are what ruin communities.
---
That second sentence is spot on regarding hybrids and healing.
---
Mage is only a little behind hunter then lock, roughly level with Druid, you will be fine
---
I haven't, and my friends haven't either.
---
Really interested in the Horde list. I’ll be playing Horde in classic and never played back in Vanilla so I’d love to see it.
---
Level 60 still looking like a hobo. Now that's the vanilla we want!
---
That's kind of the point. Marigold is a shut-in WoW player who is very socially awkward. It's from Questionable Content. It's not a one-off. It's all one story.
---
We all know it either they make a new server for TBC add new content but keep level sixty or do nothing it’s not hard to process that
---
What is VC? Voice Chat is pretty easy to get and difficult to kill. Unless you mean DDOS.
---
Whoa look at Mr Moneybags over here and his widescreen
---
This guy is completely braindead. He has no real reasons or facts to back up any of his claims
---
It's basically like the first iteration of LFG tool they implemented for TBC. People couple post their group or themselves and then others look them up. 
---
I think people are over reacting big time on this one, the good thing about classic isn't the fact that you have to spam channels to find people for a "community" feel, once you all make your way to the dungeon you have to coordinate pulls and work together more. I'd probably download it, finding groups any way you can is important - pretty easy to find 5 mans as a resto shaman though.

Not doing a full BRD run is not the same thing as not running BRD. If you can clear the end, the beginning has no value, so you skip it. If you can't, you can't do a full run. No need to spend four or five hours clearing a dungeon when you can get what you need in one.
---
Yes. 
---
I am talking about like. 
---
People who main classes that weren’t introduced until later.  (Death Knight, Monk, Demon Hunter). 
---
Or they main a race that hadn’t been implemented yet. (Any other than the original 8)
---
As well as people like me, who main a race/class combo that just wasn’t available back in the day. 
---
So like. People who main Tauren priests/paladins, Orc mages, Troll warlocks/ druids. And so on and so forth. 
---
Since we won’t be able to duplicate those characters in Classic, I was curious to see what people are doing instead.
---
If you plan on just taking straight 1v1s all the time, probably Druid, tauren i guess since Paladin is a slightly worse matchup than Shaman
---
Depending on how crowded it is where you are questing, multi mob tanking will give you more mob tags so you aren't fighting over drops for as long.
---
Google a guide and you will find tons of  info
---
It's patch 1.12, right? All of the classes were easy to level by then.

ELO Hell systen GOOO!!
---
How squishy rogues are while leveling absolutely shocked me back in the day. It was one of the last classes I tried out and based on my experience at 60 I expected them to be super powerful while leveling but that wasn't the case at all.
---
Doubt they are crunching, I mean why? To solve a couple more hunter bugs?
---
Whitemane is chilling
---
Why make finding groups more difficult than it needs to be?
---
To be fair, it was a little small. Hilarious nonetheless!
---
Thanks for the detailed response. I think all of this has led me to Warlock. Priest was my original main and I think I’ve just been having a hard time about potentially switching. I think Warlock will do much of what I like about SPriest but provide me with more options in all avenues of the game.
---
And holy priests have dps'ed an entire MC and more also...
---
Please have the original into to vendor trash!
---
If you haven't Google it yet it means a character stuck at the top end of a battleground level group and has the best gear for that level.
---
Almost missed that LOL
---
Layering = multiple versions of the same server
---
Sharding = multiple versions of the same zone
---
Have you thought about waiting for the Alterac Valley wolf? It was the poor mans solution. Would save you a ton of grinding though.
---
The guy saying “all this work could have been used to fix real wow” is not wrong, but the current developers don’t know how to fix real so there goes that argument.
---
I mean in ff8 you had triple triad and it had cards based on characters you were in game fourth wall breaking
---
When WOW came out, I decided to buy Everquest 2 instead.  Their launches were only a week apart.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But now is my chance to do the WOW thing and I decided I'll play hunter.  It's interesting seeing the memes and jokes from people on this sub.  I have like no awareness of what it's talking about.  I"m guessing from this leveling hunter is easy?  
---
Surely all of WOW is pretty easy compared to what games were before wow.  I played EQ2 50 hours a week consistently month-after-month and still didn't hit cap.  If I remember right, it was less than 200 hours to get to cap in WOW back in the day.

Faction rivalry was the strongest between Vanilla and the end of ICC.
---
Who downvotes every comment?
---
Alliance is lucky in that both Dwarf and Night Elf radials are "nice to haves" and not "must haves". The choice is yours. 
---
The +8 agility by playing a Night Elf is obviously the go to for min-max builds - but remember that is (almost) completely meaningless unless you have the absolute best gear. 
---
You may even get more real use out of the +5 gun skill as a Dwarf. You'll hit an enormous amount more shots over the course of your leveling, thus speeding it up a bit and smoothening the experience. 
---
(Assuming this is for a hunter based on your icons)
---
Ye man, I'm thinking the same thing.
---
Ok I'm back on the druid train lol.
---
Right. Not exactly a massive undertaking.  I get having a name preference and all of that, but it seems a bit excessive to call it jumping.  lol
---
It matters in MC and BWL, after that hunters are literally useless besides Tranq
---
I never thought ML would be necessary for an UBRS run
---
Things will be different this time around
---
No changes.
---
They are both good. Troll's shadowguard can stun and has multiple charges. Tri spec is extremely strong at everything in pvp. Something like this. You can heal, kill people and have utility.
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGscZbhtZVMgz0t](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGscZbhtZVMgz0t) 
---
Undead has something that can stun but it's much less damage and only one charge. Undead has devouring plague which is super strong against everything but dwarfs who can immune it. 
---
Priest has a mini ranged mortal strike debuff (20 percent on enemy healing) which is very nice and again that is nice utility if a warrior isn't around. 
---
Both are extremely good and you can debate back and forth. Alliance is a much easier choice. Dwarf or go home.
---
What's the original context of this photo?
---
yeah rip me

Love this so much. The music is one my favorite parts of this game.
---
Also, Octale and Hordak vs The World?
---
it should be dead flat and empty, but i'm also curious if anyone ran out there to verify that.
---
its the final patch of WoW so I would assume everything is there that was there when Naxx was done.
---
I remember this as well. I think it should just be a free action to swap talents. Just have to be in a neutral city or something.

I thought the same, then on groups day 3 I got into temporary contact of my guild leader of vanilla/bc (I was 16 ish?) who I definitely looked up to, and haven't heard from since. Boom I thought I was excited before, not even DotA is enough now
---
Undead racial allows you to counter other warlocks effectively in PvP to the point where they are the best race for warlock v warlock (succy charm and fear) , helps against other common class fears you’ll see often (priest / warr) and any player who brings magic dust to a fight which is an easy pvp consume to farm. 
---
I think will of the forsaken is very useful in PvP 
---
It comes down to playstyle. I think the rng factor of having a 25% (30% really) chance to resist stuns passive might help me in overall more situations but it gives me less control. 
---
At the same time monitoring WotF and trying to save it for the right situation in a BG takes awareness to be done right and well. Seeing who on opposite PvP team has a fear or is a warlock, seeing their role in the PvP group (flag support, healer , defense) knowing when that pesky warrior running the flag will have his intimidating shout up again , if the warlock on the other team is destro meaning they will have succy out 90% of bg, etc. 
---
You can go several fights without orc stun resist kicking in but it can also save your life and make your opponents scream in rage, esp if they had the open 
---
WotF has a high skill ceiling and if that is appealing to you go for it. You’ll be in good shape for lots of situation where you’re in control. 
---
Not to mention that it’s a dps boost for pve fights where the boss fears you. 
---
Orc is less maintenance for the same kind of highs as far as powertnful warlock moments go. 
---
Go with whoever u think looks coolest 
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if I switched back to undead this week lol 
---
WotF also allows you to
---
But how would i get cc'd except for by a lock maybe, and even then I have counterspell.
---
Being wrong an having an opinion are different but what would you know about that
---
Can we get some more doubt posts? I want to breathe this all in over the next year as a daily supplement.
---
They also think that making many servers initially is a bad idea, probably because it would lead to dead servers needing mergers. I don’t have experience getting merged so I can’t say from experience if that’s a bad thing too
---
Not really. Even if you're on a PVP server, the starting zone won't flag the lowbies for PVP unless they opt into it. If you don't wander into Western Plaguelands, a lowbie won't have to deal with a PVP zone until Hillsbrad... where you have the constant Tarren Mill vs Southshore war going on 24/7.
---
I’ve narrowed it down to two, my go to priest, who I have played every expansion since TBC or my promise to myself to run a mage.
---
Lots of those groups died to MC a lot and couldn't beat BWL for a while... 
---
Your bar is lower than the floor.
---
I agree with you. Of course it’s a part of the game. Grinding mimics the real life results of practicing something to become better. Somewhere a long the line games gave up on this common ground with the irl.
---
Wife wants to play priest and I want to play horse this time around. Thanks for the information.

I plan on playing a tank warrior endgame with a bunch of friends, how should I level? Level with one hand and shield with talents in prot, or level with two hander with talents in arms and respec at 60?
---
Unpopular opinion: world PvP is overrated 
---
90% of the time it’s one player prepared, vs one who isn’t, on top of that, the one who’s prepared can decide to only pick good matchups
---
It's mainly about mitigation and the inability to become uncrushable as a druid. As far as instance tanking goes, you'll be just fine. Druids are great raid  off tanks and can be good main tanks as long as stuff doesn't critically hit and one shot you.
---
I plan on druid tanking :) I love tanking dungeons but never like the responsibility of main tanking a large raid so it's perfect!
---
Lol. Still mad?
---
No plans yet but it's a possibility.
---
The worst spec/race combo in the game for levelling and pvp would be human protection warrior.

Dumb ass kid.

This is accurate. You're going to resist almost 1/3 stuns as an orc.
---
Pets don't scale with the hunter's stats in vanilla...
---
Never level as prot.
---
You will however, be called up to tank while leveling.  This still does not require a prot spec.
---

Yeah this is just awful.
---
LotR for the 297th time.
---
But it's 2019 indeed, so LotR will be supplemented with GoT.
---
Again, just because you think its right, doesn't mean its right. Enjoy being killed by multiboxers though!
---
Don't level as prot - you can tank dungeons just fine without prot talents.
---
Hemo is unnormalised and it is very important you have a decently slow weapon. Offhand comparatively doesn't really matter much, but fast for more poison procs is the general idea.
---
Easy 36/40 was a blessing and a curse.
---
Thank you. I'm not up to date due to overtime at work, but I need to catch up on current events obviously.
---
You actually can, since mobs in starter zones move at 90% speed.
---
Seems like a high risk venture!

I actually took the 28th off specifically because I figured Tuesday would be a shitshow.
---
Alright
---
Not really, no.
---
If you like the aesthetic then go for dwarf.  You’re going to look at it for hours on end might as well enjoy it.  Also listen to it if you play with sound.  
---
If you’re min maxing the shadowmeld has really good utility to get out of combat.  The pve implications are less since you have feign death
---
In modern WoW your gear doesn't take damage from falling so if we where wiping on a boss it was cheaper to just run off the edge
---
I didn't know Vanilla had farming as a profession. Where do I get gold seeds?
---
It's been posted in the past but with all the new people I figured it was worth sharing again. Defcamp &amp; Melderon have some great guides/videos on their channel. (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGm8RmKIW0EF1RfmNFVr2-Q), Go check them out while you look for for something to do before classic drops.
---
Uncle Rico is that you?
---
Good idea - I guess if I can't make my mind up I'll flip a coin
---
I believe there is. It works the same way as shadowmeld. Might not be engineering tho, I'm not sure.
---
I'm not saying that others have to share my opinion on what is right and wrong. I'm simply announcing what my opinion is so blizzard knows. And I won't be killed by multiboxers lol.
---
I really can’t remember.. (I was a rogue)..a ranged class getting the jump on you is always a pain. But nothing is really going to apply to only rank 14s. 
---
I assume you are asking because of the more pvp being done. But damn, during my grind i cannot remember from that many years ago.
---
My favorite QC Couple. Martin and Hanners were supposed to be a thing though. I was disappoint.

And then again for the double sack shield haha

---
Oh you only have to kite a mob for a minute or two, and you die if he gets within 30 yards.
---

---
Nice opinion but no
---

---
Sweet! I have a bunch of clips I'm holding off from using
---
No cause the mobs run toward you and you take damage for a very low damage, higher cost spell. Use wrath as much as you can before they get to you and then hit with your queued up attack into a moonfire
---
Totem management. I didn’t have the patience, not until all 4 could be dropped at the same time.
---
If you are serious about this, save your gold for the Warden Staff instead of your mount, be prepared to level engineering to craft one item then drop it for leatherworking and skinning or enchanting again. Be prepared to grind pvp until your eyes bleed for pve gear. Feral is a lot of fun and a lot of work. Remember respecs cap at 50g and that's a lot of money.
---
Your dps will never be sky high but you will add a lot to a raid dps. You will never out tank the warrior MT but you will be better than most OTs. You also bring innervate and battle rez. Feral is good but not for the faint of heart.
---
I use to have to heal MC for another smaller guild and be paid in cores. It took me months to get enough for the gear I needed to craft. Just remember that.

Maybe not simple, but Alliance or Horde? 
---
I have no friends that I'm playing with, so that doesn't factor into the decision.
---
 I plan on playing a Druid, and I while think that Taurens themselves are badass, I think they don't always look very cool in end game gear, and also I have a slight issue with their slow movement speed. I think night elves look badass, but are less badass inherently. They look really cool in gear and animations, though.
---
Also, I have read that Alliance, because of the lack of Shamans, take more resto druids on raids. 
---
That being said, I am worried about overpopulation of a server(playing on Stalagg) by the horde, as that happened in Retail in recent years.
---
Any guiding advice?
---
I doubt you have an understanding of the original system you so badly try to tear down, can you give us a two sentence summary of the system in place so we can theorize replacements?

There's also the fact that gnomes force the (already bad) armor textures onto a tiny area.

There’s a really limited about of servers. I chose Pagle as well because it was a medium pop (at the time) server that seemed clear of streamers, large online forum populations etc. 
---
Kinda feels like I’m going to play on Pagle for a few weeks, see how much I like my class, faction, etc and then pick my actual server when I find out how every server ended up.

---
Layering has a set cap of players per layer and a new layer is only created with more players logging in.
---
Sharding is based on how many players are in nearby area and an near infinite amount of shards can happen in one small area if there's enough players. 
---
Big difference I'd say.
---
Someone somewhere complained.

---
This video is on vanilla tho. Granted it's a pserver
---
spriests will romp you
---
This is *extremely* helpful, thank you so much.
---
So layer is like big shard. Makes sense. To be honest I am a bit scared seeing all the 'fading away' of players and nodes/mobs in the youtube video, but that was beta so hopefully it's not like that.
---
Whole big reason many don't like retail is because of this hopping shards.
---
We will find out in a week! Can't wait I am dying from waiting.
---
That's why he's using Feign Death before Shadowmelding
---
&gt;So like 8-10 hours? Wow tough challenge
---
No chance you find a full party of 17-20s in only 8 hours /played
---
Yeah, porn stars do suck. ;)
---
Frost DK going frost mage here.
---
Layering is the exact same tech as sharding. They likely just allocated more resources to each shard/layer.
---
I wouldn't worry unless the ratio is worse than 60/40. 
---
As for higher demand for resto druids on alliance, keep in mind that alliance has paladins which also heal.
---
I’m not a lawyer and am not giving legal advice so I use the words “may” because I’m sure there are situations where they may be engineers and under certain laws they may be exempt from overtime pay. 
---
However many employers are ok with the salary employee leaving early the following week to make up that time. It may or may not be legal so there’s no definitive answer by me.
---
Just play it, it is well worth it!
---
True - but shadowmeld just seems so fun! I’m worried I’ll feel like I’m missing out when I see other hunters stealthed in the flag room
---
Best answer EVER!
---
Nearly everyone with PS experience would say feral tanking is more viable than feral dps. If you're talking about actual vanilla, cat dps was not a thing at all - they didn't even use wolfshead helm at 60.
---
I’d wager that most people that are interested in vanilla aren’t even playing retail. The sub numbers are lower than ever to the point where they don’t release the count anymore. The games are so different now. Most of us are waiting in the wings, having already quit years ago when the game drastically changed.
---
how?
---
Thanks for such a detailed reply. That's along the lines of what I was thinking. In the end, I think I may stick with undead because I think they look amazing and also I do like the concept of not worrying about my own class as much. Also, it goes well with my name.
---
I figured Orc would be one less thing to worry about, which as you mentioned has it's pros, but it's pretty close overall.
---
Appreciate your time!
---
Well you’ll be using a bow or xbow, so you’re not gonna get the whole ‘dwarf with gun &amp; white bear’ aesthetic for too long. In terms of class differences, its shadowmeld &amp; slightly higher agility VS stoneform and cold rez. I’d imagine the stone form puts dwarf on top in PVP. 
---
That being said it’s hard to imagine a race choice that has less impact than these 2. Doesn’t really matter at all which you go in terms of viability. I’m probably gonna play a night elf hunter because I like the way it looks more, as well as the starting zone, plus I love shadowmeld. But I would just as soon make a dwarf warrior over elf for different reasons.
---
splitting hairs over vocabulary, you get the gist
---
It's 10 percent speed at decent health. It's only fast at low health and when you are at low health on a mage you are resetting with poly and eating/drinking or bandaging. You aren't going for swifty one shots and you might not even have the shatter available to do so as you don't have a second (pet) nova in Vanilla. In WOTLK Beserking is a flat 20 percent at any health. Also some beast bosses where they do 5 percent more dmg. It's just really strong in PVE. In PVP in WOTLK Human mage is the best though. Double trinket is just broken.
---
Fair  enough, but maybe someone had a look before it ended

I don't but it's not a big deal regardless.
---
To me, the game isn’t hard. It’s just more traditional. Leveling is part of the experience you are meant to enjoy. 1-59 isn’t a slog. Its not something you feel is in the way and once you get past it “the game really starts”.
---
Some games, like diablo where rushing makes more sense. They are monster kill games where you explode things on screen as quickly as possible to find cool items. Very repetitive. Not much world building. Storylite experience.
---
But in MMO’s you have these deeply creative worlds to explore. Taking it slow and looking at the world around you is suppose to be part of the experience. 
---
Modern resembles more of an action game like diablo these days. Its kind of sad that they monetized leveling with boosts. To delegitimize 110 levels like that is a really sad thing. Its like taking all the hard work and level building you did and just trashing it.

~~Sharding~~ Layering is based on how many players are in ~~nearby~~ ~~area~~ the continent and an near endless amount of ~~shards~~ can happen in ~~one~~ ~~small~~ ~~area~~ the server if there's enough players.

It is big difference as in layer = big shard. Otherwise mechanic is same it seems, even down to shard hopping.

Dire Maul is the only 'added' 5man content, and even that will be in phase 2. Everything that comes after are raids.

Do you guys think orc or tauren warriors are cooler? I can't decide what I want to play.
---
So level as arms, use taunt and generate threat with a two hander, and respec to a more prot focused build at 60?
---
doubt TBC is likely. Then people will cry for a vanilla server all over again because BC makes 1-60 content irrelevant (to a lesser degree than later expansions). Classic for life is the way to go. Maybe an option to transfer to a separate BC server.
---
I assume you mean this quote:
---
“Violent attacks are what happens when men do not have partners, Mr Peterson says, and society needs to work to make sure those men are married. ‘The cure for that is monogamy. That’s actually why monogamy emerges,’
---
You realize he's not calling for "forced marriages"?  He wants society to promote monogamous relationships because they give men a purpose in life, and creating a family is the most natural method of finding purpose (millions of years of evolution push us to do so). 
---
Modern liberalism undermines the traditional family and creates an increasing number of men who never develop a meaningful relationship with a woman, or whose relationships are aborted by divorce.  The direct result of this is a precipitous rise in male suicides and children raised without fathers (who are astronomically more likely to become delinquents in youth, and criminals in adulthood).  I don't know if there's a solution, but there's definitely a problem.

---
Cultists wont come out until AQ patch.
---
Yeah but you get free daycare and have strong unions and healthcare and shit. Someone make takeout food more expensive so we can have that.
---
It’s because MC is easy to tank and druids are far less gear dependent than warriors so they have an edge even as mt’s in early days.
---
Simple question : I'm not sure but I think I remember a time where it was possible to disenchant another player item by letting him put it in the "not to be exchanged" slot of the trade UI.  
---
Was this a thing at any time in WoW history ? Will it be in wow classic ?
---
Another thing worth noting about the only precedent for classic is that the OSRS playerbase plummeted for a couple years until updates started coming at a regular pace, many of them directly inspired by content added to RS2/3 post 2007.
---
I never played vanilla so I have little skin in this game but I'll be very interested to watch it unfold to see if nostalgia is strong enough to sustain a game as is.  
---
My bet is on Classic holding steady instead of seeing that immediate plummet OSRS saw.  RuneScape was big but I don't think it ever had the sheer staying power and influence WoW had back in the day.  WoW was fucking enormous.  Like mainstream network TV shows have referenced it.
---
It's much slower than you're used to from destiny. Loot feels less like a random numbers treadmill though, which leads to it being much more satisfying to get it. You end up talking to people more because of how slow it is and because its easier to work together. However, the slow progression isn't everyones cup of tea.
---
This is correct. We will unintentionally DDoS the servers, likely the login server.
---
Im talking "empty zone with no mobs or loot" or "Twilight cultists, sand worms and quest hub". 
---
Not the Pre-legion or post-legion :p
---
Assuming people drink steelies for taste
---
No idea how it is now actually it was an estimation based on how it was when I lived there 10 years ago. I'm in Australia now and get 300 to eu and 200ish to us. So playing anywhere but oceanic servers is pretty poor for me.
---
Blackout only has a 10% chance though?
---
It's ABSOLUTELY possible. You might need some decent stam, and a tank-oriented spec, but from Ragefire Chasm to Blackrock Depths, you can manage it. It gets a little tough at level 60 dungeons, but they're doable on private servers, where the dungeons are 30-40% harder.
---
Sadly I am.
---
I also remember this being a thing but I'm pretty sure it was not a thing in vanilla. Maybe wrath?
---
Since Legion, I mained a Pandaren Monk, but my original main, which I played from closed beta right up until MoP, was Holy Priest, so i'm going back to that.
---
It doesn't really matter if you run resto or feral. Druids are the least played class and will be brought along with the raid simply because of loot variety.
---
i do what i want
---
All you need is Righteous Fury to tank dungeons. 31/20 Holy/Prot will work just fine and it gives you a ranged pull without any consumables.
---
Make your own decision, but I would just note that character creation can be deceiving for Tauren because you can't see most of their customization from the default "follow" camera angle.
---
Also, for fury orc has some pretty gnarly racials that are perfect for warrior (blood fury and axe spec).
---
I also like a minimal UI.
---
On live I used SUF and Dominos for unit frames and action bars. Chatter is a nice chat addon, but you could try just using Leatrix for that. I used Kui Nameplates but I'm not sure if it works on classic, NeatPlates is similar.
---
WeakAuras 2 lets you fill out just about any other need you might have.

Can snapper charges be used in bear form? I know potions can't be.

World of Lovecraft would be fucking sick, can you imagine Cthulhu just one shotting everybody regardless of stats or gear. I'd be down.

Anyone got a guide for rogue pvp openers, combos, macros, etc?

Nothing was better in the original game than being tops in DPS as a Hunter. For every 'tard Hunter there were a dozen 'tard mages, rogues, and druids. And man, they got BUTT HURT when they got topped in DPS by a Hunter.

I've watched the Curse app turn to Twitch and slowly transform from a mod and addon manager into a bloated livestreaming app. The manager is the only reason I have it, but lately I've had to manually download AddOns for Classic and Mods for Minecraft because they just wont properly support changes. Now on Minecraft we have a few mod loaders like Forge, Fabric, and Rift. On the website you can sort by them, but on the app you have to manually read the mod description and hope it mentions what mod loader it requires. Suddenly modding took a step backwards :(
---
Basically, keep dreaming that they support Classic properly on the app
---
So I think the cenarion circle quest and one other will be there and mobs like the elementals you need for MC attunement but the cultists are on a completely different patch that didn't come out until farm started for opening AQ gates.
---
I think rogues the only class with an entire website dedicated to them. Check that shadowpanther dudes website out

I'd save a lot of money over the next 5 years at least.

Something for you to watch while you're in queue.

Just let people know you are lfg for quests. A healer speeds things up a lot!

Any LATAM to be honest.
---
Briarwood Reed usually is THE item all casters are there for. I've seen ML switched on for drops like Dal as well.
---
&gt; I'd you don't streamline the classes, you can't really balance it well.
---
It is more important for games to be fun than to be balanced.
---
Balance is a means, not an end. Improving balance is only valuable as long as it is increasing fun. If you ever get to the point that you are diminishing fun to improve balance, you have gone astray.
---
Yeah, those numbers are fiction mate. They're just a bunch of people chucking numbers together for fun. If you're rolling feral druid expecting to leet dps in any raid phase you're setting yourself up for big disappointment.

Having an incredible amount of spell hit in the mage frost tree makes no difference? Having trees from the end of the game, post-naxx and pre-expansion at the start isn't inflated?
---
I mean, I mean, I mean
---
Wish they’d bring back server specific forums on the official Blizzard site...
---
They changed various quests in TBC to award more exp. Leveling in TBC is very comparable to leveling on private servers while vanilla was a bit more of a grind. You can watch Joanna's and Varak's speedruns 1-60 to see the difference, although their chosen strategies are also quite different.
---
Using "grinding honor" as a negative point just shows how detached the person is from an mmo. In retail you do BGs for transmog pieces or some reroll coin for raids. The gear that drops from BGs is utter trash and doesn't feel rewarding at all.
---
Its also god tier for PvP even in early tiers of BC.
---
i once got a 24 hour ban for telling someone to go fuck themselves back in vanilla. Was 13, felt like a rebel.
---
Undead are better for PvP.
---
Both?
---
Rogue was easy because of stealth. Shamen was pretty fun and engaging with all the different things that class can do.
---
why did i watch all of that

I already jumped days ago. Might again, until I get my preferred name xD

"pathetic pve" XDDD bro ur trolling = im DEAD

congratz, youre officialy retarded. oh shit what's that I hear a rogue nearby quick open the SM doorrrrrrrrrrr
---
I think op actually meant soul shard by the context tho...
---
Yes, it's a proc. You asked about SP stun.
---
Just look up the list of stuns and that is what WotF will save you from.
---
As a general rule Berserking is better suited for PvE.
---
Bruh take a second to appreciate the irony here.  Or downvote me and plug your ears, which is something a snowflake would do.
---
&gt;Leveling is so much faster in Classic, probably takes like a day
---
Oh dear... Well, it might be closer to 10 times what they think, but at least you can have fun sooner than max level.
---
Because retail WoW is really bad
---
Lock is braindead easy to level while rogue is more challenging and slower. I would suggest going for your preferred class first and then if it gets boring/too difficult you can just mail a new alt your money and continue on.
---
Top fucking LEL at “I bet leveling in classic is faster”
---
Wrong, Silithus PvP content doesn't come out until phase 6 for instance.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=291079/classic-pvp-content-plan-explained
---
I don't know if/when the quest hub will be out. It doesn't say anywhere. I'm guessing phase 4, right before AQ phase.
---
They will 100% complicate it a lot.
---
Honestly you'll likely have made friends you don't want to miss anymore and these people will have made other friends who don't want to move servers so your friends don't want to move servers and suddenly it's an impossibly shitty scenario for you.
---
Get on a server with the intent of staying there. Don't gamble with login queues because you WILL be here making threads complaining about it.
---
This is the best throwback ever
---
You have to get your weapon exp or arcinate or w/e by this time or ... Gross.
---
&gt; the game where the DoT class doesn't cast DoT's.
---
I assume that you're talking about warlocks and raid bosses?
---
That would be a very valid criticism if raids were anywhere near the entire game.
---
Classic just worked, I agree QOL is not needed
---
Why don't people understand this? Blizzard doesn't care about launch day and shouldn't - they care about 3 months from now.
---
You can use any from mine if you don’t mind the bald just. Idk who that is. He just appears in all my videos.

Silithus PvP content doesn't come out until phase 6.
---
I haven't found anywhere that confirms if/when the Cenarion Circle quest hub will be out.
---
I will play moonkin and gank lowbies as much as possible.
---
but orc is the optimal rogue?
---
[This](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25109-LetMeCast.html) addon should do it.
---
There's no reason they can't just have both. Just because so far blizzard has set a precedent that they will delete old stuff, doesn't mean that won't change for classic.
---
&gt; at first there was an option to use the old textures, but the actual skeletons were changed
---
That's not true, you used to be able to get both the model and skeleton. I think it was 7.0 where they removed the option to switch skeletons because they added new animations and they presumably didn't want to update the old skeletons. Then at some later date they removed the old models as well, and starting in 7.3 they don't offer the old stuff in any way when they ~~make animations worse~~replace animations.
---
Run into the Hinterlands
---
Run to the top of Altar of Zul and kill Oiaga the Keeper (level 50 elite). Loot the Sacred Mallet
---
Run to the top of Jintha’Alor. Combine the Sacred Mallet with the Altar to create Mallet of Zul’Farrak
---
Full just means queues. I work from home soo I have time. More inclined to find out the orojected faction balance thwn population.
---
Ah, I see you are a man of culture.
---
Two handed is generally better for both fury and arms due to the general lack of hit pre-60 that will make your offhand far less efficient than it will be come end game.
---
Stalagg will be full on launch day.  Like 10% of the people that are going to play subbed for name reservation.
---
They’ll have to open up additional servers either on launch day, or within a couple of days at most.
---
Me not that kind of orc.
---
If you get around to a horde one, the Jin’athor quests in the hinterlands are a must

The greatest thing about vanilla is it's not a bullshit 10 level sprint. It's a marathon to normal people. Also it requires large guilds and you will get to known the "goods" on your server. Lastly their will be challenging moments. Retail I  let my grandma play not knowing anything and she killed shit never died.
---
Alchemy makes a ton of money. You’ll make a bunch of money leveling if you pick up and sell everything
---
There’s a Wrath behind it
---
The thing is .. its an rpg not a raid/loot simulator. 
---
You have to querst, to level, to group, you play the game, not rush to the end for loot.

&gt;Yes so, I see a lot of people fading away and sometimes players intentionally fading to kill Devilsaur multiple times or mine Rich Thorium. Was any of this part a bug fixed in beta or?
---
You can intentionally change layers by joining the party of someone who is in a different layer, so you can manipulate your layer to find rare spawns and that is unlikely to be fixed. I think they are counting on being able to turn layering off before it results in too much economic advantage for the early levelers.
---
I'll bet you guys _anything_ that layering ends up causing more issues, long term and short term, than it ever had any hope of fixing.

Option all the way through naxx. Theres a youtuber called ebbnflow that you might want to check out. He tanked Naxx for his guild as a druid and does insane stuff in pvp in some of his vids. Imho the best druid player out there.
---
Be ready to farm a lot of Gnomeregan though. Your BIS weapon is a level 30 blue that you need to farm over and over.
---
I think full means full, I don’t think they have degrees of fullness. Herod was probably called out because it was the first one,
---
you're CE Azshara then? CE Jaina? Or do you just have no idea what you're talking about
---
By running towards you? You know have to stand still to cast?
---
That requires your RL to be switched on. When it comes to 10 mans, you may be asking for a bit too much.
---
While leveling I'd go skinning than another profession. Example I'm gunna go skinning and enchanting and use the skins to vendor for low level gold gain since people won't be buying much since noone will have much money and will be saving for mounts. Than at 60 I'm gunna drop skinning for tailoring and use saved up cloth to help me level it.
---
When alliance see am orc warrior, all we know is that it feels like they are immune to stuns.
---
Shadowmeld is great and Night Elves have the highest base agility for hunters. Granted, it's a small amount but still
---
The irony? You are making false equivalencies my friend. Take a debate class "bruh", your reasoning and reading comprehension skills need work.
---
the difference is since gold can legally be bought for irl cash, it's literally just legal RMT now
---
Nice "bug" , maybe your friend is lying or we have a serious problem. I hope blizzard arent forcing people out of Herod.
---
originally yes. then they started to be used in specific circumstances and people started getting all uppity when you called something the "wrong thing"
---
layering is the latest name using the same principle. hell in Ragnarok Online 2 they were called channels

same shit

It depends on your weapon speed what is the best seal. As a rule of thumb, command is better with an attackspeed of 3.5 or slower. Justice is better for faster weapons.

You are an actual idiot.

2-10 year prison sentences being handed out like candy for ddos'ing.. who's gonna have the luls .. a hacker or bubba in prison ..
---
yeah like i would not be surprised if there was a lot of bugs at 60 but its blizz i think they would have set a date that didnt leave them in some huge crush , the dont like rush out games
---
for example that diablo mobile game has been done for like 6months , tbh i doubt they even ever release it at this point
---
I think that scatter/freezing trap DR might make a case for Tauren hunter. Covering freezing with scatter DRs your trap, but covering it with warstomp doesn't. Haven't played hunter enough to know if it matters, but it could be interesting.
---
I was going to say Atlasloot has some limited functionality like this.
---
Hunters have pets, warlocks have minons/demons.  Always saw it like that
---
Right there with you.  Tried on and off since then but just seems closer to a farmville.  Been playing mainly FPS, ready for a deep dive into something that feels rewarding and... I'd like to get some good PVP grudges going.
---
Druids were the last class to get their revamp and didn’t get it until almost the very end of Vanilla.  So there really wasn’t enough time for them to shine as nobody had been playing them as a Feral tank prior to their rework and didn’t have appropriate gear as such until after TBC launched and buffed them even further.
---
Play what you like the look of/will have the most fun playing as, IMO. Sometimes these two things sync up, but sometimes they don't. If I hate casting animations, it doesn't matter if it's The Best to me, I gotta go with what I wanna look at for 59 levels!
---
of course , most people arent sub yet and the few ones we have or maxed out
---
Guy doesn't understand inflation. No point to argue with him.
---
Great find!
---
Is the mailbox missing too? If there isn't CC quest hub content during phase 1, that makes a big difference.
---
I'm also very interested to know if Thorium Point and it's associated quests are in Phase 1, and if the Hinterlands Jinthaalor Elite quests are in game in Phase 1.
---
All of these facts would have *huge* implications on levelling and on pre-bis.
---
I get one of those deep dish meat lover ones from Little Caesar's for $12 and it comes with free crazy bread. Tasty 4500 calories for $12.

yeah fair enough, green power and all that you filthy horde &lt;3

Blizzard has not released numbers so no poll done currently will be conclusive.
---
I can't decide betwen shaman or mage, i know that i can play 30/0/21 shaman on farm raids without respecing but id like to know if i can play pvp mage build in pve raids (progression or farm).
---
Other thing is that shaman max out at tier 2.5 while mage can go up to tier 3 and got a legendary weapon in the end. so i duno if in the long run my mage would be more powerful just because it gets more gear in the end of phase 6.

Download them, move the folder manually into your wow interface folder and stop depending on 3rd party apps for this. Its such a simple task and its easier to keep track of addons and not let updates break your game
---
I feel sorry for your poor reading comprehension.

The U.S. military is responsible for killing millions of innocent people the world over. 
---
These people don’t need care packages. They need rehabilitation.
---
I mean, people like Esfand will get away with it, I still doubt there will be a lot of raiding hybrids tho, maybe if people have stuff on farm and bring in alts or are just looking to fill but ehhhh.
---
It was when I was making my PvP video for sure.

I was always looking for 1vN fights, and founds lots of fun and memorable moments, specially the ones I could win lol
---
You -- win -- the -- day, good sir/madam.
---
My very first character in WoW Classic was a hunter. I remember that feeling still, when i think about it, of taming my first pet... now that pets are given to you, I just... eh. 
---
I can't wait to maybe play a hunter again... except I've promised my guild I'd go Warrior Tank for them :O
---
Projected faction balance is 55-45 horde - alliance for PvP servers, and around 60-40 alliance - horde for PvP servers.
---
Stalagg is where it's at. It'll be heavily populated but not bad like Herod.
---
I plan to be max leveled in the first month. After that I'll have years of max level wPvP experience
---
There’s room for 10 people to simply auto attack the whole time. I really think people in this sub are not putting into account how bad the playerbase was bad at the game in 2006.
---
Huh? The Grobbulus discord channel has been pretty entertaining and good to pass time with.
---
What's the issue?
---
its a meme  spec , you should NOT play ret pally if you consider raiding.
---
Arkinventory and Shadowed Unit Frames are the only major things I was missing on the last stress, and both have had releases since then.
---
AI ill probably get sorted early on, but SUF will wait a while because its takes time to get setup how you like it.
---
Who the FUCK cares about those idiots?
---
Seriously...
---
I leveled on classic as assassination on a pvp realm. Ahhhh the good ol days...
---
This is so true.....Ive seen it first hand.
---
Doesn't have to be Blizzard in this case. Just a community poll of what faction oer server kinda deal. If it exists it would help my conclusion.
---
No. I did it fine. You'll get jealous of the Warriors' armor, but you'll be fine.
---
This is extremely weird.
---
Extremely weird for the cultist mobs to be there but not the Cenarion Circle quest hub NPCs and quests.
---
No seasoning.
---
Well the demons are slaves, i bet none of them want to do the dirty work for a human male warlock.
---
That is awesome and I want one for Eastern Kingdoms as well.

What if they're not in my layer?

Nice Witchhunting

A lot of people in this thread seem to think Will of the Forsaken breaks stuns in vanilla, but I am pretty sure it only applies to charm, sleep, and fear, with fear being the most common.
---
No, it's a different use case. In general, NE is gonna be better at defending in BGs, but dwarf is gonna be better in combat.
---
This!! Retail is super pve focussed, even the pvp. Classic is first and foremost a gift to the pvp scene as shown in the numbers. PvE is not the same experiance and takes away a large part of the game. You don't have to be flexible in a PvE Server, things always go as planned. For me as a PvP player, it's boring and takes away the biggest reward of getting gear and max lvl. Getting free or cheap honor.
---
Your BIS weapon is Manual Crowd Pummeler. Be ready to farm it ad absurdum before every raid.
---
That is reductionist. That is like saying running for congress isn't political because "job". This post is about raising money for a political field. Its real world politics.

Is there a twitch client supported add-on that provides coordinates? If so, what are my options?
---
find a leveling buddy and you will be fine. If your rolling mirage raceway hit me up. Otherwise check your server discord.  As a priest Im actively looking for warriors I can follow around healing while they kill shit and complete quests for me.
---
Go Night Elf female so you can a) look beautiful, b) dance like Alizee, c) shadowmeld aimed shot and more base agility, d) actually look like an agility character instead of a bearded midget with stubby arms and legs.
---
&gt; cross faction raiding guilds etc is a thing now
---
Wait, what? Is this true??
---
ArkInventory is coming to classic :D
---
There will be a eastern Kingdoms one up before classic release.
---
I thought about doing pathfinder bfa while waiting for classic but it's such a drag. Open world content is SO BAD. Millions of mobs crammed into tiny spaces and none of them are threatening. I can play like the biggest idiot and still easily mow down legions of mobs. And the grind is insane. Like 10 reputations to reverred. The insanity is not even how long it takes but how mind numbingly boring the gameplay is. I don't need to focus at all and my char has LFR level gear that was mind numbingly easy to acquire and I'm a fucking destroyer of worlds, a force of nature. It's like goofing around in a single player game with cheats turned on, the power trips is fun for an hour but afterwards it's just boring.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
I did mechagon yesterday with a premade group (awesome people) and our gear felt kinda on the low end for the dungeon and I had such a fucking blast. Took us several hours to do and we wiped quite a lot - was so much fun. And Mage Towers ... challenging stuff is so satisfying. Why do they have to make the game so BORING? I mean the game has many more problems than this but right now as I play retail I really feel this one. There is just 0 investment in the gameplay.
---
Yea there is fun stuff to do in M+s (although I really hate BfA dungeon trash fests) and Mythic raids but the world content is a huge part of the game and it's just such a fucking drag. Why does Blizzard think it is that people HATE leveling and see it as a chore rather than the fun adventure it should be?
---
/ramble
---
Yup. And even a bad [other class] usually brings a lot more utility that requires no input from them. You're probably going to be happy with a bad Mage, intellect buff, food/drink, easy CC. A bad hunter? Everyone will hate him/her.
---
It ultimately helps with when the player base declines. It will help to mitigate dead realms.
---
Yeah also another thing I forgot to mention is you don’t have to worry about having a PvP trinket on you when you pvp. So you can bring 2 badass trinkets with you and that just gets better in later phases
---
Classic WoW - Runescape edition. Runs on low spec mobile phones. Estimated release date - 2021.
---
I'll be patient and hope for Quartz, but if it doesn't end up comin' over, that's fine.
---
fun fact she also streamed on twitch or still does. pretty sure she streamed wow but I forget the expansion
---
Yeah, I forgot the Hunter that had the first badass guide. He leveled so many Hunter's and had it down to like 1day 19hrs. if memory serves. I wanna say Lizzy or something. But, always went Troll/Hunter
---
Seeing all the comments claiming that Blizzard was blatantly lying - with absolutely zero evidence to any lies regarding removing layering by/at Phase 2 - was goddamn mind boggling. 
---
Having gripes with layering is *fine.* Wanting Classic to be the best it can and you having a different opinion on how to achieve that is *fine*.
---
Being a stupid bastard and starting conspiracy theories is *not fine*. In fact, it's fucking stupid.
---
I'll try that when j get my new build for sure! Thanks
---
You’re right - it is a shitty one.
---
Can you cite that?
---
Cause if it's for a pserver it's useless to me.
---
It really doesn't, though.
---
Yeah, that's what I always did
---
But what if I don't get feared?
---
We’ll wait till he’s 18 before we pounce
---
There's a addon that will check server size according to race/gender/class or any combination you can think of called wowcensus or something like that. Then there's this site as well. [https://realmpop.com/us.html](https://realmpop.com/us.html) and this one that monitors guilds. If you do a duckduckgo search there's quit a few addons and sites for various stats depending on what you need. I used to use it to monitor my guilds ranking and member numbers when it was active a few years ago...
---
Ahh. Okay. I think that settles it then.
---
Kargoz covers Classic classes/races so just search "Kargoz Classic Priest" and you'll find his leveling guide and probably some PvE stuff too.
---
Blizzard pls nerf Wind Elementals.
---
Glad to hear Joana didn't aggro any, at least.
---
yeah you could carry a lot of bads in MC
---
Sorry was in a hurry at the time, but the best way to farm revered  Hydraxian is to farm the earth and wind elementals in Silithus. Also decent beast AOE there too if the good spots are overpopulated.
---
I think you're channeling Little House on the Prairie
---
Definitely hunter’s gear.
---
do what now? my HP has always just replenished by itself in raids as far as I can tell.
---
There is literally a poll right on this subreddit. Take the 3 seconds to find it.
---
Time to pull out the world's smallest violin!
---
The game doesnt get good till level 30+ and if you didnt enjoy the ride to 30 the games probably not for you.
---
Alright, this was pretty funny.
---
Oh damn, look at this guy. Thanks alot man!
---
This is what my brother and I are doing. He asked if I thought he should hop over to Elwynn right away and I was like, nah. Try and get to 5 or so in your starting zone and then boogie over to Goldshire and we can start questing together. Not sure what I'll do while he's making his journey, though... maybe farm a bit...
---
Just cuz the military is affected by politics doesn't mean it's politics per se.
---
Furor after LotP, IMO.
---
yeah take the talent point cold blood. your choice is ambush&gt;backstab&gt;coldblood evisc or coldblood ambush&gt;backstab depending upon how much you think you outgear them. then go back into stealth and wait over the dead body for the guy to come back.
---
i dont ever remember calling it VC. that must be new from retail or something.
---
On mobile browsing I can't. Very clear if I am asking for it's existance
---
Didn't vendor his gear and train immolate at level 1 either.
---
Nice support of mass murder.
---
Just decided to swap there, can you link that server?
---
Cool, I cant remember if LW made decent gear, might make the hunter Lw and skinning, thanks

many BiS pieces for a warlock are different to a mage mate. warlocks bis involves a lot of +shadow damage.

If you want to play rogue I would go for it. It isn't nearly as easy as a warlock, but as long as you level first aid it isn't too much of a struggle.
---
They're trying to scare away their own team.
---
oh bot, the /r/wow garbage is starting to seep in.
---
will be fun! &lt;3
---
nope, it was def called VC back in the day.
---
It's different than in retail, you should watch a few videos on healing. 
---
You have to consider your mana a ton more, downranking your spells - you don't want to be using your max level heals. Also learning how to stop cast and the 5-second rule for casting.
---
Picture does not compute, irrelevant data presented to WoW Classic.
---
so what your saying is it takes 6 horde players to equal 4 alliance. seems about right
---
Ah, I see ok. This is eerily similar to one posted not that long ago. Did you see it?
---
This is beyond stupid. But it you're shit at the game you're right. Beyond that you're just being a cunt.
---
I think mining will be too hard to level with you as you go. If you plan to take your time and mosey around until 60, it's a valid choice, but if you're vaguely rushing to the cap, mining will hold you back.
---
I'd vote for skinning. (You can also use leather to help you make some tailoring recipes, including silk packs.) 
---
If you hit cap early enough, I think the AH will be flooded with cheap as hell ore and/or bars + stone (people trying to get a few silver to buy spells and stuff), and you could easily buy it out. Mages are good farmers, so farming the gold necessary to buy mats is easymode.
---
That said, it really depends on what you mean by 'playing casually.' If you're definitely taking your time and you'll end up staying in zones a while, you won't have an issue stockpiling mining materials. (Don't forget to smelt stuff you'll need smelted, either!) But if you feel you'll move too fast to level mining with you, go for something else.
---
Sorry my comment is a little all over the place, I'm tired lmfao.
---
the twitch app is cancer.
---
^ we found the guy that stands in fire.
---
Oh God I have a lot to learn
---
Not sure if this is an appropriate place but do any old priests know the exact mechanics to Fade?
---
Does it remove any aggro from before it was cast? Do you build aggro while it's active? Does it just dump all the aggro back when it wears off?
---
2 points:  Firstly, that is one of the least clever and weakest attempts at trolling I've seen in ages, and secondly, Monday all over the world right now. Stay in school, time zones can be confusing for kiddos.
---
We have moved like 5x and it’s the only thing we constantly babysit in the move. Funny too, without classic I’d likely never rejoin.
---
Who the fuck needed this lmfao
---
just wait till the tauren cant take the window at MC and have to walk around
---
Why?
---
I've main'd tank and heals most of retail, but for Classic I'm main'ing dps.  Though I do plan to have a priest alt for healing.
---
Yes that's correct. However it's massively different in how it plays out.
---
With layering the game should play as if there was 2500 or 3000 whatever the size is, obviously sometimes there will be layer hops if either your layer gets filled or you get invited, but other than that you should stay on the same layer pretty consistently. Sharding is impacted on how many players are near you, so when you go to somewhere popular it's very likely that it will shard you. So with sharding you are constantly hopping based on your location, and also areas will have a consistent level of players regardless where you are where as layering the players will be spread out as if there was no layering.
---
has a hunter icon can confirm stands in fire
---
No, that’s called being a salaried employee.
---
I had a Hunter in vanilla. Everything related to the pet (feeding, taming a new one) was super fun. But also expensive to buy food and ammo.
---
What?  Ignoring what I say and just replying with a vague insult?  Can't tell if you're a troll or someone who thinks r/iamverysmart is a serious sub
---
They are working 80 hours this week so we can play 80-100 hours next week. /salute
---
This is really useful, but my god, the font is eye-bleeding at that size. Maybe I'm just old... Still love the idea, though; this'll be super useful for a lot of us!
---
Then you catch them, and they have natures grasp to root you and kite you some more...
---
Did they change it so you don’t have to stand within 10 yards of someone to keep the inspection window open? I was on the beta, I inspected someone, they ran off and the window was still open. I swear, in vanilla, it either used to automatically close the inspection screen or the tool tips on the items wouldn’t show up if they weren’t within 10 yards.
---
Thing I liked in vanilla is people standing next to you and inspecting you and complimenting your gear but now they can do a run by inspection and you’d never know people were inspecting you. It’s so minor but these are the little things that made vanilla so different than today. It was a great way of building relationships lol, people gathering around inspecting each other n shit.
---
HAH BYE
---
I would do this as my favorite xpac was TBC and would love to fight Illidan and clear BT again. I also quit WotLK before Trial of the Crusader so I would also love to see all the content past that again. Leveling was also really fucking cool in WotLK too.
---
I don't think people are trying to say their impossibly difficult. They are the most self-reliant. They are one of the lowest DPS classes leveling up. They're entirely gear dependent. They have to level up the most weapon skills. Basically, if you leveled up a warrior in vanilla, you earned the right to bitch about it, hyperbole be damned.
---
&gt;That is like saying running for congress isn't political because "job"
---
Top 10 dumbest things I've read this week, at least.

that and the fact that the all collectively felt all loot was theirs cause they could equip it

(Earth Shock)
---
No joke, legend says each is powered by the heart of a Nokia phone.
---
And what happens when you try to merge two players named Gnomercy?
---
Play whatever you think you'll enjoy. The great thing about about classic  is you will learn to play your class on the way to 60.
---
There's only one boat and it goes to wetlands.
---
Also all the additional money you can make just porting people when you spend time in capital cities.
---
You put a filter on for Classic stuff. Also more &amp; more devs of Classic compatible addons release theirs as a separate Classic version, with a separate download link for it. I think it's likely that soon there'll be a separate section for Classic.
---
Shadowmeld does not work in combat, just in case you didn't know.
---
What country does he live in? Thought we were out of tornado season...
---
I've only played since TBC so I'm wondering if Vanilla had any content like the Dragonmaw or Shattered Sun daily quests at level 60, or if it was just all AQ/Naxx raiding? 
---
BFA-WoW is kind of dull to me, so I wanted to go back to the basics. I just work midnight shifts so my play times are awkward.
---
Starcraft I think.
---
I went to silithus during the stress test and it was old silithus.
---
Damn, that is pretty shit
---
bg sucks , world pvp for life

Or walking/resting for hours.
---
Fair enough
---
RIP in Piece Heroes of the Storm. Had so much fun on that
---
You can play deep frost with winterchill in raids however there is only room for 1 winterchill mage per raid and only for mc/bwl. Winterchill does have a lot of wasted talent points that you wouldn't regularly use as pvp mage, so it's not that good.
---
Stop. Don't embarrass yourself further.
---
Classic servers are offline so they are not live.
---
We know what you mean but your arguments for being correct are void since you are simply not correct.
---
Vanilla = private servers, snapshot of old wow content
---
Classic = Blizzards servers, their snapshot and development of old content.
---
Retail = Current modern World of Warcraft.
---
Live = Playable
---
Offline = Non-playable
---
I never said that though...
---
Layering is going to keep that in check to some degree. That said, I expect multiple layers across all the PVP servers to be a freaking slaughterhouse for quite sometime.
---
I approve!
---
&gt; the dev teams work isn't done, not by a long shot.
---
Well they've had well over two years, I hope they're not leaving it all to the last week like some lazy uni student
---
Really bad.
---
Are there any addons available via Twitch that will display simple buff / debuff timers under the player unit frame? I've found [ClassicAuraDurations](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classicauradurations) on CurseForge but would rather manage all addons via Twitch.
---
it was same guild and it was me posting, that BBQ was from 2006 (this is 2007 in this pic), we have done the BBQs every years ever since but after 5 years it dipped abit, nowadays we are 10 people meeting up. next year if this pans out we gonna be 100+ ^^
---
Only thing i dislike about undercity is how claustrophobic some of the corridors are. I like to play with max view distance though.
---
Both actually. Starcraft stands out but it looks like Wrath close to the upper right corner of the WoW box
---
Is there a comparison somewhere
---
Again, you are an actual idiot, like not even trolling, I do bot know how you have survived how ever long you have actually been alive, its bewildering.
---
Agreed.  As. former nelf hunter main from classic, shadowmeld sucks.  Its as useful as a companion from retail.
---
How hard is it to click the right talent, really?
---
I'm not ignoring what you said. You're just too stupid to realize I've already addressed your argument. Bad troll is bad.
---
Are you saying rule 5 means "Nothing can reference anything associated with politics whatsoever? What if someone made a charity stream saying "Hey guys support my Hometown USA's effort for making a soccer field for kids!"  Would it not be allowed because if it's associated with a local government?
---
It's not spelled out in the rules, but I took "No politics" to mean no political discussions.  Not a total ban on anything referencing a government entity.
---
are you dumb?
---
With a name like beardruid12, i have to take your word for it. Thanks!
---
Getting out of the barrens on day 1.
---
i agree they can "easily" get a spot in a casual guild, but tbh, i play paladin (raid as holy) and if you raid as ret you are just taking gear away from classes that get more use of it, not to mention holy paladin is the best class in the game (arguebly ofc) and you bring more as holy. warriors likely wont be too pleased seeing you get stuff like onslaught girdle. but im not one to take something away from people, play what you want and if it works for you and your guild then im happy for you.
---
I remember waiting for the boat to go to Eastern kingdoms. Only to see a bunch of horde in it killing everyone. Frustrating and fun at the same time
---
Bro everyone bum rushed Herod and it’s blizzards fault?? Yeah they released a some what small list of servers but there were still others. You’re just being unrealistic...even if there were other servers people would all bum rush one to get in the “trendy” server. Stop being a drama queen dawg
---
I'm sure there are many that would be super interested in this. My google-fu is bringing up completely unrelated stuff ;/
---
Classicwow.live/leveling/
---
Or you know. Deal with it and save gold for mounts lol
---
So are you going to apply for work at blizzard one day?
---
My first character I leveled a Holy Paladin because I was told that was the raid spec. That was not enjoyable!
---
Nothing wrong with that.
---
"quickly we better launch another pvp realm"
---
I mean I liked TB but he was only one part of it. Just because he is gone doesn't mean they have to go beg to his widow to host something. It is theirs just as it was his.
---
They have every right to bring it back.
---
Like most people, I was pretty bad back in vanilla but I was at least less bad than the rest of my guild and grinded consumables for our failures of raids.
---
So there we were on Hakkar, we'd never managed to succesfully kill him and as usual we have two tanks. Main tank goes down at 15% leaving our offtank a feral and me a rogue as top two in threat without any plate available to take the #2 spot. Managed to take threat and survive long enough to be the one taking mind control so that the druid could properly tank him, had to do it twice before Hakkar finally went down.
---
Was that the plan or did they change it after they realised they fucked up?
---
I mean, you have to consider the farming for money to respec time vs. the 10 days or whatever it'll take you to get your alt to 60, so... In my opinion it depends on what you as a person like to do. I dodged respecs until dual-spec by having a billion alts, but that's my jam. 
---
(Me, at the character screen: And this is my ret paladin, and this is my holy paladin, and this is my prot paladin...and this is my marksman hunter, and this is my fire mage, and this is my arcane mage, and this is my boomkin and this is my restodruidandthisismyferaldruid aND--  
---
My brother, annoyed as hell: stOP MaKING ALTs jUSt rePSec  
---
Me, defensively: No!!! THEIR SPEC IS THEIR IDENTITY!!)
---
So I mean, if it's ya jam, do it. If not? Don't. Think about how much time it's gonna take you to gear up the second alt, and what your goals are for your main, and all that good stuff. Don't forget to also include in your mental list how often you'll want to respec, and then decide if it's worth your time to create the specialized alt of your dreams or cough up the respec fee.
---
Sounds like you’re pro murder. Alright then.
---
Ye, that was me posting the 2006 guild pic. We have done the BBQs every year since but for last 8-10 years its just been 10-15 people chilling. Next year could be 100+ if this pans out right ^^
---
NE Hunter
---
Do it
---
Very nice! I want to get into edit and make some scuffed/shitmeme edits. What programs?
---
How much of a time commitment will getting the rank 10 pvp gear be?  I don't have any delusion I'll make the GM push but I hope the blue gear is feasible.
---
Heads up, Thousand Needles needs to be fixed
---
That is awesome!!!
---
You are correct (:
---
It was hilarious
---
I'm in the Military you mindless nobody, we are most certainly not in the business of Murder, and the fact that you spew this nonsensical rhetoric that we are all murders just blatantly shows how little you are actually educated.
---
Sounds like something a faction traitor would say!
---
This has been my dilemma too. Ive resigned myself to making a toon on both sides so if my friends drop out on me i can play alliance. Im gonna put just enough effort into the horde to stay on level with our warrior main tank. I plan to play a priest and have too much free time so it shouldn't be too hard.
---
Five Thunders kilt!
---
What was holy pally like in vanilla?
---
I played it all the way through BC and had an absolute hoot. Considering rolling rogue this time round because I loved hpal so much in BC I didn’t want to risk the disappointment
---
This is just an exact reiteration of the forum post except that it lacks details like how they reiterated layering will be gone in phase 2.  I know this subreddit is kind of content-starved until release but come on.
---
You save money also by not having to buy pots.
---
This is a really good point - I think after seeing this comment I might pick a dwarf
---
I don't keep sheeping them, the sheeping was just if they were trying to catch up to me on a mount, I have counterspell and more damage.
---
The content of this post is inherently political. Either delete the whole post or don’t complain when comments are political.
---
Ah sorry to hear that, it was worth trying to go to uni anyway. You can always try again in a few years
---
Cope no shoes
---
This is actually very helpful, thank you! I've never quested in desolace before so I want to make sure I hit it this time around.
---
We won’t know until the game goes live.
---
They dont say that because its be bad pr
---
Exactly.  The only use is to defend flags in bg.  
---
Do not look at shadowmeld as anything to base a choice on.  
---
Stoneform has a much higher utility value.  
---
However, play what you like.  Skill will beat any racial any day.
---
I hate gamers.
---
Depends on your server on how many people are fishing and herbing then the alchemist taking those materials and crafting it. 
---
Then the AH has to balance to how much gold people are willing to spend vs how much they have to spend. Considering that this is all newly leveled players they won't have that much - and there won't be any goldsellers either (maybe later since there won't be any Blizzard badges). It's all markets that you can't just guess how much anything is going to cost.
---
I could spec into drain tank. But I love my blueberry boi so much.
---
Shamans also heal.
---
Yep I see that suppose to be 225 thanks for pointing it out
---
Very fun.
---
I'd recommend herb skinning while levelling save herbs and auction leather then at max drop skin, pick up Alch, and grind for elixirs and FAPs
---
No just genuinely curious, how would they get a fear off on me before I kill them?
---
What software are you using?
---
Yeah, mount training and professions weren't a gold sink at all. Nor was the need for potions and other raid items needed weekly, no, it was the talent switching. That's why in Wrath when Dual talents was introduced the whole game imploded and died.
---
DKs gonna piledrive us all just like wotlk
---
Paladin is considerably easier than warrior
---
It is, yet when I said it will be, ive been downvoted. Retail shit bags and p server shit bags are coming as well
---
This map felt small when I was originally looking at it. Then when it took me several minutes to walk from the dwarf starting zone to the first small "town" I realized how small I was in this world again.
---
I'll annoy them to death for sure. Going to Hex of Weakness and Mana Burn every damn one of them.
---
This sounds like something that happens in Goldshire, tbh
---
I was on a weekend morning raiding guild, it was the best!  It got me out of bed, and we were done by 10 am, so I still had all day to do whatever else I wanted.
---
I was a forum lurker on the Blizz forums long after quitting wow and it is satisfying that all the people that so happily enjoyed sharing the wall of no are finally eating their words. It was odd at how much they enjoyed shooting down the idea as if people haven't been loving playing games they played in the past.
---
one has SL SL, plus void sacrifice, the other has a bubble
---
could make a collage and just print and glue them naked pixels
---
Now listen teh fuck up

it's a comfy immersive MMO. A game with a discrete starting point and no end
---
How do you know the classic team is crunching?
---
On mobile. Nothing a few inches that way. There’s no rules!!!
---
Would you rather play on a dead server, or would you rather have a 50/50 chance at being forced to name change?
---
Why is it in poor taste?
---
Rolling  a warlock tailor to make bags for all the nubs
---
Especially now that we all have full time jobs... ok so I was 30 in Vanilla and had a full time job then
---
By having none of those.
---
I found a guild that raids 1 night a week at reasonable hours.
---
What does he mean by “get-aways”?
---
If you paint it, they will come.
---
This is nice. Would be more useful if boat colors meant something: like which boat to get on (North most, south most, etc)
---
Or like black temple and icc but 40 man raids at 60? That would be sick.
---
Gather early and wait till 60 to switch.  Herbing, skinning, mining will all make coin just with time spent.  The crafting professions spend more than they make.
---
The whitemane discord has pretty cool mods and fun conversations all the time.
---
you don't really need Improved Sap 1v1 if you have Camouflage since you can just restealth in 5.5 seconds when combat drops. You do need Improved Sap for sapping when other enemies are around or in PvE.
---
Getting no fish on a cast, basically when you get a fish 100% of the time
---
keep in mind you will have to port your settings from the WTF folder from your stress test character to your live character. you can do that right now if you have a sub, by unchecking a few addons on the character select screen of the server you plan on playing on to generate the folder for that character, then just copy everything over from the stress test character.
---
They won't. The apathetic elitists will crawl from their dark corners to correct me for my impurity and undesired to want a game that had a lot of missing features. The game couldn't support a lot of the quality of life changes back then, that's why they weren't added until later expansions.  
---
Most people I've talked to that played a lot back then don't speak of it with fondness, so I don't know where the No change BS stems from.
---
Bigly
---
Agh.  You have better eyes than I.  Missed that one.
---
What’s wrong with selling carries? I sold 45 minute baron runs back in vanilla and I’ll for sure be selling them in classic!
---
just wondering i am playing private and to accept "The Admiral's Orders" (Horde / Troll quest) through the chest it is one time per person and the respawn of the chest is kind high was full of ppl there back to stress test? it's ok to skip if is to crowded
---
Pleas tell that to the people of Iraq and Afghanistan, murderer.
---
I know it's probably because the zone is white on the map and highly contrasts to the other areas, but Dun Morogh looks HUGE.
---
Buildings are in the wrong spot. Also why is there a cross
---
I love it haha
---
Priest can just dump a lot of dots onto you and let the damage tick away.  
---
You have counter spell, so? You don't have the damage to kill a priest before counter spell wears off. They'll heal themselves when it's duration is over. Or use instant cast heal which you can't counter.
---
By remembering that I define success on my own terms and schedule according to that
---
Man this is a bit of an elephant in the room. Thanks for bringing this to our attention.
---
I like how the hardcore players will be rewarded for their efforts. But for PVE this is insane.
---
Getting to r13, although it is not as hard as 14, is still a frikken ridiculous amount of time and effort.
---
As a hardcore pve'r you would feel forced to rank.
---
Yea I'll usually try to fuck with the mob pack if I see any mage AoE grinding bc it's greedy as fuck
---
Over the first year you will spend 5000 gold on respecs if you’re planning on respecing every week. That will double to 10000 if you keep that up over the games lifetime.
---
You will spend ~1000g on mounts
---
Professions and consumes aren’t a gold sink for the population, because the gold simply travels to another player
---
guess he still had cataclysm installed
---
Illegal danish is the best and only wow video one needs to watch before classic. All others are gray tier loot compared to that glory. 
---
Pure Pwnage being second best....
---
i know that, i'm talking about the frost pvp spec, cus i saw ppl saying that in the first  2 raids any spec works and in the end if the raid is on farm u can play anything.

Without realizing every time I delete a character it removed that characters honorable kill count from my total honorable kill count and so I spent roughly six years at 50,000 without understanding why? I don't like to talk about it, LOL

you might just aswell say nelf passive dodge is better than escape artist for pvp because you will dodge more, same point, other is clearly better.
---
With even a small amount of spirit you can just out of combat regen most of your health back on a warrior.  Most of the time an appropriate level well fed buff will be enough.
---
Boooo, boo wendy testaburger. Boo

It looked to respawn very quickly on the stress test.
---
Fullfil the commitment you made when you started and fight for the alliance. Don't be a traitor.
---
Did you decide this was Goldshire after you'd painted it? it's not recognizable as Goldshire. It's just some buildings in a forest but the buildings don't look familar, nor the roads or anything really.
---
Yeah seems like complete horseshit lol
---
Azshara should also be clarified as the skill requirement is a lot higher in the bay vs inland or the northern/southern coast.
---
I would ask which is more fun, getting gold to Respec or leveling an alt?
---
It just so happens that I am
---
While I can understand the atmosphere for a dangerous world where getting one shot is a possibility, it doesn't add much to the game for me in regards to pure gameplay.
---
That said, I also did think of a narrative explanation for my point as well: As a member of the Horde/Alliance ranks, why should military officials respect a seasoned hero/veteran when they take to killing inexperienced adventurers instead of focusing their skills and efforts on more powerful threats that require their strength and expertise? This of course would apply the most to the people that make a habit out of it, but either way killing lowbies seems to be the exact opposite of honorable from a roleplay perspective.
---
How can the little battery keep track of time to know how to match the server?
---
You are not going to be able to get ahead on the Cenarion Circle rep grind.  There is a couple of quests that you could do pre-silithus patch in 1.8.  
---
Simply put, you're in for a long wait like the rest of us.
---
If I did then we are saying the same thing
---
You're not wrong, when has blizz ever had a smooth launch lol. Literally every expansion the first day or two is a queue + disconnect.
---
Well, that's really fucking gross.
---
True but a resto druid will be more likely brought than a feral. The only thing that could be hard as a resto druid in raid is rejuv not getting overlapped due to different +healing on other druids. But most of it is healing touch downranking. Solo healing os fine as long as no one dies or you have a resser class. You would be more likely to have one om horde since shaman hybrids are better than ret.
---
Expect everyone to tell you a million different things, but your actual experience will be your own
---
torille
---
More often than not 1 drink isn't enough to fill your mana bar. Because at level 34, you are still using level 25 water. And at level 39 you are using level 30 water.
---
You missed the best expac to ever grace the game: MoP.
---
I was thinking it’d be awesome to run try to log on first and get to the main cities before anyone else. Then just have a time lapse video of characters piling into the city.
---
Its more likely that its an inaccuracy, that's something that should be reported to Blizz.
---
A good reminder that we were all absolutely insane about WoW at one point in our lives and clearly we are trying to recapture that moment where we would sit through an hour long guide about bags.
---
Maybe up against multiple, but in a 1v1 or when i have a group behind me i should not have to worry about getting feared
---
Yup. Plus those that were so worried of the "streamer" servers. Half their followers will be done and back to watching by level 10
---
TBQH it doesn't take much for a 12 year old to be more mature than the average WoW player
---
The opening animation/edits to his dungeon crawling guides got me to sub on the spot, completely agree go watch ‘em!
---
Thalnos is going to be the Ragnaros of classic. Streamers and french canadians (they speak english too dont stress if you rolled there) are going Faerlina, streamer haters are going Herod.
---
Not sure what TBC was like, but the 240 hours to 60 is a commonly quoted time for "average players".
---
58/59 still go fairly easy since you can skip questing and instead focus on dungeoning for your pre-raid gear set.
---
Unfortunately people have odd reasons for defending that system. It wasn't good, that's why they changed it. The people who don't want QOL will be the ones asking for it in a year or 2 after classic release because they'll be tired of it, too. Like I said, they changed it for a reason, because people got tired of it. Having QOL changes wont take away from raid progression at all. Neither will it PvP, or Raiding, or balancing. It's not like I'm asking for them to add in Personal loot in raids or something.
---
Alts 100% for me
---
I think no matter what class I play I won't be completely satisfied with my choice, so I'm just gonna play my rogue and not look back
---
Got to Go with what you think will be the most fun for you!
---
I started playing when I was 12 and, like most of us it seems, I didn't know what I was doing. I was in a raiding guild on a really low pop server (Ursin) and we struggled to fill 40 every raid. That was probably the only reason I was allowed to come haha.
---
Anyway, I was in full greens and zero fire resist gear and my raid leader messaged me and asked if I can try to get some blue gear before the next raid. So I went to the auction house and bought the blue gear I could afford. (I didn't realize he meant do dungeons for good gear). 
---
Well, I was pretty broke and just bought random cloth/leather level 30-40 gear just because it was blue and within my budget. (I was a NE hunter) 
---
I remember messaging him all proud of myself like "hey! I got some more blue gear!" and his response was something like "sigh, ok nevermind".
---
As an aside, I remember doing Baron one time with that same guild and really wanted to see the fight. So I stood back really far and didn't dps, because I didn't want to miss anything.
---
I was such a pro raider! /facepalm
---
Leveling an alt 100%, but it's not just leveling an alt. It's gearing an alt as well that's the exact same class as your other one. You can't just transfer raid drops. So both are consistently extra work.
---
I kept arguing for vanilla servers for more than ten years across the official forums, mmo-champion and reddit, and people just kept telling me Blizzard would never do it because they didn't have the code and there would never be enough popularity for it, along with a long list of reasons, of course, why it was "only nostalgia". 
---
Weird how nostalgia supposedly hits WoW harder than any other good old game.

There is no blimp, so you have to run through the barrens, but you can certainly level in durotar.

I'm going Stalagg for sure.

It was.
---
Really torn between playing an Orc Warrior, Troll Priest and Undead Warlock. 
---
Which of these classes make the most amount of money while leveling and once they hit 60? 
---
Also, which professions should I choose for making money? (while leveling I'll choose skinning and enchanting)
---
True story, these are all things to consider
---
I mean there's a ton of challenging content. The challenge is just in a different place.

When you were a kid you were Alliance.

But you are a man now, Lok'tar Ogar brother.

You should be good as your shaman-specific [quests can be found in multiple starting zones](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Shaman/Quests)!
---
You're not betting with Blizzard though. Blizzard is saying "For your own good GTFO of Herod because by even our conservative metrics there will be 'severe' queues"
---
Stalagg!
---
I was going to play horde to hopefully play with some of the horde streamers... But now I'm thinking I might need to go gnome mage
---
My guild has a discord. It's full of a few new users and then a buncha people from our old vanilla guild coming back. It's like catching up with old family.
---
Everlook channel is pretty chill so far, too, although some people get hung up on a handful of discussion topics, which are spec viability, servercount being too low and similar stuff.
---
The military isnt political. 
---
It's literally illegal for a soldier to make political statements under UCMJ.
---
3 servers, 1 for streamers , 1 for latin america ( wtf no realm for them rlly?) , the last one for normal players. Dafuq were they expecting? they are dumb.
---
I really dont get the counting up? Can anyone explain?
---
&gt;btw I'm not on Herod.
---
well I suppose with them investing more time, they have had more pvp encounters so naturally they will have a better idea as long as they can recall what it was actually like. it was a long time ago so they might not remember clearly I suppose but i was just curious.
---
Honestly I'm not sure what to change, I just know the current system promotes absurd playtime. I know radical changes are unlikely so small tweaks are probably best case scenario.
---
Just because you are a bigot against the demographic the charity supports doesnt make it political.
---
Im confused i thought it came out on the 27th.
---
I have a pally toon made also. But I really want to give the druid a chance. Just feel like there's always so much to learn and that I'd have to be aware of. But I'm going to give it the old college attempt. I've always loved bg resto in retail.
---
Think its kinda silly to hate on a class for being easier to level with. There's a lot of things to hate in the world, and this shouldn't be among them.
---
There really won't be a language barrier on any server, however there will be a higher percentage of, say, Brazilian Portugese on an "unofficial" SA server.  However, my experience has been that most player who speak a separate language will do so in specific channels for that language and you almost never even know that they're there.
---
or paladin. :(
---
Likewise. Always something to do.
---
That mage one is garbage.
---
Bloodsail Buccaneers Discord is awesomely fun
---
They said ideally they want layering gone after a couple weeks, but for sure it will last no longer than phase 1.  Removing layering doesn't mean we won't have server queues, even having layering also doesn't mean that we will not see queues either.  Blizzard even just said this.  There is basically still a cap to the number of layers they want to put on the server.
---
Sure, people will fade out and not play as much.  The release will see a huge inrush of players, casual and hardcore.  Layers at the start will be there to help reduce queue times when the servers are getting hammered, when basically EVERYBODY is logging on. 
---
After that, the player base spreads out more and starts to log on at normal times, you'll still see pretty sizable queues during peak hours.
---
My opinion?  They're going to address the server status and times goes on.  This means that some servers will see layering disappear sooner than others.  Some will hold on longer.  If those servers won't sort themselves out, free realm transfers to lower population servers will be made or they will make new servers with free transfers as well.
---
Yeah I was watching.  Stream was laggy AF for a bit too.  Glad he's safe.
---
Thank you for your sacrafice
---
Almost every server at this point is "high-pop" with a few exceptions.
---
Orcs couldnt do the hunter quest in Mulgore on the stress test, so this might not be the case
---
They will  go for the low low price of free for your participation in the Herbalism and Alchemy professions.
---
People so scared of healing lol. PvEasy is even more so as raid heals
---
&gt;The enemy is in front of us, the enemy is behind us, the enemy is to the right and to the left of us. They can't get away this time!
---
10/10
---
Yeah didn't think of that. Whenever I log on I'll just lfg what ever quest I'm on and I'm sure someone will want to group up.
---
that one chicago blackhawks champ spamming cringe
---
Since there's going to be cross server battlegrounds, being on the overpopulated side of the equation benefits you in WPvP with basically no cost other than a slightly more competitive leveling experience. BUT soon as you hit pvp areas, if you're not rolling a group you'll still appreciate that.
---
Healers are basically always in demand if they aren't playing a dunce spec for their class, I wouldn't base your faction choice on that.
---
If it was only leveling an alt, I'd 100% be for it, but gearing the alt that's the exact same class is what is making me hesitant when at least in terms of gearing I can cut that time down in half if I just focus on paying the respec cost. I guess it just amounts to how I want to spend my time.
---
Dude, do you know what a military is and does? If it’s not political then literally nothing is.
---
Warlock, any two gathering professions.
---
Hey dude.
---
I'll chime in to the discussion. What those other person's are telling you, but in a rough way, is the following:
---
You don't need guides because you don't need to play well in Classic. When WoW launched no one had a clue how to play and they still made it and made memories for life. If you mind/max classic to level fast and not read or understand the zone lores and immerse yourself in the world you'll miss half of it. Unlike modern wow, classic doesn't begin at max level. It begins on level 1. 
---
Back in vanilla Onyxia and Molten core dropped placeholder gear in the beginning because the developers knew it would take people a long time to figure raids out. Which it did.
---
So please, slow down and enjoy yourself. Read the skills even though you know what to spec. Your playstyle might be different than the "cookie-cutter" build and other talents are more enticing. Who knows.
---
Yes the eyeballs addon
---
Because we're 6 months post launch and the game has been a huge success.
---
I look forward to seeing you improve :)
---
Atlasloot has a wish list feature, but it doesn’t give you an alert when you fight a boss that drops a piece of gear on your list.  To be honest, I don’t believe it’s necessary tho.  If you go through the effort to create your wish list, it’s pretty easy to take a look at it and see what gear drops that you need in whatever instance you’re running.
---
I’ll be using Atlasloot and their wish list feature.  Expecting to need a LOT of different gear sets as a Druid.  Definitely going to need a way to keep everything in front of me.
---
I'd say it's only valid if you are in a group and everyone in the group does this, otherwise you may find yourself giving in to the temptation to slip in at the lowest level possible with a group of high-level people. Got to earn it.
---
&gt;leftovers no one wants.
---
Ret pally bread-and-butter
---
Foredoomed?
---
I was telling my buddy, whose never experienced a launch or really wow at all, that it was gonna be a shit show
---
Perfect this is my excuse for building every t3 and wanting to collect all the TCG tabards, even though I will literally never not use my tabard of the protector or defilers!
---
Wouldn’t be surprised, Blizz is trying to clean up the mess they made and will go to whatever lengths they can so they won’t look like they were wrong about how many people actually want to play Classic.
---
Yeah!!!
---
Belongs in /nosleep !!!
---
top comment! this is why i would rather play hunter over frost mage despite them occupying the same roles in arenas.
---
Much less time to farm gold for a respec than it is going to be to level a character to 60.  Even if you're respec'd twice a week for 100g, let's say you farm 25g an hour.  That's 4 hours per week, 208 hours a year.  Sure, after a year you make it up, but you still have to 2x gear the characters.
---
I'm starting to lean that way, but 50g isn't a small sum and you'd be paying that to switch between the two constantly
---
&gt;Me, defensively: No!!! THEIR SPEC IS THEIR IDENTITY!!)
---
Finally, someone gets it. Elsa doesn’t respec to fire because it’s better this tier.
---
I’ve thought about it - now that I’ve matured more in my career I definitely feel capable. I think if I see a job opening for them that I like, I’ll try! I’m lucky enough to have some of their recruiters and managers on my LinkedIn so I’ve been kinda already looking through their posts while at work and waiting for launch haha.
---
Original vanilla have high population servers and low population servers, each had their own specific community.
---
Worrying about this will detract from your experience
---
I went full alliance back in the day and I'm going horde this time, and on a pvp server. I'm looking for the classic like experience, not to relive that part of my life. I'm hoping that doing new quests and classes then what I did back then will help remove the rose colored glasses.
---
Nice
---
Realdemon
---
\&gt;  How do you see the factions in terms of good guys and bad guys?   
---
There are some bad actors on both sides, but strictly speaking I was not a fan of the Alliance being racist against the Blood Elves in particular.    
---
I loved NE's &amp; the UD in WC3 - but when it came time to roll a class in WoW for the first time, the UD was far more interesting to me from a story perspective.
---
Maybe I'll do that. Bc I know I got exalted with av before TBC came out. Don't have the exact date of expansion.
---
Yeah. It's a good skill check. Kiting isn't required for progression. You can level to 60 without figuring it out. But if you want there nice bow (and I bet 99% of hunters only transformed it once) you have to prove your worth.
---
But I never mained hunter, and got the bow on an alt. It wasn't rocket science.

&gt;that 30-40 is the casual killer
---
Huh, I would have personally guessed 20-30.  I enjoy 30-40 because of all the different SM runs whereas 20-30 is a mess between Gnomer and RFK
---
Those seem like pretty reasonable guesses for timeframes. 
---
But you are so right P2 may come out sooner than we think, and ppl not 60 yet are gonna get rekt by wpvp duos/trios trying to rank for those sweet rewards.
---
Although for my taste and playstyle, I kind of hope the timeframes for phases and the overall lifespan of classic is a bit longer than that.
---
Then some sort of Classic+ with some class balancing and new content would be pretty mint to keep it going a bit longer!
---
Fade had different ranks/levels. It lowers your current threat level temporarily based on the level. You gain that threat back after it ends. You still build threat with fade active.
---
Threat/aggro management was more involved back then. I remember the huge threat issues we had when killing Vael in BWL.
---
Dude this is sick. I want one for my priest!! Very well done
---
Oh wow that’s amazing, reminds me of Infras mage sheet, which i see was an inspiration for Your sheet. Very cool. 
---
Anyone know of other similar spreadsheets for other classes? I find these 2 incredibly interesting and wouldn’t mind checking out some others.

Or "wait...I COULD HAVE TAKEN A BOAT?"

Then we will meet on the battlefield!

It's not going to be any more insane than any other server with a high enough population to reach the concurrency cap. The only thin that will be insane is the queue.

Perhaps, but everyone isn't role playing as if their character is aligned lawful-good.
---
Some people are playing characters who don't care what their superiors or government think. Others might be out for revenge, role playing as scoundrel who only cares about their own good, or something more nefarious.
---
There can be character based justifications that fit any style of PvP (or lack thereof).
---
Id say go skinning/herb or skinning/mining to level. Mail all cloth you get to a bank alt. At 60 drop skinning and pick up tailoring. Mail the cloth back and level it up. You wanna go double gathering while you level if gold is your concern. In classic tailoring doesnt make cloth drop more. Also doing it this way means youll have gold to level both profs efficiently and you can immediately DE everything you craft at the same time.

I dont think anyone will do 30+ hours on Day 1.
---
Uhhh this is wrong. Fury DPS is basically the best DPS class in classicwow and guilds will take at least about 6 fury DPS warriors if not more.
---
You will not spec arms for DPS. You will virtually always be dual wield.
---
I agree. Much nicer to have activity and wait times versus a dead realm.
---
on classic servers?
---
created 3, deleted none

I'll probably have 1 of each class eventually and I never delete characters, except that one time, I dont know what the hell I was thinking but I rolled a human...for about 10 minutes, I dont like to talk about that day.

Also get me an orange popsicle those are fire.

&gt;It was a really stupid thing to say, as private servers have shown for years.
---
TBF private servers have also shown that they're not sustainable past like a 2 year time frame.  People frequently abandon established servers for fresh ones
---
From what I recall Fade would remove a fixed portion of threat for the duration of the spell, I don't remember if any agro while faded would be attributed to you right away or after fade ends. The only thing is for sure is Fade does not reduce any agro overall, it's a temporary agro dump.

True regarding the parrying, but then feral tanks in classic will have advantages pserver druids didn't have, like being able to instantly switch out of form, chug a potion, go back into form with a one-click macro.
---
Yes, you'll lose your rage, but if you need to drink a potion that's probably a lower concern.
---
What is it you think they do? Who are they governing? What political party do they support?
---
Ok so it just puts whatever threat you had on pause for the duration. I wasn't sure if maybe it came back with like 20% less threat or if you could just free cast while it's active
---
Are we in different subs? I have not seen a post with that title
---
Shortly after launch I earned myself a brief ban because I spotted some erotic RP happening in Goldshire (I know it's a meme, but really!) and expressed my shock in RP form. It was something like '/me gasps at the sight of %t's bare breasts' and apparently that was ban-worthy! If anyone knows how to see a detailed account history please share and I'll post proof :P
---
The only alliance dungeon you will miss out on is stockades and it lame. Horde make groups for dead mines all the time. Also easier access to RFC, WC, SFK, BFD, SM, RFD. If low levels dungeons are important to you horde is a much better experience!
---
Kudos to the electricity company that managed to get them their power back in such a short frame of time... After a damn tornado too!
---
Takes our council where I live in Australia like 3 days after a mild storm.
---
Especially now that it's known the best raid DPS for druid is MCP. A lot of people are in for a rude awakening when they hit 60 and their guildies are giving them the side-eye for trying to raid with a stat stick while they bottom the charts only to find out they need to be farming MCPs for the rest of their life.
---
it can be dispelled, but mages dont have a dispel in vanilla. talking about the 1v1.
---
It is verry huge .. but the playable area is rather small
---
Well since i'm horde I wont be going up against any devouring plague, and who is going to use holy fire in shadow? therefore 1
---
No they aren't.
---
Mained a ton of classes over the years, with my Warlock from Cata to WoD being the longest. My most recent main was my Tauren Unholy DK in Legion as it was fun as all hell, with Blood Tanking also being really enjoyable.
---
In Classic I'll go Troll Warrior Tank. I love complex playstyles (Unholy in Legion had a ton of things to track at once which I *adored*) but those aren't really a thing in Classic, which I'm fine with. Tanking's really fun, especially positioning bosses properly, with you being the wall between your raid and the boss that keeps them from being annihilated, and Warrior's a pretty fun class to boot, with several things you can track at once even instead of just spamming Frostbolt. Feral is also viable but isn't as fun to me.
---
My alt will be an Orc Shaman I'll mostly use for PVP and the occasional alt/twinkraid. He'll be 30/0/21 and zap some Alliance people, I'll basically hop on him if I ever need some variety in my gameplay.
---
24 hours id like to reach at least lvl 25-30.  Also I’m rolling warrior so obviously get first aid up and I’d also like to make some good friends in that time as well :)
---
Lol, yes because this meme is hilarious. Sorry, must be my sense of humor
---
I use https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/   tells you everything you can tame and abilities they have. Levels of the abilities ect
---
I would actually bet 50% of the population won’t be there by the time phase 2 drops
---
You're either a weirdly harsh troll or just a dick, can't tell...
---
Great news, I hope everyone is safe and sound!
---
to be fair hybrids had a rough time at the start, people did try to relegate us to healers until MC or BWL was done. I was one of the lucky ones who got to go Melee in AQ/Naxx but before that I had to heal. Of course getting sick raiding melee gear and pvp toys meant I could quite easily one shot with Windfury but I was one of the few nutters who really stuck with Enhancement, my gear was top tier and everything was enchanted for maximising melee dps at the detriment of mana and spell power. I had a blast but the grind to get to that point was real and the countless warriors QQ'ing about me spending saved DKP  on C'thun axe when it finally dropped was unreal and only because our guild leader knew it was 100% a pvp toy it was allowed and I rocked that thing hard (The proc was too good to give up even for naxx gear)
---
With the worldwide release, the times are all over the place. August 26th 6pm EST
---
By Phase 2 whether my server has 100000 people or 1,000 people, I'll be making an effort to get to know them and contributing to the community, because for me that's what makes the server feel full regardless of the number
---
I am on Grobbulus so hopefully it will not be as packed at launch as some of the servers.
---
tbh its usually the bad players who gank, most times i got ganked on pservers the enemy player didnt have raid gear, and well geared ppl often just ran past me, unless you are lvl 50+ they might kill you for little bit of easy honor. most times you get ganked it will be a fight you can win, if you and a horde player are killing the same mobs for a quest he probably will try to kill you to get the mobs himself, but on the otherhand he knows you will probably wait and attack back when he is fighting with a mob, which lowers his chances of winning drastically.
---
You become better at kiting as a mage. I sucked at pvp on my Hunter because with the pet I never felt the urgency to know how to kite properly.
---
Thanks for the reply. I thought the song was counting down, but still we are not on 5th day of classic? Wouldnt it be more appropriate if this started when classic actually got released?
---
Best bet is to get out of each of your starting zones and meet in the barrens.

You also can’t get your lock epic mount until phase 2 comes out

This week will fly by. I’m in busy season in my industry. Wow classic launch has nothing on how brutal corporate finance can be.
---
Thanks! I hope so - this game has brought so much magic and wonder to my life it’d be a shame if others didn’t feel the same way. Best believe if I do get an interview I’ll be making a post about it.
---
Good challenge to reward ratio that makes you want to chase the grind. You're also way better off interacting with others. All of this synergizes well together.

Honestly I said this. After Cataclysm it was like someone booted me out of my house, remodeled and rearranged everything, and then tossed me back in. It wasn’t home anymore.  I was an alt-a-holic when I got bored or wanted to escape and I love rolling around the old familiar areas. After Cata that wasn’t an option anymore. 
---
I played sporadically during Cata and MoP. I played for a second in WOD (got past the beginning bit) before I let my sub lapse and didn’t pick it up again until this month. The stress test was the most fun I’ve had gaming  in a long while. I am soooo looking forward to Classic!!!
---
Depends on level. If they don't have Shadowform yet, than why not use all their arsenal?
---
Anecdotal but I remember it took like 3.5 months or so? Leveled a hunter pre-TBC. Obviously depends on how many hours and how efficient you are (solo questing versus dungeons).
---
You'll struggle to get tailoring and first aid to 75 at level 15, that's a lot of cloth.
---
If I play 18 of the 24 hours after launch I'd hope to be level 20 at least. Then I can target WC, SFK and BFD on day two and three.
---
If your class could heal you generally did.  It's been many years since I played vanilla.  I remember druid healers being a thing.  I remember druid tanks being pretty much a meme.  I don't remember druid dps...mostly because most druids healed.
---
This isn't a meme subreddit?
---
Well once the game is released we will all be busy playing - I thought this would be a fun daily thing for the community in the days leading up to the release since we are thirsty for content :)
---
Every poll I've seen has druids at even lower than shaman or paladin, even though those are faction locked
---
ya you can raid with any spec but that doesn't happen for a long time. I used to raid as fire spec in AQ gear while helping in MC. Even though i was the completely wrong spec I still did most damage on Rag specced as fire. That said though this wont happen til the very end of the planned phases and at that point why would you even raid MC when AQ or Nax is out? I did it in vanilla just to help out pubs and fellow guildmates alts and that's why I didn't respec.
---
Undead for PvP all day.
---
90% of reddit is "original content" lol
---
yeah, i wish undead faction counted as actual undead, but that would be too good for paladins, but great for rpg.
---
Was fishing a thing in vanilla? As in there was a demand for fish? I can’t remember at all.
---
His was a huge inspiration yeah. Druid and mage is all I know of.
---
I was a GM.  I wish I could have the job with the pay I have now.  Best job ever.  Blizzard even covered half the cost of the drinks in the vending machines, so my caffeine addiction was only half the cost!
---
Horde has worse leveling zones though.
---
I made this mistake for my first character, and honestly druid will feel like jack of all trades master of none after you have sunk all the time into maxing it out.  Each spec is just a weak version of warrior rogue mage priest, so I feel like a lot of biased people will want you last for dungeons unless you have really good gear (not a lot of leather caster gear) and know what you're doing. I did balance up until 40 and then feral rest of the way.  you run out of mana really fast as balance and then you're just SoL and will auto attack as your health dips down.  You're a mage without the food and teleport ability, or utility of slow, sheep, and frost novas. i picked mage as my 2nd toon and wished it were my first. So if you have an idea of a playstyle you want to play, such as magic casting range damage dealer, go mage or lock instead.
---
Not too bad leveling a mage in classic.  Keep in mind mages get portals for fast travel and free food and water.  A lot of people forget how much easier they made world travel since vanilla.
---
people don't understand that the honor grind to get anywhere substantial (Rank 11-14) was a full time job after R10. You could casual to R10 but then you hit the big boy leagues and the grind went through the roof. 
---
To get rank 13 on my server I had to play 12-14hours a day, the majority spent pvping with pre-made teams. 
---
I don't regret it but the grinding honor part is a frank understatement!
---
Looking at a tauren feral for casual raid tanking, and had 2 questions:
---
1. Is a HoTW spec best for raid tanking? I've got a decent guild of old friends,  so i'm not worried about being pigeonholed into healing and want to optimize my raid tank/dps as well as be a very efficient 5 man tank.
---
2. For professions,  I read leaning enchanting/herbalism- mostly for the mountain trinket and general money making.  I keep seeing engineering suggested but it seems mostly for pvp advantages.  Thoughts on profs?
---
So this very clearly violates rule 5. Are you going to take this down or what?
---
I dont know. But it's pretty industry wide that most game devs crunch just before release of any title.
---
Yeah and people who want to make things as easy as possible can limit what classes they allow while those who like to challenge themselves can see how far they can get with meme specs.  Who gives a shit?
---
Only way to make some of the best flasks, elixirs, and potions was with fish.
---
Like Flask of the Titans for tanks needed it. Plus 15 stamina from Rumsey Rum which is a chance from any fishing pools, but best chance is in wreckage/debris type I think.
---
I recommend just meeting in barrens as well. The travel time for you to get to durotar isnt worth it imo
---
The one that started it all
---
I'm not taking it serious lol I made one comment that apparently bothered you
---
The time commitment isn't really the raid itself, since you can find a schedule easily that fits you. It's more like farming all those consumables and getting the stuff for the World Buffs, or you constantly gold farm and buy everything off the AH. The hardest part is getting 40 person and having a core team without drama getting into the way. If time is a concern I recommend rolling on a Normal server, having control over when to PvP is a huge time saver, although it has some drawback, if a grind spot or world boss is occupied, you can't really do damn about it, but it goes both ways.

It was best to get the divorce before classic comes out, smart man
---
Decent early but scale poorly as your pet never improves.
---
Not as "though"?
---
Virtually every single person in that link agreed it was toxic unhealthy dysfunctional bullshit.
---
Skilled hunters will have 0 difficulty getting into raids at any point in Classic's timeline.
---
If you double loot everything using rogue's pickpocket, you will have enough gold for a mount at 60. You can also avoid a good bit of unwanted danger using rogue's stealth, and rogues are amazing at murking not-so-great-pvp'ers of the other faction while leveling.
---
Premiere Pro. Love it.
---
I don't understand your question, respec costs are ancient and before 1.11 they never decayed either
---
I'm planning on doing the same deal with hpriest. Any suggestions?
---
Premiere pro. I definitely recommend it.
---
I played an Enhancement shaman, it was my thing. I could still tell you my proc rate - 27% if the addon I had tracking it for ages was to be believed. And I think it's right. 
---
Even though Winfury could no longer proc off itself , it could still proc off 1. Storm-strike and 2. Hand of Justice (i was still using this trinket in Naxx for a reason!) plus one or two very niche items like edward the odd 
---
Hence why Storm Strike was for real mens
---
What was your name?
---
I tried a Tauren and I just can't get around how big they are. Too used to playing small Undead characters that I couldn't stand it and would ue Deviate Delights or Noggenfogger almost all the time. It was partly just not being able to see in dungeons and feeling blocked all the time, but also the animations were kind of bleh. The aoe stun was really handy, expecially in dungeons, but I would now pick an Orc over Tauren partly due to the animations and size.
---
Wait a minute...
---
Not really. An average player on druid would beat out an average mage in leveling speed, but a seasoned mage would beat out an average druid. Both are fast levelers.
---
Maining a human Paladin at 60, who I will be leveling only when my girlfriend is available to play (so like 2 hours a day, weekends longer, some days off). 
---
So that's going to leave me with the opportunity to make an alt that will have meaningful impact on how I play my Paladin, farm gold, etc. I'm thinking herb/alch on my Paladin, for consumables and decent gold making. For my alt, I'm thinking about a Warlock who would have tailoring (both for itself and also funneling off-set to my main). 
---
Does this seem fairly ideal? I know hunters are the go-to farming alt, but Warlocks compete in that field too. I was considering tailoring on my paladin but that doesn't seem of much benefit.
---
It's fun.  It can be thankless but so was tanking.  If you really want to stand apart from the crowd...seriously don't stand in fire.  It's ridiculous how many casters will just stand in the fire and be totally clueless about their surroundings.
---
Mage is one of the most borring classes to level. You physically press frostbolt and nothing else, unless you AOE grind which could be difficult on a PVP realm.
---
Druid is a bit more engaging and is considered second after the hunter when it comes to speed and ease of leveling.
---
Fun.
---
The inn is all wrong, you're a failure.
---
Wow, where are you?   
---
Only one that bad I can recall was a few years ago when a storm (not even a hurricane) [did this](https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7888412-3x2-940x627.jpg)
---
Power was out for about 3 days to most of the state
---
It keeps track of time similar to a digital watch, you just can't see the time like you would on a watch because it doesn't have a display.
---
Time drift is an issue just like it would be on any cheap clock, but since the it only generates a random number every 30s(?) they have some leeway to work with. The battery in the authenticator only has a specific lifespan (7 years I think from some googling) so it just needs to be accurate enough that it doesn't drift off by more than 30s in that time.
---
I'm guessing the server is setup with some grace period (like 10s) where it would accept both the previous and the future values which would allow up to 10s of drift to not cause any issue.
---
If I am level 25+ and keep up with alchemy/herbalism I will be very happy.
---
Storm strike and Hand of Justice could proc it all the way to burning crusade release
---
No, because a lot of memes are “low effort” or “shitposts” and the mods here are aids. There is a rule that no low effort posts are allowed. The mods just pick and choose what that means so a lot of stuff just gets deleted when the mods don’t like it
---
I’ll go for level 20 and then call it a day.
---
Enjoy the game.
---
You will get raid spots. Even as a ret paly
---
To me 80% of my enjoyment in Vanilla was the journey to 60 thats why i will be leveling professions doing every dungeon as i level.
---
Im rolling a rogue so ill be wasting a lot of time with professions and lockpicking.
---
The endgame isnt the goal like it is on Retail, lets all enjoy our levelling, the struggle is gonna be in our mid levels
---
this sounds interesting
---
they got all the way to rag without understanding each other? cool
---
And you don't need to be Protection to tank low lvl dungeons, you just need a shield.
---
Go ally my man. More people to kill!
---
To have fun
---
Just play both factions and experience both sides of the story and world! That’s the only true way to play wow!
---
As far as I know the silithid quests will be in the game because they were there at launch I think. I hope they are cause it’s really cool for players to investigate it through zones as they level up and then eventually you find out for sure what they are when the gates unlock.
---
it's built into wow now, you just go /cast [@mouseover] spellname.
---
Ah, when aq came out we were raiding 9-16 hours a week. Naxx was worse
---
People like you are why streamer servers will die
---
I levelled on retail today to pass the time. Instead of a +2 stats green for a lvl 10 killquest I randomrolled an epic with +15 stats ... what is this even?? got my first epic at level 10 and didnt even have a blue lol
---

go away dad

Holy spec? Warm up your wand!

Shadow Spec? Warm up your wand!

Druid's sounding good then, cheers
---
For a new player my best advice is do not rush to end game explore run dungeons work on professions as you level just enjoy the journey.
---
Youtube videos
---
Are you an american?
---
When they introduced dual talent specialization in wrath, then later getting rid of retalents altogether, how did they balance it? 
---
Honest question.
---
The worst part about is that the dude is from Tich -
---
These are some really good points - but isn't shadowmeld only usable outside of combat?
---
Also in the scenarios you described, wouldn't I be able to just use an invisibility potion? 
---
The main perk I see of shadowmeld is the permanent stealth in a flag room, or at a base in AB/AV.
---
Also it can’t tell which mob specifically did it so if your fighting multiple mobs with the same name it’ll show the same cast for all of them.
---
Once a Lion, always a Lion. You think the Horde will accept a Lion? Come back home, friend.
---
Yep did that about a year ago.  Figured get it done early enough before classic releases to recover.
---
I am rolling my priest. Not A priest but MY priest. Same name, same race, same look. I love healing and I'm looking forward to doing it again.
---
Being able to login and play for a couple hours without the servers going down...
---
I thought I might want to try Classic and so for some idiotic reason I came to this sub.  If the community is really this hostile that's a huge turnoff.  I didn't know WoW til MoP and liked it and my impression so far is I'll be attacked if I say that here.
---
it was never terrible, the AP nerf wasn't that bad either by the time it rolled around most Enhancement shamans had decent gear to compensate. Exceptionally geared shamans could still rock out 6k (tripple crit no miss etc) winfurys , and you could still double proc Winfury more with stormstrike and hand of justice trinket
---
I’m thinking the same, there will be a huge drop off eventually ... maybe month or two in?
---
omg I forgot about this
---
I had this until 70 :D
---
I will try, but I'm one of those cynical people that read the books before the show was ever announced and was horribly disappointed after around season 5, so I may retreat to my safe space from 2005.
---
Well I'm decidedly average at best so druid it is. Thanks mate.
---
No kids, so I'm just going to find a guild that raids on Sunday and Thursday nights.
---
For sure, it’s just a goal I would like to achieve. I’m just super happy to get the opportunity to play the best game ever made .
---
&gt; Its hard enough to deter the less dedicated yes.
---
Sure, but it's not Everest hard or even Dark Souls hard. It's just a bit longer than levelling any other class.
---
&gt; They're the most played because all 3 specs are viable.
---
I politely disagree. They are the most played because they are overpowered in 1.12 and pirate server play was fossilized in that snapshot of time. They are the best raid DPS, the best raid tanks and kings of PvP. For that one brief moment they were a hybrid that paid negative hybrid tax and through a quirk of history that is how they remained.
---
Ahhhh damnit reading that just gave me a sensory overload lol. WE’RE ALMOST HOME BOYS
---
Any members of a barber shop quartet that can make this an actual thing? I think it would be awesome!!
---
What's the best? I've never played rogue and am considering rolling one
---
You are basically a one man party. Pet is the tanks, hunter is the healer and DPS.
---
I’ll take that over plat any day! Thank you.
---
Do people still make that typo legitimately even after all these years?
---
Nope you’ll be able to switch factions, you’ll just lose your names unless your quick about recreating them. But you don’t be kicked
---
That makes two of us. I literally said "oh god that's old" lol
---
&gt;With this comes the disappointment that I feel when I read articles about how places like Blizzard is hemorrhaging employees because of industry dissatisfaction. I look at upcoming releases and they all feel so thrown together as a means to an end to generate revenue. I miss waiting for games to release from developers with imagination and passion... Which are so few and far between now, and are the exception instead of the standard.
---
It's because they figured out they could get rich making mediocre games.
---
Current AAA titles *use games* to make good money. Older developers used money to make *good games*. It's why everything feels so shallow now, and they are going back to old titles. Because they know, they absolutely know, they have no clue what they are doing other than making money off of well known titles.
---
I cant remember ever seeing any guild recruit a hunter. They are always needed ofc but its not a class guilds usually look for.
---
You have no proof of this
---
That’s a great goal my friend. I really want to keep up with herb and alchemy but I’m planning on running melee cleave dungeon groups so I won’t really be able to keep up with them
---
Just have fun.
---
I just cant stand people who don't seem to have a handle on the difference between "things about vanilla that were arguably better and more indicative of a change in design philosophy over time," and "things about vanilla that weren't as good because the game and genre were both much newer"    
---
      
---
For example, not having the dungeon finder thing is arguably better, because it means people have to talk and network with each other to put groups together and there is more of a server community.  I'm sure some people prefer it different ways, it's just different game design philosophy.  
---
     
---
Applying talent points instantly without a "confirm talents" check is just worse game design.  It's just shittier.
---
I joined wow at the the end of legion, played for about 3 months and quit. O came when bfa came out and quit after a month of that. I came back again about a month ago for 8.2 and i only do my emessary and quit. All the time in between has been on a tbc private server. I would unsub bit classic is out soon.
---
How about people play it how they want to play it
---
I'm excited for all the headaches having no experience i'm sure will bring.
---
Welp, can’t do the slide show videos. Hard pass
---
How about a charity to send money to the innocent families they are tearing apart instead
---
Okay but for real like what's the situation he gets cc'd in? He has counterspell. I have yet to see anyone on this thread tell me how that happens.
---
What are some examples? I haven't heard of entire server lagging bugs or gamebreaking ones
---
FD drops combat and they are both off global CD I believe, which allows this to work.
---
which is still gonna be an absolutely insane amount, the servers are busting at the seams from name reservations alone, which probably less than 10% of players even do. most people arent in this subreddit bubble and are just chilling waiting for launch.
---
It's simple... Do you want to be a stinky, flea ridden, slob of a life form or the elegant light blessed hero of the age? The choice is yours and only yours, but choose wisely... Fleas are a pain in the ass...
---
Whats there to comment on about a bunch of groups spamming variants of LOOKING FOR HEALER in general chat making it unusable for everyone else?

---
Dang man! I'm glad to hear he is OK. That's crazy! I was watching his stream last night.
---
My guild was kind of a blessing in this regard.  We'd do the MC with only 3-4 healers sometimes.  Tanks got heals, hunters doing tranqs got heals, and everyone else was pretty much on their own.  DPS that stood in the fire didn't live long.
---
/thank
---
Anyone know what that wound up being as an average per port in private servers?
---
You want to be a rogue.
---
&gt; Those situations aren't exciting really. It's more like "as soon as you even see a high level player, unless you are a stealth class, you may as well just get up and go make a sandwich."
---
I think of it more, like: "I should go hide before they notice me."
---
Do bosses and mobs of an element type have weaknesses to the opposite element. Example: fire mobs in MC would have a weakness to frost damage? And vice versa for Naxx mobs?
---
Ret♿️Paladin cope

Just off this Reddit’s census poll with like 42,000 responses every NA server except Thalnos had about 1% or less. Thalnos had around 12% it won’t be insanely widespread but I think it will be a noticeable amount.

Thank you! where should I buy gear?
---
2 Gigs of video ram is more than enough to run it, I was able to run the beta at 60+ FPS on a laptop APU that had around 2 gigs of VRAM
---
Yeah fury tree has much better talents to spend points on.
---
They already have the tech to do it. The issues with merging back in 2005/2006 aren't very relevant anymore.
---
Dude this is helpful! Keep up the good work!
---
It depends on if Blizzard ban fish botters or not.
---
I found mine in an old laptop bag not long ago. No longer connected but it did still work even after 10 years.

---
Not to overly spam this, but this is from another post of mine in this thread:    
---
&gt;Look at this thread about the Vanilla PvP rank / gear system: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cpzgb3/need_a_foolproof_system_for_getting_rank_14_and/     
---
&gt;      
---
&gt;Pretty much everybody agrees the system was a toxic and / or dysfunctional piece of shit.  Not to mention almost impossible to get the higher level stuff without either cheating and account sharing, or making some really really questionable and unhealthy life decisions.    
---
&gt;    
---
&gt;I know this would be a pretty major change, but does anybody else think they should scrap the vanilla PvP rank / gear system and come up with something else?  I know in the Burning Crusade people complained about "Welfare Epics," but at least you didn't need to literally be on welfare (and have no job) to get them.  (And the alternative wouldn't necessarily have to be the same system as TBC)
---
Why tell others how to play the game? I get that you don't like "rushing", but to some that is fun and what is even more fun is the endgame - which is why they want to get there as fast as possible and be all they can be :)
---
You’re* shit.
---
In one of the promotional images on the official classic webpage, the advertising for three talent trees for each class showed a picture of a cata mage's talent tree instead of one from classic.
---
Level to 20 and then get some GOOD sleep because I know I'll be too excited to get any decent sleep in the last 24 hours before launch.
---
Honestly the winter springs demon is probably the 2nd easiest and he is the one who requires the most kiting. They were all doable with any sliver of skill. I used to kill the demons for people who couldn't do it for 100g/head. If you couldn't do the quests many would consider you a camera locked shitter
---
It'll run classic just fine, but you can definitely find something better for close to the same price
---
Yeah but if they could manage to do it back then with their crap computers and internet and without the benefit of 10+ years of metagame development, I see now reason why it wouldn't be possible today.
---
how is this the top reply? it's purely optimistic speculation.
---
Go Druid, Mage and Druid combo is awesome, also as a Druid you can fill every single role for your group and do what's needed, making finding/making groups while leveling insanely easy
---
Plus if your friend is a mage you get all the free food/portals you want :P
---
Only issue is it has to be low profile I have small slots. But thanks for the input.
---
I don't see the appeal in playing the game this way, its almost like turning yourself into a bot but good luck OP you've done a lot of prep that's for sure :)
---
You are going to be upset when you realize spirit is warriors best stat for leveling.
---
Yeah pickup dungeons at any level are impossible to wipe on and incredibly easy yet the mobs health pools are so big that it feels like wading through molasses, and the only reason it takes so dang long is because Blizzard wants to sell their level boosts.
---
"I know lots about World Of Warcraft and have been banned for 3 hours once." 
---
Lmao 10/10. When can you start?
---
If you have some recommendations please pm me
---
Thank you.
---
someone who squeezes every last stat point regardless of the effort involved in order to have the absolute best numbers. Someone who would put in a huge amount effort for that one item that will grant a small stat boost over the second best, much more easily attainable, item. Someone who would play a race they may dislike for hundreds of hours only because of a +5% intelligence racial bonus, which amounts to a few hundred more mana at level 60  (i.e. enough for 1-2 more spell casts in a long boss fight if they're lucky).
---
Thank you blizzard
---
Just be able to play! |Maybe make a set of bags for my group.
---
What? No, it's literally, and I really want you to understand, *literally* the same tech. They took sharding, configured it differently, and called it layering. This has been common knowledge for a long time now.

I was planning on shaman because totems are cool, but then I made the mistake of watching a bunch of "what class should I play" videos and now all bets are off.
---
Don't try to educate yourselves kids it's a mistake.
---
i dont trust wowhead classic.
---
Shhhh don’t tell him!
---
im leaning hard on this right now
---
You need to post the specs of the laptop if you want a real answer. Otherwise we’re just speculating.
---
His house is probably branch feed. So whatever got damaged kicked the circuit, they isolate that, then turn everyone else on. The other people wont be on for a while.
---
Me and my buddies have agreed there will be no sleep until a full WC clear.
---
For sure. It was really weird coming off WC3 to faction conflict abound. Especially with some of the ways WoW expanded the lore. So Tauren are druidic as well, sharing a special safe haven on the side of Mt. Hyjal with the Night Elves... but they can't mediate god damn *lumber* trade between the elves and orcs?
---
Good to know, I reserved a dwarf rogue name on classic, i was just making sure I made the right decision. It's hard to find resources that you know are going to be accurate for classic, and having never played one I just kinda guessed
---
This "going home" shit honestly makes me embarrassed to be associated with the wow classic fan base.
---
worst case scenario you have to contact support , its really not a big deal. plus i assume on your home pc you have it set to remember you so you dont have to enter it every time , and in that case you can remove it without needing to use it again. i specifically checked for that a few months ago when i was worried about battery life on mine

It's a terrible paradox.

Small slots you say
---
by 4 days he means closer to 110-120 hours /played. So the fastest levelers will probably be hitting 60 around a week after launch date. Maybe longer considering the world first record previously wasnt completed during a launch of this scale.
---
I’m gonna go with a definite maybe, probably.
---
Yeah because most people don't want to play a non-official server.
---
Warlock gets the free lvl 40 mount from class quest so technically that's 80g you don't have to spend right away.
---
Faction: Horde

Class: Warrior

Role: DPS/Tank

LF a guild with a raid time at 8pm PST/11pm EST with no raid nights of Friday or Saturday. I’ve got kids so I have to be able to help with bed times and also still have time for them. Outside of that I plan on playing as much as I can with a 9-5 and a family. I’m not looking for a guild that A). Min max’s to the point where my non raid time is purely spent farming for raids, and B). Is content with not progressing through raids because “its just a game”. I’d really like something in the middle. A guild that wants to have fun but make progress doing it. If we’re stuck on a boss, I’m all for farming some consumables to push past a tough spot, I just don’t want to feel required to be fully consumed every night. Outside of raids I plan on PvPing as much as I can. Hopefully I can find a group of likeminded players.
---
The top DPS is technically carrying all the other dps in the raid.
---
Believe that only worked on undead. Cant remember where it was learnt but probably a class quest.
---
Obviously.  Saying that there's no difference between a skilled hunter and a huntard implies that the skill ceiling is very low, which is obviously not the case.
---
I'm really mixed on this, on one hand the old feel was to spam the LFG channel on the other it got tiresome posting your macro constantly when you're a generic dps.
---
I got banned twice in Classic for cussing in shout chat. Second time may have been deserved but first time wasn’t even directed at anyone, just part of a convo in shout chat. 🤷‍♂️
---
I don't know about pservers, but back in vanilla 1g was the standard.
---
I played horde for years and I’m switching to alliance to play Paladin, I’m gonna miss RFC definitely, hopefully I’ll still be able to run WC if I get a group brave enough for it but tbh I don’t remember what else I would be missing out on
---
All classes are viable in PvP and PvE. The different specs accentuate their strengths in different ways.
---
People dont understand that not everyone has to get such a high rank. When only a small percentage of people can actually get 12-14, it's inherently not supposed to be for everyone. If you dont want to grind that much, dont. You'll still have fun without getting there so I dont think it's a valid complaint
---
Like in oldschool runescape not everyone is going to get 99 in a skill, relatively few do. It's the progress and time spent that's fun. I.e. it isnt necessary to achieve a high rank to have fun. (But I get that the fact that rank fluctuates weekly kinda sucks because you cant take a break for a week if you want to get somewhere, so arent necessarily making constant progress)
---
*wotlk
---
I'm torn between making a holy priest or a holy paladin. I'm going to be participating in a lot of PVE content as healer but I also want to pocket heal my warrior friend in PVP. Considering paladin and priest are both great for pve healing in their own regards which one would be best for both pve and pvp pocket healing?
---
What's a printer?
---
I was in high school when vanilla came out. I fell in love with the game so much that I decided I didnt want to do anything else but play wow for the rest of my life. I couldn’t hold down a real job when I had more important things like arenas and raiding. How could I support myself and still play wow for 18+ hours a day?
---
Here’s where I suspect most people to say, “what a genius move, why didn’t I think of that?” So, what is it that I did you ask? It’s actually quite simple, my sister went out a lot and would leave her room very messy. I would then take her dirty panties that were laying on my sisters dirty floor and I would sell them to guild mates. At about 300$ a pop all I had to do was sell 1 a week and that would pretty much pay for food and other expenses. Man, life was good then
---
It allowed people to connect.
---
Back then social media didn't exist.  Hell the internet was still being figured out by people.  
---
Wow just hit at a time when gaming and the internet were both becoming main stream.  Now all of a sudden people with "unusual" interests can connect easy and enjoy these interests together.
---
I like this idea. Progress all of the servers to TBC, open one perma-Vanilla server for each major region. Same goes for TBC-&gt;Wrath if it ever happens.
---
Is 5 equivalent to the original retail WoW violence level? 
---
Or is 3 or 4 equivalent?
---
&gt; stopped mid Wrath as the game became easy-mode.
---
Do you know which particular aspect of the game? I think heroic Ulduar was and heroic 5mans were WAY harder than anything that we had faced before, especially optional harder stuff (e.g. Mimiron and Algalon).
---
The is no "vulnerability" stat and only resistance or immunity, so by default no; however, there is curse of elements and curse of shadows that will create negative resistance aka vulnerability, unlike armor reduction that can only go to 0 armor. 
---
There is little information on how negative resistance worked in original Vanilla so it will be a bit of a learning process second time around.
---
Ret paladin is great in pvp as long as you utilize the entire toolkit.
---
Get a wand.
---
You cant overaggro a shaman in lower levels. Rockebiter and earth shock give a lot fast threat.
---

---
Find yourself a used 1050ti. One that does not have a additional power connector. Not only will it get you rolling with Classic, it will give you some overhead for better settings.
---
https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=m570.l1313&amp;_nkw=1050ti&amp;_sacat=0
---
&gt; I was hoping they’d flesh out the questing experience by adding new class quests and other special quests, and perhaps improving the storytelling/immersive potential of questhub areas, but I don’t think they did.
---
no, that would cost money. Classic is not about Bliz spending money.
---
blood pact stacks with fort in retail.
---
how is account security seemingly unnecessary XD
---
I feel like we could put a better spin on this.  Tight slots, maybe?
---
That may work if it's not a super wide open area.  Unless it's a hunter or druid with track humanoids.  Or depending on the classes involved, you can try and use the ocean relative safety if you are near the coast (since they can't mount in the water).     
---
But it's not like you can do anything to remotely fight back if they find you.  You could have a full 5 man party of your friends questing and one of them could effortlessly kill you all.  You could maybe even have a full raid and get smoked?
---
And here I thought hybrid specs when talent trees did.
---
Can confirm, 1050ti 4GB edition is a fucking beast at 1080p gaming.
---
Tell him that mages can't pick locks, problem solved.
---
Right, but there would be an immersive way they could implement it, which could easily be done in repair cost, for example.   
---
I'm not asking to do away with purchasing abilities or anything like that. It's just that I was switching talents multiple times a day. whether it be from arms for pvp, fury, or sometimes as prot, and often I had hardly any money to buy things I actually needed, luckily my guilid was pretty solid and supported me. I know many other people would as well. I'm not the only person who thinks that. In fact from what I've seen from people I've talked to, it's the No change people that seem to be a minority.  
---
Not everything about classic was great or wonderfully implemented. It was the community that was great for the most part. That will be the hardest thing to replicate in classic, because our culture has changed significantly over the years.
---
Dont rush things, dont use addons, buying items off the auction house is fine. If you screw up and over pay, well that's part of the learning experience. Play whatever class fits your fantasy but take the time to learn the class and if you do dungeons, learn dungeon etiquette. Such as if you are a dps, you let your tank do the pulling no matter what.
---
But most of all just have fun, be nice, make friends.
---
if you're in flight from one continent end to the other, it legit could take up to 20 minutes.  get your shower time in.  you'll be shocked how addictive the game can be, and for real, don't be that wow guy who didn't shower.
---
That's so awesome that you've found something you enjoy so much to commit to like that. :D
---
Can it be?! I've found Kargoz's account?!  
---
I'm a huge fan of your vids. Which server are you rolling?
---
Find a spec that works. There's a fury/prot spec that worked for most pve content and was solid in pvp. You can offtank just about anything. I'd only have respecced if I needed to MT.
---
The QoL changes, in a vacuum, are improvements. That's why they were considered and added in the first place. The issue with more QoL, however, is how it changes the way the game is played on a higher level. LFD, for instance, pushes WoW more towards a compartmentalized game and less as a fully realized RPG world.
---
Like... level 10
---
\^ This
---
Nonsense. The barrens is the best you can level there to 20+. More quests in Hillsbrad, Arathi, and stv. Also more quests 1k needles and salt flats, Feralas, Hinterlands. I always get stuck where to go around level 30 Alliance but not Horde. I've leveled multiple toons on both sides Horde is far better for leveling.
---
np man. if its worth anything I got about 5 alts pencilled in atm and 3 leveling buddies :P I may have over committed...
---
If you LITERALLY have a potato, I'm not sure what you'd do with a graphics card?
---
&gt; BC was all about Illidan.
---
As a mostly casual player who played through all of BC but didn't raid Black Temple, I had no idea who Illidan was or what it had to do with all the content I was doing up till that point.
---
I had that dino pet. I named him Wrecks, a pun of the name Rex, as well as it's own word.  To this day I still consider this the most clever thing I've ever done, along with naming my Shiny Zubat "Bruce" because he's Green like Bruce Banner and a bat like Bruce Wayne.
---
I was actually out of school recovering from a surgery when wow came out, so things pretty much worked themselves out lol
---
Character Boosts are coming!
---
&gt; Healers strongly dislike taking other healing classes because of gear competition. 
---
If they aren't coming to the raid as a healer why would they be rolling on healer gear?
---
I started alliance in TBC, switched to horde in WoD, and am now going back home to alliance. Even though I like horde, and each race has pretty interesting backstories, I just love night elves, and the general tolkien-esque fantasy theme of the alliance. I'll prob level at least 1 horde character to 60 after my alliance main and 1 alt, but itll be super slow paced and I prob wont do much at endgame with it.
---
Holy Paladin with a warrior is by far the best combo, the ability to remove poisons is huge. Blessing of Freedom is INSANE for a warrior. And they cant really cc since you can dispel the warrior and keep blessing of sacrifice to make sure you dont get CCed.
---
Phase 2 just wont hit those servers! ^^:D
---
I could see that
---
I once saw two holy paladins dueling.  I came across them on a road going to brd.  After brd I went by the same road.  They were still dueling but a crowd had gathered by now.  That's dedication.
---
as much as I love classic, I have to admit, the boat for night elves to stormwind will be sorely missed lol
---
That will be a long 24 hours
---
I hope someone makes a post about me when I lose power in my house.
---
It could have been really bad! I mighta stubbed my toe :(
---
Not really about your number 5. Today’s kids think that if they are a “dps” class all they have to do is dps. They dont care about anything else. ‘Tank has to keep aggro,healer has to keep everyone alive, dps has to be #1 on damage’ and it kills me. I miss the days where dps has to be smart and watch both aggro and healers to stay alive. It should never be someone else’s job to support/keep you alive so you do what you are supposed to do. This goes for tanks too. You have to keep yourself alive as much as possible with your cooldowns etc to make it easier and better for everyone else’s sake
---
I mean I get some of those a year but I don't want to use them all in one week.. but then again maybe I should.
---
Buddy at work suggested something interesting, learn about what the other classes are bad at, seems like everything I got excited about playing there was always naysayers or complaints. What shittiness can you out up with? What annoying things that a class is deficient in can you get over? Helped solidify my choice, I know the class I'm playing has cons but they personally dont feel as shitty to me as they do to other people, or dont seem as bad as ole hat other classes deal with, it's all personal choice I guess lol
---
karma farm
---
Yes
---
It's funny because back in vanilla I thought it was because most off the twinks were lvl 19 NE rogues and NE hunters which were kinda....well....slender and not 20 yet....
---
Redundant and irrelevant. Don't give your money to a random and expect them to give it to a charity. [Just go straight to the charity](https://www.operationgratitude.com/).

Where and who
---
&gt; "that hybrid class is only viable as a healer
---
I think they were referring to PvE.

&gt; but also, have fun getting 1-shot by a hybrid"

I think they were referring to PvP.

How does it wreck the economy? It's all not like its a private server spawning in gold, it all gold entering the economy naturally.

&gt; They're an apparatus of the American government.
---
They're an apparatus of the American people. Every modern nation has a standing military to protect its citizens and territories.
---
&gt;They go around enforcing sanctions and murdering citizens around the world.
---
This is just so obviously wrong. Despite what you believe, it is not their job to murder citizens around the world. Besides that I think its the Department of the Treasury that deals with sanctions.
---
&gt;They're supported by both democrats and republicans
---
So are firefighters, policemen, the postal service, public schools, roadways, water works, and garbage men.
---
Think of the tree's of Elwynn Forest.  Think of the tall towers of Stormwind!  Think of the great halls of the Forge.  The history, and everything it means.  Think of the soft lights filtering through the canopy of Teldrassil.  Can you \*really\* turn your backs on us?!
---
Negative resistances were only a thing for a few early patches. You can find some screenies from the era of people doing huge crits with negative resistance stacking. By 1.12 they were a long gone memory and won't be in Classic.
---
Sometimes characters that you haven't played for long on a server won't show up so try to log onto the servers you had characters on they might still be there.
---
How come when I log into Wow Classic now, the realms have population if the game isnt out yet?
---
And apostrophes for like, every horde race.
---
Literally.
---
And it's a racket.
---
A good hunter will always be welcome in raids. Contrary to popular belief, you will not rank behind every warrior, rogue, mage, and warlock in the raid. Hunters are perfectly legitimate and useful dps.
---
Gonna be on mat leave in a few months, lol
---
No weaknesses per-se, but there were immunities. Lots of fire immune in MC for example.
---
&gt;But it's not like you can do anything to remotely fight back if they find you.
---
Yeah, that's true. It might have been better game design had the power levels between levels been between levels been designed to be closer (at least on the PvP side). But it is the way it and personally I think the odd time that you get ganked is worth it for the increased tension and atmosphere it brings to the game.
---
It is a weak talent but so are the rest of the options on that tier (after piercing howl 1/1).
---
Is the PVE rotation up there?  I can’t seem to find it.
---
SW:Death oh wait....
---
Brill for Undead, Razor hill for the other, and whatever the second village for tauren.

Depending for what profession.
---
How come I seen this top page twice in a week
---
Made me double-take, you dastardly bot!
---
This gave me chills back then when I first saw i at the ripe age of 14. So simple, but so good.
---
Thanks
---
I wouldn't bother with tailoring for funneling to your pally. If you want to invest into your warlock, that's a different story then. I still don't recommend it unless you're a min/maxer though (tailoring makes one BiS warlock piece at 60, but it's a major effort to get). For anything BoE that your pally can use, you can just find a tailor to craft it for you (you provide the materials). 
---
If you want an alt that will complement your main, one idea is have your alt do herb/alc instead. All pots can be mailed to your pally that way so you dont have to use up that profession slot on your main. Or your main can be skinning/herb and send the herbs to your warlock alchemist (then warlock would be alc + skinning/mining).
---
Why are you actively trying to avoid the vanilla experience?
---
Each layer is the size of a full server though
---
reminds me of the time i was permanently muted in RuneScape (around 2004) and I sent about 10+ pages of printouts of gold selling websites to jagex in an attempt to prove myself a good boy to try and get unmuted.
---
it worked :)
---
That thinking outside the.......box?
---
Are you being willfully ignorant are you really at obtuse? The military is inherently political because of what it does - what it stands for. It's an apparatus of the government meant solely to threaten, maim, and kill.  This might come as a shocker to you, but not everyone in this god forsaken country supports them or their methods. Some of us oppose imperialism.   
---
Not everyone wants to see an advertisement for a "charity stream" to raise money for people I, and many others, consider terrorists.
---
Holy Pally is super boss.  It's not for me, but a good roll for many people.
---
According to Skarmtank, no.
---
(The last word)
---
I never said I can't take any time off.
---
That too. I always level as arms and I've never had trouble tanking as long as I keep a shield in my bags.
---
Make sure to go engineering for Ret PvP.
---
Me too man I was 15 when I started playing so I was probably 16 or so when I saw this video!
---
I hate to bash on vids but this is such a bad clickbait.
---
TL;DW 
---
Make "1000g a week" by. . .
---
Oh...
---
Use Auctioneer and buy/sell.
---
Like, really dude? A whole video to give no real advice at all other than buy low sell high.

It's ok as an introductory to someone who has never played before, but that doesn't seem to be your angle.

---
Some freaky $&amp;@#s going on in that building to the left.
---
I don’t believe them at all. No way they aren’t most played class
---
It's got some niche uses in PVE for rogues, nothing worth shelling out the mats and gold for it though.
---
Sounds like you won't be "maining" paladin ..
---
Play what you want brother, and enjoy it .. your alt might turn into your main....
---
From what I’ve heard, the only streamer I know is Towellie that’s rolling on Pagle. Only because that’s what his guild decided so we’ll see how it goes.
---
It's only temporary and to make sure that the servers don't die out immediately since they're expecting a huge number of players to check out the game and then leave. It's not ideal but it is necessary.
---
how they gonna crunch a fucking game that came out 15 years ago
---
&gt; Oh my god class design is so fucking boring now.
---
I miss when class design was at it's pinnacle in MoP.
---
Not sure how interesting vanilla frost/fire mage will be, which basically amounted to "use fireball/frostbolt x 10000000".
---
You may be correct, from what I know negative resistances is one of those internal mechanics even current devs are not totally sure about. 
---
P servers were never able to get them working.
---
That's entirely dependent on your spec. Unless you're railroading yourself down some streamer's preferred way of speccing, you could easily starting using your preferred spell at level 10 as your first talent might be put into either Improved Frostbolt or Improved Fireball.
---
Either way.. there's no real reason to buy both.
---
Yes and that's okay. It makes no sense to have the same amount of black lotus for 2.5k and 25k people.
---
If you’re not interested in crafting while leveling up your character, pick skinning + either herbalism or mining for your two primary professions. Skinning let’s you get leather off of beasts you kill, and herbalism and mining let you find flowers and ore to gather.
---
All of these gathered items are used in the crafting professions, so put them up on the auction house to make some easy money while you level. Though if you’re starting day 1, you may have trouble selling stuff on the AH, since no one will have much money yet. Once people are done racing to 60, many will start working on their crafting professions, and they’ll often rather buy materials than traipse all over the world to find them.

Once again proving that warlocks are the master class.
---
nice one
---
mind of i add multiple days and sing it in a video?
---
Because nobody has the skills to tank Classic.
---
More quests doesnt make a zone more enjoyable. Barrens and 1K needles are just awful.
---
Yes.
---
Now your issue is making noise and the light.
---
Prepare for that fight.
---
That's true, my comment is independent of this.
---
It depends what class. Shaman/druid/hunter have early class quests you don't want to miss. I don't think there's any too important for other classes but it's worth it to check.
---
I agree that it was a huge loss. In Vanilla and classic, unless you outlevel or outgear the content, every quest area is a unique tactical puzzle. 
---
You have to figure out how to pull mobs safely, without aggroing more than one or two at a time. Clearing through an area with a large group of mobs, all on their own patrol routes, is challenging. Challenging in a way that frankly you rarely see in retail
---
That challenge is magnified in outdoor elite areas. Which retail lacks.
---
I miss it a lot in retail, and that difficulty is a huge reason why I’m excited to play classic.
---
That analogy doesn't really work. I'd rather get pinched everyday for a week than punched once. You are going to play on a dying server because the casuals left until Blizz decides when? Layering isn't great, but it's much more fluid and adaptable than something as crude as server mergers. I will take it every single time over dead servers needing mergers.
---
Level 8 and 9 on hunter (especially if your luck is shit with axe drops) are the worst levels in the game.
---
I'm only repeating what I've heard about the stress test. I didn't personally notice if the gore was high or low since I play so zoomed out, but others have said it's low.
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/violence-level-returned-blood-effects-with-video/218202

Here's some comparison videos etc, but it still doesn't state which setting corresponds to retail Vanilla.
---
Mom!!! Moar hot pockets!!!!
---
DPS disc priest?
---
Clearly not enough BBQ HotPockets
---
I would probably spread it out so that I didn't get stuck at 56 with no quests left if I could. But getting to 58 or 59 with no quests would be okay. You can start working towards your pre-raid gear even before then. One thing I love about Classic is there's always some kind of content to tackle at any level and some kind of challenge you can find for yourself.
---
Enlisting is a political statement.
---
mage gets pretty fun when you're able to start AoE grinding, think it was around 25-30 for mages.
---
&gt;Is there a list of the changes in WoW classic from Vanilla WoW?
---
Not sure but we can start one.
---
 - Layering
---
 - Auto loot
---
 - New macro system
---
 - Higher end graphics options (vision range etc)
---
&gt;Are there multiple rows of hotbars by default?
---
You just get the one row, you have to go into options to toggle on any additional rows.
---
Yes, Class trainers are only available in the area where starting race can play that class. Example: there are no druid trainers in Orc, Troll, or Undead starting zone. There is no Hunter trainer in Human starting zone either. 
---
From what I recall even main cities only have Class trainers associated to the available classes fro that race.
---
is there any for the other classes as well?
---
No. This "caring is dumb" counter circlejerk has always been stupid and it still is.
---
Good sustenance for fighting those Elwynn Forest boars.
---
last frames speech bubble is unnecessary and takes away some funnies imo.
---
I came here to say this. From day 1 I focused on the competition and meta-game. The thing I missed was the story, the lore, the immersion in the world. I can't say I regret playing the way I did because it was fun in its own way, but going back to play it for the 'RPG' part of 'MMORPG' is what has me interested in Classic.
---
This is literally me going to sleep this last week or so.
---
“Another day closer”
---
And god tier wpvp. They really arent nearly as bad as everyone says they are. I played one for almost the entire time vanilla was current.
---
Yikes, my guy. I one day hope it fades into obscurity allowing you a moments respite.
---
Someone get the Purple Power and 409 jfc.
---
With how phases are coming out, you can realistically be pretty geared with a guild that is only raiding 1-2 times a week. If you keep good retention rates of players, you’ll only need to be running the top tier raid at each phase due to not having to gear out newbies in the guild with the lower tier raids.
---
However, this is much easier said in theory than practice. You can definitely be a semi-hardcore player and still be fairly geared out if you’re smart about it.
---
Even playing the beta I realized that I am exponentially smarter this time around and can put myself in better situations than when I was 13-15 years old.
---
Wasn't there a post about those bugs already being fixed before the stress test?
---
If you have Spotify I have a huge playlist of only the most [epically dorky metal possible] (https://open.spotify.com/playlist/18C9j8mSbayoT0s3n59ESG?si=R-BhuoEHQKyl5kS1w2H5Pw) that I plan to be jamming out on.
---
well send this to your friends so they know what happens to their characters.
---
Fratbros playing Alliance checks out
---
I'm gonna have to remember this add on. I was hoping Opie would get developed. At the very least I want something like this for consumes.
---
Is that some kind of min-max rotation or just a preference?  
---
When I played Druid I always did for example: Wrath - Moonfire - Wrath - Melee - Melee  
---
If you open with Moonfire you don't get that free Wrath cast before getting hit. If you Moonfire too late you waste the DoT if the target dies too early.  
---
Also level 32-60, isn't it better to open up with Shred/Pounce/Ravage?
---
That stove is nasty.
---
definitely the next best thing, of course.
---
Only in first world countries
---
Fury is great DPS at 60, but unfortunately you have no innate threat reduction and no threat dump, so you will eventually become threat capped.
---
Hell yea gotta love a tight slot
---
Don't read a single guide. The fun part is the unknown and what you have to explore. 
---
I'm looking forward to release, and I have a LAN planned with 5 of my friends, but I'm frightened that I'lll get bored because of what I now know and have experienced.
---
I'm staying as far away from guide / detailed youtube videos as possible.
---
So I'd say any videos on what each class does above 10 minutes will contain too much info and ruin some of the exploration surprises  that will come along with the game.
---
&gt; 100g/head

Damn, bargain basement. I did it for 2k (for all 3).

Just going to leave this here, my secret fishing spot that nets me about 40-50g an hour. 
---
On the very south shore of tanaris you can hug the boundaries going west till your subzone turns to tanaris. 
---
So you’ll be at Tanaris, Tanaris and the landscape will turn to a green grass texture. Once there, find a plateau, you can fish all the high end fish for raids and LOADS for chests were you can sell the bolts of cloth on the AH. Hope this made sense because it’s a killer spot for easy laid back gold farming.
---
ya man this is pretty shit work keep it up!
---
weird way to spell gnome
---
No one knows. Best guess is 6-15 hours /week. It will likely change a lot depending if you're on a low pop PvE server compared to full PvP one.
---
You dont know what u are talking about if you are not a developer. Work never ends, nothing is finished until somebody steps in and says “ok, we have 100 issues  yet but its time to have a release candidate”
---
This would happen in a medium sized project, imagine a huge one such as games.
---
Right, not many people did naxx...
---
Wow is very CPU heavy. Any GPU will do just fine honestly.
---
Again this is the charity. This is a different charity than the one you posted but an official non profit organization.
---
Yeah it's a big world
---
Lol youre so brave.
---
Will you cover Alterac Valley as well?
---
Dude just play the class that seems the most interesting and enjoyable to you. Screw everyone else.
---
I’m guessing levelling by yourself because everyone else gets a power level isn’t the most fun experience.
---
I think you may be taking this comic too seriously
---
when we had tornados rip through our state our power was out for 2 weeks D: but it was fun cause everyone was grilling all their meat so it was a feast for 2 weeks. lol
---
In vanilla, hunter was the first to max level.
---
Aoe training mobs.
---
Are Paladins really that bad in classic, I'm psyched to play one
---
Definitely a lock in there using hellfire. I wish it wasn't in scrambled porn quality....
---
They're pretty good in duels to be sure but better than Mage or Lock or Rogue or Spriest? No way.
---
Greater blessings are a thing in this version so you don’t have to do that.
---
Ret is pretty tough to play well.  You have to farm more than others, you will get called out before others.  Theres a lot of nuances between your mana based melee class and other melee, so you gotta learn the playstyle more or less by yourself because theres only one ret in each guild. Keeping vengeance up while timing your spells in between autoattacks, paying attention to your procs, and keeping your eyes open for when a guildie needs a bop or layonhands, its a lot for a new player to handle.  I would only recommend rets for experienced players, because the ret gameplay accounts for 70% of playing the class.  The other 30% is dealing with the communitys negative opinion of ret players.  It will happen, everyday.  Gl
---
I get to play while I’m at work...sooo no sweat here.
---
Leveling a warrior is much worse
---
I thought that was the purpose of mind-flay...
---
Okay but where’s my paladin cheat sheet?!?! Where do I level up my auto attacking skill?!??
---
[Here's a non-exhaustive list](https://classic.wowhead.com/news=294499/wow-classic-beta-and-stress-test-bug-fixes) of the bugs players found and reported that have been fixed.
---
This doesn't count bugs Blizzard found and fixed in internal QA processes.  Nor does it could bugs people have found where the fixes are still en route.  It is, nonetheless, an impressive list.
---
Will we be able to explore Hyjal and such with a lot of creative rock climbing and all?
---
off topic question,if u sub to wow clasic now do u  get it to play now or you have to wait for oficial relese
---
[This is a primer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEi0z3Bdd8M), the blood elves are basically high elves.  But the WC3 campaign clips paint a pretty clear picture about the alliance
---
Drop the settings and Classic will run on the shittiest of laptops. In the beta someone got a stable 60fps with a 10 year old core2duo.
---
That's the thing, I really want to play on all of them equally much :/
---
hunter trainer in stormwind, short distance.  
---
Worst is the druid i believe, but they get moonglade tele and can hearth back i think.
---
I’m not sure bots and goldfarmers will really be established in the first couple.
---
If you have a thunderfury, it’s a solid play. Just inform the guild leader of your specific needs ahead of time, they’ll understand.
---
Try to avoid escort quests. Remember to repair and clear bag space before you leave town.
---
It was basically a plug for his addons.
---
You’ll be fine. I took the 26th off, but realistically won’t be able to play until the next day on the 27th. By the 28th you’ll have people going back to work and a smoother time.
---
Yelling where are my heals at 3am might get you evicted from the bed room.
---
By the end of the beta there was still an immense amount of bugs remaining, and in particular the hunter was still in a very bad state.
---
There has been a huge list published but it doesn't list anywhere near all the bugs there were, but also the list isn't comprehensive.
---
In all likelihood there's going to be a massive amount of bugs being reported and fixed in the first few weeks.
---
have: grotesque and gothqt on Herod, looking to trade for other Herod names :-)
---
Not really absolutely needed but it helps alot. It could make a  bit of gold in the AH and how gold worked back then getting a stack of fish to eat while questing was helpful.
---
Honestly, economists could use retail WoW as a case study on the effects of the sunk cost fallacy on the human mind.  I'm like 95% convinced at this point that it is the main reason the vast majority of retail players are still playing.
---
All the orc boys will assume that position when I enter ungoro, they can’t get enough of my night elf futa
---
Since Im studying at Tech college, that'll have priority obviously.. I'd wager.. 2-3 hours on weekdays, and 8-7 hours on weekend days?
---
I have tried over and over to play retail. I just get bored instantly
---
I don't want you to think I'm retarded im.just repeating OP. You are absolutely correct
---
Its basically layering, except much more aggressive.
---
&gt;only played on PvE server
---
Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah that makes sense.
---
Why do we have to be patient for these types of things
---
If I can get out of the starting area it’ll be a success.
---
Wait so wouldn't we have to respec again at 60 for optimal healing? Never levelled past 7 in vanilla
---
I think this is mostly a PVP server issue. Players want to outgear others and then roflstomp them. You will find more players that enjoy the journey on PVE.
---
I played a Paladin in Vanilla.  Exorcism was only usable against undead until patch 1.9 when it was changed to work against demons too.

Oh shit that’s a good idea, I was pretty worried about affording a mount
---
NE female druid, and I planning on running one again with the same name lol 
---
I'll be a little more smart, and have an alt probably for the auction house, and to eventually level. I'm thinking maybe a mage so that I can raise them to level 42 for portals. that way I have a means of making money easily.
---
Layering will not be a thing after phase 1 ends
---
Thought everyone hated hunters because they rolled on everything lol
---
Well, I hope that works out for you/him.
---
Ah, you were talking Alliance. You can kite him to a friendly guard NPC just down the path. It is challenging but doable. I’ll write in a option to Skip in that quest, however.
---
Lol I'm trolling. I can't even pretend to be this dumb
---
Firelands was pretty dope tbh
---
Intent doesn't really have anything to do with it. My granddad didn't consider himself sexist but God forbid you were a waitress when he went out to a restaurant. You can absolutely be racist or sexist etc. without deliberately trying to be so.
---
That's ok. We're embarrassed you're associated with us, too.
---
This thought process hurt my brain.
---
I have no idea if they are actually in crunch, but if they are, that's terrible. The dev team doesn't need our thanks. They need proper working conditions. No release date is worth giving that up.
---
I'll preface this by saying I'm closer to 40 than 30, and I haven't been this excited about an mmo in at least a decade.
---
How fucked is that?
---
ignore what  
---
horde vs alliance might be the skeleton game was built upon, but its definitely not main plot
---
don't listen to any guides or anything, and play the role and race that you want to play. because you're going to be playing it for hundreds of hours.
---
you can min Max later
---
All these guild recruitment threads saying MC clear by the end of the first month.. they don't remember how long this shit took. All that hydraxian rep you're going to need as well to even summon majordomo etc.

All the addons. All the macros. That’s the only way to play through vanilla.

Smash that report button all day!

I'll echo everyone else's thoughts. Holy Paladin is definitely the superior pocket healer.
---
The only reason I rolled a Nightborne Rogue on retail, is that they ruined the animations of the Undead Rogue.

I know about blood elves, but didn't know the wc3 part. I guess its similar to what the eastern kingdom alliance is doing to night elves now.

Cause i liked it back then?

That note must have gotten lost in the sauce. Thank you for the heads up.

This is awesome

Don't you hate it when a game gives you so much game to play that it makes you mad and you have to remove all of the game so you can play on autopilot and send NPCs out for your stuff.

That would be a serious agnomealy.

Ok I'm confused.  Are you saying that the concept of a military is evil?  Or that that military of one particular "god-forsaken country" is used for evil purposes?
---
If it's the former, then you're right to say this violates rule 5, but I think you're wrong.  A threat of force against bad actors will always be needed as long as humans are alive.
---
If it's the latter, then you're hijacking the discussion and making it a political matter about the military in your particular country, and you're actually the one breaking rule 5.
---
What if WoW is like Smash Bros and it's all just some kids imagination as they play with toys?
---
Damn thanks, this is amazing. Exorcism adds a very large amount of dps/leveling speed doesnt it?
---
Do you rememeber anything about learning  it? Wowheads drawing a blank(apparently a libram teaches it.. Unknown source)
---
Yeah that's exactly what I meant
---
Resto shamans speccing into Improved Weapon Totems is a thing which speedrunning private server guilds have been doing. The broad justification is that the gain in windfury dps outweighs the usefulness of Mana Tide totem. If your raid is good at the game and using consumables etc then they can power through boss encounters fast enough that mana efficiency is a minor concern.
---
If your raid can't down bosses quickly and fights drag on for a few minutes, then mana tide starts becoming more valuable. So full restoration spec will make your life a bit easier as a healer, and improved wf totem isn't that much more powerful than the basic version.
---
For levelling I'd recommend sticking to the enhance or elemental tree. You should be able to heal any levelling content capably with any spec, and being able to contribute to damage is likely to be more helpful even if you're levelling exclusively in a group. Elemental would have the advantage of being able to switch seamlessly between healing and damage with the same gear.
---
I feel ya, i almost blew myself up today igniting a deep fryer, lost my eyebrows, and all i could think was *i almost missed classic*

First toon was a NE druid got to high 30s then quit playing him. Started to hate the class. Went Horde after and been Horde ever since.

I don't have a lot of time to invest into video games, wow with it's expansions seems massive and i'm not *that* into it. Classic interests me because I really wanted to play it back when it came out but wasn't able to, I'm doing this for my younger self in a sense.
---
is "Time" the nickname of your exwife?

I recall there being a weekly fishing tournament every sunday morning in STV, anyone know if this will be a thing again?
---
As someone who only barely tried healing in Cata once and recently played healer on the stress test, I can tell you that healing is super fun if you enjoy being a team player. I personally thought the rat race to the top of the dps meter was a bit one-dimensional, so I started looking in to healing and it's just really refreshing. In any form of WoW, whether Classic or BfA (assuming max-level content), if a healer fails to do his job right, then everyone dies. It can be very frantic, chaotic, and bloody exhilarating. It's also super fun in PvP, both in small-scale close-quarters action or large-scale long-range showdowns.
---
Paladin that have mained since August of 2005.
---
Now I'm going with a mage for Classic, but with a paladin alt.

Every time I think of accomplishing something in-game I imagine it with my pally but I have to remind myself I'm now a mage dammit.

For you it was enjoying the journey, for the next guy it's raiding, for the next guy it's leveling professions, for the next guy it's pvp. Can we all just stop telling people how to enjoy this game on this sub? Everyone posts things they are passionate about here. And you can guarantee if you love it and are passionate enough to create a spreadsheet or guide or whatever and share it with this sub, then someone else is just as passionate and will be very grateful you spent the time creating and sharing. Cool on you for enjoying the leveling experience but please don't assume that's why everyone plays the game.

What's a good combinations of profs for duo leveling? I'm going priest, wife is going warrior. She'll be likely taking mining and herbalism for early game money, and I was thinking either herbalism/alchemy or tailoring/enchanting. I'm leaning towards tailoring/enchanting just because of the ability to make and sell bags to supplement our income from gathering. Thoughts?
---
I remade three names on Whitemane today without issue.
---
What's the alternative though?   
---
  
---
Serious question.  
---
Propose an alternative that doesn't result in 100s of Rank 14's walking around the realm.
---
5-man parties
---
Mine was a rogue named Tricke. I have remade him although I will be a Priest for classic
---
Was just saying new PvP videos need more Tupac fade outs.
---
Nice, ty
---
Well you are in a good place with those two.
---
I'm playing a Pally to trio with a DPS Mage and DPS Rogue.  What build should I use to make sure I can tank, heal and protect the other two?  We will be PVE only...Thanks in advance!
---
&gt; Rage generation primarily comes from damage taken not damage dealt, but warriors struggle in multi-mob encounters more than any other class because they are rage dependent. It's a catch-22: in order to deal more damage you need to take more damage, but taking more damage probably means you'll die before you can finish the fight. 
---
This is what makes warriors the best duo class with a healer (Along side a warlock). They go from a slow, painful leveler to a powerhouse wrecking crew with a healer.
---
This is also why any warrior solo leveling wants to party up with a healer as often as they can.
---
Human mage?
---
Even speaking as a gnome
---
/spit
---
would farming dungeons not be a decent way to get those last few levels? thats how I remember doing it in BC, I love dungeons and I can do them over and over again no problem
---
Assuming Undead is what you want to level and not just an example, you'll be fine for trainers. Trolls can be Mages and Priests so there'll be trainers around. Even Thunderbluff has them in 1.12. The only major incompatibility possible is if you want to level a Druid somewhere other than Mulgore. After Lv10 even that's a non-issue because you can just teleport to Moonglade at will.
---
Class quests *are* race specific. For example if you make an Undead Warlock and travel to the Valley of Trials, you'll have to go back to Tirisfal to get your imp, VW, etc.
---
most people arent sub yet , the launch going to be a shit show
---
yeah I tried to find a guild on the classic discord and nobody is doing casual guilds on there, appears to be 60 hard core guilds though lol
---
I have played since the beginning but I don’t remember much of the levelling process because I only did it twice before tbc dropped and I’d like to hit 60 ASAP while not being able to play as much as I want. I have a friend rolling warrior and two others who are unsure on class but we have most of a group for dungeon crawling if it’s gunna be worth it.
---
If you’d rather, there is a 98 page slideshow to go with it...
---
I have no expectations, I'm in no rush to get as high as possible for the first 24 hours. I will be taking 2 days off work to use up some vacation. So that 4 day weekend I would like to be around 40, hopefully higher.
---
This was really well done. Excellent job.
---
Undead priest, parents made me quit. Few months later, new server and new account another undead priest
---
it's the sign that says "&lt;&lt; eastvale logging camp     westfall &gt;&gt;"
---
Loot master sits on all mats then LC the crafted gear to the MT.
---
Thank you but I know my way around more than my home town.
---
Girls play Horde confirmed.
---
It's a blast but can be difficult as everyone relies on you.
---
I played holy priest, resto druid, and holy paladin and it's great.
---
I plan on going resto shaman this time around
---
i can't agree, better dps sure but leveling pace no way. hunter's have aspect of the cheetah and traveling is a huge portion of your leveling time. hunters can pull 2 mobs at a time alternating between auto shot a mob on pet aggro and then melee/raptor strike a mob aggro'd on you which warlocks cannot do. they can dot both but then after all they can do is wand or cast with pushback. hunters can use their full kit on 2 mobs at a time without any negative spending every global, have extra movement speed (which is huge for leveling times, even after mounts at 40 because it's instant cast 30% movement speed vs. 3 second cast 60% speed), hunters are just op from 10 when they get pet until you're pre raid bis at 60.
---
I don’t see that at all in this sub.
---
I thought they were planning on nabbing Mage/Lock robes and crap for their Spelladin shenanigans?
---
Ooh, look at Mr Big Shot here with his reasonable priorities and healthy mental state
---
My main was a warrior named Hamsterboat until I quit in WOTLK. I got rank 1 multiple times on him. It was gonna be between warrior or mage, but I love the warrior class slightly more than the mage class. In order to change things around I will be playing horde this time around for WF procs :)
---
respec price goes up the more you do it. capping at 50g. first one will cost like 1g
---
Iiiittttsss taaaakkkiinnnnggg foorrrevvverrrrr
---
You don't, you are picking a spec the benefits your wants over your guild/raid's wants... What do you call that?
---
And this sub isn't a small percentage of the wow community?
---
they are so not prepared for the massive wave of subs on the 26th (EST)
---
Except the server was literally capped at 14k during launch, I never, EVER saw it go higher than 13k during any point after launch, even on Sundays. That "community manager" is lying.
---
It’s gonna take more than tornado to stop the GOAT.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Yeah it's a computer for $150 on Amazon just no gpu but I'm like broke and this one looked best for the price. I could get a 1030 for $40 more but hard to afford. I was thinking these two for release (the comp and 710) then upgrading in a couple months to a 1050 ti. If I can get 60 fps on low that will work for me!
---
Didn't see it on the front page, and the title doesn't say what it is. Leaving this. 
---
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
funny story. did you know all the emotes translate? 
---
if you type /healme, or /followme, /wait /stay /yes /no etc, they translate to whatever the other person's local language is just like item links and the like? 
---
No, you can't relate complex strategies. But most of the time you don't need to. You just have to use the tools you're given.
---
That was good druidn right there. Healing and dpsing at the same time and back filling your bros that fell down to bring success to the team. A pure support class played by rock stars who saved the day every day. People who played them looking to main tank or be on the meters didn’t understand and went home feeling sorry they didn’t roll a rogue. Druids are under appreciated.
---
Speak up man! Who are these reasonable people?
---
Better to save the money unless if you level an alt.
---
Let people enjoy the game how they want to. Telling people to “stop it” is literally so ironic..
---
Depends. If the lock stands there and takes it while trying to cast, they don't make it.
---
Apply instant cast dots, death coil, fear, then kite.
---
I interpreted it as it is already a toxic wasteland and when the game comes out it turns into an absolute inferno of bullshit just like the character naming day
---
Drakedog had some amazing videos back in the day
---
Just go fish lol
---
Okay cool. I mean I don't mind tough content I just worry about finding a guild with my times because of my midnight schedule(I have to sleep a lot during the day etc). 
---
Thanks!
---
I never see the "I'm going to rush to 60" threads, but this asshole thread pops up every other day at least.
---
I much prefer casting one blessing 8 times every 15 minutes over buffing the entire raid with fortitude, spirit and shadow protection when you have to sit down and drink after two casts. Priests are not exactly common in your raid so it's not unusual for you to have to buff half the raid which is a complete pain in the arse.
---
Pure gold!
---
Could have added dungeons and raids and any small village with a flight path doesnt matter if its horde or alliance but its way too late right now, tommorow ill do it and post it
---
Yeah, that's what I hate about hybrids: You have so many specs to choose from but you can only play 1 due to prohibitively high respec costs.
---
For the most part, 0/30/21 will allow you to heal perfectly fine and also be a decent DPS / tank. Moonkin is sadly a huge meme until you can get lots of spell crit gear.
---
Zuggers gonna zug.
---
I remember reaching Darnassus for the first time and Elune be damned was I impressed. Outside the city walls we had those giant gleve throwers, everything was interwoven with trees and roots and it felt like the city where nightelves would life.
---
The Office? :)
---
More than enough for Classic.
---
The beginning will be the best time to buy gear while leveling because the AH will be flooded with these items as everyone is still leveling up. Additionally the amount of gold in the economy will be at its lowest so players will not be able to sell these items at higher prices.
---
If time is an illusion, I wonder what it's hiding...
---
Tbh I'm selling my PS4 to buy this lol...
---
He's why I rolled a warlock main
---
Yeah it is not uncommon for tornados to form even in October. But generally may-September is our tornado season.
---
There were still unfixed, known bugs as of the beta being open a few days ago...
---
Is there a priest one tho
---
Cause I loooved my Druid and I love proving people wrong when they say they can’t do crap in vanilla lol. I never topped charts but was always helpful and saved many dungeon runs and raids by being able to heal and tank whenever needed. Plus world pvp as a Druid is awesome lol
---
Gnomemeansno
---
ughhh I hate it,
---
But yes it would work, although you could just buy a otg usb cable to plug a real keyboard and mouse into it instead of that technological nightmare.
---
for $25 there is a good chance you could even buy a crappy laptop of kijiji or craigs list that would be able to run wow classic lol
---
So you are accusing me of lying?
---
You think you will, but you wont
---
Honestly, just enjoy the experience. Don't follow guides, don't try to hit 60 ASAP. Do dungeons as you level, find groups, die to mobs, get ganked, run around aimlessly in major cities for hours, work your way at getting better, talk to people and make friends. Honestly classic is quite the adventure specially for having never played the game and even better yet if you have never played an MMO.
---
Bought WoW in 2006. First char was a level 14 Human Priest on Jadenar(?) - still level 14 today.
---
Oh, well, that is a tough one.  They both have their merits, but I can explain why I have made my choice and hope that it helps to inform your choice.  My first WoW characters were on a PvP server (Lightning's Blade), but this time around I'm going to be on Pagle, which is PvE.  
---
While leveling or playing on a PvP server there is a constant threat from the opposing faction, you not only have to worry about pulling too many mobs, but you also have to worry about being in the path of an enemy player.  This truly does make the world feel more alive and skirmishes with other players are some of my fondest memories of WoW.  I killed the same warrior four or five times in 1 night while leveling in the Hinterlands and he was 3 levels higher than me - but he kept coming back for more and it never ended in his favor, lol.  Getting blasted by a much higher level player creates less than fond memories, but even that can turn into an full on battle royale with your friends/guild and his friends/guild which can make for very fun times.  You may not be completing your quests, or getting much experience, but you sure are having fun.  
---
This time around though, I'm older, I have a toddler, I have (best case scenario) about 10 to 12 hours to play per week.  In these circumstances, it's going to take me MONTHS to get to 60 and I'd like to level more than 1 alt, so I don't really feel like I have time to be derailed by the world PvP.  I'm also going to be 'behind the curve' in leveling which may make for fewer zone skirmishes w/ players of the same level (because it will be less populated, as people will have already be higher), but it will also mean there are more high level characters to kill me mercilessly.  I actually wanted to roll on the RP server this time around, just to add a little different flare/elements, but I'm playing with a family group and was overruled.
---
You can clearly see from the video that that is world of warcraft, probably
---
Vanilla was built to be enjoyed at every level, not just endgame. People need to understand that. It's the journey AND the destination.
---
I can only comment on the engineering questions. If you plan on PVP'ing at a serious level, engineering is an absolute must. CC grenades are unbelievably strong.
---
RemindMe! August 27th, 2019
---
no way man
---
even in vanilla it didnt take me 3 months at 2-3 hours a day while working fulltime
---
if gnomes could be druids i would roll one. when they added gnome priest i race changed the second i could . to be honest i just really wanted to say " i guess my heals came up short" when i let the tank die
---
This guy's right. Warrior has a large toolkit of bandages.
---
I hear ya. I'll be traveling Vietnam for 6 weeks! So I really shouldn't complain. As you said though, "but... classic?". Ha. I'm bringing a very light ZenBook for work. It can't really play games sadly, plus I don't think the wife would appreciate me spending 50% of my time in Vietnam and 50% in Kalimdor...

As you contribute to a post you deem as worthless. Bravo my friend.
---
Knew I'd get one insecure person defend their life choices.
---
Microprogression until you're a God. Anyone saying something different hasn't figured it out yet. 
---
Friends are cool too
---
Uh i think 13 years is enough time for it to feel fresh again
---
Or you can farm 100 other ways and buy stuff on the AH like everyone else. Fishing certainly isn't for everyone, and if it was, fish would be worthless.
---
Hunter is able to solo elite mobs fairly easily. Add in rarely needing to stop to eat or drink and they will definitely be fastest.
---
I giggled
---
I made a human paladin, got to level 3 and some how ended up in westfall getting destroyed by mobs, I uninstalled the game and didn't play for another month after my 2 friends were doing deadmines until 2 in the morning.
---
Most people would never actually see a Black Lotus out in the world. During my time on nostalrius i saw only one in winterspring.
---
sure ill do one version with only dungeons and raids added and ill reply in the comments with a map that has all the flight paths including dungeons
---
It’s taught by your class trainer. Nothing special to do...
---
https://legacy-wow.com/classic-addons/atlas-world-map-classic/
---
I had completely forgotten about mana gems. Classic is going to be awesome.
---
Honestly, I was saying 1 week.. then I heard world record times for 60 was around a week so i immediately said nope! then thought perhaps 2 weeks would be fine.. then I saw this pic.
---
I'm just excited to be on an adventure again, the challenge of having to earn enough gold to afford what I want instead of having thousands on retainer, being challenged by some beast 3 levels higher than me
---
The only thing I'm still deciding on is leveling gathering skills or tailoring on my mage, I'm open to suggestions
---
Lol good one
---
Pas parler Anglais
---
I just had knee surgery so I have two months off work to do nothing but play classic
---
I can't speak for rogue pve, but rogues have an insane skill cap in PvP
---
Because they get plowed hard by all the big beefy dps classes
---
If names aren't important then there's no harm in me keeping my three on Herod and if queues are too high come launch I can always hit random on a lower pop server.
---
Yes it was, your post I mean. I mean a three word reply, with 33% being a vulgarity. How much thought, exactly, did you put into this reply. You must be the pride of your community college. Nice job, my friend.
---
I guess i just enjoy healing more than most. My hybrid resto/balance spec basically let me do whatever i wanted. Feral and moonkin were terrible though. Resto was really good with the caveat that they could be annoying in bad dungeon groups due to no regular res.
---
I wish that I had a life. I’m only gonna play Classic because I have absolutely nothing better to do.
---
For dps warriors, the R12/13 PVP gear isn't really absurdly overpowered.
---
The legs and shoulders are BIS up to AQ.
---
The boots are BIS until Chromatic Boots from BWL.
---
Gloves are only slightly better than Tier 1 and inferior to Flameguard Gauntlets in Phase 3.
---
The chest and helm suck. In fact, the R13 helm is worse than R10, but obviously Lionheart Helm is BIS throughout all of vanilla.
---
So yeah, you hit R12 in Phase 2 and you get to use 4 new items, with 3 of them being significant upgrades. Although using Gauntlets and Legguards over Devilsaur and Shoulderguards over Truestrike Shoulders will reduce your crit vs hit balance by 3, so you'll have a hard time avoiding the crit cap with that gear, especially since Rallying Cry is available in Phase 2.
---
Of course the R14 weapons are crazy (BIS until Naxx), so warrior will still be the most popular ranker class. Just not really because of the other gear.
---
Envious of your availability. Not so much of surgery.
---
There's no downside to getting past him in XP. But you can also train professions and start gathering and such.
---
Create all 12 characters to get their names. Get main to 15 then get main alts out of starting area
---
if you have an nvidia video card give this a try hahaha

World record is 4 days 20 hours /played on his hunter
---
That is fucking hilarious.  You just deleted your magey boi??
---
For sure. I'm going to rush and min/max my main and then take it chill on my alts. I suddenly get to experience both things, checkmate OP.
---
/guffaw
---
Lol at doing charity for the world's highest spending army of the world's number 1 economy. I'm sure some soldier will appreciate the snacks though.
---
pretty sure that's wrong.
---
1) set up my guild charter
---
2) clear ragefire chasm
---
I don't think it has happened since they went to dynamically scaling virtual servers.... So there's that....
---
Another wanderer, here to lick my fathers boots.
---
Expect to farm somewhere beteen 0 and 0 per hour.
---
SS SS SS SS SS SnD/Evisc
---
:p
---
I think grabbing last stand is a good move once you got all your basic stuff down if you plan on tanking a lot.
---
&gt;A bad hunter in PvP is the most ineffective class by far.
---
Lol. Not even close. You can lock down most classes if you do it right. Hunters still have melee and pet damage even if you're in their dead zone. They're probably the most *effective* class to be bad at. I'd rather be a bad hunter in PvP than a bad warrior who gets kited and does no damage or a bad druid who is basically a moving target dummy.
---
The uglier the race the better the racials
---
Literally the majority of people will play a couple hours a day if that. And your trying to rush and min/max completely obligating what made WoW great to new players. The majority of people playing have lives. You wont be left behind if you just take your time and enjoy the game. You will ruin your enjoyment if you try an go into this game hyped like everyone else while at the same time doing things that would take away for the vanilla experience. What's the point of even bringing up vanilla I'd your not even trying to play it? Regardless it will take you 10 days play time to hit 60. Followed by a couple months to even get raid gear. Pick what you want to play. Dont worry about anything else and enjoy the game. When this came launches this sub is going to be a shithole because people didnt just play the game.
---
WHACK
---
Get back to work, peon!
---
Also, be aware we're not getting that patch. Traps have been neutered to 10 seconds maximum. On top of the piles and piles of nerfs hunters recieved every patch back then.
---
This post is too cringe for me, but I'm a Pagle guy. Woo.
---
Yeah, if I ever make a warrior it will be an alt.
---
That way I can feed him strong gear.
---
Ur so kool u got guildies
---
First thing I noticed. That man knows how to have a good time!
---
interesting way for DKP but seems a player that's good with gold can simply buy there gear in a round about way?  leaving others with less feeling maybe a little hopeless if X can get what ever he wants all the time, unless it's a minimal fair amount.
---

I logged into retail, ready to give it an honest go and scratch the itch in these trying times.

I watch 3 other WoW Classic Forums &amp; all are really good: Barrens Chat, [ClassicWoW.live](https://ClassicWoW.live) &amp; MMO Champion. Someone told me to check out the Reddit forum, so I did. It's too bad it is so sub-par. With the size of the reddit community in general I was hoping for something awesome. But to my disappointment, it was not to be.  Au revoir , Reddit,  au revoir .
---
Everything about this post is amazing.
---
It's a hard choice because they both play so differently. If you really don't have that much time to play, then you really don't have to worry about the Hunter damage scaling issue. 
---
It only really starts to show its face once you get to AQ and such. And also, if you aren't in a semi-hardcore guild or hardcore guild, people aren't going to care.
---
Nice read! But people above claim that sceeech was "bugged" and "op" on private servers and wont be as good on official. Dont know whats true or not, i guess will have to wait and see...
---
They are honestly both pretty equal. Stealth and jumping people as a rogue is amazing, but kiting people and killing as hunger is also great !
---
you don't get it, you are not thinking efficiently at all, just go kill yourself grinding to 60 you stupid sheep.
---
created 1 of each type of troll before i settled on T. Druid
---
What always cracks me up about this, is the music you can hear over the raid leaders mic. He's got some like hardcore techno blasting, just really makes the whole situation so much funnier.
---
oH i'M vErY sOrrY yOU gOt Me gOoD
---
All I said was they are a pain in the ass to level. People saying that leveling a warrior sucks to level shouldn't bother you this much, dude.
---
My thought is; "Why is Reddit so popular?" Seriously, why?
---
Even duo, they aren't great. You won't have to stop and drink, but your damage is still bad. Paladins actually work better with a healer because they can AOE mobs down very effectly.
---
Even duo hunter or duo mage would be much faster than a warrior/healer combo.
---
I just wouldn’t double up/overlap on any gathering profs except for maybe skinning. To level herb and mining up can be a bit of a pain as it is, so with two with mining or herb it would take around half as slow to level since you’d be splitting nodes. If I were you, I’d have the warrior take herb/alch as alchemy is SO useful for wars leveling and for you with mana pots - and free action and swiftness potions are great to have if you’ll be on a pvp world.
---
Then comes you, I’d go tailoring for one because it’s one of the relatively easier crafting profs to level , and can give you gear as you level it , and it has the Best in slot robe you can make in phase 1. Your second prof is up to you, I’d recommend mining or skinning.. mining will make you more money in the long run if you’re smart about saving ores to put on the Auction house later, but skinning will net you a nice chunk of change as you level up to 60 (30-40 gold even with vendoring skins). Skinning is also all but guaranteed to max to 300 as you level with how many beasts you’ll kill, mining can be a bit tough as some of the stretches are tough to level quickly (tin to iron, mithril to thorium, etc). Enchanting could be another fun secondary but it will be a gold sink as you level - which night not be felt as hard honestly since you’ll have another person to support you. Enchanting can be profitable but usually the sheer amount of money you need to dump into it to level up turns a lot of people off to it
---
So can someone ELI5 what the # vs = means?
---
just read it man, I know this sounds dumb but the more you read the quests the easier it will be to pick out locations and objectives
---
Gotta make sacrifices for the grind my man
---
I can guarantee you that the 1 or 2 people that are being toxic towards retail players are either trolls or exaggerating. There's a reason one of the biggest argument points for legacy servers is the community, and that reason is because there is such a huge one. You'd always find a buddy questing along with you to invite to a group, a friendly mage who'd drop what they were doing to make you some free food, or a big ol' 60 to fuck up whatever hordie/alliance member was ganking and corpse camping you. Trade chat, and like 90% of generals were always active, and people were practically begging you to join their DM group in westfall. The community for Classic is going to thrive, whether or not the actual game does.
---
Make a shadow priest.
---
This is me. Started the game as alliance, eventually went horde and haven't looked back... Until now.
---
I'm going back to my roots as alliance.
---
Not super hard but you'll be drinking after literally every mod, thankfully you can make your own water
---
You don't farm lotus specifically, you get em while on routes looking for other herbs. They're just kind of a bonus if you find them
---
I'm a shift worker with a young kid.  The only way I'm going to see a raid is when I have a weekend off and someone organizes a PuG.  I don't care though.
---
 I've been playing Path of Diablo in my free time since the season reset and time has been flying by. I've been watching YouTube on the side while farming shit on my Sorc. I highly recommend it if you're a fan of diablo 2 and haven't tried it.
---
This is a true statement but I’d rather be spending money on consumables that I can’t farm myself personally. Fishing is a globally available farming skill to all players.
---
True. At least it wasn't hand surgery.
---
What are the best spots to experience world pvp at lvl 60? I'm gonna make it my main effort and I'm trying to figure out diverse fun spots that will provide action.
---
Apparently the BRD entrance is one, I also tough about farming spots where other lvl 60 will be, like black lotus, dragon scale and devilsaur.
---
Any other suggestions of where to find lvl 60's to fights out in the world?

Not a huge fan of casters! Although I have seen their face melting powers
---
It’s good to know there’s a /console command and I’ll play with it. It’s more that while playing the stress test I was surprised by how much blood there is in Classic and probably was in Vanilla.
---
It’s kind of a relic of 2004 gaming... I guess blood gave a game edge. So if they cranked those blood “spell effects” down for Classic, it’s still more than enough cartoon blood for 2019 standards. 
---
Not getting on a soapbox here to denounce video game violence. Just saying it’s like playing Mortal Kombat 20 years later and I kinda cringe at how radical and awesome tween me felt about blood explosions and fatalities.

Fuck he just told me he wants Sham and I go druid... Horde sucks though

I've always considered the 10-pound mud slapper to be BiS for ALL classes.
---
This is a horrible idea
---
Is ElvUi compatible with addons like questie, or other addons that use map/quest interfaces?
---
I like the look of ElvUi, and I use it on some toons on retail, but I dont want to lose utility using it.
---
Says the dude trying to shame people for playing female characters. Fuck off
---
It is though. You've literally seen all the content at that point. The ONLY thing that you can do from that point onwards is doing the SAME stuff with the numbers tuned higher. "bUt U dIdN'T dO MyTHiCC +67 and WoRlD fIrsT MyTiCc &lt;insert raid boss&gt;" is such a pathetic excuse lol. Raid finder is literally the endgame of retail, no matter how you try to twist it. You can beat the final boss of a patch/expansion the same day you ding max level. Fact. Unless you literally have nothing to do with your life there is zero incentive for even trying the "higher numbers" versions because the gear gets reset every patch anyway.
---
How would I fap?
---
Great work, as a noob cat trying to catch up atm these kind of things help a lot! There's one thing I'm curious about and that's Fist of Omokk as BiS instead of Manual Crowd Pummeler. Is it simply what you wear as a stat stick when you're not using MCP's charges?
---
Very easy. I started off vanilla as a hunter and then swapped to mage a little after the AQ event. In my experience, mage was far easier than hunter for several reasons:
---
* Food and water were extremely important in vanilla and mages could make it for free.
---
* Teleporting and portals were also huge. Saved me a ton of time.
---
* I could solo practically all the elite mobs that a hunter could, sometimes better. Just keep rank 1 Frostbolt on your spell bar and you could kite forever.
---
* Poly was much more reliable than traps.
---
* Pretty much guaranteed a DPS spot for dungeons cause of the aforementioned reasons. You provide your party with free chow, a spammable CC, great DPS, and a free ride home.
---
Here are the downsides no one talked about as a hunter:
---
* Dealing with the [dead zone](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Dead_zone) was annoying. Either I had to run away far enough to used my ranged abilities again or I had to run in to Wing Clip so I could gain some distance again.
---
* You had to buy ammo back then, so practically every hunter went Engineering to craft Thorium Rounds (Blizz eventually added in an NPC that allowed you to trade these for Thorium Arrows if you used bows) for the premium DPS. I stuck to the cheap stuff but still, it adds up. Mage DPS was free.
---
* You had to buy food to keep up your pets' moods. If you didn't, you compromised their performance and if they got angry enough, they'd straight up abandon you permanently. Pets also ate different kinds of foods so if you had a diverse stable you needed a buffet to keep them all happy. I was a cheapskate so I mostly used a turtle cause they ate bread, which mages could make for free.
---
* Had to start all my own dungeon groups. No one wanted to bring a hunter.
---
The only fun part of playing a hunter is that everyone said they were garbage at PvP and I became infamous for being one of the best PvP players on Eredar as a hunter during classic. It was also fun completely dominating rogues with the old Hunter's Mark.
---
But when I swapped to mage, the skills I honed as a hunter made PvP a total joke. I regularly beat fully purped out warriors in duels while I was completely naked. Warlocks and rogues were the only classes that were tricky. They were about a 50/50 toss-up depending on how lucky I got with crits.
---
Fake casting, long CD of CS?
---
Holy hot damn that went right in the nostalgic feels. I'm so pumped I might burst.
---
A lot of that 700 billion goes towards unpopular missions and bloat.
---
Active personnel really appreciate receiving pick-me-ups.
---
but but but... thats obviously a hunter trinket.
---
No time for that. Gotta make sacrifices for the grind.
---
Elwyn forest. I gave you a chance and you still messed it up. :(
---
Playing alliance on Tich?
---
Go alliance
---
Check out shadow.tech
---
Been really happy with it. Playing high end PC games on a low tier iMac
---
Depends on how crowded your server is and where you're looking.  
---
They have a 1 hour respawn timer and limited spawn locations.  I think there are a few zones that have them (winterspring and EPL at least) and in those zones a few areas they can spawn. 
---
Needless to say, when there's competition for them, good fuckin luck.
---
i agree with this, you can even use it whilst playing, put it on the leg of your desk and use it. i actually have a gym in the house, i use lots of resistance bands (my wife more than I - for the booty days, but she makes me use them for booty days too &gt;.&gt;). thats a good idea, you might catch me doing some resistance band workouts at the desk! :D thanks!
---
I don't actually care; I threw out bait and you both bit. Thank you; I'm smiling pretty hard at your 'fuck off'.
---
Yesmeansanal
---
If I had a dollar lmao
---
Why bother replying when I said a "BAD HUNTER", and you start with "if you do it right". Isn't that the point? If you don't do it right? If you don't do it right with a mage, you can still sit and cast frost bolts while blinking occasionally and frost nova. That will honestly give you a fair shot at winning. A lock (one of my mains) can fear, toss dots, spam shadowbolt. You don't have to be good for that. You can suck at managing pets, put them on auto skill use, and still kill a portion of people. A bad hunter, who cant use CC effectively, will get absolutely stomped to hell. Completely stomped.
---
Nelf Rogue. Gonna do it again.
---
I can't really fit a schedule as I've got a 4 month who could crack it any any moment, so I'll just have to PUG it till I make it.
---
Dude.
---
Who cares?
---
Play what you want. Ret paly for life.
---
Love your class. It's a long grind
---
Wow, somehow I've never seen this. It's so good! Thanks for the share.
---
I'm going to murder that child someday
---
For the Horde
---
nah skip it I'll wait. fuck that noise.
---
I've been getting into the WoW nostalgia what with Classic coming out and then I remembered this.
---
Ya know its funny i just had a warlock on a pserver and all i remember is getting by them and skipping if at all possible because they were terrible! I just cant remember specifically what they resisted lol
---
That’s why I’m so torn between them both I really love them both.
---
New to the Classic hype, used to play BC through Panda, here’s my question:  
---
how much of the new UI will be in the classic servers? Will there be raid finding? Also what’s the best place to get concise info on the classic release? Thanks!
---
oh fuck man, im a fucking idiot tried to fix it but its still messed up, but as i said tommorow ill update it again
---
Hunter main, rogue alt. If you find yourself gravitating towards the rogue then you'll just switch:)
---
This right here. Where is Will Smith to wipe my memory from anything WoW related???
---
What about ironfoge ? :P
---
Play what you think is fun. Get into raids isnt an issue an by the time AQ even hits you would have bonded with your guild.
---
Glad you enjoyed. I remember someone sharing this on the forums a few days after it came out. Hits me in the feels everytime I have seen it over the years.
---
A human warlock. I leveled him to 60 in vanilla, got him to 70 in TBC, then rerolled to a Boomkin (which I still play today). At one point, I leveled him to 80 in Wotlk, but it never really stuck. I tried leveling him but stopped at 82 or something - I just didn't like new-warlock. 
---
He's still on that server today. His bank is full of priceless artifacts like ancient quest items, brewfest mugs, random junk that I was farming, and most importantly, all of the Dreadsteed quest items.
---
I doubt that I'll ever play him again considering I moved my main over to a new server and don't play on the old one anymore. He will probably stay there forever. :(
---
I remember seeing druid and pally tanks all the time in vanilla dungeons. There is no worry.
---
that too, idk whats wrong with me, ill fix it tommorow
---
i do not suggest this, you get spells every 2 levels and you will not be able to learn your spells. i didnt do it as a druid, i did it as a mage going to teldrassil. there is also no training. you will feel a huge difference between the lvl 4 and 6 spells, and 6-10 is even bigger. if its something you really really want to do, then you can obv. but you will have to fly back every 4-6 levels to learn your spells to make it at all bear-able (pun intended). 
---
if this is really want you want to do. then do it, but if youre looking to level at a good rate, do not.
---
&gt;It was something standing out, a community and a world, hence why it was so successful.
---
That was something offered by plenty of MMORPG's before World of Warcraft and they weren't nearly as successful. There's more to it than this romanticized notion of World of Warcraft, such as being accessible (a first among MMORPG's, basically), and building of a well-known and hugely successful franchise (Warcraft RTS series).
---
Besides, the amount of people who fall in love with a game badly enough to keep playing it _after they're bored_ is a distinct minority. Those that do often end up resenting the game, and you saw no small amount of criticism from these types of players _during_ vanilla Warcraft.
---
Back in 2005 when World of Warcraft came to Europe and before 2006 virtually everybody I knew bought and tried World of Warcraft. By the time January 2007 and TBC came around it was me and 2 other people who still played.
---
Don't get me wrong, I liked Vanilla and I'm excited to play Classic but you've got some blinders on. It was, and hopefully still is, a good game but it was still just a game among others.
---
Torn between druid and hunter.  Played a rogue at 60 up to naxx in vanilla and had a warrior alt that i ended up maining in TBC.  Had a hunter I got to 40 that was fun to play.  
---
I love the old mechanics of finding, training feeding pets, but I also love the idea of having stealth.  I also like dwarves but can't have stealth on a dwarf hunter.
---
Can anyone give me some encouragement one way or the other to help me decide.
---
Hmm I like this answer
---
If you don’t after BWL then your raiders are subpar..... hunter is designed to be last place dps due to a failure of blizzard foresight.
---
Having leveled both a holy paladin and prot warrior in vanilla, mage is absolutely easy mode. I've never played a hunter, but I wouldn't worry at all about a mage. You're sitting in the top 20% for sure.
---
Does this macro work?
---
/camp
---
/script ResetInstances();
---
Nelf Rogue, still have him on retail and max him every expansion more so out of habit than anything else. 
---
I've recreated him, same appearance as well but a different name. In vanilla I didn't care about names so I just picked some nonsense from the random name generator.
---
Tanks don't ask questions, they give orders.
---
If I remember correctly, it would be like 1 in two or three hours or something.
---
The most I ever got out of Remote Desktop was to check my mission board in WOD. Even moving the slightest bit is such a pain.  You could always relocate your desktop to a location more suitable to tending to your baby. 
---
That being said, babies are pretty dang resilient. I have a, almost, 4 year old and I haven't really lost any gaming time involuntarily. Keep the baby monitor near you, and if you are needed, you will hear it. Even play with no game sound if it's necessary. 
---
Of course with this, you would have to be ok with dropping whatever you are doing and just letting the game sit there, and what happens happens. 
---
Parenting is important and should always be priority number one, but kids also don't require constant hovering. Sometimes a baby cries for no reason but sometimes it's because they shat themselves. You have to be comfortable with the decision and always keep in mind that the baby comes first.
---
I mean anyone that's playing on Herod has this issue xD so yeah same boat
---
About eight years ago, I interviewed at Blizzard and entry level programmers were hourly and so a big chunk of their pay was overtime during crunch.
---
Not sure if that’s changed in the intervening years, but that’s my understanding circa 2011.
---
Stop telling other people how to enjoy the game. If they want to plan their leveling then it's because they WANT to. 
---
Clearly this is something you're unaware of, but people play games in different wants to enjoy different things about games. Just because you don't like something doesn't mean people shouldn't play that way.
---
my work year has been changed a bit and when  classic  launches i normally  have a month or two off instead I will be doing 12 to 16 hour days till December  so yeah I'm in the same boat, I will just be going super hard on days off and running on an hour less sleep to get an hour in at the end of my day. 
---
free time that I cant play will be looking at classes, specs, gear, spells, plays, planning maybe the AH so I can make some gold. if I have time. 
---
no harm in being a little late to the game it will still be there :) and bonus things will have settled out server population  wise, q's will go down, wont be as much competition  on quests, people will  have gear you need but they already got. so there are positives
---
Just play the game, stay off these forums, stay off youtube, stay off twitch. Gold is valuable. Auction House is valuable. Enjoy. Fun.
---
As far as I can remember, a Dwarf Paladin.
---
How does well does holy/disc priest grind at level 60?
---
tldr endgame was great, Can't wait for next phase.
---
I need a map of every horde or alliance FP so I don’t waste time wandering around the zones. Does anyone know of an overarching map like that or will I have to do what I always did and google an area and the world flight path until I find someone circling in area in red on the map within a forum
---
Would upvote this twice if I could. So many players are talking about rolling warrior because it’s “best dps” and 90% of them will never have the gear to see their Fury spec out-dps their Arms spec. 
---
Play what you want.
---
Out of curiosity, which CS-server did you guys play on?
---
Casual guilds certainly form around the players you level and group with.  It's not surprising not to find them yet.  Creating your guild before the game even launches doesn't sound casual ;)
---
I'm relatively hardcore and still don't plan on joining a guild till I know a few people through our leveling together.  Whatever guilds say on websites and discord is never what they're actually like.  Better to take your measure of their leaders and officers through ingame play and then decide your guild.
---
Sadly learning ended 15 years ago, if only this was a whole new game in the same type of environment, you would have a great point.
---
Human priest.
---
I'm wondering if GM-Island is out there. 
---
Also not sure the polymorph trick to get to Old Ironforge will work in the new engine.
---
Man it rained and my webs been gone all day.  Joana gets a tornado and it’s back in an hour.  I’m glad he’s okay though when I first started reading this my heart sunk :(
---
Hunter still is pretty good in PvP and even moreso in wPvP. Don't underestimate their kiting abilities. Plus ramping up your aim shot by freeze trapping someone feels GOOD. If you are worried about the pvp aspect, both are good choices. But it isn't going to be a gigantic difference other than how the two classes play. So if all that was hindering you from playing hunter is that "rogue's are way better." Then you should probably roll hunter.

---
Prob going to depend on server, and luck with queues. If no queues, MIGHT be doable. One guy can't get in for 4 hours, you're gonna get fucked. If you're on Herod, you're probably going to get fucked.
---
Anyone starting on Herod probably shouldn't make any plans about how much or how fast they will level :)
---
The specific act of healing is not fun in raids and many times you will get unwarranted blame in a dungeon group.  Being an important part of a group is fun though.
---
No raid finder. No dungeon finder. No teleporting without a warlock. 
---
Not sure what other parts of the new UI you’re talking about, but no mount shop, no gold shop, no pets, no achievements.
---
To all those looking at this now, log in and check if your characters are still on Herod. Hs received no notification, he received no email, no request. It was done without him entirely.
---
He made the characters on Herod the day of name reservation and now all those characters are on Stalagg which didn't exist when he made the characters.
---
I'm trying to see if others experienced this beyond my group.
---
Esfand is a shitter.  He'll take bullshit items he shouldn't have prio on as well.
---
I think if a ret is filling a warm body when you're struggling to cap out 40 people it's worth taking them.  But they need to LoH, BoP, buff, and aura properly similar to all hybrids needing to fill their class speciality even if  "meme" spec.  So in that regard they do a lot more thna just DPS... But certainly you'd rather a holy pal and just more solid DPS if you had a pick of th elitter.  But most guilds will just need solid attendance so I'd take 1 ret if he was reliable and filled his class role.
---

Well what is your end-game goal? Feral can find a raid spot as DPS/off-tank, and hunter will find a spot. Druids are ideally healers in end-game though.

---
Stealth is cool, but not that cool. Druids are fun because you are a dash of rogue, warrior, priest. You have to really be in to druid themes to want to play it in classic. Since you basically suck in all roles.
---
I would say go hunter. It's a fun class that has a lot of good elements to it. You also get the animal element with hunters and it has a lot of depth as well. I would argue more than druids. 
---
Fwiw, I have mained druid for 10 years and will be rolling one in classic again. Hunter was the funnest class I played, but I just love druid lore so damn much.

Could someone explain what the numbers mean please?

Dungeons or questing, or a mix? Honestly leveling primarily holy will be ideal. You'll heal them without worrying about tanking, and healers get pretty much instant invites. 
---
Paladins are poor tanks so going that route is not ideal.
---
which just comfirms to me that my plan to prostitute myself on my priest to any warr that will level with me is a good one. Seems simple, you kill it I heal.

Thats untrue. When Onyxia flies into the air, rogues should be shooting her.
---
As much as I’d love it to be a thing, I think Blizzard has gotten wise to the wall jumping stuff. I’d be surprised if that stuff was left in the game since the technology has advanced so much.
---
It was when it first released, don't remember how quickly it changed though

Wasn't the energy regen too high in the beta, too? I'm gonna level a hunter first this time so I can fund the rogue. I want a cushy ride for once.

This post is full of garbage. 
---
1. Please post proof of your 4d10h time in 2005. You would be the world record holder if you could show proof. 
---
2. No one in world first contention actually plans to go 3-4 days without sleep. That’s insane. That’s how you die. You will get lapped to hell and back by players who are actually getting consistent (although still quite little) sleep. 
---
3. there’s no such thing as getting an “insurmountable early lead.” Any lead generated early can *certainly* be overcome with proper routing. 
---
4. *numerous* players are going to break 5 days played on launch. The amount of effort that has been put into routing in the last 15 years is insane. 5d /played will be a poor time for someone actually attempting to compete. I would expect the world first time to be somewhere in the 3-4d range. 
---
5. Rested exp was not a major part of the strategy for Joana or other serious speed runners. Not back then, and not now.
---
I'm salaried too but also unionized, so we have paid overtime. It's not 1.5x overtime, but much better than nothing.
---
I have a question, ad someone who has no experience in Vanilla (I started in WOTLK). If I'm building to be more of a healer (I looked at builds for ideas and think I'll go for a Moonglow based one, probably no points in feral), do I still shift into cat/bearform for better DPS when doing world content? Or just stay in normal form for wrath etc?
---
&gt; Frostbolt as my only damage spell all the way to 60 and nothing else, including melee and wand
---
It's ok but definitely not as good as Holy PvP so you can kind of annoy people be being in a group and being Ret. Same as being a spriest in a group - you're ok, but people would much prefer a support priest.
---
People respond to hope.  Future state analysis is part of our psychology, some more than others.  If someone asks you to invest in them but they themselves have put no thought in the future, they might be disappointed in the response.   I hope you will have convincing explanation, even just a single sentence, whenever someone asks what your plan for the future is.

If you choose a Shaman you're not going to be doing 3 things at once, not in a group anyway. You'll never tank, you'll either DPS or heal, and if you DPS sometimes you'll help with healing.

My memory is yes, but that depends how you are defining "low level."  I remember most of the lower level stuff you can even tank with hunter pets if you do it right.    
---
I was mostly a PvP player, but my guess is going to be "yes," although you may need to build up a spare set of gear on the side, so you at least have gear for it even if you are off spec.

!remindme 1 month
---
I ain’t no god damn son of a bitch
---
If memory serves, you will need to grind Org rep.  Leveling in durotar might help but it probably won’t be enough.
---
professions, really you should take what you enjoy  what works for you and your class but have someone who is a gathering mining, herbing, someone  with skinning, enchanting and alchamy are your friend.  alchemy  and herbing go together
---
  like black smithing and mining.  skinning  and leather working. I seem.to remember people going tailoring  and enchanting, mining and engineering work together, engineering  can be alot of fun with the different  gadgets you make 
---
but everyone should pick up cooking, and first aid absolutely
---
You can play WoW for free up to level 20. I would say download retail and just mess around, see how you like the controls, keybinds, camera, combat and other systems. It could also give you inspiration on what class and race to choose.
---
Ultimately, it comes up to what you want to play. Don't base your decision on what others think, play what you want to. If you mess up, or turn out to be a godly healer, you are always doing your job, which is to heal. It is true you will get blamed for peoples fuck ups, but rarely receive props for when you successfully heal through an entire fight. Tanking is fun, healing is fun, dps is fun.
---
Buncha fucking nerds. 👍👍👍👍👍
---
Heal of death ;)
---
Can confirm, tested this myself. Had to go back to Razor Hill.
---
I don’t. Server merges are bad once, layering is terrible for months. Would you rather rip off a bandaid and suffer some sharp but short pain or slowly feel it off with long and continuous pain?
---
Technically correct, the best kind of correct.
---
Also even if he didn’t have a real life deep down most of us would be jealous so GTFO
---
And why would you not want that? Imagine classic is so popular that 9 months later the playerbase is just as big as it was at launch.
---
But NOOOOOO, You guys want to cry.
---
I literally just liked one part of the video and can't find which one it's in so was hoping someone might know at the top of their head
---
If you decide to award DKP for donation, the amount of DKP should be dynamic and set based on market value at the time instead.
---
Fixed values wont work well, because of market fluctuations.
---
Be the warlock we'll all love in our party and make full use of CoR when they get to 30%, I beg of you!
---
thanks!
---
I printed the same map a bit smaller on pvc. It's a bit dark though.
---
Purple epics, as opposed to the other coloured epics
---
I believing raid finding is, perhaps literally, the thing the classic community would be the most against.  So that is unlikely to happen.
---
if you sub now you can use the drop down menu on Play World of Warcraft and turn it into Play World of Warcraft Classic.  It will take you to the Server select screen where you can create a character on a server to make sure you get a name you want, and to save a spot on the server as they are beginning to fill up and wont let you create new characters on that server come release day. you get three names per account so maybe spread them to a few servers so you have better luck with queues come release day
---
We would assume you can use whatever you would think would get you there the fastest, newest rank included.
---
Amen brother!
---
What you mean?
---
Yup. Ice Barb Spear basically invalidates every weapon in the game from lvl 51 green through to the best 60 blues, which is probably 4 or 5 weapon upgrades over 6 weeks for most people. Yes it's nice to get, but it's also a good thing it won't be around for a while as well. It's a mini catch up mechanic basically.
---
It's great, but it's a drop from a boss, so you'll need to be lucky. 😅
---
I hope it will drop for us!
---
Oh man so I’m not even near the stadium w my estimate
---
Don't undervalue leveling. Classic leveling takes a long time and she simply won't make it if she doesn't enjoy leveling.
---
At endgame, a hunter just autoattacking and spamming abilities will do 80% of the damage of an "optimal" rotation. Main things is making sure she doesn't leave pet on aggressive and turn growl off in dungeons.
---
He can get explore xp, dunno where he gets the gold to buy frostbolt though. Beg in a major city I guess.
---
Im entering this experience with literally zero expectations my friend, I'm not hyped because I'm not invested into this. I just wanted some tips as a new player so i don't waste my time with silly decisions. I'm not asking what race, faction etc. to play, just some tips. I appreciate your time u/ChocolateMilkWarrior thank you
---
I never got my rogue geared (epics) back in the day so I want to do it again and see if I can this time.
---
Is there a way to hide your XP bar?
---
It’s the best
---
I'd pick rogue any day. They are just way more interesting in PvP. They can sneak up on people, take out strays, have ways to escape. Warlock has to rely on teammates to help you most of the time
---
Yeah, Shadow Priest involved a lot of wanding lol.
---
Honestly thank god. Wow got way too casual for my liking. What about gimps like MCing people off cliffs
---
Spamming 1 and 2?
---
&gt; Pet loses nearly all its happiness if it dies
---
IIRC, that isn't so bad. Pets are much easier to maintain at 1.12 than launch.
---
Ha wtf? Gl finding the content. It's not a waste of time to find a new tank because you can friend the better tank and do thousands of dungeons in the future with a better player. What do you think?
---
good luck getting a cast of against double pushback and a 1.0 pet.
---
Always save your cloth, level first aid, and if you have a chance grind humanoids when you can. Bandages are far faster healing than food and can be a life saver in pvp as well with a clutch intim shout -&gt; bandage.
---
That is one of my few complaints with Wow. It's always been designed to reward players more for raiding with the largest possible amount of people (40 man in vanilla, and then in Wrath when they had both the 25 man loot was better), when 5 and 10 man content has always been more interesting/fun IMO. Your individual actions have way more impact, and instead of just using 1 or 2 abilities you actually need to use most of your toolkit to play optimally. The other great thing is it's more personable - on the smaller scale you get to know the people you're playing with a lot better.
---
[Here's a link to Wowhead's article on the topic.](https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow)
---
I used to love the ability to pull threat then ice block at times like this with a frost mage. This time im rolling shaman so we will have to learn how to manage threat.
---
Only end game.
---
Thanks for the response. Is it going to be a carbon copy of vanilla wow?
---
RemindMe! 80 days
---
Got me there. In that case my answer is 165,000
---
They are the gold vein of herblizm
---
Ok yes, once you hit lvl 1 it starts.
---
ahaha, my friend got Seinfeld on Stalagg
---
I feel like a lot of classes experience this, aside from some pure DPS ones. Do mages or Warlocks? I don't recall.
---
is it really shitty if i enjoy it?
---
You should put a disclaimer on the title for players who've never played Vanilla or new to WoW. There are a good number of us who have done 1-60 2,3,10+ times already. While leveling is indeed a fun part of the game for some (a lot) of us the game doesn't even begin until 60 (raids, PvP, professions, making gold, etc). Many of us are coming back primarily for the social aspect of the game because we've already seen every square inch of Vanilla already. Some people literally just want to fish all day. Different people enjoy different aspects of the game and that's what makes Vanilla/Classic WoW so great.
---
I’m in the same boat, but I’ve decided to play rogue. Nothing beats not being seen and leaving combat whenever you please.
---
I’m going Orc for those Cold Blood/Blood Fury crits. It’s gonna feel real good. The AP buff/stun resist is god tier for a rogue.
---
Im sure there is gonna be some addon but you can swap it for a reputation bar if you are grinding any rep out so it shows that instead.
---
tbc or woltk i think
---
But what do YOU want to play?! If he’s your friend, he will deal with it and you will get more enjoyment from the game.
---
Orc Warlock, however I didn’t play him for long and switched to a blood elf paladin.
---
Shouldn’t bear form a note quest spell, too?
---
Paladins mostly autoattack their way to 60. They almost never stop, but its slower than most. Warrior is the only class that can be slower than a paladin.
---
Just FYI military members and troops don't see that money and generally live in terrible conditions
---
Its just slow. Pulling 1 mob at a time is not a meme.
---
Running dungeons helps a lot.
---
Assuming you're levelling affliction: get instant corruption and improved drain soul. After that get imp be in demon and then continue on in afflic. Shouldn't have too many issues leveling with VW then.
---
&gt; but also, "have fun getting 1-shot by a hybrid"
---
Not to mention the phenomenon he's referring to hasn't been possible for a very long time.
---
Actually, you're a fucking parody of yourself and you don't even realize it lol.
---
You can't hurt me with your words, you significant little man.
---
I've decided Hunter pve, druid pvp
---
It's actually good for both parties to exist, the slow levelers get out of the way of fast ones, and fast levelers get out of the way of slow ones, making each zone a tiny bit less crowded.
---
If we were all tryhards, it would suck for everyone.
---
Play rogue, they’re the best for any duo comp imo. They control the fight.
---
Both Dungeons and questing.
---
Not well at all
---
Most reliable classes in wpvp besides rogue?
---
Once I hit 60 and pre-MC gear out, I will probably start a new character. And then again There is nothing entertaining or interesting about MC&gt;BWL&gt;AW&gt;NAXX. I did it already. There is nothing to prove there. But what is interesting is that an old state of the game has been renewed that has unique community and world (pvp) interactions, that make the leveling and initial max level content experience incredibly different than what retail WoW is. I will enjoy 1-60.5 over and over while Classic WoW lives. The trap though is treating Classic like retail and turning it into some grind fest.
---
I would go Night Elf Male specifically for the death animation. They make more noise when they die which to me is them really trying to sell the play dead act
---
It's mostly the discord servers probably. If you take a peek into their lfg, it's hilarious. People looking for last few party members to do 16h per day for the first week. Doesn't sound fun to me, but I see the appeal of wanting 60 early
---
Weak burn
---
80 hr weeks with no overtime? how could that even be legal
---
Thank you, I plan on going in with a blank canvas and not spoil anything with videos.
---
Imagine being so entitled that you think anyone showing some personal responsibility is bootlicking.
---
I recall reading somewhere that when targets flee they always do a 180 turn from where you're currently standing. So you could position them in a way where they run away from mobs that could aggro.

Anyone know of a voice recognition program I can macro so I can just yell frostbolt! out loud and save my fingers holy shit
---
I think it's kids born after 2010.
---
Pretty much up until your mid 50s and even more so for certain dungeons. Granted that you have a specialised set for that role
---
Honestly just go Holy. You'll outheal any damage they have. You have 2 CC too.
---
Thank you
---
I generally like boogie but I understand some of the dislike. His "Some of us just  want to go home" really hit me.

Belf warlock. The character started as a human in 2007 and turned belf at the start of classic as my friend group changed and they all played Horde at the time. Same group is going Alliance so my warlock is back to being human, but I’d rather be UD so I can munch on some gnomes.
---
So serious question...am I a pussy if I want to play hunter?
---
I'm hoping for 1 central time zone server
---
Desu, no tips for senpi, OwO.
---
Crunch time is never awesome.
---
Dang. That's sad to hear.
---
I've been looking for something like this.  Thanks.  No questions.
---
They literally had to build a system (war mode) to get people to even acknowledge each other in the world.
---
I'm gonna do both, nice slow RP time with my friend, Super hardcore epic gamer mode on an alt. Still trying to pick my classes tho.
---
I gotta agree, definitely go to work on Monday, you're not going to miss anything by not being in your chair when the clock ticks over, just look at the bfa and diablo 3 launches.
---
&gt; Improved Overpower giving you 100% crit chance on Overpower.
---
Man, I miss that.  I remember running around AV with my Unstoppable Force exploding rogues with Overpower.
---
Holy with t2 and stacked spelldmg  was a blast in vanilla. 100% crit holy shock. 
---
And reckbomb with sulfaras was fun but such a waste.
---
My group of 15 friends originally decided to go Horde, because I wanted to play a shaman. But I took my horde pride down because of horde overpopulation! I told my buddies that we should roll alliance and here we are, The Shaman turned Warrior.
---
The same reason it took them 2+ years to port it.
---
To be awake and still playing after working all Monday. :) So thatd be ~8am Mon to 6pm Tue... so up for 34 hours it looks like. I'd be happy with that. Then sleep when servers get busier with people getting home from work.
---
They do it for free.
---
Really? I recall earth shock being the interrupt, while frost shock generated threat and slowed. Maybe it was changed later
---
https://i.redd.it/z5m386ljz8x21.jpg
---
A better analogy would be: 
---
you are in a grocery store and you see that someone has knocked over a jar and it's broken on the floor.   Do you just walk off and assume it'll be taken care of? Or do you go and find a staff member to alert them?
---
a good amount of us did all this back when it was new 15 years ago, the game is figured out and there's little if any left to learn
---
And you could kill people naked with lvl 1 daggers 😅
---
Im Rolling a hunter to try something new. I dread 1-10 😭 It was kinda annoying on the test server. Was sometimes ok with shoot - strafe - shoot. Might party up with some melee until 10+ 😜
---
Missed opportunity,  I was always broke as fuck too
---
None of those ideas would fit well in Classic, IMO.  
---
Until I see an idea that is genuinely better *and* appropriate for Classic specifically, I am all for the current system.
---
I believe one of the major reasons is competitive gamers: They want to min/max, be good at PVP (which means having to raid to get the gear you need to be the best you can be at PVP), and they want to clear all the content of the game (Naxx). As a result, they want to rush to 60 to get the gear ASAP and be ahead of the rest so they can WTF BBQ PWN them.  Anything less seems pointless.   
---
I prefer to do it all as well, but I will also enjoy the leveling experience- most just see it as tedious.
---
How dare you.
---
Don't train every skill at the trainer, only the important ones as they get quite expensive as you level up.
---
Can't read yellow on white.
---
You missed some of the best raiding in an mmorpg ever in MoP.
---
THAT A MAN OF MY STATURE SHOULD HAVE TO WEAR A DRESS
---
I just kept the first weekend free of any other plans, too much real life stuff to do.
---
Everyone is so pale haha I love it
---
But troll is the best race.
---
Yeah I'm starting to get a little triggered seeing all these edits of Hurricane's amazing trailers. This video technically reps him but it's in tiny font at the end of the video....not mentioned in title or description....
---
Are you still talking about classic wow?
---
TIL through shitty watercolors.  It's been a good day.
---
Go alliance and roll a horde alt later
---
Menthil Harbor won't be Alliance friendly if I have anything to say about it.
---
who through? i also want to get one
---
To be fair there are games that don't have a grind.
---
Thank you for the feedback Keanex.  Do you have a link to a specific build?
---
Game hasn’t released yet so the majority of folks could actually be checking it out for nostalgia. We don’t know yet. I’m sure it’ll keep a decent player base though.
---
So yea... been horde for 15 years, made 3 human locks on my chosen realm with different names, never done the ally quests so might be a great time to experience them, no..? Should I go back to the horde? Alliance is lame. Helps
---
I'm worried about everything *but* the endgame: Layering. I won't beat a dead horse, but me and most people who whine about layering are whining because that almost entirely effects the non-endgame experience. It may take me 3 months to hit 60, which isn't blistering fast... but it's fast enough to level *entirely* in a layered world. 
---
Sorry for the off topic, but I just thought to point out that all the whinging about layering is proof that many people aren't just concerned about endgame. They're just as focused on the entire journey.
---
I feel this. I will be able to play at launch and will continue to play until January. Following that I am heading off travelling India/Nepal for 3 months and will have to take a hiatus.
---
My suggestion is if you can’t spell horde, they’re not worth going to.  For the alliance!
---
why dont we moonfire after wrath? to get the dot rolling
---
Have you ever played an actual hard game???
---
Classic was designed for casual players. We played the game as absolut noobs.
---
Today's games are a joke. Doesn't make normal games hard.
---
I know right!!! You couldnt even kite most of the time due to the tight corridors, but most of the mobs also healed. I partied up with another hunter on the test Realm and stood apart, whoever got aggro went melee while the other shot the mob.
---
rouge is nice, but i prefer blush
---
I thidk community will be nonexistent in classic because of layering. It's going to be same retail sharding shit where you see absolutely different people every time.
---
I'm going rogue, but how many rogues will actually make it to 60 and continue  playing is what I'm banking on.  play what you want, you will enjoy it. just dont have unrealistic  expectations  if you are not playing your class to its potential. like your going to have a hard time trying to be a fearl druid when nax comes out. but you will have lot of fun playing around with pvp
---
I like the song and effort tho! maybe just add a 13+14th dayXD
---
yeah me too bunch of friends are getting together to play again.
---
hahaha
---
That is the payment for being a hunter.
---
what classes would those be out of curiosity? And how well geared would you need to be? Sounds like if I'm going to main warrior, an alt should probably be hunter or mage to farm gold.
---
&gt; TBC Arena is awful as private server players have discovered. 
---
Funny, I’ve played a TBC server for well over a year now and enjoyed it.
---
&gt;No one plays 3's which the game is balanced around, because they have no need to.
---
The game isn’t balanced around anything besides maybe endgame PvE. 3s might be more balanced than 2s but that doesn’t mean the game is balanced around it.
---
 &gt;Instead they roll the OP comps in 2's (there are very few of them).
---
Rogue/Lock, Rogue/Mage, Rogue/Priest, Rogue/Resto Druid, Rogue Feral Druid, Rogue/Rogue, Mage/Priest, Druid/Warrior, Druid/Hunter
---
All these comps are capable of rank 1 in 2s.
---
&gt; There is a reason TBC private servers are dead. All that matters is the PVE And the PVE scripting is mediocre and the PvP in TBC is awful. 
---
All private servers are dead. Wotlk servers died before TBC ones did.
---
&gt;WOTLK Arena became ok. The game suffered as the homogenization crept in. 
---
WotLK 3v3 is WoW’s prime PvP-wise. That doesn’t make TBC PvP bad, just, a but worse than the best. WotLK 2v2 was a joke. Look at any pserver 2v2 bracket and you see 40 out of 50 top teams are warrior pala.
---
&gt;Cata/MOP during certain patches Arena was at it's height. 
---
Lol no. Competitive PvP died during cata. Blizzard stopped taking it seriously and many top tier players left.
---
&gt;The game suffered more and more homogenization happened.
---
I agree homogenization sucks. That’s why I like TBC.
---
&gt; In WoD in an attempt to try to resurrect their failed esport (and they wanted to add another failed esport in the MDI) they went all in on homogenization.
---
WoD was just garbage in every way.
---
&gt; BG's have sucked since vanilla. Healers became unkillable gods and all that mattered. There is a reason you stack almost HALF a high rated BG group with them. 
---
Are we talking about retail now? Cause TBC didn’t have rated BGs.
---
&gt;This has been noted by people like Venruki who has said things like "people can actually die" while playing Vanilla PvP. What you do actually matters besides being a healer. You are simply a bad healer if you weren't viable before resilience or think they weren't. They still matter in vanilla, they just aren't broken.
---
On the one hand I’m looking forward to this, but in my mind BGs are for casual PvP and Arena for competitive. I’m not sure if I like the idea of having to be in tryhard mode every time I join a BG. 
---
&gt;TBC Resto druid is completely broken and the only thing that made TBC PvP "ok" for the masses was that healers were often awful players who didn't CC until WOTLK. 
---
We talking BGs or Arena? In BGs I agree Resto Druids are stupidly OP. In arena not so much. Good Rogues will punish any sub-optimal Druid play.
---
&gt;When they incorporated CC and you saw talent roll healers it was broken. It's going to be hilarious when they make TBC and all the arena pros say how awful it is.
---
Which arena pros? Live TBC servers without infinite PvE gear from ‘donations’ would be amazing. Bet you anything that people like Venruki and Snutz would play the living shit out of TBC Arenas.
---
I was in a que during nick reservation. Took me 3minutes to go from 10,000 to zero. Login servers seem to be handling it pretty nicely...
---
If there is something you should be worried about it's  server stability, Infinite loading screens and B.N ques :P
---
Would be amazing if they went tunes ape on it and started a new branch of wow development, following an alternate time line.
---
Dude, you’ve been on reddit for 1 whole year and have only 1 Karma? 
---
You absolutely have not been on often enough to realize all subreddits waiting for a game to come out are like this. 
---
What else are going to post about for a 15 year old game?
---
Feral druid
---
You seem like a cool sibling. Do play the game as well?
---
They will likely have a small update that will force you to restart the game before launch.
---
Hey there knackers, in case you’re sick of hearing “fun”...
---
* Buy new abilities at your class trainer whenever they come available. 
---
Whenever the game seemed too hard, it’s usually because I forgot to pick up new abilities. This can be as critical as Hunter’s learning how to tame a pet, or as seemingly basic as an upranked heal or dps ability.
---
* Set your hearth!
---
One of WoW’s fundamental mechanics (which set it apart from other MMOs of the time) is quick travel. You can only choose one location, which you’ve visited, and the item has a 60-minute cooldown. As soon as you move to a new leveling area, basically, remember to set your quick travel point to the inn.
---
* Learn your class
---
This is when you pick up the guides - but wait until you’re getting closer to level 20. The classes in Classic have a lot of versatility and potential for support roles in groups. Most DPS specs have crowd control (“CC”) abilities beyond their damage abilities. This is what separates good players from the rest. I’d rather take a hunter doing only 80% of their potential max DPS but knows how to trap and control their pet. The hunter who’s riding the top of the DPS meter but letting a mob pound away on your healer while their pet steals aggro off the tank is gonna start the “omg this hunter is so bad lol” conversation in guild chat.
---
* Pay attention to group composition
---
Learn about other classes too, and then adjust your play accordingly. Let’s say you’ve got that super trap master hunter in your group along with a rogue. If you’re on a Warlock, you might have your CC pet out at the start. But once you see that the hunter and rogue have the mobs locked down, switch to your dps pet and just stick to blowing things up. Likewise, let’s say you’re on a lock and grouped with a dps warrior and a shadow priest... you’re now in charge of CC.
---
Everyone has fun in different ways. To me wow leveling is one of the least enjoyable things in gaming, but I love the endgame. So I’ll be burning through the parts I don’t enjoy to play the parts I do.
---
Ok, please leave. Since you never were here in the first place?
---
This seems like a wonderful way of encouraging your players to RMT.
---
In RL many people have the same name. Not sure why wow should be any different.
---
Shaman is incredibly fun to play. That’s the only thing holding me back from 100% committing to alliance. Man, it sucks. Maybe I’ll just have to wait for when they release TBC again lmao
---
I was a 14 year old noob back in the day I'm going to play shaman right this time and wreck face in pvp hopefully (:
---
i see how this could be. but i also see how the guy that is spending his time farming for the guild deserves the gear from the guild. if i spent 6 hours collecting herbs and then made flasks for the guild to use in a raid, and another person used those flasks and pots, i feel like i should be awarded more than he is. i dont know if it would be with gold or with DKP. i put more effort into the guild and raid. i deserve the item that drops. 
---
he could simply farm for the guild also.
---
Hydraxian Waterlords
---
There's always that one asshole...
---
I'd played Warlock at the end of Vanilla and onto TBC. Never played Rogue, but here's why I'd go for Warlock:
---
-Warlocks have a great deal of spells which lend a lot of variety to your gameplay based on the gameplay. You'll be whacking out different curses on different mobs, messing with enemy players and just generally have a more interesting rotation than a lot of classes. You've a big toolbelt.
---
-Warlocks offer more utility to their group than a rogue. With healthstones, soulstones and summons, you'll feel like you're pulling your weight and offering more than just DPS. The virgin rogue, however, can only offer to pick locks and *maybe* ress the healer after a wipe with some engineering defibrillators.
---
-Warlocks have an easier time leveling, probably the smoothest after hunter.
---
-Rogue will likely be the most played class after warrior. There'll be a lot of competition for gear. In addition, you'll find it harder to get into groups both because of that competition but also the generally negative attitude people have toward rogues. Warlocks are underplayed (Alliance-side at least, probably going to be the least-played class after druid).
---
-Warlocks have awesome class flavour quests for acquiring demons and spells, though I'm sure rogue has some good ones too... Never played rogue, though.
---
Its amazing what a decision can do for your quality of life. My sis has twin 1yr olds and a 3 yr old... she looks like a zombie. Grass looks greener on this side. So does my savings.

It doesn't
---
The fuck? Keybinds were def a thing most players just didn't bother with them, even in TBC.
---
I played a Ret paladin in Vanilla. It was ass. Went holy for BWL and let me tell you, Actually doing something to help the raid was more fun then hitting a boss like a wet noodle.

It's from questionablecontent.net, and it's one of the best web comics out there. It's one continuous story, 3 times a week, since 2003. The girl is named Marigold, and she's the typical shut-in, no-social-skill mmo-playing otaku. Well she was when that particular comic was published anyway. 
---
It's not a one-off comic, it's part of a series and on its own it's not that good, but it isn't the kind of comic with a punchline every day.
---
I have my own conspiracy theory. Who'd have an interest to make Classic look bad? People, who run Private Servers. 
---
It started with ways to finance the server, but some realized, they could make a living from the servers. I saw servers, where you could buy level boosts, BiS gear, Mounts etc. for real money. Some even sold complete characters. Often the real prices are obfuscated, by having to buy a fake currency first, for which there are sale events with % discounts when buying x amount of currency.
---
I think, that when Classic is successful, a lot of people will leave the (let's be honest) mostly shitty PServers and that will hurt their profits or even kill their servers.
---
That's why they gotta try to make Classic look as bad as possible, as to make people question, if it is worth their time.

They are amazing for targeting the glutes! Monster walks or just side lunges are great  If you are really serious about gaming then anterior pelvic tilt (belly pushed forward &amp;lower back pain) is going to be one of your greatest foes even if you have decent posture in a chair.  To fight this you want strong glutes, core, and hamstrings , as well as loose hips
---
Durotar’s gonna be such a swamp at release. You’ve got this plan backwards...
---
Did you even read the description of the video? It is literally all there. Credits, links &amp; everything. What more is missing? Flashing neon lights?
---
It's late and I had to read that a few times to comprehend it.
---
Levelling in tank build is a bad idea anyway.
---
I can't imagine vanilla without pvp in the world, it takes away a big part of the experience
---
It sounds fucking awful, but I'm starting to think it might be less awful than raiding on two separate warriors each week which might end up being more time investment for the same end goal (two playable warrior specs).  
---
What would you recommend between hunter and mage?
---
*STVietnam flashbacks intensify*
---
100% agree with you my friend, can't wait to dive back into the adventure. Maybe see you out there!
---
\# Means the lowest fishing skill you need to fish there, so for Tanaris you need 205 Fishing Skill to fish there
---
= Means the skill you need for the fish  to stop getting away, e.g 100% catch
---
If you are confused about some numbers being as high as 400 and above, it's because you can add bait that increases skill by 100 and there are fishing pole that gives extra fishing skill aswell.

I'll sleep when I pass out on my keyboard... literally.
---
I feel like the map is going to end up exactly like the one I see when I hit M by the end of this :P
---
That's because people are picking their names and logging out.  When people log in on day 1 they ain't leaving.
---

Gay stupid kid lol! What a retard!

And normal raids. And heroic raids. And mythic dungeons. And mythic+ dungeons.

This is a cool idea
---
you could also have a friend take the name and hold it while you create your character. then once your character is ready, name typed in, tell your friend to delete their character and click create.

Check YouTube for "Priest Dire Maul grinding."

That'll be your income.
---
Sleeping in a bed or in an inn ( might only be in inns and taverns but you can check online) will give you a 'buff' to experience gained based on how long you logged out for.
---
This boths helps in that grind to lvl 60 (a little, but hey, its all you'll get) and can add immersion to the game. I didnt know this or do this the first time i played in vanilla but will do it every time now.
---
when you're dead you WON'T see any NPCs so be aware of that.
---
You don't have to lvl up unarmed skill it'll never benefit you
---
Fishing, cooking, and especially first aid are your friends
---
Only downside is that you gotta run around in a dress the whole time.
---
he could also log on and play the ah , and make enough gold where he can buy DKP essentially  off the AH or buy gold from a chinese farmer and then buy the items off the AH
---
People aren't picking names for 18 hours and afk dodging. They're taking like 2 mins to make their names and logging off.

I tried 5 times to understand this and I have no idea what you're saying lol

I plan to do the same thing. Early bed on Monday and up at 6-7 and hopefully servers are in better shape and login queues much lower then.
---
and people say balance is a meme spec

Still ripe with spelling mistakes though. Sad times :(

My guild had a system where you could request items be made for you and the guild leaders would decide if it would be helpful for the guild if you got the item

At least they come online and play the game. The worst is the name being reserved but at no point coming online.

Mage will make you decent money just by providing portals and food/water.
---
Keeping up with who? Who in your mind will you be trying to keep up with? Hopefully you can make friends and or find a guild with members whose schedules and play goals are similar to yours.
---
Isnt rake objectively worse than Claw?
---
You'll have around 2 months of leveling in which you'll learn your class in and out (hopefully). Don't be put off by people describing them as hard.
---
You'll probably wind up healing in PvE, though.
---
Buy from AH and flip, there's always some desperate to sell something that they can make a little more money from then a vendor. Also not visiting the AH is almost impossible.
---
Ironically Vanillas grind is tame compared to MMOs of that era. Funny that the original “MMO for casuals” is now being touted as hardcore.
---
holy shit im from nowra as well and i remember this
---
I stay on Everlook, but I will fish a lot and remember you guys.
---
Holy paladin are really great in classic. Best defensive healer in PvP,  mana efficient in PVE and often top meters in raid healing. Youll easily be able to find groups for all endgame content.
---
Ah yes. The Onion. The original high-quality shit-posting.
---
Also, please add a note for seasonal fish like winter squid.
---
I love informative posts like this one.
---
This is why I'm tempted to roll a class I've never played on the faction I've never played. It will be a whole new leveling experience...
---
But fuck the Alliance.
---
Because vanilla hunters use to have a good gameplay with a high skillcap.
---
The 2.0 Pre BC patch and BC ruins this class.
---
They do that on pservers.
---
They definitely dont on classic. They run away in random directions.
---
I don't know, I haven't met them yet

Holy crap you must be one piece of broken trash in real life offending people over nothing like this on internet. Im not even one of them, I ll be taking slow leveling process and enjoying my time in Westfall, chill out

They will for sure rotate the content releases of retail and classic. It’s intended to be that way and probably why it’s on the same subscription.
---
Actually no, just his number one fan; me his sister, who was worried to death about him earlier when a tornado litterly went right past his house. I was watching his interview live on Twitch and knew something was wrong when his feed dropped. So many people watching that interview had no clue why his feed cut and his twitch channel feed cut too. So that is the purpose of the post. It is a love a concern post Mr. Salty Spaghetti
---
Well my ping on NA stress test was 150. And my ping to retail oce is 180
---
Nothing. The horde is cows, corpses and roided green aliens, they live in sewers and mud huts and their main mantra is kill anything that moves. They are dirty, savage, smelly and usually stupid, looking for leadership in the "brightest" of them, the one with the most kills.
---
You have plenty of options. The Classic graphics are "quality 3" on a 1-10 scale
---
Talk to your friend
---
If i stole your wallet it wouldn't be ok just to tell the guy at the liquor you get all the credit for the money I'm spending.

I'm pretty sure classic had poker and tetris addons
---
Complete with a high speed, naked Nelf pursuit through the middle of town
---
This was quite possibly one of the worst things I remember about Vanilla. Everyone starts getting to know each other and it gets too populated and then one day you log in and half the people you knew are just gone.
---
I don't know why there's not a better solution to this 15 years later.

Ahh ok, think you will probably end up ahead of me quite quick, but if I chose your server I'll add you just in case :)

I started a Horde guild for late night players and we'll be rolling on Fairbanks, it's mostly US based players but there's a couple from EU and of course me.

Does it really take 10 to kill an enemy?  Noncrits?  Youd think with frostbite procs/shatter and winters chill you have a pretty decent chance to crit.

What likely happened is during the queueing shenangans to get characters created, his server selection was changed and he didnt notice. Happened to some guildies (although they did notice) I had to log back in and check mine.
---
If you are worrying too much about what everyone else is worrying about.
---
to not try and waste everyone’s time. unless you have a rich knowledge of the game you will not be effective at holding threat and your group will be very frustrated. I know this isn’t what you want to hear but it is the reality. We love the “everyone can do everything” mentality on reddit but it’s just not how things work in this iteration of WoW.

 Deviate Delight fishing parties in the Barrens. GET HYPE!

I have seen people who actually think this, Forgive me for not understanding the joke.

1g in all the pservers I played. Also 1g for 3 stacks of conjured water/food.
---
Well, I say that because it nullifies your point that not many people do Mythic raids. That is all.

Words have meaning in a cultural context and to have the ability to completely ignore their effect upon others is a great example of privilege.

This is gonna be a yikes from me dawg
---
I recall 19 and 39 being the most populated.
---
Sorry for the distasteful reddit joke. Best wishes.
---
I’d go where your guild is. The game is more fun with friends and guildies than not. You can always make alliance on another server for nostalgic reasons. Better to play both sides anyways, you get the full story and experience that way!
---
Same here. 
---
Even booked off from work to play as much as possible. Cannot remember the last time I did that, must have been with Diablo 3...
---
Will watch your vid when I'm back home and not blocked by work!

Now just put a piece of dark green cellophane over each of the works and you'll also have a Duskwood series.

Rolling human lock. Is fighting against undead as well as not having escape artist as a gnome be a huge disadvantage?

Just wanted to check to see if you'll be making any other guides? Rogue/hunter?
---
If you were to look at my old server from Vanillas fourms, you would see how I bring people together. Tons of people offering Gold for my head.
---
I feel like everyone cramming tips and maps on this thread during the interim are subsequently killing some of the buzz for the upcoming rerelease. The expression "not knowing is half the fun" really applies for this relaunch, as most of us aiming to join for classic have already played the game inside out but are fueled by both nostalgia and lack of memory.
---
it takes 5-8 not 10, prob 7 or 8 on avg.
---
i often wonder how people can be soo certain about random shit that with 2 seconds of google can be shown to be bullshit lol
---
This is nice, thank you.
---
Plus in the lore they shame you for using both hands to slay a dragon.
---
While in game they shower you with honor for killing some poor ally who's 9 levels below you.
---
This was so great about classic, different classes and speccs counterprofits other classes and talents.  
---
For example the hunter is hard counter for any spell caster, but countered by melee.  
---
The mage counters the melees, but get hard countered by hunters, warlocks and shadowpriests.  
---
And so on.  
---
Even the rogues should be loosing to high altitude Armor classes in 1v1 world pvp.

You either start out on horde in a graveyard or the desert. Followee by all your questing pretty much in the desert. You type /dance only to be like wtf. You'll spend hours trying to get your horde toon to look good. But you cant. You freaking cant. They are all ugly
---
This is what ended up getting me. I requested two weeks off, beginning the 27th and will be going to work on Monday the 26th at exactly 3pm. I am majorly bummed that my buds will be 8.5 hours ahead of me initially. Hopefully the time off I took will allow for catch ups before I miss dungeon groups with them.
---
I didn't have kids so other than 35 hours at work the rest of my week is free time.
---
It's probably a good change, imo. On private servers people were completely gaming the system to farm max honor as fast as possible with a premade, queuing up specifically to avoid premades from other sides and just pubstomping forever. AV was farmed hardcore. It wasn't really fun for the public player. If you wanted to rank you had to suck up to a few players who controlled the brackets.
---
Leveling is a small portion of time played on a character you stay dedicated to and main in my eye. People should enjoy it how ever they see fit.   
---
Whether that means taking 4 days or 4 months to level to 60 just do whatever you like in the game as an individual and don't let people tell you how to play regardless of what they think is good or bad.
---
I love Tauren. My first character was one so I've a soft spot for them. IIRC you've a greater health pool and a useful AoE stun. Plus a Herb bonus if that's your thing.
---
Orc gets that 25% stun resist that I assume stacks with warrior talents buffing the same thing? Plus I've heard that their axe mastery means that, if you're using an axe, you only need to get up to 6% hitcap rather than 9%?
---
12 slots confirmed? We only had 10 I believe back then, and it got raised in either WotLK or Cata.
---
pretty disingenuous to say that the only difference between raid finder and mythic is that the numbers are tuned higher. mythic introduces different mechanics which require different strategies when compared to lower difficulties that completely alter how you handle an encounter, while yes also requiring more dps and healing. the experiences are completely different and are on entirely different levels of rewarding (in regards to both gear and personal accomplishment)
---
Yes, for Rake to be worse you only need a base weapon damage of 39 at 60, which is literally less than a completely naked lv 60 druid has.
---
Ok think I fell asleep for a bit and woke up to this Herod thing. Seen a ton of things about long ques, why Herod? Did I miss something?
---

Do the warrior talents offering stun resist stack with an orc's racial?
---

---
At launch:  
---
"Bug report: There is DK for some reason in class selection"
---
At Blizz HQ:  
---
"What.. I though DKs exist in Vanilla? Like there was Naxx there must be DKs as well"
---
You're right. In bfa with tokens you don't even have to pay as a multi-boxer to win.
---
I'd argue for most sane players, it's a lame way to play a wonderful and immersive game. And it sucks that multiboxing is the most optimal.
---
However, that is only my opinion. What isn't my opinion is that tokens don't exist in classic and multiboxing will once again be pay to win.
---
I'm sure that can't be fun at all, but sending boxes of candy so that US soldiers can feel better about themselves is not a charitable cause as far as I can see.
---
Yeah but with sharding it shouldn’t be an issue
---
Mained blood elf death knight, but in TBC played undead warrior, so going Orc warrior in classic just to change up the race.
---
Priest + anything.
---
Oops, sorry!

---
Orcbit is one of he more popular ele shamans, he uses Iron grenades all the time in his vids.

---
What you’ll enjoy is seeing a whole new side of the game playing in the other faction. Sure, the zones are the “same” as you level but the towns, quest givers and story that you’ll probably quickly skip through (just like most of us) are all different. Having a renewed and refreshed sense of discovery with your Classic experience after playing Alliance for 15 years will be invaluable and worth it.
---
Stormwind is by far the best city in WoW (followed by Ironforge) but I promise you that Orgrimmar and Undercity will grow on you. They’re fun cities to hang out in. There’s nothing like dancing on top of the Org bank with naked female Tauren players surrounding you or falling into the green slime in UC and cursing at your monitor as you swim towards the stairs to climb out. Good times... Good times... Enjoy it!
---
GTFO this ain't your clout mate delete this shit
---
Thank you Blizz &lt;3
---
and love you &lt;3
---
Ah this makes sense. Thanks!
---
lmao
---
&gt;One guy can't get in for 4 hours, you're gonna get fucked. If you're on Herod, you're probably going to get fucked.
---
Well, since its based on 5 guys getting in, the odds are (no matter what server you are talking about), you are going to get fucked anyways. Herod/Shazz might have 20k queue, with most players that will NOT log out for the first 24 hours.
---
All depends what blizz wants to do. If they keep the server caps at launch and force ppl to move (those who can) or open up more room in the server and deal with the shit later (while kinda hoping a lot of people quit on that server to make it easier).

I used Icosiols horde fishing and cooking guide on youtube to level it on a server, worked great. good videos and good voice. would recommend. made a google sheets with all the info laid out if you want it shoot me a pm.
---
It would help with queue times. Rather than having 3000 people playing and 12000 waiting in queue for those 3000 to log off, 15000 people can play on one server at once.
---
I read "And going homo" 
---
LF brain that doesnt do this
---
In TBC you have one on your person and two more at stable master - I think it is the same in classic.
---
It's hard to say because there's been a big variance in the surveys and what actually happened in the beta and stress test.   
---
   
---
All we can say confidently is Warriors/Mages will likely be the 2 most popular and Druids/Warlocks the two least popular.
---
There is nothing wrong about reserving items as long as you can find other party members, that are ok with it. If you dont like it or find it selfish, one conclusion would be not to join them

Tauren druid, I made back in 2006. It is still my main. Not completely same character as we moved to another server in WotLK and I didn't have money to migrate so I leveled new tauren druid, but I like to think it's still the same character I have been playing all these years. I am planning to play tauren druid again in Classic.
---
No worries friend. :)
---
its a week until launch, many who are planning on playing haven't even sub'd yet, or made a character.. on top of all that, you're worried about stats that don't matter. play what you think it fun.
---
I think its awesome that wow spans 2 generations now.
---
Does that work on freezy boi trap? Seems like it’s for castes abilities
---
You could log into the server discord and check out the "Role-assignment" channel... Everybody who joins picks their faction/class.

May help give you an idea on the current breakdown.

Can you make one of these for Paladin? I love the aesthetic

The majority of the info found suggests that if anything most of classic will be easier than found on popular pservers. That being said no one got a chance to test out DM so we cant be 100%.

Just shared this with my guild leader

I thought auto loot wasn’t standard. Thank god it’s in there.

Can you show it on the map?

patience is a skill
---
I’m not really sure but I’m just gonna sit in the character selection screen probably for an hour prior to launch
---
You level in SM to be efficient, not to dodge PvP then get to the max level for real PvP but we both know you don't know what that is since you're a gutless PvE boy
---
My understanding was most stuff is tankable as a dps spec warrior up to about level 45? You just try and keep your shield and 1h skill up as you level. Someone wiser will no doubt correct me...

I'm looking forward to listening to days of podcasts and netflix while leveling my pally.

Thanks, but I'm not just healing.  In fact, I need to be main tank.

Lemme just check if this post was made by a paladin... aaand yes. Yes it was.
---
&gt;No one in world first contention actually plans to go 3-4 days without sleep. That’s insane.
---
Doesnt mean some accounts wont be PLAYED for 4 days straight.
---
&gt; Rested exp was not a major part of the strategy for Joana or other serious speed runners. 
---
Yeah, ppl are used to private server rested XP numbers that are 2-3x faster than what you actually got in Vanilla or in Classic beta. For the first weeks rush this means absolutely nothing.
---
Hop! This is saved for later!
---
I hope for retail wow's next xpac a trailer is released at blizzcon where various scenes from every xpac are played then it cuts to Thrall suddenly waking up in bed, sweat beading his forehead and says, "Phew... it was all a nightmare." then everything after vanilla is retconned and we start over.

Originally, I was held hostage and forced to play Alliance by a group of oppressive and misguided friends who demanded a healer in exchange for friendship. I was always Horde at heart, bound to slavery by the chains of the alliance bootlickers.
---
That said, play Alliance, they need the help.
---
Whatever it takes.
---
lmao at people who believe this
---
the servers will not be underpopulated.
---
During my 10-day trial at the end of Burning Crusade my first roll was a Male Troll Mage. Then I bought the Battle Chest and rolled a Blood Elf Mage who I'm still playing.
---
I reserved a Male Troll Mage with the same name for Classic. Cosmetics might be different, but the idea remains.
---
And what I'm telling you, is that tanking as a paladin in Classic is not ideal at all. You'll be better off healing your friends when questing and healing a tank in dungeons.
---
Esfand is a loot whore clown. We all know this.
---
This is such a small brain take. Surely you must recognize certain statements and words can be offensive to others. There’s a reason (decent) people no longer use gay as a derogatory term. 
---
You’re suggesting that the recipient of prejudice is the one that should responsible for taking the moral high ground? Obviously that’s absurd; platitudes like the one you parroted off are intended to maintain power structures.
---
They are making their own group with their own restrictions. If people don't like it they can just ignore that group and make/join another.
---
Honestly every Alliance player should experience the Barrens at least once during the first few months. It's something else.

Thunderbluff is by far the best city to chill in.So peacefull...

A cap is a great idea. I used dkp  for a while in diffrent  forms, it can be a very fair system  based on who shows up the most but sucks with a hot item when you lose alot or people who hoard  it like crazy and low dps until they can get all items for super cheap and be ahead on the next raid release, I'd say one of my more interesting  uses of it was blind bidding. 
---
if you can get a fair loot council with accurate  user tracking is best imo
---
Yep.

im in the classic wow oceania discord. there's over 5k members. the people you see talking are a small group of people, probably around ~30. i mean, shit, half the text on the discord is from one guy (knocked).

If a gm or dev reads this they really should. It'd be so easy for them to do that from a good angle and would make a great video.
---
Hi there! I'm usually a try hard min/maxer and it's gotten a little disappointing with the idea that mage rogue and warrior are going to dominate the dps rankings. 
---
Is there a chance that the theory crafting back in Vanilla could be off and there might be a better way to play other specs that could make them much more viable? (Asking for a hunter friend who is me)
---
Is it possible to bookmark posts (aside from bookmarks in your browser I mean)?

And then you die alone.

Yup, too bad I won't get to 120.  No interest in what most label the one of the worst expansions.

Is that an original x-box controller? The fatboys?

You can tank any leveling dungeon in a DPS spec.
---
There is zero reason to level as protection unless the class fantasy is that important to you or you just hate yourself.

The best part of classic for me isn't for you to decide. What I want to do is challenge myself to speedrun 1-60 with profs. 
---
Like what even is this post? "You don't know how to enjoy the game correctly, so I'll teach you"? People who are new to the game can set their own goals and learn as they go. I assure you that 1-60 is going to be a very long route for everyone involved and people are going to shift their goals as they go. Let them experience it their own way.

hell yeah dude

I've read that Twitch app updates addons to BFA versions. Is manual installation the only option at the moment? Which websites do I have to check for updates? Thanks
---
Was going through my old hard drive - ran into this gem.  Still positive this is the first pvp kill ever recorded in WoW.  Happy to have someone contest this.  
---
I was in the friends and family alpha testing and in the WoW closed beta.  On day 1 of the pvp server launch, my friends and I had a LAN party and leveled up as quickly as we could.  By level 11 I was determined to find the horde and suicided myself across continents taking ghost rezs just to make it to Durotar to slay my first troll.  Once I found the pathway and took my first victim, I woke my friends up and had them run to me.  Once they arrived, I stripped off my avatars clothes and danced in front of the giant rock by Sejin Village while my friends hid behind it, ready to pounce.  We flagged the low hordlings and began the first slaughter in the history of the game.  This screenshot is the only documentation I have, as video recording wasn't a well known thing in 2004, nor did any of us understand how big this game would become.
---
To be fair, the whole "more dots" thing was based on the theory that somehow having many dots on Onyxia while she was flying made her less likely to do Deep Breath. 
---
Back in the early days there were a lot of dubious theories and strategies for raids floating around, and some of them stuck around for a long long time.
---
Didn't see anyone use VC until I played with yanks on a private server.
---
umm, club Iron Forge and that human city have nothing on Orgrimmar!!
---
Human lock is fine. Locks are the most versatile pvp class anyway. You have so many tools to win fights at your disposal that almost nobody with the same gear level can kill you anyway. WotF sucks as an alliance lock, yes, but the fact that your side has paladins makes up for that in BGs. 
---
Also if you ever get annoyed about WotF you can always spec deep destro and burn your enemies to death. Deep destro is amazing in pvp and not as reliant on fear as other specs.
---
Take a look at [Dive's drain tanking guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ccxosl/dives_drain_tanking_guide_for_warlock_leveling_in/).
---
I apologise then. I'm a bit of a cynic and usually assume the worst about a person's intentions.
---
I take offense to this. Some of us tryhard and are still slow tyvm.
---
Noob here with two questions:
---
First of all, if I wanted to do dungeons or even raids, will I have a harder time finding a group on a PvP server than a PvE server since a lot of people are doing battlegrounds or world PvP?
---
Secondly, I was playing on PServer to see if I enjoyed Classic before spending 16.50 AUD on it (turns out I do so I've bought myself a month of game time) and started a Mage. I've been hesitant to try dungeons because when I group up and go into caves for quests, I always seem to draw aggro from another player with a single fire-bolt. Can someone give me some tips on how to gain less threat than the Tank/whoever has more armour?
---
I remember this from back in the day. Great video.
---
I hope not.
---
At 11 I had just bought a l11 dagger and combined it with the rogue Deathstalkers quest reward. Pretty much best you can get starting Silverpine.
---
I went to kill spiders, and just one of those spiders almost damn near killed me. Consistently.  
---
I felt the regen was a bit low, if anything, but then it's been ten years since I last played a rogue.
---

---
How come you guys are "the best country on earth" while your people are either rotting away in the streets without healthcare or actively dying somewhere in the world, just to destabilize another economy, to save your own? Not to mention privatised prisons, which is basically modern slavery.
---
I believe Blizzard's stance, as reflected in that article, was that layering will be around for a couple of weeks, maybe a month.  On overpopulated realms, it may stick around up to the end of P1.  I do not believe there is a contradiction in the statements they made then, or the statements they make now.
---
Of course, this being reddit, everything was taken to the logical extreme, and the meta now assumes that "a couple of weeks, maybe a month, and certainly by the end of P1" must mean that layering is in for the duration of P1.  That isn't supported by a specific statement from Blizzard, as far as I'm aware.
---
The thing about layering is it is dynamic.  One night, you can have 5 layers, the next night only 3.  It can then spike back up to 6 for a prime time weekend, and back down to two mid week.  And, eventually (according to the plan anyway) it will spin down to just one.
---
This next part is just speculation on my part, but I think we should expect that servers will reach a single layer at different times.  Note that doesn't mean that the phases will be out of sync - Blizz will never do that.  Just that a medium pop server will drop to a single layer before a full or overfull server.
---
&gt; When I read “a couple weeks to a month” I expect them to do everything possible to achieve “a couple of weeks”. Somehow it’s okay with people in here that they
---
&gt; 1) make zero effort to achieve the best result
---
&gt; 2) overshoot their maximum estimation by 100-200%
---
Your turn for sources, now.
---
Listen, Blizz has a plan for what they expect population retention to be.  Are they right?  Only time will tell.  Nothing about the WoW Classic project indicates to me that they're taking cheap, easy answers though.  Layering and the number of available servers are undoubtedly set to match where Blizzard feels stable populations will end up.  The goal will be to ensure that each server reaches a stable population that functions without excessive queuing but also is not a wasteland by the time layering is switched off.  That's their big gamble with this launch.  If they're right, we should have a smooth drawdown of layering during (gasp) the first couple of weeks to a month, and maybe longer (P1) for servers like Herod that are already overcrowded.
---
Of course, if they're wrong about their assessments, then we could be in for some rough water.  But they're not a stupid company and they certainly have a greater ability (and significantly greater financial stakes) to make an educated guess than you or I do from our armchairs.  One way or another, all will be revealed soon enough I suppose.
---
Very much depends if the 5man leveling group can LOGIN in the first 0-6 hours. But if things go great, somewhere around 30ish. Going melee cleave so things start to pick up after that.
---
And I will absolutely be one of those garbage players. I'll try my best but I've never played WoW before and my first character will be a hunter. Fight me.
---
You started it!
---
They're exactly that. Ridden with attention seeking teens and drama, and social cancer. I pity anyone older than 20 who willingly joins any of the server discords
---
Is it harmless to perpetuate the myth of uncivilized savages, to whitewash the vast cultural differences of different tribes, of appearing no different than the Old Horde?
---
Is it harmless to fall under Garithos' banner of eliminating the inhuman beings to such an extent as to stand shoulder to shoulder with GNOMES, to seek to exterminate those who defended you and gave asylum, to wage war against those of the same religious order?
---
Just clarifying since it's very different from retail: you need skill equivalent to the top number to even cast a line at all, it's not like retail wow when you can cast and gain skill anywhere.
---
The classic version lacks this feature. Or at least I did not spot the button for it. I think it was part of atlasloot enhanced.
---
the MINUTE i found the release date i got a week off for that day!
---
VERY high noise-to-signal ratio, it's basically two dudes talking casually without much of a structure.  One of them is using VOIP but the sound quality is pretty good despite that.  I skipped around some because they kept straying off topic but I caught most of the first and second episodes and honestly it's pretty light on actual information.  Might be plenty of people's cup of tea but not mine.
---
I know this part is going to come off as an ad hominem attack and I apologize for that, but one of the hosts has a nervous laugh that is frankly jarring.  You'll know it when you hear it.  I'm not making fun of it, you can't help that sort of thing, but it really breaks up what little flow they have.
---
You have no idea how many times I tried making a Dwarf Hunter because of that trailer. I never made it past about 15 though because they're so damn ugly.
---
we did it bois
---
I kinda like all of the cities to be honest. Darn is just to fucking far and Thunderbluff is pointless to visit except for the odd quest that takes you there. Orgrimmar is one of the greats though!
---
Thank you for the clarity
---
ya i feel ya, it can be fun at times but i rather play classic (mechagon is pretty dope tho)
---
Both Shazzrah and Gehennas will have higher than normal concentration of people from nordic countries which means both will have a decently sized population of people who can communicate in english.
---
Fuck you downvoters.  This man's response was the only redeeming part about this low-effort, feelgood-bullshit post.
---
Nah, you’re fucked post MC content in terms of DPS rankings.

I'll upvote, not because it was good but because you had the courage to film yourself in a really cringy video and then post it for everyone to judge.
---
Would something like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxurgotxbZx0x0b) not be an effective healing spec that would still give you the 8% mounted speed bonus?
---
Now days only community I interact with is my guild. And most of them are my irl friends so of course we play together. In BfA I think I've had one nice experience with randoms when there was this one goofy rogue doing low M+ keys.
---
I really do miss times when people just randomly talked to each other and grouped up for quests. Can't wait to have that experience again in Classic!
---
You make a good point that our side has paladins. Never looked at it that way. I'll look up on the deep destro build if WotF gets too annoying for me to deal with.
---
Link your realmplayers then. I can guarantee you that you haven't even done BWL. Stop spewing bullshit
---
Dont level as prot you dont need it to tank. Leveling at prot will only make you better at cutting your wrists
---
calm down there buddy.
---
Lets looks at facts.
---
Retail is struggling bad enough atm that there are quite a lot of guilds that can barely scrape together a raid team.
---
And if classic can take one or two people from a raid then shit is going to start collapsing....i know for a fact that my GM is freaking the fuck out over how many are "abandoning" retail.
---
It should be so damn crowded at release that we wish the mobs (especially the shamans) would spawn faster.
---
I know M+ is very popular and successful it's just not for me.
---
I believe my group is planning on playing 24+ on the launch day so I'd say anywhere from 30-35? Not sure.
---
Link? I’d like to make money playing video games  and this seems totally legit
---
People roll on PvP servers for world pvp, not just for battlegrounds. PvP servers will have PLENTY of groups for dungeon content. 
---
The phrase "wait for sunders" is because in classic, you need to let the tank establish aggro on mobs. If you're casting right as the tank goes in, you'll pull threat very easily. Wait a few seconds for the tank to get threat, then you can go dps.
---
Yep, I know, but it is extremely hard and I think most people during classic want to level quickly rather than making dungeons extremely hard on themselves by going there underlevelled.
---
I had major lag trying to perform any task
---
The main value of OCE servers is raid times, tbh.
---
Broken isles was the same. It felt super compact with no room to breathe. And each zone felt like a "land" at a theme park.
---
Blizzard wrote their minimum requirements : 
---
CPU: Dual-core processor, such as the Intel Pentium D or AMD Athlon 64 X2.
---
GPU: 3D graphics processor with Vertex and Pixel Shader capability with 128 MB VRAM Such as an ATI Radeon X1600 or NVIDIA GeForce 7600 GT class card or better.
---
RAM: 2 GB RAM.
---
I could imagine that every laptop later than 2006 can run it😄 and I guess you don’t plan to raid on this laptop right?

We Melderon did some checking on the weapon imbues and WF is better than on Classic than it was on pservers, but that is relative to the other imbues. Oddly enough no matter your weapon speed rockbiter is always more dps solo, on elites and player WF will probably always be the best.. The issues still being even it its more dps its not much.
---
Most of the pservers vs vanilla issues are matters of small degrees if any at all.

Was talking with a friend about this last week. This is literally Twitch to some extend.
---
We had a poll running at [https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassicWhitemane/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassicWhitemane/) for class distributions. Would guess class distribution will be pretty consistent across realms.
---
&gt; doesn’t mean some accounts won’t be PLAYED for 4 days straight
---
My post had nothing to do with account sharing. This particular bit was in response to OP saying that “he usually gets his first sleep late day 4 or early day 5.”
---
&gt; yeah, ppl are used to private server rested XP numbers that are gained 2-3x faster than what you actually got in vanilla or in classic beta. 
---
I’m sure there might exist a few private servers out there that buff rested xp rates, but no, this was not the norm. Additionally, I was referring to Joana—who obviously would not have been doing his record run on a private server—and “other serious speed runners”—who race almost exclusively on locally-hosted “repack” servers with rested XP *disabled*. 
---
Not sure what brought you to my comment to make these points, because I was not discussing account sharing or private servers. Regardless, you clearly do not know what you’re talking about. It’s immediately obvious from your “boogeyman” tone of writing when discussing private servers being “wrong.”
---
exactly.

For me, im there for the endgame, im not gonna rush it week 1 or anything, will likely take me a month or so, but i still want to do it efficiently. Ive levelled a bunch of toons through 1-60, both before, and after the world revamp, just never during vanilla, i never did vanilla endgame and thats what i want to experience. Each to their own.

Are there any abilities in Arms that require two handed weapons to use or they can all be used with either a one or two handed?

I think they removed the ability to fish in AV before they released TBC, as an anti-afk measure.
---
Almost seems effortless to get 6 fishing points per level up, but seems impossible to get to 300 fishing from 1. Good idea.
---
Your wife is amazing! I've been looking at fishing levels for the zones to level it while I level my toon, and some are sooo hard to find! Thanks so much! :D
---
As I remember it in vanilla there where not fixed spawns it just replaced a normal herb so the spawn points might not be able to be camped

And Pandaria is one of the best looking continents.
---
The way i've interpreted layering is that it wont affect que times or the server population at all, it will only help with reducing the amount of players in zones. As they have stated that the server cap now is final, and will be the same in phase 1 as in phase 2. This would mean that layering wont and cant help if the server is full.
---
Same! Mine are horde

I think there is still a server cap.  I don't think they scale infinitely.  I don't know though.

Yeah, like I said having 0 experience with this class so any help and talent builds you show me would be awesome. Thanks again.

Hate it when people point out the truth huh?

Thank! You've been a big help, I appreciate it.

That's not a bad idea...! If you find something let us know!!
---
How can I optimize my 1-60 to account for ICC speedrunning?
---
As much as I loved tbc and wrath, that is the way to go. New content, with a vanilla design behind it. No flying mounts, no lfg. Game stays an mmorpg, community isn’t split (between those moving on and those refusing )

---
Welcome to the games industry.  Google it, crunch is rampant and a huge issue.
---
Well aren't you fun!
---
I thought we told you to throw that out weeks ago
---
I was thinking about it and I realized I think the reason some mechanics were changed was to reduce the amount of GM tickets, in turn reducing the labor overhead.  If everyone's loot is individual, I bet you get far fewer tickets of people whining about not getting a piece of loot which drop, loot disputes, etc that take up GM time.  If you craft the game so that nobody needs to ever put in a ticket, you save money.
---
Though I have no ill will towards the developers.. I doubt many of them have control over the aspects of retail we collectively disagree with.
---
I feel you, I also love leveling and I love to wpvp or duel and run dungeons during leveling and just don’t rush it, but also I am in semi-hardcore guild that want people to be 60 in 2 max 3 weeks. I have to rush leveling to get my spot in quality raiding which is more important for me than leveling. I wish that gaming would be like 15 or 20 years ago when people played for fun, like really for fun. Now everybody just speed up everything and compare with each other, it is too much. I am kind of forced to speed level too. Hard to explain, but in leveling you spend maybe like a month, but in end game you will be 2 years. So I rather speed level to enjoy raids with good people. But I feel you
---
Oh really? Pservers might’ve had that wrong then
---
Paladin/healer? What, consecrate? lol that's a mana hog, you can't aoe down packs efficiently with that spell plus you have to drink between every pull which slows them down.
---
And yes, congratulations, dedicate aoe leveling with mages is a hyper-efficient way to method *if* you can find density to support it which may be difficult to do with a full server at launch.
---
Neither of those refute the fact that warrior + heal duo is a very powerful combo.
---
It will be an issue because even with layering they have said they are not going to allow more then the max server population they have set even though the technology will allow them to do so.  
---
They can have as many layers as they want, however since layering is going away in phase 2 they have decided to set a population cap based on zero layers. What this means is the server will allow say 10,000 players on and once it reaches that number NO ONE can log in until players log off. The issue that will happen here is people will use macros to keep their character from getting kicked off. This will lead to queues that quite literally never go down.

Around my birthday (late december) in 2004 I came home from work and my girlfriend shoved a world of warcraft box into my hands, told me that she needed a healer and to set up an account. gave me a kiss and went back to her dungeon group.
---
Got it installed, she told me what server to create a character on, and a few minutes later my troll priest was born. She made a hunter to help me level faster, and we ran around murdering scorpids and harpies and laughing at the bad jokes in the game. 
---
About a month later, i hit 60 on my priest. We had a wedding ingame to match the one we had out and we played together till she passed (Cancer, she was 23.).
---
My current partner raided with us from molten core on, and we were casual friends (on opposite sides of the US) for years before we ended up in the same area, and ended up hanging out together. (We've now been together 5+)

I'm not exactly, I'm doing it right this time. Troll Rogue instead of the Nelf Rogue I rolled before discovering I hated the Alliance (NPCs and 12-year-old players).

Undead Mage instead of Undead Warlock (later Belf Warlock; don't hate me because I'm beautiful, hate me because I'm OP and trendy). Pack full of soulshards and pet management got annoying, Mage'll be more direct damage.

Tauren Hunter instead of Dwarf Hunter, again for the Horde!

Probably not : [ I miss the blizzard of old. Our best bet is the games popularity making it a no brainer for them.

If I wanted to achieve Rank 14, I was forced to play that amount to be competitive on the server.
---
You can be forced to behave a certain way to achieve a goal without being forced against your will.
---
Same for me! I'll join a couple weeks later, and my tryhard guildies will be WAY ahead of me xD But oh well, life is life. 
---
Have a fun trip!
---
This is honestly the best comment so far, and the mindset I'm trying to get in to help with the uneasy feeling. like I've  said I have spent some time as horde but this is the dive into the deep end for me if I pull the trigger.
---
That’s the one! That’s why I love reddit. Thanks
---
So you have chosen... death.
---
For sure, people are responsible for how they behave. And part of behaving responsibly in a society is not being an absolute prick by using racial slurs without considering their impact. It’s not unreasonable for someone to be hurt by words. 
---
All that the original poster did in this thread was inform someone that a word they used could be hurtful to others. It’s odd to me that *you* took offense to someone pointing this out and felt the need to butt in. Maybe that’s worth some self reflection. 
---
Power structures and privilege are real sociological concepts. It’s okay to recognize their existence - are you so scared to analyze the world you live in?
---
ThunderBluff is pretty damn silly. Lol
---
I think its a pretty reasonable assumption, surely most of us have had a moment in Orgrimmar or Ironforge during vanilla where we saw a guy in full T2 and thought we want to be like them.
---
A moment like that is what inspired me to join a raiding guild in the first place!
---
Can't wait to sit in queue for 2 hours
---
Ive always mained Alliance, now its time for the Horde.
---
Good show
---
Rare af. Found 8 in my whole life.
---
I love i have seen this screeny.   
---
Thx for Sharing
---
So the Alliance started it.
---
lmao "burninator"
---
I have always ran dungeons with the consensus that if a tank item drops, tank has the prio over it, etc. So while looking for people make this rule clear and you should be more than fine. Only exception to this rule are BoE items. They are an upgrade for everyone in the group(either by equipping it or selling it on market and getting an upgrade that way).
---
Some people want to level as fast as possible as a challenge, it's a form of speed running and some people enjoy it. The thing you are forgetting is that the people who are playing the game "wrong" in your eyes will get the best of both worlds. They'll have a max level character so they can enjoy endgame and they can play alts to absorb the lore if they want. This is very much how it was back then.
---
The other thing to consider is that the old world was in place for like 5 years and vanilla servers have also existed for a long time. Some folks simply know the quests inside and out and just want to play endgame on stable, permanent servers.
---
I for one will not have time to play so fast, I enjoy stumbling from one zone to another in a casual manner. But one awesome part about these speed levellers? I will once again look at level 60s in Ironforge in their shiny gear and feel like a simple adventurer again. 
---
You do you, and let others be, let's all enjoy it in our own way.
---
human warlock, got to 60, grew bored after bwl, rerolled human rogue, went thru to naxx on that toon
---
Glad to help. Go Horde and don’t look back. I play both factions and like them both a lot but I’ll be going Horde for Classic. You’ll have fun, I promise!
---
And there are people out there at 40 with a 19 yo wife.
---
It happened on private servers and it happened in vanilla.
---
Thanks, I do try and wait for the enemy to aggro someone else first but I guess I start attacking a little too early.
---
based on some of those comments, the drops are much better on Nost (video) than on Elsyium. I guess we'll see if this is worth it in classic. Also, this should be doable with a raiding spec. Otherwise, you gotta factor in the 50g respec. This looks somewhat similar to a standard 31/20/0, so it might work.
---
No they didn't
---
There isn't really a community wide consensus when it comes to rolling on loot in dungeons. Because of this, I  think you hit the nail on the head with "be upfront about expectations".  In the worst case scenario with the most unorganized groups I will, at a minimum, *"anyone care if I need"* in party chat if I want something.
---
In my experience, I think most in the community follow the below loose guideline for rolling.
---
BOP: Only need items which are relevant to your role in the dungeon. If you're a warrior tanking and a good 2h drops for your arms off spec, the ret paladin dpsing has priority on that because it is relevant to their role in the dungeon.  If there aren't any other players that can use the item but there is another player that could also use the item for their off spec, /roll them for it (offspec roll). 
---
BOE: In most parties, everyone will roll need (especially if the item will sell for a high price on the AH). I think this is stupid but whatever.
---
Hunter Privilege: Hunters get to roll need on everything. Just kidding. Not really.
---
As far as reserving goes, this will definitely be a thing in classic - like it or not.  The group leader should switch the loot rules before killing any bosses to make sure loot gets distributed in the way it was agreed upon.
---
Vorsicht weise auswählen
---
Yeah, 52 or so. Weeks.
---
I use the one I bought in year 1 still.
---
Wooooooo! I'm hope the factions are well balanced
---
Nah you gotta raid on shitty laptops, but there are requirements.  You have to roll some offbrand shit, have no idea how to play,  get 2 frames a day, and play victim on the forums when they kick you.

Thanks for sharing, neat one

This is where being a filthy casual will finally pay off. I don't expect to hit 60 in less than 6mo, so phase two should be long active by then.
---
7 days and 15 hours! :D
---
you're a moron
---
Oh my god why didn't I think of that ?
---
"PvP is kinda griefing one way or the other"
---
Oof, if he only knew how many would wax nostalgia over PvP 15 years later.
---
Makes me curious what the convo was, did he think you might get reported for griefing a player or something?
---
Awesome picture eitherway!
---
I wouldn’t report them/couldn’t it’s their choice if blizz allows it
---
Yeah, but it's all in girth.  Those are shorts, not pants.

You're welcome.

I liked the scorpion. It had a stacking dot. I felt like it was great for elite mobs.
---
Are you proud of yourself to have started the largest and longest lasting battle between two factions in the World of Warcraft?
---
Among the last People I would have expected this Kind of behavious from, are the Nightelfs which always pretend to be nice and harmony.
---
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined!
---
Crap. For some reason, I thought it was being released on the 27th! EVEN BETTER! :D
---
I played horde from vanilla to legion. 
---
Going alliance cause I never have.
---
Shit.
---
&gt; poopsocking
---
goddamn
---
It is Number One indeed. :)  
---
Big Blue Dress is right up there though ;)
---
Don't turn around my words. There is a solution, find friends or a guild and fight back.
---
I dont think its about that. Those who have played vanilla before, sure. But the new players coming in might have a bad mentality for vanilla. The average gamer these days tends to have a pretty competitive mindset, because of esports culture and everything. I dont think this kind of mindset is good for your first time. I could be wrong though maybe even the new players will enjoy it their own way.
---
Dude, like, nice, try, man
---
Now fuck off
---
I think the US is the only country connecting charity to warfare, so there's that. In Europe we rather help kids, the poor, the sick or whatever.

Except OP completely pulled it out of his ass:  
---
&gt;Our dedicated Blizzard team is experiencing Crunch Time   
---
&gt;Working 80+hr weeks prior to release, often without overtime pay    
---
Yeah, I'm going to call bullshit on that. We have no idea how big of a crunch they have or if they need to work extra hours.
---
we are teh admin gang of a swedish site called r60.org
---
Nice dude. Thanks for sharing
---
Next week bois

Can an ele shaman solo heal dungeons and still throw out big dick chain lightnings or will I just zoom and have to stand there and cast nothing but healing wave
---
Don't be so rude when someone tries to provide content. You can make your point without being rude.
---
This. The server community aspect is the biggest reason classic is going to be popular. The whole game feels different due to it.
---
Ouch just glad he and his house are ok, thoughts are with his neighbours and best wishes for recovery from this awful awful force.
---
Excellent!
---
Yep taking a week off.
---
To be fair, the troll threw the first blow.
---
That's what I ment. They don't change the formula or tresholds, but rise player cap. This leads to a different experience.
---
Yep just a few people seem to understand how perfectly balanced was Vanilla pvp
---
That’s the joke
---
If it takes a year after hitting 60 is it really the "nostalgia" fading lol, sounds more like squeezing a lemon until the very last drop.
---
Make a nelf hunter and name him a variation of Legolas
---
You need to know not to shammytank if you are asking this question here.
---
Yeah I did a double take over those screenshots. Strangers talking together? In retail wow? Now I’ve seen it all
---
Horde Shazzrah is the place to be, which was your toon?
---
&gt; there has been many reports over the last 5 or so years that blizzard, as a place to work specifically, is going downhill. 
---
which in no ways supprts the idea that the Classic team is the only place there is high morale.  It's just as likely everyone is unhappy at Blizzard, and if the Classic team is happy, it's just as likely some other teams at Blizzard are happy to.  I know if I were able to work full time on Hearthstone, for example, I would be pretty happy.
---
Troll Mage named Mogmage. Got him to 14 on a starter account I think before making a new account because my mom and I couldn't figure out how to convert it to a full paid account.
---
If you're going deep destro with searing pain, it must mean you are going full PvP. Suppression only affects affliction spells, which you won't use as much, but it also includes fear which your main way to keep people off you, so it's not a bad investment if you have some points to spare.

This looks like Friday the 13th for the NES
---
I mean so random and not true.   
---
We never did any speed runs or tried to beat any records, but on level 60 my neighbor was the kinda guy who got boored at 60 and started a new toon several times, the last time he played to 60 he got 5-6 days played without following any guides just by learning from himself after doing it 3-4 times.
---
I agree with not buying frost nova above rank 1 but you should absolutely buy poly. The higher ranks keep things sheeped for longer.
---
You’re a legend
---
Well, neither of these guys are THE main character and the comic isn't about wow at all. It's slice of life about messed up 20-somethings.

Admittedly not for everyone.

Gracias amigo!

amazing right?
---
This is great! Thanks :-)
---
I played vanilla on a pvp server and loved the beauty of world pvp. The majority of my friends are going to play on a pve server and now I fear not to have the same action as on a pvp server. Is there enough world pvp on pve servers?
---
Appreciate the correction x
---
It would be awesome if you didn’t have to down rank due to mana oooooom
---
Arguably today was worse for Joana since he won't compete for world first anyways and ClassiCast was a great chance to promote himself and his stream.
---
Im using it to scout out potential guilds and link up with friends from my retail server (pretty much all of my old server are coming to the same classic server). Other than that, im bailing as soon as the game drops.
---
EA wants to know your location
---
This is really interesting. Are the rules formal or unspoken?
---
I'm still undecided on going ally or horde
---
Its a thankless job, but hey, at least they have death threats to look forward to next week from people who wouldnt roll off of Shazz or Herod
---
To bad!
---
To bad.
---
Right but then you can dictate Loot rules or reservations, can't imagine a PUG being ok with ML on but hey, crazier shits happened.
---
Warlocks are even easier...
---
&gt;Makes a whole thread telling people they shouldn't power level the game, because it's not fun.

That is why with every new group you gotta explain it before disaster strikes. Create a copypasta or something
---
iwe'll have to see the classic veriosn of the talent tree to be sure but assuming they too can use multiple tree im sure any of the 3 specs can tank. Frost will probably be optimal for threat blood for survival.
---
Mine just started preschool and sometimes parents just need a little parent time out while they are at school, nothing wrong with it

Rank 2/2
---
Increases your movement speed by 30%
---
Lol ok.
---
I am kidding of course, you seem to have a lot of experience leveling druid and that's how you like it, I just see any speed increase as a godsent. 
---
I do agree with taking Furor early though. I see so many guides going all the way to Leader of the Pack before even touching the other 2 trees, and I see that as a waste. Adding to kitty powershifting, you also get an instant feral charge or bash in bear form. I will be having 5/5 Furor by level 28.
---
That's what happens when you don't have strong workers rights
---
REAL MEN PLAY 180  HOURS PER WEEK
---
yeah it's even then still 1$ faster then with both items.
---
I was Royta, Protection Paladin! I'll probably see you in battlegrounds ;) After a lifetime of Horde this time I'm going to give Alliance a go with some friends of mine. 
---
And yeah I recall it being around, maybe it just wittled down near the end of TBC like most other guilds did in preparation for WotLK. I remember weekly raids not having enough people show up or something, my memory is a tad hazzy on those days.
---
I assume you mean at 60. The answer is no until you and your group are geared. Sham heals are slow if you don’t have the talent (cookie cutter else spec does not have the talent I’m referring to) you will also run out of mana extremely quickly. When you’re geared, basically some MC gear, you can do a bit of damage too
---
Yeah, I mained a priest back in the day but want to try something different but similar. Druid appealed to me because it seems versatile but also because I thought it would be uncommon. Seems like Hunter and Rogue will be the least played class if you go by reddit comments though XD
---
"My favorite part of the game is raids"
---
I hear you. If you are the kind of person who only really enjoys raids, that's fine.
---
But, if you've never played classic before, and you rush to 60 in a week just for raids, there's a good chance the experience won't be that great for you. Just my thoughts though..hopefully everyone has a good experience
---
Gnomercy
---
I'd be down as long as they bring TBC Class changes.
---
Spoilers
---
Healers are always welcomed, nice to have that attitude. Every guild will be happy to have you. Just do some research the play styles of healers and what suites you. Good luck!
---
Maybe he was just trying see if his knife would actually go through you or if you were made out of Wood. Like everyone expects nightelfs.. I mean it was the first time two Races met - and all you guys think about is killing each other! :D
---
Father of two pitching in! No need to be salty about this things.
---
Having kids is amazing, but also extremely exhausting indeed but you learn to cope with it. No you won't have the time to go all-in on games when there are little ones depending on you. But those people that think you have to stop with any type of hobby and be a slave to your kids are wrong. There are still the time after kids are asleep, and if you're not a single dad/mom you can get the occasional time when your significant other takes the kids here and there. I can see how twins can be a whole other level though. 
---
It's okay to have kids and it's okay to not want or have kids.
---
I mean this was a thing 15 yrs ago. I did it. Also farmed ZG crocs as a Priest.
---
definitely not anything to do with efficiency
---
Might have one for you, in Reddit chat
---
I started playing a Druid and managed to Hit lvl 18 when i received the class q For the aquatic form, unfortunatly i couldnt figure that one out and thought i was Stuck on that q forever and couldnt continue Without completing it.
---
So i deleted that Druid and restarted as a troll Shaman
---
I healed only a little as a druid, I sucked. 
---
Let me tell you one thing about healing, it is thrilling to save the raid, you know exactly how close the whole raid got to wiping. To me it's the most adrenaline based role actually, healers routinely save the raid. 
---
I also tanked and DPSed, with tanking you are so concentrated on being in position and doing the right thing you oftentimes don't even pay attention to your health as much as you would think, other than when you get really low.
---
DPS is the least stressful and the easiest to make a bonehead move because of it. I DPSed as a Warrior when I did DPS and it was very tempting to just focus on your rotation a bit too long and not move in time.
---
Healing is really fun, but you have to pay attention to many things and yeah know one really knows or appreciates how much you actually help.
---
That is literally the only thing I’d like them to change.
---
Usually if we are raiding, we will put an unplugged keyboard infront of him, and my extra monitor infront of him just for the raid so he can pretend he is raiding too, that's after dinner, bath the and making sure he has had time with us, but he enjoys it when we get the time to play.
---
T-Rex spitting fire, Fuck it (sorry my lvl 1 dorf  paladin-to-be) gonna roll Hunter.
---
I never reached 60. I was an altoholic and terrible at the game. Its my opportunity to "do things right"
---
Thanks for the comment Josh.  
---
Seems a lot of people like your style though.  
---
Keep up the hard work, I'll be subscribing.
---
I understand why it's your wife now :-)
---
Thank her for this map, maybe we will see each other!
---
If you remember me, please let me know, when the EK map is out too!
---
You would have to run around flagged for pvp and pretty much have to hope you run into someone else also flagged, or find someone willing to engage on you which will probably only ever be when you are low on health/mana etc. It isnt non existent but wont be the same experience as a pvp server.
---
blizz isn't going to do anything
---
Check OP's comment though, the Rogue attacked first, but the Warrior went there with the intent to fight.
---
MCC was supposed to be coming to PC but that doesn’t look like it’s happening this year anymore
---
Easy fix. Separate layers by level... Ta-daaaa!!
---
2 weeks paid holiday
---
Someone back on Nost did this and managed to tank really well until around level 40 when mail armor was available, appereantly mail armor doesn't scale nearly as good as plate so he got hit pretty hard
---
A really cool feature would be if you could right-click on an item and (assuming you're still in range) it automatically pops up a trade window with the item populated, and ideally also the advertised value. Admittedly I know nothing about the addon APIs and whether this would be possible.
---
There's definitely bunch of dicks that just reserve all the popular names, try hards are trying to compete in everything including in owning names.
---
If you only use spells you're gonna have so much downtime. Queue up like 3 frostbolts and wand down the rest. Let that mana reg start ticking.
---
Keeping your wand up to date is of course crucial.
---
I agree with you. But also keep in mind that the people who post here are literally 1% of the player base.
---
Uh... everyone does.
---
Lock with Felhunter will be the hardest. They can spell lock you and use curse of tongues. Which makes your cast times so long it’s not worth casting. You can break fear and purge their one buff, but you’re going to have to find a way to damage them down with 5 second casts while they’re also damaging you. One thing to keep in mind is their only melee peel is fear(aside from death coil which is a 1 min cd) and they wear cloth. If you have frostbrand or flametongue on a fast wep you can just keep hitting them and earth shock any cast
---
Four years have passed since the mortal races banded together and stood united against the might of the Burning Legion. Though Azeroth was saved, the tenuous pact between the Horde and the Alliance has all but evaporated. The drums of war thunder once again. Echoing with cries of "Justice for Zanjin".
---
I don't know how it will be in classic and if there will be more people willing to play healers or if the content will be so easy that raid will be able to take less healers but back in the days you needed 10 (outside of farm content) and from my experience, it was the real difficulty when trying to create a successful guild/raid because far from 25% of the raiding players wanted to heal.
---
Raid leaders often pressured hybrid class to play healer not because they absolutely hated the dps specs but because they needed people to heal and finding random dps ready to tag along for a raid wasn't difficult at all in comparaison.
---
Also note that if it was hard for new guild to find 40 raiders, once you had a successful raid clearing BWL, then it was super easy to recruit people and raid leaders had the luxury to pick exactly what they wanted.
---
I've never had a lvl 60 character in Vanilla wow and I am only interested in doing PvP once classic comes. 
---
That being said, how do you get good pvp gear without raiding?
---
wake me when 69,420 comes
---
Awesome.
---
No sleep? More like account-sharing. That's what the smart speed-levelers will do. Give their account data to a friend who keeps leveling for them while they take a nap.
---
All these complainers never actually played the original.
---
Do not play PvE if you love world PvP
---
When you first start you're in the starting zone until approximate lvl 5 or 6 and there's only one exit out of that place. At the exit you'll find a quest to go to an inn (rewards a food or drinks)
---
The place where you hand that quest in, is the place he is talking about.
---
Just look around for a weapon vendor there.
---
Are you not?!
---
If I am the only one with 15 HK, will that mean, that i will get the max Honor Points this weak?
---
Oh okay, never fished in wow so I was wondering. Bottom number seemed pretty high in all zone to not have any miss so I thought it was something else.
---
For a lot of people it is we are just a day ahead.
---
It would be cool if the addon showed some visual cue, e.g. a symbol next to their nameplate to identify them as a "merchant".
---
This was already brought up. I wouldn’t mind it.
---
How in the fuck did I go 11 years without seeing this!?
---
You spelled Stormwind, Ironforge and Darnassus wrong ;)
---
Enchanting is a struggle generally, it's easier to do while levelling but it will slow your progress massively. If you really want to do it 60 is probably best but will involve as lot of grinding low level stuff
---
excellent, see you in the battlegrounds! Come join the discord and meet so many friends of your s if you like, trying to make the discord a meeting ground for all bloodscalpers that wanna reconnect with others :)
---
Thing is, players who despise what retail is have for the most part already sorted themselves out of the game. If you don't like the current state of the game, you aren't subbed, and so it's definitely likely that some of the people who currently play retail would go back to it after some time.
---
Character creation and name reservation went live last week
---
17 days Boyz let's fucking go!
---
We really needed another video on this topic! Thanks a lot. Can you also make a ‘What race to pick’ or ‘What class to pick video’? Haven’t seen one of those in a day.
---
Thread #1947 today that wants to tell people how to play the game.
---
i agree with the chinese buying gold thing, but if he farmed the gold then bought the mats to give to his guild. its still more effort than the rando who is just showing up in trash gear with no consumes even for himself.
---
For leveling it's way better than str or stam because it reduces down time between mobs significantly.
---
&gt;Lock it to certain zones/end game areas only imo
---
just doesn't make sense to say hey you can only fly in this one geographic area though.
---
This. It's my time. I'll focus on tanking and fishing as I see fit.
---
Being good at PvP. Playing in groups/premades.
---
I once escaped a level 60 pally tryna ganking my level 22 mage. I kept him in combat so he couldnt mount up, and kite with blink.
---
It was glorious
---
They should turn the tables and make us hide from Mankrik's wife while she's looking for us
---
Will someone please remind me how dungeon and raid lockouts work in Classic? I assume weekly for raids, but what about dungeons? How often can i run the same one?
---
Im pretty sure my "endgame" is going to be:
---
"Hurray now for the mount do some pvp and reroll class"
---
&gt;What is gonna happen (I give it a 95% chance) is that they open new servers once they remove layering and offer free migration from the overcrowded servers.
---
That's what should happen 100% because they refuse to make more language servers, I don't want to end up in an unofficial x language server.
---
Wow ain't going anywhere.  I'll probably play a lot, but I ain't gonna rearrange my life over it.,
---
what is unfair about your raid group running into another raid group and getting wiped out for being inferior?  
---
The reward is getting to be involved and phase 2 onward you also get honor as a bonus.
---
Not all the specs do tho. Unless you’re a super casual guild you won’t have enhance shamans Rey pallys feral Druids arms warr demo lock boomkin etc in raids. Your guild really starts to feel it on progression fights like shazzrah or majordomo to start, the vael in bwl
---
&gt;loved the beauty of world pvp
---
Play on PvP server and make new friends.
---
The way people talk down about people who decided to have kids is incredible sometimes.
---
Xyshina from Stormreaver? You played with Jonchron? 
---
I used to play a mage named Dlish on that server. Good times lol.
---
I think donating trade goods for dkp is a horrible idea, but making it flasks only is een even worse idea.
---
Let me explain.
---
You cannot make flasks. Only skill 300 alchemist can and only in Scholomance and (later) in BWL. oh and you need extreme rare and expensive recipes who especially at the beginning only 1 person in the guild has access to,(if any)  This is a terrible logistic hassle so what guilds do in practice is, save up 10 or 20 stacks of flask material and then do a flask run, and everybody get the flasks he brought personal materials for (plus the guild flasks that are made from guild resources)
---
It's like the movie Watchmen but fully fleshed out, it seriously is top-notch.
---
Wow classic is also so addictive because it inflicts pain and frustration in measured doses. I remember thinking that Counterstrike was so addictive because you had to sit around and wait for the game to finish after you got killed.
---
Having no friends is bliss. Youre free to chose realm, faction, class and schedules
---
Raiding was always way more exciting the first time you were doing it but became pretty routine after that. Every run of a 5 man dungeon always felt different though which kept it interesting.
---
This!
---
Not really, it’s clearly a lie unless she’s on paternity leave haha.
---
my man
---
Whats up Dlish! We have an SR discord setup with 100+ oldies from Harrow / GC / OG / Cabal / Impervious.  Send me a DM I'll shoot you an inv.
---
&gt; Why do they have to make the game so BORING?
---
unpopular opinion: because a lot of people suck at videogames and blizzard wanted them to have a fun, enjoyable experience too (and also pay sub fees)
---
there are people who have no idea what it means to be "good" at wow and they have no interest in whatever that is either, they're just around to enjoy the scenery and feel personal accomplishment however they find it. blizz made retail wow much, much easier so that they could see more of the game without ever having to actually get good at it
---
if you've ever heard lfr referred to as "tourist mode," that's why. it's for tourists, not raiders. mythic tier gear recolors were supposed to be the hotness that high caliber players got to distinguish themselves from tourists, but imo even that was just a slap in the face

Twitch app got an update recently to support classic addons.  
---
It works well for me : it only shows 1.13 (classic) addons and update them without any problem but I heard some people report issues and bugs.  
---
Try it !
---
A good DPS in modern wow does high dps while supporting the group in any way the class can. Im only playing rogue and balance druid so Ill only use these as example. Rogues should actively look for opportunities to stun, blind and kick while also minimizing damage on oneself by using cloak, evasion and feint. Druid can sometimes of heal in a pinch, knockback if necessary and AoE silence. If all you do is high damage no decent player will consider you "good".
---
A good dps now has to do the same things as they had to do back then, even more infact since the content is harder nowadays. Im not sure where the idea that dps in retail only have to dps comes from, but its just flat out wrong. 
---
The best example I have is how my brothers plays mythic+. He plays a pala din and lets his dps suffer to support everyone in the group. He throws shields and blessings when needed and during high damage phases he uses his holy power to heal instead of dps. He is pretty much always last on dps but the runs with him is almost always super smooth with a very low number of deaths even on high keys
---
Go horde so I can fight you.
---
He does make some mistakes in the video, but it's pretty good. Like when he was kiting that warrior he ran back into range and let him get a charge off while still in cheetah. Mostly though he's just finding people and CCing them with trap and engineering helm. Still a great video.
---
Maybe I should've explained myself a bit better, I apologize. 
---
My question is, where do I get the gear without doing raids? Will vendors be selling gear for honor points or how does it work?
---
This is great! Was looking for something like this and found it hard between all the outdated Wikis and mixed retail info.
---
I didn’t think I was stealing since I was elaborating on the previous ones
---
Already done mate. And if you dont like watching multiple videos around the same subject where people share THEIR thoughts on things Youtube is not the platform for you.
---
You can shorten the ones that look like this:
---
    /cast [nomod,@mouseover,help][help]Healing Touch
---
    /cast [mod:alt,@mouseover,help][help]Healing Touch(Rank 1)
---
    /cast [mod:shift,@mouseover,help][help]Healing Touch(Rank 2)
---
To something like this:
---
    /cast [mod:shift,@mouseover,help][help]Healing Touch(Rank 2); [mod:alt,@mouseover,help][help]Healing Touch(Rank 1); [nomod,@mouseover,help][help]Healing Touch
---
The "nomod" on the last one is unnecessary if you put it last, but it's fine to leave in if you want.
---
Dungeons, world drops, crafting, PvP vendor rewards.

Approximately because they don’t know how long the servers will crash for.
---
(Can’t wait)
---
No because I disagree with the responsibility of maintaining it, for those parts described, being for me but rather the service provider. 
---
I pay to play, if they don't keep it clean enough I simply move on and don't pay. Its business.
---
Please, don't project extra onto that, it simply means I don't agree that it is my responsibility in any shape or form to report spammers etc. Its a niceness etc, but not a responsibility. 
---
As for everything else, as a person in-game etc, i'm there to have fun and enjoy the game like everyone else :).
---
I think I remember a bunch of Xyshina videos from back in the day, with some funny music.  Fanny pack!
---
I thought the PvP server opened earlier than that.  I got into the F&amp;F beta in March 2004 when the level cap was 39 and I thought it was only a couple months later they opened a PvP server.
---
T’is an option eh? Plan B anyway
---
I'm a marine... granted I haven't deployed. I've spoken with several of my brothers who have. It is an actual shit show. They tell all these horror stories. I've had brothers who have gotten killed by an IED made from an MRE wrapper. They go on deployment, and never come back. Even if it is to get paid, its still a job that needs done. They chose to do that job. What matters isnt the reason. It's the act. We aren't defined by what we think. It's what we do. If Hitler thought he was doing good, does that make him good? No it doesn't.  He was a terrible person and is burning in hell. Even if we did it just for the paycheck, which yes some of us do, it doesnt matter, we still do it.

---
&gt; Why tell others how to play the game?
---
In this particular case? I would imagine it's because it creates a sense of frenzied hectic that is all too easy to get swept up in if you're not already set on taking it slowly (mostly because you're a vet that *knows* that you can take your time). I've witnessed the mad scramble to realm-first 60/MC on private servers, I've seen people who weren't 60 after the first few weeks quit the game in frustration because they genuinely thought they were "too late to be taken along". I've also known raiders that were so burnt out of leveling fast that they also dropped the game.
---
So, I think it's pretty alright to point out that it's okay to stop and smell the Mageroyal.

Shaman has a medium skill floor and a pretty high skill ceiling. If played correctly they can be devastatingly effective. They are somewhat difficult to learn (any class is) at first since they are both a range and melee class. Once you get a comprehensive feel for blending the two you can be very effective. The biggest problem they have is mana management. Shamans do not have a ton of mana like paladins. If you’re not careful you’ll find yourself oom very quickly.
---
Mechanical stuff: 
---
* Rebind your A and D keys (turn character) to be your strafe keys instead. 
---
* Turn on enemy nameplates (default key is V). 
---
* Turn on fast quest text from the games interface options menu.
---
* Set smart camera to never and max camera distance. 
---
* Enable auto loot so you don't have to shift + click corpses. 
---
* disable profanity filter(optional) 
---
Ignore optimal race/class combinations. Play what you think is most enthralling. If you really like this game than it isn't going to be the last time you make a character. If you don't absolutely love your toon, you'll burn out and quit.
---
Always be improving. I've known people to turn off their UI when they are learning to use their keybinds in order to force themselves to not click their ability icons. Whatever works.
---
There is only a handful of ways you can disrupt another player with your poor play. This is a social game and we all have to get along so if someone is giving you pointers on how not to mess things up for everyone, be receptive.
---
as far as i know questie just shows you the area where they spawn not the exact location
---
So = means you shouldn't fish there at that point because fish escape?
---
Or people will quit within a year and one of the reasons are 8 tanks for 4 horsemen, which won't even be in the game in a year.
---
Not sure, and not sure how accurate my date on that time stamp is on the file, that image has moved hard drives a few times.  It says 9:55pm but I remember leveling all night and was pretty sure the kill happened in the early AM because my friends were sleeping and I woke them up going, OMG FIRST KILL!  I couldn't find any info on google about the launch date of the closed beta PVP - the only info says, "near the end of beta launched the pvp server".

---
Hunter and rogue may legit be 2 of the top 3 played classes. Hunter is too easy to level and rogue does too much damage
---
Gameplay wise it’s whackamole but you only get so many whacks. In early gear you hard oom very very fast. You have to be pro-active, anticipating damage by rolling and stopcasting your heals. Reactive, knowing when to cancel a cast to save someone with a quick heal. Patient, knowing how to save mana by using efficient heals and letting other healers balance out the load. It’s a very involved playstyle; letting someone die and lose their world buffs or consumables is quite demoralizing to the raid.
---
Good healers also hard carry dungeons and battlegrounds. Literally a single strong like resto shaman can carry a whole AV raid
---
Even at 50 it’s pretty okay to tank with Arms spec?
---
BIG if true.  A fucking legend walks among us...

Paladin is the best pvp healer, no question. Especially for melee. They can dispel everything but curses, they can prevent rooting and slowing effects. They can make party members physically immune to damage for 8 sec, and they can make themselves immune to absolutely everything for 12 seconds at a time. They have a long stun and are very hard to kill generally.

To piggyback onto your comment, I also dislike the fact of knowing that all the progress I make during levelling basically resets at 60. I'm not rolling any class I have 0 experience with, so for me the fun comes in when I hit 60, find a good group of folks to play with, and start cumulating things i'll need for 60. 
---
The levelling experience for me is fun because i'm meeting people and seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. I want to level more than 1 toon so the fun isn't in stopping and smelling the roses, it's having my full toolkit for my toons and logging in knowing i've got some cool people to play with.

There are so many guides and content available for classic right now. We need to weed out the bad ones. If we were to encourage every single guy with a YouTube account and a microphone we wouldn't be able to find the actual good content.

Sure the guy put a lot of effort into this, but its all over the place. There are also a lot of information that is just incorrect which is just sad considering he spent two minutes in the start tooting his own horn about how skilled he is, and how all his pro-player friends have double, triple and quadruple checked his facts.

Are there any other spots as valuable as that in vanilla?

Warlock or Mage for PvP?

So I’m kinda torn on this. On one hand I want to go paladin because I really enjoy healing. On the other hand I’m afraid I’ll get frustrated if I can’t farm anything at 60 especially on a PvP server. 
---
However my time will be limited and I’m really concerned about spending hours looking for a group if I’m going DPS. Are there some DPS that are really looked for like rogues on retail?
---
From a certain point on, you have to deal with the ghost of his wife slowly moving towards you. If she catches you, instantly dead. you have to quest while she chases you until a few hours later you finish the entire quest chain and free her spirit.

---
Why do you ask?
---
I feel like there's a lot of sides to this whole deal.
---
First of I think everyone should be free to play the game they want to, I'm going to play very casually this time around and just focus on reading quests / levelling professions and perhaps I'll even try to solo dungeons as I go. (I'll be rolling either warlock or hunter, so some parts might be doable).
---
Some people are really focused on the efficiency and minmax, getting to 60 asap, starting dungeon groups asap and doing all the raids. Not my thing anymore, but I think it's completely fine if you're hardcore and that's where you derive the most fun from.
---
That said, I think in some views the focus on efficiency/minmax/addons/rotations etc. held a big part in "ruining" WoW, or at least changing it. It's due to the focus on efficiency that things like LFG and flying mounts came out. It's due to efficiency that a lot of UI changes came about.
---
From that perspective, I'd say when the culture of a particular game changes so much that the majority of people are focused on minmaxing/efficiency, then I think it's a bad thing. 
---
If there's ever a classic+ I hope it shakes up things, and that blizzard focuses on horizontal progression mainly as well as on lower level content as well. The journey from 1-60 is in my mind too fast, the hardcore people get to 60 in like 5-10 days. I think it should take them months.
---
As a casual I'll be able to enjoy the game just as much, while the hardcore crowd won't have to worry about the lack of content or things to do.
---
Just because I was 15 at the time and more saavy about computer security than most at the time. My email was hacked first, which came straight out of left field. 
---
But mostly I just couldn't easily afford one back then and my parents would have definitely been like "uh we're not paying for any of your "World of Pokemon" nonsense, which is why I got my first summer job, to build a pc and get a WoW account. 
---
At the time they seemed so expensive and extraneous. Lesson learned.
---
Im patiently waiting for 69 hours left and anticipate major chuckle
---
And since you’ll play classic I’m guessing your last day of college is soon after?
---
Just saying from experience, you can be an adult and acknowledge that some people have more money than they have time and want to use those resources to offset each other without also being a big judgmental asshole about people you don’t know and who’s situations you don’t understand. It makes you sound bitter at people who have more free time than you, which ironically comes off as way immature.
---
The anger 15 years later. I love it
---
I think an aspect of healing that people don't really talk about is that you're basically looking at a chart the entire raid.
---
You stare at health bars, click the bars that are dropping and heal.
---
If that sounds like fun, then you might like healing.
---
For some reason I thought you bought stuff with honor points. Oh well. Maybe I'm thinking of later expansions.
---
Dwarf Paladin boys he made it to level 23ish I belive, then I recognized him for what he really was...
---
Also, that would mean a bunch of them are all *independent contractors*, which I wouldn't believe unless Blizz themselves confirmed.  Pretty hard to escape paying overtime in CA.
---
Not to forget: great rewards (mostly)!

Exactly this ^^

I wonder why everyone (i.e. Kargoz and other streamers) is always advising using the trash bag instead of drain tanking with DPS pet. It is so much faster.
---
Try to looks for pre-raid BIS to know what to farm before you achieve higher pvp ranks which unlocks pvp gear (rare at lower ranks, epics at higher ranks).
---
For example shadow priest guide

Blizzard knows that their fans wanted mobile Diablo and they also knew how great it be to make it the big show at Blizzcon. They is super smrt like OP.

---

---
its not
---
There is one lfg heroic the one with gauntlet and arthas chase
---
I remember good geared healers going oom on first 2 bosses or the dps worse than tanks and failing the chase. It was the only tricky hc in that version.
---
I was first person to cap in PvP beta. First hunter to cap when it was released in beta. 2nd shaman to cap in release, world wide, 1st was also from my server, Laughing Skull. 1st was "Rak" he was an Orc, got to abuse 7 hit windfury bug that wasn't fixed between beta and release inexplicably, and had 2 people playing him around the clock. I went tauren. I'll also add, Laughing Skull came up 2 or 3 days late. There are screenshots if you look for them of who hit 60 when.
---
Plenty of people have beaten the Joanna time, whatever my time was back then, wasn't a record, why the fuck would I take a screenshot of it and if I did, but it's long lost to time at this point.
---
Yes, numerous people will break 5 days played, most of them, if not all of them will grind mobs, and not quest. I'd be very shocked if someone questing was competitive in terms of server firsts. 
---
All of the serious speed runners, grinded mobs. Dummies who bought guides, quested.
---
Lastly, fat, out of shape people die from going without sleep for that long. I certainly wouldn't recommend anyone who is middle aged, or approaching middle aged, but if you're a fit 18-25 year old, and you get up once in awhile to stretch your legs, it's a case of willpower. 
---
I get it, you don't believe me, that's fine.
---
I guess we will see in a few weeks, who was right. World firsts will almost certainly come from solo mob grinding hunters, and or a 5 man group dungeon grinding. 
---
Questing in classic wow was NEVER faster than grinding, and yes, all the really fast questing times, relied on rested experience to supplement them.

If I was 20-25, I'd give it a shot for world first, I'd mob grind a hunter. I'll even tell you the exact path I would take, keep in mind I last did this in 2005 so the exact transition points in terms of levels I can't recall. I'd go orc or troll. I'd do the initial quests in the starter area, and then head north to stromgarde keep. I'd begin killing the gnolls around the bramble areas, and then work my way towards cross roads. Moving level appropriately. Next you kill the gnolls again around cross roads. Around level 10-12 you expand to killing the centaur camps, take the heads for those quests, they are convenient. Also keep an eye out for any of the other kill trophy quests in the area. Around 14, you head south down to camp taurajo and you still killing gnolls again for the Blood Shards, which you can turn in for quests. You farm these gnolls, proceeding to the higher level camps until level 19-20ish, turning in shards for buffs as you go, keep eyes peeled for the trophy kills. From here you go to Hillsbrad. Kill whatever, I ran big loops first in the W of the Zone, and then later in the NE of the Zone around the Hinterlands zone entrance. You want to hit level 24-25. Now you go to arguably the best grind spot in the game. 
---
STV Lake Nazferiti. You're after the venture company goblins. Incredibly low HP. You can do level 24-25 to 32 in less than 10 hours here. Your prime levels around 27-28-29 can be 20ish minutes per, gaining 2-3 levels in an hour. It may actually be faster to wait a level or two before going, because you are underconned at 24-25 to a lot of the mobs if memory serves. How long you stay depends on how how long you want to push killing greens. I usually stayed until around 32, it was worth if I had the spawn to myself. 
---
Next go to Desolace, Thunder Axe fortress, Sargeron and Magram Territory are good, I believe Thunder Axe Fortress is best initially. As you level, move south to SHokthokar and Mannoroc Coven, stay in the Mannoroc Coven until level 40, then head south to Feralas.
---
In Feralas, you're hunting what is probably the best all around mob in the game to farm, hippogryphs. You're looking for the big spawns of hippos in the SW corner. You can also farm the Ogres nearby, they are squishy as well and easy to frag with a hunter. At level 49-50, head to Azshara.
---
Head to the NE or the SE, and farm either the Blood Elves, or the Hippogryphs. Both get you to level 60, they will go green at around level 54-56, but, both mob types are extremely easy, this is about quantity not quality. You mow through them. 
---
This is basically the path I leveled two hunters back to back on, the first 20 levels differed because the first Hunter, was an Orc, and the second was NE. The orc was slower, just under 5 or just over 5 days played. The NE was much faster due to refinement and was around 4d 11-12h something in that neighborhood. It also included camping for Lupos for a few hours at one point, Broken Tooth was up when I got him luckily.
---
You will also make insane runecloth off of the bloodelves. Anyone who wants to grind, at the very least I highly recommend the STV/Feralas and Aszhara parts of my run. For horde, the first 20 levels are pretty optimal, getting the trophy kills in the Barrens + the buffs from the blood shards. Hillsbrad I don't think is optimal, but it's what I knew from my experience, likewise Desolace probably isn't terribly optimal. The Orc Coven at Thunder Axe I think is very good, the rest is "ok". My tendency in these runs, was also to stay put even if things were less than optimal, because time spent running around trying to find something better, was time I could have just grinded through a level or two pounding out greens. I also wasn't explicitly trying to level fast. It was also just happenstance that I leveled two hunters back to back. I decided to come back to the game, made an Orc hunter, hit 60, didn't want to join Banana Boyz (old rivalry), and my friends from P4L said I could raid with them, so I made a NE hunter immediately after. 
---
Following the route I laid out, if you were actually trying to go as fast as possible, you could probably do it just under or just over 4 days played.
---
no it's not
---
How do you get one shot by a windfury proc? Isnt the very essence of windfury, that it hits a lot?
---
But not alone.
---
That's an interesting theory but has to be false. I was on the character select screen before character creation was live spamming create character and getting an error over and over. It worked after a few minutes proving that you can get updates at the character select screen. The timer just doesn't update I guess for some weird reason.
---
Well, I’m already not playing retail. It’s literally no lose situation for me, I can only play more than I play now, be that a week, month or a year.
---
Man, I am even past that. I don't know what to watch anymore.
---
I have been through almost all video's of:  
---
Frostadamus  
---
tipsout  
---
Esfand  
---
Madseasonshow  
---
Staysafe
---
My first character was a Tauren Warrior. 
---
I quit the game as soon as I dinged 60.
---
Make it ironfudge
---
Funny. They seem to be posting political content on their 'military charity' twitter account.
---
I hope blizzard adds more lower level dungeons in the future. Would be interesting to see some kind of additional XP grind as well.
---
Don't see them changing the 1-60 XP requirements, but perhaps they could add some other kind of progression that even lower levels could focus on.
---
That way you preserve a big part of what made vanilla fun, the journey.
---
Rofl are you me?
---
Yep. Still happens, maybe not at blizzard but in the games industry in general. Also it probably does happen at blizz anyways.
---
What?
---
Looking for a place to find classic viable addons to see whats available for classic, Im not sure what sites are actually legit.
---
But why is everyone assuming that their way of playing is better? I like optimising things, that's my way of playing. If I wanted to play a game where I don't have to think about optimising stats and stuff I wouldn't play a complicated RPG, I would play Mario
---
I also don't have as much time as when I was a kid, so part of the reason I want to optimise things a bit is to have a chance to progress decently without playing 15 hours per day.
---
It's also very patronising to have people act like they know better than everyone else how classic should be played. Let people do whatever they want.
---
Yeah and he couldnt be worse
---
**Race &amp; class vs faction**
---
Night elf druid or playing again as horde.
---
I want to play druid but i dislike the Tauren race, but i love the horde.
---
Don't know what to do, any advice?
---
I will be on an hour or two early to get on the character select screen and wait there
---
Of course it's a level 4, lmao
---
&gt; I know hunters are the go-to farming alt, but Warlocks compete in that field too.  
---
I think you might be confusing Warlock with Mage. I would recommend you do exactly what you're thinking, just with a Mage instead.
---
Cant friends help? I never done it
---
r/classicowplus
---
You can just create a new Starter Edition NA WoW account within the same [battle.net](https://battle.net) account and sub to it.
---
Second this. I know a bunch of people who are waiting to resub when Classic actually launches....
---
haha yes, overworking employees is cool and good
---
--you, a dumbass
---
If you hoard your DKP you’re not buying anything though. If you get everything last but cheap, that’s only fair 🤷🏻‍♂️ It’s a self-regulating system.
---
&gt;clan name
---
1v1 me in the wildy bro
---
I've mained my Warrior since I started. I probably have well over 1000 hrs played by this point. It's the class I loved. Through ability pruning and class homogenization, I saw my favorite class slowly devolve into a shell of its former self. 
---
I've missed so much from the old Warrior mechanics, but most of all I'm looking forward to the return of stance dancing and Non-Titans Grip Fury. 
---
So as others in this thread have already said, I'm remaking **my** Warrior and I'm gonna do it all over again. And you know what? *I can't wait.*
---
People have some really weird notions of RP servers. They are like any other server and I played on one for years without ever doing any RP. The RP is not mandatory, just protected in case someone actively wants to be a dick and ruin it for other people. The reason I like to play on RP servers is that people who do enjoy roleplaying in open create much better atmosphere for the rest of us to enjoy, and if I ever felt like joining in, that door remains open.
---
no you aint ahead, it release for everyone at the same time in their respective time zone. in UK for example its 11pm on 26th, UK 11 is my 12 which makes it technically 27th here at the time of release.
---
spot on champ, that's how populations work
---
Also that bad hunter can stomp in bgs when the frontline is busy
---
That’s how they shafted me during character creation, friend got the update I didn’t for whatever fucking reason.  Had to manually hit “check for update” in launcher 
---
Was a nice rage moment
---
That’s wrong on so many levels...
---
If I wanted to farm felcloth (or any other resource that drops from high-level mobs), which of these two class/spec combos would be more efficient, taking into account the downtimes and travel times between mobs in an area.   
---
PvP spec Rogue  
---
PvP spec Feral Druid
---
A man offered to pay for my mount if I helped out and boosted him when he wasnt online. I told him I only played on weekends and he said that would be fine. So for a month I would play my druid and when I saw him go offline, I would jump on his priest and grind. I didn't know Alliance areas so I just grinded mobs. I dont know how much time I put in, but it was time lost, and at the end of it all, he was 60. I asked him when I would get my gold and he told me that I hadn't done enough and that he really needed me most during the week. I told him I was 11 and in school and that he was being unfair. He pretty much told me tough luck.
---
So i waited for him to log out, logged in on his, sold all his stuff, send myself the gold, and then deleted all his Alliance characters because blood and thunder and all that. I never spoke to him or saw him again. I can only assume the GMs never helped him or he never contacted them because I never faced repercussions and totally had a kodo for free, plus enough gold for an AH spending spree. Im not proud of this, but I don't exactly regret it either.
---
Definitely bigger than the WoW forums.
---
It's also one of the biggest growing communities out there.
---
So do hunters
---
On how many?
---
He pulled the information out of his ass, yes. But it could be true. It’s activision after all!
---
I don't usually shit on retail (not as much as some of y'all do, that is) but this one is justified.
---
Over the years Blizzard has destroyed everything I enjoyed about being a hunter, so you can bet your ass I'll be playing my baby again.
---
Repost
---
I probably won't follow the leveling guide because it's too detailed and annoying. But the rest is just talent templates and useful links/tools really
---
&gt;No one back then was bitching about taking their time or rushing we just did it our way and it was between us and any guild expectations and that was it.
---
There's a big reason for that, though. The exchange of information was much more limited, if you knew about tidal charm you were one of the very rare people. It felt really amazing to have it and to surprise people. Same thing with things like engineering, almost nobody had it so when you used all the crazy gadgets it was something very striking.
---
Nowadays, due to much better bandwidth, intricate databases like wowhead(thottbot and allakhazam were very basic and again, few people used them), streaming services, passage of time, etc. all of these things have highly contributed to "educating" the population on "how" to play the game most efficiently  / what's best, etc.
---
You have to actively decide to ignore a lot of those things to play the game casually. And every time you open up your favorite YT channel / twitch channel, you'll be getting reminded of how inefficiently you're playing etc.
---
Back then ignorance was bliss.
---
\*slowly hides stash of energy drinks and junk food\* You're absolutely right.
---
Delete this
---
These are 2 different things, The create character button sends a request to the server each time you press it. The timer is something that needs to be polled and updated every X seconds.
---
I like CONSTRUCTIVE criticism. Not some little bitch crying because he's seen a similar video before. Go bitch on Team 10 for copying Sidemen's Tinder video or Morgz for copying every MrBeast video ever instead you spas.
---
Same. I leveled to 52 as a feral druid wearing int gear because the manual said it was the primary druid stat.
---
All of you saying that you hope Blizzard breaks the addon, sorry its not possible without breaking tons of other addons. Since all the addon does is use hidden chat channels to communicate.
---
RemindMe! 20 days
---
Its 15 with greater blessings
---
Ironically hunters dont really have bis guns so u gonna be playing the dwarf trailer with bows or xbows
---
hahahah
---
So... you tagged a post with "news" when you literally admit elsewhere that you have no idea if what you wrote in the OP is even true, and you're not presenting a news article or blue post or whatever.
---
yeah. And 400 people thought this was worth upvoting.
---
I see you too dual wielded swords and wore full Scarlet mail.
---
Idk where he's from but in most central and northern european countries everyone gets 4-6 weeks paid leave by law.
---
Wooot can’t wait to find a good horde guild, we have about 6 rl mates rdy to go right now!
---
Ret is significantly easier to level than rogue. Steath is nice utility, but when it comes to pure leveling speed rogue is almost as bad as warrior. It makes no sense to rank an above average leveling spec like ret worse than rogue, which are literally the 2nd worst.
---
Yeah, the "nomod" is a product of me trying to sneak [@player] into these macros as well but I had to abandon it, the conditional broke all of functionality for me. 
---
I'll try the shortenings once the servers go live.
---
yeah the boys, I'm going to a LAN at Box Hill for release
---
Great post, simple and easy to read but contains a lot of important information. I'll be saving this to my PC and posting the link to this page in my guild's Classic discord.
---
when I'm a geared 60 druid (speak as a druid from 04 beta), I'd win a lot of 1v1 excited :) gonna be on a PVE server though
---
Probably why no triple A development companies are in Australia. Because you get paid for the hours you work here.
---
Yeah true, but its always a good thing to consider as you basicly get free talent points because of gcd
---
This is a good point.
---
The gaming culture has changed a lot. I think it's only natural though, humans strive towards efficiency in everything.
---
I think it's a big reason as to why WoW went in the direction it did, too much focus on efficiency and removing all the "time-waste" activities.
---
All you people hating on this must be well fun at parties. Oh wait...you don't get invited because you are A+ grade c*nts.
---
I deleted my character at level 40 because I couldn't stand her haircut any longer.
---
Feral druid doesn't have any downtime. Self healing plus +movespeed from forms. You would have to spend time eating with your rogue. Also, its easier to take packs of mobs with dru.
---
Oh man, that reminds me of seeing the rested Zzz on my character frame so I tought i had to sleep to make it go away
---
Are you thinking of my healbot Jonchron the dwarf priest? I was the warrior.
---
IIRC only other hunters can help. I remember having my hunter guildmate help me for 1 or 2 of the bosses on my alt
---

**Semi-casual** experienced raiders - some from vanilla, others from more recent times. We are a friendly bunch, although our humour can be unapologetically crass at times.  **We are in no rush to get to 60** and are excited to take the time to rediscover Azeroth.

**Raiders are expected to pull their weight** – the usual criteria apply: be prepared, know your role, be cool, don’t be terrible, etc.

LOL 😂😂😂😂😂😂👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
---
Lols :D
---
It's not necessary to be prot specced outside raid dungeons and outdoor raid bosses really.
---
You should "tank" 5-man content in arms spec and most of the time use a 2-H weapon just to do as much dmg as possible, firstly you keep aggro, secondly you deal damage and thirdly you mitigate that damage to make the healers job easier. If the healer whines about you taking too much damage without him actually going oom you post the dmg meter where you have more than twice the dmg of everyone else! 
---
(In some groups you might want to equip a shield and 1-h to prevent whipes or group disbands :p )
---
the 531 mounts and 986 pets you can collect didn't do it for you ?
---
I assume it's Paris as the other retail servers, but not been confirmed I believe.
---
270 days played om my vanilla hunter. I cant throw that advantage away by playing a new class 😃
---
Paladin, yes please! I see You are a man of culture as well
---
or used engineering gizmos themselves
---
Never! That is the big point why classic is (imho) better than new wow. The sense of accomplishment.  
---
I remember trying WoD again after quitting in the middle of WotLK;  
---
Log in, press a button now I am in a dungeon with people I do not know. The tank starts running through multiple groups and no-one speaks to each other. I heal like crazy and I can't even spend all my mana, all I do is spam heals like there is no tomorrow.  
---
We clear the instance and everyone leaves without a word. I get some epics that I could not care less about.  
---
I remember doing DM in vanilla;  
---
Log in, socialize a bit and see who wants to go DM, we get a group and walk to DM, some people "just need to get something" so it takes a while but that is ok, we just make a fire in front of DM while keeping the mobs outside at bay and helping some lower lvls.  
---
After getting to the instance, which is an adventure in itself, we need to be present at all times as one runner can pull multiple mobs and wipe us. I need to manage my mana and time my heals. After a good long while with many an interesting conversation, we clear DM and I have a new blue staff, it feels awesome!  
---
Perhaps the saying "It is about the journey, not the goal" is appropriate?
---
He was just defending his homeland.
---
you're very welcome, thanks for watching
---
It was a joke.
---
Hunters offer utility that other classes dont have access to. CC, tranq, kiting. Hunters dont stop being useful.
---
I planned for gehennas when it was showing medium
---
Now I got no fucking idea. Need a F R E S H one again.
---
Blizzney pls moar pvp
---
That would be amazing to see Blizzard implement, "JUSTICE FOR ZANJIN" somewhere in retail.  Just need a few NPC's saying it around Orgrimmar.
---
There was a keybind for scan-targeting in stress test. Can anyone explain what it actually does?
---
Absolutely.  There’s been a general move away from this kind of activity in the industry recently.  Sure it still happens, but the fact that the beta and stress tests seemed to indicate the game is very playable would indicate that they’re in good shape from a project perspective and the kind of crunch he’s talking about is pretty unlikely,
---
Stating they are working 80 hour weeks as if it’s fact is just horse shit without hard evidence.
---
You still have to do that with this addon.
---
A fever? lol  The main panel that services my fiber line to a direct hit from a lightning bolt a week ago.  I was fearing a 2 week service gap, luckily they fixed it in 3 days total.
---
Why is this downvoted? Imo greatwizard handles mage exceptionally well.
---
I think I do !
---
Feels like I should avoid the first week of this launch.
---
Some, they're also way lower tuned.  Like parry being wrong and players having 4.8% more crit chance on private servers against mobs 3 levels higher than them than they do in Vanilla (and Classic) WoW.
---
In general if you don't want so spend time looking for group don't go DPS. Damage dealers are always swarmed no matter the class and there is always not enough heals and tanks. Sure as DPS its easier to find group as rogue/mage/warrior but there is TONS of other rouges/mages/warriors (if we talk about raids). In 5 man I don't think it matters that much.
---
Why would you concerned that you can't farm anything at 60 as palla heal? I don't understand that part.
---
Please do
---
Get dual monitors
---
Just a personal thing but I never join groups that reserve loot, even if it's something that I don't need. It just seems incredibly selfish to me. So what if you don't win the item, just run the dungeon again. Anyone who contributes equally to the clear should have an equal shot at any upgrades that drop.
---
thrall in Vanilla and wc3 was my REAL WARCHIEF 
---
LOK TAR OGAR
---
It's neither the only choice or the proper one, but I agree with OP in some regards.
---
The culture of the game shapes the game design, and this in turn leads to how it's played.
---
I think the primary example of this will be modern AV. I highly doubt it will take longer than 2hours, most AV matches will probably be 40-50min rushfests unless alliance decides to camp.
---
In vanilla the majority of people weren't minmaxing(how could they?), there was less focus on efficiency, most people were ignorant/bad, etc. this lead to all sorts of experiences for a lot of people--most of which will be gone and replaced by a different type of experience. Similar thing with PvP, in vanilla almost nobody had engineering. Today, everyone will have it. 
---
Oh, and I'm not judging, I don't think either way is better or worse. But it is different. I doubt people are going to feel like they're playing vanilla when you cheese a lot of raids by having 40 people have engineering, etc.
---
Yeah they prolly anticipate things better than us
---
it is a lie until proven otherwise you dramawhore
---
I'd have to disagree. I think their biggest mistakes were the ones that killed the communities that lived on each server. Server transfers, dungeon and raid finders, sitting in major cities and queuing without having to talk to anyone, it became way too easy to level alts or change your name, et cetera. Your character ceased to be a representation of you. I personally enjoyed level in most expansions (I think Legion had great zones) but the game lost that sense of community that vanilla and TBC had.
---
my friends reserved n ames on Shazzrah and its annoying as hell. I dont care about names, and dont want to wait for hours in queue
---
Chuck Norris doesn't deliver mail. But if he did it would probably be the best mail in the world of warcraft!

you can spec prot holy and be alright at both for groups

---
Merger
---
I remember we considered it a "good luck" charm for our MC raid nights to find a road of bones from the Kargath side entrance to Blackrock.
---
I will also be there... on that relm.. on alliance... although 1 week later as my annual mates camping trip has been booked for 28th-3rd.. was planned from last year...
---
Mages have better burst than warlocks, but warlocks do more overall dps in longer fights.
---
Damn this is literally me. Recreating my first WoW character, a Tauren Hunter on Horde.
---
Because it's never 1 Vs 1. That's such an extreme improbability and it's better to think of team perspectives too. Also priest fear has no cast at all. Are you gonna cs a succubus or the warlock casting fear?
---
As mentioned also fake casting is a thing or dummy casting, improved counter spell is great but in between cc'ing other people you won't always get the right call and will suffer for it.
---
I say if you wanna roll troll (I think? It's been a whole, I quit at mid-late tbc) then you do it man.. but from experience of HW's like Testone there's always tons of undead mages, well, everything in PvP and I totally get why.
---
I feel like theres a new druid spread sheet every 4 days
---
you are responding to a communist. just ignore them they are irrelevant.
---
Meant no offense. I am sure it will be full/locked on launch day :)
---
That troll got fucked up good lol
---
Warlock can be bursty too. You always have succubus and soul fire if you like huge numbers (bigger than pyro if I remember correctly). In general I think warlock is more fun than mage. Demons, plenty of viable different builds for pvp and pve, mount, class quests etc etc.
---
Been in hospital going on 10 days now with one of the worst double pneumonia cases drs in my area have seen. Patiently waiting for release so I can be there for classic. Pray for me brothers and sisters of the alliance and horde so I can recover and join you.
---
So for example I searched quartz went to curseforge  and on the right it says updated 4 days ago, meaning its all set for classic correct?
---
You could have that new Thex NPC that they implemented in retail shout it every now and then :D I mean Thex is classic - Zanjin was classic - you know :P
---
RemindMe! 60 days
---
If you want the hardcore 1 to 1 vanilla experience, go for the PVP server. :D
---
#MakeThexShoutJusticeForZanjin
---
The idea being that by then they will also be sure if new realms will be needed cuz by p2 the hype will be manageable
---
You realize the US gives more to charity (for the sick and downtrodden) than most anyone else? By the way the US military is Europe’s military. So you’re welcome for that too.
---
[Tuaren Hunter](http://www.warcraftrealms.com/charsheet/27259731). Can't wait to replay him!
---
I know, right, what do we do if we can't hate each other and tell each other we are wrong?
---
Let's just pretend it never happened.
---
post sources you crap eater
---
You can still ninja an item without ML and not being the group leader.
---
Is it possible to heal a pre 60 dung if I'm not specced heals
---
some aq40 gear pieces were so strange, i mean, will be :)
---
Whats the most no-life thing you've been doing in preparation?
---
Mind you, PvP is coming in phase two, and its world pvp, BGs are coming in phase 3, its like 1,5 year from launch of classic.
---
I was planning on 4 weeks vacation for Classic but failed to get it approved as the only other manager is out of the country for the whole month, but I do have 4 days off from the 27th so I'll be going HARD while I can.
---
Yass queen let me feel all the feels again
---
So mad lol. If you’re so jelly, roll one yourself.
---
up his ass and to the left. there are no sources they are just looking to start drama
---
I hope you are going with these exact same binds in classic too! True vanilla experience.
---
I love them, you take less damage.
---
Your poor keyboard
---
Sad days for Alliance.
---
She's a keeper
---
yikes
---
I laughed with him, he put up a show and i found the whole thing funny. Yknow, i was entertained by an entertainer.
---
In raids you will heal, but in 5 man dungeons you can tank and dps.
---
A guild doesn't usually have many druids compared to priests and paladins. So you will get gear faster.  You can then also start collecting damage and tank gear as druid, this will be slow, because rogues and other classes will get priority since it's your bonus gear but you will get  it especially the pieces that are not bis anymore for the rogues... Which are still very good epics for your offspecs . so in the end you have a top notch healing set and a lot of slightly worse dps and tank gear and will be a true master of all trades in solo / small group play.
---
I am going to be a druid this time.
---
&gt; and in particular the hunter was still in a very bad state.
---
hmmm wonder if this has to do with this launch patch being the worst patch for hunters in vanilla.... hmmm...
---
In general, people play pve servers cause they don't want to play world pvp. If you enjoy this aspect of the game, don't play on pve server. Yeah it sucks without friends (you can make new in game) but what's the point playing if you can't do what you like?
---
Fuck... I bet you were praying to the Titans
---
Hey, thanks for checking it out. Ya a lot of work was put in to account for differences in xp with pservers. The guide is updated frequently and will continue to be after classic launch.
---
Right in the feels... its like.. atleast 8-9 years since i saw it :')
---
Don't hate. 
---
Everything I said in that is true, sometimes you run into someone, who isn't just talking about the past, but was actually there, part of making that history. I could regale you with the interesting people I've recruited and or gamed with. From recruiting Thought and his brother to my guild in Ultima Online, the guy who made Thottbot, to raiding with Jeff Kaplan and Rob Pardo in Legacy of Steel. The guys who made WoW. To corpse camping Leeroy Jenkins, Anfrony, Ctide, Ardanus and the other P4L guys on Laughing Skull for hours when they "raided" the Barrens on their level 20's with my level 60. Ended up becoming good friends with some of those guys.
---
You can believe me, or you can choose to not believe me, doesn't matter to me, I enjoy talking about this stuff, it's a trip down memory lane, but the only person you're spiting is yourself. 
---
Here is another fun moment. Me and my buddy who went by the name Avingarde (he was the webpage designer for WoW, got hired after we leveled together), were the first two people to cap in PvP beta. The cap was 45. The total XP required to go from 44-45, was about 3x what the total XP required to go from 59-60 was at launch if I remember correctly. We ended up grinding the last 5 or 7 levels (Horde had barely any quests at the higher levels at this point compared to alliance) inside Stromgarde Keep in Arathi Highlands. We went into the ogre area which were all elites, and AOE grinded packs of elite ogres down. This was primarily possible because I was a mage, and he was a priest, and blizzard did a flat % based damage per pulse. So it did like 12% of the mobs total HP per pulse.  So we just aoe'd down packs of 10-12 of them with frost nova, blizzard and fear bombing. Still took days of hard grinding to do those 7 levels, because the XP curve was brutal at that point in beta.
---
It is almost a shame that it isn't framed.   
---
But i guess it is hard/expensive to acquire a frame that size.
---
Learn to time you auto attacks? I literally died 0 times from 1-15
---
Auto attack, run back, auto attack run back, etc
---
communist scum
---
If you saw a paladin buffing a raid every 5 minutes, someone was doing something very wrong and needless
---
Dude you need to learn the difference between optimal and viable. At no point did OP claim to want a raid spot in a guild going for w1 Rag. Ret paladins are not optimal no, but there will be plenty of casual guilds who just wants to see content and will bring moonkins, shadowpriests, ret pallys and arcane mages just for the fuck of it.  
---
Vanilla content (especially phase 1 and 2) is easily downable just by having 40 people show up, without an optimal setup.
---
Xyshina ... just killed a troll
---
Nah my dude. Hunter everyday.  There is a reason all world class speedrunners are playing hunters.  
---
Mage can port to cities, yes. And aoe, yes.  
---
But as Cauthon, a serious candidate for first 60, says: "You need to both quest and grind in speedrunning to 60. There is no one that will quest only and no one that will grind only. The perfect and fastest balance is doing both simultaneously." (paraphrasing, but it's pretty much what he says).  
---
Aspect of the cheetah and your capacity to just run and gun all day is so big for hunters.  
---
And when he means "grinding" he doesn't mean "aoe grind" but simply clean a zone. And a hunter that is permanently engaged against two mobs while moving and clearing as he moves is faster than a mage that has to handle everything to do a perfect pull and aoe then regen. Also your leeway for "failure" is bigger as a hunter than as a mage.  
---
100% the first 60 is a hunter. ALL the runners are perfecting their route on a hunter, there is a reason.
---
Why would they care about growth
---
Epeen thing?
---
Its already healthy looking in size
---
&gt; They already know what the tsunami of players hitting their servers at launch is going to look like, that has to a huge motivator knowing how excited everyone is for the game they are making.
---
Or it could be fucking terrifying knowing that one little mistake can cause a massive chain reaction and ruin the expected experience of hundreds of thousands of people. These devs are under immense pressure right now, there's hardly anyone in this position who ever truly enjoys stressing themselves out to this degree. If everything goes right (and that's always a very big "if"), I'm sure they'll feel very accomplished, however.
---
Imagine thinking all military members vote the terrible people in office. You're being obtuse on purpose.
---
the first PvP skirmish and Lok'Tar Ogar was invoked..... im so proud
---
every EU server will have a huge majority of people speaking English
---
Not really. Mythic + I thought about. But the hardest of classic wasn't far off. Without the ability to out gear it a month or two later for even the most casual players.
---
The FotW/Cannibalize pvp rogue wave is gonna be big.
---
Me too
---
It really depends on what the group is OK with and the composition of said group but usually people want to see that an item is an upgrade to you without a story/reason attached before hand. This is not uncommon and is usually OK if it means other gear can go to anther possible contender for shared items and weapons.
---
Best thing to do is screen people ahead of time and keep inviting them when you want to run something.
---
&gt; Imagine thinking all military members vote the terrible people in office.  
---
I don't have to really imagine that hard after looking at their twitter account : [https://web.archive.org/web/20190819072817/https:/twitter.com/MVGFPS/status/1159732898246909952](https://web.archive.org/web/20190819072817/https:/twitter.com/MVGFPS/status/1159732898246909952)
---
lot of pussies out there , good post
---
50000 hogger pics
---
The huge number of players currently playing are probably not in top500 mythic raiding guilds so that argument doesnt really make sense
---
hi i'm also here from the reminder train! choo choo!
---
I'm sorry I think there has been an error. Your title says "a  joke about reserve your name in classic" but you forgot to add your joke in the text box. Just FYI.
---
With BGs being cross realm, do we have any idea how many servers will make a 'battlegroup'?
---
Will Oceanic servers be crossed with NA/EU?
---
If there is one thing both gamers and the military can support, it's droning Arab civilians
---
You left an edit within couple of minutes of posting... nice!
---
But here it goes:
---
It’s not optional in this industry, you have no rights, guess what happens when a promotion comes? Will you be considered against someone that does overtime?
---
Or let’s say studio is cutting people after done game. (Happens all the time btw, as you have no rights) do you think they’ll keep you and let go someone that did free over time?
---
As clearly you’ve made your mind up and aren’t interested in what i got to say... I won’t bother going in deep. Jim Sterling made a very good video, like him or not, the video is good.
---
Or you know use the super stable tested and true 1.12.1 source client 
---
 that is in perfect playing condition and just fix the already known buggs.......
---
Thats dumb, my friends are on shazz and I dont have a sub yet. I want to play with them
---
i don’t think the points you listed make up for TBC’s flaws.
---
There might be but it doesn't matter because you wouldn't use them while tanking.
---
All tanking abilities are 1H when you are wearing a shield + 1H
---
That is all that should interest you.
---
Just got 2H for Solo leveling / outside dungeon leveling and go 1H+Shield for dungeons.
---
Go on YouTube and watch some of the guides made by "Skarm" and "MoneyNews" they are both great warriors while "Skarm" is more leaned towards tanking. MN is more for PVP :)
---
You can change "@mouseover" to "@target" or delete the brackets containing it, depending on how the macro is written.
---
But by doing that you could mostly just use the spells without the macros and the main benefit you'd get from writing a macro are the cancelform/startattack/stopattack functions. I would recommend you give mousever a try. It takes some time getting used to but opens up a whole lot of gameplay.
---
Warlock is not really easier imo. In order to level effectively, you need to manually manage your pets. Can’t just click that attack button and leave it alone. Each pet has various different abilities they can learn. Same in dungeons and raids, you’ll be expected to manage your pets. It’s kind of a pain.
---
That, and having to farm soul shards to do anything. And sacrificing pretty much one bag slot.
---
You need to join the real world and stop swallowing everything you read on reddit.  Crunching exists, but it’s not nearly as standard as you think, and it’s becoming less of a thing with much more gaming media attention on employee welfare these days.
---
I used to play it but I felt it ran like shit
---
Not well optimized
---
because it is threatening if people say your favourite pastime sucks. If it sucks and you like it, does that mean you suck to? or at least something is wrong with you ?  
---
So the idea that it sucks must be fought and defeated.
---
How is rogue leveling? That's my likely class for classic.
---
Ahh o/
---
Playing with 150 ping isn’t “impossible”. We had many oceanic multi glads in tbc some from Asia playing in battle group 9 which has mostly US players who’s ping was 50ms tops and ours was 250 at best.
---
There were topic in blizzard forum "show your name and rate ones above you"  
---
And 90% of the people just reserved some fucking names because they were short / funny / streamer name / popular name / meta jokes / lore characters.  
---
Like how fucking stupid you have to be.
---
This is a subjective opinion.
---
For PVP servers, most players would want to be infront of the pack. Some people may just want the achievement of being the first to 60. There are many reasons for people to want to sky rocket to 60, and that's precisely how they enjoy playing a game.
---
Ow hots fh4 fm
---
I think Blizzard started advertising classic in Australia today (at least I got ads about it on Instagram and Facebook for the first time today) so that's probably lead to the population increase.
---
Jesus fuck how'd you manage that? I don't even get 5 weeks paid vacation
---
what?
---
GTA IV and God of War.
---
Dungeons were far harder at endgame. Raids, only MC was really a cake walk. 
---
Yeah mechanics where far easier, but they where also very fuck up and die heavy. Which isn't really the case anywhere but mythics in retail.
---
Oh yeah! Maybe a day of the week, preferably one during the weekend. Let's call it "Sunday" after him!
---
Can confirm thorium is in, someone posted about it earlier
---
Strong opening with the red alert music!
---
Ive booked off about a week
---
Wishy washy comment of the year right here
---
Yes. Just have int/spirit set of gear if you're druid or shaman.
---
\*proceeds to level a warrior for the 4th time\*
---
Locking would be a terrible move on Blizzard's part as people who have name reservations on *Full* realms have friends and people they want to play with that don't want to buy a subscription 2 weeks in advance just to reserve a name. In the WoW Classic Reddit Census more that 50% of people who answered the questions did NOT have an active subscription - and that's people who actively follow the reddit who are more likely be aware of name reservations, some people don't even know it's a thing.
---
these posts are the prove the r/wow community is coming to this sub
---
I hate it how Americans glorify there military so much.
---
And then even call it Charity, they are the USA military. They don't need charity. 
---
Give charity to boys who don't have a computer in Africa or something.
---
You make me sad.
---
2020? :D
---
That kind of guild will have big problems progressing
---
Mature language is just their way of saying its not allowed.
---
It will be the same with trademarks like Blizzard or Warcraft.
---
The answer is simple. Vanish has the sub effect vanish\_purge that allows you to do that.
---
Stealth (and shadowmeld is nothing other than a stationary stealth) does not purge incoming projectiles from you. Neither does it purge the targeting of pets of you as they will continue to chase you down even if you stealth after they got the order to attack you.
---
HOW DARE YOU LIKE STREAMERS YOU FUCKING HEATHEN!  
---
oh yeah /s.
---
There can only be one king 👑
---
They have been theory crafted to death. But that only highlights how bad some are early. 
---
I agree once raids are on farm you'll see a lot more. But I'm not going to pretend it'll be common.
---
if both players, the rogue and his opponent, know the match up, execute it correctly and have all cooldowns available, rogues will almost always win against any class.
---
/train
---
This is good to know for WoW fish farming
---
BAGS!
---
I agree, just gotta remember though, all the people that are cramming into reddit, discords, reading leveling guides, getting addons, joining guilds, etc - are not actually the majority. There will be plenty of normal people playing at launch.
---
PvE pvp professions.
---
What do other mmorpgs have?
---
Keep em coming.  I will just continue to replace my existing save file picture with the new ones.  Thanks for this!
---
It's not enjoyable to play with high ping.
---
I was about to go priest but I lean forward to Holy Paladin. There won't be too many of paladins and they are definitely needed in raids. And they are much better PvP healers I believe?
---
How do you know it's bigger than the forums - do you have actual numbers to back that up?
---
Also it's definitely not one of the biggest growing communities on Reddit. For example, this sub has 190k subscribers, r/gaming has over 20 million and r/wow has 1.1 if you wanna compare.
---
This is a niche community that's at its peak and will slowly start declining after release. Let's not pretend otherwise.
---
Here you go: subredditstats.com/r/Classicwow
---
I'm just excited to have buttons again.
---
I've been playing BfA now I'm resubbed and my Fury warrior has just huge empty spaces on the action bars where my old keybinds are redundant because there aren't enough abilities to fill them.
---
It's wild that the net impact of multiple expansions is that I have less abilities than when we started.
---
Kind of irrelevant, but I just checked out my retail characters as I wait for Classic to release. I have a Death Knight named Billcosby. Talk about didn't age well.
---
main theme is a lot of magic dust and goblin rocket helm usage. plus a lot of p-server nonsense (melding a pom pyro or DC)
---
other than that the only worthwhile mention is the insignia during the kidney  while the rogue is in his GCD, but that trick is - well you can probably guess - as old as vanilla
---
don't feel attacked
---
It was additional as I remember.
---
&gt;Hunters still have melee (...) even if you're in their dead zone. 
---
Huh, I guess you don't know what the deadzone is. Just fyi, the deadzone is called "the deadzone" because you can neither shoot nor melee.
---
Have fun!
---
OMG THANK YOU 
---
i was searching for it for years now
---
\&gt;YES ITS FAKE, BUT...  
---
No. Don't.
---
based on? you're rejected.
---
Do 'Blizzard' and 'Activision' also contain "mature language"? If so, it could be because 'King' is a game company (Candy Crush and other crap) owned by Actiblizz and they might want to prevent people running around, denigrating their company names by spamming in trade / sucking in instances etc.
---
Sticks and stones
---
As other said. I just wanted to add, that in your example would be much much better to go feral for leveling and just keep intelect gear for healing. Leveling in resto is pain.
---
No
---
Thanks a lot
---
Oh, I was thinking more the toon's name. Friday, Saturday, Xyshinaday
---
Not even sure, the majority of his videos are mage aswell.
---
Why is so hard for people to understand that a medium pop server in Classic is still like 15k people? Not to mention Gehennas is now high too. 
---
*Additionally,* I bet a load of people will see the launch week queues on Shazz and just give up and move to Gehennas or any other realm they open.
---
You got 99 problems my friend but server pop ain't one of 'em.
---
How do you daze them if they are far up in the sky?
---
Yes. There will be lots of them little fuckers.
---
how to stop ninja loot?
---
R: Build a white list of good people whom you enjoyed to play. And a black list of ninja/problematic players. You can share this info with your guildies and your guildies can share with you. I'm not sure if there's an addon to sync this automatically. But i remember doing this in vanilla and was really effective. Also if you fill with as many guildies as u can you will minimize problems inside the dungeon.
---
There is gonna be alot of mages , rogues &amp; warriors.
---
But every 40man should fill atleast 4-5 mages min.
---
About a month if you spend a few hours a day PvPing.
---
Below 30 yes.
---
After 30 no.
---
It actually works more like "aiming", so tab targetting usually target the "nearest enemy" , If u Fight 3 in meele range ull Switch through the targets.
---
Think of Scan-targetting like u have a crosshair in the mid of ur screen, the target u look at (which is in ur "crosshair") will be locked, No Matter If IT IS the nearest or not.
---
Thanks, awesome its in classic ! :)
---
Short answer.. Yes.  
---
Long answer... YYYYYYEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSS.
---
Are rogue and warlock a good leveling combo on pvp server?
---
levelling is the main appeal of classic to me, but i dont want to get my first character to 60 and realise i dont want to raid on it, and then fall behind on raiding while i level up my next character
---
How do you do that to a mage who sheeps you, then blinks runs and mounts up?
---
Mages are easy, they may not have a pet like hunters but in turn they have a lot more slows and snares. A main reason why hunters are much faster levelers is because mages have to waste time drinking for mana.
---
Also, do note that this whole "warriors are so hard to level!" is exaggerated a lot because people like the memes of it and the whole "vanilla is so much harder than retail!". In reality leveling is not hard for any class. WoW was originally designed to be way more casual than other MMORPG's on the market. The thing is, warriors could be considered "hard" if you have a modern gaming mindset - trying to pull more than you can or watching Netflix and not being aware of your surroundings. They also have to eat for health and relies a lot on gear to be strong, which can be a problem when leveling (except a few times when you can get some good blue weapons).
---
In reality if you have the mental capacity to think "last time I pulled 3 mobs I died, maybe I should pull less this time" and "okay, I'm at 40% health, maybe I should eat instead of pulling the next mob, since apparently a mob takes 60% of my health", then you are fine. If you don't, then the class is clearly not the problem.
---
Not as much as Rogues.
---
So keen.
---
You it’s have any torr till uhs
---
Again that's one person. Is that all of the military on that page right there? That's whoever is running their twitter. should they get rid of that yeah but again you are placing all military folks in one category with even knowing them. I was in the Marine Corps and I'm highly liberal so assuming because the twitter owner made a fucked up post doesn't mean anything.
---
Playing the game.
---
&gt; It’s not optional in this industry, you have no rights, guess what happens when a promotion comes? Will you be considered against someone that does overtime?
---
You're incorrectly intimating that a person is somehow in an indentured servitude relationship with Blizzard.  It is absolutely an option and you absolutely have the option to not take a job offered.  Being compared to and replaced by someone who *will* take the terms of the offer is just the way it goes in a free market.
---
&gt; Or let’s say studio is cutting people after done game. (Happens all the time btw, as you have no rights) do you think they’ll keep you and let go someone that did free over time?
---
You don't have the right to tell a company to continue to employ you but that doesn't mean that you somehow lose the ability to find another job somewhere else, switch industries, or quit.  Stop saying, "you have no rights", because it is incorrect and saying such removes all credibility from your statement.
---
&gt; As clearly you’ve made your mind up and aren’t interested in what i got to say... I won’t bother going in deep. Jim Sterling made a very good video, like him or not, the video is good.
---
Unless Jim Sterling is going to confirm that you are required to work for a company, what he says isn't going to matter in the context of this discussion.  You're stating, as a fact, that there is absolutely no choice/option which is plainly false. 
---
And yes, as of right now, I've made up my mind because you haven't replied with any compelling facts to dissuade me from my position.  In fact, the basis of your argument, "you have no rights" and "[there is no] option" is without fact at all and merely an inflammatory statement that seems to be stated to elicit an emotional response - at least that's all I can gleam from it since it's not true.
---
EverQuest also released a classic vanilla progression server. It didn't go so well though and people preferred to stay on Project99 for their old school EverQuest good times.
---
The biggest problem was paying $15 a month for a twenty plus year old game. I would've considered it for a much lower cost. 
---
The biggest hurdle to clear for most people will be the combat gameplay and actual rotations of Vanilla WoW. Compared to retail, Vanilla's combat system is a clear downgrade. But will have all the advantages of a closer community, bigger challenge, nostalgia feeling, and more.
---
I think most will check out after a few weeks. You'll see a big surge, but then the nostalgia will wear off a bit. It did for me in 2011 when I first tried Project99 and just couldn't bring myself to keep playing such an outdated combat system. It was fun to revisit a world I spent so much time in when I was 8 years old, but it wore off after a week.
---
Every class will be played heavily, but mages are always useful unlike some classes. So you really can’t go wrong with them.
---
The best !@#$ing [Art] posting in a WoW subreddit in months.
---
I was going to do a stick figure "I drew my dwarf DK...or maybe my elf hunter, I haven't decided yet..." post.
---
ESO is purely horizontal progression and the game works exceptionally well.
---
medium sized for now, just like full, 75% of people will leave after the hype dies out (and/or streams leave etc.)
---
If you don't like it you can just quit is the worst argument you can give.  
---
This argument shows you have no idea how the responsibility looks like, never had bills to pay and probably still living with your parents.  
---
Don't ever fucking use it if you want to be percieved differently. I'm not even going into explaining why this argument is bad, it was explained everywhere by now.
---
Longer tenure than I should have, and I tend to work 50+ hours/week so I accrue even more.
---
Any new info regarding this.
---
My friends and I have decided Golemagg for now, but wondering between golemagg and gehenass.
---
And just yesterday I was reading a post that not everyone might make it to classic release...
---
I would be careful, as a Shaman you have to get the quest to get your Earth Totem at level 4 in Mulgore I think.
---
I would level in Mulgore until you hit level 4 and get that Earth Totem quest, do that quest, then you can think about running all the way to Durotar. It will take a long time to run there though.
---
Alternatively if you think the Earth Totem isn't very useful (you can get by without it for a bit) just level with your friend until you go to the Barrens, and there is a quest at Crossroads where you have to run all the way to Thunder Bluff for a decent weapon and you can do your totem quest then.
---
First ever character:  Orc hunter  
---
First high level:  Gnome mage  
---
First level 60:  Orc shaman
---
I still wish I'd made it to 60 with that gnome.
---
True, i didnt. Thats my impression though, i guess with succubus you have some ability to cc, but other than that i imagine its a struggle once a warrior/rogue/hunter engages on you.
---
I could be wrong though
---
&gt; In 5 man I don't think it matters that much. 
---
It kinda matters to me because I know raids won't be the issue getting a spot in regardless of what I play. So I'm concerned about not spamming LFG for hours to find a dungeon group.
---
&gt; Why would you concerned that you can't farm anything at 60 as palla heal? I don't understand that part.
---
Yeah I meant gold farming. Obviously hunter is king but I'm afraid as a holy paladin it will be a torture if I need to farm something on mobs for golds or for a specific drop.
---
I was in Seoul for a few months recently and made good use of the pcbangs. We used to play overwatch and had access to the various servers across the world, not just Korean, so I can assume that if you just open battle.net (which will be on ever pc because of the popularity of OW), and just change region you will be fine! Don't forget to enjoy the city through, its an amazing place, so many things to do and see! Classic will always be there, but you won't be in Seoul every day
---
Thanks, do you have a template for prot holy?
---
I don't like Kargoz's style of videos. He talks like he's totally uninterested, will skip entire slides or gloss over them without much explanation and they lack any sort of substance. I feel like I'm watching a workplace safety PSA when I happen to stumble across his 50-minute snoozefests.
---
Awesome! I tried finding some of my old vanilla stuff but I've moved a lot since then and it all probably got lost :(
---

---
From what I gathered there will also be lots of priests (after that idk how many won't abandon due to tediousness)
---
r/classic_priest
---
I was considering mining and engi but yeah that's an option
---
Oh SHlT that reminds me I gotta farm a whelpling pet in Wetlands again &gt;&lt;
---
Now this is a reply I can get behind.  Thank you.
---
No, I haven't worked in the gaming industry but I did, for 5 years, work in a commission only industry which I'm sure I could argue is worse than salaried.  
---
I would be interested in why you think the free market is awful and how you have come to see it that way.  Employment is different for different industries, states, and even counties.  Salaried employees often enjoy more flexible working conditions as an offset to some *crunch times* as well as often are offered better benefits, in my experience.  Salaried employees are not always exempt to overtime either, there are thresholds and these vary.
---
If you link the Sterling video, I will watch it.  Additionally, changing industries may not be something that one may want to do but it can be done and can be rewarding, I'm evidence of that, personally.
---
The wait is agony.
---
Ty!
---
Woah
---
Ok
---
yeah remember how Iraq and Iran invaded the us
---
Nice! Warlock will be my 2nd alt, I've also dabbled with them casually thru out the years. One way or another, a mage, lock or pally will end up as my main!
---
Just Jump in and Explorer talking to the npc with the Yellow ! Npcs gives you a quest. These quest lead you to different locations. Probably after the first major city you could look up some guides. But I would suggest you to play your way blind till to the max level(60). 
---
And only looking for some guides when you did all quest in the area you are and have no clue where to go next.
---
After you played to maxlevel you should probably looking into some raid or pvp guids( if you decided to do that stuff)
---
Yeah it got changed in the last patch before BC release, pissing a lot of people off who were nolifing the grind for PvP gear. Since that grind is part of the classic experience I doubt blizzard will go to the patch which changed the system to using honor points for items at any stage. ^^
---
IIRC account sharing was always banned, and people still did it.    
---
Yes a rogue camping your corpse can be annoying, but it's not like the only way to avoid it is to play 16 hours a day for weeks and make horrendously unhealthy life choices.
---
Should we really take into consideration server demography when choosing a class ? I'm struggling between rogue and warlock since I like both gameplay but I'm more attracted to melee, but I feel that the fact that there is far less warlock than rogue will make my life easier. I'll duo leveling with a priest tho
---
ok fair enough. we all have different humour
---
Reserve an item if you wish, but try to keep it just one item. Always make sure everyone know that x-item is reserved before inviting them to group. Good luck trying to get a group if you try to reserve all the items in a dungeon. 
---
After you lose the +mp5 neck from drakki for 4th time to a mage (and you are playing a healer) becouse it is "upgrade" for him, you start reserving it.
---
tyvm :)
---
You must kill him...
---
No, guild banks aren't in classic.
---
Maybe the WoW is the friends we make along the way
---
Mythic is way harder than Classic but Classic being equal to LFR? Don't be retarded. You can faceroll through LFR with no preparation with zero deaths while fucking up nearly every single mechanic.
---
Thanks kind stranger. I'm struggling with english since it is not my mother tongue.

Im in Wisconsin where I havent found a single job that gives vacation in the first year, and then after a year you get 1 week, and it overlaps with your sick time.
---
Excellent thank you very much!
---
Stop it I'm not old
---
Well, depending on the weapon... [almost comically big sometimes](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/123273-betrayer-of-humanity.jpg). Vanilla weapons were a bit less ridiculous though, so we're not going to see much stuff like [this](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/120083-armageddon.jpg). To be fair, some WotLK weapons were comically oversized on every race, but humans turned it up to 11.
---
Even at 60
---
Good news right?
---
I would sell my left nut to have a chance at a blank slate and experience WoW vanilla all over without any prior knowledge.
---
That was actually what usually kept me around. I do like mounts. But after so long, it doesnt hit the same.
---
ROLE-PLAY IN GOLDSHIRE
---
Troll hunter all the way, i know its hard to level "from 1 to 10 :P"
---
I could literally say the same that consumables and farming gold is redundant unless you are doing some hardcore raiding in classic. Raids are so easy you might even clear molten core with 20 people on launch so i wouldnt think that much stuff is relevant until Naxx. Since you said that farming ap is irrelevant, farming gear or some dps upgrade in vanilla is irrelevant according to your logic aswell then. Unlocking the essences is the biggest dps upgrade now, even bigger than some bis azerite or w/e.
---
Many classes have the best piece or trinket from m+, so if you opt out of m+ you will lose out a lot. I do agree that attunements and leveling is super grindy.
---
No they don't use tanking gear.
---
Classicbis.com
---
That should help get you started
---
So you _should_ fish there at 25?
---
No, the main thing you have to worry about are warlocks.  
---
But you seemingly didn't make this post to actually have a good discussion and you won't change your mind, so have fun getting absolutely wrecked by warlocks and priests.
---
Seriously, I stopped playing after LFD came out because the group dynamic seemed like it changed overnight. No one wanted a tank who actually pulled the mobs back anymore, no one wanted to do any kind of cc, no one wanted to talk or laugh or... you know... fucking bond as people playing a game together. Just teleport into some random place, I don't even know where it is or why I'm there, and roll your face on the keyboard while autorunning through. GO GO GO GO GO
---
Playing with randos from LFD feels like doing an escort quest with an NPC that won't slow down. I hate it.
---
Duddeeee I got to lvl 60 before even training slice n dice lol!!!!
---
Still gotta wait until 27th. You need an active wow subscription, no expansions required
---
Most of the information here is pretty solid. My best tip is to not spend gold as much as possible. Don't buy random pets / items off the AH etc. Another thing that will add up quickly is training spells you don't need to train. The spells you want to avoid training are ones that don't help you while you're leveling to 60. This will depend on your class so I would at least recommend familiarizing yourself with the abilities of the class you choose while waiting on Classic. The other example is abilities that have the same effect with a neglible damage increase (like a 4 second CC that does 30 dmg instead of 20. The money you save &gt; 10 damage).
---
The raid rewards are only *really* relevant to those who raid though.
---
That aside, why shouldn't the greatest rewards be locked behind the greatest challenges, especially challenges for big groups - The M in the MMORPG?
---
Personally, if I read the quest texts, a good portion of the quests in the game are fantastic - from a lore/writing standpoint.
---
Can you let people play how they want please?
---
Hi, /u/Molten_Cora

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cse9oa/so_hyped_for_classic_watched_this_3_times_today/). 
---
&gt; Also I used to sell my broken armor and buy new ones at vendors. 
---
That is just spectacularly hilarious! Laughed my ass off. Thank you.
---
I use a combination of willitclassic and twitchcurse. I look for the addons on willitclassic and if there is no curse link or link to github I google the name with +classic. 
---
Some addons on willitclassic are just ports from random people even tho the real devs are working for a classic version. E.g Titan Panel. 
---
All the classic sites you linked most likley wont work with classic because they are based on the old client, but blizz is using a reworked retail client.
---
Also the good old mandatory medal of honor quote: "mess with the best, die like the rest"
---
I might upgrade by then but I still want to play launch.
---
Play on RPPVP server then.
---
25% of whatever  Shazzrah's pop is even better than 3.7k that will dwindle more and more until it's dead
---
&gt;all sets from raiding are for tanks
---
So they use non-set items.
---
Please dumb that down a bit more for me please. Thanks.
---
Savory Deviate Delight.  
---
Ever heard of it
---
I can't find sandbox ;(
---
I think you start with the class you feel the most for. 
---
Just level the other one as a alt later. 
---
Myself I’ll be starting with a rogue and level up a lock some time later. 
---
Sure it’s smoother to level as a lock but right now I have the urge to play a rogue.
---
I will not take advice from alliance scum. Just kidding. not a bad idea.
---
Makes sense. Judging by the retail pugs you get into, there are an absolute ton of Germans playing WoW. Don't know what they were thinking with 2 realms.
---
under some circumstances sure OCE would be better. 
---
but im the GM of a morning guild with 60+ members ready to go on launch day so lol
---
QC is a slice of life comic, this strip is mostly about the girl in this comic's social isolation and how doing things like this are bad for her.
---
My mate also be like "Vanilla is really great, but you also should be prepared that it is NOT EVEN CLOSE as easy as it is right now... back then there wasn't things like LFG, no things like having Twinks.. you have your main, which require you several weeks of HARDCORE playtime before you can DREAM OF reaching max level. Getting purple stuff would require you to be very active, since you need a good raiding team to be able to beat any raid. The problem for casuals is that the good players will be already in a working raid team, way earlier since they spend like 5x more time than a casual player. So you will be left with the other casuals and to make a working raid team out of those players.. ha! Good luck bro! So there is a high chance that you actually will get bored after the very first hours, since you still will be under level 10 and have to reg HP/SP after nearly every mob."  
---
I love that rewarding gameplay with very high difficulty (Dark Souls player here), but I get that many people actually will HATE that :D
---
I really hope I can somehow get a decent raid team for people who have to work and cant junk into the game :(
---
Darn now i wont be able to play WoW alone in peace!
---
I think subreddit competition for goldshire painting would be dope
---
That's not completely right, but you know what? I'll just let you be you.
---
I'm rolling enchanting, and there is a mage quest that gives a quite good one.
---
It still is a thing
---
Didn't mean to piss you off, big man. Sorry
---
if the more details link didn't suit you, is this one would be good : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uCXQni8Ndf0RuKfgNUlQ\_jzfKIYmsCVuYXS\_P3OaKUY/htmlview?sle=true
---
I’m so lonely plz hold meh
---
perhaps, it depends on his job.. most oce raids start while people in Japan are still at work.
---
Both warlocks and mages benefit equally from Nightfall, it's the MQG in BWL that gives mages pseudo-heroism. After about 30seconds locks catch up with higher scaling from spell power per second casted.
---
This is great. Is there a classic druid discord I can join to get more info like this?
---
I only have cash and no credit card Right now. What do you think about this one?

---
Most titles are restricted. Even "Mr" or "Mister".
---
I made an Orc Warrior called Evilgimli got it to level 10 rerolled alliance and made a Dwarf Hunter called Hunterz LoL I was very young lol.
---
For sure. And yet, that doesn't disprove what I said, for what you're talking about is the skill floor.
---
If I roll Horde on a PvE server will the population skew towards alliance be a problem? Will I still be able to find pugs and things or will it be a ghost town?
---
You will be able to kill people but you'll get literally nothing for killing people. Honor system will be implemented in phase two. So from phase two you will be able to rank and get PvP rewards.
---
If you're looking to avoid PvP you'll want a strictly RP or PvE (Normal) server. On a normal server, yes you can toggle PvP on or off.  It's up to you from there if you want to RP or not! I don't think you'll run into any server right now with low population issues. As always, hope you have fun and enjoy the experience.
---
You will totally be able to world PvP at launch but you won't have any reward (except pride / frustration ...) for doing so. Honor system (including ranks) starts in phase 2, battlegrounds (AV &amp; WSG) open on phase 3.
---
Even with all its wrong information and a human hunter.. I love this episode so much. Can't wait to "fight the blood fish at Jerod's landing" again. lol
---
Hmmm I’ve always used tag target, is scan target a bit better, more precise once you get used to it? Might check it out
---
They where probably thinking that more of them would be playing on English speaking realms.
---
First was a NE hunter. I was questing in the Wetlands, when I noticed my chatbox didnt work. Younger me didnt know you could /resetchat and thought I got muted by blizzard and deleted this character. I made a Dwarf Hunter on the same server which I still have today. I remember thinking that it was weird that they just mute characters and not the whole account. Havent really played BFA so he's still lvl 110.
---
Both of the current German realms are "Full" right now (Lucifron and Everlook).
---
It's been a long time, but my memory is that affliction warlocks not only can fight 2 or 3 mobs at once, but it's actually faster to do so than fighting them one at a time. Dot them both, juggle fear, drain tank, kite with dots, put pet on one of them, all kinds of tools.
---
Absolutely same you can do in 95% of Classic where the only mechanics are aggro management and dispels. Nothing else matters. On a random boss in MC/BWL 60% of raid can easily run into fire and die, it doesn't matter cuz you can kill most bosses with 10-15 people.
---
The only hard work in Classic is attendance for MT/OT and guild/drama management by GM. Everything else same like in LFR.
---
I did kill KT before BC prepatch and I remember how it was in actual vanilla. Would be even easier now.
---
Not behd
---
Use Joanas levelling guide IMO. The games huge and not always very intuitive. Joanas levelling guide smooths out the experience.
---
That’s a damn shame. Many guilds are going to suffer because of that 😕
---
Its now canonical - the alliance started it!
---
So pretty much up until raids?
---
but anyway, if you are interested, my guild is semi-hardcore, we will raid 8/9PM Japan time mon/wed/thr.
---
raid roster is already packed, alliance, on Pagle (PvE)
---
if you are interested message me.
---
Why aren't alliance and horde zones each blue and red? Contested zones can be orange.
---
We don't now yet the timeline of phase releases but the general consensus is far from 1.5 year for phase 3. Most speculation are about phase 2 before end of 2019 and phase 3 ~spring 2020
---
500 bucks can get you a pretty decent used or off-lease laptop.
---
Didn't get to rank 14 but I did have something like 180k honorable kills when TBC rolled around.  
---
As a warlock, running into a well played and geared rogue was always pretty challenging. Never really met any good warriors though.  
---
Given equal gear and good skill, it was probably something like rogue &gt; mage &gt; hunter (if he gets the drop) &gt; priest.
---
Two
---
is it safe to bet on Gehennas? I worry that it will dwindle down over time and die out while  Shazzrah will continue to be top, people tend to migrate to the most populated servers
---
As a warrior DPS you'll mostly thrive on pieces that are not Tier, as most of the tier bonuses are geared towards tanking.
---
You should do stand-up
---
Oh really? Wow I thought it would be ali for sure lol. Got a link to these polls?
---
I soley miss the old version. It felt like a war! The fact it wont be the original leaves me concerned. :S
---
As a retired player coming back for classic I tried making a character Retail and leveling it. Made a Worgen priest. Raised a few questions:     
---
1 Why do I have infinite mana?  
---
2 I cant seem to die even after pulling 6 mobs  
---
3 Apparently i can just tag all mobs of other players and get free xp
---
4 How am I level 10 after almost an hour…..
---
20+ is where the world opens up and the hand holding starts to disappear. Before that, you basically had your starting zone and then the 10-20 quest hub (usually barrens or westfall). After that you need to switch between different zones, do a bit here and there etc.
---
It is also the point, where on a pvp realm, most players make first contact with the brutal side of world pvp.
---
Guildmaster's log, Azerothian date 45126-8. We have now tried to bring down the Four Horsemen for 3598 days but I fear this task is beyond us. Gearing up 8 tanks is simply not possible, their armor breaks long before we reach adequate strength, and we have to go back and farm new pieces of Dreadnaught armor. It's an endless cycle of blood, tears and despair.
---
May the Light have mercy on us all...
---
That should do. I read somewhere that any computer that could run it back then could still run it now. I could be wrong though.
---
Couldn’t* care less
---
I may be a Ret Paladin of the light and slayer of hogger.
---
But those rp-pvp people are whackjohs rping. Stay out of inns
---
My memory is that I leveled with a second affliction lock once, and we just ran around crowded areas dotting everything, to the point where it was difficult to even loot half our shit because so much was dying.  I don't even remember if we had to stop running, or just drop our and then run toward the next thing and the first thing would die chasing us, massive amounts of stuff would be feared, etc...     
---
"Live To Win" would probably be a viable double affliction lock leveling strategy if you didn't run out of mobs sometimes.
---
Never played a Mage.. so i play one now :D
---
I suggest the other way around regarding Engineering.  
---
Pick up Gnomish first and make all of the BoP items you want to use, then relevel Engineering and get Goblin.  
---
Voilá, you now have all the BoP items you want and you can craft as many sappers and Big Ones as you want.
---
Those were planned for Vanilla, but were pushed back to tbc, because the expansion was ending anyway. #Hopeful :D
---
There is no way of know what the total population on the servers are.  
---
Afaik, Low, Medium, High, Full only shows the current state of logged in players.
---
Give it a month. People will burn out.
---
I have the opposite reaction. Same situation as you, but I just got used to ganking and don't really think anything about it anymore so I will go PVP as always.
---
In the search bar.
---
"Casual good."
---
The crowd goes silent. There was a lively discussion just a few moments ago, but it's clear that the speaker is about to dispell all doubts and show us the one proper way of playing a fifteen years old MMORPG.
---
"Hardcore-"
---
The anticipation is palpable.
---
"-bad!"
---
The crowd goes wild.
---
You kept them account names uncensored....bless your soul. These heathens must be brought to task
---
I'm was planning on running a engineering warrior, but reading this, I'm starting to get cold feet.
---
Well now you're just changing the rules after you wrote them. First you said 75% will fall off, now you're saying even more? If that's true, even Shazzrah will be dead.
---
Besides, it's not like they can't merge servers. It will be fine.
---
2017?
---
Good story but Netflix used to mail dvds in the early 2000s
---
AtlasLoot has a classic version on curseforge. ElvUI will take some time until the devs get it done. But there is a working version for Zperl you could use until ElvUI is done. 
---
For the other ones search on willitclassic.com or curseforge.
---
Curseforge.com or legacy-wow.com make sure to select WoW Classic when choosing category
---
The keybinds! Ew! Haha
---
Also I like how it's the horde who started all of this. ZANJIN IS TO BLAME, we could all have lived in peace but this guy *ruined it*.
---
If a lot of people play classic, they have to do something eventually.  Either move on to TBC, or if enough people are playing, maybe make new "classic" content.    
---
But at some point, if classic turns out to be popular, the number of people who will grow bored with the same old same old will start to exceed the number of people who will quit as soon as changes to classic are made.
---
There's no feeling quite like forcing someone to make another character just to whisper you and tell you how they're going to "get you." Love stories like this.
---
Twitch App. ElvUI might be a separate download from the ElvUI website.
---
&gt;2017, the Ipod was still new, Netflix was just getting started
---
What alternate universe are you living in?
---
They did say that medium on the servers today is more playes then the most populated sever back in vanilla. So of a server stays medium that's more then enough.
---
And have been since the first 5 hours you could reserve names
---
What is so incorrect about it? Did fury get buffed after 1.6? If it did, during what patch and what was the particular buff?
---
That doesn't disprove what I said. A good hunter will be insanely different than a bad one.
---
I played private servers as holy priest, if you like babysitting children and doing mental math at the speed of ohshitohshitohshit yeah it can be pretty fun.
---
Google.com
---
I see some people who go feline swiftness then furor then Omen of clarity then natural shapeshifter. But at level 40 you must respec and go leader of the pack. It is too valuable (to me).
---
bgs are cross realm and remulos is probably going to be heavily alliance favoured
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGXjoAqjKFU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGXjoAqjKFU)
---
Dont forget the sequel tho
---
You’re insinuating that if they built a fresh new client they wouldn’t have those backend systems built-in and in place. 
---
You’re wrong.
---
You say underestimate, I say play it conservative.
---
If a realm can have 5k concurrents, and they see 18k concurrents they're gonna have 3 realms and then see how it goes.
---
2017? Classic? Uh?
---
depends... if you're a blue-geared mage/priest an epic geared enhancement shaman could probably purge and 1-shot you i reckon
---
Yes, that's why I ranked it under TBC, but still way above vanilla.  
---
Dalaran was super cool; raids were nice and could be pretty challenging, some sets were beautiful, Arenas &amp; BG were still high quality because scaling was still OK-ish. (Even though some crap started to pop up like DKs being OP on certain patches, the ICC legendary being OP etc...)  
---
It was walking on a fine line, but it was still a good extension. It went to this right after. Cata was half half, some things were still fun, but clearly deteriorating FAST. I don't wanna talk about all the rest lol.  
---
TLK is clearly in the "good" bag of WoW, but my book. I would even rank it higher than TBC in some aspects, some zones felt better, atmosphere was cooler (especially Dalaran &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shattrah).  
---
The graphics, you like or you don't, but I could never get into another MMO as much as in WoW because of that. Sure wow isn't photorealist, but it's SMOOTH. It doesn't feel clunky. Never found such a feeling on other games. Granted that I did not try dozens of others but still, quite a few. (Rift,Wildstar,TESO and I forget others I'm sure)  So I NEVER holded its graphics against WoW.  
---
So yeah, I like the first Xpacs of WoW very very much. It's funny we can all have different point of views hey ?
---
If all you want to do is play classic this is more than fine.
---
I hate shamans with a passion, especially ele shamasn which are just the most broken pvp spec. But getting one-shot by a full crit wf proc actually IS fun, because it only happens once in a full moon, compared to those reliable 5k pyroblasts from full naxx-geared pom-pyro mages...
---
Do you have plans to die together? What kind of a maniac are you.
---
Polling in OSRS has some issues, mainly the arguments and flame wars on Reddit and Twitter, but it's the best decision they made and has lead to some amazing updates.
---
I'm new to WoW so my opinion probably doesn't mean shit, but I believe Blizzard should figure out if they want to start polling new content a year or two after Classic is released. I know PServers were super popular, but I don't see Classic surviving more than two years **after** the last phase is released. Sure people will come back and some people will stay and make new characters, but will it be enough for a big, money-hungry company like Activision-Blizzard to keep it online?
---
Lol. I don't think you've ever played rogue at any decent PvP level.
---
Year seems off a bit. Maybe 2007?
---
Can't believe they didn't want to do any different language realms at first.
---
for leveling just level arms or fury (id say best bet is 2h fury till 40 then switch arms till 60) and switch to prot at 60 if thats what you're doing. dont bother putting points into prot though. leveling you can tank in arms ezpz just have a sword and board. Leveling in an capacity as prot is just making things harder for you than they need to be.
---
yeah but the guy writing it didn't specify "hybrids are only viable as healers in PvE, and yet may be viable with other specs in PvP since they can potentially 1-shot you"
---
You had me until you made your folly at alliance.
---
Bleh.
---
This is definitely an underwhelming guide, but if you will come up to make [classic wow gold](https://www.eldorado.gg/wow-classic-gold/g/14-0-0), we all know where you can sell it!
---
So cool! Look forward to seeing the next one. :)
---
I have no problems with someone reserving an item.  Just say so up front and it's all good.  I will either join because I don't want the item anyways or I won't join.  Don't fault them for wanting to be efficient with their time.  I can find another group.

Current job ends tomorrow

Next job starts first of october

Classic here I come!
---
It absolutely doesn't need to be done, there was no need to be in Iraq. I could agree that it's overall for the best of the world that the US has the single largest army, it keeps peace to some extent, but being in Iraq is absolutely not a necessity.
---
I don’t j is German, not sure why i clicked on the link. I’m curious if they’ll add another to NA this week
---
Just play what you want. You will find a spot if you want one.
---
The parents could perhaps invested more time into selecting a suitable server for their 9yo kid in the game rated for 12 and up.
---
I'm pretty sure an Overwatch sequel, or at least some sort of spinoff, has been rumored for much longer than June.
---
Honestly I’m pretty tired of this sub because everyone acts as if their way of approaching the game is the ‘correct’ one and everyone else is stupid. It all skews so negatively.
---
Like the pure hatred coming out of the community every time layering is the topic of conversation - it’s exhausting. There are people acting as if Blizzard is the spawn of satan for putting in layering, as if they didn’t have ANY reason for doing so. Every take is so dug-in and polarized. 
---
And I mean I get it. We’re all going insane waiting for launch, but holy shit. It seems like having an opinion and kindly disagreeing with someone who holds a conflicting one is a lost art among the majority of people here. 
---
Can someone make /r/wholesomeclassicwow for those of us who just want to have fun with our friends and be part of a positive community?
---
shockadin rides again!
---
That was exactly my message here. The risk is higher of a scandal when you launch lesser server then you launch more servers and you can just merge two if necessary. I mean they said it in their post. Medium Pop Server in 2019 is full in 2006. SO why did you opened new server in the start Blizzard?....
---
Holy crap thanks dude. Works best if you download them as PDF.
---
You think I ever went to that tab? 
---
Srsly though, it is not very surprising.
---
"Am I the only one who wants more servers?"
---
Soooo u/danielsunday is the reason sylvanas burned the life treee gj mate
---
I don't even recognize the gear my characters are wearing anymore because I didn't have to work for any of it. And I haven't put any kind of sustained effort into the game in years. I log on like a couple times a year at most anymore. But I'll be damned if I don't still have a knee-jerk fear response at the idea of somehow losing my account and therefore all my titles and mounts and achievements and whatever. *As if it fucking matters at all.* I don't even play anymore! It's insane that that freaks me out so much.
---
You can't ask anyone in your life to let you borrow their card? You can get a better laptop online. A used Acer Nitro from ebay is not that much more expensive and it's light years better
---
As someone who made a couple of WoW music videos back in the day... You can count me out. The cringe is too strong looking back :')
---
[Just in case anyone are curious which ones I made](https://i.imgur.com/ABQhlDZ.png). They were mostly watched by Danes.
---
I won't be satisfied if I'm not at least 27, but more realistically around 29.
---
If you're speedlvling the first 24 hours are the most important. Put yourself ahead of the pack asap.
---
The level squish was first talked about by Ion in a Q&amp;A quite some time ago, I'm pretty sure it was before this 4chan post, the e-mail was just something layered on top of that.
---
healing is fun if you like healing..... plenty of people do, plenty of people don't.
---
Classic has killed Retail in my eyes and my 450+ day investment is nullified.
---
I’ve LOVED my time with my Warlock, but 200 days of being a pet class is enough. I’m extremely excited for the Gnome Mage action.
---
People seem to think you just join a raid and theres some fairy who says who gets what.
---
You should never be in a raid like that 
---
Yea you get gear. If it's something you can use you are allowed to roll on it. But not for an off spec. Or your running a point system.
---
If your not using 1 of those 2 things your wasting your time
---
IMO yes
---
Me too! Tokyo here
---
Yeah, not a problem, I'll take my time leveling and will satisfy much of my time at 60 doing rep, getting quest gear, grinding my profs, finding recipes, etc :)
---
And what are the four guys doing at the back there? Looks like my kind of party!
---
Noone else needs paladin t2 though, its a spellpower meme set purely for shockadin pvp builds (and for transmogging rp'ers). preraid gear and some randoms from mc is better for holy paladins than both t1 and t2.
---
Honestly, no. I raided through Cthun and barely ever touched food. Even in retail if people don’t put out feasts I have no fuckin clue.
---
please stop spreading lies
---
yea cuz they give them away free
---
well I do have an extra one hidden somewhere but its a big ugly crt
---
The most overpopulated class will be warrior and least druid. Mages will be third most popular class imo.
---
It’s been so long. I can’t remember. I remember a dwarf and you killing me near thandol span.
---
it’s not funny we have different views, because your views were destructive to the industry as a whole, and caused the entire MMO genre to perish. you should be ashamed of yourself for contributing to the ruin of the industry.
---
I didn't mean it like that. I meant as in they see you and think "damn that guy's geared, I want to be like that." Which is something I thought to myself when I was a kid looking at one my servers Scarab Lords.
---
There aren't any RPPVP servers in Europe. That is his whole dilemma. Not enough servers.

I took week weeks off from week so that I can play classic for weeks.
---
If you wana be the man....
---
I don't believe it. Where's the body camera footage?
---
Came here to say this. PVE servers take away an element of the game, but that doesn't make them a bad server choice. It just depends on what you want out of your classic experience. The reason for the stigma is because it's super easy to be edgy online and parrot the opinions of top pvpers.
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE
---
Then they’re not friends. Fuck em!
---
Nothing new
---
They don't understand...didn't you see BFA?  They are in a tiny bubble.
---
We could always log to retail. Separately, of course. We wouldn't want more than 1 person per zone!
---
Tokyo here. I will be playing on Whitemane.
---
Ping to east coast Wow Beta servers was 160.
---
Ping to Cali servers was 100-110.
---
Either way very playable.
---
This has been seen by like over 1,000 people, it’s out there forever now
---
Best method to distribute loot.
---
Cause iam really good as my main
---
youre a fucking asshole for stealing his ongoing meme
---
Awesome
---
I really hope parody covers come back, like Nyhm.
---
I usually always play healer, not this time around though as I want to try something else... for once... but I will probably be forced to play priest.... again.  
---
Either way, healing is a lot of fun in my opinion. Healing does not have the highest skill cap, but if you do manage to increase your output with... 20% it will have a great impact on the raid in terms of stability. Or even DPS, as you can cut healers and bring more DPS if enough of you guys start to push. If two of your healers would increase your output with 20% it would impact the raid much more than 5 DPS increasing their DPS with 30%.   
---
Everything isn't about HPS though. Mana management and a sense of duty are imperative.  
---
In the screenshots ( [https://imgur.com/a/S6bepUJ](https://imgur.com/a/S6bepUJ) ) we could pretty much have 4 man healed Kael and Vashj. The HPS would have been higher of the top 4 due to not stepping on each others toes. And yes, I died like a fucking retard to a bugged Kael'Thas RIP Mana.
---
Well, I'm in NA and worried about there being any language barrier. so will likely stick over here.
---
But that is not really relevant to what we were talking about. Right now they make Classic, not WoW 2.0. What happens several years from now is a whole different discussion. I was pointing out that the reason why Blizz doesn't change quest and zones is not because of the cost, but because it would ruin the very concept of Classic and doom it from the start.
---
As for the future, they already stated that they don't want to run two MMORPG's with new content. Sure they can change their mind, but I think it is much more likely that they go for TBC. Making new content means they spend a lot of money making something they don't truly know how many want. Making TBC means they have to do way less work and know they have a market for it. At the end of vanilla they had 7m subs going up to 8m through the TBC pre-patch. That number went up to 11m in the middle of TBC. That's 4m that started playing in TBC and for them that is the nostalgic "start of WoW". Add in that many of those that played vanilla (like me) also fondly remember TBC and you have a pretty good indicator that TBC servers will not be too far behind in subs compared to Classic. In other words, less work compared to new content and much safer choice with almost guaranteed success.
---
But of course a lot can happen in a few years, no one can predict with certainty, but as it stands right now if Classic turns out a success in the long term, then TBC would be the next step.
---
All of Kalimdor is Night Elven homeland
---
Nah retail is mechanically much more harder than classics 1button spam but classic is much more grind heavy which makes it more fun for me
---
Generally speaking, PvP realms are usually Horde favored as Horde has the best PvP racials in classic.  The opposite is usually true of PvE realms.
---
she's an orc warrior and got destroyed in pvp by a mage one time too much
---
Druids just have more fun shit to talk about ;)
---
Did you succeed?
---
You don't know this and neither does blizzard.
---
I don't think you get it. The reason why everyone wants to get to 60 and get best gear is to ruin YOUR casual gaming experience by camping your corpse and then corpses of your friends and post videos of your humiliation. This is what classic is all about - go through suffering to become powerful and humiliate others.
---
Aminotright?
---
GOT EEM
---
Sorry, didn't realise it was the communities responsibility to manually ban goldfsrming accounts.
---
Next you're going to tell me it's the communities responsibility to balance the game by slowing your DPS if you're playing a stronger spec.
---
It's not the communities responsibility for a company to employ a basic fuxking anti-cheat. 
---
Play in traffic Bootlicker.
---
you dont really have to pre-research stuff but be ready to alt tab a fucktonne to check things during play cuz there will be many mysteries
---
the only thing u really should do is tell people u group with that you are new cuz nobody really expects to run into total newbies
---
Yes there is.
---
Week of PTO after getting back from the south pacific on Sunday. Getting a head start on all my peeps from work.
---
For the Alliance!
---
absolutely 
---
The majority of the player base never even steps into a raid. There is plenty to do with your time restrictions. Plenty...
---
When that game launches and i start levelling i will show them what crunch  is. 
---
Casuals !
---
Bank Alt. Tailoring for bags.
---
Did you even look at the realmlist?
---
Sweet i only got 1 week, Hope to get to 40
---
Still no german RP or RP-PvP realm.  
---
So Zandalar Tribe it still is.
---
If you take furor you are delaying LotP which is not good considering LotP is really really good.
---
The guide I used to this talent tree say that we can go 3/5 thick hide+2/2brutal impact if it fit our playstyle.
---
I think people are forgetting just how much running there is in classic.
---
Thex only true warchief!
---
K will do
---
I'd have your friend run to you. Way less people where you start.
---
That should do from a performance standpoint, but the screen is pretty low resolution, probably pretty dark, and also glossy (that is, it will be useless in a bright environment). No idea how old that thing is either. I generally recommend against buying used laptops. The battery may be toast, or may just die suddenly within the next few months, for example.  
---
I would recommend googling for "entry level gaming laptops" and finding something with a discrete graphics card.  
---
I second the recommendation for a used Acer Nitro, if you want to buy a used laptop.  But for 600 USD you should be able to find a reasonable laptop with a discrete graphics card that is actually new.
---
Make alt send stuff to it. End problem.
---
I made a post about it : https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cs6ufp/cheatsheet\_for\_druids\_wallpaper\_19201080/exd3rp9?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x

Kane?
---
From memory, older raids are still valid as there wasn’t a catch-up mechanic for gear, so you had guilds still running MC while also making progress in BWL to make sure enough people were geared sufficiently for BWL
---
For me it's probably mage or priest, played them both in vanilla, going mage in classic for the PVE and PVP, so much control in that class if you get good enough at it. Makes me feel amazing :) so thats most fun for me, hard to say tho in general.
---
ofc
---
Lol Night Elves are not like that
---
As soon as I saw your post I edited it.
---
you know this how?
---
50g / hour is a pretty standard farming rate and is achievable as a warrior, especially once DM jump runs are a thing. Let's say it hypothetically takes you 240 hours to hit level 60 on an alt. If you spent that time farming gold instead you would have 12k gold. This was already mentioned but you wouldn't have access to the raid gear you acquire on your main toon on top of the time spent not farming money. I personally think it's best to stick to one toon.
---
Go to your electronics store if choice and say "I want your cheapest laptop with a dedicated graphics card."
---
Can't dumb it down much more than that.
---
The same people shitting on this charity are also the kind of people to trash talk police, especially american ones. Extremely disrespectful and i sure do hope that karma hits the ones that are disrespectful one day. Funny how people on both the military and the police, not only in the us, without ever being able to do those jobs themselves.
---
 Just play the game, stay off these forums, stay off youtube, stay off twitch. Gold is valuable. Auction House is valuable. Enjoy. Fun.
---
I cover this demand here :
---
Orc hunter is hilariously OP against rogues.
---
Last raid tier I run over 100 freehold +10-+16 and never got my trinket in 405+, in fact I got to ~410 ilvl in the second week and got ~2 ilvl over the course of the whole raid tier, raiding mythic and getting ~world 680.
---
So the gearing system is fucked, both my twinks had the same ilvl and simmilar gear to my main, I basically never raided on my twinks and only did one dungeon a week to get my M+ chest.
---
On top of that you have to grind AP, but how much you can grind per day is capped by the amount of world Quests and it's also capper at a max level, which gets raised every raid tier. So you can enjoy the same world Quests again and again.
---
And I didn't even tell you the best thing: The AP required per level gets lowered each week so you actually get discouraged from grinding it all at once. 
---
On my main I grinder every single WQ for 2 weeks, when BFA came out, at the end I was level 19, a week later I leveled my twink and got to level 19 within two days. 
---
I don't have a problem with grinding, I gladly farmed slavepens HC and then steam vaults for days till I got my feral Maze,  but I want to be able to do it at my own pace.
---
Pretty much guaranteed front page of a sub every day.
---
Stonks?
---
If you did rework the old honor system, a high impact, low effort change would be to change the weekly point decay from 20% down to about 15-18%.
---
To my recollection, the reason it was so much harder to rank past 10-11ish was because every week you lost 20% of your contribution points. This was much higher impact at the high ranks because your contribution point total was higher, so at rank 13/14 you would end up having to hold top 5 or so standing just to cover that 20% loss every week. If players on your faction aren't coordinated into an honor cabal, you end up with big bottlenecks of players all putting in crazy hours just to stand still, which encouraged behaviours like botting and account sharing. 
---
Reducing the point decay % would widen that bottleneck at the higher ranks and have little impact on the lower ones. Plus, at least at a surface level it seems like a small tweak. 
---
To me, it seems very unlikely that they will make even a small change. To expect they will allocate resources do a total rehaul and create new content for their legacy game is very far out of the realm of possibility, in my opinion.
---
To be fair I don’t understand the directions anyways. Go south or Tanaris then go west until you zone into tanaris? What does that mean
---
Go look at old school RuneScape graphics.
---
There's about 100k players everyday onbat the same time during peak hours and we're all 20+
---
Where'd you hear they were downsizing? They laid off people in CS and CM so they could hire more game devs and accelerate development.
---
I always check vendor first, and then auction it for at least 25%-50% more. If it's already up for auction and it's under that price, then I don't bother and just vendor. If it's more than that price, I undercut it by 10% or something.
---
Don't waste too much time thinking about it, also don't ever feel bad for vendoring something vs storing it in the bank. A lot of stuff just rots away in a bank...
---
No, guilds used to have bank alts for this someone trusted by the guild held items.
---
Most of these ads are for TBC and later
---
At least they've learned and are now giving warning - new realms open on the 20th, enough time for people to coordinate.
---
Some do (including me), but the majority would probably prefer a german speaking realm.
---
If sharding was only in starting zones it means the ridiculous number of people simply get pushed into the next zone.
---
These min max nerds will not enjoy Vanilla with this no life approach.
---
Are there addons available for wow classic and can I download them now?
---
[willitclassic.com](https://willitclassic.com) has a list that marks them updated if they are and links to wherever you can get them. Tukui updated their client to support classic so you can get Elvui that way or directly off their site. The twitch app has classic support now so you can get any addons that are on curse with it.
---
Mage is pretty good once you understand the class.  Being able to agro 4-5 mobs is a true skill as frost and only good players can do it without messing up.  But single target max rank frost bolt spam and kite easy.
---
shamans is love, played them from vanilla
---
But I wish I would be able to play alliance now with shammy, just got kinda bored with horde. Especially that I would like to play pally too.
---
I didnt tell them shit.  Cause this is america.
---
I know~ the problem was that this resulted in account sharing and that is a whole other can of worms not to mention a breach of the ToS.
---
Nah, if I'm tanking a dungeon I'm only doing it because then I know I can actually run a dungeon without having to wait for ages. I will still roll on the dps gear I need for my spec and that includes BiS gear that is leather and mail. If you don't like that you can keep searching for another tank.
---
There is no official plan. IIRC they said they are interested in making TBC servers, but it has not been confirmed, or said, how they would do that.
---
Anything can happen.
---
this is the worst thing someone new can do
---
Isn't phase 1 over in december? :o
---
If you are going to roll a class based on empty raid spots, you aren't going to last long. Play what you want. Just by attending raids and not being a dick will push you ahead of 50% of people. If you talk with guild officers and learn about raids and class then there is really not a problem to find a raid spot.
---
Man I loved nhyms stuff, sure he was tbc but regardless, hard like heroic and ni hao were so dam good.
---
I really hope not. Listening to the community is fine, but polling everything just leads to stagnation and nothing interesting happening. It's just a cowardly way to develop content because you don't want to deal with backlash.
---
You never played on EU servers, did ye?
---
\&gt; So can I enjoy this game for a long time? I'm just looking for a nice game I can hop on for 1-2 hours every few days and have fun to calm down from studying+working. 
---
That's quite ok. You'll spend the next year or two leveling and running dungeons, which is the most fun anyway if you are a new player. In Vanilla WoW, most people never raided, either. I spent maybe half a year doing BGs, running 5-man dungeons and UBRS at level 60 before I entered my first raid, and I was playing at least 6 hours a day.
---

Vanilla was FULL of shitty things. It was FAR from being a perfect game, far far far from that.  
---
Denying the QoL and improvements is just being dense on purpose.  
---
There are nuances in life, I did not say "LOL BFA IS GOOD LIVE WITH YOUR TIMES". I said "many things in the first two expansions after Vanilla were good additions and things I would like to play again."  
---
Anyway, I'll let you in your puddle of rage and nerd sweat.
---
1 HOUR LESS TO GO!!!
---
Horde: orc in both PVP and PVE. 
---
Alliance: dwarf PVP human PVE.
---
The margins are not small btw.
---
Aside from the gear from dungeons and the rank 10-14 pvp gear thats all you got without raids. Raid gear is also some of the best gear. Getting rank 14 is no joke. try 16 hours a day 4+ days a week for 2 months doing BG's/pvp only to get rank 14 which is where you get your pvp weapons. Besides those pvp weapons the best pvp weapons are from raids.
---
Tauren Hunter named Rotar, if I'm not mistaken.

Go tailoring and enchanting or enchanting engineering, or engineering tailoring ? For mage

Blackrock Mountain entrance. Mind control hordies and throw them into the lava. If you are a NE priest like me, it would be extraordinary since you can cast it in stealth!
---
I'm not one that's racing to end-game, I'm not even going to be caring about that.
---
I personally wouldn't say that it's a big time investment. Get yourself an auction addon and a bank alt, get the alt to the auction house and scan it once a day. Your main will now only have to mouse over the item to see the auction prices and the vendor price. If it's worth auctioning based on that information, keep it.
---
If there hasn't been an auction for that item before, then I'd just vendor it?
---
If you actually want to have the most money for the least amount of time invested while leveling, I wouldn't suggest auctioning a lot. Unless it's sending your greens to your bank alt so you don't have to go to the city every time.
---
Just take skinning and race to lvl 60, at which point there are a lot of different farming methods to make money.
---
As is tradition.
---
Hakurai, Joana and another one that I forgot, it's in my bookmarks on my PC at home.

Ok thanks :)

it's not just for the US, OP has already clarified its a multi-national effort so simmer down.

---
This is peak performance. I love it.
---
Fact of the matter is that most builds aren’t ‘good guilds’. Ultimately you’re placing faith in a random person that you know very little about. 
---
That said, my primary concern is that no one can access the guild bank, either to contribute items in need, withdraw items, or to look and take general inventory of what’s in stock without the GM being online. Not to mention most hardcore players will have 2+ characters set aside for storing consumables, which strains the guild masters character slots more. Additionally, the amount of time a GM has to put into the guild bank organization, handing out guild mats, guild GOLD, is all made 100x easier if you can rely on your officers to do their part without ever having to know your account information.  
---
Account sharing is against ToS and the guild bank was added in game to meet the needs of the players and guilds, not to mention the time/money that blizzard saves when someone steals all the gear and money from the guild masters account due to guildbank account sharing.
---
What kind of dkp guild are you in where non-tanks can bid on tank gear?
---
Left ball from your perspective or the perspective of someone looking at your balls.
---
I would imagine that maybe every 2 years they reset the server, like a new season if you will, give people a chance to reroll and start over for those classic fanatics, maybe they wont, maybe they'll open a new server every so often. People have spoken about classic+ an extension on classic with the classic mechanics but new raids and content. Only time will tell
---
I'm in EU and I have always felt like WoW was a very very social game. So you could be right I guess?

---
Basically dps spec for tanking on a warrior is fine pretty much all of vanilla as long as you're not MT. The most popular is a fury/prot build that does quite a bit of dps and tps, along with being able to OT about anything. Just make sure you're defense capped.
---
Especially when they lose loot to someone who is just objectively worse at doing the same job
---
If you enjoy PVP, NE is worth considering. You can feign death -&gt; shadowmeld to avoid CC like death coil.
---
What exactly was entertaining about it?

The new ryzen chips with onboard radeon graphics are reasonable can handle low settings gaming for many games. Might be worth looking into and asking about on one of the PC hardware subs.

Why would there be french on Thalnos?

If they add to many there definitely will be dead servers

I **think** he meant the Corruption talent to proc instance cast shadowbolt, Nightfall. COuld be wrong.
---
Is the one smoking the chill server?
---
I will play to have fun...and part of that will be to fairly quickly make it to 60 with my first character so I can farm and make gold and twink my alts to make them feel more powerful while slowly leveling each class. I plan to create one of each class day one and run them to the inn , which will delay my leveling of my main a bit for sure.
---
Flash of Light is considered fun? J/K bud, have a blast in Classic!

wish it had more options than just bis

Oh shit I forgot ZG was a 3 day reset. AMAZING. Loved that instance, can't wait to farm it.

Scrump here if anybody can remember from BC/wrath days, which server u guys playing?

Mountain Mama

same
---
Im thankful for what you are doing and I can relate. This guide has info from the people that are making the sheets that everyone is using - problem was that 1 thing regarding the +hit/glancing actually been wrong on all private servers and was just released/calculated.
---
Other than that. I would say that people I talked to for hours and hours regarding the playstyle of a tank, gear etc are the No1 tanks and DPS Warriors in the world. No1 has ever done more threat and no1 has ever provided higher DPS on any "real" private server. What is the other things you complain about? PvP? Well I ran premades on Nostalrius outfarming any other Premades ever play on Nost. I ran a guild, most people enjoyed it. I shared info on many things - gold making, professions, spec, leveling I linked to other guides, exactly what is bad and shit about my guide? People can argue as much as they would like - but still I have proven myself more than any1 else thatyou could compare me to.
---
r/funny
---
That's not at all worrying that there's psychologists out there willing to take such a low bribe risking their careers.
---
Those are rumours for the next expansion. More likely each faction gets an offshoot from the other sure though. Alliance Undead and Horde nightelves
---
Reading Chronicles really made me see how the orca were prior to the corruption. And Thrall trying to bring that back makes it a clear choice for me.
---
I played alliance and rolling horde now for OP racials.
---
Lol
---
I'm rolling an Undead and questing in the Eastern Kingdoms specifically to avoid Barrens Chat and Chuck Norris.
---
Jax is right about spriest beating you but for the wrong reasons. Their dots do a ton of dmg and you cant dispel them outside of block / consumables. They also have a 4 second silence, they can dispel your buffs, they can fear if they are in range, and they have 2 schools to cast between so they can bait CS on shadow to heal to full after. They can do most of this stuff while strafing in and out from behind a pillar and make your life miserable.
---
List of mage macros? Addons maybe even guides?
---
Yeah I think that is fine as long as you tell the party beforehand that you'll tank as long as you can roll on dps gear you need.
---
2 weeks.  Stay-cation but didn't specifically say WoW.
---
Welcome to Sweden, our doors are open for everyone!

Well you will miss some action tho :), the real fight start in Barrens. arguing on the Barrens Chat!

Check the Thalnos Discord. I can't say yes or no, as I can't exactly read their channels lol
---
I think he was reacting to one of punkrats videos.
---
simple man here, give me water and free time
---
I think you underestimate the power of server pride and storylines and drama that can develop on a server. Etiquette and culture can be entirely different between servers. And the worst is that forced name changes make it so people lose track of eachother and the migrating community ends up in complete disarray.
---
These are well understood problems of server merges, both with other MMOs and WoW itself in the pserver community in early [edited out to comply with rules] when the main server had long queues and they opened another one with free transfers which in the end turned out to be populated by mostly hypebeasts and tourists which fizzled out. The remaining people found themselves on a dead server, and when they got merged back on the main one, people lost track of their friends and guildies.
---
There are 3 options to handle the population situation.
---
* Just deal with long queues in the first months, do few servers, and no layering at all.
---
* Do server merges.
---
* Layering
---
We obviously don't want queues in 2019 anymore, and server merges pose huge problems explained above in addition to the economy to a shitshow as you admitted.
---
So if done right, layering can avoid queues and server merge problems, while only having impact on the economy in the first months. Good tradeoff I think. In addition to that, Blizz already put big cash into developing the tech, so there never was a possibility of them **not** using layering.
---
Uh no, in comparison to m+ dungeons are not harder at all.
---
Minding their own business... in freaking horde starting zone?
---
I'm starting to wonder if it wasn't just them wanting to come off well when they reconsidered. It was so incomprehensibly stupid. /tinfoil hat
---
Level all classes you potentially like to 10, then decide wich one you want to 60.
---
Great Scott!
---
Thrall didn't do anything in vanilla
---
maybe he should get his ass outside his little hut in orgrimmar.
---
(He gives Hidden enemies - a low level quest - and you turn the head of nefarian in at thrall as well, that's it)
---
Yeah,  gold and items.  Real money trading.
---
Did 106 once.

Was exhausted for the two next weeks though. Since my usual work time is around 60h/week. (Yeah, I only have the Sunday off).
---
I think it means that at some point you will leave Tanaris zone and run into fatigue
---
I just happened to have planned my holiday of 3 weeks that period, got lucky!
---
Pffft trolls were there first.
---
Even it was exactly 15h 43m 12s, the german realms were full within the first day, and its nice to See them add more.

**About us**
---
Omega is formed from friends who raided together on private servers. We will be taking a smart and efficient approaching to raiding while progressing through all of the classic WoW raid content. This means that we value your time and for example we will only enforce the use of consumables when they are required not for raids on farm. Our method of loot distribution will be mostly EPGP with some items being distributed by EP only, more details are on our discord server. Our main objective is to build a strong guild community and progress together from MC to Naxx in an efficient manner. You can expect from us
---
* High level raid leadership and guild organisation
---
* Quick efficient farm raids and solid progression raids
---
* Mature social community
---
**Member Expectations**
---
* Communication, the guild language will be English
---
* Preparation, especially for progression raids
---
* Knowledge, know your class and know your role in fights
---
* Experience, vanilla or private server experience is a definite plus
---
* Dedication, we are recruiting 50 to 60 members therefore each guild member will have to maintain raid attendance of around 80%
---
**Raid Schedule, progression**
---
* 19:30 - 22:30 Friday
---
* 18:00 - 20:00 and 20:20 - 22:00 Sunday

---
If you played vanilla or on a private server, listen well and perform in raids, don't have all the time in the world but are able to still adequately prepare for raids and want to raid from MC to Naxx with a great group of non-toxic people, Omega is for you
---
The only people who are anti-loot council are the ones who showed up to raids with a shitty personality and a shitty ability to play their class and then raged when they didn't get every piece of that they wanted.
---
I always say that the real benefit of playing in a loot council guild is that it filters out the greedy idiots like this guy.
---
Took a week off
---
Does he look like an orc?
---
Trolls are older race then Night Elves. Sooo, make Azeroth Troll again.
---
I think I can safely bet this was on a US server, wasn't it?
---
Imagine being butthurt enough to spend probably 30min creating this lowquality meme.
---
&gt; If anything you could argue that amount of money is being subtracted from the economy because people won't be able to work while playing WoW
---
Absolutely! I am comparing WoW's value to people in purely monetary terms. WoW Classic will be very valuable to a lot of people (:
---
30 mil is the equivalent if that time was spent "working" instead of "playing". But also consider, time spent playing wow is far more valuable than ANY job ;)
---
I used to main hunter. That guy needs to be punched in the face...
---
That's why you use Thanagor. Which means king in Lordaeron language.
---
I have to admit I didn't know that AH-addons can display you the AH-price on items without you being near the AH. Having something like that would make the process of deciding much easier and quicker so I guess that's what I'll do.
---
Thanks for the mention!
---
And here I was laughing at the Americans and their 10k queues on Herod the other day...

Alliance 1-60 leveling guide. Step by Step.
---
Available as a Website AND In-game Addon.
---
Ive seen updated stuff on addons that were completely broken when i tested them in beta. Aka they were marked as UPDATED even if the information was updated. Willitclassic was nice when it launched to find ANY information about classic addons.
---
Twitch app finally somewhat works, it was a shitshow until recently. Hopefully they will fix the rest of the addons and some addons that show 8.0 as patch (or if it works on both they would have some dual classification).
---
Hopefully soon i can trust it not to fuck up and just press "update all". :)
---
Warrior dps gear consists of off-set gear. All Tier 1-3 gear is purely for tanks.
---
If you want to play a dps warrior you don't need to worry about not getting gear in raids. However, figuring out which pieces you actually benefit from can be tough, if you're not very experienced I suggest looking at one of the many BiS lists out there, just Google it and find one you like. 
---
I played a 2-H dps warrior throughout vanilla, I rarely had to tank and I was almost always fully dps specced and I was full raid gear epic geared by the time we cleared BWL.
---
I fucking loved those days and I can't wait to play through it all with my friends this time around.
---
I hope they don't play. Seems like the streamers condensed themselves to on server. If we have rogue streamers come in and bring their groupies and would kinda suck. Would be great press for the game but shitty for the servers.
---
how bad is the resolution if  you print it to be like a din a 4 paper ?
---
Yeah they were full pretty fast and we needed more realms
---
Narrow it down a bit then flip a coin. You’ll know what to do depending on how you feel about the result
---
Weryn, Human Paladin.
---
I'm somewhat biased on this, as I'm currently in an officer position in our guild, but I feel like we will make lootcouncil work as intended.
---
Our guild limited the trust issues by having a voice-chat meeting, where everyone had a chance to say what they think is the best - we discussed a few options, but the majority voted for LC.
---
All of the Officers &amp; GM were also voted in by the raiders (those put forward as potential officers had no say in the vote).
---
The end result for us was an officer team and a guildmaster that everyone (or atleast a clear majority seems to trust).
---
We've also opened up easy channels to contact &amp; contest the officer teams decisions.
---
We also post the results of the officers discussion publicly so people can comment on that.
---
Fk you #nochanges
---
All spells. It's a great leveling talent.
---
You really nailed the "extremely shitty" part!
---
Nobody was killed in the alpha phase? :p
---
DOWNVOTE
---
How about
---
Dude it’s not the same, I’m french too. Yeah it’s a joke in Dexter but we would never say that it’s flat out bad grammar.
---
It's more reasonable to compare MMOs to each other and especially different versions of the game don't you think? 
---
And yes I agree, classic isn't difficult and I don't think any other MMO is difficult either so what's that difficult game you are talking about?
---
When in doubt, roll dwarf. Sweet beard, hilarious run animation, says “Aye!” a lot.
---
We gotta stop deathwing before he destroys the planet.
---
Maybe you should learn from your past mistakes and not be in cesspool guilds?
---
I don't know how to feel about new content. I'm sure it will be needed at some points keep people playing but some of the appeal of classic wow to me is that if I get some crazy item or tier set it's not going to be made irrelevant by a new big expansion
---
I don't know why this is downvoted,  RMT is a huge problem for classic because gold is so valuable. I suggest getting an addon called spam filter, unless you like reading about 700 gold advertising messages a day.
---
The entire planet belongs to the Alliance
---
But there is something special about getting a group of 40 people together to take down big badass bosses, preparing with materials for days before, planning and communication.
---
I found the best way to make a decision is organically.
---
Start by creating the race/class combinations you are most interested in.
---
Play them all for a little while.
---
You can then see what you feel like playing the most each time you log in. After a while you will have formed a clear preference.
---
Will do, thanks!
---
cool
---
Id do the same if there was a pure english server. Unfortunately lots of players who play on english servers dont speak English :(
---
The only mythic raid in MoP was siege and they added that way late. Mythic raids started getting difficult in Nighthold in Legion, usually the last 2 bosses are really really hard where the previous bosses are much easier.
---
No thanks.
---
Can see alot of hate coming this way
---
Thanks! I've already been the Seoul 5 times so most of the things I've already seen. But there's more to explore for sure.
---
Hi
---
What races are eligible to the class you intend to play?
---
Tell me and I'll decide for you.
---
And if you don't like my decision, you can at least strike the one I chose from your list of possible choices!
---
Exactly. The night elf was just running around, exploring Durotar and suddenly she gets attacked even though she didn't do anything! Typical Horde!
---
Alliance is USA, it seems.
---
&gt; I miss back when not everyone got to do all content.
---
The feeling of mystery and wonder was mostly to do with being brand new to the game (also being much younger). There was nothing stopping us from joining a guild and doing that content, but we didn't because the concept of raid schedules, DKP system, voice comms, farming consumables, etc came across as super hardcore. 
---
 Nothing in classic is going to bring that feeling back for veterans because we already know what endgame raiding looks like, and we also know that vanilla/BC raids are hilariously easy compared to mythic raids today.
---
yea same here. always been on horde side but i don’t know if i should stay horde.
---
i‘m only interested in pve so alliance would make more sense but still not sure.
---
only thing i know for sure is that i don’t want to play on pvp servers.
---
lol " come back to the real game " nobody plays this shit anymore they do realize that dont they?
---
Wrath completely stagnated the growth of WoW. The only growth that occurred in the Wrath era is when the expansion was announced and when Cataclysm was announced.

---
Wrath was the beginning of the end.
---
Nope
---
Going to Shazzrah with my guild.
---
No. Go back to retail. :)
---
Often mana efficient pvp builds tend to be the best leveling ones
---
I'd much rather raise money for a charity that cost-effectively saves the lives of innocent people (including children), rather than one that gives presents to people who kill others in the name of "peace".
---
If you've always been on Horde side stay on Horde side. After a while being in a different faction will feel weird and you have already invested too much time to switch back.
---
I'm hoping Arugal fills up even more so I can play alliance on that server and horde on another.
---
Hoo, you're "one of those". Yeah, I'm gonna keep it short because your foam-mouthed smelly nerd type is not really interesting to talk to.  
---
Maybe it all evolved that way because that's what most people enjoy ? Maybe old school shit like Everquest or DAOC did not interest enough people ? Maybe they died out because they simply don't appeal to enough people. And I can't blame them.  
---
RP on a digital support is soooo limited anyway. If I want to RP, I go play some D&amp;D IRL so imagination is the limit. And not the handful of emotes and gear I have in a game. My imagination is not limited by the hard cold code of the game.  
---
There is a reason that kind of shit died out, because it was simply not enjoyable by most.  
---
Fighting against QOL changes is so damn stupid. As stupid as diving too deep into them and getting nowadays retail WoW. It's as fine there was a fine line between all these factors and BC &amp; WOTLK walked it well. Who would have thought there were nuances to life ?  
---
Go play some dark age shit if you want, I'm sure there must be some remnants of mouth breathers community that jerk off over how cool and hardcore and deep it is to loose hours of progress upon death or how it's so cool and immersive to spend hours on a boat between two zones.   
---
Whatever, I'm gonna stop replying here, we all have our opinions and this is one topic where no one will change his. Because this is so subjective and we cannot reason with facts.  
---
So yeah, think what you want old man, world keep spinning, host a Lineage server if that is what makes you hard, whatever.
---
Pass. 
---
Fade.
---
I'm good.  
---
Miss me.
---
Swerve.
---
F.
---
I actually hate layering I rather have more servers or have layering only for starting areas. Other than that people will layer hop and take advantage of looting, avoid pvp etc.
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers!
---
My first character was a NE Druid on a private server, since 14 year old me wasn't allowed to use my parents' credit card.
---
Once I got bought retail WoW at TBC launch, I played a BE Mage to 26, but then deleted her and went back to Tauren Druid. That character has been my main ever since.
---
Yeah, I remember when I was exploring Elwynn Forest with my orc shaman, Alliance brought me tea and crumpets instead.
---
I was going to play Warlock because I used to play one for most of my time in vanilla but obviously when we get down to 1 week left I start having second thoughts. So now I'm deciding between these:
---
Human/Dwarf Holy Paladin
---
Gnome Warlock
---
Gnome/Dwarf Rogue
---
Dwarf Hunter
---
I plan on doing a little bit of everything, from raiding to world PvP and battlegrounds.
---
Does the elf look like one? You can't defend your homeland from the people whose homeland it is.
---
I agree with your assumption.
---
The data shows an association between higher playtime and playing prot warr. I interpret this as:
---
There will be some very good, highly dedicated, tanks. But, a lot of people who say they want to tank but not "put the hours in" will roll prot and then fall by the wayside - resulting in the tank deficit we all detest so much!
---
&gt; Druid I’ll probably be healing.
---
Well, then. Be prepared to use Healing Touch Rank 4 for all eternity. Oh, and you can hibernate drakes. And give innervate to priests.
---
No worries, shammys are also only really there to give mana tide to the priests or windfury to the melees.
---
Isn’t going to happen on a Blizzard moderated product. I mean it’ll still be Barrens Chat but not to this level of cretinism.
---
Gott sei Dank
---
It's much more satisfying to heal in a raid than to DPS imo. When you DPS, you have a fixed rotation to do. When you heal, you have to react to whatever is happening all the time, and you will have a lot of "oh shit oh shit" moments because everyone is almost dying, but you and the other healers manage to get everyone to full health again. You actually have to actively look and click at certain frames instead of constantly spamming that rotation.
---
To be fair, I have pretty much been a healer in 90% of the raids I've done. So I am highly likely biased. 
---
PvP is a very different story. You are not able to just roam a BG alone, you need to find someone to stick to if you want to be a healer spec.
---
This sucks because now the community is being split. For example, I was planning to play with a group of 8 friends on Lucifron. Now half of us insist on migrating to Venoxis (I specifically remember 16+hrs login queues when classic first hit), the other half insists on sticking to lucifron as they have already applied for guilds there... fml
---
You missed a word there. The same word I assume will be banned on Blizz servers.
---
kek have a good day you sweet troll
---
How are they protecting us again?
---
You mean killing people in Syria, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan is protecting the west?
---
from the survey done on this sub last week we had one of the closest balances!
---
Shame
---
Let me decide for you too:
---
Not quite as lame as RFC.
---
Arugal had one of the closest balances from the survey done on this sub the other week :D
---
Play and have fun.
---
You never saw that mage that tanked Naxxramas by spellstealing the armor buffs from the enemies :D
---
did you just assume my faction
---
It's much more exciting in Classic since you have to actually cast spells, rather than everything being super fast and/or instant cast. Personally, I'm very fond of Resto Sham &gt; Resto Druid, but both are extremely viable and useful, literally personal preference in this case, CANNOT go wrong!
---
Aaah yes, a 30 second channel with no guarantee of a bite.
---
The down side to loot council from what I've experienced back in 2004-2005 was certain people getting favored. Not just the tanks who should be gearing first !
---
But really it would be the buddy of the gm or other loot council members over the guy who's not liked as much but is showing up to raids and popping those consumes .
---
thanks for the suggestion ill take a look

Y'all need unions.

GW2 players used to send cupcakes to the devs in the first few years of the game. Idk if they still do it but it would be a pretty cool sentiment.
---
They get paid for that though, on top of it being their choice to be there.
---
play game, tap the enter key, type out, LFG XYZ, real easy group finder

RDFD
---
Actually, now that you mention it...
---
TIL that "second place" does not mean "most anyone " despite the fact that being second does in fact mean you are ahead of most everyone.  Expect the person in first place.
---
The thing about daggers is you need to take lethality in assassination, imp backstab in combat, and opportunity, in subtlety.
---
this kind of eliminates the different builds you can do with daggers by quite a bit. that's why cookie cutter specs exist.
---
Ay ay ay ay. Oy yoy yooyy.

New/new

I leveled a Dwarf Warrior to 60 in proc spec in vanilla..... I was a complete Noob. There is no reason to level at Proc and although you will die slightly less often it will take 3 x longer to level an already hard class to level. Save yourself some sanity and level in Arms. Just my 2 cents.
---
Of course, if you don't care how long it takes to level then do whatever.
---
Is there any german guilds on Shazzrah?
---
!Remindme 3 days
---
Embrace the glory of the alliance, the majestic halls of ironforge and zones with some green in them.
---
which one of you animals stole my name on arugal! :P  
---
fingers crossed we get an even ish split and we can get some good fights
---
Sounds like you didnt raid in vanilla and therefore have adopted this attitude.
---
Hahahaha what the fuck. It’s painfully obvious you have no idea how movement works in wow or while multiboxing without follow. But keep talking out your ass lols.
---
I actually spent majority of my day yesterday watching this channel's videos. 
---
I don't know how I'm gonna make it through another whole week of waiting for launch.
---
That's bullshit. A bad hunter can backpedal and cast concussive shot on CD and still get most players to 50% because of their pet and autoshot. It's easily the highest skill floor in PvP and it's not particularly close.
---
It's the same reason I don't want to be in a Swedish guild. Why limit yourself when everyone on the server (almost) speaks English anyway. There are cool people all around the world.
---
No :)
---
now matter how many up votes you get, underrated comment.
---
Is Barrens the largest zone
---
oh sweet, i found a gun! what do you mean i cant use it? oh, because im a druid...
---
Go ask on /r/Arugal - there is a name trading thread
---
It’s just you
---
I apologize.
---
God fucking bless
---
Honestly, I'm not that worried about it if I can't.  I'd love to be able to experience the raids but I know I'll have a good time regardless.
---
This made me chuckle. I needed that this morning, thanks haha.
---
When you come to a place for gaming conversation but you get hit with hate for your country by a dude who by his use of the English language clearly demonstrates his countries reliance on the us military.
---
Good Thing i cept them ^^ have them by my Side AS Well on launch
---
Yeah, I think I thought it was bad to have more than one character or some shit, but I truely don't know
---
Piss off!
---
Me too friend, Me too.
---
You do realize the low, medium and high statuses are not the same as back in the days right? A full server back in the days had around 3k players, a full server right now could easily be 30k players over 10 layers. So your medium server could have five digits of players.
---
Where the horde guides at yo!?
---
Cope
---
It's been updated to 1.0 now. Thought I'd let you know. 
---

---
A lot of that money goes to the national security of LITERALLY every country represented by a negative comment in this thread.
---
There is a name trading thread on /r/Arugal - if you haven't seen it yet.
---
And yet still lower than rogues.
---
Usually is part of a rotation on some min/max hunters to feigh death / trinket and gear swap
---
Great stuff.
---
tl;dr
---
They were worried it wouldn't fill up. Obviously they were wrong but they are correcting that now so no biggy.
---
PvP servers: the enemy faction can and more than often will attack you on sight in any enemy or neutral zones. Sometimes you will get ganked by several characters. Sometimes it's just a single twerp. Sometimes a full on battle with dozens of characters breaks out. Some people have waaaaaay too much free time and gank you repeatedly, even if you are dozens of levels below them, and will camp you. It is a mixed bag that can either be very fun, especially if you like PvP modes in general, or ridiculously infuriating.
---
PvE: if you want to do PvP out in the world you have to enable PvP manually (drop down from your unit frame) and hope someone else on the opposite faction does the same. You won't be able to do anything if the opposite factions is farming the mobs you want, which is the only real drawback. I'd choose that if you don't want to have the possibility of being ganked or camped out in the world. 
---
You can always queue for instanced PVP when the battlegrounds release, which the majority will do anyway later down the line. There are people especially here who think that PvP servers are the only choice and that if one doesn't play there they aren't experiencing the "real" vanilla experience etc. They are dicks who just can't accept that some people don't play a PvE focused game for PvP or that some people only want to play "balanced" instanced PvP.
---
Still a better love story than Twilight
---
Your nation's national security is part of that bloat.  So there's that.
---
Well concider the like vs dislike ratio I'd say it still favors the success rate on my video aswell. And the fact that some people find my videos interesting and helpful is why I make them. Whiny ass bitches like you I usually just ignore, so I'm going to do that to you aswell now. Concider yourself ignored.
---
How great that you love the journey to 60. That doesn’t mean I have to. 
---
For me the game starts at 60. Raiding and wrecking horde in BGs is where its at tbh.
---
Originally, your mana would stop regenerating once you *started* casting a spell, where the 5 second rule would start ticking down. All the talent descriptions were written at that time, so they say "continue while casting".
---
Later on, the halting of mana regeneration was moved to the time where mana was actually expended (i.e. at the end of a standard cast), but all the descriptions remained the same. Thus, "continue while casting" is taken to mean "continue regenerating mana when you usually wouldn't".
---
A remaster isn't the same thing as an edit.
---
Take your upvote and get outta here. You gnome head.
---
I'll add the list from Ebbnflow. Some of theses may be the same, some may be different or give new ideas.

---
I agree with Petewinfield that Pala is the most able in pvp, though I want to add that I find Pala the most boring healer class. I've raided/PvP'ed as a healer on shaman, priest and pala (Also main support in LoL). Pala was definitely the strongest in PvP just because of the extra armor.
---
found the 20th century delivery boy..
---
aslo, thanks! :)
---
To gain validation for his own casual carebear way of playing the game
---
That depends on what your goals are and how you wan to have fun. Does your idea of fun involve being spec'd optimnally to do the most damage? If so, don't do this. Is your idea of fun stabbing things in the ass for sick crits? Then it's fine. I personally prefer to go deeper into assassination over deeper into subtlety (afaik this is a fairly typical way to do combat daggers). You can gouge&gt;backstab too, fwiw.
---
With leeway and the 400ms batching your experience should be similar to someone living in Germany...
---
it doesn't have to be a repeat of vertical progression, they could do horizontal progression I.E. a few new raids with gears generally on par with other raids (or only slightly better) mixed with new content like events and questlines that don't have anything to do with gear
---
fuck I hope not
---
Should have saved that sweet PTO
---
Please gather together and do it
---
Really depends on your playstyle. All the healers are generally viable, though they perform different roles. If you're looking for the strongest sheer healing output ignoring all other aspects, Paladins and Priests are your best bet.
---
I always just divided my level by 5 to know where I should fish. Same with all skills. Nice map though.
---
Your decisions matter again !
---
How can something that feels so good be wrong?
---
This is great! Thank you
---
Paladin is suuuper forgiving though, so just look up when you upgrade your offensive seal, SoW, hammer of justice and healing spells for the most important visits to the trainer. 
---
For talents I’d do this for purely pve: 
---
Imp might &gt; Deflection &gt; pursuit of justice &gt; conviction &gt; command + judgement cd &gt; 2h specialisation &gt; sanct aura &gt; 1 random talent point &gt; finish off the retribution tree. 
---
(For pvp I’d prio imp crusader, PoJ, command and judgement) 
---
At this point you should aim to get 3/3 precision in the prot tree, and/or consecration in the holy tree. Alternatively spec holy hybrid spec around lvl 50 where you grab the essential talents in holy (divine intellect, healing light, illumination, and imp BoW) and some offensive talents in holy and retribution. This way you can heal dungeons and you won’t be too terrible when solo. 
---
Hope it helps!

We are a group of experienced WoW players, who have experienced for the most part raiding at the highest level (mostly from TBC onwards) and some are IRL friends. We’re mainly looking for experienced players/players who want to clear all of the endgame content, bants are also a must (but you need to be serious from time to time). We aren't the type of guild that will only take the classes that will be dealing the top damage, because all specs were viable for the most part, the only exception is for tanks (only warriors).    
---
What we offer      
---
  • A social, family frie- insert we don’t do that meme here. Expect bants, expect some degree of toxicity, we also like our salt , we know where to draw the line. It’s just clean fun, it’s just bants maaaate, dont worry about it.    
---
  • Mainly a PvE guild, but we’re up for Bgs and world PvP/capital raids, etc.       
---
  • We can help with classes/builds, offer advice and such.       
---
  • A highly efficient loot council.    
---
What we expect       
---
   • Be over 18 (and somewhat mature)       
---
   • Be able to take criticism.       
---
   • Know your class and rotations (you don’t have to fully min-max, but we expect you to have consumables, enchants)       
---
   • Good written/spoken English.       
---
   • Good raid attendance (but we also acknowledge real-life problems, so there’s that)       
---
   • Announce if you can make it to events/raids/whatever.       
---
   • Try and contribute to the guild in whatever way you can.       
---
   • Specing and playing in a way which maximises the raid's the dps and not just yours (using curse if told on warlock, not using debuffs if asked to....)       
---
   • Dank memes.    
---

   • Currently we decided on Monday/Wednesday starting 8pm to 11pm server time (breaks included) but we’re open to discussion. We might add a 3rd raid day by phase 3.     
---
Apply by  contacting one of them:   
---
Sunderai#3299 (discord) or Sunderai#21123 (on btag) Azkaael#6081 (discord)

or by joining: [https://discord.gg/WJPxKtT](https://discord.gg/WJPxKtT)

Was this evil eye with zarya and fonz in it?
---
It's important to know what you're getting into for endgame. You're gonna be playing the same character for hundreds of hours you need to know if you'll enjoy it otherwise you will burn out quick.
---
but the chance of glancing blows to occur is still the same. And that is what matters to calculate caps, not the damage penalty.
---
I honestly believe only 50% of people who intend to play have actually subbed and created characters.  Everyone else is waiting until launch.
---
Without a doubt Arugal will be full, likely with another PvP server at Medium or higher pop.
---
I never knew Blizzard spoke Nazi
---
Just pick one and go it’s not hard
---
Well, I'm playing with a small group of friends (5-8 people). We plan to just make connections with guilds and fill slots for raids whenever they need a few extras and we're free, since none of us can really commit to a proper raiding schedule due to IRL commitments.
---
Flask lasts 2 hours. You wont be using one unless you in the most hardcore of hardcore.
---
There is very little overlap between bows that are stat sticks and bows that are good for hunters, I can only think of Blackcrow in phase 1 and nothing else.
---
It's more fun than looking at your CD timers all the time though :P
---
I'm aware, but that still makes them the worst race for the class.
---
Besides kids can make good healers when old enough to play.
---
Yeah this is legitimately nothing like the old barrens chat. Like, not at all. If you looking forward to this garbage then you should probably stay on private servers.
---
How about: fuck you and go back to ruin retail as much as you like.
---
This was hilarious hahahah
---
I wanna go Horde, at least in theory. But when compared to the aesthetics of Alliance they just lose so hard. 
---
So honestly I'm now stuck between Dwarf &amp; Human Warrior. Dwarf looks cool but I dont like their 1h animations which are used extensively in tanking &amp; fury pve. Humans have great proportions &amp; feel good but lack the comfy stoneform racial plus they are the most common race/class combo so might feel a bit common.
---
So in general. They don't scale great into the later raids. They seem to do good early but I've noticed they sit towards the middle of the pack in damage. As far as their utility and what they bring to a raid, they are always welcomed! And you can definitely tell a good hunter from a bad one. 
---
Best of luck!

Horde - Shazzrah
---
About us: We’re a guild of old and new friends alike, with a core team of players who have end-game raiding and PVP experience in every expansion since Vanilla. We have all decided to completely swap over to Classic and are incredibly excited to be able to reform our guild and re-experience the magic of the original game that got us all hooked. While we all love the raiding element of WoW, many of us have an equal passion for PVP which means we will certainly be organizing regular PVP events and raids.
---
Our Goal: Our primary goal is to be a serious progression raiding guild on Shazzrah while simultaneously building a large community of skilled, mature, and socially minded players as we believe a good community is at the heart of anyone’s potential enjoyment of Classic WoW. We have a dedicated team of officers in our guild who have all held leadership positions in various guilds with heaps of guild management and raid leading experience which will help us stay highly competitive while maintaining a semi-hardcore raiding schedule.
---
Raiding days and times: Wednesday/Thursday/Sunday – 19:00 to 23:00 UK time
---
Loot system: Loot council
---
Plan of action: Build a large community of players to make the levelling process as easy and enjoyable as possible. Once 60, most of our core members will aim to to start forming dungeon groups as soon as possible in order to gear up and get ready for raiding.
---
Our Expectations for core raiders: We expect you to be max level within the first two months of classic. Ideally you will be 60 in the first month to allow you ample time to gear up with the rest of our core members before raiding starts. The faster you hit 60 the easier it will be for all of us to effortlessly form dungeon groups and start farming! Additionally, we expect our core raiders to always carry consumables as well as enchanted gear.
---
Who are we looking for: We are a diverse and international group of players with various backgrounds who share a passion for all things WoW. We are looking for similarly minded Players who are happy to embrace Classic and everything it has to offer.
---
How to apply: If you are interested and would like apply to be a core raider then please submit an application using the following online form:

Classic WoW has infinite different potential journeys to offer and we hope our guild will be the perfect place to start yours. We look forward to your responses and getting to know you!
---
In the early days it was 5min, not 15min.
---
He was leading the Horde and keeping it together from that "little hut" that totally wasn't a stronghold or anything. The Horde was the most stable it has ever been under his leadership.
---
Holy shit, this is a perfect analogy. 😆
---
Not really. 
---
If your slowed the dr is a huge pain in the ass making scatter/trap way less useful
---
I just feel like you have to dump way too many talents to make ambush/backstab worth anything at all. Assigning those talents there deprives you of other very strong and useful talents. And (especially as far as leveling goes) the positional requirement can be crippling at times in addition to what you already acknowledged as being problematic, energy starvation. Ultimately it’s just not worth it to gimp yourself unless.... you just have more fun with this spec. Fun trumps all else.
---
To answer 2: 
---
**Progress is shared/everyone can loot**
---
* Kill quests (Kill 10 boars)
---
* Loot named mob's item (Kill Boarageddon and loot his arse)
---
**Progress is not shared/only one can loot**
---
* Generic loot quests (Loot 10 boar arses)
---
* Gathering (Collect 10 lunchboxes)
---
This is awesome. Lack of matchmaking is painful as hell for dungeons.
---
Why would you leave Moonfire so late into the rotation? Especially at 1-10?
---
Welcome back to 2004. Choose wisely.
---
Does this actually work? This seems like a bug
---
I hope Blizzard disallows this addon.
---
Shockadins are viable, you just need a few key items.. such as thunderfury.
---
I took 2 weeks off.  
---
Its my annualy summer leave, i dont need to tell the boss what im doing.. :D
---
Severely outdated
---
This just in: everyone is rolling undead!
---
to add to what u/Manbearelf said, one example of why @mouseover is so useful: You can have an ememy targeted to watch their casting to know when to interrupt, but still toss out heals to friendlies by hovering your mouse over their character or unit frame if in your party.
---
I have played wow from start to the end of BC and want to join again with classic, as i have played  hunter, shaman and a littel bit of warrior as my main classes back in the day, i want to shake it a bit up this time. But going Alliance is not an option!
---
I want to go on a pvp server (either lucifron, as i am german or golemagg/shazzarah), so first questions is any recomendations which server to go to? English/german? As i have no guild/group so far i can chosse freely. 
---
Right now thinging about undead mage as main with tailoring and skinning.   
---
Second is Tauren warrior with minning and armor smithing.  Want to go dungeon and raiding with the war as a tank.
---
As it takes quite some time to level i really want to concentrate on 2 classes, so any advice if that combo is good or are there some better ideas?
---
If i somehowe have time left i want to pick a orc/troll as well, not sure right now which class to choose and which professions, herbalism and alchemy would be good options for raids, warlock  sounds interessing but then i have another cloth class, so i was thinking rouge for fun in pvp \^\^
---
Also not at midnight.
---
And make sure to set video quality to 240p
---
if Blizzard really wanted accurate numbers they wouldn't have charged for a name reserve.  I didn't want them to think my 6 month sub is for BFA so i'm waiting till I hit the final 24 hour mark.
---
Not everyone walks around in half engineering gear at all times
---
Iirc there was /3 or /4 for the lfg chat channel or did they introduced that later?
---
Fellow players in Japan, what are your plans? Played on Tich for years but might go Faerlina for classic.
---
Its so unfair, I will log on at release and see some sweaty hipster sitting in a Starbucks in San Francisco running around at level 7 already. Please release the game at the same time everywhere Blizzard!
---
&gt; how many ppl held off subbing and making characters so they didn't waste 2 weeks of subscription time?
---
According to the big survey here it was like 52% of the player-base. But I think it might turn out to be even more than that as I'd say that people who visit this sub, on average seem more likely to have subscribed for stresstest and name-reservation.
---
All raids will want some hunters early on, for MC/BWL/ZG/etc. They bring good utility and stuff like tranq shot, and their dps is okay. Not top of line but also not bottom.
---
Their problem is that even with endgame gear, they fall off during later raids (aq40/naxx). So as pure dps, they are worse than almost all other pure dps classes.
---
That said, the difference is not so significant as to kick your hunters as soon as you transition to Naxx. Its more of a "if you're hunting for realm first kill, you wont bring hunters, otherwise you will be fine".
---
They are pretty decent in pvp iirc. But also fall off towards later end of gear.
---
\&gt; Oh my god class design is so fucking boring now. 
---
Yep. I've leveled every class to max and geared them to an average level since MoP, but now it's just not worth it. Never been unsubbed for this long, over 6 months now and counting.
---
Unbreakable was amazing!
---
I'm in California and played the stress test which was in australia. I was sitting just over 200ms ping and it was playable. not ideal, but not bad either.
---
Depends? Lol
---
Engineering is great for PvP. You won't regret having it.
---
Why would you deliberately pick a non german server and then look for german guilds
---
To me raiding was just as much fun as dungeons, but I must say back then I put a lot of time in to WoW, if you did not have this luxury I guess raiding was indeed either not obtainable or frustrating (because if you're not hardcoring it it basically gets harder).  
---
The thing is, where do you draw the line?  
---
Removing prep etc. is just what new wow is about, removing the 'annoying' parts. But then you lose the sense of accomplishment and it's shit.  
---
I guess the shit stuff is different for everyone too, I do not mind farming herbs for pots for instance, or travelling far to an instance.  
---
I do sincerely hate dailies though xD  
---
But I guess, because it being more personal too, dungeons are the most fun.
---
That's just the wurst.
---
Gay
---
That's my only concern honestly, and it doesn't feel like a good reason to have kids.
---
Blizzard finally realizing they are underestimatin everything....
---
Do stuff you want, and dont do stuff you dont want.
---
Its literally that. You dont enjoy pvp? Dont pvp. You dont want to do dungeons? Dont do dungeons. Find something you want to do - be it leveling, grinding, dungeons, etc - and do it, while you enjoy it. If you dont, swap to another game.
---
Same here, I'm excited to do all of those cool rogue quests I never did during vanilla and getting my fishing maxed ASAP.
---
The problem is that so many young americans turn to the military after an unsuccesful academic career with the hopes of redeeming themselves when they either get killed, severely wounded or contract PTSD in some country in the other side of the world.
---
Yeah, it's completely voluntary and not particularly "homeland defense" but these people are being cheated by their own governments. It sucks
---
Hey, at least the Alliance came here legally. Unlike the Horde, you illigal aliens.
---
my dumb ass started a new job just before classic released with mandatory training that i cant get out of
---
So what's the situation with addons? I remember blizz talking about curating them but from what I've heard all of them are working on beta?
---
I never said it as wrong
---
The only advantage to being in a guild with good specs only is way faster clear times.
---
&gt; zarya
---
none of those in the vanilla lineup what I can remember, I stopped playing when TBC came, resided on Bloodscalp EU
---
yep, took a week, *renovating house* lol.
---
King is a military rank, and the blizzard naming policy prohibits military ranks.
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
Good to hear that hunters to fall completely out of consideration for raiding groups late game, that was my biggest concern (to be left out because of class).
---
And yes.. there is a major difference from the commonly known "huntard" and an actual hunter haha. Ill do my best to achiev the latter one (;
---
If ur interested in pvp go for an orc hunter.. 25% chance to resist a stun is just op..
---
Yeah, but i kinda like the more ”analogue” method, feels more systematic to me - dunno if i can switch to mouse hovering after 10+ years as a healer 😅
---
I did walk from Orgrimmar to Ironforge before when I had a glitch in vanilla when I resurrected but still was dead.
---
damn this feels like yesterday and yet is so far away. that time when we all admired blizzard entertainment as the pioneers of the gaming industry.
---
That prosperous time before the dark age that came post-2008 Activision merger
---
Yes, it was worth it back in the day it’s worth that now.
---
Layering ruins this.
---
Oof. That’s rough. The only logical next step is to quit by ghosting them.
---
Did a very similar thing, Orc Hunter, pgh on Bladefist EU at launch. Levelled to like 19 over a few nights (yeh yeh!) and seen a Mage launching fire and frost all over the place and instantly deleted and rerolled. No idea why I deleted but I remember when they added the char recovery thingy on their website early on I recovered that bad boy.
---
pro tip 1:  
---
dont watch Asmongold  
---
Pro tip 2:  
---
instal an addon that block anything that has to do with Asmongold.  
---
Only after that you can finally play the game, without an have to worry about an entitled neckbeard guy
---
Im just a casual that doesn’t watch twitch or YouTube videos and will play every now and then so I’m subbing 2 days before launch, I’m sure there are plenty like me.
---
There will be queues but I don’t think servers will go down (maybe the login server). I do think they will release more servers in the next few days as more people subscribe. 
---
Blizzard are actually pretty good for launch days now.
---
What’s the purple key next to dun morogh?
---
Easily. The amount of content and hours you will put it is worth far more.
---
and not everyone is in guilds. the majority of people will go into classic looking for a guild.
---
Im sure they a exhausted all the way to the bank
---
German would be a cool language to learn, it looks so mean
---
Classic isn't early days though.
---
I'm stuck choosing between paladin or shaman. I only ever played paladin for the first few years of wow so not being able to make one will be a let down. But I love the idea of a classic orc shaman and I think that's what I want to play now. I can't choose.
---
Probably a PvE server.
---
What opinion? I didn't voice an opinion.  I just stated that if there are 100k active people playing, they're probably losing money from the cost to maintain.
---
Yes! worth the $15 every month, and even if you dont like it after the first month, you can just drop it. if you spend more than 4-5 hours a month, then its really not that expensive for enjoyment.
---
Classic wow puts you into a setting where you have to meet friends and guildies ! $15 bucks isnt much to step outside your comfort zone and test it out.  The real game is at 60 once you can join raids with people and experience the game to its fullest . Also lots of guilds are recruiting and people looking for friends to play with!
---
Qld horde represent!
---
Check the combat log thought...
---
so if let's say they retain 50k active players on 1 realm, they can keep phase 1 until they get bored and start quitting :P
---
all jokes aside, i think we will re-experience the launch day on phase 2.
---
Pay the $15, if you don't like it, cancel it, don't play it.
---
Don't celebrate this you morons, Crunch is abuse that's somehow tolerated in the game industry.
---
Lol, we uninvite people from the lan-party, if they play alliance.
---
Frost had better damage mitigation, but blood had better survivability because of their self healing. People forget although all 3 were designed to do both, frost was initially built to be THE tanking spec. Just look at the presences back then.
---
Its beta it might have been a higher drop percentage.
---
Who cares ... i spend hours looking for a map
---
I didnt even used reddit when i made it
---
Don't let the thought of playing alone dissuade you. There will be plenty of people for you to journey with.
---
I'm rolling whitemane so I hope so.
---
Came to this solely to read the comments and gather the salt for my dinner tonight tbh.
---
Real PVP isnt coming for a few months, so focus on PvE atm, build that gold, get set, and then choose what you want.

---
Just like picture says it is. In UK it releases monday 11pm
---
Bad decision imho. It splits the community
---
I think you should go mining and skinning. 
---
Leveling crafting professions reduces the gold you have available until after reaching max level. 
---
Leveling Gathering professions on the other hand increases the gold you have available all the way to max level and beyond. 
---
Most guides will also recommend doing two gathering professions leveling up to make obtaining money easier. Leveling a crafting professions during leveling can really slow you down. 
---
If you are REALLY pro with it you can save the materials you gather needed to level to 300 by sending them to an alt until you hit max level. Meanwhile you can sell all extra materials you get from gathering to make money. Win Win. There are guides that tell you EXACTLY how many materials you need to hit level 300 most efficiently/cheaply in all crafting professions.
---
A lot of us started in vanilla, why wouldn't it be worth it to start in vanilla? Of course it is.
---
Al'akir is doing his best to protect his son from being killed multiple times.
---
I am on deployment and won't get to play until November. I'm just looking towards the upside of the servers being established by the time I will be able to play.
---
Protip: once you find the class you enjoy, it won't matter if something else is potentially "better". More than likely, if you get to level 30 or higher you'll probably stick to that character for your main because leveling takes a while.
---
Dope thanks for the detailed response. I'll dissect this and do some research and come back with any new questions. thanks again.
---
I would be so down to play it but I don't think it will happen. I read a few years ago that someone from Blizzard stated they started developing WotLK as Vanilla was live. Means they had about three years time if not more. Classic starts now and yet there is no big team behind it but a small bunch of developers who dig old data and apply it to the new client. With this approach the only next thing we can expect is "recycled" TBC with minimum changes. Which is also not bad but not a new content.
---
You can have cooking, and first aid and still have two core professions (i.e. engineering)
---
By not playing that much.
---
I play vanilla wow since 2013  (and before in 2005-2006)  I still  like it. 
---
I don't play every night.  , not every day.   I often play only 1 hour.
---
I take long breaks.  3 months.  6 months.  my longest break was a year.
---
Sometimes I increase my pace a play more for a few months.   Like when I want to get a bit more serious in raiding and get some epic gear with a character.  But afterwards it goes down again.
---
Yea, of course it must be level 11 vs level 4 lol!
---
played since vanilla and quit after being among the first in my server to kill the LK. It was good closure and ever since i came back to try out every expansion. Non of them really grabbed me and i kept disagreeing with a lot of the decisions the dev team was making so after a few months i would unsub.
---
I lol’d IRL.
---
You should try 1 or 2 months, you should decide that.
---
Please add hungarian servers, don't create another retail ragnaros where english speakers are bullied away
---
Nope, not worth it. We all think classic is shit in this sub.

**&lt;Cyrus&gt; | Alliance | EU PvP**  
---
[https://www.cyrus-gaming.com/](https://www.cyrus-gaming.com/) 
---
**Introduction**  
---
Cyrus was founded over ten years ago back in early 2009, and has enjoyed success in MMO's such as Warhammer Online, Aion, Rift and World of Warcraft. Originally a PvP guild, over the years we learned to appreciate the joys and drama of raiding - and some of us have even learned to stop standing in the lava. You can read more about our history at the link below:
---
[https://www.cyrus-gaming.com/history/](https://www.cyrus-gaming.com/history/)
---
Following something of a general lull in the MMO scene over recent years, we are now beyond hyped to be turning the clocks back and recapturing our wasted youths in World of Warcraft Classic. It's not often you get a second go at things in life, so while we might not still fit into the same pair of skinny jeans we did 15 years ago, we are certainly going to take this opportunity by the horns and throw ourselves into some classic old-school guild life!
---
**Raid Schedule (UK Times)**  
---
Monday - PvP Night  
---
Sunday – 7.20pm to 11pm  
---
Wednesday - 7.20pm to 11pm  
---
Thursday – Dependant on progress
---
We will also organise Battlegrounds and World PvP nights.
---
**Member Expectations**  
---
Cyrus is a focused, progression-based guild for mature, skilled and team-orientated players. We have a long-established leadership committed to getting the most out of our members and ensuring everyone is working towards their own and the common goals of the guild.
---
Our raid schedule reflects that of a more grown up / responsible lifestyle, but we still expect members to be highly active, to participate in other guild activities and to ensure they are fully stocked and ready for when it's go time. You’ll need a thick skin, a good sense of humour, the discipline to know when to speak up, when to shut up and the dedication to constantly improve.

---
It literally says 11pm in the picture you posted. What the fuck is there to get confused about?
---
The same thing happened on my original PVP server. It completely ruined world PVP.
---
5. People who have no preconceptions about vanilla but will join because their friends started to play.
---
This is what led to the immense growth of vanilla/TBC in the first place, because those versions of the game enforced community interactions and made "playing with friends" fun.
---
I rerolled druid at around 1.8 or whenever druids where changed to have more Armor in Dire Bear and Innervate become a baseline-skill.
---
So I can't say for sure. I see no good reason as for why that would have changed though.
---
I recognize MS Paint curved lines anywhere.
---
I played just about every spec I wanted to on private servers. I'm looking to make an impact on the server, come Classic launch, and the best way to do that is with a class I'm not only completely familiar with, but have mastered inside and out.
---
Get tae fuck
---
Couldn't agree more
---
Have a schedule and real life stuff to do. I know it might sound counter-productive when you want to be ingame farming mats/honor/dominating world bosses  however I have experienced burnout due to the fact that I would do nothing but play. Have outside interests and stuff to do in the real world (learn/socialise/earn money/gym.) 
---
The true takeaway from what im saying is that a timetable or designated time you play the game should be available. Have stuff to do in the day that isn't wow (go for walk/cook/dishes/clean room)
---
This is how I personally intend on avoiding burnout. Hope it helped and that it wasn't all obvious garbage haha
---
I mean it's something awful, goon squad, gave me Eve Online PTSD
---
Just pray that we kick retail's arse so hard that they can development of that steaming dogpile.
---
I’ve been maining rogues on burning crusade private servers based in Europe for 3.5 years or so now. I live in Alaska and never got any latency below 200 ms and I hated it. It is very difficult to get interrupts on casters if they try to fake cast at all which is game breaking at high end pvp if your opponents have 100 or less ms. I also felt very susceptible to being kited. Lately I’ve been playing resto shaman because it’s less latency dependent. 
---
200ms is doable as melee, but quite frequently you’ll be noticing some tough breaks that wouldn’t have gone that way if you had half that latency.
---
Still no rp realms -.-
---
...based on name reserving
---
Why do so many ppl hate him? I find him entertaining
---

---
Worse only matters if the encounter was hard enough to justify needing the best.  Hard encounters in Vanilla?  lol no.  Giving the loot to the warrior just because they can pump out bigger numbers is as win-more as it gets.
---
If you use that argument, it applies to any server.
---
 Not saying you are wrong but there have been a lot of post last couple of months about the math behind imp drain soul. Some has drawn the conclusion that it's better to just rely on the 5 second rule with your wand until much later levels were imp drain soul is going to have a bigger impact. 
---
 I always rushed it playing on private but this time I'm planing to skip it until mid level 30:s. I will use the freed up 2 points in Suppression instead, 5/5 instead of 3/5. Planing to do some higher level quests early so will be useful.
---
What I'm wondering is what they'll do if the population doesn't go down enough on the big realms. Roll with 10k realms?
---
Give it time.
---
The auction house is a minor gold sink tho.
---
You haven’t played vanilla since actual vanilla I’m assuming?
---
What
---
Not invited to the party? Yep, sounds about right!
---
Awesome, thanks for clarifying
---

Illidan being Julian Assange, getting in prison for 10000 years, up to the point where we actually will need him to survive America?
---
When he says later raids he means 2 years into the future when they release naxx so don't worry and play what you like
---
I probanly won't implement something like that. This addon shall facilitate the display of items for sale and not automate the transaction. I also want people to talk to each other and not instantly open a trade window without having even talked to each other.

After finding out rogue diaries are only 3s instead of 45s I am not so sure.

Hi, I am looking for an addon that keeps track of missing buffs (i play a healer) BUT also allows you to recast all the missing buffs with a keybound hotkey. I saw Buffwatch, but couldn't test it during the stress test, so not sure if that will work for my needs.

Looking for a fairly casual WPvP Guild on EU-Gehennas Horde side :) I liked [A Bunch of Gankers](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/h-a-bunch-of-gankers-wpvp-recruitment-closed/60327) description and activities a lot, but they're on the RP PvP server. Played a ton during Vanilla (r12), including US and EU Beta. Played till WotLK regularly and since then on and off for each new expansion. Want to play casually (but longer term) during classic :)
---
what lol
---
Druid BS? really?
---
Yep, but between cooking, fishing, first aid, mining and engineering I'm afraid ill spend more time on proffessions than on actually playing the game.
---
Or Everlook
---
I agree, I have been to Germany a few times and it’s an amazing place.
---
Chances are that I’ll be learning Swedish not German since a Swedish guild has adopted this Englishman.
---
There are only 2 of us who wanted to play classic in my Discord and the other guy was already in the guild for retail. He got them to send me an invite so I had some friends so play with.
---
This actually describes every class in the game. Lmao never thought about it like this

Shadow Priests are beasts in PvP, not sure what you're talking about.

[H / A] Hunter or Lock player looking for semi-hardcore raiding guild. Needing raid times 2 days a week starting at the earliest of 6:30 PM PST. I have experience raiding in Vanilla (up to first 2 bosses in AQ40) from back in the day and through every xpac except the most recent ones. I have a server in mind but my heart is not set so if I find a guild for me then I have no problem starting my Classic life on theirs.
---
I intend to push one character to 60. Then level some alt characters.
---
I also am not joining a guild until my first character is 60. I don't want any pressure to get there any faster than I want to, or feel any pressure to do anything other than enjoy the game for myself until then.
---
they say its 3h but u also got like 1h early prep to be ready
---
u cant just raid log at the last minute
---
You need a pretty decent management ranking with most likely 150k$+++/year for such working 60+hours/week being legal where I live (switzerland). And even then, it's very hard to justify.
---
Of course you can do it any day illegaly. And of course if you work independant for your own pockets.
---
I'd rather have server merges than layering, but both are better than sharding.
---
!remindme 1 week

And like it's a single player with just a lot of bots running around.

**Language:** Strayan or Kiwi

Torment is a reimaging of a Neverwinter Nights guild and consists of a core of veteran WoW players as well as newer players to the game. Above all else we value maturity and a good attitude, but we also like a bit of friendly banter and except saucy language when appropriate! We are not looking to be week 1 MC raiders, but are looking to clear all raiding content and to hold our own in world PvP.
---
If you are an older more experienced player with a great attitude, we have room for you. If you are a newer player without the skills, but with a great attitude and a willingness to learn, we also have room for you. If you are an elitist tool, keep scrolling.

You're getting down votes but I'll fall on that sword with you.

In my eyes, we call ourselves a "community" and I think we can directly relate to the real world example of that. If we all lived in a subdivision amongst each other, would you not report a theif or vandal destroying your neighborhood? It's not your problem at the moment, but of course you would!
---
You pay $15 so you shouldn't bat an eye and lend a hand? You pay a hell of a lot more in taxes but I bet you call up the fire department real fucking quick when your shit is going up in flames instead of letting them see the smoke and come over when they notice.

Started with gnome. Then watched LOTR and switched to Dwarf. Thinking about human but I think the Dwarf Warrior Master Blacksmith role is what I want as my final choice.

Ah well if you enjoy him, that cool,  
---
everybody likes different stuff.  
---
I personally hate the guy.  
---
Yeah the tournament duel he (?) organised was fun.  
---
But on streams ive seen him ranting on forums and players, and then rants about the age of somebody's forum name or creation date.... like realy dude....  and there are a lot of these things i really hate about him....  
---
But hey Twitch average viewer is between 8 an 15 it seems, if they enjoy watching that, sure... go ahead, but im not watching that bull crap... if i want bull crap or some serious funny ranting i'll go watch the Doc

I remember watching the NE Mohawk adds in game in Project Entropia. Blizz use to have some fire media strategies.

Barrens chat was always toxic in his way.
---
You realize that it was likely staged right? The guy easily has enough money to pay a bunch of people to try to reserve his name for him and then he can just act crazy on stream like he didn't get it.
---
Nah they can whilst levelling if there's no alternative. Earth shock &amp; rockbiter. [Have fun!](https://forum.elysium-project.org/topic/37254-totemtank%E2%80%99s-510-man-shaman-tanking-guide/)
---
You could just stay there as an alliance warlock and charge groups to summon their members.  Looks like the OP lacks imagination and business acumen.
---
Tbh this is a really personal question. From personal experiance the following is really important to prevent burn out: 
---
Have Social connection within the game... making Friends goes a long way and is very fun and provides a couple important functional roles as well.
---
Have Expectations and be expected.... Have a surtain set of goals you want to achieve and take responsibility for what is expected of you in order to achieve these.
---
Take breaks... But make them conform to rule 2. Its good to take breaks and get your mind on other things. Make sure your space is nice and tidy, you ate healthy and your personal life is not suffering because you are playing.
---
I was wondering the same thing. Is the latency for US west going to be better than Oceanic? Let me know if you end up finding some kind of community of players in Japan.
---
/u/imnostalgic
---
Pro tip : do not install a dps meter addon, if you don't want to top meters. If you want, roll warrior.
---
Ret pally can do dps, they just need twice as many raid supplies as warriors and are also really gear dependant to be useful whatsoever. I'm more interested in shockadin.
---
Tbh I hate how many ways there are to gear ...... dunno why but I hate it
---
Yeah I just canceled my Hulu subscription to pay for Classic.

Not behd... Good size... 6 days in...
---
Do they not realise that there were pve servers in vanilla and a lots of people played on them. 
---
For those people pve is the real vanilla experience.
---
Hell NO !!
---
It will put all same category to items to the assigned slots. And you can change different items to different category's if you think that example "consumable" covers too many items. Or manually make your own category and then add items to that. Meaning ~all items have preassigned category's, but you can manually make it more precise, if you like.
---
There is additionally a "new item" category (if you like) that will show them in separate part of the bag. After that it will put them to the their own categorys.
---
I did some testing on the addon while the last closed beta and most of the features are working fine.
---
Classes taken to raids not cos dps, but utility and buffs they provide. So hunters always have 2-3 spots in the raids.
---
If you want to top overall dps meters hunters isnt the class for that. though in classic competition of performace usually goes within the classes, so being the best hunter in the raid/guild/server is still very respectable and something to strife for. Pretty much the same goes for all other classes. 
---
Cos dpses arent normalized, and everyone recognise that different classes do differently by design. So noone expects, and noone would look down at you if you'd be in the bottom half of the dps table overall in the raid. And you shouldn't feel bad about it either.
---
The only oceanic pvp realm is high with a week to go...it will be full
---
I really only ever watch vids on youtube and everytime I happen to see his stream all I see him doing is raiding
---
You level as an AoE/Frost build.
---
If you're leveling as fire or arcane you're gimping yourself.
---
This has nothing to do with streamers and everything to do with how powerful the specs are.
---
Even better.
---
I was smiling all the way through, until it got to Verne Troyer. Then I was sad. RIP Verne.
---
How would you react if some murderous green monster showed up in your backyard where your children play?
---
I expect long queues. Nothing to do about it than wait. If the starting zones ends up being packed to the max even with layering I might just setup some time consuming addons rather than play. Some addons you can really spend a lot of time experimenting with. So might just fiddle around with that until the starting zones are less crowded.
---
"sup b" trash talk is as old as humanity :D
---
thats the real problem for me
---
whatever they did I just dont see people around
---
Yes please. And uh, maybe Troll druids.
---
Why would you emigrate to another country and still hang with a group of expats?
---
Because it's fun meeting new people but it's also nice to have a familiar group to fall back on.
---
Yeah nelf hunters are *totally* deranged for not wanting to play a fugly dwarf (even though they have a top tier pvp racial, I wouldn't roll one). Horde rogues on the other hand have 3 races to choose from, and they're all badass and have cool animations imo. 
---
Needless to say yes, I'm rolling a nelf hunter and not ashamed too.
---
I literally mention fear right after. And yes, it's still not as much use as affliction lock would get out of it.
---
Thank you. Glad somebody else has the decency to accept responsibility.

Skinning and mining until you've got some cash behind you, then change skinning to engi for the PVP stuff and to make your own ammo. Leatherworking is pretty useless, no BOP items. You only need 1 leatherworker per guild.

I get up at 6 for work so even if I have a week off I'm gonna try not to throw my sleep schedule off too much. Don't know if I'll succeed. I do want yo be there for launch though

Converted to 16:9 for those who want to use it on second monitor
---
This concept is curious to me. You could choose to play druid/paladin for example only because you like the class and its fantasy as a whole, and also because you like dpsing and tanking with it. But you also couldn't care less about healing. If a "class that can heal" does not want to heal as a main role, how is it different to rolling a pure dps class from the get go?
---
If youhave a roster that is short of healer, and you have druids/pala/shaman dps/tank, it just doesn't make sense to make to react such as "but, BUT, these guys there. They are a class that can heal ! Let's just tell them to roll heal then !". Of course it would totally make sense in a hardcore / speedrunning guild, but that's it.
---
I myself absolutely don't have that mindset, and I intend to replace as a healer when someone is ill / absent, but your reasoning can't justify that nonsense towards hybrid classes and "difficulty" to find raids spots.
---
Undead warlock, yes I'm going to play an undead warlock.
---
So I saw this and thought
---
&gt;lol who’s going to watch this? I’m not that crazy about wow
---
Clicked it for a peak and found out I’ve already watched the whole thing *sigh* I guess I’m watching it again
---
If in doubt, go horde.
---
It's crazy to see a native speaker spelling "should have" as "should of"
---
Spend 2 hours picking a face, then look at the back of your character's head for 50 days /played.
---
Yeah but they're only trolls.
---
Cheers! I was thinking about lvling another toon up before the late game anyway so I feel pretty secure in my hunter pick after these comments. Thanks! :)
---
Our tornado season is also getting longer and more active with all the climate change going on. Joana only lives about two hours east of me. 
---
We have hit the point of numbness with tornadoes that unless you can see it out the window and your power is out... eh, fuck it. I can finish this dungeon.
---
Thanks for your help dude. I'll have to check it out on launch
---
I mean it all depends on your income and how much time you wanna play it? 
---
Asking on a games Reddit if it's worth it or not is like asking an echo chamber.
---
You mean like... long ears, lanky, tree huggers and known to be extreme xenophobs?
---
AHAHAHAH said but true!
---
Im all good with focusing more on mechanics, hunter tooltip and kiting rather than topping the dps meters (;   
---
So ill be fine there haha :D
---
Not to be «that guy», but the timer isn’t actually adjusted for timezones as the release is at the same moment everywhere
---
Nah there’s no such thing as a community of players here nor have I looked for one. Most people just try to play with people from their homes. Oceanic servers suck and will always suck, for the ping and the low skill level players. West coast ping is sub 100 and top players. I’ve hit glad every xpac with no ping issues. At this point it’s just finding the right time zone and population fit. Faerlina queue will probably suck.
---
That's for name reservation dude
---
The point is that you get frostbolt at level 4.

Well... vanilla was never about the endgame. It was a long, wild road to 60... it took weeks, months, even if you just binge-rushed from quest to quest. Vanilla was about the world itself. I remember questing in the same area for days till I got to the next one. Back then for me raids were the stuff that was at the end of that long, epic road.. while you never we're done exploring the world even at 60. What today most ppl call "endgame" was just the nice topping on the wholesome cake that made WoW exciting from 1-60. I know I'll like the slow progress, enjoing the zones more again because you can't really rush them. You skip, you lose. 
---
Vanilla is a journey, not a race
---
Legion sounds like Nazis.
---
You can be faster, but on average yeah. It will vary on faction, class, your friends you have or meet along the way, and a bit of luck. A warrior by himself will take longer than a hunter in the same situation. If the person is having a bad day on a PvP server all the time, it will be quite a lot longer.
---
People's first characters could be significantly longer than 10 days, there was different reasons to play than to just get to 60 as quickly as possible.
---
I think there are some honest answers from players here: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8ng37t/how_long_did_160_take_you/
---
That's for name reservation
---
300 - 500 what? $ £ €?
---
Personally, I wouldn't get that laptop from craigslist you linked. The CPU and GPU benchmarks are pretty low. It could play wow but I think you will get frustrated with it after a year as I won't be able to do much else.
---
So don't worry go the Hunter it's very fun and engaging.
---
Elves are just evolved trolls though.
---
Billy mays?
---
The problem is holy is ass when you're out soloing in the world.  Nobody wants to spend 100's of gold (50g x2, multiple times a week) in order to raid as Holy and Ret for everything else.  Well I mean a lot of people *would* want to do that but no way to afford that.  So you either play Holy 24/7 or you spend an absurd amount of gold each week to play multiple specs.  
---
And c'mon most dps specs are kinda ass in raids in Vanilla.  Combat rogue spamming SS SS SS SS SS Evisc.  Mage spamming frostbolt &gt; frostbolt &gt; frostbolt &gt; frostbolt &gt; x500.  Very few dps specs were actually *fun* when raiding.  Most were a bit of a chore which is why you had people going afk mid fights by a few weeks into MC.
---
A lot of people played pve during vanilla so pve is what they consider to be the true vanilla experience.
---
I have the Judgment way of spelling xD and looking for names on Herod
---
Thanks for the indepth comments!  
---
Im considering the lock or priest as an alt and have this alt ready for end game aswell, so I feel alright now! :
---
Cheers man, and hf in classic :D
---
Lul exactly.
---
Will think about playing on the Cali server then! What's the name of it?

Which font is this?

Tbh, as a Dane, German is one of the most beautiful, intricate languages around. It really shines when reading continental philosophy and the difficulty of translation to English shows it.

Waste? Sulfuras is only worth it on Paladins and Shamans.

You've figured out the essence of playing in a real MMORPG, I can see. Gratz /s
---
Don't forget some redditor mastermind on this sub who thought the same. 
---
I was told that there was never more than 2 german servers with 1k players on it in all the history of WoW and german hated difficult games and it wasn't worth opening one.
---
THAT'S RACIST!!!!
---
What are you talking about? That's RELEASE, which is says in giant capital letters, not to mention the 26th of August hasn't actually happened yet

Will do! Thanks for the replies :)

It is adjusted by timezone in the sense that it's a countdown to release in your timezone, not US/EU/CHN/whatever.

&gt; Warlocks underplayed?
---
Now I know we're an echo chamber and a small part of the whole Classic WoW community but according to the census warlocks are one of the highest picked classes after Rogue and Warrior I think.
---
Lmaoooo
---
Guess i'll be cleaning my hooves alot then.
---
Included with a subscription, no base game or expansion required.
---
90% of people tho?
---
&gt;Plus, everyone is already in guilds and shit,
---
Guilds are always forming. Some guilds are for casuals, some are for leveling (kind of the same thing), some are for hardcore PVP and/or raiding, some are just a small group of friends who like having a chat box where they can all talk to each other.
---
You'll find a guild if you want, trust me. People sometimes just invite random people to up their numbers. Chances are, you'll be doing a dungeon or a quest with some people in a guild and (if you're nice) they'll ask if you want to be in their guild.
---
For a new payer, I would suggest a RP realm. RP stands for "role playing". The idea is that people act/speak like their characters would...but very few really do that outside of designated RP communities. The only big difference between an RP realm and a "normal" realm is the character naming policy - you can't name your character "Lovestosplooge" or "Thrallsballs" ect. The main benefit these servers have is that the people are really nice and a little more casual/laid back. 
---
As far as the economic concerns go...I'm pretty sure WoW has SAVED me money. I don't go out as much, I don't buy nearly as many games or other forms of entertainment, and I almost never order out because you can't go to the door in the middle of a raid when the pizza guy shows up

| EU - any PVP server | Dedicated and experienced paladin with a lot of free time looking for a leveling partner or a dungeon spamming group for launch, planning to go hard at launch but not 40 hours hard, can fill any roles. Message me here on Discord if you are interested.
---
It's the appropriate response.
---
I'll be playing a Warlock. Know what I'm going to be doing when it comes to finding groups? Taking the initiative to start the group myself and get to the instance ahead of time so I can use my ability to summon as a selling point. 
---
DPS, good or not, are not really in demand for 5 man content, specifically while leveling. Starting the group yourself and taking on the boring networking task seems like a compromise to be "in demand".
---
So, yeah, start your own guild and guarantee yourself a raid spot. Be a solid leader, set up your site and discord, and take care of all the bullshit nobody wants to do and I promise nobody will care less where you are on the meters when Ragnaros dies.
---

So you agree that regardless to whatever site you go it IS ADJUSTED to your timezone ??  
---
Am I taking crazy pills or is your reading comprehension seriously that bad ? What do you mean it's redundant ? If it wasn't adjusted you'd see a countdown for 26th 11AM your time on the US site, when that's not the case for you. The fact that it IS adjusted means that you see a countdown for 27th 1AM your time even on the US site.
---
Sounds like an excuse to validate killing a lvl 4
---
I think mc is going on farm pretty quick this time around
---
It was perfectly readable for me with google translate (built into chrome)
---
&gt; Plus, everyone is already in guilds and shit, and I won't really have anyone to experience the game for the first time with me... 
---
Wrong. Lots of players like myself who rather go into it guildless and find a guild while playing. Joining a guild beforehand I dislike because I want to know some people in the guild before I join. So I will just play and build up a friend list via questing and doing dungeons. Then join one of my friends guild( after asking some questions about the guild so I can see it seems a good choice).
---
Ok so after doing some research it seems my best bet will be to gear from the resource I linked in phase 1. Molten Core will seemingly neither help me for my PvE nor my PvP gear needs. Tier 0.5 doesn't come out until phase 5 so that's a no go. When they release phase 2 and the pvp sets become available, the blue PvP set seems to be the all around best choice until phase 3.
---
So I think I have my roadmap now. Hit 60 grind standard pre-raid BiS and spelladin BiS gear. Raid for clout and additional healing power for phase 3. Phase 2 hits - grind PvP to rank 10 and get blue set. 
---
Go hard on raiding once BWL drops.
---
You are in for a surprise.
---
I used to have a girlfriend that would be mad if i played games on my laptop or phone but she would watch tv all night herself.
---
I am gonna roll a Dwarf Paladin and then venture from Ironforge to teldrasill and start doing all the quest of the nightelfs so I will be Exalted before 60 and I can get me one of those shiny NE Mounts before I can start grinding for my Pally charger in Phase 2.
---
As you can see I am not planning on hitting lvl 60 the fastest hehe.
---
It is, go to the wow classic page.  https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/wowclassic
---
Its also at the top of a Google search.
---
https://www.google.com/search?q=wow+classic
---
And I know it's been asked in the reddit multiple times over the past 2 weeks
---
Because wrath is more efficient. You are note gaining enough dps to compensate the burst of wrath with moonfire in the same amount of time.
---
About half of the add-ons they list don't work. I wish they'd test then and clean up their list because otherwise the site looks great.
---
A lot of people are going to sub to WoW only because of Classic.
---
All the people I know online from back then don't play retail for several years anymore. But most of them will at least give classic a shot. That's a lot of cash coming in for activision for essentially just paying 10 developers + a couple servers. It's going to be a cash cow, although not an obvious one.
---
Yeah should do, just seems annoying to do :P
---
I don't believe they were downsized in terms of developers but rather communication staff and such.
---
hahahaha true.
---
Even through raids, port warriors were incredibly rare in vanilla.
---
Reminds me of D2 necro tbh
---
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:
---
- [/r/classicwowplus] [I designed 72 additional raid drops for underused specs. What do you think?](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwowplus/comments/csfhzz/i_designed_72_additional_raid_drops_for_underused/)

---
If you resigned before Blizz announced the release date, how long was your notice period?!
---
PLease give us green font for zones, red for horde cities and blue for alliance cities. It would also make much mor sense with colours of transport lines... Thank you very much
---
I couldn't agree more, people are going to ruin their own joy with playing Classic by rushing into things trying to be hardcore which is the stupidest thing you could possibly do. I've reached all pinnacles during my time in WoW, top 50 worldwide bosses killed, multiple arena rank 1 and Gladiator titles and it doesn't matter, they don't in the end, if you're not having fun while doing it,  the joy from WoW classic stems from your individualism and sense of freedom, how you dictate your own destiny while exploring, learning, having fun, taking your time and just doing stupid things with your friends, if you're not doing that, you'll get bored and quit the game.
---
Aside from AUS/NZ, who else is playing on oce server?
---
You're right it's an over simplification. But, practically, you did have to finish the expansion in essence. For non druids, the gold sum was still very hefty for both flight and the epic flying. Enough to where completing the expansions storyline up to 70 was the best way to get there. 
---
So yea, it wasn't a reward necessarily. You're right. But it also kind of was, in a roundabout way.
---
So if I decide to pick up a career as a toilet cleaner in northern Sweden (hell a long way up there, we're a long country) where my salary is 1500 dollar a month, I should be sent care packages because of my choice of work?
---
Credz to all soldiers that actually do good work, but US army isn't one of them.
---
Dude fuck off
---
Yes, dude, I'm not arguing against that... Are you even reading the post ?  
---
Of course you see the same countdown because it is adjusted to the timezone you access the website from.  
---
What is happening in this thread ?
---
My point is it doesn’t matter if it’s adjusted for timezones or not, because the exact MOMENT of release is the same around the globe. So even if I see a countdown adjusted for US timezones it’s still the exact same amount of hours away as the EU release
---
Nice work. 😊
---
Yes I know, I'm just pointing it out in case people thought pets would become invisible too. They don't, so you have to dismiss. But if you plan on using the potion as you're being chased on a PvP server for example, you might not have time to dismiss your pet as it's a 5 sec cast. And you can't use the potion whilst in combat.
---
I just love how friendly, helpful, and creative people are now in our shared nostalgia before the launch. Thank you for making the community a better place!
---
I played Gnome Warlock in Vanilla and enjoyed it.
---
I'm tempted to re-live that and roll it again. I enjoyed the Warlock quest lines and the free mounts were good. I also enjoyed Gnomes - they were fun and made me laugh.
---
I'm also tempted to roll Dwarf Priest. Have always preferred casters to melee. That said, Druid is also quite appealing as I like the flexibility of it though haven't played one before. Though perhaps I'd roll that on Horde. Decisions decisions.
---
Because I am casting moonfire at the end of my staff attack to not reduce the time between my melee attack (more dps)
---
I think the big difference between vanilla and Classic is that there are now so many wives involved.
---
it really is.  
---
Not sure if you fully use the search engine its capability, but its find able with 2 key words within 5 seconds.
---
Nope, had it picked for a while now.
---
Wasn't wow radio total biscuit's brainchild?  At least credit him in some way
---
We raided that place in Legion.
---
too soon.
---
&gt; Because I am casting moonfire at the end of my staff attack to not reduce the time between my melee attack (more dps)
---
&gt;There are going to be many guilds out there that will take any dps to fill the 40 spots.
---
shitty guilds
---
Also with a helmet on past level 40ish lol
---
You’re missing the 26 RPers giving each other oral behind the inn and in the grass
---
Short answer: yes
---
Long answer: yes
---
Unless you are MT of a guild or ONLY tank dungeons at 60 there is no reason to be protection.
---
Imagine Blizzard stealthily dropping in a BiS gun. The #nochange crowd would have a heart attack lol.
---
Spellsteal wasn't in Classic...
---
Even shorter is "no"
---
That's the point of OP. He doesn't speak about hardcore guilds.
---
However hardcore players like to spread bs such as "you'll never / have a hard time to find a raid spot", implying in casual guilds as well.
---
ye, if you fuck up consistently
---
It wasn't? Uh, the more you know.
---
get away
---
Only thing I will miss from retail is arena, but it is such in travesty of a state that it's not really worth it anymore anyway.
---
No it's not. If it was adjusted for US at 11PM on the 26th (EST), and you access from the EU, and it doesn't convert(adjust) for your timezone (let's say GMT+3), you get a countdown for 2 hours earlier. How is this so hard to understand ?
---
Ive been rewatching Prison Break lately and that high pitch violin or whatever must be a sample from there, it sounds the same
---
I don't think that is much of a secret, wasn't that vendor used for one of the .05 sets?
---
Rem is also best girl.
---
He was also the Guild Leader. His name is/was Dives.  
---
I was in Wipe Club (i played holy priest) when they rerolled Alliance on Boulderfist. Best raid leader/guild leader I've ever had! He only yelled when people fucked up several times in a row. Usually he was calm, or drunk, as he's from Finland.
---
If you really think that youve either never healed classic (raids) or you suck(ed) at healing.
---
Was it Ioneye? Orc Shaman from &lt;Aurora&gt; on Arthas-US.
---
Oh boy i wrote something similar to them , good i dont remember my password for my old email.
---
yea, but the amazon one also has spelling mistakes (at least from what u can see on the picture), the one linked above doesn't :)
---
Rogue in everquest vs rogue in wow is funny af to me. Rogue was boring as shit in EQ.
---
FYI they decided to join the army in the first place, all on their own, knowing about the living standards.
---
ICH WILL
---
14 years ago classic was 18 dollars, given economic changes, you're technically getting a better deal.
---
I dont think so. If it is only hitting high now I doubt they will open up more later. At least I hope not, having just one pvp server means a way higher chance at an even faction spread.
---
I'm not rolling a Warrior, but if I was then obtaining Hand of Rag would be so low on my list of priorities.
---
It would be there, but more as a post-Naxx things to do sort of priority.
---
**EU, Gehennas PVP, Horde**
---
Anyone up for some duo at launch? I'm going to play orc warrior, would prefer a healer class (Shaman). Probably won't take a break until lvl 30.
---
No thanks. Unions have a good track record in America to be tied with mobsters and other organized crime shinanigans. 
---
Don't get.me wrong they started out Noble and good and accomplished a lot...but they were taken over. (Not all ofc)
---
French Perth?
---
Did you comment the same to OP about people liking different things? Given the nature of the post? 
---
Vanilla was full of people trying to claim the game was all about levelling 9 alts and maxing your fishing. The common denominator amongst these were that they couldnt get past the MC thrash.
---
My retail characters are in comas
---
Remote support softwares are not designed for this. In fact, they only send screenshots in succession, not live video.
---
I booked 2 weeks off work on release, when I got back I said I went on holiday to Azeroth. A guy responded with "I visited there last time I was in Greece"
---
 It took everything in me not to laugh in his face.
---
 People preached the same thing you are now before Osrs was released. It's now refereed to as EfficiencyScape.
---
People like yourself can do what you want, but don't dream for a second you will be seeing the masses  just lollygagging around the map aimless taking in the scenery. We all know what to do now and how the game plays. Efficiency will be the focus and those like yourself who want to take their time will be the minority. 
---
Which is fine, play how you want to play, but don't preach to the rest of us to stop talking about being efficient with our time. Play however you want, and others will too. 
---
But what you're preaching and dreaming for is a pipedream. We've seen it already play out before.
---
A buddy of mine played a Ret Paladin in PvE back in the day. He performed as well as the majority of our warriors, rogues, and mages. It's a different play style (mostly on hit effects) but if you know how to do it it is definitely doable.
---
As are more specs if you know your specialization and how to gear for it.
---
I didn't know the guy but there was a feral (cat) druid in Lords of the Apocalypse back in the day who out-DPS'd one of our top warriors.
---
Iirc it will despawn the mob if non-Hunters help
---
Pretty much. I'm appalled no one is questionning this, but positive vote percentage (84) says something.
---
At the start OP seems to be from Blizzard:
---
&gt; Our dedicated Blizzard team
---
And then he's a player:
---
&gt; THANK YOU for giving us the opportunity to enjoy such a great game all over again.
---
It was 25s per port on all the pservers I've played. 1g is incredibly overpriced either way. The one time I did pay someone a gold he thanked me mentioning the large tip.
---
I realize mages will be all over the place.. I chose mage because that was my original character and that's what I want to revisit first :D 
---
Simple, pure nostalgia. And dying really, really easily
---
RemindMe! 5 hours
---
Mate I totally agree and I’ve played since 2008 with only a couple of breaks.  Can’t wait to just enjoy the leveling, questing and professions again.  Seeing the game on ultra when you used to play it on low settings alone makes it awesome! Problem is retail wow for quite a few years now has drummed onto ppl race to cap for the end content! Basically retail is more endgame focused.  With LFR, Mythic +, scalable normal, heroic raids, 20 man mythic raid, arena and more.
---
I'm a cow. Does it really matter?
---
If you invade them first, they can't invade you! :;)
---
The thing is, I'd rather spend time with her than play Wow. But sometimes she just lets me play and doesn't mind. Rarely it clashes with my gaming time. Except that sometimes you just need to finish a dungeon or raid no matter what.
---
No fun in that. Got to find ways to waste time untill launch. :D
---
That is not an argument.
---
everyone needs a healer :D  we're going horde but me and my friends have differing schedules so wont be leveling too much together.
---
completely agree, a lot of people treat wow as though it's a competitive sport and that mindset only really applies to like 5% of the player base who can sink the time into it.  if you're not in that goup it's really kind of silly to worry about it imo
---
i had such a fucking good laugh with my guild on ely, even though we maybe wiped more often than we should.  One night we took about 3 hours to do a DM run because i was druid and the only healer and we kept fucking up and wait for people to corpse run.  It was both insanely frustrating and also hilariously memey because after the first 30 minutes we were fucking around, doing stupid pulls and intentionally getting dps killed and shit like that
---
I quit when they stopped 40 mans... what is wrong with you
---
&lt;Ethos&gt; NA-PVP | Alliance | **[Herod]** Semi-hardcore PVE / (Tues/Thurs 7:30-10:30pm CST)
---
**About us:** A fabled few came together with similar interests, level of play and determination to form the guild known as ‘Ethos’. A group of close players that have been raiding with each other over the years but now are turning our focus towards Classic. A fresh start and ultimately a perfect point in time to expand our roster. 
---
**Leadership:** Understanding of group make ups, debuffs, buffs and preparedness is vital to progress effectively in Classic. We are confident to build a strong foundation of players to strive with one another and learn along the way. Classic is about the social aspect and we intend to take that seriously. 
---
**Schedule:** We are currently looking at Tues /Thurs - for our main raid nights with the chance of a off night forming for 20mans. 7:30-10:30pm CST. 
---
**Loot:** (SK) We understand the importance of each individual in regards to how loot is handled and the way it is distributed. Considering a few factors; position in raid (ie. MT), and a specific item list, we have decided to use the Suicide King system. As a guild we will try our hardest to maintain and equally distribute the desired loot under the above circumstances. This system will be discussed in further detail during guild meetings.
---
**Goals / Expectations:** Knowing how / where the guild will progress over the next few months is key for a new member to take into consideration when picking a home. At Ethos we are committed to providing a reasonable set of requirements and goals a semi hardcore raider would come to expect. (Attendance, consumables, class knowledge, positivity!)
---
**Positions:** We are recruiting DPS and healers. Apply and you will most likely find a raid spot! Of course over the leveling process, positions will fill up and a permanent roster will begin to form. 
---
**To Apply:** Straight forward application process - Links below

I can understand what you are trying to say but I don’t think you are grasping that the very moment of release is at the exact same moment everywhere therefore a countdown to that moment will be the same anywhere.
---
Love blog posts 🙄
---
I would say the important part is communicating. 
---
This is classic, not BfA. 
---
If something good/rare drops, tell the group you want to roll for it before rolling.
---
Preferably check the gear of the others in the group to see if they already have items you are interested in / if items that can drop are a bigger upgrade for them. Try to be informed before the roll timer starts.
---
If the group leader is specifically after a single drop, it is fine to reserve it as long as this is communicated clearly to anyone joining (even if they would not compete for the item, since they could be effected by the longer time to form the group).
---
If you want to roll on off-spec gear, ask the rest of the group first. If they say no, either accept it, and only roll your main spec, or try to find a different group. (If you make the group, you can set those rules).
---
Classic is an MMORPG, you need to talk to people to get the most out of the game.
---
Communication is the key to winning the game.
---
Why does he have +7 agility enchant on gloves?
---
If you already played retail, you got it for free.
---
I'd say the same if it wasn't for literally all of my friends refusing to join English servers due to language insecurities. I was the only one in ou ~20 ppl group that was happy to hear no German dedicated servers were being opened initially and the only one being bumped when they announced them. That being said, I highly value any minute spend with them and if it means I have to be stuck with ze Germans, I'm going to be stuck with them. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
This has to be a troll post ...
---
Took 2 weeks off starting next week tuesday. My work doesn't require me to have days off approved. If I have vacation days I want to use, I just write it on our general agenda in Outlook and give a heads up in a daily stand up or sprint meeting so they won't wait for me next week in case they didn't check and think I might be late. Everyone will probably just assume I'm going on a holiday.
---
That's been fixed in Classic and won't work anymore. Same for stacking reckoning on a Paladin.
---
Im sure your boss is happy that you think that
---
It will be implemented in first patch after release (at least they said)
---
you're from Germany right? Gamestar is selling a World of Warcraft Classic special issue with a XXL-poster of a very similar looking map for 9,99€
---
Honestly you can take a good look at this thread and Google some of the mentioned things and be better than 80% of Hunters
---
Word thanks. The idea is that remorseless will refresh frequently esp in dungeons for a big crit boost, and backstabs will be hitting pretty hard. I didn’t go deeper off hand as i thought the white damage from a fast dagger would be negligible
---
Is the Night’s Watch quest a reference to game of thrones? I think the original book came out before WoW, and the NPC is dressed for it.
---
&gt; until some other good mmo comes out  
---
Good luck with that buddy. There's been no better MMO for 15 years and the market is getting more and more niche. I wouldn't wait for another MMO, this is the one.
---
DKP system takes care of all of this.
---
(Dragon Kill Points before anyone asks)
---
Das licht, wir den sieg bringen!
---
I had gotten used to how my druid looked with the new models that I had to dig up my old screenshots from 2005 to ensure I got the character options exactly right.
---
We were, when we started on naxx it was really difficult to find enough good swedes on our server so we went int by then, been int ever since but a majority has always been swedes
---
&gt;while making sure those 40 people dont get butthurt they didnt receive loot. 
---
That's what loot systems are for. Cant be mad at other playing having more DKP because they showed up to more raids (or got less loot previously).
---
&gt;40 fucking people  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;40 fucks  
---
&gt;40 idiots
---
Great etiquette. You must be great to talk to at dinner parties.
---
&gt;Perhaps classic isn't for me then?
---
Apparently it's not.
---
played alliance for the first 2 years ( because of the pal -30% aggro benediction )  then horde for 13 years
---
What is this layering thing? Anyone care to elaborate please?
---
SOMETHING NEED DOING?
---
I've joined a video- and board games student association 2 years ago and a large friends' group there is going to play WoW Classic. Our Whatsapp group is up to 20 folks and that's only the ones we know of that have reserved names. That's going to be a hell of a lot different than playing as a thirteen year old solo rogue. Hype!
---
I intially thought it would favour Alliance because of Frostmourne is so heavily alliance ballanced.
---
The first useful "my wife, girl or boyfriend made me..." post.
---
Thank you!
---
All the countdowns are counting down to 1566856800 epoch timestamp, which is the same everywhere in the solar system. 
---
If any are counting down to anything else it's because whoever made them had absolutely no idea what they were doing.
---
I think it was around WotLK that keyloggers started being more common and easier to smuggle into your computer.
---
Curse also had security issues around this time and lots of people lost their accounts.
---
Night elf hunter named oakshas
---
Probably won't be for long anyway.
---
Seen a few Singapore guilds recruiting.
---
Make a guild and find like minded people, like me.
---
Some retail zones have really nice music aswell. Like Stormsong Valley for example. But i cant wait to play Classic again with music and ambience on.
---
We have characters on Stalagg and Herod. We have decided to let the queue times decide our fate.
---
Well trust me; if youre always the healer that ensures dungeons get done, is the last to die in raids, solo heals the last few % of a progress boss while the other 32 people are cheering on ts/vent/discord; your name will stick in peoples mind for sure.
---
Then you really can't appreciate the way it is without flying, because there really was often no difference between 60% flying and 100% mount in TBC.
---
Now without flying getting to the dungeon itself on a PvP server was an objective in itself. I often join up with the people on discord if they are happy to do so. We all fly to Kargath and wait there for the full 5men group or maybe even 5.
---
Then you make the decision if you want a prot tank who is more efficient in the dungeon, but can't impact a brawl in front of the dungeon meaningfully, therefore you may prefer taking an arms warrior who can smash his way through ganking alliance players.
---
Flying butchers a good 80% of gameplay for a lot of players.
---
Classic PvE is easy, therefore I do dungeons to do raids to get items suited for PvP to go out in the world to measure my e-peen with the opposing faction.
---
For me PvE is a way to get better in PvP and PvP is nonexistant with flying mounts.
---
Aha ok, either way that’s really  great! Hope you guys have a blast playing together.
---
Ps. What server are you guys going for? ;)
---
And me too pls
---
Seems you dont get what classic is all about. Go back to BFA..

***&lt;Trouble&gt; [EU-Horde-PvP]*** is a community-driven, progression-focused, English-speaking raiding guild. We've been playing online games together for upwards of 15 years, and we've picked up a whole bunch of great players and good friends along the way. We have a wide array of players from all across Europe, and beyond, with varying different levels of experience. 
---
We have players who have reached high heights in both PvE and PvP across various expansions, but also others that have never even played vanilla WoW before. With this in mind, we are creating an inclusive guild where everyone is welcome, as long as they're enthusiastic and willing to play with us to the best of their ability.
---
***Server***
---
We are currently watching and waiting to monitor faction balance and population on the realms We’d like to avoid being in ridiculous queues or ending p on a dead server. For now, all we know for sure, is that we will be rolling on **Shazzrah, Golemagg or Gehennas** and that we will make a final decision 2-3 days before launch. We have reserved names on all three.
---
***Leveling*** - 
---
There will be no rush to level 60. We will begin raids as soon as we have the force to do so, but if it takes you a couple of weeks longer than other people, nobody cares. You will probably be able to join the early birds once you get there. Take your time; enjoy the experience. 
---
***Raiding*** - 
---
We will be raiding two nights a week (all times are in **Server Time (CET)**):
---
**Sunday 8:00-11:30 PM** //
---
**Tuesday 8:00-11:30 PM**
---
Come Phase 3 (BWL), an additional raid night will be added to revisit older raid tiers:
---
**Wednesday 8:00-11:30 PM**
---
All participants are expected to bring their own consumables. You don't have to be doing top tier DPS/HPS, but you do need to respect the rest of the guild enough to bring what you need to be functional in a raid.
---
**Loot System** - 
---
Our loot system will be a very simple, closed bid DKP system with partial decay to help deter hoarding. Name a more iconic duo than loot council and drama.
---
When the third raid day is introduced in Phase 3 (BWL), it is worth noting that it will NOT use the DKP system, and all items will be rolled (main-spec priority, as usual) between raiders who want them. The reason for this is that a lot of people in the guild can only raid two days a week, tops, and they should not feel like they have to come to this raid in order to keep up on DKP for the main tier raids.
---
**Classes** - 
---
Like any other guild, we would prefer the dominant classes with meta specs. However, we do believe that the player comes above the class and spec in a lot of circumstances. If you're dedicated, positive and willing to listen, those things go an exceptionally long way.
---
With that in mind, we are willing to give most people a shot, with the caveat that those classes and specs with a generally weak performance may find it harder to earn a permanent raid spot. If you are very confident in your ability to play an off-meta spec that isn’t listed below to an acceptable level, feel free to contact us:
---
**Druid** - **CLOSED** //
---
**Hunter** - **CLOSED** //
---
**Mage** - **CLOSED** //
---
**Priest** - **CLOSED** //
---
**Rogue** - **CLOSED** //
---
**Shaman** - **CLOSED** //
---
**Warlock** - **CLOSED** //
---
**Warrior** - **CLOSED**
---
**Classes that are closed are still welcome to join, but you probably won’t be able to raid with us unless/until we have a huge turnover of people.**
---
***Contact*** - 
---
We’d love to answer any questions you may have. The best way to contact us is by joining our Discord:
---
https://discord.gg/Wj2fMHP
---
You can also talk to an officer directly on Discord:
---
**JJ#5133, ianb#7738, Fugger#2372, blart blart blart#4655, Samszee#8393**
---
Or doing the same on Battle.net:
---
**JJWF#2321, Beanbag#1500, Fugger#2886, Minelaugh#1147, Samszee#2275**
---
Thanks for your time!
---
I took Tuesday - Friday off.. don’t have to give reasons for my PTO use, so just have my boss a heads up that I’ll be off those days.
---
Yeah, after I'm done playing vanilla, I sometimes search for other mmo's. Still didn't find any good mmo. I used to love SWTOR, but it changed to the mess it is today. So I'm stuck with vanilla/classic. Which in my opinion is the best mmo there is.
---
Found a guild with a raid time that fits my schedule. That's it really. If you can't fit in a few hours a week for your hobby, that's all on you imo.
---
Hello. I'm a alliance player looking for a casual raiding guild to play with. I'm going to be a priest healer on Herod realm.
---
Well they're all overpowered af. Other than that pretty neat.
---
Phase one. Go holy. Phase two. Go holy. Every phase, go holy.
---
Ofc it splits the community that was blizzards intention.
---
havent played since mop actually
---
For sure, constraints and all that.
---
There's layering, so gathering will be a lot easier than it historically has been at server launch. Even if you don't have a ton of uses for it, the herbs can be mailed to a bank alt and saved till the market develops.
---
Yeah seems people forget that trolls and goblins are native, all other races were created.
---
That was just a joke, but I don't think so. I don't recall Legion or BFA going down while I played, or at least not for longer than it takes to reboot a server. Classic runs on the same engine so it shouldn't require the same maintenance as 15 years ago.
---
Genius move for sure!
---
Why you so mad bro 🤣🤣🤣
---
Only if Transmog could be turned off. There are two main reasons why transmog makes the game worse. 1: it ruins item-identity. 2: it makes it so that you can't see what another person is wearing at a glance, and by proxy, what they've accomplished. 
---
Number one could be solved somehow, or at least mitigated I'm sure, but at the very least it's optional even in the system that exists on live. You don't HAVE to transmog your gear. Number two isn't currently optional, if I transmog my gear on retail, it shows up like that for everybody. If they ever introduced a transmog-esque system for classic down-the line, it would HAVE TO BE OPTIONAL. I.e being able to disable OTHER PEOPLE'S transmog.
---
&gt;All the countdowns are counting down to 1566856800 epoch timestamp, which is the same everywhere in the solar system.    
---
Fair enough.  
---
&gt;If any are counting down to anything else it's because whoever made them had absolutely no idea what they were doing.  
---
You never know.
---
layering I believe is like instance zones but they all share the same chat and are on the same server. So you maybe on layer 1 and I am on layer 2. We can talk and all that, but can't see each other cause we are in different layers. If we party I believe one would be moved to the others layer. They plan to remove it by phase 2. It will be used though to help then out zones in the start.
---
its not a money problem
---
You don’t. Or use bait/baubles to increase the skill temporarily.
---
It's still op, just different acc
---
You could still do it in TBC.
---
I'm taking one day off. I didn't say anything, I just put that I'll be using a vacation day.
---
Something to keep in mind, if you play a Night Elf you can use a "slow stealth" technique by casting Feign Death -&gt; Shadowmeld. If you have feigned death within the normal agro radius of a mob, but not within their stealth detection radius, you can cast Shadowmeld without being detected, where you can wait for Feign Death to cool down so you can press forward again.
---
Using Eyes of the Beast to agro enemies and move them where you want them makes this even more effective. I used to sneak deep into AQ20 as a hunter to farm larval acid.

*Hey ho!*
---
*Since both German-speaking realms are full at the moment and it can therefore come to long queues with the publication of WoW Classic, we will provide two new German-language realms for name reservations on Tuesday, August 20 at 20:00 CEST:*
---
***Surname Type language***  
---
*Kraul normal German*  
---
*Venoxis PvP German* 
---
*We recommend players from Everlook and Lucifron think about switching to one of these realms. This helps to distribute the player population as evenly as possible prior to release and to provide the best gaming experience for all.*
---
*One of our top priorities in publishing WoW Classic has been and continues to be building a solid foundation for realm communities that will last for months and years to come. For that reason, we are also cautious about opening new realms.*
---
*To give you some more insight here, in 2019, we will be able to accommodate many more players on a realm than was the case in 2006. And even if we have the technical capacity to raise the realm cap further, we will not do it. Indeed, increasing the realm cap would prevent the problem in the short term (by allowing more players to start), but in the long run (once layering is permanently disabled before the start of the second content phase), it will create an untenable situation with long queues.*
---
*Please also note that the Realms (Low, Medium, High and Full) population estimates displayed in the game are based on these increased capacities - a middle realm already has more characters than a full realm in 2006.*
---
At least until Naxx. Dual Misplaced Servo Arm with Fiery Weapon enchants, Darkmoon Maelstrom + Wyrmthalak trinkets... should kill even plate targets in the first two stuns.
---
I don't. It's just amusing watching people go through mental gymnastics trying to convince others and possibly themselves that WoW Classic was in any way hard, where in fact it was just a humongous time sink. It was fun and I will play it, but I see no point in circle-jerking.
---
While not secretive, I’m not always forthcoming with my reasons.  What I do with my vacation time is mine.  I requested the first week off, my boss was all “of course, going anywhere fun with it”, to which I replied “nope just a staycation”, and that was just fine.
---
have u raided with top 30 world guilds before?
---
We've been waiting 15 years for another mmo to even riv world of warcraft. It hasn't happened. You could be waiting a long time for that new one man.
---
That looks amazing! It's what I really hope for vanilla, instead of the single player experience we have in retail wow these days.
---
She’s definitely a good catch!
---
Troll Hunter, Waanji.
---
Poor Waanji only made it to level 8 or so before I made a dwarf warrior. On the warrior I found a group early on who helped me through quests and got to level 11 in half the time level 8 took on my hunter, so I deleted poor Waanji.
---
Waanji returns next week folks.
---
there are 10 man raids, it's called UBRS.  
---
and AQ20 is also a thing.
---
Well, either way. Classic is not about getting phat loot.. Your attitude is not gonna get you far in Classic. Doubt you can even reach 60.
---
The more gold there is on the server, the less your gold is worth, just like money IRL.  Gold farmers cause loads of extra gold to enter the server which in turn lowers the value of all gold on the server.  
---
&gt;naturally.  
---
Bot farms aren't natural, even though they existed in Vanilla.  Even manual gold farmers whose sole purpose is to grind gold for the purpose of selling for $ isn't natural.  Natural is the farming done by real players who aren't trying to sell it for $.
---
Maybe "FIVE HOUR QUEUES" would fit better, then go for "Four servers locked"?
---
I realised this in bfa recently, there was so much detail in dungeons and encounters that I just never had time to notice. Whenever cool stuff happens is when you're playing whack-a-mole the hardest
---
If you want to rank up in P2, looking for spots where 50+ are leveling is probably the way to go. It's dull (because they can't really fight back) and they'll hate you because you're being an asshole, but you shouldn't die and don't need to share honor with a large group. Most ambitious players will probably group up in teams of 1-3 and roam the 50+ leveling zones. 
---
If you're looking for a challenge, go for the farming spots in the EPL, Un'Goro or (later on) Silithus. Larger scale battles can usually be found in Hillsbrad and at BR mountain during evening hours when raids try to get in. Both will likely reward less honor per hour than ganking low levels though.
---
I dunno, I feel there's a difference between the insufferable desert and the toxic wasteland.
---
Chuckles in rich warlock
---
Granades.
---
soo?
---
Now if we ever do actually get Classic+, I'm fully expecting a patch around the light-forged army to invade Azeroth mistakenly thinking they were going to the original timeline, but ended up in the Classic timeline.
---
I wanted to create a blue Night Elf with the name Mitth'raw'n but alas can't be done :(
---
What you have looks really nice actually.
---
Why not Spanish?
---
you're probably right about that
---
3 months! I work in the same company since 10+ years, it's the law in my country... 
---
i asked my boss in early May, he said "ok for Aug 31".
---
You need to go watch the episode of Patriot Act on Netflix about the dark side of the video game industry. This isn't a figure pulled out of anyone's ass and is probably understated. Call your bullshit after you've done your research.
---
Nah, go buy a big mac meal instead.
---
Should have told the mother that the game was rated 12+.
---
It’s labeled August 26th and 27th. It’s not for name reservation.
---
Some formal, some unspoken. The name thing for exampe is formal iirc. Same for  trying to troll and itnerfere with the RP community.
---
Oh don't worry, thanks to global pollution the cancerous air comes to us all!
---
I get nostalgic for SW:ToR even though I didn't play in the beginning or do any end-game stuff, the story and the voice acting was really cool to go through, especially since other people would participate in the dialogue and everyone had a voice. Wish I was there when it released and discover it with everyone else.  
---
SWTOR classic when ?
---
Or they're relaxing because they finished early.
---
You have no idea, stop gargling their balls.
---
Gold coming from a gnome

I dont know what's more impressive, you recording the first pvp kill OR keeping a HDD from 2004.

Loot reserves will 100% happen.  If you don’t like it, then don’t join those groups.  It’s about as easy as it gets.
---
What happens after naxx?
---
You can use the Twitch app, I heard that ClassicCodex is a better questing addon than Questie
---
Yes it depends. Other people do prefer other racials. Case in point form my original post. Elemental Shaman. Good melee are very hard to get off you. With warstomp? Not so much. You have combos you can do to drop them, you can stun into a nade for an escape/los and heals.The Shaman pvp trinket also gets you out of stun. Free Action potions exist. Some of the best players don't play Orc. Usually the people claiming you HAVE to play Orc are simply bad and looking for every imagined advantage they have based on a streamer saying it or something. Or they simply don't have enough keybinds to use active abilities like warstomp.
---

---
Another example. Perplexity is a god tier rogue. So is this guy. Perplexity REALLY cares about duels though or at least he used to as far as rogue/rogue. This guy doesn't or he would be Orc. Undead can be argued as better in a premade vs premade bg depending on role or in wpvp. It's just bad vs orcs in mirror duels, that don't matter cus it's YOUR FACTION and rogue duels are stupid in the first place, once you get enough gear to drop the opponent in a stealth opener. The easiest class for a rogue to kill is another rogue.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk4oIZifkJ4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk4oIZifkJ4) 
---
Perplexity is now also gnome because he cares more about beating mages than rogues and now thinks rogues duels are stupid (they always were in vanilla). Gnome also opens up a coldblood spec instead of the improved sprint spec you are forced to play against really good mages. I would rather be gnome than orc any day and I would rather be undead than orc because I can pressure priests by myself and priests make the world go round in group pvp. They have the only offensive dispel on alliance and the only defensive cleanse on Horde. Gnomes can get around this in group play because the dwarf priest puts fear ward on you and not the warriors on pushes and goes in WSG.
---
No, but it’s polite to ask. There’s a chance they say, like, Montreal, and you’ve been there before! Make sure you hit up &lt;certain bar&gt;, that place is a hoot. And grab some poutine for sure. Can’t wait to hear about it when you get back! 
---
It’s mostly out of politeness and to keep tabs on your coworkers. You really don’t have to but just saying that it’s a staycation or personal will mean that they won’t bother you with anything else. 
---
Luckily I work in software dev so I am extremely forthcoming with my wow hype.
---
Not really... nobody can stay up for 116 hours straight while also leveling at a world record efficiency. I bet less than 10 players (all hunters) will hit 60 within the first 4 days and that would be playing in shifts with another person taking over while the other sleeps. The larger waves of the "first" level 60's will be a week in.
---
You're a god
---
Absolutely nobody would lose a name using this method. Anyone who paid to reserve on Herod would actually still have their name twice between the two clone servers.
---
As for population, this plan assumes that Herod would be beyond overpopulated, into the realm of near-unplayable after Phase 2 if nothing is done.
---
It's more something for Blizzard to consider as an option since they're the ones with the real numbers.
---
Is this true in EU? More horde? If it is that might be what makes me roll alliance.
---
'Here's a picture clearly showing the release times in each relevant time zone....Please read it for me and tell me when I can play'...
---
Lol?
---
I prefer the greatest rewards sprinkled in across all different aspects of the game. Then it becomes truly massive because you have to explore all avenues of gameplay. Besides, funneling everything into raiding can be a bit isolating.
---
Not sure what answer you expect when asking on this sub 8 days before launch. Yes, the game that made MMORPG's mainstream and made headlines around the world is worth $15/month.
---
I thought you could just fish anywhere and level up no matter what?
---
Absolutely not, don't bother with it. Buy my cooked fish from the AH instead. :)
---
Absolutely, but you'd be missing out if you don't hit Arathi Highlands (most personal favorite zone in all of Vanilla, cannot wait to get back.)
---
out of the weirder specs it is the best one
---
I took off the 27th and the 28th. Told my boss straight up and he thought it was cool. He even said he used to take call of duty release days off. Most people are okay with it because it's cool to see people being passionate about what they like.
---
We are our own breed, the others do not understand.
---
Sorry I am just confused.
---
So am I supposed to fish there until 25?
---
Yes. It's fun and does well if you prepare. Play it.
---
Whole eastern europe don't want language servers.  
---
As a pole i dont want to play with other people from Poland, same goes for Ukraine, whole balkans probably czech and slovakia too. It's a bit of cultural thing that we hate eachother and carving to be in the better west. These servers would be empty.
---
Dunno about scavs tho, but they mainly use english to communicate, so they prefer to pick one realm and call it a unofficial scandinavian server, same with other nations.
---
And people in NA will never understand the beauty of playing for 6 hours with someone to finally ask him "where are you from?" and after he replies "Poland" you go for "o kurwa ja też :)".
---
You can turn that off can't you?
---
SHOOTS YOU A PM
---
Who is he and why he has female name?
---
all i know is 'pfeffer' and it makes think how my oma gives me and my brother pfeffernusse every time she sees us :D

Atta boy
---
The only thing you provide a 40-man raid is shadow weaving. So many guilds don’t take more than 3 locks in order to not even need shadow weaving. There you have it, you're a healer now.
---
They are the most viable of the "hybrid" dps specs, ie more viable than Ele, Enhance, Feral, Boomkin, Ret etc.
---
However a raid of 40 people will likely bring only 1 Shadow Priest per raid, due to having a % Shadow Damage debuff that Warlocks want.
---
People here will talk about viable vs. optimal, but there is no reason to bring more than 1 Shadow Priest per raid, unless the content is so trivial that it does not matter. I dont think you are being a optimal min-maxer who pisses in bottles cause he raids hardk0re if you pick a random Fury Warrior who will do 2-3x more damage than a Shadow Priest, that is just common sense.
---
If you pick a Shadow Priest, then make sure you learn the ins and outs of it, because while a spot is there, its likely just 1 spot. And you will compete with other Shadow Priests for it. If you want a easier time, just pick a Warlock instead, they become a top tier DPS class as the tiers progress.
---
DOUBT
---
THEY DREW FIRST BLOOD!!
---
Since the debuff slot isn’t 8 as it were in the beginning but 16, yes you will be able to do viable damage and support the warlocks’ damage. You want for the most part 1 spriest in a raid. 
---
The only reason why you wouldn’t bring ret paladins &amp; feral dps is if you’re a competing guild.. otherwise it is totally plausible, and it has its strengths and weaknesses but totally doable. 
---
You should be good. Just commit to it, look up guides on how to perform the best possible way, do your best, remember consumables and you are good.
---
&gt;and countdowns like that exist.
---
Yet the one which this entire comment thread is about, *which you yourself started,* is the one made by the people we're relying on to make the game. 
---
If that one is made by amateurs, we're fucked regardless.
---
You only need to level weapon skill once.  Doesn't matter if you respec after that.
---
Possibly the most ignorant shit I'll see all day... Stay tuned though someone might beat you
---
Its possible to play classic 10-20 hours a week and still achieve almost everything except for some pvp stuff. I'm sure if you played so little in vanilla you missed the bus (because also so much time was spent on just learning how to play the game), but hopefully classic will be around for much longer and you are not learning from 0 this time around and people won't just stop doing raids 3-4 months after classic launch.
---
Qqqwwqwawwwwww#¥w~`wWww@@aWw22 we sausas WA aaaa WA WA qqaaq qawww1¥aWQAwWwweWwe1211AAWW

😢
---
You will have a total different experience. In Vanilla you can only healbot. No prot. Ret only for the lulz.
---
4 weeks is standard in Australia (personally 5 weeks and I only have 156 rostered days in a year anyway) I am blown away reading that so many dont get PTO
---
We drifted apart sadly, he ended up meeting a girl who already had a kid and has been doing a great job of taking care of both of them - I’ve thought about asking him if he’s gonna try out classic though, maybe that could rekindle our friendship haha
---
I'm game on barbershops, not so game on transmog. 
---
I do like transmog, but this isn't super casual fashionscrolls online the single player MMO (even though I love that game despite some glaring issues - eso, if you don't know what I'm talking about), at glance I want to be able to gauge my comrades and enemies gear. I want to gasp at impressive armour and weapons people have truly earned... I want to fear opponents that out gear me and know its all down to skill. And likewise I want people to brick it if they see I out gear them. I think that's important. 
---
End game item identity is a significant part of World of Warcraft, but then again looking cool as fuck and keeping 60s engaged with lower level content is a big deal and a super cool advantage of transmog I'd not really identified before. 
---
You're on the money. I'm just conflicted.
---
you can see the front on the potrait.
---
There are no macros in this sheet. Only gear. And it's from Taladril and not Ebbnflow
---
Hundreds of thousands?
---
He was just a little Troll! These were the actions of a child and they murdered him!!
---
And it is an nightelf.. I think I got a match.
---
Or in other words: based on way less than half the players.
---
First words in title "No Troll", definitely a troll. Thanks for not wasting my time reading this.
---
How about only you can see your transmog? I think that could be a nice middle ground where you get to look how you want without affecting other peoples game experience
---
So he could complain.
---
Ye, this is all made up for sure.
---
Just briefly looking over the molten core drops. Feral druid here I come! 
---
 Cool designs but a lot of items felt to strong.
---
&gt;Vanilla was full of people trying to claim the game was all about levelling 9 alts and maxing your fishing.
---
Those people are going to breeze through the content now, though.
---
Classic is piss easy by modern standards, especially when you take into account how easily available all the information is. 
---
Mechanics wise the only bosses that might be "challenging" are cthun and hardmode hakkar, and the latter is just a meme. Naxx is mostly about having enough tanks in the guild, so you can get past 4horseman.
---
Also, anyone who played EQ semi-seriously would look at vanilla like it's babbys first MMO. At least in terms of the grind.
---
&gt; Kraul
---
Misread that as *Kraut*
---
Really? I live in Germany for 2 years and I want a change this time. On retail I was on a english speaking realm, now I found a nice German guild.
---
This is pretty much what I was gonna say lol. Sometimes I just don't understand people
---
Threat management is a very real thing. Cleaving large packs of baddies as a Rogue is a BAD idea in dungeons in vanilla. To much Afro from one mob and your a healers problem then. Healer should never have to worry about a Rogue.
---
Female orc is my waifu. I'm rolling one for an alt.
---
At least in the atress test and beta it was doable to get ahead of the pack if you know what you're doing. At least I saw a lot of streamers who did it. So I guess you can do aoe farming
---
lets assume staff has 3.0 weapon speed, in your scenario its:
---
wrath &gt; 3 sec &gt; weapon hit &gt; moonfire &gt; 3 sec &gt; weapon hit
---
when you can do:
---
wrath &gt; moonfire &gt; 3 sec &gt; weapon hit 
---
AA timer starts at the end of casting not at the beginning. Wrath cast time is 1,5 sec so GCD is over and you can use moon right after wrath cast
---
But yeah, very minor difference anyway.
---
Honestly i think I’m gonna do this! Just to kind of counter the shit I’m going to fill my body with while playing classic
---
*" I never played vanilla, but I watched that Unbreakable video and will use that as my baseline for how Shaman performed back then."*
---
problem is we will have 500k concurrent players, if not more. We need more servers, badly.
---
Its literally the exact opposite
---
Servers shut down. /s
---
For sure, big cleaved butt pokes lol, and not optional but viable. An idea was maximizing vanish as an optional dps cd.
---
I hope so, I still use mine to log on to battlenet.
---
The only Rets that are gonna raid are either R13/14 players in PvP focused guilds and people in mediocre guilds(mediocre clear times that is)
---
Good size
---
Better off just going Shadow. You'll be doing far more damage as a group over time with shadow+mage than PI disc+mage. Plus you'll be far more viable solo for whenever you're playing alone or your friend isn't online or w/e. Plus you can still heal every dungeon/group just fine. The only major downside to Shadow is mana, which with spirit tap isn't too bad but with a mage friend gifting you water whenever you need, you can pump out far more spells and focus far less on wanding, which will greatly increase your DPS, and thus, your group's overall DPS. Just my two cents.
---
you could just add und your @mousover line a normal line with:
---
/cast "spell"  
---
then if you mouseover something it will cast on the mouseover target. if nothing is on your mouse you will cast at your current selected target.
---
True. Not to mention you rarely see the same person twice. There are no player reputations anymore. It's turned into a very weird game, i wouldn't say its actually BAD but it is no longer world of warcraft. Most of the veteran players want the old experience, the old game model. It filled a niche and it was beautiful. I think Blizzard / Activision just ended up ditching focus on the niche role the game filled and focused on more popular themes that were making other games popular.
---
Yeah, I very much agree to that. Scaling and difficulty-settings completely ruin immersion that only a persistent world can offer.
---
Something should be easy when it makes sense to be easy and something should be difficult when it makes sense to be difficult.
---
This "everything is easy unless you set it to a higher difficulty" ruined Diablo 3 for me and it did the same with WoW.
---
Awesome! thx!
---
I just use a single lure and fish for the entire 10 min every so often. Sometimes I use two if I'm already there. It makes it feel much less intrusive.
---
finally some content in this sub
---
casual guild don't need to worry about finding people for 1-2 months so that's probably why you don't see any.
---
I'm confused, how is the population 'high' already when it hasn't officially been released yet?
---
I salute you, Sir.
---
I wouldn't want a language server for my language either. But loads of  Germans obviously did.
---
Wouldn't they be in code freeze by now?
---
Lol no we don't have 500k concurrent, not even on launch night.
---
If we did we'd be seeing queues of 100k+
---
A lot of us do! Just not enough
---
Pm with info please
---
Nicely done.
---
This is usually me... but I've been bullied into switching factions and playing Horde by my friends... 
---
Kinda don't care how my guy looks as Hordies are all ugly AF anyway T-T
---
How would a warlock make it to the king though? That guard just after the locked door would kill the lock instantly.
---
Haha, tbh I almost cried tonight thinking about her going. I don't know how I'm gonna feel. She starts in 2 days lol. It sounded like a great holiday before but as the time gets closer I'm getting teary lol.
---
I was 11 and loved every bit of wPvP. 
---
Could never get enough even though I was the one who did the most dying.
---
Male cows have an ever-so-slightly larger hitbox from females.
---
Both are much larger than other races. Check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By8Ny6BJwKY) out.
---
*To see the reply of this comment you need to pay reddit silver*
---
Remorseless is almost always taken in Seal Fate spec.
---
Me too please!
---
How do you know? Its a week until launch. I am certain we will see queues close to 100k. You can come back here and eat your words on monday.
---
* Log on
---
* Do dailys
---
* Log out
---
Is that casual friendly?
---
Just jump in and play you get to experience vanilla from a new player perspective.
---
I played the original game so im kinda jealous you gte to experience the game with a blank slate. 
---
didnt really understand fishing untill this.  Thanks.
---
Not sure on the exact offset of xp, but I know for sure if there is a sizable lvl difference you get hardly any Xp. Typically dungeon groups would be working 3-5 lvl of each other, 5 maybe being kinda high
---
True, but it's not like more loot will drop. Or will still take X weeks for the mages and warlocks to get their gear before the laser chickens.

The fact of you still answering me proves that you care

nice only one week before release what can go wrong (:

How does loot reservation handle multiple people reserving the same item? A need roll off?
---
Haven't seen that term for a loot division system before.

The night before I'm at a music festival, so I expect I'll have no problem sleeping afterward for as long as I can. Then wake up on the 26th, have some birthday cake, then take a nap! Wake up at 8 PM and start getting ready for server launch.  
---
I've taken 2 weeks off work for launch with the goal of playing as much as I can within the normal sleep schedule I have for work. That way when I go back it won't be a massive blow to my sleep pattern.
---
Wake up 5:45 AM  
---
Workout, Shower, Breakfast  
---
Start stream 8 AM  
---
Then take 15 minute breaks every 2 hours to grab some cardio/caffinate/food.  
---
Stop 9 PM  
---
Chill and Bed 10 PM  
---
Sleep, do it all over again!

I've got all my meals, nutrition and workouts planned out ahead of time so I can try be online as much as possible.

You want an alt or guildie who can make you linen and then wool bags ASAP. Install a junk add on like ez junk or lazy pig that will sell all your junk automatically when you click on a vendor.
---
Glad to hear it, this is my plan too!
---
&gt; some it'll take months, 
---
I would argue that if it 'takes months' for nostalgia to wear off then that just means they finally got bored. I tend not to play the average game for more than a month myself. WoW was one of maybe 8 games I have been able to keep playing for more than that time.
---
My friend wants to try classic but does not want to pay 14 dollars or whatever. Is free trial working for retail and classic? :)
---
Alright, I thought about if there were something else with the +agi that i didnt know about, like some "secret" pro PVP thing.
---
I can't wait any longer this is killing me. I haven't felt like this since I was young waiting for Christmas this is wild
---
Not supported by mobile :(
---
There's a great game underneath all the poor design decisions in retail. It's such a shame what it has come to.
---
You can fish in, say, Durotar at 0 fishing skill, but some casts won't catch anything.
---
This is bad because,  unlike retail, a failed catch doesn't increase your skill.
---
You have 2 choices:
---
Just soldier on - getting to 25 skill isn't that tough even with a lot of misses.
---
Use lures to increase your skill temporarily (this won't avoid the problem entirely, but will mitigate it. 
---
The main message is that, once you get to 25, you should never fish in a zone where you haven't hit the 'no get-aways' level - you're just wasting time.
---
Indeed!
---
ok Bart Simpson
---
They've already said a medium pop server today has a higher number of players than in vanilla.
---
Every realm is at least on medium, even the language specific ones, no low servers on EU either.
---
Ohh.. So that's the game we're going to play. We're going to sit around with our eyes shut REALLY TIGHT and put our fingers in our ears. Meanwhile, we will imagine that it's not taking place on one of the most anticipated, long-awaited video game projects to be released this year. Even though Blizzard-Activision has been known in the past to use crunch to meet deadlines along with every other major studio. But you're right. If you block it out, you can go into Classic guilt free.
---
Must feel like a hit in the guts as a spaniard or a brazilian
---
I take it we can still engage in world PVP though?
---
Shh don't give Reddit ideas
---
Tou cant talk on general chats when you're low level and.on a trial, though.
---
Yes absolutely I do. These are private server poopsock guilds. They will get it done in one week and they've done it before. I've seen their schedules and even I could pull that off and I'm not a very dedicated player.
---
I imagine Blizzard has the methods to do something like this, however it would need to be done sooner rather than later to let everyone coordinate.  
---
Since our characters on Classic are currently only names, appearance, race, and class, this is most likely much easier than trying to copy a realm that has players who have logged in and received items, leveled up, etc. There is much less data involved than on a live server.
---
Yeah I think people know that.  But face it, what we are anticipating as being classic and what original WoW actually was are somewhat different.  For many people, world PvP characterized classic WoW.
---
Also, even back then, people looked down on PvE servers.
---
Not true at all.  
---
I was in the beta from the first wave in March of '04, and the first pvp server was opened in June.  I have my own screenshots of one of the first pvp raids from the alliance to Brill on June 17th.
---
Some might like it but a majority don't, and those who do like it doesn't like the fact they don't get payed shit for it.
---
It's a very very bad issue in the game dev industry and nothing that should be glamored in any way.
---
thanks for all the answers guys, good to hear it wont cause any serious issues. :)
---
Stars aligned for me. Summer quarter ends on the 23rd, then 4 weeks off.
---
&gt; The best part of classic was learning, the journey to 60 and not just end game. 
---
The best part *for you*.  Personally, I fucking despised that part of the game.  The game didn't begin for me until level 60.
---
Upper 20s- mid 30s. And bloodbaths won’t wait for honor system 😎
---
X for doubt, saw another comment you said you were top 10 for your class in logs. 0% chance given the post i just read.
---
Don't think that's a healthy attitude tbh.
---
On retail a lot of people that are to bad to get into a PUG raid (Or don't have any EXP 6 weeks into the raid tier), will make their own raid and then proceed to not do any leading, wasting everyones time.
---
I don't mind it if the raid lead doesn't parse 100% every time, but i expect him to do proper leading, finding weak spots and trying to fix them, adapting tactics to our roster or even developing your own tactics for your team.
---
I know classic is "solved" but that doesn't mean that one tactic works for every raid.
---
Sometimes even just for reading normal books, I got weird looks. But that was mostly from my team mates since I was in a European football club.
---
I even went to a computer science high school which I was embarrassed to admit to them. 
---
But yeah, man, I feel you. I never went out at weekends, I was actually home reading and watching my favorite tv shows and movies. This was just more fun to me.
---
I went out a couple of times and just saw that people get drunk and do stupid shit. And that never attracted me. I guess it's fun for them, and I don't mind that it is. I just wish they wouldn't have looked at me like I'm a freak because I don't wanna party. 
---
I'd rather stay at home or invite two or three friends over so we can have a nice party and talk about stuff or go to the movie theater or something.
---
Once I went out and said that I don't drink alcohol, and the pretty girl asks me "How the hell do you have fun in life then?". That was funny. Seeing someone that has fun only while drinking alcohol. That really made me think if there are a lot of people like that. I basically have fun every day without one drop of alcohol.
---
Shit, that comment really is too long. Sorry about that.
---
Well some people have played classic so much. Private servers and all that. So the 1-60 is not really a journey anymore.
---
So with your excuse, a lot of charities are pointless because people can just pick a different career? And with this different career they can afford all the things? Did you ever think that some people join the military for reasons like getting out of bad situations, no money for school, no real home to go to? Nah, probably not. Because you have a hateful agenda about a charity giving candy to those who serve in some capacity. Gotcha.
---
 [https://legacy-wow.com/classic-addons/](https://legacy-wow.com/classic-addons/)
---
but the pizza pie is real
---
i meant i'd be fine with the whole classic+ thing, but i think if that does happen it should be optional. kind of like if they came out with tbc and wotlk servers, the expectation would be that people could opt-in to them. otherwise if they forced people into tbc and wrath blizz would alienate the people who just wanted vanilla. the same thing i could see happening if they forced classic+ on people. even if they were to do it perfectly i think there's lots of people who don't want constant new content. at least for me i want there to be an endgame where i can beat all the raids, get the best gear, etc., and spend most my time pvping from there.
---
Simpy not true saying healing is not fun. It depends what kind of person you are. I like DPS and Healing for PvP but I cannot imagine myself playing DPS in raiding. I would get bored to death spamming the simple rotations they have.
---
If you free farm yourself its around 270g/hr, at least private server gold was roughly 10% of that in $

He lived in Ohio during vanilla.  
---
Pretty close to me, I wanted to offer to buy him a beer sometime but I felt like a stalker...
---
Same in Sweden, and I guess that's why some Swedish companies have grown a lot lately. Great work conditions overall, happier folks and people stay.
---
i had a similar solution for eu
---
1. delete all 3 pvp servers
---
2. make 3 new fresh ones (new names)
---
3. enjoy short term outrage 
---
4. look forward to long term success
---
I am looking forward to be the fastest horse on the racing track as a Paladin.
---
I really think that Blizzard still has no clue how many people will be playing. The few available servers will be fucking swamped on release with HUGE slow moving queues.
---
Not sure if people will like it when they release new servers on day 2 or 3, because people will have chars at a decent level by then and don't want to start all over again.
---
You have to be in the top 6% of active PvP players (players with at least some HK in a given week) to advance to rank 10.
---
Let's do some math: 
---
- You need 40k ranking points (RP) for rank 10
---
- Decay per week is 20% of current total RP, so as you're closing in on rank 10 around 8k RP/week. So you need more than 8k RP gain per week to advance to rank 10. 
---
- 8k RP are gained by the top 6% of the server each weekly reset. 
---
- If you just have 8k RP gain, you'll crawl the last meters towards rank 10 though, as the delta between gain and decay becomes really low. You'll probably want to get to the next higher bracket (top 3.5%) for 9k RP per week at least for a few weeks when approaching your target rank. 
---
- How much honor you need to achieve top 3.5% will depend a lot on the server's active PvP community. An exemplary data point I found was around 120k contribution points (CP) for one week on a US server during classic. 
---
- A WSG victory without holiday rewards around 1400 CP. With a bunch of kills and turning in marks, let's assume 2.5k CP per win. 
---
- At a match duration of 15 minutes and a win rate of 50%, that would mean 24 hours per week plus queuing times. With a good premade group, win rate should be higher and average match time closer to 10 minutes, so you can probably get there with around 15 hours a week. 
---
TL;DR probably something like 10-15 hours per week if you play in a decent group and 20+ hours if you play solo.
---
Justice for Zanjin should be an RP-PVP horde guild name.

Your post has been automatically removed because you used a keyword which is reserved for the subreddit moderators.

Nothing else than Male Orc Hunter with my old name feels right.
---
Jealous!
---
Well that's probably since the list itself is based on user input - the entire purpose of the site (to my understanding) was that anyone can create an entry for an AddOn they used to play with, and then once new info arrived, you could put a status on it, whether it's being updated, not being updated, already updated, released, etc.   
---
So it's not a database of existing AddOns - it's a database of the AddOns people want - but the benefit is that they then collect information about ALL addons, and put a description of the current status of the AddOn there, as well as links to where you can download them.   
---
Hence my recommendation of filtering / sorting so you see recently updated AddOns, instead of just all :)
---
After reading this I want to tell you my story as well : 
---
I was 15 yo, I contacted the support team because my account was hacked and my main was deleted, after recovering everything he asked me if I had any other questions and of course I also asked how can I be a GM ! 
---
He told me to have a look at the blizzard website when I will be 18 and try to apply from it. 
---
Now i'm 27 and I have applied to a GM job offer two weeks ago. I already did two interviews and I'm now waiting for an answer from them. If they hire me that will be the best achievement of my life and career.
---
Wish me good luck guys, and if that interest anyone I will tell you if I succeed or not.
---
Sorry if my grammar is bad, i'm not from UK or US.
---
Literally that was my first comment ever in Reddit, what a charming welcome ! ☺️☺️☺️
---
PK was the normal term in most online games back then. Everquest, Ultima, Tibia and DAoC all used the term as far as I can remember.
---
Agreed. I would expect them to do an optional character transfer to this Classic+ server if they ever did something like this.
---
Yea but with DPS you‘re looking at a chart too, the DPS meters.
---
No, you specifically said
---
&gt; Im in a scandinavian guild(More like a swedish guild) and we chose Golemagg(horde side) so I'd say there are players all over from all over :)
---
You are saying there *are*, not that there *probably* are. And even if you did, you still base it on a sample of one. You can't say there "probably are" any more than "probably not" from that. I'm just pointing out that your logic is flawed.
---
But hey, you might of course end up being right - no one can know the future. I fully agree that of course saying "Scandinavians goes to x realm" doesn't literally mean other realms have no Scandinavians - I already said that in a previous comment. But there might be a majority on certain realms - same for other nationalities. It is common that certain realms have a larger than average number of some nationalities. That is what people mean when they say "Scandinavians will go to x realm", which is why I think your point was kind of moot. Your guild doesn't change that a certain realm will most likely have more Scandinavians than the rest, nor does it cause any logical ground to believe so.
---
But hey, we will see soon enough and regardless we will probably all have fun. I hope your guild will have a blast on Golemagg!
---
I'm calling bullshit. So this kid has parents that play as well... Its highly unlikely that they would be playing on another server or faction, yet they were able to make a character on the same realm of the opposite faction just to message you? 
---
If his mother deleted the Dad's char just to message you she'd be getting ganked irl.
---
We are close now bro. I'm so excited, the hype is real. I haven't been this excited about a game since ME3 and that was a big fail lol. So hopefully Classic is a success, and I really believe it will be. There is just so many people who want it to happen.
---
If you haven’t come to study, I’ll use you to teach a lesson.
---
Thanks for elaborating.
---
I knew the weather was bad last night, but I didn’t realize it was tornado bad...
---
They’re not adjusted for timezones though, as all the countdowns are (official ones) are based on the same number. So my understanding of the topic is not what’s the problem here. The problem is you assuming the countdowns are different on each version of worldofwarcraft.com because og timezones, which it isn’t. Just go to worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/ and worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/ and you’ll see that the countdowns are identical. That’s why I said it’s redundant to specify that it’s adjusted for timezone because the countdown is the exact same everywhere. Not counting unofficial countdowns
---
Very nice, thank you
---
Like layering but not in anyway the same. The suggestion is two seperate servers with no crossover. The only thing they share would be name reservations.
---
This, 100 times.
---
Theres a guy on mmo who is literally flaming every single comment or thread related to classic, the insecurities of some of these people amazes me, people will like what they want to like, deal with it. 
---
Personally, i havent been able to remain an active player of WoW since WOTLK despite maintaining my sub, it lost its soul (largely at the request of community feedback) and became an instant gratification game aimed at pleasing people who didnt want to put in the time an effort in, and i say this now as a 40 yr old husband with kids, i CANNOT wait for Vanilla to relaunch, time off work is booked, quests and dungeons will be smashed, and im going to fucking love it till the day it dies.
---
Please tell me OP, how is it that this kid's dad would be able to kill you on the same account they were able to talk to you on?
---
I not necessarily agree but love such comic way of starting a discussion.
---
This.
---
Robe of the Archmage is only the appetizer for the real reason to roll tailoring.
---
I don’t think it’s for you to tell me what’s for me.
---
Yeah. I just really hate how flashy tier sets are and would kill to be able to look like a proper explorer instead of a rave clown.
---
Healing threat is a bit different. The classic situation is a slightly brain afk healer throwing a quick heal on the warrior's bloodrage and get aggro on the boss and die. Healing while there are lots of mobs is also dangerous because your heals gives threat to all mobs in combat. I don't know how many times I've died on Fankriss because I healed just as the adds spawn.
---
&gt;  I'll gladly go back to smashing my head against a wall at my 9-5 until some other good mmo comes out. 
---
RIP then. AAA MMOS are a thing of the past, just like RTS. Unless Classic revitalizes the market, don't expect anything worthwhile coming out anytime soon.
---
Couldn’t agree more, I’m sure it’s going to be awesome, I’m so stoked!
---
Five seconds in
---
Goldic\*
---
There will be tons of warriors, mages, hunters, rogues, priests and the others.
---
Maybe some for nostalgia but most of the videos won't be the same.
---
Can I get a PM as well please.
---
They haven’t said anything, but it’s seeming like the free trial will not work on classic, or we would have heard by now.
---
Not glamouring it. Just stating that it’s not just in game development, and that not everyone feels like a victim working overtime as a salaried employee.
---
There isn’t a flaw. The question in mind was a hard counter for rogues. Typically an arms warrior can smash a rogue without blowing its CDs.
---
If a class is required to blow all of its CDs plus reset the fight multiple times a fight just to win... did you respond to the correct post?
---
So impale really isn't worth it even with being specced into cruelty and imp Overpower?
---
not super familiar with classic balance so i cant comment too much, but i don't like some of the stuff that quite literally changes the game too much.
---
examples: the backstab dagger, the fear on judgement libram, the -threat wand, the paralyze neck, the gold looting hood, etc. these items would pretty drastically change a lot of shit and would be some of the most sought after items in the game. i also think the pure stats on some items are just way too well allocated for vanilla in a lot of cases.
---
i really like looking at stuff like this though, even if i think there's a 95% chance classic will never expand it's still cool to look at.
---
DR exists in 1.12, but it's possible to wait out stun DR with blind-restealth-sap-sap
---
I almost never saw it on the handful of servers I played that allowed it. Even so, it's not surprising that it would be common there because creating accounts is free.
---
Germans get confused when they hear Swiss german accents and [while voice chat is sometimes super entertaining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSUnoCNKW8M) I lost faith in the average German gamer a long time ago. Hence international servers in every game I play. Most everyone I know thinks like me.
---
Plus german translations are just plain weird after decades of English movies and games.
---
I played my first round of end game as alliance on Norfdayle last year , and it was great. After being a die hard horde guy since 2006 it was high time, and I realised that being alliance isn’t bad at all.
---
Maybe my expectations were low.. Maybe alliance is great.. Who knows?
---
I know I’ll use all the information I gathered about the alliance to kill them when I roll back to the horde for classic.
---
But in this scenario it's post naxx. So no, I wouldn't.
---
Same with Poland. I'd prefer to play with Hungarians than Poles, and Hungarians prefer to play with Poles than Hungarians.
---
That's some serious eastern europe shit.
---
hahaha well drank cause why not and we were young German .. so boarderline alcoholics.

&gt;Getting to max level in EQ on a TLP takes way less time and effort than Classic is going to. Raiding on EQ is laughably less involved than even Classic WoW will be. It’s just not a harder game, imo.
---
I don't know about modern EQ1, but most people needed like 1 year(real life time) before they got to 50. Classic is crazy fast to EQ1, there's just no competition here.
---
&gt;This sentiment was popular amongst EQ players when WoW dropped but it was never really true.
---
Blizzard marketed the game to EQ1 players like that, if you remember. WoW was the casual alternative at that time. You had the choice between EQ1 and UO which were both grindy and required serious time investment to get anywhere.
---
And if you don't remember that, I recommend watching one of the "making of WoW" videos blizzard made, where they talk about all of the influences of EQ1 and its weaknesses(in their eyes).
---
&gt;Raiding on EQ is laughably less involved than even Classic WoW will be. It’s just not a harder game, imo.
---
Depends what you mean by 'harder game', it's way more grindy which is one of the big factors when talking about accessibility. It's less mechanical, but that comparison has less weight when you consider how in general MMOs are just very accessible(at least as far as PvE content is concerned).
---
Getting carried?
---
Just wanted to piggy back on the previous post and say that hunter dps doesn’t suffer until naxx and aq40. Prior to that they are fine
---
In pvp they continue to do well.
---
Lol how did you know.

LOL

I saw that Shazzrah was "claimed" as the Britiah server so joined their discord. Wasn't disappointed to see baked bean related memes and favourite biscuits being posted.

Yes they do, but it's still the worst race.

2 weeks here, I could probably take more but didn't want to draw ire from my colleagues.

With the PvP set gloves I almost always got the opener against non-Human rogues on my feral.

Only if you really like grinding mobs
---
Go for knobs and no beard....just to change things up.
---
pvp rogues are gonna go master of subtlety and have a large stealth level advantage on you as a druid, especially if they're night elves (bonus stealth level) or humans (stealth detection racial)
---
Yah, you are wrong.  I just updated my Macbook Pro from mid-2009... the video card is not compatible
---
and faerie fire
---
yes, i unironically don't want changes if going along with them aren't optional. i want to be able to fire up classic wow 10 years from now and have it still be the same game. i think if they go the classic+ route, it should be opt-in.
---
I'm sure that might be the case when their game is being developed in real time but honestly how much work really needs to be done for classic release when it's already done?
---
Fix more bugs? Well if they don't it's fine because they existed in classic so do it post release.
---
I simply fear they will instantly revert to daily gated grinds. The current devs are obsessed with Diablo/mobile game mechanics, single player mode and collectibles. Don´t want any designer that works at Blizzard to get anywhere near Vanilla WoW.
---
Unless you plan to level only in dungeons, it doesn't make a huge difference. Talking pure efficiency here (because you are interested in exp gain), you should only dungeons when you have a set group, preferably friends in voice with eachother who all have a set of quests for a given dungeon. Some good examples are wailing caverns, scarlet monastery, zul farrak and maraudon. All having either many quests or very notable rewards. You can always pug dungeon groups too, but you gotta go in with a mentality that things can and will go wrong more often than not, and it can take a long time. And adding onto that you might then lose the drop that you were after in the first place. This is all avoidable if you have a guild or friend group that you can do dungeons with.
---
Your eyes won't thank you for that
---
Damn, I thought it would have been a 2nd world country, but to hear about something like that from Sweden.
---
I have a broken hand so its not as bad, will be healed literally the day its released lmfao
---
It'll happen before honor system too, altho perhaps not as hardcore as when honor comes out.
---
Endgame is majority of the game, just like in retail. And the argument that you can enjoy it as often as you want and in whatever doses you choose to can be made for retail as well, lol. Retail is just more casual friendly in terms of available content, like gear which is much more easily obtainable in retail than it was in classic. I'm not saying that someone will have more fun in retail, its just that its much more easier, which isn't making it a better game.
---
THOSE KEYBINDINGS THOUGH!?!?!
---
Me too lol. This is the main thing I will miss from retail. I'm so non committal on a hair style.
---
Im gonna sub in sunday and keep my comp on till release, sitting in char selection screen.

Hurr durr everybody should be doing drugs, drugs are fun amirite

night elf hunter on the skywall server, never got to 60 didn't really like hunter all that much. decided to make a mage and got to 60 in like a little over a week, a no lifer at the time and playing something that was fun was great haha.
---
There will be battles, but there will be less of them.
---
*Most* people wont go out of their way to kill someone when there's no incentive.
---
Why only subbing one week before to help Blizzard? I think it'll be even better to directly sub for 6 month to show them that you have Blizzard's back no matter what and give them even more money.
---
At least do it this weekend. I don't doubt that there will be more new servers, the question is just how many.
---
What gave you the impression Sweden is a 2nd world country lol
---
Also interested :)
---
i dont think it is the last one to die out, the one that is balanced will last longest. overpop is terrible. i changed from shazz to gehennas. what i have seen happen in the past is a super big server will always have queue times, people will leave the server to avoid queue times. a huge amount of people will leave. making it maybe the second biggest one after that. trust me, as soon as the server comes out, people will realise what 1 hour of queue time means every day. they want to play for less than 2 hours, 50% of all their time on classic will be waiting. not for me, thanks!

I’ve said it before but unless you have 300 ping you aren’t getting the vanilla experience.

Slower weapons generally have higher damage per swing.
---
Word, really good point man. Big cleaves = big threat combat and the flurry of white damage and sinister strikes will be more manageable once the tank has threat will be way more manageable than a big burst out the getgo

Yea, as a rogue you gotta make sure you outlevel everybody else, so you can keep ganking low levels, right?
---
My. What a poor soul.
---
https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/blizzard.com
---
Cannot find any good site traffic statistic websites for the forums. But this is what i came up with.
---
Yeah that right there is as asinine as you are stupid. 100k players? Seriously? Gosh.
---
Yes, rogue viciously stands in the way of her charge, as documented in the combat log.
---
Seeing from the discord, Golemagg has a great community.
---
they also said that shazz will have 10k player queues at this rate (from name reserving alone, not including all the people that will create chars there on launch day)
---
And pay for a week of playtime I can't use? No thank you.
---
Go shaman bro, new times new adventures. And also Horde are awesome lol.
---
Out of curiosity did you play on Stormreaver for a guild called Nightmare Inc. later on?  Pretty sure your name is the same as a female NE fury warrior we had in the guild.
---
Day 6!
---
Well there definitely was a healthy amount of feedback around yesterdays post. I totally understand the confusion around the 5 Molten Cores thing and have updated it to make a bit more sense. I also took a suggestion from /u/DubbethTheLastest to make day 2 flow a little better as well. It really feels like this is a community project now :)
---
For today I grabbed and edited (poorly, lol MS paint) an infographic made by /u/Knugles. His original post can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bbcflv/classic_content_plan_infographic/ it's really well made!
---
I hope you enjoy!
---
That's where I'm at. I'm either recreating my very first ever OG WoW character who was a night elf male hunter or rolling a female this time...

---
This is just bullshit. Even if you make it to top 0.8% every week it will take you around 8 weeks to get R10. Top .3% (highest bracket) and it's 7 weeks. And this is obviously the earning region of people aiming for 12+ (you'll cap out at R13 after about 33 weeks). More realistic it's 10 weeks to R10 in the top 2% and 12 weeks in the top 3.5%. 
---
So 3-4 month for a determined, but casual player spending 20+ hours a week.
---
You should reconsider your friends mah man.
---
Just a small correction.  The ipod was far from new in 2007, having come out in 2001.
---
I completely get it, and don't blame you! I wish Blizz let people make toons and not have to sub, but then people might skew the data if they really weren't going to pay to play later. So I see both sides
---
It wasn't at all ass in terms of damage.  It was behind most dps specs for sure, but only marginally.  Especially since he says he went Holy in BWL which indicates that his Ret experience came from MC and before only. I bet he was one of the vast majority of Paladins who tried to dps in Lawbringer or Lightforged.  So many Paladins had no idea how to gear to do good damage (basically the same gear as Warriors), so their damage was abysmal and they thought Ret was trash.  
---
[Here is a very well done guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/htmlview?sle=true#) to the gear that Paladins should be using if they care about not being ass dps.  Very very few actually used this list in vanilla.
---
Let me guess. You actually think Milk or UHDX is good. They were never good on ele, which is why they ducked those tournies in the beta. They are just failed mages playing a super strong spec. They don't use their melee right and hide in premades for a reason. BTW they all the "good" orc eles all got exposed on the big dueling server. They don't even rank 1 eshock well cross target.
---
The  melee range is good vs casters, especially when you have a kiting enchant that frees up eshock and when used in concert with searing their pushback is crazy. Nade plus stomp solves the melee issue. 
---
**Great** rogues are beating you no matter the race if they do the expose opener, so it doesn't matter. Being able to drop the "good" ones in a couple seconds is more important. You want a racial that is really only super strong vs one class that still beats you over being stronger vs warriors and all casters.
---
Have fun with the theorycrafting. The best eles all play mages because the class is simply more twitchy, but when we want to make you look bad we would be on a tauren.  I have forgot more about the class than you will ever know. It's simply too slow to play compared to mage/rogue. 
---
**In the end all I have to say is you can exceed the orc racial with FAP. You can't mimic a second AOE stun. It's gamechanging. You also don't play against Orcs who have stun resist. You play against people who can get out of your ranged kite and ranged earthbind down.**
---
Have a nice day tryhard.
---
If only gnome druids were a thing.  Have asked blizz for years...maybe mecha-gnome transformers are our best hope.
---
Imagine being so stingy over £10
---
Not this guy):
---
Not gonna lie, most of my Frost DK’s action bars are filled with toys, pets, and mounts. I’ll be looking forward to struggling to find space for just a couple mounts and pets.
---
You can't really go wrong with it, you just go 30 points into feral for Heart of the Wild and 21 points into resto for Nature's Swiftness. Most of the talents are really straight-forward.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxhxscMdxVxsoxo
---
Those 3 points in Feral Instinct can be moved elsewhere if you want, depending on what you want to do. I'm not entirely sure if Feral Instinct is required if you're only going to be tanking dungeons.
---
Not that I'm disagreeing with you but hasn't it always been difficult to get raid groups together? I remember a lot of cancelled raid to to not enough people as long as I remember playing wow.
---
You won't be topping DPS as a hunter any way, so why not look good at least.
---
Gear is normally assigned by priority to who needs it, from my memory of classic raids the priority looks something like this:  
---
1: Hunters. Hunters roll on anything/everything   
---
2: The dude who died before the boss pull  
---
3: Retri pallies, they're only low DPS cuz of gear, tru fax!  
---
4: Dave, a friend of the masterlooter, who needs some shards from DEing  
---
If your not on this list, then you should reroll retri pally ;)  
---
It's the real one!
---
Love it - I miss Machinima.
---
Tbh the "comminity" on the active chat channels are not the people I'd be wanting to find on the server. Only so many rape/incel/trap memes I can handle
---
I am danish and I just came back from a week vacation to Spain with my GF. It was such a frustrating time when it came to communicating; at the hotel, shops and restaurants as the locals weren't able to communicate in english, must of them said "no english" even at the hotel they had to pull out Google translate. We went to Malaga which is city full of tourists as well
---
Literal history
---
&gt; It seemed like the best policy was to always be upfront about expectations, communicate, be flexible and mature.   
---
Pretty much this mate.  
---
If you're not a fan of people trying to reserve items, don't join the runs.  If people make requests, and you are the group leader then you can navigate that as you see fit.  
---
Personally, I think its easier to get a group and run through dungeons over and over than it is to say that you're reserving the most sought after item(s) that are not class specific.
---
Because it's something some guy said sometime and people sell it as gospel.
---
It's completely wrong. You simply cannot give a straight answer as to when SoR is better. SoC scales with AP, Crit and Weapondmg, SoR does not. SoR only scales with Spelldmg and Spellrank and you won't get much Spelldmg when leveling.
---
When you get Verigan's Fist on lvl 20, you can bet SoC is better, even though it's a 3.2 speed weapon, due to how strong it is. Similarly SoC gets better, when you get gear upgrades while SoR gets weaker every level until you get a rank up.
---
A rule of thumb would be faster than 3.0 pick SoR, otherwise pick SoC, but to really see, you have to math it out. SoC is 7 ppm, no matter the speed. So, hit a SoC proc, multiply that by 7 and you have SoC dpm without crits. SoR does a fixed dmg every swing, so take yor hits per minute and multiply it with your SoR dmg to get your SoR dpm. Unless SoR is ahead of SoC by at least 10%, SoC is the better choice.
---
nobody ever choke points the tower in front of frostwolf - it's just as choke pointy as the bridge, you just don't have the option of knocking people off of it. but slamming it with aoes and defending the doors is still plenty doable
---
Yep it's undead for me, that's the one thing I've known from the start. Who cares about Barrens chat, silverpine forest and Hilsbrad is going to be HUGE lol.
---
Could I get a pm too please? :)
---
Then don't raid, try raiding or wait for a good MMO to come out.
---
You only have 3 options
---
The dude is trying to explain the simplest of concepts to you bra.
---
More people queing = longer ques, not sure why that's so hard to grasp?
---
&gt; knowing about the living standards
---
*Nope.*
---
Recruiters lie through their teeth to get people to sign up. It's pretty scummy. Nobody's gonna tell a kid that he's gonna be living in substandard conditions with black-mold, insect infestations, etc. if they want to meet their quota.
---
There are a couple of criminal investigations underway in the military housing department. The commanding officer in the Army for military housing management just got fired. 
---
It's fucked up.
---
All that aside, hating on misinformed kids for signing up to get out of their podunk town because they can't even think about affording a secondary education is kinda fucked. 
---
Hate on the policy makers, commanders, etc. Don't hate on the kids.
---
It’s the classic proactive/reactive argument,
---
Female orc it is! Now what hairstyle?
---
best tip here for you: dont play on a laptop
---
Mohawk.
---
Furries are still not okay no matter how you slice it
---
i would assume it was within like 2-3 hours of the server going up no?
---
I once got feet of the lynx from my girlfriend, it got me into twinking. Best bday present ever!
---
stuck on the seventh day before the launch
---
Alright cool! Then i'll go with the aoe build, but with single target leveling at start :&gt; thanks!
---
You will be able to raid in other guilds if you have the time.
---
Just play where you feel like you should/you like the most, so your experience is as enjoyable as it can.
---
now with auto loot and good macro's you can very easily pickpocket a whole dungeon whilst watching T.V. ( i heard, i have not tested, this does interest me because i am rolling rogue)
---
To me 80% of my enjoyment was my rocket launch in a week to 60 that's why I'll be wrecking low level scrubs when I'm done.
---
I definitely agree with your point about your actions feeling more significant in 5-mans, but there's no comparable feeling in all of gaming to downing a 40-man boss you've been hard-stuck on for weeks. My guild's 1st Nefarion kill in 2005 is still etched into my memory for the sheer excitement. Ventrillo exploded.
---
Good at everything as in world pvp, battlegrounds, raid dps, 5 man dps, and solo questing, gold farming.  Very good in every way.
---
That's definitely not true even slightly
---
Our raid leader during ICC one night randomly went AFK without warning anybody.  We were calling him in Vent and pm but he didnt respond till 40 mins later with "sorry guys I walked to my friends house to make a steak".  Lordsptfire from Shattered Halls.  What a guy.

Shouldnt, but they often do, which is why healers generally dislike running with other healing classes.
---
What else is in your group? Does it have a BM hunter? Because I'm not being funny, but BM hunter pets (set to manual and properly \*controlled\*) can tank 5man dungeons relatively well (I remember tanking all of DM in a 4 people guildy group when our pickup tank left). BM pets can be pumped up to have boatloads of armor and health, and quite serious threat generation.
---
I assume from the way your post is worded that noone wants to task, but if you can share the burden between a BM pet and your shaman, that would make things a lot easier. Or even a demo warlock.
---
The bottom line is: Your group will have to work as a team. If they're willing to do their part to make your tanking easier (CC, off tanking pets, give you a headstart on threat), it'll work. If they're all in paper cannon mode, it won't. Then I wonder why you are jumping through hoops to make this happen when noone else gives a hoot.
---
I imagine the proc rate would be pretty damn low. The ring though I agree, that has tweaked. Thanks again.
---
Feign death op.
---
Me not THAT kind of Orc!
---
Exactly. People want to set goals and work towards achieving them, and WoW classic and osrs are both great games for doing that because while neither are “hard” games per say, they require more time and dedication which makes meeting those goals that much more satisfying. When everything is handed to you for minimal effort, it feels hollow and pointless.
---

What was the comment about,  farming deviate in WC?
---
Sail to barrens and then walk a bit ... in Xroads tkaer the FP to Ogrimmar and then the flight to Undercity, so doesnt take that long tbh. Or walk straight to the FP in STV even (unless PvP then it might become a long walk indeed :) )
---
 You know what would also have helped to spread players? More servers at the start.

You can choose if you or he should wear it... :P
---
Just use the scene from W3's intro cinematic where Thrall wakes up and you're good
---
How come you chose Benediction over IBoM?
---
I broke my hand from masturbating so much because im so bored waiting for classic
---
You are a right in some way. I don't expect the small shops to be able to speak in english, but at least at the hotel or at the michelin restaurant I do expect them to talk a bit of the internation language, they are apart of EU after all. I was over the moon when a salesman said "Hello, how are you" when a passed his shop, I was like "wtf they can english!?!"
---
I remember loving how casual and fun leveling in WoW was compared to the fucking slog that was leveling in EQ.
---
Streamers are not a concern in the EU.
---
There is no (detailed) timeline overall and certainly no timeline on how the population will behave. 
---
At the moment, only the RP-servers are "Medium" in population, the rest are "High" or "Full" (only talking about the English realms).
---
Blizzard will most likely add new realms closer to launch (and perhaps also after) and those would most likely be less populated.
---
you spelled rouge wrong. #nochanges
---
r/classicwowplus
---
Ok, but that doesn't really have anything to do with this conversation.
---
Until you’re old and have nobody to ever help you or even talk to, first couple years with a kid is different but it’s great
---
Hunters had quite a bit of utility against rogues, and once they were in kiting range, the rouge had very limited means to counter it. i played a hunter back when the game first launched.
---
First time there i started walking before i realised (being run over) that i could actually take a ride :)
---
So post them?
---
As someone who loves wpvp.. I love when my side is the clear minority in those scenarios. More action for me.
---
I was a diehard player and had no job back then, so it's safe to say this was one of the first pvp raids ever.  I have a few screenshots of little level 3 Hellhound on June 16th, so that's probably when the server went up.
---
Spanish! Playing on Shazzrah
---
Please tell me that's not supposed to be thrall.....
---
I agree completely, spot on. I have nothing against people who play the current game, but it’s so far removed from offering a world experience that I could easily put Halo 2 into my old Xbox and get more or less the same experience. It’s a high octane competitive marvel that tries to find a mode for literally every single kind of gamer. 
---
But Classic is an entire world that works like one, more than most other open world games. There are easier aspects and harder aspects, and maybe not everyone will get to do everything. I plan on killing Kel Thuzad, but I’m not sure that I will. It’s a foreboding element of the game I still have never done, after playing much of Classic, and that’s a good thing.
---
You lazy peace of Shit. It’s fine. I typed in avoid streamers and found 30 posts giving the exact same answer. I will destroy you.
---
I'm just glad I got to experience the old AV. Boy did I play a lot of it! I wasn't bothered I had to log out when it wasn't close to winning, but helping to progress it forward.
---
Ich bin Mister T und ich spiele einen Nachtelf Irokese.
---
https://youtu.be/4jhbEe0O_Kk
---
Start with the basic stuff :D
---
Very true, i dont expect there to be nearly as much now that they pay for it.
---
&gt; People forget although all 3 were designed to do both
---
I know that very well, I loved tanking 5s with unholy for some fun. However blood was just the best tank spec, specially as MT.
---
Looking at the talents, frost didn't have such insane tanking talents at all, the best ones were in the early rows (like ret's parry, doesnt make ret a tanking spec). So many people went frost tank in early wotlk cos of the amount of 1h tanking weapons, so they thought 2x 1h tank weapons &gt; 2h agi or str dps weapon, and so frost DW &gt; blood 2h, for some reason.
---
Frost tank was a huge noob bait (cos DW) early on, people figured it over time. Said that, all the 3 specs could do both DPS and tank on a viable level, but blood was the optimal tanking spec.
---
Preach
---
Just be careful, the worst thing would be to plan it like this, just to have the service go down! I think that all the people that havent created their chars yet will do it just like this!
---
just follow the yellow brick road ....
---
Just google "Wow Classic" &gt; First link &gt;  Access  to WoW Classic is included in and available to all players with an  active World of Warcraft subscription—no additional purchase required. 
---
[https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/wowclassic](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/wowclassic)
---
Ok, that was hard to find !
---
From a gameplay perspective it made sense as it was massively inconvenient for a lot of players.  Especially mages, they simply could not be anything but frost with evocation if they wanted to raid MC/BWL/Ony as everything was immune or resistant to fire.
---
Tho I do think it was stupid they did but it makes shit way easier in the long run.
---
i was just the opposite, levelled my priest as fast as i could to 60 to get to raiding. This time im gonna enjoy the journey for sure.
---
There are still people who click their skills and cant cooperate with other people. Being able to play together with other people was the gatekeeper in vanilla - not mechanics. It’s likely going to be the gatekeeper in classic too. 
---
I take it that your guild just flew through Naxx up until four horsemen then? Since it wasn’t challenging at all?
---
Ricardo better man the fuck up and step up to the plate (UD Mage)
---
Yes, they will obviously have more than 2 times active retail accounts. Expansion launches have usually more than 5 times the current active population, and I wager classic launch will be at least in the same ballpark.
---
The real best way to reserve loot is take only classes that won't compete with your gear. (Obviously this only applies to tanks, which are the only people I've ever seen reserve loot)
---
Just take a priest, mage, warlock, and double down on one of em.
---
Make one toon on a seever with friend and then make toons with brother on a diff server, unless the first server isnt pvp then make them all on the one :)
---
**&lt;Senile Chieftains&gt;** | EU Pvp Shazzrah Server, Horde | Casual pve raiding guild     
---
**Introduction**    
---
"Senile Chieftains" is made for people who would like to see all the classic raid content (again), but are not able or willing to spend 8 nights a week playing. Of our 4 raids that we will run every week, we only expect you to attend 1. There are options available for people who would like to raid multiple days.    
---
Senile Chieftains is made by ex raiders who have grown to old to raid to many evenings a week. Back in vanilla we cleared aq40 until the 'twin emperors', but because of the "tbc" release the guild disbanded.  One of our officers has all the tbc server first under his belt up to kil'jaeden. So you can expect a mature and experienced raid environment   
---
**Expectations from members**   
---
We are looking for experienced and skilled players to realize our goal of clearing all classics raid content. New players are also welcome, but keep in mind that most of our players are now 30 years and older so we will have a more mature guild environment.      
---
**Raid information**   
---
Raiding days will be Mon-Thur 20:00 - 23:00 (server time). Once available, we will run organized raids on off days for lower tier content for alts and those who want to complete their tier/bis sets. Loot will be distributed by a loot council aided by a hidden dkp system.   
---
Check [https://www.senilechieftains.com/](https://www.senilechieftains.com/) for more information!
---
This always baffled me when you see those clips of people whose house just get torn to shreds by a tornado and all they say is "oh well, guess we'll rebuild it.". How about you move away from there? Is that region really so important to you that you want to lose your house or even more to a tornado that comes by every so often?
---
Are righteous might and dread coming back?
---
NE hunters are arguably the strongest flag defenders in arathi so they're still pretty good in bgs
---
Which a lot of us skipped because we aren't subbed currently. My name is kinda unique and never seen someone to take it.
---
Get him "The World of Warcraft Diary" by John Staats. He'll love it.
---
Pretty much the best book out there on the topic of the development of vanilla WoW, written by a former dev.
---
No Spanish? :( Que
---
Hahaha ouch! Must be the hair.
---
Full servers back in the days were 10k characters~, they say medium today is more than full in vanilla, so reserved names for characters from just name reservation is close to or over 100k in NA/EU alone, and a majority of everyone I've talked to with a guilds of 50+ ppl, just a few actually subbed to save a name.
---
WoW Classic will without a doubt reach the higher 100s of thousands during release. A million might be a hard bet though, but wouldn't surprise me.
---
It IS and WAS the best MMO-game ever released and it did peak around 7 million players and kept growing in TBC, until they decided to ruin the RPG-elements in WLK and it started to fall.
---
During WoWs lifetime there have been a lot more than 100 million players, so if only 1% of them wanna try WoW Classic, that's 1 million right there.
---
&gt; My whole question with this is why did they let this happen in the first place?
---
well they didn't really
---
they made three east coast pvp servers, and then two of them got claimed by undesirable crowds
---
* one for the streamers under the sky  
---
* one for the br-lords in their halls of hue  
---
* and one for everyone else
---
turns out the number of people who don't want to play with toxic streamer communities or toxic br communities is way larger than the number of people who do, and there was only one server available for those people (herod), which is why it's overpopulated
---
Oh really? That does change things.
---
[These](https://www.amazon.com/Attends-Advanced-Dry-Lock-Technology-Incontinence/dp/B0142US226/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=adult%2Bdiapers&amp;qid=1566218027&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-3&amp;th=1) may come in handy for the first week of leveling. Or afterwards.
---
That‘s literally what everybody means when they say overpopulated. Don‘t be a smartass
---
Dont remimd me haha, i used to play on one...
---
Thanks a lot :)
---
No, SoC is 7ppm, no matter the speed. The chance to proc is adjsuted so it always evens out to 7 ppm.
---
*With a 2.0 weapon, you hit 30 times per minute, so the proc chance is 7/30 is 23.33%
---
* With a 3.0 weapon, you hit 20 times, so the chance is 35%
---
* With a 4.0 weapon, you hit 15 times, so 46.67%
---
This makes SoC much more powerful with slower weapons. Objectively SoC dmg is based on weapon dmg, so with a 4.0 weapon a SoC proc deals twice as much dmg as with a 2.0 weapon of the same dps. It's also subjectively better, because a 40% proc chance feels better than 25%, espeically with the bigger numbers.
---
And me please
---
Some dude posted a screen shot from the developers diary that laid out the first ever recorded gank and camp. It was pre-alpha and it was blizz on blizz. Looked like an interesting read.
---
What's happening on the longer right bar? Looks like it's 3 seals to start off. Am I missing something?
---
Woosh.
---
Depends on what your goals are.
---
Oof, that's going to be a hard sell to randoms. Then again like any other offspec, just find a good group of people and it'll be fine.
---
Third party apps to download addons? #NoChanges!!!!!
---
Having a hoot means having a good time. Sorry for the slang!
---
EU?
---
Are you Spanish or were you part of The Freak Circus? :)
---
I was just curious im not german and not going to play there
---
!remindme 298 days
---
"The fullest pvp-server that doesn't have a queue" would be my approach.
---
You have to assume that they did.
---
Maybe, just maybe they are in possesion of more data to base their decisions on than you. Just maybe..
---
Made my char in cataclysm and did only up to MOP. Left for FFXIV at that point (because it killed my reroll madness).
---
But I'll play Alliance, because the alliance has the best zones in the game, the tramway, the mage district in Stormwind, actual best taverns in the game, best towns (Auberdine, Theramore, Lakeshire, Thelsamar, Astranaar..)
---
The only thing I miss from the horde is the access to Mulgore pure plains, Tauren's capitals, and their outpost in the Charred Vale. 
---
Else Horde is ugly. I get why Alliance try to get rid of them, they can't seem to learn anything from beautiful architecture. Why the heck Sylvanas doesn't restore Lordearon is beyond of me. Even if they're undead, they have a normal (human) mind, they just group up because the alliance want them dead. Tauren just goes with their tent in the outside world. I would die to have just some wooden shop from them like in their capital outside. Orcs only knows how to do war buildings, and trolls.. Erm, nice try guys.
---
I usually get IBoM just to have better buffs for dungeons/random people. Usually using wisdom as I level. Think it's mainly preference
---
Too many syllables
---
The increased threat is great if you plan on tanking in groups.
---
The dungeon 2 set is a great way aswell to keep doing dungeons :)
---
&gt; Full servers back in the days were 10k characters~
---
Not concurrent, concurrent back in the day was around 3k total logged in.

I leveled Hunter, Pally, Warrior, Mage ro 60 and I honestly never really thought about something being extremely harder then other.. You ease into the playstyle of each class and wupti one day you hit 60 :P

---
Thanks for the detail reply mate :)!   
---
very much appreciated - sounds like a ton of fun as hunter :D
---
except if you just decide "welp this server is full, *lock*"
---
you fuck over all the people who haven't rolled on that server to join their friends, their guilds, etc etc who are already dead set on being on herod
---
Just memory and that was the reason that Hemo Spec wasn't a "viable" raid spec cause the Gift of Arthas Debuff didn't stack with Hemo. You probably won't get gkicked over runing Hemo Spec, but if there are 10 rogues looking to raid MC in Phase 1 you will need to be a really active and enthusiastic player to get a spot over a combat rogue based solely on dps potential.
---
So endlessly reroll forever?

How many syllables in “Oil”
---
well yeah, thats what I thought
---
You didn't consider normalized attack speeds
---
Well, it depends how easy its to get to work. No point in getting critted on, if you get 10% procs off it. But if you can do it like 50% of the time, then it could be worth it.

---
It didn't happen, he said 2017 then corrected to 2007. That just shows he's making shit up cause guess what, TBC was out January 2007.
---
Yes. God forbid the people comitting to raiding, preparing with consumables, and putting in hours of organizing their raid team every week should get better rewards than people logging in to do world quests right?
---
No wonder retail has turned to crap with this mindset.
---
I'm sold. Classic improved is my new dream.
---
Arenas and Barbershops and little else.
---
Please don't hurt me Internet.
---
Good lord, so tempting..
---
His entire point around using Innervate on a druid revolved around a specific spec that allows druids to outheal the other healing classes, but which uses a lot of mana - hence the mention that in this specific scenario, the druid should use his Innervate on himself. It is kinda implied that in any other scenario, the innervate goes to other healers (priests due to spirit), as they can dish out more healing.
---
then go flush it down the toilet... why being so stingy?
---
5 and there’s brackets that only allow a certain amount of people to promote in any given week (more players = bigger bracket) you also decay weekly.
---
Since there's only a single realm of each type (PvP/PvE) it's a safe bet that they'll be pretty well balanced.
---
Pick the faction you prefer, don't worry about balance. There will definitely be large active communities on both sides.
---
Flex your abs, get a workout in too. Work that core for the long hours sitting next week.
---
I’m having a hard time understanding this map. (I’ve never fished)
---
The renew talent is one of the worst talents in the game.
---
It only increases the BASE healing. It's worthless.
---
If you’re a class that is different than the reserver, you still have an issue. For example, if you’re a caster and join a dal rends reserved UBRS. I guarantee you’ll have more caster dps rolling on the Jeb trinket because less melee will want to join.
---
You know that there is more than 1mil names reserved already on all regions together? It was in a blue post, i can later try to find it again. That means 300k+ actual people are subbed to only have their names reserved (including retail players). 
---
Its hard to estimate how many are subbed only for the names, could even be the minority. This would mean complete chaos on launch when the servers are already full.
---
It will be very interesting if blizzard can handle it.
---
I don't think that applies to a stupid and obscure reference
---
There you go, pal https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSKhcR57Lpsk4YIEWO-u-88xEXoZo2rT6mF9gl27ctRpcOlg/viewanalytics
---
I have never seen anyone pet battle during a raid lol
---
Was that a case of the world being so big, or a case of Blizzard having too many servers with lower populations, as people left? It might be both.  
---
Azeroth is big enough without flying mounts or riding at level 20, the world feels a lot bigger.
---
A real undead rogue would have told the mom to consider an ultra late term abortion because her son is cripplingly retarded, then blocked her and screenshot it for the fap folder.
---
gay squad
---
Mmm hot. This gets my bobber all wet.
---
More realms, yay! I'm curious though, have they mentioned at all what the maximum number of players is per realm before a login queue takes effect? Like how many people can be in one realm at one time? What causes them issues that they need a cap in place?
---
Probably shazzrah or golemagg if you wanna play on a regular PvP server. Gehennas has been declared as the hardcore server.
---
I only got my first iPod Mini (and only iPod ever) at the ass end of 2006. They we're still very rare in my high school. I only knew a handful of people with decent MP3 players that had more than 64MB at that point.
---
And I was 11 when I started playing Ultima Online. Which was far worse for a developing psyche. The first time I was stolen from I actually cried for awhile. Then I learned that I had to do that to other people before they did it to me. There is at least some kind of cooperation in WoW. In UO, the name of the game is "be more deceptive than the other unfortunate motherfucker because no one will ever help you."
---
&gt;A resourceful player will be able to overcome all the situations you mentioned.
---
I agree that knowledge and planning should be considered a skill in the context of difficulty, but this statement is just blatantly false. You can be the most resourceful player in the game, but if you don't have the mechanical skill for a truly difficult encounter you will never beat it.
---
Surveys for Arugal specifically? I wish Blizz would just give us the data.
---
Imagine thinking you have the right to judge somebody else for it. Imagine making a fucking post on reddit telling people to pay money for something they don't want.

Fucking imagine.

ibom is a really, really bad talent.
---
Let's say you are lvl 22. BoM adds 55 AP, ibom improves it by 20%, that's 11 AP, not even 1 dps. So, msot people will get 1-2 more white dmg per hit from those 5 talent points you spent.
---
Benediction, well Rank 1 SoC costs 65 Mana, Benediction saves you 10 Mana there, judgement is 27 Mana, Benediction saves you another 4 Mana here. That's 14 mana saved every 8sec or 8.75mp5.
---
What's worth more 11 AP or 8.75 mp5? 
---
Ibom is soemthing, you sohuld only consider when leveling, if you run a melee cleave dungeon group.
---
Must be their raid leader.
---
It's funny you even thought you had to give a reason at first.  
---
Here, you just ask / arrange with your boss "hey, I would like to take my time off from X to Y" "Ok / not OK"  
---
Never have I had to justify anything to a boss lol.
---
(Spanish) No.
---
LOL cry about it

Yours was better lol
---
Personally I look at spending money on games like this: 
---
If I can an hour of fun for each dollar spent on a game or subscription, its 100% wurf!
---
Strawman alert
---
I am interested to hear what you base that on, where/when was this declaration made?
---
/r/woosh
---
I pity the male night elf's selection. Poor bastards.
---
Did not take time off, but my current contract is running out on the 5th of September and I don't take a new one before a month, that's for sure lol.
---
Don't need to spec in missiles. :) The frostbolt on the pull let's you get off a full missile rotation then you finish with the wand while regenning mana. You pretty much use no mana and can just keep chain pulling.
---
This is when aoe leveling gets really good. Around 22. Can finish off frostbolt later.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/--0230023012
---
You take the resist talents because if a nova misses the entire pull is screwed before you get cone of cold, which let's you run around until nova is up again and not have to run away, reset and have another mage possibly steal the pull.
---
just keep layering then
---
All I hear is wahhh I didnt get the joke

Good thing there is a sub dedicated to retail then

They have everything done from previous launches and are on holidays. The release date being end of summer it's no coincidence, the team will show up in the office 2-3 days in advance.
---
Source: cousin Larry works in there.

Story time. Back at the end of vanilla, before TBC launched, my best friend asked me if I had heard about that game and he was planning on playing it. I had someone in my class back then who had purchased the game and it came with a 7 day trial code I believe. I told my best pal and we went out on an adventure together.  
---
We both started in Valley Of Trials (Not sure what we played in our trial although one of us was a warlock) and we went onwards questing. After some hours we came close to the river seperating durotar from the barrens. My most vivid memory was of me and my friend noticing giraffes and zebras being level 15-17 while we were only level 10-11ish. We went straight at them trying to kill them and died over and over again (we were total noobs) until in the end we managed to kill one that was level 15..that was some joy we had and a moment I will never forget :D
---
Fights for a paladin usually only last two judgements. Having you start with judging crusader will cause that fight to last three judgments.
---
Crusader only make sense if you're fighting something that's going to take more than two judgements to kill, such as soloing an elite or fighting a boss in a dungeon.
---
My brother is my best friend essentially so yeah you are probably right
---
Any oldish laptop with a dedicated graphics card should run wow just fine, so depending on how much you plan on playing, that could actually be the cheaper route. Hell, it might even be playable on a newish integrated grapchis.
---
I am so hyped right now!  Thank you.
---
We had a new guy run up and speak to major domo just as soon as we got into Ragnaros’ lair. Great mixture of angry screaming and hysterical laughter.
---
Timezones.
---
I know of a 73 year old who can't wait to ditch BfA and come back.
---
In which case I’ll still have my money and you guys will have paid for even more non-playtime. I look forward them to extending subs just like vanilla!
---
Ale &amp; Ricardo need to be the token Orc &amp; Tauren.
---
There is no "sounding" like 1 syllable when it's 2 lol, maybe you pronounce it completely different to be 1 (like lair) but Layer is still 2 syllables
---
That rogue wanted all the smoke
---
You can buy gear, but only do it in very few cases - for example if you haven't got a good weapon drop for many levels straight. Then you might consider investing in a weapon on the Auction House (player trades) to speed up your lvling process.
---
Other than that, a few addons might be helpful. At least fiddle around with some settings, for example instant quest text. The default is a slow paced writing of the quest text. 
---
Anyway.. This hold true imo:
---
&gt; Go in blind, id pay money to experience this game blind again
---
Very welcome, I forgot to mention how easy it is to gear due to ranged hit chance and no glancing, dodge or parry on attacks. That and rogues can’t will on mail. Also rok’Dalar quest is the most rewarding feeling in the game. Those demons are some dark souls level of hard where you have to play in unconventional ways to truest test your hunter prowess.
---
Why do people make separate threads for this? I don't get it.
---
You people are insane.
---
What’s br-lords. I tried to avoid the streamer server but i wasn’t tracking that there’s another group to watch out for.
---
probably at least 50 after the first month, just going by how it's been with retail for the last 3 expansions
---
Still no Spanish realm and they want people to leave Shazzrah ffs
---
The earth is round. It opens everywhere, at the exact same time.
---
Work required me to take my summer time off during summer, not near the very end of it. Sadly I did not have a "classic summer" since blizz can't tell time but whatever. Maybe it's for the best since I probably would have used my entire pto for the year and I'd have nothing left for december and spring.
---
I agree. I was 13-14 when I joined wow. I was terribly inefficient and it took me for-fucking-ever to hit 60. This time around I know what to expect more than I did 12 or so years ago. 
---
Even though I’ll be levelling as Ret.
---
**&lt;GetOffMyLawn&gt;**
---
**Alliance/Stalagg**
---
Play time: Tues/Thurs/Fri/Sat 7 PM to 9:30 PM (EST)
---
Get Off My Lawn is a super casual guild for the old (30+) and the weary.  Those who only have a few hours to play, for 4 or so days a week.  The goal is primarily social and having people to play with on a semi-consistent schedule.  Raiding and such will be worries after we hit 60, long after everybody else.

What? It is wildly unbalanced. Yes everything g has clearly defined strengths and weaknesses but the depth of those strengths and weaknesses is way out of whack.
---
Before Posting a comment as a moderator, kindly take a look to your rules a few inches that way -------&gt;
---
It releases at the same time in the eighth and NA, yes. Because of timezones, it will be 26th in North America, and the 27th in EU.
---
Personally I too would’ve liked server only bgs for a while to start with to build server pride, but as numbers dwindle, cross server is the way forward to keep queues popping.
---
Should we send canned goods, then?
---
Thanks!  Looking through the *early* beta screenshots brought back some memories.  Back when the horde wasn't playable, the level cap was 25, and that time I cried after I spent an insurmountable amount of time saving up for a mount and spending my life savings on it, only to immediately sell it back to the vendor the moment I purchased it.  But I don't like to talk about that.
---
I think the economy will be trash for the first couple of months. Anything that is put up on the AH will most likely sell for dead cheap or just won’t sell because no one has any money. 
---
This will get flipped around when new items come in with the first patch. Everyone will have had time to get their own gear and then will be saving all the gold to buy whatever comes next. This is when stuff is going to sell for stupid prices and it will be worth selling on the AH.
---
Take a look at what happened to the Runescape economy when summoning was realised, the prices for the materials needed for the skill sky rocketed and people made a bomb. This was only able to happen because people had years of gold saved up and could blow it on inflated stock.
---
This is me just guessing so take it with a pinch of salt.
---
Oh! Brings back so many memories, thank you very much, kind Sir!
---
So basically you enjoy bullying people? Because you love making people cry.
---
Can you be more specific with your second paragraph? I can't remember a single thing that "improved" the game other than ruining I with dungeon finder, flying mounts and making each class completely the same.
---
Did you play during the stress test? I have played the \*\*\*\* out of vanilla, and know a lot about it. I had the same fear as you.. that I would be bored. But I spent at least 20 hours in the stress test just for my character to be deleted. And it was a blast.
---
I'm not the author, nor have I committed any code to the project. Just a friendly messenger 👍
---
No problem! There is a ton of misinformation being spread in these simple question threads so I'd take everything you're told with a grain of salt. :)
---
Finally a real answer. Thank you.
---
Thanks mate.
---
Hope you play horde so I can play alongside with you, otherwise, see you on the battlefield.
---
:) Can't wait!
---
Ookin Dooker!
---
I think a large portion of the population will be above 25....
---
I agree totally though I know we all have our own playing styles and other people will enjoy the game in their own way. For myself Ive always put it down to being an old school gamer. There was a time when the internet and I guess games weren't up to the massive multiplayer experience. The focus was more on playing through a game and enjoying the experience where as I feel now that many games have less focus on the 'play through' as its just a rush to end game so you can win. I intend to get to 60 but Im going to quest and fish and cook and pick those herbs along the way.
---
My biggest gripe with hunters is the ratio of the population to raid spots. They’re one of the more highly populated classes , with one of the fewest raid spots available. This caused a huge issue for me in vanilla when I was progressed through aq40, but needed to find a new guild, and the only ones recruiting hunters were still stuck in molten core.
---
My 2 cents coming from a former hardcore hunter raider in vanilla
---

As if everyone is ignorant. Like I said... there's always an asshole.
---
Good story, poor kid... or like calvins dad would say... lucky him, world pvp builds character!
---
They can’t fire you if you never show up
---
I just don't really have any interest in world PvP and I'd rather not have the risk of getting killed by another player while I play.
---
WOW kid you just got R/WOOOOOOSHED!!!! 😂😂👀 
---
"Wooosh" means you didn't get the joke, as in the sound made when the joke "woooshes" over your head. I bet you're too stupid to get it, IDIOT!! 😤😤😂 
---
My joke was so thoughtfully crafted and took me a total of 3 minutes, you SHOULD be laughing. 🤬 What's that? My joke is bad? I think that's just because you failed. I outsmarted you, nitwit.🤭 
---
In conclusion, I am posting this to the community known as "R/Wooooosh" to claim my internet points in your embarrassment 😏. Imbecile. The Germans refer to this action as "Schadenfreude," which means "harm-joy" 😬😲. WOW! 🤪 Another reference I had to explain to you. 🤦‍♂️🤭 I am going to cease this conversation for I do not converse with simple minded persons.😏😂
---
Yeah for sure. The Azerite grind sucks because it’s endless, the benefit of each level is an almost invisible power increase, the grind itself is not challenging, and you only do it because more powerful stuff is locked behind it. It’s essentially the worst of all worlds. I guess I should’ve been more specific initially - grinding for worthwhile rewards and finally achieving it is the best part of the game.
---
Thats 50% more than the required VRAM so you should be fine. Also Im able to run classic at 30fps on my $200 tablet from 2016 so you should be completly fine!
---
Skarms guild tbh seems like it would be a decent guild. Meme specs and all. If i wasnt oce i would app
---
This shows exactly why doing that would objectively have been stupid.
---
Everyone has their own idea of QoL or "improvements", but your improvement could ruin the game for someone else. Many people hate what Arena brings. It brought about a whole new way of balancing that was very anti-vanilla. Some like that, some hate it. Same for things like barbershop and transmog - many people would love those, but on the other hand it ruins all accomplishment shown by gear. Many would hate it. Sure barbershop is less than transmog, but personally I'd prefer not having it. I like that I get to know the look of peoples toons and I can remember them without them changing every week.
---
Just because you might think "oh, but this can't *possibly* be bad for anyone" doesn't mean it's true. And even if it is so minor that only the diehard #nochanges would have a problem, then why exactly should the change be made? That means it's so minor it won't change much for you either but it will compromise the whole philosophy of recreating vanilla as it was.
---
So what do you do when everyone and their mother has a new idea of what would be an "improvement", yet there are always people saying those improvements would ruin it for them? You stick to what was originally intended - remaking a game as it was. That's why no matter how brilliant you think you idea is, it would be a bad idea to implement.
---
Go with your brother
---
Yeah I understand. But all that matters in the song is how it sounds. And if you can make it sound like 1 syllable, then “5 LAYER SHARDING” sounds more like “5 GOLDEN RINGS” than “5 CORE HOUND PACKS” does.
---
Agree. The absolute last thing we need is yet another video on the top 5/10 addons.
---
More armor is nice, but AFAIK thick hide is 10% of base armor, not 10% multiplicative.
---
The population caps are higher, but not high enough for the demand in this case. The long queues are due to the high demand this server has seen and if they had lower vanilla level population caps all that would have achieved is even longer queues.
---
So there was a typo and then he misremembered a date from 13 years ago. Boo hoo. It's a fun post, try enjoying it rather than just pulling it down for no reason.

I agree

You literally have a socialist guild and you’re calling this political? Really?

And 9 hours

He's going to spend it next week anyway. Hyperbole much?
---
Didn't know there were so many lefty faggots here.  Just because you're a Euro poor or a left faggot, doesn't mean you can get mad at this.  Making a list of accounts to hack later on, you lefties are truly a scourge that needs to be eradicated.  Worthless pieces of shit scum who contribute ZERO to society.  You will be killed, and I will laugh.

Ew
---
Never considered doing every level-appropriate dungeon.  I like that

the twitch client (which is the old curse client) is now pretty much up-to-date with addon and the ease of installing/updating is a plus for me.

I booked a week off a few months ago, Then fractured my arm and had to take 6 weeks off work to heal. Felt a bit bad coming back to work last week only to be taking another week off so soon, but my boss didn't seem to care. Nobodies cared to ask why I'm taking it off.
---
Classic WoW Hype dude! Amazing!!!
---
"Looks at the druid community"  I kinda like it there.  People asking questions, answering them, hyping each other for the launch, etc.  
---
It's like saying "I enjoy reading mmo champion forums" then someone stating "the official wow forums are a cesspool why would you want to go to mmo?"
---
The germans are shitposting on the forum, they are livid they didn't get a RP server. I just hope we don't get a PvP server faction imbalance where both servers are 20/80 with one Alliance and the other Horde. There is a good chance this could happen if Blizzard tries to stay at only 2 servers, but with the removal of layering in Phase two they have to open a bunch of new servers to combat overcrowding, so we will see.
---
Let him... it helps build character!

He did do everything wrong. Every decision he made always made things worse.
---
Made garrosh warchief
---
Waited until he fucked the Vale to go back and overthrow him
---
Never once tried to help or guide gsrrosh or give him counsel even after cataclysm when he was totally free
---
Didn't say a damn thing when sylvanas was made warchief
---
Didn't say a damn thing when sylvanas literally restarted the one war he spent most of his life avoiding or trying to end
---
Had to be dragged kicking and screaming back to the same PLANET when sylvanas tried to assassinate him for REASONS
---
Looks great, all I would add is dungeon/raid locations...minor FP's would be crazy looking lol.

**Pantheon** | NA PvP | Horde | Herod | Dedicated Raiding
---
**About Us:**
---
Pantheon is a Horde guild that will be forming on a PvP server when WoW Classic goes live on August 27th, 2019. The core of our guild is a group of friends that have been playing MMO’s and various other games together since the early 2000’s. We’re looking for mature raiders that are willing to progress through all the content WoW Classic has to offer. Our primary focus will be on PvE/raiding, but if you’re mostly interested in PvP, there will be officers heavily involved in that as well.
---
**Raid Times:**
---
Tuesday/Wednesday/Sunday - 8:30-11:30 EST (This is still being discussed)
---
We will be running dungeons, attunement chains, and any other quests to help everyone get pre-raid best in slot prior to raiding.
---
**Loot:**
---
We will be using a loot council system for raid gear that drops. In our opinion, loot council is the best way to gear a guild for progression through every raid tier. The loot council will contain the GM and all class officers. We will be using the following priority: Tanks -&gt; DPS/Heals. Please understand that you will not get gear every run; however, if you’re consistently raiding with the guild, you will be rewarded gear to help with our progression.
---
**Needs:** We have a solid core of 3 tanks and 5 healers. We're going to need DPS and a few more healers to complete our core group. Current roster sits at around 25. We plan on recruiting heavily once the game launches.
---
**Contact:**
---
[https://discord.gg/tkXeudP](https://discord.gg/tkXeudP) \- There's a guild app in our discord. Post a message and we can talk - I'll be active all day today.
---
&gt;"Hope you enjoy healing"
---
That's... why i'm here.

Questie, Atlas Loot, Track Resources, Weapon Swing Timer, AUX, Damage Meter.....idk
---
Hello! We are &lt;Blood Inc&gt;.
---
We are an old Alliance raiding guild from vanilla who have reformed for classic!
---
To begin with we are very much a social and questing guild with no requirements or commitments, just come and play with us! 
---
We currently have space for all classes and invite both casual players and raiders. Once we've levelled and started to get the itch for raiding, a raid team will be formed. We will discuss rules, times and loot systems within the guild once everyone has gotten to know each other. 
---
If you decide to be a part of the guild all we want from you is a mature attitude, a desire to have fun and to get on with your guild mates.
---
If you'd like to join, just come into our discord and say Hello! Thanks and see you in server!
---
Discord: https://discord.gg/wxRA9py
---
It wasn;t a typo, he was fixed on a bullshit date. It's a made up story from "vanilla" it's not the first one here , it's full of them
---
I'm still not sure day 2 scans properly.  In the original it's 'two tur-tle doves' (1,2,1 syllables) but yours is 'two fac-tions clash-ing' (1,2,2 syllables).  Maybe just '2 Factions Clash'?
---
Love the concept though!
---
If you think normal raids and mythic+ 1-9 are impossible to fail on (which I disagree, there are casual guilds that take a few weeks to a month to get through normal raids), you're in for a rude awakening in vanilla. 
---
Normal raids in retail are harder than vanilla raids.
---
&gt; The best part of classic was learning, the journey to 60 and not just end game. Why do you think they made expansions? To continue your journey of learning and to give end game players fresh content.
---
Hard to learn in a 15 year old game.
---
Thats just one of the modern things that will be around this time. "go back to your roots" you want people to use ventrilo too? its obvious wow classic wont be the same as it was in 2004-2006. im not in those discords but it has helped people find old guild mates and friends too, you just forgot to mention that.
---
Oh yeah those new players on p6.
---
The only reason to run old content is bindings. No one gives a shit about bwl or aq 4 months into p6
---
1945
---
This is the only real solu6that I can see. Especially with the number of guilds that have already been recruiting and have picked a server. If those guilds decide to move, not every player is going to want to do that within the guild, thus making a lot of the recruitment guilds had done to this point useless. 
---
I think we will see free transfers offered after phase 1 if things don't sort themselves out. Let people complain about the 10,000+ queues and let then decide for themselves that they want to move. Only way I see it working out.
---
I did misunderstand, apologies. I still don't entirely agree with that specific sentiment, but i do get where you're coming from, re the gear thing.
---
The isolation thing also makes more sense now. On one hand i can agree, on the other i think it's only natural. The game encourages meeting new people to form that clique with more than it keeps you from stepping outside of it though, which is a far cry from the way retail is currently structured (where the game actively discourages both).
---
Yeah, I thought I knew my hairstyle but I changed mine to one that doesnt clip as much and still looks good.
---
What I lack in brain power I make up for in ability
---
I hope you're not over the age of 14
---
It's by far the most played class. It can't be that bad.

---
You can earn 20k XP/hr just grinding Thunderheads south of Camp T for Thunder Lizard Tails, as an example.
---
If you're patient and have an actual healer, you can do most dungeons with a hunter or warlock pet as your tank. Any healing class just needs to carry int gear to heal a dungeon, and any spec warrior just needs a shield.
---
Going slow and making smart pulls (using cc and line of sight) are the most important factors. A sloppy group of main-specs will wipe more than a smart group of off-specs.
---
What your basicly saying is that og classic was still designed around both [playing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(activity)) and [gaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game)? 
---
As time has gone and people have grown, playing has died out I guess. 
---
Classic is just us trying to go to neverland.
---
 \#LostBoys.
---
I love how folks who obviously have never had anything to do with the military are commenting like they have a clue how anything works.
---
Looking for a late night raiding guild \[Alliance\] on Herod or Stalagg starting around 1030-11 EST. 
---
Seems like most most sane people moved to Fairbanks/whitemane for late night gaming, however RL friends are all east coasters, so I 'm stuck on est servers because they’re afraid of higher pings.. Will I be screwed in the raiding scene?
---
Well if we're gonna cheat, might as well just take the Zeppelin from Grom'gol ;)
---
wth how did the last guy in the party have the name like that with 2 capital letters? "WarPenguin" :O
---
Ppl hate on apple but my mid 2014 MacBook Pro still runs in mint condition and can play wow. That said I have a pc now and can never go back to gaming on a laptop
---
Yea that's amazing. I'm glad I asked.
---
There are a lot of threads speculating/suggesting the faction war should end in retail and factions should be removed. Not even kidding.
---
Thank you for the reply \^\^
---
I plan to play my Druid with my friend who will be a Warrior. Will that build still let me help in dungeons? I'm scared of not being able to keep up as I heard dungeons are a lot harder.
---
It might work better equipped.
---
*runs away*
---
If you enjoy the support-ey playstyle in other mmos, mobas, or similar genres: probably, yes.
---
On the other hand, if you don't, then healing in vanilla has very little redeeming factors.
---
Thanks! Guess I better make sure I’m not fresh meat :3
---
&gt; And while Spanish speakers aren't the best players in my experience, they are usually chill and not atagonistic
---
my raiding guild in tbc had our main tank quit ("i feel like playing my hunter more") and were rescued by a 3-pack of free transfer refugees from peru. they were in a 10-man guild on their old server and had tons of gear from ZA, which made our progression into tier 5 a breeze, and my co-gm/raid leader was miami cuban so there was no real language barrier
---
latin american players (other than BR) are a pleasure to play with as long as you have someone who speaks spanish to interact with them
---
Unless it happened in the first 3 weeks of January id say so
---
Oh, just the way you phrased it was confusing to me.  I agree completely.  Grind beasts.  Cook meats, skin them.  All good stuff.
---
For lvl 1-10 why not use moonfire after 1st wrath so the moonfire DoT can get to work sooner?
---
ONE WEEK.
---
We're talking EARLY days.  Hell, there was an icon placeholder of a Blizzard employee's face.
---
R/thathappened
---
and i had more fun the latest stress test than the sum of like 10 days playing retail because i cant fucking wait
---
Only issue is I will be working with my father! it’s alright, maybe by the time I get home the first bit of people will have cleared that queue 😂
---
Thanks but I think I’m good.  I think I understand bags enough to get by just fine lol
---
Pink pigtailed gnome with green eyes.
---
/laugh
---
I would like to know as well :D
---
The most appealing thing about classic for me is the idea of starting over entirely, fresh account, everybody starting at the same time from the same line. The difficulty and grindyness of the game is what makes it such a chill afterwork game, I can't be bothered to focus 110% on a competitive moba or shooter after an 8 hour workday, I'd rather just farm wool cloth somewhere and kill low level players.
---
im new to WoW and i am going in blind as a warrior. i know nothing, vaguely heared about talent trees. im fucking stocked for it.
---
Not that i'm supporting this organisation neither i'm muslim or anything. But the Group ISIS had a chance to emerge because Countrys like Syria, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan were destabilized by the US.
---
People were living good lives especially in Iran and Syria before the US came.
---
As a priest, you will compete for some items but actually, some plus healing cloth items are wanted by shaman and druids as well, so healers generally compete against each other. And, if each group has a shaman (ideal scenario) thats 8 people competing for gear. The truth is every class competes for gear, druids compete the least but they still need some cloth healing pieces as well.
---
Yea, it's definitely become a collaboration. Would be cool to hear it sung!
---
&gt; a lot of the guild wants to play on Herod since that’s where the population will be.
---
Bro, almost every single server is high pop right now.  The population will be on *every* server.
---
I am rushing to 60 so I don't get buttfucked in STV for the next 3 months.
---
Had a 60 something retiree hardcore raiding sunwell top 150 World guild. I think hes probably ded now
---
I'm having PTSD flashbacks of playing Ragnarok Online private servers and having people walk up to me, "BR? BR? BR?"
---
Pushing 50 here.  I'll be back.
---
Oh sorry, I already have a built PC at home! I travel a lot for work so I’m meaning for on the go grinding!
---
I’m seein double here! Four Herods!
---
Yeah possible 90%. The thing blizzard are miscalculating is the actual total of people coming back where 90% drop will still have servers too full to layer. Lets not forget vanilla servers were at about 2500 - 3000 caps.
---
Part of me feels that everyone else in the world got an advantage by not having English as their primary language. 
---
You all got to learn a second language while we English were happy sitting in our bubble expecting everyone to speak our language.
---
Just like your levels from 1-60 slower each time, but you WILL get there!
---
You're gonna have a great time with that machine.
---
General balance changes for underperforming specs that were really unfinished in vanilla. 
---
Enhance shaman is unfinished tank spec, they make it a better dps spec instead, they make paladin a better tank. Druids get a bit better. 
---
Underperforming stuff was brought up a bit mostly.
---
7 Dage! ses
---
I agree, lol
---
But it doesn’t rhyme
---
My family sent me care packages. Generally everyone ate everything to kinda “spread the wealth” of slim Jim’s and tasty treats. 
---
A care package with a satellite interwebs connected computer and WoW classic would’ve been better.
---
What I really enjoy is people talking about the military that have never been in - cus they know it all like totes. I joined because they said my d*ck was to small to get puss anywhere except the military. Then upon joining my junk was still to small and to this day my little devil dog is still little and I still get no play - WoW classic is gunna change that- I’m gunna drown in gamer girl squirt water all day.
---
Check out his guides instead. He's more known for that.
---
https://www.joanasworld.com/
---
Complete 1-60 guide on horde, and I think he's almost done with the ally version.
---
If they break 50% then I don't understand how NA doesn't get language based servers like Europe has. Fucking stupid roll out by Blizz
---
&lt;FROM TRANSLATOR&gt;
---
Hey ho!
---
Since both German-speaking realms are currently full and long queues can occur when WoW Classic is released, we will provide two new German-speaking realms for name reservations on Tuesday, August 20 at 20:00 CEST:
---
Name Type Language
---
Razorfen Normal German
---
Venoxis PvP German
---
We recommend Everlook and Lucifron players to consider switching to one of these realms. This will help ensure that the player population is distributed as evenly as possible before the release and that the best gaming experience is available to everyone.
---
One of our top priorities when releasing WoW Classic was and is to ensure that we build a solid foundation for realm communities that will last for months and years to come. That's why we're cautious about opening new realms.
---
To give you a little more insight here:
---
In 2019, we will be able to accommodate many more players on a realm than we did in 2006. And even though we have the technical capacity to raise the realm limits further, we won't do that. Because increasing the realm limits would prevent the problem in the short term (by allowing more players to start), but in the long run (as soon as the layering is permanently disabled before the start of the second content phase) it would create an unsustainable situation with long queues.
---
Please also note that the population estimates of the realms displayed in the game (Low, Medium, High and Full) are based on these increased capacities - a medium realm already has more characters today than a full realm in 2006.
---
Never take renew, unless you are designated renew priest on Maexxna. One of the worst talents of them all. 
---
Healing focus is more or less mandatory on a PvP server in my opinion.
---
WTB addon for always front flip
---
&gt; Oh, just the way you phrased it was confusing to me. 
---
I was rolling about six Thunderbrews deep last night, so there's that.
---
Someone will turn this into a "streamer privilege" narrative one way or another.
---
WTB addon for perma front flip
---
Nice Catch! I'll fix that right away.
---
This is really cool! I love the streamers getting sniped, lol
---
Level 26
---
Weather != climate. Pls don't use singular weather events to argue for climate change, because then idiotic climate change deniers will use the exact same arguments
---
It may well be that I reported you multiple times. Not to worry though, Blizzard did fuck all about it.

We are currently raiding in a private server to specifically prepare for Classic, so more players who have not confirmed are expected to come over to Classic with us.
---
__**Introduction**__
---
ΒΔΝ is an NA East Coast guild led by WoW veterans who are well experienced in GM roles and raid leading. Collectively we have raided and PvP'd through all of WoW's lifetime from Vanilla to the current retail expansion, BoA. Our members' ages range from mid 20s to mid 30s, but we welcome all 18+ applicants.
---
We are a semi-hardcore raiding guild who also love to world and BG PvP. Progression raiding will only occur during raid hours and debuffs will be organized. Raiders will be expected to gear and collect consumables on your own as well.
---
__**Loot and Raid Hours**__
---
Our loot distribution system will be loot council which will distribute as needed in favor of whatever is both best and fair for the guild and raiders - loyalty, attendance, preparation, and performance will be taken into account.
---
__**Conclusion**__
---
With that said, we do like to have fun – this is a game after all. We don’t take ourselves too seriously and try to help others when we can. We don’t encourage a toxic culture but we do like to joke around a lot, so if you're easily offended this may not be the guild for you. If you’re interested check out our discord link above and intronduce yourself in the #classic-guild-applicants channel.
---
\#notmybarrens
---
TIL that everyone's character name is a few-letter-long super common name that for sure 100% at least 1 guy has taken in every single server you're thinking of rolling on. /s
---
Like, I can understand it's a big issue for guys who have named their character "Orc" to lose it by changing server. But for 99% of the playerbase, including guys who have reserved their names, unless being extremely unlucky, name reserving shouldn't be a valid excuse for not changing server, ***specially now 1 week before release when most of the player base still hasn't created any character, when therefore plenty of names should be available.*** Like most of the time your name will be available no matter what if you decide to change now.
---
Plus for the few ones it actually is a problem, you can verify if your name is already taken on a certain server or not by just trying. Even for your friends if it matters. It's very easy and fast to do. So, what's the problem? (again for the 99.99999 of the playerbase, sorry for the rest)
---
I’m almost positive in 1.12 pet attack speed is normalized, so that advantage may no longer exist
---
Questie
---
What i will do while pvping
---
could they also pls give the Brazilians their own server, i'm not Brazilian but I mean if they're giving everyone their own server, would be nice for these people to get their own as well
---
Yeah that's basically what I said, just the other way around. Whether you limit transmog so other players CAN'T see your transmog or you make it so that other players have the OPTION to turn your transmog off is basically arbitrary.

That would require socialization. That was removed from WoW starting around 10 years ago.
---
I’d absolutely love to be part of a close nit amazing guild like these have/had :) i hope you find every member and enjoy your guild immensely.
---
I haven't been this excited about... Anything.... I a  while. Which is really sad, but hey, at least I'm excited!
---
Fuck off
---
People say they would like 8 shamans if possible so that they can have a totem for each group. I'd say both are high in demand
---
I absolutely agree with that, but complaining about someone using insults, while throwing insults yourself, makes you look like a hypocrite.
---
There are other pets?
---
As said, isis was created by the us military presence
---
Sorry but you are wrong. Ive leveled a rogue, mage, priest, druid and warrior all to 60 and the hardest was the rogue second to the god awful start to druid. 
---
Mages Id say was definitely the easiest especially once you start aoe leveling with a mount. Take a look and see for your self. 
---

Click on world of Warcraft right above the play button and you can convert it to classic
---
Orc Racial makes a huge difference in PvP.
---
Was lvl 58 prot pala, just did my attune for MC and the guild was lacking healers for a casual MC night. Grabbed what few cloth gear I had and headed there.
---
Ended up saving the Chambellan fight with bandages and LoH and bubbles on the MT because shit happened.
---
Ended up also with like, 70% of my T1 since it's pretty much only what the bosses dropped and all the other pals were geared.
---
So many people were salty and jealous it created enough drama that officers revamped the raid participation requirements and other rules.
---
Step 2.5: make a dedicated South American server
---
But they aren't spinning up infinite amount of layers. They want to control the max amount of players because of phase 2 where layers are turned off. If there are too many players because of layers, they will have queue's at phase 2 and they rather want to start with queues early to force people to other servers so they dont have a massive time sink into their character yet then in phase 2.
---
Need those videos up on your second monitor to help with the pain of grinding.
---
since when does the barrens look that lovely haha
---
How about you let us do us, since we let you do you.
---
Are you sure about that.. I raided alliance but I have to imagine having Totems will keep them more or less at parity with druids being the odd man out and only 2 or so coming.
---
Yup, give me 30 hours of grinding at my own pace over 1 hour daily anytime. I'd much rather go at my own pace than feel like I have a daily chore to do. 8 hours here, a couple hours there, maybe take a few days off, whatever. Just don't make me feel like I HAVE to do something every day or I'm missing out.
---
yeah dude classic is gonna offer you so much retail content than retail
---
Finland ?? Get outta here.
---
Druid fam &lt;3
---
TBC and WOTLK &lt;333, Classic is awesome but those expansions are when I really got into WoW. I was still too young to appreciate or grasp Classic WoW
---
The hardest thing to learn in the german language are just the articles, like in english you always use "the". In german you have "der, das, den, dem,...." pretty hard to learn if it's not your mother tongue.
---
I have off for a week literally a day after it releases, but I can’t play with my potato pc... so I just probably won’t
---
Thalnos has the Brazilians, Spanish players, and the NA French guilds. Good luck mate.
---
Oh yes stuff took way longer, but I'm saying that patience is a skill in itself. You see it all the time in life where people get impatient and fail at whatever task/hobby/etc they are trying to do. It's easy for people to say "i could do this if I had the time", but harder to actually do it. And a lot of people will defend that way of thinking (not just in computer games). Patience, discipline, consistency, all key skills - it's not all just mechanics and technique.
---
I'll come back to this thread in a couple of days to see if that flair is something else
---
Literally from Hitler
---
Would auto running into a wall classify as hitting?
---
I think you need an active sub before it'll even show up
---
I spammed rend
---
Oh wow! Fingers crossed that you get the job, you'll have to report back with how it goes :)
---
Well, you will stack more shamans than priests in raid. So then its more based on how many priests vs shamans you have on your server... that are in the same skill/experience/guild level as you.
---
Yea I was kinda going back and forth on how to word it properly. Thanks for the suggestion!

There is still something to be said for someone walking past you in a set of items that are incredibly rare or hard to get, and making you turn your head a bit. You're not inspecting them, you just saw them by chance. That's why I think transmog should always be able to be completely turned off if you want it to be, so that you can only see your own.
---
I watch my character from the front and do the whole panoramic experience. Might as well while on auto-run. Even more so, now, with layering. Nothing to look at but illusions. 🤦‍♂️
---
Can't tell if serious or not.
---
Whoa there guy, I was 14 when my lvl 60 hunter was whomping people all over Alterac Valley. Don't sleep on teenagers, they can no-life with far more dedication that the rest of us.
---
So true.
---
Living paycheck to paycheck makes it hard to pick up your life and drive away. Plus my wife is in the middle of her PhD in a somewhat specialized field and we would rather put up with tornadoes than live in New York.
---
What will you watch on your second monitor while you grind boars?
---
Respect!
---
WoW is rated T for teen.
---
I was 26 at launch and will be here at 6 EST next Monday, now aged 41 years with a wife and 2 kids. Except this time, I know about strafing, macros, keybinds, and gaming keyboards/mice. Ready to have a proper MMORPG to play once more.
---
It's the safest way!

---
downvoted by clowns who cant construct a reasonable argument :(
---
I expect a large dropoff, but not 90%...
---
Yep this is the negative of this approach. Imagine if you were forced to merge with a server you didnt want to be on though! Or were on a very low pop realm due to the population being too thinly spread.
---
Its lose-lose for blizzard I think.
---
Joke is on you. My social life has been gone for a long time.

Only because Hitler didn’t want him to join the Axis of Evil that Stalin so desperately wanted to join :).

There isnt an obvious player kill in that screenshot.
---
&gt; I'm gonna customize every little feature, pick my ultimate in-game avatar, and find out someone sniped my name  
---
What I'm anticipating
---
Yeah, 100%. Gearing isn't always too terrible, just 'cause once you've done it you'll know what you need and be able to roll accordingly. I mean, especially as a warrior, just run as tank and only take non-plate classes with you into pre-BiS dungeons to ensure you get all the plate gear to help you get geared up. If you're hoping for purples though, yyyeah...I'm not convinced that'll be feasible unless you're long-term no-lifeing it.
---
damn frost nova noobs
---
I always pick an orc skin color then end up hating it.
---
I’d love a PM too please!
---
I remember hunters using core hounds in tbc arenas. Am I crazy or wasnt that a thing? Can they not be tamed in classic? Im guessing the level difference in tbc made it possible but its been years.
---
Cheers
---
Actually 5/5 is better while leveling unless you plan to level from 1-60 on a Patchwork doll that does not move and allows you to play a perfect rotation. In nearly all other situations, an instant corruption is better.
---
It's two syllables. At least for most of the US. One syllable for the southeastern US. "oy-ill" turns into "'ol" which just sounds stupid.
---
alguem br? huehuehue
---
I was the hunter whose pet pulled the first boss by accident... and our tank was the kind of tank who picked it up, calmly issued commands left and right on TS - and saved the raid.
---
I was very grateful... and my pet never, ever pulled anything by accident, ever again. Also, I learned to use traps expertly, and I levelled a druid and worked my furry butt off to gear it because we needed an offtank.
---
Yep, our tank was very inspirational.
---
They did this for the Warhammer online launch, it worked really fucking well, but then we all ended back up on the big server, which was nice because we where able to level without as much competition, then got thrown back into the high pop server. Also I should not they did the copy a few days after launch. Herod is Dark Craag!
---

&gt; What is your version number for your [Battle.net 2](http://battle.net/) Application? You will be able to see the version number in the bottom level corner of the [Battle.net 2](http://battle.net/) Settings menu. If it does not list 1.15.1.11346 you do not have the newest version installed.
---
Because the screenshot is of OP doing exactly what you are suggesting for him to do. It’s like you didn’t even look at it, lol
---
Your title is literally you being pretentious enough to claim that yours is the first, though.
---
I know that I probably got reported a lot and I would do it aswell. However, as you said, Blizzard did not give a single shit about it.
---
Sure but simultaneously lots of it is wanked away, either on daft buildings and crooked pastors. More frequently though on overseas conversion projects.
---
Oops right you are.
---
Exactly. 100% agreed. Plus, if you don't like 40-man raids there's always the 10-man raids.
---
Even fucking Oceania gets better realm names than EU, LOL.
---
Oh no, no issues getting retarded names like stompsalot, this isnt one of those "i missed out on my name post" This is all my friends have moved on twice and got lives posts so ive formed a new crew posts!
---
I know you mentioned books, but I got a [mug](https://www.etsy.com/listing/641516314/horde-world-of-warcraft-mug-gamer-gifts?ref=hp_opfy-1&amp;pro=1&amp;frs=1) recently and I love it. The construction is nice quality and it holds a large amount. You can get either the Horde or Alliance icon on it - just make sure to know which side your boyfriend is playing for!  
---
There’s also statuettes and plushies of WoW characters if he’s into things like that.
---
Oh, I'm sorry everyone
---
I forgot this remaster was happening. Wasn't it supposed to be out by now?
---
I like to get to like level 4, leave the starting area, log out and play horde 👀
---
Yeah, very disappointing. One of the best things about classic wow battlegrounds was meeting the same people over and over, and really getting that rivalry going.
---
I'm 35, i played vanilla , and i resent you for putting me with the 50's.
---
didn't want to go too deep into why they're toxic but yeah that's a part of it
---
*these boots are made for walking starts playing*
---
Oh wow that’s an old one
---
I guarantee the system admins and network engineers at Blizz know way more about how to manage servers than you.
---
Why does this hit sooooo hard XD
---
So all I have to do is multi-box six hunters and then statistically I'll be guaranteed to get 1 and 1/5 Brokenteeths.
---
Mend Pet equip.
---
Does your wife’s boyfriend like it though?
---
I never found the cross-country relocating as dangerous as just naturally time-consuming.. Then again, I never did it on a PvP server. 😂
---
And, pre-Honor system, people will be absolute savages to lower levels.
---
So when people are whining about being ganked and camped in WPvP, they could literally be 9 years old.
---
Noted.
---
Remulos sure beats Shazzrah and Golemagg
---
This concept isn't new. I was being downvoted earlier this year by the #nochange community on this subreddit for mentioning it (and so did others).  
---
My idea is that the old gods win in retail wow. The bronze dragonflight is trying to make subtle changes to the timeline, similar to infinite dragonflight. We still go to Outland and Northrend (as those events remain unchanged) etc, but new events are carried out, involvingthe bronze dragonflight who are preparing for the future.

This is one thing people seem to forget.  We are probably going to have a raid tier for a lot longer than when it first came around.  It seems pretty possible that you’ll start to see odd combinations as it has happened in the past.  
---
China didn’t get LK for like2 years or something crazy because of censorship laws.  So they were still raiding Sunwell while we were starting in on ICC.  I heard stories that guilds had been running sunwell and BT for so long that they started to get Enh Shaman tanks and other combos you didn’t think could work.
---
New York based duo who intends to wpvp/raid on horde. Both raided/wpvp heavy in vanilla.  Looking to avoid streamers.
---
so the hunter feings and traps, it's not like the hunter has no CC
---
It was a big issue in the beginning of Archeage
---
That is exactly my choice! Or go back to Lock as utility DPS if I hate it.
---
I'm almost 42 and I couldn't be more excited about Classic. I have gathered a group of 22 people to start a guild and most of us are in their mid 30's.
---
We live on a rock hurtling through space that's being pelted by other rocks hurtling through space. Where do I move to?
---
I know that. Even I did myself.
---
Not possible in Classic because they are only in MC and are either too high lvl or just straight up untamable .
---
Bear Tanks have insane, and I mean *insane*, early threat. It's not needed. It all comes to what you want though honestly. Both talents are very weak, I just prefer thick fur.
---
Might be because I'll be nelf and we already get increased stealth, making feral instinct less useful
---
I let my 4yr old play back in the day on a level 1 in the starting zone, I think it was a troll but I don't remember...what I DO remember is coming back later and finding her in Booty Bay and in a guild with people typing to her which of course she was oblivious too.  Pretty much awesome and hilarious.  Yeah, she's all grown now and gonna play classic lol
---
Is launcher up today if not close it and restart I had a similar issue and this fixed it
---
This movie scared me so bad when I was younger and now all I want is a call from Samara
---
hasn't seen it yet, ill keep you posted
---
Lol I’m debating getting off early so I can make the 4pm start time.
---
I did not take time off. I got to save it for when I take like 3 weeks off in December for Christmas break.
---
Specifically tranq makes having hunters mandatory for a few slots at least
---
Phasing will kill this.
---
Classic WoW isn’t relevant to WoW? Hmmmmmmmm

&gt;Several unoptimal rosters clear many AQ/Naxx bosses back in the day.
---
We didn't clear it though.  
---
We didn't have  a single lock capable of tanking Vek'lor, and we lacked 8 tanks for 4hm.
---
But yes, raid composition and even raid skill required is often overrated around here.
---
Just by virtue of having a functioning brain, having more than 5fps and less than 100ms latency you're perfectly capable of clearing whatever you want in Classic.
---
That’s so funny I’m getting the same map printed

Paladins CAN!

Set up macro to auto target mob and just afk at one of the spots lmao, run night elf so you can stealth.

Wasn’t there a bat with the same attack speed
---
Sadly I have not found a way to get that working. Sorry about that.
---
yupppp everyone talking about priest this priest that but when the leather healing gear drops, it's gonna be all mine. Also can't beat cat/travel from while leveling.
---
Healing in 5 man dungeons is easily my favourite thing in the game.
---
Yeah, as I said below, I worded that poorly. I know Arenas are HIGHLY debatable and something that is not really "classic like". It's more of a very subjective thinking.  
---
Dual specs would have been insane yes. So much QoL. But team "REEEEE NO CHANGEEEE" would rather waste hours each week to farm because it's part of the class fantasy to suck at either PvP or Pve depending on your spec. :(
---
I don’t even think that anyone got to level 11 before the first kill.

Nope, it only said 2019 iirc.

It was easy for me. Roll Dorf Female, pick the ugliest hairstyle/face combo, never show helmet, and laugh at how triggered the Horde must get after I gank them.
---
And 3) You live with your parents
---
no worries yellow fever =)
---
People? What people? I just love playing the game. Is it illegal to kill other players in the game? No? Move along.
---
Worth it.
---
how will be the A:H population in the layers? random or 50:50? would be a bad pvp experience if 75% alliance players and 25% horde players are in the same layer. how about making just 1 pvp realm per region with permanent layering and try to keep a 50:50 A:H population and idk 5k players per layer?
---
i have  1.15.1.11346 - damn this is weird
---
Keep Classic servers running, or implement some QoL improvements from later expansions in the "classic world". Like Dual specs at least.
---
Yes, trivially easy to beat.
---
Vanilla/Classic enforces a social playstyle, where doing stuff with friends is nearly always preferable to being solo. This style of game is pretty unique in the way Classic works.
---
There are hundreds of games like Fortnite, where the focus is quick teamplay with instant gratification and no lasting personal connections. They are neither wanted nor needed. All that matters is to be 'the best'.
---
The social critters, who prefer the Classic experience, has no alternative, and they haven't really had any since BC ended. Blizzard themselves has stated that more than 100 mio. players have tried WoW over the years, meaning most of them have left retail by now.
---
If just 5%, 1 in 20, of those 100 mio. are still looking for a social MMORPG, then you have your 5 mio. players at launch, worldwide.
---
Its a good decision to go blind into the game.  
---
There will be alot friendly players who can help you.  
---
Everybody benefit to quest in a group.   
---
If you see someone is solo question the same quests like yours say hello and invite the player.
---
Just some important tipps:  
---
\- loot every killed mob (you will need the gold)  
---
\- go to your class trainer to upgrade / learn the skills  
---
\- install the Addon -&gt;  "**MapCoords Classic"**  
---
If you have trouble to find some questmobs or something else you can check out the postion on [classic.wowhead.com ](https://classic.wowhead.com)
---
Rogue is basically top dps right? I imagine there will be a ton.
---
I had the same issue with a player in our guild. Shower breaks for 15min. Was so strange. Thinking back, I should of questioned it more and she should of been benched until after showers
---
Still used a lot within Path of Exile community as a remnant of D2 days. Its more of a meme tho (as is pvp).
---
Well, I was younger, but even then, Classic is much more rigid. These expansions are really what hit home for me.  
---
Will play Classic a lot, but I'll no life the fuck out of TBC &amp; WOTLK I think.
---
It's a marathon, not a sprint. If it's not fun, put it down for an evening and pick it up the next day.
---
Patch 1.14 the Dragon Isles ((Changelog has class changes from TBC and keeps the no flying and no lfg vanilla style but more content and raids))
---
Squishy? You'll need first aid after nearly every kill, but with sap you'll be able to take on three mobs, vanish and gouge get you out of trouble quickly, and stealth is dead useful while leveling. It's on the difficult end of the spectrum but great for curious people who occasionally can't be arsed to fight.
---
This and so much this. If you're new to to WoW, or Wow Classic - just play, dont min-max yourself into ruining it for you.  
---
Elitest jerks will still exist
---
Pretty much this.
---
Alliance see the Horde because the Orcs were used to invade Azeroth and killed many of them until the Orcs freed themselves of Demonic slavement. Joined with races the Alliance would make peace with so they just decided to hate them altogether.
---
Horde, once free of the Demonic Powers, stopped fighting and tried to find a home for themselves (were stuck on Azeroth once Portal closed). Being chased by Alliance but wanting to flee from what they were used for. Joined up with other "outcasts" and just trying to make a place for themselves.
---
Not saying both are good or bad, but that there are bad seeds in both groups, just as there are good ones too. It's all on the players perspective.
---
7 rogues are ganking
---
Eh. The vocal minority that is a group on Reddit might only be half filled with folk like you describe. I think the rose tinted glasses thing people talk about isn't as prevalent as most think.
---
It may not be the pinnacle of WoW, I realyl don't think there IS a 'pinnacle of wow' period, but imo it was one of the better times. It had its shortcomings (god fucking damn I hate how fucked UP the balance is from spec to spec) but it was still a good time. And I am excited to go back to a time where grouping up was ass but at least you talked to your people.
---
wow should've stayed story-lite and blizzard could've made more single player games for story
---
Wow you're actually right, we loved Vol'jin and he did nothing when he was Warchief so
---
I feel the same way about MK, but for some reason gibbing in OG Doom doesn't make me cringe. It still feels awesome.
---
The servers are already up! Login nice and early, especially if you want to roll on a Full server, create your character if you haven't done so yet and wait for the Enter World button to become active.
---
That would have gone day as one of the most insane remasters in history. Can you 8magine releasing Warcraft 3 several months before vanilla wow?? Story wise and hype wise it would have been incredible.
---
I'm pretty disappointed by the SPriest offerings. A lot of other specs have at least one item that's insanely good (especially Feral Druids), while the "best" SPriest items are Spiritshaper's Bracers and Dark Chapter.
---
Given that the bracers provide less spell damage *and* less Int and *no* Stamina, no Hit, and a paltry amount of mp/5, I'd never see anyone using them over Bracers of Arcane Accuracy if given the choice. And the Dark Chapter, while intriguing at first glance, is far less impressive than it lets on. The damage boost is substantial, no doubt (better than all other canon offhands to my knowledge), but that proc gives a SPriest an average of ~5 mp/5. If you were trying to design items that would compensate for meme spec flaws, I think you fell pretty short on this one. For SPriest to stand alone as a legitimate spec instead of a damage battery for Warlocks, it needs substantial mana regen support instead of merely damage (its dps isn't all that terrible—not fantastic, but certainly not dead last—until it runs out of mana thirty seconds in). Even Boomkins got something like Idol of Regenerative Powers.
---
I love this. This is great.
---
Probably just misspelled by Blizzard.

---
That method also works very well for maintaining player names, but I think most players would still be inclined to stay on the original and leave the completely new server lower population.
---
If you redistribute across two servers with brand new names (this includes renaming the original), you're more likely to end up with a good balance between those two so long as the names are appealing and there isn't another external influence like what occurred on Faerlina and Thalnos.
---
I hear many players wishing that there had been an additional East PvP server choice from the beginning, and I feel the method I described comes closest to reproducing that.
---
Both methods are completely valid for consideration.

I’m 39 and I’ll be gaming. I know a lot of people in that age bracket that will be throwing down on PVP servers. We just don’t fill out surveys and go on podcasts. WoW attracts an older crowd to begin with and those of us that played in college or mid 20s are now in our late 30s.

---
Well i wouldnt say Horde are the bad guys, at least not the horde that Thrall led. 
---
Personally I like the Horde's lore and races way more than Alliance's.
---
It varies. For instances that need healers then people love you. In the world when you save someone from almost dying, most of the time you get a nice thank you. Same with buffs. In PvP, same thing. You can tell just by how people behave if they care - so there's a lot of cool people that buff back or mages that make you water (pro tip for mages:  when I get stacks of water, you get yourself a pocket healer if you want), or someone helps you kill a mob or two.
---
Is it fun? Yeah, it's fun in PvP when people realize you're keeping them alive and help peel for you and I personally get off on watching some opposite faction think they have this poor SOB about to die and then BAM! healed 100%, bubble, dispel DoTs, and the tables turn!  There's no feeling quite like it.
---
There's no feeling quite like having a 5 man crew pull to many mobs, feeling your adrenaline rush as you triage the situation, manage your 5 sec rule and pull out all stops including maybe a potion or helping wand or whaever during the choas and finding that you saved the group from a complete wipe, rez, and back up.  Sometimes you get crushed, but as you get better you can mostly get so good at it that people are like "damn, that was close, nice work!" 
---
Raids...meh. It's pretty OK, everyone is excited to see bosses go down but just to be completely honest I like watching the HP go down more on a DPS than watching health bars at that particular time.
---
Overall though, it's fun as long as you have groups to play with. Solo, it's completely terrible.
---
Though late leveling takes ages as well. Might as well take the time to get 6 fishing per lvl
---
This is just speculation, but the servers themselves are already up and available for character creation, you just aren’t able to actually log into the world yet from the character creation screen. I would expect when the world servers go live you should just be able to be on your character and go from there? That’s what I’m planning at least
---
I used to consult back in the day and one of the clients I used to work for used to constantly fall asleep and take naps during the hours. This guys was like 50+ so I though it might just be old age and shit. It wasn’t until I saw thottbot being open on his desktop that I knew what was up.
---
Its not okay for endgame min/maxers to tell me how to play my game. I'm going to rant about how my way is far superior. That will show them how much more fun I'm having! /s
---
This circle jerk always devolves into "Just play how you want." Stop being overly sensitive to someone having different perspectives than you and play how you want.
---
i want to upvote this but it's at 7 points
---
I never played classic. I started in late bc, but I've been maining priest since then. Shadow mostly, but I've healed some here and there. I'm stoked about healing for classic. I'm even more stoked for benediction/anathema.
---
alright cheers, nice and easy. nothing worse than getting hyped for a launch and then sitting in a queue. ill be in there way in advance with my doritos and mountain dew
---
They thought we wouldn't, but we did
---
Yes, private servers with incorrect values and setting on several levels. I doubt we will see a similar surge on live realms.
---
You don’t know that. It’s the least labor intensive solution for blizzard. All they can do is highly recommend transferring.
---
I hope hes coming back for Classic :D
---
Arthas was obviously a bad guy....he slaughtered much of the alliance, and the alliance disagreed with his actions even before he became under the influence of the Frostmourne. By the time he killed his father, he wasn't even Arthas anymore.
---
Best solution would to just delete Herod and tell everyone they are opening two new servers. One of the new servers can be herod, the other name w/e.
---
Force them / guilds to relocate to another server or for people try to reclaim their names on herod again or on the new server.
---
Btw why undead are "undead" instead of unliving? The greatest mystery of our time.
---
They will switch ones they are in 5000+ queues.
---
I'm sorry, does she have a disorder?
---
As others have said, engineering synergizes extemely well with hunter.
---
*  Engineering makes guns and bullets which can be nice sometimes
---
* Grenades are very useful when casters are in your deadzone
---
* Hunters are good at getting out of combat in PvE and PvP so you can swap around the various trinkets easily (reflectors, rocket helm, net projector, battle chicken, etc)
---
* Feign death and jumper cables is amazing anti wipe
---
* Sapper charges and grenades are great for supplementing your otherwise mediocre AOE dps if you want to try hard in raids
---
Engineering is just fun though. You won't make a ton of money with it but there are some opportunities. If you want to invest in your character and increase your PvP ability and skullcap significantly, go for it. If you want to level to 60 ASAP and make money as fast as possible, go skinning / mining.
---
Ain’t nothing to do with globalism or anti-patriotism though. In many aspect, European countries show just as much if not more interest to their respective military than the US (military parades each year are the norm all around Europe, and military events ceremony are extremely common and covered extensively by the local media for example). 
---
It’s just the American mentality surrounding it that people can’t comprehend. Talking in great lengths about your “great veterans”, saying that they’re “dying for freedom” and making them into martyrs who need to be nurtured with charity and public interest - while all your troops are far from home in zones they often contributed to destabilize and where they shouldn’t be around in the first place, zones where the US army is clearly just staying to defend American economical interests. It’s mix of hypocrisy and bizarre contemps towards the army, which many of us in Europe can’t really understand.
---
Some zones are majority Horde or Alliance, but still contested.  If you are an Alliance in Elwynn and Westfall (Alliance territories) you won't get flagged for PvP unless you flag yourself.  Once you enter into a contested zone though, it'll flag you for PvP until you are in an uncontested zone for I think 5 minutes.
---
I can't help but sing this in my head as i read it.
---
I will be 40 soon and I plan to stream also. I started in 2005 so was 25 even then lol
---
You do realize that every single change that was made to the game, ever, was done because people like you put QoL above the rest? We played vanilla, we played private servers, we will play Classic and we won't start whining for QoL.
---
QoL is also dungeon finder, LFR, portals everywhere, dual spec. Do you want those things, too?
---
Respecc costs served as a gold sink. It was important, it will be important. Don't play Classic if you aren't willing to deal with not being able to switch your talents in whichever situation you want.
---
You level fishing up on every new char?  Jesus have mercy.
---
I'll do it on the two main chars, but the others can get fucked lol. (Same for first aid)
---
the undead female haircuts are all so good. it's a very hard choice.
---
Played with a guy who had shitty connection from jamaica. We would let him tag along during boss encounters to get loot sometimes in MC.
---
He would have to stand way back from the bossfight because he qould lag and DC. We were doing a fightand I cant remember which one. Maybe Shazzrah? And we wiped at 1%. 
---
Then, from the shadows comes the hunters scorpion pet he had sent in using an assist because he couldn't xome himself. We watch as this lone scorpion charges Shazz and with its 1 hit kills the boss.
---
Vent went wild and the pet was immortilized i  our guild chat to say the least.
---
If queues are 2 hours plus I'll definitely switch assuming it's not bad on all servers day one.

&lt;One Night Stand&gt; Alliance | NA PVP| One Night Raiding!
---
Hi there, we are a group of returning players looking to add to our ranks. We are comprised primarily of people looking for a home where they can kill content on a light schedule. We get it, IRL happens.
---
What to expect?
---
Organized and competent one night a week raiding as well as the social aspects that come with a guild (PVP/Dungeons/Other games/etc). We expect competence but are not going to force you to min/max and recognize who we are.
---
Raid times?
---
Day TBD (Likely Sunday, Tuesday, or Thursday)
---
3 hours of raiding
---
Needs:
---
All players who match our approach to the game and desire to clear content while maintaining our IRL commitments are welcome; currently class wise:
---
    - Warrior (Prot): Low
---
    - Warrior (DPS): Low
---
    - Mage: Medium
---
    - Warlock: Medium
---
    - Druid (Resto): Medium
---
    - Druid (DPS/Offtank): Low
---
    - Paladin: Low
---
    - Hunter: Low
---
    - Rogue: Medium

---
- 60 within 2-3 months of launch
---
- Maturity, we're cool so we want you to be cool
---
If interested, check out our discord and hang out a bit before launch!

I was 8-9 years old lol, now I'm 21
---
I bought gametime to reserve my names for wow classic, so I went back to play BFA in the meantime (last time I touched it was dec 2018). Everything still feels like a grind or a chore, it isn't fun - my god it actually felt like school and work. Back in wow classic, I feel rewarded for working for something. Now in BFA I feel like being punished for trying to accomplish something. Time to reminisce back during my 2006 wow vanilla gaming :(
---
I'm working offshore. There is barely any Internet to play in the evenings but I'll be home first a week after lunch and with 4 weeks off I will have plenty of time to play the game.
---
Probably because it happened on Retail. Antonidas was hard Alliance and Blackrock was hard Horde.
---
Is it sad or funny that I'm in my 30s?  I think a little bit of both.
---
Also nature resist aura
---
Now look at Thrall and the encampment the Alliance had him at.
---
Both sides do bad stuff.

# &lt;Pure Luck&gt; | Faerlina (NA-East PvP) | Semi-Hardcore
---
**About Us**
---
Our members want to experience everything that Classic World of Warcraft has to offer, while still maintaining balance between the game and our adult lives. We are mostly in our mid-twenties to mid-thirties, and have played WoW on and off since its original release. We have a hardcore mindset with casual raiding hours. Every raider is expected to know how their class functions, how boss fights work, how to properly itemize and what consumables to bring to raids, but we plan to spend fewer than ten hours per week raiding. 
---
You might be a good fit for our guild if you are looking for a friendly and organized team to make efficient progress through Classic raiding. Our core members have well over 100 years of combined guild management and raiding experience since the original launch. We expect all guild members to be mature and respectful, and able to fit in well in a group where the average age is about 30-years-old.  
---
**Our Values**
---
* Integrity -  *Do the right thing, even when no one is looking. Treat members and non-members alike with fairness and respect.* 
---
* Patience - *Accept that mistakes happen. Keep a level head and stay focused on what can be done to improve the situation.* 
---
* Growth - *Learn from your mistakes, seek feedback, welcome advice, and share best practices.* 
---
* Humor - *Don't take yourself or your guildmates too seriously! We are all in this to have fun.* 
---
* Humility - *Leave your ego at the login screen. We are one team, united by our goals.* 
---
**Our Goals**
---
*  Create and sustain an active community of mature players and Classic WoW fanatics 
---
*  Level up, gear up, and begin raiding within six weeks of Classic launch 
---
*  Make steady progress through all raid content on a two-night raid schedule 
---
*  Kill every raid boss in the game 
---
*We also intend to host regular PvP events on raiding off-nights.*
---
**Raiding**
---
*Schedule: Tue/Wed, 7:00-10:30 p.m. EST*
---
Our members don't have time to raid four or five nights per week, but we are determined to do what it takes to clear the content on our limited schedules, so we expect our raiders to show up to scheduled raids on time and prepared. We will not require everyone to be an engineer and flask before every raid, but you should have basic potions, elixirs, ammo, bandages, etc., if you want to secure a raid spot.  
---
We will be using a loot council to distribute gear dropped in raids. We have created a robust, data-driven system to maintain fairness and ensure that people who help the guild to progress are being rewarded for their actions. More information on our loot system can be found on our information spreadsheet (link below).
---
**Recruiting Needs**
---
As of posting this, we have 36 members, 32 of whom intend to raid with us. We are in greatest need of mages, rogues, and warlocks. We have low needs for dedicated healers. Our tank positions are closed, however, we are interested in feral druid applicants who wish to DPS and off-tank as needed. For a full list of our openings and to see our current roster, visit our guild information spreadsheet (link below). If you are interested in applying to join our team, links to our application and our Discord can be found at the bottom of the spreadsheet.

I'm seein' double here, four Herods!?
---
same here, when you get to around 30 you just start to appriciate people for how they are and don't care much about age anymore. Our D&amp;D group is players ranged from like 25-50ish.
---
Definitely westfall.
---
Darkshore only has the one flight path all the way at the top and too much swimming and no dungeon.
---
Coil hunter -&gt; grenade pet -&gt; spam fear
---
&gt;  But I'm sure you have a reason this is a terrible idea too lol 
---
Yeah, because you are so smart that from one comment you just totally figured me out, right? I must be one of those "#nochanges or die in a fire" people, right?
---
I have no problem with a barbershop if only you could see it. Heck, I don't give a shit about modern models if I don't get to see it. For all I care you can be running around in BfA transmogs if it only shows up on your screen. 
---
But I do have a reason to not want that - it is more work. If they make the barbershop, why not add the new models? And transmog? And a bunch of other visuals. Sure you can make it all so only people that turn it on will see it, but that is a lot of work for Blizzard that could go to fixing the actual game first.
---
Once Classic is released and bug free and they have nothing more to do, sure - go ahead and add something like that, but it is a secondary priority to everything else. Also, once (if) they start to work on TBC or whatever they might do, again I'd prefer all manpower going towards that.

Horde &lt;B Y O B&gt; | Horde Herod PVP | Hard-Casual / Semi-Serious Raiding
---
ABOUT US
---
We're a hard-casual PVP Horde guild looking for people who have lives outside of WoW but still like to log in and TCB on the weekends.  Our guild leadership ran guilds during Vanilla and have experience with MC, ZG, BWL, etc.  Now we'd like to kick back and enjoy Classic with fellow chill adults who have a job, family, and life outside of WoW--but who still understand what it takes to prepare for raid night.  This guild was made for YOU.
---
BYOB's priority will be raiding but we also plan to make an impact on PvP with guild pre-mades.
---
GOALS
---
Raiding is our main priority, but we're not in a rush to get to 60.  We'd like to be 60 and raid-ready by late Nov-Dec.  Let's enjoy the grind and help each other prepare for raiding.
---
RAID SCHEDULE
---
Main raid: Fridays and Saturdays, 3 hour(~9:30pm-12am estTBD) raid nights on weekends, with weekday raids coming once ZG launches. 
---
LOOT
---
A combination roll and Loot Council. Things are going to be as fair as possible. (Still TBD) example...weapons, rings, trinkets on loot council, members will know where these items go before we even step inside the raid. MT/OT will have priority, but other than that all set pieces free roll.
---
EXPECTATIONS
---
Be punctual (on time).
---
Be excellent to each other.
---
Play your class to the best of your ability.
---

35 here....
---
The 1h 30 minutes run for 1-12 was on Classic Beta.
---
And yes private servers had incorrect values, they had WAY harder elites in dungeons that gave WAY less XP than what we'll have on Classic.
---
There was a whole XP Modifier missing for Dungeon Mobs on private Server.
---
Like lgbt?
---
Probably gonna hop on, use my free boost to 60 and queue up for LFR molten core. Or maybe run a few heroic scholo to get that challenge done for the gandling transmog toy.
---
It's ZG so we gotta wait for that phase.
---
Hah! Well that screenshot has traversed a few drives.

You put her in her place op!

Exiled [H] | NA (EST) - PVP | Wed/Fri/Sun 6-9:30 | Semi-hardcore | Loot council EPGP hybrid w/ decay + minimum
---
ABOUT US:
---
We are a mature group of men and women. Many of our members are returning seasoned WoW veterans, some experienced through AQ40 + Naxx in original vanilla, some through raids of the latter expansions, others were high rated RBG + arena junkies. Some people are new. Our top 45-50 players will be our core progression group. We will then start building our second 40 man raid. At the moment, we have 70+ confirmed members (not all of these players wish to raid with the core progression group - we still have room and whoever proves to be most competent the soonest will get the raid spot). Though we are a semi-hardcore guild, we aim to be one of the best on our server, keeping up with guilds that consider themselves "hardcore" and maintaining an active world presence. People will know exactly who we are.
---
We are a Raid first, PVP second guild, though have a very strong emphasis on PVP. We WILL be leading BG premades and world PVP raids on Alliance towns. We will create, join, or support our server's honor-cartel for those that are interested in PVP-only, once the honor system is introduced. You will find us dueling outside of Orgrimmar. We are looking for challengers. Bring your A-game :)
---
LOOT:
---
We will be using an EPGP/Loot Council hybrid with a minimum point requirement to obtain loot, along with a point-decay. Loot Council gets final say over gear distribution, though EPGP scores are heavily weighted. A random raid member will join Loot Council for the night by /rolling 1-40 at the start of every raid for that night only. 
---
SERVER: Faerlina (tentative)

RAID SCHEDULE: 
---
Wed 6:30-9:30EST, Fri 6:30-9EST, Sun 6-9EST
---
Please message me for more info
---
No it blows.
---
I think people just want to get to where they left off.
---
Maraudon also has a great Pre-BiS sword that any Rogue should be targetting, so I can see why they have made it super obvious its going to be at Launch
---
I mainly play horde because the character models and architecture of each race feels more diverse...and I have to admit it does feel a bit like playing an underdog. But less "a bad guy decides to do good" and more "a motley crew gets together and saves the world".
---
On the alliance you get several heights of similar looking humanoids; normal, tall, short and tiny. There are obviously differences between them but they aren't as dramatic as the models between orc, tauren, forsaken and troll.
---
That was also a previous generation of orcs, under different leadership, mislead and under the control of demonic influence. The Horde is a different beast now than it was 30 years ago.
---
On the 12th day, I wanna make a bathroom acapella of this song.
---
weren't the codes 1 use only?
---
no
---
I'm speaking from the general leveling feel of a paladin which is seal, auto, judge, seal, watch Netflix on second monitor for 20 seconds.
---
Considering 90% of the paladin player base is going to be doing this, I'd say it's a great idea.
---
Granted getting it asap wouldn't make much sense, but waiting until level 55 to start getting it is a huge waste.
---
I’m already having nightmares about getting my Briarwood Reed
---
You do - I discovered this the hard way during the stress test
---
I like the long braid personally!
---
Apes dont have a sprawling, massive civilization. They also didnt evolve because of a massive arcane wound in the planet, as far as I'm aware. Your argument is bad.
---
Now that's what I need. Cheers bro!
---
As a soon to be human warlock, I'm looking forward to this.
---
Because they became dead and then someone hit the undo button and so they undid the dead so they shortened 'undid dead' to 'undead'.
---
True facts.
---
Not true.
---
Shamans are super easy to get into raids. But healers always have it easy you should play what you want.
---
I for myself think that the biggest mistake was that each dungeon can be visited in 'light-mode' and that the easiest game modes (LFR) is far too easy. This new "feature" completely removes the aspect of feeling that you achieved something even when you only reached a specific point/boss in a raid once while not killing it. When we reached Nefarian for the first time....man.....
---
Does anyone know when the phases are timed for? Excited for layering to be gone but also want to make sure I have enough time to level my PvP class before PvP comes out
---
For those saying not to send care packages because it's their job and they chose this.  Then stop giving gifts to nurses, doctors, oh and teachers....i mean we have an entire week where everyone donates gifts to teachers for thanking them.  Why? They're getting paid for that job, they knew of the  salary before signing up.  So by your logic, stop teacher appreciation week!
---
Who cares what charity he wants to do?  Anyone can do any charity for whatever organization they want.  If you don't like it then just don't support it.  
---
It's a waste of energy to come here and write mean things.   Wasted energy that could be used spreading positivity somewhere else.
---
I just don't understand why people feel the need to write negative comments on posts they don't agree with....I never take the time to do that.  I really don't understand it....
---
I only comment on posts i do agree with and scroll past ones i don't like.
---
I do support our military, just like anyone should support their own military.  So I support any charity that supports our military....and you should for your country's as well.
---
It didn't work for me either... It kept saying the Server were locked after they went online...
---
Then went ahead to try and enter the locked Server (smart as you would expect alliance to be) and couldn't get it, nor get back to the realm list.
---
After that I went to bed and settled with knowing that my Name is going to be something like Xxbackstabborxx
---
Only one monitor? You are in for a boring grind!
---
I work in software in a non-customer facing role, so it's anticipated that I look like basement dweller anyway. Feasible.
---
And when you told her it was a map, you withheld what kind of map. Deception doesn’t really fall under respect either. 
---
Just kinda weird you had to ask permission in a round about way rather than say “hey I’d like a wow map above my pc because classic is about to be released”. 
---
I’m also married btw and we both communicate what our intentions are. 
---
A 5x4 ft mirror sounds dumb as hell tho above a fireplace I’ll give you that. But it’s in the common room I’m assuming, and she’s not the primary user of the fireplace I bet.
---
Yeah, well I guess it all boils down to the fact that I would have much more loved a "Classic 1.5" than straight up Classic. And I would have even more loved a TBC relaunch than a Classic one.  
---
I'm still gonna play, but it's clearly not the version of WoW I prefer out of them all. So yeah, my vision is kinda warped and I lean towards "not strictly classic things".  
---
I guess if you're a "Vanilla Purist" you're fundamentally against the things I advocate. So that makes sense.
---
Gear &gt; Talents
---
If you switch gear you will be almost as good at killing stuff. Its not a big difference at all.
---
Thanks for the feedback :) I will keep that in mind.
---
Not all of us have the best internet. Chicago vs California can make more of a difference than you think. Especially for those living in the sticks.
---
6 nelfs a leapin
---
Only instead of seconds long it needs to be like 6 hours.
---
The advantage of hunters is that they can solo almost all elite quests.
---
Need to kill 1 elite guy at the end of a questchain for massive exp at 3:21 am? No problem for a hunter. Whereas a different class you might not find a party.
---
Its pretty rough not having a normal rez for 5 mans and having the optimal raid spec be healing focused. Also your heal is like 2 full seconds slower than the other two healers..
---
I like playing healers and would prefer to use druid as that, but the above two issues really stick out like a sore thumb at end game.
---
Minding their own business in Durotar mind you. He was in his back yard and some purple thot with a weapon shows up.
---
He was acting in defense!  My boy is innocent!
---
I think you mean Unregistered Hypercam 2.
---
Did you read his post? He said while at work AND while driving home.
---
In a similar boat - if I wasn't already guilded I'd suggest making &lt;Lifeline Medical Alert&gt;
---
Why do you want high armor as healer?
---
Xyshina and Card, those are names I haven't heard in a long time.  BL will be returning to the alliance on Herod with many of the old school guys returning.
---
Who is arguing is was not in Vanilla at some point? Off topic
---
Imagine writing a fucking whiny white knight retort
---
Hey! Can I get a pm too ;) ! Cheers
---
This is how I feel too. Just brand new stuff with the vanilla core. Also no level cap so to make every at 60 irrelevant.
---
Lol I wish, that’d make working here a bit more interesting
---
Yeah I don't think the same implementation would work as well for Blizzard as it did Jagex.
---
Priest is a better healer in raids, but every raid should have at least one Druid.  Priests are good at pvp, healing and damage, shadow is lots of fun and strong.  
---
I mained as a shadow priest in Vanilla, I’m maining a HotW Druid in Classic so I can do everything in one spec just not as well as the pure classes.  I know what I’m getting into though, I would recommend you familiarize yourself with the drawbacks of druids before rolling one so your expectations will be in line with reality.
---
Too bad no more Linkin' Park for the extra edge.
---
Seriously OP, be smarter than this.
---
It's not worth the potential risk to other people around you just because you can't wait to get home to play a game. 
---
Cmon now.
---
Ok, that makes more sense. 
---
Yes, you have several points, where you can switch to holy (after PoJ, after conviction + imp ret aura or after 2h-spec) and as an inexperienced or casual palyer getting focus relatively early is a good idea.
---
Nope, you're playing the game.
---
I agree with all you write on this matter.
---
I personally don't want Classic to be QoL improved because "it won't affect anybody."
---
To me, Vanilla was the way it was, and Classic is supposed to follow it for us to re-live what it was.
---
You're not supposed to get your QoL improvements or cosmetic improvements. You are given a certain amount of tools and that is what you have to survive with, not stand there and yell for more and more because "it won't affect anybody else."
---
Vanilla was a lot of decision making, and your choices had an effect on you and your character. Nothing you could just reset with the blink of an eye or pay with cash.
---
For me it’s because I don’t want to be up incredibly late with a guild. My BFA guild isn’t playing classic, so I’m gonna be rocking with a new guild. If the raids are 9PM-12PM and I’m on a pacific server, I can’t stay up raiding from 12-3.
---
But all the realms are full
---
we have a guild of 10+ people so far, doing alliance PVP come join our discord if you want
---

I feel “two faction hubs” sings a little better when you go through the full verse
---
We don't know yet. EST or PST servers could be in either Datacentre.
---
If you want to guess, a PST realm is probably a better chance though.

Won't matter if you join a guild needing the class. Both will get into raid. Windfury/Manatide totem is strong enough you'll see quite a few be in raid. Play what you want to play more. I went priest but my alt will be a shaman. Remember a good healer will be brought to raid regardless of class.
---
&gt; Yeah, well I guess it all boils down to the fact that I would have prefered a "Classic 1.5" than straight up Classic. And I would have even more loved a TBC relaunch than a Classic one. 
---
And that's a totally fair point. My point is simply why even barbershop would be a problem, the thing is even minor changes can be big to some people - we are all different. I can totally understand that you'd prefer 1.5, but that's just not the goal with Classic and never was. Personally I'd love a TBC relaunch post-Naxx, I loved that xpac. My love for WoW came through the druid class, which I love in all xpacs - but not vanilla. WoW 2.0 post-Naxx could also be really fun.
---
&gt; I guess if you're a "Vanilla Purist" you're fundamentally against the things I advocate. So that makes sense. 
---
To be completely honest, I'm not. I could easily think of a few changes I'd personally like, but I understand why it would be a bad idea. I understand that just like how you think barbershop is fine and I would not, my changes would probably be annoying to someone. I understand the philosophy for Classic is WoW recreated, not WoW 1.5. It's more that since I don't want the vast majority of changes, I can accept that my changes won't be there either. I'm probably closer to a "vanilla purist" than you, though - which might be why our opinions differ so much.
---
I am in the horde because I follow Thrall
---
Oh no 😂
---
Well, let's say they hypothetically kept adding dungeons to Vanilla until there were 100 of them. They would first of all spread them out among level brackets, giving more options for leveling characters, fresh 60s, and geared 60s. Also, the newer max level dungeons/raids would invalidate gear from older dungeons/raids, so the subset of desirable dungeons in your level/gear bracket becomes much more reasonable, perhaps fewer than a dozen options. So you find people for that 1 out of 100 dungeons either because it's in the zone in which you're leveling and other people want to do the quests, or because you're a fresh 60 and the other ungeared 60s are trying to catch up with the higher ilvl in the latest catch up dungeon, or because you're geared out and running the latest challenging content with everybody who's also into that content.
---
I'll pile on here as well :)
---
Ah I remember having the bat and I remember people hating me for having it just forgot where it came from
---
Sorry I was not suggesting they should be higher than currently allowed for, just disagreeing that then increasing them above classic levels is what is causing the issue Herod is facing.
---
I mean, its the same with the people who talk down about others who decided not to have kids. Chill people will be chill, others will be judgmental assholes
---
This will only be my 4th time leveling fishing. I just believe strongly every character should have it, especially if you're a hunter. There is so much downtime near water sources in high level zones - I just always have my fishing pole ready to grab a little bit of cash out of the ocean.
---
My go to races in WoW are Gnomes and Tauren. Why ? Because they're the most fantastical. I enjoy the fantasy of being a big brutish beast and an annoying little shit. Most of the other races are just humans with some heightened features.
---
Also, Paladins suck and Shamans are awesome.
---
Having only 3 character slots, I'm sad to think I can't twink one of them. A main, an alt for money making- gathering, and a banker. Will they add a more character slots?
---
Along with 4) She doesn't exist.
---
Cool what server you going on
---
Was his name Thex?
---
If you're alliance, getting many of your skill ups is rather trivial. Whenever you're waiting for a ship to travel, just pull out your fishing pole and cast a few times. When the ship arrives, you have enough time to finish your last cast and generally get onto the ship and make 1 more cast from the side of the ship. I would recommend making your casts off to the side so that when the ship arrives, it doesn't block your most recent cast.
---
Wake me when 6,969 comes. It’s much closer. Back to hibernation.
---
Let’s see, horde have 4 completely unique character models and alliance have humans, dwarves (smaller humans), gnomes (even smaller humans), and night elves (tall humans with pointy ears).
---
I don’t want to play a human in the world of warcraft
---
I didn't miss the point, was just correcting the fact that it isn't the 27th for ALL of the EU. Uk peeps reading your post could well have missed launch by an hour and ended up in 100000000+ server queues :P You know 'Because of timezones'...
---
My guild said they will gladly come protect me so I may be good bait :3
---
Flair is accurate af.
---
I’M GOING ON AN ADVENTURE~
---
Same idea only with pubes
---
Having had that dream job for several years, this kid is ahead of the curve.  I loved getting to talk with players who showed this kind of enthusiasm, that level of excitement is what makes the job awesome.
---
Hope he gets to answer my tickets this time instead of the other way around! ;)
---
I'll be doing this with teamviewer 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Right the number of layers will match the number of accounts they cap the servers at.  No reason to have infinite layers if there aren't infinite players.   Phase 1 should not have problems with queues, Phase 2 will have a different problem (a good problem) if the server population is still so high that layering is needed to avoid queues.  That would be awesome and I hope that is the case because that means there are enough people who are playing to keep classic alive and everyone who wants to experience all the content will have enough people to do it with. There are private servers that have 5000-6000 active accounts that only have 2000 players online at any one time because most people are going to log on and play for 1-3 hours and they are not all going to overlap.   
---
Think about it if there are only enough people for 1 layer (3500ish seems to be the number I have seen per layer) then split that by half for each faction then half again for geared level 60 players you will have 800 people.  That's 20 raid groups.  That is way more than I can remember being active in Vanilla.  On Sargeras I can only think of about 10 top guilds that were actually actively keeping up with progression.  I have a feeling the active folks will be much lower.
---
But what if I have jump bound to my brake pedal?
---
Not at all.
---
Last I checked Trolls didn't have a sprawling massive civilization anymore, especially in Kalimdor.
---
&gt;They also didnt evolve because of a massive arcane wound in the planet
---
I don't see how the method of evolution is relevant to the right to hold lands.
---
&gt; They 100% inspect subscribers with a downloaded client + non-subscribers with a downloaded client, because they're not dumb. This is not perfect data, but it's more than you are giving them credit for.
---
Can price it that high but no one will have that much spare gold for awhile.
---
I use  [http://i.imgur.com/1QVxr.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/1QVxr.jpg)
---
There is plate armor specifically designed for Paladins to wear for Holy / Healing.
---
I missed the 'most', so my bad on that.
---
What is it supposed to rhyme with?
---
What does your suggestion rhyme with?
---
Druid and Priest have different jobs in pvp and pve.  Go youtube some videos, especially from Ebbnflow.

Fair enough but that's gonna be a tough sell, because I think most people view that as doing a multi billion dollar company's market research for it. I subbed for my name (also arguably dumb) which is one thing, but donating to allow for business decisions is another.
---
You got unread mail
---
Is it like an rp thing because you dont need armor in raids unless you are tanking.
---
stealth just as invis does not drop projectiles nor does it drop a pet from you that already got an attack order
---
only the vanish_purge syntax replaces your character entity
---
Chaos theory was my favorite. Played double agent too. Tried to get into metal gear, I couldnt do it. I liked watching my friends play it a lot though
---
Yeah, my desk and setup have limitations. 😞

Just make a macro on your mouse.

Also the is no point in this cus queues will shrink after initial launch queue

I think TwitchSpeak is an entire language built on the foundation of a single syllable: Pog. Which is a game I thought had died out sometime in the 90’s.

This happened to me as well, had to complete remove the [battle.net](https://battle.net) app and reinstall it.

Pls somebody edit this with erp

BC was the best form of warcraft though, all the issues here were fixed. vanilla is still way fucking better than retail though
---
Thanks for bringing this up! I read about the setting being toned down for Classic and that there was a way to revert to the original setting, but forgot about it again. I'll definitely adjust it back to how it used to be, I'm pretty sure adult me can handle a level of violence that 8-year-old me was able to handle lol.

Too many

Thanks I'm going orc soul link in a week, this is hype

Our guild used to bring a Chinese farmer to raids with us to fill a spot. They spoke no English but we created the best geared Chinese farmer on the server( that we knew of). They usually died early on in the fight but still got loot rather than us disenchanting it. They would give us random stuff for taking them to raids. 
---
Good times
---
Kinda wish they didn't crunch you at all. Stay safe and healthy, friends. It's thanks to you that we can even get any of this.
---
You don't know, though. They might just be ahead of schedule. Much more likely to be if it's a rerelease, too.
---
What iteration of the map is this now? Here is an idea, take your time and do it right once, stop spamming with the sub with 5 versions of the map because you're trigger happy and want to farm as much karma as you can.
---
The map is helpful and a nice addition to anyone's resources but fuck sake at this point...
---
Yes. You have to raise with lures and the +25 fishing pole to not get trash.

I love the WoW subreddit.

"Wasting time": learning an actual language.

"Serious stuff": launch of a video game.

" I am here for the journey again and look forward to rediscovering Azeroth and how to gear/spec my characters through trial and error. "
---
This is great, if only all players felt this way. It is all well and good until you hit 60, go to do your first "real" level 60 dungeon or battleground, and are yelled at by randoms for not knowing everything perfectly. I sincerely hope the vanilla community slows down a little bit and isn't so toxic like the retail community is.
---
Still currently used at least once in the stress test :)
---
That’s my hometown and I just feel so embarrassed this happened to you. It is unacceptable that in a city that literally lives off tourism people can’t speak basic English. I wish I could say that English education is improving in my country, but honestly, I’m not seeing it happening.
---
Hope you still had a great time, though :)

The More You Know!
---
I'm curious, as you're someone who was likely one of the earliest people on this sub to play WoW, what's your history like with it? Did you quit at any point? If so, why?
---
Solid feedback imo.
---
I’d win this for sure. It’ll take months for me to hit 60.  Family life and work. Only a few hours a few days of the week.  And I’m Irish. Beard gets very beardy after a week of not shaving.
---
At that level there's not even that much of a difference in your damage output between using a bow and melee, especially with your pet.
---
The way I see it all the people resubbing on launch will roll Stalagg, filling it up. So why should I risk losing my friends/names by transferring now?
---
I am playing both! Planning on casually leveling both classes at the same time. But if that’s not your thing and you are going to focus on one class I would say Druid.
---
You basically are a swiss army knife, stealth, travel form, dot’s, hot’s, be a rogue! Melee not your thing? Ok become a giant chicken caster. Want to tank? Do it. Want to heal? You can do that too!
---
Innervate is a must for raids as well, so don’t worry about not getting a spot.
---
Hello, I am an Alliance player playing on &lt;Faerlina&gt; looking for a guild for me and some buddies to join. We are active players looking for a place to raid semi hardcore but mainly will be PvPing and pushing for high ranks (once released). We are in our mid twenties and are mature competent players.
---
I played last stress test and the early (before lvl 15) money I made from vendoring leather was like twice as much as what I would get from every other source.
---
Don't bank your leather, vendor it.
---
Honestly, that being 45s was absurd for what level you can get it at. Im pretty sure BRD should still be fine. The amount of gph should still be at least 40 or 50
---
Yeah, they fixed the bug that meant they weren't on previously.
---
I’ve seen a few things around for saving gold by not training higher ranks of over power rend and thunderclap nothing really on price tho.
---
I honestly think it won't be awful. People will be competing for mobs and some lines may form. There will probably be queues. It'll be reasonable though, I feel.
---
Cool, unfortunately it also removes/changes certain facial features, such as the iron/bone jaw which i'm using. So i dunno if i'll be using it.

I figured because Character models look cooler than the Alliance. I've always preferred Alliance because I found Iron Forge &amp; Stormwind to be cooler looking cities than the refugee camp looking Ogrimmar.

There's hardly anything at 60 that you requires you to go around killing mobs in the world.

This is 4 hours slower than the current world record.

Personally I always thought dishonorable kills were a mistake, especially pebalizing the entire group with them. They already have unkillable kids, they should have just made "civilian" NPCs unkillable too and be done with it.

---
It's apparently double-sided (and quite expensive)
---
yes, but isn't it viable with the understanding that it would be more "efficient" to give cloth healing gear to priests and mail/plate to paladins to maximize total gain from drops?
---
When you kill them are they un-undead or re-dead?
---
If I could get a pc I’d be able to play. Anyone willing to part with a pc I’ll level them a character to 60 or something

IMO flying is one of the things that ruined the feeling of a coherent world.

Sounds like the vanilla experience

Ehhhhh

Couldn’t agree more. I’ve forgotten a lot of those good mates and their names, but I’ll never forget Baseballman.
---
He mentioned that his room is air conditioned.  Who needs AC in January?
---
PKing is actively, and exclusively, used in Runescape pvp. You aren't that special.
---
Most of the people in my guild in vanilla were in their late 20s or older at the time. I was the youngest by a lot at 16. So if they come back it'll be a bunch of people in their 40s and 50s.
---
The beta was one giant advert. One of the most played things on Twitch for most of the duration.
---
Aside from that, they already have an absolute tidal wave of people that are gonna play at launch. More advertising will likely kick in once the first wave of tourists leave and the servers chill out a bit.
---
Do it!
---
I actually messed up the timing so day 12 will be posted on Sunday the 25th. Would be cool to have someone actually sing it and post it on the 26th!

The truth is that after the dust has settled, nostalgia's worn off, and the population stabilizes, Herod will probably be one of the few vibrant realms with a healthy population. The dropoff is going to be ENORMOUS.
---
Mind = blown, however, who or what is then unliving?
---
No problem. You're totally right, I was thinking the honor system, which is phase 2.
---
Well I think they don't expect Classic to be such a huge hit yet. They don't want to overinvest into something that turns out as a miss...
---
I have no clue though - just a guess

Friends and family extend further than just your children. I have 3 siblings, 6 cousins, 6 nephews and nieces so far, with many more likely. Not really worried about having no blood relationships later in life.

This was awesome lol

I don’t want anyone to read the ToS for me. I was asking if people know this from experience.

There are adverts. Seen some on Instagram. I guess they are just not that often pushed.

He will love it if you let him go nuts on the game for a week and will love it even more if you help him go nuts ( I.e., take care of chores, make him food, etc.)
---
But half of the point of playing a hybrid is that you shouldn’t be competing with other people for most of your gear. A month ago, someone posted a pretty short and sweet guide for enhance shammies in raids. It was all about getting enough of a balance stat wise to give you mana to keep dpsing, heal when needed, and provide some kind of buff, IE nightfall and windfury. But the main point it drilled into our heads, was that you *never* want to take loot that would go to a rogue or even hunter. There are many pieces the rogue and hunter won’t  want because it’s too... hybridized. 
---
Perhaps it’s less true for some specs than others, but a lot of the benefit of having less viable specs is that they can get the gear that hard dps doesn’t want.
---
It's not stop trying to be cool when you have little to no idea how raiding worked or will work.
---
Obviously both solutions are not against tos
---
A ton of people have been posting advertisements they’ve seen on here for the last few weeks, mainly social media promoted ads.
---
It doesn’t make a lot of sense to do commercials for Classic
---
Not to mention, why would her husband be playing Horde while their son is Alliance?  Wouldn't it make sense for them to be playing together?

That was my first thought aswell, layering will help with que times, until they made this post:

" login queues in excess of 10,000 players are a certainty, and possibly much higher than that. "  
---
"While we are able to fit several times more players on a single realm in  2019 than was the case in 2006, we are not going to raise that cap any  further, even though we have the technical capacity to do so. Raising  realm caps would simply forestall the problem, letting more players in  at launch but creating an unsustainable situation down the line, with  severe queues when we turn off layering permanently before Phase 2 of  our content unlock plan. "  
---
After re-reading this i see what i missed, my misstake! But it still seems that they have a maximum amount of layers they can use. Otherwise this would not be a problem until Phase 2 and the whole post should have been written differently.
---
&gt; almost never used my wand
---
A good, holy and chaste Priest never does!
---
We'll all be paying 15$ a month to wait in line, so not a big deal really.
---
I’d agree that EQ was harder and a bigger investment at launch than WoW was at launch. 
---
However, having played both an EQ 1x XP TLP and a vanilla WoW 1x private server within the last few years, I feel really confident in saying that vanilla WoW is much harder than EQ both in leveling and raiding when vast amounts of information is available.
---
Now that I think about it tho, that’s probably mostly from travel time. After the noob zone in EQ you go to 3 or 4 zones: Crushbone -&gt; Unrest -&gt; LGuk -&gt; The Hole if you are feeling frisky but you can hit 50 in LGuk no problem. Obviously WoW asks you to move around way, way more.
---
“Harder” - to me - usually boils down to how much of my time the game asks for to be at the tip of the spear. Like you said, both games are hella easy from a mechanical standpoint. And I think Vanilla WoW asks for way, way more of your time to be a top dog than early EQ does.
---
1% is fucking 30,000 dmg!
---
I had considered doing "5 molten dogs", but after the fallout from yesterday I didn't want to take too much liability, lol.
---
Accurately guessing exactly how many servers are needed from the start is damn near impossible and would easily result in some dead servers right from the start if they overestimate. Way more efficient to guess low and open more servers as needed.
---
But none of that even actually matters. Adding more servers wouldn't have prevented this situation since the existing ones aren't even full yet but people are overcrowding Herod anyways.
---
I saw an add for classic on the classic wow subreddit side bar. That's it. I've actually had to let several people know about classic because the had no idea it was coming out.
---
Yeah but how many times had he done that with no issue? A pretty high success rate makes it a successful strat imo
---
I (paladin) mainly healed in vanilla, but my raid leader was always fine with me respeccing retribution for DPS when I wanted. My main spec was holy/prot, and I was always happy to jump in and off tank when the raid needed it. I actually tanked our first Nefarian kill just before TBC hit, it was amazing!
---
Not all raid guilds are super hardcore, some are much more laid back.
---
Basically works like mage invisibility as I recall.
---
Many leaders of the alliance wanted/want to genocide orcs and forsaken.
---
What about my buttcrack? Can I still shave that? I enjoy the smooth pooping experience.
---
I've never felt so much for gaming as I do with Classic release!
---
Average for a dungeon leveling group is looking to be like ~6d.
---
If you are solo questing and actually leveling I'm thinking average will be 7d.
---
10d is massively high.
---
Thats funny I was thinking on rushing this too, but i wasnt gonna say anything cause I didnt want to put the idea in everyone elses head.
---
reserved all my names there, im very excited

Looking for Committed Players for Dungeon Grind Group.
---
We will be aiming to speed-level from 12 to 60 using the dungeon grind guide created by "Hakurai" which is an amazing source and will cost you the joining players nothing. Due to a recent change in circumstance we are looking for new players to fill the roster.
---
Current Roster ;  
---
Resto Shammy  
---
Warrior Tank/DPS  
---
Warrior DPS
---
We will be playing 24 - 30 Hours as an initial Stint, but will then be playing up to 16hr/day. Aiming for 60 around the 1st or 2nd of Sept.

\[H\] PVE SERVER PAGLE | CASUAL ADULTS | &lt;THE DARK KNIGHTS&gt;
---
Yeah, you read that right - I am looking for casual adults just wanting to team up, guild up, and have some fun playing in classic with zero pressure and 100% understanding that most of us are older adults with jobs, careers, families, and other things that need our attention away from the game.
---
I looked for *DAYS* trying to find something like this here, but anything that comes close to this is either on another server (US West PST) or the Alliance. I am all about blood and honor, for the Horde! However, everyone wants hardcore or semi-hardcore raiders for horde side on the PvE servers.
---
I get it, I really do. I just don’t have time for it. I am sure a lot of other people don’t either. This is why I am here - to create a home where we can all hang out, level up, group up, chill out, and have fun doing so casually.
---
**Goals as a Guild:**
---
* No rush to level up
---
* Play as Horde characters
---
* Play casually and enjoy the journey
---
* Help clanmates reach High Warlord in PvP
---
* Raid when we get there and have the time
---
* Play on USEast PvE server Pagle (or Mankrik if Pagle full)
---
* Make friends, team up, accomplish goals as an in-game family
---
We encourage you to play what you want and when you want, there's no obligation (aside from obvious rules such as behavior). We have over 50 dedicated members ready to go at launch! Everyone is very friendly and welcoming.
---
As far as our existing members, most of us have a family and a full time job so we aren't on all the time. We have many warriors, mages and hunters, but again, play what you want! All professions are covered as well. As I mentioned before, there are no obligations so do whatever you please :)

Playing on LH and it's BWL time. We're about to pull Razorgore when someone hits us up that the mountain's full of a Horde raid and another guild's having trouble getting past them. So we roll out from BWL the same time as the other guild pushes from Searing Gorge. The slaughter was magnificent.
---
Get those stop cast macros ready.
---
a) tens of millions didn't play in Vanilla b) On PvP server you could only have one faction, and couldn't communicate cross faction so she'd have to have deleted his char and created a new one on Horde all the while this 9 year old had perfect recall of his chars name. 
---
It's bullshit.
---
They stomp. But they are so few and far between it does not matter.
---
Lol.
---
They're advertising on Facebook and Instagram (I know this because I've seen it here on Reddit) but I wonder why I haven't seen any on Youtube, for example. Seems no brainer to me, even more so than the former.
---
Lets all personally blacklist BeethovenTheMage for being aids

There's probably already multiple people with the same idea. You also have to account for the time it may take if you get stuck in a queue and someone else gets through.
---
**&lt;ZANCOR&gt;[HORDE][FAIRBANKS-PVP][HARDCORE RAIDING][PST]**
---
**Who are we?**
---
Ladies, gentlemen, trolls, orcs, demons, whathaveyous...We are Zancor Gaming, a newly formed gaming community that is itching to hit up the glory days of classic WoW in full force. We are a dedicated bunch looking to push top tier end game content and have a blast while doing so. Who knows ...maybe you’ll make a few lifelong friends along the way. We’re about having fun, meeting new people, and kicking ass. Our player base mainly comprises of individuals between 25-32 years of age with a variety of gameplay experience.
---
We welcome both battle hardened Warcraft players and those who are just joining our world. We foster an atmosphere of teaching those who are learning and doing their best every time they show up, if we’re not improving, then we’re not doing our job.
---
**Who are you folks looking for?**
---
First and foremost ...we’re a raiding guild. This means we eat, sleep, and dream PVE and dragon slaying strategies. We’re not super hardcore raiders pulling long hours into the night, but we aren’t for the faint of heart either. We will test your mettle and push you to become the best WoW player you can be. We ask that our members maintain a positive attitude and keep their eye on the prize, slaying bosses. New players can be molded into great raiders, but great attitudes can be hard to come by, we don’t care if you’re new to classic, as long as you’ve got a positive attitude and a willingness to learn. Do not be afraid to ask questions, today's students may be tomorrow's masters.
---
**Raid times?**
---
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday **8:30pm-11:00pm PST**.
---
Monday(Optional cleanup AKA “The Chungus Raid”) **8:30pm-10:30pm PST**
---
*3 Day lockout raid scheduling will be determined closer to the phase 2 patch.*
---
**What are your expectations?**
---
We expect our members to conduct themselves appropriately both in guild level chats as well as in public. Our members represent our guild to the public and each one should show nothing but respect and understanding to the general player community. Friendly ribbing is fine, but please keep it ToS friendly...we don’t need our friends being banned!
---
We also expect high raid attendance with minimal tardiness. Real life happens, we get it, if you need to miss a raid just let someone know before we start forming and you’ll be excused with no penalty. When we start forming, we expect raiders to come prepared with consumes, enchants, buffs(World buffs not required), and knowledge of our boss strategies. Failure to do so could result in a loss of EP for that specific raid being run. Our goal is to get our first raid up by week 3 or 4 of release, we’re not expecting everyone to bend over backwards and get to 60 and get geared up by week 1, but if you want to, you’ll have some buds to play with along the way.
---
*We also expect clear comms on boss attempts, call outs and communication are key when there are forty raiders in one channel. Banter and whatever else is fine during trash, but we expect to move through content like we’ve done this before… Because we have.*
---
**How about the loot system?**
---
We will be using EPGP with a whitelist. The whitelist is for items such as legendaries, certain BiS items, and tier set completions, when those instances arise, the loot council will make the decision of who gets what. The loot council consists of Officers/Class Leaders, and 3 raiders picked randomly each week to represent their fellow raiders, the GM will step in to break any ties.
---
Raiders can bonus EP each week for showing up early, with world buffs, and by contributing raid mats to the guild bank.
---
**What are you looking for?:**
---
**High Priority:** Holy Priests, Fury Warriors, 1 feral druid(Who can OT), Mages (Need a shitload), Rogues (Also need a shitload)
---
**Mid Priority:**Resto Druid, Resto Shamans, Shadow Priest
---
**Low Priority:** Warlocks, Hunters
---
**That sounds great! Where can I sign up?**
---
You can start with telling us a little about yourself [here!](https://forms.gle/cRucWvvKFSCrFDCb9)
---
You can also visit our discord if you have any questions. You can find that [here](https://discord.gg/73nsMgh)

I played my balls off during the beta as I had no responsibilities other than going to community college for a few hours a day.  I'll never forget the excitement as I read that invitation email.  I was running around screaming.
---
Nostalgia aside, vanilla was by far the most fun times I had in WoW.  I was a hardcore raider who played for 2 guilds: my main guild during normal raiding hours (roughly 6-10pm) and an Australian guild where raid times were normally at 2am.  There were days I didn’t get to bed until after 7am.  I was doing MC and BWL clears with my main guild and regularly running 20 mans and occasional AQ40 and Naxx runs with the aussie guild.  Never had any conflicts as the raid leader of the aussie gulid was highly respected as the previous raider leader of my main guild (he left to make his own Aussie-based guild…with a few Americans sprinkled in).
---
TBC was also a ton of a fun, as was WotLK.  I did take one 3-month break in my subscription during TBC to focus on my last few months of college - and in doing so missed the 10-year anniversary toy Blizzard sent out.  My dad got his in the mail though.  He also played the game full-time as a retired educator.  
---
Cata is where my guild started falling apart and raids were very infrequent.  I hated that Blizzard destroyed the old zones during the cataclysm and by the time I got to MoP, I was pretty much done raiding.  For me, the game started losing its luster with each expansion after WotLK as the game felt more and more watered down.  I quit playing altogether toward the end of MoP and resubbed for the first few weeks of WoD to hit the level cap with one character with my 2 best friends - who also played with me for the entirety of my time in WoW, post-launch... but the magic was gone.  We played and quit together.  We never tried Legion, but we are primed and ready to relive the magic of Classic WoW.

Matter of fact, I just had them both visit from out of state this last weekend and WoW was a major topic of discussion during their time here.  We can’t wait to dive back in!

Missing an opportunity to show someone DCing because their pre-paid time at the internet cafe ran out.

Keep tabs on your faction's multiboxers and alert them to other boxers on the opposite faction. I've found in the past that these folks are often interested in testing their opponent's mettle and will come lend support.
---
You can do everything at lvl 1, so what you're suggesting is definitely doable. 
---
But dont expect to be alone there, a rule of thumb is, if you're thinking it, someone else is probably also.
---
Razor, Vael, Supression + Broodlord, Chromaggus, and Nef are all pretty demanding areas. Not mind shatteringly hard, but thats only really 3 bosses where you can have brain dead people, and that’s smack dab in the center of the raid.
---
&gt; The difference is that the "bad stuff" that the alliance does is isolated to individuals or small groups who are condemned and differ from the group at large.
---
i know this is stuff from Retail but:
---
Lady Jaina Proudmoore killed a bunch of Sunreaver Blood Elf civilians in Dalaran because Garrosh had used their resources to sneak into Darnassus and steal a Bell. she then, along with Genn and Mathias, goes along to kill King Rastakhan *before* he allies with the horde. and instead of facing justice for those crimes Jaina expects horde forces to work with her to free her new cow friend from prison (who is only in prison because he committed treason), and when she is actually held accountable for killing those Sunreavers she kills the people accusing her of the crime.
---
there are several times the alliance leaders have done things that are considered "Bad Stuff" and gotten away with it due to various reasons
---
I recall being on the receiving end of that situation, not in a BG though. Didn't mind the death because it was truly epic. However, if I see it again it would just be annoying.
---
So much this. I have friends that are like 'oh damn its 15 a month?' meanwhile its less than their bar tab for the night. sigh

Why would I be excited for multiboxers? They're pretty fucking immersion breaking and I'll report all of them no matter what the current rules are.
---
I'll never forget what ended warcraft for me. It was in the lich king expansion. 10 from my guild got to level 80 and we went inside Naxxramus. We got to the first boss easy enough but he kept overpowering us and we couldn't figure out how to out heal the incoming damage with 2 healers, it just didn't seem possible. 
---
Then somebody noticed we had set the mode to 25 man instead of 10. We exited the instance, set it to 10 and cake walked through it. The sense of accomplishment after having done most of the content from launch to that point had just kind of evaporated. I stopped leading my guild/raid and only logged on sporadically after that.
---
I posted a really long thread called the decadence of world of warcraft on the blizzard forums after that raid. The game had become about a rush to get gear and no longer about a game to play.
---
Oh yeah you are right my bad. It was a tiny bar under the XP bar now that I remember it
---
easy kill
---
They re-released Onyxia as a level 80 raid during Wrath.
---
Holy priest.
---
Most other classes are pretty braindead to play in raids. Even prot warris will only spam sunder and heroic.
---
THe only part I really loved about playing my Hunter way, way back in the day was the kiting. Especially Drakki in UBRS.

That and staring at nelf booty all day long. Life was wholesome in Vanilla x).

I went from pally to warrior to hunter to mage then back to pally

Pro tips to be the dungeon tank everyone loves;
---
1. Be willing to be in front of the group and leading the way, marking targets, calling for CC, all those things. A passive tank standing in the back makes for a painful run.
---
2. Always check healer mana as a pull is winding down. If they are low, pause to let them drink. Go ahead and set up any CC necessary. Your downtime should just about only be limited by healer mana or if someone calls for an afk.
---
3. Don’t be that guy that power trips because they are the tank. Happens all the time. You are valuable, but not irreplaceable. 
---
4. When in doubt, give yourself more space than necessary. Most accidental pulls are because you didn’t move back and a patrol came by, a mob ran away, or a pet or dps went awol. Find your safe spot, even if it’s in the previous room, and pull it back. Just let dps know so they don’t start early and pull aggro.
---
5. Try and know the general dungeon path and boss mechanics, since you will be doing a lot of the organizing.
---
I know shadow PC is against ToS and this may be fore the same reason.

---
Yeah I never played hearthstone, but I have played almost every other Blizzard title, and have certainly given them more than enough money over the course of my lifetime.
---
Computers were also a barrier to entry back then. Not barely as much of an issue today.
---
FYI, everyone has pointed out you only get flagged in controlled own faction territories if you manually flag or attack someone...
---
This is not always the case. If you happen to be in the area and players are fighting each other (alliance raid on crossroads for example) and you decide to pitch in by healing your members...despite you not attacking anyone you will be flagged and can then be killed. 
---
I THINK buffing also counts but not sure on that one.
---
What's to keep people from lying?   I've thought about making something like this for EverQuest TLPs, but I don't see an obvious way around people assuming other people's identities.

It won't. It'll only go down from day 1.
---
I know, I dont want any changes from my own personal vanilla experience. I didn't use any addons in vanilla and very few in BC. So I wont personally use many.
---
I tried the corpse run and the portal to the tram revived me at the tram.
---
Gehennas con: APES is playing there, so if you plan on ranking you either join them or play horde
---
Not necessarily, depends on the option I have.
---
Lock is definetely going to have easier time getting into raids and organized PvP environment. Moreover, skilled locks can beat everyone in duels, including shadow priests. Most locks use Affli/Destro (SM/Ruin) build as it is good for both PvP and PvE, or more PvE oriented Demonology/Destro (DS/Ruin) hybrid build. 
---
Pure destro lock with conflag definetely works for PvP with it's insane burst, but the downside is being squishy and inefficient in PvE.
---
Damn, I just realized that I don't really remember any of the raid mechanics for classic WoW. I guess I won't be tanking/healing this time around (judging by this subreddit I am afraid there will be too many priests and warriors everywhere), but I don't think simple "don't stand in fire" will cut it.
---
I figured that guy Boochowewe did same thing as you.
---
Thank you so much! I will look into a threat addon! I have tanked in every game I have played, and in WoW since cata, I’m just super nervous because it looks (and feels) like a completely different game. I feel like tanking and managing threat is very difficult. I played up to 30 once, and in WC i was constantly having to taunt things off of the healer and dps. Wasn’t sure if it was my own fault or if it’s the nature or what, but it definitely makes me anxious haha.
---
I‘m a German and I prefer playing on a german realm. Just a matter of taste, I guess.
---
I legit have been exercising since the start of August in order to kill off some of the time and RLS in the wait for WoW lol. Turns out this was a super good idea. I feel more energetic and less lethargic, which could translate to more time playing and less time sitting brain dead and half asleep all the time.
---
Not Classic, but in TBC I was a Prot Warrior and was in the "B guild" for those who were leveling and getting raid ready. I had just dinged 70 when I got a message from our Guild Leader asking if I could raid Kara because the OT did not show up for the #1 group and the #2 raid group had already started. I had 0 addons, no vent account, no real idea on how to play my warrior effectively and shit gear. Fast forward to the raid and I'm spending minutes on mobs to keep aggro, DPS is having to back off every 10-15 seconds to not pull aggro and the healer is constantly showering me with heals to keep me alive. I died at every boss because I didn't understand the boss mechanics and my internet was soo bad (/y LAG).
---
Regardless of my dead weight, we made it through the bosses we planned on and I learned a ton from that experience. I also got a nice sword from the dragon :)

Don't want to play with South Americans, Don't want to play with streamers pushing them to just 1 server. Complain that their server is overpopulated. NA Logic lol

I've seen promoted ads whenever I load up Twitter on mobile.

Well well well, looks like level 1 duels shall be had.
---
I'm starting to think a lot of the kids who played WoW don't know that there are people older than them. You would think they would be aware of the fact that they have parents, but that fact seems lost on them.

Even the winds of Al'Akir can't stop /u/Joana_WoW.  Glad your okay and sorry about your neighborhood. Keep your head up boss.

Lok'tar, friend
---
Difficulty gives you things you need to think about when you're out in the world. 
---
Maybe avoid that animal that can give you a disease, because it will be inconvenient and make your life that much more difficult. Instead, think about leveling elsewhere or avoiding those mobs to your best ability. 
---
Not being able to use Fireball in certain instances makes you look at the rest of your spellbook and think about other strategies you could use to get what you're after. 
---
Skill is somewhat of a factor, but thoughtfulness and strategizing factor in much higher than skill. It's what makes those RPG elements stand out more over retail, which has become more of a skill based, twitch style game in hitting the right buttons at the right time, rather than stepping back and needing to take a slower, more thoughtful approach.
---
Ok! Awesome. Thank you, I'm very excited to start
---
&gt;Lol how did you know.
---
Just a guess. If your friend really wants to play classic, he could play a private server and make a decision whether or not he wants to spend the money on the official.
---
Every 3 hours? You mean 1time x 12 layers no?
---
But yes you arnt gonna be the only one. Its gonna be hilarious
---
42 year olds represent.
---
I'll continue not shaving, does that work?
---
Thank you so much! Copying a reply i made to another person, because there’s some things I’m curious about that you might know based on your first point. 
---
I have tanked in every game I have played, and in WoW since cata, I’m just super nervous because it looks (and feels) like a completely different game. I feel like tanking and managing threat is very difficult. I played up to 30 once, and in WC i was constantly having to taunt things off of the healer and dps. Wasn’t sure if it was my own fault or if it’s the nature or what, but it definitely makes me anxious haha.
---
committed people can get quite much out of ferals, but honestly i wouldnt bother, takes probably the most effort out of any spec, and im personally not a fan of powershifting. they are also decent offtanks, not rare to see feral tanks in "not too hardcore" guilds.
---
Yeah the decay is simply insane.
---
Why not have all PvP gear for sale for really high amounts of honor? The more pieces you get, the higher your rank/title.
---
This means there is still a massive time investment and no "wellfare" epics, but it does not force you to spend all that time unhealthily in 3 months time, but would allow you to casually spread it out over 2 years for instance.
---
Then a R14 would still represent someone who spent a fuckton of time in battlegrounds, but not necessarily while wearing diapers eating nothing but hot pockets and drinking Dew.
---
Really weird how people seem to be straight up forgetting about Golemagg
---
It will obviously go down from day 1, but I don’t think it will be continuous. My prediction is that it will Peak weak 1, dip back down for 2-3 months, and then slowly climb. 6 years from now, if they released BC and Wrath also, I could easily see the Classic trilogy surpassing live WoW’s traffic.
---
Amen. Preach it brother!
---
Considering retail has no eta on the next patch why would you go back in a week.

#  &lt;Singularity&gt;
---
**About Us:** On the spectrum from Casual Raiders to Hardcore Raiders, we are positioned somewhere in the middle. We will strive to be the most efficient raiding guild on the server to minimize the weekly time commitment for our members. Many of our founding members have been raiding in WoW since 2004. We are also an avid World PVP guild that will plan weekly events to put our hard-earned epics to good use. In terms of server location, we plan to be on a US East PvP server to provide reasonable ping to North American and European members alike.
---
**Loot System:** Loot Council. With a specific emphasis on rewarding high performing dedicated players to drive rapid progression. Additional measures are in place for fairness and to reward up-and-comers.
---
**Raid Times:** Will be Saturday &amp; Sunday morning from 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM Eastern Time. Once we have MC &amp; Ony on farm, we will be able to get this down to a single day, two-hour commitment per week.
---
We are currently recruiting all classes with an emphasis on ranged and melee dps, but all are welcome.

The heals may be slow, but they also have the most efficient heal in the game.
---
You don't need to multibox to kill the ice giants in winterspring.
---
Agreed. i'm not faulting the wonderful players of SA or brazil here; blizz should've just given them a single server.
---
Kevin Jordan talks about this a lot. People ask him a lot what he thinks of multiple toggleable difficulty settings. He always replies that it makes sense in a game but it damages the sense of world. Completely correct.
---
Go hunter if you want, it’ll take a month or two to get to 60 for most people anyway, I’d guess once the hype of classic dies down lots of people will quit playing as others have said. You’ll get into raids.
---
Streamers put it best, a lot of classic raids weren’t difficult, don’t forget there’s no heroic or mythic, just one set difficulty so Progression guilds are a joke unless they’re just trying to get the fastest time. The only reasons some guilds/pugs won’t take a certain class is because they read on reddit that they shouldn’t. Otherwise taking a sub optimal class might just increase your raid run by a few minutes.
---
This show was amazing! Still is tho!
---
Helped me through my leveling and kept my motivation up 🤩
---
Wow I never could put my finger on it but you \*exactly\* nailed it.
---
Great question - not that I'm aware of, pretty sure it's going to display what the keybidnis regardless... at least for default ui.
---
Remember Alf? He's back! In pog form!
---
I was reminded of this when fighting off Snow Yetis in highlands as a mage, they were harder than other mobs because they resisted a lot of my frost spells! I was like "Oh, yeah. I guess that makes sense huh."

Nelf rogued and warriors...

Smh
---
It's a shared living space. Even in my study, I value my wife's opinion. Some things might look cool in theory while actually being incredibly stupid.
---
Claiming you can do what you want cause you're a "man" is just about the childish thing you can do lol.
---
Unpopular opinion: Trivial stuff like the barber should be introduced in classic.
---
I mean yeah, we've had this conversation about a billion times already.
---
I had just joined a new guild and was asked to join an impromptu ZG run at Hakkar. I'd never done Hakkar before so the raid leader explained it to me, but when explaining the poisoned blood mechanic, he just said "get your poison and stack up."
---
I was a shaman, and I understood this as "cleanse poisons and stack up." Who had ever heard of intentionally getting poisoned?
---
Cue me, mid Hakkar fight dropping a poison cleansing totem and removing poisons from as many people as I could manage, while the raid leader is yelling at me, "DEKU GET YOUR POISON!" and I'm like "I'm getting as many as I can!!" "IS THAT A FUCKING POISON CLEANSING TOTEM??"
---
After I single-handedly wiped the fight, we all had a good laugh at my misunderstanding and did end up beating Hakkar.
---
Took Thursday and Friday off after launch will have to struggle the first couple nights but after thst its 5 days with labor day included :)

&gt;Step 3: **Left** of you, accept quest
---
Should probably stick with north/south/east/west.
---
no it really isn't your fault, the game early on doesn't have the best tank mechanics, but you are going to have to let the dps die sometimes (in later game) DPS has to understand they can pull aggro if they want, and they have to learn to keep their threat under check too. In modern you can go ham all day and not pull aggro, in vanilla if a mage wanted to, he can get aggro, its just how the game was, the old rule used to be: If tank dies its healers fault, if healer dies its tanks fault, if DPS dies its DPS's fault. Most DPS will be new to this whole threat concept too and overextend
---
I mean, 99.9% of the time you don't need to wear the cloth gear either, not like MC is just unbeatable unless you have that extra healing.
---
Maybe it's just me, but i almost never wear armor that isn't of the type my class wears. Not for RP purposes but just because if i'm playing a class i want to actually play how they play and look how they look. I don't understand why anyone would play holy paladin if they're just gonna pretend they're a holy priest anyways.
---
So we gotta log in HOURS before the actual launch and make sure to not go offline?
---
Constantly use sunder armor and shield slam and you'll be fine.
---
Also demoralizing shout is good for subtle aoe threat.
---
And you can also download some sort of addon for threat meters, there's plenty.
---
Dude. That's an achievement if I ever saw one
---
He even deleted that post. 
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Thank Gods for the horde

What's German for "they thought we didn't but we did"?

Just remember folks, when you see people spazzing out and spamming trade chat with memes and general toxicity there is a high likelihood that they are over the age of 30 :)
---
Do yourself a favor and level cooking at the same time. There's lots of recipes for fish. Going back later to level cooking from 1-300 is a pain the ass.
---
Require a high threshold, like 75%, and require a level 60. The polls would be fine.
---
Locks have it almost just as easy as hunters + no ammo
---
Yeah my dad is 64 and is really excited about classic too. He did the rank 1-11 honor grind back in the day and wants to try for r14 now that hes retired.
---
Ah, I see. I was out of the loop on this one. I get it now.
---
&gt; It's worked great for OSRS
---
No it has not, people with alts are having a monopoly. Also PVM vs PVE wars on eachothers votes.
---
I haven't booked any time off but since I'll be up all night on the 26th I won't be in any shape to go to work on the 27th.  Maybe same for 28th...
---
My roommate uses these as a normal thing. Last one was Airplanekid5 I think lol.
---
I may be unable to grow a beard on my face, but you can’t take away the neckbeard on my soul.
---
50 days? Those are some rookie numbers. Gotta pump those up.
---
The guild thing won't matter at all for quite awhile. You'll have PLENTY of time in game to settle in before you need to look for a guild and you'll like just stumble into one anyways just by normal playing. There are all sorts of guilds and they are constantly recruiting.
---
The queue is part of his RP.  He'll be stealthing so hard he doesn't even appear on the server.
---
Very cool and also very legal!
---
Oui please.
---
If she gets annoyed by the twitch chat there is an add-on called "Zoomers Begone" that claims to block it out.
---
I can't even remember if I ever ran DM while it was still relevant in vanilla. Maybe shortly before TBC, I remember playing Molten Core, BWL, Onyxia, ZG before AQ came out and I know I NEVER ran AQ. It's all pretty blurry for me as it was back in high school and I'm 28 now.
---
F
---
i would otherwise but i dont care about my name, and its more about principle for me, im not a fan of activision blizzard.
---
This literally becomes their life, they've invested too much into it.
---
If that were the case people would be logging in as early as 8am and staying logged in on character screen until launch, thus creating server queues before the game is even launched.
---
I’m thinking servers are going down before the come back up come Monday.
---
Unless you are a paladin.  They can spam fol nonstop for most figths.

&lt;UNFINISHED BUSINESS&gt;
---
[US-PvP Faerlina] [Horde]
---
We are recruiting dedicated and casual players for Classic WoW!
---
What We Provide: 
---
• Dungeon and leveling groups 
---
• Two different raiding groups: A core raid group with high expectations and high performance, as well as a casual raid group for players who are either new to raiding (and are looking to earn their spot as a core raider) or players who aren’t as dedicated to the consumable and time requirements of raiding full time but still want to participate in raiding when they can.
---
• A group of leaders (No singular GM) with extensive private server vanilla raid leading experience eager to plunge into the world of original WoW again.
---
What Are We looking For (mainly for the core raid group): 
---
• Friendly players that want a reliable guild that will progress steadily through all content as it releases.
---
• Players that are willing to learn and put forth the required effort to farming gear and all required consumables for raiding.
---
• Team-centered players motivated more by improving the quality of play and raid effectiveness than how much loot they individually receive.
---
Raiding Information: 
---
• Primary raid nights Tuesday/Thursday/Sunday at 9:00 CST - 12:00 CST. As content is cleared and learned at a faster pace, Sunday and Thursday raids will be phased out for the core group.
---
• Our loot system uses a fully transparent Ranked Loot system with all rules and accrued points publicly visible for each member. Gear is prioritized to players who demonstrate consistency, preparedness, and performance. The higher the rank earned in the guild, the more loot options become available to roll on. Each guild member, leadership included, follows the same ranking system and has no loot priority.
---
Check us out at our discord channel https://discord.gg/RNgKacE and read the welcome channel information to get started with &lt;Unfinished Business&gt;!
---
same here, never even thought about stepping into the german servers, im all about that international community shit yo
---
Accurate
---
I like this one.
---
You are better off leveling as Shadow, you can still easily heal Dungeons until lvl ~55. The ability to deal damage mostly depends on the tank, if your Renew keeps him topped, you are free to Wand/dot. 
---
I’d avoid spamming other spells as it impacts your mana regen negatively.
---
Theoretically Smite spec could pull of some decent DPS in raids as well, but its also a waste of mana compared to healing. Debuff slots mean no dots for you, either. As a Disc Priest your niche will be buffing cloth DPS with Power Infusion during raids.
---
Spellpower gear for PvE is not viable, however it could be great for farming. Good luck getting it over all the caster DPS though.
---
Also I’d say Disc is one of the healers with the best damage options outside raids, only Shammies might have it even better, as they have easier acces to Spellpower gear. However they don’t have wands and Deep Resto (their proper raiding spec) gives no benefit for offensive spellcasting.
---
The names not cool. The guy is.
---
I don't know how it was in the US, but here in the EU I could smoothly login and make my character without any disconnects or my character creation timing out.
---
Judging by that I think things will run smoothly aside from the server having queues off course.
---
Pservers are on a complete different game engine.  
---
So i'll give you 99,99% this doesnt work
---
As close as possible, but due to the server and code design changes over the last 15 years, there can’t make it line for line identical.
---
How can you sleep with so much hype???
---
This! Just switch!
---
Why are the servers capped at 5k? According to Moore's law Blizzard should have servers capable of handling 3 million users by now.
---
I agree with ya. I got my names but I feel like the name reservations was maybe not such a good idea...
---
When I was in university, one of my classmates’ son also played WOW, I don’t think he was older than 8 or 9 yo.  My classmate only allowed him to play during the weekends for an hour or two, I am not sure he even hit lvl 60 or not
---
Alexa, play The Final Countdown
---
I mean, i don't ever use my phone will driving, in any situation, ever.
---
I don't get people who say it's a small deal, or it's just a quick tap. Stop fucking doing it. Even if it's a 0.000001% chance that something goes wrong, is it really worth killing someone because you had to change the song or skip a video game queue?
---
If you had any idea how many stories of people getting run over started with "i just looked down for a split second", you wouldn't take it so lightly.
---
It's fucking WoW. Get home and sit in the queue. Clean your house, mow the lawn or watch a movie and realize that it's just a game and it doesn't really matter.
---
Dad's 71, he can't wait.
---
Wow this thread. I'm 25 and feeling dumb because I wanted to replay a childhood game
---
P2 won't have BGs. Obviously ganking wPvP will not be competitive anymore with the release of WSG in P3.
---
You have the exact same wallpapers i have  xD
---
Disc is one of the barely viable specs in vanilla. The only thing that makes you semi viable is being able to give another DPS Power Infusion.
---
I also think it's fucking doofy seeing a Corporal with a GM greatsword because they stopped giving a shit about PvP after they hit 14.

Is he back in pawg form?

Deposit gets refunded when it sells, and the AH cut is 5% of the final sale price, so that Light Leather stack you sell for 4.60 silver comes back as 4.37 silver plus the deposit, which is 1.37 silver more than had you just vendored it.
---
Now thats an awesome story! :'D
---
Honestly, this is helping so much with the hype towards classic. Good work! Can't wait to see the rest!
---
I didn't look at every single item in depth, but from what I did see there's a lot of out-there mechanics being introduced. Not good, too extreme. Anything that changes stuff in such a big way instantly becomes must-have, so rather than giving additional options you've actually just made everything else worthless.
---
I will say though that your dungeon designs are brilliant, and the interactive maps are 10/10.
---
I've got patience, I'll go outside and RP while waiting
---
I'm 34.  Didn't make the cut.
---
Of course not?
---
But they drop a shard per player involved, so there's no benefit from being less. So you can multibox as 40 players and get the same amount of gold per hour as a real 40 group of real players.
---
My friend's family is like that. They had plenty of hot water living in the US, but when it was shower time, it was shower time for everyone and they all went back to back. They're Chinese so maybe how the parents grew up had something to do with it.

Salt Miners is a Progression / Semi-Hardcore guild for Classic created by a veteran group of players. Experience in Vanilla up to Saph, tons of PS experience, ranking pushes, mythic raiding and multiple gladiator titles after Vanilla. We are mainly a PvE focused guild but will likely have PvP related events throughout Classic’s life span. Leadership is a bunch of laid back 30+ year olds who are goal oriented, most of our members are mature individuals. Applicants under 25 years of age will be considered with the understanding that you will be working with an older crowd. We want to kill bosses and have a great time doing it, we aren’t here to babysit or micromanage anyone. You take care of your stuff and we will take care of the raids.
---
**GOALS**  
---
We are setting our sights on having our first raid night 4 weeks after launch. Our overall goal for Classic is to clear all content available. All raids will be conducted and driven by efficiency.
---
**RAID SCHEDULE**  
---
Tuesday / Wednesday 6-9pm PST, 9-12am EST, with optional raid on Saturdays for old / farm content.
---
**LOOT**  
---
Loot will be distributed by a 5 man loot council. Determinations on loot will be made based on attendance, performance, guild presence, attitude, and reward density.
---
**Attendance** \- This is the number one thing you can do to guarantee you get your items. If you show up to every raid, on time, with your consumes, and a proper spec, I guarantee we will take care of you.
---
**Performance** \- This is pretty standard stuff. If you are killing it we are going to get you the tools you need to do your thing.
---
**Guild Presence** \- Here are some things that I would include in this aspect; helping people get their pre-bis items, running optional raids, attending guild events, spying for world bosses. It’s literally everything you do OUTSIDE the raid that helps the guild. We take note of all that and your contributions wont be forgotten.
---
**Attitude** \- Nobody likes a debbie downer and nobody likes side cliques where you have people trash talking half the raid. While we know that there is no way you are going to get 40 people in the same room without some personality clashes, we expect everyone to act like adults. People that are good at setting aside their differences and working as a team will be rewarded.
---
**Reward Density** \- We understand that you aren’t going to want to raid for 3 months before you see your first piece of gear just because you don’t have quite as much time to invest as Joe Schmoe. We are going to spread the love around while making sure key players get key items.
---
**EXPECTATIONS**  
---
Attendance  
---
Attendance
---
We don’t want to recruit a large bench. Be on time or let us know before hand if you will be late or gone that night.
---
We expect the majority of our raiders to be 60 by week 2, but the sooner the better. It’s not a hard cutoff, we just want people stepping into MC with most of their pre-raid bis items. We aren’t saying there is going to be no meme-specs in the guild, but they will be very limited(likely less than 3) and unless we are aware of your intentions before hand you will be expected to show up with your standard raid spec. **Edit:** We are not currently accepting anymore meme specs. Very talented and strong applicants playing off meta will still be considered, but expect your application to be met with scrutiny.
---
We are looking for people who understand progression raiding and don’t need me or anyone else to constantly inspect you or check your buff bar. Self accountability is a big deal.
---
People who start side discords or chat channels with the sole purpose of bad mouthing other guildies will be removed and there will be no warning for this process at all. If you are making the raid unfun for people because you have an excessively negative attitude, you like calling out people’s mistakes, or you just generally are being a turd we will attempt to work with you to curb this stuff, but at the end of the day you are expected to be a pleasant person to raid with.
---
Please note there is a difference between friendly banter or competitiveness and being an Ahole. We banter with eachother all the time and crack jokes. Just make sure it’s all in good fun. It’s just as important to have thick skin as it is to be pleasant to others.
---
I emphasize complete and total transparency with leadership. You can expect to come to me for any problems you have for any reason and it will be taken seriously.
---
**RAID NEEDS**  
---
We started recruiting with the goal of getting 20 strong core raiders before the launch of the game. We have already exceeded this goal and are continuing to recruit serious applicants before and after launch. Any holes in our roster once Classic launches will be filled by people on the server, but we are looking to complete our roster before server launch.
---
Current class demand:  
---
Druid: Low  
---
Hunter: Medium  
---
Mage: Low  
---
Priest: **High**  
---
Rogue: low  
---
Shaman: Low  
---
Warlock: Medium  
---
Fury Warrior: **High**  
---
Tank: Low
---
No rolls / classes are entirely closed as of right now. All strong applicants will be considered. Raid slots are merit based. Just because your class is in low demand doesn’t mean you can’t be invited to compete for a raid spot.

Fraid not. I personally know one of the original guys who made it (I know it sounds like a "my uncle works at nintendo" thing to say, but I do. And he told me that people have moved on from the group who made it, so he can't see it ever being made again.

Back in the day I made a really old looking Tauren, named him Oldone, the name was taken, made him into Youngone without changing any features.

Wait a second..
---
There is no point selling at server launch, there will be a huge amount of leather from players + nobody has the currency to buy leather early.
---
Likely that the mom didn't know that. Smells fishy to me too though

Drugs.
---
I have some edibles that knock me right out (it's legal here).  I also have some melatonin and ZzzQuil.
---
You don't even need to be a hacker, majority of them just throw money at some indonesian botfarm to DDoS for them, since you need MAJOR firepower to impact a corporation as big as Blizzard.

Can we just agree, before this reaches day 12 it has to have something about layering in it.

My rotation is 6 days of work then 8 days off. It just so happens my stretch of 8 days off starts on Monday!
---
Can someone give me some pros/cons with both classes, why and why not to play them?&lt;3 I have a really hard time figuring out, and also what's the best or most enjoyable mage/race &amp; Lock/race combo for leveling?
---
Oh god now I cannot unsee/unhear it
---
I heavily disagree with this. Maybe the classic style will best bfa in traffic evenetually, but the time of mmorpgs and wow is over. The pace of gsmes coming out mixed with the f2p aspect has driven the mmo subscription based gsmes to a modicum of their former strength. Wow will most likely never again even come close to its former glory, and if it does it will be when they make wow fully f2p.

I took a week off about 4 weeks into launch, when the queue times hopefully have settled, low level areas are less crowded and i am probably in the better level range to spend free time in. Aka lvl 30 - 45.

&gt; Wrong my man. 5 Paladins. 5 Hunters. 5 Warlocks. 5 Shaman Should all be just fine. Ret's can off heal. Hunters can use tanky pets and heal. Warlocks can use Voidwalkers. Shaman can off heal.
---
You have *clearly*, **not**, done this before if you think it's easy. I want you to clear Scholomance with either of the classes, times five, then get back to me. Either that or stop pretending doing dungeon runs with your group is 'hard'.
---
1 - When you are there as a healer you will want to avoid using damage casts because that would essentially just slow you down as this kicks you out of the 5-second-rule-regeneration. Wanding, however is what every priest definitely should do when there's no immediate urge to heal. In big raids that you outgear it can happen frequently that you feel like there's too many healers. I'm also contemplating to just do damage instead of fighting over the little healing that needs to be done over large parts of it.
---
2 - Get Spirit Tap and it'll be half as bad. You start each fight by frontloading some hard-casts and then you wand. Spec doesn't matter as much. I've done that as holy (but with spirit tap) and I had no issues.
---
3 - No... And I wonder why, when looking at the talent-tree, you would think that. Even holy is better for damage than disc because there's a 2-point-talent that increases your holy-damage-spells by a whopin' 10% that you can't get when going for the final talents in the Disc-Tree. The 25-30 talent-points in disc also grant damage but other than those you mostly get better at instant-casts.
---
Disc is usually also played as healer but with a slightly different focus. Your best bet would probably be playing Nightelf because they get an additional damage-spell that allows you to chain it with holy-fire and benefit from it's mana-efficiency and getting out of the 5-second-rule during the long cast time.
---
4 - Well, if you use PI for yourself, you certainly can get a pretty high amount of damage from Smiting... the problem, just with other caster-dps-hybrids is their mana-management. You don't have evocation and you don't have Lifetap. So you'll run OOM a lot. Unless you do that Starshard-Holy-Fire-Rota... which has very little dps compared to smite-spam, though.
---
5 - Well, if you wanna heal, then yes. Or let's say what your understanding of "horribly" is. You should definitely keep a gear-set like that anyways for PvP and/or soloing stuff. But the cost of dam/heal vs. heal-only when it comes to item-budget is much lower, so you'll have about half as much +heal than otherwise.
---
But as I said, when you realize that there's generally enough healing and you are just competing for every bit of healing to be done, you might aswell wear a damage-set and do some damage instead of spamming flash-heals because they are faster and thus it's easier to "beating" other healers with that.
---
Godspeed to him
---
So in general I would say Priest is much more of a defensive healer, whereas a Shaman is a much more aggressive type. Also Shamans do work much better with Melee whereas Priests can pair with casters a bit better (Power Infusion). I would say base your opinion off that, if you want to be a true pocket healer that is more focused on healing/support then Priest is the better choice. If you want to be on the front lines doing damage while throwing out heals in a more aggressive/utility approach then Shaman hands down. Shaman also does give you the choice with playstyles, you can go hybrid Ele/Resto and be an absolute truck in PvP, or go deep resto and get more of that pocket healer approach.

He doesn't. It's possible they are, but he's literally just making shit up. The WoW team is very careful about avoiding crunch when they can. "It's a marathon not a sprint". If they feel they need it, they'll crunch for expansion/patch releases, but we have no way to know if they're currently crunching short of someone at the company saying they are (which is unlikely).
---
Nah I'm alright mate, cheers.
---
I am curious to know what was the first with beta testers with legit means. aka no exploits and with characters with only stuff accessible in the game normally.
---
Really? I've seen quite a few banners on sites and such. We won't see TV adverts like we used to though.
---
Apparently it's where all the spaniards are going and nobody wants to play with them because they don't speak english.
---
I'll admit I did cheat with the dotted lines. All of this is originally vector, too, so it's all very easily editable.
---
Haha just joking around, but I've never seen a comparison like this so I wanted to say *something*. Also need to kill time this week and it flies when you discuss pointless stuff like this.
---
I'm 34 and back in Wrath my guild called me "Loremaster" because I was the go-to guy for in-game and lore information.
---
I'm reaching out to a lot of them to see if they're coming back.  Fingers crossed.
---
Well played.
---
WTB the name Gu on whitemane! This name means a lot to me and I am willing to pay for it! If you can help me get in touch with the owner of the name as well, I'm also willing to pay you a finder's fee as well!
---
Something that I don't see mentioned very often, you can tank low lvl dungeons without a shield. Really a shield is a little extra armor but the main reason why people use shield is to get uncrushable when tanking bosses at 60. This isn't an issue when you're tanking mobs your own level.
---
While leveling, and imo up to BRD where mobs actually start to do pretty significant damage, you can just 2H tank. It's actually better, in my experience, as long as you don't die. Which you won't, the tank damage in leveling dungeons is pretty low, if you're wearing mail to 40 and plate after 40, you already got plenty enough armor.
---
The benefits of 2H tanking is higher dps and higher tps, which are more important imo than taking -5% incoming damage or so, especially when you already take very little damage. Dps won't pull off you, you'll get rage to play with. Dungeon runs become smoother and faster, mobs stick to you like glue and they go down faster.
---
1. Yeah, your way of thinking is accurate here. Easiest way to do it is to have a mark for each mob. It will help for threat as well. Skull for kill, X for second target, star for sheep, circle for sap, for example. 
---
2. It’s not a huge deal if the healer has to ask, but as someone who has healed a lot of dungeons it’s a 10/10 experience when I don’t even have to ask. I’m oom, the tank sees it, we both know I need a pause to drink and as soon as I’m almost full we are good to go again.
---
3. Yeah basically like point one. Tank doesn’t necessarily have to be raid lead by any means, often you will have a boss in your face and may not have the vision to raid lead well anyway. But a MT will always need to have the ability to be vocal and make callouts as necessary. I was just speaking towards dungeons in my comment above
---
Immersion and justice is the key here. I was never a pve guy, raided quite rarely until one point, and because of them few of my good friends who raided religiously had much better gear than me and seen much more of the content, and IT MADE SENCE! 
---
They took more risks, spent more time, spent more resources so they experienced more. I was happy doing AV so I didnt see Hyjal. That just makes sence. 
---
The current state of just making everyone experience everything is just takibg away from the motivation of actually trying to beat bosses.
---
this. everyone is going to be broke and hoarding money in the beginning. it makes way more sense to vendor the leathers early on, then when an economy starts to develop then it's more profitable to sell on the AH
---
Hey there. You’re comments really seem to echo a lot of what our guild will be doing. Please check us out if interested. Thanks! Let me know if you have any questions. Take care!

There's many reasons why multiboxing will be more popular than it was in vanilla. 
---
For once, there's no initial fee on the game, second the subscription is now 35% cheaper due to inflation,  third it's a LOT cheaper to buy a pc that run multiple instances of the game. Back in vanilla most people could hardly run the game, now adays the average joe could probably run a 5man multibox with no issues. And forth and final, there's way more, more accessible and better multiboxing software that helps do stuff for you.
---
Apes never did. Trolls had a worldwide empire at one point, and Zandalar still exists as proof of that. What exactly is your point here?

at least you corrected the 5 molten cores

At sea still requires clean shaven, but if a ship is along side for any length of time (drydock, refit, short work period, etc..) I believe it's up to the Captain as to what he wants to do.
---
Of course, that being said, if you're required to be on duty while along side you'd still need to be clean shaven for firefighting/DC emergencies.
---
Indeed. My entire guild is 35+
---
Why is there a Snapchat icon on it tho?
---
Sure, but it has nothing to do with what the first guy said, that it's pretty easy to do decent with a hunter and just coast through a better part of the game.

Not the base skill, but it can be improved by +fishing skill from your fishing pole and lures.  You can still catch fish in that zone, as longs as you have the minimum fishing skill level met, but 425 is the point at which your fish will stop potentially getting away.

---
Fair. I'm not a native English speaker, so I might be using the wrong vocabulary to express my point.
---
When I talk about artificial difficulty, I'm not trying to say that it is "unfair". I'm trying to say that the game imposes that difficulty because it wants to do it. There's no logic behind it. It just is, because it is Mythic, so Mythic is difficult. It's a GAME mechanic and nothing else, which makes you painful aware that you are in fact just playing a game, which to me is immersion breaking.
---
Might be helpful in future posts to indicate the spec. This, for instance, wouldn't be your cheat sheet if you were planning on tanking, would it?
---
We had addons in vanilla, though?
---

There’s no world limit due to layering during phase 1. Player limits are Infinite. You’re not waiting for people to log off...
---
The only queuing will be against the authentication server to login. 
---
None of that becomes an issue till phase 2 when layering is removed and you’re subjected to world caps.

Except for the huge amount of people that have been preaching no changes for over a year. Or if you make a separate server with changes then it's split the same way a TBC server would. Either way there's some kind of split

---
I'm 27 with an 8-5 job looking to play 10-15 hours a week. I haven't played since TBC but am leveling a lock to 60 now get the basics down. I would like to do an even split of questing and dungeon leveling with some PVP ganking on the side. Looking for a guild that is not going to tell me how to play the game . Message me if you think I'd be a good fit!
---
avoidstreamers.com
---
Lol okay bud.
---
But Warlocks use Magic + Curse? Paladin only cleanses 1 magic effect. Priest would remove 2 per cast, and only Mage/Druid can remove curses. Plus Shaman has Tremor Totem against Fear, which Horde Warlocks don't have to deal with.
---
Phase 7 would keep people around, but TBC would bring in a bunch of new ones.
---
"Fair" lolol
---
Item's are itemized in a post Vanilla style. Not enough of them are useless or have worthless/vague stats. Though the "effects" on some of them are cool... should be a few that are completely overpowered imo.
---
You will get rail roaded against a healer comp unless you can cc the war and kill the healer.
---
I think it will depend on how crowded those specific leveling zones will be. If you are having to wait for mobs to respawn then dungeon leveling should be faster. I think it's a wait and see type of thing to see how effective layering is going to be

Exponentially? So if servers held 3500... 3500 squared would be 12 million.
---
Vanilla had 2.5k caps and they could at the time make it about 4k but they didn't. So they will use a smaller pop cap to make realms smaller communities. Pserver 10-15k pop is waaaaay too much, it's fun sometimes but i wouldn't want anything above 4-5k.
---
While I can't justify the unbound fire abilities or what the fuck this guy was thinking (lmao) I will say that I also keep 2 Frostbolt ranks on my bars , max rank and rank 1.

Stormwell is a semi-casual, progression raiding guild looking for new like minded members! 
---
With us you'll find a friendly and active community, a weekly game night, and a fun but dedicated Classic  
---
WoW experience. Our goal is to create a less hardcore environment, and instead focus on a friendly and   
---
relaxed atmosphere for everyone, while still having an organized raid for people to progress through.
---
We pride ourselves on having zero tolerance on toxicity, whether you are inexperienced or a veteran, you   
---
can find a welcoming and positive home with us.
---
Raid Info
---
Our planned raid times are 19:30-22:30 CET on Fridays and Saturdays, and we use loot council to  
---
distribute loot.
---
Our core roster will mostly consist of viable specs, though "meme specs" are accepted in moderation,  
---
and treated like any other raider. Discuss with an officer if you have an interest in playing such a spec to   
---
determine whether there is space.
---
For core raiders we expect at least 80% attendance.However if you do need to occasionally miss a raid,  
---
we'll always be understanding.
---
While we prefer our raiders to be prepared with enchants and consumables, you won't be punished for not  
---
bringing them 100% of the time. We understand sometimes not enough time can be committed outside   
---
raid. So know when that happens you'll still be welcome. We have guild enchanters and alchemists to help   
---
if you need it.  
---
Experience is not necessary, whatever your knowledge, your guildies and officers will be here to help you.
---
Currently Recruiting
---
We are currently recruiting all classes as we fill up our core roster. Socials are also welcome.
---
If you have any questions, join our Discord and we'll be happy to help. You can also contact an officer directly:

---
Shaman. Together we can eradicate the Paladin Police force from Azeroth once and for all. Lok'tar brother.
---
you seem to have some ideas how to tackle this
---
I think your real issue will instead be dealing with how expensive life is  as a warrior especially tank as it is not a great gold maker and you may have to tryhard a bit with consumables and BOEs

Just a heads up that rogues lose stealth when they sap. Imp sap is deep sub tree and only gives a 90% chance to remain stealthed.
---
First come first serve
---
Blizzard said that the average age of players during retail vanilla was in the mid-20s. I highly doubt "20%" of the playerbase is going to be above 40.
---
When you say ahead, what are we talking about here? Like 20% ahead? How many spots on the metre ahead? If its comparable to playing a different class, then that kinda sucks. If it's within reason, and dagger rogues aren't trash, then I'm OK with that hit

I always wanted to try dungeons (at level) in only white label gear, no greens.  I am definitely going to try to find four others crazy enough to try this.  Love it.

Found the asshole.
---
lol how the fuck could i miss this :D i raided with a server first guild in naxx, obsidian sanctum and ulduar, but i quit halfway through these crusader's thing. came back when icc was already on farm status but i never have heard about the lvl 80 ony until today :D
---
I played on Stormscale from Vanilla through Mists (though I stopped playing heavily through Cata). I started in the HardOCP guild then a lot of us moved to Seven Sins. At the beginning of BC several of us dropped out of Sins and moved into a new guild (don't even remember what we called it). Somewhere in there I ended up in Cosbowned (I also jumped around a couple servers in there, as well). I was Bobzrozrotwo (UD lock), then Hollyhell for BC (BElf Pally), and eventually Skeezi (there was another Skeezy, too). Couple other chars, too, like Vong (Hunter) and my DK Pastysara.
---
The funny part is the average age of a vanilla wow player was 28-32. MOST original vanilla wow players are like you, in the 40ish year old range give or take a few years.
---
I would suggest trying something like an Acer nitro 5:
---
 [https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Nitro-AN515-Laptop-i5-8300H/dp/B07C715KNT/ref=sr\_1\_3?keywords=acer+nitro+5&amp;qid=1566227495&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-3](https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Nitro-AN515-Laptop-i5-8300H/dp/B07C715KNT/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=acer+nitro+5&amp;qid=1566227495&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-3) 
---
pretty decent device for 666 dollar.
---
Rank 14 is about time available to play not how good you were. Everyone was awful back in 2005.
---
You haven't played Warcraft 3, only reason why you would say that. Night Elves just had good PR in WoW.
---
Best thing you can do is separate them. Use a Warlock to demonic tongues 1 of them. Push or pull them out of sync. Now the person has to group them. 
---
While they’re trying to find the follow person just continue to push them around. 
---
I really think people might see a handful of multiboxers but that’s it.
---
I just don’t want to get TOO far ahead of the guide. Like I want to possibly hit each instance twice, once for quests and once to get the gear I missed in the first run. Does that seem feasible ?
---
i think its a good combo for leveling/pve for sure, you can go all out on dps since he will be holding the aggro, guys will kills stuff really fast and be able to blow through groups of mobs easily and with your VW you can "CC" one mob by having it hold that mob until you guys are ready to take it down if you pull too many
---
I'm curious only to avoid waiting in queues
---
The 40 man raids were designed around the idea that a quarter of them will be afk and/or only autoattacking.  
---
You can't think of this as a TBC raid where there's no chance of victory if the warlock disconnects during the fight.
---
Dude this super unlickly thing can happen with anything you do, acting like every little micro action you make is going to kill people would leave you sitting in a padded room insane.
---
What happens if you tap your phone, you tap your phone and the world moves on, seemes pretty similar to not pushing it. So why does it matter, ofc it does not.
---
If everyone had to do something 95% esier than using a turn signal, yes, cus I expect people to be paying enough to what theyre doing to have the warewithall to twitch a finger an inch.
---
**PVE French horder guild on Auberdine**
---
**Guild name**: Tombenuit (Nightfall)
---
**Raid times**:
---
22:00 to 00:00/01:00 (from 21:00 on Sunday) 2 days a week (could be 3 if possible), days will be determined after leveling phase.
---
**Why this name ?**
---
Because we will play at nightfall and it is the name of a [famous axe of wow vanilla](https://fr.wowhead.com/item=19169/tombe-nuit)
---
**Why this time ?**
---
Because you are older than 30 with real life obligations. You work lage, have a family, have gym, BBQ with friends or whatever, but you also like MMORPG but 21:00 is too soon ! You like mostly PvE and even if you are a filthy casual you want to make progress in game in a fun, friendly and respectful environnement.
---
**Our objectives**:
---
In a fun way, taking our time, we want to achieve some progress in HL.
---
We are already more then 35 players, dynamic and we hope to get to the raids donjons. 
---
We are currently looking for DPS classes (War DPS, Rogue, Warlock are more than welcome) 
---
We have a **DISCORD** to come and chat with us if you want to know us a bit more: https://discord.gg/bmnZ9hU
---
**Welcome to Azeroth !**
---
Did you read the initial announcement?  That announcement said if there were enough population for additional realms, they would be added.  They put that in the first announcement of the August 12th date as well many months ago.  I felt it was pretty clear most players expected more realms to be added between August 12th and 26th.  If you were not expecting a 12th realm, I don't know what to tell you...
---
That's gonna be far and away classicwow's biggest selling point.  Average age of like 28 will make this incredible.
---
Ah I would let autoshot fire if the abilities aren't really needed in that moment. But in pvp it's more difficult I guess..
---
tbh i think you will OOM more often then he will need a heal
---
&gt; I think it’s healthy to add some new content to a 15 year old game
---
They did lol, it's called TBC, Wrath, Cata, MoP, WoD, Legion, and BfA. The point of Classic is to get to play the game we love without all that
---
And you could loot the head for a solid turn in too! I believe 232 from 10 man and 245 from 25 man. Was a lot of fun for sure. That 2h weapon was legit, too.
---
Enough is enough. You guys are beating this to death now.
---
True, but do they care enough to reserve character names though or will they install the game on the day of release and name themselves whatever?
---
That's apparently a private server only thing.
---
If your family is that big then perhaps your situation is more ideal, so I can see your point here. Those without a large family close by would benefit from having  kids later (hopefully). But again having kids isn’t a requirement and to each their own.
---
my bad, meant nature's grace
---
No, please stop spreading misinformation. Almost all enforced driving while using a mobile device laws don't have these weird loopholes that people make up to feel better about themselves.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEroll
---
dude you are such an amazing human for putting this together! As a new excited druid player I cant thank you enough!
---
I mean, Ret and Shadow are at least top tier if not dominant pvp specs. There is at least a spot in raid for one shadow priest. In reality you have 40 slots so most people playing meme shit will get a spot often enough. Without Feral or Boomie being any good in any other content I just don't see the point unless you're one of those die hard druid weirdos like my buddy.
---
This leveling guide is sick - thanks a lot bro!!
---
...why
---
You're right. Realised my mistake after making the post, but you can't edit titles!
---
This one was great lol.
---
I've been researching this extensively, trying to capture opinions and facts.
---
Some of the items/comments I have gathered are in this thread:
---
https://reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cqrsvy/alliance_or_horde/
---
I would love an alternate tbc. Same zones, but fix the horrible story, rework Arena weapons and badge gear.
---
The dungeons and raids were all pretty good though.
---
Use a better font.
---
r/smashbros did this same thing leading up to the release of Ultimate last year it was great! It ended with someone actually singing all the verses and posting a video. Keep this up love this type of stuff.
---
I'm pretty sure they changed the Frost and Blood talents entirely halfway through WotLK to make Blood the official tank spec when it used to be Frost.
---
You are right. Thanks for saying this!
---
And thanks Dev-Team!
---
Honestly, blizzard CAN suspend you if they find out. If you AFK at a common spot you could get mass reported and dc/suspended. And that would suck ass for launch.
---
Because over your computer is the same thing as over the fireplace...
---
Don't go deep into prot while you're leveling - you won't need the deep tanking takes until much later on and it slows down an already slow leveling process.  
---
You can tank any dungeon on the way up,  and that's the best way to learn.  Start small and learn about marking 1 or 2 CC targets. Always watch your healers and be ready to peel enemies off them.  Positioning  is more important than people realize,  as a general rule try to have mobs turned 90° to your team so that the melee dps can get behind them and your healer can see everyone. 
---
I'm sure there's a bunch more,  but honestly just relax and learn as you go.  You'll never have trouble finding groups as a tank, so just get comfortable running dungeons.  It's a great feeling once you level a bit and can literally carry a group through a dungeon chain pulling everything - you'll end up on so many friends lists. 
---
Level up your profs as you go,  too. Once you ding 60 and start REALLY tanking you won't want to be spending your time farming copper in newbie zones because you skipped it on the way up.
---
A boomer is an adult(age doesn't really matter) who does the whole house, SUV, family, lawnmower life(i.e. basically turning into his parents) and are completely out of date with anything after he was 18, and completely oblivious to anyone who doesn't live that life.
---
They said something to the effect that right now a "medium" server for Classic equates to a full server back in the day. Hence why they're expecting some crazy queues for the servers currently listed as "high".
---
your mother's a hog
---
and a slot
---
If you take it before the 40 respec, you'd have to take points out of 2H spec or Imp. Charge. Overpower is what, 5-10% of your total damage around lv30, and crits about half the time, so increasing that part by 10% per point is less than the flat 1% from 2H spec, even if you account for the occasional HS/Slam crit.
---
Once you add MS into the mix, things should get much closer. In the spec above, I opted to prioritize 2H Spec from Arms tree, as well as a fast Piercing Howl, but it's entirely possible that the actual sweet spot for grabbing Impale is either directly with the 40 respec, or at 46-47 after Cruelty instead.
---
I mean it’s out there now, viewing deleted comments aren’t hard at all, just saying.
---
:c
---
For me i have a good relation whit my colleges and boss. But thy are all over 15 years older than me and i think thy would laugh at me if i told them i took that week of to play games.
---
Dungeon grinding should be fastest right?
---
How was it too much? Competing to tag quest mobs?
---
I'm 43 and part of the original video game generation; from the first consoles in the 80s, watching arcades transition from pinball to arcade games like Asteroids, to PC games with no graphics, to PC games with graphic and animation, to PC games on early coax LANs or even dialup using IPX/SPX (Warcraft II) to Ethernet LANs and finally the introduction of MMORPGs like UO and EQ which was a revolution on its own. I still play EQ, 20 years later, and love it. I was 23 when it came out. WoW as well, of course. For video games, I've been able to experience each technological generation as it happened. The average age in these games will continue to rise because they are the best there is, so we all keep playing them as we all get older.
---
Hell yeah xD
---
Yes, money that you have now can be invested and grow beyond an equivalent value after a duration of time.
---
So no, your investments do not say otherwise.
---
Is there an original source on that graphic for the 6 phases or did you make it yourself? It would be useful for a few of my friends who are confused lol
---
I paid £90 each for 2 fujitsu lifebooks from ebay. I5 3210 8gb ram 120gb ssd. Runs classic with no issues at all
---
Crazy how you grind so hard and not even guaranteed to stay there unless you keep up that grind non stop
---
There was no spellpower enchant on gloves at launch and for quite some time. Only beneficial enchant for a mage would be mounts speed, or agi for a little bit of dodge.
---
Don't forget the millions of players in BFA that can easily hop over for 30 seconds create a name, then go back into their queue for finding a dungeon or raid group or waiting on a BG spot to open up.
---
Most PvE realms lean Alliance, you are going to be fine on other servers than Pagle, and there will be 'serious' guilds on every server. Just because people aren't in the discord doesn't mean they aren't on the server.
---
Also last I looked, Pagle was close to 75%/25% on faction balance. Pretty poor.
---
I have a slight feeling you disagree with me =)
---
That's fine, I wasn't trying to say that WoW was just like real life, simply that the roadblocks it put forward clicked well with me. Made sense.
---
Obviously the fun of a video-game is that you can somehow go over those blocks through magic and fantastic means....Like mages and portals! But For those to be FUN they still need to exist. If traveling is no big deal in the world as a whole, what's the appeal of a class that can make portals? It waters it down in my opinion.
---
Still. Just my point of view, I agree that the starvation in wow would be weird and that consuming food to heal is also a leap. I wasn't trying to argue that wow is a realistic game, simply that the "busywork" it has made sense in the context of the world of Warcraft.
---
Servers open up at 5pm my time, 2 hours after I get off work. I have a feeling there will be massive queues on most servers. If I'm unlucky I expect to be in a 30min to 1hour queue times to start playing. Once in I have a feeling starting zones will be packed even with layering. I'll only be able to play for about 4 hours before bed so I doubt I'll make much progress.  
---
I'm hoping to make the most progression and the servers be most stable by the following 3 day weekend after release.  
---
Good luck &amp; Have fun everyone!
---
Not if the sever catches fire.
---
Juju might says that it is BoP. How do you make money farming these?
---
There's been a plethora of posts about it on this sub, friend-o.
---
I could've misunderstood, I've been wrong many times before and will be wrong many more times, but I've read about 17 times this week how ToS will be bannable for classic
---
Could just be people trying to deter it, I guess?
---
I'll try to find the most credible post and shoot you the link
---
Actually that sounds like a great reason to give an alt LW.  Thanks for the heads up!
---
You still AFK and log out eventually
---
&gt; Blizz music composers really nailed the soundtrack in vanilla.
---
I thought this track (and the other tavern music) was the work they contracted out to David Arkenstone for Burning Crusade, right?
---
You can still aoe grind just fine. People have been doing it on the beta. You just have to relearn ranges.
---
I love the RPing you both are doing. 10/10
---
Awesome website. What API did you pull all the items from?
---
NO CHANGES.
---
For cool dudes in US, yes, in the afternoon. Cool dudes in EU have until the 27th. Gonna need something to eat up those last few excruciating hours!
---
Do we just say "inspired by" when we straight jack things now?
---
Goddamn that environment looks ominous af. I never did that run at night with fog; it was always daytime for me.
---
Safe travels!
---
This was pre-spellpower enchant which got added in AQ patches I think.  Good chance this was recorded before then especially as it’s his first movie.  Agility was basically just a “fuck it why not” enchant for clothies at the time and was relatively cheap and low level.  Often put on there just to level up enchanting.
---
They aren't going to split the community that much.
---
Besides, this is realistically over 2 years from now after Nax has been farmed out for a while.
---
Can someone remake this on a sexy banana human? :D
---
Getting sunflower for the whole raid is inarguably an exploit.
---
Awesome! Thank you. This is a huge QoL help.
---
Woah, this one takes me back. Now I'm starting to think of all the wow machinima and comics I use to like. Hmm. There used to be one comic with some baby cow as its main character... wonder what happened to that.
---
*deletes post*
---
Its weird to think that this was all before social media was a thing... crazy :o
---
Ive seen them on my online feeds, but seeing it in public is pretty crazy.
---
This is so wholesome.
---
No that would be Germany,  you should study WW2.
---
That's awesome.
---
Some addons replace the character portrait with their class symbol.
---
And without any BGs until phase 3, world PVP is going to be BIG
---
You are EXACTLY right. I played Vanilla, TBC and WoTLK and quit when cata came out because I thought that the game changed WAYYYYY too much. I am REALLY looking forward to Classic and playing that all over again and maybe TBC and WoTLK if they continue the trend...hopefully they will stop there this time.
---
I leveled and tanked with this right into Naxx, until TBC came out, then I added some more points to fury and kept going.
---
Lots of whining, And server crashes.
---
Yeah but you had the nerve to call him out over something you had no idea about
---
Xander - who are you?? Were you at our LAN when this happened?
---
It makes sense for the game retail has become. Why add extra difficulty or realism?
---
I'd assume its the leveling build. You can tank dungeons with this just fine.
---
Isn't it your time to do whatever you want with it?
---
Nice!
---
Yea I say add TBC content such as raids and quest lines etc. but don't overhaul classes, raise level cap, add flying, arena or any of the other bad stuff we don't like.
---

Current exchange rate CZK:USD is 23,219:1. That means current price of 10490 is about $450, tax included. The listed card is AMD 530.
---
As I said, I'm not based it the US but usually prices seem very similar. 
---
This is the second biggest electronic retailer in the country, I could walk into any of their stores in any county hub, pick it out and even if that specific store didn't have it in stock, I could pick it up the next day. Didn't even have to check the shady sites with listings 20% lower. 
---
I can't comment if it is any good but it fits the bill.
---
Ya. I wonder why you can't have 3 servers work was one.
---
I love AV but it sucks that Alliance have a significant advantage based on map design so it's not entirely fair.
---
What's your point overall? At first you were saying the Nelves were there first. Which is false. So what's your point?
---
Month, day, year. Makes so much sense America.
---
Can you give me a few large WoW podcasts and how to access them please?!
---
I bet we’ll get another server. There’s no way it won’t get very full on launch.
---
My screenshot is from a December 2003 build, so obviously it had changed slightly since then
---
I’m going to rearrange my room and clean it from top to bottom. Set up another monitor and get the battle station ready to go. 
---
Vacuum every room and do a nice dusting so when I take my week off I’m not asked by any of the roommates to help clean anything.
---
Laundry of course, I’ve got a head start already just need to stay on top of it up to this weekend. 
---
As far as meal prep goes I’ll probably just have beans soaking and make rice every 2 or 3 days and that’ll complete my proteins for the cheapest route 😂 at least have enough to make it through my vacation week. After that I’ll return to my normal life with only playing heavily on the weekends so I’ll go to my normal meal prepping for the week. 
---
Oh and definitely going to clean out the fridge so there’s no strange odors coming out of it when I go to grab water/food on breaks. 
---
I’m so ready to be off and back to a grind that’ll actually last for years to come and not just disappear again
---
Its meant to buff 1 fucking person. You have to use precise timing to trick the server to buff everyone in a raid.
---
I was gonna beat myself up but now I won’t
---
Move that screen up!!! You are hurting your neck bad!!!!!!
---
You should be looking straight forward for middle of screen
---
Werrre be there pirate guilds? Yaarr
---
We are so screwed. The spillover server is high with just name reservations.
---
\[EU - Gehennas\] Horde priest, likely undead, looking for levelling partners, plan on levelling mostly through questing rather than a straight dungeon grind but I would like to heal some dungeons along the way so I'd ideally be with dps/tank players. Got some time off for launch so will be on fairly regularly and will be playing as servers open.
---
Which IIRC is countered by having less armor on raid bosses.
---
Not that it has anything to do with leveling.
---
We are all Thex.
---
Worth way more than that.
---
Horde feels to have a bit more of an identity. Alliance feels like a generic Fantasy trope. Orcs are pretty over-done in fantasy as well, but in WoW I feel like they're a little more unique in their lore. That being said, I like some generic fantasy tropes and wish I could play a Paladin on the Horde side. That's why I have mained a Paladin since TBC, even though Blood Elves aren't my first choice in race.   
---
I'd kill to be an Orc Paladin.
---
I don't think there will be as big of a drop off as Blizzard is hoping.  I DON'T think that we're going to see 75% of the players leave before phase 2.
---
That's funny! 
---
"Oh, let the guy nap, he's just really old".  
---
Find out later he just finished BWL an hour before work.
---
Yeah but you can head to ashenvale after.
---
And my problem always is that when I am casting as a mage - I wish I could run up and smash shit with my sword. And when the mobs packed in tight - wish I had some more range / stealth. And when I am a warrior smashing shit with my face - man I wish I could heal every now and then.   
---
Im hoping my home is in moonglade. Will find out soon. RELEASE IS SO CLOSE GUYS
---
I know it gets brought up a lot but thats what Runescape did and now the classic version is way more popular than the 'main' game.
---
definitely going to be full on launch, hoping the queues on Stalagg at least stay manageable compared to Herod
---
OP may be rolling Alliance...he didn't specify.
---
And stalagg is high pop. Damn dog. How’s it feel to be that wrong.
---
Because r/gaming is over there.
---
He's one of my favourite dungeon bosses from Vanilla WoW. Also, the name Herod is steeped in mythological underpinnings tracing all the way back to ancient Rome.
---
43 here, eagerly awaiting classic so that I can ditch retail.
---
You only get +5 to engi as Gnome
---
Finally someone with some responsibility, no reason to rush to 60. Id wager lots of folks are going to get burnt out halfway there. Respect; keep your life together and pray for mine.

---
Yeah, for one, a dev doesn't have access to this much info across every single game. They know the game they worked on, and even then unless they're a high level dev, they don't know much beyond the short term plans, like a low level WoW dev probably knows almost nothing about 10.0 plans.  
---
And then there's the making fun of WoW story they do with Diablo, that's clearly a joke and not true.
---
4 alliance jumping a horde player, imagine that. It’s almost like its ingrained in your dna
---
Yeah I definitely didn't need that right imagine in my day.
---
While it is certainly still over populated, it is not quite as bad as it looks.  I and many others have characters on more than one server yet when the game launches we will only be able to play 1 at a time.  I think they need at least 2 more pvp servers and another pve as there is still a wave that wont show up till release but there is reason to only maybe worry like 90% and not 100%.

Serenity Now
---
Hahahaha, best me to quoting this
---
Yeah i looked it up online and turns out earth shock was the threat generating one. My memory is wack when it comes to old skills
---
&gt;literal translation.
---
Yes, that's the joke.
---
Lol did you delete your condescending post to make it seem like I was calling OP an asshole?
---
Yep, that's the last couple minutes of it.  Full High Warlord's gear and the Hand of Rag, running around just *deleting* people from Warsong Gulch and various World PvP encounters.
---
This seems spot on.
---
The one with the email opening is my favorite but I can never remember what episode it is
---
Of course. But again, we're talking about the fact that you might not have your name available when trying to make a char on one of those new / low pop servers. My points still stand. It will just affect 1.5% of the playerbase instead of 1%.
---
Of course no one can know, but I'm pretty sure most people aren't concerned by name change problems, simply because either their name(s) is not a common one, and/or because there are not that many chars that are currently created on those new / low pop servers, hence the chances of it being taken even lower.
---
And ultimately, just use 1 of your 3 char slots to test if your own / friends name are taken there, and then decide to migrate if you feel like it. I can't believe "migrating" servers can be such an issue although the game hasn't launched yet.. Like now should actually be the best moment to just take your time and decide in what server to roll. If you're enrolled on a top hardcore guild that you may never find again, then it's fine to stick with it. But again for most of us 99% of the playerbase, there aren't any excuses really.
---
Yes that's what I'm asking basically
---
With classic being so close i still haven't been able to decide what i want my first character to be between a Rogue and a Hunter. Mostly going to focus on PVE but will WPVP and do some BG's here and there but main focus is PVE.
---
Not really sure what im looking for making this post just opinions i guess that might help me decide before im staring at the character create screen on launch and blanking.
---
Yeah, he didn't say aoe grinding would not work because of overcrowding, he said that it would not work because of the leeway mechanic.
---
Wonder why that list has swifty and towliee but not Bajheera
---
This is really awesome!
---
Oh yeah, I agree that it shouldn't go overboard to the point of completely frustrating! I think another comment here was talking about how starvation in wow isn't a thing, but food instead is used to "cure wounds".
---
I guess what I'm trying to say is that what they chose to have in the game to "inconvenience" the player click with me really well. Normally when people encounter stuff like that they will either think "Oh that's some bullshit" or "Oh! Okay so I have to do it that other way instead!" and my reaction to most of classic wow inconveniences is the latter, adding to the immersiveness.
---
in classic though, it didn't really matter outside the raids, as even though you specced into fire tree, you still had all the frost/arcane spells in your artillery, you just had to make do with less potent spell set for those mobs.
---
It is not against the ToS and has never been.
---
I would actually be down for that (no different than no shave november really) but I grow facial hair so slow it wouldnt even be exciting =(
---
You're gonna be late if you start 2 days after launch.
---

I think I misunderstood it and was thinking of sharding, sounds like layering is great so I'm not sure why all the complaints

Whoops, I’ll blame dyslexia or something - yeah 130. That also makes sense, I was thinking it was a typo too.

Too real, lol.
---
Thinking of going warrior to tank but I also want to pvp so I feel like it would be difficult or annoying to do also is it even worth rolling warrior the class seems really over populated
---
I'm torn between druid or rogue in classic. I played rogue in vanilla do know what it would be like (despite hazy memory) and I don't know which to pick. I'd be going feral and mostly doing PvP.
---
Druids can heal or tank, mind levelling easier. Druids don't have a slowing spell or ability and no reliable stun for PvP like rogues have.
---
Rogues have lockpicking ability, slowing abilities, and short cooldown stuns.
---
I have no idea which to pick. From vanilla I remember druid being easy to kite around and they couldn't kill you, it's just you couldn't kill them either. Rogues could kill you and they were difficult to kite
---
What about the newborn?
---
Boomer generation ended in 65.  65-80 is gen x.
---
Maybe read a little bit better. I said in vanilla style, not in new expansions ;) How cool would it be if they added a new raid to Classic? Or a new dungeon at level 60? Imagine if they put more original Warcraft lore into playable content (in Vanilla style). Try to think out of the box and be less ignorant. We are here because we love Classic. Let the original base game be the same. Like it used to be. But I just think the game would be more alive if they added some nice content into Classic after some years. Imagine if they make a new raid like they announced Ahn'qiraj. Where both factions have to work together to open the raid. I’m sure we will see more content like that in the future
---
Homan Sampson is Herod?
---
classic meme for a classic game
---
It will be fine. They’ve said that medium servers already have more characters than the most populated realms in vanilla, and we aren’t even passed name reservation.  Don’t be surprised if you get queues.
---
Unless you're rolling with friends, most people will not like you in the DPS role in dungeons since you can tank 5/10 man content as any spec simply by putting on a shield and one hander and going defensive stance. Clothies/hunters/rogues are going to be way more plentiful than warriors so most attempts to get a PuG going where you can just smack things will end up with the group saying "why do we need a tank when we have a warrior here?"
---
My first EVER dungeon was with no tank with a hunter who said his pet could tank. Ultimately, we got decently far. I still have nightmares of that pirate ship.
---
Julian “Putin’s pawn” Assange

Yeah I pretty much dropped the game a couple of months later because after that I only got loot if literally no other healers needed the item, even if they were better geared than me.

My first thought when reading stories, but when you put down specific information like Level 32, then did it for 30 minutes, waited another 15 minutes. Also 2007, bc launched Jan 16th 2007. 
---
I also skimmed his post history just to see if it could be believable, user has a lot of stories that are seemingly far-fetched or over exaggerated which tends to lead me to call bullshit on all of them.
---
He is very much like Athenes persona back in the day, except I liked when Athene did his persona, but I found Asmons too obnoxious maybe because there is live-chat now and there weren't any what Athene did his thing.
---
I hit 10 in vanilla back when I had no life as a teen. I was playing *a lot -* just about every weeknight and probably all weekend*.* A lot of premade BGs + a lot of PUG BGs too. The people who hit 12+ seemed to be playing all day every day (mostly in premades) including weekdays.
---
(I was on a very competitive original high pop PVP server though... and I think that was still during the time when PVP queues could be 40+ minutes for Horde on that server).
---
WoW Vanilla was huge in german speaking countries, I still remember shows from 2004 on giga TV where they played the beta of WoW, that got all people hyped up for WoW.

Hunter has the highest skill ceiling in vanilla, imo. You can still play a hunter if you're bad, most hunter players do.

Thats true. WoW wasnt most addicting video game back in the day for no reason

Nah, otherwise the top ENreealms would have been locked too now

Starting raiding for PvP gear
---
The syllable count doesn't need to match in prose; it needs to match the way "12 Days" is actually sung. Every version I've ever heard elongates "doves" to "duh-oves," two syllables' worth of sound. "Two factions clashing" is perfect to my ear.

Going only 1 rank into OP but then going full hamstring, cleave and sunder, I wonder what your playstyle and rotation is?
---
&gt; I deleted my first character at level 40 because I didn't like his hair
---
Big yikes
---
Yes, it is actually.  My plan is to quest/grind to level 15.  Then go the rest of the way to 60 strictly in dungeons.
---
Whatever those ZF shoulders are called.
---
Same boat for walocks. Love you void!
---
Nobody knows for sure, but 9 months per phase sounds a little absurd. That would be longer than actual vanilla was.

Wasn't working in last beta. Was there at 3,6,9 server time and sat there for an hour and he never budged.

I'm also on EU, so I'll just sleep and wake up at 6.00 like every day. Then the huge mob will probably already be in and reducing in size because people went to sleep, and TS too early for the second wave to wake up. So hopefully no large queues.
---
You CHOOSING to make it harder for yourself is not the same
---
It’s you challenging the game
---
The game should challenge you
---
Je ne sais pas!
---
its not a technical problem at all. It's a people problem.
---
also people say "blizz knows more" CONSTANTLY over the past 15 years and they fuck things up all the time, when do people stop saying this?
---
It makes sense for the community that retail has become, not the game. Greymane attacking Sylvanas in legion, and sylvanas’ actions in BFA indicate that there is still plenty of hostility between the factions.
---
Im so worried of those silly server disconnects and queue at launch...
---
You can tank as dps spec while leveling up no problem until ~55. That way you can find groups easily and then raid as dps once you have decent gear and warriors start to become really strong
---
You'll also be the only one at lvl 40 when we're all 60 😎
---
I plan on trying to have it done in a few weeks. However, the world record from 1-60 is 4 days, 20 hours by Joana. That's 116 hours. Most players will probably be closer to 8 days played time. That's 192 hours. If you play 4 hours/day, every day, that's 48 days. I just imagine people will play less than 4 hrs/day, every day.
---
All the problems make me wanna go...
---
Definitely healed through mc, bwl &amp; some of naxx in vanilla in plate. It's not a big deal.
---
It’s surprisingly not. Some dungeons like Wailing Caverns are much, much bigger than they are on retail. Dying is a real possibility, and there is no “completion xp” etc. 
---
I remember my guilds first runs into WC, we had three guild groups go in one evening and the fastest did it in two and a half hours, the slowest was four. Needless to say, we were all shit at the game at that point, and many people were still in whites with patchy greens, so half the quickest of those times and you probably have a decent ballpark, around an hour and 20.
---
Honestly good levelling classes like Hunter and Warlock for the course would have been much, much better off just questing.
---
I levelled Prot Warrior with my first toon, and my friend levelled Resto Druid, so I did a *lot* of dungeons on the way up. It was slow as hell tbh.
---
Also, never level prot warrior! ;-)
---
LIEK
---
I'm 33 year old mom who's been playing since then and I cant wait!
---
 Chose the less toxic server of the bunch. Later on found a guild I knew from retail joined theserver a d now I'm rolling with them.
---
That’s what happened to me. Not too much of a set back. Maybe like 20 mins to get the quests to get back on track. And some annoyance. But honestly it was worth it. The only bad thing I did was overdoing SM to the point where I was 2.5 lvls above the guide. I did SM runs for way too long though.
---
World pvp means nothing in phase one anyways. You can't even rank up till phase 2 for pvp. It will have little impact in the long run. After phase 2 starts it will be a blood bath.
---
Not really my point.
---
Dunno if you missed the Memespec DPS thread from the other day but MCP only adds about 100dps to a pre-raid-bis Druid.
---
Without MCP they sit at ~650DPS and with it ~750DPS. That makes Feral druids the the second top DPS at the start of the MC phase and with their Phase 1 BIS they’ll only get even better. Sorry to burst you bubble but (good) Feral druids are going to be nowhere near the bottom of the charts for the first few phases.
---
I took two weeks off - didn't tell my boss anything, however I'm a manager and all of my employees know I'm going to nerd it up on WoW the whole time.

But Runescape doesn't really have hardcore lore shared between the two versions.  Like, say they go ahead and put out a "WoW 2" with post phase 6 content, what bosses do they use?  What zones do they open up?  What story do we follow?
---
Think about this, most people aren't going to even get to level 40, let alone be 60 and raiding or even remotely serious about progressing in Naxx.  What is phase 7 content?  A tier after Naxx for ~10%-15% of all players?  How do you prevent power creep and disparity from someone who just hit 60 and another person decked out in phase 7 content gear?  It's already a bit of an issue in regular classic by the time tier 3 comes around.
---
[Talk about coincidence](https://i.imgur.com/jFx5AO5.jpg)

Me too, my buddies and I are playing just a little bit the first two days and really just holding off on powering through it until the weekend. Going to try to let the masses soar through it so we can pace through it and not spend too long in the starting zones.
---
Same, timing could not have been more perfect.
---
I’m going to be doing it, because it’s free money.  Stop in town, check if anyone was smart enough to post their craftables at a fair price, and buy the AH out with stuff I can turn around and vendor for more than I payed for it.  WORST CASE on my server and faction, I’ll get around to it once a day, which can be a long wait, and even if I’m the only one doing it, I’ve got super low standards and will walk away with just a 10% gain.  
---
It takes all of five minutes, maybe fifteen if the AH is just flooded with stuff.
---
Remember MMOvie and how it was meant to be the biggest WoW machinima anyone ever made?
---
I haven't played WoW in a really long time, so I'm having a hard time picturing how a Gnome Warlock would look like next to a Human one. Sometimes it looks pretty cool and sometimes it doesn't.
---
My first toon to ever hit 60 was a warrior and it wasnt until after ZG was out (I was an altoholic) but a buddy of mine got me into his guild and one night they were short for ZG so they brought me at lvl 58. I won a roll on halberd of smiting and much to peoples disappointment they actually gave it to me.. looking online now it says required lvl 60 but I thought I remembered using it to grind out ogres for my next 2 levels.
---
pretty certain that house only has herb/alch
---
We took a melee priest through to AQ40.
---
Stop saying hunters don't scale. They do, they just can't be min-maxed as other DPS like mage, warrior and rogue.
---
Also in order for warriors and rogues to push high DPS they need True Shot aura, otherwise they wouldn't.
---
Hunters are needed in raids that require Tranquilizing Shot. Hunters can also be helpful when pulling some bosses.  
---
End game raiding is not all about DPS, there are mechanics and overall team play that hunters fit and scale very well. After all your DPS can be 0 if you min-maxed the shit out of your character but don't know how to handle the fight mechanics well and die right after the mob is pulled.  
---
Outside of the raiding scene, hunters play very well doing quests, farming resources and reputation, and can really put up a challenge on PvP.  
---
There's a wave of miss informed people saying that a Raids shouldn't bring hunters if they can bring warriors, rogues or mages, that's a lie don't believe it. Every class in classic has its role when it comes to raiding and hunters are not excluded from it.
---
It's because the context is hugely important to such conversations. Not everybody reads an entire conversation thread, but it only takes 2 seconds to tack on the context of the conversation so as to avoid people arguing two different points back and forth.
---
Not sure why anyone ever thought this would be different. I have friends wanting to jump ship from Herod, but herd mentality is just gonna cause a flip flop. Just weather the storm, Herod will be fine.

Torn between Hunter, Priest and Rogue. I've played hunter extensively so I know it well. Priest I'm thinking Shadow and Rogue I'm not sure about. Any suggestions or advice?
---

How do people play with their monitors so low to the desk like that.
---
Can and will still give you the edge in getting the opener pretty much every time, passively. Yeah I know how strong stoneform is, but it's still an active ability with a cooldown. It's still a choice of preference is all I wanna say.
---
I'll be like this when I'm down to 7th in the queue down from 15k
---
Waiiiittt. How close is classic?
---
Layering is good. I'm the worst ganker you've probably ever met. I have massive fourm posts not leaving people alone. (Log off if you cant handle this War or goto PvE) 
---
Laying at the start is good for everyone except for people like me at the start. Your getting no honor or anything for lill each other so your left with PvP that is senseless. Your. it even getting honor kills lol. Me ganking someone once then them leaving the layer changes nothing. Theres someone else to go fuck with now.
---
At least female trolls are ugly af so it’s not hard to choose that part
---
Fantastic news, absolute garbage names though

it doesn't prove anything, it's evidence that strongly supports the idea that, that was indeed how /yell worked in older builds of WoW, notice that the text isn't red, even when typing /yell and it appearing red when you type it in
---
Die dachten wir taten es nicht, doch wir taten es.

And then check whether they clip popular helms
---
There's no way they're going to rename Herod.  There'd be so many disenfranchised players that would go into total meltdown after paying extra to reserve their names on THAT server.
---
Weird being 30 and considered the "youngin" still
---
Raiding isn't hard finding healers to raid is hard.
---
Hmm, I remember every once in awhile a guild member's hunter friend would come in to fill an empty spot and top me and the warlock, but I figured he was just much better geared than us. We were still running Kara and this dude was doing those big dick raids.
---
It's fucking nice out.
---
Who's trying to smoke some loud.
---
Hit my line. I got some loud.
---
In Vanilla you generally want to avoid pulling packs. Very few classes can even deal AoE damage let alone survive for more than a few seconds. Generally, even as a duo, you will pull enemies one at a time. Mana, however, shouldn't be a regular issue for you.
---
Lets break it down a bit. 
---
Assuming a warrior was leveling by himself he is not beholden to any resource other than his health because of how rage works. This means that warriors get a reputation for being slow levelers because they are slow to build rage, but by the time they get into a groove they have to stop and heal themselves. This means that, theoretically, if they had a someone healing them they would be able to keep fighting forever because they never have to stop to eat/bandage.
---
This is where the priest comes in, but first lets look at priest solo.
---
If a priest were leveling solo they have to manage health and mana, usually spending one to maintain the other. This is achieved by casting costly healing spells/shields to keep yourself alive, or sacrificing health and just eating damage while you wand things down. This is why most people see the most efficient method of killing mobs as a priest as casting shield, hitting a creature with pain and just wanding them dead because it gives you the best mix of keeping your health and mana topped off, although you WILL eventually have to stop to eat/drink playing this way.
---
When these two players get together you get the best of both worlds. A warrior has a reliable source of healing so they never really need to stop to heal, and when the priest gets low on mana he can just use his wand to keep dealing damage while his mana regenerates. By the time the warrior needs more healing, the priest has some mana back. Rinse - repeat.
---
Does that make sense?
---
[NA - PVE preferably - Alliance]
---
Planning on playing a Gnome Warlock like I originally did. Looking for LGBT/Queer friendly guilds. Raiding interests me, i did a bit of more hardcore raiding and could be up for it again with the right people.
---
Yeah the human racial works the same. The perception racial doesn't stack with a warlocks detect invisibility as far as I recall. The summons are a nice dps cooldown. You can equip the trinket, use the summon, then swap back to your original trinket before a pull. Either way, the damage difference will be minor, if you enjoy the human look more, you should ultimately roll that.
---
it seems that the title i have left makes it sound like she's genuinely pissed off, she doesnt actually care, she was just surprised. she doesnt actually care what i do in my own room, please guys, the FBI and battered husband association is knocking on the door... its just a title ...

No they are not in the addon atm, maybe something I can do in the future!

Talent trees looking like tradeskill menus, wish I had screenshots of that
---
you guys are missing a shaman...
---
&gt; Some dungeons like Wailing Caverns are much, much bigger than they are on retail
---
then don't do the whole thing?
---
Gnomer, for example, you just do one floor, reset, and then only do the whole thing once, just before you leave, for the quests.
---
I'm sorry but you're giving way too much complexity to what is a simple "us vs them" mentality.
---
No retailer is imagining how a successful classic will affect them, they simply pick sides because they have no interest and thus anyone who does is wrong.
---
Hey,
---
So basically this subreddit is toxic to its core, from the way it is moderated to the people that gather here.
---
Now your post was by no means toxic and had good intentions, yet it was removed because the moderators found it to be annoying.
---
And now in this follow up post you will have all the spergs leaving toxic comments saying why you are wrong and blah blah.
---
Not worth getting frustrated over man

So they're retarded because they chose Retribution?
---
What I mean to say is... "you" and "all" your little jack septic eye pewdiepie subscribing zoomers are adderall addled crack heads. Hopefully that clears up the confusion.
---
Warrior is the only class that can do more than one role effectively.  
---
Paladin is 100% viewed as a healer, unless you are totally in love with ret with no plans to raid I cannot suggest strongly enough to not do that.

My old Stormreaver crew is considering Alliance on Herod as well, unless the que time is too unbearable then we may go Stalaag.  So maybe I'll see ya there!
---
Well of course you haven't. If you had, you might have had the sense to move on. Kudos to those profit algorithms that push the design in this direction, yet remain subtle enough to keep you from having a stark realization. Well, that said, it's mostly your own attachment to your account and willingness to ignore the reality, but I bet those algorithms are top of the line. Good ol bobby wouldn't do it any other way.
---
If you ask on this subredit it’s going to be biased towards Classic including me. That said BFA is one of the most criticized expansions in the history of wow.  The two games are vastly different. 
---
What attracts you to the massive multiplayer online genre? For most it was playing with a lot of players on a large scaled open world. Which is exactly what you get in Classic. 
---
Classic is the one I  heartily recommend.
---
But if you are into: instant gratification, in general no challenges, instant superhero, pseudo single player game that is very polished, play BFA
---
However if you wanna experience: a vast community, huge living &amp; dangerous open world, from nobody to hero by taking small steps at a time (long term accomplishments), polished but a lot less though than BFA, thriving economy, profession that matters, well then Classic will be for you.
---
So do you want to be an instant superhero with no effort, or do you want to take upon a journey to just become a hero amongst many, and strive to be addicted to the accomplishments?
---
I wish I was 65 and retired so I could just play wow 24/7

UD spriest is old news man! At least it's not just considered the best by a mile today - more of a discussion than a rule. IMO Trolls are better at most match ups. Trolls have 10% chance to stun everyone that hits you every time they hit you with blackout procs on shadowguard, sguard also does considerable damage and applies shadow weaving/etc and is cheap/not on CD so you aren't worried about purges, HoW, and zerking (zerking is so underrated bc it is just reliably useful - not situational at all).
---
WotF is awesome but only against fearing classes, Devo Plague is so expensive (like .25-.33 of your mana pool depending on gear) and on CD so it's a priority dispel for any clever opposing priest or pally and any dwarf just stoneforms.
---
I'm 38 and while I read and comment, I'm not really invested in reddit. I've seen too many other platforms come, go, or change for the worse (Digg). Plus sometimes the groupthink that goes with the territory is too much for me. It's a real mob rule modding structure.

Just to confirm.  Does Joana's guide include picking up all the quests for dungeons, and then running them once?

Dungeons are part of the whole experience.  I definitely want to do each one.  Dungeons quests help to maximize your XP while doing them.

Does his guide include this?
---
Try Grobb, cant go wrong with Grobb, medium PoP right now
---
I feel like scaling monsters was an idea that looked good on paper, but ended up flawed in practice.
---
I don't know how to fix it. Maybe each zone could have a completion buff, that buffs you only in that zone. So you complete half the zone, you get a 10 percent buff to HP and damage. Complete 75 percent, get 15 percent buff. The numbers could be any amount.
---
What this would do is make you feel like you are getting stronger or more powerful in a zone, but it doesn't take away the part of scaling that lets you do zones in any order you want.
---
I haven't really thought this out or anything, so it's bound to have problems too. Just an idea.
---
Show me where I said Stalagg would STAY low.
---
Oh, what's that, you can't? Nice. Did you see the message about how Herod has so many people they're begging people to leave? Did you also see how server population status are based off of those around them? High pop could be 20k people. When 50-60% of those leave before hitting 60 I'll be enjoying my packed server.
---
Don't stir shit up. Herod will still be the larger more active server. &lt;3
---
pretty sure it's: The Ring
---
Exactly. They weren't exclusively thinking "what fits a sense of balance and scaling the best?", they were thinking "what would the world of Warcraft be like?" and that makes all the difference
---
Right? I always feel weird playing retail and they refer to you as "the champion".
---
Yeah I “played” a lot back in Vanilla but I was also in second grade so playing the game for me was just exploring and interacting with people. Over the years I finally hit max level but it was never a priority to me. The best memories I have of wow were from this time though and I’m excited to go back to it.
---
Good. Pile on the work. It'll make this week go faster.
---
Not that I have anything against Hunters, but this isn't the most representative fight. Except for melee occasionally having to step back after tanking a hateful strike if a healer failed to fully heal the HS tank, it's basically a DPS check with absolutely no mechanics and it's almost impossible for anyone to out threat the main tank.
---
It doesn't take in to account threat management, mechanics, splitting DPS between mobs, etc.
---
Don't get me wrong, it's absolutely great that a hunter managed to get high on the DPS charts here, but we don't know anything about how well geared this team is (clearly not that well if they're dying on Patchwerk), or how accomplished any of the players are, and this isn't an encounter representative of most encounters.
---
... what? So you hate most games in history? Games have a difficulty meter, they always have; even wow since Wrath has had a difficulty meter that rewarded you with more stuff. 
---
That's how it works. You don't have to do mythic, or heroic. There's nothing forcing anyone to steer out of normal or just running mythic +. That's all on the player and what they wanna do. 
---
If the players want better stuff, they do harder stuff. Classic sure will have difficult stuff, but barely any repeatable content. That's what keeps retail going; the never ending supply of content
---
Its 15 not 5
---
Most NA servers will be full by launch
---
The first thing I did on the laptop when we bought it was put in an SSD and do a clean install of windows. It's not my first rodeo!
---
That is a very good point. I feel like I can maybe get a good year out of just Classic but it will definitely feel stale doing the same things I've already done. I think the pipe dream for me is a classic+ where they add on to classic and not make it where you just play the expansion. This is obviously the age old question for MMOs, on how do you do that. But with just the sheer popularity I think Classic will have, it will show Blizzard that they went astray from their core of their game and need to do some serious research as to what people love about classic vs what retail has become. 
---
There is good and bad in both versions, if you can get the good from retail, fix the bad from classic, you essentially would have the perfect game, in my eyes. Obviously that is easier said than done.
---
Dat aspect ratio though haha. Old school.
---
 Looking for Alliance guild on a PvP server with morning or very late night raid times
---
I am open to Pacific or East coast. My available times are: **4am-11amPST or 11pm-3amPST availability all week**
---
**Main:** Human / Warrior / Fury (Open to gearing up in order to function as an OT)
---
Will have rogue and mage alts for money making.
---
Planning on no-lifeing for the first 1.5-2 weeks with family members who are also playing. The plan is to be 60, attuned, and farming BIS in that first 2 weeks.
---
Will probably play 20-30hours/week easy.
---
I want to focus on clearing content. No aspirations for world first or anything like that, just want consistent focus on progression and having fun with like minded people.
---
My current work schedule(2nd shift with possible extra time added to the end of shift) requires me to raid mornings or very late evenings in order to guarantee raid attendance. Anything from 4am-11am PST and 11pm-3am PST should work fine for me.
---
**Background**
---
Played Vanilla in 2005 as a rogue. Raided in TBC on the same rogue and a druid (heals then tank). Nothing special, but I am familiar with the game and with a few of the classes. I will be progressing much more quickly this time around. I played up until Wrath and was done when the game began going in a direction I did not care for. Looking forward to going back to Classic times. I am also looking forward to trying something new class-wise (Warrior).
---
So what? Anything from scratch will have downsides too (or things some people like and others don't). The upsides in tbc and wrath outweighed the downsides big time.
---
You are like the guy wanting the mystery box prize instead of the boat
---
Alliance are generally better suited for pve because of pallys, and my experience is that Horde are usually more concerned with pvp
---
This will be worth more than any other gaming sub you have ever payed for.
---
Same with Romanians. Drinking together, damn fine.  WoW...ehh, we better not play together.
---
Survey of oce specifically that’s been run on the oce classic discord. Subject to data that’s been collected anyways. But showing 1300 horde to 1000 alliance roughly at last count.
---
You have to travel back.  I would just stay in your own starting areas until level 10.
---
Either that or, if she's going to be slower, just level up your druid to 10 in the first 3 hours, get your quest done, and then meet her up in Dun Morogh and finish that out together.
---
Or, set hearth in Teldrassil, take the boat to Wetlands, get the FP, and do the drowning skip to get to her area.  You can do that in less than ~20 minutes.  If she's at all slower than you, you'll be fine.  You just won't have level 8 abilities until you go back at level 10 for the bear quest.
---
8 quote this scene all the time. Audibly chuckled seeing this
---
Hahaha nice, I've actually experimented with that style of layout in the past. Even now, I'm tempted to add in the shift modifier.
---
My biggest issue is that I use alt+whatever for the base G13 binds, and if I use shift paging then bartender's binds don't seem to work.
---
Weirdly, shift+alt+bind works fine on my normal keyboards, it's only on the G13 that it doesn't.
---
i leveled a troll on retail and the quest where you have to kill a caged naga, you wait like 2 seconds for the cage to be open and it took less than that to kill it
---
Thanks for taking the time to reply, Nollie the IDIOT! Haha! I've just gone through your post history and you are indeed, a grumpy old man!
---
You have just been corrected by a youngster! How does that make you feel?
---
Next time, think twice before making passive aggressive corrective comments!
---
Right up until the sundering? The dark trolls became elves.
---
No way in hell every server does not have a queue time on day 1. Many people will probably hop onto one of the lower RP servers even if it's just to level a character to 10-15 that they'll never play again and just want to   play classic WoW.
---
Get an amd apu laptop and you'll be good. Vega 8 runs wow very well for what it is.
---
This has nothing to do with it and the more your generation uses this silly generalization the more you look stupid for it.
---
Not Blizzards problem. You don't have to pay for classic as a base game. If you want to play WC1-2 on GoG you have to. They could have sold the base game for 30$.
---
I plotted out my leveling path for basically 1-24/25 as a Paladin. This includes my level 20 quest for *that* mace. I've also done my homework on where I can get some low level healing gear so when it comes to my dungeon quests I'm good. 
---
After that? I have no clear plan. I decided I'd wait and plot it out after I get my mace.
---
or 20 member (so far) guild ranges from 18 to 60 year olds.  With at least half over 40.  Most haven't played since Cata.  It will be glorious.
---
That's one of those inside jokes that'll last for as long as you're all friends haha
---
? 
---
why not just let us play on herod and if you don't wanna join the party you can roll on pagel or something
---
Yeah they also had a much better contrast and black was really black. Think this only possible on flat screens since OLEDs became a thing a few years back
---
Honestly yall's age group are the ones I'm looking forward to connecting with over what may be a silly reason.
---
I group up playing WoW as a teenager and when not playing with irl friends mostly played with my dad's adult only guild. These guys and gals ranged from early 30's (my age now) to mid 60's. I can't help but feel like there will be something unique and fun about connecting with a player who was my age now when the game first came out and getting to understand the perspective those "old folks" had when I was a kid. lol
---
And one is never too old to learn and enjoy new things! (even a 15+ year old game)
---
Beautiful. Could you scan that so we can use it as a wallpaper?
---
My warlock there must have been too much for it. sorry about that.
---
&gt;I'm just annoyed because since we are stupid apes I'm so sure my ideas are better than others.
---
Of course, it's not even that I think your idea is *that* bad - although I do not like barbershop in Classic it is far from the worst they could do. But as you say, it opens a door and will compromise the whole project.
---
&gt;Lmao, RIP man. I hope you like to heal, or tank a bit in early content haha.  
---
I think Druid is the best example of a class that is fucky in Vanilla compared to its potential.
---
Yeah, I actually like all specs of druid in later xpacs (except Guardian once they did the feral split), but healing is my preferred spec - only in Vanilla it sucked. I love HoT healing, but despite druids clearly being designed for it, they can't really do it due to dumb stuff like how buffs works in vanilla and balance issues. So I won't go druid for Classic. But I totally agree, druids had so much potential, but I also think that it is the class that took the longest for Blizzard to get somewhat right for that exact reason.
---
So hunter it is for me in Classic!
---
I think it stacks while SS didn't.
---
A few more interesting nuggets:
---
 - mages had invisibility, called Lesser Invisibility.  And it was full on invis to where you could not see them if they were running around you.  It wasn't like stealth where they'd phase in and out depending on how close you were to them.  Invis was later 86'd for being far too OP.
---
 - there was no falling damage.  You could jump from any height without consequence.
---
 - Infernals guarded entrances to zones that were still under construction.  Getting close to them was instant death.
---
 - I don't think there was ever being a character wipe, though it was mentioned that it could potentially happen.  However, when the level cap was 39, there was a currency and gear wipe where every character was stripped of literally everything, forcing people to start over.  It was impractical to continue on our maxed out toons as we didn’t have the gear to fight anything our level in order to ATTAIN new gear, so naturally, most everyone just started from scratch.  This is when the pvp server was introduced and I made my mage.
---
 - There was no buyback option.  I ugly-cried when I accidentally sold my mechanostrider right back to the vendor as soon as I bought it.
---
If you want to see the maps visit this blog: https://playvanilla.blogspot.com/p/maps.html
---
Not saying this OP runs the website linked, but whoever does just took the images from there and posted it to their site, which is full of garbage ads. Yeah, no thanks.
---
Blizz don’t open one server, only one pvp and one pve. Which one should they open? If pvp then the outrage continues that there is no pve server for ppl who don’t want to pve. If they open both then pve will be super low after 3 months.
---
I can’t get over how excited I am. Only a week away from something g I have been hoping to happen for over 10 years.
---
Yeah, well...this is probably 1/3rd or less of what is coming at launch.
---
 when is street view going to be available?
---
Does that actually mean much though?  Like, it seems like you just skip the first 15 levels and use a few less copper bars to me.  That's not much.
---
the middle monitor is 3440x1440 and the side one is 24inches
---
My first guild from TBC-release would likely be a majority of folks aged 45+. Many of them were in their mid to late twenties.
---
Nicholaes, I am at my wit's end with you!
---
The evidence I have posted, strongly suggests that the /yell feature (as quoted by the original poster), was indeed, not red, at the time of taking the screenshot.
---
In order to claim that it was /e, and not /y, you would indeed need to supply me evidence that suggests that /y was red, at the time of OP taking their screenshot.
---
I hope you understand Nicholaes! You can do it!
---
I have bad news for you... 
---
1. There is no arena 
---
2. The first BG is not available until several months after release
---
just took my first computer science class guys, Moores law everything btw
---
oh, that would be nice
---
Ehh not really. If I was invested enough in a name waiting in a que  for the first week or 2 would be worth it.  You are talking about a mild inconvenience here it's not like they are literally suffering to keep thier chosen name.  They are just going to stare at the login screen for a few minutes longer than some of us.
---
Interesting, thank you for your reply - I never expected so many to leave I suppose time will tell.
---
There are also a lot of adults on the sub that think they will be good about monitoring their time, but will find themselves waking up early and staying up late to play the game.  Unlike retail, you don't really 'finish' your daily stuff and then log off. You can just keep playing and grinding whatever it is you were grinding.
---
'One last thing' turns into 'holy shit, it's 1am' very easily.
---
Same boat!  I have a long planned family vacation - I have a laptop and currently thinking I will bring it, but worried I’ll not be able to stop playing at night and then too tired to enjoy family time.  Thinking I should go cold turkey and not even log on.  But I know if I have time on vacation and I don’t have my laptop I’ll regret it!!!
---
Are there any big moments that if that one thing went differently it would result in a different timeline?
---
I would love it if they managed to kept it secret and everything was the same until you get to an important cutscene  and a named character makes a drastically different decision than we are used to.
---
Oh yeah.  By the time the guild is progressing and clearing AQ there are a lot of core raiders that no longer need to do MC, but plenty of others that do so just about anyone who can fill a slot can get in by that time.
---
Sponsor a series of DUELING TOURNAMENTS with fabulous cash and prizes.  Using Challonge to run brackets.
---
Definitely not. Alliance is USA was much more similar. They squabble among each other, they love their alliance, full of freedom and peace for their people. Xenophobic. Rich capital cities sending armies against huts in the desert. Yep alliance is USA checks the hell out for me.
---
well depending on class/spec you could raid and PvP in the same spec
---
It's kind of funny that we live in a world where a Dane can go on vacation to Spain and be mad that they don't speak English there.
---
Which region?
---
Dude shut up we have perfect balance right now. 
---
Ahem grobbulus is a terrible server full of meanies just go play somewhere else.
---
You could pick a role or a more casual guild that allows you to go more of a hybrid pvp/PvE spec. Really just anything that allows you to not respec as often
---
I've got a better solution. Come play on Grobbulus you Blaz Blue playing SOB.
---
Finally, years ago i always dreamed of being 35 and playing clasic wow. Now all the younger people can make fun of me when raiding like i used to do to when i was a kid lol
---
Lost faith in the average German gamer?
---
&gt;every server is at full or high
---
New servers are coming soon. Be looking out for a blue post soon. I have connections at Blizzard!
---
No, the hd4000 is more than capable to run wow classic. It even runs retail but you have to lower some settings on that
---
Interesting thank you for your reply - I suppose 9k or so would not be world breaking though much more than I am used to in vanilla.
---
It was my fault, I guess.  After we quit WoW, I talked him into getting Guild Wars 2, which appealed to him to quit WoW immediately because it didn't require a subscription.  Now he keeps reflecting that in comparison.
---
Gay.
---
May have tanked a boss or two in my day.
---
Keybind target markers onto your num pad. This always helped me. 1 is skull, 2 is X, etc...
---
Avoid charging into mobs, especially if you're not very familiar with the dungeon layout. Pull with a ranged weapon instead, back to a safe spot, ideally around a corner so ranged/caster mobs move up into melee range. Avoid pulls at 0 Rage, either try to have some left-over from last pull, have Bloodrage ready, or occasionally maybe a Rage potion.
---
Use CC whenever possible - this is a great way to reduce incoming damage and make your healer spend less mana. Many classes do not have great AoE damage anyway, especially early on. Don't bother with Sap though, ranged CC is much safer and faster.
---
Kill order is very case-by-case, but I would CC annoying mobs and deal with them last - notably, stuns/disarms/slows hurt you a lot, those are often from the beefy melee types. Alternatively, if there's no convenient corner to pull, CC the ranged/casters instead. Healers or heavy AoE casters should be preferably killed first and fast, or CC'd instead.
---
Don't worry about stance switching too much - at least up to your 30s, there is little to no reason to leave Def stance. If you pool your rage, there is no benefit in Charging, you don't need Thunderclap, and Retaliation is on a 30min CD. Even past lv30, it's mostly about popping Berserker Rage before the pull for a little extra Rage.
---
Don't worry about threat meters while leveling - mark a skull, tab-target sunder all the mobs, and if skull stops hitting you, taunt him back. Threat meters is a raid thing.
---
Much more important is your UI setup - have Target-of-Target displayed, and have both tab-forward and tab-backward bound. This way you can just tab through the pull, check each mob's debuffs and if they are actually hitting you or the melee DPS next to you. Some sort of Aggro highlighting on group frames also helps.
---
Solve one bug and 10 more take its place.
---
No, and I enjoy retail WoW.
---
For a week
---
The difference in Classic WoW was that it was a WORLD, not just a game. That’s why it incentivized you pouring in hundreds of hours, which most games don’t
---
Lmao
---
Georgian reporting for duty.
---
But if they did follow Pam, then they would have to shadow drop the launch on like Sunday night like Pam unexpectedly surprised Jim haha
---
Another server prolly coming this week
---
Amazed it would be so many - I suppose they are counting on game being a failure rather than a success, shame.
---
Americas. Maybe UK as well? Germany is getting two new servers tomorrow.
---
It is a map of my favorite Cam star's body... nothing out of the ordinary.
---
Its not close till people start posting Majoras Mask screenshots
---
its a married joke, its fine, i can put a big picture of a dick if i want.. men in marriages like to say that the women get to choose what goes on the walls because we dont actually care
---
Perhaps even moreso since they are retail players.
---
Yea I just noticed 2hr later lol. My bad :p
---
Prebis warrior does more damage than any other class and if you aren't bringing buffs and consumables you aren't a raider.
---
Wait for phase two while leveling a new alt 😎
---
&gt; 'One last thing' turns into 'holy shit, it's 1am' very easily.
---
You mean, "Holy shit the sun is out already?"
---

What's the point of delaying bgs and honor system?
---
PM hype train?
---
I’ll upload a couple old screenshots when I get home, we didn’t know shit back then. I remember routinely two shotting people on my hunter lol. Yeah we know every single value now, but half the people were running around with the wrong stats on everything. I remember seeing mages with strength gear. Memes weren’t even a thing in 2005
---
What server? Despite living here too, I'm rolling on a PST server for later raid nights.
---
Saw someone saying that tank druid would be better.
---
Good to see some of Relentless' finest coming out of the retirement home.
---
*cries in Hunter*
---
If multiboxing wasn't an advantage why are people playing it to get an  advantage then?
---
For the record:
---
Stat Weights
---
1 Agility = 1 AP, 0.03% Crit, 0.7% Dodge
---
1 Strength = 1 AP
---
29 Agility = 1% Crit, 2% Dodge
---
I’ve got a Google Doc like this but err doesn’t look as good!
---
It's literally like half of what other DPS classes do
---
You could always go with RPPVP server. Those are usually just more mature PVP servers-
---
Yup new servers are absolutely coming
---
Maybe if I framed it as “you can create an alt, send him all your light leathers, and in the time it takes to run them to the nearest leather trainer, you basically doubled the amount of light leather you ever skinned.  If you could skin 200 light leather in 5 minutes, would you?”
---
I think there will be plenty of tourists.
---
In vanilla you didn't have modern wow to look to. Yeah people shit on BfA for having little social dynamic but it fills in many gaps that vanilla doesn't have.
---
Balanced/viable classes, more interesting/involved rotations, more mechanical raids, xmog, difficulty tiers, rated pvp, content drips
---
It won't be dead, but once we get into phase 4+ populations are going to start dwindling, especially if the next xpac has more vanilla-like inspirations.
---
Always level in PVP spec
---
Narrator:
---
You did.
---
Stalagg announcement blue post was just unstickied and every PvP server is High/Full now.
---
It's happening.
---
He got too specific with the details and the specific details don’t add up.
---
I think scaling zones work for bfa. Leveling  in bfa is such a mess you out level a zone before completion. This way you can finish. They have a tough road ahead of them when I comes to figuring out leveling in retail wow
---
You take 8 restoration shamans to a raid? I get your point but I was referring specifically to Resto.
---
that seven in the pussy
---
Okey! Nice answer. Have friend that wants to play on it so that is why I'm considering it!
---
The look is quite a big deal for many in Classic. Adding more hairstyles is not a compromise, it is probably way worse than being able to change hairstyle post-creation. It changes the feeling of the game toward modern WoW. I could live with barbershop, though I'd prefer it not being there - but to actually add new haircut would ruin it for me. Sure Vanilla is not just good because of rose-tinted glasses, but nostalgia *is* a strong aspect too. Seeing modern WoW visuals ruins that nostalgic feeling of entering the original game again.
---
From the census I think there are less druids in general on horde, so i think you will find your most use there, Lok'tar Ogar.
---
**Benevolent Elephants**. US, Alliance, Fairbanks PvP Server, PST based Semi-Hardcore Casual Guild.
---
​
---
Our Plan:
---
* To raid in a Semi-Hardcore Casual way. What does that mean? Casual number of raid nights and length of raids. But hardcore when inside the raid. Progression is the number one goal.
---
* To build a quality team of like-minded gamers interested in everything Classic WoW.
---
* Progression Raiding, 5 mans, and some optional PvP.
---
* We plan to clear every raid in Classic, including Naxx long term. Given the mixed style of casual and hardcore, we don’t plan on being world/server first, and that is ok!
---
About Us:
---
* Goal-driven mature gamers. 
---
* We love gaming and enjoy accomplishing our goals with friends.
---
* Many of us play nightly while others play casually.
---
* We understand real life/gaming balance and work with all our members to ensure everyone has a place.
---
* We are parents, workers, family members, and of course, gamers.
---
* Experienced leadership with successful raid experience from vanilla, to current high end Mythic raiding.​
---
Who we want:
---
* Mature gamers driven by a passion to succeed.
---
* Gamers who want to clear content in a timely manner in a non-toxic environment alongside other laid-back adult gamers.
---
* Members willing to put real effort into their class/role and work to be the best they can be.
---
* Members who understand real life constraints, yet still desire to clear content.
---
* Members who respect and appreciate other people’s time by being Punctual, Prepared, and Motivated.
---
* Casual Members/PvPers/Non-A team raiders are always welcome. Likely to form a “B Team” more casual raid group.
---
Goals:
---
* Kill all the bosses, with a core group of “A Team” Raiders.
---
* Make new friends.
---
* Make LOTS of new memories and relive some past ones.
---
Secondary Goals:
---
* Build a successful pvp team during non-raid nights. (Optional)
---
* Build a “B team” raid group that is more casual once inside the raid(think little to no consumes required)
---
The Important Info:
---
* Server: Fairbanks PvP
---
* Raid Nights: Tuesdays and Wednesdays (With a possible Optional 3rd night being added once AQ drops, to be discussed with guild when the time comes.)
---
* Times: 8pm to 11pm Pacific time
---
* Faction: Alliance
---
* Voice: Discord
---
* Loot: EPGP with LC oversight for at least a few months to see how much the guild and the leadership like it. If EPGP is deemed to be not good. We will use Loot Council instead, decisions made public in a member read only discord page, to help transparency. Or publicly in the main discord voice channel. Exact details on the transparency to be fine tuned over time.

farm like a mofo on your main or alts. i have no idea how the economy will end up on this server but i had a warrior who i'd MT and also PvP with. i had an alt (hunter) that i'd farm mobs in places like winterspring/EPL for drops while also skinning and mining. skinning and mining was still feasible on the warrior in prot, just took longer. hopefully the market will still be there in this version.
---
Grab some bandages then. Some things are frustrating. Don't make it a habit of hanging out around their patrols if they're that much of a problem for you. It's part of the gameplay, and if a roaming mob that you *might* run into once while farming completely ruins the experience for you then maybe you're playing the wrong game.
---
Real

I will be right there with you....Herod or bust!

This is a point a lot of people criticize about my post, and I thing it's because I didn't have time to go more in depth in my explanation.
---
When i said it made sense, I wasn't necessarily putting it into a realistic context. I meant more that it seemed common sense to me, or at least, that it clicked in a way that I didn't find that particular "inconvenience" frustrating. When a frost mob would resist my frostbolt it didn't make me mad or think "lol that's dumb" it made sense to me.
---
As to your point why would a guy made of fire be hurt by melee...I always imagined that melees had "enchanted" or magical weaponry that made that possible. Also because, you can displace parts of his form by hitting him.
---
I'm glad you appreciated the post!

Oh god, the old days of logging in and never logging out to avoid queues once you're in. Hmm. Maybe this really will be an authentic experience. 
---
To be fair though, Blizzard should honestly kick people out regardless after a big chunk of time (like IDK... 18 hours). For your health, you gotta sleep, man!
---
How much better do you think shamans are over paladins when stacking warriors? I'm not sure how far behind windfury, might is etc. Or the fact paladins are clearly the better healer so the chances of someone dying is far less likely.
---
IMO everything looks terrible on gnomes.
---
Imagine spending $10 for a name.
---
There are in the picture beneath orc feet
---
There's a guild floating around on this sub trying to recruit people. Their officer corps is two boomkins, an Spriest, a hunter and a Ret. They told my buddy since they made the Discord they feel like it's okay that they are almost all playing meme specs and can have 36 people carry them.
---
Yeah, good luck.
---
If I lived in Europe I'd seek out the Dutch server too. Only country where I can honestly say that everyone I've met from there is a bro.
---
Attunements, Aqual Quintessence, Keys, Gear, Alchemy recipes, Black Lotus, Epic Mount.
---
Typical I picked the dodgy server.
---
Nope. they tried to make this addon and blizzard shut it down
---
I assume most posts are joking. If OP isn’t, then I’m sure *most* of the upvotes are people laughing along, like me. I might get a little less sleep and stay up a little late for a few days after launch, but I’m not gonna turn myself into a zombie. 
---
As a contrast to OP’s title, I instead can’t wait to have something to do *until* I get sleepy. No more going to bed at 11 pm because I don’t feel like doing anything then, and not being able to fall asleep til 1. Instead I’ll just be up til 1 =D
---
I mean people are allowed to join after launch...
---
They need to add at LEAST 1 more pacific and 1 more east coast pvp server.  I don't see why they are waiting until they are completely full before doing this.  Getting people to switch servers even before launch isn't that straight forward.
---
EXcept the reasons behind the monthly fees largely no longer applies to classic.
---
The way a football team "plays for the fans" you can argue the dev team "works for the players" hence his use of "our" is completely reasonable even if he doesn't work for Blizzard IMO

---
idk too much about shamans i only played alliance in vanilla, but my quess is most ppl who want to play a hybrid spec are ret paladins, and they are directly taking gear away from the best dps class in the game, which get more out of the items than ret. personally i dont care because im gonna raid as holy paladin and the hybrid specs wont affect me at all.
---
They already set it up for that lore wise. Wow classic is wow retail after the gnomes built a temporal discombobulator and went back in time to stop the cataclysm ever happening.
---
How much crit do you typically get leveling anyway?  Like less than 20% for sure?  I don't even know if putting heavy points into deep wounds/impale.  I'd almost rather get points into parry (mitigation is always good) and improved charge (extra rage is always good).  Even the same thing for axe spec isn't always a given.  Although 30 and ~40 you're getting Whirlwind/Herod axe, but you're getting the Staff or Mace from Mauradon and depending what 2h you get as you approach 60 it might not be as good.
---
One can only hope.
---
But they can fire up realms in seconds...which they will do, because man, the avalanche that is resubbing on 26th will put the entire Blizzard on overdrive.
---
&gt; I wanting to get a reality check on how bad this would be for aq 40 and naxx as either him as a offtank or dps. I'm sure there would be a couple fights it might be good for a bear tank, but i really don't know.
---
They can tank AQ and Naxx, its all a matter of how much effort you put into it to make it work.
---
I'm not sure that a single, low-resolution image for Blackrock Depths constitutes a "guide." You need a novel for that place.
---
There is a print on eBay. Front side only. $80 free shipping.  
---
I got it to by typing in something like World of Warcraft Map Brady Games.
---
Brits are on Shazzrah btw.
---
Dont under estimate a legion of little kids trying to find a place to fit in.
---
I'll be doing the "pve to pvp" treadmill for a while I think.
---
To be competitive in pvp you'll be forced to pve for gear, professions and consumables.
---
I'll be playing a lot until winter rolls round. Hopefully I'll have enough gear to stay relevant by then lol
---
Every blizzard launch has been a disaster? Just flat out wrong
---
So, back when they first introduced Rested XP, you had to be in an Inn and online to get any of that sweet rested xp.  This didn't include time logged off.  
---
The thought from the developers is that it would incentivize people to meet up in certain areas (inns) to kick back and socialize.  They were really trying to sell the idea with how it was worded...like hanging up your cloak and putting your feet up to speak with others of your worldly adventures.
---
Of course, that was ridiculous and didn't last long at all.  It was changed pretty quickly to allow rested XP to accumulate while you were logged off.
---
I think reading a bit of guides then learning by playing is good. After playing for a while you can read guides again and understand them better.
---
Usually people can focus on learning one to three things, so learning a bit at a time gives the best result.
---
Relive
---
So?
---
Is there a way for me to get that on my Snapchat?
---
11pm
---
It's FOMO gripping people.  Thinking if they don't get 60 fast they'll miss out on raiding and fat loots.
---
What have they lied about so far regarding Classic?
---
Yup, and the same thing was said days ago when I said Stalagg would be full and I was "wrong".
---
Live your life. Do it for the rested XP.
---
yet another useless post that doesn't contribute to the subreddit at all
---
Everyone will enjoy the game, they way they want to enjoy it.  For me, and a lot of people, my enjoyment doesn't truly start, until I'm max level.  The faster I get there, the better.
---
For you, it's the journey, and not the end-game.  Nothing wrong with that.
---
Have fun!  I know I will!
---
All cleaves? Lol what?
---
So you’re saying my idea of Herod II: Electric Boogaloo, still has a shot?
---
Try downloading it because it's definitely 1920x1080
---
Most rpers don’t rp all the time or very often at all. What’s the problem with playing on an rp pvp server if you never go into character? As long as people follow the rules and don’t fuck with rpers I don’t see what the problem is.
---
Pretty much all the pvp servers are high.  What the heck does Blizz think is going to happen on launch day?  Them not creating any more servers now makes me think they assume 90% of the players have already signed up.  If that number is a more reasonable 50% it's going to be launch day chaos.
---
Attunements, Farm for gold/consumables, gear up, and pvp
---
He said GMT (BST)
---
Jesus.. I cringed so hard
---
That would be pretty damn ideal. Hopefully I can find such an arrangement.
---
Lmao, this right here...
---
I understand blizz doesnt wanna create a vacuum of dead servers after phase 1 players leave/quit the game. But ive got 3 friends alone that are planning to sub the day of.
---
thicc thott
---
Nice sheet.  It has been suggested to put your first 5 talent points into Cruelty and then respec at 40 for Mortal Strike, or possibly at 37 when you get Impale.  5% crit is one of the most important things you can use at earlier levels.
---
Is there a reason you don't push for Overpower at all?  You're prioritizing high ranks of stuff like Hamstring, but using rank 1 Overpower and greatly delaying training the second rank of the talent.  It's a *big boom* ability that can save your life, which you typically won't see from something like 2H Spec.
---
Hello!
---
Oh easily, they need a minimum of 3 servers I'd say, and those 3 will be full. They optimally need 5 more PvP servers.
---
thats why you give the item to one of the other 10 warriors you have, my bet is all of them arent assholes.
---
Yes Grob is a RP pvp realm. That means it follows the rules of rp realms unlike solely pvp or pve realms.
---
Half of what a single mage can do by stacking ignite? Yes. Half of what the other mages and rogues/warriors/locks do? No way. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBSnGwxmOSU
---
There's examples. It's at max 30% less than the other classes, so noticable I agree, but not useless in the slightest. We're also talking about best possible parses here, which means best possible perfomance + gear. As hunters don't scale that much but other classes do, this means that unless you only raid with BiS min/maxers, you won't see these results.

Thanks.  First, I said it doesn't affect anyone already, so no need to repeat.
---
Second, disgusting?  Ridiculous choice of word there.  It does affect me because I pretty much only play games with him, not to mention this was the game we played together for quite a while.
---
Third, I said I was venting, just venting.  You could easily scroll on past the post to the next one.
---
The feeling of going full pre-raid blues for the first time.
---
The felling of going full purple for the first time.
---
The feeling of finally getting my 8/8
---
The feeling of Getting my PB + CHT.

The only thing that has ever come close to that was the first time my guild got heartbreaker on XT in Ulduar.

Leveling: Skinning+Tailoring     
---
60: Drop Skinning, pick up Ench or Eng      
---
       
---
Trying to level Enchanting while you're leveling will just leave you broke. It's better to vendor greens at the start than DE them. And besides the few Tailoring patterns that use leather that you might craft, you'll primarily be vendoring the leather, not putting it on the AH.
---
In Vanilla, there wasn’t. But who knows how it’s gonna be in Classic. I’m guessing not.
---
Only thing I can critique is it should say 8 race selectionS plural, and 7 streams we're sniping sounds better imo
---
Just level your cooking skill to max for the best snacks
---
They were under a blood curse. What were the Humans under when they threw all the Orcs into concentration camps and made them fight for sport? Thralls name literally means “slave,” and was given to him by Blackmoore.
---
And don’t forget that the Draeni invaded a perfectly fine planet of Draenor that the Orcs inhabited for generations. They brought their problems to the Orcs. If not for the Draeni then the Legion would have never known about the Orcs, tricked them into drinking the demon blood, and none of the problems that followed would have happened.
---
On Gehennas, Lezonta is there, a really handsome horde priest streamer. He won‘t have impact on the server as he is a small streamer, but running pvp with him must be really fun!
---
the Scholomance key is the funniest part, but you can just do the "res on the otherside trick" so the key isn't that important, still funny tho
---
Rename the server to something stupid... problem solved
---
Well, I'm American, so clearly I believe that the world and everything in it revolves around me.

Fuck yeah atlanta. Hopefully i see it when i go to school next week
---
Inconveniences in immersive games make them more fun. If you remove all the inconveniences it stops being an adventure and becomes a tour.
---
Like, one of my favorite games, Cataclysm: Dark Days ahead does have starvation, sleep deprivation, stamina management, and permanent character death, and it would be significantly less interesting if you removed any of those things.
---
WoW doesn't focus as much on survival but it has strong focuses on exploration and combat, so exploration and combat should have inconvenient things about them that you have to work around because working around them, like, *is* the gameplay.
---
yeah we saw it the first time

solid choice, could be a lifesaver.

Whats with the personal attack? players like Venruki and Cdew are actually very skilled in PVP and could attract other high tier players
---
The ironic thing is you sound like a teenager / 12 year old flaming lol

Its Elvish propaganda.  Only an elf could push the agenda that a mere level 4 in a starter zone was the one out looking for blood.

This act will not go unpunished...

You’re a savage if you eat Cheetos or Doritos while gaming!

Yeah I guess I don't see the harm in releasing rather quickly, the average player had a similar experience throughout while any raiders will be farming these places for months with nothing next in line.

There needs to be.

Yah, I remember the Reds chasin' me and me trusty mule when I was mining at Felucca.
---
I still remember one Red's name, PhrEDDaKiLlAh complete with this mashed up lettering. All the cool kids were using this writing style ca 2002.
---
I asked one Red why he was chasin' blue toons and he said he roleplayed a character that defended monsters against players. I kid u not. This guy was a griefer troll before the term was ieven widely used.
---
Priest is a great healer or offhealer partner with mage, and always has been.
---
you are a subreddit treasure.
---
Okay, Miles.  I didn't know my uncle had a Reddit sub! Kidding aside, I do see the logic behind it, especially since right now actual WoW comes with several expansions and costs the same monthly as Classic.
---
Fairbanks master race.
---
Wait... for real? What?
---
GMT ≠ BST
---
1 week off babyyyy then here I come 487236427 hour queue
---
Well consider that they're basing the server population on characters created, not unique players online. So... sorta divide this by 3? The populations are really not representative of how many people are actually going to be playing them. Don't get me wrong, Herod will have a queue, but it's probably going to be like an hour, not 4
---
Nah, I was always envious of druids as a rogue. They could stealth like me but also heal and tank.
---
Gonna be so satisfying being on the other end of faerie fire
---
New servers coming. 
---
Fairbanks I’m guessing is on the verge of full. 
---
If new servers do come I’m jumping ship. Right now unless your on RP server your gonna have queues.
---
I played everquest before I played WoW.  People forget that vanilla WoW was meant to be the more casual friendly, easier, and more forgiving to mistakes for it's day.  And it absolutely was.
---
Bald is good but if hair is a must I also like that huge ponytail, kinda reminds me of LotR orcs for some reason.
---
Was mostly like black metal only in those days. I think some variety is needed.
---
There is a keyboard/mouse cleanliness concern but I think I can do it lol
---
So I need to know.  Is there actually a place in France where the naked ladies dance?
---
I’m 34 and all alone ._.
---
I feel it's more important to be clear--even at the risk of sounding redundant.
---
Personally, if I saw the "non-redundant" sentence from your examples, I would assume the author was talking about PvE, unless stated otherwise. And I feel many people would make the same assumption--or simply not know what to assume. By including the extra four words, you're preventing your reader from having to guess. Worth it, in my opinion.
---
It's good to limit redundancy, but sometimes it's required to ensure you're understood.

u/ActuallyaBlackBear
---
Looking for a guild with event times 9pm-12am central time (10-1am EST).  At BEST I could get on by 8:30 central, but would risk being late.  Not seeing many options for this time slot. 
---
Prefer horde PVP server.   Currently have names saved on Herod, but would be more than happy to avoid the queue times.
---
Cocaine and black coffee.
---
Well executed!
---
How so?
---
One of the biggest differences between retail and classic is that in classic leveling is a part of the game.  In retail, leveling is some requirement before you get to the real game.
---
But then it won't be 
---
F R E SH
---
Piercing Howl is very good during leveling. Warriors often have to run/reset and PH is very good for that. Not only it's AOE but it's also 10 yards range and it's a spell so it's more reliable (no BS miss/parry/dodge like hamstring does).
---
It went low pop only after the great Spanish exodus though.
---
Buuuuut honestly, it seemed like an improvement at a time and even after Freak Circus and Ailus Orbis migrated away, there were still enough guilds left for meaningful progression and occasional bit of guild drama. It wasn't until late TBC that it turned into a complete ghost town.
---
Is the quest to learn how to take a screenshot on your pc, rather than taking a slanted pixel ridden picture with a potato phone?
---
Definitely! Wasn't trying to say that wow is the most difficult game at all, simply that the "inconveniences" that it through at the player seemed to be a part of the world, they made sense.
---
People have reffered to it as being "Diagetic", as it seems to be a part of the world.
---
yeah, the title is also slightly a joke.. its a married joke, you know? my wife wears the pants kind of joke.. people that are not married do not get it
---
Come on moar dots
---
If you're a tually playing you get one. On any other screen back of the queue
---
No, the first PvP kill *RECORDED* in history of WoW.
---
This is far from the first, actual, PvP kill.
---
Weird heavy bread like that (the stuff that stays soft on the inside) plus an *insane*  amount of salt seems to be the problem for me.  
---
I eat plenty of food, and not all of it is healthy.  The trick for me seems to be to keep the salt/bread/sugar down, and then im fine.
---
Can only be activated at a Flight Master. Problem solved.
---
You can think of it like every recipe staying orange/yellow/green for 15 more levels, that's actually quite huge for leveling it, but other than that it's kinda irrelevant.
---
Wether we knew the coefficients or not, I’m 100% sure they haven’t changed. That being said, I’d love to see the screenshots. 
---
Also, why do you specify clothies, when Arcane Shot does arcane damage?
---
I’m pretty sure every wow tattoo ever made was a horde logo
---
And if they didn't had name reservations...and you would see 4 realms at launch, isn't this the exact same crap?
---
Split community my ass.
---
The tauren/mulgore quests can be a huge pain as well
---
Gotta love is generation of people who just want attention
---
This is appropriate. Seven more days till the beginning of the end of my college career and life as I know it!
---
I don't doubt that we'll see a delay to phase 2 while they sort servers.  They have said time and time again that there will be no layering in phase 2.  You can't have it when they bring in the World Bosses.  
---
I think servers like Herod will have layering exist longer than some of the lower population servers.  But every time they reduce the max layer count means potential for larger queues, or queues when there weren't queues.  
---
In the end, they're going to get to a point where they say "hey, we have zero layers active on servers.  Please understand that things will not be getting better, we have X servers available for free to transfer to, please take advantage of these if you can"
---
34 here, and I was one of the youngest in my guild during Vanilla-WotLK. Some of us are coming back for Classic.
---
&gt; It's still a choice of preference is all I wanna say.
---
Not really. Night Elf is objectively the worst race.
---
How do you plan to balance classic gaming and your new Jr. High workload, sport?
---
I give 5/7 to this troll.
---
Well in Europe prostitution and strip clubs are legal and thriving
---
I do have the wow cook book.
---
RP doesn't have to mean developing an in depth background for your character. At a minimum all you really need is a lore friendly name(don't be a nelf rogue name xXxSephirothxXx) and to keep /s and /y as "in character." There will be plenty of raiding.
---
This is awesome. Now let's see one for priests!
---
&gt; A people realize how hard classic is and they leave en mass
---
That will be an interesting thing to see the pop numbers after launch.  Seeing that the game is technically free with a WoW sub.
---
I inquired to by buddy on his gameplan for playing (he's been in since the end of WotLK, me since Beta).  And he plainly stated "I'm planning on playing when I'm bored",  so no mad-dash to 60, which I was actually relieved about.  I plan on having a good time playing through this game again and hopefully do some endgame content I never really experienced (I really got into end-game stuff with FFXIV which then translated back into WoW when I returned to the game).
---
But it should be interesting to see what people's opinion of the game after a week or so, see how people will like/dislike the anti-QoL stuff that they had to implement.
---
&lt;High Command&gt; {Fairbanks Alliance} {Semi-Hardcore} {Loot Council} What are our goals?
---
We will be a fun but serious guild working to clear content in a fast and effective manner. We intend to be a top guild and compete for world bosses and fastest raid clear times. We will be an active part of shaping the classic community on our server. The infrastructure is in place for that to happen, but we are still looking for good players to fill the final positions. At the start there will be competition for raid spots which will transition into performance expectations. Raid times will be Saturday and Sunday from Noon PST - 4 pm PST. Generally we will form alt-raids, pvp, and smaller raids outside of our main raid times. We will be active in pvp, but members are not obligated to participate. World pvp and gank squads will be encouraged. We plan to start premades when the first BG’s are released. You can choose to join the guild in a pvp-only capacity.
---
What is our experience?
---
We have a strong core of knowledgeable and skilled officers to allow the guild and raids to run smoothly. Our officers have experience with all vanilla content, and our raid leader has previously lead a guild to success in Naxx, downing Kel’Thuzad before TBC was released. We have multiple highly skilled players who have recently cleared Naxx.
---
Feel free to contact me (Lawlnonymous#6058) if you have any further questions.

Awesome, thanks.

This ain't no gnome but a bronze dragon though
---
awwwwwwww can't wait anymore
---
Well he has a point really....
---
It will be 1am when it launched for me. I’ll be logging in, get my alt names set and go to sleep. Wake up early and play.
---
The solution is to open more servers because new ones will fill up to :P
---
I feel like the Barrow Dens should have a map of it. I played through it over 20 times but I still get lost.
---
Nothing like it!

\&gt;Full is just the largest measurement they have.

Not great, not terrible

no only equipped gear.

Jack &amp; Coke and some pretzels,  peanuts,  popcorn

both still at medium
---
I'd think over 75% will resub over the weekend/launch day, or at least have a subscription but no characters made
---
Ya, about things that matter, but hairstyles on characters that we won’t see? (Especially after character creation?) You’re focusing on the small stuff.
---
A perma guild mom here. Started in 2005 because my then 10 year old son wanted to play and we all played as a family so I could keep an eye on him. My partner and I stuck with it, the kid lost interest. My other half has played consistently until now but I gave up after Cata.  I've picked up the expansions and played a bit, but it just doesn't hold my attention like it used to.  
---
I'm making everyone around me nuts because I'm bouncing off the walls waiting for this to kick off :)  If you had told me that at 54 I would be jumping back in to WoW, I would have laughed.
---
Yep, Legion despite bringing random legendaries (lol) and some other bullshit was by far the best expansion in a good while. It truly felt like an RPG again. At least for me!
---
4 hour ques haha
---
Gonna make me a charcuterie board. Also some veggies and hummus. Nice easy non messy finger foods.
---
^this
---
I could see that. Some of the green shades look a little fruity (literally). I kinda like the dark brown-green one, looks more realistic. 
---
If you want to be unique I'd go that pale yellow. I don't recall ever seeing someone with it, probably because it's ugly.
---
*bingo*
---
You are right, mage is a safe bet because they are both strong in PvP and PvE. But they are glass cannons, so be prepared for relying on control and evasion to do well in PvP. You also are limited to only doing DPS though they do it very well.
---
Druids are much more versatile allowing you to play how you want to outside of raids. But they are the jack of all trades master of none. In PvP you will be constantly switching in out forms while juggling mana and multiple toolbars. You will be challenged more to do less damage than mage. In raids you will almost certainly be asked to heal, not DPS \*and\* heal.
---
Throw them in a cup and consume that way.
---
The harder the battle, the sweeter the victory. 
---
The time will pass faster and it will feel more satisfying when the week is over and you know you're free to do absolutely nothing but play Classic WoW.

And regular evening meal, veggies Some lean meat or fish.

Man i know there are other cheat sheets for classes but do I wish the popular warlock sheet thats been going around the sub would get reformatted to this layout. Dope af.
---
Hey now, there were other Alliance guilds on Agamaggan-EU that could lay claim to the title of #1 in progression.
---
Granted, it was only after Zero Tolerance and Freak Circus migrated away, but there were!
---
Took a week off. Said I needed to finish up some housework on the place I bought this past December. Depending on how the servers go, it might actually turn out to be true.
---
It’s later
---
The files are too big! D:
---
Where was the personal attack Mr.senseitive? Then you get all defensive lol. The streamer server is perfect for an edgy kid like you lol.
---
Praying to God that Blizzard have enough hardware in place for launch.
---
They are completely clueless of what is coming.
---
The name reservations are a mere fraction of launch numbers.
---
193k and climbing still!
---
If you're on it, you never die...but you don't kill things fast.  And going spriest is cool and all, buuuuuut, you aren't a healer anymore so either you're swapping specs when trying to dungeon or your considered a DPS&gt;
---
Rogues are going to out dps wars pre-BiS and probably pre-AQ40 for that matter
---
Maybe with Darkshore snuck in for a few levels
---
They sure know their audience. Public transit ads are like fishing for no-lifers with an Aquadynamic Fish Attractor.
---
had to circle back to this post :D
---
Because Herod is still going to have a lot more people than Stalagg
---
Wait. Does the names, and characters stated above that are "cloned" get duplicated on both servers? Cause people with 3 accounts right now cant make anymore without a subscription. Ive been talking with my guild, and we all rolled, and have our characters waiting. Since we don't plan on logging in until release day all of our characters will just be sitting in the "original" Herod server, and Id like to imagine this is the case for a lot of people. Youd have to give someone a BIG incentive on changing realms at this point. For me personally I wouldn't do it for anything less than $100, so good luck with this idea. I also personally want the huge queue with people everywhere on launch. Would definitely make it chaotic, and feel like a game release should imo.
---
&gt; Surely the technology exists to increase that number by 10 fold today.
---
It does not.
---
On new p servers I would buy like 10 shadowfangs for like 15g each and then resell them all a few months later for ~200g each. Keep your eye out.
---
No, but I did play with a mingmong lol
---
Saw one this morning near midtown station!
---
No way, frost mages can be difficult to kill depending on the class.
---
250k gogo
---
&gt; Don't know if you know, but it generates 1 rage every 3s
---
It doesn't, this isn't BC
---
Well, when I'm unemployed I'll have more time to level my little pally.
---
And then have 50 different servers all of which end up dead in a few months as the player base inevitably falls off. They're making the minimal number of servers for a reason.
---
You have way too much faith in this community, and humanity as a whole.
---
MMORPG isnt about shiny combat and polished content. It of course only can help to certain degree and WoW vanilla, despite how unique and awesome the game is, lack modern look. However, game success is always determined based on what the game offers and not how it looks. If it was like that, retail would prosper, but does it?
---
I think there're maybe 5-10% complete newbies who will play Classic for somewhat long time. Compare it to 100% in 2004 and the answer will be "quite unlikely".
---
Speaking as someone who has a healthy group of die hard retail fans that won't even look at classic (that were diehard classic fans) I'm not so sure assuming the masses are flocking to classic to "create a character for the sake of it" is a safe play.
---
One, I wouldnt call advanced tip.  You can "line of sight" pull ranged units.  Lots of dungeon runs end because of adds from patrols.  Many times, you get adds from the ranged mobs having a patrol run into them.
---
When you pull a group of mobs, pull them back to a safe place around a corner, that way, the ranged will run to the corner, they cant shoot you through a wall.
---
I don't see how anyone could possibly disagree.
---
Why would people who are uninterested in RPing go to an RP server? Why would people who RP want people who aren't interested in RP to come to their server...
---
It doesn't make sense.
---
I would posit 5% extra crit generates **far** more rage than 1 rage per 3s.
---
You are just a bowl of cherries, today, aren't you?
---
\\hug/
---
They do have the numbers, hence why the new realm. They'll review with it in place and then likely add another. 
---
They can't win. To few realms and folks will complain about queues. To many and the complaints shift to dead realms. They're trying to learn from the past and load balance as we ramp up to launch.
---
Just to be clear the lower number is when you can start fishing and the higher is when you’ll have a gaurantee
---
They had us in the first half, I'm not gunna lie.
---
So Central Time (read: Missouri, USA) will be the 26th?? Sorry if this is a Sunday question time zones are confusing
---
Alright, I laughed. That was pretty good.
---
I mean, aren't we arms because of MS and pvp capabilities while leveling?
---
You’re probably really fun around your friends huh
---
Fairbanks is a ~~dead~~ dad server
---
Hey great catch. We are on Herod!
---
You have to be able to do it, otherwise you’d be stuck after a wipe.
---
If you want to stand out and be rare go for the bridfe of frankenstein one. literally never saw it
---
Well, until that option is faster than using your phone...
---
It does in vanilla.
---
I'd go talk to a professional if I were you. You seem extremely lonely. Good luck out there.

&gt;The leveling experience isn't something I loved in Vanilla
---
Yeah, there's only a few questlines I genuinely enjoyed (Tirion Fordring's in particular) but there's a handful of those in every expansion.  In general the questing in vanilla was incredibly bland and simple and I certainly didn't enjoy playing messenger boy across several zones just to get to the real meat of the quests.
---
Join us On Bloodsail Buccaneers, Alliance will more than likely be the predominant faction, and there's tons of us planning on raiding. Stay a while and listen.
---
Now I'm confused lol, we are BST in the UK now yes?
---
You could say he was bestowing blessings upon the raid.

Chu Crew | Horde - Pagle | Semi-Hardcore PvE/Pvp | 
---
&lt;Chu Crew&gt; is a guild situated on Pagle US East. Our group is aiming to be Semi-Hardcore raiding with casual players mixed in. We intend to do 2 nights of raiding a week on Tues/Thurs from 9-12PM EST.  We will be doing Loot Council based loot with the Guild Master, 4 officers from the categories of Tanks, Melee, Ranged, and Healers. There will be 3 additional loot council members per week drawn at random at the beginning of the weeks first raid. The majority of us are in our upper 20's to early 30's with some members being as old as 50+. If you are interested in being a part of our guild reach out to @Jimmichu, @Kyle , or @Howl
---
I had varying results with invis-pots on different private servers. The video you saw might have had faulty scripting so don’t count on it working the same way.
---
I soloed almost every dungeon on private servers, I expect some of them to be easier and some of them to be harder depending on the scripting.
---
In short I don’t think we can 100% sure how it will work before we try.
---
Shazzrah and Gehennas is where the vast majority will go. I mean the choice should be pretty simple if you don't want extreme queues, right?
---
Do you actually use rend while leveling 1-39 as fury?
---
Not trying to flame your guide or anything, but Amphy in all his wisdom and glory can hit 30 in 18 hours, why does your guide take 30? Do you honestly think Amphy is so good that he can do it 12 hours faster, or that perhaps your guide isn't as good as his route?
---
Enabling a gnome like it's 2005.
---
youre right, i just pushed it down for the picture, both the screens are on arms and i usually have them a little higher
---
It's probably an eBay find these days. I bought it around the time it came out.
---
5%crit is something like 5% more rage, right? Or quite close (I don't have the formula for rage, but if it scales linearly with damaged compared to level, it's 5% more rage.) So for it to be as good rage generation wise you'd need to generate something like 20 rage per 3 seconds with your auto attacks only. Far from the case during leveling.
---
Chopsticks my good man
---
I kind of did this for quite a bit, if you ran any one of these 2 or 3 times and move on, you are pretty well geared.
---
The game was played completely different all those years ago my friend. You’re comparing apples to oranges. Obviously this time around it will be very difficult to obtain high ranks at a reasonable rate if you’re not winning almost all your games, depending on how your battlegroup performs of course. That’s not to say that one bad player can’t be carried by 9-14 others. Have you ever seen old videos of rank 14 players? It is laughable by today’s “standards”
---
How many times in your life do you wish you did things differently and could go back in time with what you know now. This is our chance boys. Time to fuck it up again!
---
What I'm saying is in the context of WoW, immaturity and childishness is sometimes not as annoying as an adult that acts in an unpleasant way. It depends entirely on what is grating to you. 
---
It also has an effect on my personal morale. If a person under the age of 18 acts like a dipshit, I can at least take comfort in the fact that they can't vote yet, and may change before then. An adult that acts like a dipshit has the same voting rights as me, which makes me sad.
---
Not to mention, they are barely even advertising the game. They clearly expect it to be a failure.
---
Wait for the announcement of the name reservation ending.  Find out what neighborhood in LA the classic servers are in.  Book a flight and hotel.  Pay for a new Spectrum or AT&amp;T internet access at the hotel.  Then use the battle.net launcher to open wow classic and wait for your realm to become unlocked from the locked status.
---
Prayer of healing spam.
---
From the comments laid out above and in previous quotes, there are only two options.  Phase 1 extends until they see fit to release phase 2.  Or the other option being, they initiate phase 2 with the reduced cap regardless at the detriment of those who refused to listen and move on.
---
I expect it to be the second option, as Blizzard has gone out of their way to warn the population of the big servers.  They just view it as, you don't listen, your only damaging yourself.
---
there is one online with all the flight path lines, i got my graphics designer to remove the lines
---
To be fair this is some of the biggest news weve had all week
---
If you're not giving Blizzard money where is their incentive to provide you with a game? 
---
Grow the fuck up and stop expecting something for nothing!
---
Can’t wait to play arms and stance dance my way to victory!
---
Lens on snapchat and ad irl is great to see, now just TV style ads and we are gucchi Blizzard

They did it to help regulate the surge of incoming players

The DPS is the same.
---
Yes, burst will be higher but usually the cast interruption is more worth it.
---
What's with the key binds? That's like early day naga shit.
---
They said they wouldn't create new servers until Stalagg fills up. It does them no good to have multiple servers of the same type in the same timezone not full
---
Exactly....just need to use solid markers and explain priority targets and make a friend with a mage for those sweet sheep's!
---
Casting animation would be my guess
---
Idk of its a bug but i can create chars using the trial account linked to my retail account. So ya know 6 names reserved
---
Is that the alpha client that you can host locally?
---
Why does everyone think the majority of players like high pop servers? A good amount of players prefer tight knit community and slower paced progression of lower pop servers. 
---
Also, dead servers are coming regardless. Id rather have lower que times are launch and more “dead servers” than horrible que times at launch and fewer “dead servers”.
---
I dit not really make up an excuse i just told at my work i am going to a friends house for a week. Where i will be playing wow.

Condescending but I'll take it
---
A ton, and that's still a small percent of the total people that will I'm betting. Classic is going to be huge
---
stop....just stop.
---
I just think that the community spoke up and Blizzard listened to them.  They got the RP-PvP server they wanted.  Now, a bunch of people that couldn't give a shit about RP are joining it because of overflow from regular PvP servers.  That's just kind of messed up.
---
If you aren't going to abide by the special ruleset of a server for a niche group of players, just go play on another one of the 5 or 6 servers available.  I don't understand why other people can't understand the concept of having respect for a certain smaller group of players.
---
Not only this, but most adults already know what it feels like to be needing sleep. It's where we live.
---
I'm one of six friends that has already re subbed. My friends aren't worried about names. I'm sure there is a huge silent majority that feel the same and waiting for launch to sub... Blizzard is not prepared!!

3 day weekend for Labor Day, free vacation day. I took a 4 day weekend the following weekend in September.

ATLien representing
---
Where can I purchase a shirt with this on it ?
---
I cant find where I read it but I am pretty sure its only based on active accounts so regardless of how many names you reserved on a realm each account only counts as 1...and if you think about it, it wouldn't make sense for them to count each character into the algorithm as you can't multi login.
---
Lol alright there bud, someone shit in your cereal today?
---
should flair this for humor because this is a hilarious attempt to get alli an advantage in world pvp
---
At level 35, you hit for around 180 damage. Now Impale only applies to your YELLOW crits, which is Overpower (or HS, but using HS is meh/bad itself). So let's say you crit for 400 damage, which is 200% or 200. Impale makes it 220%, which is 440. Now, OP has 5% to proc, and you probably have around 10% crit, so it has 60% to crit. 
---
40 (bonus damage) * 0.6 (crit chance) * 0.05 (%dodge of mob) = 1.2 damage per swing. If you have a slow weapon, like Corpsemaker that is around 3.5 speed, that is 1.2 / 3.5 = 0.34 DPS for 2 talent points.
---
Worth it?
---
Zandalar Tribe. Because i can.
---
\&gt;  Honestly the pushback is overrated as fuck 
---
Yes, but you have the option of having a great pet for spellpushback, or not having one. It's not like you can trade Broken Tooth's attack speed for other kind of advantage.
---
So, why not just use him?
---
It is up again now. I wonder if the other servers will go down one-by-one now (for some kind of maintenance/restart).
---
Be kinda odd if only that server was down randomly.
---
Turns out I was a little off XD
---
Alchemy is very handy to have. Can make a lot of gold from it by buying mats and creating potions to sell on the AH. So don't have to think about it as a profession which requires herbalism necessarily. Also just convenient do be able to make your own pots for raids.
---
 I am rolling a hunter alt for alchemy specifically.
---
me not that kind of orc
---
okay, i will get the picture tomorrow and set it up for you
---
When we hit 200k subs I am sure we will do another poll that gets pinned. I bet we are there in 2 or 3 days
---
@Blizzard, new PvP servers when?
---
If they are full now with name reserves, they ganna get annihilated on launch day.
---
Ready Player One
---
I'll be trying fishing for the first time and I'm even aiming to try main professions I have never done. All I ever did from TBC to BFA was PVP. (Took month to year long breaks in between)
---
yea there's way too much single-player content in WOW these days.
---
Please share the image!  I do not like the flight paths either!
---
I remember playing in a guild where the GM was 40+ back in early TBC, he had many characters but his main was a Paladin, named "Fortified".. it was on Grim Batol EU, guild &lt;Fatal Error&gt;

---
you can print it any size you want, thats just the size of the old picture i had so i didnt want to put more screws in the wall
---
First thing: The talent tree is mostly quite optimized. Usually those fall apart entirely.
---
**But**. Imp Overpower is one of your best talents. You ***absolutely*** should consider getting 2/2 at 25. 2H spec is pretty overrated. Depending on your context Deflection and Imp Hamstring are better.
---
*Especially* Don't get Impale over Imp Overpower.
---
Your tree falls apart entirely at 51-60, though. The third tier of the fury tree is completely butchered. Imp BS is not *that* good. I can get not grabbing Blood Craze. But no Piercing Howl? Come on.
---
Yeah we do weird shit but to be honest the date thing makes more sense.
---
Think of it this way: US dates... you immediately read the month and get a general idea when the thing is taking place. Half the time I read just the first number and then think “December is 6 months away I’ll worry about it when it gets closer” it sets the context for the day. 
---
Meanwhile if the day is first you have to read something that gives you absolutely no context (okay, 27th day of.....???) before you get to the month. The day is completely irrelevant without knowing the month. However the month is still relevant without the day.
---
And the year should be last since it’s usually a pretty safe bet to assume it’s current year.
---
Wow needs less "strong" women.
---
Awesome news.  It's not something I'd push for yet as I just want to play through the six phases, but while I get the hype for TBC servers, it's still finite content, while Classic going its own path, with the right team working on it could last as long as retail has gone on for, if not longer.
---
Nice to know that they've thought about the future, at the very least.
---
Not getting improved charge is a BIG no, and you don't need 5 points into tactical mastery right away as you don't have zerker stance until 30.    
---
Also Impale is garbage.
---
I'm in a similar situation. I would highly recommend the vast majority enjoy their 1-60 adventure. Stop to smell the flowers, explore and have fun. 
---
Although for myself back in vanilla I had every class to 60 besides lock. This time around I forced myself to not  be an altaholic and focus more on end game. But I will still have 3 at max level and 1 at 35 simply for the professions.
---
Gl all
---
I too, am looking for a mage one.
---
Cheetos are very easy to eat with the tongue punch method.

If any pve guild mandated you honor grind for raiding they're probably trash. MC won't require any of this.

# [Horde-Whitemane]SpellCleave- Powerleveling No life Group on Launch. Need 1 more to join us.
---
LF1M 5 man dungeon spam on launch date.
---
Requirements: Must be very active at least first 6 days Tuesday-Monday (10-14 Hrs/day). Experienced in getting 1-12 starting zone cleared fast and meet the rest of the group in RFC at level 12. We will power grind dungeons and guide you through leveling in group, also help gear each other at 60  through dungeons and be ready for raids, before the majority of the server hits 60.
---
Group consists of Horde: Warr(Tank), Mage, Lock, priest(healer) and **X**. **X** is preferred as a mage and having past experience in wow and being good is expected.
---
About us:Most of us are 24-28\~ years old, with experience in multiple expansions of wow and Vanilla. Both with great accomplishments in PVE and PVP.  We are very chill and our discord has no rules. We don't try to be politically correct, nor do we pick on others or try to piss anyone off. We just try to be drama free and focus on gaming for fun. Banter, and memeing is allowed. Since everyone is an adult, I assume everyone has social skills to not bully or harass people they are playing with.
---
If you are interested. Message me your Discord tag, your past experience(link armory/wowprogress will do), and you must be committed for first week. We are not too picky, just prefer to play with a 5th that would be reliable and carry their own weight.
---
Again, I can't stress enough how low of an impact both talents have. But thick fur has the potential to save you from the one death blow while you're trying to finish off a HT cast. Feral instincts would've left you with a 2 minute walk back to your corpse.
---
&gt; more attack power means harder crits which means more deep wounds bleeds
---
That's not correct.  It just means the crits would hit harder, but not more often.  2-Hand spec doesn't have any interplay with deep wounds.
---
The more rage gen addition is true, but IMO offers vastly less utility than the option to spam Hamstring to proc a snare while kiting or in a PvP scenario.
---
LETS GO BABY. Blizzard bring on at minimum one or two more PVP servers and we're good for launch!
---
I wonder how many people are going to miss launch day because they think it launches on the 27th in the states.
---
Epic Mount is one of the lowest priorities for me too.  It's going to come as an inconsequential part of just farming.  
---
Personally, I plan on making a guild while leveling up, running dungeons with those people, and teaming up with a miner to go around in high level zones PvPing while I farm herbs and they farm ore.
---
&gt; I deleted my first character at level 40 because I didn't like his hair.

**&lt;Space Force&gt; | Alliance | US East | Herod | Semi-Hardcore**
---
Space Force is a group of like-minded players who have played together on and off for the past 8 years through many iterations of World of Warcraft end game content. The focus of the guild is progression PvE content but also take part in the other parts of Classic by being a part of the greater Herod, US - East community.
---
We believe in a “less is more” mentality when it comes to our time commitment to raiding. We value the time we can put into World of Warcraft, so we expect our core team to come prepared to raid. We will also be planning activities outside of raids, such as dungeon runs, battleground groups, and world PvP.
---
**Guild Focus: Progression PvE**
---
**Raid Times:** Wed/Th 8:30 EST - 11:30 EST
---
**Loot System:** Loot council weighted on attendance, gear distribution, and contributions in the guild
---
**While all players are welcome, we have needs for the following classes/roles:**
---
Druid: High
---
Warrior DPS: High
---
Warrior Tank: Medium
---
Rogue: Medium 
---

The warlock detect invisibilty isn't for stealth anyway as I recall.
---
Humans do seem to look better generally though.
---
viability is always a strange argument, since the early raids are easy anyways. as i said i dont mind hybrids because im gonna go holy paladin, one thing that gives hybrids bad rep is that people dont put in enough effort and are just bad with them, its a noob trap.
---
theyre usually higher, they are on extendable arms, but for the picture i lowered them so you wouldnt see a couple of wires from keyboard and mouse
---
Ah.. the betrayer
---
I figured the only  way to combat my indecisiveness is to create all the classes I wanna play. Get them all to level 10 or so and then decide which I enjoyed the most. 
---
Right now were looking at UD Lock, Orc Shamy, Human Pally and NE Huntard...
---
dont know much about them but we had a feral offtank on lights hope, from mc till naxx, and i can say atleast that its atleast good enough to get a spot.
---
Around 30 too. Can’t wait to start feeling on the younger end again; Reddit has a way of making you feel old far before your time :P.
---
That might be, but after we migrated to Bladefist I lost track of agamaggan. ZT migrated before us tho, and claimed #1 spot until they did.
---
if you haven't seen it. its worth the watch.
---
The point for rushing tactical mastery is to get anger management quickly. Though imp charge will help you to start killing crap quicker.

How sub-optimal is it for me to take Cruelty after Deep Wounds? My reasoning is that the crit chance will help out in dungeons when tanking more than 2h specialization will help overall. Just curious if any deep divers have any feedback on that choice.
---
"Dwarf Priest is a very good race/class combination because of Fear Ward."
---
Because the next question out of someone's mouth is, "Is that good for PvP or PvE?"
---
I think his point is that his claim of first pvp kill was made at the time and undisputed at the time, and multiple other beta testers confirmed it.
---
For everyone that doesn't want to queue, do what I do and set up Chrome Remote Desktop.  It's worked flawlessly for me for years.  When you're getting ready to leave work, pull out your phone and remote into your home computer, click the play button on the launcher, and the game will open up, log you in, and put you in queue for your server.
---
Never said add 50 did I? But as each one gets to full they need to add atleast 1 more of each type that fills up.
---
Of course some realms will be 'dead' it's the number of these that they're trying to reduce. Most people don't want to be on them, based on player input. Those that do, can stay and be happy.
---
You must have actively avoided all information about Classic if you don't know the answer to this question. Amazing.
---
Ita really helpful in pvp though, reducing distance your eyes need to travel even a little but helps in the long run.
---
"I have the Thresher eyes, where the hell is the buzzbox? God DAMMIT that Gnome gives TERRIBLE DIRECTIONS!"
---
No.  This is a company that has proven time and again over the last 10 years that it can't be trusted.
---
But she comes out of the TV after all the days are over
---
So if I say that I got the kill 30 min before you and I have a couple of guys who can “confirm” it, is it true? 
---
But if we play with the thought that you are right, how long did it take for you to get to level 11? 
---
Do you honestly think that there was not a single horde and alliance who could have met somewhere before that?
---
The hype is too strong...  the hype is TOO F*** STRONGGGGASHHHHHH I WANT IT NOW
---
Ridiculous right? We should go back to our roots like WC3 where the factions...oh shit did they team up to defeat the legion? Ok well we should go back to our roots when in vanilla the factions...ah damnit they worked together to open the gates of AQ...oh well, let's keep mis-remembering the past so we can shit on retail instead of enjoying both things, since it's impossible to like two different versions of the same thing for different reasons.
---
This is me. I think levelling is boring because it doesn't require much teamwork or interaction like dungeons/raids. 
---
Besides, lets say Classic lasts AT LEAST 2 years. I'm going to be spending the VAST MAJORITY of the time at level 60 than I am levelling.
---
I mean 1 day or 100 days it really wont matter to me lol. ;-;
---
God forbid blizzard takes another $4 from me, after the thousands I’ve spent up to this point.
---
Classic 1-60 feels like a really complete experience. Taken in isolation its a brilliant difficulty curve from Northridge Abbey to Kel Thu'zad. 
---
However, in 2019, that same game holds up great for 1-60. Yet, it trails off at the end. The final dungeons and every raid up till Twin Emps is too easy. 
---
A smidge more health, a rework of the armor reducing debuffs, and (controversially) an additional mechanic is whats needed in most cases to make a compelling game for a 2019 audience.
---
Im gonna play the hell out of classic, and I think classic is a much better game than modern wow. But if elements, like the gradual difficulty scale and everything else we like about classic was recreated with a more compelling dungeon/raid experience--I think Blizzard would have a real case for having struck lightning twice. 
---
Virtually the only improvements to world of warcraft alive in the 2019 version of the game as compared to the 2004-06 is dungeon boss and raid boss fights (id argue the old dungeon layouts were superior, even). Old wow--hell--even old class combat mechanics, with new wow boss fights would seriously challenge me to stay employed.
---
Oh, so its a song? Im not familiar with it. Thanks for the reply tho!
---
Gehennas probably. I'm a Swede and I'm just following the herd.
---
Should also make a key to make it obvious what everything is.
---
That was me.
---
I was around \~12 when playing WoW.
---
I raided MC, ZG, and BWL with my guild.
---
I played a Holy Paladin. I was not aware of what a guide was. I somehow figured out the right way to spec for healing. I only used plate armor and max spell levels, so you can imagine how well I did.
---
I am in the old age group described by you, and we are in REDDIT.
---
Lol one of our paladins was really wasted and mistook a hunter for a priest, DI when we wiped.  
---
Laughter ensures.  The equally drunk hunter started complaining about being stuck.  
---
Drunk runs was awesome.
---
I would recommend against 2 gathering professions, you can only track 1 at a time on the mini map
---
I'm sure the technology is there. Just not sure if Blizzard uses it or if it's too difficult to integrate it into an older system and for it to be used on older PC's. But I'm not a network engineer or anything. But, if a private server can pull off 15k not sure how Blizzard couldn't hit 30k
---
I miss the agamaggan community stipe &amp; jedik if youre out there come waste time with me in classic
---
Be sure to give us an update! We wanna know how aoe grinding on a mage at level 12 works out.
---
You all look like you voted for Trump.
---
In a casual setting, you'll be fine. In a progression setting, you won't be looked at unless you're prot.
---
Freeloaders*
---
There were leveling guides and ui addons in vanilla. Also, leveling is such a small portion of the game for some people. More experienced players will tell you that the games STARTS at lvl 60. As well as most of your time played would be at lvl 60. so following a guide/addon to get to 60 should not be condoned or belittled. especially to those who didnt get to experience it back in vanilla.
---
I literally only made this post to have a good discussion, I'm playing undead as i've said before
---
ATLiens is a sick group, saw them with bassnectar
---
I expect there to be issues for a couple hours or maybe off and on for a few hours if we go along with other blizz releases. I scheduled tuesday/wednesday off just in case of things like this.
---
Thank you so much!
---
It's not as if there's a ton of options. On EU you can pick between two full realms and a high pop realm if you want a PVP server.
---
dont worry to explain it, im in the same boat as you. Those who have never played on rppvp servers wont know :) 
---
The more people who cant see why, the better for the realm overall. Otherwise the realm is full of spergs and no different than a normal pvp server.
---
I’m not so sure of that. The majority of servers in WoW I’ve always been “dead servers” and people always played on them. It’s not a classic experience for every server to be packed.
---
For leveling it doesn't matter lmao.
---
Get some on Amazon.
---
one of two is skinning.
---
theres many many many people subbin only 25/26 and then creating their chars... things gonna go crazy!
---
most of it is accurate and helpful, i quess you were downvoted because you make it sound that its not accurate at all.
---
Checking multiple discords / census survey looks to be very even. Like 49% / 51% or 52% / 48%. Seen stats to show A majority and H majority. Bodes well for balance.
---
It increases your awareness. It's good to be able to tell how much health everything around you has rather than needing to target each thing individually. There are mods you can install to change the way nameplates look.
---
I will be funneling tailoring mats to an alt while I farm the shit out of humanoid mobs.
---
It is the only way to stop myself getting price gouged by other players and NPCs.
---
!remindMe 8 days "Gore"
---
What is this post even about? Are you saying Classic is undertuned? Are you saying Vanilla was easy? Like, I don't understand the post

I love this.
---
There will be people with 250 tailoring before you get 10 gold, I promise you.
---
Skinning plus x doe
---
I thought this at first, but after hearing that the few big pservers will be willingly shutting down come launch, I don't anymore. 
---
The only pservers left after launch will be the smaller ones, whom I highly doubt have the resources to successfully attack Acti/Blizz (at least in any impactful way).
---
goosebumps watching this, welcome home brothers and sisters, welcome home.
---
Wouldn’t you just use intimidating shout instead of piercing howl? Seems kind of redundant but I’m no expert by any means.
---
I stand corrected then, good luck!
---
Skinning and another gathering would work though.
---
After some thought, that is the option I will most likely choose. I don't want to miss any quests but I still want to be able to read the quest and figure out where to go.
---
44 here, playing vanilla servers since cata. Biding my time, plotting.
---
Whooo whoooooo, whoooo whooooooo
---
My opinion is that TBC and Wrath fans(or any fanbase large enough, hell wod come bring it) deserve their favorite expansion recreated just as much as we deserve classic, and it would be rude to ask for more classic content when their game hasn't been remade.
---
But that's just my opinion, I do like new stuff too.
---
Well it depends what your gathering professions are herbalist and mining both have specialty bags you can buy you’ll also need a quiver so your gonna be a bit low on storage.
---
1 Quiver / Ammo Pouch for attack speed. 
---
I will buy 6 slots from vendors but just hope to get better bags as drops. Or find a tailor later.
---
No, for the UK, 11pm (23:00) on 26th = 22:00 GMT
---
Not if outplaying the other players though
---
Yes an I would like them to try and inform the community better than they did with stalagg specifically, what don't you get to me just refering to stalagg?
---
I'm not going to abandon sleep. Heck, I planned out exactly when to wake up so I can take care of personal hygiene before starting to play. Have meal-shakes so I can drink those while playing for proper nutrition (going for Queal). And after 15 hours of play calculated an hour of "winding down" before sleeping.
---
For me, frequency is important here. I am okay with resets every few years. It's the reset every patch that's the problem.
---
While you certainly want to get your hands on the biggest bags available as soon as is reasonable, I think more important than that is simply diligent inventory management.  Never ever **ever** pass up an opportunity to vendor your junk and/or mail BoEs or gathered items you want to keep off to a bank alt.
---
There are such a variety of monsters... ultra violet is my fav
---
A good point, and I considered it but it would also inflate the classes, and I also was genuinely curious how many people will be playing multiple classes at launch, so grouping them together made it easier to see that.
---
White Monster is best Monster.
---
Amazon
---
&gt;Going somewhere nice?
---
Just visiting family n friends.
---
Idk why people always feel compelled to answer truthfully to questions unless they truly don't mind.
---
It was not.
---
same here, things gonna go crazy.
---
so your his hype man also... jesus classic reddit is a shit show
---
20% reduced threat for the group beats 3% crit so if the option is between no shaman in the group and no moonkin in the group, the answer is obvious.
---
That said Moonkin is perfectly viable, and if the raid has a feral druid that's an Innervate for the Moonkin meaning OOMing isn't as much of an issue and Moonkin DPS without mans issues is very respectable.
---
Why do you think it's impossible to avoid dying servers...  nonsense.
---
I was in college when the game first launched. Now on the new launch I'm almost 36 but still excited to jump back in. Most of my guild are old friends in our mid 30s. Glad to see we are not alone.
---
That's why I said "arguably a healthy server"
---
CAN CONFIRM 37 Years old dad of 2 started playing at 22.
---
Yeah, exactly. I forgot to mention this.
---
777 forsenPls
---
Here's a link if you are interested in hearing it: https://youtu.be/jwutPrR-9YM
---
Lol reading your responses is mid workday entertainment, you actually sound like the 12 year old
---
I’m guessing people will play 50% less after three days, but not that half of the players will quit.
---
But green monster is the CLASSIC monster 
---
Hehe
---
Daggers really don't work while leveling.
---
yes, your week of play time will give you a better experience for weeks 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51 and you see where I am going?  
---
If you and everyone like you that visits wow subs, watches wow youtubes, listens to wow podcasts, and is 100% invested in the long term health of the game, you need to put your $4 in to the game before release and say, "I am here and going to spend months playing this game in the future.  I am not going to play 4 hours then go back to Trying to down Heroic Queen Azshara.  I am going to start bank alts and alchemy alts to earn gold for my main."
---
Because with out this, you are going to be left with 60 minute plus queues for anytime you want to play after dinner.  Or the alternative too many servers opened from the front load of players, that you cannot find a group to complete content with for the phases 3-6 after popularity, streamers, and launch hype dies off.
---
Ok sotp dots
---
Yes! That's the logo! Thank you so much, I'm def buying that shirt if I can't get another hoodie again.
---
I got mine from hot topic actually!
---
why the fuck was it banned?
---
Ah the 4chan crowd has arrived.
---
and I am if nothing else a decision making tactician.
---
Oh absolutely color plays a big part in what's 'good', but there's still some white-green items that can sell a lot. I'm just remembering blunder years where I equiped Shadowfang without even thinking about it, buying random greens on AH and stuff like that. it's a good thing I didn't know I should've been crying in idiocy
---
Why do people want to gank?  It's not fun.  I'd rather be fighting other lvl 60s or running dungeons.
---
That's a good point too. Although I think we would see the same character building from doing something like classic+ too.
---
This one here. Probably hard for today's internet users to comprehend, but older generations tend to use social media and places like reddit less. Hell, back when I played WoW, I got more interesting inside info off user and guild websites/blogs in places like angelfire and geocities (I also want to say tripod maybe?). 
---
Thotbot actually took some time for a lot of the "good" info to be added. Allakhazam used to be a good source too, since thats where a lot of FFXI people who also played WoW were sharing info. Yahoo answers as well.
---
&gt;he kept morale high
---
That isn't useless.
---
MVP
---
Me too, had no idea it was only yellow attacks and not white as well!
---
I just pointed snapchat at the picture OP posted and clicked and held on the snapcode in the snap and it asked if I wanted to add the filter. After that you select the filter it adds (has a pic of rag on it) and then point it at the picture again.
---
If you lose your job, you'll hit 60 sooner
---
Leveling is 120-250 hours. A significant amount of time, but not all that much if you are committing yourself to playing for the next two years. 
---
Further, there may be a faster answer for leveling, but there is hardly an objectively wrong decision. Some people see dogmatic min/maxing as objectively the right answer, given how much we know about theorycrafting in classic, a lot of that type of person wants to arm himself with all of the "correct" answers before going into the whole thing. 
---
Finally, I dont know about you, but half the fun of leveling is fantasizing about all the dank gear youll have at 60, theorycrafting it keeps me driven to go out and get it.
---
Tip #1. Do not charge.... Ever.... 
---
\#2 save bloodrage for after combat so you can carry over rage into the next, because no charge == no initial rage.
---
Big upvote. 
---
Blood craze ends up being a great amount of hp/5 especially if you're grinding and in combat a lot (thus limiting spirit-based regen).  
---
Between blood craze, hp/5 consumes (alch potion and cooking food both very cheap and relatively available) you can have a ton of passive HP regen which helps save bandages and keep you going more often.  Sitting to eat food hurts, as you lose rage and the rate of regain is much slower than bandages. 
---
Not that you're going to be eating hp/5 consumes all the time, but once you get into the 50s it's entirely possible (Thanks Joe Rogan) to have very efficient grinding sessions.
---
&gt;Also your heal is like 2 full seconds slower than the other two healers..
---
Nah.
---
That's the issue in raids, because Rejuvenation had limited usefulness (people are topped up immediately.)
---
In groups you slap Rejuv on people who take damage, and you use downranked (faster) HTs to supplement as needed.   
---
Anyway it is *not* 2 full seconds slower. It's half a second.   
---
You can't compare Healing Touch to the fast heals.   
---
Healing Touch = Greater Heal/Healing Wave.    
---
Regrowth = Lesser Heal/Lesser Healing Wave
---
Additionally, in 5-mans Tranquility is great when three or more are injured. The HPMmana is okay for just two injured, three or more and you have crazy HPM.   
---
Often the right approach to a fight is to downrank Tranq by one beneath your most recent. Obviously with a Rejuv on the tank so you don't find yourself having to break Tranq.
---
Same here
---
This is one the best guides ive ever seen, its so easy to read and so fluid.
---
Really nice.
---
Damn id forgotten how big of a FU Nijel's Point flight path is.
---
Yaya ATL checking it!
---
I believe you ment to say "roll another alt"
---
people work in cartography still?!
---
These are pretty cool, thanks guy
---
If yours is shitty mine has to be something awful and I just cant have that.
---
Yeah you're right there is clearly no pleasing some people...or perhaps they expected blizzard to actually exercise some common sense with the launch?  The beta alone had the highest twitch viewer count period, which obviously showed a tremendous interest in the game.
---
Then we fast forward to the server listing release.  3 eastern servers lol....... Who would have guessed this would be a problem.  It's not like blizzard knew the streamers would entirely pollute one server to the point that it would be avoided.  I'm sure they also didn't know that a bunch of brazilians n such would want to play and having a dedicated server to their location might be a good idea.......  I am also sure blizzard knew everyone trying to avoid these two groups wouldn't all just pile into Herod.
---
So they gave everyone one choice if you didn't want to deal with trade chat spammed with other languages/streamers acting like total idiots constantly.  Then once everyone was forced onto Herod their solution was to spring a new server on people with only hours head notice.  The people with names didn't want to risk losing them on Herod to try to move to a new server and with such little warning attempting to get your name wasn't a feasible option.  Then you consider the fact that many friend groups decided on Herod since it was the only option.   Then you can consider the fact blizzard already essentially charged people money to reserve those names if you werent an active sub player prior to the name reservation day. 
---
This should not be happening for a huge company like blizzard.  They have screwed up so many game/expansion launches at this point it's unreal.  They should clearly know better by now.  As for you idiots saying OMGG you asked for classic experience.  Yes people want the classic community experience, they don't want login ques because these bone heads can't share any information to say they will be adding more servers down the road to avoid the problem herod now has.
---
Is this true? I always thought that rested zp you get anywhere but you accrue it faster in an inn or capital city.
---
Oh you're going to get it.
---
Yeah, I noticed that chat, and yeah, ZX is back for classic, should be a good time.
---
This is me. Quit shortly after the cata release. Resubbed just for the name reservation, last week.
---
Like I wanna see the guy who plans to shit and piss him self all hours of the day and night on stream and have bets on when he’s relieving himself. Hahahahah
---
Possible, but not fun. If you plan on tanking regularly, I'd respec for it.
---
Don't tell me how to live my life.
---
Not all of EU.
---
I've spent way too much time in the dressing room in preparation for the name reservation :)
---
I haven't played in a long time, so sorry if noob question. How do you get up to 400 fishing if the skill only goes to 300. Fishing buffs?
---
60-100g? Do you mean for the level 40 mount? You can easily get that money by simply looting and selling grey trash from mobs as you level. Just save your money... don't buy anything at all unless you really need it. Especially class skills.
---
Ohh I see what you mean that’s a good point, yeah at this point it’s going to be hard to tell before launch what population is going to look like...
---
I also came from FFXI, and yeah, being able to solo to the level cap was insane. Not to mention not de-leveling when you die...
---
Only one rank of:
---
Expose armor
---
Kick
---
Gouge
---
Maybe rupture (I still like it for high armor mobs eg. Shimmering flats turtles)
---
Ambush
---
Backstab
---
Combat - rush imp SS, imp gouge, parry talent, riposte. Get 2/2 remorseless attacks in assassination. Back to combat up to adrenaline rush. Swords are easily best for both factions although good maces are fine up till 40ish when you get SM+RFD swords.
---
Plan your weapon progression a bit. A good rule of thumb is the bottom damage of your mainhand weapon should be greater or equal to your level.
---
Sorry no infographic but I can't even draw stick figures
---
That’s the point of layering, correct? We should all be able to log in, and they’ll just spin up a different layer for every thousand people or something?
---
I played while deployed in Iraq in 07/08, I had a 16 month deployment with a lot of downtime since we only did hits at night. So I'd play all day after getting 6 hours of sleep, my wife was in the guild. I was the worst/funniest guy for our guild one time and one time only, we were raiding, We were running Kara for the 80th time, and wife and I were talking, then suddenly we had a few incoming mortar and RPG rounds into the base. I yelled "Oh shit" because they landed close, and the entire raid just stopped, wiped, and I D/C'd cuz they hit our commo area. It took about 14 hours to be able to get word to my wife that I was okay, BOY was she pissed. I forever became a joke of the guild "Hey remember that time LevelZer0 almost wiped IRL and wiped our raid?"
---
5 core hound packs??? thats probably the worst line you couldve thought of 😂
---
I think everyone knows all these servers are going to fill up and have huge queues by day 1
---
Those were the expansions where there was mostly agreement on the game being in a good state.  The problem is at the end of Wrath came some things that made the game easier but hurt the game in the long run (dungeon finder/dual spec).
---
Looks great but the dungeon in Desilace, is that Maradon?  It should be further south iirc
---
I'm in.
---
Who are you people playing this game with no friends/family/guilds?  I can't just up and say 'switch' and expect everyone to follow at the snap of my fingers.
---
I'm going to meal prep on Sunday and in general stock on supplies like hygiene products and coffee and just random things that decide to run out at the worst time. I have to go to work on Monday but will be leaving early around 3-4. And then taking the day off on Tuesday so I can pull an all nighter on launch. A friend of ours is going to lan with us so it'll be a hoot.
---
In that case you were a dum-dum.
---
Yes please. I want to man shaman and I dont want to heal. I will happily take TuskNorris, the tank shaman into raids. :D
---
I would also be up for them giving us class concepts that maybe got scrapped for retail because they were "too complex" or couldn't fit the new stat system. New classes or specs wont hurt the game as long as we dont change the core mechanics and the environment we are all here for.
---
Oh, I meant the time saving in regards to Classic's servers and queues. 
---
Takes me about ten minutes. That should be a bloody crime in the UK...
---
Still looking for a guild.
---
I'm a 38 year old father. Looking to raid Tues/Thurs due to other gym committments. I am Central time. Wanting to raid as holy pally with tanking offspec.
---
This is what excites me. I miss the feeling people looking at people and saying wow they are good. Then people doing it to me. Retail wow is more, congrats on farming something 3 expansions previous there's no sense of accomplishment anymore.
---
Looks like you forgot the server
---
Bruh at least holler at your mom to come give you a poop tray so your room don’t smell like shit.
---
It is an absolutely fantastic talent, but you have to sacrifice 3-4 talent points to get it. And at that point, it starts to be a little debatable, since there are better talents around **IMO** (like Imp charge, but mainly Imp OP).
---
Mostly agree except for Sanctity Aura.
---
At level ~46 for example, you're going to be doing like 40 holy DPS (seal and judge)
---
So sanctity aura is 4 DPS increase.
---
With a 2 sec mob attack, improved Ret aura is 12 DPS.
---
Ret aura &gt; sanc aura for leveling.
---
Ha...  seriously.  Your bathroom is probably ten to twenty feet away max.  I don’t understand this at all.
---
Apparently 1.12 had a dynamic respawn system, they talked about it recently during the final stress test because it wasn't working correctly. But they fixed it and it's now working. I don't think they mentioned if gatherable stuff will be affected by it, but my guess is yes considering mobs is not the only thing that will be extremely scarce during the first few weeks.
---
Fun read, thanks for sharing!
---
Can I do this but start at level 13 and rerun instances / use quests? Because that's pretty much what I'll be doing to level with friends lol
---
First world problems my man! Enjoy every minute and every dollar =]
---
Is Herod a different kind of full than the other PVP  servers because it seems like the only full server with high queue time threats from blizzard.
---
I've done mythic 7s in 300ms as a rogue, also played in 300ms all the time during vanilla due to no aussie servers, I reckon you will be fine
---
Why are people just staring at servers, you guys are weird
---
How about we don’t blow out of proportion a minority of the player base? 1% of people might do that.
---
"he could run in so he sent his pet" lol
---
Are you a dawg?
---
dont trust reddit surveys, i bet most of the returning older players dont use reddit.
---
I agree but what's your point
---
RemindMe! 4 days
---
It won't official WotLK, but it will better currently WoW, I sure.
---
&gt;Just wait until people who didn’t care about names resub.
---
the ones that are forced to hit the "random name" button.
---
It's gonna be tough - you'll see a lot of players taking skinning and herbalism to simply vendor off their materials to make a little extra money.  Players won't be in the market for crafting materials for a while so the auction house isn't a great place to make money for the first few weeks.
---
My mom can't move me on her own. Getting enough people to lift me up to get the tray under me costs way too much leveling time.
---
I shall join you, i also needed an excuse for full wizard
---
It depends on what you want to do. I've been practicing on retail and it's going quite well. I use an app called isboxer which is about 5 bucks a month and helps a lot. You could also use a key cloner if you want something simpler.
---
And get these addons from twitch:
---
- EMA (adds a lot of functionality to multi boxing)
---
- Gnome Sequencer (creates macros so you can play the other character with one button.)
---
Let me know if you have any more questions.
---
I’m in Seattle but rolling Alliance.  Gnome Mage, Gnome Rogue and Night Elf Priest.  😬

&gt; But, if a private server can pull off 15k not sure how Blizzard couldn't hit 30k
---
Do you understand what quadratic scaling is?
---
Also interested
---
If you're in the US, launch is mid/late afternoon anyway. Hardly worth taking a day off.
---
Your teen is showing brah. Perfect fit for streamer server.
---
The jury is still out but this was more popular on pservers due to sit-crits proccing enrage and bloodcraze (does not function in classic).
---
Tactical mastery and anger management are really good, and arms just keeps getting better from there.
---
Do what you want! Bring bandages and a good weapon and you'll excel
---
HEROD, THE PEOPLES REALM.
---
YOUR DIRTY PROPAGANDA WILL NOT TAKE AWAY FROM THE GIANT MEGA-SERVER
---
Agilty was my preferred leveling stat as a warrior over anything else, all things being equal.  I leveled 2Hfury, horde side.  
---
Crit did SO MUCH, extra rage, extra damage, attack speed increase as well.  Crits really brought the whole spec together.  You got 5% in 1st tier of fury, and in certain Arms specs you can have +10% from talents depending on your weap specialization.  
---
Baseline 5% crit, +10% from talents, and then wearing a bunch of agil or even some +crit gear?  You can easily get to 20% crit while leveling, and at that rate you'll have Flurry up at least 50% of the time, dealing way more damage, generating way more rage, and killing much faster thus limiting the damage you take.
---
I need a map for the BRD map
---
Yess, been waiting on a rogue one. Plus, I’ll be rolling undead too. 
---
There’s a quest for Ravenholdt at 24 too, and some more pertaining to that faction later. (Understandable to keep them out if you’re focusing on early levels)
---
Well, it was a bunch of 60s back in the day that were asking for the QoL changes that ended up coming about, so idk that kind of gatekeeping is even gonna help, tbh.
---
Actually finishing Stratholme
---
People used to bitch about BRD, but strat was the real group killer. The first time around, it was the only piece of T0 i didn't get before T1.
---
Man that just sounds frustrating and not fun.
---
Ever heard of vanilla private servers? Almost 10 years of people playing on them, myself included
---
You won’t be clearing both those raids at the start of the game in 4 hours...
---
But they didn't solve the deeper problem that the game doesnt have a cohesive leveling experience. It just feels like something to rush through to reach the real game.
---
It's especially odd going through 4 war chiefs over a few hours, with little explanation for the change
---
At least half the people I know aren't subbed yet to reserve a name.  Going to be interesting to see what happens.
---
Same thing with Demo shout.  Higher ranks deal higher amounts of AOE threat and limit a lot of damage on you. Definitely worth the money if you're planning on tanking at all.  Solo play is not as relevant.
---
My Keto diet meal prep:

* Drink: Water and Coffee
---
Can you still reserve a name?
---
28 was the average in 2005-2006.
---
Today, I would go more toward 34-35 as medium age for Classic.
---
Jerk off
---
How about something like pristine xpacs? like releasing tbc wotlk etc without adding lfg, lfr and so on.
---
No one should be vendoring skins except maybe medium leather.  They can all be turned in to something that vendors better.  Even if you don’t want to have a leatherworking alt, you could sell them on the AH for a bit above vendor price.  Enough to make it worth the trouble. 
---
It should be the same for herbs, but I haven’t run the numbers on those yet.
---
I don't think there's been 1 decision by Blizzard that hasn't been shit on to death by this subreddit. No matter what they do, a group of people will have issue with it and be vocal. At this point I'm just going to ignore the naysayers. Way too much negative energy in here.
---
Monster Import is the superior one.
---
$20 blizz cards are the only ones I normally see. Other than best buy you can find them at game stop, Target, Walmart, and some grocery stores.
---
And if Blizzard doesn't create a new US East PvP server soon, players who have yet to subscribe may be too afraid to join a newly created server that pops up like in August 23, thinking it may not populate with enough players by the time Classic launches. 
---
Everyone knows there will be a huge drop off in players a few months after Classic launch, which is exactly why Blizzard plans to remove players in phase 2, so a server that today shows a medium population may be too empty in the future to be enjoyable.
---
Those videos are mostly based on pserver guesses at lock box drops.
---
No I didn't but I live in Canada and EB is still a thing here and I happen to have one about 5 blocks from my house. I bought a 60-day card from them just this past weekend.
---
Where this at? I got a aledge hammer and it gets dark at night.
---
Play on my phone.
---
smh, I didn't even realize Hamstring's movement debuff scaled with ranks.  Makes perfect sense.
---
Good idea, thanks!
---
Bruh - Stalagg is gonna be full before launch.
---
Based purely on informed speculation: I only think somewhere between 30-50% of the people that will play classic wow are subbed and have reserved names. There are going to be several more East coast PvP servers - Stalagg will be full and have queue times.
---
&gt; I would argue that leaving azeroth was also a big issue. It invalidates the old zones.
---
This is the #1 issue I have! WoW expacs were releases, not expansions. They did not Expand on the game, they INVALIDATED the old stuff.  
---
bad design.
---
Hail Hydra^^xian ^^waterlords
---
Yeh, realised that after I'd made this! Thanks for the info though
---
No no im gonna stomp on those little guys as much as i can!
---
It allows people to snipe high value items for cheap
---
The hard part is purchasing a flight
---
This isnt going to be a valid strategy.  In fact, it's a pretty damn stupid strategy
---
Is something a wrong person would say.
---
Someone is Friending hard.
---
Did you really think you would be safe? Like no shit? 100% for real?
---
Not trying to be a dick but what things did you believe indicated that any of the 12 servers would be safe?
---
Hi, will you please add the character Ahab Wheathoof in to "world of warcraft : Classic" in some kind of way. In memory of  Ezra Chatterton. That would be great, Thanks.
---
I'm so torn about going Arms as a warrior while leveling.  I feel like I'm going to be getting so many weapons while leveling that investing in the arms tree ties to me to a mace, sword or axe.  But I'm not sure that Fury will even be able to compare with damage.
---
Probably the most unfunny thing I've seen on this sub so far.
---
&gt;for the most part you aren't going to get fire and ice or fire and shadow together
---
It's not like Diablo 2 where you had these mobs immune to every element as well as physical, and you needed special runewords on your Mercenary to break the immunity :P That was fucked
---
Stfu
---
Were you one of the folks in Valley of Trials?
---
Was it?! He sounded pretty certain. Lol
---
For me it is even worse, due to college and work I can only play on weekends. 4 more days of intense anxiety
---
Didn’t campfires in classic used to do damage to you if you stood on them?
---
They're just boring mary sues and nobody knows how to write them without making them godly or perfect. Whitemane was just about spot on until they made her a 4 horsemen.
---
He is lying.
---
Nobody is sleeping, we are training for the launch.
---
They're the worst healers in Vanilla by the numbers. No HoTs in raids, and only one good spell (rank 4 Healing Touch - which, admittedly is very good). But Shaman, Priest, and Pallys blow RDruids out of the water in a raid environment. OFC, druids are still brough along for their utility, and a great druid will still perform better than a shitty pally ofc, but in general if you take two evenly skilled players, one a druid and the other literally any other healer, the other class will outperform the drood. Not to say they're bad but.. well technically the fact is they're the worst healers in Vanilla (inb4 downvotes).
---
Does it fill in automatically or do I have to cross it off by myself after I finish an objective?
---
yes, everything is taken care of within the twitch app. 
---
Just go to mod, WoW and like mention below use drop down menu to select classic in the upper right corner. You might have to point to the install directory of classic first.
---
3.6k in the queue, not great, not terrible.
---
&gt;by this time next month, many of us will be 60
---
Ehhhhhhhh, I wouldn't say many. Even at 6 days /played (which is very fast) and 25 days total, you're looking at 40 hours a week. That's quite a lot for a working adult, which o think will make up the majority of us.
---
Nice! Is there a mage cheat sheet?
---
I want to echo this, people are too used to more modern wow's style, where everything is top heavy. Enjoy the freaking journey. It's going to take an easy 140-160 hours (even for people who have played vanilla on pservers and are speed runners this is a minimum number.) For those who haven't played vanilla you could be looking at doubling it.
---
Enjoy the atmosphere, enjoy the quests, the lore, if you are on a pvp server, go to STV. Spend a few days fighting for control of Camp Nessingwary. Unless you are pushing for server firsts, slow down and enjoy it. If you push too hard without having people who are keeping pace with you, you'll hit the end, and have nobody to enjoy it with. (There are far less things to do solo at 60.)
---
Yeah I could do that like the whole reccomendations / requests thing, but there needs to be some higher power going "yes or no, this is or isn't right for the game."
---
BoatyMcBoatface, as funny as it was, highlights the danger of polling. For me osrs was too much of "what the community wants the community gets" versus "is this right for the game? ". Today, Osrs is a confused iteration of a once great game riddled with messy content that deducts from the game's core concepts - similar to retail WoW. The Grand Exchange is a prime example of this - the community wanted it for ease and convenience, however it inflates the economy to ludicrous, noob-unfriendly levels; turns cities into ghost towns; and kills a large portion of player interaction. Sure, the community has given some great direction too (those rooftop agility courses were cool even if they impeded a character's necessity to venture out into the world), but a community shouldn't be the deciding factor. They should definitely have influence, but no definitive powers.
---
It's like making a film: You have a Director calling the shots and deciding what is or isn't implemented. Sure, a DoP or Gaffer might have some creative input and some great suggestions, but ultimately the Director is sculpting and fine tuning their creative vision because they have the deepest understanding of the narrative and the narrative is the heart of a film. Sure, the Director might even use some of these suggestions if they are true to his creative vision, however he will choose not to utilise ideas that diminish, confuse, muddle of generally subtract from the narrative, the thematic context, or the stylisation of the film.
---
A creative process should only be so collaborative, otherwise it becomes tangled and confused. There's plenty of films out there with exactly this problem, but that's a conversation for another time.
---
 I would say Golemagg pvp , mirage raceway pve

And the nose-less lip-less skull face, which no longer exists on retail.

Let's start a guild!!
---
You could be a good dum-dum. They aren’t mutually exclusive
---
Nice to see a fellow 40 something in here. I grew up with Intellivision and the C64. I was already well into my 20's when MMOs even became a thing. I remember staying up until 3-4 AM to play EQ because we were on dialup and the rest of the household needed the phone available.
---
When you say you still play EQ, are you playing P99, or whatever it is EQ has morphed into these days?
---
Just play what you like. Nothing really matters till you've hit 60 and gotten some dungeon blues anyways. Smashing something with an Axe, instead of a Sword won't make that extra 5% crit mean a lot less anyways!
---
I'm playing on the streamer server on Horde side.  Herod is going to be 18% of NA pop and Faerlina is 11% according to the survey.  I would stay the fuck away from Herod.
---
Playing on a server with streamers and being able to participate in events is the way to go, imo.
---
Unfortunately no; however, it's not hard to make one yourself!
---
It really depends how you are levelling your character. If you're levelling alone by questing/grinding, and plan to clear EPL/WPL (which you really should as a Paladin, if you are playing alone, because of the added damage vs. undead skills) I'd train them as they appear.  
---
If you're rolling with a group of friends and clearing dungeons, or your questing group is already quite stacked with damage dealers, you can probably save yourself the gold and let them negate the lost damage.
---
GPS Tracking? Damn that was the shit back in 2004!
---
The crane doesn't fit in the room... jeez people gotta understand we aren't at the time of mini-crane automation just yet.
---
Catch up on reading and designing I've been putting off. Maybe finish a book relatively quickly with the queue times.
---
You know what? How about bodyweight workouts during queue times? How /fit/ would one get?
---
Well played... Well played.
---
This is like the 500th post basically saying "quest addons bad," even though some quest text is so vague that you'll waste a half hour looking for the right mobs if you haven't done it before.
---
That's your choice if you want that experience, but you probably have a bunch of knowledge that new players won't, so I don't think it's fair to turn them away from addons based on an experience that's catered to you specifically.
---
Dude. So much more. I mean have u even tried both recently?
---
All classes in Vanilla are trivial, i wouldn't sweat it.
---
AoE farming will be much less viable with melee leeway on mobs and mobs having different skills in classic compared to pservers.
---
No idea what that is
---
I agree with the authenticity and organic feeling of PVP, no doubt thats a big appeal. Another part of me wants to compete or try to compete with the best of the best PVPers or their ilk. 
---
Good point about the volatility of the server based on streamers, another thing to consider. Thanks for the insight.
---
Hahaha just about. I pretty much drink that every day now, it feels normal now. It's a cup of water every hour from wake till sleep, which isn't TOO crazy.
---
Scenario 2 is wrong. General chat will be zone wide across all layers. You can still advertise for group spots unless the video is implying that people only advertise in /say while at the dungeon entrance.
---
Diablo 3 season 18... not on my phone.
---
Why am I not suprised the top comment isn't chatting about classic wow,  it's just hating on retail.
---
Idk man - it comes down to pop. These pops are so massive - if they stay that way phase 2 the chats just gonna be cancer as fuck.   
---
Wouldnt be surprised if a BARRENS CHAT discord or side chat channel gets created or something
---
Sounds like you've got two holes in your body to spew shit from.
---
Where are all the Herod propagandists? I'm inside the Herod discord and there are no memes. What is this, a bootcamp?
---
'negative progression' is a good way to nail the difference. I never played everquest but it does sound truly terrifying to lose rare gear in a death.
---
I mean, some things can't be helped... lol
---
you duel, lose on purpose and stand on this little fire thing by the entrance, get down to 1hp from duel, and fire damage kills you, run back res on other side of door, that was the vanilla trick we all used back in the day
---
Hoping for brand new horizontal content instead of rereleasing TBC and Wrath. You can go back and play TBC/Wrath on pservers whenever you want. Something brand new would be incredible. I trust this dev team enough by now.
---
I feel like this isn't accurate.
---
You bank all that OT and cash and take some time in Sept. Classic is not going anywhere and you can still get some shit done in Classic during your bit of free time
---
No problem. See you in Azeroth.
---
O mb the last stress test where 15 was max I easily got 15g and that was after buying all my class and profession skills.
---
As a 40 y/o who gave up WoW in 2006, this classic release has me feeling nostalgic. I now have a 12 who will be conscripted to grind so I occasionally go raid and stand in fire or something.
---
Yeah I made two characters on Whitemane and 1 on Stalagg
---
I mean, *I* agree, nowadays. I'm just saying there's probably plenty of people who choose off of arbitrary things like that.
---
I love team solo mid
---
Also, some context: 2004 saw the release of GTA: SA, Half-Life 2, and Fable. Games were barely fully emerged from the 32 bit era, and so many basic mechanics we use in games today hadn’t even been implemented yet. If you weren’t a PC gamer, you probably weren’t even gaming online yet.
---
Hi, /u/Krypt0night

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cskjdu/please_just_decide_my_class_for_me/). 
---
yeah I do agree there is a line to be drawn - I was always OK with the meeting stone because someone still has to BE there and you stil have to GO to the dungeon. 
---
it does border on the LFG side so I kinda get the hesitation. Id be OK with meeting stone summons but never ever ever LFG but thats just me -- still need to socialize for the group but saves a little time
---
Cross my fingers that my wife is a pro, and logs us in right when the servers go live (Herod). Otherwise, watch TV with the wife.
---
Sure hope they break it.
---
I was dead all the way to and in ironforge until I touched the portal to the tram. Then boom, alive on the other side. I didnt know if it was a bug or not.
---
Druid! (first time! =D)
---
Change 15+ minutes to about 3+ hours. Minimum
---
You know beta players did testing in like RFC forward and compared their speed to questing right?
---
haha =D that would of been an awesome way to say it.
---
In a game? My god.
---
I was just speaking for myself. I am not willing to wait a mere 15 minutes, let alone hours.
---
not a bad compromise tbh
---
The first part was me being a dick.
---
Everything after Not Trying to be a dick was me legit asking a question.
---
I ask because a lot of people seem to think only Herod is going to have issues, and I am trying to figure out where this line of reasoning comes from.
---
I do not. Care to explain?
---
At no point.  If it's allowed in the game's lua api, then it's not cheating.
---
Fair, if your average is 21-22 hours then I'm sure that's completely within reason
---
Back when GoT was fun ...
---
Problem is if you don't prep and do things right within a certain time line you will end up not raiding at all or in a shit guild that can barely clear 2 bosses in MC. 
---
A lot of people experienced this problem during the first time vanilla released. They fell behind and Vanilla is so punishing time wise that it becomes a huge task to catch up around the time that AQ40 gets released.
---
As someone who has played a bunch of OSRS and plans on playing classic, this is only half true tbh. Although polls are great for gauging community response, the main reason OSRS thrives is because Jagex adds content regularly to the game. Polls have certainly have had their ups and downs, but I would say overall their effect has been positive. 
---
In fact, when osrs first released, it had mixed results. Although initially a ton of players decided to start playing, it didn’t take them very long to leave. This was the result of no new fresh content being added to the game. After a while, the devs decided to start adding additional content to keep its players playing. And to their credit, it worked. Osrs now has a solid playerbase because of the regular new content that is released. 
---
Many osrs players did not want more content to be released as it would ruin the “purity” of the game. This ideal became outdated as more and more players left. The players realized that having new content that fit osrs thematically was more important to the games health overall.
---
I would say that they'll release the content no faster than vanilla wow was releasing it.  You basically got 1.3 in about ~3 months after release.
---
Phase 2 is a lot going to be pending that server structures/queues/population are well balance for removing layering.
---

1030 was normal highschool bedtime that got more lax as time went as I got older. 11PM-12PM was pushing if I wasn't already winding down but I also knew kids at school who had computers in their bedrooms with parents who fell asleep early so they could stay up much longer.
---
It's great fun! At least in PvP. ^ ^
---
Kinda what I was thinking few months back, except without the savings haha, basically why I had to go with this job anyway. I even clocked in more hours studying to pass as many exams as possible before the final period, so I would have more free time, possibly skipping them completely, but eventually once I realized I would be borderline starving in order to play the game, the reasoning kinda kicked in and I had to find a job. 
---
Luckily, it didn't take me long to find one, but I'm also a tiny bit sad because it made me realize it doesn't make me happy avoiding things that do make me genuinely happy in order to put food on the table. I guess it's that part of growing up that goes away eventually, once you figure your shit out at least. Couple of more years, and hopefully I'll have much more free time to play like Wrath or something, haha.
---
Thank for your experience though, hopefully you'll find the time and get to a place where you'll feel content, or better! :)
---
it was a joke, if you took a sec to read the comments, its a marriage joke, made for all the married folk that are going to play classic, not for big macho men like you sir. you, i understand will put whatever you want on your wall and your good little wife will be in the kitchen. good luck to her and the next two or three you inevitably have to end up marrying.
---
We are reaching critical mass
---
The park in SW
---
I don't think they're cheating. The developer sets the rules, and if the developer is deliberately allowing people to do stuff, then I don't see how you can consider that cheating.
---
They patrolled the majority of the zone, and the debuff disabled health from bandages.  You were going to run into them, and they were going to put a ten minute pause on whatever you were doing.
---
Did it “completely” ruin the game? Of course not; I played through all of Classic, but a lot of people like to romanticize inconveniences.  There’s a reason Blizzard removed elemental immunities—it sucked for people who relied on those abilities.  I don’t think you’ll find many people who actually raided back then talking about how great Rag’s fire immunity was; I know the mages I was playing with weren’t.
---
It sounds like the relics will respawn quickly at least, so we won’t be waiting 5 mins between loots.

Thanks :D It wasn't easy finding german voice files.

Wait I thought It wa southern August 26th at 3pm pdt??

qq moor plz

do you think it would be smart to go ahead and sub now? Don't really care about the names
---
I'd suck a fart out of her butthole and hold it like it was my last breath.

As for someone who is clinically retarded (I play on pve servers) can someone link one of those nifty timers that work on every timezone?

OH MAN A WEEK BEFORE YEAH THEY TOTALLY SHOWED US

There's a lot of Wacraft themed porn on Pornhub.
---
Use the dumbells next to my computer and pretend I'll go to the gym later.
---
Well I'm apart of it. So.....
---
its funny - there seems to be a lot of people who feel that number is very small. but EVERY thread I see where this is mentioned has at least a handful of people comment that a handful of THEIR friends hasnt subbed yet. 
---
If that holds true for a lot of the current pop we gonna have a messy launch on our hands. But its blizzard so thats a fuckin guaruntee anyway XD
---
Those people incorrectly assume everyone is going to be playing on a pvp server lol.
---
Anyway yeah that 5% crit is great but you do get 5% crit from axe specialization right before MS so if you got an axe then you're golden.
---
ah the "I'm not racist.. BUT" crowd (at best)
---
My plan is to level all my alts in Phase 1.  I'm going to be spending more of my free time doing PvP grinding in phase 2 and would rather not deal with being honor feeds towards people looking for world PvP.
---
 it was just for the picture, to hide keyboard and mouse wire &lt;3 thank you for your concern.
---
but reddit is easy. thx for link
---
I'm sure its not optimal..Questing is going to be better .. Its not meant to be a speed leveling guide .. @ 15 had my professions all but mining over 75. Like I said its not for everyone. But I was happy with it ..
---
I play on progression servers. My favorite class will never be available on P1999 so I play a similar class role until it becomes available. A few expansions after that is when I lose interest in the game and stop playing, only to start again when a new progression server is released. It's an ongoing cycle. I haven't played retail wow in several expansions because it became an entirely different game, so I've been bouncing around on private servers for a number of years.
---
What are you saving the gold for?
---
Experienced group of private server tryhards looking to raid 2 days/6 hours per week.  Expectations: class optimization, full consumes, enchants, the occasional speed run, world buffs, no shitty specs, etc.  For example, we expect our shaman to play 0/22/29 so that their group may benefit from improved totems.
---
Raid times: Mon/Wed @ 9pm-12pm EST
---
Most of us are in our late 20's/early 30's and have responsibilities.   As a whole the guild won't be racing to 60 and we understand RL comes before Classic.  
---
Our focus will be on clearing raids as efficiently as possible, keeping raid times very short, etc. 
---
Feel free to PM for more information, though we've recently decided to roll on Stalagg Horde to avoid the massive queues Herod is projected to have.
---
Just post your mobile number and I'll make sure J. Allen Brack DM's you next time they open a server here in a few days.
---
Hemo pvp is with a slow MH like a sword.

It sounds fantastic. Very roleplayi

DONT YOU MEAN MY REDDIT POST FOR UPGOATS KEKEK

I'm on Herod with a good name, so I felt like a speedrunner when going back in to swap classes.
---
Pitch black nights were my favorite part of EQ.  When the sun was setting in Kithicor Woods, you got the fuck out of there as fast as possible.
---
The only thing I heard about the German servers being added is that they're afraid it'll split the community.  
---
That's what happens when you want everyone on one single persistent server though.
---
Doesn't matter, none of us will be playing before the 27th anyway.
---
  Main will be a warlock. I will make a 35 hunter for alchemy. Alchemy is fine having on a non endgame character. You will miss some recipes that a 60 would have access to but it doesn't matter much. You will still have plenty of useful recipes you can get just from the AH and trainer. Also of course transmute arcanite though I wouldn't roll an alt just for that. It's like 4-5 gold per sold transmute which isn't a whole lot considering the cooldown.
---
 Might or might not roll a priest or tank later down the line but not something I will do phase 1. Going to try and stick with the warlock rather than split my time a whole lot. Feels a bit "dangerous" to roll an alt. At least for me it's a risk I will just abandon my main and focus to much on the alt.
---
Shut up, MAGA scum.
---
Lies
---
some people dont mind as much altering their name - Obviously when I first made the cahracter that has my name here FatalStrike was taken.   
---
FatalStrik3x however, was free and its close enough for me!
---
I'd rather wait 10 minutes in que and be on the good server instead of being on the second hand server. 
---
OG herod.
---
He forgot the bit where only a few classes could solo level. Everyone else needed to find a group. 
---
I personally had a blast. Not the bit about looking for a group every night though. Some days I netted negative xp for the day.
---
I would be okay with this too. This would allow for an interesting way to add things like Dark Ranger for hunter (a lot of people want to play as Sylv) Battle Mages, there's a lot of freedom if they are willing to play around with it. 
---
I see things like what they have done for demonology warlocks in retail, and imagine the skill changes but with the vanilla talent system and i can only dream of the possibilities.  I'm probably going to be playing classic for  a long time regardless, but I really would have nothing against new stuff. I never was against wow "moving forward" my issue was that they didn't move forward, they just simplified it.
---
I'm glad it all worked out for you dude! Good luck and quick levels to you! :)

---
**&lt;War Pigs&gt;**   are a UK 'variety' guild based on the RP PvP server Zandalar Tribe. We  intend to experience WoW Classic to its fullest extent. Our main focus  is raiding - but the guild will create significant opportunity for world  PvP, battlegrounds and RP. Our raiding days will be organised around  the needs of the members without comprimising on regularity or quality.  Our experienced leadership aims to develop any player who has the right  attitude when it comes to learning.
---
**Dungeoning Intentions:** Do you love dungeoneering as much as we do? Good - because we plan to do loads of it.
---
**Raiding Intentions**:  Our intention is to complete content on a reasonable timeline, setting  objectives that align with Blizzard's phase system. Simply put, this  means attempting content as it launches. We summarise our expectations  as 'casual but committed'. This means that we are social in our approach  to content, recognising lives outside of the game. However, we are  fully committed to attempting content as it is fresh and this requires a  level of knowledge and desire that we expect our raiding members to  have. **Please note – it is not a  requirement of our guild to raid. Players who intend to be entirely  social are extremely welcome, and opportunity will be created for you to  raid if you decide to raid casually.**
---
**PvP Intentions**:  PvP is the foundation of our RP aspirations. We consider PvP an  important aspect of gameplay and will organise events around World-PvP  and Battlegrounds when they are phased in.
---
**RP Intentions**:  Guild leadership has an extensive background in managing role-play  communities. We whole-heartedly encourage all who RP in this guild. Our  support includes a combination of in-character (IC) channels in Discord  and the forums of our website. **RP  is not a necessity to join our guild, only that we will provide space  for those who want to be creative with their characters in this way.  Raiding will be completely OOC.**
---
**Conclusion**:  We are a fledgling guild looking to create a dedicated and friendly  home from home. Join us today to help shape the way you play. You can  join our Discord [https://discord.gg/Rz6EtG7](https://discord.gg/Rz6EtG7) or sign up with our website: [https://war-pigs.wowalliances.com/](https://war-pigs.wowalliances.com/).

Not convinced? PM me and we can have a chat!

This happened to me in May or something with some news article or youtube video.
---
Right, I think the first few days will be a queue pretty much consistently.  After a week or 2 there should only be queue times at peak maybe.
---
If you are cool with being 20 levels behind your friends, you shouldn't have any issues.
---
You could also log into the queue in the morning, and when you get home from work, it will be ready.
---
There was content that they planned on doing for Vanilla but didn't have the time or budget to complete.  I would create several raids (one 10, 20, and 40 man) that would be so incredibly hard that you would need full Naxx gear to complete.  There's no reason to raise the level cap or break the world by introducing expansions.
---
still got time!
---
When your whitemane and dont give a single fuck
---
Doesnt take into account new servers does it
---
Chicken and rice..and water. Diet of champions (and someone currently on a cut)
---
Children will tell stories about The Battle of Sarkoth
---
Play the game in a window then, or level with someone with 2... Monitors are pretty cheap now a days if you don't need amazing specs.
---
yea as duddy said, its a "kids have it easy these day" type of post, also funny when you understand and had been through the struggle and know about dungeon keys that existed back then
---
This only applies to raids though? So if its likely I won't be a raider then there is no worries or?
---
Ah, dual-sepc'ing as bard I see!
---
The new Classic wow. Where addons play the game for you.
---
sorry i just see way too many hen-pecked and abused men going around the internet making memes of it and it seems like they don't even realise their wives are horrible toxic people because it's just "normal" that a husband should be under the thumb
---
Wheres the broccoli?
---
We all are different i guess. Nevertheless congratulations, you are part of huge minority here. But to counter argument you a bit, I honestly see BfA leveling snoozefest. Why? Well, because they tell you where to go, what to do and you are never in danger. All the melee classes got instant attack without cooldown so what happen is, you check the map, go there, kill stuff by spamming your  spell and move on. It doesnt feel rewarding, it doesnt feel dangerous it doesnt feel immersive. I feel like a blind leveling bot. In vanilla however, you get a quest, you get to a place - you will most likely jsut auto attack, since your first spells arent so cheap to give you instant attack without cooldown (unless you are rogue, but they really need it), you think twice before entering a cave, eventually group up with another guy, say "hi, where are you from?" you throw a joke here and there and after you are done, you add him to friend list, just to meet him 20 levels later in Duskwood. You see the difference?

Lol, so true.  I get home from work only a little bit after server go live on Monday and I hope I can play before it hits midnight XD.
---
Nice sentiment, but wrong thread.  Try posting on the official forums.
---
15g at level 15?  Maybe we just wasted a lot of gold back in the day, or Blizz is more generous with drops. But I can still remember tons of people begging for mount gold...or even a silver for training.
---
If you dont eat you dont need diapers
---
Thank you t. retardo
---
No more play?
---
Well, it was a sandbox MMO. Much like (though not *quite* as much?) like runescape, which also had item loss on death. It's essentially a different spectrum from WoW entirely for the most part in how it plays. Everquest didn't have instances at all for example. So all players shared the same space, even in dungeons.
---
And defensive stance 🙂
---
I think it's reasonable to assume about 30% of the players stay active longer than 3-4 months. It's probably far less than that.
---
Blizzard hasn't provided any auction house APIs yet so there may not be pricing data provided for TSM4 on launch, or ever.
---
Let people do their own thing? If I want to MIN-MAX my characters by having the optimal races paired with their respect classes I'll do exactly that.  I'm not telling anyone else they need to do the research and follow suite... that's their business.  However I will say with the information we have at our finger tips this go around anyone would be a fool not to look up guides and at least try to plan some aspect of their Classic journey.
---
Holy shit. 
---
Schooled me.
---
The classic team seems very competent and in touch with the community. I trust them to add new content a few years down the line that keeps true to the spirit of the game. I personally don't want to go into a TBC server for some of the reasons you listed.
---
How? The ways I used to know to do it don't work anymore.
---
the number of programs that have been crippled by an errant or missing " ; " are untold haha
---
Yea true, it could be.
---
Some could argue that they should have too many at the start initial rush, then merge low pop servers together, setup free transfers to medium pops from high's etc
---
Yes please!
---
*Phresh
---
I did subbed to create a character name and have actually been having a decent amount of fun creating new characters and leveling them up. I haven't played retail since Cataclysm and getting a chance to play monk and demon hunter have been interesting as i've never had a chance to play them before. It seems like just activating my subs gives me access to everything except BFA content/levels for free even though CATA was the last expansion I paid for. Also hopped on some of my old lvl 85's and queued up for some dungeons just to mess around.
---
Levelling engineering or working towards my epic mount, personally
---
So this is how I inadvertently pushed my guild ahead on progress by a month.
---
For a long time I was in the 3rd most advanced guild on my server.  I had a few friends in the #1 guild which had transferred in and had BWL on farm status.  Although they wanted my holy pally I was pretty happy with my guild even though we were only doing MC at the time.  One night about 30 min before raid this other guild asked if I could come fill in for Nef since they were missing a paladin and all I needed to do was live until the mass skele phase and BoP a mage.  So I got in, took two attempts and sadly Judgement didn't drop (other pallies had it already).  Everyone was nice and they thanked me for my time.
---
I was a bit late for raid and my raid leader was worried I was raiding with another guild.  I told him that I was only filling in since I was already attuned and we weren't planning to do BWL for a month.  Well next week we started BWL and actually killed 3 bosses.  Guess he didn't want to risk losing players.
---
So the people already at 60 has something to do? Also it was 3 months long when it was current, idk why they would ever double that time
---
I would wager so.  
---
Either the marketing team is just lazy and only has one set of assets for their global campaign, or, its intentional to confuse people and have a less hectic launch on the 26th.
---
Glad to hear. Thank you :)
---
The guy literally linked a slideshow using different presentation software, in this instance Google slides. How does this response chain cause you to become so aggressive? Take it easy man we are all trying to enjoy the same thing here.
---
exactly!
---
Yes. Most of them seem a bit buggy with 1.13 currently though. Should be fixed soon after actual launch.
---
Ioansaid in an interview that the first few phases will be shorter, they want to release them as soon as possible. 
---
If that means 5 months then later phases would have to be 7-9 which is crazy.
---
Do you really think that blizz will take 10 months to release BGs?
---
People are better at the game today and know exactly what's coming, they aren't going to create a content drought on purpose.
---
I would imagine they're using their modern portions of code for login servers and connection handoffs.  There's no point in re-using their ancient network code that has no bearing on classic gameplay.  I don't play retail but I would put money down that if there's some sort of grace period for DCs to avoid queues now, that they'll also operate for classic logins.
---
Upvote for using all variations of there/their/they're correctly.
---
The praise for streamers is so cringey. 
---
I like my classic wow like I like my coffee, with no streamers.
---
My responsibilities usually have me in bed by 9pm so I can kind of relate to this post as I'll definitely stay later most nights, probably 12-1am.
---
There’s a ton of names left. 
---
Every one word epic, all bosses of zg, aq20/40 (Jin’Do and Osirian, imo), if we really want more human names, van cleef, mograine, razuvious, Thaddius.
---
Sulfuras could work as the pve server. 
---
With myzrael they could also bring in Ironaya
---
But I REALLY want to kill alliance scum
---
Bind track Herbs on mwheelup, track Minerals on mwheeldown. LIVE TO WIN.
---
It becomes a problem when they have to continually raise the stakes. We've already killed literal gods, where do you go from there?
---
Funny that google translates "Razorfen" to "Kraul" for some reason!
---
Read and lift weights.
---
I’m guessing you’re not the streamer bean and trying to get a streamers name on the streamer server is tough, even if it isn’t to troll.
---
Same for me except that im going for human. If you find something can you tell me? Only thing I found is shadowpanther his guide which is great and detailed but I'm worried about how long it will take to level
---
Addon's make API calls.
---
Generally if the API exist then Blizzard is OK with it being used. If Blizzard doesn't want the API to be used by an addon then they either flagged  the API as protected or removed it.
---
Back in vanilla addons had potential to be more powerful as they were open to abuse, and hence why for Classic they are using the 8.x API
---
It's not even close. Holy Pallys are the best healers in the game bar none in both PvE and PvP. They shit on everyone else, especially when compared to Druids.
---
Monday at 3pm Pacific time zone.
---
How many doom and gloom posts do you plan on making that people will ultimately ignore?
---
if we get some /played with any kind of progress during the calendar of 26th it will be pretty amazing. gonna be way more stress load than the test days
---
I was with you until toon.
---
Pro tip: skip it. That quest is impossible with dynamic respawns.
---
When will they make the next server/s? My money's on Wednesday.
---
Not only that but the differences were really small. Like a couple % difference.
---
It's between Soo Lines and CPP
---
It’s classic aside from the stat check raiding is easy
---
*The last boss of Vanilla falls*
---
Alright guys that was fun!  Join us in 3 days for the start of WoW: Classic, season 2!  All your ladder characters will be transferred to open WoW.
---
This may sound dumb, but can you get a few silvers off new players as a tauren leatherworker? You can get a recipe for a 6 slot kodo hide bag and the vendor 6-slot is 5 silver, which may tempt people to buy from you instead. There is also the fact that there are no cloth users in Mulgore, so you would have a monopoly.
---
What a NEW and CONCERNING post. What ever shall we do. We are defeated.
---
Human racials are great for DPS in PvE
---
Human racials are completely trash in PvP
---
In many cases there is a distinction, +5 weapon skill only grants something like 0.1% crit in PvP
---
We’re going home
---
I had a lot of fun in Naxx 2.0, and honestly, can’t wait to do it in Wrath, as well as Classic... but it’s still amazing how mind bogglingly easy Naxx10 was, by 2019 and 2006 standards.
---
I’m so stuck. I always played warrior but I don’t want too. I love horde so I’m thinking shamen, mage or priest? Only 3 classes I haven’t played a lot, but I love rouge and stealth but I love Druid and the forms LOL it’s so hard to decide
---
It's all relative
---
I still don’t get why we didn’t get Vancleef as a server...
---
babies are easy because you put them down and they can't go anywhere. they cry when they're hungry or need to be changed. try being a gamer parent to a toddler who's sole mission is to actively try to kill themselves and your only job is to prevent that from happening
---
People said Blizzard would never do vanilla servers for roughly the same reason.
---
What kind of total population would cause 3-5k concurrent logins?
---
its why fury preraid bis is so much like hunter and rogue
---
Most experienced warriors will tell you not to get deep wounds while leveling. Deep wounds is trash in general, even at 60. You go deep wounds it to get impale, but that’s 20% increased ability damage crits which might sound like a lot, but isn’t when you’re low level/undergeared. Imagine critting for a 200 heroic strike at level 30~. That would increase to the damage to 240. That is not worth 8 talent points. 
---
Skarm has a stream vod that goes over leveling abilities/talents if you want to check it out. Starts at 22:30 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gih31fQGEao
---
no that's portland
---
Blizzard body count
---
He does have a point.
---
I would love to see how stretched out your ass is after you've just reached your whole arm up there and pulled these "facts" out. 
---
Let's be clear about a few things here. You cannot predict the future, and you do not dictate what content is better than the rest.
---
How many posts are we going to get like this? I swear the anti min max crowd talks more about this shit than min maxers do. You rarely see min max posts shitting on casuals for playing what they want, but my god do you see like 8 posts a day about casuals taking up some righteous war against min maxing.
---
This is the dumbest argument. The fact that you think looking away from the road even for a second isn't dangerous then you've been so lucky not to have had any accidents. If you think OP is going to look down for a split second based on his word, lol. A split second turns to a minute, jumping or moving turns to trying to get a quest done. If you can't wait to log in you need to take a step back and think about life. All it takes is a split second to cause an accident and kill someone. I've lost friends to "split seconds". Explain remote desktopping into a game to skip a queue to the family of someone you just killed. 2 hours in the span of a lifetime is nothing, dont try to skip the queue with this way.
---
My husband and I are trying for a baby and I was thinking how much it would affect it all but then I go to think that will actually be great ahaha.
---
Blizzard added a lot of the QoL stuff because people were quitting before level ten.  It’ll happen again, but way more people are going in expecting it now.
---
Because from what I understand, they are only salaried for 40 hours a week, but then encouraged to work tons of overtime.  Legally they aren't required to, but heavy pressure from managers and the environments lead to that.  I wouldn't be surprised if lay offs sometimes are based on how much free overtime people put in.
---
In a big bed with a gf tired from playing WoW
---
wanna send me the file i have the ability to large format print
---
I think those people under estimate the varialbes involved in smashing 2 low pop servers together (names, economy, etc)
---
Just skip it for the moment and come back from darkshore in bearform ;-)
---
At first I thought that this was a sexual reference referring to the meme and I died laughing.

Do you get coords with the in-game map?
---
You know that trolls lived on super continent before there was even Kalimdor? That is before Sundering, when Durotar and STV were side by side? That is like saying Homo Eractus can't be native to Asia because they spread from Africa.
---
I’ve come to realize that yes I didn’t get the joke.
---
Not even for mana regen with 5sec rule? So I don't have that much downtime?
---
wish there was a server for all the PSA people to go onto, leave the rest of us alone
---
Awesome.  Thank you for this!
---
Oh wow I haven't seen 1000 variations of all the other low effort memes and shitposts that before
---
Holy apples and oranges, Batman.
---
Rest In Peace Blix
---
I agree. Cuts it too close to holiday vacation and New Years. Hope it’s true because in that case, I’ll definitely be 60 by p2 :3
---
Well that’s tacky.
---
#420 #classichype
---
I'm married too, bro. Judging by updoots, I think a lot of people chuckled at the joke. These guys have a long, hard road ahead of them if they think that being asked to take down an ugly poster isn't "wearing the pants."  
---
Tiny Rant:   
---
If you're married, and want to actually "wear the pants" in your relationship, you absolutely MUST let your wife have as much of the little things she wants. What movie to see, what to eat for dinner, what freaking decorations to have up, because when it comes to decisions that actually matter (moving, jobs, waiting for kids, money stuff) she will 100% put more weight into what you're suggesting because she feels loved. Wearing the pants is NOT doing whatever you want and your spouse being okay with it.
---
Well as a very casual player starting late you’ll have a hard time but then again just take a server dominated by horde I guess
---
Yeah 3 months no problem, but this guy is estimating 6 months, maybe more! I doubt blizz is going to hold on to every patch, when currently their whole model is around short term profits. If anything, id say theyre probably going to release faster, hence why I said 2 months. 2-3 seems most likely to me.
---
Go big or go home.
---
holy cow, you're right... wrap it up guys, back to retail!
---
I guess I don't get it and I've been married for nearly 10 years. If I want to hang something up on the wall, I do it. If the wife comments on it, I just say "well I think it looks nice!" and it's normally left at that because we don't question each other on every little thing.

---
Thank god I am able to play WoW at work, when I have nothing to do.
---
Shaman reincarnate has saved many a wipe in my day.
---
Oh yeah.  I'm getting in queue on my laptop and just carrying it around the house with me as I do chores, until I break through.  My "give up" time on the queue is midnight so hopefully the queue is less than 7 hours long.  (Famous last words)
---
Bruh
---
TBC and WotLK allow previous raid tiers to be skipped.  That right there is why Classic &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;TBC (as you pu it)
---
nope
---
Yeah...I’d lean priest too.
---
Or hunter or ele sham.
---
Lol where do you work give me that job
---
Imagine being this judgemental of coworkers over hair change to not recognize their personality and name over superficial looks. If you dont recognize someone due to them changing part of themself, then you weren't really friends with them to begin with.
---
Oh sorry my sense a humor isn’t up to par with yours.
---
I’ve never done word of mouth. I’ve always sent them to a database so anytime they have a question they know right where to get the answer. Then they can ask a question if they don’t quite understand what the information online is telling them.
---
By the time P2 drops, communities will already have been formed.
---
It's not just about your guild- I had tons of friends outside my guild that I quested with and my guild had co-ops with *other* guilds to help our alts and lower levels, share mats, etc.
---
Once you've put down roots the only people who will want to transfer are min/max raiding guilds and super small casual guilds, which doesn't really help a new server build a community at all.
---
Now that you say it... Yeah I see how you could read his comment that way. I hope it's not a sinister hater that genuinely enjoys the idea of others getting upset over something... But this is internet and it seems like his haters watch him way more than his average viewer. Fairly odd.
---
Note that all of the things in the OP can be done while levelling to 60, so it might be worth starting earlier.
---
The vanilla map does not have GPS tracking.
---
YOUR SOCIAL LIFE IS GONNA DIE IN SEVEN DAYS
---
I am the boss and I told my co-works they had to play for team building exercises.
---
that sucks, addons just ruin the game making everything to easy
---
Hey! Why are they waiting so long for battlegrounds?
---
At some point each class gets a dungeon set to go after and IIRC they were decent. If you pvp you'll want the pvp gear though when its released.
---
One of the grand Marshall's on my server was apparently an old dude with lots of time. I saw him later at 60 when I was 70 and he was still pvpin rocking the same gm gear.  Wonder if hes still around
---
LOL alts.
---
wow. i bet your wife is happy lol! i completely agree with you! i mean, we both work, we make around the same amount of money, we were able to buy a house together and we do everything in the house together, people  dont get that i can mess with my wife and put a big ass map of azeroth in a room i told her to decorate :D anyway! good chat m8! good luck to you and your lucky wife!
---
Just because people suggest you do something doesn't mean they are demanding you to do something.  Learn the difference.
---
All my used liquor bottles are on display
---
Eh, I'm going rogue... Rushing to 60 is racing to be rich.
---
Hunter/Mage is the same way. Farming liquid 1k gold will only take about 20 hours of farming. I'll have it by the second or third week. That's really the only "race" I give a shit about. Everything else comes after.
---
Dude, he blamed them IRL.
---
!remindme 2 months
---
Keep in mind that name reservations are only ~20-30% people that will be playing the game
---
Classic WoW doesn't force me to do dailies.... Therefore it is far superior in my opinion.
---
Assuming I'm young, lol ok. Why are you so aggressive btw?
---
And you can remove peoples buffs in pvp
---
Enjoy flying and cross-server lfd.  wotlk had legit nothing to do.  
---
Btw tbc private servers always die in a few m9nths because nothing to do but raid.

Thank you for the feedback Fixthemix!  Yeah, this method isn't for everyone and is iffy on a new server but I think a lot of people are discounting crafting professions early on.  To each their own :)
---
Yes? Cooking, mining and skinning. That clocks you in at closer to 6, 5 is if you skip all that. A big kicker is also if you get lucky finding a weapon.
---
Priest if you want everyone to want you
---
Mage if you want ez mode everything
---
Warlock if you want to be in the middle
---
Before launch we’re getting 1 more for sure. If it isn’t named Vancleef I’m rioting.
---
After launch 2.5
---
ill get it tomorrow from the office and put it online for everyone to access :)

my first game will be world of warcrastt classic
---
Tuesday or Wednesday
---
''Reine Banshee'' omg c'est mauvais en francais lol
---
mid 40s here, pog4life dudez.  did I say that right?
---
Dark Elves weren't even that bad, they had friendly relations with other evil races and even had a foothold in the human city of Freeport (half of the city was corrupt and folloed Innoruuk, the god of the Dark Elves).
---
Iksar, on the other hand, were tribal lizardmen that not only started by themselves on a very remote continent, but were also hated by every other faction in the game.
---
your concerns are my hopes
---
These are awesome
---
they make 1030 that are low profile. it's a much better card
---
With every expansion release the game got worse and worse. BC added resilience, welfare epics, 40 man's killed, world pvp killed, flying mounts. Every expansion after that just got worse and worse.
---
My guess is the number of registered users and not characters. It would make little sense otherwise.
---
They skipped the queues for bfa, blizz will want the big streamers in first to create even more hype on release.
---
Troll/10
---
When people type like that it's because there is an emote that shows a reaction when you type that in. So when people type PogChamp or Kappa it is evoking that emote's reaction.
---
One other thing I’d like to point out is that in 2004, it wasn’t exactly a booming MMO market. There were some successful games, but only in context; they would celebrate hitting 100-300K. It was only really until WoW that multi-millions were even remotely imaginable. 
---
So before *and* after WoW’s rise and fall, it’s not as though there was a massive MMO market compared to any other time. If anything, there are more people playing MMOs now, than before WoW came out.
---
Here's a good spec before 30 that'll provide a decent kit for both daggers/swords and provide pretty quick slaying between mobs.
---

---
Dude, you deleted your comment because you knew you were wrong lol. woosh.
---
I'll show you mine if you show me yours!
---
Jokes aside, I'ma make a post later with all my links
---
Did you play on one? This is really not true except for Emerald Dream. The other RPPvP communities are generally not fans of the ED community because of this exact attitude.
---
Not trying to insult anyone or start a fight but please, we need to be careful about telling people what RPPvP is like.
---
3 name reservations on classic and access to some crappy wow clone
---
Im also very torn. But i think im running Warlock for sure. For me, theres Less Locks out there than priests or Mages which means that farming for gear will be easier, especially teir gear. Im a sucker for utility which Lock has in spaces with Essential Curses, healthstones, Summons, the list goes on. Warlock is the second best leveler in the game, only beaten by Hunter. of course others gor their pros and cons too. For me Priest and Mage are too squishy and mana reliant when locks have huge defensives and Life Tap. Priest and Mage are also too popular for my taste and gear Competition is too much.
---
Still ill have a Mage alt for sure.
---
Grocery fellow here as well. Made sure to put my request in months ago lol.
---
Their recent expansion launches haven't even required to you relog if you were in game to access the new content.
---
Count me on board. On an unrelated note, i'm rolling a pally and already have a beard.
---
idk why i like this comment so much lol
---
&gt; I was playing a Ret Paladin, and I deleted my first character at level 40 because I didn't like his hair.
---
Thanks for sharing this lol
---
Which - honestly - is needed... Paladin leveling in vanilla? Not gonna try that torture again..
---
yes you need to purchase BFA in order to play it. afaik a sub only gives you access to the character creation and therefore name reservation.
---
Best content I have seen on this sub.
---
Good shit.
---
Hey there!
---
You guild does sound like a good fit for what I’m looking for actually. I know you’re not looking to rush into raiding but is there some tentative schedule that you guys had in mind for days/times to move into eventually?
---
Thanks :)
---
I agree. TBC just like any other xpac should have been a continuation of the content and not just a new game altogether
---
I personally consider healing to be way more fun than DPS. There's very little that's routine about healing, at least for shaman/druid/priest. There's no rotation. The spells you use can and often will vary by night and boss, as well as gear. 
---
Shaman healing is pretty fun, with a mild learning curve. Cleansing totems make healing way easier, and you get three mana regen totems. (Mana spring, Mana tide, and the trinket from your level 50 class quest. TAKE. THE. TRINK.) Chain heal is a standout ability in a game that has lots of AOE damage but not a lot of AOE healing, but healing wave ranks are plenty potent too. If you're feeling particularly weird, you can also spec 1h Enh and go all tanky, or 2H Enh and blast things with Windfury. Elemental is ok, but it's way better in BC. Also class tier looks great.
---
Druid healing in Vanilla is an adventure. You will work harder than any other class and still only show up in the middle of the healing charts. Meters aren't everything, and you have marginally more mobility than the other classes thanks to Rejuv, Swiftmend and Nature's Swiftness. Healing Touch's cast time is a tad too long until you hit stupid levels of +healing and can downrank to 3-4, unless you develop some great pre-casting skills.  But no one's bringing Druid healers for their heals unless you're an epic player with epic gear, they're bringing you for Battle Rez and Innervate. You will be able to instantly bring back people lost to fire or crushing blows, saving the wipe. You will energize one of the last remaining healers with a whole new mana bar so s/he can finish the fight and that boss dies. You're going to be the most unsung hero of the raid, the one that no one notices until you're not there. You might not even have to heal, you might be asked to go crit-chicken, or feral, so you can buff 4 other players. And you get to do all that while being able to shapeshift at will as part of the dynamic community known as Durids. Remember, durid is 4 friends, sez Alamo. 
---
You can probably guess which class I'm rolling. Even with ugly cat form, I am Horde, and I am a Druid.
---
We get it OP, you've had sex.
---
In this case it's Google's version of PowerPoint, but yeah, same idea.
---
&gt; You cannot predict the future
---
You can't predict the future.  That's true.  However, an intelligent person can make excellent guesstimates of what is likely to happen in the future.  One of the worst things about being smart is that life has little suspense.   You pretty much know what will happen next.
---
Well I mean technically you can call me a resub if you take into account I resubbed after 12+ years.
---
That is literally our guild motto. FOR THE HORDE!
---
So glad my last day of work that week is on Tuesday (Germany) FeelsGoodMan
---
I used this in retail. It's a very powerful addon. I am not happy to hear that it'll be in Classic..
---
I'm down if they add breaches
---
this fresh, delicious, tasty, meaty, turkey filled, cold cut combo. I eat three everyday to keep me strong!
---
Creates 2000 word article on how to make gold.  What a dick indeed.
---
Not really.  I woulda much rather had good  casters who knew wtf they were doing instead of a trinket for a spec I never played:(
---
Happy cake day!
---
I have no idea at the level of difficulty it would be, but it's the money that they're worried about. They just (to me) severely underestimated the amount of sweaty dorks who want to play WoW on the 26th.
---
midnight between monday and tuesday for EU
---
Level with swords untill you have the gear to support going daggers.  It's way more forgiving that way.
---
It was a good change by them to give you all expansions but the current one just for subbing. I still remember the time where you had to buy all the old ones you didn't have one by one.
---
Literally anything. Aarlocks are a solid class by themselves. Anything you add is surplusage. I would go a noncloth just for early game loot distribution.
---
Priest is probably the best, as he can be a dwarf and start in the same zone. Also both classes lack mobility so you wouldn't slow each other down. 
---
And Life tap + healer = no downtime ever. Not to mention it would be nearly impossible to kill either of you in world pvp
---
You can level anything with a warlock.
---
you are fucking retarded
---
Im on the last step now. Cant decide on face and facial hair.
---
I didnt start playing until the last week of vanilla so my story is for Kara in BC. My brother did the dumbest thing ever which was kill himself during Curator with a Shadow Word: Death. It was one of those real life /facepalm moments that we've never let him live down.
---
He at least has the achievement for reaching max level with 5 different classes, so he has at least that many, but wouldn't surprise me if he had every class at max.
---
He focuses on his warrior though.
---
Still gonna need fear ward tho
---
Priest or pally are both good calls
---
Because you don’t know what you’re talking about. Point is let people play what they want and try to be good at it. I was around in Classic. This whole “Hybrid Tax Is So Bad It’s UNPLAYABLE” is not only dumb, it’s wrong. Yeah you have to try 10x harder and deal with people like you who will refuse them on principle but that’s better than being forced into X class or spec because it’s “the best.”
---
Anything will do.
---
For me, it would be something like being able to see someone's talents through inspect. As long as the add-on doesn't do something that can't be done manually, doesn't provide information you aren't supposted to have and can't check through outside resources like a website, I think it's ok. Also, I think all aesthetical add-ons like action bars, unit frames and stuff are perfectly ok as everyone prefers different UI and layout.
---
“Actively try and kill themselves” 😂😂 done me!
---
My only regret is not reproducing in my early 20's when Vanilla came out. I could have had kids farming for me.
---
I was one of the first members of Stature of the gods. Did not recognize many names in the guild on the website. Perhaps my memory has gotten bad.
---
But they're going to think you play Retail.
---
Only noobs do the run. the real pros do the skip
---
They control how many servers there are, they decide the parameters of what's high pop/full, they will have analysed all the data to determine pretty accurately how many players there will be on launch and what the retention rate will be.  
---
Creating artificial scarcity is just a way to maintain hype - seeing a bunch of low pop servers wouldn't do much good in that regard.
---
Must be hard living a life of so little excitement huh? Gtfo with your cold ass takes and sense of superiority. Take it somewhere where people care.
---
Oh shit you're telling me there's no BARBER IN CLASSIC?? God I hope I don't grow to hate what I chose
---
(Fart noise)
---
Same boat here, 3 out of 9 people i know comin back for classic have subbed for name res, most people simply dont care enough
---
Im honestly worried for herod becoming flat out locked and being unable to play with friends at all. (And i dont feel the risk of swapping server is worth it, after all I subbed specifically to get my names, its not worth losing them trying to go to a new server)
---
I feel like they are gonna add a few new servers on launch, that way the new people who didn't reserve names will be automatically assigned those servers
---
We're looking at the cause of something and i'm guessing the effect of it. 
---
I'm simply saying the easy appearance change will be a part of something changing interactions of the game. Whether it be 1% or 75% of the reason. 
---
If our result is Retail, and all decisions leading to it started with Vanilla, then it's not a question of if a decision changed it, it's how much it changed it.
---
What do you mean? You can tank fine as arms or fury when you level. You can even tank everything 60 preraid as fury and arms.
---
Sweet! What do you think about the city compared to a comparable German city? How's the food? How is the culture? I want to visit Germany really bad!
---
Priest is great for duo. Druid isn't bad either and Druid/Lock are pretty decent.  
---
DR is different for root and fear but don't know if you're thinking of PvP at this point.
---
&gt;No matter the build, always push for Anger Management at level 20, Sweeping Strikes at level 30, and Mortal Strike at level 40.
---
Isn’t this just saying “no matter the build, only build Arms until lv 40” lol. Kinda defeats the purpose of the “no matter the build” part
---
Kinda crazy to respec to fury at level 40, usually goes the other way around. Between swiping strikes and mortal strike, and fury, the choice is usually very easy to make.
---
&gt; there’s still a very real gear check in place, even for Molten Core.
---
There isn't really. If most people in the raid know what to do, you can clear MC whenever you can field 40 60s. On pservers, it's completely normal for any remotely serious guild to do their first raid like 3-4 weeks into the server, clear MC on the first go, do Onyxia maybe the next day, and from then on they can clear MC+Ony in an evening.
---
Yeah, they will be good estimators and that was the point so I guess it worked haha. I just wonder how many people on Herod deleted 1 of their 3 to make one on Stalagg just in case because that would heavily skew at least Stalagg's numbers if a substantial amount did.
---
I think we just need to give Blizz way more credit at this point. They're obviously actively monitoring this situation and if all the servers are approaching "high" then I can't imagine a world where they don't add at least one new one before launch. 
---
Unless of course, their statistical analysis shows a situation like I mentioned earlier where a crazy amount of people delete one character on Herod just to get a spot on Stalagg and they know something we don't (that even if Stalagg says "high" it's a lot lower because a lot of people who make up a part of that "high" also have 1-2 premade on Herod)
---
They need to give a few more PVP servers. Giving one at a time before release makes it unappealing to switch since that might fill up just as bad before or during release.
---
They were in the southern area where I was doing Tirion’s quests. I just read a post on gamespot about how it had been nerfed to forty-five seconds. I wasn’t able to find a patch note on it.  Plaguelands and Strath had a lot of very long debuffs for a while.  Most were along the lines of a small stat decrease and not a big deal.
---
The point wasn’t how terribly game breaking this one debuff was.  Some things were challenging and some things were annoying.  I’m looking forward to the former, and Ill tolerate the latter.  I don’t believe most people when they say they’re looking forward to annoyances.
---
Yah, being smart actually sucks.  The old adage that ignorance is bliss is quite true.
---
Gonna be honest with you boys, I rolled horde ONLY to relive barrens chat
---
No it’s not, but I have a hard time believing guilds can down Rag with full greens and a handful of T1.
---
My advice; just don't choose a full server.
---
Initially, no. Most servers will probably be quite well populated at the start, that being said some may reduce in players over time but that will probably be true for all servers.
---
Sort of, but you can't/shouldn't move people between layers except in edge cases as the layer you are on, should be the layer you are on the whole time until layering is gone.
---
Haha ok i yield!!
---
Well played sir, I kneel in your general direction for thou hath out roleplay-ith me.  Good day sir
---
Whenever I go to any city of significant size, I'm always amazed to see actual video game ads out in the public.
---
So, every US east PvP server will have tremendous queues as of now, before most players have even resubbed, with the exception of Stalagg which has just hit "high" and will definitely reach "full" shortly. Launch will be a disaster unless they release at least a few more servers before the 26th.
---
Yes. The difficulty or community aspect were not the big allure of Classic WoW.
---
In my opinion, it was mostly the world that did such a great job of pulling you in and keeping you invested. Ever zone, every quest, everything you did just made so much sense overall. Vanilla WoW always made you feel like you are actually part of one large world, sharing it with a thousand other people. It felt that way because the game forced you to be a part of that world. It did not let you "skip" anything. Barely any teleports, and realism and world sense were more important than "convenience". Shooting a frost bolt at a water elemental did nothing, that thing was immune, because it made sense. Was it convenient for the frost specced mage trying to do the quest? No it wasn't. Did it make the world as a whole feel immersive and special? Hell yeah it did.
---
Nowadays, just spam those frost bolts at anything you come across. There is no such thing as resistances anymore. Convenient, sure. But no uniqueness and character left to make the world feel real.
---
I like it, but stop reposting it lol.
---
[Well...](http://i.imgur.com/bgiEDTU.gifv)
---
Love doing this with concert posters at venues toward the end of the show. They’re just trashing em anyways.
---
Honestly, by the time launch comes i can see almost every server being full.
---
They need to add more servers this is w shitshow

Fair, I’m just thinking in all situations. Like you can easily tag team elite quests as a spriest/lock. Get that stack going and melt elite mobs before you run out of mana.

Sounds like things are getting Stalagg Tight for my Stalagg Mates.
---
I’ll uhhh...I’ll show myself out...

On Herod, so probably several hour queue. Just gonna get ripped and play a bunch of games on steam that o haven't gotten around to, most likely.
---
"Severe queue list:
---
Half of em, screw you lmao"

-Blizz
---
You could ask to have that one when they are done with it :)
---
Pfft casual! He doesn’t sleep at night! He’s too busy farming fir raid consumables.

That's where you're wrong, I gotta sleep up till release so that I can play for 48 hours straight; don't wanna be logging on after 9 hours of work

---
Thank you Sir, this cleared up a lot of things for me
---
Rag will he downed week 1.
---
Players will be going into rag with Pre raid Bis, some of the dungeon blues are better than MC gear.
---
In that case the only things separating them for me are Perception vs Escape Artist and aesthetics pretty much.
---
Yeah - you'd be surprised how often we run into shit like that. Almost everything is named after a person or family.
---
I always wanted for blizzard to implement a "hardcore" server, much akin to how EQ1 would have servers with different rules and limitations.
---
Imagine WoW with permadeath in a PvP world, nobody would dare to play again. It would be truly exceptional to reach level 60, it would be crazy to do a raid, perhaps even do some bosses and then imagine dying...
---
Would be very easy to implement, and I dare say there would be enough interest for at least 1 server.
---
Yeah but that's the Monday before launch.

---
I'm shocked they are putting any marketing dollars behind Classic at all. I don't know why but I still get the impression this is an afterthought for Blizz and they are still salty that they were even forced to do this in the first place.
---
Hmm, I'd be fine with that but I suppose making my own build couldn't hurt too. I'm just reluctant because I was really young during vanilla so idk how well it'd work lol
---
Guess that explains bieber and lil wayne...
---
Seriously, with [4 threads in the last day about the same thing](https://i.imgur.com/epJqyxS.png), it's clearly not just him displaying his doubts or concerns about Classic. Just looking to rustle some feathers.
---
What happens on release when all the people wanting to buy join?
---
&gt; Auto-loot  
---
What is this?
---
Cept once you get your BIC helm, that shit is never going to be seen again.
---
Yeah, playing an Iksar was a really fun experience. There were a lot of benefits to playing the race, but you always had to keep a look out over your shoulder.
---
Some players would manage to grind out the faction to become tolerated in some of the main cities, but it was a hell of a lot of work.
---
Ahhhh you’re right
---
Not anymore.
---
But Classic will.
---
You sound like you know what you're talking about, can you link some talent spec? :) Thank you!
---
I'm 38 and I am super hyped for Classic
---
You're a fucking meme.
---
It's not awful, a bunch of warriors just love to cry about how "awful" warrior leveling is to try and justify how over poweredly broken warriors are in 1.12.
---
I want it all. I want progression servers so I can play BC and wotlk again, but I also want to see new content for classic. I want to see where they go if they could start developing wow again with the communities help.
---
Easily the most satisfying class I've ever played.
---
I wish there was an ironman server in WoW.
---
Blizzard, please?
---
It's not fog of war, it's an un-revealed map
---
LoooooooooooL
---
What i win if i get exalted with Bloodsail and Steamwheedle?
---
is this addon free to use? How do you add it to classic?
---
Yeah that’s with people going in and out of the game. People won’t be logging off 2 minutes after they log in when the game launches.
---
Meh, I think this meme kinda sucks. I'm assuming the pic is heavily reused among the 4chan folk?
---
chug nyquil
---
Shaman are kind of boring to level tbh. Pre 40 you're either going 1h flametongue/rockbiter with shield, or 2h WF. 2h WF is strong when it works 1 shotting mobs with ease, but you can also easily die to mobs if you get a miss/miss/dodge and WF never goes off. 1h+shield with FT/RB is better than 2h WF overall, but is also more boring; flame shock, searing totem, AA to win. Rinse, repeat. Come to think of it, WF is the same way, but at least getting that lotto WF/WF proc is exciting.
---
You can heal any dungeon which is a nice plus, regardless of your spec. Just make sure you're meleeing mobs in-between heals to speed up the dungeon run, you're AA's do a lot of damage.
---
Very weak in PvP imo, if you land frost shock/earthbind totem then you should be fine against most ranged classes, but if they resist then your fucked. Against melee classes (rogue/warr/pally) you're basically fucked. 
---
At 40 you can go Ele which is probably what I'd do just to switch it up. Better in PvP than Enh, and strong DPS, but worse overall levelers and you'll need a good mage friend or 3 to make sure your stocked on water, otherwise you'll be spending a metric shit ton of gold on water. Again, you can heal any dungeon easily. 
---
Lvl 60 Ele/Resto hybrid is easily one of the strongest overall PvP specs in Vanilla, good for solo content/farming, Open World PvP, group/premade PvP, and healing in Dungeons/Raids. 
---
Healing in Dungeons/raids is a blast imo, if you like healing. CH is dope, mana spring is dope, WF totem is dope, and LHW is dope. Poison/Disease cleansing totems are also dope, in the fights that use em. You'll feel like a G. Deep Resto is very strong with Mana Tide ofc. 
---
Overall my favorite class in WoW, regardless of xpac. Going to roll Priest this time around though, since my main on BFA and for the last 14 years has been a shammy (also level'd one on K1, so been there done that).
---
Yeah so half of the NA realms?
---
Don't have to hold down shift to loot all.
---
Just upload the file so we can use it too :)
---
&gt;"only" makes you "deputy".
---
I think thats an example of power creep actually. If you become a Deputy two seconds into an investigation, and get to talk with the Regent, its logical how you would be considered champion/savior after all your feats of Vanilla/TBC/Wrath. 
---
&gt;The issue in the end is that there is a world-ending event at the end of each new expac,
---
Yeah, this is a narrative problem with expansion packs. Its kinda tough to sell an expansion pack without a major conflict with stakes. At the same time, there's a lot of fatigue as you described.
---
Sent PM
---
You aren’t quitting, you are starting over.
---
It absolutely does - the 1 rage per 3 seconds is effectively decreasing your rage decay by 1/3
---
They certainly under estimated the demand.
---
If only there was some way to reduce the severe queues..
---
not to mention the vast vast m8nority of players are wiling to waste half a month of sub to reserve a name 
---
layering is going to rip, and like if its multiple hours of queue just to get into a server they need to restart a few hours later people are going to rip their dicks off
---
How are flying mounts bad?
---
&gt; If you’re concerned about long queue times affecting your play experience, you may want to consider creating characters on a lower population realm
---
which is literally just Stalagg and Fairbanks right now which are both sitting at high and will probably be full prior to release
---
release day is going to be so chaotic
---
Fun fact: Henry Cavill nearly lost the Superman role as he was raiding in WoW when he got the confirmation call and missed it.

Wonder what class/race he will play
---
Rather than holding shift when you right click to auto-loot everything, you can just turn that option on in the settings for basic right click looting.

Nice repost but still funny. Can totally relate to the shirtless dad.

I haven't really followed about classic much. Did they comment if you can wall jump and reach zones like below Stormwind or Hyjal or uninstanced Zul Gurub and Zul Farak and whatever else there was? Or did they fix all of these for classic?
---
It all makes sense now
---
I mean, there's so much talk and ultimately it makes no difference for the classic that is comming how you obtained a beta key in the original beta. It wasn't as much targeted at you as the type of things people find to be suuper important right now.
---
Per an interview he couldn't answer the phone when he was offered Man of Steel because he was playing WoW.
---
You can still tank whilst levelling with Arms or. Fury.
---
give them all a number and be done with it
---
They use Hero, they used Commander before. I think even if we had 5 decent ones it'd still feel exhausting.
---

Feint is the only one i can see skipped. At least take the first level on 16.
---
I like this one better:

Lvl 45 is the halfway mark and you are worth honor at around lvl 49. Making 50-60 a nightmare as 60s are in those zones to farm end game gathering stuff and finishing up professions. It’ll be as bad as everyone is saying if you’re on a PvP realm trust me. Anyone worth honor and who isn’t 60 who is in a routine area in the 49-60 route will be camped 3 times by every 60. More than 3 times they won’t be worth anything.
---
Not according to streamer prio.
---
It can. Eve online still has incredible loss if you lose a super or titan, even though a lot of the people who have those ships have so much money it matters less to them, but it's still billions of isk. The main player retention problem they've had is just making the game bad, not so much the loss involved. Probably have a lot higher users right now than for quite some time due to some positive changes they've been making the past couple months as well.
---
The game just has to be designed from the start as a hardcore experience. If they added XP loss to current wow or something people would bail so hard so fast lol. If they came out with "wow 2.0" and from the start said hey this is a hardcore old version of and MMO set in the warcraft universe, and it's got permadeath, they'd still have a lot of interest and retention.

New goal: level a druid far enough to only buy the Soothe Animal skill
---
In addition to what others have already said, if you have a lock in the group he can hellfire-suicide
---
Can someone paste what it says..
---
Pls no
---
First toon on a new server I have always felt it is best to start out with a profession that lets you make gear for yourself, and the gathering prof that supports it.  It works out well because there are always people around that want to buy the greens you make as well early on.  So you might consider starting tailoring + a gathering profession to make money (since tailoring doesn't require gathering support).  Or you could go herb/alch, then drop herb for tailoring at 60, and roll an alt druid to gather on.
---
You don't really need to grind for titanforge. It's just an extra bonus if you *choose* the grind. 
---
You don't get a choice in vanilla. If you want to do PvP or PvE at endgame, you *must* grind. You don't actually need to get better at the game, you just need to put in a part-time job.
---
In BfA, you can put in enough time to hit caps and it's good enough. You'll be OK as long as you play well.
---
Some people want to be able to play a game that rewards skill over time spent
---
There is a medium PST server is there not?

Righteous work mate, using your guide for my paladin :)

For every 100000 people that say something as a joke there is 1 guy that will do it.
---
i remember selling bone chips to other races trying to get friendly with iksars in field of bone. always someone there shouting that they were buying all bone chips.
---
Yeah it's a very tricky problem, see my response to the other guy. 
---
I think having a few 10 mans that are actually harder than 25/40 mans is the correct avenue, but it's not an easy solution.
---
Another really out of the box solution would be to have some raids that are kind of like those WC3 campaign scenarios where you have 1 group of characters that is on this side of the map dealing with 1 problem, and then another group split off trying to obtain another objective. You could choose who goes where at the start, obviously. This way you could have all the great things about smaller group gameplay, and later when the groups meet up you get the epic battle with a ton of people.
---
It's all good, I'm not trying to be negative about it.  Just looking at things logically.
---
Man that sucks, glad he's okay. 
---
Definitely need to keep an eye on weather in tornado-prone areas, especially if a season change is coming. We used to get them semi-regularly where I grew up and they can really spring up out of nowhere sometimes.

Asmongold did a Hyjal-exploration stream (as well as a some other secret areas) early in the beta.
---
49 here.  Played since vanilla. Looking forward to playing when it was an mmo again
---
If they do more content in classic, they need to address this problem. Outlands can't just make endgame vanilla irrelevant. They need to bridge them better, maybe make outlands require attunement which involves killing kel'thuzad, while also giving higher level players incentive to help out fresh 60s. 
---
Something like that.
---
Sanctuary buffs your soc proc which is a large portion of damage. 
---
But ret aura might still be ok.

The existing PvP realms all now have either a Full or High population tag. With the potential for extended queues on the Full realms, and 10,000+ queues on Herod, we are opening two new PvP realms on Monday, August 19 at 6:00 p.m. PDT:
---
Blaumeux – PvP – Pacific Time Zone
---
Skeram – PvP – Eastern Time Zone
---
We urge players on PvP realms to consider moving to one of these realms. Doing so will help spread the player population as evenly as possible before launch and provide the best play experience for everyone.
---
FTP
---
Your virginity.
---
Dying at lvl 98 was like losing 5 hours of Baal runs.
---
it's actually quite the opposite, you people are making a big deal of out nothing. Blizz is seeing what the population is like and adding servers to meet the need, the wrong thing to do is start off with too many servers and have dead servers half way through Classic.
---
Shit, the racial slurs are probably refreshing.
---
&gt;New Realms Coming for WoW Classic - WoW Classic General Discussion
---
Taking bets on this going to High-Full in the next two days.
---
Would consider moving to one of these new ones, but I'd be worried they won't get filled enough.
---
But this specific ad is in NA. Why do people in Georgia care about when it launches for the rest of the world?
---
You are very welcome, I have been thinking and talking with a lot of people about this for the past few days myself. I am fairly to very confident in all of the points I have mentioned, but this one is for sure the most unclear and probably personal preference.
---
The point about stance dancing is a good one, but I find that during leveling, 3/5TM for 15 rage dance is good enough - when you are Arms, you most likely Charge -&gt; Swing -&gt; pop SweepS -&gt; 0rage Berserk Stance -&gt; Swing into WW. By having 5/5 TM this does not really become any more efficient, until you start pooling rage. And then you have to pool just the right amount to not clip it, which feels weird to check for sure.
---
Dungeons are similar - you probably want to stance dance for Mocking blow or Berserker rage, both of which are &lt;15 rage.
---
But if you wiped the boss resets its HP, so how did that work?
---
How about a non stealth group member?
---
*inhales*

#INTRAST YE ON A PINT
---
Its really not that hard to learn a class, maybe it was when most players were 12 and didn't even know what an MMO was, but leveling to 60 is overkill for that purpose.
---
All the RP servers will have ques, any server that is low/medium on launch day will. 
---
Any retail/tourist/new random players who log in on week one and see ques will just find the servers that don't have them and play on those.
---
My mistake, scorpids yes.
---
What comes to my mind first is BIG. Everything is so big, roomy and there’s so much space even in downtown Minneapolis or St. Paul. I come from a comparable German city (Düsseldorf, which is kinda the capital of a German „state“) and everything is so small and fast there. 
---
I also love how everybody here has his own little house, which would never be possible in big German cities (of course there aren’t really houses in downtown Minneapolis but just 10 minutes out there actually are...).
---
The food‘s good although I wanted to try all the food chains, so I haven’t really gone to a higher class place yet.
---
And I like German beer better ;-). There are so many craft beer breweries here but I like the German less crafty and milder beer better.
---
That’s my thought, at its worst I think it’ll be 80% English and that’s huge. It’s not gonna be that bad most likely anyway.
---
First thing you do is getting mc attunement as you can do it as a dps with full greens.
---
Lol yes ofc but he was specifically talking about the fact that only frostbolt is bound in this picture , even tho he's in naxx so presumably a fire mage (also has combustion -- confirmed fire mage) 
---
It wasn't about the ranks being useful I was just giving reasons why a fire mage would even have 2 versions of frostbolt on his bars at this stage in the game.
---
But yes, you are correct, r1 fireball is indeed useful against rogues.
---
I missed the beta and stress tests cause of real life obligations... hence the client question!
---
Play of the game
---
Do not learn the best spell druids can get to speed skip dungeons and raids.
---
As a hunter, dont pay to learn guns. Guns are just basically inferior to crossbows and bows, and bows are inferior to crossbows.
---
It was awsome! I used to watch it a lot
---
Uhm really? Can someone tell me why I have to wait 19 more months now?
---
Heres my cheat sheet. Bring a priest with you.
---
That is fucking terrifying.
---
You'd have more luck setting them up in retail than in an old private client. Either way you can't perfectly set it up in another game though, should have done it during stress test.
---
I guess I’ll just stick to Herod if I’ll get queues on both servers hahaha
---
Atlantis is real! Confirmed!
---
Where? I wanna walk by it
---
I agree some of the leveling ranks for certain abilities I didn't bother with for sure.
---
Not to mention the controls of WoW were absolutely incredible coming from a game like daoc!
---
That would get botched so fast.
---
I bounced my daughter in one of those for a back when I started playing way back when. I used a laptop and would sit on the couch and bounce her for hours and hours. Usually until she’d been asleep forever and I hadn’t noticed because I was chasing that next level or too focused on the dungeon I was in.
---
Don't forget unhelpful quest log tips.
---
"Find the missing guard."
---
When you were the original #nochanges crowd
---
They are, but they'll be diluted. There are several other servers going there too.
---
No, games haven't always had a difficulty meter, and by saying that they always have you are really showing your generation.
---
The fact that dad has the exact amount of nodes required makes this perfect.
---
Check twitter to see if the servers are down. They could be in a small maintenance window.
---
Maybe I want to RP a druid who can't stealth though...
---
Herod is #1! ^(in queue length) 
---
Just like how America is #1! ^(in childhood diabetes and school shootings)
---
Agreed.

British memelord look for regular group to occasionally quest and do dungeon content with, Just want some laughs and casual playstyle to try and bring some some of that community wholesomeness that's missing from retail. PM for discord and more details if finna play some wow classic
---
Mostly /s, but no I work day shift. I plan on napping through the day, checking my addons, and logging in like an hour or so ahead of time to save a spot in que.
---
While that’s nice didn’t Blizz change AP and damage scaling in like1.10 making the AR less awesome?  I can’t remember exactly what it was but it had to do with weapon speed and the damage range on the weapon
---
Well, classic wow is largely born out of the disdain for retail. If WoW ceased to exist after wrath for some reasons we wouldn't have a weird bastardization of the old game to draw comparisons to.
---
I understand you may be tired of reading it but thats such a big chunk of why this game is even coming back.
---
I don't think people in this sub are realistically thinking about the fact name reservation is probably a very small percentage of what is going to be the actual player base.
---
Finally a realm for French Canadians
---
Dude shush
---
I read this in the exact accent
---
I mean you aren't supposed to solo it. The whole point of the cave quests in starting zones is to encourage people to group up. With 3-4 people you can handle it easily.
---
Wow, that was my 20th birthday, what an honour
---
I'm seeing people stating that Dire Maul came out three months after vanilla launch.
---
*Well Acktually*
---
WoW launched at the end of November 04. DM came out in March 05. Thats *four* months.
---
And the honor system wasn't released until May of 05. So thats like six months. 
---
*pushes up glasses intensifies*
---
Considering Stalagg was added after and it's high now, you'll be fine. There's still a week to go, plus the wave that'll create on release.
---
Certainly &amp; I do agree, was more of a silly observation than anything
---
Finally a realm for French Canadians ofc
---
He's child-friendly and has no former convictions

If they had a redemption questline like they hinted at, that would've been so cool.

Great job OP c:

---
My Kids also kinda proud of their gamer dad, so ... why hide such an amazing hobby ?!
---
butt status: hurt
---
Nice 6 hour notice
---
How? People know of Herods issues. Launch players will STUFF Stalagg. Idk why people still don't understand that only a small amount of the player base created characters. If the rest of pvpers flock to Stalagg , it could be even worse than Herod. Do I think it will? No, they will release another server. Is it possible? Absolutely.
---
You got to play as a lizardman, which considering the graphics limitations was one of the more badass-looking races.
---
Definitely taken this skill
---
Herod is going to be a fantastic clusterfudge.
---
Ok cool. Guess that also means you can go onto the top platform above the auctioneers in the stormwind auction house via wall jumping then. That was always a fun but sometimes time consuming thing to do, trying to get up there.
---
Okay but are they pvp guilds?
---
Thank you for sharing. Skeram is an awesome name choice. Such an iconic boss!
---
Skeram Skeet Squad?
---
I got that same poster but it's dark as hell and can barely see the details.
---
They should have rolled a stealth class.
---
I researched as much as I could based on polls and where people were headed. I wanted to be on a LOW pop PvE server. It was still low when we were all choosing names, it is high now. 
---
T_T Oh well.
---
It matters the most since 99% of helms look like dogshit on them and will need to be hidden, with the best looking ones not hiding the face at all.
---
I’m taking off on launch day but that’s because I don’t want to go to work on Monday. Taking the whole week off. I’ll just play the new diablo season until queue is done.
---
Couldn‘t agree more! The different variables make it so much more fun and gives you a different kind of challenge, at least for me. Healers, rise up!
---
Fog of war comes back when you leave the area. In WoW, it remains uncovered. It's not the same. ;)
---
I feel like people who don’t have PH don’t have much warrior experience. It saved the raid multiple times in actual Vanilla for me, beyond it saved my ass daily in PVP and fuck up pulls in solo PVE.
---
1) or maybe your just really bad at getting them, it wooshed you very hard... 
---
2) Nope cus I can twitch a finger w/o looking at my phone or away from the road, not an idiot who can’t move a finger like you expect everyone to be lol
---
Perhaps we will see 5+ more servers come one at a time before launch as the previous one fills up.  If the numbers arrive, they'll make more.
---
While the men played hardcore d2.
---
That’s awesome thank you!
---
I don't own BFA so now is not the time to play retail.

I am too noob to know how to link them, I listened on Spotify. I think it’s also on YouTube, but it’s Countdown to Classic, episode #117 has warlocks at 34 mins in and episode #116 was mages at 1hr 37 mins.

They are long podcasts but worth listening to if you have time!

My boss just approved 2 of the 5 days I requested off next week. I'll be off Monday and Tuesday. That's it. I am disappointed to say the very least. She mentioned something about coverage. Which is BS, we work for a global company, with offices all over the world and we're publically traded on the NYSE. They can give me more than 2 days off. Work is da poop indeed!

Hi, what would your pre-30 or pre-40 build be for fury? Thanks!
---
This dwarf walks into the tavern, and slaps yo girl's ass.
---
 What do you do?
---
They could have enough servers to disable layering.
---
Yup, there was so much cool lore that kind of just got tossed on the back burner and only sort of came out in a roundabout way through the death knights.
---
Between the soo lines building and Canadian pacific plaza
---
&gt; They didn't have layering in 2004 either.
---
And neither should they today.
---
&gt;the main guilds wont leave herod, this will be a b class server
---
I have a feeling you are correct.
---
Atlanta GROB MOB UNITE!
---
**Looking for guilds on Grobbulus!**
---
**Race:** Orc 
---
**Class/Spec:** 30/0/21 Shaman. This build makes for a solid PvE healing shaman, while allowing me to dish out good damage in PvP and provide solid off-healing as well. No mana tide totem is the biggest weak point of this build, but it's still perfectly capable of dropping windfury for a melee group that would've been unable to benefit from mana tide anyways. 
---
**Professions:** I'm most likely going to be going skinning + mining until level 60 or level 40, at which point I'll ditch skinning for engineering. 
---
**Time:** CST. Generally, I work until 8-8:30pm most days, so I'm looking for a raid team that would start at 9pm CST at the earliest.
---
  I'm 18 if you care, and have been playing WoW since around Cata. I'm looking forward to experiencing the glory days of WoW that I pretty much missed out on. My only real experience with vanilla has been leveling a character to around 50 on a private server a few months ago. 
---
I plan on playing quite a bit, and anticipate I'll probably make it to 60 in a month to a month and a half. That being said, I'm not interested in a mad dash to 60. I want to do most of the leveling dungeons, do some wPvP and participate in some RP events while leveling. Raid progression is definitely important to me, I'm looking for a 2-3 day a week guild. My first and only serious raid experience was during Legion, where I was in a heroic guild that progressed decently well. I have logs from that time that I can link you if you'd like.  I'm also interested in RP and (w)PvP, but this is already pretty long so I'll just leave it at that.
---
Wow, look, they just added even MORE realms in various regions today and classic is still 1 week away. It's almost like this was inevitable. Do you feel stupid now?
---

I'm going to try and keep my mind focused on D*CON but I know I'll be itching for classic all weekend. Leaving the Laptop at home so I don't get tempted to be anti-social.

---
As a bonus for the Grobulus gang:   
---
/run ShowHelm(not ShowingHelm())  
---
/run ShowCloak(not ShowingCloak())  
---
These two macros should toggle your helm and cloak receptively. I'm not in the beta, so I can't test them, as that functionality doesn't exist in retail due to transmogs.
---
Only time will tell
---
4:3 Gaming is hot
---
Yes I don’t like that either. I like Pilsner a lot but it took me 11 days to find one actually.
---
What I also love about Minnesota btw is how nice everyone is! Everybody’s just talking to you, asking how your day goes and that never happened to me in Germany. It actually triggered me to be nicer too, like helping strangers and stuff like that. I love it!

Awesome, thanks so much! :) I hope you have so much fun in Classic, whichever you decide to play! :D

You mean like the two new servers they just opened for NA?

How are you declaring launch a failure and it hasn’t even happened yet
---
It's truly going to feel like 2004/2005
---
I would like to see arena but instead of new gear it just gave access to the existing 60 pvp gear, or even have no rewards and be just for the thrill of the fight
---
Youre back!
---
It’s bullshit, the proof that hunter’s didn’t scale is based on pservers which is not exactly the same as vanilla.
---
Looking at actual videos of Naxx from Blizzard Vanilla I always saw hunters top in the charts. Including this world first KT
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6CNN_Cn2L2A
---
There’s also this from Purged
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6RpqjIFbQYw
---
Now look at the DPS meters you see mages and rogues, and a eventual hunter.
---
So based solely on pservers this might be true, but I don’t think it’s for Vanilla wow.
---
Yes I will roll hunter, I’ll top DPS charts, and if not it’s all fine because the class is immensely fun and immersive with the lore and RP aspect of wow.
---
Definitely no cash shop!  Even WoW retail only has a few mounts and non-combat pets for sale.  As long as you're not turned off by missing a lot of modern MMO quality of life updates, you'll love WoW. Enjoy!
---
I've done it before, I'm not going to do it again without friends to do all the work lol.
---
I am not against eventual changes several years from now.  I ***am*** against the community voting on them.
---

What do you think about 2/2 improved OP?
---
Not at all btw I wasn't talking about you playing in your car i got that, it wasn't funny. 
---
Where's your phone located at that you can just twitch a finger to press a button. I expect everyone to drive cautious and smart, undistracted, don't need my insurance rates going up because some idiot can't wait 20 mins to play a video game.
---
Strongly disagree until the high tier M+'s. Even then it is debatable due to scaling character scaling and ease of gear in retail.
---
Simple test. 
---
Can a character that has not raided in classic zombie run the dungeons? No. 
---
In retail? Yes. The exception being the higher M+'s.
---
Your point made no sense. 
---
"Elves were actually, unless you discount that elves are descendants from trolls, but then trolls don't count either"
---
Do you not see the contradiction there?
---
Unless you've made a typo you're saying that elves were there first unless you ignore their ancestors (who by definition were there first), and if you do ignore their ancestors the ancestors don't count.
---
Another one! I hope we get at least one more during the week.
---
Right on time 
---
Just released
---
Well that number was completely made up.
---
Locking the server would be catastrophic. Lot's of people would be locked out from playing with their guild/friends/family if this were the case.
---
Underrated comment.
---
i have the same setup.  just wait another month when the baby actually wants to do stuff... lol now i put the baby in a baby carrier on my chest so she can watch the computer screen lol!
---
You can't make any changes the entire player base will accept. Though Old School Runescape avoided a lot of the issue with things like that by having polls that every player over a certain level could vote in. Originally updates that didn't get 75% yes votes were scrapped. 
---
(They also released updates without polling which were typically met with anger from the community as you would expect.)
---
Where do I apply for work?
---
spitting OG knowledge. I dig.
---
I was raiding naxx at 12, not impossible
---
I must give credit to story element. It was a blast leveling for the first time on retail indeed. But second time? meh... after that, it came down to what I said before -&gt; feeling from leveling is just different. I think you are indeed in minority. You may not feel that way, because you are around people, who thinks the same way as you do. I would however be cautious when saying, millions play them. What we know so far from estimations, its under million. Again, I would love to accept leveling in retail, but it lacks the quality it had before, while gaining other qualities, that werent that important at the first place. Thats the reason, lots of players are still coming back to old games. They are not shiny but they offer game experience like no other. And hey, you are right you can outlevel your friends but guess what? You will make new ones in new zone
---
I was the raid leader for MC/ZG/most dungeons when I was 13/14, and most people didn't have a problem with it because we would clear the raids and I wasn't telling people they couldn't play ret/balance/whatever since we weren't struggling.  One warrior, who was probably the worst member of the raid in terms of doing their job, did everything he could to undermine my position as the raid leader every raid, from trying to change how gear was passed around (even though I was ML so it was going to be DKP), trying to talk over me in Vent during explanations, and throwing a tantrum when I gave the ret paladin the Blackblade of Shahram despite the warrior getting the Halberd of Smiting two days earlier.  The last two events wound up getting him perma-muted, but we still had to invite him to raids because he was related to the guild leader by marriage.
---
Eventually, the guy referred to one of our pug'd druids as an abomination from god when he found out the druid wasn't straight, and got reported by 30 something people (and gkicked) immediately.  I gave the feral his raiding spot as a show of good will, and the feral wound up getting into the Naxx raids with me something like four months later.
---
Of course you can give an opinion, can I not just explain why it's underdeveloped and lazy?
---
I listed elements of BfA that don't exist in vanilla and instead of describing how they do, u just said "no bfa bad" and got defensive for being called out for not being able to defend your position in any relevant manner
---
5 years ago they were actually a game developer.    Look at this, 
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Blizzard_Entertainment_games
---
The last game they made was overwatch, which was salvaged from the massive failure that was the titan project.  That was 3 years ago.
---
This isn't entirely true, but yeah it's generally useless.

 **If you are a harvesting alt this spell is useful. It's useful because cat form doesn't have vanish. So in higher pop beast areas (I.E. Winterspring Lotus farming) it's useful because you can only hibernate 1 target at a time.**
---
&gt;So the 60s won't have any reason to gank
---
Implying the satisfaction of killing lowbies in SVT isn't reason enough.
---
Anyone have any bets on the final number of servers come launch on the 26th?
---
Stuff like that is awesome though, creates dynamic gameplay.
---
How were the Skyways? I've not heard good things about them, although in summer it's prolly better.
---
A warrior is too similar to a rogue for me to have as an alt, Imo.  If you're going DPS warrior, you're going to have to pretty much get all of the same gear twice on two characters.  A tank I can kinda see, I just wouldn't roll two melee characters one after another personally.
---
Blizzard has gotten better about it recently. The last time launch day was a shit show was Warlords of Draenor. Legion and BFA were both smooth. Even Overwatch had a smooth launch compared to their older games.
---
I have no idea about how resource spawning worked in 1.12 and no idea how it'll work in classic. 120 was a number I pulled out of my ass to demonstrate how there won't be enough black lotuses for everyone who steps foot into MC to have 2 flasks like in the private server and old school hardcore metas.
---
The fact that you think a Private Server Client and A Classic WoW Client are the same makes me want to rip my head off.
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
You expect to be 60 in 60 hours? :P
---
They announced two more US realms 20ish minutes ago. Feel like they’ll have to keep adding more and more until we finally hit launch
---
you just need like 3-6k concurrent players for a normal population,i wouldn't worry about that.Half the people didn't resub to get their name
---
 !remindme 7 days
---
Will anybody actually move from Shazzrah though?
---
&gt; which is exactly why Blizzard plans to remove players in phase 2
---
Oh no.
---
No one wears diapers.  They piss in bottles and shit in socks
---
Check out the Immersion add-on, maybe. It makes it looks more like a dialogue in an old RPG.
---
Lmao, and here we have the conundrum.
---

It's crazy that medium is more than what original servers could hold. Though, a ton of these people are people who play retail and it costs them literally nothing to reserve characters.

And now you're back at your real name. Who would've known, GordanRamsey?

Wonder how long a "extended que" is :/
---
When I logged into the stress test, it felt like going home.
---
I was leery of all the places where I would go with impunity in “retail”. Remember the lvl 11 named wolf on that island in the middle of Iceflow Lake? I didn’t, until he unceremoniously reminded me ;)
---
That sense of “everything here can fuck you up unless you’re careful” was part of what made classic great.
---
How is this shit funny?
---
Only big streamers will make it through just like bfa
---
From Toronto me and 8 mates will be on Stalagg Horde
---
Blackrock Mountain and all it's associated dungeons/raids are an absolutely maze of epic adventure. I can't wait!
---
The thing to keep in mind is that Blizz doesn't care if you get a cool name or not. It's not a priority.
---
This is normal...

Yeah i hope they are just taking all their numbers and dividing by 3. It would be so naive to think anybody reserved only 1 name instead of 3.
---
And you have Daybreak who created everquest:
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daybreak_Game_Company
---
Z1 battle royale (never even knew it existed) - 2018 and before that.... 2012 basically, with Planetside. The vast majority of projects flopped.
---
And yet, everquest to this day is still going and generating tons of revenue. For game that is so dated, clunky, and harsh (far more than classic WoW ever will be) people still coming back and dumping money into it year after year.
---
Same thing happened to Everquest that is happening to WoW, a number of expansions were released, people weren't too interested in the game and then the developer reset the timeline on a new server, and people flocked to it. 
---
Time will tell if Blizzard will do the same, no matter how it goes, we should enjoy the journey. There are going to be some that won't enjoy Vanilla as other expansions, and that's fine. Try to show support, and show that this is the right move for Blizzard, and when it comes time for the decision to be made, do they continue the project, or can it, we need to show that it is not only financially viable, it's in their best interest.

*sigh of relief*
---
You sound like a ridiculous child right now. You posted speculation and tried to act like it was from a credible source, which of course you didn’t have. Your post also got deleted for being low effort.
---
Literally everyone knew they were going to add servers, your “prediction” is not impressive in any way.
---
Not a girl in RL. But will sure as fuck play one online for that epic mount gold and items from some sucker. Tehe.

Good point.  I’ll have to remember to advertise that.

You can save 14 characters by using a through g instead of f1 through f2 :)

Anyone ever found it strange you've got a dense evergreen Forrest (Duskwood) and a prairie adjacent (westfall) to a tropical jungle like area.
---
They're adding 2.
---
Well I like retail I’m just too lazy for the raid content atm 
---
So I’ll play classic where the mechanics are way easier while still being interesting 
---
(Even asmongold plays retail die the latest patch was pretty damn good)
---
Totally depends where you are. Could be 3 seconds, could be 15 minutes
---
Remember getting buttraped multiple times by this guy when questing there. Going horde this time so I'm dodging this and Hogger guy fortunately *hears screeching barrens harpies in the background*
---
Does no one in the EU buy stickers?
---
My group is comprised of 25 people and only 5 of us cared to reserve their names. Those servers will be hit so fucking hard on launch day. I won't be surprised if Blizzard announces new realms a couple hours after release.
---
I played wow vanilla and tbc and quited at wotlk
---
What this guy said is also how i feel playing shaman for a long time. 
---
Rogue is impossible to win if you are a tauren shaman. So go orc. If you have free action potion, you just won. Against noob rogues who dont stunlock and blind, you should be able to win.
---
Mage is actually a lot easier to win against even at high skill. The only way they can win is if they have a silence talent on their spell interrupt and use it while you are casting. The trick is to put down a grounding totem before you heal. And save your earth shocks when they start casting. Because they will hold off from casting before you shock them. It's easy to win against unless they grenade you or something and burst you. 
---
Warlocks its a loss. They beat anyone man. Hard counter indeed.
---
Hunter you just have to stay within their range and avoid trying to do any casting because of knockback. You have to outburst them as quick as possible. I recommend putting down a earthbind when near so pet is slowed and hunter is slowed at the same time. 
---
Paladin you wreck face with. Their attacks dont match your damage output.
---
Priest, especially shadow priest, is a very even matchup. Most of the time you win if you can outburst them in the first half of the fight. But if they put all their dots on you, you lose because they get healing from it. I recommend stunning them with a nade at the beggining to give you a chance to burst with a chain lightning. 
---
Warrior is also a very even fight. If they are noob geared, you win easily. But a warlord warrior vs a warlord shaman, its very even. You cant cast them though, they will just keep silencing you. Just keep refreshing lightning shield and casting your shock. You rely on your defense holding back their dps while your dps kills them first. Very simple. Its more favorable towards the shaman if you got a shield on.
---
Easy when they’re babies lol
---
Means you should get photoshop
---
What do you mean “forsaken server?”
---
&gt; #INTRAST YE ON A ~~PINT~~FIGHT
---
I think the big question is will we as players welcome for example an expansion or do we all want to stick to level 60.  
---
Maybe they can just downgrade all the dungeons from TBC to level 60, would think with all the experience they have now it would not be that hard to do?
---
The damage is already done most people won’t leave Shazzrah!
---
Bunch of sword rogues though trying to backstab vael with a sword spec, not really too surprising. As daggers on a pserver i was ahead of the warriors on basically every fight in molten core using barman shanker pre raid, and once i got perditions the difference became larger. Same goes for vanilla raiding when i played wow for the first time. I never saw warriors start to do near top dps until around naxx and even then they were still not topping the meters.
---
I actually didn't think too much about that last fact that's a really good point. All of these servers are full of accounts with three characters that will be playing 1 on release. Idc who you are no one has time for alts in classic until a few weeks/months in.
---
I found the blue post, I was off by a few years.
---
"In our hardware testing we found that we were able to successfully run WoW Classic on systems manufactured and released in the 2007-2009 timeframe, and thanks to improvements in how we build and distribute game data, the hard drive space requirements are actually smaller than they were in version 1.12 of original WoW."
---
But will this save Herod?
---
Yep, and then we'll probably split so me and my wife both work 50% + 5 weeks vacation until the daycare start september 2020...
---
Did I mention I also get to keep about 70 % of my salary? (It's actually 80 % but im stretching out the days to be able to be home even longer)
---
Burn it!
---
Formatted
---
&gt; The existing PvP realms all now have either a Full or High population tag. With the potential for extended queues on the Full realms, and 10,000+ queues on Herod, we are opening two new PvP realms on Monday, August 19 at 6:00 p.m. PDT: 
---
&gt; * Blaumeux – PvP – Pacific Time Zone 
---
&gt; * Skeram – PvP – Eastern Time Zone 
---
&gt; We urge players on PvP realms to consider moving to one of these realms. Doing so will help spread the player population as evenly as possible before launch and provide the best play experience for everyone.
---
"We urge players on PvP realms to consider mobing to one of these realms." 
---
That's a funny way of saying we fucked up by underestimating the demand for classic and should have announced way more servers to begin with.
---

I wish there was a checkbox you could check to include the dungeon quests.  Its fun, gear upgrades, part of the experience etc.
---
if they knew what they were doing they wouldnt have to be begging players, over and over, to xfer off their overpopulated realms
---
Any morning raid guilds on grob?

Time is the biggest loss for almost all games. Tangible items equate to lost time as well, but is typically a much harder pill for a player to swallow.
---
Mankrik master server
---
Play hunter you'll be fine
---
The problem that I have is that everything becomes about your rotation.  For the most part, the only choice you have is "single target or aoe".  Once you learn your rotation, that's basically all you do.
---
Now, I know it's not a "rotation" anymore, but rather a priority queue.  But once you learn where everything is in the queue, the entire game becomes about how well you can manage that queue, not about any strategic choices you can make.
---
And for the majority of the game, failure means you're less fast, compared with live where failure means you die.  There are no "bad" spells to cast.  Only "less efficient" spells.  (Whereas if you arcane explosion next to a sap and a polymorph, that was a bad spell to cast in Vanilla).
---
You have to understand there's a pecking order and just looking at the raw facts...a Boomerkin does maybe half of what a mage does damage wise so why the fuck give them a 2% hit SP stat stick trink? They'll still do terrible and by terrible I mean absolutely dog shit. Even super casual guilds will realize how fucked that actually is
---
Confirmed: Playing WoW Classic makes you a successful, millionaire actor and you look like a Greek god to boot! 
---
No reason to not play now. See y’all in about a week!
---
That’s the route I would prefer.
---
They’re still going to be locked out if Blizzard is being honest with their predictions of 15,000-20,000 player ques.
---
Yeah I linked wrong one, it was suppose to have mortal strike. That build is for tanking easy things like ubrs and even off tank lesser things in mc but still be able to pvp with ms.

---
She is generally not so fond of gaming, but wanted to try something new to see if she can get into it :)
---
2 weeks? Just checking, but what day do you think Classic launches?
---
Move on to what? My point is that they are expecting a severe drop off in players that may not occur. I’ve already moved my reservations to stalag, but even that looks to be full before launch even. I would gladly move to a new server. I think they are underestimating how many servers will be needed. This is an added headache for any guild since it is much more difficult to get everyone to hop from server to server.
---
In my experience ganking will happen for sure in p1 still but when you add an incentive to gank you attract everybody and not just that 10% of the playwrbase who will kill for no rewards
---
I leveled and played a shaman from patch 1.8 thru to TBC.  The class has a ton of flavor what with the totems and totem quests.  Coming from war3 it was also the quintessential horde class for me.  Lots of versatility made soloing pretty easy.  
---
One thing I remember with surprising clarity was I was around level 44 and I got a new 1h mace but had no skill in it.  I popped rockbiter and just wailed on some gorillas in Feralas.  Took a while but I got the skill capped and never dies because of those sweet sweet self heals.
---
Also beastly in PvP, Windfury with an Unatoppable for a was fun.  Max proc and I was 1 shotting clothies.
---
Steaks, water, and coffee.
---
Omg those key binds make me want to vomit
---
I hope they move out of the fucking game entirely.
---
Your post is hard to make sense of, are you saying all ages festivals are less tolerable because they have young people in them, and that older crowds can be hard to tolerate but they aren't as bad as an actual child crowd?
---
Do not let the fact that these servers are new scare you away from switching to them. The fact is that more than 50% of people are still not subbed to WoW Classic yet and do not have a server home. I swap to Stalagg the day it was opened and now it's up to a high server pop. I do not intend on switching unless it reaches full status before next week.
---
Cook, thanks!
---
Me and you would get along
---
~~dead~~ full server

FTFY
---
Who cares! We're all already on the Skalagg train!

Yeah I don't understand why have queues at all if there's layering?

I remember being a new player and a quest told me to go up towards some hill to find something. I open my map and it's completely blank. Gee thanks quest for telling me to find something on this blank map
---
I would 100% move to a CST PVP server.
---
The fastest way to kill classic is to create too many servers! This is why we have layering. People need to be patient. A small queue is the perfect scenario. It means the realm is at max capacity. Ideally everyone logging in would see a 5 to 10 person queue before getting onto the realm. Of course queues will be higher than that on launch but after people quit when they realize they need to read quests the realms should free up significantly.
---
Norwegians - We move now. No more Shazz 10k queue.
---
She wants to be a druid! So that's perfect, she doesn't want to be a dedicated healer though, but it's helpful to have that backup
---
This is the most Hype of ever seen geared towards WoW since Wrath of The Lich King announcement.
---
Feels like the damage already is done tbh!
---
SoC is like 28% of your white damage (40% proc for 70% damage)
---
Assuming you're doing 80 white DPS at level 46, that's 22-30 SoC DPS (30 cause it ignores damage.) - so it's 3 DPS increase to SOC.
---
12DPS &gt; 3 DPS
---
A lot of people were making a huge deal about Thalnos being a no-go zone because it was flooded with non-English speakers, which if you look in my other comments (I don't expect anyone to, it's okay) I talk about how that really isn't the case and even if there are, it's not going to be much worse than other servers. 
---
Plus, server diversity isn't a bad thing. It was just really bad xenophobia that blew way out of proportion for no reason.
---
Yep!
---
Play retail; get gold; buy sub time.
---
Go to work and then attempt to log in as I get home since I’m EST I’ll get home about 30 minutes before it opens
---
I don't think you'd be able to tank without a prot build, you can do ok healing regardless, as long as you have some healing gear.
---
I agree if it’s your first time but I’ve played 1-60 vanilla so much that now I am into speefrunning and optimizing my 15 years of knowledge. It’s a blast
---
Awesome, that's about enough to add some flavor to the dice description!

Oh I never doubt the truth of the world is much worse off than I can imagine. Though in BFA graphics defense. They do scale them down very well for potatoes. Though updated graphics are never put there with the people with potatoes in the front of the devs mind.
---
Thanks for answering.
---
There are a few people asking for that on this reddit too, maybe they've found it
---
No devs literally said in 2005 that classic is for casuals. Every mmo before was hardcore.
---
This is not my opinion, this is what the devs said.
---
Geralt !
---
&gt;To reduce queue times and have no competition in starting zones. Acti-Blizz has clearly failed their original goal.
---
That wasn't the point of layering.
---
The point of layering was to prevent server merging, and dead servers 6 months down the road.
---
The benefits to starting zones was merely happy side effect.
---
He has seen some shit man.
---
How did you draw that conclusion? They said that existing pvp realms all have a High or Full tag
---
Anytime!
---
&gt;it’s probably 30% slower. So 130 hours on a warrior.
---
Lol bruh what dream world do you live in where the average /played to 60 is 100 hours
---
do you have the link by chance?
---
Lol! Got me! I'm Holy but fair point 😂
---
And 1/4 of the people... so if you scaled it, would be nearly 16 million hp. DPS in WotLK capped around 18-20k. Best stuff i've seen here saying 2k or so for Fury Warriors. It was a much easier fight in Wrath.. but still not easy. Lots of wipes on him early into the game. It's hard to compare since Naxx was the first raid in wrath but the last raid in vanilla. Better to compare to ICC....
---
You press one button and it scans the entire AH, calculates costs and profits, decides when and what to buy, decides how much to list items for, and much more.  It requires no decision making or though on the users part, the "input" is limited to clicking the same button over and over.
---
&gt;People know of Herods issues.
---
I guess that's the key difference in opinion, then. I don't think that most people creating new characters will know that Herod is overpopulated.
---
&gt;Idk why people still don't understand that only a small amount of the player base created characters.
---
Also only a small amount of the player base reads forums. Most people have not put any special thought into servers at all. They'll launch the game when it comes out and pick a non-full server (unless they want to tolerate queues to be on a popular server, in which case they'll pick a full server at random). Or, on the day of launch, they ask their friends which server they're playing on and go there (and since Herod is the most populated server, it has the highest chance of being the one their friends are on, so even more people pile in).
---
&gt; Question: Is there a way in WoW Classic to achieve what I want (see above) with a single talent build.
---
No, but you're a lot better off healing in a tank build, than tanking in a healing build
---
Do a search in the fairbanks sub, it's come up more than a few times. If you look through my posts, you'll see I've poked fun at it a few times before.
---
Same here...priest, paladin or lock
---
&gt;the people I play with are the whole reason I play.
---
Same.. which is why the whole process has been so frustrating for me.
---
I need a Fear Ward stat.
---
Everyone is different. It's quite possible you will prefer retail. Only one way to find out
---
Yes, until a few expansions in when they destroyed the scope of the world by adding portals to every location and a central hub to access them all.

Not great if you want to get a quick run in, haha.

This makes sense to me
---
You can run automatic checks on price points, auto buy them, auto sell them at certain rates, monitor spending trends and cost of mats for consumables/equipment, etc.
---
If you wanted to run the AH like it's your full time job, this is the addon to use.
---
There are PVP exclusive guilds, and RP exclusive guilds, it depends on whatever the players want to do.
---
RPPVP is more flexible than RP with regards of RPing, that's pretty much the only  difference.
---

---
Where my Skeram homies at?
---
I'd laugh if I saw a warrior named Fighterguy. Am 30. Do like.
---
Playing a spec "because you like it" and hurting the 39 other members while expecting loot is selfish behavior. as a ret you pvp only, you respec holy in pve. If you dont like enjoy being in greens or being stuck 2 raids behind progression. No one wants to bring a selfish player to the raid. Do you really think everyone who heals in a raid wants to be? Every class can dps and most people would prefer too. If you wont make the sacrifice to heal i can almost guarantee you someone will take your raid spot
---
You can level to 110 with just a subb you do not need BFA.
---
&gt; you must think poorly of the playerbase
---
Bingo.
---
Players make shit devs we can tell blizzard what we like and don't like but giving the playerbase any kind of real control would be absolutely moronic.
---
Not long at all for new players, but a huge chunk of the folks that have made characters there already will stay for one reason or another. I imagine most of the people who are gonna play the second the game launches are those who've reserved a name but that's only an educated guess.
---
Blaumeux!  That was my Stress Test Server! WOO HOO! but it seems to be converted from RP PVP To PVP now.  So sad how the great have fallen.

Nah man, all these tens of thousands of people just think they do so bad, they are paying ahead of time to reserve their names, all the queues next Monday will really be to cancel their sub.

Your humor is sufficient
---
I actually prefer to be able to stop leveling to do some BGs and such. Doesn't hurt that gear is available from it as well. Most of my alts will probably grow up in/after the pvp phase.
---
“All those moments lost in time”
---
&gt; They all work on retail. 
---
Thank you. I asked that because I know that Classic uses the retail macro system, and old Vanilla macros don't work anymore.
---
No it doesn't.
---
You spoke too soon
---
Once you get in you can switch between your characters without going back in queue :)
---
It's a simultaneous global launch. It comes out on the 26th and the 27th depending on what time zone you're in.
---
Personally the extreme corpse runs in vanilla WoW are a great negative consequence. They can take up to 15-20 minutes in some zones and you have the option to take a large repair bill and rez sickness to avoid them. Exp/gold losses just make it so that I don't try to push my boundaries and new things and end up just playing super boring/safe gameplay.
---
I know realm name doesn't matter personally i don't care about the name but if they really want people to switch they should name a server like hogger or something.
---
Spend $4 to reserve a name you will use for the next 2 years? No thank you.
---
I bet you didn't blink twice at &lt;random impulse purchase of a physical good that will last 1 week and you didn't really need&gt; thouh.
---
Shazz h
---
That's a part of it but remember lvl 40 isn't even half way in your levelling, so for about 55% of the game everyone has the same travel speed from mount.
---
It’s a server for the people who loves to waste their time in a queue and dream about killing Ragnaros during the first week.
---
Yep last thing Blizz wants is dead realms. They could have 100 realms per region if they wanted but then when the drop off happens they will be left with 80 low pop realms and that leads to a feeling in the server that players are alone. Player then leave because there is no one to play with. Then Blizz has to merge servers just like they did in retail.
---
Yup. She kinda needs to fail on her own and learn from it I feel like. That's how most people start, no?
---
Good thing that's not the point then. It's to not have servers die
---
You do ***not*** need a subscription to install. 
---
Initially I didn't have the option to install classic, but i did get it to work eventually, without a sub. Try starting installation of retail Wow, let it run for a moment, then stop it, restart the launcher, there should be a drop-down menu now where you can choose Classic.
---
You can install Classic without installing retail at all.
---
Once you're logged in, you shouldn't face additional queues when switching characters.
---
So how about a PM?
---
New server won't be dead.. all the people subbing specifically for classic will end up on the newest, non-full server.
---
Maybe he got that idea from all the blizzdrones using it as a talking point for 3 months to defend layering.
---
The undead racial for PvP.
---
IMO, wrath is right in the middle in terms of retail vs classic. 
---
at this point, classic and retail are entirely different games with different goals. 
---
If you played during early wrath, classic will feel more familiar.
---
WoW and FFXIV are very different games in similar genres. Leveling, alts, combat, professions, endgame, pvp are all very different.
---
You can like Classic and Retail. They're not mutually exclusive.
---
My biggest concern now is, what the hell am I going to read at work the week *after* Sept 9th...
---
Yes!! I’ve been looking for some good “lore” content to really dive into. You’re doing gods work 😂
---
You can go arms and not take one of the weapon specs. There are other talents.
---
I hate layering but 100% dead servers in 6 months without it.
---
Respect for him just increased 100x

For you guys at work:

"The existing PvP realms all now have either a Full or High population tag. With the potential for extended queues on the Full realms, and 10,000+ queues on Herod, we are opening two new PvP realms on Monday, August 19 at 6:00 p.m. PDT:
---
We urge players on PvP realms to consider moving to one of these realms. Doing so will help spread the player population as evenly as possible before launch and provide the best play experience for everyone."

I've noticed a lot of complaints about paladins lately, with regard to their low dps and limited combat options. But what players are forgetting is the main reason Blizzard programmed Paladins. Paladins were not designed to be hybrid Tanks/Healers, as many claim. Instead, paladins were designed to be played while downloading pornography.
---
Paladins have roughly zero combat interaction, thus making them the perfect character to play while downloading massive amounts of hardcore pornography. Simply target a monster, hit "1", and minimize your window. Then sit back and enjoy the amazing girl on girl action.
---
Because a Paladin takes about one full minute to kill any monster, you can leisurely browse the erotic and pornographic fruits of the internet without much concern over your Paladin's welfare. After a minute, I go back to WoW, and usually my Paladin is alive and ready to loot the corpse. This is what makes grinding so pleasurable and convenient for me; the ability to simultaneously watch girls have sex with each other and level up at the same time. I doubt any other class has such an elegantly designed system, and I applaud Blizzard for their foresight in crafting a character that I can play with while playing with myself.
---
DPS? Who needs it? The quicker I kill something, the less time I have to watch boobies. Combat Interactivity? Overrated. I'd much rather interact with the girls writhing on my computer screen. Yes, a paladin was created for the sole purpose of surviving a fight while you stream hot pornography directly to your computer. That is why we have the high armor class, healing abilities, and the low, low DPS.
---
As for PvP, nothing is better than getting into Battlegrounds and soaking up the honor points while I watch girls take their clothes off for money. Only the minimum interaction is necessary for a Paladin to perform, and it is this very quality that I love the most about my Paladin. I doubt Rogues get any time to watch pornography while trying to vanish and rack up combo points, and I bet Shamans haven't seen a single naked breast while figuring out which totem to throw down before choosing which shock they are going to cast next.
---
In addition to grinding, we have several defensive options during combat that also allow us the flexibility of downloading pornography. Hammer of Justice allows a quick 6 second glimpse at a naked lady while our opponent is stunned, and Divine Shield allows a leisurely 8 seconds of quality right-hand time. Indeed, Paladins have cornered the market on the pornography during playtime of World of Warcraft gameplay.
---
It saddens me that many Paladins do not take advantage of the main functionality of your character, and are in fact lobbying for increased DPS, or more combat options. These are all unnecessary frivolities that would only harm our pornography downloading efficiency. Instead, we should thank the fine programmers at Blizzard for crafting a character that is great to grind with while grinding your loins.
---
noo? Its integrated mobile graphics
---
Probably 6-8h
---
Well it sure does to me.  Haven't felt this much like a single player game in an mmo since I played swtor.
---
Lets see people have been playing private servers with no or minimal changes for how many years now?
---
Because they want to remove layering for phase 2 and beyond. They could have everyone on one “server” across hundreds of layers, but then they would never be able to remove layering.
---
“You think you do, but you don’t”
---
I once leveled a troll mage to ~40 and deleted it because I would rather be an UD mage.  My friend flipped the fuck out when I told him that.
---
This is fucking great
---
He said hardly, not no.
---
6pm Eastern Time next Monday August 26th.
---
Yeah, retail is trash. Became trash late Wraith/ Early Cata. FFIV is trash. It's all trash but Vanilla. My "non-bias" opinion XD
---
Which was fine.
---
Sounds like you never understood the point of layering to begin with, it's wild how people still can't grasp it
---
You should rename this "MY FIRST PVP kill in history of WOW" because this is NOT the first kill ever, there were many non-recorded ones, it's a bit pretentious of you to claim such a feat like you actually got it.
---
\&gt; Breath: Have you tried swimming under water for a long time? Yeah your character is actually really fucking good at it! Hes a badass even, but he won't last forever (unless you're a filthy undead, then yeah, who needs oxygen!) 
---
Classic Druid+swim form+imp nature's grasp = nobody tries to pvp with druids near water.  
---
I've only seen it work twice, but it's beyond hilarious when the guy your kiting follows you down and doesn't wonder why that swimming-feral-beaver-thing isn't outdistancing him ... until he hits it, and is entangled for 27 seconds deep underwater.  Then you just swim about 10y away and watch him die.
---
Undead looks better. Will of the forsaken and cannibalism are quite good in pvp.
---
Retail is a fucking travesty compared to how fun it used to be, and no, that's not nostalgia talking.
---
Damn, good for him.
---
They are beginning to believe
---
World PvP because there's no flying.
---
Farming because gold has more value, tons more BIS BOE recipes.
---
Farming dungeons for BIS recipes.
---
Farming for consumables(TBC was food + flask and on use pots so very limited farming compared to vanilla).
---
Just to name a few things.
---
I quit my job. Last day on saturday XD classic here I come baby!
---
mr powertripper at it again, wonder how long it'll last this time.
---
\#SkeramSquad
---
Thank you!  It’s a ton of work but there’s so much to talk about!  Looking forward to getting more out there for you all! Spread the word! Thank you again!
---
It’s good for wetlands croc avoidance.
---
His videos scratch the classic itch really well for me. I watch them pretty religiously.
---
what im kinda curious about is did gehannes fill up with switchers or just new players
---
For an MMORPG wow classic is hands down the better experience if that's what you're looking for. Retail wow is less of an RPG. It's not even a matter of what is "better" but rather which type of game you enjoy and currently there are very few or even no games that offer what classic once did.
---
#Band of the Red Hand is a Horde guild recruiting for Classic launch on Grobbulus RP-PvP!
---
###About Us
---
&gt; PvE Focus, No RP Rules/Expectations, PvP/BG Premades when available.
---
&gt; Guild core are RL friends who have raided and lead guilds since Vanilla.
---
&gt; Respect for others is a given.  We like to have fun and aren't a _clean language_ group by any means, but we will not tolerate extreme negativity or hate.
---
&gt; Open to most Class/Spec combinations but we do expect you know how to play it or be willing to ask questions.
---
###Membership
---
&gt; We're looking for good people of any experience level.
---
&gt; New to the game and looking for a friendly environment?  Let us teach you!
---
&gt; Experienced and looking for a chill place to make friends?  Come on by!
---
&gt; Want to be a leader and train the newer generation in Classic?  Join up!
---
&gt; If you are simply looking for a group of people to hang out with and run 5-mans with, we'd love to have you.
---
###Goals
---
&gt; Our primary goal is to recapture the magic of Vanilla and have some fun!
---
&gt; Our 60 day/Phase 1 goal is getting to 60, running guild groups while working towards pre-raid BiS gear and completing attunements.
---
&gt; After that, we do not expect to be a cutting-edge progression guild, but we will clear Ony/MC/BWL regularly by Phase 3.
---
###Raids &amp; Loot
---
&gt; We are adults with jobs, lives, families and do not expect 100% attendance or participation.
---
&gt; Raid times are TBD but likely later in the evenings (8P+ CST).
---
&gt; Loot will be handled with some form of decaying DKP including Effort Points and Loot Council pre-determined decisions for key items such as MT gear.
---
###Contact
---
&gt; PM me on Reddit: [u/IneffableTao](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=IneffableTao) or Discord Kurok#3671
---
&gt; Or our Guild Leader on Reddit: [u/zweih_](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=zweih_) or Discord zweih#6780

---
Following the Tauren guide, we're told to turn in "Crossroads Conscription", but it didn't say to pick it up.
---
!Remindme 2 weeks
---
This is what I did whenever I planned on doing some world pvp while leveling, imp hamstring proc is pretty nice at times
---
The worst=10mil subs
---
Lets assume 10k pop per server im nice today
---
Thats 1000 servers needed thats why u dont prepare for the worst and ads servers Organically like me and blizzart
---
We should make an Atlanta based guild. Resurgens.
---
Almost exactly like mine except I have the neck beard with no mustache so I can see his beautiful smile.
---
Yeah that's true! Either way glad for classic to come back and have something fun to do with friends again.
---
I remember thinking, ‘but I’m not done with the content yet... Can I just get the expansion later?’
---
My friends still laugh to this day...
---
unironically, yeah that's pretty crazy. i actually just downvote the overall post... its such a huge waste of time to downvote all of your comments lol
---
Nothing like having your scrap book of mount skins to console you. I’m clearly just wrong then.
---
I think that is a very good idea so that people will know when classic will release when they click on some random ass dudes discord name.
---
It is already way over the initial Vanilla population.
---
Thanks for the great respone Shiqznima!
---
As one of those players, ya.
---
Waiting for a scholmance tank at 3am when you’ve already been waiting for 2 hours 
---
So bad it’s good
---
&gt; Is retail WoW really that bad? 
---
I can live with the queues!

haha no we wont move! We are going to stay with the original plan and stay on Gehennas. It has worked out perfectly, no big nation has claimed Gehennas besides us so that part of population is spread out! We also manage to get some of the bigger known guilds from the vanilla scene to join the server aswell which is great. Also these past days the finnish guilds have started to join and thats really awesome.
---
Dude I don't think you understand, it doesn't bother me. I'll spend that time talking in guild chat generally, asking for help if it's happened more than a couple times. If it's a long run I'll have some music or YouTube on. It's part of the game and it's a good challenge to overcome. 
---
If I wanted an easy life id play retail. 
---
Also, lol at you assuming what I do and don't remember.
---
Yeah I'd sub a day or two before. Just in case their sub service crashes or something.

Curious to hear how you are balancing all that. I'm 30 with 2 kids under 3, and my wife has a very demanding career and mine is going more in that direction as well. Already struggling to get enough sleep and fitting everything in and at night after the kids are in bed im just to mentally drained to do much other than watch tv
---
Didn't they have this amazing tech called layering to avoid ques? lmao
---
And in WoW's predecessors it was 15m run PLUS 30m-60m worth of XP loss.  Dying was a big no-no  :D
---
The game hasnt even launched to the general population yet. Stop speculating for a fucking week and enjoy the game.
---
Because they don't have the skill to fight someone their own level.
---
Except they also want us to switch pff herod, so if they want people to switch it should be priority
---
I remember in EQ beta when if you won a duel you got to take a piece of the opponent's gear...your choice. That game was so hardcore.
---
Trying to be proactive but if you have a large group you need to h e 75% on board or it’s not going to work.
---
Don't spend your time apologizing. Spend your time finding the 'print screen' key.
---
Nah I don't have nicknames in servers for that sole purpose
---
GoT quality production would be amazing.
---
My favorite rares are the ones with unique loot, back in vanilla there was one in EPL that I would farm to sell on the AH.
---
Where is the love ;(
---
We got 3.
---
1 EN PvP, 1 German PvP and 1 German PvE.
---
It's just the beginning. More realms are coming, EU , NA , China.
---
I could be completely wrong, but based on my own experience, I think it's actually a majority of the playerbase.
---
I didn’t even think about with the increased spawns, that’ll be horrible lol
---
You know it!
---
I always underestimate my assumptions until proven metrics.
---
I was just explaining the name of a cat in a HP Lovecraft book. =/
---
Well I respecced a few times to play around and then abandoned my char at level 55 just cuz I didn't feel like finishing the grind with Classic coming out soon. I'll just describe what I generally did or would recommend.  
---
I was on a PVP server which, for me, made me want to go Arms for Tac mastery to help in PVP. First 5 points into fury for +5% crit, then arms until level 40.  Ignore improved HS, get improved overpower, and just for leveling Impale isn't as good as it sounds as until level 40 it only impacts overpower or heroic strike (or whirlwind at level 36).  Do your best to get Whirlwind Axe (class quest) around level 30 when it becomes available.  Don't be afraid to ask for help, especially for the farming in Arathi or STV.  And bring a friend or two for the final part "Cyclonian".  Then the last points can be put into sweeping strikes, parry, axe spec, and imp hamstring for a PVP-focused build. 
---
Level 40 arms- https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LVGxdhVo0u
---
Personally though I was on a PVP server I was more interested in doing PVE / solo grinding on the way to 60 so I respecced at 40 to this, level 40 2h Fury:
---
level 40 Fury  https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LZE0zA0xoVo
---
I put future points into Arms to get Tact mastery, anger management, and other relevant PVE talents so at 60 I would look like this. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LMhxdhbZE0zAMxoVo
---
This was for a non-PVP, solo playstyle with the occasional dungeon tanking.  I used a BOE 2h epic mace at 47 which was perfect for this build, Taran Icebreaker https://classicdb.ch/?item=2915
---
It is extremely fast for a 2h, but this actually works quite well with Fury PVE spec as you get more bloodthirst procs, attack speed bonus from flurry is nutty attacking quicker than 2.0 speed with a 2h weapon, and personally I think a fast weap is preferable for PVE because the impact of a "Miss" is much less than if you have that big 3.8 speed honker. 
---
I was a monster in solo play, getting a ton of hp regen through bloodthirst, blood craze, bandages between fights, and hp/5 consumables (cooking food and alch potion, both pretty cheap).  I also tended to farm a lot so I had extra gold, made sure to buy a few gear upgrades occasionally to keep my char very strong.  I made my $$ selling cooking food and alch potions on the AH as well as just farming for skins, grey drops, etc.  Had plenty for a mount at 40 and ample leftover. 
---
Tanking was easy too, bloodthirst and blood craze actually generate some AOE threat from the self-healing, and battle shout/demo shout also gets AOE threat so it wasn't hard to just mark a focus target and keep threat on most of hte group. 
---
At 40, respec to the the 31 point talent.  If you want to PVP at all do Arms as the talents are way better.
---
Nah I don't have nicknames on servers for that reason
---
The raids in retail are extremely good. I personally think the lore has gone south since WOD but it’s a personal opinion. I used to be obsessed with WoW lore but it’s died down for me.
---
I realized I just prefer a world that feels larger than I am with mysteries and whatnot. Not going to Argus and fighting titans, etc. A dragon is cool enough for me ;P
---
Does anyone know the correct pronunciation of Skeram? '
---
Is it: 
---
"Scare - em" 
---
"Ska - rahm" 
---
"Sah - key - ruhm"
---
Something else lol?
---
I feel like you've never seen a "Blizzard Release" before. Nothing has EVER gone smoothly.....
---
Different strokes for different folks. MoP was my favorite expansion! 😁
---
Can confirm
---
We did it Bloodsail Buccaneers!  We might be the onyl reasonable server with a long term community and shorter launch queues!
---
Stamina is not very good for Warriors at all though. Who would use this lol
---
did u just pull that our your asshole

Man up, carebear

---
You can tank anything as arms/ fury.
---
No, you probably don't, I agree.
---
Still, 60 5-mans are not a joke, and if your healer is equally badly equipped, you need a lot of CC and group discipline to get through without going mad, and it's gonna be slow. 
---
My personal plan is leveling as Fury/Arms, respeccing to prot at 60 until I have most of my pre-BiS, and then once raids start spec to Fury. Then I should also have the gear to tank 5-mans in DPS-spec without making my healer and DPS criy.
---
You're the dev itself?
---
Ah man, I reserved a name on Herod, then moved it to Whitemane because I thought it was safe, now I need to find another realm? :(
---
Confirmed : GMs on standby in Barrens to assist in reducing server population.
---
its not even right. Enjoy having no money at 40.
---
There are 3 PvE realms sitting on High, nudge some more in there and sure.
---
They'll always be the Right Elves to me.
---
Yes, you are the tank.  You are in charge of marking targets and telling each cc member who they are going to cc.  If you wait until the pull is started to do CC, you are risking dots or cleave hitting the CC targets.  The CC goes first, then the tank pulls the pack off the person doing the CC is how I recall all pulls going in later dungeons.
---
Jaina is a boss now? What the fuck happened to WoW lore?
---
Same! His race/class guide for Classic was sooo helpful and informative! 😁
---
Just give me SWG Classic ...
---
If you make it past the 6k mark you’re ahead of the curve
---
is it Scare-em / Ski-ram
---
It's like something my mother used to make. Looks so great and tastes like abused animals.
---
Our main tank in Vanilla was in his 60's, I got transferred from Shore Duty back to Sea Duty right before WOTLK and RealID was a thing, when I finally came back I was told he transferred servers after our guild fell apart, haven't seen him since and wonder if he's doing ok, dude was super chill.
---
I switched to Whitemane. All my names, stuck too. Thank you everyone for your input!!!

You have 7 days to really discuss it to be real unless you are fussed on a name.

You can download via Twitch app but it's still clunky when you have an addon suitable for classic and retail, where it updates the classic version to retail. So until they fix that I'd recommend doing manually.

k
---
WotLK is the last decent expansion, in my opinion. Vanilla is a different beast... You may not be accustomed to the lack of convenience.
---
&gt;play by herself when your not home, chances are she doesn't want to play the game, she just wants to spend time with you. Try to encourage her to play by herself and to really get into it, even if your not there. That will be the true test to see if she 
---
Nice tip! To actually have her play alone, that's the key :P Thanks!
---
I would estimate about 80%+ of people that plan on playing haven't subbed yet. Most people don't care that much about getting a name and aren't currently playing retail.
---
Ehhh. Thanks I’ll just keep doing it like this, much faster for me.
---
Extended what?
---
You have it backwords it looks like.
---
1. The journey to 60 is more slow and mundane. The onus is on the player to make it fun, not like in BFA where you can que hop all the way up.
---
2. The vanilla endgame content is the hardest endgame content of all expansions. That feeling of accomplishment you have now in BFA raids will be 10 fold.
---
Looking for NA or EU guild (English). Horde or Alliance. PVP servers only. Playtimes are 1230pm-730pm EST and 530pm-1230am BST weekdays 3-4 hour slot, very flexible weekends. Only played BFA for about 5 months, no other WoW experience. Very willing to learn and sink a lot time in along side an active guild.

I really dont like that answer Olaf, please reconsider your attitude ok
---
Can't win an argument w/o resorting to calling the other person stupid....
---
I got your points they were very basic and poor to begin with, I refuted them easily, and now you can't muster up a real response.
---
I am reporting you as it is against the rules on the sub, gl hf, glad i'll never have to read another one of your comments. I am Still thinking about all the people you claim that died around you from looking at their phone for a slit-second, truly a disgusting remark to make, what kind of person makes stuff like that up for a Reddit argument.
---
yesss finally 
---
nice orc btw
---
1 callback would be fair too
---
Anecdotal of course, but me and my discord of like ~15 are all not subbed but will be for Classic. But yeah that is not factual in the least LOL
---
Yeah I know what you mean when I said I liked current raids because you're fighting against these people you have history with.  The motivation is there.  I remember when doing dungeons Azshara would taunt me in dungeons and to finally fight her is fun.  Ive done lich king dungeons but not the raid and it must've been great seeing lich king taunt you at the end of every dungeon and then to finally fight him.  I've also seen Garrosh hellscream a few times and hes entertaining.  Unfortunatley I wasnt there for MoP so I never go tot experience such an epic battle.
---
I saw that. And another EU server, too. I bet we get a few more to choose from in the coming weeks.
---
I swear momo is the scariest thing ever
---
Night Elves didn't evolved naturally either. They got mutated by Well of Eternity.
---
I'm wondering if it would be faster to just buy one off players at launch as I think there will be plenty of people making and selling?
---
Mining mats I would be stockpiling for engi so wouldn't make money off it until later. Good advice about the copper around Barrens and Durator though.
---
Yeah, I feel the old models are a necessity for it being Classic. You can clean those models up, higher textures, etc, but the art shouldn't change.
---
because 0.3 on Herod when all you did was take the name Asmongold without ever intending to play on Herod but hoping to score ransom isn't smart. Recording characters created and reporting that as the server's popularity is their best course of action because it does give the community a rough sense of how popular each server will be and also inflates the public perception of how popular Classic will be in general, triggering some FOMO and causing people to sub. I believe that last part is true because a week ago half the servers were low pop, now there's only two medium and the rest are high / full. Point here is that people are definitely subbing after day 1 of naming, which is weird because at that point you're late to the race
---
Superman is ready.
---
Damn you're insufferable
---
The launcher is currently advertising classic. Also the ads seem to be dotted around social media. Maybe the ads aren't targeting you hard enough :)
---
Hey I remember originally rolling a  night elf because I thought 1% dodge passive would he game breaking down the line.
---
If you guys want to listen to WoW Music and Ambience you should check out Everness on youtube. He makes hour long playlists for each zone and dungeon based on their modern versions. I think I remember him saying that he might redo some of them for classic though. 
---
https://youtu.be/MW4fASDkQXA

His Elwynn video.
---
Yeah..  Guessing you have not raided either the newer stuff or classic stuff to say that.
---
Ye. Latest update on the site (http://nordicclassic.jinnis.se/) have shown that many guilds who were first hesitant on the move are now with it again. 
---
And since so many didnt wanna move from Shazzrah and it still filled up.. we ended up doing a great fucking move I reckon! :D (Im Feltrast not Bizzno but yea)
---
not really, the raids are basically tunnels, UBRS is pretty straight forward too.
---
LBRS and even more BRD are the convoluted ones
---
I would agree with this. I haven’t been subbed in well over a year and was not to concerned with subbing early just for a name
---
Oh man, this is funny but people must have been so worried lol
---
Lol! Classic
---
A good realm name might give incentive for Herodites to leave Herod.
---
There's a reason Herod and Whitemane are the highest pop servers atm in NA.
---
How could you possibly know if they are prepared for it? Launch hasn’t even happened yet. How is that hard to understand? 
---
Servers hit high/full, they add more. Why would they add them if they weren’t filling up?
---
I made the mistake of making a similar joke about my pretty Kylo Ren poster once, but as I'm a woman, the response also included thirsty guys PMing me how they'd treat me better.
---
There won't be enough Priests, don't worry
---
I'll be heading to skeram with a couple friends. 10k+ queues don't seem worth it since I don't have a guild or anything binding me there. I think there's still plenty of people who haven't made characters yet so we should still get a decent sized population.
---
Yeah, I should have used the blue... ;)
---
There is no restriction on creating characters. And there is no priority for when you made the character. So more than likely you will both be sitting in queue on launch day if you're on a full realm.
---
I want to be healed by The Witcher!
---
Except there was a very healthy population on private servers over the years...
---
Yep. People just like to hate on Druid so I let them. Less gear competition :P
---
If only either one of those was PvE, which is what /u/busyboots was asking for. ;)
---
no one brought up PvP but you bud lol the OP was posting about leveling
---
Full status will not lock you out of a realm. Depending on volume, there may be queue times for popular realms.
---
Assume most people haven't subbed and logged in yet. Not everyone cared about stress tests and name reservations. Use that info how you will.
---
Bla meow isn't so bad.
---
How does this get upvoted.
---
Chain heal is very mana innefficient and their Teir sets suck.
---
So dramatic lol
---
Blow me
---
Today I only looked at the sub like a couple of times, it made the day go by a lot faster actually
---
If it's currently listed as full, both of you are effectively guaranteed to be waiting in a queue.      
---
Is there a particular reason you're tied to that realm?
---
You can create chars on servers that are full, but not the ones that are locked. Currently we dont know if this will happen, or when. Certainly wont be until a few days after launch id say
---
Absolute madlad we have here!
---
Good job Daniel !
---
tbh 3 being High just from people with current sub knowing how many people are waiting for launch to resub
---
Was coming in here to say something similar, lol
---
HAHA. How did you do the editing on this image? Did you do this yourself?
---
Well it depends. I can understand if someone feels like that but i personally dont. People end up using more english words than their native language anyway. I speak my native language on discord with my friends but in game on a german realm if you are doing group content like dungeons or BGs itd mostly english. People say stun, sheep, pull, ranged, melee, damage, heal, tank, incoming, class names, dungeon acronyms, CC, almost everything. Short sentences have more english words in it than german. Many play with english client too so you see constantly english names for abilities and items. I used the german client before but i changed it to english because in every guild i wad the GMs would say every ability in english so it was justveasier to judt have it in english thsb having to figure out what he actually means.
---
This is on german realms. I haven't experienced other realms so idk how it is there.
---
All healing specs are mostly the same in pvp. The biggest aspect that you have to consider is your ability to get away from being focused. Shaman healers are probably teir 2 for survivability less survivable than paladins and druids but more than priests. You may need to be more in the middle of combat to be effective due to limited totem range and to make good use of purge and interrupt. This may get you caught out more than other healers so being able to move well is a big deal.
---
True, but I doubt a high level Blizzard exec wants to acknowledge those
---
I'm also wondering how they calculate the server populations. I've got a name reserved on three different ones. Do I count as a player on each in Blizzard's calculations? It's a little weird.
---
no u
---
I think it's a simple case of people being generally bad at examining their feelings.  They know retail feels bad, or at least off.  But it's a lot harder to isolate and explain exactly what factors are the reasons, especially since that's different for everyone.
---
I haven't been able to find a guild that's actually a social experience since cata.  6 guilds since then, and not one had even the occasional conversation in guild chat or people hanging out.  That makes retail a very lonely experience for me.  Someone else in a guild with close friends seeing post about how lonely and empty the game feels probably assumes I'm nuts, or lying.
---
Another thing I don't like about retail is dungeons.  Everything's a rush to finish, most people don't even pause to loot.  But I don't know if that's the game's fault or if people in the game just have no patience.
---
Questing zones don't feel big and open, waiting to be explored anymore.  Instead I feel like I'm wearing a leash and being tugged along.
---
I'm sure with time I could pick out more, but chances are everyone has different issues.  And the fact that so many are clamoring for the same thing (Classic in this case) mixes things up and makes people assume we all are thinking the same too.
---
 No.

What podcasts can I listen to that are talking about this kind of stuff?
---
Doesn't surprise me.  I was tanking a dungeon yesterday, group runs ahead of me, so I let them have it.  They didn't even drop below 75%.
---
How old?
---
Whoosh.
---
Their breath meter lasts a lot longer. Like 300% I think.

So they don't need aire but if they stay under they rot is the explanation =P

---
The problem with having this many buffs is that the person in this video actually pushed them over the critical strike cap with daggers and possibly right to the limit of it with swords. At least 4-5% crit chance are being wasted in the dagger segment as with his setup he probably has around 52% crit chance while being crit capped around 48%. When he is using swords he is likely in the 47% area. It is interesting to see the top end but at the same time its not super realistic as to a comparison between the specs. He also let slice and dice drop for almost 2 seconds on the dagger part.
---
lol they did it again.
---
new servers?  lets give u 2 hour warning so the names will be gone by time time your group of friends even hear about it so you can stay on herod.
---
Why do you have to ask your wife? :p
---
Yea that's an excellent point. I also hear that rogues fit a more casual lifestyle as well. Plus stealth runs to mine BRD is supposed to be a decent gold maker as well.
---
If you want stupid answers then the other did a great job at it.
---
If you want an answer from someone that actually played the class then here we go:
---
[This is the build.](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxudgoxVGzI0u)
---
I can explain the reason behind each talent if you want, but here are the main ones:
---
1/ No Holy Shield: Garbage for 5mans. You simply cannot afford the mana cost. And it happens very often that you use Holy Shield the buff runs out without consuming all 4 block charges. Meaning you're wasting mana.
---
2/ No Improved Seal of Right: Also Garbage. Your SoR deals like 22 Holy damage per auto atk. Increasing the damage by 15%... that's like +3 Holy damage for 5 talent points. Nope.
---
3/ Improved Lay on Hands: You're not a Warrior, you don't have Defensive cooldowns. Now make Lay on Hands your Defensive cooldown.
---
4/ Improved Blessing of Wisdom: You will soon realize that you will be tanking with Blessing of Wisdom because have mana is everything on a Pally. Plus you're expected to have it as a healer.
---
5/ Guardian's Favor: You don't have a Taunt. You want Blessing of Protection to be ready as often as possible for when shit goes bad and you need to save your healer.
---
6/ No Toughness: Garbage. It was mathematically proved that it's bad for 5 talent points.
---
7/ Improved Concentration Aura: That's for raid. You will be the good boi they put with the casters group for 50% less risk off casting push back. Pally is not just a healer. He's a support class.
---
8/ Blessing of Sanctuary: This is for solo-AoE farming in the world. Pull packs of mobs, have a shield equipped and AoE.
---
----------------------------------------------
---
[Here's a more beginner friendly build](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxubgkxVG0IZV)
---
Healing is the same. Tankiness is the same. But you have better mana sustain while tanking 5 mans due to reduced mana costs on seals and Judgements.
---
Do you have a link to the survey?
---
yeah and I remember thinking it'd be stupid to roll undead because like only one class fears people, what a fuckin worthless PvP ability I'm going Troll!
---
Came here to say this.
---
right &lt;3
---
!RemindMe 1 week
---
yeah they kind of call for this kind of jokes by putting in the same sentence kill hogger and open AQ.
---
Vanilla was nothing compared to the first MMO I played FFXI, wanna talk about grinding, the only way to kill a rare mob in that MMO is to camp it for days and hope you get the claim before a chinese bot, keep in mind the mob has a window spawn where it can spawn between 4-18hours and if you sneeze you can miss it pop.
---
THis doesn't include the rare mobs who drop the best gear in the game and have a 2-5day window which have 100 people camping it at once in groups.
---
Then there's the farming of materials in a zone that even at max level 1 a bee can kill you, and as your about to kill it another bee aggros, and then you die, and when you die you lose experience and can de level down
---
The only way to level/get experience is in a party, so if you hate LFR/PUGS in wow, you never played ffxi, there's nothing worse than having to play with 5 people just to level, and if someone sucks you can't do anything because it takes you an hour to replace them.
---
Like playing your elemental shaman? enjoy your feral druid? well in ffxi if you didn't play the meta which was a BLM,RNG,RDM,BRD or a tank you stood in town for a week until you got a group invite for 1 hours worth of experience
---
WOW is childs play
---
Obv 1000 is rediculous as well. I'm saying if they started with twice the number as they have, and then organically added them there would've been way less confusion and chaos.  what would the issues have been then?
---
Why the QQ. They fill upp one server after the other. To make sure there isnt dead servers. Seems pretty ok to me.
---
How often are you going to be saying the server name?
---
😂
---
Probably because your a idiot.
---
Father of 3 boys under 6. Preach!!
---
"Im going camping, there might not be any phone service"
---
\*turns off phone*
---
\*stays home*
---
Level 18 bis. Anything else is unusable
---
It took me a while tome to the same conclusion as OP, but what it comes down to is:
---
Q: I paid but cannot play? Why would I sub early?
---
A: If you don’t sub early, the Blizzard doesn’t know to expect you. Instead, thousands of unexpected ‘guests’ are going to crowd servers at the last minute.
---
The outcome will be unbelievable queues to log in and likely unstable/crashing gameplay. Which means you still wont get to play the game after paying anyway.
---
People will then complain at the state of servers and it will be the fault of those who showed up unexpectedly. 
---
Like the party crasher who is mad there’s not enough beer for him and his 2-thousand friends, consider the early payment an RSVP so Blizzard knows to expect you and can plan accordingly.
---
TLDR- An early payment will allow us to play, refusing this RSVP will ensure that we can’t.
---
That reminds me of the unstoppable force. However I'm not sure how long it would take to get it since I'm not sure when AV would release. If I got either of those, would it make me at least viable in pvp with some rogue and warrior buddies?
---
I currently have a migraine so I’m stuck in the dark. Can this sub stop ruining my day?
---
Eastern US normal server. I don’t care for PVP. Unless they make another eastern Us normal server I may just got to Bloodsail.
---
They fleshed out their argument so well how could you disagree?

well, one could argue those tools are even more valuable on immobile classes like priests or warlocks.

But my immersion
---
He was raiding in WotLK, playing Holy Paladin.
---
This is Classic WoW sub, you won't get an unbiased opinion here. But just knowing that over 80% of people left retail and millions will come back for classic should be enough to tell which is the real deal.
---
"Lets advertise this everywhere and only make 10 realms!"
---
This might seem really random, but thank you so much for the copy paste data about the skyexchange quest bug, i reall appreciate it.
---
Why would you spec Arms then if you're not leveling on a PvP server then? It makes much more sense to spec Fury for the higher DPS output or Prot if you're just going to grind dungeons.
---
Nobody is going to bring an Arms warrior as DPS into a dungeon run unless they had to.
---
Poor Ehapahim the Druid...
---
2? they go live at 6 pm pacific don't they? that's like 9 pm eastern, more like 6 hours notice
---
This.. my husband will be busy with his games anyway lol
---
Again, the Brazilian and LatanAmerican playerbase arent all one giant cluster that have followed each other. They are going to be spread on every server and everyone is lying to themselves if they think otherwise. 
---
And every Brazilian player I've interacted with has been pretty awesome so far so yall are missing out by avoiding an entire server to play with try hards and assholes instead.
---
Healing is easier than DPS.
---
And once they reach the age of 4, you can teach them to do fishing or grinding lower lvl mobs.
---
I just imagine "need more servers" in the WC3 peon voice playing on repeat at Blizzard HQ
---
No, its just that you need to be agile in wow to be a good performer. And this is where cooking really shines.
---
If they add good names itll cause an imbalance in population. Just imagune a server named hogger or thrall.
---
Shazzrah cuz my bf told me to
---
Doubt it will have the same effect if you are just watching it, but i did it back then, and it was truly epic. The whole mystery was pretty much gone once TBC came out.
---
Yes, this is obviously fake, I made this to show how unreliable the "Last Modified Time" is; anyone can figure this out with a quick google search.
---
This but jumping from stables to blacksmith without landing in the water
---
Just as they can always add servers, so too can they merge them. 
---
It will cause some pain w/r/t names and such, but that's life.
---
ok
---
I'll take a day off, but still go to work to play from there. Faster internet connection, unlimited drinks and no one will interrupt me because it starts at 0 am when no one is there ;)
---
That's quite rebellious
---
Well, they initially launched so few servers that even the most pessimistic cynic could tell it wouldn't suffice, but then they waited long enough to let everyone get invested before releasing more. Now there's a mass outbreak of fear of missing out. They could easily have started with at *least* twice the number of PvP servers. People don't really want to take a gamble on a realm that you know nothing about except that the most serious, dedicated players aren't on it.
---
But there’s a big difference in magnitude. People young and old are being bombarded with way more constant entertainment and information than ever before. Most of us are way too addicted to our phones, and young kids are way too addicted to their tablets.
---
That and leveling in a healing spec is hell, lol
---
imagine being homeless, and seeing this, and remembering back when you had a house and internet and you kill yourself cuz you miss azeroth so much
---
I hate the idea of actually releasing expansions. I don't mind releasing an expansion separately and letting people with lvl 60 characters on classic create one lvl 60 character or something, but it should be classic should remain just that, the lvl cap should remain 60. I absolutely hate the idea of releasing TBC and WoTLK after classic, as part of classic. If they are released at all they should be stand-alone.
---
The only extra thing I am willing to accept is some notion of "classic+" adding some content but keeping the level cap. I also wouldn't mind if "classic+" was also on a separate server, and leveling was made faster or something to cater towards vanilla players that don't want to go through the same leveling process again and know their classes. Maybe "classic+" is classic with the planned added content that never made it, Grim Baton, and Kara?
---
It is my opinion that classic should remain the same so that anyone can experience WoW how it was originally at any time. I understand that over a few years people will be farming AQ, maybe even Naxx and PvP will get ridiculous for new 60s that's okay, many people who have cleared Naxx will either quit or try to do it again with an alt, there will always be some players that need to run dungeons and earlier raids, with a higher server capacity probably enough to get groups fairly easily.
---
Missing out on exciting MC runs. Oh boy

Im ganking me some Amsongold 😁
---
This, just this, add a raid in one of the zones with gear about 5-8% stronger than the gear acquired in Naxx. Have a zone have pvp objectives and some high end farming which can be contested. Nothing too big, keep it in Azeroth, no flying, add a raid and add a 15 men a la UBRS with MC/ZG tier gear.
---
It’s a game if you don’t like it don’t play it 
---
Complain about it but don’t act like it’s a big deal to quit a game bc you don’t like it’s current state
---
Discord link is dead my dude
---
Then you're wasting your time with a pally, IMO. You're talking about putting in a ton of time and effort into building essentially two separate BiS sets to help you be a subpar tank and a mediocre healer for a limited period of time. That's a lot of cost for very little benefit. You'd be better off focusing on assembling a healing set while running with a tank from your guild and just feeding them the tank gear.
---
cheers for explaining the rot mechanic, I had only heard it was possible to lose gear and levels but had no idea if it was rare or not.   
---
At the time I admit I avoided those games because of how hard they sounded - but now that ive experienced the difficulty of WoW dropping and the enjoyment dropping alongside, I wonder if I'd like those games.
---
There have been healthy populations on private servers for years though is what he is saying. That provides some proof as to the staying power of classic, and he had that knowledge when he went onstage and stuck his foot in his mouth.
---
You couldn’t be more wrong.
---
my wife
---
No, you did dad.
---
I always hit that little bump of dirt just below the actual flag level, so you couldn't climb up and still had to go down/around a bit.
---
We don't know for sure, only make assumptions based on polls and server specific Discords. Mirage Raceway seems to be the most balanced, and you will certainly find everything. Based on pools and Discord tags, faction distribution seems to be balanced, plenty of people looking to tank and heal. English speaking, high Dutch presence which is good compared to some other nations who tend to refuse English communication, it also seems to attract international Eastern European players who prefer English. Healthy population but not overly crowded. I picked a PvE server because of the cross realm BGs in phase 3 don't really see a point in rolling on a PvP server. Organized open world pvp event will still happen on Mirage, and you dont have to deal with PvP raids controlling and area of the map for farming.

Yikes. As someone who's trained for more than 8 hours in a single day I can say that it was probably worse than not having done it at all, from a physical standpoint anyway :p

and can port everywhere.  Mages are extremely convenient

So basically now nordics are all spread across 3 pvp servers :D

I'd rather avoid mergers for as long as possible. Personally.

They have said they will add more servers as they fill up.

---
Same boat. I wanted to play a priest, but after seeing the mass amount of priests ill just go rogue and KILL ALL OF THEM
---
I have made three characters and plan to level them all along with each other.  Based on past memories I think it might be doable to get them all to 60 by Phase 2.  Regardless I don't have plans to power level one first.  Going to play one until I get a bit tired of it, switch to another character and just rotate between the three of them that way.

If Auctioneer is Calculator, TSM is Excel.

Pretty much.  Otherwise it's a daytime corpse run from Freeport.
---
i agree 100% most people are not that desperate to reserve a name to pay half a month sub for the privilege
---
its essentially throwing cash in the trash.
---
it also makes sense every player subbed to retail for retail logged on and saved their name on a few servers even if they are not all that interested in classic.
---
Kinda shitty to be a hunter seeing as arrows don't drop in dungeons, do they?

bun?

Back when men played male characters. Man times have changed.

A lot of nostalgia this. I was there from the beginning in Rsextio and then Evil Eye. Played rogue (Ghast) in MC. My brother (Sepel/Qasepel) was one of the founders of Evil Eye together with Tyrre I think it was. I have been playing on and off and still play, still on Bloodscalp.
---
For PvP maybe. But if you're talking about PvE you're wrong. Windfury totem and chain heal are god-tier tools. You want to be downranking your Chain Heal.
---
I really thought layering was supposed to increase server capacity enough to where this wouldn't be an issue, this shit makes little to no sense to me. 
---
Any jackass in this subreddit could have told them they didn't have enough servers when they were first announced, how did Blizzard with their vast resources not plan ahead for this? Really worries me for launch day that it's going to be like EVERY online launch ever:
---
"OMG we weren't expecting so many people, servers are broken everyone! Game should be playable in a few weeks, don't worry! We're hard at work!"
---
And Napoleon Solo. Lots of series.
---
This guy gets it. They made such a big deal of name reservation and now they just ask people to jeopardize their reservations? Not gonna happen
---
Sure but they do want people to move realms and those people care about their name.

early SWG where you could spend months unlocking your Jedi slot only to get killed by a bounty hunter and if it happened a second with in a certain amount of time the character was perma killed and you had to reroll, eventually they changed it to where you just lost XP (and I think skill boxes too) instead of the whole character.  Also, in the beginning you had to run back to your corpse to retrieve your items after respawning and you got debuffed and received wounds if you didn’t pay to have your DNA stored at the cloning facility.
---
 Faerlina
---
&gt;It's way too easy to die in WoW, especially due to other people's mistakes, for this to feasible beyond the sheer novelty of it. 
---
I mean if you play a rogue/hunter you can play quite safe. Especially if you consider things like invulnerability potions, swiftness, etc.
---
I think it would be a very fun thing to see.
---
Not the best example, since not really a MMO. But early Path of Exile was a huge diefest. Could die to literally anything, and people were pretty bad at the game since no established meta...would often see people dying left and right.
---
Also, Ultima Online was very punishing. Not exactly permadeath, but you'd often lose all the gear you had before you'd get your corpse back.
---
Considering WoW isn't that grindy when it comes to levelling, I think permadeath could work.
---
I just made one, check out my comment above.

Sure, I fully expect gank squads, but that's not my playstyle. I dont get much satisfaction out of 5v1.

The real world isn't black and white, and the World of Warcraft is **also** a mess of grey.

Wouldn't you agree that judging a faction as being the "bad guys" purely based on how they look seems like a "bad guy" thing to do?

Where did you get that desk?
---
Thats not an overhaul then, small changes in my opinion are fine such as giving paladins a taunt.
---
Well, indeed, it's "days after" then.
---
Demonstrably they can spin up new servers very quickly, so if there are more people on launch, they will keep adding servers.
---
Played all roles and cannot disagree more. When it comes to difficulty it is most definitely: Tank &gt; Healer &gt; DPS.
---
Hehe nice try, it's your own video 😊 But welcome to Classic, enjoy your stay!
---
Same boat here
---
Blammo.
---
I'm going keto and IF for the first week at least. Making some Pemmiccan. Very sustaining.
---
It was just like a bad joke, yeah pandaren are apart of the lore but when 80%, of your playerbase hasn't played warcfaft prior and just dumping a jumpy panda on the screen was just icing on the cake.
---
I literally couldn't mention wow within the next 2 years without someone saying "lmao pandas".
---
If memory serves, they are a world drop. Meaning any level 45-50 mob
---
Is that dynamic something that evolved over time? I've been living with my gf for almost two years now, and most any change in style/functionality of our apartment is a joint decision. If she wants to put up a picture she'll run it by me, and vice versa. It's not asking permission as much as it is sharing in the decision, since we share the space.
---
Thank you for your suggestion. Would this book still be interesting for someone who has no background in game development?
---
my mom found out about my wow classic vacation and now she wants to go to the mountains for a quick trip starting the 22nd.  If I'm not back for day of, Imma die.
---
You don't really farm BoE random world drop epics.
---
No they didn't.  They're being cautious to avoid dead servers in a few months.
---
how did you coordinate this so fast? must have been hard since the announcement to agree with all these guilds/members to just swap server?
---
Farm gold
---
You don’t farm world epics...
---
Definitely less than 3/4,

&gt;Over all Shamen is the worst healer #'s wise when you compare over all the phases. (It's a common mis-conception Druids are worse because Shammies are better in phase 1. But it falls off hard by phase 3)
---
Going by the HPS numbers on LegacyPlayers, this does not seem to be the case.
---
You farm gold and then buy them once they show up on the AH.
---
Omen and the Lunar Festival's first Appearance was on January 27th 2007.

---
I'll let you do the math :p
---
Ah, Ventrilo harassment.
---
Ironic you call people who are well into adulthood, childish or "not grown up", just because they disagree with you.
---
And I bet if you did a poll, a very small percentage of people here have ever logged into a private server, even once.
---
Someone doesn't want changes, so they are immature? Really? That seems like a reasonable conclusion to you?
---
A reasonable adult would recognize that people are different, like/prefer different things, and that's ok.
---
It isn't clear that "we" know what "we" want. It's insane to think just because you want something for many years means you 100% *truly* want it and will love it. You could spend your whole life working towards something, get it, and realize you don't actually want it or find much enjoyment from it. The closest you can get to knowing you want it is if you have personally been playing pservers for awhile.
---
You may end up loving it, or hating it. He said the statement knowing that there are literally thousands of people that truly *will* want it and will play it for years to come... but that's not what he meant. He meant the Majority of players may be interested/begging to play Classic but once its out quit after a few months. Which, he is likely right, but only time will tell.
---
For vanilla The Prophet Skeram is a perfect name for a server. Though I'm sticking with Stalagg. Good luck with your names.
---
If you like soloing stuff hunter is great with kiting, pet, etc.
---
Druid is also nice since you can stealth but also solo stuff and self-heal.
---
the hoodie is way cooler than the shirt :(
---
I love how in response to this you only get more anecdotes
---
we already went down that route. the game sucks so bad now they had to reset it. we need a new direction.
---
They drop from mobs 45-50, including elites at that level range. So... stock up on Cheetos and Nodoz and start blasting Live To Win. You might be killing mobs for weeks and months. At least you’ll have epic mount gold.
---
Layers are to prevent dead servers down the road.
---
Yeah, but some new player is inevitably going to talent for healing because they want to be a healer and don't know any better.
---
A lot of them, probably.  Poor saps.
---
Interesting.  Idk why i've never really considered ret aura.  So i could take a point from SotC and the point from Sanc aura and put them both into Imp. Ret aura?  that would leave me with 4/5 Illumination, 1/3 SotC, and 2/2 Ret aura.
---
Or should I take a point from Illumination?  I know holy shouldn't be my focus, but I will be respecing into full holy around that time anyway.  I'm going to put everything into ret pretty much until I'm done, put a few into holy until I'm around 55 or so, then repec into a 5/10 man healing spec
---
Blaumeux is one of the Four Horsemen in Naxx, for what it's worth.
---
But you're totally right - we can have different things that are important to us. Your experience should be exactly as you want it :)
---
Besides, I'm sure there will be more servers opening before launch. You'll probably have a few more to pick from.
---
Ok.
---
But why settling on one role when you can have a little bit of everything, like a Druid :)
---
Thanks for your response. Does "lore" just mean background story?
---
47 here- statyed gaming in 1977, cant wait until Tiesday. BfA plays way too fast for me. I sneezed and I was level 10. I want crafting to matter. I want to depend on other players. I want skill tree choices. 
---
Going human alliance warrior. Hardest leveling experience, pffft. I played everqueat. Bring the noise!
---
wtf is this pve arms spec
---
Good god the irony, that's horrendous. Surely driving at unsafe speeds is something you'd be incredibly cautious of if you're the star of Fast and Furious?
---
My advise pertaining to raiding would be to find a casual yet serious guild. My guild is filled with people who have jobs and can’t be on all the time. We know it’s going to take a while to get to a point where we have enough people to even consider a raid, but these guilds tend to be a little more lenient on who they bring to raid. A lot of the “hardcore” guilds will not let you join if you don’t have a perfect build. So look at some guides/builds for the characters you want and find a casual/inviting guild of likeminded people. It’ll take a longggg time to get to 60 anyway. You will learn how to efficiently play your character on the journey.
---
Would you recommend going for the shadow tree while leveling? I guess it makes sense as it must help solo, can you still heal in instances decently with those talents? 
---
If yes I guess i'm just gonna play Spriest till endgame, that doesn't sound like a bad plan.
---
Nah dungeons mobs nowadays has more mechanics than vanilla bosses
---
Yeah I'm a longtime fan so I was nerding out. Always wanted to see Pandaria after Chen mentioned it in WC3. It turned out to be a cool expansion with tons of good lore though! 😍
---
Stay off reddit.
---
Oops!
---
It's quite simple for me too : come back from work, be in queue for the whole evening, go to bed without having had the opportunity to play, rinse and repeat the next days until weekend finally hits.
---
As mentioned, since the item is a "Bind on Equip" World Drop, there are no specific mobs that you can grind out to have the gloves drop. Treat it like a lottery, you're either really lucky or you're buying them off the Auction House
---
lol?...

THANK GOD YOU POSTED THIS IVE NEVER SEEN THIS POST BEFORE

Saved! Will watch later when I have time. Thanks op

---
I just assume everyone I’m grouped with is covered in their own shit just like I am. Takes the “have to wonder” part out of it.
---
That's a fair point. The surveys are skewed somewhat towards certain enthusiast communities. But couldn't you also say that those same communities will be the ones who stick around? Polling retail players is pointless, because most of them won't make it to 60.
---
Join the hunters !  Woot woot!

im going pure ret and taking repentance even though its not reccomended 
---
played around on my server yesterday and its always handy to have an extra cc so you can get a heal off 
---
few guides have you respec at 32 slightly, im just going pure ret till repentance, then into holy and at 60  ill use my 1g respec to go holy
---
I mean, it's absolutely preferable to have at least one PvP server if you're into PvE, or viceversa, than to not have anything at all.
---
Ok? Shouldn't you be happy there's one less person in queue on your server? Lol
---
i have sacrificed everything, what have you given?
---
Well opening day will be hectic, but if you can login you (should have) lots of players also starting that you can potentially team up with.
---
I'd suggest to get a few levels, and then the quests that are like "kill 20 goats" or whatever, find others also killing goats (before or during) and do it together.
---
Easiest way to farm world drops is by refreshing ah.
---
How is that different from thotbot + waypoint addon, global lfg, and bossmods which all existed in vanilla. The only difference now is they’re easy to find and install.
---
WotF is even great for PvE, there are a few encounters with fear mechanics, breaking those can save you from staring at "Release Spirit" while the rest of your raid fights on.
---
Do you have to reply to every single comment? I wasn't trying to convince you or anyone else. I say that on every comment/post that hints there is a sliver of redeemability to BfA.
---
1a-b isn't really anything to worry about yet. It normally takes first timers several months IRL to hit level cap. As you get closer you will learn more and more on a drip feed both about your class and endgame content. It's a lot to take in in one sitting, so just try to do some research as you level. I usually advise players to start thinking about their endgame role around level 40 because there may be things you need to do at lower levels to prepare (certain quest items, or professions). 
---
As a warrior tank you will be worth your weight in gold while leveling, but much more dispendable at 60. If you want to be the guy going toe to toe with the boss, it's hard to get that spot at 60. Most guilds will chose their main tank before they even roll. Others will have one the same day they're created. Often it's the guild or raid leader.
---
Never fear tho, because if you really like warrior, it also makes a great endgame damage dealer, and you will still be called up to tank from time to time. If this doesn't sound appealing, I'd recommend going mage.
---
Warropr and druid is a very strong combo imo. However she will spend a lot of time waiting for your slow ass to catch up; druids travel much quicker. This is equalized after you get your level 40 mounts.
---
One of the main reasons druid is so strong at leveling is because it can damage in cat form, and save its mana for heals. I'd recommend that she go feral to maximize this. 
---
Where to meet depends on your races. Usually around 10 is a good time, probably in westfall or darkshore.
---
I'm open to follow up questions if you would like me to elaborate on anything!

---
loot roll drama is going to be insane. love every minute of it.
---
Nah, not how it works at all. If a server has a 10,000 cap and only 1 layer, all 10,000 can see eachother. If it has 5 layers, it’s split into layers of 2,000 each, but the total server cap is still only 10,000.
---
The population cap stays the same no matter what, and so does your queue. Layering only affects how many people you see in the world
---
That isn't Classic...HERETIC!
---
Just to tack on a bit, make sure that while your being vocal and leading the group to keep a good attitude! No raging if the healer messes up and you die, don't be pissed if the DPS are attacking the wrong marked target and pulling aggro, and don't try and shift blame if you mess up. WoW classic is a game about community and keeping your group stoked and having fun means you will have a far better time and more likely to get invited to dungeon runs!
---
This really goes for all classes (not specifically for tanking) and is just a general rule of thumb that classic players should remember.
---
Damn the Nordic community splitting its own community to pieces! 🤪
---
NGL, I've done this a few times myself so far.

Holy shit I remember this comic. I came to this sub to see what the crack is with Classic! Is this still going ?

I highly suggest an ultrawide!
---
Old news.....
---
But there's absolutely no reason they can't give people 24-36 hours notice of a new realm. That would actually get more people off the realms they fear will be overcrowded. Sure they don't care about your names but waiting doesn't hurt blizzard.
---
The real trick is to get your wife to play wife you. I somehow got lucky this year and was able to convince my non-gamer wife to try WoW out on a private server a couple of months ago. She had never heard of WoW before (she is from Japan) so she didn't have the negative view about the game that other non-gamer spouses might have. She tried it out and when I mentioned we could play the game together she said she would give it a try. 4 hours later, I was actually the one that said hey, I need to sleep for work tomorrow. Needless to say, she is looking forward to the game re-releasing next week!
---
If I hadn't gotten this lucky though, my wife is usually cool with me playing (games) when the kids go to bed as it is the only way me and my brothers can "hang out" since we all live in different states. As long as I don't take advantage and play every night until bedtime she doesn't mind. Back rubs, and doing what she want's in between the days I play any games helps. I think they key is do the game time in moderation and when you do something she enjoys, enjoy it as much as you would your hobbies. Good luck brother!
---
NA player LF group. I'm looking to play on a High pop server, alliance. Most likely rolling a paladin. I'm looking for a group to no life with for the first week or two, I've completely cleared my schedule and ready to commit 12-14 hours a day into dungeons / questing. I'm by no means looking for a super try hard group, serious but laid back and ready to have some fun. 
---
Looking to find a group who is looking to progress everyone together, I'm by no means stingy with drops or such. Progressing everyone so we can push easier is important and sharing is caring. 
---
I haven't really played wow seriously since Cata, when I quit. 
---
I do not have Vanilla experience, I started in early BC. 
---
Schedule is clear for a couple weeks on launch, ready to grind dungeons for a week or two, 12+ hours a day. 
---
PM me and we'll talk, thanks.
---
It was pretty obviously a joke, but the deadpan guest had me in awe. There’s no way I could’ve kept up the act, especially that convincing.

Norwegian post on discord:  **Kjære alle!** I uken som var har det skjedd mye. Siden vi tok stilling til servervalg sist har Blizzard sagt at det har vært ekstremt stor pågang på Wow Classic, og mye mer enn de hadde forutsett. Vi har hatt tett kontakt med representanter fra de ulike guildene og har sammen kommet til at serveren som ble annonsert idag blir et beste valget for oss. Vi er svært opptatt av at servervalg ikke bare skal samle Norge, men at vi også skal velge den serveren som gir den beste spillopplevelsen, både på launch, men også over tid. Dette er ikke en avgjørelse vi tar lett på, og vi er sikre på at dette blir et godt valg når vi nå går mot launch 27. august.  Wow Classic Norge skal spille på:  **Firemaw \[EU-PVP\] - Spre ordet!** Character creation på Firemaw åpner imorgen kl. 20:00 tirsdag 20. august!
---
Wow, midnight for Europe? That's brutal...
---
High resolution in itself isn't the big challenge when it comes to monitors...
---
Please don't, no reason to pay to reserve your name only to be kindly told to try another server because the server where you got your name is completely overcrowded.
---
Definitely a good one.
---
8/27? I thought it was 8/26, Monday for release in US.
---
Lok'tar brother. Together we can put an end to the Paladin Police force.
---
That I think even furthers the point though. You can get a good idea of numbers when the server is live and checking the actual players online. Until then everyone is just guessing and throwing in their own nonsensical estimates. Also with them constantly adding new servers, and people changing their minds?
---
Its not like they keep delaying patches in retail if more players are playing lol. No I dont think that the majority of people will be 60, I just dont think it really matters. Its good of they release content before people have access to it, they used to do that all the time back in the day.
---
Higher refresh rates would be neat as well. But that also depends on your PC's ability to put out more frames. So if you can put out 200 fps, 200hz would be worth it.
---
Sucks to hear that. Imo it doesn’t belong in Classic, it completely ruined the fun of auctionhouses for me.
---
Yo fuck Cavill, I'm rolling with Vin.
---
I did have some trouble with a few bosses in Naxx 10, but never Patchwerk. And we were a pretty bad guild in retrospect :/ The other crazy thing is the damage is also pretty close, and not just with Patches but with a lot of bosses, even though most people have 20k HP in Wrath instead of 3-5k in Classic.
---
Make a bank alt
---
Fun Fact: Henry Cavill actually missed the call from Zack Snyder saying he got the role because he was in the middle of a dungeon.
---

This is a very solid leveling guide that I'll roughly follow:
---
https://www.wowisclassic.com/en/class-guide/warrior/leveling-1-60/
---
The /sit enrage trick won't work like that in Classic (you at least have to match the mob's attack and get up in the same spell batch to trigger it intentionally), but the rest seems up to date. It also contains a very nice weapon progression for both factions.
---
it's faster than food, most people establish some rhythm of ' kill X mobs, Bandage, kill another X mobs, Eat, kill x mobs, Bandage  etc.   and you can do it IN combat, which is most important for any class with crowd control.  (fear, bandage,  sheep, bandage, stun, bandage.)
---
At lvl 60 anybody (except maybe healers)  is expected to have runecloth bandages, they are needed for  raids and also handy in 5 man dungeons to release some pressure from the healer
---
I just read here somewhere that its a waste of gold to have tailoring while leveling and it's better to have alch or gathering professions for gold and farm up enough to be able to just bulk skill tailoring later for Robe Of the Void or whichever were the items you should have as  a lock
---
I played horde on kargath in Wrath
---
You can tank leveling as arms/fury no need to spec prot
---
Well those 3 are notoriously easy.. And that is an absurd opinion as you can easily have done that in vanilla there are fights that don't even have mechanics beyond a few people.
---
Oh absolutely!
---
Depends if they still need stuff from it.  Legendaries may promote running MC later and later, for sulfuras or thunderfury.
---
I just wanted to say:  the people posting on the official WOW Classic forums are 90% fucking wankers. You post stupid shit day after day. While ruff necks like us get banned.   " Paladin ret dps is viable!"   "Ban mods from classic!" 
---
"Dungeon Set 2 should be worthless when it's released!"     Fuck you lamers.
---
Ok well then give me an example of a really difficult to do mechanic or boss in vanilla

P3 Xrealm BGs is dumb. P4 Xrealm BGs is dumb. P5 Xrealm BGs is dumb. P6 Xrealm BGs is how it should have been.  
---
Shorter queue times? We already have incredibly large megaservers and the game hasn't even come out yet. Queue times are gonna be okay even in the middle of the night.  
---
It literally serves no purpose to lock in the phase in which Xrealm goes live prior to the release of the game, other than to make the experience authentic -- which would be locking it in at phase 6, as Xrealm BGs weren't introduced until AFTER Naxx had been released. So it makes absolutely ZERO reason.  
---
It's a huge fuckup, and such a shame.
---
Was there a queue at 8am? Just to get an idea of how early I might want to log in to dodge the queue.
---
Dude, you know there would absolutely be a dedicated crowd to a hardcore MMO.  Would it be as big as retail?  No way, but neither will Classic.  
---
The only thing holding EQ back is it was made in 1999, looks like ass even for that year, and controls like mud.
---
For PvP it's anyone's game. World pvp might be more difficult as a melee build but it's still doable, and there's always Battlegrounds. 
---
Even in pve, if you find a group willing to be flexible you might be able to go without being a main healer. Your damage will suck but the class brings a lot to the table. If you can maintain totems and drop spot heals it should help a good amount.
---
I might modify this a bit but I plan to go with an [elemental/enhancement](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hE0uxbhoZxVbbqMu) hybrid, eventually using spell damage gear.
---
not back in vanilla
---
Everyone's wife should love when they are happy for sure, very happy for you, just curious if anyone was gonna spend extra time with their wives to make up for lost time moving forward :P

Unfortunately i am older now 10 hours will probably kick my ###. Back in Vanilla i could do 24 hours now i think that may kill me maybe i should get a emergency bracelot.
---
Sometimes that helps

Everyone's wife should love when they are happy for sure, very happy for you, just curious if anyone was gonna spend extra time with their wives to make up for lost time moving forward haha
---
Eh, a lot of people considered Naxx on farm if they could down the Spider wing, so there was definitely some inflation in people's memories as to their prowess. 
---
Alliance on my side had a multiple (5-8) raid groups in Naxx, but really only 2 that could down the harder wing bosses. Horde was slightly better, with an actually national competitive guild, but they kept poaching from any group that was progressing to keep the overall faction healthy.
---
Queue in wow while playing D3 S18
---
Human = top pve performance. 
---
Orc = top pvp performance.
---
If you care about 2h vs DW that could help you make your decision. 2h only really viable with windfury.
---
Horde because windfury
---
Oh shit sign me up
---
Same.  I'm not subbed and a lot of people I know aren't yet.
---
What does it mean at Phase 6, "final installment of Classic"? Aren't the expansions, BC and WOTLK going to be added or are they already added in?
---
I would assume, just using Old School Runescape as an example, that if Classic is a massive success and continues to maintain peak player counts, we'll get more than just 6 phases and actual expansions?
---
Life is just about giving and taking
---
The lack of hit gear cripples dual wield leveling and the talents are very weak early on to make it worth it for a 2H build.
---
And as someone who plans to play classic fairly casually, this is why I rolled on a normal server not a pvp server.  If I want pvp I can toggle it on and go to Tarren Mill/Southshore, and toggle it off when I want to quest.
---
Since you like PvP, go Orc. Alliance got nothing that compares to that broken ass stun resist.
---
This is the only reasonable method
---

27th of August, 2019 - which is how you say it.

---
"If you want a bot to run the auction house for you, this is the addons to use."
---
Honestly that's what it is. You configure it and then run the bot.
---
This is perfect.
---
Imp shield block is for raids, not dungeons. Your not getting crushing blowed in dungeons. Last Stand and defiance sure somewhat useful, but piercing howl will be 10x better imo. Such a flexible spell. Good in pvp , good in pve both offensively and defensively, good for tanking.
---
150+ corpse runs to 60... lol
---
So fucking play retail and stay the fuck away from classic then?
---
How viable is it though compared to DW?
---
Sure but you want me to leave Whitemane for the Blowme server?
---
Orc. Axe specialization/Blood Fury. 
---
Stun resist
---
If you think leveling at 12 is rough it gets worse when you are in STV at 30 getting ganked every 5-10 min.

One for mage? :D
---
I found out about OSRS after it got re-released. I told my friends it would die off and holy shit was I wrong. I don't want classic to start adding new stuff like OSRS did but they proved that it's not just nostalgia with these types of games.
---
According to private servers, 11 days /played was the average.
---
*I think Stalagg will have the best launch experience because I chose to roll there.
---
Ftfy
---
What specifically would make it "illegal"? It's certainly a very powerful tool, but it doesn't do anything a variety of other addons don't already do. It just consolidates it into one.
---

I don't think they are misjudging at all. They just want to make sure that *every* server has plenty of people rather than post 20 and hope that 5 or so don't get the most people leaving the other 15 in trouble. Which would likely happen due to certain names being more liked + people see "high/full" and jump on it rather than "low/medium" ones because they want a populated server.
---
4HM
---
Totally agreed. A ton of new games have the new game+ mechanic where you restart the game but keep your stuff and levels. Really not my thing, but its fine as extra content in a singleplayer game.
---
The point isn't to have a reason to do a raid all the way through an expansion necessarily, it's to make it so you must progress through all of them. In BfA you can just skip to Eternal Palace. There is pretty much no reason to do the previous raids, nor do much of the previous patch content in general. In Classic and TBC this wasn't a problem in part because of the lack of catch-up gear and attunements.
---
For drama. Seems like it's working as intended.
---
Depends what you mean, fun as in during solo questing and leveling? I mean the tanking itself is a lot of fun as a warrior in vanilla. At least in my opinion. I think pally tanks can level a lot better and feral druids as well, since they can heal themself. But warrior tank has no self heal and very low damage. Prepare to use bandages or eating after every fight, which causes a lot of downtime while questing.
---
Cross-server will kill the PvP community. This is a huge mistake.
---
It's weird, Ion went on about how Classic is all about the community and "Cross server? no way" in his Blizzcon speech about classic, yet they think cross-server BGs are ok? Why the double standard when it comes to PvP?
---
They don't even fix queues - one faction has been 1-5m and the other has been 15-25m since their inception. 
---
CROSS-SERVER ANYTHING IS BAD FOR THE COMMUNITY. CLASSIC WOW IS ALL ABOUT THE COMMUNITY. SAY NO TO CROSS-SERVER ANYTHING.
---
You do actually care though, given that you replied to me repeatedly.
---
Imagine posting in an internet forum and being surprised when people respond to your low effort comment.
---
But hey, if you think "DAE BFA LE BAD GIB UPDOOTS" is brave in the classicwow subreddit, more power to you :)
---
Okay cool this is helpful.  I think I'll take a point from Illumination and put it into Consecration, or would it be better to take a point from Imp. LoH?  I like the 20min decrease, but at the same time Illumination is basically constant.
---
please make one for other classes!!! i’m playin rogue... would love to see more!
---
I LOVE THIS THO
---
Is stun resist more important than having freedom though in group pvp?
---
I'm all for the Alliance but if those are your priorities then I think orc racials beat human - but I'm not sure if it's harder to get axes over swords in raids. But the hardiness beats the other human racials for pvp for sure. Also, the Horde pvp warrior set just looks badass. I'm such a traitor 😂
---
Dual spec would ruin classic wow, too many fucking idiots here.
---
Play fucking retail.
---
Rest In Peace Vilesoul Jay and Shaun Tokens. Wish you could be here to experience it all together again.
---
Bs is more threat if you have one Target on the aggro list, it splits aggro evenly among all aggro tables where demo is the same amount of threat on all Targets it hits.  So demo is usually what you want to use at 3 or more targets
---
No, most methods of calculating are an *approximation*, which is neither silly nor substantially inaccurate to the point of being unusable data.  As for benefits, what you suggests benefits them the least because it does not account for the fact that one account can only play one character at a time, so in the purpose of realm population for active players and queues it's a grossly inaccurate misrepresentation.
---
At least its better than stalaggs haha, that was like a 2.5 hour notice.
---
Cross-server, since it's inception, has never fixed queues. One faction is always 1-5m, and the other is always 15-25m.
---
That's the way video games are designed today.  It's not about player retention, and its not even so much about initial sales.  It's the microtransactions.
---
Take a couple other games I've recently quit: Mechwarrior Online, and Madden NFL.  Mechwarrior was "free to play", but I probably spent more money on that in 3 years than I've spent in 15 years on WoW.  And I wasn't even the biggest whale.  There were some Mechs that were $500 each for a special skin, and some people bought all 8 of them.
---
Madden NFL is another one.  They are lucky enough to have a monopoly with the NFLPA, which means they can put out the same crap game every year and people don't have much option but to buy it.  But they made $800M on selling cards for Madden Ultimate Team.
---
Games these days don't care how many people play.  They care only about the whales.
---
Having a initial launch of a few servers and adding more to meet demand was 100% part of blizzards plan.
---
How does that make them “not prepared”
---
Lok’tar Ogar brother
---
I've gone from "I'm not an expert but here's my $0.02" to "I have no idea" haha. I'd advise asking on the warrior discord
---
INVITE TO SUPERMAN'S LAYER!
---
Youre really taking this hard man lol.
---
\+1
---
Im trying real hard to convice my group of friends to switch but their argument is not concerning the name, but the fear that the server will be dead in 6 months. I try to explain to them that won't happen but they are dead certain that only Herod will thrive long term.
---
Pffft my achievements will be more like Van Cleef, Bazil Thredd...
---
Wanna dps or you wanna heal?
---
DPS, rogue
---
Heal, shaman
---
PVP?  either both are good depends on what you like, keep in mind though that raid gearing for a rogue = pvp gear.  Raid gearing for shaman = some pvp gear some not.  Like, it has crit and healing and spelldamage/healing.  So it kinda gets you stats, but rogues gear is like all damage.
---
Hva slags discord er dette?
---
You're delusional if you think every server isn't going to be bursting at the seams. I honestly feel like we're in the Chernobyl control room, arrogance thick in the air.
---
Everyone will eventually clear raids, that sir is relatively easy. Really no need to be first.
---
So. Literally thirteens?
---
I bet plenty of streamers will get queue'd
---
really makes u think
---
You either get 5/5 Illumination or you dont get any of it.
---
+ I don't know why you would take Illumination while leveling. You will only get a crit heal like once every 20 casts.
---
And one normal Holy Light is enough to full your health. You won't be spamming heals to make use of Illumination. It's an end game healer talent.
---
Here's what I would build for a Ret leveling:
---
[Tree](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sxxzbZxhZVfLtbcV)
---
Ret tree easy to understand.
---
Holy tree you just want Consecration really.
---
Prot Tree to use Devotion aura AND get that 3% chance to hit. (Melees suck at auto attacking while leveling. It really helps alot).
---
Jokes arent "messages"
---

---
Was too young at the time to have ever properly played EQ but That sounds genuinely awesome and something I'd love to see in newer MMO's. I can almost imagine something similar playing out in Classic if the system existed. 
---
You're questing in Ashenvale and decide that you've got enough time before it gets dark to finish off one of the furbolg barrow den quests but it ends up taking much longer than you anticipated. Instead of turning back and making a run to town just in time for sundown you decide to soldier on and finish off the quest. When you finally make you're way out of the Den it's pitch black and you have to wander through the dense forest trying to sleek past vastly more dangerous mobs that come out at night while you try and find you're way to the main path.
---
I think it'll end up to be something like 3k. Blizz wants servers to be similar to classic, maybe a bit more populated but not by too much.
---
Even for classes it doesn't seem that useful on, it's extremely useful. You save hundreds of mana and keep your 5 second rule going by bandaging yourself or your pet instead of using a healing spell.
---
slightly off topic but I heard bonefires don't do damage in classic... is that true?
---
We have most definitely less than 20% of all players you literal retard.
---
Please make a hardcore raid guild for only elderly people called the “Senior Citizen Society” or something.
---
it's unlikely that any realm will end up balanced, xrealm battlegrounds, no reason to force yourself to play at a disadvantage on a realm with opponents.
---
Isn't AoE grinding messed up on the beta due to some of the "batching" issues? Look at this clip that was supposedly "working as intended" https://www.twitch.tv/norththemage/clip/MoistIcyIguanaBCWarrior
---
I went on a date with his personal assistant. This isn’t far off.
---
You are just objectively wrong. It doesn't require any user thought because the strings and settings can easily be copied and pasted without knowing exactly what they do. There isn't much more required to get it to work.
---
I guess your argument could be that SOMEONE has to do the thinking, but then tens of thousands of sheeple don't.
---
It is a basic form of botting in the spirit of the law, even though it isn't in the letter.
---
you can get it playable for a $300 used laptop.  But you said medium settings minimum.
---
1st world kill in 2015?
---
It is, but it's relative and back in the day classic wow was actually sold on the idea that it was a more casual experience that could be played solo to a degree. Of course grouping up is more efficient but outside dungeons &amp; raids you don't need to interact if you don't want to, unlike everquest where it was "group up of gtfo" if you wanted to do anything.
---
Basically we planned that when a new server would be announced we would jump there :)
---
I loved my Druid then.
---
I’ve not really played a Druid since they split feral into two different talent trees.
---
Represent!
---
BLAM-OO
---
Without picking Mining beside of Eng you’ll going to have a gold sink I guess.
---
&gt; Even if you see a good deal in AH and you're far away, you would still need to get to AH and cancel whatever you were doing, with a chance that the item will already be sold.
---
Bank alt parked at the AH or second account that's always logged in parked at the AH.     
---
TSM makes it so easy to make gold in retail that you can easily afford a second wow account + tokens for both. This is a pretty common practice for people who know what they're doing.
---
There needs to be some moderation on what addons should be allowed and work in classic.   Simple quest helpers are fine, but addons that can and will destroy the economy should be left in retail WoW.
---
Exactly the point. That is exactly what Trump does. which was the delicious irony of someone getting frustrated about that. I was just trying to explain that I don't think you should be getting pissy about that type of behavior when you are blatantly supporting someone who exhibits that behavior.
---
Hell yeah, nice to see another GA resident ready to play! What server are you going to play on? My friends and I have tentatively decided on Thalnos.
---
"  Just because you do not enjoy bfa doesn't mean no one does &amp; no one  should be forced to play classic just because "hurr durr it's the  better game". "
---
uhh yeah... thats the joke.
---
Very large in relation to what? Last I checked, EVE peaks at around 30k.
---
Not with new content
---
All those things are bad yes. But all the good stuff outeweighs the bad easy! Its an imroved 60 imo. Not to crazy numbers in HP/DMG 
---
Many raids and pretty funny ones aswell.
---
Overall it feels like it a little bit more thought put in to it.
---
Finns are great &lt;3 Welcome to our nordic brethren.
---
Shhh
---
curious, do they all go one faction or spread out mixed?
---
wow lol I was tempted to ask him if he was planning on playing. Figured he wouldnt see the message. Super surprised he's going to play, but that's awesome.
---
Now with more info! Weapon list, Quest list, Weapon Skull trainers, updated Talent Tree and even a Sun-Tzu quote!
---
Also comes in Tauren [http://i.picpar.com/N0Ad.png](http://i.picpar.com/N0Ad.png) \- Troll [http://i.picpar.com/M0Ad.png](http://i.picpar.com/M0Ad.png) and Undead [http://i.picpar.com/O0Ad.png](http://i.picpar.com/O0Ad.png) variants, though I have NOT updated the text/talent choices, merely changed the backgrounds.
---
You can have it they suck without it.
---
everlook is filled to the brim.. but I think the second server should be RP-PVE since thats what the German classic community is really craving for...
---
on live there is even German RP servers than there is English ones.
---

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/csnr04/skeram_unofficial_discord_for_classic/). 
---
None of things were introduced during the classic period.
---
I meant things like the meeting stones that were introduced in 1.3. Classic WoW won't have a patch update schedule, but meeting stones would have happened in the middle of the "original" classic WoW timeframe. 
---
I'm not sure if they have commented on the update schedule for things that aren't raids or PvP systems. I didn't see anything with a quick google and wanted to see if they had.
---
He sent me some garbage like that too. I guess blocking him hides his message from my inbox and I'm too lazy to go find out how to undo that lol.
---
Well, now nobody will have to worry about the lack of access to abortions or birth control because nobody will be having sex for a while!
---
This is a meme, right 😅?
---
Looking forward to it! Some of the absolute best players I've played with were Fins :D
---
Me and 3 of my buddies from Toronto going Faerlina Horde. Stalagg looks like a weeb dream server so I'll be staying away from it.
---
&gt; Paladin/healer? What, consecrate? 
---
Retribution Aura and Blessing of sanctuary once you get it. Plus stuff like Reckoning, paladins can do a ton of AoE damage and tank quite efficiently.
---
" If all existing players on this server remain there, login queues in excess of 10,000 players are a certainty, and possibly much higher than that."
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/overcrowded-realm-update/255835
---
And a note of clarification, when I said "have playing on them" I meant logged in a peak times. You'd hear things like "private servers have 10k people on them and they just have dynamic respawns."
---
Ive done 4H lol and every full Naxx wing outside of it.
---
My guess is that IF you did these things you have improved immensely since and don't realize it. I would predict that every raid tier is cleared within 1 2 MAX days.
---
Look back at shit like Twin emps, that literally mauled guilds for awhile.. You literally kill scarabs and tank the bosses apart from each other.. Thats it.. 
---
Thaddius, walk to the other side with a charge.. Loatheb dont fuck up the heal rotation that you have immense communication and time/mods to help with. These are some of the bosses that took weeks to kill.
---
I dont know what drugs you're on, but i want some
---
Very nice. Anything similar for Priest or Mage?
---
4chan strikes again with their....... memes
---
Most people are lol, it's mostly just memes for humor and to fuel the hype train
---
That’s exactly where I got it from
---
I wonder how many celebrities play
---
Can you buy those posters?
---
What’s this « WoW2 » in the account field? I don’t have such field. Is it when one has two different accounts logged at the same time?
---
I do have « WoW1 » mentioned in the Classic login screen though, below my account name iirc.
---
If you are on fearlina. You gotta understand it's streamers all the way down. It is the premier streamer server. If you don't like that. I strongly recommend you choose a new server.
---
Not only could most classes not solo. Warriors and clerics were so dependent, just getting *to* the group was a trip you couldn't necessarily survive.
---
Much better. I always felt like it's was a subtle jab at classic in those memes so I'm glad to see this, thank you!
---
Horde seems like they might be joining us on Firemaw. They are having a metting right now.
---
We don’t know at all apart from surveys. It is very unlikely any pvp server will be worse than 65:35 (but that’s still pretty bad). There definitely won’t be any retail 95:5 nonsense.
---
There is no hard data but the pinned volontary census might help?
---
This post is a joke about [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/csczhn/the_first_pvp_kill_in_the_history_of_wow_closed/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) post. The point I’m making is that the modified time of the file, which this is using as evidence of it’s age, is not reliable because it can be manually set to any date.
---
this is a pro gamer move
---
And with it they 1 shot world bosses.
---
They even delayed the spell penetration trinkets in WSG until P5..
---
This is good news for Fairbanks (best server). I'm guessing it's still "High" and not "Full" (can't login from work to confirm). Now the pvp west overflow would spill into Blow Me (new pvp west server). If all goes according to plan, Fairbanks will remain high pop without queue issues like Herod.
---
That’s absolutely false. To assume that everyone subbing for classic will go for the newest non full server is insane.
---
Was he a scottish fella? I played on GB and rememeber playing with this guy - he always cracked me up.
---
They're saving those names for the last few servers to get more people to switch.
---
The Herod one isn't great either. It's run by a bunch of people who have no idea how to do permissions or bot settings on Discord. It seems like a group of friends who thought it would be cool to own an "official" server.
---
One thing nobody appears to have mention is that a leveling warrior has a hard time getting out of bad situations. In many fights if you pull one mob too many you will die unless you are skilled or lucky. Other classes expose themselves less (ranged pulling), have CC or can get away (Rogue Vanish) while the warrior just takes it!
---
Who else would keep blizzard in check so they don't fuck the game up?  We should at least have a little say.  Personally I want new classic content
---
It's a form of  advertising, Blizzard letting tens of thousands of viewers see Asmongold wait in queue for hours  just not gonna happen.
---
Also playing for the first time.  Very hyped.  So many friends who have played the game before are rolling on the same server.  Should be a great time!!
---
Will ally ever get any love?
---
Will Alliance ever get any love?
---
You will want more than just Iron Grenades from engineering. But do as you please, id maybe keep skinning to 60 and do all professions you wanna do at 60.
---
There are no "designated servers" for social groups.  Stop worrying about it,  log in and have fun.
---
so just raids?
---
Press F to doubt
---
I've said it before and I'll say it again. You gain nothing by joining a wow discord but pure cancer. I dont know why anyone would like to pick this shit.
---
This is not correct at all.
---
Hey does anyone knows if Skeram is located in the central US datacenter? Because I get about 30 less ms there than playing in the one wich is located in LA, and considering I'm playing from sa 30 ms is a lot for me.
---
Blizz never gives us info like this and i never have understood why. It would be really nice to be able to see faction balance on the server select screen. I am sure Blizz knows these numbers
---
I imagine a 100 little elves running around a Blizzard shop and everything is on fire.
---
shouldn't have changed. chances are you won't be playing until the 27th anyways
---
This is false. Its not hard to coordinate and its pretty easy. Absolutely no need for engineering items at all.
---
Am I the only one that pictured Louie C.K. while listening to this?
---
Played rogue in vanilla and *only reason* I was able to get into raids was because my brother was the warlock group leader in his guild. So no. 
---
Dwarf female rogue was the most rare combination in vanilla.
---
Gotta give it back to you Danes, had a blast with you guys on private servers. 🇩🇰🇫🇮
---
Once I'm in I'm never leaving!
---
Again, because it isn't contested doesn't make it true.  Asking the forum - no offense - is a completely unrealistic way to poll the entire beta community.  Day 1 was a blood bath of pvp raids and low level killing.
---
And come on...everyone was running lowbies to the opposing zones the first day.  I did it.  Entire raids did it.
---
I completely believe you were killing people on the first day.  I was too.  I just don't believe anyone who claims they were first.
---

---
Should hopefully address the various issues people have had with this cheat sheet. 
---
I'll probably be creating a Warlock and Hunter one soon-ish, as I'm planning on playing those classes when Classic hits, but don't hold me to it. Took me long enough to edit this one! ♥
---
Pretty much.   Wouldnt be hard to script. (Although it would take away from what classic was)  Lvl 10 mobs by day, lvl 60 undead at night.  I suppose it would make more sense for Duskwood to be like this.
---
Plus, in EQ, one day was 1 hour (plus or minus) so it affected everyone.  In WoW, Azeroth time = real time so some players never experience  night or vise-versa.
---
Slightly better class balance and subjectively ‘funnier’ raids definitely do not outweigh the bad things about TBC.
---
What did you like so much about it?  I played at launch but it was a bit buggy and never went back to it.  Did it end up being a good game?
---
Appalling that youre this salty about the servers. I think you have severe anxiety.
---
A good online marketing campaign has high accuracy rates for targeting. People subbed here already know the game is coming out.
---
They do not.
---
It's the house of a friend. He just says that the Provider sucks and he has more knowledge about PCs and Internet than me..
---
Meh, no one has any idea at all what Classic will be like in 3 months. If there is any sort of collapse of a realm population blizzard will merge or have free transfers or something. You definitely will not be stuck on a dead realm.
---
Grinding ghouls and shit in EPL, after respec to holy priest.  Those kills took forever.
---
I think business-wise Classic should be kept as different from Retail as possible. Targeting two different audiences is better than targeting the same audience twice.
---
Perfect thank you!
---
I think it was unlimited, all I remember is that everyone was shocked we got it, but we had some really organized people in our raid
---
Yea that’s my point. X realm wasn’t added until after Naxx yet they’re releasing it from the get go &amp; yet they’re delaying those WSG trinkets until P5 from the Vendor.
---
I'd rather watch original content that's inspired by Warcraft, especially an Arthas level story.
---
This is good.  Now I think we're starting to get into the realm of what should have been announced initially.  It's good they are continuing to role them out.  Hopefully people will spread without too much reluctance or inconvenience.   
---
I still think they are going to need even more medium/low pop servers to take the launch day crowd though.  So yeah, still need more.  Especially if these two are high by the weekend...  
---
Doesn't appear that Stalagg changed anything about Herod either.
---
Water and Fruit.
---
Some Skyr for protein.
---
unlucky man
---
I love the interaction of wanting to learn this incredible spell that summons a demonic horse on fire for me to ride across the world, and that I have to go on an epic quest “if I dare” to master this spell. The fact that I have to ask for the help of my friends to delve into multiple dungeons and defeat tough foes to make it all happen will make this a rewarding milestone as I hit level 40, and again when I hit level 60. 
---
When it comes to minor interactions, I’m honestly looking forward to fishing in stranglethorn to level my secondary professions while having my voidwalker chilling next to me - not for looks, but for the fact that Stranglethorn is ACTUALLY dangerous due to monsters and other players alike. “Contested zone” means something here, and I’ll need to be on my toes and ready for when a troll rogue sneaks up and tries to take me out, or a band of orc players questing together decides its my time to die. Stranglethorn Vale, when explored at the appropriate level, is a dangerous place! It’s an exciting zone to enter knowing that the possibilities are endless and that there’s a seaside pirate town on the coast.
---
 *cue Booty bay music*
---
Epl I believe
---
Lol look at this little poor bitch that can’t afford 8 dollars. Get a job, scrub.
---
I'm actually looking forwards to waiting in the queue while on discord with my friends, that's a once in a lifetime event! No more classic releases planned!
---
I sure hope not!
---
I am pretty sure most server is running a discord channel and a pool to determine the balance. On the French server it's currently 47% alliance/53% horde with 2k votes and it's consistent with every pool done this the announcement of classic wow. 
---
By experience of private servers, i'd say with those numbers that horde will have 1h queue BG (even with Xrealm bg) for sure and dominate world pvp. It's a fact that Horde attract more wanabe pvp players because of the easy/op racials.
---
Anyway, as long as you don't join server of a certain streamer, you should be safe to have a close to 50/50 balance, except that wont change that Horde is gonna stomp alliance in world pvp.
---
Winterspring killing timbermaw i even specifically know what one and where he spawns.
---
I think this sample captures the more hardcore WoW base, potentially underestimating those that will be subbing for WoW Classic.
---
FAKE NEWS, read the chat
---
Well aren’t you just a ray of sunshine.
---
I can see that -- the 1 hour limit was a really artificial limitation that kept BWL as uncleared as possible on release.
---
3 months after release
---
&gt;Require little raid consumables to pull near optimal DPS
---
 Require little raid consumables to pull near optimal DPS  is just bs
---
Someone is salty they didn’t get their name. And FYI we arnt “desperate” we are excited.
---
Second this, I really like the cashew raisin mixes and ice cold water. I can go so far on these maybe with other food mixed in like meal prep stuff so it's just a reheat and back to the game.
---
Probably buy them seperate not premixed on nut raisins though as you want more nuts than raisins. Better sugar content and no crash.
---
This is why multiboxers didn’t dominate 5v5 arenas
---
I'm closing on 46 and I'm on reddit :D
---
Was already 30+ when vanilla wow hit the stores.
---
Not cheap AF, you're right not to spend 5$ in naming a character lol. Plus, you get to choose non-exploding-with-population servers!
---
No one likes bfa, not even kids
---
Good lord if Ashbringer was a EST PvP server it'd become full in an instant.
---
Other hardcore mechanics, yes. But permadeath seems antithetical to most of the fun of an MMO: watching a character you stick with for a long time progress. Starting from scratch is something for arena games.
---
Damn I wonder how sad I would be if I was a person like this
---
deader
---
Snowflakes melt easily.
---
No idea, it's something that was a topic of debate when it was developed as well, but I guess it isn't simply due to the fact that there isn't any interactions done that doesn't require you to do stuff manually (a.k.a botting). With exception to the "shows what the item's current value is" which is done by simply having their app on your computer.
---
So while you can AFK in AH with sniper mode on, you still have to purchase the items that show up manually, so you can't just leave it running, go AFK and have it buy stuff for you.
---
you will see it go live, no need to reload
---
Are we serious with all this? All of a sudden WoW Classic drops and we don’t have a sense of what “food” is anymore?
---
Guys, this game doesn’t revolutionize the food industry. The same shit you ate before as a light snack is still at Stop N Shop. There’s not some speed leveler out there eating Swifty sponsored Hot Pockets: Ragnaros Limited Edition Hot Sandwiches.
---
Are you looking for healthy food options? Why here? Google is. There are literally hundreds of thousands of articles for “easy, healthy, and quick snacks”.
---
Godspeed brother.
---
At least they're not also a rogue.
---
What do you think how long will the q time be one day after launch? 
---
On the stresstest In had to wait 2 hours, and that was worldwide.. on the other Hand are all the people without an early subscription missing.. hmm.
---
Raytracing + ESRGAN would be even better.
---
fruits and veggies bb. slap some hummus or a dip on that shit and u poppin
---
water is the best drink in every walk of life
---
Shh, don't tell anyone.
---
Neither of those artists has been popular for 5-10 years
---
So one might assume that the more dedicated and experienced players will be on the first pvp servers and the more casual players will be on the new ones. 
---
I wonder how the experience will differ.
---
As someone who got the 9 names I wanted, I would recommend spam connect/reconnect until you see the servers up.
---
Pong! Played that in kindergarten when our teacher took his pc to our class and showed it :D
---
Holy crap these are cool
---
2007 Runescape has grown and overtook the main game.
---
70 raiding requires infinitely more skill and awareness. But that’s not the point. You keep coming back to class balance and raiding because you don’t realize what truly makes an mmo fun to play, and it’s not raiding.
---
FYI, Bow Skill is less important for ranged attack power relative to weapon skill racials for melee. I'm still going Troll on my hunter.
---
I'm maining Mage, with alt hunter and alt Shaman. Shaman provides healing fun, hunter is great for playing at 60 without needing to gear up as much as the mage. Mage is the main since it maxes DPS at all tiers.
---
If you're just picking 1 and want to prioritize solo play and 5 mans, I'd go Hunter. You can solo way more stuff
---
Having a hunter pet would totally ruin this challenge, ammo notwithstanding.
---
I don't think you quite understand what i mean. But nevrmind that because you're also right, many useless things are often very interesting to many. I myself, don't care much for world history either, but many go nuts on it and love it. Mostly i care for history when it has lessons.
---
The top is all that really matters, WoW's difficulty floor was always beneath the basement. My friend Linda started playing back in Vanilla, and I came over a few weeks after she started to install some add ons for her, and it turns out she was running at about 6 FPS on an ancient laptop. I found it virtually unplayable, but she'd been trucking along, getting things done. The game was functionally fail-proof. All you needed was time and persistence. A level 1 EQ character who died frequently would still be a level 1 EQ character regardless of how many rats they killed. WoW has always been a gentle game.
---
It certainly does a "better" job now of gilding the skill floor in all kinds of pomp and fanfare, showering them with loot, hand holding them through dungeons and raids in LFR/LFD mode, making world content so numbingly easy that you actually have to look around to find things that might threaten you. That's all true. But the variations between easy and piss-easy don't seem terribly interesting to me. WoW's skill ceiling is much higher than it used to be, which is usually the barometer we use to judge whether or not something counts as "a hard game".
---
IE: XCOM. People consider XCOM to be a hard game, but on easy mode it is functionally baby's first tactics game. A dog with mittens on its paws could skate through. With Long War installed, or even on simple Legendary, it's a ball breaking nightmare.
---
It's always about the skill ceiling.
---
You could always go to a gaming café? No doubt they'll have classic installed.
---
If you kept questing after 15, the lack of exp gain was compensated by currency.
---
It’s probably people who actually have friends irl. It’s pretty annoying if once you get your friends to agree on a server and they all get names they like and make them all switch.
---
Well when should Blizzard lock full servers then?
---
The only winning move is not to play.
---
They clearly did not.  11 servers were announced for NA.  That's absurd.  Barely would support 50k players in NA once everything settles out.
---
The servers are already live, they just haven’t enabled logins. More than likely there’ll be a small launch patch and few d/c’s and restarts in the first hour or two. The only secret is to be lucky.
---
Is there a mage version.
---
I forgot that he used to play wow
---
Everquest 2 also did a good job
---
Thanks, that's very helpful.  I notice he has a lot of suggested weapons that aren't axes.  Any idea how much of an upgrade you'd need to justify switching from an axe to a non-axe?
---
I know name reserving is hard for a lot of people because there's a huge rush and I know that I lucked out getting mine on Stalagg. Every once in a while I see people bring up how fast they were able to create their character while still losing their name and I just have to wonder, why? 
---
Don't touch the customization options. Don't. Not even race/faction. I have no sympathy for anyone who "lost" their name whlie dicking around with the options. You can customize later. During the initial rush all that should matter during name reservation is the name reservation. My friends and I all have somewhat desirable names. When Stalagg opened we all tried to reserve our main names then the mains of each other to make sure no one else took them. Then a few days later after the rush we just juggled names and did our customizing. 
---
This shouldn't even have had to have been said but I've seen comments complaining about it and that probably means there's plenty of people who didn't comment who are in the same boat. Don't customize your character during the RACE FOR NAME RESERVING.
---
who are you calling a slag buddy
---
the servers still have a limit, regardless of layers.
---
the layering is just to stop 5000 people fighting over lvl1 wolves in the start area.
---
The fees do apply to classic, various costs associated with hosting a game have to be paid by someone, blizzard isn’t a charity.
---
Why rank up cleave? I thought the bonus damage is paltry.
---
Why am I choosing a decrease in casting speed to 1 v 1 a priest?  Especially if I’m a better mage.
---
Do what's fun man! Warriors ain't bad at all. I'd go warrior. Can guarantee people will need tanks more than DPS.. warriors do both those roles, rogues do one
---
Its not since players cant ever play more than 1 character per account, if someone reserved names on 3 servers sure, they are being counted once per server, but most people did all 3 names on the same server
---
It's hard, but it's not as hard as Blizzard is making it look.
---
If you don't like pet micromanagement then I would really recommend skipping hunter.
---
Hunter has a hard time finding a group indeed.
---
Mages do not destroy chats, they are mediocre until AQ comes out then they do well/top. 
---
Hunters are more overplayed than mages.
---
Troll for pve, orc/undead for pvp. Generally I would advice going pvp racials if you have any intent do pvp, because they make a massive difference, where as doing a bit more dps isn't a big deal.
---
Yeah I think I'll go with this.  I agree with your point on precision.  Okay!  This seems good thank you :)
---
shhh, muh names
---
Be a hunter.  Look up a 1-10 lvling guide, and the lvl 10 tame pet quest.  After that just keep pressing autoshoot and sending your pet until you hit 60.
---
Also 1 dot
---
The best part is because you used the regular talent tree art i can crop in my own build
---
THanks!
---
OSRS has also added a lot of new content, hasn't it?  Last I heard that was not the plan for Classic - they're not even sure they'll be re-adding the old content/expansions beyond Vanilla.
---
If Classic starts getting brand new raids added, then yes, the numbers change and the pool opens again.
---
The power of alt-tab!
---
That would destroy the whole community feel of vanilla which to many is the aspect of vanilla that they are looking forward to the most. 3-5 thousand is perfect
---
For the challenge.. it’s not broken there is nothing a multiboxer can do they you and 4 of your friends can’t do.. in fact it’s like playing with 4 of your friends that are terrible at the game cos they don’t move on there own accord and really slow on sheeps
---

That's a good vending. Maybe we can use that in another kommentar!
---
Earn money with TSM, buy longboi, earn money anywhere
---
Sweet spot is 3k server pop
---
OSRS hasn't raised the level up since it came out and I dont think a single soul with a reasonable mind has complained about it. They just add content and make mostly tiny changes.
---
Thalnos is already listed as full.
---
Should’ve had a scorpion
---
Nothing against them, they can do their own thing. But if i go to play pick-up ball and 1 team is 4 people from rupaul drag race, and 1 team has 4 men, I wont be joining with rupaul's team. I guess it does make me uncomfortable.
---
I might at some point in the future

Here are updated macros for classic. This is a good resource as a lot of previous ones I have found would no longer work in classic as they contained “if/then” statements. 
---

---
If you dont use DKP are you really playing classic wow!?
---
College starts on the 26th uhgggg
---
Yeah f that August 27th, 2019 sounds way better.
---
From what I've seen most people are opposed to raising the level cap, instead wanting more horizontal progression.
---
Very entertaining story, I was equally addicted back then, and can relate on ditching everything just for a little playtime. Crazy how that works, right? Hope you'll have as much fun this time around as you did back then!
---
Playing a Shaman, I'm going to probably need to run Resto to raid, which means my #1 priority of farming gold for my epic mount will have to be done by farming herbs/potions/flasks to sell.
---
By "launch" , I mean character creation and name reservation.
---
Oh well..
---
I'd really love a Classic-fied Death Knight class to be honest.
---
LOL! Good one

My friend who got me hyped for classic wow back a few months ago just recently passed away from a long battle with cancer, rip Northy!
---
True though
---
How is that so much effort? you legit just stand on fire and lose to a duel by a mage casting frostbolt on you. This is like what, 10 seconds total? Drowning takes way longer to die.
---
Everything's coming up Grobbulus.
---
People still play retail? Lol jokes aside. NO.
---
Tbh I wouldn't want realm discords setup by Blizz either.
---
It's a shame the type of people that you want running a community are never the ones to rush to start one.
---
If you don’t know the optimal way to play both classes during each phase it means you’re speaking from a place of misconceptions.  It would be anecdotal if I wasn’t a top tier healer (Casual/vodka).
---
Nope no balance tweaks. But it’s not a carbon copy of vanilla and they will change a few things:
---
Classic will run on the new BFA client.
---
Classic will have battle.net integration. 
---
Layering will be a thing for phase 1.
---
Ty
---
I think you severely underestimate the powerspike of Improved Overpower. That talent is crazy. Agreed with Impale tree, but Deep Wounds + Improved OP is a pretty solid combo. I personally will be going arms from the get go, to save a respec at 30. I have been playing around with it and it feels at least as fast as fury. I also think 3 points in parry is better than 3 points in Craze.
---
The Tauren one mad it right onto my 2nd monitor
---
Evolution of combat is the first bit of RS3. Lots of arguments for what actually hurt RS3 - microtransactions being one of the bigger ones.
---
All I'm saying is, we'll have to wait and see with Classic. I think we'll see some real play.
---
Im glad you're happy where yer at too.
---
Yeah, I loved The Man from Uncle. For some reason, it really reminded me of [No One Lives Forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SwqdNQ9vEk).
---
168 hours, yahooooooo.
---
A lot more fun then if I were on a pvp server.  PvP servers are only fun for those at the top who play hardcore, not for the casual tourist.
---
Reminds me of when a young person asked  "What did we have before google maps?"... "Maps."... "No I said before Google maps."
---
They didn't know that physical maps even existed.  So the OLD FOLKS want to have their printed, (but save the ink because we're responsible), 'physical' map of ingame even though it's available for free in digital form.
---
Got to remember classic players skew to the older side.  "REMEMBER WHEN WE COULD HOLD A MAP!"
---
Most people do.  He played Superman and is playing Geralt in the Witcher.
---
A lot of us :p CHARGEE!!
---
Definitely early on. Even RP players just want to level and get the hell out of noob zones. Not much RP going on and certainly no guilds formed yet.

I wonder if anyone already made some sort of achievement addon similar to Retail Achievements but simple and offline. Nothing that syncs over the internet or anything but just something that tracks achievements for you personally.
---
So, you're saying I should grind boars in Elwynn. Gotcha.
---
Hope this is a good decision and we end up with a great community on Firemaw!
---
And since you spent all that time, your preferred character name is now taken, and now you're stuck on trying to find a character name that's still available.
---
There's a lot of us.

"Hey guys we should make plans for what to do if they open new servers. They said they weren't opening any new ones until Stalagg as full, which means we can probably expect some when Stalagg fills up. If no servers are released between now and launch then we stay on Herod."
---
Seems to me this is going the way Blizzard intends. The people that don't want 5 hour queues have widened up and fled.
---
I would bet Blizzard does a couple more new servers at release as well, could go for one of those if they do. Remember that the current population numbers are only from the people already subscribed and reserving names, many people haven't done that yet.
---
we must also consider that the people creating accounts now are probably the same that took time off work etc. to play for extended amounts of time. 
---
that means that the queue won't decrease fast -- people will stay logged in
---
Ye olde meme
---
Perfect*
---
Duh...
---
This survey says 48% of people intending on playing don't have a sub (question is around halfway down). 50k is a pretty good sample size, albeit reddit is a biased source. &lt;shrug&gt; it's as good as we'll get.

I’ve been looking for ping information on servers... how can you tell where they are physically located? If I’m in Dallas are the EST the best bet for me?
---
Same Discord as I posted, just a different link! See you guys in there

I was under the impression that it still required manual input for actually going through with a purchase / listing? If it auto-buy and auto-sells fully, wouldn't that just be botting and be grounds for a ban?
---
HUNTER TOOK MY BOOTS Skeram-a Jam
---
It's pretty shitty to gamble your friend's free time because of a name.
---
Considering that medium means 4x as populated as the old high population realms I think if population is your only consideration then just go with whatever is the lowest.
---
Every server is going to be super crowded by 2004 standards.
---
Jokes on you, any fucker who can roll on my Savage Gladiator Chain / Hand of Justice / Ironfoe will not have a place in my group :D
---
Go a mix of disc / shadow until 40 and then Respec into shadowform. Instance healing is fine

Yes, lol - that would keep confused NA players out. You still sound like a miffed Brexiteer here.

---
Wait, can I get a tldr of what the previous drama was about?
---
Eh, I was there for Legion launch and it was quite smooth
---
Has Blood Craze and Enrage been tested in Classic? Does it PROC off mobs or is it just off PVP?
---
Your comment was a better advertisement than his.
---
The subreddit has 120k. I thought it was like 250,000 people playing, but I'm probably wildly off.
---
or just roll rogue
---
&gt;best estimates are that at most, maybe 10% of the server population is non-English speaking.
---
Best estimate?  From what?  The only poll that I've seen had it at 20% LA+BR (Spanish and Portuguese as a first language) on that server.  And that was taken on an English speaking discord so there will be a natural skew towards English speaking players.
---

Holy shit 10? I thought my server was low to okayish pop and we had 3 raiding guilds of which only 2 cleared BWL. Starting to realize mine wasn't low it was dead..

I'm already doing a no shave 'til Classic challenge that started 3 weeks ago with EsfandTV on Twitch. I'm embracing my full neckbeardedness.

I deleted a level 60 Paladin just because I hate playing Paladin and my friend was like, “why don’t you delete her then?” So I did for the lols.
---
Still hate Paladins.
---
Makes sense, night time was always going to be my time anyway. I'm about to take 6 weeks leave while my wife goes back to work so I figure I'll be able to squeeze in some leveling while the kid naps during the day but after that it's post-bedtime gaming for me.
---
My only concern isn't 1v1 or even small groups. I promise you it's be a huge raid group everywhere you go fighting you.
---
Playing with friends in BfA? Must be a new feature LOL

'Drop everything to login and reserve a name'

If I were to do the grind I would pick a class with a very good easier to obtain weapon and aim for 13 and forgo the full grind.  A warlord Shadow Priest with Anathema or something like that.  R14 is no joke, hell 13 isn’t one either.
---
I abandoned a level 5 barbarian because I got lost in a cave and had no light source. Humans and barbarians were brutal at night, but I kind of enjoyed that part. Made it feel so real, especially in Kithicor (sp).

There is nothing a multiboxer can do better than 5 actual players.. 
---
Pvp... 5 players should easier take down a multiboxer group
---
Doing a dungeon.. 5 players will finish it much faster
---
Grinding some gold.. 5 players will grind more, faster
---
Committed multiboxers do it for the challenge of playing a full group through difficult content.. doing a dungeon as dps tank and healer when your controlling all of them yourself it a very difficult challenge that requires a lot of coordination and interesting strategy that can be a lot of fun..
---
Multiboxing 5 shamans and going around doing 5 earth shocks on someone out in the world is cheap and not very rewarding. It gets old very quickly and not worth paying 75 bucks a month for..  but that is going to happen almost never compared so some loser rogue much higher level than you stun lock killing you

---
But things like flying, faster leveling, increasing level caps, content obsolescence, and LFG do. Anything built off Wrath is going to be closer to Retail than anything built off Classic.

In fact the first couple weeks are going to be a shit show anyway, I'm sure.
---
You completely misjudged that one decision you made today. Ya that one, the one I know nothing about and have no information on. However I am confident you completely misjudged it. 
---
Don't get me wrong, your problem that I know no details of is a good one to have. But ultimately assumptions need to be made made based on information I do not have, nor researched. Your assumptions about this decision are off to a really poor start.
---
Maybe if you told me all of the details about your decision I could make my own assumptions about your decision and decide to toss blame at you publicly without having any facts.
---

---
Yup, pretty well every Sunday for 13 years.
---
I'm not sure it would benefit WoW as much as you may think. WoW's visuals rely almost entirely on the art style of which lighting is a huge part, changing to a different lighting system would change the entire look of the game. I also think there's the possibility that the performance impact could actually be too big in a lot of scenarios. Think about all the spell effects and other dynamic light sources that would need to be handled.
---
Ray tracing is cool but I don't think Classic WoW is the right place for it, nor is the available hardware good enough for it to be commonly used yet.
---
It seems like this is more geared towards arms warriors. Is there a version of this for fury?
---
Here are some more that I’ve found:

Alright, this is stupid. There are good players and bad players everywhere, nationality or language have nothing to do with this at all, it is a game that requires human skills, as in huamn beings. Any human being can be good or bad at it. 
---
Do you seriously believe that most people that speak English is good at the game just for speaking English?
---
If you do, than that's plain xenophobia.
---
Oh I totally spaced on Saph! Right!
---
It’s completely true. Fury/Leather Warrior was never really viable until BWL+. Mortal Strike is a beast at 40 and continues to be well into endgame.

that depends on the build really. sometimes the rage is worth it when you feel like it but usually you are right

I believe he means, how do you accurately predict server populations when people name reserve across 3? You know they will only play a max of 1, but you don't know which.
---
Do they? Citation needed.
---
Yea it's not just a streamer server. It's THE streamer server lol. That being said almost every realm is a good choice they are all brimming with people. As far as I know there isn't another streamer server as they all went to the same place. About the only thing I can advise would be to avoid Herod as well. It has no streamers but blizz is saying the log in que for that server is estimated to be between 10,000-,100,000 people. Big swing but either way none of it's good if you actually wanna play. 
---
Blizzard went on the side of too few servers over too many. So it's hard to pick a bad server. Like I said they are all filling up fast.
---
Holy shit all of these years I thought it was Dus**k**wallow Marsh...
---
I thought all the Nordic players already moved from Shazz to whatever the last new realm was called..
---
The owner of this one seems legit, had a good little chat and offered my help. I'm now moderating it. It has only 37 users and slowly growing. I'll do my best to keep the server clean from the scummy people. We'll see where we end up eventually! I just hope we become a better community then Shazzrah ! ;p
---
But you also forget that there are a lot of BFA players subbed right now who were able to reserve their name, but have no intention to play long term.

---
Not the author, but that wouldn't be a bad idea. Really, it's up to you.
---
Blizzard should have just tweaked the numbers to have a psychological effect on players. Like make the realm say “Full” way before it was actually full. They messed up.
---
I totally agree, I seriously don't have time to spend 4 hours to do one dungeon now that I'm an adult. They should definitely do the lfg option where you create one and people apply or whatever, and you can still pick and choose, and it could still be server or "layer" only. That way you build a group without spamming chat. I'm fine with no LFR because even retails LFR is useless, but the normal dungeons were such a time sink back then that I can't afford now, just so you can have your gear not drop yet again.
---
I dont think they exist in Sweden anymore, havent seen one in years.
---
Looking at playing this exact same hybrid class myself, with goal of AoE grinding, Healing raids and tanking 5 mans (for fun not for gear).
---
About to test it out on Retro wow sk will get back to ya!
---
Nice Rework. Saved.
---
Allowing xfers, definitely.  Throws the established server community out of whack and most people probably won’t take the bait cause they’re playing on that server with their friends/guild/etc.  Makes more sense to merge.
---
If you invite someone to your guild and they bring like 4-5 friends, you are probably going to lose half your guild in a few months.

No he's trying to trick you it goes live the 27th
---
Been quite a while since I played, but last figures I saw were from like Feb of this year. I saw mention of average players from like 800-1500, might've meant systems instead of servers, my bad.
---
I know it's not a lot but I don't really think people that only want to play classic should pay $15.  Retail gets tons of new content to justify the sub price.  And while they certainly spent money on Classic, the value isn't there for me personally.
---
I'm still on the fence as I don't really want to do raiding this time around and they chose a lame version of AV to force on us.
---
I prefer the model where leveling to the cap is free but you have to sub to participate in endgame.  It's just a personal thing after all of these years and seeing what else is offered out there.  I just prefer an MMO where I can return to the world at any time and only pay if I want to partake in endgame and the newest content.
---
When do they come out. They said 6pdt
---
Thank you very much! ♥
---
Sometimes I'm unsure and think about rolling priest but I always come back to locks. Definitely gonna play my orc warlock and later if it ever gets boring I'll level an alt
---
Just cos trying to get 5 people to coordinate is hard doesn’t mean you can’t do it.. and when they do they will smash the multiboxer
---
It's 99.9999% a joke. There will always be that 0.0001% of people that are just bat-shit crazy, but you're gonna see that with at least everything. You can't let it bother you otherwise you won't be able to play any game.
---
Waking up, getting kids to school - go to work, get off the minute that server launches (honestly this is amazing that it launches at the same time, dont even have to call off lol)
---
The night before is going to be more eventful than the day of. I have to get stocked up on energy drinks and find someone who can sell me enough crack to keep me awake for a week.
---
Getting my hyacinth macaw again. That was always my favorite achievement as a kid, I really grinded for that thing and loved showing it off. It was by far the prettiest pet.
---
I should. I probably won't be able to get on anyway. I get home from work about 5 Pacific, servers will probably still be bad even when I get home
---
Ya that’s what smart people do. Amazing so many people are taking the first week off of work. That’s just one week out of months you’ll be playing, no reason besides unable to control excitement  to rush it like that.
---
Thanks. Did not see this before

"Relative realm population will be visible in-game to help in choosing a realm so you will see Low, Medium, or High in the realm selection screen. If there are high numbers of players congregating on individual realms during name reservation and character creation, we will post warnings about the potential for queues on those realms, giving you time to choose alternate realms."
---
Blizzard also posted...
---
"As of now, a large number of WoW Classic characters have been created on the following realms. Players with characters on this realm are likely to experience severe queues at release."
---
Faerlina - PvP
---
Herod - PvP
---
Pagle - Normal
---
Thalnos - PvP
---
Whitemane - PvP
---
And they posted...
---
"While we are able to fit several times more players on a single realm in 2019 than was the case in 2006, we are not going to raise that cap any further, even though we have the technical capacity to do so. Raising realm caps would simply forestall the problem, letting more players in at launch but creating an unsustainable situation down the line, with severe queues when we turn off layering permanently before Phase 2 of our content unlock plan."
---
"Please also note that our realm population estimates of Low, Medium, High, and Full are based on this increased capacity – a Medium realm today already has more characters on it than even the most crowded realms did back in 2006."
---
Tldr: No
---
If hearth is on cooldown the unstuck button kills you.
---
I came form Lineage 2, the first dude to hit the level cap on launch spent 6 weeks playing 16 hours a day just to get from level 74 to 75(the cap).  That last level alone took longer than leveling 2 or 3 toons to 60 in WoW.  
---
And anyone could decide to kill you at any time for any reason.  And they often did, which would lose you ~5% xp, at higher levels it was easily days worth of farming lol.
---
Ah, my mistake.
---
good luck with that
---
Hey nong man

---
If you want a server with less hardcore players, the newest servers will have less hardcore people on them.  Which is one of the reasons why I don't want to move to a newer server.
---
I've spent hundreds on F2P games I really like, but they allow me to go long periods without paying, but still play if I so choose.  The WOW sub feels too restricting and there are far better models out there these days.
---
Its part of the classic experience
---
The book is all about how WoW came to be.
---
If he really likes vanilla as you said, he will like it. No background in the videogames industry is required at all (else tbh the book wouldn't have sold this much). Just love for the game.

Ever been in a long line at the grocery store and the people in front of you start looking at the other lines to see if they’re moving faster and some of them even leave for those lines?
---
People are going to move on launch day provided queues exist.
---
That's awesome, looking forward to seeing you guys around :) or fighting you, as the case may be
---
How is that his loss?
---
Understand that 75% of GM problems are caused by people, so if you're not good at handling people then you need to git gud IMMEDIATELY.
---
no - you are getting new raids and content in retail - that content was already made for classic.
---
No, I mean it was already posted multiple time on this subreddit
---
lmao.
---
WoW is not a hard game. It's really fucking easy compared to mobas like dota and counterstrike. I got 2400 arena rating my first pvp season of wow and completed vashj with my guild pre-nerf. The PVE is so easy and the PVP only slightly harder.
---
Hell yea brother
---
&gt;All of this community run shit is mostly set up by power hungry people. 
---
The same goes for any moderated community, including reddit subs.
---
You have to ask yourself: what incentive structure is there for someone to pour in so much effort into moderating and enforcing a community with no financial gain?
---
It's typically a power trip. Same with Facebook groups, discord servers, etc.
---
It's not very productive to join "server discords" anyway.
---
Vanilla WoW is about meeting people inside the World of Warcraft. As you meet more and more people in-person, you will form communities and guilds, and then those *de facto* communities will form discords.
---
Trying to make a discord community now is putting the cart before the horse.
---
Was mostly swedish guilds.
---
But the shitshow that will be launch is part of the enjoyment.
---
Salty? I'm laughing at you, not salty at all. It's hilarious seeing a WoW nerd wait long for a game and then say "well part of the fun is running back to my corpse and watching youtube!!" Like gimme a break, it's obvious you know you're wrong and just being stubborn trying to win an anonymous internet argument.
---
I always get a good laugh when people say Druids aren’t ideal.
---
I'm not saying you HAVE to use a bow but not using one is going to handicap your DPS. 
---
Did you consider the +hit talent for hunters? I believe it's the standard talent build before reaching hit cap through hear alone.
---
Losing other stats in favor of +gun skill seems problematic since an exception to the general rule prioritizing +hit is most prevelant at lower gear points - it seems like your doubling down on this issue.
---
I have a 7 year old now. Maybe I'll level fishing for literally the first time ever.

Nice!  There will be updates too.  3 hours should be good.

I’d like to see if there’s a correlation between age and class/race/faction. Maybe see if older players switch their class more or tank more. Just some data on the topic I’d wish I could visualize...
---
Ok great!  I’m so hyped to play classic and actually enjoy an mmo again
---
I joined a new guild about 6 weeks ago, after being away from the game for years. They've been awesome at helping me level up, get into mythics, pvp, and grind out the allied races I wanted to unlock. Last weekend I won the guild lotto and have been buying all the lowbies full sets of heirlooms.
---
Just sayin'
---
Since I'm paying a sub anyways, I might take a peek at retail sometimes. Maybe do some transmog/mount runs. Even though I don't like the direction the game went, I still have a lot of attachment to my characters.
---
This. Why else would they do it? Its exposure the minute the servers are live.
---
It's a good thing that the people in this sub aren't the ones in charge or server roll-out.  I guarantee Blizzard is playing 3D underwater hungry hungry hippos with the numbers.
---
Winterspring
---
Where did you hear any news about them getting to skip queues? And how would that even work?
---
Play the game. I'm logging on the first SECOND they go live. Just have to pray to the internet gods I don't DC
---
Likewise! For the Alliance!
---
&gt; You can say "who cares, it's just a name" but vanilla WoW was huge for name recognition. If you don't get a name you're "proud" of, it does diminish your classic experience.
---
This statement is cancer on cancer and I am having difficulty describing how much I hate it.
---
That's true, there was just something epic about 40man raids that 25 never captures. Frankly I think vanilla had it right with the 20/40 split, 40 for that epic feel and 20 for the closer knit group. The biggest fail of vanilla IMO was not releasing a new 20 man when Nax came out.
---
Mamma mia
---
I'm a bigger fan of the Schnozz hiding out between cabinets, but the sword is sick too
---
Maybe that's what they're doing
---
The amount of times you die and get ganked, I'd say 100-150 is a good number. Especially with how full the servers are, even with layering, on a PVP server it's going to be a bloodbath
---
You get curse of recklessness early i think around lvl 10ish, Will give the war a good dps boost.

You respawn with all your stuff in AC and the night vision wasn't nearly as much of a big deal. You're right about character creation being much more complicated with the possibility to ruin your build.

If you wanna imagine an NPC on Launch Day, look no further than Teldrassil. Denalan is an NPC that, when someone offers him a simple package quest item, he has a 5-10 second break to say thank you and put his earth sample in his planter. During these 5-10 seconds, you cannot hand in or accept quests from Denalan.
---
Good luck, Night Elves.

Well in 2 weeks we will have "The Snappening" where 1/2 of WoW classic players disappear.
---
Following is 100% necessary they get out of sync almost immediately when moving around with arrow keys it just does not work even if the arrow key presses are being broadcast to all 5 windows.. also when one of the group does and gets separated it’s a nightmare getting them all back together. removing follow completely killed all multiboxing in bgs when it happened in retail and it will be the same on classic
---
Also I don’t see how a boxer farming a rare spawn is going to break the AH.. and a boxer vs a 5 actual players on a rare spawn the 5 players should get the tag almost every time
---
If you give an Onslaught Girdle to a ret paladin instead of a fury warrior, your fury warriors will leave for a better guild.

Holy shit you’re as bitter as you are dense.
---
If you think ANY of the classic servers will be dead 3 months post-launch you are highly mistaken. You think Blizz announced two fresh servers because they perceive a realm like Stalagg or Grobb will be dead in a few months? Get your head out of your ass and take a nap.

Twin Emps and Cthun are in the same raid tho...

It's nice the bfa player has their parents to help.
---
I never lost it but real life took precedence.  Have a 3 yr old now and now that I’m getting divorced I have time at night to play without a b%*^ing woman down my throat :)
---
That's what I thought, but I was downvoted and told that I was wrong. Apparently layering is only there because Blizzard expects a bunch of retail people to sign up day 1 and quit before phase 2.
---
I think that's a fair assumption. Better safe than sorry on that front. But it's pretty frustrating knowing that we're going to have massive queue times even though the solution to those queue times is right in front of us.
---
They already fired him as Superman, so he’s good. Lots of free time to play WoW.
---
Time lost proto drake.
---
Actually that’s not a bad idea!
---
The last two expansions had smooth AF launches. Not fair to put that bag over blizzards head anymore tbh
---
Lets play this out. 
---
Scenario #1: You wait until launch happens and you have no idea when exactly the servers will come up. The timer is just an estimate anyways. You can try logging in at exactly 6pm EST but if its anything like the last stress test, it won't be up exactly at that moment, maybe a few seconds or a few minutes later. So you have to keep trying over and over, everyone else is also trying so you are sitting in a queue anyways. Conversely you can wait for a streamer to figure it out and then login but you will still be in a queue.
---
Scenario #2: You log in an hour early and get to the character select screen. You wait there for the servers to go live. If they do not (because it needs a manual refresh), you log out and back in and sit in the queue just like in scenario 1.
---
You know what would help spread the population evenly? Release all server at once, not one by one. Yes we get it, you don't think anyone wants to play a re-release of the most successful mmo of all time. But at this point it is getting ridiculous. All pvp servers are at least full. Where do you expect everyone who subs at launch to go? On that one new realm you launch on August 28th? I switched from shazz to gehenas with my group of friends, but we don't feel like switching realms every week. We need at least 5 more eng pvp realms to hold all the players that haven't subbed yet, release those at once, give us a few days to coordinate so it's easier for people to switch. Stop releasing them one at a time!
---
You are asking Americans not to be racist in 2019. Let me guess, for your next trick you’re going to tell people to stop shooting up schools and garlic festivals.
---
Are people who haven’t yet reserved a name even going to be able to create a character on a full realm? How does that work?
---
If you don't know how to do something and you don't think you're going to learn how to do it any time soon, find an officer who does.
---
Alpharetta but pretend like I'm from Atlanta to be cooler than I am Mage here
---
That's pretty much every reason why classic isn't going to have active players after a month.
---
This is happening to me this week and I just found a mould infestation in my bed frame that I've been sleeping on for weeks or so.
---
I may have to live in a hotel for my WoW Classic vacation week... Life is fucked.
---
Blizzard wants to remove layering starting from phase 2, it's going to be a cluster fuck.
---
Well in that case I was a Field marshal gnome warrior and loved it to pieces and think I did 5mans as an arm's tank anyway ha
---
In my 30s, feel like late 40s. So it wasn't me anyway. :)
---
Don't fall for the tricks....they're ALL going to be full at launch. Pick the server you want to play on.
---
Playing bfa with friends, must be mistaken for doing lfr with a bunch of random assholes. Poor kid craves the toxicity.
---
💯
---
I wont be following them because every sheep in wow will be. It will be faster to level away from them
---
Isn’t the first thing you want to do is ring the gong for the black resonating crystal mount?
---
ATL represent!
---
Poor horses...hahah that’s a good way to look at it though
---
It depends on the raid. 
---
The first Molten Core boss (Lucifron) asks a simple question: Do your mages know what remove curse does? If so, you win. If not, you don't. 
---
Whereas the first boss of Blackwing Lair (Razorgore) will kick the shit out of your group multiple times as each member of your 40 has to learn a job and do it in an organized fashion...then you get to phase 2.
---
Combine this with your actual leveling and it's not bad.
---
Yes you have to pay every month to play, if you miss one month, you lose all your progress on your account and have to restart.
---
There's a reason why EverQuest didn't last.
---
Gratz  on dropping the sandbag :)
---
Tactical Mastery is a fantastic pickup for two reasons.
---
1. If you're going to group at all, stance dancing is good.  Most people tank dungeons as Arms until 60, and it's nice to be able to do something simple like Charge/Defensive for some extra rage on engages.
---
2. It's a prerequisite for Anger Management, which is a top-tier talent.  A lot of talents are minor fluff, even Impale isn't good in earlier levels.  However, AM in classic has a hidden effect of giving you rage every 3 seconds, on top of the rage decay reduction.
---
You can grab Cruelty first, which I recommend, but AM is worth the investment.  I personally don't want to respec at all until at least 40, so I'm definitely getting TM+AM.
---
NA any PVP server Horde, preferably EST.
---
Rolling Undead Priest for healing. Ready to no life first week, 10-12 hours. Willing to duo level as well. Leveled a warrior to 60 in vanilla.
---
As a non-married but long-term-relationship man, I am having a good chuckle over this thread mate. Living with somebody is co-op, which is something a lot of people are missing here it seems. But yes, this is how the internet and especially reddit is - they pick one thing that they do not like and disregard anything else.
---
Thanks for the chuckle, enjoyed the title and the comments alike!
---
How is it a bot if it requires you to press an input for every listing?
---
I expect many players will quit before that
---
I know it’s not entirely the same situation, but that’s what made Oldschool Runescape successful. Release the old content then add new content that was never in the original game. Keeps things very fresh.
---
&gt;God, the thing about Everquest is that it's not so much nostalgia as it is war stories.
---
Well said haha.
---
None of these servers will die. That's the whole point of layering and why they released so few servers...
---
Bring back the Night Elf Mohawk?

There are a lot of strange time functions, I'm not sure about the one to call local time. You might be able to do it with math, subtracting three from the output value. Let me see what I can do.

If you have a North American account and an EU one this is how they will be displayed. WoW1 and WoW2
---
My achievement tracker. Get to 60 in the next 6 months
---
Do you want to be on a server where the entire population pronounces your server name differently? What if you tell someone to go on your server and you're like "Hey man, I'm on blaumeux!" and theyre like "blowmeu? I dont see that on the list." "No man, BLAUMEUX!" "blow me ux? what are you saying?"
---
Would be an absolute nightmare.
---
Oh interesting, I didn’t know that.
---
Something those of us on the RP-PvE realm will never have to stress about because our server pop will always be the lowest. At Medium (last time I checked), it's high enough for a healthy population but at the same time, probably will have minimal server queues.
---
Because /2 hasn’t been Trump chat for the past four years already?
---
Which server
---
Yeah, I always hear Two-ooh Turtle Doves.
---
meh, that's really not that cheap.  $4 is $4.  If you skimp out on $4 everyday you have over $1200 at the end of the year.  That's worth it to me.
---
I only subbed back so I could play the open stress test.  I signed up for a 6 month subscription so I got $12 off.
---
Blizzard thinks we need new realms, but we don't.
---
thats part of phase 5
---
You expect the players who raided on the same version of WoW for years as a passion to leave after a few months? You'll be mowed down by their honor farm squads in phase 2.
---
Am I blind or is this thread not showing up under new within the last 3 hours? The thread is only 2 hours old.
---
Just realised "mankrik" sounds overtly sexual.
---
Man-creek.
---
might even put fish in food and sell them
---
Correct.  This guy eoyher doesn't understand or is willfully ignorant of how the add on works.
---
jajajajajajajajaja
---
Most people not committed to a group will prefer to hop on a server that doesn't have a long queue
---
I certainly hope so, and that is definitely the thought process behind it. But there is no way to know how many retail players will try Classic and not like it. And current server pops are only based on name reservs which isnt a good indicator of anything IMO.
---
How are you checking your latency to the servers?
---
Keep in mind this is just my educated guess.  But it doesn't make sense in this day and age with layering and everything that we would have to wait for someone to log off before we can get in.
---
I will be here and on the forums enjoy the memes/salt
---
my how the turntables. the adult has shit running down his leg rather than the infant
---
You don't care one bit 😏
---
Are you me?
---
Why no central?
---
By a group of noobs with at least one warlock or hunter who won't dismiss their pet.
---
Word is that total subs are nearing under a millions so I doubt its "Millions."
---
epic
---
I knew a dude called soccerlegs. He was pretty famous
---
This, I'll be giving bags away to anyone who gives me some cloth. Whilst money would be good, adding to the community feel is more important.
---
If you aren’t worried about queue times you might be a tourist
---
i've never transferred. my toons have stayed on Thalnos where i created them the first time. these are just thoughts.
---
I expect other players to leave, I was thinking about the queues
---
Lol only 30% less, try telling a mage or warrior they'll do 30% less DPS from now on and see how they like it. There would be a shitstorm the likes of which you've never seen. Hunters are a pure DPS class with no damage to show for it.
---
because the last thing they want to do is to jump the gun and create too many servers and have a few dead in 6 months...pretty simple.
---
You need 2 different variables.
---
Also need to take into account that many people (like myself) have 3 names reserved on my account, 1 for me and 2 for my 2 friends....
---
Actually the population is based on EXPECTED population not the amount of characters created. If I could just find the damn post. It was posted on here.
---
I wasn't being dramatic, I was giving you a friendly warning about the kind of people you might attract when advertising "no political correctness". Pserver community in particular can be extremely toxic.
---
I drown in the blood pool in Crushbone keep and never swam again.

**&lt;Moist&gt; PvE Horde NA Casual Raiding on Mankrik**
---
**Intro:**
---
We are Moist, a collection of friends having come together through the ages of playing WoW and still staying loosely in touch with one another. The goal is to find other fellow mature players with limited schedules wanting to make the most of a single organized raid night without the pressure to fully min/max. The core of us are laid back, mature players with busy schedules, but who have raided since vanilla. 
---
Classic WoW relied heavily on individual and guild reputation.  We will strive to make Moist synonymous with quality on the Mankrik server.  Anyone who encounters a member of Moist should leave thinking that we are knowledgeable, respectful, fun, and all around awesome!
---
**Expectations:** 
---
Members should have a desire to learn and share knowledge to improve the guild. Seeing as we will operate on minimal organized raid time it is important that members be prepared and prompt for raid. The goal is to at least be farming BWL and 20 player content and pretty much see what motivation levels are like beyond that. We run a MS before OS tiered roll system taking into account average attendance over 2 months with some loot council but we try to be fair and transparent as well. We’re looking for people to help share the responsibility of running our guild community rather than focus too heavily on progression. 
---
**Raid Schedule:** 
---
We are planning to run two separate 3 hour raid IDs, one on Thursdays at 6 pm PST (9 pm EST) and the other on Saturdays 5 pm PST (8 pm EST), for targeting 40 player content. Other nights there may be optional 20 player content scheduled as interest dictates given the shorter lock out schedule. 
---

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/csor5z/describe_your_launch_day_with_one_movie_name_lets/). 
---
It's amazing how much you retain too. 
---
I started playing eq again last year. Started with just going to my old favorite zones. 
---
Took my rogue to upper guk, was gonna pop the map up (theres map packs for every zone now), and just thought , nah I think I got this. A couple minutes later and I'm zoning I to lower guk bedroom ent.
---
Hell yes we are
---
I've never heard a stereotype about BRs being bad players.
---
The two big stereotypes they have, that are hopefully different now;
---
They have bad outdated hardware, "Nice toaster bro"
---
They beg for gold like relentless assholes, "YOU GIB ME MONAY PLZ HUEHUEHUE"
---
But like I said, hopefully Brazilians have overcome these stereotypes of the past.
---
Not sure
---
alpha male
---
np that'll be 5g pls
---
"i've cleared the easiest bosses in the tier therefore i can say that the rest of the raid (which i've never seen btw) is a joke"
---
LMFAO.
---
I feel the same way. I probably will just roll on Thalnos still, I already have my characters created the way I want with the names I want. Just hope I can snag my last 2 next week.
---
It was sometime between 6am and 8am. I was at an all-nighter LAN party at my local LAN center.
---
The night had died down between 2 and 3, so I got off CS and launched WoW.
---
I was in the eastern plague lands questing and didn't realize how close I was to leveling. Only one bubble away! But as we will all be reminded soon, one bubble can take a long time.
---
I eventually made the level, sometime after the sun started coming up. During my time leveling, I got my first world drop epic, and I can't tell you how excited I was!
---
But, it was a Brain Hacker. It couldn't even pay for a mount. 
---
At least I was level 60!
---
what a horrible night to have a curse
---
Nah man whitemane
---
I'm pst and I scheduled my week vacation to start on the 27th as soon as I heard the news... fuck
---
Pretty much just like that.
---
37 right now - this old bastard will be terrorizing Azeroth once again.
---
We are too
---
It has text chat as well as voice. For some reason it became super popular on Reddit and now every man &amp; his dog clamours to set one up for anything and everything. I've seen people creating servers for subreddits that see like &lt;10 new posts a day, most of which are just "look at what I bought/have" photos that don't warrant discussion anyway.
---
I wouldn't get my hopes up if you can't even run Hearthstone, sorry.
---
That's cool, they didn't have that in 2004.
---
\##YOU-SKER'ED
---
Can't stay from bae can ya?
---
Lady Blaumeux could be your new bae.
---
Lmfaoo funniest thing I’ve read in awhile my friend
---
To be fair hearthstone is poorly optimized
---
Generally rule is if you can run retail WoW you can run classic WoW. And you can play retail WoW for free up to level 20
---
In hardcore guilds yes. Otherwise no, or you should have known that way before beginning to raid with them, and therefore left the guild by yourself.
---
Say hi to Sylvanas while you're at it.
---
&gt; Was too young at the time to have ever properly played EQ but That sounds genuinely awesome and something I'd love to see in newer MMO's. I can almost imagine something similar playing out in Classic if the system existed.
---
it's not too late to experience it if you're curious. check out /r/project1999. might be fun to have it up on another monitor so you can play two classic MMOs simultaneously for maximum hipster elitism.
---
You guys are seriously underestimating the number of players who haven't signed up yet.  For a certainty it's more people than have signed up already, I doubt that could be in dispute? So there are a \*lot\* of servers yet to come.
---
Mage
---
Priest
---
Warlock
---
Rogue
---
Restoration Shaman
---
Elemental Shaman (pvp)
---
Protection Warrior
---
Fury Warrior
---
Arms Warrior
---
Holy Paladin
---
Yeah, you should definitely swap. The new servers will fill on release and still have queues, but they won't be as bad as herod
---
777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777
---
My advice:  If you got a crap name on Herod, try to get a good name on the new server.  If you do, switch.
---
It's incel terminology but it's become a meme that has penetrated the internet. 
---
Chads are highly attractive looking dudes who get all the women. 
---
There's also Stacies which is the woman equivalent.
---
No Way. WHITEMANE.
---
Blow Me.
---
This is probably going to be the biggest bloodbath of a launch in history....
---
there's a polymorph guide? links?
---
Triple posted sir might wanna remove 2
---
Those maps are HUD etch-a-sketches, too. If you can half remember where to go, you're better off without 'em, especially if it's a 3d zone. Gimme an eqmaps printout.
---
No, the South AMerican government didn't lay claim to the land known as Thalnos. 10+ established guilds from Brazil who are dedicated players announced they would roll on Thalnos since they didn't get a server of their own and everyone lost their damn minds.
---
Lots of people from Canada, the entire right side of the US, and from other regions have all made their way to Thalnos. You might occasionally see some random people speaking Spanish or Portugese in Say chat here and there, but otherwise, you'll probably never even be able to tell.
---
all buffs cause threat.
---
eh?  no no no, it's the tourists who can't stand in queues.
---
And for me Classic is a fucking bridge.
---
Dude if you want to just do it, the wife and I just one day said stuff it, we had a big 4 bedroom house full of stuff 2 cars and everything to go with it, crippling debt, jobs we hate (im still working mine for the minute) we where depressed, we fought a lot.  We sold EVERYTHING I mean everything all I took from it was the clothes on my back and a small bag of clothes, my laptop and phone the wife took about the same, we bought a converted school bus with a trailer, we bought a jeep to put in the trailer and we have been very careful about what we buy to put back into it.  Hands down best idea we have ever had and being free is the most liberating feeling we have ever had, no debt, no problems and most importantly we don't fight we are actually closer than we have ever been.  Don't wait my man life is way to short.
---
Not at all bent out of shape. I always take the time to educate someone that I see needs to be educated.
---
According to your own comments, just 3 days ago you argued that people won’t stop playing, and now you’re saying realms will be dead? Just take a fucking break from the internet man.
---
Which streamer is golemagg?
---
Honestly this is pre servers being filled up so I’d take it with a grain of salt with the current situation.
---
According to the site, the book is the only source in Classic for rank 9.  You can search spells just like items, and it will tell you where they're from.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoMdqyhyvWM](This) is by far the cringiest WoW video that has ever existed
---
So... pick a Gnome.
---
Gold, princess can be solod by most classes including rogue.  A lot of the other classes can solo the other bosses along the way too.
---
You should use Revenge even when you 2h tank because Revenge is instant, rage cost is super low and it still does more threat than anything else (the threat:rage ratio is pretty much unbeatable). Of course Revenge won't be up as often because you lack Shield Block but it still something you should use when it's up just because of the thread alone.
---
Poopsocking is an old term that basically meant no life-ing it. I know it was at least used as far back as Everquest when you would have to farm a specific mob or camp for hours, if not days, on end.
---
Lol and none is still gonna move
---
heyyyyyyyyyyyyyy you’ve got me thinking now *ditches guide*
---
Re-roll Horde, it's not too late! Here's the website that I took the Horde Weapon Progression from! 
---
[https://www.wowisclassic.com/en/class-guide/warrior/leveling-1-60/#alliance-weapon](https://www.wowisclassic.com/en/class-guide/warrior/leveling-1-60/#alliance-weapon)
---
I mean it kind of is when you are specifically playing on an english speaking realm? lmao
---
I estimate about 30% of people have already signed up, give or take. It just depends on how Classic rolls out and how popular it gets. At this point, it could be anyone's guess.
---
I don't know, I wouldn't want to be associated with a server that can be easily mispronounced as "blow me".
---
I'm not switching to Blow Me U X
---
They're going to go wherever they want to go, just like my best friend isn't on proudmoore o.O The folks that WANT the community have the community. You don't understand what you're talking about in this case.
---
depends on the names i can get
---
i think all the servers will be fine population-wise, so if I can get a cool name on one of the new ones ill switch
---
Even 7-10p PST is a little much 10pm is pretty late to get started when I have to wake up at 6am
---
Honestly this whole complaint about the spanish and Brazilian community is very racist. It implies the anyone who isn't spanish or Brazilian isn't toxic. Which we all no is very far from the truth.
---
This next part is going to stir some feathers but it has to be said. A large part of the wow population is white males. Some of which do not realize that they have a subconscious bias on this topic. I don't really blame them though. Sometimes people are raised in environments where the concept of lumping in an entire race of people is socially acceptable and not viewed as racist
---
This advice applies always.
---
I'm sorry. I am bound by the light to purge the evil from these lands...
---
Paladins on horde side??!! At this time of year, at this time of day, in this part of the continent, localized ENTIRELY within your quest text???
---
I love this. I already learned a lot after not using it for long. I appreciate the work that was put into the site and how easy it is to navigate.
---
I’m more concerned about people quitting a month in than how many people will start off.
---
Permadeath on force-sensitive slots was amazing.  Also player bounties, player cities, and holocrons... they never even told people *how* to even unlock a Jedi slot.  I love the idea that there was real mystery in games back then.
---
Making characters on retail realms and also pinging the datacenters with cmd. In wowpedia you can find their IPs, it also has the classic ones but no the new ones
---
I feel like that list will only grow by the time launch hits.  2 new servers will help, but I dont see it changing that list
---
Dumb question:
---
What talent path have you been getting. Respec at 30?
---
Have one warrior picking up improved shouts?
---
Classic Wow is like the freemasons guild.
---
not any better. Gnome character models also bring camera problems I'd rather not deal with
---
Layering will be very powerful. This is an old game and Blizzard has incredible servers. I expect there will be large queues, but they will not take long to get through.
---
For the first couple hours though, there will probably be hiccups so it's hard to make predictions.
---
How many vaginas have you destroyed
---
Yup, the people who sit in que for the first couple days get to play on full servers, while new servers are sitting at "low" when people get bored after a month.
---
4/5 are pvp servers - go figure! 
---
Lok Tar Ogar! If its red, its dead!
---
1-Anything is allowed if an objective is being contested (quest, mobs, nodes etc)
---
2-When no objective is being contested feel free to engage in combat whenever you desire against players of your level range
---
3-Corpse camping is only allowed when said player was doing it to another player (eye for an eye rule)
---
4-Never engage or start the specific activity of "low level ganking"
---
5-You may kill a low level player when passing by but never corpse camp or kill him repeatedly
---
6-If an enemy low level player is tormenting fellow low level players of your own faction feel free to do whatever you find appropriate to him (eye for an eye rule)
---
nope.  i'd probably only switch from herod pvp est for thunderfury pvp est.
---
Alright, thanks !
---
1/10 must try harder.
---
That's actually why I stopped replying or even reading the replies really. Once I know we're meme jerking, I'm out.
---
Think of how many people who are playing retail that just went and made 1-3 characters because "why not?", and are going to log in on launch night, see a 50k queue, and instantly bail.
---
Its gonna be queue central, but I doubt it'll be that bad when all the people who aren't super hyped about it (but made characters) instantly refuse to wait in a queue.  Spin up some extra layers, retail zoomers bail, us old farts get back to our teenage days.
---
Same here, our guild seems to be planning to switch tonight once names go live
---
Venoxis what a toxic server
---
1600 from me. rank 13 and up to Ossirian. and 2 prof
---
3 subs.
---
"Not now Nelson! I just joined a big party of Night Elves and we're going to explore the Tower of Azora together."
---
Exactly. You also get 5% more intel.
---
Ragefire Chasm may be obsolete to an *individual* but it's not obsolete to the *game*. There will always be fresh level 13s who can benefit from the loot the dungeon gives.
---
I'm talking about when new content makes it so *nobody* benefits from certain older content. Why would anyone run Molten Core when questing in Hellfire Peninsula is significantly faster, easier, and gives better loot? Why would anyone run the Botanica when Utgarde Keep, a dungeon of equal level and difficulty, provides loot that is 40% better? The older content might as well not exist.
---
Damn that would be fantastic
---
He's not so no worries there.
---
what the fuck is this shit
---
Me and pal just did the AO 'classic' relaunch server for a bit and followed it through to aroud level 140 I think when they brought out shadowlands. Loved reliving all the rubi-ka stuff with a great new org, but it also lost me at shadowlands. Class build in that game was so fun, the struggle of finding all the profs to buff you to twink up to that next piece of gear...so good!
---
Oh yeah for sure I know there won't be any Blizzard support. Was just curious if someome made a mod.
---
Saw another one of these on the way home today. Double take lol

**[&lt;From The Beginning&gt; | Horde | Stalagg| EPGP ]**
---
```
---
Our guild started in 2013 as a reddit post during Mists of Pandaria. Many of us were tired of modern WoW, so we formed a guild with a singular goal: to do old content at the proper character and item level on live servers. We ended up leveling together and clearing all raid content from lvl 60 Molten Core all the way up to 85 cataclysm with Deathwing. Here's a few of our raids to give you an idea of the atmosphere and environment:
---
BWL run - &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OauUwwBeHs8&gt;
---
Black Temple Mother Shahraz with no shadow resist gear - &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=qTgZToJoS38&gt;
---
**Raid Times**
---
To be determined. We traditionally raided week days  at 8 PM EST until 11 or 12 with the occasional Sunday night raid
---
**Member Expectation**
---
We raid in a relaxed atmosphere with most raid members being in their late 20s, early 30s. You will be expected to follow directions, be polite and respectful. Raiders will need to bring a minimum amount of consumables to raids, as well as put together a half decent best in slot pre raid set.
---
We’re estimating that we’ll be starting MC 3 months after launch, that should be plenty of time to hit 60 and get some decent pre raid best in slot stuff. While doing MC our optional raid nights will be focused on running the entire guild through attunement quest chains.
---
Casual players who won’t be raiding, or pvpers are still welcome. We’ll be running Battle Ground premades and our optional raids (everything not current content) will be open to all and alts.

*That's the point.*   
---
Making you choose, so it's possible to actually gauge where you'll end up, and thus plan for launch.
---
North American realms are language-specific now?
---
What? I don't want layering in phase 2. I want enough layers to allow everyone to log in at the same time.
---
But you need to keep in mind that private servers doesn't require subscription
---
I love the old school vibe of this infographic. I liked how you had which talents to pick at which level on the other one but with all the info on there I suppose it isn't easy. Nice work.
---
I look at it like that one time I worked at Circuit City on Black Friday, the doors open and hundreds of people just poured in, it was mayhem. It was like that in 2004, it'll be like that next week. :)
---
No, just game runner of WoW.. which is still a pretty important position.
---
5 min corpse runs? That is soo casual. Back in my day we lost EXP and sometimes gear dropped or broke completely when you died!
---
no. piss off. I kill you.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-YprpQuqRs
---
I would say it's a larger percentage than anyone is thinking because all retail subs will make a large proportion of playerbase, whom all already have likely reserved names.
---
Its called honor, and i have it :D
---
Yup, pretty sure they are.
---
da hayp iz riau !
---
It took almost a week for Stalagg to hit High pop. I'm sure there are a bunch of players not reserving names who aren't going to pop in til Aug 26th but it's really hard for us to know how many. Most people on this subreddit seem to have already reserved names, easily upwards of 80-90% of comments indicate as such. In my group of friends, most of us have already reserved names as well - I think of the 9 or 10 of us, only one is waiting til the 26th to subscribe, so again 90% or so. 
---
Now obviously one of these is completely anecdotal and the other not scientific as reddit's /r/classicwow crowd isn't a 100% matchup to the player base in general, so again, it's really hard to know how accurate of a reflection this is of reality. But we could easily argue that the playerbase as a whole is more casual than the actual fans of classic wow, which would logically lead us to 2 assumptions:
---
1. They're less likely to reserve names ahead of time.
---
2. They're also less likely to play classic WoW at all.
---
I would have a hard time believing that those who have already reserved names represent less than 70% of the players who actually intend to play classic at launch, and again it could be as high as 90%. If you look at the number of pvp servers so far, and guess that there's another 20% of players unaccounted for, 2 more pvp realms seems reasonable.
---
If they have to add 10 more pvp servers I will be extremely surprised.
---
And I'm honor-bound to the Horde to make a stand against any agressors onto our lands!
---
I'd say "See you on the battlefield" but i'm rolling PvE ;)
---
isn't it pronounced "blue mo"?
---
And ofc our UD rogue flankarN

Hey man, I was just cruising through these comments and noticed that some poor soul was in need of a nice big "fuck you", so I figured "Well gosh, I've got a minute, why don't I help a fella out?" I'll just leave it here for you!

#Fuck you!

Tauren Druid
---
What is the AV macro?
---
If I join a server, and I really enjoy it there, and we get queues because the game is getting more popular and the community is growing, then sure, I can live with that. But if I haven't even logged into a single character yet, I don't care about the server yet. My options are still open until launch. This is the time to be asking these questions and raising these issues.
---
Signed
---
They released the 25th expansion last December but ok
---
Herod is so full because most don't want to join streamer server Faerlina?
---
The original uses five-ish syllables for everything but the 5th &amp; 1st 'thing', but often draws out a syllable (six geese a-laying) or rapidly squeezes two+ syllables into one (eleven pipers piping).
---
Day 2 doesn't have to match "two turtle doves" exactly syllable for syllable - it just needs to match the cadence of the song, and "two factions clashing" fits just perfectly in my opinion.
---
All you are saying has only be valid in somewhat hardcore guilds. Which most of us don't give a fuck about. Same for PuGs. Most people won't bother trying to find a PuG for raids and will just stick with their guildmates with whom they will have build a good relationship from leveling or whatever. It never happens to have loot problems like you mention in those case.
---
Any normal social human being that knows to do compromises understands that you actually have the right to roll whatever class you want and play whatever viable (=/= 100% optimal) role you want, because you should not be gutted from the choice you do in character selection. Not everyone wants to play warrior/mage/rogue, no matter how "efficient" they might be. We just don't care. All that content is easy and everything bar maybe 1-5 bosses has been done with unoptimal raids again and again back in Vanilla.
---
If you raid with people that don't understand this, you chose the wrong guild, and were very unfortunate because there are gonna be very few like that, specially if it's a guild that you join ingame when the game is out.
---
Trolling it is.  Carry on.
---
My night elf rogue, in WPL. Can’t remember the name of the field but it’s the one near the Scholo lake with the ghosties 
---
Irl I was on earth
---
Ill be joining, I've never leveled on a pvp server(not counting private servers) and I keep hearing they add another layer of fun to the game
---
Seriously? Deadmines is literally the most linear, straight-forward dungeon in the game. Why does it need a youtube guide?
---
Yea missing a call doesn‘t mean you‘re gonna lose the role right away.
---
Ugh do I stay up til midnight or just play tomorrow 😑
---
Pick a human female. If you’re going to stare at a character for months to years might as well enjoy the view!

You want people off Herod Blizz? Set Skeram time to CST.

Planning on leveling a warrior for casual raids and PvP. Just want a guild that I can enjoy chatting and leveling with as I enjoy the journey. I won’t be able to make every single raid night but I can guarantee that when I’m at a guild event I will have everything together as far as potions and knowledge of the fight. Really looking for some World PvP as well.
---
And it brings Rogues and Druids out of stealth!
---
Hold up!!!
---
I'll probably make my characters this weekend and it's looking like Skeram at this point, I really want to see H/A balance numbers first though I want as close to 50/50 as possible.
---
I never mentioned patchwork so I'm still not sure if you responded to the right comment. Either way did you even watch the video you posted dude? Both the priest and shaman are spamming one spell. How is that difficult?
---
if they increase cap to 70 ill quit
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg2PD-dwsIw
---
that's exactly my case. Played 5 years. Then quitted till now.
---
Don't have a clue what this means.
---
And, of course, a Gooke of the subjet will result only in "buy things" posts
---
Hello from the Minneapolis suburbs!
---
Beware quest item drop rates. Seriously, you may be in for a 10 minute jaunt to gather cougar pelts, or you might spend 2 fruitless hours wondering if you're farming the wrong mob for a quest.
---
You don’t have numbers for BFA.  You’re making up whatever insane notions you want to try and support some mental gymnastics.
---
Yea im thinking about picking one of the 2 new servers for low queue and so I can get some names (my first choice was taken because I came home late) I have nothing against Streamer servers just want a more chill experience tham what the the streamer crowd brings in.
---
I was sure about switching when a new server comes up but bleumoux is such a whack name
---
I will find you and I will corpsecamp you
---
or good server / code
---
How many people do you know who intend to play wow classic but have not already reserved a name? I know 1 or 2, and probably 8 or 9 that have already reserved.
---
I am so gonna log in and just offer to be a pocket healer for whoever is my zone, lol!
---
BGs won’t be out for at least 6 months btw.
---
It‘s what you get for having a raid full of mages and hunters
---
wait what people thought there was no in game map wtf
---
I'd sign it.  At least one rogue has to have some honor.
---
To be fair, the auto healing and decursive type addons were blocked by Blizz pretty early on.
---
Qnd if they bring BC later on. You can also "shapeshift" temporaly (into a demon)
---
Unfortunately you guys are rolling alliance on Herod if I remember correctly.  I think I’m rolling on Stalagg with my new guild.  Good luck man!
---
It's just the new thing to complain about.
---
May I roll one?
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIalJx4XdQY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIalJx4XdQY) 
---
maybe this video will persuade you
---
Stalaggtites hang in there!
---
In raids but what about PvP? this doesnt help him at all
---
Do you really think over 50% of the interested people in WoW classic subbed nearly a month early just to reserve their shitty name?
---
Other than the people who must play as "Heart" or "Renegade" or something like that, that just doesn't seem like a good assumption
---
it seems way more likely that a large majority would not care. Then you have to include people who didn't think they want to play and then are convinced up to launch, etc. 75-80% seems much more realistic
---
I honestly can't see a majority of people subbing for name reservations. Most people aren't that stupid (no offense).
---
Are you seriously asking if it's worth it to switch from Herod?
---
Blizzard specifically said queues on launch day for Herod will be 10 thousand, possibly much higher.
---
Do you know what that means? That means waiting in queue for 5-10 hours. I made the switch to Stalagg and it's at high pop already. Consider moving there or to Skeram.
---
Community behavior wise I expect Thalnos to be the best server by a large amount.
---
No u
---
Big!!!
---
Warlock is for you. It’s best of both worlds.
---
Play retail then.
---
That company runs signage all over the country they are so massive you'd probably never even get in touch with someone who could help
---
Don’t leave Stalagg PepeHands
---
It's that large population who are often than not the toxic ones (by a large margin).
---
That’s why you roll a Human Female with a pony tail.
---
What would 15-years-ago-you have done?
---
Were doing inventory next Friday so they told second shift they don’t even have to come in. 
---
So 4 day weekend to play classic. 
---
I keep thinking oh I should go somewhere but fuck I know I’m not going to and I’m just going to be playing this.
---
First time through? Don't use too many addons especially questie. Quests are important but iy makes the world seem more worldly without an objective arrow and you get to actually explore the nooks.
---
On that, be sure to check for quests everywhere. 
---
Fedex quests to new zones are a good boost and jumpstarts you into the quest chain.
---
Get all the dungeon quests before clearing... Always sucks to miss those.
---
Buying gf
---
My group is all pushing 40 and there are about 7 of us. all played vanilla and are pretty pumped to play again.  gonna be a lot of fun.
---
I think if we raid twice a week I’ll be guaranteed to be able to go in at least one of them. I’m really down for whatever. I know as a Moon-Chicken that I’m gonna have to work hard for a spot anyway. It won’t matter to me how many nights. As long as the guild is progressing at a good rate and getting their people geared as such. I’m really looking forward to enjoying the classic experience however I can. 
---
I’m not picky at all.
---
I'll save the reddit a post and at least say that [We have performed necessary training!](https://i.imgur.com/G7vkzTz.jpg) We shall be prepared!

They just announced two more NA pvp realms launching tonight literally before you posted this lol.
---
Yea, because getting married turns you into a permission asking little boy. It‘s above his setup and he has to ask for permission? Lmao
---
I think my first gank was in the Barrens, where a stealthed rogue just kept sapping me as I tried to quest. I had no idea what was going on. I thought the game was messing up.
---
And a bit more on the Bounty: it wasn't taken up upon myself but with  help from my guild &lt;Displaced&gt; (which later fractured into &lt;Reverends of Swagger&gt;, same tag I have now). 
---
We drafted up the grand event to get some world pvp flowing and in homage to the guild &lt;BATTLE FOR THE MOUNTAIN&gt;. &lt;Displaced&gt;'s bank sponsored the gold and armed me up with plenty of consumables and a flask to survive the event. The entire time on Ventrilo my guild was furious at me because I would keep jumping off the cliff and line of sighting healers to go hunting down stragglers.   
---
There must have been around 350 or so Alliance just meandering around the Mountain killing any Horde in sight. It was glorious. Gotta give it to &lt;Cake&gt; and &lt;Aftermath&gt; for coordinating the mass resurrection and taking me down--worked a treat as I suddenly disconnected and logged back in at Thorium Point as a ghost. We held up our end of the bargain and bought someone's 670ish gold piece of mutton off the Gadgetzan auction house.
---
I remember getting this on my Gnome Mage in Vanilla. Amazing item, so valuable and fits the mage raiding playstyle perfectly.
---
Are you sure that's accurate, post weapon speed normalization?
---
Can we get one Latin America and one Brazil server too please
---
12k cap. I wonder on what they based that number. In the "You Think You Do, but You Don't" parody vid, the maker of said vid displays a /who with 12k people being logged in on the server at that time. Must be a coincidence.
---
That’s me right now
---
I got a ring in there last night.
---
That sounds like semi/hardcore talk. I guess some of you just don't get it...
---
I DON'T CARE of we wipe in a raid a lot. I don't care if we can't progress for months. I dont care if I never raid! I just want to have fun. Hopefully, we learn it and beat it? But if not, w.e. 
---
Fun for you is beating the raid. 
---
Fun for casual players is participating in one.
---
This post was not for you sir. Have a nice day.
---
What the hell else are we supposed to upvoted? Christmas songs?!
---
I tip my hat at the other player so we can both get our quests done efficiently.
---
The Norwegian community just decided to switch to Firemaw.  
---
&gt; **Kjære alle** 📷   I uken som var har det skjedd mye. Siden vi tok stilling til servervalg sist har Blizzard sagt at det har vært ekstremt stor pågang på Wow Classic, og mye mer enn de hadde forutsett. Vi har hatt tett kontakt med representanter fra de ulike guildene og har sammen kommet til at serveren som ble annonsert idag blir et beste valget for oss. Vi er svært opptatt av at servervalg ikke bare skal samle Norge, men at vi også skal velge den serveren som gir den beste spillopplevelsen, både på launch, men også over tid. Dette er ikke en avgjørelse vi tar lett på, og vi er sikre på at dette blir et godt valg når vi nå går mot launch 27. august.  Wow Classic Norge skal spille på:  **Firemaw \[EU-PVP\] - Spre ordet!** 📷  Character creation på Firemaw åpner imorgen kl. 20:00 tirsdag 20. august! 
---
Other Nordic countries are going Gehennas ([http://nordicclassic.jinnis.se/](http://nordicclassic.jinnis.se/))
---
*soar
---
Although, you're right.  It may be painful.
---
Don’t need to worry about queues... if you never log off ;)
---
How much do people really care about server name vs actually being able to play the game without waiting in line for an hour? Shit, people called my server "Dong Iron". Who cares?
---
I've learned a lot of tricks this past week that I never knew before it's surprising.
---
I prefer thinking about it as days because hours makes it seem longer. 
---
This is significant to me because every two weeks I have my  'Rare &amp; Appropriate' day (known by most as a cheat day) and I can eat/drink anything I want. 
---
I designated the 27th as my R&amp;A when I will be having a few shots of  Koskenkorva vodka, a few beers while playing Wow Classic and then eating homemade smoked Violife cheese quesadillas with a side of onion rings.
---
Saying 7 days as opposed to 167 hours makes me feel better. Haha
---
Too many people here on reddit and in this guides say that you should skip seal of justice for pve...it´s such a useful seal that after judging prevents the mobs from fleeing which makes questing in some places so much easier. it´s a lvl 22 skill that doesn´t cost that much...just get it and you can relax while fighting in narrow areas with fleeing mobs
---
I was 14-15 when I played. But I think about some of the people I raided with then who were my age now and we’re just having kids at that point. 
---
I think “holy shit Zhao has a 15 year old now.”
---
A friend of mine refuses to pay $15 a month for a 15 year old game. On that fact alone he won’t be resubbing. I can understand his point of view, personally I just think the benefits outweigh the cost.
---
It wouldn't be authentic if the servers don't crash and burn.
---
Shamans have bloodlust and alliance won’t have access to that.
---
Can I get an F in the chat for this poor man
---
They can probably just your server playtime is proportional to what percentage of your characters are on that server. So if you have 2 on Thalnos and 1 on Herod they could count you as 2/3rds of a player on Thalnos, 1/3rd on Herod. Its not perfect, and yeah Herod in particular might get a bit skewed, but its probably a pretty close estimate.
---
The issue is that not all of the players will stay. Then you're left with a bunch of dead servers. Layering is specifically in Classic to prevent having enough servers for launch day.
---
Makes sense. Thanks!
---
I'm not a role player so I'd rather leave that realm for the people that are interested in RP. You guys only got one RPPVP server after all.
---
I'm sure plenty of people would. Ironically I hope.
---
If you don't do anything yeah. If "you" are doing something you'll stay logged in. Although if you are logged in for excessive amounts of time blizzard will probably end up suspending you for account sharing, afk botting or whatever

Same :/
---
Classic makes your dick grow. Just tell that to your wives and you can play all the classic you want.
---
&gt;we really need another server soon. 
---
The current account rate is going to double come launch.  
---
We'll need another 10 servers...
---
I bet every server made up until launch day will have a solid pop.  They're gonna have to double servers within a few days of release as well.
---
Oh yes another post about how minmaxers are ruining the game. Keep em coming
---
Blue balls?

don't over think it. don't min/max. don't listen to others , and do whatever you want.

ill be glad just to walk into zones again where the NPCs are just like "dude the wolves are fucking us up go kill 10 of them and ill give you shoes"

I didnt want to break a sub rule. I'm looking for the names trav, travis, Joseph, joe, joey, jo, jojo, jack, or jak
---
Lvl 60 Kara would be awesome.
---
All the people on Herod?
---
Grob mob here
---
I am. Some people don't care to spend half their 15 dollars on a name.  The number of accounts is going to double and we're all going to pay dearly for it.

Me too lol. I’ve got the names I want already

No, they can turn it off whenever they want. It just means longer queues.
---
They advertise a day late in america why? We get it on the 26th. Not complaining just odd.
---
Hope youre not o  a full server or else you wont be playing with them regardless.
---
Not at all lol. Any race can do anything.
---
Lul wut?
---
Yeah wife aggro can be a real bitch.
---
It's pretty safe, based on anecdotal evidence
---
I honestly think the people who subbed early are the main people who will actually stay.  And these servers will fill up slower because people dont want to give up a name
---
I 
---
I don’t think I would be able to just go, even in a diaper..
---
From a guy who stopped playing long, long ago, what is the problem with flying mounts?
---
The real problem is that we don't have time for a mid-dungeon siesta.
---
No blood elves give alliance high elves, keep space goats out of the game and give horde goblins.
---
Keep Horde ugly!
---
I raided, Classic through Wrath, with my father. His name was Lumpod in-game. He was one of the main tanks in a guild on Staghelm; I can’t remember the guild name. He went downhill quickly in 2011; after suffering for about 6 months, he passed from cancer that was in his lymph nodes. 
---
WoW was one of the few things we had in common and we enjoyed it together. I’d love to share this moment with him again but we have a lot of good memories I look back on fondly. :)
---
Yes, it's also not at all how Geralt of Rivia looks
---
Maybe for some sort of small business. Just telling you no, buzz off and then chucking it in a skip bin is going to far easier for any big advertising business.
---
Increasingly glad I didn't fall for their ploy to get extra sub money.
---
Horde or Alliance?
---
worst case, you can play in "classic" mode till you upgrade
---
Yes, because the realms designated "Full" are not actually full. "Full" is just a designation that they expect the realm will actually be full during launch.
---
"Full", even post launch, also does not prevent you from creating characters on that realm. "Locked" does prevent you, unless you already have a character on that realm, but we don't know if Blizzard intends to lock an extremely overpopulated realm such as Herod.
---
Starting to think that "incel" usage is "incel" terminology too at this point
---
You made the topic at hand into the current game somehow being at a lower sub number than Vanilla.  It can’t be proven that it is.  You pulled insane numbers out that aren’t supported by facts.  You’re the one doing all this.
---
A lot less safe now that you told us your name.
---
I’ll be doing probably made as alt...warrior if I have time haha.rogue/ward/mate have been my top 3 most played since I’ve started in vanilla. So I figured I’d keep it that way heh
---
Get a friend to reserve it then spend time customizing the way you like, then get your friend to delete the named character at exact same time you create it again
---
I kind of figured it'd be worthless, but I did it anyways. 
---
Yeah, I was really fucked up the next day. Overtrained myself to hell and back, and didn't get the girl.
---
so true man. I know it's a totally crazy fantasy game. But i liked it when it was a bit more "realistic"

I would  say if you  didn't mention the name you were using it is rather safe to remake at this point. Saying the name does increase the chance of it being nabbed when recreating though.
---
Dang wheres our headhunters

Why would you post the name that you want to save on a public form? Haha.

There is a no logout macro you can find pretty easily.

Just can't use it where the logout is instant.
---
I took the names Nightmare, Logic and Joker. I recreated them a few days after at around 2am est. And again yesterday around 2am est was fine. So at least at 2am you should be fine lol
---
Depends on what you mean by single threaded.
---
If you mean does it utilize multiple threads to do different tasks then no, probably it's not single threaded.
---
If you mean is there a single thread that's responsible for the vast majority of the work being done, work that cannot be delegated to different threads, then yes it's still single threaded.

**&lt;Aural Sects&gt; | Horde | Whitemane - PVP |**
---
Hi, I'm Terse - a WoW veteran &amp; GM of &lt;Aural Sects&gt;. We are a small, friendly guild composed of various groups of friends brought together for the enjoyment of Classic WoW and quickly growing in size! 
---
Our main focus is creating a casual guild for anyone seeking a home for themselves or their gaming buddies! It is my wish to create an online community with a positive realm reputation for the Horde of Whitemane-PST! We'd love to have you!
---
**End-game agenda:**
---
*Raiding (Semi-hardcore / Loot Council / 8PM - 11PM, midweek)
---
*World bosses / Dungeons
---
*Battlegrounds / WPVP / Duel Fight Clubs
---
*Professions / Banking / Auction House
---
*Organized Guild Events
---
**Currently recruiting for:**
---
*All classes &amp; specs
---
*All play styles (PVE, PVP, casual, hardcore, etc.)
---
Our tank &amp; healing core is solid, so DPS is actually preferred from a raiding perspective - but we'll find a spot for you regardless!
---
I'm also looking to expand our Class Officer core a bit with experienced vanilla or WoW players.
---
Feel free to join our Discord or reach out to me if you're interested in being a part of our community. See you in Classic!

I was thinking about posting this. I almost fell down in the shower when I heard it. Also druid players always want to tell you when they are a druid, I know I'm a druid haha
---
Whatever you say chief, try not to get your panties in a bunch over something on the Internet anymore
---
I plan on doing it sometime before launch, not right now. So the 30 or so people reading this don't really worry me. Especially considering streamers at some point will need to recreate their characters.
---
Not American so I can't say if it's normal or not.  But what you're using isn't the correct term, it's a genericized trademark.  Also just a guess, but you don't work anywhere near the tech industry hey?  If you did, or at least worked around the crazy place that is silicon valley, you would absolutely have heard of the term before reading about it on a reddit thread.
---
***\*the boys are back in town\****
---
You are soo me! That is one of the reasons I want to play classic wow. Just look at the Borean Thundra map. It looks like someone puked and shat on a map. I like clean zones with own simple themes
---
Tauren can't ride the Skeletal Horse or the Raptor
---
I would love to be in a guild like this
---
Theres a couple different ways to go about this.
---
[This](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVtu0xZVhtIczto) is your best bet. It's incredible for a healer to have blessing of kings and sanctuary for your druid and warrior tanks. I don't know what else to say.
---
Someone in another thread said they tanked as holy which I presume looked something like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVVuogspVhdIZc). The basic idea here is to pull with holy shock then judge wisdom and then seal of righteous auto attack + consecration. This build is for maintaining as much mana as possible while tanking. Guy in another thread said he tanked like this and ended fights with 75% of his mana. Would be fun to play around with. Starting off a boss pull with a guaranteed critical strike holy shock and then putting up a 45 second judgement of wisdom sounds so sexy to me. I'd be willing to try that before an actual prot build lmao.
---
Mainly I meant Ret just wasn't fun, I actually got quite a bit of the gear from BWL to make Ret decent, once we had it on farm. I did Raid part of AQ as Ret But in the end I was more useful as Holy. A warrior could do what I did better, without running into mana issues. Not saying Ret was impossible to make work, just the effort your entire raid had to put into getting Ret there wasn't worth it. 
---
Very few have done the work you've done looking into it. My main issue with most of these Ret posts is people just want to play Ret because of the stigma. They just want to be the special snowflake, and because of that they are going to just make it harder on few people who do know what they need to do.
---
In the end though if you really want to play Ret, do it. Just know that you will have a very hard time getting the gear you need to be decent.
---
I wouldn't mind cherry picking some of the features from X-packs to be honest;
---
- Arenas are quite good and add more variety to PvP
---
- Heroics are potentially good as lead-in content to Raids or as alternative content for people that can't Raid but have still cleared out all the dungeons,
---
- Other continents are fine, but I don't think they should have "new" capital cities on them - they should function just like additional zones. 
---
- Some new races wouldn't be a bridge too far, especially since there are so many races in the WoW lore that have populations conceivably big enough to warrant being playable.

I never heard that one back then. I played UO though and it had a different lingo than EQ.

---
Going from Whitemaine to Bleu
---
You can have arenas, but pvp gear should not be based around them. It has been a detriment to class identity balancing around arena. Let's not go down that path again.
---
Same haha, loved hearing the shoutout to druid
---
and there's a large chunk of the classic playerbase that's not even subbed or has names reserved on servers...50% more? twice as many? who knows how many...
---
Streamers are smart like the rest of us. You either have a separate account save the name or you have a friend do it for you.
---
You and i*
---
yeah see on lowest settings how retail runs and you can switch wow.classix to classic settings  and the games graphics are dramatically  reduced
---
I think alot of people claiming to have raided in classic back in 04,05,and 06 are gonna see things alot differently when they get to 60 raiding. And damage wasn't a warlocks problem. It was always threat that restrained them until they get 8 peice tier 2 or the set bonus for threat reduction in tier 3 for destruction. Always saw warrior damage as 5th in line to the 4 straight dps classes when I raided in mid 2000s. Your warrior top dps is from private server data. Go look at the damage on private servers in duels against warriors. They dont even hafta put on a sheild when fighting hunters. In classic theyd get crit and torn apart like a rogue if a hunter got on em without a sheild at ranged.Thats what made me start noticing the strange unfamiliar damage numbers given and taken with type of gear the players had on. All the people preaching claim alot of things they know but beleive me back when this game was at 1.12 if a offspec was out damaging a pure dps spec it would have been scaled down. Every straight dps class then had some kind of threat reduction and still could hit threat cap on tanks if they tried to push threshhold. So Im not convinced that a warriors damage at limit of a tanks ability would be higher than those with threat reduction when warriors have none.They pull even more threat because their melee. Ive seen some cases where one could place good on a meter. But they were never consistent. Ive seen alot of them die from threat. And in all fairness they are not suppose to be as consistent as straight dps. You can argue your point all you want but even if a fury warrior is really good at playing their class Ive never seen them not have limits for a reason. Your private server knowledge isnt how this game is gonna work. Tanks can actually get hit alot harder which means less threat more midigation. And private server players are gonna see alot more limits. Im not advocating the nerf of any class. But from what I played 14 and 13 years ago all straight dps classes were comparable in some way. But I never seen consistency from any warrior. Not saying they couldnt do damage. Just not as good as the ones made for it over all. People dont want to just understand when you change just a few things you destroy classes viabilities and the very reason they were tuned the way they were for the purpose they were suppose to serve in raiding. Warriors were made with better damage than other offspecs for raiding because you cant raid without them. Outa all other offspecs and memes only warriors are a necessity.
---
I've said it before but nothing wrong with just adding the new races and maybe the new classes, adding in new Azeroth zones but leave the flying out of it.
---
Could be the dumbest fuckin post I've ever seen.  You deserve to have your name nabbed

You didn’t link the video lol

This is classic man, don't worry so much about having to justify everything to some of the elitists on this sub. With that said though, you are a madman for wanting to listen to gun sounds.

Grim released his movie where he fights Sommerfuglen (Thinks that is his name) so ofc i kept spamming sommer with ”WHERE U RUNNING” to the point where i never got into his group again during BWL progress, i dont think he liked me very much after that
---
Apologies if my goal is have a discussion instead of just see who can have the best *gotcha* responses.
---
&gt; Last response.
---
Thank God. Take your "suggestions" of making Classic not Classic with you.
---
Really bgs were on the stress test why won't they be on launch?
---
How TF could they allow so many people to sign up and not cap it at some point. There must be like 80k players on that server.
---
Reminds me of struggling in Dark Souls with the area that has all the ghosts because I never thought to use the item that curses you . . . because why would anyone curse themselves?
---
That was done by many during beta and the last stress test. Those are over now until launch as far as I know.
---
Unrelated: How do I delete someone else's post on Reddit?
---
If you want to "tryhard" shouldn't you "tryhard" to find your own quests/quest items? 
---
Jk (but not really)
---
Girl?
---
Gank in terms of gaming is generally kill someone in an underhanded way, which a lowbie being killed is. Doesn't need to be repeated multiple times.
---
I like blind bid dkp
---
yeah this was like Blizz pulling a Nintendo, purposefully create small batches to increase hype and create fake scarcity. Works every time, can't find an SNES classic because none are in stock, can't find a Switch when they came out because they can't keep them stocked
---
Blizz is learningggggg or being effected by Activision or both.
---
and if they had made 10 of each server, things would be evenly spaced and you'd have people complaining that it's going to be dead at launch lmao
---
Can't please anyone, so this is the route they chose.
---
/speculation
---
Alt tab out, open browser, go to Google translate, type in instructions, copy paste in to chat.
---
Problem solved
---
The people on Herod picked it because their options at the time were the streamer server, the Portuguese server, or Herod.
---
Do the grind for Bloodsail and Steamwheedle exalted at the same time :D
---
Why gimp yourself not using charge? With a few points in tactical mastery you can get good range to demo shout and without tactical mastery you can thunderclap and go into d stance. It's easy to macro the stance swaps too.
---
2h fury is the best leveling spec until 40+.
---
Sitting down pre combat, taking a hit to trigger the procs, then destroying the mob.
---
It is an easy algorithm but afaik they never announced how they’re doing it. Their rhetoric on the classic forum posts makes it look like they’re just counting total character count per server for a rough estimate.
---
I'm thinking EPGP for my guild. I want to find a way that everyone feels their time and effort is rewarded. I don't like the idea of policing who gets what, even though I know it will hinder progress. I'd rather everyone was just having a good time.
---
I would never be in a guild that didn't use raid council.
---
That is a common complaint with retail WoW - sensory overload. It's just too much in your face. Classic WoW gives you a completely open world but throws nothing in your face. The narrator at the beginning hypes you up for your roll in the world, but after that you are on your own buddy. Make your own kind of music.
---
&gt; You are asking [insert numerous, divergent group] to not discriminate
---
 - person who proceeds to discriminate.
---
theres an amazing Blaumeux waifu on the Blaumeux discord right now
---
funny thing is everyone is now going here so i would not be surprised if it ends up being overpopulated as well
---
If it was just ok then go ahead and try out the hunter. If you want a mystical style toon with pets then there is always the warlock lol. All three choices would be nice for solo play. Especially the hunter and warlock since they do have pets
---
So is it a book on writing LUA?
---
I dunno, but it had no consequences for the ones doing it. And I am not the only one who has experienced this.
---
Hmm really? I could be wrong. Regardless it more or less developed around the same sphere.
---
Oh shit you're close! I'm next to old Turner field!
---
AAAAAGH, AUGH AUGH
---
Clever!
---
I reserved my names but that's it.  No expectation I'm going to level in a timely manner that first week.
---
Favorite: Loot council where everyone on the council is a a longtime friend of mine.
---
2nd favorite: DKP with reserved items for main tank.  As long as everything is transparent and you prevent dumb shit like hunters trying to get a thunderfury then it's honestly the best way to go.
---
NO BRAKES!!!
---
Unfortunately no. You’ll have to do it on launch.
---
Ah, we all have to learn one way or another. Way better to find a girl that likes you for who you are instead of a girl you feel like you need to impress anyway.
---
God what a perfect specimen he is
---
What you mean? At the very least it gives us all free months of subscription?
---
Do a pros, cons list. I'll get you started.
---
Hunters: Best levellers, Underpopulated as a class (few of them), best class in pvp at fighting max range/kiting, very good dps early patches, high dps can compensate for lack of skill.
---
Cons: DPS falls off late in classic, versus the very best players you will struggle.
---
Mages: Good AOE levellers, free food, city portals, one of the best dps, one of the best pvp classes, will not fall off as classic progresses.
---
Cons: Incredibly overpopulated (good luck getting group/loot), requires a lot of skill to be proficient at pvp with.
---
Definitely Hunter or Warlock. They’re both really fun for solo play.
---
It’s in the content patch. Original wow didn’t have battlegrounds in it, and once they did it was only WSG and AV. Arathi Basin will also arrive in a later phase.. I think 5 but could be wrong on that one.
---
The honor system isn’t being added til phase 2, so in phase 1 (MC/Ony) - PVP is just for fun.
---
No worries at all, I normally take everything on Reddit with a huge grain of salt anyways. I appreciate you saying that though, most people on here wouldn't.
---
I had a ton of fun in vanilla content during bc playing a frost mage, a bit dependant on a high stamina build but really satisfying mowing down a large group of (melee) monsters.
---
Hunter is good for solo play since it has a little helper with them at all times but it does require bullets/arrows and food for the pet.
---
Who looks for their adoptive daughter when you can play some homeless dude in Gwent to get those sweet ass cards?
---
Red = Dead
---
 I walk you through the theorycrafting, explain the math, and then you calculate a rogue timing backstab with every FH to refute me. You then completely ignore the math done (which accounted for 4 melees getting Howl), and say: 
---
&gt;"...your math looks good, but wrong things don't become true, just because you put some statistic data next to it."
---
I literally don't know another way to theorycraft. Don't forget to not vote in your next election.
---
Correct. But not all. I think people are missing the wording there
---
The new 60 content they have hinted at makes me so happy. Yes i want to experience all of the raids that i never had a chance to on retail vanilla - but the fact they are willing to consider adding more .... this is my viagra
---
My whole guild want to play PVE and I'm soo bummed by that decision. Glad to hear that blizzard is listening to the community here though
---
Haha, but you learned a valuable lesson at least ;)
---
Never heard of it, thanks for the heads up!
---
The toxicity on the Classic forums is unbelieveable.
---
Use a beta sandbox, transfer files across folders (you will need to rename the folders)
---
This is your best bet.
---
I'm pretty sure it is. Anyway, I'd be surprised if it turns out to be a lot of non-English speaking on Firemaw. Seems to be mostly scandinavians so far and most of us are pretty decent at English.
---
I will be messaging you on [**2019-09-02 23:55:05 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2019-09-02%2023:55:05%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://np.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/csi0f9/psa_you_can_still_sell_your_leather_on_the_ah_its/exga56n/)

Oh so it did work that way in vanilla tho?
---
... to Skeramistan!
---
Hehe, it was mostly a bad joke, I know you don't have to spend 23 hours a day in a gym to look like that :p
---
Bingo
---
When you do the math and you lose more personal dps from using a wolf than the raid gains from the choice, its suboptimal. It's like saying 2&gt;3 because I like 2 more.
---
You’re purposely taking the literal definition of the word when you know that’s not what it means in a gaming context lol
---
I've been following this sub religiously and haven't made a character or anything, I can't think of 6 people alongside me that are going to sign up lol it's going to be an absolute shit show
---
Mcdonalds

I'm a rogue, and the rules of engagement need not apply.

I know what that means. It means IT'S OVER 9,000!!!!!!!!!!!

Sheep, kite with blink, iceblock.

Yeah that's my main worry. They should have a grace timer where the name is attached to your account for a certain amount of time after deleting.
---
Out.
---
And by the way, you don't want that
---
Great response 👍
---
Just thought I'd try to teach you something.  It's totally cool if you want to revel in your own ignorance though...
---
Where'd you get 45 from? Doesn't seem right to me

I appreciate the response.  Again, sorry and good luck to you.
---
It’s 8 hours a day. Hardcore guilds are getting 60 earlier than that. And it’s a goal, not a requirement. Many people are taking 4-6 weeks and that’s ok if they let us know that.
---
You should set foot on an NA server some time. I think you’d be surprised by what you see.
---
The Stalaggtites will always have the fraternal support of the Skeramistani.
---
Bite is not a focus dump. It has a 10 second cooldown.
---
YOU THINK YOU DO!!!!!!!!!!
---
(Sorry, has to be done again)
---
Its going to be unplayable for a few days anyways... hopefully by Friday night we can get in.
---
i wish lol
---
Sorry, I didn't understand all that. What do you mean made, ward, and mate?
---
Well now I'm just confused. You'll be playing Diablo: Immortal so what do you need Classic for?
---
Oh, MARTA, I miss thee.
---
Hunter seems like a perfect fit
---
No way the tourists last that long. And I’m not counting someone who comes from BFA and ends up loving classic as a tourist. That’s a convert. And they will
---
Can’t remember the story, but didn’t Henry Cavill miss a callback from a respected director or something after auditioning for a movie because he was playing WoW?
---
You think we will, but we won't.
