someone call you a bondulance

---
My main in vanilla was druid and I got the game not knowing anything about it. Had the time of my life playing that character.
---
10$ for unlimited damn thata cheap, you must not live in canada,
---
oh, that makes sense then. i thought some of the footage was of duskwood and was like ???
---
Holy fuck that is brutal
---
It's really good as long as you guys can enough time together. Just make sure you leave your quests for completion with your partner, when solo you could do some professions/grinding/dungeons on your own.
---

---
What you gain from duo-leveling is an easier, more fun experience. Survivability in PvP and PvE allows more room for error. You can probably do big pulls when sweeping strikes is up, have your Priest SW:P everything and heal the Warr.
---
Different kind of grind the leveling 1-120 in retail just feels so damn tedious. You fly through quest fill up the bar pop the level but there‚Äôs stretches with no rewards. You don‚Äôt need to visit class trainers you don‚Äôt get a talent point every level. You can quest in zones while queuing for dungeons and never make a friend. 
---
In vanilla yes it‚Äôs a grind probablylonger I‚Äôd say. But during that you get rewards every level. You make acquaintances that you will see again because you level at the same pace. Oh that‚Äôs the guy I just ran WC with getting mobbed by three things let me help him out. You join guilds and beg for help when being camped and they used to show up. Now you send messages into guilds and no one responds post your mythic+ on the lfg tool and discriminate because well there‚Äôs no reason not to your not restricted by server population. Where in classic after 25minutes trying to fill a specific class people give up and are like okay bring anything let‚Äôs get this shit show going.
---
Personally I remember everything in the early game (1-30ish) and the late game (PVP, raiding) extremely well, but I think I've blacked out 40-59 on all my characters. That shit is a grind lol
---
Yep.  Even if you pretend you are a cat-rogue or a bear-warrior, you still benefit from being able to toss a heal on between fights.  That alone makes you way better at leveling than either of those.  It also makes you better than priest or mage.
---
Wow that guy is good, you should check out some of his other works
---
is spriest dps good? I know they eat mana like crazy, but otherwise
---
We‚Äôd troll the alliance PvP vendors, start some fun stuff
---
It‚Äôs a $10 upgrade on top of the $45 I already pay.
---
You have to wonder which graveyard Manriks wife ended up at for her to take so long on a corpse run.
---
You're not the only one. My patience has vanished ever since the bait and switch news of the beta being near release. I was able to keep my hype under control for the first few years but now I'm getting stir crazy.
---
Hey all. After making a bunch of Memories videos and Top 5s, I thought I might try my hand at some guides. And what better way to start than with loot!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Sifting through spreadsheets and databases galore, I have compiled what I think will prove to be the most efficient method of gearing a fresh 60 priest (and really any healer tbh) in Phase 1 of WoW Classic. Especially now that we have a pretty good idea of what loot will be available at launch (1.12 itemization but minus items that were added in 1.10 AND no DM), I thought it's probably a good time to start making these types of guides.
---
 I hope you find it useful! Enjoy and let me know what you think! \^\_\^
---
They're competitive on shorter fights if they bring lots of consumables. Long fights are terrible, though. SW:Pains mana cost is absurd to have to reapply multiple times.
---
Yeah I called in to work once for 35 seconds and my bank said stop that.
---
The irony of this post getting in the way of me looking for shitty memes.
---
I already pay 36$ for 100 minute unlimites text message and 1gb of data(i was a deal for the data, normaly its 500mb)

---
They absolutely are not.
---
It will be nigh impossible as an undead. As you start with a faction rep penalty.
---
Expect to be around 1/3 - 1/2 through revered @60 unless you prioritize cloth turn ins while grinding 50-60.
---
Free? Where we're going....we don't have free.
---
oh it's def worth doing once thru lib+arm+cath at least just for the quest xp.  Also on alliance the SM quest gives you an awesome 2hander.
---
Not on that fight, and you still don't need to see health and mana.
---
I was fortunate enough to have the OG tabard to get the Scarlet Transmog set. I use Herod‚Äôs shoulder as part of the set, it‚Äôs iconic.  
---
Great artwork, OP.
---
The only race that can come even remotley close is a human questing for Night Elf or Dwarf rep.
---
Even then I would only expect 2/3 into revered max by 60 through questing.
---
They said they weren't doing RPPVP servers.  Are they doing RPPVE servers still?
---
It's not incorrect.
---
I'm slightly insulted that they even call that World of Warcraft.
---
I'll take my Donald's if I don't have to deal with Stabbyu's.

[&lt;God Tier Gaming&gt; - Alliance |NA ‚Äì PvE| Semi-Casual]
---
Introduction: 
---
God Tier Gaming is a fresh community that is preparing the Classic WoW launch. Our main goal is to enjoy what Classic has to offer.  We will be a guild focusing on Classic WoW. We are not just an alt guild from retail that is dipping into classic for the nostalgia of it all. Our core has experience with Classic WoW and are looking forward to move ahead through the content all while enjoying the game.
---
Recruitment:
---
We are recruiting all dedicated and focused raiders for our main raid team that want to experience this content. We are looking to fill OT roles as well as dps and heals. Even though that the main focus will be for raiding that is not all this community has to offer. We are also looking for any members that just want to enjoy the game.
---
Expectations: 
---
We are open to any class, and any spec. We believe it is the player that truly matters. Currently, our raiding rosters have room for any dedicated player no matter what class they want to play. We expect main team raiders to put in the required effort during progression that is needed to push forward. We will be using Loot Council when we have a full roster. When not raiding, we expect our members to uphold themselves with manners and respect.
---
Guild Culture:
---
We want this to be more than a guild but a community.  We are committed to building a guild environment that is friendly and helpful and is respected throughout our server.
---
Raid Times: 
---
Wednesday and Thursday - 7:30-10:30pm Central / 8:30-11:30pm Eastern / 5:30-8:30pm Pacific
---
Please feel free to contact the guild leadership on discord with any questions or concerns.

Well it was more powerful for someone who doesn't care to learn how to write all those fancy scripts!
---
It's part of retail sub
---
I've heard bats being thrown around as an easy to get alternative.
---
PST-EST?
---
Most people don't level in a group though.
---
Or you could use a spreadsheet and use filters:  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e7nMh8IaH5mNZ7MOx2it8MF7ULYdCIT0VqO6ubaUDq4/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e7nMh8IaH5mNZ7MOx2it8MF7ULYdCIT0VqO6ubaUDq4/edit#gid=0)
---
Bro, you absolutely could not shadowmeld in combat. You could shadowmeld out of feign, but you can't just drop combat with feign.
---
You got a writeup? Hard to use a video as a guide.
---
Factorio with Pyanodon mods only, boy do i think now what a cakewalk bob+angel's playthrough has been.
---
Druid is one of the fastest levelers.  Lot of fun too.
---
I'm leveling a tauren shaman as 1h+shield into enhancement with skinning/herb (eventually dropping skinning for alch, probably) and likely will be leveling a troll shadow priest as my first alt. 
---
I've already got a guaranteed raiding spot as well.
---
Hot damn! Thank you!
---
Do you know why that is?
---
First aid, it really helps sustain speed while leveling, and you'll need it at cap. consider cooking or fishing in addition to help with the food load.
---
That is not quite true.
---
Asheron's Call is one example of an MMORPG that predates WoW by 5 years and in which player created add ons were prevailant and widley accepted by the game developers.
---
Ah man I haven‚Äôt even thought about finding a raid...that‚Äôs months down the road for me
---
yo dude, chill. I didn't downvote you. I was just explaining why the downvotes. No need to be a dick about it.
---
But you if you avoid skinning before 40 you won't be able to skin those beasts so you'd need to go back and farm a whole bunch of lower level mobs. 
---
Best bet is to just skin everything as you level but not be afraid do just ditch scraps and lower level leather so you can pick up more valuable vendor trash.
---
what does that stand for
---
If there are mobs you off tank that deal mostly fire, nature, or frost damage, they would actually be great. Kinda specific though.
---
My wife and I played Vanilla together and ran SM so often that ‚ÄúRelease the hounds!‚Äù (we have dogs) and ‚ÄúArise, my champion!‚Äù Are still catchphrases of ours.
---
Absolutely! The links for the items are in the description and the full written guide is over at http://silvitesoltis.blogspot.com/2019/04/a-simplified-healing-priest-gearing.html

Enjoy! ^_^

I agree.
---
Really? On 1.12 and it seems like they work on private servers.
---
\*Gets ganked by 4 rogues\*
---
Their names? Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young.
---
Thanks!
---
but my friends are in WoW classic... we can't communicate atm
---
Source?
---
For what we know for now is that it classic wow will just run off the normal retail sub.
---
Everything
---
Two 60 rogues, one rank 10. 60 warrior, rank 8. 60 priest, didn't PvP much on him. Cleared MC with a roommates guild. Had 3 epic mounts. Mostly did PvP, predominantly played rogue. 
---
Recently played rogue/priest on a private server, raided with both, priest as shadow (awful experience raiding, honestly). Rogue was fun, was neat to be geared to the teeth as a rogue, but also negatively enlightening. Currently playing ele shaman on another private server, possibly the most entertaining class I've ever PvPed on. Spriest is also extremely enjoyable to PvP on regardless of gear.
---
Go level some for fun.
---
All those mobs you skip with stealth, just gonna make you have to grind extra later. Classic is not about skipping mobs while leveling, but rather kill everything you see towards your destination. Sure It CAN help to stealth past mobs/groups you would not be able to kill.
---
Depending on your class you'll have spots fall into your lap. Never enough healers or warlocks in raids.
---
All classes offer unique abilities which appeal to people but they also have downsides. All classes have a trade-off which is why I found it so difficult.
---
I‚Äôm a hunter so I‚Äôll be fighting for a spot haha

Go alliance lock and you'll have your pick of guilds to raid with. Healing on a shaman will still get you plenty of enhancement gear, just get r10 and get spinal reaper because nobody else in the raid should ever want it.

Wetlands is an Alliance questing zone, mate. Might want to change your plans a little bit.
---
This bag giveaway really stands out to me lol heavily leaning towards priest now.
---
Loved seeing that green ‚Äòno problems‚Äô circle back then. Fuggin comcast.
---
I don't think this is accurate, this macro was a staple on my Hunter:
---
/cast Feign Death
---
/cast Freezing Trap
---
I just like to raise awareness :D
---
check out finalflash on youtube, after that you just have to decide your faction xD
---
Alliance get pve advantage, horde get pvp. That‚Äôs a pretty common understanding between factions.
---
It is 100% possible to make it through the portal without having to do it as a ghost.
---
Your route from the boat needs to be adjusted.
---
You'd be surprised how many hunters will quickly lose their spots due to the fact that 99% of hunters are utterly fucking brain-dead. It's a catch-all class for Legolas autists and twitch thots.
---
Sorry that was my half assed response getting into my car after work!
---
In all honesty, I wish I could experience the game with virgin eyes as you will this summer!
---
I think there will be a ton of casual guilds recruiting and you will set find a place with guildes who will guide you in your noobness! Check the guild recruitment thread on Monday‚Äôs if you want to find a home before launch!
---
Otherwise, think about faction, class, race and PvP vs. PvE. That alone should occupy your thoughts for weeks!
---
Don‚Äôt over do it in research, soak up the fun when the game comes out and learn as you go. The levelling process is slow enough that you can practice/master your class as you progress and play with others. 
---
My two cents! Enjoy!
---
He said they could out dps frost mages.
---
"That's wrong. Moonkin dps (starfire spam) scales better than frost mage dps, and substantially better than shadow priest dps, since spriest gets next to no value from crit. "
---
I know that to be true, I was the second hunter in a heroic progression guild in cata, a good 20ilvl lower than top dps player, and I was still second on the meters most fights. The other hunter was second to last üòÇ
---
This needs more upvotes
---
I agree with that, but the weapons are still better than AQ40. Why can‚Äôt they be pushed back til AQ release?
---
Yeah it‚Äôs the ashenvale one that they pulled, I can understand though lol.
---
Can you make one for warrior please? Interesting to see the phase 1 specific gearing guide
---
As far as i know, FD doesn't have a global cooldown and is an instant cast, so you can cast it at the same as another instant skill, such as traps
---
*smacks veins on forearm*
---
Y‚Äôall got anymore of them blue posts? I just need one to tide me over.
---
Im looking to do it as orc - getting excited with UC by the way
---
I also love desolace. Usually hella peacefull and some solid quests.
---
I live in Irvine and pass the Blizzard HQ frequently on my work commute.  I‚Äôm struggling more than you know.
---
Kazzack will likely be leashed, but Teremus the Devourer can destroy stormwind just fine, so hopefully he's kiteable.
---
https://youtu.be/28uB4ym6TCM
---
Apparently gnomes can do it by 40.  I'm wondering what the difference is for orc getting enough UC rep
---
SM ( the entirety) is one of my favorite all time MMO dungeons. Love this comic! Keep up the good work
---
All the dungeons are amazing if you go with an appropriately (or slightly under) leveled group. I leveled on nost as a prot paladin and having to figure out different pulls based on the dungeon and group comp was a blast.
---
Mages have to carry around 40 stacks of created food and distribute, similar to locks
---
warlock, big dick shadowbolt energy and also you will develop a fetish for shadow priests
---
It's definitely on the table. Priest/healer was first since that's what I was most interested in, but I can see myself working on a warrior one in the coming weeks.
---
Tank or DPS though? :P
---
Damn I forgot the form used to not affect your mount.
---
You're right. I was mistaken. It was TBC when you could meld in combat. I was wrong. The process was feign then meld while feign Cd counted down. My bad. Been. A long time.
---
Also, the acquaintances you meet, you can add to your friends list because they are actual players on your realm and not sharding from random servers (who you will likely never see again). 
---
So whether you level at the same pace or not, you can keep tabs on them and see them again at 60 later.
---
Not really. I gave my thoughts and you were deeply offended when I called bullshit on your strawman argument.
---
You are still flailing like child hurling insults. It's just quality entertainment at this point.
---
Since I'm trying to have as close to a vanilla experience as possible, I'm not doing any planning at all. I know the class and faction and  that's about the extent of my planning. I want it to be as organic of an experience as possible.
---
Wrong dragon, this one spawn in Ashenvale
---
Agree with the avoiding cesspool guilds. Shop around for a guild with your values or maybe quest/dungeon with people and decide later if you like the vibe. Don‚Äôt accept any invite from a random guild, you will likely regret it.
---
It's a forked Legion client so it'll be separate from the retail client.
---
This 110%. It‚Äôs great to mentor new players who are genuinely interested in learning the ropes!
---
I started playing retail after years off just to hold myself over for classic
---
yikes how many rogues! This made me think, probably someone in that pic is actually dead
---
I played human rogue on pserver last year and the competition for swords in raids is absolutely fierce. Fighting against dps warriors for brut blade and viskag is so frustrating. Although my guild had terrible luck with perd blade as well tbf, only had one drop from release through AQ
---
Why would it get harder and harder to keep aggro.
---
YES!

Took me literally 2 seconds with google.

But the Horde wear red.
---
Priests have basically zero downtime, unlike a lot of other classes.
---
I‚Äôve never done SFK in vanilla or ever. I‚Äôm gonna make sure I do
---
Yes, pally skills and talents are beta in this guide
---
Nice vid
---
[removed]
---
Pve- Your set up is wrong, as dagger user u dont take imp evasion / imp evis, so you can complete the talent 4/5 aggresion and also ruthlessness. Changing murder to evis for aq40. 
---
About the race, seems you made your choice but to be honest, if youre going alliance just go Human. Being daggers as pver is really hard, the only raid you will be feeling comfy with is bwl but not the rest. Swords is overall better, daggers are not even close. 
---
Also the reputation 10% racial helps a lot at the begining of the game, so yeah, thats my opinion.
---
I did a lot of PVP in Vanilla. I WPVP'd all the time, and everywhere anyone pretty much can and does mention. The single spot I made most of my kills (and probably was killed) in WPVP was Thorium Point. Picking off incoming raiders was best. It was fun and really gave someone the edge when BG's were slow.   
---
The simple fact of the matter is that the Vanilla PVP ladder made people PVP, and if they wanted to be competitive, they needed to WPVP.   
---
But, that leads into why it's the best. When you are out there grinding out honor with other people doing the same thing, there's a lasting bond that forms. Even members of the opposite faction become close friends. 
---
In my merry band of idiots, 4 of us played together in retail vanilla, 2 of us were horde, 2 of us were alliance. (Orc Warrior, Dwarf Paladin, Human Rogue, Orc Hunter)
---
I mean, if you insist...
---
Blessing of kings works on agi, not on ap
---
Not having to deal with the brutal fight for swords/maces definitely has its appeal. And it's not like the other rogues care about fist weapons much either if you find yourself dying for a raw damage upgrade and can't get perds.
---
Pissing off the purists is case enough right?
---
Curious about addons too
---
&gt;top tier
---
Mages and Druids still beat them soundly. Strong mid-tier maybe.
---
I'll be honest: I have basically zero raiding experience. From what I've heard, it's just as you say: a lot of competition for swords, but you also gotta be a bit lucky to get your prefered weapon, so limiting yourself to daggers has its pros and cons. I chalked it up to be a net neutral, so I didn't mention it.
---
On the topic of swords vs daggers, I've also heard people say that sword/maces are less dominant for Alliance due to the absence of Windfury, since WF gives a bigger DpS boost to slower weapons.
---
Mages farm Hearthglen in WPL also.  Handful of humanoid elites at a time high enough level to farm BoE's and general humanoid drops like runecloth.  Lots of spots to run to in there to farm while other areas respawn, rich thorium nodes are common, and its generally low traffic since its an elite area with a choke point at the tower gates.  You'll sometimes get the occasional Crusader Enchant farmer curious whats back there, and you'll definitely get miners on circuit, but use the elites to your advantage in PvP.
---
r/shittytumblrgifs
---
I'm with you. I don't plan on trying for some speed run record or anything. I however do plan on hitting 60 about a week after launch, and I leveled 4 characters to max in retail vanilla. The fastest of which was a mage that I did in under a week while on summer vacation (no idea what the /played was, but I did it in under a week real time).
---
So while I plan on somewhat enjoying the experience instead of following a guide to the T, I'll be going to what I remember being the best areas and leveling hard.
---
What do you like about it over the other two?
---
Decide which 3 u want then play them based on your priorities. Im thinking of starting hunter, making a warrior around 40s or 50s. Then eventually a rogue. 
---
Thing is, I can see myself getting bored or almost burnt out on 1 character because alot of the classes are simple.
---
It's a good way to take a break if you hit a wall too.
---
I never played Vanilla so I‚Äôve no prior experience to go on, only from the retail version
---
All 19 twinks struggle big time to get the bis hat, that's the main thing imo.
---
It's because Vanilla was rushed to release, those pets didn't get the attention/abilities they deserved.
---
Oh okay.
---
Wow that brings back memories... thank you
---
Did you go SM or put the last 5 pts in 15% Stam?
---
'strawman' is idiot-speak for 'I can't refute that'.
---
Quillboars, I believe.
---
I meant red as hostile.
---
That makes sense, I think you're right.
---
An old guild master of mine would stack thorns items and chain pull entire low level dungeons on his paladin.
---
Yeah r/wow is veeeeeeeeeeeeeery toxic. 
---
This one dude literally harassed me via PMs and alt accounts when I commented something bad about BfA. 
---
I got ignored by the mods when I told them. 
---
So I just stay away from that sub now.
---
never enough warlocks?
---
aren't they one of the easiest to level?
---
It's possible on private servers if you use supermacro. Can't remember the exact commands I used, but basically you just do an "if mana &lt; 90, then cast frostbolt rank 1, else if mana &lt;180..." till you get to max rank.
---
No idea if the classic client will allow anything similar.
---
I'll be out there slinking about in the dark, wearing my [Catseye Ultra Goggles], with my super-NE-stealth.
---
Thicc bois are the best.
---
All this time, I was thinking of playing a druid. But I am thinking now I will play a warrior as I'd much rather tank or dps than heal in the late game, and the higher demand cements that...
---
We get it, you want to play nelf. That doesn't make it good though. And that's ok.
---
Pre MC daggers wayyyyyy underperform vs swords is a big problem. You may want to go swords even as NE until you get felstriker (probably will never happen) or perd blade/core hound tooth
---
This is a brilliant guide! Just what I‚Äôve been looking for.
---
I had a 4 person kerfuffle over a black lotus for like 3 minutes once. It was amazing.
---
&gt;Warrior is the king. If you want to get a spot in the raid and have no problem with the leveling, go warrior. 
---
We'll see. Definitely hasn't been the case on private servers. Warrior is generally the first class that raid guilds stop accepting in my experience. There's just so many of them. And the people who decide to play Warrior to 60 tend to be very hardcore, which makes the competition even tougher to stand out.
---
If you don't take imp evasion/sprint, the points you free can't go into the Ass tree, since those points are needed just to advance in the Combat tree (they're essentially filler). You could put them in Deflection instead, but that seems rather useless unless you're agroing a lot?
---
As for Improved Evis and Ruthlessness, I'm not a big fan of those since most of your energy goes into backstabbing, so you use finishers less often than swordies. Evis barely sees any use from my understanding. 
---
Reputation racial seems like a QoL perk, kinda like how NE get faster ghost form. Not saying their equal, but it's of little importance to fighting performance.
---
Haha I got downvoted to -100 when i said the Horde storywriting is horrible in BfA.
---
Now everyone is posting about how bad the horde plot is in BfA.
---
as someone rolling alliance.. 
---
kill all the fucking gnomes
---
you want to go imp. SS and remorseless first, then respec hemo at 30 skipping all the dagger talents and getting the imp. stealth ones instead. then you go back into combat for the +hit and offhand dmg talents. lvling straight sub is seriously painful, don‚Äôt recommended it. one respec while lvling isnt gunna set you back. the build is better in tbc when remorsless works with hemo, but its still good in vanilla especially if you find yourself in stv or any big pvp zone. its a pretty decent indicator if someone is giving advice and doesn‚Äôt recognize that this build is legit you can go ahead and forget whatever they said. yes the traditional combat spec is better in a vacuum but this hemo build is very strong and much better suited for dealing with opposing faction gankers.
---
The whole point of my post is to say that it is good enough. Where am I wrong in my reasoning? I do care about min/maxing, which is why I would not play NE Priest.
---
I want to try and do every dungeon as I level in classic
---
Looked your talent tree again, imp gouge is not something you should take in pve, you should go 3/5 in the dodge talent and 1/5 in the parry one. This is not because you will aggro but just keep in mind monsters also cleave. 
---
Ruthlessness is the base of your dps, backstab will be your main sustance of CP but remember you will have to maintain always SnD. 
---
So the rotation would be 3 BS - SnD - (you may get 1 free CP, so you save 60 energy) then 5 BS - SnD and if the boss is dying just use eviscerate. 
---
Imp evis is for aq40 since t2.5 gives you more dmg with it and also there is when a book for a higher rank of evis releases.
---
I‚Äôve only just twigged this is one of the lines for grom hellscream in WC3
---
Does it not rain in wow anymore?
---
Good to know. I'll consider it when I get there. Then again, I might also be okay with underperforming pre-MC, since it doesn't matter too much while the difficulty is still low.
---
Thanks for the info tho, really!
---
You've completely devolved into making no sense at all.
---
Let's watch you attempt to rationalize this one.
---
There is one Priest in the raid that specs into Shadow Weaving and just keeps that buff up for the Warlocks  while mostly healing
---
Ah yes
---
**Herod The Scarlet Chad**
---
Imo you can play the hybrid you want and and be decent damage or support (even in more serious groups). Just be prepared to try 150% harder than other dps and to show your worth in additional ways too. Lots of players will probably be more experimental this time around.
---
Are you able to do class and race combo?
---
They do.
---
Tomorrow is Friday.  Maybe we will get an update.  Maybe we don‚Äôt.  Either way, tomorrow is Friday - so that‚Äôs nice.
---
The problem is at least on pservers melee really have to carry the raid in MC so you need every ounce of DPS you can get. It depends if blizzard does progressive itemization though since the patches after MC buffed caster gear and let them compete more
---
I want to recreate the first character I ever made, a Tauren druid, and do every dungeon as I level. That's about it
---
Feral druid has basically no downtime when grinding mobs, in either bear or cat, thanks to an abundance of pocket heals. Bear is my personal preference, since I can keep its health up just with the bear heal. Don't even need to shapeshift ever, just run around faerie firing stuff.
---
If you are talking about the current PVP private server, then yes. The warriors are saturated, also confirmed by my personal experience. However, the people's survey shows that they have fewer interests in playing a warrior then the raid needs.
---
Night elf rogue is fine lmao, they were the most popular Alliance rogue race by a solid margin in retail Vanilla. They fit really well thematically as rogues and have great animations. If Niar can reach r14 as a rogue and go down as one of the GOATs of the class by playing the "worst race" then you should be fine
---
Uh yeah, that's right. That's why it affects the 26 agility of 2x BSH and not the dal'rends set bonus. Not sure what you're meaning here sorry.
---
&gt; Also mind that armors models are made for humans as the main body style
---
You're really reaching for reasons to not play a NE with that one.
---
My way of thinking about dungeons is this: you can‚Äôt really do them when your high level, so why pass up free content while you‚Äôre leveling?
---
That's my plan.
---
I'm a shameless altoholic and an inveterate lover of meme specs. I plan to have at least one character of every class and, of those, my mage will be arcane, my shaman will be elemental, my paladin will be ret and/or prot, one of my druids will be balance and one of my hunters will be survival.
---
I've absolutely no illusions about my ever getting into any sort of serious progression raiding guild with a playstyle like that, nor would I dream of blaming those folks for not wanting to group with me.
---
Fortunately, I also have precious little interest in raiding in the first place. I'm sure I'll do some of it eventually, probably dipping my toes into Onyxia/MC when most other guilds are working on AQ or something. Mostly I'll be doing PvP and continuing to advocate for the removal of DHKs (at least on PvP servers) so world PvP and city raids can become a thing again post-Phase 2.
---
Azeroth's plenty big enough for all of us to play the way we want to with others who feel similarly without ever stepping on each others' toes.
---
I love that guy.
---
A lot of talk from the faction that has trolls that were nearly wiped to extinction by murlocs and a lvl 9 named NPC
---
Shadylol, zenedar EU horde, guy was a beast
---
Ok, you've convinced me on most of your points.
---
Here's my new build: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#f0gcoLZMei00Ez0boV
---
The only thing I disagree with is how you say that taking Imp evasion-sprint reduces dps. The reason it doesn't is because you are forced to spend 15 points in the first 3 tiers of combat. I did still move those points to improve dodge/parry tho, since I can see how that'd be more useful.
---
yes yes good, everyone talk about how bad they are so there will be less people trying to take my special single raid spot
---
&gt;I do care about min/maxing
---
Then don't roll NE rogue, it's the worst race for rogues on alliance side, the agi and stealth bonus is too small compared to the other racials.
---
The only class that can get away with being a NE on alliance side is hunter.
---
More often than not the Ret in the raid isn't bottom on dps. I've often seen a few locks, rogues and/or hunters at the bottom.
---
The added effort it takes to make yourself as useful as possible playing ret is indicative of the type of player behind the character. Competent and committed players will always get by.
---
It's just one of those class specs you don't wanna stack. One in raid is plenty.
---
WoW raptors have a fairly high intelligence for a beast don't they? Even on their model, you can see they're wearing necklaces, and what looks like bandages with feathers stuffed into then, most likely of their own making.
---
GODLY
---
idc about minmaxing in a 15yo game. most of ppl had no idea about weapon skills those days. i mean if smb really needs to roll a human cuz u care about ur dps, smth must be wrong there. so ye, i m gonna roll ne too. just cuz i love NEs and since i started to play NE rogue on NA OBT 2004, im sure im gonna enjoy that nostalgia feeling more, than +xyz dps in the dps meter late game
---
So late.
---
A nightmare would be all your priests turning purple. 1 is ok.
---
I wish Eve had slightly more engaging gameplay, the community is something I really enjoyed.
---
Mostly the size, the buttons on the side are also movable depending on how you'd like your thumb positioned, and just the overall quality.
---
Yeah, as much as i love NE they're not a good race in vanilla, you might not care at first but in the long run its something you might regret. There is Tmorphs you can use to look at your char as a NE being human and you're not losing nothing. Sword skill is really important tho
---
In my experience, the fastest 5 man comps include niche builds. AOE dungeon runs.... Feels like wotlk in vanilla.
---
-Prot pally AOE tanking
---
-balance druid for hurricane, thorns on tank, and moonkin aua
---
This is why horde players spend so much time in contested 'alliance zones' ganking
---
Also  female orcs are hot just saying no hate pls
---
Man I love trash pandas.
---
That kind of thing does happen here though too. I‚Äôve made the same kind of comment in different threads, and they‚Äôve ranged from -5 to +50. I think it‚Äôs just the way up/downvotes tend to pile on. 
---
But I do think this sub is much better than r/wow but I‚Äôm obviously biased.
---
As long as you don't play male Nelf there is no problem here
---
I shared you 2 builds for dagger spec that are the best ones as my guessing and experience, you should check them. Evasion-sprint reduces dps as you're not using those talents in the ones which boost your damage. This dont happen as a sword specc because you give not a single point in subtlety.
---
Nice to see a fellow Vanilla-era Malygos-er!
---
For PvE it doesn't make much difference especially if you decide you're going dagger. The agility difference is like 5 for nelfs so yeah it's better but claiming it's significant is pretty spurious.  
---
  
---
For PvP though there's just no arguing nelf isn't bad.   
---
* 1% dodge is terrible, it probably would affect less than 1 in 500 fights significantly. Yes it's a talent, a really bad low level talent absolutely no one takes, so it's clearly not worth 1 talent point.  
---
* 1 Rank of MoD is also at best a poor low level talent. People do take it but only because the other choice (opportunity) does literally nothing for a hemo rogue. If you could go to 6/6 MoD no one would do that because there's better talents further down to get.  
---
   
---
Perception isn't great but it's clearly a lot more useful than those two. Stoneform and Escape Artist are very strong actives that significantly affect multiple matchups. If you were nelf vs nelf rogue equal skill/gear you would win 50% of matches. Dwarf vs Nelf would be 100% win rate, or at least 95%. Gnome rogue is far stronger vs druid and mage than any other rogue. Obviously group pvp is different to duelling but it gives you a good idea of power level. Compare how 1% dodge improves your duels...
---
DPS would probably appeal to the most people. Maybe a Fury gearing guide which also covers where to gather a basic tanking set
---
That‚Äôs great to hear. Even walking is a great, easy way to stay healthy.
---
I agree and really want to be one of those ppl that try to show the meta isnt as set in stone as people portray it to be. My post is a bit of an exaggeration. Its more so what the meta pushers antagonize you with, especially when joining guilds/raids/grps I believe you should be given opportunities to prove other things work, as long as youre willing to put in the effort.
---
Imagine being one of the poor fools on a PvE server. Gnomes questing right beside you at Nesingwary's. *I cant even...*
---
I wouldn't know.
---
Not that much. The best weapons will be crosbows
---
Horde dont live in mud huts you fucking racist.
---
Please: agi, stealth **and** dodge :P
---
You have failed to convince me how these three mini-perks are far inferior to the other races'.
---
Also, I reckon druids get away with being NE xD
---
Saying NE is the worst race for rogue is just rehashing the conventional wisdom that I am trying to dismantle.
---
Nightfall gave us Heroes, Pac Man wurms, Koss, and Palawa Joko (praise Joko), but Factions somehow ended up being my favorite.
---
Factions had the WORST voice acting, most bullshit mobs, and hardest to learn new classes, but damn did it have the greatest environments in an MMO, let alone many video games among many genres.
---
They can easily top the meters...on a fight that lasts 1 minute.
---
After that they have SERIOUS mana problems.
---
it still doesnt, you need to glyph it to affect your mount iirc
---
can you spare me some money for a dragon hunter crossbow? I am tired of farming vorkath without it :/
---
Relics from an ancient time.
---
was this for most bosses or just kel thuzad
---
Thanks! :)
---
Sounds like I have a new job ;)
---
"I raid on a schedule to be stronger... For next weeks raid."  
---
"I prefer to fight the computer controlled enemies."  
---
Okay little brother, just keep your sticky juice fingers off my mouse.
---
Imagine playing Frost instead of Elemental big yikes
---
The general buzz around here is much more positive, but the enormous mass of pointless threads are really annoying.  
---
GUIZ PALLY VS PRIEST  
---
GUIZ CONVINCE ME NOT TO PLAY ORC  
---
GUIZ HOW QUICK CAN U HIT LEVEL 10? 300 MINUTES OR 280???   
---
DAE WANT A PHYSICAL COLLECTOR'S EDITION??!  
---
Holy fuck put some effort into your posts instead of clogging the sub with junk.
---
This is amazing! I struggle to pick names so this is invaluable to me. The prefix feature is so helpful. Thank you :)
---
But one. Hate yourself for a couple weeks learning. And then be happy af that you did. 
---
I stopped playing mmos a few years back and got rid of my razer naga. 
---
I'm gunna buy a new mmo mouse specifically for classic wow. It's seriously worth
---
Horde no shoes lmao.
---
I have leveled every class to 30 on a certain private server and Druid until 41. I can say that they are miles slower then any class thus far to 10. Post 10 they get exponentially better with bear form and post 20 they level on par with locks or hunters imo. 
---
Before bear form all u can do is melee moon fire and I forget the name of the nature spell u spam early. It‚Äôs slow your mana pool is very small and you do so little damage. 
---
It gets better once bear and cat are involved. 
---
I will say it was above and beyond the most fun I had leveling. My only gripe is you can‚Äôt go from bear to cat. You must enter your caster form every time to switch into another form. It‚Äôs a minor inconvenience. 
---
If you play Druid you will have a great time. And tanking with one is ez mode if you throw your regrow the and rejuv pre pull and spam swipe it‚Äôs amazing. Lol I‚Äôm biased tho. I will be playing Druid.
---
The difference being we kill dwarves because we like them.
---
We kill the rest of the Alliance because they're pests.
---
I already know I‚Äôm going warrior.
---
Gonna be a bitch to level, but everyone wants a Warrior!
---
The class quest rewards at lvl 50 are quite amazing though. I‚Äôm going to suck it up, watch a 10 minute you tube video prior and do it like a boss.
---
Totally agreed. ;)
---
I thought about rolling my orc as female, but I think character model size matters as it pertains to low and mid tier tanking. :/
---
I hated leveling my warr on retail version lol
---
Herbalism/Alchemy and fishing
---
I don't actually hate gnomes that much. I mean, I'm still gonna' murder everyone I see with extreme prejudice, but I don't actually hate 'em.
---
How can you hate something that's so fun to punt?
---
Elves, now...
---
Again, Evasion-Sprint is not taken at the expense of damage talents, it is taken as 'dump points'. 
---
The one thing I don't like in your trees is the points in Imp Evis and Agression; if you're backstabbing and keeping SnD up, you rarely have the energy for Evis.
---
And let's not bring swords into this, swords are for filthy humans.
---
It's completely fine to play Night Elf, they're just not the very strongest Rogue race. And that's fine.
---
I really need a Classic release date to plan my summer vacation. I'm supposed to visit family this summer and I'm already getting phone calls about it. Didn't Vanilla launched 3 days after the beta? With the private alpha instead of a public beta they should know by now when the launch date is right? 
---
What is going on Blizzard?
---
It depends on whether or not your comment fits the narrative of that particular thread.
---
This goes without saying :p
---
there's a classic meme
---
Always nice to meet another who understands elves are the real enemy.
---
I mean, I'm still gonna' murder every gnome I see with extreme prejudice, but it won't be a hate murder.
---
How can one possibly hate something that's so much fun to punt?
---
The Alliance allied mobs in Barrens flag you. (Dwarves at digsite, Nelf Outrunners) so.. GOTCHA THERE
---
Third love is like shrek, the first two were cute and funny, but the third one sucked dick.
---
If "I'd much rather..." is involved you honestly shouldnt be worried about your class demand.
---
Will try to explain myself better. As a dagger user you need Opportunity talent in the Subtletly tree, that means 5 points that you cannot use on Imp evasion-Imp Sprint. So its not taken as "dump points" It just improve your damage because you'll be spamming less backstab than a sword user "Sinister strikes". 
---
Agression is an important talent because you will be using Eviscerate when the boss is at 10% or so as a real "Finishing move" and also you will not be able to use Backstab all the time so you will be using sinister strike while you get in the back. In fights like Razorgore in BWL has a first phase of adds, those die fast and you will not be able to put yourself in the back (orc ones i mean) So you will be using sinister. 
---
Also sinister is good in situations where you need 1 Cp for 5CPs then SnD in case you losing the one you have currently active, so you never run out of SnD. Altho as a daggers you will prefer to not have SnD 100% times up and use some eviscerate
---
We don't know that this won't be the case
---
I think you're preaching to the choir here. But yes, I do.
---
Reading this makes me sad :(  
---
Imagine telling the girl you want to impress "I prefer to fight the computer controlled monsters."
---
I mean, I'm gonna' murder every gnome I see, but it won't be a hate murder.
---
How can you possibly hate something that's so much fun to punt?
---
No, see, the real list is like this:
---
We kill dwarves because we like them.
---
We kill gnomes because they're fun to punt.
---
We kill humans because... eh, why not?
---
We kill elves because **HATRED.**
---
Thanks for patting my back, but the whole point of my post isn't to say that they're not the best and that's okay, I'm actually trying to argue that NE is on par with the other races for rogue. Unless you believe swords are the end-all be-all beats-all, which is up for debate.
---
I think toxic people are those who try and make a divide here one doesn‚Äôt exist.
---
Hey look a circle jerk...almost exactly what the other sub does
---
Con Air...hell yeah brother ü§ü
---
Mages are horrific levelers unless you can secure a reliable aoe grind spot, and good luck doing that within months of launch. You'll spend 90% of your time oom and drinking water
---
BfA is just another game. It has nothing to do with Classic. I dont even think BfA is an mmorpg anymore. Its more like a mobile game on pc.
---
Yeah, married. But that's probably because I realized leading with your choice of server in world of warcraft isn't the best move for impressing anyone. 
---
Also, I was like 10 when I started playing and my brother picked the server, and ganking noobs leveling just didn't seem like a good enough reason to throw away a bunch of friends and characters.
---
For PvE night elf is better because of the higher base agility.
---
I remember running SFK without a healer that could dispell that one debuff that spawned the banshees, got old real fast
---
Tank too.  
---
DO IT.  
---
I also need warlock and mage. Hunter and rogue wouldn't be bad either. Actually I could use druid and paladin as well.  
---
Shamans can go die in a fire.
---
If you want to play a pure support healer that enables his teammates to the fullest, literally the best support in the game, but does basically nothing offensive, Holy Paladin is your jam bro.
---
Your analysis is based on census data from a small particular demographic 8+ months before the game is released. It's very optimistic to think it will be representative of class distribution 4 months into Classic when it will be actually relevant.
---
Pretty much they will always wear non plate :p. Cloth helm from bwl is bis forever. And it‚Äôs so uggggllllyyyyy
---
Which is why I added the citation marks. A decent amount of the stuff posted in here that people call memes are just mildly funnily photoshopped pictures, not actual memes. And "making memes" like that requires some degree of creativity at least.
---
Gotta do both if possible please!
---
It's simple, daggers are trash tier compared to swords in PvE, no min/max guild will take a dagger rogue over a sword rogue, now if you don't care about minmaxing you can always go NE rogue on a casual guild.
---
For PvP, all the other 3 races have better racials.
---
Do I want to ask in what situation the second one is said in?
---
&gt; The extra health is nearly irrelevant because most of your health is coming from +stam gear.
---
Doesn't Tauren racial add +5% of total health?
---
It's tauren and not close
---
I was a NE rogue from vanilla to cata when I quit and if I rolled alliance again I would choose that race as a rogue all over again..
---
Here are the older guys, that enjoy wow for the memories, struggles overcoming them and the fun talking about classic. 
---
vs 
---
these kids that complains all day because their class is too bad or aren‚Äôt good enough to complete stuff and wants a nerf on it. 
---
But I can understand why in a way. what else can you do when there‚Äôs no more content and your game is boring, id complain too ;) /poke /r/wow
---
This is deep
---
Isn't r/WoW just a retail sub?  
---
Never been there.
---
Yes! I still fondly remember SFK because it's one of the few places where a druid healer shines due to being able to decurse.
---
Totally fine. Some daggers ARE going to drop. Might as well give it to the rogue that makes the most use of them instead of throwing yourself on a sword drop. Great during progression!
---
Also you have higher damage than dwarf and gnome in pve, so thats a plus in itself too. Basically the second best pve choice, and the second worst pvp one(Human worse, bc who the fuck uses perception in bg at the time it matters anyways unless they know theres a rogue). Im personally fine with that.
---
I would keep imp. gouge for casual pvp if you dont care for respec everytime, unlike the other poster said.
---
As long as you aren't forced by a minmaxer guild, NE is totally fine. I played nelf rogue through vanilla, cleared all of naxx, didn't get carried. At that point minmaxing your race doesn't really matter unless you want to speedrun some world record times of raids. Also you forgot to mention that NE do flips when jumping, that alone is enough of a reason to choose one.
---
Not to mention respawns/patrols could kill even the best groups.
---
Totally agreed. Great point.
---
I'm just picturing brady talking about raiding as a moonkin during the offseason during an interview, lol.
---
For druids you need to be traveling for longer than 30 seconds to make the cast time of your mount worth it
---
&gt; These things were pretty much all removed in TBC.
---
Because Arena. All the fun, quirky item effects and flavorful RPG stuff got in the way of esport peen waving, so they had to go.
---
I would love to see the Classic team eventually take inspiration from/straight up rip off the class/spec design side of things from TBC, but the Arena utterly sucking all the fun out of PvP is one of the primary reasons I'm *strongly* opposed to the game naturally progressing into TBC servers as so many seem to hope for.
---
Crap, ya got me. Now I've got to start a new life in New Mexico.
---
If I were to play the devil's advocate against myself, this response is pretty much exactly what I would say. You're spot on. 
---
However, I personally am quite fond of MoD, and I've seen many others who agree, and who take this talent even if they are dagger rogues and have alternatives. Not getting detected is nothing to be sniffed at, especially in the mirror matchup. It's also a nice perk for solo PvE.
---
Am I gimping myself by not having Escape Artist? Well, I do have Improved Sprint and Preparation, so it's not like I can't break immobilization once in a while.
---
And yes, the agility bonus is a minor thing, I never did try to sell it very highly.
---
Thanks, friend-a-rino.
---
Yea you don't want to play 2hnded fury unless you're horde.   Human warriors with swords is the way to go if you want to be optimal sweat boi due to the expertise racial
---
Can't believe you're being downvoted. People can't stand hearing experience that goes against their established narrative
---
&gt; My biggest problem with that sub was that people would spam report a post that they didn‚Äôt like to get it auto removed by auto-mod. Then if you tell the mods about it, they‚Äôd just ignore you.
---
I don't actually recall a time that this has ever happened.
---
&gt;less toxic community   
---
People are nice on /r/wow     
---
Many times I have asked a question and people helped out. My posts never got deleted. The discord also has incredibly friendly people.  
---
But if it makes you feel better, you can think you guys are better here.
---
I'm actually having a blast levelling my to-be main and familiarizing myself with the quests, figuring out best paths, etc. 
---
If anything it's hyping me up even more.
---
*5 pallies for the necessary blessings. Salvation, Wisdom, Might, Sanctuary, Light.
---
The best times I've had for wPvP were in vanilla, and Halaa and QD in TBC.
---
I also had some fun PvPing on that no-fly daily island in MoP, and leveling in WoD.
---
But by far my best wPvP memories come from vanilla, especially pre-1.5 because there was more of it.
---
/r/wow has always been an awful sub imo
---
Yes! Back in Vanilla when my paladin hit her 40‚Äôs back in early 2005, I would patrol that rode in Darkshire in between questing and help kill Stitches. Then I would hand extra bags/pots and buff people before moving on. Can‚Äôt wait to do that again üòäüòäüòä
---
lol me too. Even after the mount.
---
Anyone picking MoD and Opportunity isn't a very experienced rogue. The only purpose of Taking MoD is in hemo builds were Opportunity gains no value. On top of that Opportunity really isn't super amazing it only increases the base damage on the spells, so taking 4/5 lethality and 5/5 Opportunity is just less damage givin Ambush and Backstab crits are so common. 
---
Outside of that I disagree with almost every point you made besides your PvE build doesn't look that bad. Theres a couple things around with the "I'll just be daggers all the time" stance that severely limits you, an easy example is preraid it's correct for you to just farm Dal'rens and use them even tho you're a night elf. As a gnome or a dwarf people are more open to your damage being limited due to the massive advantage in PvP you get and the small possibilities for use in PvE, similar to WotF theres times were PvP racials are used in raids like dwarf to remove huhuran poison or gnome to remove the attack speed slow from a thunderclap as along as it also slows your movement speed like when fighting Kazzak.
---
It looks like you have your heart set on Night elf anyway tho, so I hope you have fun with the jump flips but be prepared for haters.
---
Pull 1 thing at a time. Gouge -&gt; backstab is a better strat than sin strike spam at lvl 12. If you do pull 2 things, don't forget to use evasion. If evasion is off CD, and you pull two things, consider escaping with sprint (which you get at lv14 I think).
---
Eventually you get vanish as well. You won't die nearly as much then unless you forget to use an ability.
---
I remember sustaining 500k DPS in Nighthold during legion. Things were getting pretty wild around that time.
---
Awesome mate great job. 
---
Ya people it‚Äôs a snap shot with some real life aspects such as Classic releasing soon and people not wanting to put raid effort in any more. However great insight !!
---
&gt;Saying NE is the worst race for rogue is just rehashing the conventional wisdom that I am trying to dismantle.
---
Your haven't presented enough evidence to do so. It's fine if you don't want to min/max. Just don't say you are, that's it. Play what race you want to play.
---
Has anyone ever told you you use a lot of slashes
---
I've actually found that many people on this sub are asshole elitists. Also mention any change to the game even if it's very very small they want your head on a pike.
---
Hah I loved jumping off then jumping back on it when it came back. It was like hobo train hopping.
---
Be sure to enjoy being a living god at WSG in the 29 and 39 brackets too! I highly reccomend popping in there a couple times at those levels just to get a few flag caps.
---
Pulled more than 1 mobs You better run, boy.
---
If daggers (combat) are trash tier like you say, and can't compete with swords in PvE, then you would be correct and my case would fall appart. However, in my research I've seen that this is not the case.
---
As for PvP, I'm really quite fond of the improved stealth. Maybe that's just me overvaluing it, or maybe it's not as useless as people say and it's down to preference.
---
E-peen: when worrying about the size of your real penis simply isn't enough.
---
What kind of mods?
---
Just stick with it! Solo rogue leveling is no joke.
---
True. The survey is a bit outdated. The good part is that the survey is actually not small, 10670 entrance. The subscription here is 70k. 
---
Let us say there are 1M people would like to play classic wow, which is actually a very ambitious number. With 95% confident level and 2% merge error , 2400 samples are  enough to show the trend. Just like president polls study.  We have five times more sample size. 
---
There are some recent surveys, but the data are too small (200-600 entrance) to represent the trend.  So I did not use them.  Just hope people's mind does change that quick though.
---
One of the things I‚Äôm hesitant about with Classic is the information abundance available. 
---
Sure we had wowhead and such in the past, but the game was vastly mysterious, and it was a new frontier of multiplayer gaming. That wonder is gone, there are hardcore guides down to the copper of how to level, what to buy, what to farm, etc etc. 
---
I didn‚Äôt expect it to completely recapture the entire original feeling, but I think I‚Äôll hop in, realize everyone and I see the machine for the parts, and not the overall package and end up leaving. 
---
Hell look at AV, were getting a shitty version of it, and a lot of people want that so they can spam farm the epics from rep, and never touch it again as opposed to enjoying the way it used to really be. 
---
Can‚Äôt ever go back home I guess.
---
Don‚Äôt run gnomeregan.  It never goes smoothly. I‚Äôve never been happy I went there.
---
I love these memes
---
lol me neither. The GM said all my characters were deleted, they restored completely naked so the just rolled it back.
---
Yes it is. I think it's pretty telling that the graph levels off immediately after the steep climb during TBC, especially given how many people joined during wrath. The high point only comes in the pre-expansion boost before Cata.
---
Oh I absolutely will be! At first I dreaded the fact that I‚Äôm WSG I would only be a flag carrier but thinking back I was like ‚Äúhmm... this is what I tried to do as a rogue and got yelled at for not letting the Druid do it‚Äù I love the idea of being a unkillable machine even if I never top the damage meters I‚Äôll kite actual players around who can‚Äôt stop me.. so much fun!! I can‚Äôt wait for it!
---
Alright gotcha, thanks for the constructive imput.
---
DPS warriors are arguably the best DPS in vanilla.  Nothing niche about them... it‚Äôll be the most played class most likely.
---
Furlbog farming
---
this sub is so fucking bad
---
As someone who mostly lurks on both subreddits I find both subreddits to be fairly similar, mainly casual memey and artsy posts in both front pages.
---
I will say that r/classicwow tends to care a lot more about the retail version of the game than vice versa.
---
Yea. You may honestly not like vanilla. It‚Äôs a very ‚Äúslow burn‚Äù with some awesome moments like getting a great piece of blue gear finally.
---
and meanwhile everyone was celebrating DM getting delayed for the same reasons even though the blue pvp gear is even better than DM gear. do people even care about the game?
---
The top competitor for first to 60 last time on won't say the name of that server was a mage for levels ~30-50. AoE grinding is dull and they do need lack of interference to be optimal but they're clearly still top tier overall.
---
Also being oom after a couple fights vs taking forever to finish a fight is a tradeoff.
---
That's a recent change. For most of the game's history shadow form affected both you and your mount, but due to popular demand it was changed and a glyph was added for those that preferred a shadowy mount.
---
Rogues are super gear dependent and aren‚Äôt strong levelers compared to other classes.  Try to get blue weapons ASAP and it gets better.
---
True and a big reason why I'm rolling mage, always a clutch asset to any group.
---
It's not about ganking noobs, that sentiment is irritatingly typical. But I get you on the other stuff.
---
Because killing horde isn't dishonorable. They started it, so killing them is always justified.
---
I know, I have a lot of bad habits in my writing. I can't show my mrs anything I write anymore because it drives her crazy.
---
Instead of picking what to play, chose what not to play:
---
- Take a list of classes you want.
---
- Chose one, then tell yourself what will you miss from other choices ("I want to play warlock, but I'll miss healing and buffing")
---
- Repeat for other choices 
---
- Sum up what you will miss out on and choose what you're okay sacrificing the most ("I guess I don't have to have dots, but I absolutely must have self heal") 
---
- Pick two classes you feel worst about skipping
---
Then level them interchangeably to make use of rested xp. You -must- choose. Stop regretting not picking one class, just enjoy the one you do.
---
There are absolutely diminishing returns on all cc in classic. You are wrong.
---
Leveling a druid is one of my favorite classes to level because of how much survivability and utility they have. Even end game is still pretty fun imo unless you're in a guild that only does raiding and nothing else. There's so much content outside of the raid like world pvp or regular dungeon farming that gives you a lot of variation. At high levels I find it very difficult to get bored of the class compared to other pure classes.
---
I played a 19 hunter on live, rolled an orc for the animations but came to regret it soon after.  War stomp is an absolute must to beat twink healers and the only way to create distance from melee twinks while slowed. Furthermore max hp from Tauren is pretty impact full since you're such  high hp. Finally, remember that intellect ends up being pretty important, it's one of those things you wanna figure out before you buy your forest leather bracers
---
this subreddit is going to change tones once classic releases
---
I think too many people are making posts without thinking or knowing what they[re talking about in general
---
Yeah, it was like blizz plateau'd with Wrath but everyone was so hype for the next expansion only to have it not pan out with Cata, then everything was downhill after that. Sure there were big burst for each expansion but the subs dropped off so fast after the release that wow would never be the same after that. That was their best moment with Wrath and it was only downhill from there, and maybe most of that can be contributed to just burn-out of the series honestly, but whatever the case, it was a fact the WoW sub base only declined from that point on.
---
A part of me is so excited for classic that I hope that split the time line and go a different direction afterwords. like instead of BC we get a 40 man version where they try to stay more hardcore. Now alot of the balancing should be brought in from BC since it was so good, but I want to see them branch off into a more hardcore version since the mass appeal thing has already been down, maybe the overall audience will be less players, it would be great if they tried a whole different directions overall.
---
It comes down to shadowmeld Vs stoneform really. Both are nice for PvP.
---
If that isn't enough, then go with the looks. For me it's female nelf or male dwarf, I wouldn't play the other 2 options any way.
---
Not all the time, I agree. But it's nice to have a character set aside specifically to play with friends.
---
Except that if you ninja cap while a flag has 2 defenders it's likely that as soon as your CC drops they will just re-spin the node while you watch on, unable to do anything about it and your have effectively done nothing.
---
wrath
---
You need like 6 shamans in a raid guild, they're always welcome in 5/10/20 mans and all 3 specs are pvp viable. Who cares if they are popular, you're gonna have a great time if you roll one.
---
I meant outside starter zones.
---
Then roll Druid, stats don't matter. Just gotta look awesome.
---
Druid for sure.
---
You make some good points. Thanks, and I will enjoy my jump flips!
---
And I meant what I said.  Blizz server architecture can't handle large groups of people all in the same area without crashing.  This is quite evident on retail with raids on cities crashing servers.  I am just being realistic about sharding in classic.  It will be in all zones always.

Top competitor, in a very specific level bracket (weird lol?) vs average Joe Warcraft is a big difference
---
now see ya done gone and angered the moster even more! he wanted tree fitty not no lousy dollar
---
Honestly, I don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs a narrative thing. This sub is better than many about not shutting out other opinions. I‚Äôve had times where you get that 0, -1, -2 and it builds from there, but most times I can give a contrary opinion to the thread and not be destroyed.
---
But the ones that probably get bombed the most are the ‚ÄúClassic Plus Expansion‚Äù threads. There‚Äôs just too many, and unlike potential BC/Wrath discussion, there‚Äôs just too much random shit and half baked ideas thrown into horizontal progression threads.
---
The whole point of having silver and copper is to avoid this. There is literally no point in having silver and copper in the game right now. People talk about money in terms of gold.

yes elendril/kibler played til roughly black temple

should try to find his drunk rendition of lion king ;)
---
TIL, thanks !
---
It really sucks up mana. You have to drink after a single stam buff. Somtimes in PvP I'll use Inner Focus to cast it on myself if I'm lazy
---
thats what the popular opinion seems to be. would people care about me healing 5 mans if i have no normal rez?
---
Doesn't he shout, "Burn in righteous fire!" ?
---
Pretty much decided on warlock. Don‚Äôt mind being a 1 button raider. Looking to focus on PVP outside of raids, especially once geared. Which race should I choose between UD and Orc?
---
I think the difference is that classic is mostly new to you. 
---
I'll probably do some research to help "get back what I've lost". I don't feel that my characters were finished when classic ended, so I want to get back to that point and then progress further.
---
What I've always done is wait until I'm high enough level to do Cath and then just get a group together to bang them all out for the quests so we have the key no matter what, and most Classic groups early on will probably have to go in order to get the keys anyway as well.
---
Oh now that is a great perk when it comes to that. When I played vanilla I was Alliance and had a twink Pally. The ability to stun a heal is so valuable.
---
Don't worry too much about base agi, it's just a tiny difference. If you want the extra stealth levels that's kinda understandable, but MOD is usually enough, and there are better anti-stealth racials. Nelfs are kinda in contention for worst rogue, but honestly it doesn't make that much of a difference in the end. If what you want to be is the sneakiest you can, then you be a nelf I suppose.

Seek help you poor bastard.

How so? Was he supposed to reply with a four page essay on each spec? He summed it up about as quick and simple as possible.

Where is the best place to read a condensed version of this lore around those time periods? I‚Äôm interested in learning more.

Hi! Planning on rolling a holy paladin for PVE/PVP. Played originally vanilla to WotLK. Server: Durotan. Tried BFA when it came out and wasn't a fan. Super hyped for vanilla and looking for a guild.
---
It's the natural growth of a subreddit. The people that have been here for a long time see this stuff. The problem is that as release gets closer, more and more people will continue to find out about this sub, and they will be the brand new people who have no idea the same stuff has been asked 5 million times before. It's going to get worse until the game comes out. Then it's going to get WAY WORSE. This is where the mods will have to come into play. Shit's gonna get weird.
---
Yah, mb. I heard Tank warriors were the only thing that was valuable in most of Wow's history so I got that wrong. I said O only really played the game during Legion so idk what was actually true or not.
---
Not from my experience.
---
The fuck is this? You're fired Alexa.
---
I have a question I've always wondered. So I assume you had a personal account that you would play when you're not working. Did your in-game friends and guild know that you were a GM or did you have to keep it a secret to avoid having people bother you on your personal account?
---
All we had to do was pick the damn gloom weed, CJ!
---
Not really a bait and switch...
---
very well written
---
Gotta compare Alliance to Alliance, and Horde to Horde. Warriors probably miss WF more anyway. Daggers has a ton of +skill equipment. Easily gotten 5 man off hand dagger, and belt. We have 1.12 AV, so the lobo grind will be a cake walk,  should be &lt;1 week. Combat dagger builds can outperform sword builds in MC if you bring some weapon skill gear, pvp is a little awkward, but I still had fun with it.
---
or maces, humans get + to mace AND sword skill
---
Ya. It‚Äôs way too mana intensive. That‚Äôs why for the purpose of the op I think pally would be better for them.
---
If you pull several mobs at once, improved soul drain wins big time, like you'll be back to near full mana after the fight.
---
Something like this for hunter available?
---
Don't use thrash blade in ~~raid~~ at 60. Just don't. Felstriker would be great, but it's not exactly easy to obtain, you'll having something better before you get it probably, also you don't need it to be daggers, you can do just fine without.
---
I dunno, warriors and priests love meld also.
---
FTH!
---
that never happened

Differ I got deployed to Iraq in December of 2004. I got ONE freaking month of wow then I was gone for seven months. Talk about withdrawal!

It's a curse, so only mages can decurse it
---
If you just mean 1v1, shamans are much more dangerous to a druid with purge and interrupts and burst damage. Paladins on the other hand you can't kill if specced/geared for pvp, but at least you can run away from them so you just ignore each other basically. Paladins are pretty annoying on the other team though because they will spam cleanse and BoF on all your CC and damage targets so that's pretty sad.
---
People playing the demo reported that it used the modern macro system
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9tm788/modern_macros_work_on_classic/
---
Well it's just that Combat Swords is the top performing DPS spec. NE is the best dagger Rogue in PvE but that's the extent to what they have going for them. Gnome and Dwarf both have better PvP racials while Human has the better PvE racial. If you're set on playing dagger PvE then definitely go NE because they're the best at that niche.
---
great video, keep up the good work. :)
---
You'll run one shadow priest anyway for shadow weaving. The warlocks will love you for it. Without a spriest you might as well not run any warlocks at all.
---
Oh yeah I forgot about that
---
I think its one the best classes to level with cuz you can heal, tank, flee. Etc
---
Lemon Party and Goat.se are the two originals.
---
What‚Äôs sgs
---
Got some numbers for that? My  experience indicates otherwise, but I want to know why you think that.
---
I play RS casually and as a non-member, I don‚Äôt even know what you just said
---
For the most part I didn't mention it to people when I was playing on my own.  I was a pretty hardcore player and was running a guild for awhile.  Several of the officers were irl friends, so they all knew as did one of the officers who came to WoW with us from a previous game.  The only one I had mentioned it to in my guild was this really good hunter in my guild who ended up living down the street.  I ended up helping him get a job as a GM as well, but I didn't tell him until after I had met up with him.  If it did leak, no one ever asked me about it.
---
Aside from that I kept it to myself as I didn't want people asking me GM stuff that I probably couldn't answer for them anyways, nor did I want people to think that the reason my character had the progress it had was for any other reason than I played for it like everyone else.
---
My hunch says no.. but since it's likely going to be bundled into the same subscription as retail, you'd need retail tokens to buy game time.
---
I‚Äôm not too sure but remember seeing a mod mentioning it in a post. 
---
I‚Äôll try to find that post.
---
I think it is pretty accepted that protection warrior is the hardest spec to get a raid slot as.

Why can't Oceanic players occupy the NA thread and Euro have their own thread.
---
This makes more sense as Euro consists of more variation in language/timezone disparity?
---
Buying a universal BFA/Classic sub through tokens bought from BFA doesn't bother me. Selling them on a Classic AH does though.
---
I think it's unlikely because
---
1) It would directly undermine progression in WoW classic, as gold is far more important than in retail for epic mounts/gear etc 
---
2) Introducing a foreign item into the game would undermine the 'Classic means Classic' philosophy summarised by 
---
"In restoring World of Warcraft Classic, our guiding principle has been to provide an authentic experience. Things might run a bit smoother and the hardware is better, but the game should still look and feel like you‚Äôre playing World of Warcraft from 2006."
---
Druid is considered 2nd fastest leveler after hunter.
---
They're both terrible to fight.  
---
Paladins are down right impossible.  They cleanse off moonfire, insect swarm, roots, etc. but you get to keep your HoTs.  You can't melee fight them in bear because they do a lot of armor ignoring magic damage.  If they're reckoning you're not going to win because Druids basically do a bunch of low damage crits and you lose that trade hard.  They'll always run you out of mana and eventually win if you don't run away.
---
Shaman is sorta the opposite.  You get to use your moonfire and insect swarm but now you can't use your HoTs.  They're just as easy to kite, shift out of frost shock and you're gone.  The worry is their burst damage but if you can heal through it then you'll probably win because they have serious mana problems.  Just keep yourself above half HP and you'll be fine most of the time.
---
You‚Äôre the prot Pally that picks up sanctuary and demands they use it instead of Kings in 5 mans, aren‚Äôt you?

---
Vanilla was great in its leveling wPvP was a strong addition to the rest of the game. I thoroughly enjoyed this game up and until the end of wotlk.
---
I just want the release to align with my time off and I think a lot of people also want a release so they can know when to take off from work.
---
Lucky you actually. my 10 year old account which i haven't logged in for 4 years just got a ban indefinitely last year. I submitted a ticket, it was rejected after "investigation". I appealed, and they don't bother replying anymore. RIP account. I was always going to start afresh anyway but still good bye memories.
---
500 fucking days? I haven‚Äôt spent 500 days doing anything lol
---
That's exactly what I thought!
---
That's actually a hige coincidence that you were playing with someone from down the street. Is there a reason that happened or was it just pure luck? Also how did you find out he lived so close?
---
Not true at all. You can continue to sap to interrupt both defenders long enough to cap it.
---
Man, I loved these guys!
---
This video was good. Like really, really good. This sub's been filled with pre-raid BiS lists for quite a while, so it's nice to see a guide for gear that is actually easy and quick to obtain. 
---
TL;DR: run BRD and Strat UD, craft tailoring gear and check AH for stuff, especially +healing greens. Great! Anyone can do that.
---
Which is pointless if you don't plan on raiding.
---
My bad, but I agree with you. I‚Äôll delete this post.
---
A Shadow Priests DPS can be measured in Gold Per Minute...
---
One can stealth the other can't
---
31/0/20 gives you shadow weaving and you get pi as well.  If you're worried about your healing priests' output, it can be worth it to use your spriest to get an extra pi without sacrificing the deep +healing talents in the holy tree.
---
I along with the majority of the community don‚Äôt want them and will be very surprised if they‚Äôre put into Classic. 
---
Sadly however, if they‚Äôre in and being honest, as a Full time working Dad gamer I‚Äôd be buying a few.
---
Good job mate üëç
---
I'm going to be leveling a Horde Rogue and Priest concurrently. I really want an Unead Rogue, but I don't really want a Troll priest. Are Troll priests as lame as I remember them?

&gt; Hey look a circle jerk...almost exactly what ~~the other sub~~ this entire goddamn website does

ftfy
---
TBC is GOAT
---
Check soyoen's spreadsheet for rogues on Nostalrius if you want the numbers, but if you played rogue enough @raids you'd know how bad dagger is compared to swords.
---
I‚Äôve seen this asked quite a few times.  Now I‚Äôm not going to freak out about it but just ask you....honestly why should you bring this up? Did you play classic? Did they have tokens then? When asked is vanilla your favorite flavor do you say yes? I‚Äôll answer that for you...you say no. Classic does not need wow tokens at all. The justifications you give do not give a classic experience. If it wasn‚Äôt in classic leave it out. Done.
---
Yeah you‚Äôre right, I guess I was being closed minded. I experienced more negativity for simplest of things whenever Im on r/wow.,
---
I deleted this post cuz i dont want to spark a circlejerk or sub favouritism. Its better if we just focus on the game and our community rather than the retail WoW community and not do what i did and make this post lol

elendril is brian kibler who was a lead dev for the wow tcg at upperdeck, multiple cards are named after lost anarchy characters

Sounds excellent!  I've played the crap out of the first one and excited to give it a try :)
---
I'm agreeing with you. The reason I'm posting this is that I want to know if there is official confirmation so that I can put my fears to rest.
---
It's worth doing once for the experience! Exactly once.
---
I find it quite the opposite.  With rogues having no stun removal at all the orc bonus is huge whereas priests have 1 fear every 30 seconds and the pvp trinket is good enough to take them out.  Later on when we get shadow reflectors it makes orc even better.
---
You tank to get your gear. Ive been full fury/impale for all of my time on an unnamed private server and I've tanked all the way up to MC in that build. You really don't need deep prot to tank unless you are doing 40 man's.... Where you want to be dps anyway. Only hindrance is that you are even more reliant on tank gear in 20 man's as you don't have mitigation talents, however you will be doing balls to the wall threat so the healers/dps can go nuts. 
---
Being the boss hoss tank also means you get to make and run groups yourself. You will never need a tank. You also to not invite people who would roll on your gear, even reserve gear for yourself if you want. Bonus: you have dips on tank pieces. Double dipping YEET. 
---
Exercise tank privilege and run the show, the world is your oister.
---
How do each of the healer specs go when it comes to farming and doing solo content at 60? Or is it not that big of a deal? I imagine priest/Druid healers would have it much easier. I love healing in dungeons and instances but the idea of not having a respec for solo/farming content worries me a bit. Like grinding reputation, or farming specific drops or recipes when not doing dungeons/instances.
---
This combined with the fact that nowadays I won‚Äôt have that much time for raiding etc due to work and responsibilities. Majority of my gameplay will be solo, PvP and pugging dungeons/raids whenever possible. Perhaps a healer isn‚Äôt the best choice for this type of player, but I just love being a healer.
---
The 5man dungeons in vanilla are some of the best content in the game. Highly recommend doing all of them. Also Sunken Temple has actual Dragons in it to fight. And class quests, epic drops (not really because of low drop rate). But yeah make sure you have a few hours to play when going in. Getting lost in there was super easy. :D
---
Some are good, but all these where they just put "wow classic" on top of an existing meme are bad. These "here we go again" memes are especially low effort.
---
It wouldn't be so bad if they only got posted once or twice, but in the past week this low effort content has been the majority of this subs content.
---
Fury warriors going as dps and rolling on tank gear are the worst people in the world.
---
Bold statement. I‚Äôm not saying it won‚Äôt happen, but I hope it will not be the case. 
---
This is one of things I hate from retail so much. I need to have an immersive world with the exact same people in it always. People popping in and out from different realms is a deal breaker for me. I will cancel my sub and go right back to my fav private server in a heartbeat.
---
Leveling a druid in balance spec will suck. 
---
Leveling a druid in Resto spec will suck.
---
Leveling a druid in feral spec is super easy. Not only do you have better speed and survival skills than most classes, but you can also tank 5m dungeons which makes finding groups fast and easy. If you keep a 2nd set of gear with +int +spi on it you can actually heal, dps, or tank in 5m dungeons.
---
When leveling from 1 to 60 Feral druid is probably the best class and spec to be.
---
Phase 3 for that but maybe if you level sloooow and steady! :D
---
More like me 50 yards out in the sticks staying the fuck away from the road

Do whatever sounds better. If you can't decide, use a coin or a random number generator.
---
I appreciate the use of katakana in the drawing. Amazing taste!
---
That fucking stride tho
---
And here we see your typical PvP player, unable to fathom that anyone could possibly enjoy the game differently than he does, compulsively insulting anyone who dares to suggest something he dislikes.
---
The Holy damage abilities just kind of suck no matter what you do, they can get you by on occasion in 1v1s, but yeah, theyre just overall weak. Hybrid shadow is a really awkward build, you lose a LOT of valuable healing talents and you lose a LOT of valuable shadow talents, while the other hybrid classes dont give up nearly as much in any school going for hybrid specs.
---
Very true much so true at all.
---
You cannot sap 2 enemies at once and surely one of them will be smart enough to use a single AoE to unstealth and engage you while the other is sapped.
---
Command is almost unnoticeable in both PvE and PvP. Its so minor youll never notice the difference. Its hard to directly compare Hardiness and Shadowmeld since theyre different factions, but id still probably take Hardiness. Its just stun resist plain and simple
---
I'd play a pally if I didn't have to wear a dress. Sorta ruins the fun walking around as some buff dude carry lilies and wearing a teal dress and some weird looking druid shoulders

---
&gt; healbot and recursive will no longer work
---
Good.  I really want to play the game to actually play the game.  Getting passed over for a raid because I refuse to install a "click here to win" button would be a son of a bitch.
---
Aaah yes, because worrying about anything you said is so much more fun than just picking what you like and going with it.
---
Your kind is what ruins MMO's with your min maxing of every little detail.
---
Tbh I started on Alliance and imo they have superior quests. I ended up rolling Horde and taking that to 60 but this time around I'm taking Alliance.
---
I wouldn't be in a rush if I was playing something else that was interesting but there's just nothing out there getting me psyched right now
---
Quillboars are the ones that somehow overpower the Tauren iirc.
---
NO token please Blizz!!!
---
I guess I can stop using a thesaurus to help come up with cool thematic names now lol
---
Yeah I noticed that it can be really frustrating for those of us who for whatever reason can't or don't want to go full-on no-life neckbeard early on in Classic since there's so many BiS lists.
---
More coming as soon as I can manage ;)
---
Shoes would just get in the way of kicking the alliance's ass.
---
Well that sounds super-enticing ;)
---
I'll get on some as soon as possible. It takes a lot of research and cross-checking to make this sort of guide, but hopefully now that I've done it once, the next ones should be easier.
---
I did it literally all the time. You only have to sap them at the very end of the recap cast time. Which wastes 6 or so seconds. Combined with vanish, preparation, fan of knives, cloak of shadows, and sprint. I would always hold it long enough.
---
Perhaps this only worked in Cata due to the spells. But still. Guaranteeing they never held that first tower gave my team a huge advantage every game.
---
Wow. Being a hunter really sucks.
---
I guess I wont be heavily recruited as a warlock this time around. I'm going to miss being rare and desired...
---
Hey I'm planning on playing WoW for the first time when classic comes out and I'm looking to join a guild that plans to do raids and is willing to help me learn all about this great game while making some memories along the way! I'm planning on rolling a mage. Would love to join!
---
thanks for the input!
---
I mean I used it because I couldn‚Äôt get dal rend to drop, did fine until I finally got brut blade.
---
It will be hard to leave the Horde if I do go
---
Or an axe in their head. It really brings their look together.
---
This is the right answer. Ill just add in the Paladin matchup though is that you can choose to run away and disengage at pretty much anytime, so while theyll win if you choose to just take the fight down to low health, theyll HoJ you when you shift out of Bear and finish you, but if you decide early that the fight isnt going the right way, you can literally just leave.
---
Ah, I see you are a man of class as well.
---
I remember fighting tooth and nail on a level 30 or so to kill him with the guards of darkshire. All I got was his femur which was a white offhand lol. So disappointing but it was fun.
---
I farmed sm until I got the legendary ring for my twink. I have killed everything in there so many times. Literally hundreds. 3% drop rate was rough.
---
If you want something new play alliance, if you want to relive something familiar play horde.
---
took 7 days for me
---
People are implying you can only ever play orc, I'm disagreeing, saying each race has its merits, and people should play what they want. Read the thread. Read ANY part of this thread.
---
On pserver you could level a low level friend to 25 in like 2 hours or less if you are a pally with decent gear and pull all of ragefire chasm. You need a warlock alt parked there to summon people though
---
Man don't even worry about it.
---
I'm going to be starting a casual guild for new players if you are interested. 
---
I bet there will be plenty of new players. I didn't play classic myself. I started in Burning Crusade as a trial, and even then, didn't get a character to max level til nearly Cata. 
---
Do yourself a favor and don't read into stuff too much. Half the fun in playing it for the first time and figuring it out for yourself.
---
I played Alliance back in retail, when I played again on pservers a while ago, I played on Ally again and loved the old familiar feeling. After that server went down and I went to a new server, I started playing Horde and it really peaked my interest again seeing the other half.
---
So Id say, if you havent played vanilla in a while, stick with Horde, if youve been playing pservers a while only as Horde, Id say switch it up for a bit of change
---
According to a census  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9yt514/world\_of\_warcraft\_classic\_census\_and\_demographics/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9yt514/world_of_warcraft_classic_census_and_demographics/)   
---
rogues won't be as prominent as initially thought? obviously it's just a speculation but could maybe bare some truth
---
You get 2 priest racial and the actual racial.  Dwarf isn't just about fear ward, it also has desperate prayer a free instant cast self heal, and dwarf stoneform to clear stuff like poisons and bleeds.
---
NE gets starshards, a bad damage spell that is basically not worth casting, elunes grace which is a 10% activated evasion, and shadowmeld that unlike live does not break you out of combat meaning it has almost no pve usefulness.  
---
Any of the three dwarf racials are better then all 3 of the night elf ones combined.  It is really imbalanced.  
---
Priest are highly desirable so you shouldn't have an issue getting into raids/5mans as a NE, but a lot of raids would specifically recruit dwarfs over other races if only because it showed that the person was willing to minmax their character properly.
---
Yes, everyone should be forced to play the right way. Mwahahaha
---
Doesn't matter if you'll get the gear or not or raid... Just what ever class you think looks super bad ass with their end game gear... Play that.
---
All of them.
---
Very well done!

I think most people are concerned about what their raid DPS will be, and Warlocks don‚Äôt really start putting up big numbers until the much later stages of the game due to not having enough spell hit on early raiding gear.
---
lmao, you just called someone who wants to have fun an asshole. You should look back at yourself buddy.
---
Nice ru doing more?
---
Yeah, but that's what makes it the best one - feels good to laugh *with* the people getting messed with, rather than *at* them
---
You might as well ask if they're going to put in transmorg, or flying mounts, or achievements or pet battling. They're all just as likely as tokens in Classic.
---
I'd rather have a hunter spamming wingclip than a enhancement shaman trying to keep nightfall up any day of the week. Specc was literally hot garbage until BC came out. So was elemental. Rip shaman dps dreams.
---
Planning on it ;)
---
they did the stat squish in warlords right? i think i have some screenshots of my druid tank in mists peaking at 1.3mil hp, and my heroic geared lock had over 1mil hp too, used to sling out those sweet 1mil+ chaos bolt crits on timeless isle
---
Yes. If you only want one undead go Priest Undead + Orc Rogue. :)
---
Agree with all that except 2 minor additions, Hunters for kiting and while an "Arcane Mage" wont actually be using Arcane Missiles, AP/Frost is definitely a viable spec for MC/BWL when theres a few Winter's Chill bitches in the guild.
---
U could always rp as a chick u know haha
---
haha this made me laugh, if this happened to me i would not even get mad.
---
Hunter can kite almost forever if given enough range, but they couldn't really aoe and had limited mana without having to reset.
---
There was a vanilla frost mage that made videos of him soloing a lot of elites and bosses.  Stupid Mage Tricks by Faxmonkey  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O_pNDc73MM
---
I don't pay as much attention to private servers, so maybe people are doing crazier stuff now a days.
---
I really want to main a shadow priest...
---
21 lmao, I was top 20 world at the end of TBC with literally 5 fps on bosses, unlucky.
---
Carebear! :)
---
As someone who quit because of the travesty that Cata was... I'm honestly so happy I never got to see whatever this game is now
---
Hi, pservers have plenty of high DPS dagger rogues competitive with sword rogues, if you don't prefer this play style that's fine, but the differences are tiny, and daggers has better wep skill support. It falls to preference. Having raided(albiet casually, up to aq20), I always topped minmaxxed sword rogues in the meters, perhaps when you finally get the chance to play you might understand. Untill then try to be less pompous, and ignorant. If servers are full of people like you this is gonna suck, 20 neckbeards a raid fighting over the swords that drop because being behind the target is too hard aparently, being shitty to people who disagree, and running raids into the ground by forcing slowing loot progress.
---
Hi, /u/OverKast78
---
I'm an EMT currently in paramedic school. Really won't be playing classic that much due to my heavy course load in the fall. However, haven't smoked in over a year and a half but I comment on /r/leaves to try and help people out so I'm wondering what you read.
---
It's simple, you read a thread you like about swords, so that's the only option now. Stop to analyze the class please, perhaps try playing the game.
---
nightelves are built for two things: hiding, and dying
---
I played horde. If I switch to alliance, I‚Äôd feel like such a traitor and can‚Äôt live with that!
---
For the Horde!
---
I was just joking about the demands. Great video. Other classes would definitely benefit from this kind of thing.  
---
I think you should frame an option in your videos for people who are good at producing gold. The sentence you use could say something like "If amassing gold is your strong point, you could grab these items for a big booster shot to start off"  
---
I mainly say this because my ability to produce gold will far outstrip my ability to run consistent groups.
---
I made up a straw poll for classes/roles for the next guide. I tried to stick to basically the most viable options (so no boomkin guide planned, sorry), but obviously there's some overlap. Also, I think that for the most part a lot of the healers will find that the priest guide covers a lot of the same items they'll want to snag anyway, so if I get to other healers it'll be much later.
---
Let me know what you'd like next:  [https://www.strawpoll.me/17886879](https://www.strawpoll.me/17886879)
---
havened touch vanilla since retail, never pservers at all. That insight on having not played it in that long made me think that playing it first again as my original Horde choice could be the best
---
As far as I recall, Tauren were still restricted to Wolves and Kodos.
---
That only changed in the TBC pre-patch (the first thing I did was to get my War Raptor).
---
How is this at -4 lol. Reddit is a fickle beast.
---
WF is still a great damage even with the CD.
---
Eventually both for sure this time
---
You forgot arcane power first
---
I heard ya it would be hard, just wanted to see what others are trying and thoughts.
---
Druids can decurse
---
Love the advice. Will do that ;)
---
"Feeling cute" would make more sense for a Balance druid, to be honest
---
I won‚Äôt play if they add tolens. I would distort the economy making the interaction of players via the action house less meaningful.
---
&gt; I'm a huge liberal who doesn't play retail and can't wait for classic.
---
But maybe you live in or came from a conservative environment?
---
Or... you are one of those who actually care about the game they play, regardless of cultural aspects :√ê
---
That sounds cool if you lack healers and still want the debuff. But a dedicated Spriest is IMO better for the job. A full Warlock group of 4 + an Spriest seems more effective if you have a slot to apply Vampiric.
---
Orc. Stun resist is OP as hell.
---
I played through vanilla and pservers.
---
Enhance is viable and if you don't think you're a warrior with windfury then you can really dominate. 
---
I had earthshaker as my weapon in vanilla and if you like combos it's great.
---
I was Tauren so it could basically stunlock people. 
---
That stun is 3 seconds which lets you cast a heal or Chain Lightning.. then War Stomp and get another swing in possibly setting up another stun from the weapon. 
---
I miss vanilla lol.  I never played elemental until TBC because they nerfed enhance to almost complete shit
---
How would this be better than a simple website that lists recruiting guilds and their raiding times and discord links?
---
Everyone likes to think VPN are safe or protecting you, but in reality all you are doing is sending ALL of your internet traffic to some third party.
---
I thought I knew where a lot was and realized.. .just like directions.. I'm always remembering wrong
---
Totally agree with the OP. Vanilla WoW was great because it allowed players to make their own lore in Azeroth. Sure, there were plenty of big bads to kill, but the game never centered around one main villain in Vanilla. The story was all about the players, unknown adventurers running around encountering the wonders of the world.
---
Do it. Don't listen to people telling something is good or not. 99% of us won't be in min/maxing guilds, and there will be a need for Shadow Priests anyway. Seriously, the game would be boring as f if all the players played only half the specs available...
---
On pservers getting both ZG and dragonslayer buff is really easy. Then you have DMT, where one team just does it, creates a raid and everyone can go in.
---
You can still bring budget version of consumables: greater mana pot instead of major, sagefish delight instead of the better one, lesser mana oil instead of brilliant, etc.
---
Then you can have a few of the quality ones in your bag, and only pop them for one boss if really needed.
---
With this attitude you'll be 80% as good as a full tryhard resto druid, is that really that big of a difference when farming stuff?
---
Spell batching will be there, so it's likely the 2 second ticks will be there as well. It is a pretty major part of cat and rouge rotations.
---
Just a note: Good guilds often consider loot distribution when recruiting, especially if they aiming towards being small. So aiming for daggers can help in that regard.
---
Good job, People on reddit doesnt realize this. Its hard to get a perfect dataset for things like this. So instead of writing comments like this above you. They should just say thanks for the good work! Good job OP
---
I remember sustaining 500 DPS in Nighthold during legion. Things were getting pretty wild around that time.

FFA server would be sweet. That's how PvP used to be in old school MMO. Player reputation was super important so people made clear decisions about who to attack, it wasn't the Wild West that most would imagine it to be. Kin Killers were those that attacked their others from their own race, and it would get people ejected from guilds.
---
It does wonders saving your tanks from fear mechanics
---
Considering you dont have termor totem
---
I don't get the belt reference, what am I missing here? :)
---
Just talking in vent in one of those hey where does everyone live kinda things.  I actually met a couple different hunters in my guild irl, the other one worked at Activision funny enough.
---
I've been wanted to play fem NE  rogue for the animations.  Will guilds just give swords to the human rogues?  I don't really wanna miss out and would probably roll human if it's gonna be a pain to gear. .
---
Pain in the arse for allies to get there, but very good loot and a creepy dungeon. The last boss being almost 10 levels above the first mobs is kinda annoying. Same with VanCleef and Deadmines iirc.
---
[Glenn Stafford](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Glenn_Stafford) is a genius. I still listen to the WC2 music occasionally.

Looking for a PvP, horde, north American, Pacific time zone, casual/semi hardcore PvP/raiding guild. Played a lot of vanilla back in 2004 and up till wrath. Looking forward to pre made battle grounds or open world PvP. I also don't mind dungeons or raids but prefer PvP. Thank you.
---
I would agree that Tauren vs. Orc is pretty close. But you have to make use of stomp or else that 200hp isn't doing enough. My thought about stomp is that you need to fully incorporate it and not just use it as an afterthought or "oh shit" button. It can be used early and often in a fight.
---
Dude leave him alone, he's probably read like 5 buzzfeed articles on how to pick up women
---
He had us going in the first half
---
Tier sets should be good enough
---
5v1 against someone who is green to you. Very brave.
---
Despite all the flying mount hate, I had the best time in TBC. Not to say classic wPvP wasn‚Äôt fantastic, because it was. However in TBC I got a reputation as a ganker on my server was called out every day on the forums and made cross factional friendships through world pvp. My 2c happy to elaborate on the last part if anyone gives a fuck.
---
lol there is a reason I played a pally in vanilla :) I just maybe, and I mean a hard maybe, want to try something different :)
---
Engineering utilities are so powerful in PvP because they break patterns. Having some additional damage or health doesn't do nearly as much as having extra utility or breaking a combo.
---
Also several engineering gadgets are not gimmicky at all. Grenades are another bread and butter CC you can add to your disposal. There are several of pieces that increase both horizontal and vertical mobility. There is stealth detection for flag defenders/attackers and so on.
---
There is just one good mace before aq and thats ironfoe
---
Fear ward is the best, not Only for Magmadar, onyxia, Nefarian.
---
But also bug trio in Aq40, adds in aq40 does fear.
---
So that little damn spell is amazeballs. Dwarf Priest is a god amongst priest
---
I'm sticking with Horde. I want some of those nostalgia feels, and I won't get as many by going Alliance. Besides that I got an Alliance alt up to 30ish back in the day and the change in scenery did not thrill me as much as I had hoped.
---
Dual wielding, carrying 2x 1h wep
---
And then TBC came along and ruined everything.
---
I know aesthetics and lore don't matter much to a lot of people, but I really can't overstate how glad I am to be getting back to the *proper* Horde with Classic.
---
Gnomes are for punting.
---
Elves are for eating.
---
The only good pointy ears is one with tusks.
---
Lok-tar ogar, brothers! *For the Horde!*
---
Stacking resistances is IMO one of the most underrated things in vanilla PvP, especially for flag carriers,  Warriors and others who generally soak up a ton of spells.
---
I was just yesterday watching a Tesla self-driving demo that went through the countryside west of San Jose and I was struck by how "Central Wisconsin Countryside" it looked. It's truly incredible how close you can be to the mecca of technology without being inundated by it. Kinda cool.
---
I'm in the same boat. I played a Tauren Druid back in BC and loved it. I'm so stuck choosing Horde or Alliance. Don't mind going NE or Tauren.
---
Elemental is really powerful and more bursty for PvP but also more gear depenand. There is nothing wrong with going frost IMO.
---
Sounds good. Join this discord and we can chat more: https://discord.gg/ZmCv6p
---
Either way if you want to heal in raids you are going to be Holy or Resto spec. You will do horrible dps in those spec and solo farming would be inefficient.
---
Grinding gold as a resto shaman can still be super easy if you make friends with 4 fury warriors and do Live Strat melee cleave runs. 
---
It would look like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6H6TCUEJc8
---
If you have enough time I'd advise you to make a farming alt. Dungeon grinding is the safest so hunter or mage would be a nice pick.
---
Come at me, hordies.
---
It depends on the guild. I would say most guilds won't screw you over just because your race is sub-optimal, especially if you're pulling your weight, and are a reliable and valued guild-member. Also, a lot of guilds use a "DKP" point system, where you bid for loot with points that you earn by attending raids, so if that's the situation, everyone is equal. 
---
That being said, if you're thinking of raiding, and you like swords, I would recommend going human. NE is only optimal if you go daggers and if you think daggers are good.
---
Technically he is not an spriest if he just has shadow weaving and PI, the terminology in that case is 'support spec.' Term spriest reserved at minimum for someone with the majority of talents in shadow and realistically also having shadowform.
---
An addtional misconception:
---
Gear dependency in terms of just raw damage and survivability is a thing, but it is often blown out of porpotion. Good players can play around having less stats and still have high impact.
---
&gt;I always topped minmaxxed sword rogues in the meters
---
Playing with shitters doesnt count lol, if you are getting outdpsed by a dagger rogue as sword you are trash.
---
Druid the most popular class. I knew it!
---
Also, I want to see it...
---
And the entire world populated by nothing but night elves and dwarves.
---
oh i was thinking carrying a 2h wep. male trolls with 2h wep (axe/sword/mace, not staffs or polearms) also look awesome in combat
---
They're definitely writing one big blue post.
---
Release date, maybe?
---
Aside from that, they're preparing for the Beta.
---
One of the most important stats for leveling fast as a Druid is Spirit regardless of the spec.
---
A warrior in T3 gear, consumables and flask will have about 10k HP. Add worldbuffs and you'll be at 12-13k HP. The 5% tauren HP is calculated off of total HP (Not stamina and not base HP, but total HP). Meaning at 10k you'll have an addition 500hp from the racial.
---
People really underestimate the potential of shadowmeld in world pvp.
---
So can warlocks
---

---
Hey, nice video, thanks!
---
One thought about the pre 60 stuff. I read somewhere that you are able to to heal dungeons up to the early 50s using a standard shadow spec. So up until now I planned on respecing at 60 for healing. 
---
Do you spec into healing before 60 to heal those dungeons or do you join them with your solo leveling shadow spec as a dps?
---
The fun factor alone would be worth it for me. But perhaps not from a level efficency perspective.
---
In PvP you almost never melee in cat form except for your openers and applying bleeds or to chase down someone who has lost the fight. So as a Druid vs. a Paladin you mostly just make them OOM. Takes a very long time but you'll eventually get there because you spend almost no mana offensively. Paladins don't have enough damage to burst you except there is a significant gear and/or level difference.
---
5v1, any race is the best race.
---
Top tier unironic self-own post.
---
This dwarf trying to pass as a night elf.
---
Then don't leave it. You are what you identify yourself with. We don't want hordies in the Alliance... you'll be cursing the Horde, group up against them, conspire, etc. You don't want to feel like the enemy of your own.
---
Update: Blizzard responded within the day. Activated an authenticator, added text alerts, and they deleted the character. They didn't have time to make me any gold..rip.
---
Any alliance priest not playing dwarf is only doing it to be controversial.
---
It all comes down to the following question imo. Do you want to enjoy the game as much as possible through the leveing process or all you care about is rushing to the end game to then start raiding competitivly? If you dont care about rushing the leveling process then you might as well roll on the opposite faction and enjoy a whole different game, where your character is moved by completely different feelings.
---
Anyhow, enjoy!!
---
Stealth is Vanilla is very powerful indeed.
---
&gt; "what class should I play"
---
and, for some reason, the answer is always Druid
---
Experience the other side!  It's a different game.
---
Dude, I know what you mean.  I was only 16, but I am in the same boat as you now minus the children.  I got lucky though and found a woman that "would never date someone who played WoW" and got her hooked on it lol.
---
When people look at fear ward, they really look at it in a vacuum and judge a raid with fear ward vs a raid without fear ward. You will not be the only priest in the raid, and the odds of the other priest not being a dwarf is pretty low since everyone knows better by now. Outside of all of the tanks being fearwarded on fear fights it doesn't scale. So a take a raid with 2 dwarf priest vs a raid with 8 dwarf priest. The 2nd raid isn't 4 times better, it's mostly the same raid because in both raids the tanks are fearwarded.
---
That being said Dwarf is objectively better and it is incorrect not to play, as the other races offer extremely little value outside of meme shadowmeld ganking, and even in PvP just keeping yourself fearwarded has enough value that you would always want to be dwarf. This isn't even including the bonus of having stoneform.
---
Be a Dwarf either way just incase, unless you really overvalue aesthetics. People will probably bully you for not being a Dwarf as well, so it can make a better play experience just to be one to not piss other people off.
---
NO.
---
But, almost certainly, the /cast \[@player\] Regrowth (Rank 3) way
---
Maybe with @mouseover and @focus disabled
---
Atleast you have it! Some people in the world don't even have that.
---
I've been mostly stuck on what class. Now I'm just stuck on whether to go tauren or nelf druid
---
I always stay shadow til 60 byouuse I can, but it's really up to how good you can heal imo.
---
I still have 21 fps
---
A gnome rogue with dual wield 1.3 speed daggers in hemo spec?
---
Shammy‚Äôs don‚Äôt have taunt or abilities to pull mobs off healers or gung-ho dpsers. As players get better gear, with more stats, it‚Äôd prove harder for a shammy tank. Just my opinion.
---
I think you're missing the point. It's not about "wow look how powerful this racial is, nelves are so great", it's more like "haha look what you can do with a party of nelves, that guy walked right into our ambush and must have shat himself". It's called ganking, nobody is arguing that it takes skill.
---
Damn!!! I loved questing there! Might go there to grind on mobs then at some point as there are great camps of mobs. üëç
---
I agree.   
---
It could be great. If done right.  
---
However... Do you trust them now to do it right? Maybe not.   
---
But man, so much good lvl60 content missed.
---
Its not like "purists" care what other people do anyway. They will form groups/raids/guilds with like minded people.
---
Keep in mind that the token *doesn't add* gold to the economy, it just moves it between players, so it's no different than selling runs for gold or powerleveling for gold or rare items/whatever.
---
That being said, know that the token has a dedicated infrastructure separated from "normal" AH and unified per region, that means that all servers within the same region buy and sell from the same pool.
---
This means that to have the token on Classic they would have to setup a dedicated infrastructure for it, you can't put Classic servers together with retail ones. It's a huge cost with no returns (they already has their returns on retail) so it doesn't make any sense from a business perspective.
---
Also NOT having the token on Classic will push people to play retail if they want to pay their sub with gold, retail is still Blizzard's flagship, let's not forget this.
---
Hehe I understand. I find them funny because I‚Äôve removed myself from ‚Äúmeme-culture‚Äù for the past 5 years or so. So all of these are fresh to me ;)
---
I mean, I played during Vanilla for virtually the whole run of the game. Got a night elf hunter to ~55 before ditching her for a tauren druid on another server just before TBC launched.
---
But I suppose since I didn't have a character at 60 that doesn't count.
---
In this case I pay for the service and I trust the company behind it (F-Secure). But you are totally true. You gotta pick your provider carefully.
---
Logitech G502. It has a great grip, it has a lot of buttons for not being an "MMO Mouse", and it performs very well. Plus the scroll wheel is awesome.
---
I personally can't stand "MMO Mice" that have 8-12 thumb buttons. They don't feel good in the hand.
---
You're not going to be farming as a Resto Shaman or Holy Priest. You can, but its wildly inefficient.  Probably better to just invest the gold and time into leveling an alt. 
---
There really aren't many opportunities to have your cake and eat it too in Classic WoW.
---
It‚Äôs still true. When I started vanilla on a pserver I started a Shaman with the intention of being a DPS. Ended up healing at 60 of course, which I enjoyed in PvE but the constant respec costs ruined it for me. If I knew that from the start, I would have played a Warlock.
---
It‚Äôs better to not encourage people‚Äôs delusions when it comes to meme specs, ‚Äúplay what you want‚Äù sounds nice and all, but leveling a class to 60 and then realizing that it is a deadweight and no matter the effort, you won‚Äôt be able to compete is just terrible.
---
Or people who played pretty well all through Vanilla but never got to 60. Like myself.

Given the choice between two healers, most people aren't going to pick Druid for 5-mans; but you're never picking between two healers. You're pretty much just happy that you have a healer at all and you can do the dungeon.
---
I guess I'll just make my gold of alchemy and herbing, don't have the time for more than one character. Thanks for responses
---
I tried alliance for BFA launch, I honestly felt like a traitor. Plus alliance dont throw down for their boys the way horde do. I would get ganked and an ally would just ride on by, if I ganked a horde and another horde rode by he would die for his horde brother.
---
Horde for life. Im rolling my alt alliance though.
---
And when you finally encounter someone, you'll get destroyed. But at least you got to do some slinking before that.
---
pretty sure skelly is left after you actually rez? I was always under the impression mouseoverable bodies were people still running back/rage logged while dead.
---
Considering I'll be playing a hybrid class (ie healer) I need that alt for farming and just general dickery :(
---
After you respawn in a radius of your corpse the skeleton lasts for 3 hours, if you logout as a ghost your corpse remains there until you retrieve it. 
---
I could be wrong on 3 hours please correct me if I am
---
But the opposite of love *is* hate
---
Detachment is the absence of either, not the opposite
---
Right as you resurrect, your corpse will be replaced by a skeleton. When you are a ghost and log out your corpse will stay there.
---
I can't be mad, that song is too fantastic.
---
I just level an alt for farming. But if you're going to do that may as well just level a second Shaman and use that for PvP.
---
Waaater sucks
---
Chances of getting a tank slot in a raid guild is small, they need two total. Most will aim for a "no-lifer" to be main tank for the sake of progress.
---
The only one being pompous and ignorant is you though especially when you throw insults around even though they responded nice to you.
---
A night elf dagger rogue will do less dps than a human sword rogue on average when both are equal skilled. 
---
Nobody is saying you can't play a night elf dagger rogue but the OP asked and cares about minmaxing. 
---
So when saying "yeah but i did well in raids with my dagger rogue" thats nice and all but doesn't contribute to the topic at all.
---
I knew a huntard who did it!
---
IF they can do it right I would be all for this. Implement a 2.0-ish talent tree post Naxx and start working on those neat zones, raids and Bags that were planned but never implemented. I would be all for that.
---
Thottbot.
---
Ah yes, the good old conceding r/woosh comment.
---
You just hit the nail right on the head.
---
Back when WoW was still the World of Warcraft and not the World of Retcons and Spacecraft.
---
While I may agree that TBC was the pinnacle of WoW when it comes to gameplay, TBC was one of the worst expansions they ever did when it comes to lore. Gameplay wise WoW died with Cata, but lore wise it unfortunately already died with TBC. They took half of their most iconic characters and just dumped them into the garbage bin.
---
WotLK was better in this regard, but I still think they overplayed Arthas and underplayed Ner'Zhul who should have been the dominant part of the Lich King.
---
So then, what happens if I create a character, get it killed somewhere, log out as a ghost, and never touch that character again. Will my body become a permanent fixture of that server?
---
My do the Alt thing, yeah Horde , we scrum it up, you're right
---
Good points!
---
I hear ya  on that, good points!
---
ah ofc, because shamans don't get better gear.  Makes sense.
---
That's a bit how I felt making 1 to 20 but that was later on in the expansions
---
The title specifies night elf - my contention is that then being night elves had nothing to do with them winning. I wasn't dishing on the shadowmeld gimmick, but the title itself - although I knew all along it was written with a smirk. I just like to be that guy, you know? *pinches your cheek*
---
I remember that character ‚ÄúNotdead‚Äú, a corpse in front of orgrimmar. Was there for about a week i think, don't know if he resurrected.
---
It really seems like you just want to play night elf. Do it then. But its factually worse in PvE compared to humans no matter how much you would like to argue and overthink it.
---
Now all you need is sulfuras
---
You want the tactile feedback when putting your foot up their asses.
---
Check out nobbels lore videos on youtube there is a bunch of lore!
---
A paladin tanked patchwerk in vanilla.
---
Have fun spamming one button all of classic. lmao
---
I started healing strat at 55 as mostly a disc priest, while the rest of the group was 60. I thought it was easier than grinding all the time.  I was alliance and there was always paladins that wanted to use their maces to attack things and let me heal.  Though to be fair I might have been lucky that I initially leveled quickly and people were in need of healers and would take people under 60.
---
Yeah, I've seen plenty of deliberately named corpses left in conspicuous locations. Don't think they lasted forever, but I don't know lol. So the question is, do they eventually time out, and if so, after how long?
---
It's funny, Blizz rereleasing TBC is *my* nightmare scenario.
---
I enjoyed the hell out of the expansion at the time, mostly because of the class/spec design you mentioned. In hindsight, though, that's just about the only thing they got right with it.
---
Flight killed the tension of running around zones and shrank the world. The arena killed the RPG aspect of quirky, fun items and flavorful class identity. Centralized quest hubs killed the sense of adventure and exploration. The BBEG end boss killed the sense of this being a great big world with a lot going on in it. Giving the Alliance shamans and the Horde paladins killed faction identity. The frakking blood elves killed the character of the Horde.
---
I'd love to see the Classic team adopt the OSRS approach and take inspiration from/straight up rip off the class/spec design from TBC, but I desperately hope they don't take the easy way out and simply roll into the next expansion.
---
They have a chance here to do something different and correct the mistakes they made that only became apparent with the benefit of hindsight. It would be a damn shame to see that opportunity squandered.
---
Your body stays on the ground until the weekly maintenance then disappear but your character will still be in ghost form when you log in
---
Feral druid running a pally oom hey? That's going to be a no from me dawg.
---
Absolutely negligible
---
Hmm, i wonder if this is a fixed variable or it differs from server to server. 
---
Might wait for classic to be sure (:
---
&gt; edit: I don't get why people hate on daggers, they do fine damage.
---
Its not hating on daggers, its just that sword &gt; dagger even if its just by a bit.
---
Yeah maybe respecing at around 55 and level "the hard way" to 60 while picking up some gear on the way might be optimal.
---
That seems a likely correct answer!
---
I started in TBC and it took me 24 days /played to get to 70. LOL I must have messed around in Wpvp and BG's a fair bit...
---
nobody is saying that.
---
The alliance stands with you on this - kill ALL the gnomes (or at least stamp on them!)
---
That's why I play Horde this time, because I have no idea where the F you go after lvl 20. Only leveled Horde once, during TBC. Alliance I had 3 (or 4, one might have been in the 50s) at 60 in vanilla, 7 of them at 70 in TBC.
---
So we're going Horde because all my friends are in the same situation. It's so much new stuff for us, and why ruin that by reading and watching 100 videos.
---
Same goes for Ret pally then?
---
The thing is that the other priests in the raid can keep fear ward up on other dmg targets like rogues etc. This Will objectively increase the dmg output of the raid and easier up fights. I know our guild in vanilla struggled hard on aq40 trash before Ouro since of fear ward, and those trash are beasts to a "casual" guild.
---
As someone who played a gnome from the release of the game to Dark Iron being made playable in BFA, and is going to play Horde this time in classic (most probably, a female Tauren) I feel conflicted.  I guess I'll murder them first and /moo their corpses later if/when they not release, as it is a funny, unique, and not disrepectful emote.
---
My gnome lock is almost 60 on pserver and I'm glad I did it because it just keeps reassuring me that alliance isn't for me.
---
Blizzard can't be trusted to add new content to Classic WoW. Just look at what they have done to Retail WoW.
---
It's also not a good comparison to look at a 3 year old private server and say "Classic servers will be dead after 3 years". There are tons of different reasons why people avoid private servers.
---
This looks like it could be useful for you too:
---
https://forum.classicwow.live/topic/19/threat-guide-and-reference-table
---
nop your body disappear from the world but you can still rez at the spot you died, you can also rez at the angel tho
---
I had a full set of Devout along with other gear shortly after hitting 60.  I was able to mix and match to keep the bonuses I wanted.
---
Im so torn about what should i play. I played hunter late vanilla and it was my first lvl 60. Didnt get to raid much since TBC came after 1month i dinged 60.
---
Right now im still thinking about rolling hunter. People are saying that hunter dps falls of to memespec level at AQ and naxx? I have hard time believing this and would like to hear comments on this from a hunter that actually raided in vanilla in high tier raids. I dont trust private server logs. 
---
IIRC hunters were doing insane damage in pvp thou? I could almost 2 shot people (with same lvl of gear) with aimed +multi shot when they critted and i mostly had just dungeon set. 
---
Im also thinking about going shaman. I love elemental shamans, but im also aware that i would have to heal in raids and that would be fine. Never actually healed raid and that might be new and fun way to experience vanilla again. How Good or bad  elemental was in pvp? How easy/hard it is to gear elemental shaman?
---
Once you start messing with classic, it is classic anymore. i do know at Blizzcon they announced a few changes they were making at the end of their classic presentation, but it would not affect gameplay or the classic frame
---
I'm gonna do 0/30/21 while leveling and never respec.
---
Empyrean demolisher beg to differ
---
Honestly, I like human almost as much as far as looks. However, I'm all about that dagger life, and if you believe, as I do, that daggers can keep up with swords, then it's not factually worse. The reason I believe daggers are just as good, if not better, than swords is because this is a topic that comes up every now and then. You can research what people say, and the general consensus appears to support my view.
---
Yeah I totally agree, it is better to have extra fearwards for dps but compared to fearwarding the tank it's not a make or break thing.
---
Depends what you want to level as I'm guessing you want to heal at end game so either or. However, priests levels as a caster with little downtime if you have a wand, while shamans mostly auto while using shock on cd. If it was up to me I would go shaman, any day I leveled one on a pserv and had a great time. Not to mention you can get offspec gear and reck house with windfury
---
Although Bonereavers edge from MC is too Good to pass.
---
In any case slam specc just takes up time and no benefit on alliance since you interuppt whites and need to be standing still. Hamstrings on alliance is still there. Slam on ragedump only.
---
15 healers 7 rogues  
---
i fucking loved vanilla :D
---
Pull with chain lighting, earth shock taunt.  I've seen people go as far as Scholo before being a complete liability, so it definitely works.
---
Half of the Shaman tanking battle is finding other players that want to have fun the same way you are, else you'll make them upset.
---
Will do, thank you!
---
yes, the plague started pretty early in wow
---
It's true I was the honor farm victim
---
found the pver
---
Minecraft.
---
With all the new goodies and fiddly bits that just came out in 1.14 I'll basically be learning half the game all over again. Should keep me busy for a good while. Hopefully long enough for us to finally get a bloody release date.
---
I want ShadowMeld sooo bad, but I would have to commit suicide if I rolled NE. I want to live more than I want ShadowMeld. 
---
Female Dwarf hunter it is.
---
Please dont forget we talking retail here. There will be ALOT of priest that did not play privat server , or dont roll dwarf.
---
Sure the hardcore guilds will all have dwarf, but OP isnt a hardcore player or he wouldn't ask.
---
And in a more "casual" guild it dwarf priest will be a hard thing to come by.
---
So if you can stand playing dwarf go for it, ppl will just favor dwarf priest.
---
Lol I clicked on /r/toolband thinking it was somehow another classic related sub that I didn't know about. Oh, right, or course it's about the band named Tool.
---
For reals though, do they have another album due out soon or something? Cause that would be dope.
---
I know what I'm getting myself into with wanding or auto attacking that doesn't bother me, but yeah I think I'm sold on shaman now
---
I agree with adding new content to it IF it's on a separate server and the original classic server you made your characters on stayed as it was and you can copy your character over to it.
---
i think bc servers with the option to migrate your character to them is the best option
---
id prob just make a new character for bc so i can play both bc and vanilla
---
i dont want to play some custom classic server , none of the people that made vanilla are still at blizzard and look at retail if you want to see the sort of content they would add
---
1. Check r/classicwow
---
2. Refresh for an hour
---
3. Try really hard to find a way to either knock myself out and wake on launch day 
---
4. Realize 3 would be bad for health, brainstorm ideas how to fast forward time
---
5. cry because this shit is taking too long
---
6. work
---
7. beer
---
8. repeat
---
Holy fuck, I can't WAIT for this! I had the Scarlet Crusade mail armor set back in Vanilla. Too bad I'm maining rogue this time.
---
No you just ignore real facts like [logs](https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/Default.aspx) and spreadsheet math that people have presented you here in this thread and only believe the facts you read somewhere on the internet that support your night elf dagger rogue argument. 
---
Dont even know what to tell you. You do you.
---
&gt;Top tier unironic self-own post
---
Top-notch self-awareness.
---
I once made an alt on a PvE server, as soon as I saw a Gnome that I could not kill in Stonetalon Mountains I deleted the character and went back to Frostmane.
---
I like fair fights. Fuck me, right?
---
Essentially what sharding/phasing could look like. You're runnin' around pushin' daisies and suddenly a  whole group materializes in front of you.
---
#SayNoToSharting
---
That would be awesome, if they didn't fuck it up!
---
But they probably would fuck it up...
---
That's actually genius.
---
Well, most of the slots are for furies, not tanks.
---
I agree the sample size is big enough, but you're absolutely going to face selection bias here. Since we can't measure the bias it's up to gut feeling, but my gut feeling says the bias is large enough to invalidate the results. And I say this as someone who performed a similar analysis like 6 months ago.
---
i just dont think anyone was trying to do anything but fuck around with their buddies in wpvp man. it's not something to take so seriously as to make a call on how brave someone is when these ppl just recreated the &lt;and 5 stealthed rogues&gt; meme
---
shenanigans happen in wpvp, it's not always gonna be fair. that's what makes for fun moments like this. im sure these dudes received shit as much as they give it
---
Damn alliance and their tram...
---
I only joined in TBC but you make it sound terrible. I had a lot of fun. Lets see how Vanilla pans out...
---
They announced a new album for 2019 and they start their tour in May. First in the US, then they come to europe. It was a long wait ...but finally we get some new tool material :) 
---
There's just a release date missing .... Same as classic
---
Just buy a cheap VPN with a browser extension. 
---
If chrome is available on your workstation, you're golden. 
---
Regardless of reddit, it's a good idea in principle to use a vpn for any private matter in the workplace.
---
It‚Äôs bench time.
---
Shamans can kill you, but you could kill them too, just takes abit to get them oom.
---
But you will never kill a competent Paladin, and a Paladin will never kill a competent druid.
---
Hey you might be right, I'm not saying you're not. Maybe I should have done more research into actual spreadsheets and numbers before posting, that's my bad, maybe I put too much trust into hearsay. I'm at work tho so my browser won't let me open that link of yours. I'll check on when I get home.
---
I would say go for it, it may make you feel like you're playing an all-new game. however, if you're anything like me the and like getting into the game on a spiritual (lol really cant find the right word) level then it may turn you off being a "shiny little bitch." They do got some cool cities tho like ironforge but I feel like most ally players have too many sticks up their asses and can't cut loose.
---
If what you say is right. Guilds will specifically search for Dwarfs, which would be really easy for OP to find somewhat a decent guild.
---
Found the level 60 that hangs out in STM.
---
congratulations on joining the superior master race
---
but beware of the jealous minor animal races, who dont know their place
---
Or we could play classic... y'know the actual game we begged for years.
---
Do your care about looks or background at all? Stealth is so strong in vanilla, you can get a cat so you both have stealth. Yes, stoneform is good to get out of things, but with shadowmeld you get to use your imagination and have fun with it. Also, while jump kiting you do some sweet flips as NE.
---
Well ya. But there will be the inevitable "what comes next". Was just a thought.
---
LOL, yeah I always like knights and such, but Horde pulled me in on retail. Maybe it's the Marine in me, we would be the Horde lol
---
I think part of WoW's unique music comes from its development during WC3 as well. This would mean that soundtracks for WoW would have been created during most of WC3s lifespan so tracks from WC3 could be re-used in WoW thematically. I think the music team then later decided to re-use (remaster/rebuild/base off of) these tracks to keep to the themes of the Warcraft universe and later decided to go about using some iconic sequences from older Warcraft games too.
---
Couple of examples:
---
- The molten core theme (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6QLgK92TrQ) comes from the same music used in the ending of the original Warcraft 3 trailer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOdTeT1xUQQ).
---
- The "Alliance Landfall" theme in Mists of Pandaria is a rehash of the same theme used at the end in the Warcraft 3 intro around 2:40 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2vm-QjK2xQ).
---
- The opening music in the Warcraft 3 intro (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2vm-QjK2xQ) is also the same theme used in the opening intro for Legion around 40 second mark (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6CWue7voA0)
---
- The Legion reveal cinematic has the first 11 seconds (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYNCCu0y-Is) based off the Warcraft 2 orc theme around the 2:00 minute mark (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uDM8GJa53c&amp;list=PLDF3F6631BCD6EA6E&amp;index=1).
---
- Even harder to hear, the Alliance Arathi warfront music when played on 1.75x speed from 39-50 seconds (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVoc0PunrMk&amp;t=2s) is a callback to WC3's "Call to Arms" at 1:00 minute (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNVomngq-Qc). I guess this is also why it tugs on player's heartstrings and makes them feel like base-building.
---
- The beginning of "Call to Arms" at 0:30 seconds ish is also part of the barrens music at 3:55 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do5s0MQvF9s).
---
- Track 4 (8:26) of the original Warcraft: Orcs and Humans (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxXsbbs0teI) has an opening which is KIND OFFFF similar to the Alliance Warfront opening (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVoc0PunrMk&amp;t=2s). On the surface they sound different, but the way they go about setting up the start of the songs before the 30 second mark has some similarities.
---
Really, the WoW music team has some ridiculously amazing attention to detail. This last one is a bit of an outlier, but The Burning Crusade also credits Chopin because the theme for honor hold uses a sequence from Chopin's Nocturne. Here's Honor Hold, have a listen from 2:45 (https://youtu.be/LSjhKX9cmog) and then compare it to the same sequence from Chopin from the 0:45 second mark (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAcAWWU_0mE).
---
If theres no sharding in contestet zones, this won't happen. For starter areas at the launch, sharding is kind of needed IMO but you usually don't pvp there. They could turn it even off for starting zones after a week or two...it's really no big deal like this
---
&gt;The game is just about to be 15 years old. They've learned what was good for the game, and was was bad for the game
---
Plenty of people would disagree with you there, myself included.
---
Why does there need to be a next? Everything ends eventually so just enjoy the ride, most people won't even clear AQ let alone naxx so there's always content for them to strive for.
---
I played that game so much. Finished NG9+ then put it down before the first xpac came out. Bought ti but never played it lol
---
Started Seikero recently
---
It depends- what are you farming for, how long, etc.  For rep grinding, you can party with a friend to increase speed.  Solo content is slow,  but healers have an easy time finding groups on most servers, and great in BGs (not solo world pvp).
---
I wasn't really doubting it!  I was making a joke about which of those was the joke (if any)
---
You'd disagree that the game is almost 15 years old or that they learned anything? üòÇ
---
I presume it's due to the insane competition expected assuming furies. There's lots of slots for them but being the seventh or so in loot prio turns out you're unlikely to get an upgrade for ages. And the *muh dpzzz* doesn't get too good without them. 
---
On the other hand, the struggle to get a raid tanking slot may draw people away as well. Or, at least, it is my case.
---
That‚Äôs some really fun moment captured in WoW. I thought i‚Äòve seen everything in 14 years but not this.
---
I got a feeling people are up to recreate some fun this time rather than just hop through content. Can‚Äòt wait for Classic!
---
Shadow priest also excellent in raids and there is at least 1-2 in most raids
---
For weapon distribution during progression, it might be worth having at least one 2H warrior Alliance side. This isn't based on experience, so take it with a grain of salt.
---
i look forward to luring you into my 4 smelded buddies in wpvp. my utter lack of HONOR twisting you into a seething orc irl will make it worth the effort
---
6 through 8 is my life
---
haha, that's a good life!
---
It's called daughters of ash and it changes a lot of drops, enemies and names. For example it adds phases  to a bossfight
---
The rewards and gear in general. Like the quests gave a story and the item tied to it. I remember getting this undead guys wife‚Äôs ring back. Apparently he died during the scourge invasion. And his ring was stole by living humans. 
---
Loved the sylvanis quest from ghost lands too. The quests had enough to remember them uniquely even if we know the formula. 
---
These days we know the formula and it shows.
---
Totally agree and this is along the lines I was thinking. So many warriors and rogues will be human further clogging up the already clogged need for 1h swords (viskag, brutality). Picking up an OEB, spinal reaper, zin rokh, bre could be better than sitting on dal rends.
---
forgot to add that if you feel like going a caster DPS in pvp as well then spriest are pretty good they definitely melt faces. But, ele shamans can easily one-shot some people and heal at the same time. I don't think you'll regret going shaman.
---
But that is exactly how it goes. Neither Druids nor Pallies have enough burst to kill eachother. It is a war of attrition basically.
---
I played back then but don't remember him being so tough, what did he do again that made him so deadly?
---
I got the axe and shoulder off him on my pally, good times.
---
Cathedral sm though was a different story, if you didn't pull them outside to the doors they would flee in terror aggroing more shit and you'd have to clear them all because attacking the boss aggrod the entire room.
---
Also, gnomer wipe before the final boss if you body aggrod things in the ditch..
---
Druid has a huge toolset, plus stealth.  Only downside is no out of combat Rez.   Paladin just has that feel though with two bubbles, LoH, it is a lot to get taken down.  Super efficient healing, lots of direct heals.  Druid healer has nothing on paladin in vanilla, but very capable.
---
If you are rolling alliance, it is not hard to find a paladin or two that wants to go there for their quest weapon, though you run the chance they bail the moment they have reached the stables.
---
Yeah I get that, and tbh *maybe* I'll be okay with sharding in starting zones at least up to 10. But after that like you said, it should be fully turned off.
---
Also your nickname sounds exactly like my hometown, lol.
---
I loved the place on my mage, though we did do a few chain runs now that we had gotten all the way up there. The robe/belt are just awesome for any clothie or druid for that matter.
---
2x Ebon hand with SP consumes is pretty beast.
---
I actually find Vanilla easy. :P :) And I really don't mind the leveling.
---
I've even created a guild for Classic, with like minded people so we can enjoy the game to the fullest. No rush.
---
That they have learned anything. If they had learned so much then why would so many yearn for untainted Vanilla?
---
Same here. The quick nerf to heroics (and the old addition of LFD, even if it was still WotLK times) were bad omens for the future.
---
What do you want to do?
---
Interesting stuff. 
---
But since this sub and the players in private servers are much, MUCH more hardcore than rest of the classic population, this data might suggest something that isnt actually going to happen. But im sure the higher end guilds will raid the same way in classic, just that the "what will you play" data might be wayyy off. Or it might be reasonably correct, hard to tell.
---
It can be that those more casuals will not ever be into raiding in the same way as we do and the class balance difference they might cause doesnt really matter, because you are trying to gather the best geared groups and guilds. Other thing to think about is, that the data shows what people are going to play, it didnt (i think) ask if the people were ever going to invest time in raiding, at all. But since it was done here, maybe it is still correct data. Most ppl are going to raid anyways.
---
Class popularity should never be your main reason for playing a class, it will just result in changing classes later...
---
Suggesting warlock, or shadow priest for your pvp angle.  Warlocks probably better
---
It doesn't make me mad, just disappointed.
---
Also: Undead, duh.
---
It‚Äôs great for stealth runs though.
---
Well they can't undo things they already added in live. Talking like group finder and LFR etc. It's a box they can't really unopen. But in a whole new world and timeline, they could simply never add it.
---
Indeed. That's the niche I'm aiming at as a more-than-likely future hunter. Dedication and finesse rule.
---
need this for rogue and hunter
---
do u have text version too btw?
---
Boom kin.
---
They had to because the Horde fears nothing!
---
Because they can be level 30+ and gank people in a level 20-20 zone?
---
Except paladin, I played all Vanilla classes at least until lvl 40 and I agree : rogue 1-20 is the worst.
---
 However it gets better after that, especially after lvl 30 I think.
---
I hope they bring out tbc while keeping classic servers playable and maybe even adding a 2-year league for people who want to play fresh servers
---
Hit us up with them shaman guides my dude, also is shaman worth playing in pvp?
---
You commented on an obvious joke from someone who likes orcs with your killer logic that because it isn't the optimal way to play they should pick a different race.
---
Don't try and weasel your way out of it.
---
Just declare your intentions while still forming the group (before you start). If your healer has a problem with it they can leave the group.
---
&gt; buy a Krol blade
---
this
---
the time spent trying to get a dal rend main hand is better used farming monies for a krol
---
LOKTAR OGAR
---
There has been hundreds of threads on this already you can go read them.
---
Unlikely.
---
Well mostly likely get a server wipe
---
iirc one of the dagger skill items is in DM which wont be available phase1
---
And hopefully whose who want can choose to go on with TBC classic

my first toon was a nelf rogue
---
and that was cuz the guy who showed me wow also had one
---
yeah! I mean c'mon! Maybe the other DPS:ers were bad!
---
oh yeah it was thottbot and it‚Äôs blinding white page.
---
Shadow priests do just fine healing fivemans and in the entry level raids.  There are also 1-2 shadow priests in many raids doing dps.
---
Yes please
---
You would have to be severely retarded to think there will be tokens in classic
---
&gt;"DKP" point system
---
DKP already has 'point' in it.
---
No. Retribution doesnt provide any equally good raid utility that shadow priest does.
---
&gt;Also because I want the Corrupted Ashbringer as my main goal of classic.
---
Ah, way to make my choice even harder.
---
Almost as bad as shadow priest DPS.
---
LOL:D
---
The best wand is from BRD. In the Coffer room after you get all the keys to open all the safes. A box will spawn as well as 4 Golems and a mini boss. In the Box is the [Wand of Eternal Light](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22254/wand-of-eternal-light#contained-in-object).
---
Some of those items won't drop until Phase 2.
---
it wasnt needed at release, it wont be needed now
---
I do hang out in Org though, I like it more than UC
---
Stating it before hand is the way to go. Do you think I'll have trouble finding healers that will accept the loot competition?
---
I watched a guild member bubble into a pack of dragon mobs while the other guild member was clearing to grab it. 
---
Guild leader had a hard time dealing with that drama.
---
SIGN ME THE FUCK UP

https://youtu.be/mczb2LAYrMo original video with exotic sound effects.
---
Depends on supply vs demand. If there's very few tanks available for dungeons you'll have no problem getting a healer, as the alienating would be getting nothing at all. If there's a general lack of healers, you might have some trouble.
---
You should defenetly declare your intentions and it will piss some players off.  
---
You will get alot of decent pieces passivly tho. The real problem are specific items that are harder to get that people farm specificly:  
---
\- Robe of the Exalted
---
\- Rosewine Circle
---
\-Second Wind
---
Which ones?
---
yep, on my blog at silvitesoltis.blogspot.com
---
Is hunter worth leveling? Worried about end game dps in raids. Focused on pvp though. What would you say is best race for hunter is though Horde/alliance?
---
And as for mage, would you go gnome or undead?
---
Is SM/Ruin a good spec for lock for pvp/PVE? That way I don‚Äôt need to respec between the two? Orc BiS as well for lock?
---
I would go ud because of class fantasy + you will beat every other warlock.
---
rogue and hunter coming at some point
---
I suppose if there's a surplus of tanks and a lack of healers I could always heal. But it's usually tanks that are in demand, so hopefully I'll be able to tank for me healing gear.
---
Do you think it's too much to roll on dps leather for pvp purposes at the same time?
---
Pick a druid or a rogue, keep FaPs in your bag and choose your fights, like I am gonna do.
---
I'm definitely not a pro on shamans or PVP, but I'll do my best for a general gearing guide.
---
If you do it without asking about it first? Probably. Especially if you're rolling against the actual healer in your group.
---
But as long as you're open and honest about this, people are usually okay about it. The best way to go about this (in my experience) is to ask the group for Permission first before rolling Need on any "offspec" gear (offspec relative to your current role, even if you're normally something else). Typically, people are okay with it so long as you're not rolling against someone who actually came as the appropriate role.
---
Instant mail is only for the same account. Sending multiple mails at once was in Classic. Just done slower by a shitty Addon. Better if the addon is just removed, then removing the function that currently works.
---
good point. I'll add it to the text version, though it's kind of a pain to do that event, no?
---
I'm not a big PvPer, but I don't like to be embarrassed in open world. I want to play some casual dungeons and raids.
---
The thing is, I would be running the dungeon specifically for that healing item. And the healer would more than likely be there for that same item as well.
---
excuse me, but how often did they say "authentic classic experience"? especially with the good recent updates, there is absolutely no chance whatsoever they will put that in.
---
IMO they have more than proven to be capable of delivering it, and even if you don't think so, it goes without saying and anyone knows that this has nothing to do with vanilla wow.
---
have you watched the [classic wow panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM) from blizzcon 2018? i assume not. please watch it, especially the part from ion makes it more than clear that there is no way of it happening.
---
Fancy seeing a SoA fan in the wild. I'm assuming that's where you got your name? If so, you have good tastes!
---
&gt;No idea if the classic client will allow anything similar.
---
I think this is the stuff that will get removed.
---
Yeah, but since I'll be main healing in raids later, I don't want a passively collected healing set. I will be seeking the same bis items as the rest of the healers.
---
Classic will use the retail client, appropriately modified. This includes the addons/macros. It'll be the modern one, appropriately modified. Blizzard didn't say what exactly will be available.
---
I try man but sometimes it creeps up on you. You think it‚Äôs a fart and... oops ruined your good khakis.
---
Honestly feral dps can be top 5 easily and they have the most fun rotation in the game and its actually skill based, besides rouges who keep up slice and dice and just spam 1 button. People get mad when I say this but it's true. check this video out it just shows the potential of what you can do.

The Razer Trinity is the only one that is still available because they do  not make the Naga anymore (i think)

Best thing about is that you get all the diffrent plates so you can swap them. I use the 7 Button plate
---
Thanks a lot! I know you've put a lot of time into this, really appreciated!!
---
Agree.  I'm giving classic one month of sub and if it's not what I'm looking for I'm bailing.  I'm hoping blizz is listening regarding sharding but I really don't think so
---
Scarlet Monastery is one of the most memorable dungeons in my opinion. That and Wailing Caverns are burned into my memory. I can't wait to do them again.
---
&gt; it wasnt needed at release
---
Really? It wasn't? I wasn't there, but I heard the WoW launch was a fucking shit show. Blizzard prepared for 250.000 players over the first 2 months. They got it in the first week.
---
My friends told me that servers lagged to hell. Players outnumbered mobs basically until level 10. You couldn't realistically complete quests in a reasonable time so most players grinded by tagging every mob in sight and hoping for the best.
---
But sure ... sharding wasn't needed. Blizzard devs would have sacrificed their fucking first borns to the gods if it meant they would get sharding back then. They worked 2 years on an expansion pack and server tech and then the whole fucking thing repeated in Hellfire Penninsular. Just that fucking **everyone** was crammed into one zone. I was there at the time. Took me 2 hours to get to thrallmar. I didn't finish the first batch of Thrallmar quests until like 2 days after launch. And not for not trying.
---
I think the problem is that sharding is in the game for so long that no one remembers what launches without it actually feel.
---
Possibly, never been in that situation.
---
/r/copypasta material
---
Would love to, but it blows that you can't really do damage. I love farming and soloing content. :(
---
If there is a for example a rogue who needs the leather gear for pve then let them have it. If noone needs the gear take it.
---
&gt; not all classes have stuns in Vanilla 
---
Well, grenades and tidal charm can be used by anyone. 
---
And well... warrior (intercept, concussion blow even if it's unlikely in a PvP setting), pally (HoJ, Seal of Justice effect), hunter (improved concussive, intimidation), rogue (CS, KS), priest (blackout effect), mage (impact effect, typical choice for elemental spec) and druid (bash,pounce). Only locks and shamans do not have a stun option embedded into their kit or talents.
---
Hunter. There is nothing that speeds up things as much as Aspect of the Pack. Second is probably Mage, great AoE and portals.
---
These posts should be bannable.
---
So I would roll need on healing gear regardless, and only need dps gear if no one else needs it? That sounds fair.
---
In that case, just declare your intentions before joining or forming the group, or reserve the specific item you're looking for. You'll reduce the pool of potential party members, but that's the price you pay for not healing while looking for healing gear.
---
I know that once I got into the 50s, it became somewhat common on Alliance side to see Ret Pallies joining as DPS, but rolling on Healer gear. Usually, the deal was that they get to roll on healer gear, but they don't get to roll on DPS gear unless nobody else can use it.
---
What the fuck are you talking about. Luna doesnt do ANY of the things OP mentioned. Its just a UI mod that shows debuffs and incoming heals (via healcom).
---
Since it's 1.12 patch, BRE should be in latest patch stage with armor reduction. This literally sets it to be THE most valued 2h in the game, even beyond  MoM from KT with 3stacks BRE.
---
Other than that, go maces if you don't want to compete on swords. Empyrean Demo, Iron foe if you CBA. Alot of talk on 2x ebon hand on private servers with spellP consumes is REALLY good.
---
Or go horde.
---
Otherwise do what you feel, classic should be about having fun.
---
Honestly, you look like you're putting some serious work into this, so I'm going to try and provide some constructive feedback, as you seem like the kind of person who would really appreciate that. Before anyone reads this, if you disagree with anything I say, don't just downvote and move on, explain why I am wrong. If you want good classic content creators, you need to take the time to express what you think good content is.
---
I don't know anything about recording audio, but the first thing I noticed is that you have some minor feedback from your mic constantly playing, might be worth looking into.
---
At times you are speaking, scrolling text on the screen, and changing the background at the exact same time. When you do that, I have a hard time following what you're trying to say. I realize I'm getting confused, pause the video, read what you typed, then have to go back to listen again to what you're saying. You're already relying on your viewers watching an 18 minute video, take the time to express what you want to say clearly. 
---
You seem to be making this guide for casual players, but you're conveying information like they already know everything about the game. This type of guide will be more digestible for the type of person who will be a "hardcore" player, than the type of player you are actually trying to create a guide for. You did a phenomenal job to learn all the relevant data, but you seem to have not given too much thought into how to make this digestible for a new player. 
---
If you're going to invest this much time into making a serious gearing guide for casual players for Classic, make it something a casual player is going to want to come back to constantly. Just make a guide for the best gear available outside of 20 or 40 man raids, that's what a casual player wants. You're making a guide that is going to be outdated once DM drops, and how many casuals do you think are going to reach 60 before DM drops? We don't know the timetable yet, seems a risky bet. 
---
Here is how I think you can make this guide relevant for the entire game, but still feel like you are fulfilling your goal of make it casual friendly. You need to remember that almost every content creator is currently making content for people who are already very familiar with the game. Start tailoring this guide to be more digestible for an absolute beginner, and I think you could be seriously onto something. 
---
Your guide just felt like you were constantly throwing information at me, which is good, but it didn't feel like you were "guiding" me. You were just constantly throwing more information at me. 
---
If your guide is focused on players who have just hit level 60, you shouldn't really be touching on gear at lower levels, unless it is worthwhile for a level 60 character to backtrack in order to get that piece of gear. Start by explaining what to expect. Briefly throw up a handful of cookie cutter basic specs, and touch on why each has their benefits and drawbacks. 
---
Then progress onto briefly explaining what stat priority is important at level 60, and why. Don't over explain, just gently provide the information so a brand new player can start to make their own decisions about gear. 
---
You should then provide a slide for each individual "slot" of available gear. I want a slide that lists all the relevant shoulders available to me outside of raiding. Let's say I notice my shoulders are really bad, and I want better shoulders. I'm not getting the information I want from your video, unless I watch the entire thing, and pay close attention for 18 minutes. I want to be able to click on a timestamp in your description called shoulders, and be given all the relevant information I want about shoulders. This includes all the gear available, how hard each piece is to get (easy medium hard), where it is obtained, what phase it is available, is it BoE, and your ranking of how good each piece of gear is. If you can take the time to display all of this clearly to me on one slide, I can get all the information I need. You then can make timestamps to the relevant part of your guide for each piece of gear.
---
After you do that for each slot of gear, move onto the dungeons. Show a quick map with each boss numbered, and then full name of the boss listed on the side with their respective number, to explain who each boss is and where they are in the dungeon. Then just show a slide with each boss and his relevant loot table. Then do the same for trash drops. repeat for each dungeon.
---
Then do this for reputation
---
Then do this for professions
---
Then do this for world drops
---
Make a guide that people want to share no matter what Phase of classic it currently is. We don't really have any guides that just clearly tell us everything that is available to us. Right now you have a guide that people will only want to watch. Make a guide that people want to USE. If my legs are bad, I wanna hop back onto your guide and understand my options within a minute. If I'm running a dungeon, I want to be able to watch the relevant part of your guide, so I can know what could possibly drop for me while I'm there. If i want to mindlessly farm world drops, I want to know where I can do that. If i want to know what can come from my professions, I should be able to find that. If I wanna know what reps I should grind, I should be able to learn about that. 
---
With your level of passion with research, you've got some serious potential to make guides that EVERYONE will want to share to casual players, which is sorely lacking in the Classic community. Don't limit your guides to such a small period of the game. Provide us with all the information a casual player could need, at any point in the game, and have it orderly and presentable. 
---
Your guide had SO much information, if you put just as much effort into making your guide have clear segments, it would be so much more casual friendly. I am not knowledgeable on specific pieces of gear in vanilla, and your guide made my head spin.
---
Hope this helps, I was bored and figured I'd start rambling.
---
May Activision-Blizzard hear you.
---
wow launch was a shit show because the server architecture sucked back then. it certainly doesnt now, 15 years later. 
---
if you think the servers we are going to be playing on will perform the same as servers from 2004, youve got another thing coming.
---
Sometimes when you're so constipated that you eagerly try to let every single one rip even just a lil', but she ends up a blonde shart. You're still happy that somethin' came out, whether messy or not.
---
That'll do pig. That'll do.

---
Yeah same! That was an awesome one!
---
I do love me some BiS lists, but what I actually will do is gear up as efficiently as possible on the lowest time budget. The sooner I'm ready for raiding the sooner I'll be getting my hands on some really sweet loot. Min/max can come later. As you said it's not necessary to empty your pockets for a few +healing more.
---
From what I remember, mobs within BRD drop a key every so often. Get enough keys to open all the safes which I think it 12???? I can't remember how many. But like I said, once all are open a new box appears with the mobs. In the box contains the wand and the potential for some decent cloth gloves as well.
---
Gearing a resto shaman will be should alot easier than priest due to only mail wearing intellect then competing for cloth gear
---
It essentially depends on the number of Dwarf Priests already in the raid. If you already have enough Dwarves to Fear Ward the entire raid (you only need 2 or 3), then the race of any additional Priests is irrelevant.
---
Both are so cool looking.  By looks alone, it‚Äôs hard.
---
Orcs = Fringe of society bulky looking casters which makes for a pretty epic appearance.
---
Undead = Practical necromancer fantasy that looks great as well.
---
Both have great casting animations and are fun to watch through and through.  Personally, I‚Äôd go Orc just because of the dime a dozen undead casters out there.
---
Corpses stay in place indefinitely as long as they aren‚Äôt resurrected. 
---
Our server had lots of graffiti in the shape of corpses spread out to send cute little messages to the other faction
---
then there is no reason not to tank yourself. and no reason for hotw spec.
---
It's been well over a decade since I played wc2 and this song still gets stuck in my head sometimes.
---
I'm not sure what you mean.
---
If it's red, i'm dead!
---
I'd rather have Classic and afterwards compeletely new WoW 2.
---
Yes, but as others stated, announce your intent of rolling on heal gear before joining the group.
---
Of course.
---
If you really like ret pally I would say go anyway for it and focus on other things besides raiding, if you really want to raid and struggling to find a guild that suits you then perhaps you could play another spec in raids? Just keep in mind that raiding is not everything
---
I'm triggered by the use of "demand and supply" vs the norm "Supply and Demand"
---
Nah gnomes are way more infuriating than female dwarves !
---
Have you ever been killed by a tiny gnome warrior wielding a big ass sword thrice his size ?
---
I can't have mercy for a gnome. They must all die !
---
On the opposite side, I can't stand people hurting taurens (I don't play tauren myself but still). I remember getting mad at a PVP video were a guy owns 2 absolutely clueless druids "LEAVE THE POOR TAURENS ALONE MOTHERFUCKER !!!!!!!!!!"
---
Imagine taking a clip out of a youtube video and not even posting the link to the original or acknowledging the creator
---
"Nothing matters unless you go for realm first" is black and white thinking. Below realm first there are lot of shades of gray until 14 hour MC runs, and long before you are anywhere close to being that bad people are minmaxing in all reasonable departments including specs.
---
FTFY https://youtu.be/mczb2LAYrMo
---
&gt; You need 21 points in BM for the stun. 
---
Improved concussive says hi. Even if it is rng based.
---
Just state your intentions and come to a conclusion with your group. If they let you do that, perfect. If not, come to a compromise. That's a major point of Vanilla - social interactions. 
---
If you constantly get knocked back from groups or have arguments with people then either find a guild/group that will let you do you and roll with them or rethink your needs/wants.
---
Yeah I know, I wrote it to make it clear in case they didn't know what DKP was.
---
There are no glancing blows in ranged attack, so the only thing bow spec gives you is a bit of hit. Nothing insane in my book.
---
When Ashrjethul (whatever this thing is spelled) drops you're going to pass on it because you won't have your +5 bow ? :p
---
Yeah, I'm sure you are in the minority.

Vanilla WoW has come a long way since the days of retail vanilla. Not trusting a single private servers logs makes sense, but there are a plethora of them and all have very similarly looking logs - at Naxx level, Warriors, Rogues and Mages (or rather a mage, because of the way ignite works) rule the damage meters, hunters are pretty bad and mostly there for tranq shots. 
---
It takes some time to get into these raids, though. I wouldn?‚Äòt worry about it, few people are going to see Naxx casually.
---
I guess it depends on how good fade is for deaggro on that fight.  Back in the day when kills were pretty slow a big problem on that fight was being threat capped.  Anyone who could aggro drop (hunters, rogues, etc) had a pretty big advantage over those who couldn't or had bad aggro drops(warlocks/dps warrior).
---
Yeah I got lot of cries when I asked mid-dungeons whether I can roll need of a gear. Around half of the responses were 'No'.
---
Now I just state right away when joining that I will roll on cloth gear. If they don't like it, I just leave pt. Works like a charm, nobody wants to hunt down another tank.
---
Really fun to tame a panther as a night elf hunter and you can both stealth by a road or quest area and pop out and kill people
---
&gt; what if I play Human and still want to genocide all gnomes? 
---
Then deep down you're horde at heart, you haven't discovered your true-self yet.
---
There's still about 2 months to make the right choice, we will all gladly help you kill gnomes. And we have cookies. And scarier rogues !
---
Poor druids. You left them out even if they have no choice other than NE...
---
Oh for a moment I thought it was my old bones arthritis again !
---
Could you stop that please, it kind of hurts :o
---
As I do this myself, there are not a lot of cloth items that are an issue.
---
The once you want are easily collected with specific runs in BRD. 
---
So you get them eventually. 
---
The only item that should be a problem are trinkets and the necklace.
---
But that is an issue every healer will have to deal with.
---
I would suggest getting a priest of your guild as your main healer and you help each other equip. 
---
That is my plan.
---
There are more healers in endgame than tanks. Primarily because:
---
- Nobody likes druids tanking in raids
---
- You take less amount of tanks for a raid per raid size than for 5mans
---
- People do not like randoms tanking, so few casuals go that route
---
As a result, you always have more power on party and loot distribution than a healer.
---
The build I mentioned was primarily for healing but the meta was really different back then. Like on my server, rogues and mages weren't an issue for me but hunters, shamans and druids were. Yet now, it seems like a different ball game.
---
If you want to "dps" properly in PvP go shadow and hope you are the raiding shadow priest for your end game PvE raiding guild. But you can't heal/dps like a druid does because your damage comes from spells. So you either need to pick your fights when it comes to doing dps or healing or just choose one role and go for it. 
---
If you're not really interested in the end game raids and are fine with the occasional raid from pugs and what not, you could definitely get by with just speccing shadow and healing from that. You have a lot more options than you think as a priest.
---
I want to see old projects come back to life, things like Karazhan and the crypts, Mount Hyjal, Uldum and possibly having the belf starter zones (without blood elves ofc). I just wanna see Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor completed.
---
Whether you have fun or not is entirely irrelevant. It's the fact that you are contributing much less than others, but if everyone else contributed same amount as you, then your team would not get anything done. You are getting something done only because others are carrying you.  Being a leech, asshole, freeloader whatever term you prefer. If you have fun doing that that actually makes it worse, not better lol.
---
Reminds my of this video made by the same guys who made Leeroy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI0kTPL7m_g
---
That's a good plan with the guild healer. You would have to do 2x the runs to get each item twice, but with a dedicated tank and healing duo you could fill groups instantly and run them effectively.
---
play with Ah until you reach lvl 60, have a lot of gold. Buy a lot of random stat blues (or even greens) with the best stats.
---
Bam, MC and Ony ready!
---
good effort, but sadly much of this is incorrect as you recommend the use of items that are most likely not available during Phase 1, which you're aiming at. Since they're gating Titanic leggings it is heavily implied that items get released in their 1.12 state but only in the patches they were originally added.
---
This means that stuff like Animated Chain Necklace from strat ud (added in 1.11) or Burial Shawl from scholo (also 1.11) are not available.
---
I disagree with the mentioned +healing over all implications of your video considering the state of phase 1 raids in 1.12 and the recommended use of mooncloth items to fill in obsolete gaps in the gear, but thats probably not the right topic to discuss this.
---
&gt;The extra health is nearly irrelevant because most of your health is coming from +stam gear.
---
Tauren +5% health is only on base stats not including your whole gear ?
---
I had the same pet, Gnomekiller, across all expansions. As a cat, he was always hungry for more gnomes.

---
Why or? Pink pigtails accessories with an axe or two sounds darling.
---
You kite melee and that's it. Frost basically has to polymorph a hunter's pet or resort to just spamming arcane explosion because you don't have enough instant casts. A felhunter you can't even polymorph and he's prone to just resisting your frost nova. A searing totem is gonna give you a ton of fun as well. Those are the big ones, but even just random enemy spell casts will set you back while other specs do not care.
---
Also, cast instant spells? You mean the spells that Elemental has more of (Blast Wave), shorter cooldowns on (Improved Fire Blast) and generally more powerful (Impact/Ignite/Incinerate/Critical Mass)? People seem to forget that in vanilla you did NOT have enough instant casts to be able to run around 24/7, and that issue is all the bigger for Frost which lacks talents to improve their instant casts. In literally half of your supposed strategy of "kite and casts instants" Elemental is superior in.
---
And what do you classify as being outnumbered? A mage can absolutely take on 1v2 or 1v3's depending on skill difference and class matchups. At that point you can't keep 100% control of the fight and have to prioritise damage over control in some areas. An Elemental mage is not only unfazed by the random damage, but even has a powerful secondary instant AoE that applies an undispellable slow. Very big if you're trying to control a fight in which you're outnumbered.
---
This whole idea that "damage pushback is something that can be ignored" is just borne from TBC in which Frost mages got Icy Veins to negate it entirely, as well as more instant tools via Water Elemental ranged freeze/Ice Lance on freeze or frostbite. Again, it's absolutely not a deal breaker, but people really scoff on this weakness far too much.
---
You're also really underestimating further uses of Arcane Missiles besides the no-brainer LoS punishing. If you have improved AM you can just bait out an interrupt against classes that are vulnerable to damage pushback (like Frost mages) and then just AM them. This pretty much prevents them from using cast time spells if they don't want to just straight up lose to you in damage output.
---
When you die and release spirit, your corpse remains on the ground until you ressurect, or talk to the spirit healer. But if the server goes down or resets during this time, any bodies and skeletons will also be cleared and wiped off the map, so long as the servers don't load a snapshot. (Which is common on private servers)
---
My first toon was a NE hunter to get to level 12 in one sitting of the first time I was shown this game by my buddy and when I bought the game it was a dwarf Pali and the dwarf hunter and then a NE rogue to seal the deal
---
This is stupid, even if they expect that number they don't expect it to be sustainable. I don't want 20 dead servers in 10 months
---
And here we see a stupid asshole, blaming every PvP player for what 1 person writes.
---
Here's the dirty secret abiut druid: as a possible tank, healer, and dps you control every group. Lead the group, master loot on, let your group know you're reserving X item and if they have a problem they need to find a new group.
---
Get gear
---
40x NE in AV. All of them shadowmelded at first boss. Horde's won't see it comming.

Thanks for reply!

Yea thats true. I might not never see naxx.

I just remeber i have seen here in /classicwow a screenshot from hunter in actual vanilla naxx doing 800+ Dps. Im not sure if the fight was just better for hunter. Also remeber him saying that he was constantly top 5 dps. Thats why i would like to see more proof about hunter really sucking.
---
I get that hunter wont reach mage,fury,rogue lvl dps. But do they really lose to memespecs like boomkin, retri, elemental?? 
---
Also, i would like know more about elemental shaman pvp, if someone has the knowledge of em.
---
I've always found the distinction between PK (player killing) and PvP quite useful. PK is the indiscriminate killing of other players, whereas PvP is a competition between players. I.e. a fair fight is PvP; killing greens/greys and zerging people is PK.
---
I feel like server queues are a pretty shit alternative to sharding. Why should 1k people sit in a queue waiting when they could just play on a separate shard until they leave the starting zone?
---
Worked customer service in austin for 6 years, even spoke to soda while he was streaming lol. Anyway, its always been a no since day 1 and has always been bannable.
---
Blizzard doesnt usually go after them unless they accidentally stumble upon it (like player A reports player B. Player B has his account opened and its noticed he's using the editor).
---
The extra dodge will lube you up for warrior's overpower.
---
Just a thought
---
#**#NOSHARTING**
---
Holy shit, please never comment on anything ever again.
---
&gt; This is stupid, even if they expect that number they don't expect it to be sustainable. I don't want 20 dead servers in 10 months
---
I am sorry... do you know the subreddit you're in? This is Classic WoW. This is not SWTOR, or W:AoR, or fucking Conan striding up the hills. Vanilla wow opened at 15 and peaked at 8M.
---
You really think 2.5M is *a lot?* Oh my sweet summer child.
---
if the corpse is targetable they havent released spirit(and are spectating their dead body) . if the corpse is not targetable they released spirit. skeleton appears when they resurrect. also i think bodies of people who died then logged staying on the ground is a private server thing as i dont remember seeing that, but i was like 5/6 at the time so i could be wrong, it also seems like evert other pserver ive played has had corpeses everywhere
---
You are naive kid
---
I experienced the Isle of Quel'Danas back in the day, and it was goddamn awesome to have this WPvP everywhere around Dailies zone, but I have to say, Timeless Island in MoP was just better.
---
I experienced the Isle of Quel'Danas back in the day, and it was goddamn awesome to have this WPvP everywhere around Dailies zone, but I have to say, Timeless Island in MoP was just better. Check the vid I posted there.
---
Interesting. I tried really hard to confirm when the Animated Chain Necklace and Burial Shawl were added because I thought the same thing, but found that they were added in patch 1.4. What resource do you use to check when items were added? I'd love to double-check and update as needed.
---
I like the way you think!
---
Just admit you like to look at nelf booty, it's just painful to read an argument about base agility as a "case" for rolling nelf rogue.
---
Ah, although I've already changed my mind about removing the debuff limit during the discussions had under this post, this is definitely one more nail into the coffin. Though it would be fun as balls to see that 40-man Paladin raid burst down bosses :D
---
Queues never got that high
---
Checkmate.
---
Druid for sure, but you have to explain the mage.
---
Priest has no downtime, how can a mage beat that?
---
^_^
---
Ive been thinking the same for rogue
---
the sword fight is way too competitive
---
might as well go daggers if they drop
---
as a bonus its nice to have daggers for pvp
---
so rogue is the best class then?
---
I like perplexity videos but I also like perk (I knew the video as soon as I saw the thumbnail) I went and found a lot of old videos recently while trying to decide between hunter and rogue .... and lock and priest lol
---
I recommend watching Nerf Sap 8 by happyminti if your looking for entertaining vanilla PvP rogue videos outside of roguecraft
---
Presses one button the whole raid to do top dps and calls someone bad. Lol vanilla literally takes no skill if you play a top tier class wym get good? most encounters only last 1-3 mins anyway so what's the point. Sorry, it hurts you so much that someone doesn't and want to make wow their job and try something that is actually engaging to play. You have all those extra buttons but 95% of the time you'll just be pressing one, maybe 3 if you add the deranked version of that same spell and your wand. 
---
But I'm going to call bull shit there is no way you use 40-50 abiltys in a raid, what your pots, and buffs?
---
TBC seemed good at the time, but looking back you can see **A LOT** of the changes that led to WoW becoming what it is now, implemented back then.
---
Mostly flying, the devaluation of the old world, and daily quests.
---
Human. Looks better, is better. Dwarf warrior is just bad.
---
haha well they dont get better tanking gear, so of course it makes sense!
---
To end up like Leo you need more than just some weed.
---
I think you should go male human warrior because I'm going to be a female dwarf warrior and would like to remain as unique as possible. Thank you.
---
You can go 0/30/21.
---
Yep mate, super common practise. 
---
I played a tank Druid on N-Dale quit now as cbf playing will Classic coming in a bit. 
---
I tanked and would ask on item drop for Off Spec but only if the primary healer didn‚Äôt need/want it. 
---
Warriors do the same thing for their dps pieces. 
---
Just be super clear so that no one‚Äôs confused as that‚Äôs how misunderstandings happen. üëç
---
I didn't mention druid because they don't have a choice, but for the other classes, excluding hunter (it's 50/50), there's better options.
---
Hi, /u/vosperjr
---
let the dead rest in peace smh
---
- Lightning bolt ( projectile )
---
- Chain Lightning ( cast during projectile )
---
- Frost shock ( instand no projectile )
---
All these 3 abilities will land at the same time if cast from 39yd.
---
That hurts.
---
You won‚Äôt see it, don‚Äôt stress.
---
4:58 boom, got the troll
---
I'd like to focus solely on low/midlevel worldpvp (no bgs). I was thinking about rolling NE priest and stationing myself in Ashenvale. However I'm afraid I'll get eaten up by rogues and hunters. How well can priest 1v1 these classes at level 29?
---
&gt; Through vanilla the time for you to exit combat has been varying a lot. 
---
Gummy wrote something about this when coding that TBC server, and according to those guys its the correct behavior. As an example, the time to leave combat is randomized between 4-6 seconds or something like that, meaning its *possible* to restealth within a gouge. They were discussing this for hours due when testing rogue duels on that server.
---
Draw more things please! :)
---
I mained elemental shaman only from TBC till BFA. Never did an other class looked intresting to me. I never wanted to learn something new.
---
In classic.. I want to play everything.
---
Well I, for mylself, probably would be even fine with sharding in all uncontestet zones (which is even up to lvl 20 e.g. westfall, barrens) if it really only! lasts for like a week. In all pvp zones sharding is a no-go, but I guess best would be sharding for 1-10 areas only at the start.  
---
haha yeah but I don't really use this nick anymore anywhere since I learned that and everyone asking me if I'm Bulgarian ;)
---
I love this reply.
---
Cloth turn-ins from revered to exalted is 270 stacks of runecloth.
---
Look the AH for the price and you will soo how much it will cost.
---
Mankrik's wife should be moved to a new location every hour. That means if you haven't found it before the strike of the hour, it is moved and you have to start over. I mean a new location anywhere in Azeroth btw. Including Alliance cities/towns.
---
I don't think blizzard is actively taking a stance against this and going out of their way to ban people who do it, it's just that it triggers an autoban from Warden and they don't care enough to rework it to ignore in some way. 
---
So use model editors at your own risk, if you get banned by bot detection you won't be unbanned.
---
You're definitely right about grenades, but I think you overdo the rest. Rogues are the real deal when it comes to stuns, Warriors use constantly intercept and charge, and Paladins do the same with HoJ. For the rest it's purely situational. 
---
**Tidal** is an absolute pain to get with normal respawn rates, not many people will have it. **Hunters** with Intimidation are rare at max level, because it's deep into BM, which is not a good raiding nor PvP spec, and CShot improved has 20% proc chance on a shot that you'll use at most 2 times a fight due to its CD. **SPriests** aren't common either and Blackout has a fairly low proc chance too, unless you're fighting a Troll SPriest (then you don't have hardiness anyway). 
---
**Mages** are specced deep into Frost during MC/BWL so Impact shouldn't be common either, not to mention the low proc chance. **Druids** are rare, Pouncing Druids are even more rare as everybody wants to see big numbers with Ravage. Bash eventually could add Druids on the first list, but it's 1 min CD, and since it's physical (not like HoJ) can be parried, missed, dodged, and doesn't land all that often in the end.
---
I mean the only stuns you'll see regularly if you're PvPing are coming from Wars, Rogues and Palas. The rest is either grenades, or pretty much bad luck.
---
You forgot the "IDK", it's a vital part of that meme.
---
That would be glorious.
---
The rules in the EULA are clear, and everyone playing the game agreed to them, so no one who lost his account over this has any right to complain.
---
"They didn't care about it yesterday" is not an argument. You might as well complain that police didn't catch you speeding on the freeway for the last 2 years even though you did it every day. Just because you're not caught, or not important enough do be dealt with asap, doesn't mean what you are doing is okay.
---
I really cannot comprehend people who are this selfish. "Other people are doing the work so I am allowed to slack because we will still get it done". Completely ignoring the fact that if you are allowed to slack, then of course everyone must be allowed to slack the same amount. But others are below you and you are special so only you are allowed to get carried? JFC. 
---
So you are still looking at 4x lower performance.
---
Let's get started.
---
#**#**
---
If you're running pugs then I guess no-one can really say anything if you state it at the start of the group formation. Just say..."I'm doing this as I want to get tanking gear and healing gear as I will raid as a healer". That way you are up front about it. 
---
ALso, may be better and easier to run instances with guildies, as you can go faster as you're prob on group voice chat (be that skype/discord etc). So you can probably do an instance quicker and maybe fit in 2 in the time it'd take you to form a pug and run one.
---
It's meme-level compared to the superstrong racials of human, gnome and dwarf.
---
Most hunters are so bad though. Very high skillcap class, so it's easy to distinguish yourself if you put in the effort.
---
my guilds spriest in bwl had about 8th-12th spot in dps by average
---
yeah we survived that, doesn't mean it wouldn't have been nice to have. What bothers you so much about sharding in 1-10 zones for like a week? without you won't be able to do any quest or probably any mob at all in a reasonable time at launch. Do you like others struggling to finish quests? It's not only for server performance so we dont crash, but 1k starters for 10 mobs (y I'm mb over-exaggerating) isn't fun and not needed.
---
Guard #134121: _"Good morning Highlord."_  
---
Bolivar: _Good morning Guards...**WHAT THE F IS THAT DOING IN THE THRONEROOM??!?**_
---
You *wash* your teeth? Surely you mean to say brush. Who says "wash my teeth"?
---
I think its fine, instead of 8 warriors and 5 rogues waiting for Viskagh/CTS and Maladath. Eventually you kill C'Thun and giving Death's Sting to a rogue with Dal'Rends.
---
I'm most likely rolling female dwarf paladin. And for a reason:
---
Back in vanilla, when BWL came out, I was on the PTR just for looking at all the awesome new Tiersets, and Paladins where Dwarf females with that dragon shield and Lok'amir if I'm not mistaken..
---
that just looked so cool, and I still remember it. So female dwarf paladin it is for me :)
---
I wouldn't say well, Priests for PvP need shadowform - unless you plan to heal. But world PvP at that level would be pretty solo no?
---
Thanks, I didn't know that it resets during WM.
---
moar like oomkin
---
My raid let me stay ret one time because we had too many healers, and we were in farm mode.  
---
My DPS was.... disappointing to say the least.
---
&gt; However, I'm all about that dagger life, and if you believe, as I do, that daggers can keep up with swords, then it's not factually worse.
---
Remember that raiding is more than nuking down Fankriss and scoring a parse. You will be miles and miles behind on total damage due to CD's of combat, timed blade fury's and clunky positioning requirements of daggers. 
---
So no, it can't keep up on average, but you will be able to compete every now and then on a boss-to-boss basis.
---
The problem is, Blizzard by now only knows one way to get new content into the game: Dangling Loot rewards in front of players noses.
---
They are so attuned to building content for a generation of "gamers" with constant need for positive reinforcement, whos low attention spans can only be held by providing and endless stream of instant gratification, that they have become incapable of building content with this crud.
---
And if tha's what would happen, then I rather prefer stale servers, over ruined ones.
---
Rinse and Repeat
---
Looks like it's still in early stages and people don't even know what they're being banned for yet. But yeah, mess with game files, get banned. Stupid games stupid prizes etc. It's irrelevant why you're messing with game files, it's not Blizzard's job to work out how immoral the reason is that you're messing with game files on a multiplayer game hosted on their server.
---
but we don't know if those will be available or not. I don't recall their being any prior to BWL or so. 
---
So they might not even exist until phase 3 (and not every class had one until nearly Naxx..though I could see them just adding all of them at once just to be fair so every class has one to do. But I'm pretty sure the first Level 50 class quests didn't roll out until around 1.6 MAYBE 1-2 in 1.5).
---
While they have said they aren't progressive itemization ,they have confirmed doing some quest progression, though we don't know how wide spread it'll be.
---
Though given that a lot of new quests add REALLY good stuff, that is likely the stuff they'll hold back till a more appropriate phase.
---
Merry Christmas ya filthy animals!
---
Your data isn't entirely correct. 
---
You look at druids for an example and assume that everyone is going to play resto?
---
And that every raid is going to demand resto?
---
What about the people who want to play bear or cat or moonkin. 
---
If you are a moonkin, you finding a spot and the raids looking for you, is going to be different. Than raids looking for resto Druids and the amount of resto players. 
---
I had the same conclusion as you, but than I clicked on showing healers only for horde. 
---
Majority wants to play feral. 
---
The same can be said for tanks vs fury warriors. You will want only 2 of the warriors to be tanks. Looking for a raid is going to be different for a prot and a fury. 
---
You know what I'm saying?
---
What you do mention is that Human gets swordskill increase and NE do not.  What you do neglect tho is the power of weapon skill.
---
Since weapon skill increases both your hit and decreases glancing. When the hit occur and it happens to be a glancing, your wep skill determines how much of a damage loss you gain on the glancing. Its always 40% chance to hit a glancing hit.
---
Since the only facts so far on wep skill cap is mostly from websites where comments say 310 at classic, we dont have much to go on. Since 310 wep skill give you 100% dmg on glancing with 0 dmg loss, wep skill Will be brutal. A rogues whites is pretty much 50% of your total damage.
---
In case you plan on go dagger, you can go NE, since MC gloves give dagger, and also muggers belt from DM:N. Otherwise Human is far superior cause of wep skill. 
---
On private servers its 315 wep skill cap, but you usually just go for 310 anyways since you get 95% dmg increase glancings, and wep skill is alot more damage than a small portion of agility you gain thru levels.
---
But this is min/max, and if you don't plan on going that, go NE anyways you should. Better to be happy and like your choices rather than feel sorry to have chosen the wrong race later in game.
---
Im also thinking tauren shaman. Elemental pvp. Resto at first to gather my gear from dungeons. Leveling true orgrimmar rep quests. Going for the wolf. Leveling with skinning and mining. Drop mining later for leatherworking. Save all the leather I need. Level leatherworking. Might farm whelps for the pets to fill the exp...
---
Or I just stick to my mage. Where I already planned everything out in more detail.
---
Thinking about what to do next if what kept me from going to school. Or kept me occupied while at school. Its the thinking and talking about the game that keeps it alive even when not playing.
---
Take your time to find your path.
---
This might be a bit controversial: I really enjoyed the first month in BfA, WPvP-wise. Had some great moments, everything from 1v1s to smaller raid groups. Probably wouldnt call it my best time, but I had a lot of fun...
---
Great answer thank you.
---
I'm still on the fence here - work friends say Dwarf females look bad, I say the latter! however I do love human mounts &amp; considering the extra TPS is a real thing.
---
Saying that I do remember just about every end game tank who was Dwarf female back in Vanilla - I cant say I can say the same thing for human males as there a dime a dozen on every class!
---
This is probably the hardest decision I've had to make all year, &amp; I've recently purchased property!
---
I'd rather take a 10 minute tea break and be back where I was, than pay for repairs and abandon my goals.  
---
That said, I played a paladin in vanilla, so I would just bubble-hearth &lt;\_&lt;
---
If you want I can share my list for hunter. I choose items that either are quest rewards or are not too contested by rogues or fury warriors.
---
Except for the cape. I didn't find any cape that would be somewhat close to the baron's cape.
---
&gt;you get to look good
---
I had a NE rogue alt in vanilla and looking back now i dunno wtf i was thinking, a 7feet tall stealthy ass doesnt feel stealthy at all lol
---
He looked cool with my double skullforge reavers but with daggers it was like seing the Mountain from GoT use butter knives as weapons :P
---
I guess if you want to try an avoidance tank rogue NE is the best cuz of the 1% dodge but otherwise i dunno.
---
&lt;Dragonmarch&gt; on Silvermoon Alliance
---
Same. Just waiting for friend to pick his class. He's choosing between Priest healer or Warlock. If he goes priest I pick Warrior, if he go warlock I pick Rogue.
---
I dare you mother...
---
Now.. we can finally play the game
---
Yeah the pvp mounts are amazing.  
---
I rode the black war wolf for 11 years straight lol
---
&gt; Queues never got that high
---
Highest queue I personally had was over 2700 during the TBC launch. Wait time was calculated to over 3 hours.
---
Wasn't even one of the larger EU servers.
---
Nice, we've evolved greatly since then and are capable of tanking up t'ill AQ and a bit of Naxx.
---
I don't normally get nice comments like this so it was a really nice thing to read when I woke up üòç
---
We've only heard that they're toning down how much automation you can macro into the api.
---
We won't know 100% for sure until the Open Beta. Maybe the closed Beta if they aren't under a NDA.
---
You can stack 5 charges without forced crits as far as i know. It was fixed after kazzak solo paladin kill. It will expire when you get no new stack in time, as far as i know. Correct me if i‚Äòm wrong
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIVTT4fgPQI
---
Still eagerly awaiting a reply outside of that useful website that was linked just for curiousity sake and help my new list I'm making
---
All that data doesnt tell you few things. How many of those "i will play shaman" actually makes to L60. That they will actively gear prebis. That they will raid on very high attendance. And that they will KEEP on raiding for a long time.
---
Because for a guild those are shamans they are interested. They dont give a flying fuck about "i will play shaman" stats. On E-private server i raided on horde and we CONSTANTLY had problems with shamans. They just flat out quit at least the same rate as we replaced the previous one. We never had the number of shamans we would have wanted in a raid (6-8). Usually we had like 3-4.
---
The suggestion to use mooncloth as a gap-filler baffles me. You pay an exorbitant price - 17g per mooncloth according to some PS - for a measly +5 int, -1 spirit and an irrelevant amount of sta. I would rather wear the runecloth item or use a random questing green or scour the AH for a cheap filler.
---
Probably in literal meaning too. This question is asked every single day.
---
The "OSRS path" mention is the icing on the cake.
---
Prolly not the best to ask for that on reddit ...
---
But since I am bored:
---
Level Ret: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sE0zZVuZVfctbcqo
---
Pretty much the dps build besides Vindication instead of imp bom (leveling u will use wisdom). Just go straight ret and fill everything else after. Dont think its worht to go holy/prot first and then ret.
---
Reckret leveling: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sZVGx0I0xZVfctbco
---
Go ret first to get SoC, then prot for rek, later on ret again. Be Aware though, sitting to get rek procs wont work in classic as it is a private Server Thing.
---
Holy Level: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sEVubgotVGzZV
---
Play it with shield/1h, most damage from Auto hits + SoR. Can do Group pulls aswell and easily tank stuff. Free heal every 2 min is awesome.
---
Prot Level: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVVzZVGxI0zEoVb
---
Go holy first for consecration. Big pulls easily doable when you get sanctuary aswell. Rek/block will proc quite heavily and will provide you with extra hits for SoL/SoW.
---
Conitnueing with the rest ...
---
yeah that was my plan. I mained ally during Vanilla so I'm thinking of maining horde this time.
---
This is really the last time your faction had the most impact on how the game played. TBC hadn't completely removed it yet but it was toned down a lot due to both sides having all classes, but by Wrath, it was pretty much the same game no matter your side.
---
Very true. I started Vanilla when I was 10 years old, so not for me. But my dad played it too back then. He was around 35 at that time and loved the game as much as me. He rolled Dwarf hunter and was deeply involved in the game as much as me. After Wotlk he stopped playing. And now I'm almost 24 years old and told him they are releasing classic servers, and he told me to notify him when it releases so he can join too. Because he also thought classic was best by far.
---
Atm, on private servers theres so fucking many healers, that this isnt true anymore. Maybe classic will be different, but i doubt it. Those vanilla days when a healer was in high demand are gone. Now you are the easiest party member to get with melee dps (in instances where anything useful for a healer drops).
---
Sure, you can fucking do UBRS until your fingers bleed as a healer...
---
&gt;"They didn't care about it yesterday" is not an argument
---
It is an argument. Arbitrarily enforced rules are not something you should be defending. That's some third-wordl shit. 
---
Regardless, we now know that they *are* going to arbitrarily enforce this rule. Spread the word to your fellows who might have plans to do this.
---
Well, you'll be one of 3 female dwarf warriors on the server so you have that going for you.
---
&gt; wow launch was a shit show because the server architecture sucked back then. it certainly doesnt now, 15 years later. 
---
You guys talking about the Blizz backend is funny. Half of the reason for sharding isn't even backend stuff but gameplay reasons. If no one can complete quests because mobs are instantly tagged from you, that's a gameplay problem.
---
Sure, current realms can probably hold more players per zone than back in the day. But outside of huge events like the AQ gate or the Scourge Invasion, having 1000+ players in a zone isn't something that works out well for gameplay, even if network latency and framerate would allow.
---
&gt; Server queues were a thing back then too, which would certainly be a fine thing to have again in order to avoid shittysharding
---
You do understand that sharding and login queues are not really linked all that firmly, yes? Both happen during peak play time on high population servers. But that's about it.
---
You can have sharding **and still** have queues. You can have no sharding and now queues and still have very overopopulated starting zones.
---
Saying you don't mind queues if that means no sharding is like saying you don't mind brainfreeze while taking an ice bath. Both have to do with cold, sure. Still doesn't make sense.
---
And running away while jumping...
---
Yep dude I remember this. I was working about an hour and a half from Moree in NSW. I was using dialup to play wow then got super excited for ISDN with a whopping 128kb/sec. After that was 3G. The game was finally playable at sub 500ms and I could download patches with ease (and expense) at the start of wrath. 
---
What a fucking mess our telecommunications networks were in and still kinda are in.
---
That talent build is very... not good.
---
Why are you using ghostly strike with daggers? Why are you using premed? Why are you skipping ruthlessness and relentless strikes? WHY ARE YOU USING HEMO WITH DAGGERS?
---
 I'm not really interested of any of these days games , but i have to find something to play , cause my life is hard without gaming :)
---
You take the gnomes, I'm going after the elves.
---
I heard somewhere that p-servers are bugged when it comes to player skeleton spawns and leaves them there for an unVanilla amount of time.
---
Where dagger outshine a sword rogue, it should in most cases be about skills of the Rogues.
---
Why is that dagger Rogues have less things to take in count of in swing-times that sword Rogues have. Since sword Rogues have 5% to proc an extra swing this should outshine in the dmg against a dagger rogue if equal gear and skills. There is a calculation about how much "haste" and dmg you earn, but to long for Reddit.
---
Its more of why sword is better when min/max for example extra SS dmg by 6% and energy ticks and cost by 40/60.
---
Class diversity is much more important than race diversity to be fair.
---
pve have more tank warriors  but fewer dps wars
---
pvp is the opposite
---
&gt;If you are talking about the current PVP private server
---
what does that even mean
---
there is more than one
---
Absolutely. That'd help a lot! Especially since I don't really know much about hunters. It could be a great reference. :)
---
&gt;Gnome gets Escape Artist, and being a small target is a nice little passive bonus.
---
*presses tab*
---
&gt; Your analysis is based on census data from a small particular demographic 8+ months before the game is released.
---
do you have better data?
---
Boomkin beg to differ :D
---
SEASONAL SERVERS!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
&gt; Just like president polls study.
---
The same one that predicted a landslide victory for Hillary Clinton ? :D
---
The whole point of using target dummies to measure DPS would be, in this case, that they do not have armor or resistances or extra debuffs. You could use them to measure the actual DPS output of a class in a vacuum. Now if we see that in a vacuum eg. a Warlock will completely outclass all other classes, then we definitely have a problem. If, on the other hand, eg. Mages still outclass Warlocks, then allowing all Warlock DoTs on bosses would still not out DPS Mages, except for movement heavy bosses where Mages cannot keep casting much. (This is okay, I believe. A DoT heavy class should be allowed to be better than a stationary class in a very mobility heavy boss fight.)
---
Good to hear that at least some of these items are used in high tier PvP. That lends credence to your argument, which I totally agree with, that they would be used in high tier PvE as well. Personally, I think I'll be looking out to eg. Gifts of Arthas in my Classic leveling. I'm expecting they'll be quite cheap since they seem to have little high tier usage, so it wouldn't maybe be too much of a waste to use such consumables in solo play.
---
\&gt; ?????
---
What I meant by my admittedly very poorly worded question is the following:
---
You say that complete classes would become unplayable because they do not have DoTs to "linearly multiply their damage" and that allowing all of those DoTs on bosses would "ruin every single player experience." In Classic there are already classes with DoTs and classes without DoTs. If DoTs were the deciding factor in whether or not a class' DPS output scales well with gear, or (going even further) if they decided whether or not a class is on top of the DPS meters, we would expect to see Warlocks be the best class hands down. And, admittedly, scaling wise they do get the best (or very nearly best) bang out of their gear upgrades, yet they still do not top the DPS meters. (If this is only because of the debuff limit or because of Mages and Warriors simply doing better DPS would need to be determined using the target dummy vacuum method mentioned earlier.) So it does not seem like DoTs make or break classes.
---
Furthermore, one could approximate DoT skills as skills that do all of their damage in one go and then just have a cooldown. Then you could calculate their effect on a normal skill rotation and weight their damage effectiveness against the time it takes to cast them (usually just global cooldown). Thinking of them this way, basic DoT skills like Curse of Agony, Rend, and Rupture become simply alternate attacks that you use on cooldown if they improve your rotation's DPS. They're not a multiplier on your damage. Proccable DoTs like Deep Wounds and Ignite though, yeah, those are just straight up multipliers on your damage... :)
---
\&gt;  ruin every single players experience.
---
Unless you're referring to the added burden of farming even more consumables, I have no idea how debuff limit removal would ruin every single player experience. So let us go with the interpretation that you refer to the added burden of farming even more consumables. I admit, I had not at all thought about such consumables like Gift of Arthas etc. These completely ruin the game, indeed. Not every single player experience still, since not everyone will do the grinding, but boss fights would likely get trivialized etc. It would be horrible.
---
To kind of put a period on my position here: I did not think about the debuff limit beyond allowing player DoTs on bosses and as such my thoughts on the change were way too optimistic. Thus I ended up arguing for a change that would cause way too many changes to be required, leading to a complete redesign of Vanilla WoW. After the discussions under this post with a lot of commenters I have come to change my view and no longer think that the debuff limit should be lifted. I do still hold the opinion that WoW might've been better if it had been planned and designed from the get-go without a debuff limit but that is neither here nor there, since my opinions cannot change design choices made likely 16-18 years ago. (I have high opinion of the power of my opinions but I've not yet witnessed them to change the fabric of reality. I'm sure it will happen any day now...)
---
Now to go on the offensive a bit before I post this wall of text:
---
\&gt;  sorry if I'm being rude
---
Yes, indeed. You've been quite rude in your interactions, and I hope you will look at your words and actions and reconsider how you approach discussions with people holding different opinions to your own, especially when it comes to Classic. I get the feeling that Classic WoW is very important to you and that is fine. I just hope you wouldn't let this love of yours make you attack and try to put down other Classic enthusiasts who might not have the same level of experience as you do. Indeed it might be that those other people do not understand how deeply their suggestions' consequences might run, but effectively telling them to GTFO and SU will only cause bad blood in the community.
---
(To show that I am also reflecting on my own words I find that I've been quite adamant in my opinion that your examples of harmful effects the change would cause would be negligible. That probably is not the case and I should've seen that faster.)
---
\&gt;  If you just wanna argue about stuff without knowing anything about it I hear Twitters great for that. Your entire argument is ‚ÄúI know nothing but I can‚Äôt be that wrong‚Äù. Not responding after this because it‚Äôs not helping anyone. Glhf
---
You might've missed it (partially because I was so adamant in my opinion) but my aim here has been to discuss my proposal / argument for the removal of the debuff limit. Again, I understand that Classic is important to you and because of that you might feel personally attacked when I proposed changes to that which is most important to you. That was not at all my aim, I truly wanted to not argue but discuss, have a dialogue, and see if my proposal has merit or if it is founded on a lack of understanding and experience. The latter turned out to be true and I am now happy to admit that I was wrong in my argument for the removal of the debuff limit.
---
Now I may not know a lot, I was very young and stupid when I was playing in Vanilla, I've not played on private servers, and I have not played retail for a long while either. I still know something, and I can be, and was, very wrong. So I am quite confused by your strawman-like portrayal of my original argument. Besides, at least to me this discussion has been very helpful. It helped me to change my mind after all!
---
Anyway, if you're not answering anymore then go with Classic, you horrible bastard. You've been an okay conversation partner and I hope you the best, especially with regards to future improvements in your attitude to people who propose something that you oppose.
---
Thanks, now I'm torn between rolling a warlock (as I planned) or a mage... tough choices!
---
That's going on the assumption that you're crafting it yourself, not buying mats from the AH, but gathering them.
---
But yeah, I get what you're saying and would probably just hold out for drops myself. I just figured for people that can't wait it could provide a decent alternative.
---
Sooo, let me get this straight: you're only moving with strafing (Q &amp; E) and your mouse?
---
haha my favourite activity from back then - #TeamShadowmeld
---
All that defense of Ashenvale actions
---
Hi thank for the charts. Can you explain the meaning of "pvp raid pvp exp" and the other ones please ?
---
hmm, so how do you get out of that cathedral?
---
This is beautiful.
---
Personally I'd prefer something in between. I hate the sterile arena setting, but the idea of removing extremely powerful (and expensive!) consumables from PvP is good. The fun and quirky items that everyone can reasonably gain access to should stay.
---
The idea of separating power from prestige wasn't bad, either. It sucks that for certain classes certain gear is mandatory (e.g. druid PvP set bonus and the special maces with FAP) while being out of reach for people with a life outside of WoW. I don't mind not getting the rank 14 title again (now that I *do* have a life outside of WoW), or not having flaming shoulder armor, but I do mind being stuck in blue gear for the entire lifespan of the server.
---
‚ÄûBut since I am bored‚Äú Thats the spirit! True Paladin!
---
Thanks, great start. Appreciated.
---
Running away while somersaulting*!
---
If you are even allowed to cast it. If guild seriously min-maxes debuff slots SWP gets pushed out.
---
i use dishwashing liquid. it works for dishes means it works for teeth right?
---
#science
---
Give Nightfall to a non human warrior.
---
I think classic wont be anywhere near as casual as it was back then
---
since that we got a lot more info available about how to play the game
---
they werent simply casual back then, it was more a lack of better knowledge.
---
almost every stat on private servers is just guesswork
---
no it won't be exploitable, blizzard already dealt with that during vanilla
---
and the gm officers are typically tanks
---
Don't do this. As a marine would you enlist in the Talibans ? Same thing really :D
---
Theoretically it could become a problem if you're playing premade 15v15 and the enemy group decides to flask up. I'm not entirely sure how much of a difference it would make, or how much they'd need to farm before every PvP night. Could there be a meta where fights are decided by how much PvE you're willing to do in advance to farm temporary buffs?
---
One classic PvP spec for hunter is Scatter/INTIMIDATION even if MM/SV variants are more common. 
---
For mages yeah, that's why I stated mostly elemental spec. Even if it's a niche, later on (i.e. when geared) it gets quite better than frost PvP-wise. 
---
Priests are not restricted to spriests only. Tri-specs usually get it as well. 
---
And druids...  can't say it much for vanilla (TBC was so great for ravage opening... with proper feral gear) but given how many praise the HotW build (which barely builds physical stats) *big* base damage ravage hits might do early in progression, but with most gear focused on stam/int/+dmg/+heal I assumed them losing prio to extra control and bleed. Specially with the overall lack of follow-up burst.
---
Funny thing is my IRL friend started playing classic on a blizzlike pserver and reached 60 and did Naxx. And it feels like he knows more than me sometimes. I was just a 10 year old kid when playing classic in 2005.
---
This is not a personal attack, seriously, but for me wPvP is not meant to be fair. I love the feeling of danger when leveling in STV. I don't care if it's 5v1, there is no honor in wPvP, only survival.
---
Nah original DM is better than SFK imo
---
I'll readily admit that some boss fights would definitely become easier, at the very least somewhat. Onyxia stage 2 would be a good example, though even there I guess a lot of the DPS does actually come from just ranged skills and attacks from ranged DPS classes. It would be interesting to try and calculate how much quicker the phase 2 could be done if all DoTs could be up at the same time.
---
And I am sorry that you're baffled. Not everyone looking forward to Classic has played on private servers or done deep analysis into the effects of the debuff limit. (My original argument came from doing shallow analysis into how the debuff limit affects especially Warlocks in raids and the number of Warlocks that you can take into a raid before the debuff limit becomes an unbearable hard limit on their usability.)
---
Just so you know that I am not still trying to argue my position: From the knowledge gained in discussions under this post, I've changed my mind and no longer think that the debuff limit should be removed. Also for your information, I think starting with a put-down based on my presumed lack of knowledge is a bit rude. Have an upvote.
---
You‚Äôre garbage at the game if you think that‚Äôs what we do lol
---
Yeah, I know. Just joking a bit with the third-class citizen treatment many give to druids.
---
Priest is significantly faster to level than mage.
---
Will do once I go home. You might want to check with an experienced hunter first before making a guide.
---
I have a lot of Vanilla experience, but my hunter was a farming alt so it's not like I'm a hunter god. But it could be a good starting point.
---
Fear Ward is really good in PvP, it's not really necessary in PvE but you'll still get a guaranteed raid spot if you are a Dwarf Priest usually.
---
Thanks for the answer
---
So you're the "Ackchyually"-meme?
---
Okay thanks
---
Huh, cool to know. Thank you for the information.
---
Note: I never did argue that just increasing or decreasing health or damage would be a good solution to counteracting the removal of the debuff limit. I naively thought that the removal could be done without any other changes being implemented.
---
dps warrior isn't niche
---
enhancement shamans, and moonkins don't get to raid unless you get your friends to let you come
---
Have an upvote, I guess :D
---
Shhh he could change his mind !!!
---
This is a nice concept. Been trying to figure out how to do it myself when gearing my warrior. The pre raid bis is hard and expensive as hell and often people dont even mention the options out there. I have a pretty good idea on what to go after but I'm no content creator.
---
you don't need exalted for pvp mounts
---
I'm sure you put a lot of efforts into this but I would hold off on doing any more of these so-called BiS lists considering Blizzard still hasn't communicated on the state of progressive itemization nor mentioned in what state most of the items that received a serious rework at some point will be at release, if they will all be available at all, in a nerfed version or 1.12 version, or completely removed from drop tables until a later stage. Any work you're doing now might be invalidated in the near future.
---
Sure. I'd appreciate it.
---
The whole point of the guides I want to make is to basically be good enough anyway though, so no need for perfect BiS all the way around. We're cutting corners here :P
---
Had several lvl 60, both on blizzard and private servers, and i have never played past AQ. This time I won't be min maxing, not worth it in the long run.
---
I remember making the mistake of quitting WoW at some point during TBC and uninstalling the game.. When I got the itch a few weeks later I'd have to dedicate the day to reinstalling/swapping disk
---
Some Azerothians protest against the ancient sport, they call it barbaric, cruel and unnecessary. Most of us gnomes treat it for what it is, temporary flight form baby!
---
Because I am sooooo sure 100% of players will clear naxx within the first year it release. /sarcasm
---
Just like with vanilla, classic is going to have a small percent of players that see that endgame content. Thank goodness they plan to release it and (hopefully) never change it and just let people play. If even 50% of players that WANT to eventually clear naxx actually do clear it within the first 5 years of release I would find it amazing.
---
Unless you are a no lifer it is going to take a long time to get that far even with all we know due to RL duties and responsibilities.
---
No option for druid?
---
You'd probably have to prioritise. No one likes someone who needs on everything. That said, as people say, stare your intentions before the run. Some people might only need a piece or two from the dungeon you run, consider compromising. Or run dungeons with friends :)
---
Yeah that's a fair point. I actually had started working on this before the alpha info was datamined, so had to redo bits in the middle to cover the itemization doscovered then. I might have to do it again, but it'll be easier to update than start everything from scratch, I think ;)
---
This is the answer, fresh vanilla servers that follow a timeline are funsies
---
Yeah warrior is definitely on the table. There's so much that gets glossed over.
---
Pretty sure that'll be next up (will check the straw poll tomorrow).
---
Much to my wife's dismay :P
---
You guys seem like a great fit, perfect raid times and I like your relaxed attitude.
---
I have played vanilla as well, raided casually as a holly pala (mc/ony/bwl). I am planning on playing a rogue this time.
---
I have 2 weeks of vacation time saved for classic release specifically. Planing on making it to 60 in that time. I'll hit you up on discord once I get back home with few more questions!
---
Added to the written guide. Don't know how I missed it.
---
Okay I think im done lol, more than I expected
---
Vanilla = Manga
---
TBC/WotLK = Subbed Anime
---
Cata-Legion = Dubbed Anime
---
BFA = 4kids dub
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#sEou0xZZVfztrcqo
---
I wanna raid heal and do ret stuff in the open world/PvP. 20/0/31 really appeals to me.
---
I am not opposed if they go the OSRS route tho.
---
Upvote this, verycoolguy's sound effects are legendary.
---
It will update to Wod.
---
Informed people have been saying for months that most raids would have 1-2 resto druids and 2-3 hunters top and that these two classes looked way overpopulated in the polls compared to their actual demand for raids. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Truth to that for sure
---
hahaha
---
Lesser than 1% of players saw Naxx in vanilla WoW. Blizzard needs to just slow things WAAAAY down, and not cater exclusively to the hardcore raiders' needs for new content. I'd say they can easily space out each phase by 1/2 year to let us really soak in the experience of each phase. 
---
It's not like the hardcore raiders aren't going to come back when new content is released. But by slowing down content, you let the vast majority of players actually progress and enjoy content before new stuff is released and they get left behind again.
---
One of my frustrations with the original WoW was how constantly behind I was and how I get more behind after every patch. I wasn't in a hardcore guild, and I joined the game already late so there weren't many options to run gear specific dungeons and raids to help me catch up. So I was basically just left behind. I really hope this won't repeat with classic and I think the best way to ensure this is by slowing down content release.
---
After Naxx, we can finally start enjoying the gears we've worked so hard to get. We can finally go do BGs on equal footings. Let the hardcore players leave if they threaten to leave, the remaining vast majority of players will be happy.
---
Did WotF get you out of rogues blind back in Vanilla?
---
he wanted tree fiddy actually so nerr
---
I'll go 33/18/0 with all the healing talent except imp loh
---
Redoubt, hit, imp freedom and bop, kings, shield spec and imp conc from prot.
---
So I'll have imp conc, imp wisdom, imp judgement and kings.
---
Someone else can do imp Devo (like 1-2% mitigation for 5 points) and imp might.
---
This build wills serve me well for raiding and PvP.
---
DPS-Healer. Got it!
---
No. You will only need a subscription, and with the same sub you can play both Classic and retail.
---
BFA is only required if you want to play BFA content.
---
Ghostly for matchups where dodging is desirable. Premed because why not, I like the Sub tree, gives potential for a huge opening burst. Skipping Ruth and Relentss because dagger rogue isn't really about finishers, and cause you can't have it all. Lethality is overrated, especially in PvP, where it doesn't affect Ambush. HEMO BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU NEED A QUICK COMBO POINT AND/OR BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET BEHIND SOMEONE, AND IT'S CHEAPER THAN PUTTING 2 POINTS IN IMPROVES SS.
---
Has this been something that blizzard has addressed that perhaps I‚Äôve missed?
---
Shaman
---
Could happen, but I'm pretty sure they've already stated all you need is an active wow sub. Which means they're probably just talking about paying 15$ a month, they could be sneaky and say you need BFA but I doubt it.
---
Yep
---
Yes, well, it works against some people ^^
---
Your mistake was rolling a Male Nelf. Gross.
---
The problem is that you‚Äôre going to look so cringe.
---
The content took a SHARP turn for the easier when the debuff limit was upped from 8 to 16 to the point it became MUCH easier as a result. People have already complained about the increased cap in Classic and have argued in favor of the 8 slot limit again.
---
That alone should have tossed up some flags.
---
You're probably right. We'll have to wait and see. But yeah I'm not hardcore enough to min/max in this particular instance, I'll just try to make daggers work as best as they can.
---
The Black Temple was so Awesome!
---
There have always been players who are just out to seek the unprovoked murder of other players. They used to be the minority. Maybe it is something about the anonymity that comes with a large population. Maybe it is a generational thing. Maybe not being able to communicate with the other faction dehumanizes them. For whatever reason these people just don't think about it, or they don't care. I don't know which is worse.
---
You tell me that there is no honor in wPvP. I tell you that you have no honor in wPvP.
---
You just ruined my 2 gold BoE legs...
---
Cheers suppose you're right with the tier sets etc they'll help with elemental. I know there's a in the middle type spec where you're majority resto half ele never really seen that in action though. The only other concern I had was gear for enhancement, I suppose there's a lot of hunter mail stuff with agility on which could be collected on the side? Up until PvP armour if I get that far.
---
So, if I just need a subscription, do I have to buy the basic verson of WoW?
---
Classic Panel at last Blizzcon. here's an article about it: https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/wow-classic-free-with-subscription/
---
You roll a different class and do it all again! ;-)
---
Totally agree, I dont care if it takes 4-5 yrs. I like the idea that we can work to it, without an expansion and reset every 2 yrs. 
---
I mind back in vanilla, I had 4/4 pcs of Dragonstalker &amp;  T2.5 gear from AQ40 by the time tBC was released and I'd pretty much replaced all the epics with Green quest items in Hellfire Peninsula.  I am looking forward to having good gear and being able to raid tough bosses and still PVP without the rush and impending release of new level caps.
---
No, you can start a free "Starter Edition" account and then add a subscription to that.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/start
---
Not gonna deny the booty is a big plus, but the bigger plus I argued for was the stealth boost in PvP, and the viability of daggers in PvE. People are disagreeing with me on both accounts, but that's okay, having the debate was my intended goal.
---
Soooooo, you're in confusion about chosing stoneform 10% armor increase for 8sec to 5%weapon skill for tanking dungeons which you can do pretty essily anyhow? Then you also say that you will be end-game tanking?
---
The choice is pretty easy, Think you'r looking for an excuse to pick dwarf cuz of rarity?
---
First of, pick whatever you like, if your getting accepted to tank in a guild as dwarf, their not specifically hardcore.
---
2nd, as human you will struggle a little less with holding aggro from full bursters, alsoooo thunderfury is a sword... who knew?
---
Good luck tho:)I have had dwarf tanks, you just have to be a little better at tps for less.
---
Ahh such a lovely caring paladin. I wonder what dark secret you re hiding. Must be dwarf bdsm.
---
if that was me, its gonna scare the shit out of me
---
Not a good take
---
I'd rather not think about that particular detail, especially in those terms *shivers*
---
No, WoW is free to install. You'll just pay your sub and have access to retail + Classic but not the BFA content. BFA has nothing to do with Classic, you won't need to buy it.
---
Indeed, it should've been.
---
&gt; On pservers getting both ZG and dragonslayer buff is really easy. Then you have DMT, where one team just does it, creates a raid and everyone can go in.
---
Indeed, Pservers generally don't have the 6(?) hour CD on putting up heads for instance however, making it vastly easier to have rallying cry for one.
---
I also highly doubt you'd get the full raid to train through Tribute for those buffs when bringing full consumables or a proper raid spec is too much, but I may very well be wrong.
---
In the end you're losing 20%, moreover you're losing out on a lot of sustainability through distilled wisdom and mana reg meaning more drinking and slowing down. Might need to bring more healers and thus lower DPS, it all adds up.
---
For the sake of argument let's say you run a comp of 6 healers 2 tanks and 32 DPS.
---
The healers output say 700 HPS each, The damage dealers pull 900 DPS each averaged out as a maximum performance.
---
Total hps of the raid is 4,200, the total DPS is 28,800 - assuming we instead play at 80% of our maximum potential we're at 3,360 hps and 23,040 DPS.
---
At this point you're probably too low on healing, so you'd switch around one at least most likely two DPS to healers instead giving us roughly 4,480 HPS with 8 healers, meanwhile we dropped to 21,600 DPS.
---
So at the end of this convoluted calculation we've swapped to 2 tanks 8 healers 30 DPS, we've gained 280 HPS and lost 7,200 DPS, or roughly an extra 9 DPS players in the raid.
---
The raids are still very much doable under the above mentioned circumstances, you're probably doing them rather comfortably, but you're also miles behind what could potentially be.
---
If the classic servers are a success I could see them exploring other options too.
---
Basic version of WoW (formerly called battle chest) doesn't exist anymore, only a sub is required to play retail, all xpacs except the current one.
---
When Classic is out, the same sub will allow you to play both games.
---
Do I need to install Diablo 3 to play classic?, please I need to know
---
We have no idea. But the likely scenario if they want to do TBC and beyond is new servers that people can transfer to. Otherwise you just create another situation where people want Vanilla back... again.
---
We are doomed.
---
What happens after Naxx?
---
S
---
Yikes...
---
His 52lvl rogue, especially the wheel part, is really good.
---
did you play vanilla or do you currently play on an emulated server? it seems like you have not actually played the game to be able to see why this build is not that good, mod is only good for hemo only builds, not daggers, its a waste of points in a dagger build
---
&gt;Premed because why not
---
premed is ok since your build is already broken and you don't need the points but if you had an actual competitive build you wouldn't have the 8 extra points for it
---
&gt; Skipping Ruth and Relentss because dagger rogue isn't really about finishers
---
rogue is about stunlocking, both of those are essential for daggers, kidney shot is a finisher...
---
&gt;lethality is overrated
---
no comment
---
&gt;HEMO BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU NEED A QUICK COMBO POINT AND/OR BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET BEHIND SOMEONE, AND IT'S CHEAPER THAN PUTTING 2 POINTS IN IMPROVES SS.
---
hemo is 4 points to get
---
improved sinister strike is 2
---
hemo is only good for slow weapons like swords and maces, it does fuckall for daggers
---
Ice cold.
---
I understand this option, but why risk splitting the community even more?
---
I guess we have no idea what they have planned, if anything at all!
---
&gt; easily space out each phase by 1/2 year  
---
Easy way to kill the game, I guess. Even the more casual players are going to get bored of doing one raid per year, don't be daft.
---
Awesome, thank you.
---
No, you had to mash the button twice.
---
&gt;  stealth boost in PvP,
---
Your problem is that its oceans worse than Stoneform/Escape Artist, so the PvP-argument falls flat. It's also worse than Perception. 
---
You have +5 agility on human for that daggerspec (and 3 less STR), so you gain an insane 2 attack power and 0,17% crit as nelf, with the absolute worst PvP-racials and the inability to have sword skill if you ever choose to move out of daggers.  
---
This is not a debate in my opinion, but a question of preference when it comes to racial looks. Tailoring arguments around nelfs won't work.
---
Played a prot pally in TBC, had a thoroughly good time. I‚Äôm aware the spec is not optimal for raiding in Vanilla, and im looking forward to healing this time round. 
---
My question is, will I have to wear robes/leather as most pre-raid BiS lists i‚Äôve found include almost no plate. I plan to RP a little so class fantasy and cohesion is important, if I wanted to look like a priest i‚Äôd roll one. 
---
P.S : How hard will it be to get a full T2 set with atleast 5+ pallys in my raid group? 
---
Thanks for your responses!
---
The problem is the answer to the which race question is always troll. And trolls can't be druids.
---
As long as they are separate from the permanent servers...
---
You're retarded just because you can't play or you suck doesn't mean blizzard should cater to you. Do you really think one to two years per phase is a good idea? Have fun doing ony and mc only for 2 years and waiting 10 years for naxx. Idiot.
---
I've played both and seriously, I liked dagger way more since you need to prove more. If you'r in to both PvE and PvP you take daggers. But my personal preference is go dwarf for stoneform, since no race as you said have dagger wep skill so it wont matter. The agi boost is so small it wont be noticeable in PvE environment as NE. Stoneform as Rogue is great in PvP to be able to cut your bleed effects and vanish.
---
But if you want to min/max hc to clean clear in PvE with the guild you probably have no choice to not pick Human. But classic is about fun, you spend far to much hours to chose wrong &gt;.&lt;
---
thottbot is still a thing?
---
Everything going okay there, bud?
---
Not quite yet. I figure it makes sense to go for the "most popular" classes first.
---
It'll come though ;)
---
I think a really good example to compare Retail vs Classic to is Runescape. Some players still play and enjoy Runescape 3 which is an entirely different beast from Old School Runescape. Runescape 3 can be directly compared to Retail in that the changes are mostly made for convenience (or in RS3 case p2w) that have alienated the people who were attached to the core mechanics of the originals gameplay. The thing about RS3 and Retail WoW though is that they had their bases in OSRS and Classic WoW which provided a core dedicated player base that struggled through the more difficult and tedious leveling process building their investment into their characters and the game. I would say this is the real reason that WoW's subscription #s have decreased through the last few expansions as it's also gotten harder for them to recruit new players into a 15 year old game. I don't think that Classic will ever be able to revive WoW at this point unless it somehow becomes a cultural phenomenon again, but I think the return to those original design choices will help to build a steady and stable community of gamers. Beyond that I'd love to see implementation of some kind of progression, either in the release or remastering of expansions following some kind of voting system ala OSRS but with seperate servers to remain at the Classic point.
---
Please tell me thats a joke
---
Completely fucking over your reach for CTRL and SHIFT in the process, genius.
---
A breath of fresh air in a swamp of recent times. Would be interested to see what a warlock and shaman guide looks like.
---
Some people are naturally going to get bored of Vanilla after farming Naxx. Some people are naturally going to want to keep playing Vanilla. There will *always* be a split. The only safe option (if they want to do TBC) is to have separate TBC servers so that vanilla purists aren't forced to switch.
---
expansion servers? separate servers per expansion?
---
give credit.  this is from verycoolguy/satansheterofather [(here)](https://www.youtube.com/user/SatansHeteroFather)

All good. I'm leveling a healing priest to max first and I have looked up a lot of info for BiS pre-raid gear. You basically have everything else besides that wand.

The rules are not arbitrarily enforced. People have been restricted and banned for using custom models for years.

The fact that you are not aware of this doesn't change the facts.

I have no inclination of doing so. People who violate the rules of the game do so at their peril. If they get banned for it, so much the better, the result is a better community.

I don't really understand the need for validation from random people on reddit, or trying to self-convince that it's a passable choice based on how much karma or support you receive from people that you will never play with.
---
Your entire post is biased because you try so hard to justify your choice. NElf is strictly inferior to human in PvE and strictly inferior to gnome and dwarf in PvP. Those are facts, the objective truth, and any experienced player will tell you the same thing.
---
Now if you want to play Nelf then just play Nelf. You do not need validation, nobody is going to stop you and it's not going to make the game unplayable. But trying to justify your personal choice on reddit is not going to change the balance of the game.

The only problem i have with your post is 1/2 year content release, i know your just sorta throwing out a number but jesus you have no idea the ramifications of the burnout potential that would cause, no mayter how dedicated die hard vanilla player let alone the casuals

Completely unnecessary dude.
---
It was brought up as historic element of vanilla and Night Elf Rogue, not as a strength for Classic WoW. Interesting that the time to exit combat was random, I didn't know that and thought Blizzard just never got the mechanic working 100%.

Absolutely brilliant idea ! Make barrens chat great again !

It's the only sharding I would get behind : the body would be in a different place for every player ! :D

I know stunlocking is pretty godlike, but I also love a good old Ambush, especially on clothies. The 3 points leading to Hemo are essential in my book, I'd take them even without Hemo, Rupture is my go-to finisher, and Serrated Blades also provides a passive damage boost, especially against clothies. Lethality is really not all that amazing if you're playing a hit-and-run playstyle that hinges more on a strong opening, and it would only increase the crit damage of backstabs.
---
And yes I did play Vanilla, since the beta actually albeit quite casually. But that has nothing to do with anything, even someone who's never played is allowed an opinion, especially with all the data that's out there.
---
You deadzone hunters and sheep their pet allowing u to shatter combo them. Unless they are naxx geared that should for the most part win you the fight 
---
You cant 1v3 non melee unless they are incredibly bad.
---
Of course, what better time to try to break your consecutive summersault record? It's called multitasking and it's what pro people do... Jeez.

Of Course you need it and you need to buy Overwatch, CoD 4 and Destiny 2!

Remember that Kargoz vid about paladins? He made 40 minute video about bullshit /sit mechanics and levelling for paladins. If someone follows that they are going to be in for some serious trolling.

This would be a really good idea, however Vampiric's healing is only effect by the Priest's Shadow damage, not Shadow damage in general

I cant wait to spam this in the barrens
---
Pretty much the dps build besides Vindication instead of imp bom (leveling u will use wisdom). Just go straight ret and fill everything else after. Dont think its worth to go holy/prot first and then ret.
---
Go ret first to get SoC, then prot for reck, later on ret again. Be Aware though, sitting to get reck procs wont work in classic as it is a private Server Thing.
---
Play it with shield/1h, most damage from auto hits + SoR. Can do group pulls aswell and easily tank stuff. Free heal every 2 min is awesome. Went with that on private server, was really smooth.
---
-------------------------
---
Holy Pve: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxurgstxGzZx / once per raid: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxhrgoxxGt0ou
---
You have all important heal talents, have kings and imp. wisdom/might. The rest is just as theres nothing more to take. More fear resist is nice on some Encounters, longer judgements means you dont have to replenish it via melee hit so often. If you Need mana -&gt; SoW with 3% more hit. Consecration is just a Gimmick here.
---
The second one is only to have sanctuary buff in raid. Improved cons Aura can be nice aswell sometimes.
---
Holy/Tank Hybrid: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVEu0xoxVuxI0z / more tanky: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuoxZVGxIhzxo
---
If you guild allows/wants it, that would be the to go for specc. Your mainrole is still healing, youre just passing on some stuff inbetween. DI, HL, Illu and HP are the mandatory talents for healing.
---
If you want to be more tanky (your only purpose will be trash/add tanking like ony whelps), you can pass on HP to go deeper into prot.
---
If you have a holy/tank hybrid in raid, the BoSanc holy spec wouldnt be needed.
---
Full ret: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sE0zZVhZEf0tbcq
---
Not really much to say, this spec gives the most damage boost (besides reck what is not useable in raid). You could Switch one Point of movement Speed into repentance if you want that.
---
Holy with specific buffs is the kinda Standard holy spec as theres not so much to Talent into as holy (unless u go for sanctuary).
---
Full Prot: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVVzoZVhtI0zEoVb
---
Remember, as prot you want to get crit. Avoidance Overall isnt that great. Awesome spec for dungeon tanking.
---
Holy/Prot PvP: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuMgktVMx0e
---
Kinda just holy Pally minus the buff shit required for raiding, but more tankines in pvp (dodge, parry, armor etc against wars/hunt/rogue/enh/feral/ret)
---
Reck ret pvp: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sZVGt0s0xZVfztrck
---
More Focus on tankiness and Utility. More stuns, more freedoms, more avoidance. 1 Point vindication to Trigger the effect (debuff enemy), rest for damage boost.
---
Prot reflective PvP: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sZVhxcIzEoVfc0bb
---
Only good against melees in pvp as you are really tanky and reflect quite some damage. Advised to have items like Essence of Pure flame or nagelring to boost the reflect even more.
---
My personal specs:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVVzoZVhtI0zEoVb (the full prot spec)
---
I will use that at the beginning of classic to tank dungeons for guild. Awesome spec for that and if played corectly, you dont have that much mana Problems as most People say. Cant advice to tank anything than trash in raid with that. Even UBRS. With gear its doable, but with fresh Greens/blues ... cant recommend it.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sExubxotZVf0tb (endgame/raiding)
---
As I will be healer in classic, but still wanna have some fun the retish way, thats the spec to go for me. All important holy stuff covered and still some ret talents. PvP with holy shock will be funny aswell. Fuck improved buffs, I go Salvation topkek.
---
&gt; Lesser than 1% of players 
---
Because people were trash and non raiders had a reason to play (novelty) in 2006. Any raiding guild now will see plenty of naxx. Most of the types of players not cut out for raiding will just quit the game, so probably 95%+ players that are still playing when naxx opens will see it.
---
I hope not.
---
Seperate Serversf or TBC and WotLK with possible transfers from Classic would be awesome. But I don't want to be forced onto a TBC server.
---
Thanks - I reposted the comment again.
---
What would be THE extra ability for each class/spec to make it broken?  
---
Wlock teleport/shadowfury in classic?
---
Used to be only 1 key dropped per run
---
I trust the wow classic team, not blizzard as a whole.
---
Imp LOH is quite important talent in raiding. As its used as a armor buff increase in certain boss pulls ( 2minutes, +30% more armor). While loads of the fights are under 2 mins, you can just use it pre-pull and drink your mana back while others start the fight. -20minutes off the CD is VERY nice too.
---
Much more useful than lets say -10% on fears.
---
This is something I can actually get behind.
---
Nice to get some ideas
---
Do you trust activision to keep there paws off?
---
Yes
---
Not starting fresh servers. THATS FOR SURE.
---
Debuff slot limit is real though.
---
Good for you, im glad your a person that can turn the other cheek, keep being wholesome
---
I don't care about validation, I just wanted to start a debate, and boy am I getting a lot of opinions from people, it's great! Is it really so wrong of me to question the 'objective truth'? Opinions change, and maybe the whole "NE sucks" thing is just a myth, spread far and wide by elitists, and based on false or outdated assumptions. From what I can tell, there's validity to my points, and NE simply suits my style, while also being perfectly viable.
---
Classic/vanilla WoW is the closest thing to me to a perfect mmorpg. Every damn expamsion starting with burning crusade they kept adding or removing certain things from that classic experience. Garbage flying mechanics, paladins in Horde, the concept of blood elves. All those thing, one by one, eventually made wow suck big time to the point where you can't even recognize it. Classic promises to provide the ultimate mmorpg experience like it already did back in 2004-2006. It managed to achieve the balance between mega hardcore mmo's and the baby mmo's. It was the definition of not too much or too little and spoilers, but it does still do that. Vanilla/Classic that is.
---
I hope they will never implement sharding into classic, this would destroy every open world feature, except the downtime while waiting for a mob to respawn.
---
Sharding ruins the game. It wasn't in vanilla and it shouldn't be in classic. If you want sharding you have retail to play.
---
I wouldnt know as i was raiding in hardcore guild the whole way. There was nothing casual about it. The word i would use is unhealthy.
---
Just read through some of his post history, he seems to be having a rough time.
---
A) you just lied. I played from release on the 2nd highest pop US server which dwarfed any EU server and never had a queue over 600
---
B) if you want sharding so bad, download and play retail
---
As long as it's on a separate server that you can copy your character to then I have no problem with it.
---
I am glad dim-wits like you don't call the shots at the Blizzard office. Classic will have sharding (as outlined in last year's Blizzcon) if populations in the starting zones are big enough to have an impact on gameplay.
---
If it turns out Classic isn't as hot, there will be no sharding. If it's a blockbuster, it will. Fine with me and I am pretty certain you will also not mind too terribly once you are out of Durotar.
---
&gt;ony prequest in stormwind I try to do unarmed, bow or gun maxing
---
Hmm... Something i could do on my pally, to max out 2-h axe (Nightfall).
---
Tauren health buff isn't as great as troll's berserking to increase threat per sec.

Someone dinged 60 in silithus and shouted out in general chat, his name was silithus too.

Still funny when i think about it how we laughed in teamspeak üòÑ
---
almost certainly, what they've spent all of this time doing is making tools to more easily import old data, having done this before and having viable tools would make porting other expansions a breeze
---
Yes, because the only thing you can do in Classic is raid. There's nothing else you could possibly do. We need to rush the phases!
---
Play whatever the hell you want. What good player defines is the PLAYER not the spec. Private-Servers showed that Hybrids work throughout the raid content
---
&gt;But since this sub and the players in private servers are much, MUCH more hardcore than rest of the classic population
---
How can you tell what Classic's population will be when the game hasn't even been released yet?
---
Omg the old comics. All the memories coming back like it was yesterday
---
I'd say theres 2 big breakpoints in the whole new content argument. The first is the end of vanilla and the second is the end of wrath. I think a ton of people don't want to lose out on playing TBC and wrath again, and thats understandable, but after that, there won't be that many people left arguing for Cata. I'd take Cata over BFA anyday and i'm sure alot of people loved it and MoP and WoD but I think thats the time were blizzard should get experimental again because it was such a shitshow when cata released it really can't be much worse than that.
---
I'd really like some "new" old style content like raids that were canceled or never adding some things that were horrible to the game in the long run, but TBC is not the place for that and it's risking too much to trust blizzard not to screw up good content when we could tell tell them not to mess with it and just do it the exact same way.
---
I don't think anyone that hates BFA now wants garbage systems like LFR, 4 raid difficulties and dungeon finder, because all of those things have proven to be objectively terrible but we can still have TBC and early wrath before any of that gets added, and to be honest of the first 3 expansions wrath is the only one that people argue changes for. On a ton of wrath servers like Angrathar, they buff the content to make it actually enjoyable and not super easy. Implimenting soft improvements like never doing Dungeon Finder, making pre Ulduar content more difficult and ToC and ICC being 1 difficulty could easily lead into a brand new "alternate timeline" expansion.
---
Just my take on how to make sure we get cool stuff without messing up the old, amazing game.
---
Something is fucking wrong with your hands if You cant reach shift by having your hand 1 key to the right. I have absolutly No problem reaching Any if those. Actually it makes it easier for me to reach shift, i dont have to bend ny finger all that much.
---
&gt; the answer to the which race question is always troll
---
No.
---
The answer is always night elf, because shadowmeld and wisp spirit are the two musthaves for world pvp.
---
it's a night elf bro, he just drank a little bit too much from that moonwell

Casual players didn't organize or join 40 man raids, and the overwhelming majority of players were casual. Despite this, they didn't seem to get bored once they hit 60, in fact, subscriptions kept growing.
---
The idea that we need a constant rapid source of content that are pushed by the most hardcore guilds is what eventually led to retail WoW. You have to push new things through constantly, and then adjust the game so that casual players aren't left behind by literally years of gameplay. Classic WoW can avoid this by seriously slowing down content releases. Like I've said, the vast majority of vanilla players never touched 40 man raids much less Naxx yet they were overwhelmingly happy with the experience. Perhaps, it's important for us to explore why that is instead of using the false assumption of constant new content = good for game.
---
&gt;You deadzone hunters and sheep their pet allowing u to shatter combo them.

I love it when people simplify a matchup down to just 2 actions. Real good talk.

---
You're gonna be playing it the right way. I am envious of anyone that can truly go into Classic not knowing what to expect. 
---
I am encouraging those of my friends that have not actively played WoW (but want to try it out) not to look up anything, and more importantly, not to worry when some douche tryhard tells them off for not knowing everything. And I am encouraging those of my friends that have played too much (myself included) not to ruin the fun for those that can experience it for the first time. Nothing's worse than being dragged through the early quests, and just blindly doing what someone is telling you to do, only to realise that you didn't manage to actually experience those quests, and your character, while doing it.   
---
Some of us are already too deep in the rabbit hole, and have played the game to the point where it becomes really difficult not to min-max to some extend.  I know what I don't know, and that's a curse - because I gots to know! 
---
This time my main reason to optimise my playing time is simply that I won't have a lot of playing time - so I gotta make the most of it. And to me, raiding, and playing with my friends that will have the time, is what making the most of it is - so if I'm to be lvl 60 at a somewhat reasonable time, I gotta be efficient.
---
What are the class + spec that will let you "have your cake and eat it too" so to speak? DS/ruin for warlock?
---
what do you mean, every realm is separate from each other in vanilla.
---
No it's real, check out 1.13.1 patch notes
---
The question for me is will there be any changes if classic is rly successful. We don‚Äòt know how many people will play classic at least we can‚Äòt say how long they will stay. But if it turnes out more successful than retail how will blizzard react?
---
Honestly, I dont care, just give us Classic with nochanges and we are done. They already killed the HOTS for us tryharders there so time to kill the retail with Classic release &lt;3
---
I think he meant 6  months tho and not 1 - 2 years
---
Appreciate it! Tbh I‚Äôm tossing up wether to roll pve against pvp, always been a pvp guy myself but it does get boring..
---
Yes, you will have to use alot of cloth all the time, and use an offhand instead of a shield mostly. 
---
It won't be that hard to get tier gear, just make sure the person in charge of loot knows that you want it and make an argument outside of RP. Say that you want it for farming or something and take full t1. at least 2 of the other paladins will have full t1 by the time BWL is out so you can make a solid argument for you getting it. It's not like it really matters that much because the stats on the items are bad so they're not very contested and only usable by paladins.
---
Bandage warrior?
---
Copy character? Nah buddy you will start as everyone - create new character - grind 1-60 :) no shortcuts if you want to experience Classic.
---
Yeah i meant that as 1 over 2 as im sure OP, although i think the guy below me didnt... yikes
---
Ah...I see you're a man of culture as well
---
That's not what I was referring to at all, I was referring to copying your character that you leveled from 1-60 to a separate server if they want to add extra content after Naxx, but I'm glad you got to stroke you E Ego.
---
Fair enough :)
---
Well, how can you tell its exactly like this sub ? No, since the subscription is shared with retail, a LOT of retail players will at least try out classic. And i was saying there are many unknowns that you cannot estimate atm.
---
Not just some wise ass comment that how can you know this and that.
---
Didn't i see this on r/wow from a different user? ü§î
---
In our raid group we have 6-8 resto shamans on average, 2-4 priests, 1-2 druids so it kind of shows. Also depending on type/age of the server not every shaman will be raiding or will not be resto and be more focused on PvP. Stats may show high popularity while part of that would be some PvP DPS shamans.
---
Woow. Hope you feel better soon
---
There is a LOT of stuff Blizzard Classic team can finish and release in 1.14 - 1.15 patches. Azshara Crater BG for example (still would like to see Naxx only gear)
---
If you only plan on tanking nelf warrior is pretty awesome and shadowmeld is wonderful for out in the world.
---
DARKSHIRE!!! I HUNGER!!!
---
What legendary ring from SM?
---
I never said rush the phases, but 6 months per phase is insane, especially when you wouldn't even have Battlegrounds *for an entire year*. I get that there's "other stuff" to do, but you shouldn't punish the people who actually want to play a huge part of the game just because you can't. The raids you want to do later than most people will always be there.
---
I had this wand all through BWL and early AQ40. Legit one of my favourite items.
---
I feel like it was released in a later patch though... might be wrong.
---
When I just started back in vanilla (Horde) I remember seeing Goro for the first time (a friendly Abomination in the undead starting area). 
---
Being a complete noob and not know what green nameplates meant, I ended up running as far around him as I could, figuring something that terrifying had to be there to murder me.
---
After seeing this, i now know i am going to roll NE Warrior even though Human is just plain better. 
---
Thank you [u/randommz60](https://www.reddit.com/user/randommz60), you've just solved crisis i had for last few weeks.
---
I hate orc guys and skelingtons but i think dwarves are the coolest go alliance
---
I hope you will get the help you need IRL. Get well soon friend.
---
yeah but I think its less risky if they did that stuff later in wrath, even though it doesn't fit the vanilla world anymore. I would really like vanilla hyjal, vanilla kara, the azshara raid portal, and the dragon isles and stuff but I don't trust blizzard to do that better than TBC. If they do it after or separately or something we get both, but if they say this is alternate vanilla with new content and it turns out awful we don't get TBC.
---
If you refer, make sure you note it, see you in phase2 and bgs
---
The thing is, the "law" is on my side, and you are playing a game with rules, and those rules don't stop world pvp or 5v1. Hence it doesn't matter what you or I think, it matters what the world rules are.
---
And in WoW, the rules are that wPvP is free for all with all items allowed and all types of groups. If you don't like this, go there are other worlds where the rules fit you: PvE realms.
---
... in 2005. It's not 2005 any more. *Many* more people will see Naxx this time regardless of phase length. I understand not wanting to rush, but 6 months per phase for content everyone knows is coming is insane. Luckily Blizzard are smarter than that. The raid content you're scared of missing isn't going away this time. Let the people who actually have time to play, play the game. The constant timegating to hold the hardcore back ruined WoW just as much as the new content push did.
---
The way I look at it, after I've played for a couple years and I'm fully Naxx geared I don't have much to lose with them attempting extra content. And you can't compare it to BFA, because it'll be designed with classic in mind. It doesn't make any sense for Blizzard to steer classic in the same direction that made people ask for classic back.
---
But there's still a distinct possibility that they fuck it up. In that case, hopefully they're open to player feedback.

---
Good video, just what I was looking for! You're right in that a lot BiS gear on priests have a ridiculous drop chance as BoE or random rolled stats, and with the exclusion of Dire Maul the pool of gwar grows a lot thinner.
---
Could you always turn in cloth for rep or does that become a thing with AQ?
---
There have been multiple cases of people reporting queues higher than 600, you're a moron if you think otherwise lmao.
---
ambush + backstab is fine for cloth but it's irrelevant to not taking the combo and energy generating talents
---
serrated blades and hemo is bad in a dagger build, 100%, anyone who has played or plays will tell you that
---
lethality is amazing
---
&gt;But that has nothing to do with anything, even someone who's never played is allowed an opinion
---
I didn't say you can't have an opinion, but it's harmful to spread the notion that hemo is good for a dagger build, dunning kruger seems apparent here, all the data out there says that you're wrong honestly, you will never find anyone saying hemo is good for daggers, it's good for slow weapons due to the way it scales
---
1h spellpower any good? I wanted to play dps pally in classic and Ive seen few videos about that build but Im not sure if I want to do that
---
I actually did ally 2hand fury on a pserver with the 1.12 BRE. It actually did really well as long as I had world buffs. The crit from it is absolutely necessary to get rage from BT/WW and keep flurry up. 
---
You would use slam as a rage dump yes, though it's not that often that you have rage to dump.
---
Yes.
---
False.
---
If you dont deadzone you are gonna get outdamaged and yes then we can talk about pushback, but you're fighting a loosing battle at that point. 
---
The hunter has the option to nade you of course  but there are too many factors to consider to talk about a in a proper matchup. 
---
The primary focus should be to get in the deadzone and if you stay there you will likely win unless you are heavily outgeared
---
What happens?
---
Thats perfekt. Was also looking for that one build that will keep respeccing to a minimum. Because im not to set on PvE/PvP yet and might change from AV to a UBRS pug every second day or so
---
Yeah, I think there's a reasonable amount of melee gear for enhancement. You can pick up leatherworking and specialize in dragonscale to get the black dragonscale set. It's a fire resist set, but it'll give you a pre-raid option for getting some decent melee mail gear.
---
Oh I do plan on raiding progress, don't you worry. I wanna remind you that 6 months is hardly enough for the average player to level and gear 2 (!) characters. We know by surveys that the vast majority of players will take a casual approach on leveling characters (and that is people on this subreddit, I'm sure the data will say that people who aren't here will have an even slower approach), so I think that timespan fits quite well. 
---
Also, nobody gets punished. Why would you see that as punishment, there's endless content even in phase 1 and 2 (especially if you have bad RNG with loot, which is realistic with 39 other people raiding with you, depending on your class). If they make each phase say 3 months, the average player will have probably just hit 60, why would they open new content at that point? That's **way** too short.
---
Also, imagine needing BGs to have fun in Classic. You have the epic opportunity to play WoW in an era where world pvp is at its finest, and you think we need BGs when we've had them for over a decade. Allow me to give you a big disagree right there.
---
How is the rent nowadays on estates under rocks?

It's "fucking wrong"? I've played CS since 1999, WoW arena and Quake with WASD and am 100% content with the quick reactions for bind modifiers via SHIFT and CTRL, yet you come in here and act as if I'm fucking retarded for not being able to reach them? Of course I'm fucking able to reach them, it's just not as smooth as playing WASD. 
---
And here's the best part, you wrote earlier something along the lines of "why would you need SHIFT modifiers, it's vanilla". Guess what, people play more than vanilla, and why the fuck would you use ESDF if you didn't need more binds in the first place?
---
I just would like TBC after Classic. It's the most balanced without all the 'easy-mode' adds, except for the flying mounts and some other minor things. All specs off all classes are viable and the game wasn't too easy at all like later on; that's why I like(d) TBC so much.
---
But really new content: I don't know... 
---
Would you make specs more viable like in TBC or would you leave the talent trees unchanged?
---
What about new gear? Just add a new tier? 
---
Increase the level cap?

Imo the answer is just rereleasing TBC after a couple of years, with some constant Classic servers.
---
I think people are forgetting how replayable WoW is. The game will not "die" from a lack of new content anymore than counter strike "died" from 20 years of nonstop Dust_2. And they also forget how once you move past a phase, you can't go back unless you restart a new server. That's why I suggested prolonging each phase as much as possible. For example The phase that rankings get introduced but no BGs should be way longer so that we can really soak it in. It's almost a different game in of itself. We will never see that again after we move on to the next phase. Why not just leave it be for half a year. The hardcore players who demand constant new content will be back to play the next phase anyway. Meanwhile, we get to really experience the max pvp potential of WoW.
---
Camped the DM east exit with a group of friends. 
---
Most people don‚Äôt know there‚Äôs literally no way to get your ghost in range to resurrect if you die in the tunnel. Meaning you‚Äôd need a GM to either teleport you or beg a group to clear DM east and res you on their way out, hoping that the gankers had left.
---
After that I pretty much stopped griefing in video games.
---
This is EverQuest but I think it's funny so I'll tell you about it anyways.
---
In EQ there was [this tunic](https://wiki.project1999.com/Ulthork_Hide_Tunic) that gave -35 HP. I used to give it away to level 1 newbies, and as soon as they equipped it they would drop dead.
---
Doesn't matter if you are veteran, retailer or new it doesn't take long to catch up. Even if the game would be 100% retailers they would sooner or later arrive at the current pserver meta.
---
All I know is lvl 35 is required for 225+
---
I can tell from experience, we gladly took gold from guys that bought it off china. Running \~20 man guild MC and taking 2 of each class to buy items that dropped. The amount of gold those guys spent on MC epix was very surprising. I vividly remember T2 druid pants from ragnaros being sold at 2000g.
---
We made around 300-500g / run as all the gold was divide between ppl that ran the instance.
---
So this high and mighty attitude that gold wasnt being bought and sold in vanilla is absolutely fucking lie. You might just be ignorant and think that way because you dont know the truth. A token system might make it more widely spread, but lets not kid ourself that vanilla didnt have that and everyone, blizzard included, benefited from it.
---
Warning! He said ‚Äúchange‚Äù! #nochanges team is on the way! üòÇ

P.s. cool idea :)
---
Cape of the fire salamander is the best you can get as alliance?
---
Zombo com..
---
I actually think your body will reapear where you died, and stay there again untill weekly main.
---
Once upon a time..
---
Imagine being a Paladin hahahaha.
---
I could totally do 1 in judges and 2 in imp loh to be fair.
---
Vanilla wow, no.  There wasn't till later on.  A lot of people had a lvl 5 alt for disenchantmenting
---
I'm already noting down ideas and plans for potential additions OSRS style. Things that improve the game without breaking any of the fundamentals that make Classic, Classic.
---
Didn't OSRS add new content? I wouldn't hate that.
---
But this thread is about lvl 60, i.e. generally about people willing to invest generally at least 200h into the game. Retail players experimenting with Classic are practically irrelevant in this context. A big amount of people playing on pservers are waiting for Classic's release. And it's thiss type non-casual players who will mostly make Classic's raiding scene, since casual raiding isn't really a thing in Classic.
---
You are not providing a decent alternative, you give extremely bad advice and you should change that part of the video.  
---
A four day cooldown is a lot of value. Instead of those useless Mooncloth Boots you could have had 4 Mooncloth Bags with 16 slots each or get your Truefaith Vestments two weeks faster.
---
Hopefully they work like Jagex, instead of releasing old content they develop custom New content. I would love to See the emerald dream
---
Thanks for the link
---
Search or be banned.
---
Not the best. Just something you can grab along the way.
---
Lol what guild is actually looking for non resto druid? That's hilarious. It's something you may end up with in non-ideal situation but not something you actively look for.
---
Honestly they should also bring back super long maintenance and server instability. I want the full Vanilla experience.
---
Yeah, thats quite common, you usually dont use judges in bosses due dps oriented debuffs you want to maximum efficiency and on trash shorter judges are just fine, thrash dies fast enough anyways.
---
&gt;there are too many factors to consider to talk about a in a proper matchup
---
Yes. That is exactly the thing. There are too many factors. That's why saying that "damage pushback is not a thing because you just deadzone and sheep" is silly.
---
At no point did I say that damage pushback causes a Frost mage to lose, or even in general that a Frost mage is bad. But factors that are out of your control will inevitably cause damage pushback that a non-Frost mage will not be affected by. And that's why Mage vs Hunter matchup, as far as I'm concerned, is simply easier as Elemental because you have more leeway. Elemental doesn't even need to bother with polymorphing the pet period.
---
Think he meant half a year, as in 6 months, as in 0.5 years
---
I think you should still think about some basic things like ‚Äúdo I want to try healing/tanking at some point?‚Äù or ‚Äúwill I enjoy my class/race/faction?‚Äù. I‚Äôd like to play rogue or warlock but I just want to try healing so much I‚Äôm going with priest.
---
That guy came in burning crusade iirc
---
6 months for phase 1 is understandable because you're factoring in the 1-60 journey, that's fine. But 6 months of Dire Maul and BG-less honor? 6 months of ZG and AB? The content is not "endless" just because you're doing it repeatedly. Many players will get bored of doing the same thing over and over again even if you don't, and will quit until the new stuff arrives. It's not healthy for the game. You're imagining a world where everyone is happy running around like it's 2004/5 and they're experiencing everything for the first time. That's not the case for many people. It's a punishment because you're holding back those that are first across the finish line just because you're still running the race, it's not fair. Same applies to anyone who races to farm MC and then complains there's nothing to do - Blizz should not cater to you *or* them and reach a sensible compromise, which they will. You're in for a big shock if you think phases past 1 are going to last half a year. You seem to think old content becomes unplayable when the new stuff is out - you will still be able to go to Molten Core a year after Naxx is released. People will *always* be doing that content.
---
Alright, glad to hear :)
---
Even crafting them yourself this makes no sense, this is a concept known as opportunity cost:
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost
---
Mooncloth can (and should) be used for the truefaith craft, as a source of income, for bloodvine set if you ever intend to play shadow in pve scenarios, for silithus logistic badges (if you want rockfury bracers for pve), for your T3 set and most importantly, for bottomless bags, since you cant expect to get 8 onyxia bags during your career (AD and ZG bags are very likely though). Spending any mooncloth on a short-term mediocre increase of a few int is a complete waste.
---
Ever try with other 2h besides BRE? Its kinda an outlier in how good it is IMO.
---
So did you spec in imp slam? Did you ever use hamstring as a rage dump? Is it worth it on ally for flurry and hoj procs?
---
lol that was pretty good, loved it
---
**Opportunity cost**
---
In microeconomic theory, the opportunity cost, or alternative cost, of making a particular choice is the value of the most valuable choice out of those that were not taken. In other words, opportunity that will require sacrifices.
---
When an option is chosen from two mutually exclusive alternatives, the opportunity cost is the "cost" incurred by not enjoying the benefit associated with the alternative choice.  The New Oxford American Dictionary defines it as "the loss of potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen." Opportunity cost is a key concept in economics, and has been described as expressing "the basic relationship between scarcity and choice." The notion of opportunity cost plays a crucial part in attempts to ensure that scarce resources are used efficiently.

We're talking probably 2-3 years down the line anyway but as long as they keep to the general philosophy of:
---
- Respect the open world and the requirement that players actually travel places.
---
- Respect 40-man as the number for raid sizes.
---
- Respect the requirement that the best gear should require investment (eg no welfare epics).
---
- For PvP servers respect WPvP and don't introduce things like flying mounts that destroy it.
---
Then I wouldn't mind new content.
---
Agreed, i trust the classic guys to figure out how to remake a game, and port it as faithfully to the modern infrastructure. But to make new content?
---
Well there track record is &lt;10 useful blue posts since the offical launch, ill give sharding a pass since thats more for technical reason then game design but loot trading was there choice, 4 phases was there choice. They listen to us sure but it also seems like they need community help and cant figure out what makes the game "vanilla" and the ramifications of there design choices
---
To be honest I wish there was more people like you. I'm planning on playing A LOT, but I'd rather not plan everything like so many seem to.
---
Just pick a class in advance, log in, and play at your own pace and do whatever you want :)
---
I do enjoy watching a few guides here and there if they are well made, but nothing I'm gonna follow nor apply to the letter.
---
Cheers
---
I did say that i think the raid comps WILL be like in private servers (unless there is some classic change in lets say armor debuffs that changes the private server meta), just that ppl that start playing (outside this sub) can make completely different class choice distribution compared to what the survey says. 
---
Meaning the main idea of the data might be wrong in that sense. How many ppl you have fighting for the required raid spots.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/item=18723/animated-chain-necklace
---
While this page is bad for everything else concerning classic, the information when items got added seem correct.
---
Ret with Crusader Strike :(
---
How do i bring down holy vengeance on those who doubt and only repeat their blasphemous dogma?
---
Druid S tier levelled so no.
---
This is fucking garbage. The NE ones just sound like generic fantasy lotr elves, and nothing like night elf names in warcraft.
---
Imagine being so lazy that you just take an off the shelf elf name algorithm and not even giving a second though to how it fits with the night elf names already _in the game_.
---
Have you even played vanilla? Or world of warcraft at all? or anything from the warcraft franchise with night elves in it?
---
Your hunk of junk gives me things like "skyman", "amberd", "nightb", "wildwo", "raglor", "wildbr" like come on did you even test this? It's like you just do this to capitalize on the hype for classic that you rebrand these generic algorithms as blizzard entertainment world of warcraft vanilla (tm) specific tools, when in reality there is no consideration for anything the actual world of warcraft night elves are like.
---
Imagine programming in Java hahahaha.
---
So equipping an off hand can be a dps loss? I‚Äôm not sure I understand
---
Obviously it becomes a BC Classic server. More money for newer nostalgia.
---
Ye in my time twink healers were rare and none-twinks would just  blow up, but whenever you ran into a twinked priest you'd just be fishing for consecutive crits while slowly losing hope as your health ticked away to shadow word pain
---
No they cant
---
Reck bomb them
---
What I truly miss with vanilla that no other games offer is: 
---
Online/PvP with persistent character and progress. I know there‚Äôs a lot of games offering this, but they all suck ass. Miss me with that loot shooter shit. 
---
Third person team oriented game play that feels responsive enough that you can outsmart enemies based on movement and timing. Honesty I‚Äôm surprised no one managed to make a decent online arena style game in the same vein as vanilla/tbc pvp. Dota has some of it, but the autistic attention to detail and mechanical skill required is not something I want to keep up with when I have limited time to play. I was only a 4.5k scrub when I actually had time to play multiple matches in a row. 
---
Meaning, or some sort of emotional response. Like getting a new item you‚Äôll use for a long time. Anything. Maybe I‚Äôm just getting older and video games are a lot less interesting. If I want instant gratification, I‚Äôd much rather play something like apex legends or smash, the whole concept of working for something in a persistent setting is completely lost it seems. It doesn‚Äôt have to be ‚Äòhard‚Äô in a sense either, just worthwhile. Hard to explain I guess. 
---
Lastly the sense of community on a single server. A closed circuit ecosystem where you‚Äôll actually recognize players is going to be fun. Rematching people in BGs, recognizing that same player farming for the exact same item, all the little things that makes a server a community. 
---
Imo these are the things no other game managed to replicate for me, and it‚Äôs basically what I‚Äôm hyped for.
---
Me too. Had my Acount since the Day WoW launched in Europe (Feb 2005) - never got more than a 3hrs ban. They better let me still play Classic. At least I still have 245‚Ç¨ Battle.net Balance to buy and finance a new Account if I need to.
---
Found the horde
---
Really? When did they make them available again? Because Healbot workes on retail, and have worked in many expansions after vanilla.
---
SoR build might be good as an off healer buff bot type of character
---
A lot of them are looking for Resto, but they also have spots for Ferals on P-Servers.
---
added in 1.11, it wont be available during phase 1, which this video is aimed at. This is assuming that blizzard follows the progressive itemization system they have hinted at.
---
Stormrager from the EPL quest is your only other option, as green wands with enough +healing are also only available after a later patch.
---
Is there a story behind his transmog? It looks like absolute shit but at least it‚Äôs unique lol
---
I would agree on that, probably some percentage of people will drop shaman/warrior etc till 60 lvl and roll for another class. But I probably roll for horde, as it is more appealing to me, and you should not face shamans in pvp.
---
Fixed r/BetterEveryLoop
---
12-year old me used to scam people out of fiery weapon / crusader enchants in order to afford my mounts. Blizzard didn't really care at the time and I was never punished for it. 
---
One time though, I scammed a mid 30s hunter out of a fiery weapon enchant and closed the game. I logged back in 6 hours later and he was still online, grouped with me, and standing at the exact same spot. 
---
I felt so bad the next day I just mailed him his materials back and stopped this business, lol.
---
SM/Ruin*
---
Okay normally I'd agree with you, but if this happened to me, I'd just have to laugh.
---
I play alliance and I still agree to this. Never liked gnomes
---
The main thing about TBC is that it took the max players out of Azeroth. That was their biggest mistake imo.
---
Be cautious that shadow priest in raids consists of Mind Flay. that's it really.
---
The original version of Healbot literally worked that you pushed a keybind and without any further interaction it would choose a target, cast the most efficient ranked heal without overhealing, and cancel if the target got healed by someone else. You would heal by repeatedly pushing that key and doing literally nothing else. Does this still exist on retail?
---
No they weren‚Äôt most of them survived until TBC and many even until WoTLK for example the ability for an add on to rebind actions to a movement keys or camera movement wasn‚Äôt changed until pretty darn late in TBC and even then you could rebind them to a single key on the fly which allowed the auto-rotation one key spam addons to work through parts of WoTLK.
---
In Vanilla you had addons that would essentially auto cast procs or dispells because the addon would rebind them to your character or camera movement then rebind it back the addons could also change targets on the fly it was pretty darn silly.
---
It took Blizzard a long time to fix all the abuse cases addons could exploit and I‚Äôm not so sure that even today there aren‚Äôt any addons that still find creative ways to automate shit like this.
---
Yes they did, BUT only if the majority of players voted ok for that content to be added.
---
He is so right, i wish i could play vanilla wow for the first time again. It was so magical.
---
I thought about it but didn't want to come off as advertising yet another YouTuber and not the content. Idk. Thankfully it's well known enough people put in the link.
---
I understand the phases and all that but you're telling me that the phase 1 release that is based on 1.12 patch will only have items from 1.10 and before? I understand them not wanting to release Dire Maul and breaking up a lot of bigger power things but using items from 1.10 while on a 1.12 patch doesn't add up.
---
God, where do I even begin...
---
1. Daggers is not equal to Swords in PvE in terms of DPS and is more difficult to play. Source: Raided with Swords and Dagger Specs at Endgame content.
---
2. No one specs MoD when using daggers for PvP because you need those 5 points for Opportunity. The best dagger PvP spec is 16/12/23. 
---
3. Your spec is utter garbage. I‚Äòm not even going to comment on your choices. Either you have never played 1.12 or you are terribly bad.
---
4. NE is one of the worst classes for rogues and you will feel it no matter if you are a min-maxer or not. Gnome, Dwarve, Undead, Orc, and Human are much better.
---
&gt;6 months for phase 1 is understandable because you're factoring in the 1-60 journey, that's fine. But 6 months of Dire Maul and BG-less honor? 6 months of ZG and AB?
---
You're forgetting world bosses (which opens more world pvp) and the fact that most people will not play a single character until the end. People will find that they wanna level alts and gear them as well - easily justifies some more time. You're right that Blizzard will probably find a middleground of say 4-5 months per phase after the first 6 months, which I think would be acceptable. 
---
I'll admit that the choice they have to make with this isn't easy and involves many many factors. I just hope they take the route that doesn't leave us at the end of classic after 1 1/2 years. Especially because I've always liked the first few months of an expension the most by far, simply because everyone is pretty much equally gearless.
---
Nice, I'd be ok with that once classic has fully run it's course
---
Reaching R14 has nothing to do with skill, it‚Äòs a matter of time. Hence your argument is fookin stupid.
---
which claim are you saying is false
---
I thinks its BiS for fury warriors
---
Nah I'm with you completely and saix this earlier. I'm not gonna plan anything. I'm going to login, stare at the character creation screen and pick what I feel at that moment just like I did back then.
---
deep freeze
---
Because there was no level cap on disenchanting only on enchanting.
---
As in you could dust a level 60 green with any enchanting skill.
---
It is
---
I was wondering whether it could be. Turns out the numbers are really close when MH and OH weapon are very different quality-wise, before Poisons etc come into play. Like in the Cruel Barb example I posted.
---
&gt;In the end you're losing 20%, moreover you're losing out on a lot of sustainability through distilled wisdom and mana reg meaning more drinking and slowing down. Might need to bring more healers and thus lower DPS, it all adds up.
---
I would deposit that nobody uses flasks for a ZG farm run. If I'm gearing up a character and doing AQ20, ZG, Onyxia, MC on each week, do you expect me to get 4 flasks? That's a third of the price of an epic mount each week, just so I don't have to drink one more time.
---
Its not even just about the raid spot, you will be taking gear away from those that will put it to better use and you will set a precendence for drama in the guild. If you can be an offspec why cant the priests, or druids, or other paladins?
---
I raided as feral offtank up to and through AQ40 in retail Vanilla - but it took a lot of convincing, being druid class leader, there literally being next to no druids back in Vanilla and saving raids healing in my tank gear to get it accepted there was some value in bringing a feral. I literally had to save a Major Domo wipe by tanking one of the big adds, shift out between autoattacks to battle rez the main tank, let him taunt off me, then innervate the main healer and go back to tanking Domo to convince them I was useful every now and then.
---
Even then, rogues would cry at me rolling on leather and bidding on tank rings/necks was sacrilege.
---
All of this, and feral actually has some sort of claim (more so with whats known now) to being a valuable addition to raids. Its not about min/maxing or being elitist, its about 39 people not wanting to wipe all night so a couple of people can play whats fun. More casual guilds arent excluded from this mentality, in fact their play time is even more valuable. Dont expect raiding and/or the guild to last long or go far (wiping all night on content that is a year old) if they dont impose restrictions on specs in Vanilla. No one wants to play and constantly fail, regardless of being hardcore, elitist or casual.
---
Ive been there and its not as cool as you think. All the same, good luck.
---
The problem is that this method would split the community even further until it‚Äôs so fragmented it‚Äôs not a community anymore.
---
It would also compound the problem of having to do fixes for some part of the game if and when new exploits are discovered.
---
Out of the many things the manual was inaccurate about, one truly puzzled me. There was a world map with several dungeons and landmarks located, and Black Fathom Deeps was located in the Naga ruins, in the top right area of Darkshore. 
---
As I had already done the instance in ashenvale, it piqued my curisoty and I went to check the location of the manual, and, there was the same model building as were the entrance to BFD was, but once you got down to the water there was no tunel nor cave, just the building wall.  
---
Always wondered why was it moved, and if so, why did they leave the entrance building.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt see them developing new content the amount of effort required for this is insane and it would essentially be running 2 retail games in parallel it‚Äôs too damn costly.
---
It would also fragment the existing classic community between those who don‚Äôt want any changes/content and those who do, arguably even in a worse manner than rolling out existing content patches.
---
The best expansion to date?
---
This fits well for my husband and I.
---
It‚Äôs easy to forget that when Blizzard made LFR and Heroic versions available so everyone could experience endgame raids, subscriptions actually dropped.
---
There were a lot more reasons behind the drop off, sure, but I definitely think they lost a lot of their audience by catering.
---
And I actually agree with you on this, but there‚Äôs a definite place for new content to be added, but in order to slow things down without killing the game. Even just holiday goofiness (like the snowballs) helps. 
---
Stuff like that is just awesome, and keeps the game fresh! Especially when instances which are typically left unplayed, making it difficult for new players to run them, so they add holiday quests/bosses/etc like they did in TBC so it‚Äôs easier to find groups.
---
Imagine being 8-12 months behind and trying to run BRD/LBRS/UBRS for attunements etc. Nobody wants to run them anymore. So you kinda gotta find ways to keep the players engaged in the old content too.
---
Just my two cents tho. And this is definitely a change, so... not sure if it‚Äôs really worth it!
---
Yeah excellent point. Wasnt the talent removed in TBC?
---
SFK had a nasty bug that would pull large chunks of the dungeon if you had a class with a pet. Plus, that curse 
---
In a world without easy repair and summoning stones weren't a thing, gotta give SFK a hard pass.
---
You'd just attack with your empty hand though...
---
Anno 1404
---
You just hit the nail on the head, thanks man.
---
Set roles for the classes just isn't true. Many classes have specs, that are viable if u know how to play them and are willing to learn the spec.
---
Druid for example, isn't just a healer. Feral Tank and Feral DPS are both really good. Maybe not better then a Warrior tank, but still, i'm sure u will see a Feral Tank in a raid. For Feral DPS, it really comes down to how you play it. If u don't know what power shifting is, don't even bother to play it. But there are YouTube videos explaining how to play it.
---
Paladin is also nut just a heal. Prot Pally can just perfectly find tank 20-man raids. In 40-man raids, u might give him a spot like 4th tank or something. Retri Pally is also Ok. You might have atleast 1 in ur raid.
---
Shaman is a bit of the same like the pally, just that i'm not sure if Shaman is able to tank in raids.
---
Rogue has 2 viable specs. Combat and assasination. Subtlety first get's viable as soon as u got the naxxramas trash mace(Servo-Arm), but that's a reaaaaally long time until then.
---
If you want to know more about other classes, pls feel free to ask me. I'm really enjoying helping people to find out what they wanna play and if it is viable or not.
---
Haha same here im at 25mb/s currently, i need the approbation of the 3 other neighbor for the fiber, sadly 2 of the 3 other are older than 60 so ita never gonna happen
---
Did someone say blessing of salvation ?
---
It actually became 6 phases, like a month ago (-:
---
Sharding I understand and it's just the starter zones.
---
Loot traiding, that I don't understand.
---
16 slot debuffs at the start is gonna make MC a joke for all people who call themselves a 'raider'.
---
Old spell batching applied on demand of the community.
---
But would you like the designers to decide what is Vanilla and what isn't? Spell batching rly was something back in Vanilla, so they added it. Loot traiding isn't that bad either act, cuz it changes nothing for the gameplay, like most of the changes. So I'm most sure that they know what they're doing, Classic is going to be an awesome port back in time, we are good for the next couple of years. So don't worry yet too much about what's coming after Classic, I don't (-:
---
I'm all for content after Naxx, but they need to follow in the footsteps of Jagex and introduce a poll system. Allow the playerbase to vote for changes.
---
No, and people telling you that they "easily top the meters until mana runs out" are wrong. It's one of the very worst DPS specs in the game. Even if you could somehow get the raid to devote three debuff slots to a shadow priest, the output is just hopelessly low.
---
You can actually theorycraft spriest DPS really easily because it comes from just three sources: SWP, MF and MB. The first two can't crit at all and the third one *basically* can't either because there's pretty much no crit on priest gear or talents. So just look at the base damage of those three spells, their coefficients, and whatever spell power one expects to have at that point in time.
---
I did the math once and, in full epic PvP gear and BG rep rewards, the DPS was about 450. That's when just free-casting without any movement or anything. That's not particularly good. And you take up three debuff slots in the process. 
---
One of the biggest problems is that about half of the DPS comes from Mind Flay, a channelled spell. Channelled spells are a nightmare to use in raids because they aren't high-priority so it gets bumped off by the constant shuffle of mid-prio debuffs. When that happens, your MF just stops channelling. To really DPS as a shadow priest, the whole raid has to carefully avoid competing with your *three* debuff slots (SWP, MF and whatever the shadow damage debuff is called).
---
So even if spriests didn't have crippling mana issues, their raw DPS is both low and extremely impractical to use. Even with 16 debuff slots, devoting three of them to the lowest DPS player in the raid just doesn't make sense. The only reason anybody ever brought spriests to raids was to get the shadow damage debuff for the warlocks, and nowadays people just get one healing priest to spec into that.
---
lmao that's hilarious
---
You may want to skip a few based off your faction, and just how horrible it is to get in to them. Or recover from a wipe.
---
Just gonna comment on the frost mage part because it is so wrong. If you wanna win against other, skilled casters like Shamans, Warlocks and Spriests, you will need the Ice Barrier and the imp CS. Ele is a good spec for random BGs bur for Premades you lack that extra survivability from barrier and the imp CS. 
---
Furthermore, Deep frost is the best 1v1 spec. Try playing ele against rogue, two ambush crits and you are dead. No idea how someone who played mage on a decent level would claim otherwise. Go to tournament / duel servers, or even retro and you will see that every decent mage plays a deep frost variation. For RvM, many spec Deep frost with fire for ignite procs. Against casters, imp CS is obviously the way to go.
---
Ye I figured, by the way it's quite easy to get Cloak of Exile from the Fordring questline if Tribunal doesn't drop.

We were almost always flasked doing ZG, because we'd squeeze MC, BWL, Onyxia and ZG into that 2 hour window. I would absolutely not pop a flask for the singular purpose of ZG or AQ 20since that's just 30-40 minutes actual uptime.
---
Our raiding strategy generally eats 4 flasks a week, 2 for each raid.
---
&gt;just so I don't have to drink one more time.
---
It's more akin to how you essentially don't need to drink at all when fully juiced which means we're a continuing pain train getting done in a timely manner.
---
But it wasnt till the community raged about the phases that they had to take a second look about phases, they werent going to put in the spell batching WHICH IS HUGE TO GAME FEEL in vanilla after gummy made a post asking the real question. 
---
I appreciate your optimism at the end tho keep beung wholesome
---
Thank you. And as a nice side effect, it doesn't qualify as a PvP death, so the target takes durability damage.
---
There's no such thing as too many dwarf priests.
---
If you only have the bare minimum and one of them can't show up to a raid or quits the guild, you're screwed.
---
It's kinda hard to take your criticism to heart when you're being such a dick about it, but okay, your opinion is duly noted.
---
On the other hand, in classic, there will be countless more casual raiding guild who totally don't care what class occupies the dps slots as long as the bare minimum of classes is represent. Raiding with 5 hunters and 2 rogues or 2 rogues and 5 hunters is not important.
---
I thought about this, but I assumed an empty OH would act like a non-weapon OH item or a shield. Unless you know for sure, I will need to try out what actually happens. 
---
For what it's worth, wowhead says
---
&gt;Since the base miss-rate with one weapon equipped is 5%, your base miss  rate as a dual-wielder increases to 24% as long as you have two weapons  equipped.

Ce post est destin√© aux joueurs qui ont vraiment envie de profiter de la sortie de WOW Classique au sein d‚Äôune communaut√© francophone sur fuseau horaire EST.
---
Le projet de Guilde ‚ÄúLes patriotes‚Äù (nom temporaire le temps de la constitution du groupe) se fera sur un serveur JcJ, c√¥t√© alliance et sur serveur US.
---
Nous souhaitons constituer un noyau de joueurs sympatiques, d√©sireux de progresser en groupe quand c‚Äôest n√©cessaire et quand ils le souhaitent, mais aussi curieux de (re)d√©couvrir les bases de ce qu‚Äô√©tait Wow a l‚Äô√©poque. L‚Äôobjectif assez ambitieux est de contenter les papas et mamans casu qui ont pu √™tre des hardcore en 2005 mais qui aujourd‚Äôhui devrons faire farmer leurs momes de 7 ans et plus pour les banques de popo, ainsi que les plus jeunes ou ceux qui n‚Äôont pas connu Vanilla et voudrons se donner a fond dans l‚Äôaventure.
---
Tout cela en partageant les joies du leveling dans les zones de qu√™tes, des donjons sur la p√©riode de pexing et arriv√©s au niveau 60, les acc√®s de chacun, les mountures d√©mo et palouf, la possibilit√© de faire des champs de bataille en groupe parceque le PVP, mais aussi de mettre les pieds dans les raids √† 20 et 40 joueurs qui sortiront au fur et √† mesure.
---
Nous venons de lancer le groupe facebook et le discord afin de rallier tous les francophones sur notre fuseau horaire dans une guilde de l‚ÄôAlliance (l‚Äô√©quivalent existe c√¥t√© horde sous le nom de Rage).

Hunter numbers may be a bit skewed as many peeps use hunters for farming, not raiding.
---
You do because you can. What a sad philosophy.
---
I know everyone crys no changes but i think this is one thing that could be fixed with the modern engine.

Well the dal rend set is significantly better than the krol but yea

---
pfft... nothin' personnell...
---
What did the polls predict? As a Dutchman i sincerely do not know. Did the polls say Hillary would get the most votes, or that she would win? Cause she did get the most votes, didnt she?
---
Came here to say this. Fact is just Classic is here to stay. Even if they want to bring TBC and WotLK they can't remove Classic. This would only lead situation that we have official server for all expansions and community would be super scattered. After all old days of WoW was all about community. If there would be TBC server but only handful of players, it wouldn't be fun anymore.
---
Ret is weird. I'm pretty sure some talents are flat out bugged. They is a ton of down time in the rotation.
---
They're great for supporting the raid, utility, and buffs.
---
Couldn't agree more with you, man. This is a once in a lifetime event, I don't get why someone would want to proceed through the phases in such a short amount of time. Yes some people who've seen WoW for 15 years will probably find boredom at some point, but since they've been addicted for a very long time they won't hold out long before they find an idea for what they wanna do in Classic.
---
Didnt you mean to say indisputable fact?
---
Haha. Or telling people to meet at Venomspite in Dragonblight.
---
Good job you added that arrow or we would never of seen it
---
This isn't exactly vanilla, but with TBC, blood elves could become paladins, but they had a different seal, Seal of Blood, instead of one of the alliance's seals.
---
I know there were balancing issues with this. Was Seal of Blood the seal that was too strong ot the one that was too weak?
---
No they can't, unless the entire raid is comprised of garbage players.
---
FOOKIN KNEELERS
---
I am missing something with this?
---
It‚Äôs just used for some low level crafts?
---
you forgot tier 1 support paladin

---
Holy shit You must have some serious problems in your life. You started off very hostile and seems to be hit on your pride. I never said You dont need shift binds, dont get angry at me for your lack og reading skills.
---
You will use esdf because it gives You about 8 extra non shift binds, that are easier and master than half the retarded shift binds people use.
---
Just a tip, dont be such a fucking idiot when replying to people, i didnt tell You Anything and You act like i personally insultet You out of nowhere.
---
Tell them it's a big boost to property values if they decide to sell.
---
fixed it for you.
---
Imagine having a skill that pays a shit ton of money hahaha.
---
Probably an unnecessarily pedantic distinction in this context, but ok. 
---
I was responding to someone saying the reason to take an spriest is to have shadow weaving by saying you can have that priest go pi with shadow weaving instead.  Call the spec whatever you want, it accomplishes the same thing.
---
I played vanilla from Feb 2005 to Sept 2007 and only came back to BFA before quitting again after hitting 120. I have not repackaged this work from anywhere else - the algorithm is 100% written by me and it's all for my hype of the game.  
---
The names generated are semi-random - you will get some good ones and not so good ones. The data I use to generate these all come from vanilla names but there is always room for improvement in the algorithm. I have ideas for more improvements and options in the future but these things take time to write and test.
---
Thanks for feedback!
---
I completely agree with this, the PVE in this game for me is to get gear to PVP.  World PVP adds a ton of excitement and fun and the gear progression furthers that by enabling you to take on stronger opponents and engage in wPVP battles with friends/guildies.  Faction rivalries and knowing that one war/rogue w/e that you always KoS out in the world is great.  
---
That said, I have noticed that on this sub when the topic comes up it tends to skew towards the type that want to be left alone and play on a PVE server.  If you aren't planning on keeping up with the first wave of tryhards that get ahead and geared quickly, and will be spending a long time IRL leveling and don't want to be interupted and don't enjoy the fights, PVE is probably the right answer.  But I don't like how quick everyone here is to jump to "YOULL BE GANKED CONSTANTLY BY HIGHER LEVELS" when 1.  it doesnt happen as much as you think and 2.  it doesn't take into account the points I listed above. 
---
Just food for thought for anyone considering it.
---
People might craft them for leveling tailoring. I might be thinking of TBC I feel like spider silk would always sell for a decent amount.
---
He probably meant that both kinds of servers must exidts if seasonal become a thing.
---
Best wow classic youtuber.
---
&gt;They felt safe doing it.
---
They broke the rules. Thinking you won't get punished is not an excuse.
---
Honestly I wouldn't of even been upset, that's hilarious.
---
My douchebag move was casting Waterwalking on as many people as possible before we dropped down to Anub'arak in ToC (Wotlk).
---
LoL, yes i remember and so true op!
---
So they took the oppinions off the community in account, which is imo so damn great. They could have overlooked those things or thought that it wasn't that big of a deal or it maybe was too much work. But in the end, they did it. 
---
So imagine they're gonna make new content with the advise/backup of the community, wouldn't that be great?
---
But the most logical would still be TBC (-:
---
Well obviously the thing that was released after naxx logically is TBC.
---
I think 2 years is sensible. An average of 4 months per phase, or 3.6 after a 6 month launch, though some should definitely be shorter than others. AQ/Naxx is the one that concerns me, because it's the only time you've got two raid tiers back-to-back, and they're the biggest ones. But still, once they're out, they're out, and people will still be running every tier.
---
Same. Did raids on normal and am happy with it. Can't stand LFR tho. M+ aren't so interesting as in Legion but still I do couple of them.
---
NE is not a class.
---
Or nightfall, to make up for the terrible dps 2h warrior does. One thing to keep in mind is the debuff limit. I'm not sure if BRE proc stacks with sunder and how high it is on debuff priority list.
---
Makes sense.
---
what is it that makes them scale weakly?  they only need 1 stat and the benefit a lot from mutlipliers like crit  
---
i know less about hunter than anything else but i was curious as to whether the +agility talent in deep survival is better with later-game gear than going the usual BM+marksmanship stuff
---
Why? They don't have to create a lot. Just a few Quests, dungeons, raids and zones here and there. They don't have to rush anything, they don't have to commit to the expansion amounts of content every 2 years. I would gladly want to develop something that I could take my time on and really make sure it fits vanilla.

---
I build it for a HC guild apply (still not sure I'll apply though) so I'm not cutting too much corners.
---
But in the start of a server, I'd rather not be known as the huntard that roll on everything ;-)
---
You're blind
---
fuck bis I'll wear my plate.
---
What do you mean by that?
---
Seal of Blood gave a significant dps advantage to blood elven paladins over their alliance counterparts.
---
The alliance seal, Vengeance, had its uses, but nothing that couldn't be replaced with the standard seals. Seal of blood was irreplacable as a dps tool.
---
depends on what ur talking about.  i think in pvp all classes have their strengths.  druids are the ultimate duellers and flag carriers, palas the best healer, shamans fuck up casters etc etc
---
i swear people have it stuck in their head from 2005 that rogues warriors and mages are the be-all end-all of WoW and it's just not true
---
if we're talking pve then yeah dps-wise they scale pretty hard but unless you're in like the top 1% of guilds the differences really aren't that relevant.  you'll still get through the content with a hunter doing 50 less dps than another mage would have...  most players slack or don't bring consumables or don't do their rotation perfectly etc
---
I'm French so I'm not an expert on US politics as well ;-)

From what I remember they all told us she would be the president for sure.

It was just to make some humor about polls, I don't intend to have political discussions here ;-)
---
So wrath, but not wrath? Doesn't sound like a good idea
---
no
---
https://m.youtube.com/user/SatansHeteroFather
---
Person who I clipped this from.
---
Nope. The answer is troll.
---
disagree.  multiple innervate and combat ress is easily worth it, and druids dont generally HOT much in raids at all.  On last pserver I played i was consistently top 3-5 healing done on my druid and was usually only beaten by 1 particular shaman and a couple of priests.  One druid buffing MoTW on 8 groups is also going to take a long fucking time as you'd have to drink 2 or 3 times to do it, and every time there's a few deaths that's yet more buffing and drinking
---
also, you don't need to coordinate well at all if you're using HOTs anyway.  Raid frame addons solve that problem
---
I think it's broken?
---
0 votes for each class
---
&gt;No flying mounts. (Some work-arounds might be required for areas only accessible by flight - new flight master with one destination placed at those locations)
---
Can we stop this utter bullshit? Or at least contain it for PVP server?
---
I want to soar the skies of Outland when TBC comes out on my PVE server while I fly above the other retards like me with a super 60% speed mount as I jack off and laugh maniacally spraying my seeds over the keyboard for fucks sake!
---
Female troll duh.
---
I had an 6 hour queue on the oceanic servers when they were first released.
---
Hearing lots of EQ sounds in that video. Hilarious
---
The Classic team is just a few programmers. I'm pretty sure there are no artists or designers involved.
---
Even if there are (for a very few little things) it's completely incomparable. Their task is to recreate Vanilla. All the code and data is already done. They just need to put the pieces together.
---
Creating something new is entirely different. The people who created Vanilla originally, who had the vision, have mostly left. Old Blizzard is dead. The sooner you accept that, the easier it'll be.
---
In all fairness, Nightfall should be placed on a Hunter to keep up the proccs with wingclip, since it falls of every 5seconds. It's also to much dps loss for Warrior to hold Nightfall versus BRE. 1.12 BRE proccs is not on boss but yourself, old version is debuff on boss. Yes you might cap on boss armor with already Expose and sunder armor plus Faerie fire. Tho we do not know validations of boss armor In classic yet, either if Faerie fire, sunder and expose stack or not. What private servers have implemented is that it's possible to stack, but what about blizz classic? We do not know that yet. Time Will tell.
---
I still disagree. Basically forcing the players to have to play that version of the game now is a horrible decision. It's what they did back in 2007. Many people won't continue playing after Classic and may just restart Classic on a new server. So the community will be split anyway.
---
We had a corpse in IF called Flameonspot where all the players of the FlameOn guild AFKd.
---
Also, gold sellers used to advertise like this.
---
Creating something new is entirely different (even if there are a few concepts from before). The people who created Vanilla originally, who had the vision, have mostly left. Old Blizzard is dead. The sooner you accept that, the easier it'll be.
---
This is legit how I started too. Had to leave the family PC on downloading, telephone engaged for 5 straight days.
---
Parents went fucking nuts lmao
---
Not decided if i'm going to play horde this time but if i do, i'm going to lie about where she is all the time.
---
That should give everyone who asks in barrens chat the genuine vanilla experience.
---
dont be silly, its easy to find guilds and get in raids if you're a decent player and you get involved in helping guildies and are prepared for raids.  
---
druid is ridiculously strong outside of raids, and imo is just fine in raids.  i played one last time i was on WoW (pserver last year) and i was consistently top 3-5 on healing.  dont let the people obsessed with min-maxing and theorycrafting put you off.
---
if we listened to the "omg its not optimal" people in real life we'd all be insurance salesmen and accountants because it's a stable income and blah blah
---
Right I forgot BRE was a self buff, it makes 2H warrior even worse tbh... I think the best nightfall carrier is an offtank. It's not often that hunters can melee (or melee weave) so it's not that reliable either.
---
I agree that mixing weapons doesn't matter before weapon specializations come online (unless racials are involved). In this post, I want to explore if there are situations where it is beneficial to unequip the OH weapon altogether. 
---
There is the obvious 19% hit penalty that must be compensated by the OH itself. Fighting against Thorns, or enemy parry haste are cases where there's an additional benefit to using a single weapon as well.
---
Hi, /u/Comeeatmeplz
---
For sure, man. Let‚Äôs just talk about min/maxing and how lame people are who want to openly discuss different ideas and opinions. In fact, free speech is pretty dumb. #nochanges!!!!
---
[Imagine having to tell yourself that at night to justify selling your soul hahaha.](https://cdn.sstatic.net/insights/Img/Survey/2018/salary_language-1.svg?v=3f273db9f512)
---
&gt; The constant timegating to hold the hardcore back ruined WoW just as much as the new content push did.
---
The majority of people aren't quitting because &lt;1% of players are timegated. I really don't know what you're talking about.
---
Vi leder selv efter en guild, men du skal v√¶re velkommen til at komme med hvis vi finder en.
---
Druids with WotLK prepatch lifebloom and wild growth.
---
Oh summer child, I said the same thing back in Vanilla.
---
Creating something new is entirely different. The people who created Vanilla originally, who had the vision, have mostly left. Old Blizzard is dead.
---
But let's pretend Blizzard will do something. If they are not completely brain dead, they'll leave Classic alone. They won't destroy it *again*.
---
If we are talking new content, that leaves us separate servers. Basically WoW 2 at that point, starting from Vanilla. That's what a lot of people here want but it's a complete pipe dream. Current Blizzard will *never* create anything resembling Vanilla ever again.
---
What I predict they'll do is create Classic TBC, Classic Wrath, etc. servers. They'll take their time but that'll happen. It's relatively easy and gives a large payoff. Once their favorite expansion(s) are available many people will basically never unsubscribe.
---
Ja det kunne bestemt v√¶re en mulighed. Spiller i prim√¶rt for PVE, PVP eller begge ting?
---
So you are saying that for your guild, you had 2 raid nights, were each and every member used a flask, meaning 40*2 = 80 flasks were used. Black lotus respawns once an hour in vanilla, meaning the whole server has 168 black lotus for a week to use. If you are using 80, then at maximum there can be only 2 guilds on the server playing like you do, while controlling the whole BL market. It's unsustainable.
---
Can I get that in writing?
---
If cyclone was the level 20 talent point in balance instead of Omen of clarity boomkins would become very strong in pvp and might be able to contend with most other classes. 
---
It would certainly help the spec along but it's a dream that will never come true unfortunately. I would take force of nature or anything really to make them a bit stronger. When in reality all they need is some decent itemization. 
---
But if you did this for balance druids you would have to do this for the other hybrid classes and then the game isnt classic anymore. Oh well
---
I made a point to grief one particular guild on the server every time they attempted Emeriss. I would die in the middle of all the healers and / spawn a mushroom and wipe the raid. They never killed Emeriss.
---
Yea, I agree with you that it's worse on bosses if the armor debuffs stacks in Classic. If armor debuff does not stack, BRE is pretty insane.
---
OT really already applies Annihilators so giving a Hunter the melee job isn't big of a deal. Nightfall really is a "lose" 1dps gain 15% spell dmg to casters. And since they weaving it Good with clips they have the highest apply proccs, since it's only up for 5secs. Although the guild need to calculate if it's even worth doing and if the uptime is good versus the dmg increase.
---
Well... [this Toyota commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u15HmEMp2Qc) does exist, which makes it somewhat relevant?.. I guess
---
That's a yikes from me buddy, rose tinted classic goggles or not, statistically WOTLK was the most popular time in all of WoW by far.
---
Several of the things you want to take out are core mechanics of the type of expansion that WOTLK was, and some of them are just outright ridiculous. 
---
Stick to reviewing private servers and and leave the development to Blizzard.
---
Why are paladins son unpopular in vanilla?
---
So BfA is the same game as vanilla then?
---
You aren't a true fan unless you follow his Ion Paper eating videos.
---
welcome to the alliance
---
Not sure at what point in my post I talked about "the majority of players quitting", but okay. I said it contributed to the game being ruined. It's been happening since end game TBC, coincidentally around the time that the sub count flattened out. Odd how these things shake out.
---
Take my $$$$
---
And a talented blind keyboard user
---
Believe me or not, I'm in progress of migrating from ADSL to VDSL.
---
So... byebye my 20Mbps
---
I‚Äôm genuinely curious though. Help a brother out?
---
You're allowed to keep XP locked on trial accounts now? When they first added it I remember you couldn't. So if you played any 19 twinks they'd level up to 20 from BG experience.
---
all but two of them (the cameraman and the bait) were warriors, stealthed warriors.
---
I've heard it's Lithuania that gets high-speed tech first
---
Then, it spreads to Poland and Sweden.
---
But, from my own experience, I can say that it's Africa that gets top speed. To think that I once even exceeded my network card's "max speed"...
---
stop trolling, you horde troll
---
Seriously man. Wonderful guide. I'll be saving this for my priestly needs. I remember being a young dumbass running ubrs 30 times on my lock to try to get my set helmet back in the day. Ended up getting the tier 1 helm from ony before that even happened...
---
That's a hard no from me
---
That's \[Copper Arrow\], infamous for all that CoD scams
---
That would be pretty cool to be fair.
---
The thought of creepy neckbeards whispering my female nightelf for private lapdances was more gross :P
---
1000 years later
---
\&gt; Hey, we've found some ancient Sumerian painting of some IX-technology fortress!
---
Is dungeon 1 gear in at launch? I know set 2 isn't in until much, much later.
---
Can confirm.
---
The main reason is that they are probably not a pure specialist. So they are never going to perform to the same level as a specialist (I.E Warrior tank), that being said, they have significantly more utility. Utility is often overlooked and underappreciated.
---
To be fair, I did the best with what I could assume at this stage. The way I see it, it's better to make some guides with the knowledge that is known and some assumptions, then release improved versions if things are off in the end.
---
Thanks for the fact checking though. It's helping me find even more, better resources for future vids \^\_\^
---
what is that language wtf
---
If you want Classic to be as close to the original as possible you shouldn't want other possible remastered expansions changed. You're painting yourself as hypocrite.
---
Dwarf is master race
---
A) almost every stat is not guesswork, a fairly large amount is yes.
---
And B) It has absolutely nothing to do with how reckoning works. 
---
C) Blizzard didn't deal with anything but set a cap to how many stacks you can have, which is 5.
---
For Skillevel 225+ you Need to be Level 35.
---
For Skilllevel 150+ you Need to be Level 20.
---
For skillevel 75+ you Need to be ... Level 10? Dont know.
---
For Profession in General you Need to be 5.
---
The "true spirit of the Classic project" would be to recreate WotLK as it was, not with changes.
---
And a message on top of the screen, like that Wintergrasp timer
---
" Mankrik's Wife moves in 23 minutes 15 seconds "
---
That doesn't seem right for the US, guarantee they are using offshore salaries for Java developers
---
Would prefer they just stop before TBC.
---
No gear resets.
---
No flying mounts.
---
No dailies.
---
No easymode.
---
Osrs mainly
---
Happily. This epic mount isn't going to pay for itself
---
Update for people checking - I re-discovered a useful website to double check if items were indeed in the game prior to 1.10 (the supposed Phase 5 loot update).
---

Actually used this for a couple of items, then forgot about it and found it again now XD
---
They need to launch classic before you start routing out what foods to give your pet.
---
The helm drops from Scholo, that's why XD
---
Can not say you are wrong
---
Awesome guide! Thanks for the write-up.  I plan on healing raids and dungeons, but would like to PvP shadow. Any quick advice on what dungeons to run for gear (then I can take the wheel and look up gear, etc). Cheers!
---
You could argue that they could make the classes more fun in vanilla without having to release tbc.
---
What about the pre-pre-pre-bis though?
---
Burning Crusade was a good time.
---
And give up on the ring? Not a chance! :P
---
Also remember that druids fight better with paladins as well. Blessing of kings is great for a hybrid. And a shamans windfurry wont affect feral dps. 
---
I like tauren for war stomp since druids are light on hard cc. Nightelves aren't bad with improved stealth and some extra agility. 
---
But as others have said paladins will be frustrating to deal with. Someone correct me if I'm wrong but I think you can protect some of your dots or a root if you cast a low level ferie fire after it. That way a paladin has to cleanse both. As a druid your strengths are mobility and utility. You dont have burst but you can run around and survive forever while you slowly dot/bleed someone to death. Unfortunately paladins have even more utility and wont go down lightly. You would really have to play smart and basically run them out of mana by mixing your feral dps in when you can. 
---
Dueling a paladin would be an extremely long and frustrating fight. Probably best to just run away or get help lol
---
Interesting. I'll add a note in the video description.
---
I can't be certain but for me T0 was available at launch back in Vanilla.
---
And even if it wasn't there are no reason they wouldn't include this set in Classic, it gives you the minimum acceptable gear to enter MC (I'm not speaking of HC rusher that will attempt MC in green gear the first week here).
---
T0 is not very good. Dire Maul blues are usually much better but won't be available before phase 2.
---
Everything you described is exactly what used to happen to me hahaha, I don't think it's a good grinding spot at all
---
I didn't try with any others no. However BRE is kinda overrated because of how much armor pen you can stack in raids anyhow, so I wouldn't be surprised if ashkandi or spinal reaper worked too.
---
I did spec imp slam yes, every point in it is worth 0.1/weaponspeed*melee hit, so for a BRE doing 500 damage hits that's about 14 damage extra per slam, and a bit of rage saved. I did however spec 5/5 in 2hand weapons so I couldn't go full 5/5 in slam. I believe this was my spec: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LbhxkIbZVVuzMgoVo
---
Hamstring can definitely be used to proc flurry but it's a bit hard to weave that in at the right times, for HoJ it's not really worth.
---
Holy pals are one of the greatest
---
probably Yiddish or something like that
---
Sad. Was hoping they would allow updated gear/mounts to be modded in.
---
Carapace Spine Crossbow was added in the dungeon loot update after Dire Maul, which added many rare drops and changed some of the bad uncommons into decent rares for some higher level dungeons.
---
You'd probably want that xbow from LBRS
---
Climbed the hills near Orgrimmar and stood behind the wall by the gate. As far as I recall, I could not cast spells trough the wall, but my warlock-pet would be able to walk trough and kill PvP-flagged people dueling outside the gates.
---
Mind Controlling people into the lava in BRM. Trying to get them as deep/far away from a "safe res". Think I managed to delay a few MC raids. Also, Mind Controlling lowbies in Freewind Post/The Great Lift and jump them off the cliff. 
---
Releasing a number of Doomguard's in Goldshire/Redridge/Crossroads/Razor Hill. 
---
Tricked a lowbie into selling me a pretty decent lvl 19 twink blue for 1g. Can't recall what the item was or how much I sold it for, but I had money for my mount before reaching level 20.
---
Now, about all that corpses in that spider cave in Teldrassil.
---
Are they mocked, or real people who got mad and ragequit?
---
&gt; casting Waterwalking on as many people as possible before we dropped down to Anub'arak
---
Always face you camera directly down and water walking and ... icy thing will have no effect.
---
Bloodelves had Seal of blood that scaled extremly good with weapon damage / AP / tempo Rating and therefore was really strong late game Tbc for rets. Additionally to the damage it did, it also damaged you ... that was actually a good Thing since now you would Need heal and therefore would get mana from it.
---
Alliance Paladins had Seal of Vengence, the one that stacks a holy dot on the enemy. That one scaled with SP and was really strong for protection Paladins (if done correctly you could maintain all 5 stacks singletarget and Switch to SoR to have both seal effects).
---
In WOTLK they gave both factions both seals until like ... Ulduar? Dont remember excactly, but in naxx/Season 1 Paladins still had seal of blood. After that they removed it, prolly because it was to strong in pvp (you could break sheep/sap/disorient and so on if you time your judgment right before the CC hits in, causing u to take damage from SoB and getting you out).
---
RPing a female dwarf as a man is.. strange.
---
Updated description!
---
Det vil jeg meget gerne
---
I am not against new content but you have to think that the majority of players wanted flying mounts and a LFG function back in vanilla and people now say that's what hurt the community aspect of WoW.  Majority vote on content is a tricky thing.
---
I played on a pve sever but had pvp turned on until I ran dungeons and someone asked me to turn it off. 
---
I missed most of the wpvp in vanilla cause I was still leveling slowly. I played bgs endlessly and loved them.
---
I did most of my wpvp in tbc. There were numerous wpvp objectives in the leveling zones that offered xp buffs and stuff. I always fought for them. Most people didnt but I enjoyed "wasting" my time instigating fights and getting killed once more people showed up. I thought tbc had decent wpvp but I had to go looking for it. I'm not sure how pvp servers were though
---
I feel like most people will take forever to get to maxed.  I‚Äôm more worried about the hardcores who only need to grind but already know how to defeat every boss.  A lot of the length of progression in vanilla was trying to figure out how each boss worked.  Was listening to the classic podcast about world firsts the other day, and got a little enlightened about things like the ‚Äúmathematically impossible‚Äù C‚Äôthun and stuff like that.
---
Hopefully the hardcores who one shot all the raids once they‚Äôre geared stick around.
---
Some say that 1h SP ret is actually stronger than the 2h AP Version.
---
Could be quite funny with a reckoning spec in pvp and when you have all the proc on hit effects (darkmoon Card, flamebreath thingy, shadow oil, fire weapon etc)
---
This git petty fast lol
---
On a slightly related note, you could link spells and I think talents in the demo into chat. I didn't check professions, but, I would think it would work if it's using Legion's chat system, right?
---
&gt;My question is, will I have to wear robes/leather as most pre-raid BiS lists i‚Äôve found include almost no plate.
---
Yes. Your BIS chests are cloth from UD Live companied with robe from AQ40. Theres also 2% crit +spelldamage robe from MC thats nice when you dont have world buffs. You are a cloth robe wearing until T3 (and you could argue that its worse than the AQ robe, while giving some utility with tier bonus and crit giving bit more mana back). In AQ40 level gear im using 2 pieces of plate, 3 cloth, 3 leather.
---
T2 gear is \~pretty much not woth using as a holy paladin, so getting that set is VERY easy. Its regarded as PVP/Retri dream set thats given out to those that actually want it. Same goes for T1 set.
---
It's whatever greens and blues you manage to scrap while levelling :p
---
Easy... They launch TBC
---
I like discussing the possibile content that could have been but I do not trust or expect Blizz to make that content. TBC servers are what comes post nax IF the playerbase is big enough to support it (and Blizz want to put effort to that). And even that isnt 100% since classic could stay inte the loop of launching new servers every now and then (although classic will not stay in that loop for over 5 years, something is bound to change during that time)
---
It depends on whether classic will remain classic or will function as a reboot. OSRS was intended to be a classic snapshot of runescape, but over time they decided to make it a living reboot of the game and people have loved it despite having 0 faith in Jagex. I'm personally not a fan of most of the changes made but I recognize that they are the reason the game went from under 10k concurrent players to over 100k. A game that does not change will inevitably dwindle in population until you're no longer playing an MMO but rather with just the same few groups.
---
I had a great time with Wintergrasp and Tol Barad. Believe it or not especially Tol Barad dailies. I was a resto shaman during cata and I ran with a frost dk and a frost mage. Ahh the carnage. RIP Garrosh Hellscream he ant do nothin. #SylvanasNotMyWarchief
---
I do wish I could play Ret but like... I know better, so i'll just a roll a different class entirely.
---
What a shit-hole.
---
Ironforge or bust.
---
You are making a few assumptions about how gearing will work in classic.
---
&gt;Carapace Spine Crossbow &amp; Rune of the Guard Captain
---
isn't out before 1.4, and 1.6 
---
And where's the devilsaur set? 
---
Also there's this item https://classicdb.ch/?item=12082 2hit shoulders that is from a BRD quest. Instead use wrist belt boots chest of beaststalker for the 4set, this is also easier as 2 of them are BoE.
---
I think Polish.
---
Alliance scum cant wait to kill all of you in classic and oh I will.
---
If you have a guild you should be fine really. It's pretty common on pservers for druids to tank with a guildie healer and they spam dungeons and share healer gear.
---
They say patch 1.4 here, DM was 1.3 ?
---
[https://itemization.info/item/18738](https://itemization.info/item/18738)
---
The way I understand it, we get everything added before patch 1.10 unless the dungeon / raid is not released yet.
---
So you don't get DM or BWL gear in phase 1 but everything else is available.
---
I guess we'll have to see once classic is released.
---
Looks like UFO
---
you just did :)
---
Just make sure you keep TSA on the melee and don't roll on their Band of Accuria or DFT
---
That's really cool. So I imagine that Blizzard probably encouraged GMs to play the game on their own time. If so, did they pay for your account and did they monitor it at all or was your private account completely seperate from work?
---
Bonus question: Have you ever received a ticket from a player that you knew or that you've encountered in-game?
---
Going to need some proof on that one.
---
Druid are a ton of fun. They have an answer for almost everything and have so much utility. They're downside is no burst damage and weak hard cc. You dont win a fight by outdpsing anyone, you win by out living them while you dot/bleed them to death. 
---
Your mobility is your greatest strength in wpvp. At any moment you can run away put on some hots continue running around and jump back in when you are ready. 
---
If a druid loses a fight its because he misjudged someone's dps and got bursted or because he went oom. If you play safe and effective you can win most duels and possibly kite multiple targets in wpvp. The best wsg flsg runners as well.
---
Just remember to put some heals on your allies every now and then and use every aspect of your druid kit and you will have an awesome time playing a druid!
---
It will be a cat, so meat or fish I guess :p
---
if your server is lacking tanks you can take whatever you want haha
---
you can easily get exalted with stormwind by level 40. Darnassus is a bit more clutch but you can easily get it by level 50
---
This would be so great!
---
Red alert
---
We did that summon portal over a cliff-murder. Never drowning people though, but I got drowned once.
---
me not that kind of orc
---
I agree with you both, i've also expressed that I would like to have an extended period of time between phases, I just don't see any reason to rush through the experience that will in its own course reach an end. I think their's a benefit to allowing the servers to rest at a stage. Will we see a situation where more casual players can't even hit 60 before servers are moving into phase 2? if so I think that is a mistake.
---
Imagine that! Perhaps I'll write what it is on the back
---
There was some bugs with the system. Like in Silithus the quest in south cave where you kill the woman. If alliance dies in back of the cave, your spirit goes to Westfall.
---
If memory serves me correct, Alliance default GY was Westfall and Horde was Crossroads. Hence Westfall.
---
GvG was the fucking best thing ever
---
Guildwars pvp was some of the best team based pvp i have ever played, and i have played competetive cs for over a decade...
---
I made a 39 ret pally that was easy to gear and a HEAP of fun to play.
---
Most of my gear was from SM.
---
As I said in another comment : 
---
The way I understand it, we get everything added before patch 1.10 unless the dungeon / raid is not released yet. So you don't get DM or BWL gear in phase 1 but everything else is available.
---
So yeah I'm making assumptions, but I'm all for Blizzard adding clarifications (and a release date while we're at it !) ;-)
---
Devilsaur is too expensive and even if you belong to a HC guild that farm them it will be given to warriors and rogues first.
---
I saw the shoulders, but you sacrifice too much stats for those %HIT IMO. And since I reach 9% without them it's fine.
---
It looks like a huge not-so-friendly vagina
---
Hi, /u/monkeybananarocket
---
Its the same composer that made the skyrim soundtrack
---
Although WotLK was the peak of subscribers, the mechanics implemented during the expansion led to the first decline of subscribers in early Cata. Also, the subs were mostly flat during Wrath, which shows that it was only good enough to keep the subs that vanilla and TBC earned. 
---
 [http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ibJJaNnI4T0/UyLWBayUk3I/AAAAAAAAFmk/oAvYUpHCQmw/s1600/WoW+Subscriber+numbers+001+jim+younkin\_b.png](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ibJJaNnI4T0/UyLWBayUk3I/AAAAAAAAFmk/oAvYUpHCQmw/s1600/WoW+Subscriber+numbers+001+jim+younkin_b.png) 
---
For me personally, I un-subbed at the end of Wrath. It was not due to anything from Cata, but from all the negative changes (IMO) that occurred during Wrath. (Easy dungeons, to many raid difficulties/burnout, professions a shell of previous expansions, short leveling experience, etc...)
---
Awesome. I'd definitely like to check it out. I finally beat DS3 yesterday after rerolling multiple times since release. I'm excited for NG+.
---
I would go horde, but then again alliance have ironforge...
---
I see you haven't done trash after twins?
---
I hope you find the strength to be a better person
---
yeah by watching the videos it looks like spellpower paladin deals more dps than normal one but there is not a lot of them and generally I cant find a lot of information about that build
---
Oh god this hit me in the feels. I remember seeing that my computer could download at 400kb/s and I lost it. I was so damn excited and showed off my dank download speed.
---
&gt; ... in 2005. It's not 2005 any more. Many more people will see Naxx this time regardless of phase length. 
---
And that's great, however my point was progressing through WoW up to a certain already has basically infinite replayability for the vast majority of players. That's why 3 years after the game was released, the vast majority of players didn't touch end game content yet they still kept playing the game and subscriptions kept growing.
---
It is true that too little content decreases replayability, but WoW reached the replayability threshold for the overwhelming majority of players WELL before 40 man raids. Imagine if Counter Strike constantly tried to add new guns every month thinking new content = better replayability.
---
&gt;I understand not wanting to rush, but 6 months per phase for content everyone knows is coming is insane.
---
It absolutely is NOT insane. For example, I think the world pvp phase before bgs should be extended even longer. What you seem to forget is that once a phase passes, it passes forever on that server. You'd have to restart everything all over again just to play a phase. WoW was a different game before bgs, let us savor what made it so legendary before forcing us to at best grind hundreds of hours releveling a new character on a new server to play that part.
---
Same thing with other phases. The vast majority of people would like to grind for their gears and actually enjoy it before even better gear is introduced. Let us casually get tier 1's and enjoy it for a few months before restarting the same exact grind all over again. This will not kill the game, only the most hardcore and most vocal people seem to want us to believe this. Most casual players want to enjoy the fruit of their labor, not be constantly left behind. Again, new content does not mean better game, the game is replayable for the vast majority even without any large raids. 
---
&gt;Luckily Blizzard are smarter than that. The raid content you're scared of missing isn't going away this time. Let the people who actually have time to play, play the game.
---
I'm not scared of missing raid content, I want to enjoy the fruit of the raid MORE. For a longer period. I want to sit in each tier with my gear and enchant them all knowing I don't have to do the exact grind all over again by the constant encroaching release of better gear. I want to take all the time I want to world PVP and bg PVP without taking time away to do a raid schedule to slowly regrind the same gear +1 again.
---
Attacking me personally sure is a good way to have a discussion about something /s. 
---
But to finish, yes you do because you can, because it's a game. You're totally OK with killing someone in a game with this sense of honor, but not 5v1 someone. That's not a philosophy, that's your own view of things, which again, doesn't correlate with the way the game developer views it (hence they created PvE servers and hence why they didn't implement a 1v1 only PvP like other games did, e.g. Runescape where if a player is attacking another  you can't attack either of them.
---
Stop thinking you're above and beyond and accept that if you play a game, you play in that game's rules and world.
---
If they were to make a Classic WotLK, then the same rule applies; #Nochanges
---
Can't say im too sure of that myself, though I remember namely the updated sets from scholo becoming quite good which kind of defeats the purpose of delaying Dire Maul.
---
http://classicdb.ch/?item=14637 for example
---
That's the kind of players we are, most of us had at least one herb alt parked at spawn locations, we had a slight monopoly it's true.
---
This is also end of Classic time table, realistically we wouldn't spend more than 2 flasks a week for farm before Naxx since we wouldn't need more than that, flasks for physical DPS for most content generally falls into redundancy as well due to it just being Titans that's useful, and if you're not taking damage anyhow might as well pitch in for the flasks the tanks, healers and casters use. A select few DPS warriors who couldn't keep it in their pants (yours truly included) would run Titans for farm as well since we'd routinely overaggro and didn't want to drop buffs.
---
That would be hilarious.
---
It says -35 mana in your link though :o
---
Laughs in tank reserving dal rend set
---
Polish indeed, Zloty
---
I think they‚Äôre adding garrisons to Classic. #AlmostNoChanges
---
Nah in EQ the number comes after the stat.
---
AC: 13  
---
CHA: -5  
---
WIS: +3  
---
HP: -35  
---
Mana: +35
---
Good thing it is Friday...
---
Mods abandoned this sub?
---
&gt;I'd say they can easily space out each phase by 1/2 year to let us 
---
eally soak in the experience of each phase. 
---
I thought half year between major content release looks good for the casuals... Until I saw the recent schedule. Now half year of hard core PvPers grinding 52+ casuals could be our next *major* fuckup, and should be avoided.
---
seek help my friend
---
Earthshaker on my enh shammy alt was so much fun. I wish I got it sooner
---
Yeah I learned that the hard way too many times.
---
Making content scalable in difficulty completely ruined all immersion of threat to me. I felt like my hand was just being held while I briskly walked on a gear treadmill. There was no sense of ‚Äúthis place is dangerous‚Äù. It always just felt like I had to do a bunch of bs lower level content that was not notable and I would only feel a sense of achievement when I beat it on the hardest difficulty. Furthermore, I find it odd to walk into an epic raid and beat the pants off a boss in LFR boss with no need for any real strategy. It‚Äôs like pi√±ata mode. Then you go in and do it again 3 more difficulty settings. I want a boss to be A CERTAIN LEVEL HARD. That threat should be a standard and those who are lucky enough to conquer it should feel achieved.
---
Jesus, not even out yet and ppl are asking for it to progress past classic
---
I read too fast, I thought the colons were actually semi colons \^\^
---
Mostly agree. I think the first two phases shouldn‚Äôt be that far apart. And phase 3 not terrribly far (to introduce BGs). 
---
What I would like would be something like:
---
Phase 1 - 3 months
---
Phase 2 - 3 months
---
Phase 2.5 (made up) - Add AV/WSG - 3 months
---
Phase 3 - 6 months
---
Phase 4 - 6 months
---
Phase 5 - 6 months
---
Phase 6
---
Keep this meme coming. The haters are all straight up bustas.
---
I want to see is Blood Elves &amp; Draenei added (and their starting zones)
---
Specifically, I want Quel'Thalas added to Eastern Kingdoms without a load screen.
---
Could also add the Karazhan and Zul'Aman raids, and tune their difficulty and gear to be a catchup raid, while maintaining Naxx as the endgame.
---
This would need to be done after a long time of regular classic being out, however.
---
Strange they don't have any updates on [https://itemization.info/item/14637](https://itemization.info/item/14637)
---
Maybe this website doesn't have all the info.
---
If serious, in the past, TBC came out. That‚Äôs all.
---
Shamans don't have a stun.  
---
(Other than stoneclaw totem, which is useless in PvP)
---
I don‚Äôt know how to tell you this... but you‚Äôre outing yourself quite clearly as somebody who wasn‚Äôt around anywhere near WoW‚Äôs launch. I played on spinebreaker and tbc had a 2 or 3 hour queue, I wasn‚Äôt around for ground 0 of vanilla, I joined that around the time MC was released
---
Nah, that just means those people who hit 60 can say 'back in my day we made it through the great war of classic wow'
---
It's a complete misconception that Paladins HAVE to wear robes and other non plate gear to raid. Most responses to this BiS question are in line with current game mechanics and mentality. BiS is not required to down bosses in Classic. Perfect PvE specs are not needed.
---
If you want to be a Bananadin then do it. Want to look badass in tier 2 then do it. Will you be number 1 in heals? Probably not. Does that ultimately matter? No. If it does then wear a robe.
---
People who have played Vanilla and those who never did but roll on pservers are forgetting the toughest thing about raiding- getting 40 people together. And even then, back in the day you'd have those who were honestly not contributing much and we still managed to down bosses.
---
Literally just google "wow subscribers over time" and look at every graph. Subs flattened out in Wrath with all the changes they made. One of those changes they made was in the final phase of TBC with Sunwell, starting to time gate content, and it's been happening ever since. Those two things coincide, along with *many other* changes that made the game worse, but time gating is a thing that players have been complaining about for *years,* and it started properly in Wrath. People can downvote and ignore the truth all they like, time gating sucks.
---
Path of frost?
---
Oh god that's reminding me entirely too much of some SCPs lol
---
If you do, and you intend to raid, I suggest looking for a guild that wants a shadow priest **before** Classic launches. As soon as the release date and realm names are unveiled, people will start to form guilds ahead of time. If you just start playing and then look for a guild, there's a very real possibility that there simply isn't one on your server that wants an spriest.
---
You also have to be prepared to PvP for gear. There's almost no spriest gear from PvE, none of the priest sets are useful for the spec except T2.5 which is just five pieces and comes pretty late. You need at least the blue PvP set as well as a number of BG rep rewards.
---
Yes, and you need SuperMacro addon to actually make the macro work.
---
&gt; You may be doing something wrong.
---
You're saying what I'm saying. /startattack is useless in vanilla, or else you wouldn't need the macro above.
---
[This is probably a bit unrelated...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY5SCHZHj7Y)
---
yea. World of Warcraft..
---
Sure but then you risk making the bosses too easy and having to rebalance outside of the fact gear should be rebalanced for lots of places but that's nor here nor there. 
---
If they continue on the game with a classic wow flair similar to how OSRS has started development on new content (don't see blizz doing this) you could fix it then but I don't think it could / should be fixed any sooner.
---
"I saw the shoulders, but you sacrifice too much stats for those %HIT **IMO**. And since I reach 9% without them it's fine."
---
That 2% hit has a shit ton of weight to it yet you sub in the Warmonger which has shit stats but 3% hit, so which is it?  How much stats do you sacrifice?  
---
This list is more of a GEIS- Good Enough In Slot-
---
A pre-pre-bis is quest shit.
---
Aight. We will see. I'm gonna gnome the shit outta you
---
Could be worse, they could have given it to the faction that had fear ward.
---
Enchanting can disenchant anything at any skill level.
---
Other than that, professions require high character levels before you can learn high level professions, IIRC:
---
Apprentice (1-75) requires level 5.
---
Journeyman (76-150) requires level 10.
---
Expert (151-225) requires level 20.
---
Artisan (226-300) requires level 35.
---
So if I remember correctly, you'll need at least a character level of 20 to make Mageweave bags.
---
I advise play what your friends choose.
---
you're welcome :)
---
Haha, fuck me. I wonder why you are in the minority using ESDF, guess the rest of the world are retards? 
---
Wake the fuck up, and get some fresh air.
---
It‚Äôs mainly YouTube content creators like classicast that are pushing for fast phases and tbc 3 months after phase 6.
---
They need new content for their streams and don‚Äôt care about other players.
---
I think what people don't understand is the majority of players were vetrans who had come from Classic and TBC. If your playerbase was 15 during clasic they're now of full-time working age during Wrath and likely have jobs etc.
---
Blizzard was fucking smart in noticing that their core playerbase didn't have the same amount of time to dedicate to the game anymore, which is why catch up mechanics were established.
---
Don't get me wrong I loved Vanilia and TBC was my favourite time, but for what it needed to be WOTLK was essentially a perfect expansion.
---
Is Sulfuras bis for ret pally?
---
Nobody gets past naxx
---
Link one vod of a top tier raid with a Druid MT. You‚Äôre playing with decadent information.
---
And you were likely alone on that server. If there were another hc guild, you couldn't use 2 flasks constantly because there wouldn't have been enough BL, regardless of how many herb alts you've got.
---
And in bgs... pvp in general.
---
I'm still playing Diablo 2, fuck that I want to play classic forever.
---
If a new player goes to Orgrimmar in the current game, they will be greeted by Warchief Sylvanas, Warchief Vol'jin, and Warchief Garrosh.
---
Blizzard doesn't plan for the future. They will start to think about what happens after Naxx once Naxx is out.
---
Platinum wow is getting better with each video, good job!
---
Last time I played pally, I wanted to be able to fill all roles for dungeons while lvling.
---
First talent you need is Consecration, so first 11 points go to holy and lvl 20 you can tank decently.
---
Then after you need Pursuit of Justice, this doesn't seem much, but it makes a difference, so next 12 points go to ret so lvl 32 you run faster.
---
Then after I'd go ret again because more damage = faster lvling. You don't really need any talents for healing, just use Flash of Light because it's more mana efficient.
---
Oh man, I heard about people getting suspended just for being in Hyjal! You guys were really playing with fire.
---
Worst thing I did was really tame by comparison, but when people would beg me for money, I'd tell them to take off all their gear and dance for it. Then I'd just hearth.
---
For real. All other Classic Youtubers just place a cam in a corner and talk about something boring for 20 minutes, Platinumwow puts so much effort and talks about interesting stuff.
---
If this is a question, I would say I had the most fun with BC.
---
Just remove her but leave the quest in. It‚Äôs been 15 years. I‚Äôm sure the Hecklefang Hyenas would have eaten her by now.
---
Once you have hit cap, crit is the largest dps boost for hunters; to say "apart from crit" devilsaur offers little might be true, but crit is massive. Remember that in vanilla, it takes fifty-three (53!) Agility to get 1% crit. In preraid gear amassing agility is quite difficult. 
---
I like your list for alternatives though.
---
Private servers make the spot a lot harder. I remember grinding there on most of my chars in vanilla / BC when leveling.
---
Private server repack constant casts makes the place a nightmare.
---
Players not doing end game stuff in 2005 is totally different to now, sorry, you simply can't compare the two. It was a different time. The majority of players knew nothing, were bad at the game, hadn't experienced much of the game, had terrible PCs, etc. WoW classic in 2019 is going to be a very different animal and the portion of people who never see end-game is going to be miniscule compared to back then.
---
Yes, phases pass. World PVP will certainly be diminished when BGs hit, but it won't completely go away. Like you said, world bosses are new opportunities. That's what happened in Classic, too. But you're still talking selectively about what YOU want out of classic. What about every single PVE server where world PVP is already limited? Do those people not matter to you? Raid-wise you do NOT need an entire year as you're proposing to casually gear through MC or BWL, that's just crazy. You could do several characters in that time. People will get bored and leave if they have to wait an entire year between MC and BWL, it's a horrible idea, and luckily it isn't going to happen.
---
Mankrik's Wife is dead!?
---
 ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä JMODS WON'T RESPOND TO THIS ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
I never even finished BWL, if I can finish that I will be happy.  Anything after that will just be gravy.
---
You'll melt everything 1v1 in pvp
---
Back in Vanilla days my guild had a Ret pally that was always 1st to 2nd on the raid damage meters. No idea what he did different to every other Pally, but for me he was proof that the class was more than viable. He also rocked people hard in PVP.
---
i have a lot of those
---
Ah, I see what youre saying: "You need SuperMacro to make **/startattack** work."
---
No it's completely wrong, the size of the samplesize barely matters. It's much more important to get an accurate sample size than a particularly large one. This is not a random sample by any means
---
Bedy bedy sneaky
---
DWARF FEMALE
---
Or well... the answer to all questions.... roll a Druid this time.
---
What your describing would push WoW into a sandbox direction. 
---
WoW has never been a sandbox, and was never intended to be.
---
So a new expansion? I don‚Äôt think you understand just how complicated it is to add any content to a game like WoW considering just how many systems it has and how fragile the balance between them is.
---
As well as just how much time it takes to add content at the level of polish you expect from Blizzard even if the player base will be willing to accept the level of polish circa 2005.
---
Sorta. A macro alone with /startattack is a toggle, so it's of very little use to anyone.
---
Luckily, we don't need to worry about these thingsin the 8.xx client
---
Dude, two entire areas were built specifically with flying mounts in mind, there's no work-around for that, only making it worse.
---
Guess you never heard of MadSeasonShow
---
agree with everything here.
---
#nochanges
---
Screw mara farming, we farming stormwind
---
&gt; I'd say they can easily space out each phase by 1/2 year to let us really soak in the experience of each phase.
---
 You really want 6+ months of content droughts?
---
..beautiful.
---
BiS until Naxx hits in -&gt; Might of Menethil and Corrupted Ashbringer are better. Im not sure about like the 2h axe from cthun or the 2h sword from emperors ... since that one actually has a proc aswell, it COULD be better, not sure.
---
But for very lategame it is Corrupted Ashbringe &gt; Might of menethil (slightly behind here only) &gt; rest.
---
In Black Desert Online you‚Äôd lose 2% exp per death, which at low levels is nothing, but the game has no hard level cap. So at the very high end of things 2% exp was HOURS of grinding and you did not want to die. 
---
I‚Äôm currently playing on a super secret server that I have spent A cent ion, where if you die in pvp combat you drop a random amount of gear from either your bag or your equiped slots and it has made pvp incredible. Especially considering the broken builds people have rolled into with every class having (random) access to any ability in the game and access to any talent from any tree. It‚Äôs very fun and probably will tide me over until the classic release.
---
The answer is TBC.  I don't understand why this is still a question.
---
I shall meet you on the battlefield.
---
During the 2.0 patch, my guild and I would countdown and queue for AV. For those that didn't get into the specific bg, we'd have a mage open a portal and we'd spam asking people to help summon our friend Bearmace, a 6/9 t3 tank. And of course people would click the big glowing oval in the crowd of horde bodies and we'd laugh and laugh each and every time.
---
The only classic wow youtuber I subscribe to
---
Also its really hard to get the gear for it and ... yeah have fun taking away the pure caster items from the actual casters.
---
What kind of gear are mid-endgame PVP-Holy Paladins wearing? Judgement Set? PVP Set? Then T3?
---
Or still the cloth gear? I assume no one would want to ignore the plate armor vs. other players? What would the holy Paladin endgame BIS look like?
---
Are we sure that Scarab Lord will be in Classic? It came out with the TBC patch if I remember correctly.
---
If they did some weird upgrade system of being able to go from a vanilla to a BC server would be awesome.
---
Option 1. Level as "DPS spec" or "Leveling spec" and then respec at 60 deep into the healing tree.
---
Option 2. Level with a buddy (known as duo-leveling) and you can be healing spec the whole time.
---
Even in Healing spec, all healers can do damage and do have damaging abilities and are perfectly capable of killing enemies on their own.  They just won't do as much damage as a non-healer and as such won't kill enemies as quickly.
---
They all have DPS specs that you level up with. There's no need to spec holy or resto or whatever until 60, you can heal dungeons just fine as shadow/feral/enhancement/etc. as long as you keep some gear with intellect on it that you can change into for dungeons.
---
&gt; Players not doing end game stuff in 2005 is totally different to now, sorry, you simply can't compare the two.
---
We can compare the two, but you're right in that it's not completely comparable.
---
&gt;But you're still talking selectively about what YOU want out of classic. 
---
I think we are both just giving our own personal opinion here and there's nothing wrong with it. But it does seem like my view resonates with people reading this thread, so perhaps, there is some truths to what I'm saying?
---
&gt;What about every single PVE server where world PVP is already limited? Do those people not matter to you?
---
You're right about this, but I'd like to restate that WoW has basically infinite replayability before end game content. Even on PvE servers, I'm sure people are more than happy to try new classes. That's something I never got to do in the original. Even as a high school student with far more free time than a working adult casual player, I could never really keep up. Ideally, I would have had 4-5 different classes all geared up. But that was an absolutely IMMENSE amount of work. I think you're underestimating WoW's replayability even on PvE servers. But I do agree that perhaps they can move faster to BGs on PvE servers.
---
&gt;People will get bored and leave if they have to wait an entire year between MC and BWL, it's a horrible idea, and luckily it isn't going to happen.
---
Again, my "horrible idea" seems to be heavily resonating with many players. Perhaps we can leave that kind of borderline toxic language out of an otherwise good discussion. You don't need to label my opinion as "daft" or "horrible", you could just make your arguments without it. But again, we can agree to disagree. I think the vast majority of players would agree with me more than you. All I'm really saying is add a few more months in each phase anyway. It lets us grind what we need and enjoy the fruits of our grind. I think this is something the vast majority want.
---
Good Enough In Slot is exactly what I'm going for.
---
I take the sword because it's easily obtainable and there are not many alternative.
---
My vision for this list is I'm fresh 60, I need to enter MC asap with the best gear I can gather in a short time.
---
I assume I won't get much help from my guild since they will be busy gearing up rogues and war.
---
The puppet show was really next level. 10/10.
---
The most common answer is you don't level as a healer. There's zero reason to level 1-60 as holy\resto, so most people go ret\shadow\feral\elemental.
---
Priest is actually one of the faster leveling classes in the game - you go shadow, get a wand, and wand stuff to death fairly efficiently.
---
At 60 it changes, but there aren't a wealth of daily quests to be honest. You'll spend most of your time healing, and if you want to farm gold or do other content you have means to do so.
---
If you want to heal, heal! You'll get dungeon groups almost instantly, there's a ton of pros to healing.
---
For levelling you do not need to be your healing specialisation. You will focus on damage and perhaps keep another set of gear for healing levelling dungeons.
---
At level 60 (when you do spec healing) your concerns are fair. Note the following:
---
- With another set of gear you will be able to do reasonable (not high) damage for grinding etc.
---
- There are other ways to make gold that don‚Äôt involve killing thing (e.g. mining or herbalism)
---
- You can always pair up with another class (e.g. warrior) and make gold well with the two of you
---
Same. I wonder if you can buy them anywhere outside the internet.
---
So once you get 9% HIT you would prioritize crit over AGI / AP ?
---
I did the opposite btw, thinking ranged AP would be better than crit.
---
Is there a formula where I can compare crit to AP ?
---
Hell yes! Play that casino sound upon looting a green item and a jackpot sound upon looting a blue or epic item from a mob! Play a soft pling if you loot 1 herb from a bush and a triple pling if you loot 3 herbs from it.
---
I don‚Äôt really remember the heroics (333ilvl entry right?) being any easier than wotlk heroics, in fact they were harder if anything? You had to use cc in cats heroics whereas you didn‚Äôt necessarily in wotlk heroics.
---
Like other comments have said here, find a leveling spec for your class, and then respec at 60 for healing. Or level with friends and heal the entire time.
---
After Naxx... lol, if Blizzard keeps it vanilla like, most people wont even clear Black Wing Lair...
---
#1. This video is great
---
#2. This video brings back some awesome/terrible memories.  Much respect for anyone who completes the quest line, I‚Äôll never do it again.
---
Y'all need to chill with the downvotes. I literally said it isn't like that heal assist addon. It does have the incoming heal feature which is something nobody had back then.
---
1) Sharding wasn't needed at release and it's not needed now
---
lol yes it was.
---
2) It was a shit show because server architecture... Queues should be fine.
---
lets just forget he immediately agreed that his first point was moot but didnt want to lose the argument.  Now, even with the new server architecture, they still have to use game design different from vanilla to obtain smooth launches. 
---
3) Queues never got that high
---
lol yes they did, for sure.
---
4) You lied.  I played from release on 2nd highest pop US and never had a queue over 600
---
There were definitely queues that high.  If you played 2nd highest pop from release then either you (Darth) is lying or you never played at any kind of high pop event.
---
NE Rogue PVP - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU3JlwyUfys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU3JlwyUfys)
---
How big of a difference does it make if you have or don't have divine int or divine str?
---
Im still kinda unsure if i want to go holy/ret or holy/prot, the first one would have huge def, but ret has more attack tho it doesn't have reckbomb.
---
&gt;Enchanting can disenchant anything at any skill level.
---
I thought that got changed at some point during Vanilla, but surely could be wrong.
---
My main day 1 was and always will be a druid.  But I leveled resto 1-60.
---
It's really not a content drought, if anything, WoW has an oversupply of content well before end game stuff. Grinding up an alt to 60 is easily another 3-6 months of gameplay for most players with real life obligations. The feeling most casual players get is not one of "I'm so bored" but one of "I can't keep up". Most people would love to level up more characters and gear them up but that's basically impossible with new content being released so quickly.
---
I think WoW reached infinite replayability before 40 man raids are even touched. So I think the "lack of content kills the game" argument is completely off base.
---
Anything past 225 requires level 35
---
It's why you sometimes see a gnome corpse lying around for a week in the middle of AH in Orgrimmar :D
---
Until the next server restart...
---
Absolutely a high skill cap. Problem is that you don't need more than 2 in a raid and that's only for tranq shot. Most take 3 as a precaution but recent trends in privates servers have prioritized just 2 hunters. So competition is crazy compared to other classes.
---
That‚Äôs so awesome!! Great job.
---
Great video!
---
Brings back some awesome/terrible memories.  Much respect to anyone who completes it or helps out.  I‚Äôll never do this again.
---
Ah, I did not know respeccing was a thing in Classic WoW. This clears everything up. Thanks!
---
You will wear some robes and shit, but people overstate that.  There is 1 plate spell class, and there is plate spell loot.  There are 3 cloth spell classes, and they will want all the cloth spell pieces.  The only cloth items you will be wearing, are ones you can buy/quest for.
---
I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôre aware... but some people enjoy those 200 hours. Almost like it‚Äôs a part of the game.
---
Interesting take, classic might actually be MORE casual this time around. The prospective audience is older, has more going on in life, and has seen most of the content already. Players might be more interested in just taking their time instead of pushing through asap. Plus with no worries of having the server blown up by the next expansion, much of the pressure to progress goes away.
---
Everyone loves and remembers Vanilla for what it was, and the [lack of] features that came with it. Similarly, everyone loves and remembers the other expansions for what they were. If you go around changing the things people remember those expansions for, it wouldn't be the same game.  
---
While I agree things like heirlooms and LFG made the game a lot easier, it doesn't change the fact that's how it was, and I have fond memories of those days.  
---
Other things like flying were necessary in Wrath because of the level design of the different areas, and if I can be honest, they absolutely nailed the flying in that expansion; flying never broke my immersion to the story or sense of exploration.
---
Found them at Target the other day, gave me a huge dose on nostalgia
---
Its a big question open how it will work Reckoning got changed in classic so many times that we can only wait.
---
For example before the kazzak thingy there where unlimited stacks.
---
Somewhere along the line you could not /sit force stacks anymore but i dont rember when.
---
At some point in time you where able to mount with stacks i think.
---
And i am super sure there where a point in time too where you could even weapon swap.
---
And there where some bugs that did drop the reckoning stacks most of them tided to cc.
---
If i remember right my pala friend did quit around naxx because reckoning was unplayable for him in this state anymore:
---
\- no /sit
---
\- no mount
---
\- most CC had a good change to drop your stacks.
---
\- alot of other events did drop your stacks too.
---
\- no weapon swapping
---
Thanks everyone for the input.
---
League of Legends, a little hearthstone, and some instant 60 pserver to ensure I will play the right class. (As of now, settling on Gnome Warlock!)
---
The difference is, they make between 8 and 10 at a time, almost half a stack unless you're using dire maul water, and it can be made at any time. They don't have to go grind mobs 40 minutes before raid. Warlocks have to do the exact same thing with healthstones too, so it's not even an argument
---
No, both do.
---
Healthstones :^)
---
"That's one small step for a character, one giant leap back for their player's life."
---
It was changed in the TBC pre-patch (2.0.1):
---
&gt; Skill level now determines what items you can disenchant.    
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Skill 1= Level 1-20        
---
&gt;Skill 25= Level 20-25        
---
&gt;Skill 50= Level 25-30        
---
&gt;Skill 75= Level 30-35   
---
&gt;Skill 100= Level 35-40        
---
&gt;Skill 125= Level 40-45   
---
&gt;Skill 150= Level 45-50        
---
&gt;Skill 175= Level 50-55        
---
&gt;Skill 200= Level 55-60        
---
&gt;Skill 225= Level 60-65
---
It‚Äôs a thing but it gets expensive fast. Don‚Äôt want to do it often. Some healers do damage better then others, but yes the best bet is to level mainly as dps and then respec to healer around ~52ish to start healing endgame dungeons (and getting your pre-bis gear). 
---
That‚Äôs if you‚Äôre into that type of gameplay. 
---
Otherwise do whatever you want that will be fun for you!
---
lol this was a great video, especially loved the history lesson stuff haha.
---
Agreed, season servers might be fun to some people, but I would rather not all my progress reset.
---
Yes you can respec at any class trainer.  It does cost gold though.  You can't just switch for free whenever and wherever you want like you can in retail.
---
Sure, we're just spitballing. I still think you're making massive assumptions about what the player base on the whole are going to want to do based on what you want to do. I have no desire to level up 5 characters while waiting an immensely long time for a new raid tier, nor will many others I'm sure.
---
I'm only labeling ideas as horrible and daft, not you. Don't worry, no personal attacks. I just think a lot of your ideas are quite baseless and assume what "the vast majority of people" are going to want out of Classic without any real basis aside from yourself and "people reading this thread", that's all. I'm thinking on a much bigger scale, what the likely largest player base for Classic is going to be (returning vets). I'm thinking about what Blizzard is REALISTICALLY going to do and waiting an entire year before releasing BWL is not it, it's just not gonna happen because it's 2019, not 2004. 
---
But yes, let's agree to disagree. No hard feelings, we're both gonna be playing the hell out of the same game. See you on the battlefield.
---
you can skip almost all of the trash
---
fear ward is not needed to progress in raiding, it's a crutch
---
WOW! That's just cruel man
---
Almost definitely.  
---
Blizzard has already done all the leg-work in putting a team together for restoring the original game and getting servers set up, etc. I'm sure that re-launching TBC or WotLK would be significantly easier at this point, and they would have absolutely nothing to lose by doing this, as long as the players want it.
---
No, 1H SP is terrible.
---
Holy/Ret works well enough as a hybrid RaidHealer + PvpRet spec.  
---
Ret lives in vanilla with burst damage, you want 1000+ damage hits, not two 300 damage hits.
---
You've honed in on flasks specifically while ignoring any and all surrounding factors, Flasks are in actuality one of the lower performance increases (except for casters), mongoose elemental sharpening stones, Fire/shadow power and most importantly world buffs are what boosts you from 700 to 1,700 DPS.
---
As was my main point, "just" dropping your raid's efficiency by 20% is equal to having just about 10 fewer DPS in your raid.
---
There also would be enough, there just weren't that many for the rest of the server population.
---
But even in a scenario where we only supply the casters and main tank with flasks we're still in the 99th percentile as far as efficiency goes.
---
I plan to main hunter with warrior alt to help our on naxx.
---
Str vs Int depends on you, i wouldnt say either is an enormous difference and depends how heavily you want to invest in melee stats. Id say if you go Reckoning then go with Int because Holy Reckoning is more relient on being a healer.
---
If youre going deep Ret, like all the way to Repentence, then Str is a bit favored in my opinion, but not by much. I dont really like fewer points in Ret for a Holy/Ret build though because if youre deep Holy, youre better built for SoR instead of SoC anyways. It really depends how you gear yourself for a ret/holy spec.
---
Why are you bad for so long? Are you sure this isn‚Äôt a you problem? :)
---
almost every drop rate, proc rate, pathing, scripting, is all guess work. you are delusional if you think private servers are accurate for even 80%
---
When he went over the Beacon quests and put Alex Jones' voice on the chicken I lost my shit. Fucking hilarious.
---
yeah you could be the first person in Stormwind but then you are place 1573 in the race to 60 ;)
---
U misunderstood, he was just jokingly making conclusions. Like, if a race that can stealth is the best race, a class that can stealth gotta be the best class right?
---
I'd be down for a whole run through of the expacs again. After Naxx is on farm for most, release TBC.
---
LOL you deleted your last post that was the exact same is this and deleted your username. Man the commitment to trolling is impressive!
---
His Horde brain can only hold so much knowledge. Don't be too harsh.
---
I hope you'll enjoy it!
---
I am just going off of what I read, if it‚Äôs not the case please correct me!
---
Because, warriors with healers are the best at pvp, not many classes even with support can clear UBRS raids almost solo.
---
warrior is like this, they require the most effort but it pays off in the end, in order to steam roll, work for it :)
---
thats insane.
---
I think it helps a lot that you can prepare for example AQ and NAXX for a year. No massive push for consumables suddenly, you can just chill and gather the required stuff along the way.
---
We did raid a MASSIVE amount of hours back then, now in private servers we knock out AQ40, BWL, MC in less than 3 hours. On NAXX release we are doing 2 days to clear out everything on launch week (because instance is launched saturday, so we would only have 1 normal raid scheduled day left).
---
You can be "hardcore", but you wont spend nearly the same hours in the game, you dont just have to.
---
Me saying that set roles aren‚Äôt worried about as much is not the same as ‚Äúnothing matters unless you go for realm first‚Äù. Not many guilds are going to be actively looking for ret paladins and no one is doing a raid with 40 rets but if you are a competent player you will have no problem finding a group at some skill level that is willing to invite you, it just won‚Äôt be a realm first guild (or a minmaxing group).
---
Equally they shouldn't solely cater to retards who take 6 months to level up.
---
I hope your playing a Paladin now to repent for your sins.
---
Haha
---
&gt;"for the first little while"
---
You mean "for the first 2 minutes" ?
---
&gt; It does have the incoming heal feature which is something nobody had back then.
---
Everyone had that back then... Take it from a priest main.
---
Even though I'm rolling nelf and staying in my starter zone, I'm really tempted to make the long journey down to Stormwind just to be part of the train of people who are crossing zones. Wetlands is going to be hilarious when the server starts up.
---
And with my luck I‚Äôd run in there, first in the universe to enter Stormwind, and find a bunch of bank alts already standing around.
---
Seasonal shit. Splinter server where they fully realise the planned extra raids etc. For classic.
---
Yea, iirc you can literally use nothing but a wand from level 5-10 and its basically better than all your spells.
---
Dont wear cloth gear for PvP, your better off with a DPS plate piece with high stam on it.
---
Endgame BiS for PvP is either just T3, but keep in mind T3 Paladin set has almost nonoffensive stats, or a mishmash of T3 and offset pieces to give you a bit more power to fight with. T2 is great for Pally PvP because it gives SP instead of healing, has a ton of Stam and a bit of strength
---
Was about to say this. Having 5 warlocks 6 rogues and 8 mages, that was more normal
---
When does that ‚Äúbest at pvp‚Äù stuff really kick in? After 250+ hours right?
---
I‚Äôm not making an assumption, that is how badly it worked back then and it‚Äôs confirmed by blues that that is how bad it‚Äôll be now (regarding interrupts).
---
As a resto druid you absolutely can beat a shaman. They have the advantage of burst but if you play well you can absolutely kill them.
---
You will never kill a halfway decent paladin. Your damage output as resto can't beat a downranked flash of light + blessing of light.
---
answering the question with a question lol
---
Facing your impending doom... brave one you are.. :D
---
Idk what you think is trolling, it‚Äôs just a help me choose thread that that I meant to edit
---
&gt; you can skip almost all of the trash before Ouro and C'Thun
---
Irrelevant because you cannot skip all of them, just the 4 or 5 at start.
---
TIL having a full time job and other obligations outside of a computer game makes you a retard.
---
Link?
---
I remember I had to fight my parents to buy me this game, and then it turned out you needed to use credit card info to start playing there was an even bigger fight, they didnt really "trust" the internet back then, like using cc info.  
---
Needless to say I purchased ALOT of these game cards.
---
Clearing through Naxx is easily 2-3 years of content. You can then reroll as a new character and do it all over again. Plenty of content already.
---
You're assuming that anyone has ever given the proper coordinates of Mankrik's wife.
---
Stitches, eat a Snickers. You turn into a raging abomination when you're hungry.
---
I still buy them. In Germany we have for 2 months. I just don't see thr appeal that they take every month my money. I play when I want to.
---
Any reason you picked that guild to grief?
---
Can you explain your methodology of the raid composition information, and how you collected and organized the data. Specifically, how many guilds and how you bucket the guilds data (did you count a Naxx guild in all buckets because they've cleared, or only Naxx?).
---
I think this is a great work and provides a window into class demand generally, but I'm finding it hard to believe that average class composition in MC is 0-1 players different all the way through to Naxx. You would think a raid like MC which is pretty easy and accessible would have the largest variance in class distribution, and then tighten towards 'meta' as you approached later content.
---
The big problem is what to add. You could add new dungoens for example at lower levels without much harm, especially to level brackets that are very slow. The problem is can they make them like BRD or will be like retail loot tunnels?
---
That was a good video, I enjoyed it quite a bit :)
---
World pvp never ends. War is eternal.
---
Crafting professions require level 5, however gathering professions can be learned at level 1, or as soon as you can scrape together enough copper to afford them. Herbalism and Mining are useless in the newbie areas, but you might be surprised just how effective Skinning can be when you‚Äôre surrounded by critters like rabbits and deer just waiting to be skinned. Once you have 92 copper, make a quick side trip to buy a Skinning Knife, train Apprentice Skinning, then return to the starter area and skin every critter in your path for a nice source of early income.
---
this feels lacking in a lot of detail, there are plenty of other youtubers that have covered this topic with actual detail for each and every part of the questline instead of just adding models and shitposts
---
using wowmodelviewer and shitposts in a video doesn't magically make it good, how many youtubers are going to bandwagon for views and make videos on this topic
---
Thats just not true. It was hard enough getting people to download CT-Bossmods or CT-Raid Frames in 2005 which were by far and away the most popular addons in addition to a threat meter...  Take it from a paladin main.
---
Are Retri a viable spec for leveling and dungeons? (No need to look into raids)
---
I think it could work rather easy without affecting anyone, just implement a system like Diablo 3 seasons. All original Classic servers stay unaffected while new seasonal servers are introduced. Let's address some issues for this as well.
---
Players will leave OG servers for seasonal thus leading to low population issues. Well this will happen anyway once every one is done with Naxx or bored.
---
When a seasonal server ends, the server will close but characters can be transfered over to a permanent server. This permanent server will consist of characters transfered from numerous seasons. It might not be that populated(or played on much) but it be nice to have a place to reminisce about all your seasonal characters.
---
Every season they could host experimental servers along side of Classic in order to add variety to seasons. Things like bonus xp or start at 60, or even revamp some loot to make some non viable specs more viable.
---
I'm going to put a target on myself, but I enjoy seeing people with the gear that is insanely hard to get.
---
I think it would be cool if Karazhan was presented as having T4 and was outrageously hard. To progress to Karazhan, raiders would have to be fitted with T3.
---
The attunement would be 5 raids within the Caverns of Time and raiders would only be able to use gear presented to them within the Caverns of Time. This would separate their gear obtained in Naxx from the gear they would get in Caverns of Time.
---
Sorry.
---
A journey that never ends is just pointless walk.
---
I think because vanilla is very much a game ever where you can't have your cake and eat it too, every class has drawbacks and they also change through the course of gearing, so it's hard to pick a class that suits you through every stage of the game.
---
For example I love bgs, but there are only a few specs that don't need to respec between raiding and pvp, I also like to min max to an extent. So then you face difficult decisions on if you pick a class that can farm the gold to respec every week, pvp with a raid spec, raid with a pvp spec or something in between, its one if the best qualities vanilla has imo,
---
&gt;almost every drop rate, proc rate, pathing, scripting, is all guess work. you are delusional if you think private servers are accurate for even 80% of item, mob and dungeon data
---
Even if this is true, it's completely irrelevant to this discussion.
---
And ofc you link this miss informed tipsout video jesus christ you guys are fucking sheeps.
---
You make a great argument, and while I have nothing concrete to add in favor or against I will say I LOVED my NE ROGUE. Not for any real meta reason just that he was so cool and my gave me my best WoW experiences.
---
Always envied just about every other classes racials, but people underestimate how handy shadowmeld can be.
---
how is that irrelevant? you said it's "absolutely essential" which it isn't whatsoever, it's helpful yes but mostly a crutch for people managing dispells
---
But asking them to revolve the game around the most casual playerbase is ridiculous. They did that already in retail thanks.
---
lmao i don't even like tips out, read the second paragraph of my post again
---
I liked that warlock/be romancer journal you could find in Alterac Mountains. It‚Äôs been forever so my memory is hazy...anyone know what I‚Äôm talking about?
---
I'm rolling an undead priest and I cannot wait to get stuck in BRD because "just run BRD" is not an option. You don't "just run" BRD. You live in BRD. You move your family to BRD because you can't get out. You have to burn through a queue of bosses that would put most DMV waiting lines to shame in order to complete the instance. I'm still giddy as hell, but what's been described in this video will easily take weeks unless you're a college student with zero responsibilities (like I was when vanilla was live). Great video.
---
No
---
, NEXT
---
This may be the best idea anyone has ever had about anything ever.
---
Think of the meme potential. Imagine finding mankriks wife laid before ragnaros, or northshire abbey, or in the caverns of time.
---
People would constantly be looking for her, always.
---
There is normally a shortage of Dwarf priests, so fear ward is in high demand.
---
All these downvotes simply tell me most of you are completely blind as to what you‚Äôre arguing for. 
---
I thought this would be a chill place to discuss a game we all want to play, damn was I wrong.
---
Warrior is fun that's why.
---
On release they were harder. But loud crying got them nerfed quite closer to WotLK ones shortly later.
---
Thanks this is awesome. You could totally do mage next... you know... If you want.
---
I think a lot of people initially roll shaman but when they get to around 34 and realize windfury isn't all its cracked up to be they reroll. My anecdotal experience is seeing lots of shaman from 1-mid30s then much less 40-60.
---
And tell everyone to keep killing the raptors and the silver will eventually drop
---
Or a good way to force people to res sickness at least..
---
Its really kind of a weird phenomenon to me, and i mean this even about myself.
---
On one hand, with lack of content you complain about too little to do.  Sure, you can level an alt for the 10th time, but for most people that eventually gets boring (Im an altoholic and addicted to leveling, so somehow i still enjoy it.  Most people arent that way, and it even gets old for me sometimes).
---
On the other hand, sometimes i miss only feeling 'compelled' to play my main for raids and some various fun throughout the week (of my choosing.  Maybe its old raids, or getting a bit of rep for the netherwing drakes, or whatever the hell else i did when i started in Wrath).
---
Now theres a never-ending amount of content to do, but for a more serious raider, or even someone that just gives a damn about their toon...well, it can get a bit overwhelming.  Its a never-ending hamster wheel/treadmill, and it just gets old.  I dont even do M+ (poor memory, no guild group to run with, not a fan of dungeons on a timer as the 'norm'), but just doing warfronts, WQs (which i actually dont hate, but take breaks from regularly), weekly quests, etc can get really old, and i dont even do LFR and stuff normally.
---
I really dont know what the solution is, and the 'balance' is likely different for everyone, but its got to be a nearly impossible line for blizzard to walk, at least on retail.
---
I will say though, i dont think it was LFR/Normal/Heroic that directly made it a problem.  In DS i just ran LFR on alts when i was bored or wanted to start gearing them up.  Even for a while after that it wasnt worth it to run LFR (other than *maybe* for a very OP trinket, or if you had been stupidly unlucky with tier or something) once you were in Normal gear, and certainly once you were into heroic gear.  I think even when new raids came out and i was a heroic raider i only did LFR on alts because it was a waste on my main.
---
Frankly, i think thats fine.  Its an option for gearing and can get you used to some mechanics in a role you dont normally play (granted, theyre going to be ridiculously easy compared to the 'real' raid, but its baby steps).
---
The problem now is with titanforging and everything, and the fact that you have a chance of getting an upgrade even from older/'lower' content.  Getting a titanforge feels nice (that dopamine hit, hnnng), but doing content and then not getting the titanforge starts to feel really shitty.
---
Add in the AP grind (which i personally dont really 'grind' for, but its still in the back of your head), M+ (yay, running the same dungeon for the 200th time this xpac...again, i dont really do it, but many people do), and probably some other systems im forgetting, and i frankly dont know how every heroic/mythic raider hasnt burned out at this point.
---
Holy shit this got long winded.  I should get some work done.
---
Ahh you play an h pally sorry. You have 2 buttons üòÇüòÇ
---
Guild leader was an elitist prick, but that guild itself was one of the worst raiding guilds on the server back then.  He was an asshole to just about everyone. I don't remember exactly what he did to piss me off personally.
---
Bit late to respond. I love the Tauren look as well! But i played Tauren Shaman in vanilla, and Tauren pally later. Thought of switching to troll for a fresh experience.
---
Well I think people that wanna speedrun everything will run out of content but the standard players will probably be busy a long time. Yeah now we know better how things work than back then but remember a majority of players never cleared naxx back in the day (for one reason or the other still).
---
I see it too
---
Pre-raid bis is absolutely shit for PVP, too much leather and not enough STA.
---
To answer your question, it takes a long time.
---
If you manage to get the R10 set and a good 2 hander from MC it should be OK.
---
Someone Rule 34 the Quilboar gangbang plz
---
I'll spend hundreds of hours hanging out in front of OG talking to people and flexing in duels. Not worried.
---
&gt;insane
---
why?
---
Brings back memories of trying to explain to my mum. Okay you buy the game, then pay for game time. Endless questions
---
Nope not needed, some people just want it cause they don't enjoy some of the starter madness, so they gladly sack the social aspect of the game for their own safe space.
---
I like how you reduced it to 5 FPS for the full nostalgia effect.
---
&gt;it should be ok
---
That‚Äôs what worries me. All that effort just to be ok?
---
The fear cannot be dispelled tho, so how is it crutch for people managing dispells? 
---
Skipping is irrelevant when you cannot skip all of the packs, so you still have to fight the packs that need fear ward.
---
I keep hearing that Hunter is a high skill cap class and I just don't get that. IF you level with an auto shot addon that shows when you can freely use arcane shot(etc), what more is there really? 
---
I will agree that Hunter has a high skill cap for PvP.
---
What do you mean? There will be phases to classic, you will only be able to complete MC and Ony on launch which will probably last for 5-7 months. So no matter what classic will last over 2 years with fresh content for every phase (which will be 2-3 times a year).
---
Needs moar spikes 
---
^^(/s)
---
I mean, clearly yes, just in the last 24 hours we've got around 5 posts on this topic.
---
Personally, I'm not that worried for now, but other people sure are.
---
1. PvP exist although in "honor" does not come until phase 2, you got plenty of time to farm BiS.
---
2. Warrior is THE best PvP class in BG's if utilized correct with healers.
---
3. Most people chose class after what you want to play in terms of playstyle, not after whats more efficient in time spent.
---
Weeks IS the fast way in Classic XD
---
&gt;that need fear ward
---
you don't know what need means, if you NEEDED them then horde would be unable to do the trash packs
---
I will have to check to see if I still have mine. I started late vanilla, left in cata. I may have boxes for all of them.
---
You and the thousand of bank alts that will run to the nearest capital city ;-)
---
I'm interested in your opinion on hemo being viable with MSP, I have heard rumors of it being good because it didn't get hit by normalization, never seen any proof or math though.
---
None of it has anything to do with reckoning does it? No it doesn't.
---
And for me to list all the miss information in tips outs video I'd be here all day.
---
Yay, i was actually going to ask for a text version.  Glad someone else already did!
---
Well a lot of the items in this guide have dmg and healing, but I'd have to look around.
---
Planning a general caster guide at some point, so keep an eye out for that (though probably not for a few weeks at earliest. This takes a LONG time, lol)!
---
American in a swing state here.
---
This guy is right. Just about every poll showed a 60-40 in Hillary's favor. Keep in mind most of these polls were done in major cities.
---
You can just click unsubscribe when you don't want to play anymore.  It's not a blood pact or something.
---
it does have to do with it because your private server experiences aren't 1:1 as they were on blizzard servers
---
&gt;And for me to list all the miss information in tips outs video I'd be here all day.
---
name 1 thing that is misinformation in the video i linked
---
I raided unhealthy amounts in HC guild, believe me, we used everything.
---
No using owls is a meme, the only unique ability is an AOE threat ability which is completely useless for optimal hunter leveling, cat or wind serpent all the way.
---
&gt; WoW has an oversupply of content well before end game stuff
---
It really doesn't.  Leveling is kind of a slog that takes a long time, but it's not like there are an abundance of quests or other interesting content to pursue.  It's a lot of grinding.  Getting geared in 5 mans doesn't take too long if you have a dedicated guild willing to run instances multiple times per week.
---
&gt; Most people would love to level up more characters and gear them up but that's basically impossible with new content being released so quickly.
---
It's really not...from my experience on pservers people still run UBRS and other 5 mans pretty frequently later into the lifespan of servers.  ZG and AQ20 are built to get fresh 60's ready for the 40 man raids out at their given time.
---
Also, Classic isn't going to be very alt friendly to players who don't have a ton of time.  I don't really think that's a glaring issue.  Focus on 1 main and level/gear another character or two as you have time.  Players become really attached to their main which is good for retention long term.
---
You want / need to play working. A group otherwise you can easily be a free kill even fully geared 
---
Frost Mages are the bane of your existence
---
They are still quite commonly found where I live (Germany). I dont know how much they sell though.
---
What keycaps? Abs or pbt?
---
Definitely interesting.
---
Indeed brother. See you out there!
---
Opps meant to press edit not delete, but, h pal\ ret dont really care. Get over yourself classic takes 0 skill just time
---
Dude yes. Favorited this thread to come back to when I ding 60. Thanks for the guide.
---
Getting to endgame FAST is the last thing on my mind. This is going to be an adventure. I am going to take a while to lvl. I hope more people do the same.
---
Used to know a guy in HS that would do something similar on runescape. Say he's selling coal in stacks on 9999 or whatever and he would take out 9000 and just leave 999 in the trade eindow. Something like that
---
I never even managed to get a character to 60 in vanilla. I'm not worried at all. Not even close.
---
Meanwhile I plan to quickly hit 60 on a lock and after getting some dungeon gear plan to vigalantee with fear spam.
---
Your a hunter farm the gold urself and buy the devilsaur set
---
The first time I watched one of his videos I was like holy cow this guy‚Äôs voice is so monotone and boring. Now, I‚Äôm like yeah get after it Morgan Freeman.
---
Seems a good way to keep the game alive for years, at least on paper. I'm onboard.
---
Thanks man, forwarding this to m'wife.
---
Gonna add to that: Sell all the leather to a vendor, not in the auction house!
---
This way your Mount at 40 will be way easier to get.
---
I'm going paladin purely for all the outside raids fun. I can still tank 5mans. A priest can't, and I can do one of my favorite things which is mass aoe pull low lvl dungeons to boost.
---
Am I worried now? No.
---
Will I be worried in 3 years? Maybe
---
Should you be? No.
---
Look at where we are and where we've come from - either 15 years ago you were playing vanilla, or 2-10 years ago you were playing private server. Those all "ran out" of content too, and people have been so happy with them - arguably one or two in particular - that we're probably here today because of it.
---
I get the passion people have around vanilla - i'm excited too and hoping for "#NoChanges", but we're also starting to move the goalposts and get a little bit entitled. We don't need a solution from blizzard now to F R E S H, and if they don't come up with a "good" one in 3 years, we'll likely all be back where we started.
---
We don't need to be worried about 3 years from now, just be excited for what is coming 3 soon(tm)s from now!
---
Fuck em lol. I had so many grudges across my server being a ranked world pvped. We had one heinous guild that was the top progression guild and I briefed those assholes every chance I got.
---
Horde has tremor totems, what do you have as alliance if not fear ward?
---
Nothing better than running into Org your first time ever with the music blaring.
---
There is always rolling a new alt to level 60! Sometimes people need to balance their life. I wish we can stay on 1.12 for 5 years.
---
Look I'm fed up to give my opinion about warrior and getting downvoted for it.
---
PVP warrior is absolutely not for casuals. You need better gear than your opponents and heals and dispells.
---
Only when you have all that you start to become the PVP god that you see in videos.
---
Even Monkeynews that manage outstanding feats admits that he "always lose against mages and demo" in his YouTube comments.
---
I'd say as a solo warrior with blue gear from dungeons and an arcanite reaper you will lose about 80% of your wpvp encounters. And the one you will win will be because they either lack of skill or their gear really suck.
---
Two years ago I still saw them in one post office when I was in Spain. They also had Steam cards and GW2 gem coupons IIRC, so there is probably still some demand for that kind of service. I think here in Europe it is still quite uncommon for kids to have cards that can be used for paying online, if any at all.
---
This reminds me of this troll on my server called "Funnyguy".
---
He'd spam trade chat with these hilariously stupid jokes and always someone would take the bait. 
---
Questions like:
---
Funnyguy: "Why do they call it an xbox 360?" "Because you turn around 360 degrees and walk away!" 
---
Someone: "You would still be facing it though..."
---
Funnyguy: "Full circle is a 720, idiot LOL!"
---
He did that for months lol. Loved him &lt;3
---
You bring up an interesting concept and back in vanilla, my guilds progress was rather on pair with "best" guilds on our server up into AQ40 and then Naxx. So I missed out on a bit of vanilla content like you said. But I think the playerbase's pacing will be a lot faster in Classic due to their experience and knowledge of everything.
---
So even if I imagine that I'll be ahead of the curve and actually run out of things before the next content patch, I'd be okay with it honestly. Because I do actually like to play other games so I could just take a break and come back when the next patch drops. This could be better for preventing burn-out and helping players who play less to get caught up. And players wouldn't feel rushed into player 24/7 or else they'll be left behind.
---
nothing? we're talking about you saying they're essential and 100% needed in order to clear them, they aren't, you can do it just fine with tanks and offtanks that know what they're doing
---
As a sidenote: In some MMO's this was a real issue. As a healer you couldn't do anything other than heal, so you were forced to group up. In other games healers had much less DPS than everything else but damage dealer players chose to quest solo, making healers a commodity at high levels.
---
You'll get plate gear no problem, don't worry. For pvp you'll obviously wear plate, and you can wear that anywhere outside raiding too.
---
Shamans are good and fun, you will be fine
---
There's a difference between having a full time job/Obligations and highly inefficient leveling.
---
You can get to 60 within a week if you really push for it and even if you play casually you can still reach 60 by week 2/3.
---
If you need 3~6 months to level to 60 then that's fine, but those player should not be the focus of content release as they are not going to be the majority.
---
It will take me months at my casualcore pace to get one toon to 60, let alone have it be raid ready in any quick amount of time.
---
I personally won't run out of content, and I can't believe threads like this keep getting made.
---
It's there, no doubt.
---
Because you cleanse, cast 1 healing spell, judge, and wear cloth. 
---
...but you get to pick an aura!
---
I'm almost always on the opposite opinion of craghack\_tv, so if we both agree on this one you should really take note :D
---
Yeah idk, people seem to love stealing posts and don't credit where it was taken from..
---
Seal of Blood was essentially Seal of Crusader remade in TBC.
---
This is why alliance are alliance. Claiming a 1v5 is a skill hahaha
---
Cats are better for leveling, so my plan is to get a cat instead of an owl at launch.
---
I want to race to 40 on my mage and then camp in Darn to sell portals to IF and SW.
---
I seriously feel like flying didn‚Äôt hurt the community at all. BGs already made WPVP and run and flying didn‚Äôt change that. And I still had people talking in local and say when fighting shit. It wasn‚Äôt till cata that I saw people become entirely mute aside from memers. 
---
Also FF14 has flying and it‚Äôs community feels waaay better than modern WoW.  Hell it has LFG too and I see people talking non stop asking if people have done the raid/trial and saying how to do it.
---
So I don‚Äôt think it was flying and I think it was something else that hurt the community aspect, because even the WoW PTR has a greater sense of community at the moment then retail. I don‚Äôt know what that something else is though.
---
Epic mount &gt; devilsaur set
---
And I have a strong aversion on being extorted money by mafias btw.
---
But why is it called Invincible if I can see it?
---
For this video tipsout talked with a dev from NOST. nostalrius is like 3 years ago so a lot of things are outdated and probably just plain wrong.
---
2:40 Rallying cry along with warcheifs blessing had a 6 hours cooldown in classic but to make buffing less of a pain pservers intentionally removed it especially with the overwhelming population compared to blizzlike. Other than that, for alliance ony is one out of like 4 worldbuffs and tips somehow thinks this will make worldbuffing impossible and "classic raiding will be so much harder without" , without even mentioning that pservers don't allow worldbuffs for new raids, making classic easier.
---
5:15 tipsout talks about dungeon farming being nerfed, making gold farm harder, it wasn't even nerfed that hard and tribute north is still easily possible. Also  says they "added nets to mobs in diremual" which is completely false, there's no mobs in vanilla or pservers that net in diremual. Here he's probably talking about the BRD mobs which had net added in 1.11 and pservers previously used pre 1.11 and now use 1.11. 
---
6:20 tips completely falsely says that pservers don't know how armor reducing abilities scale, this is completely false. And he also says that sunder armor and expose armor stacks on pserver which they NEVER have (deluding people on this reddit to claim pservers mobs has 0 armor beacuse of this, when in fact, tests using combat log on KT showed that he has 1k less armor in vanilla than he did in classic). 
---
At this point im triggered at the amount of false information and i'm done.
---
Yea maybe Blizzard should try making the models of Horde look less fucking ugly and people wouldn't feel forced to use these mods just to get the retardedly OP racials.
---
You sound mentally ill are you scizophrenic?
---
they should purposely make Stolen Silver bugged where they're at it
---
Imagine if you were the first to enter stormwind and then you started recording in cinematic mode...making a time lapse of all the people entering stormwind on the bridge...then used it in a pvp video.
---
I might just do this....
---
This is how to gear for Hunter in classic.
---
Roll need on everything. The GMs will have your back.
---
And the pee streaming out of it
---
I plan on playing 7 hours a week at max... this means a bit of leveling and one dungeon a week. I hope I could see Vanilla Naxx this time, but I do not count on it. I already have a few RL friends to play with, who will take it as slow, because they have a RL that will not give them more time.
---
Check for launch date. Cry.
---
Ooh and the auction house will be empty.
---
Blade of hanna on my warrior at level 58 in scholo. This was super early in the game and I felt like a god.
---
I'd rather die than participate in a MC run where the loot is not set to master loot !
---
Also simple player burnout is always a factor
---
Controversial opinion: slow down progression and then also add in Kara as a lvl 60 dungeon.
---
You people are crazy if you think Naxx will take people years to clear. With knowledge of what you need and how to spec these instances get 9-12 bosses cleared regularly by pretty mediocre guilds on private servers.
---
Vanilla pve was originally hard because the talent trees were terrible for a while and no one knew what they were doing.
---
You're a wrath baby? Classic is not for you.
---
It‚Äôs kinda funny to eat,drink, sit, meld and watch horde run right by you in a BG
---
Death and taxes baby, D&amp;T.
---
a whole new round of "WHER MANRIK WIF" in /yell, hell yeah
---
So, yes.
---
I really think warriors are the most fun class to level.
---
Everything feels good imo. Getting a new weapon, a new armor, new talent choices, being able to tank...
---
The feeling when you manage to kill someone 1v1, the huge benefit you can get from engineering while leveling.
---
When you actually join a healer and engage in world PvP, you feel so much fucking stronger even at lower levels.
---
All of this becomes meaningless as a Druid or Hunter, for example. Your gear/weapon hardly matters and you can easily get through leveling and world pvp.
---
Honestly there's no downside to rolling a warrior for PvP unless you ONLY enjoy lvl 60 pvp and/or stomping hopeless people out there rolling weaker classes without any preparation.
---
So instead of just subbing per month and cancelling whenever you want, you buy 2 months which you cant refund or cancel whether you play or not? Seems logical.
---
Buy 6 months in one go.
---
I remember UO and Meridian59. You could loose your whole inventory and your whole gear. In Meridian59 you could loose Stats and Skills randomly with every death.
---
The older MMOs where insane, no one would want to deal with this shit anymore, but it make you think about every new enemy you faced.
---
I think running for 3-5 minutes has the same effect, but it's not as hardcore. WoW was the perfect balance when it came to MMOs.
---
I remember playing WoW a long time ago  on a trial. I started a night-elf character. Shortly into my adventure, another night-elf came to me, friendly enough, and asked to party up.
---
Well, he led me up a cliff face, and told me to jump off what was obviously the end of the world's geometry.
---
Nice try, stranger from 12 years ago.
---
Is it too late?
---
Path of Frost was the big one because it could wipe the raid, but water walking was muuuuuch harder to notice.
---
Granted, after getting killed once you learned to point your camera straight down every time you dropped down there.
---
Except for the hunters
---
The best is tier 2.5 for 2 handed big crits. If you're a healer tier 3 is infinite mana and spell crits but 0 offense. Tier 2 is shockadin and ret hybrid. The 2.5 is what you want for pvp.
---
Yes, thats why they use the new client for classic.
---
Your a douche quit discouraging people from enjoying classic.
---
Selling portals for the 0c these characters have?
---
Affirmative.
---
I do agree. That was my number one reason for leaning orc.
---
Pretty outstanding. Great job.
---
I believe one of the devs talked about this a while back. They do plan to fix the exploits, cheats and botting vunerablities from vanilla. It's one of the reasons I believe the game is running on the modern client instead of the vanilla one.
---
I'm actually enjoying the conversation now because I'd like to hear and learn what I have misunderstood or been wrong about but I'd appreciate if you continued
---
&gt;1
---
where is the misinformation, world buffs will be irrelevant in retail classic due to time frames and people constantly turning in heads to get quest rewards and not being aware that they provide buffs
---
&gt;2
---
he's talking about private servers (there are multiples but in general most have nerfed dmn farm) this is unrelated to the conversation
---
&gt;3
---
where is the information to say how armor scaled on actual vanilla retail? there is none because it's internal
---
&gt;4
---
&gt;that he has 1k less armor in vanilla than he did in classic
---
your wording confuses me, are you saying he has less armor on private servers (once again, there are multiples, not every server uses default mangos) than he actually did on retail vanilla? that in itself is due to guesswork or like on a popular server (can't name the server or it removes my post) where they intentionally reduced armor values on bosses in raids
---
That's fine theory but in practice people don't like just barely being able to do things, so we call anything that's needed for reasonable smooth and timely run "needed".
---
It's not like blizz refunds you your cash when you unsub, so how is it different from having the 3month sub?
---
r/KenM
---
I haven‚Äôt thought about it that way, most people do go UD for lock. I‚Äôm leaning more towards female orc at this point. I haven‚Äôt gotten into the bulky orc male look. Thanks for posting!
---
I instantly think of rogues sitting on the ah opening lockboxes.
---
On a side note, is the bot detection even any good on retail right now? When I last played during MOP, you'd just see a wall of bots in Isle of Conquest. Has that improved?
---
Nice vid.
---
I agree that most of the BiS lists are either 1.12 or include unrealistic pieces, so I'll be researching my own list closer towards launch for my Shammy.
---
r/badwomensanatomy
---
I don't play retail, but I remember back in Vanilla at the end Chinese farmers were going in instances so they were much less visible than at the beginning when they were farming in the open world. Maybe it's the same case in retail ?
---
I wish Blizzard really managed to kick them out, the economy would be in a much better place.
---
Yeah because thats what i said. You are a Straight up angry moron. You cant read and You cant understand a bit of sarcasm and for some reason You have to go full hostile mode in the first reply.
---
Well there's no bots around because Blizzard sued the p\*ss out of the guy that made the bot and they won, big.  So there's really no option for purchasing a bot because there is now solid legal precedent.
---
Oh man this was so terrible. Mine was also really freaking out about it. I think she caved only because other classmates were gonna play it as well.
---
Come now they will have at least 3s 27c
---
I wonder if it'll be on Spotify.  Im sad their other ones arent :(
---
Back on my server I was made a bank alt named Juicebank, Juice being the best guild on our server and sent out wrapped gift boxes full of junk for 15G Cod, I then looked up as many characters that were currently on. I was sitting in Org and when people started receiving them everyone was going nuts thinking it was going to be spare Loot from raids. It was the middle of the day and Juice made a post pretty quickly stating they did not make it but people kept paying, later I logged back in and I had thousands of gold from them. Then a few hours later a GM messages me and told me although I did not exploit it actually do anything bannable by doing this there would have to be something done, I told him I was role playing my Rogue, he gave me a LOL then told me to take a time out, they banned me for 3 hours. Still worth it IMO.
---
Now had my guild and everyone else found out it was me at the time it probably wouldn‚Äôt have been as funny.
---
Its definitely a challenge I get that. But I dont think a casual who plays every other day for 1-2 hrs would take it easy if he get ganked  several times in his first hour. 
---
And we need casuals if we want this game to be successful.

How do reck bombs work?
---
Thats some facts right there.
---
Everyone watches PvP videos on so many warriors, and think their fucking beasts 1v1 but forget the time and effort spent before into the gear before hitting hard.
---
Monkeynews as you said are high-up in skill as Warrior and tourists thinks its all about the class.

This is also a great read. The first section of it are the events leading up to Vanilla Wow all the way to the portal opening.

I love their articles, they are a bit harder to find these days but if you type in ‚Äúknow your lore Tauren‚Äù for example, you‚Äôll find lots of info on the Tauren.
---
Assuming an average, motivated B tier guild, not minmaxed with 17 fury warriors but also not filled with moonkins and ret paladins, what does the raid comp look like? I figure at least 3 slots for each class, but warriors, rogues and mages probably get many more, whereas hunters and druids probably stay low. I've always wanted to compare that to the "what are you going to main?" graph data.

It'll be good if we can get another survey done ~1 month before release (and if there's a large jump in subscribers to this sub).
---
While 10k respondents is very good for statistical accuracy, the population here (at this point before launch anyway) will not be representative of the actual player population.
---
Everyone here currently will skew towards much higher knowledge of the game, and/or higher hardcore-ness.
---
I'd expect the class distribution of the actual playerbase to shift at least +- 2% on those figures.
---
1519 actually
---
Heals I assume?  ;)
---
Because this is a one time experience player retention truly matters. 
---
For a lot of returning players, and those that are new to the game and just want to see what classic is like, will be looking for a progressive experience. The majority of players who are going to run through classic won't be doing it over the years, they will be replaying through the content trying to get through it as fast as possible. 
---
Many players have seen the content in one form or another at this point in time, and the raiding content is fairly simple. It will not take long to clear the raids and dungeons at max  level once you get there.
---
Of course leveling does take considerably longer than many current players are used to, but a lot of the distractions that players had back in the day will not be in place.
---
As much as people want the game to be the same as it was 15 years ago there will be a lot of things that are different, and the community is one of them. It's extremely hard to foster a good community, and the MMO landscape has changed. Go check out any private server for an example of what the community will be like - it will be a shell of what once was. It's really difficult to recreate the atmosphere of a different time and different place. It's not that I don't want that, it's just that it's realistically not going to happen.
---
People won't be gallivanting off to do who knows what, the feeling of exploration will not be the same as it was when everyone first started playing. Many of the friends and people we all knew probably won't be returning, and guilds are a different beast than they once were. 
---
The main thing propelling the game forward will be a since of ultimate progression. That's something vanilla can get right in comparison to today's WoW. Gear will have significantly more meaning, and it will take much longer to get upgrades. But is that enough to keep players interested in the game? It's not like the game was back in vanilla, there's an end to the progression directly in sight. Everyone knows what's ahead of them.
---
How does Reckoning interact with on hit weapon effects like Sulf or Thunderfury? Do I get extra proc chances for each reckoning stack? Is there an internal cooldown on how often the items can proc their on hit? I'm having a lot of trouble finding reliable info, so thanks in advance!
---
you're right, it helps the efficiency like crazy but it's not needed, faster to have all the dwarfs spam it on everyone instead of having to deal with the issues that arise, question: how does it affect the mana burn?
---
I find this argument is only made by those who never attempted the grind. And frankly it‚Äôs an annoying way to try and diminish the accomplishments of others. 
---
As the adage goes practice makes perfect. The overwhelming majority of players doing the grind end up getting enough practice to be quite exemplary at their class by the time all is said and done. You end up experiencing many different PvP scenarios throughout the course of the grind and you learn to adapt and overcome. 
---
I guess it just makes people feel better to say they sucked and it just took time not any skill.
---
&gt; One classic PvP spec for hunter is Scatter/INTIMIDATION 
---
It's super niche actually, way more so than Mages' Elemental spec. Never saw it in game, just saw a guy playing with it in a PvP vid. Survival is just too good to be ignored for PvP once you got half decent gear.
---
&gt; Priests are not restricted to spriests only. Tri-specs usually get it as well. 
---
Tbh it's the first time I hear about Tri-specced Priests. Putting 5 (!) points into Blackout without being Shadow specced is pretty much unheard of, where have you seen such thing ? Priests have to go relatively deep into their talent threes to get core spells, I do not know what tri spec would look like for them honestly.
---
&gt; given how many praise the HotW build (which barely builds physical stats) 
---
I mean HotW is deep feral, that's literally building physical stats (+str, + attack power, +crit chance etc). There's some points in balance to go further in % of physical damage but Ravage as a HotW can snag half of the HP bar of a clothie ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_vUKklIjC-I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vUKklIjC-I) this guy has the points in balance, but still crits for 2k with Ravage, which would be around 1k8 crit in HotW spec). Also feral DPS scales well with AQ gear and some PvP pieces.
---
&gt; I assumed them losing prio to extra control and bleed.  
---
Yeah well, you're right, the control is something important and better Druids opt for that, but there are many people less familiar with the class who overlook its utility and use solely Ravage. The bleed from pounce sucks though, it's like 150 damage in 18 seconds at level 60, a big joke ...
---
Content plan will keep you pre-occupied for 3+ years. Also, they moved onto TBC when only less than 1% of the entire wow population had cleared Naxx. I imagine by the time we have 30% of the WoW population in full T3, Blizzard will start to think about future projects for Classic if it‚Äôs a success. But I don‚Äôt see this happening until 6+ years down the line.
---
Naturally, other MMOs are going to grab numbers from Classic. If Amazon‚Äôs new MMO is successful I could see it take a huge bite out of the playerbase, but that‚Äôs going to happen when you have a game that‚Äôs stagnant and devs are not progressing. I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it, honestly. You‚Äôll get a great game to play and mess around about in until a great MMO comes out.
---
Yeah. I maybe have 6 hours total to play a week. This game is going to keep me pre-occupied for 10 years if I play it that long.
---
Yeah, wisp spirit.
---
Done did them a heckin‚Äô bamboozle
---
Alts, baby!
---
Wow I remember using this site years ago. Amazing it's still around :)
---
My mother didn't really question it, I remember being super anxious going in the store for the first time and inevitably getting questioned about the game time aspect of wow, miraculously that question never surfaced.
---
True wotlk classic
---
Pls Can you advise why? Do u honestly get more from the vendor than the AH?
---
Really good idea.
---
The mana burn is a disorient, undead wotf doesn't work on it so fear ward is unlikely to work also. I also play horde.
---
Do they let any other Shaman into raids? :P
---
I think they‚Äôre going to stretch the phases even longer this time. You gotta remember that they had TBC working against them last time, so they naturally wanted to get all content out ASAP. This time they‚Äôll more than likely publish it slower and take feedback from the community to when they should progress.
---
There won't be new content after Naxx. Instead, there will be Seasons like in Diablo 3 or PoE. Every 1.5-2 years there will be a new set of "fresh" realms that allows you the opportunity to relive the initial progression and apply previously acquired knowledge to compete on even grounds with other players for "glory".
---
[Amanzon.de](https://Amanzon.de) sells them for 19,99 Euros at the moment. You get 30 days for 10 Euros. Thats cheaper than the subscription.
---
Druids will be accepted to raids. Healers in general are always in demand.
---
Unless you're playing in a really, really hardcore guild, class composition doesn't matter much.
---
There may be many guilds who pretend it does, but you probably don't want to be a part of those.
---
There's gonna be many private server elitists and idiots who just parrot the "you only need 1-2 druids" when in reality the raid will do just fine with 5 druids.
---
It's vanilla content people, it's not difficult
---
He did music for WC3 too, so it makes sense they hired him given the history of the game.
---
Alot of the items he mentioned were updated in 1.10, i guess he assumes we wont have any progressive itemization?  
---
Haven't really been paying attention to blue posts regarding items, has Blizzard said anything about the 1.10 items?
---
Very well done lol
---
You're list is way off, I got 8%hit/8%Crit,104Agi, 290AP on my list without the use of Rune of the Guard Captain and everything is pre-diremaul and pre-itemization. But what can I say other than... you do you.
---
Very much so. One reason why is the main bot that most people used got sued by blizzard and won. I'm sure there are others out there but the big one that most people really used is doneszo.
---
thanks for explaining, my apologies for coming off so aggro
---
I think that'll be what my paladin alt is.  I actually like how the Dwarf females look.
---
Yep. And Mor‚ÄôLadim.  That guy can smell your pussy from a mile away.
---
Poll is not working. I would love to see a holy paladin vid. They require so much plateless armor on the way to 60. I may roll one eventually but I remember paladins often wearing devout gear where they could get it. And it wasn't uncommon to have zero plate on them.
---
trinket swapping
---

---
I'd be really curious to see if crusader strike made Ret OP pvp, it might be an okay fit for vanilla... However, adding a passive deep in the ret tree that let the ret pallies attacks refresh all judgements on the target could let vanilla rets fill a similar raid utility role that they did in TBC and open up the option to let them use JotC for increased damage since now the holies can be the one dropping JoW and JoL
---
I helped an alliance with the turtle follow quest in Tanaris and then killed him right before it completed. I don't feel bad. For the Horde!
---
I agree, migration or copying characters to next-expansion servers would be the best implementation. Also, Blizz needs to slow down the phase releases for classic
---
I stole gold from my friends account. Dont even know what i used it for but it was like 1/3 of his gold... maybe 200-300g. 
---
We knew each others login info. He noticed and asked me and said its okay if i did as long as i pay back. 
---
I denied it, i dont think he believed me. He was a bit pissed but not really mad. Felt bad a few days later and bought gold from a china seller just to give it back to him.
---
Owls in Vanilla were awesome, they had the aoe taunt in screech and had a remarkable armor for a bird.
---
I liked the gorilla‚Äôs too, for warstomp, but can‚Äôt get them till higher level.
---
well, every class is easy in PVE, as PVE in vanilla is really simple...  
---
and in PVP they are all kinda complex, hunter and druid being one of the most in my opinion
---
Wimp.
---
If you need to fill slots it doesn't matter if you have non-ideal specs. It won't matter to 90%+ of guilds, even if they might think otherwise.
---
Vanilla content is fucking easy. Filling out a stable roster is the hardest part, having a perfect class composition is just an afterthought
---
zg and aq20 were literally there for people to catch up.
---
He linked basically the most common PvE combat dagger build and I‚Äôve never seen a dagger build not take 5/5 opportunity.
---
Screenshots from dataminers that got into alpha showed 1.12 stats on gear.
---
Vietnam Flashbacks
---
To here are a real thing
---
Maraudon, and keep all the nature resist you get so you don‚Äôt have to keep running the shit at 60 later.
---
It‚Äôs obvious, they add new content never before seem instead of ruining the game like they did with the ex packs
---
I would tell you why you're wrong, but I have a 200 word essay due tomorrow and I'm just sitting here browsing r/classicwow. XD
---
Urgh, T 2,5 has those vagina shoulders. 
---
Is the PVP set not any good?
---
It is a time-honored tradition to lie about where the corpse is. I usually recommend looking around the north end of the Harpies, which sends them deep into some high-level Slayers. As long as you're sending them way North or way South it's the correct answer.
---
Looks like she's ready to settle down am I right??? BADABUMBUMZUGZUG TSST
---
I tested owl vs cat recently. 
---
Get a cat.
---
Based on what you said i think your in for a rude awakening when it comes to class lol.
---
Did the same thing, swim low enough down that you can't get out before dying with underwater breathing.
---
Boar is a really nice starting pet. No need to rush for an owl.
---
I assume you would pair it with a twohander, even as Holy?
---
Over here you can buy cards that give you exactly enough Blizzard balance for (IRRC) 3 months game time.
---
21/0/30 is IMO funner (and thus better) than any reckoning build.  It does more, and helps more against the classes paladin is weak against.  Reck builds are troll builds to kill warriors/rogues/hunters, all of which pretty much any paladin build can do well against.
---
Just link your list then.
---
I always thought the island south of Tanaris was unused/secret content, I love that I keep learning new stuff about vanilla in 2019.
---
I got to 60 and was pissed about WF!  I rerolled and went back to it as elemental 30/0/21 and farmed some gear and was upset that I ever quit to reroll because of how awesome it was. Those old WF enhancement videos are misleading
---
Hey, 
---
We are based out of Toronto so our raid times will be EST. 
---
-G
---
No. I don't intend to play this forever.
---
I hope folks/Blizz think of Classic as a \~5 year game.  People will stop rushing and enjoy it more.
---
ironic because in vanilla, most everyone who was in naxx bailed on the game right after or during naxx.
---
Not all all, people hadn‚Äôt run outta content when tBC was released. Probably less than 2-4% had completed Naxx, and not enough for all guildies to have all the gear they needed.
---
Yes one of the advantages of using the modern client is much better anti bot tech.
---
I was "that kid" that would walk into a GameStop, put my and down the box, pull the card out, and put the box back on the shelf. 
---
I am not proud of this at all. That being said, one time I did this and the same day, my best friend went to the same store to buy a timecard. He bought an empty box. 
---
He called me right after it happened, accusing me....
---
Surprisingly, GameStop ended up giving him a new one for no charge
---
I'd watch this
---
Nah. Just to wrath.
---
I love vermintide 2 so much, good choice my dude! It is getting me by as well. Working on clearing every legendary map with every class atm. Two down and many started .
---
Those thing used to be sold in dvd-size cases over here. Are you sitting on a mountain of plastic just for the hell of it?
---
I'd be happy to see any of the TBC changes to ret, I'm already committed to making the class work because I absolutely love the fantasy of it but it makes me a little sad that I'm going to be playing a meme spec
---
If they're lucky
---
&gt;your wording confuses me, are you saying he has less armor on private servers (once again, there are multiples, not every server uses default mangos) than he actually did on retail vanilla? that in itself is due to guesswork or like on a popular server (can't name the server or it removes my post) where they intentionally reduced armor values on bosses in raids
---
Wups on this part I meant 1k less armor in classic than on pservers.
---
Go through Wrath then wipe it and start over at classic again.
---
He will do something shady this time around too always a scum bag
---
My friends and I are going to run all the way to the dwarf starting area to get me a white bear. I'm stoked
---
Woah I just realized, at launch you can use other people as meat shields to cross wetlands easily, there's only three mobs that are dangerous from Darnassus after all. Two if your coming from Ironforge
---
Him and Madseasonshow are both great. The others take themselves way too seriously, and just don't have the same charisma. 
---
[Obligatory fuck tipsout.](/spoiler)
---
Hilarious!
---
I would love to have more 5 mans either pre or post naxx. Put the gear on a level thats below the dungeons already existing equivalents at a marginal level so power creep is less likely.
---
5 mans are so much fun imo
---
Pretty much yes.
---
Of course, later on when the Server is online for multiple months/years and the econemy is kinda set, leather will be more valuable in the AH.
---
But at the release of an Server, the AH will be FLOODED with items, especially low Level ones. No one will really buy stuff.
---
Leather is one of the easier farming items. It also is done nearby while just killing animals. The Price for leather at the Trader is quite good aswell
---
Difficulty modes are horrendous. When done properly like XT or amani bear run, they were fine. When right click set difficulty came in, it's just soulless
---
$moo
---
Well, damn.
---
updated
---
Duo leveling is so fun. It may be less efficient but you wont see me in STV without a friend at my back.
---
made a new one
---
When hard packed snowballs could be used on your own team, bnb I spent days in AV with a couple friends just launching people into the alliance zerg. With 3 of us, sometimes we launched people over the zerg, and one time a mage slow called and was out of render distance before he landed.
---
One game we were on vann, and we managed to send the tank out of the room, causing him to evade then wipe the raid. People were pretty pissed. We would also use them to defend frostwold graveyard, which would cause horde an alliance to have to actually fight. 3 people with amazing knock backs along with the npcs there can hold that gym from a lot of people. 
---
Honestly, that was the most fun I ever had in AV. Some people would just get pissed at us, but others would try and get us back, resulting in hugely self destructive snowball fights that were a shitload of fun.
---
They nerfed it soon after, but I can safely say horde didn't get close to winning a single game we were in until they did. And we were in dozens of AV games
---
I‚Äôm fairly certain I fell for this a couple times as a noobie.
---
Those were the days i played an orc warrior named dukavice on elune got to 54(i shared an account with my dad at the time i didnt get my own account till BC launched so my playtime was limited i think the playtime on him was about 2-3 weeks) on him before BC launched. i was about 6-7 years old when classic launched
---
I have 7 hours a week (because family, work, household, other hobbies) at max if I play nothing but Vanilla. A Vanilla dungeon eats up 3+ hours if the people know what they are doing, more if you are in with randos who don't, more if we talk about the higher dungeons.
---
Even if I follow a guide to level as fast as possible (and I don't think this would be fun, because I am also in for the memories not only for being "fast") 6 month are 6x4x7 = 168 hours, that's not much (remember that quests aren't conveniently placed, there is a lot of running back and forth, there are less flight points and no flying on your own at all, some places are bad to reach depending on your faction) , definitely not enough to get raid ready for sure, not enough to have a profession fully up and not enough for having enough gold to buy a horse. To get to  Scarlet Monastery as Alliance player you have to run for 20 minutes straight, hopefully not dying, if on a PVP server it might take much longer because dying is happening for sure.
---
I also would like to do a bit of RP and seasonal stuff when it is there (I can't remember when it first came up, brew festical, Winter thingy etc.). You will also need First Aid, because not every class could heal back then, your class quests, farming reputation for some things, getting the right pets as hunter and levelling them up, having to feed it and having to spent money on arrows, farming with small bags, rare mobs to hard to kill on your own... 168 hours are basically nothing and 7 hours a week are still more than many others might have.
---
Same, do it!
---
I totally get that. I'll be rolling the same main as in vanilla, but my primary alt will be different. I also haven't played since the beginning of MoP except for a little bit this past month, so everything in Classic will feel pretty fresh!
---
I don't understand the downvotes here...Raiding ONLY MC/Ony for 6+ months is a ridiculous ask.  You'll have so much gear it will make BWL trivial.  
---
Same thing for BWL - too much time will allow for grossly overgearing AQ40, etc etc.
---
Slower players asking for the game to be catered around them is ridiculous.  Catering accessibility of endgame content to everyone is what happened to retail.
---
Man, that just shows how great Vanilla was. You knew the best guild on the server and could scam people from sheer respect of that guild.
---
In the patch that Classic will be using on Blizz servers, IIRC, the original "reck bomb" was nerfed from infinite charges (which led to hilarity like the kazzak one shots) to 5 charges.
---
Basically how it works is everytime you get crit, you gain a charge. When you next auto attack, all charges go off at once. The way you do it in pvp is with a /sit macro against a melee class (melee attacks autocrit sitting players), store up five charges (works best against rogues, hunter pets, feral dr00ds) and then hit them all at once with 6 white hits into Hammer of Justice into Judgment. 
---
Its a niche build that kinda only works against classes you would already pretty much win against (unless they just run away) but it is hilarious to 100-0 someone in a global.
---
I know I know but I just don't like to do it. I just buy game time.
---
Dream crushed. But thanks for the serious input! I'm in the camp of not being so serious about gameplay or who to bring and whatnot, but for myself I won't be able to stick to it unless I can be competitive
---
i hope they take down all servers  6 months after nax. Dont let it die slowly
---
This is how they used to gold advertise after the chat bans started heh.
---
My friend gave me his account info back in WOTLK to do a few dailies while he was on vacation. Fast forward 6 months or so, I logged into his account, sent myself all his money after selling all of his raiding gear, and then proceeded to change his password.
---
He obviously assumed he got hacked.
---
Jokes on me though, GMs ended up investigating it and I ended up getting a 3 day suspension because there was an obvious money trail.
---
Thanks for post my video!
---
I bought like 4 of them since I koved ro Germany 2 years ago and found them on gas station.
---
Ran this so many times when I was levelling as enhancement back in Vanilla. So many fond memories. Get hype boys!!
---
You mean they'll have at least treefitty??
---
I think a few might be actually. Several of the dagger skill items gets released slowly. It is what it is.
---
Assuming and pretending sounds fun. Reminds me of kindergarden.
---
Also, none of this will ever happen, and I fail to see the relevance in a Classic WoW sub.
---
Who claimed skill ?
---
I mean part of me does want to use a nice 2h and SMITE people who oppose the justice, but also heal allies and be a support who can also kick some ass if needed.
---
I don't understand you. I like it this way. Please don't judge me.
---
Reck works for on-hit effects such as judgements, so I'd assume it works for weapon on-hits as well.
---
I really want to... but when you make comments like Epic Mount &gt; Devilsaur, I just care less. You've missed 3 set bonuses... brutal.
---
&gt; briefed
---
Oh so your the reason the always got server first huh?
---
Haha sure bud, you realized you were full of it and want to bail. Later
---
Because if you paid for the game time card and dont use the full value, you "lose your money". However if you are subbed with auto payments and canc when you want, then you don't lose any value of paid for but not used time
---
I don't think anything will be slower other than having naxx out longer.  They need to keep people subbed and people will unsub if its just MC and Ony for too long.
---
Don't you usually judge first with Judgement of Light so you get healed for a bunch off each hit from reck?
---
What is dead may never die
---
what? naxx is hearthstone
---
That is a fair hypothesis. I guess it will be tested with Classic. If Classic is very successful with returning players will full time jobs and families, then the mechanics issued in WotLK were an issue. 
---
If the opposite is true and Classic is a small population, then the mechanics issued in WotLK preserved enough of the player base to keep WOW moving forward. 
---
Not sure we will ever know if Blizzard does not release sub numbers.
---
This would actually be perfect for me.
---
[Thunderfury,¬†Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]
---
Haha, I thought I remember owls having an extremely solid data-backed post back in the day. Something about screech being a more efficient focus dump - but maybe it was just a p-server thing.
---
I have always leveled with a cat in the past. I go get the rare ghost cat from Darkshore at level 20.
---
Ice barbed spear at least helps you hit decently hard as a fresh 60.  Still the same story as any other 2h warrior- without a healer you will easily die so you have to pick your spots wisely.  You can still be a relevant part of bgs just not a wrecking ball.
---
Then you go down to Blasted Lands and wait around in front of the Dark Portal.
---
Yup. That's part of why I wanna go for it. Easy early game exploration XP while everyone's fighting over mobs in the starter zones, get those flight paths early.
---
Yea, charge is great for 10-20 or so and then switching to cat seems pretty optimal.
---
Would be nice.
---
I want to add that stacking up said reckoning to use on other classes, like a mage, only need to connect once
---
WASH YOUR TEETH?! ARE YOU CRAZY, THEY ARE BRUSHED MAN!!
---
True, but the average time for someone to hit 60 is roughly 240 hours in game.
---
Blizzard wants to milk this cash-cow as long as possible. They don‚Äôt want to release every phase one after three other or people will blaze through the content and become bored. Anticipation keeps people subbed, getting ready for the next phase keeps people subbed...
---
Did someone say [Thunderfury,¬†Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
---
If youre Reckoning, yes. If not, only if youre 1v1ing really, if youre in a group fight you oughta just heal with a shield on.
---
Well-geared hunters are PVP gods though, especially in world pvp or AV/AB.  You can sit in the back safely out of the fight and do basically infinite sustaining DPS from a safe location.  You also have lots of ways to help your allies with traps or wise use of stings.  
---
Can easily get 2k+ aimed shot crits without crazy gear.  That will always be fun.  You're a clothy assassin.
---
I also run a 20/0/31.  I prefer this variation for the things I do, people I play with, and situations I find myself in:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#sVxuoxZZVfotrcqo
---
It gives up a bit of direct melee power, but allows me to be a bit more flexible with my healing and judging.
---
...what?
---
I agree. Most of us aren't in high school anymore. I don't have much time for games anymore, but I would like to run BWL and Naxx.
---
The truly good content creators will make their own content with what is available. PvP has a ton of potential.
---
Say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker] again. I dare you. I double dare you mother fucker say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker] one more god damn time.
---
The difference between them is very small, and comes down to preference. Sword spec is great...that's the end of the sentence. Also, not sure any rogue strikes reset the swing timer.
---
[The Nicker]
---
Anal [Rend]
---
Excellent point.
---
Wind serpent.
---
&gt; Warrior is the king. If you want to get a spot in the raid and have no problem with the leveling, go warrior.
---
Sure but warriors are literally one of the hardest and slowest classes to solo level.  Grouping more than 80% of the time with a healer or off-healer makes a huge difference but if you can't guarantee this while leveling (ie: ur leveling with a friend) then it's a pretty hard slog to 60.
---
Also just on the druid numbers i find it very unlikely that druid ends up being quite so inflated.
---
Yes yes yes me me me. I'm literally sweating buckets about what to do after 1-1 1/2 years in a game that will release in 3 months. I constantly worry about this because I have nothing else to do in life.
---
They make 10 billion a year mate

Haha, he started the conversation by implying I had never played because I didn't agree with him, all I did was return that sentiment. If that's offensive, he was first.
---
5, might and wisdom can be done by 1 play.
---
depends. apparently /sit macro might only work on private servers, i cant remember how it worked on vanilla now. Could judge crusader first to increase holy damage proc from seal of command/joc, but this is a lot of set up and if they let you get all that off they may literally be a potato with a wifi connection.
---
Sorry, what‚Äôs BiS?
---
* Intended region: NA
---
* Intended server type: PVE
---
* Intended faction: Horde
---
* Intended raid/play times (with timezone): East/Central 2/3 days a week. I am off all evenings but work semi early. Don't want to raid past 10-10:30PM if possible
---
* Any priority you may have in a guild: I will be 60 very quickly as I like to rush endgame. 
---
* Uncertain to which class I will be playing. I am sort of torn between Shaman, Warlock, Rogue. I could probably be convinced to fill a roll in a guild. I am a seasoned vanilla raider and am super excited to get back into the swing of things.
---
* A preferred form of contact: PM would be ideal
---
Is it worth going to school for 2 years to make 120,000 a year for the next 40?
---
Yeah it's pretty much mana efficiency issues as with boomkins.  They can both do competitive dps they just can't keep up on most fights due to mana.
---
As a priest use a wand and you are godmode
---
For the horde!
---
Any suggestions for the 0-10 grind? I‚Äôm looking forward to playing feral as a casual player, but man, those first 10 levels having to cast I‚Äôm dreading haha
---
Damn good point
---
Play what you think is fun. Don't treat it like a job.
---
not really.  Even when they have mana on a short fight they're still not gonna beat any pure dps classes unless they overgear / overskill them.
---
I always hated it, but it‚Äòs a true vanilla memory. Back then i always need to go to a store Manager and ask for The cards cause the one shop that i knew sold it in my hood never had them in stock. Little 14 year old me asking ‚ÄûCan i have a prepaid card for world of warcraft?‚Äú (monoloque in my mind continueing:‚ÄúI am not a gamer nerd, i just like this game and i swear i have friends!‚Äú) 
---
I shamed myself for gaming back then, how silly
---
Sorry not skill ‚Äúbest race‚Äù y‚Äôall put everything under a microscope is amazing
---
One of my good friends played a ret pally in vanilla and he was really good.
---
Dude, just go check pserver raid meters, they're covered in dagger rogues out dpsing sword rogues. There's obviously a ton of selection bias for swords, and they are slightly better on average, but the differences are tiny. So chill.
---
There was a post the other day discussing how to obtain a green 2H axe to level efficiently as a dwarf warrior between lvl 6-10...
---
They can make 100 billion it doesn‚Äôt matter.
---
Do it, just be prepared for groups to not take you pretty regularly over mages or warlocks.  No one is ever saying you can't play something - you just have to be okay with the obvious downsides of a sub-optimal spec.
---
With regional servers on medium or low pop servers it was not unheard of for a few major cities to be empty at very late hours. All of them at once tho does seem unlikely.
---
You are right.
---
&gt; The same one that predicted a landslide victory for Hillary Clinton ? :D
---
It was when you look at the popular vote, which is where polls are great. For electoral college, polls are much less efficient, because even a small error margin, in a low population swing state, can change the final result.  
---
For example, French polls was **very** precise and predict very accurately the final result.
---
Even then a good mage/lock/druid will roll you in a 1v1. Probably other specs as well.
---
In a group, even low level warrior is strong.
---
I think a good 10-20% of the hugely inflated paladin numbers on the polls will deflate once this gets officially confirmed (even though we already know the answer)
---
I kill two dwarves in da mornin, I kill two dwarves at night...
---
But according to some naysayers Classic is gonna be dead in a month
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat, the struggle is real. 
---
And tbf, I only have a debit card now LOL.
---
So, win win for your steal? Hope you don‚Äòt teach your children tho :D
---
Hey, don't listen to this guy, he just hates things he doesn't get. Dagger rogues do fine, you do you.
---
Yeah that can in very specific lowlvl circumstances actually be a dps increase to unequip your offhand, cool discovery.
---
Same goes for any sub-optimal specs.  Of course you can do them, hell go make a shaman tank if you want.  Just don't expect people to necessarily want to pick you over a more optimal class/spec.
---
Yeah,  I wrote that post. "Hunter PSA get a fucking owl" but I've since deleted that account.
---
I still believe Either carrion bird or owl are BIS leveling pets as carrion has 7% armor which is nice to compound with the AP debuff. However there is some debate as to whether or not cats have higher dodge chance, which would mean better efficiency due to kill speed + avoidance.
---
Nothing got me more excited then walking over to CVS, going to the gift card section, and copping one of these bad boys!
---
Do you trust blizzard to make vanilla? These are the same people who are giving you a diablo phone game.
---
I see them at Wal-Mart.
---
I remember running with a friend when it was freezing and snowing, take two busses and run again to the store to get a prepaid card on time before the store closed. Just so we could play all night. And another spoiled friend who got 20 cards for his Birthday and he never used them all.  
---
Ah, memories!
---
This is why I played Runescape before WoW because well 1. I hadn't heard of WoW &amp; 2. I could pay the membership using the credit on my mobile phone
---
Least that way I didn't have to explain it to my parents
---
I mean you take 5/5 if you have the points for it in like a PvP build or something but you don't sacrifice Relentless Strikes or a point of Lethality, the authors of builds that choose it over the other 2 options are unaware with it not scaling up with attack power. It might be the case on classic that the talent works differently but it hasn't been like that in the past.
---
Ask me again
---
I dare you motherfucker, I double dare you
---
Ask me one more god damn time
---
Which one are you referring to because I can only recall one from my memory that got sued and that was waaaayy long ago and others have come to take it's place.
---
I'm not playing a hunter this time around but I made the long walk to Teldrassil to get an owl back in the day. Not cause of some theorycrafting speedrunner nonsense, but because I wanted a goddamn owl pet. Papaya was majestic.
---
REEEEAAWWWWWWWW
---
Every time you get a sword proc extra attack from sword spezi, the swingtimer resets. Which means if you got a sword with 2sec swing, cast SS 1.8sec in, get a proc 0.2/2sec you get 10% literally a 10% haste on that attack.
---
For example you cast SS 0.2sec after swingtimer on 2.0speed get a procc. You earned a hefty 90% "haste" on THAT attack.
---
All that you also running with HoJ increase chances with 2% and HoJ can procc sword spez and vice versa. So yeah very "small" difference tourist.
---
I knew from the second I saw this thread that it would be full of people having absolutely no idea about ret, but writing down what they "THINK" a Ret pala should use regardless.
---
I was not disappointed.
---
The "installer" is not 3.5 gigs back in tbc(2.0 as seen in pic) , that's the full game. An installer is just an interface to download the whole file directly from their server. Usually about 100mb or so, very rarely in gigs even today. The picture you are looking at *IS* the installer.
---
Think about the auction houses, too. Nobody will have any money for a moment, too. There will be no in-game economy for a few moments.
---
Guilty of that on a pserver recently I killed dozens of raptors and was like "I should read the quest text"
---
Derp
---
Yes dad, I have to buy the game, but then I ALSO have to pay monthly just to play it. Oh, and then I have to pay again to upgrade to the new version of the game. Yes dad, it's all worth it. No, they're not going to steal your credit card information.
---
I had a twink level 29 rogue and used to camp the alliance boats from menethil &lt;-&gt; auberdine pretty regularly killing level 10 druids traveling to loch modan or westfall.
---
Welcome home.
---
Yes and set it to that Philip Glass song from koyanisqatsi/gta4 dude. That would be sooo legit.
---
Right in the feels
---
You are incorrect
---
Some realms might be due to tourism
---
It's ideas of adventure like this that sum up classic for me. A long run to a dangerous area through an incredible world, having a great evening laughing with friends the whole way.
---
It can be very good depending on your gear. whitedamage is pretty much irrelevant for retpaladins since most of your damage will come from your holy spells, and from procs like Shadow Oil and Dragonsbreath Chili.
---
Both those consumables use a flat procrate, meaning the faster your weapon is, the more procs you will get.
---
Both Flurry Axe (1.5 speed and chance to get an extra attack), as well as Ironfoe have wonderful synergy with this spec.
---
Your absolutely best weapon to use would be a Manual Crowd Pummeler from Gnomeregan though. If you can be bothered farming them.
---
LF2M Taurens for The Slaughterhouse
---
&gt; All of the 1H SP builds I have seen use bugged items like +Fire Damage on hit gloves
---
Literally not a single build use that. But nice try.
---
Cata could have been one of the best expansions if they didn't nerf everything.. The difficulty at the beginning was tough but fair(ish) and could have easily been overcome after people put some thought into it but nope they nerfed it
---
Its going to be a balancing act but the pacing originally was good except for naxx being out only a short time before TBC
---
It's a relatively new Meta that has only truly been worked on in depth for the past couple of months. You can head over to the discord channel if you want to learn more.

Hehe, yeah saw that one.
---
You are such a negative Nancy
---
You know what I like more than dropping MC clear from 50 to 48 minutes?  Seeing some of the loot not going to waste.  Getting new high scores on my damage because of rarer buffs showing up to boost me.  Seeing my friends and guildmates have FUN.  Did you forget that's the point of the game?  Maybe you've spent too long in soulless guilds that bench you for warlock #9 that does 0.4% more dps than you do.
---
I never played a ranged class, but I remember there was a scope that you could put on your ranged weapon which gave +3% to hit which I think was changed to 3% ranged hit because +hit is OP for melee classes to add to their ranged slot.
---
When did that item come into the game?
---
Shit... I need kids..
---
I have  unopened (if that word even exists)  vanilla collectors edition at my parents house because my brother bought it by mistake 2 times. Might go hunt it later this weekend
---
Oh sweet summer child, repair bills are the least expensive part of raiding.
---
Then correct the misinformation
---
Idk if too many would play again a 3rd time. I don't think I would.
---
Huh, well let's hope so. Over-rogueing is exhausting.
---
I know right? And imagine being a level 5 dwarf doing  some quests, and you exit a cave to find a massive tauren taming a bear, followed by a troll warrior, undead mage, tauren druid, and an orc rogue. 
---
Then on our way back I think we'll do some sightseeing. Maybe go visit the Stonewrought Dam
---
Fun fact: The sounds you hear are not edited in but are modified game files. He hears this as he plays.
---
Its the highest skillcap racial in the history of the game so I wouldn't say its underestimated.
---
Bear til 60
---
and it's full of babies!
---
I used to tank Ony.
---
Ok this has helped me think. Thank you!
---
I hope the game is full of changes like this, so we can experience things for the first time again.
---
Equipping an offhand gives you a huge 19% miss chance, so each weapon goes to 24% miss chance. If you have a good, close to your level MH, but a crappy old OH, then the OH is doing very little damage while giving your main an extra 19% chance to miss.
---
all the underdog hybrid snowflakes will give up and reroll when they can't get through MC
---
Dude what's with the superior attitude ? Either contribute to the thread or get lost. Thank you.
---
I never thought the title of a thread could give me such warm feelings. Beautiful.
---
I can't wait to go home and see you all there.
---
I still hear this one from time to time in retail. Someone always takes the bait. Good times.
---
I'll be playing as a Healer, if there were plenty of groups forming then I wouldn't group with you. If it would take a lot of additional time for me to group up for the dungeon, 50/50 is better than 0% chance of getting the item.
---
Well tell me then what is right?
---
From what Ive seen/heard ist like I said, CA slighty better than MoM and both better than Sulfuras.
---
You can easily heal dungeons until 60 as shadow. I personally out 3 points into renew tho. It's not necessary but I really like to heal people that are not the main tank almost exclusivly with renew so it fits my Playstyle and 15 percent is good.
---
Amazed you didn't get banned for bug exploitation and abusing other players with said bug. Different time, back before the fuck you money they got bought worthy CS.

---
Officer positions are open for application. Especially looking for a Raid leader!
---
Armory was such a dream for warriors
---
So much loot, especially from this guy in particular.
---
That sounds interesting! What was in the collectors edition?
---
Literally one of my main concerns as a kid. The last few days of my sub and how I‚Äôm going to pay for another card. Usually through lunch money.
---
I bought the game with my birthday savings... got home, started installation, *cant play without internet connection* 
---
"Mooooooom, can we please get internet?"

funny how people have been begging for legit Blizzard-sanctioned Vanilla servers for over a decade, and now that its finally about to happen, all anyone can talk about here is how to best min-max things to speedrun through the levelling process with max efficiency to get to endgame raids all in a week or two of vacation time taken off to play a video game. its not even out yet and you're already asking what to do after. ungrateful bastards. SLOW THE FUCK DOWN AND ENJOY IT. Blizzard didn't have to do this. but they did.
---
You shall have my sword
---
I want this so bad it's embarrassing.
---
Yeah, it's only in very specific circumstances for sure. 
---
Even if it's not an actual DPS up most of the time, I thought it's interesting how little you lose in many common gear situations during the early levels. Add to that enemies with Thorns (some quillboar in the Barrens) or similar (like the casters in Darkshore that curse you to heal them on hit), and it might actually be beneficial overall when fighting these.
---
Well yeah, if you do the later 2 instances with the same group you got the key with, you have the key, ie no worrying about forming multiple groups with key. It really helps.
---
I was 14 in November of 2004. My parents wouldn't pay but I called grandma behind their back. Had my sub paid for all the way through TBC. Gotta love the grandparents.

That's not how this works, and that's some odd math. You don't want it to reset your swing timer. Most theorycrafting assumes sword spec just gives the swing, anything else is much lower damage, so you better hope it dosen't reset the swing timer like you say, or that's a huge nerf on pservers. If you start a swing, and sword spec resets the timer, you lost most of that swing, instead of the full bonus of the talent, it just ended a swing early, that's bad. We anticipate the full swing for free. Lets hope you're wrong.
---
no, tbc and wotlk were everyones favorite time playing wow ever. Majority of people loved tbc and wrath, not vanilla. Taking away how everyone's favorite xpac played is a terrible idea.

---
Should have reported your parents for child abuse!
---
World of Warcraft is how I was able to buy my home.
---
On my loan application, I needed to have proof that I was able to pay 3 monthly bills.  The only problem is, I was still living with my parents, and I paid them a lump sum in cash every month for rent, as well as my portion of the bills (i.e. any premium channels I wanted to order, my cell phone, my car insurance, etc).  Monthly cash payments to my parents didn't count, but most things that would be paid monthly fell into this boat.  I only had 2 actual bills that were mine, and not part of this cash payout.
---
I was almost denied the loan, until I said "wait a minute, I pay $15 every month for World of Warcraft."  I got my receipts from Blizzard, and I bought my condo.
---
That was my life man...
---
A character created and placed in a capital city for the purpose of having additional bag space in the bank and as a receiver of mail from your other characters for purposes of listing items on the auction house and/or in Trade Chat.
---
blood also helped with mana regen, since in TBC getting healed = mana.
---
Even in BG's. Meld is just great in pvp.
---
I think waaaay less botting is taking place in Retail because gold is a no-issue.  Neither is leveling time.
---
Fast forward to vanilla.  3 months to hit 60.  7 days a week, 20 hours a day to hit rank 11.  1000 gold mount when everyone is running around with &lt; 100 gold?
---
Cheating/ botting in vanilla is going to make a massive comeback.
---
I hope **Blizzard is prepared**.  
---
Cheating destroys the spirit of the game.
---
Every raid reset.
---
We only got internet because I begged to play WoW. Now I work in IT as a network engineer. I wonder how much different my life might be if I didn't get internet and exposure to computers until later.
---
Can confirm. Most of my IRL friends bailed right before and when I came back most of my online friends were gone too.
---
Ahh ty, I‚Äôve never needed to do that in retail.

---
The gloves come from a quest, and the legs only hunters will roll on it.
---
How much for a devilsaur set nowadays ?
---

300% and 0.4% is not the same thing. If everyone dropped their performance by 0.4% you would not have a drastic difference. If everyone dropped their performance by 300% you would not have 50 min MC clear at all.

Hey, we‚Äôre a bunch of Americans living in China and SEA. There‚Äôs maybe 20+ of us and some friends in EU and AUS we made along the way.
---
We will be playing on the Asia servers (not CN). I‚Äôll be MTing and we definitely need some healers! All of us have raiding experience on our old servers in NA/EU and around 10 of us played some expansions on the CN server.
---
The reason we‚Äôre choosing Asia is because we want an English speaking experience with good ping and timezone fit.
---
We‚Äôd be happy to have you! If you have wechat let me know and we‚Äôll throw you in the group.

It's for people who have a lot of characters. Why login to 5 accounts and look over trades when it can all be done in one login?

According to polls, they are going to be very popular.

Having the internet at home was pretty crucial for me growing up as it helped with homework, research papers, etc.  It's crazy to think it's still not accessible for a lot of people.

---
Really.. what was I farming off of Drakk back in the day? Pants maybe? I duno it was so long ago :D
---
What are you talking about?
---
It gives you an earlier extra attack rather than on your next swingtime which would be every 2sec with a 2.0speed wep. And yes it's resets. 
---
Example: if your swingtime would be every 2sec, you cast an SS 1.5sec in, you proc sword spez an attack lands. You'v "earned" 1.5sec on that hit.
---
On legion/BFA they've actually brought back the need to run to dungeons a little with Mythic/Mythic+. Unless you're a tank, then you can just sit there and people will scramble to summon you.

Well you're just repeating what I said, you are only taking in non-ideal specs because you have to. That's completely different from actively looking to recruit non-ideal specs, which sounds like those joke hunter only guilds.

Owls don't have bite : [https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/family.php?id=owl](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/family.php?id=owl)

And they're not worth wasting 1 or more hours to get as horde then wasting more time at lvl 17 to get a carrion bird for screech rank 1.
---
But if you don't rush lvl 60, want the challenge of steeling a pet to the enemy and have a unique pet for the first 50 lvl why not.
---
It belongs in a museum
---
I'd like to recommend changing "Exercises for that bubble-hearth butt" to "Exorcising for that bubble-hearth butt"
---
Priests should be in very high demand in classic WoW,  it was the main healers then, Paladins and Shamans had a support role, Druids did well - when wearing healing gear (like priest robes).  Druid had a pretty bad dps during all the classic WoW. 
---
I remember I was shocked in the first Burning Crusade dungeon seeing a druid in bear from holding aggro and doing great dps when I as a Warlock + 2 Mages went all out on area dps. 
---
Mages were more sought after than Warlocks, because of the sheep spell and a better AoE. 
---
Will be interesting to see what will happen with Fear, if it works from the start like it did in the last months of classic WoW  - it was nerfed so many times during the vanilla.
---
Rogues were very popular in classic WoW, not a fun time to be a Warlock in pvp. &gt;\_&lt;
---
What did you not understand about subbing per month?
---
I played a Wizard in EQ, and if I was feeling salty, I'd port lowbies somewhere on the opposite side of the world from where they wanted to go.  Probably made a few quit the game.
---
Imagine being affected by the omnipresent negative attitude, that would make one's human I guess ?
---
In Vanilla I was too new to do stuff like this.  In TBC and WotLK?
---
* In TBC my best friend and I would say "LF3M for RFK" and then summon people to Gnomer once the group was full
---
* In SSC my friend would jump down the elevator on his Paladin and time it so his bubble wouldn't wear off before he hit the ground.  The other Paladins would try to copy him and it didn't work.
---
* DI'ing the tank in the middle of a fight is quite funny.  I think the Paladin who did that was drunk and it wasn't on purpose, though.
---
* In WotLK, you couldn't fly during Lake Wintergrasp, but you could fly in before the battle.  Whenever we were defending, I'd land my hunter on top of the wall, and he'd land a healer.  We'd keep the other faction at bay for several minutes before they'd finally get me.
---
* I never did this one, but I really wanted to.  Death Knights had an ability that they could cast on someone that would increase their damage by a boatload, but also take 30% of their max health over 30 seconds.  My guild leader was also horrible at diagnosing wipes.  I wanted to get 2-3 of the DKs in the guild to cast this on Valithria Dreamwalker and just watch as my GM tries to figure out how the hell she's dying so fast.
---
&gt; This is upsetting because now our accounts for our adult email addresses don't have the "street cred" of having played in vanilla. 
---
What do you mean? I just registered the account in my name and email and punched my mother's credit card info. This is on you.
---
As a mage after finishing a pug dungeon I almost always immediately open a portal to Darnassus. 1-2 people in every group would just click the first portal that popped up without looking.
---
Not that bad, but it was an easy and consistent source of entertainment.
---
I loved the TBC talents and skills. Everything else was just a nope.
---
It's a MC drop : https://classicdb.ch/?item=18290
---
Once you get that you can drop the sword and get something better.
---
Vanilla WoW definitely does belong in a museum, but Classic WoW itself is not a museum.
---
Also treasure hunter is a pretty great racial. Especially in a fresh economy.
---
[And now your words are stored in the world's internet archive, so you can't later cry and deny.](https://web.archive.org/web/20190426150852/https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bhi99s/why_night_elf_is_the_best_race/elt4fmp/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

Thanks dude, your support for daggerism did not go unnoticed. Worry not, I won't let my memes be dreams, I'll go out to make daggerist proud, or ~~die~~ be slightly behind trying.

This is good to know, thanks

I‚Äôm still not sure I agree with you. I can‚Äôt find anything, anywhere that suggests getting lethality over opportunity. Here‚Äôs even a good blog post from 2006 that provides some backup for the dps output.

I‚Äôm happy to be proven wrong, but I can‚Äôt find anything to support what you say, and though it was over a decade ago my personal experience differs as well.
---
I don't know.
---
People here seriously think they have to powerlevel from lvl 1. 
---
The server madness of day 1 is awesome but everyone here wants sharding, even no changers.
---
Because from Lv 1 - 59, you play the way you would expect a hybrid melee/spellcaster holy warrior to play.  Enemies flail against your plate armor, you smash faces with two-handed maces, burn the wicked with holy damage, and heal yourself and your comrades when low.  You pass out blessings and cleanse people as you pass them by.  
---
When you hit 60 though and transition to end game activities, you find that your PvE role doesn't jive with what you've experienced while leveling up.  It's a hard shift from melee spellcaster to cloth wearing cleanse and buff bot that throws out heals as well.  For alot of people they weren't really aware of this transition at cap and basically felt bamboozled.
---
Why stop there though? You can stop wherever you want, but some people might want to play later expansions too. I never played Wrath, Cata, or MoP for example, and would like to try them out at some point if I have the time.
---
Sadly yes, sharding is just not something you don't want in a social game at any level.
---
So I looked at your logs and determined that the data was inconclusive, due to questionable sample size, skill inequality, possible lack of dagger rogues. Also it's private server data, so things might be different (from a mechanics perspective) in Classic.
---
Additionally, upon re-reviewing people's responses, I didn't find any spreadsheet math, to my great disappointment. 
---
In summary, I maintain that you might be right, but I retain the opinion and hope that you might also be wrong.
---
Amen üôè
---
Imagine this: Ignore the racials for a while, and pick race based on what you think looks best. I mean, You're gonna be staring at the back of this char for a while, so you better like it üòç
---
Can't hate a guy for making what they can with the knowledge available to them. Clearly people enjoy the videos or they wouldn't get views.
---
It's an engineering schematic that drops in MC. It also costs an arm so you are realistically not going to put it on your ranged weapon until you get Rhok'Delar.
---
Were you on jubei'thos?
---
You might also be able to find discounts on the cards, so that's a plus I guess.
---
We‚Äôre going to be sharded at launch zones so hopefully competition isn‚Äôt to bad it‚Äôs going to be bad but hopefully manageable.
---
Good Lord. Paladin just became way less appealing to me.
---
In short? Yes, yes, yes, and yes. They fall off in AQ/Naxx but meh, you still want a few per raid anyways.
---
TBC was the first of many mistakes, blizzard Should not do it again
---
I'd say it's welcomed if the content is of high quality
---
One day, your parents put you down and never picked you up again
---
A hunter would want both
---
Played Enhance shaman in PVP, and while it was fun getting a 3x Windfury crit and just making squishies disappear, those moments aren't that common.  However, when WF procced, it would still do a decent chunk of anyone's HP if you had a good 2H.  Ele is sorta just like mage burst, 100-0 with cooldowns.
---
I think you need to define "casual" raiding differently than you might be thinking. In my mind it's 2 nights a week for 3 or 4 hours. That to me is a casual raiding guild. And I think we will see a TON of those types of guilds seeing as most of the original fan base are now adults with other obligations. I know for a fact I"ll be looking for a casual experience with those raiding hours. These guilds will probably be focused on just clearing Ony and MC for quite a while after hardcore raiding guilds are already moving on to BWL. I used to be a part of a very similar guild back in Vanilla.
---
Yeah!  They actually gave 3 free subscriptions, so my personal account as well as 2 friends were covered while I was an employee!
---
There was a non official rule not to take tickets from a realm you had a personal account on unless it was absolutely necessary, so I never ended up talking to someone I knew directly, as there was only a handful of times I even took tickets on my own realm.  
---
I did see players I knew in the queue though.  Generally I'd just tell someone on my team, hey I know this person, if you don't mind taking this one and it would be no issue.  The few times I did take a ticket on my realm was by accident and generally didn't even realize it till after the fact.
---
But returns harder and stronger
---
Since the aren't bothering to go back and do all the itemization and patches (becuz 2 hard! or something) I think they should make the game "you rolled a fresh character on aug 22 2006" wow.  All this fake gating of raids, it would be much funnier if some no lifers cleared naxx in 3 weeks.
---
The people's survey does not include a representation of players that will get to 60 and have a desire to raid. While maybe 15% of people want to be a warrior main, what percent of those people want to or can raid.
---
Is there a way to filter the data / class distribution based on users who also selected raiding in the question, " What content are you most excited about? "
---
Only 50% of people are excited about raiding. Keep that in mind.
---
Laughs in Booming Voice
---
Money sync with buying arrows though? My other thought is a mage which ofc it's a mage so yeah they are strong as hell in vanilla. But I can't see myself having fun spamming frost bolts and being a vending machine
---
Bloodlust shamans would break the horde :D
---
Titan grip warriors, hot streak mages, shadow dance rogues.
---
I used to spend literally hours just mind-controlling people into lava and /laughing at them.
---
Agree completely. Never understood TBC hype personally.
---
Wait this might actually be the best and funniest event idea. They should implement this in retail regardless for a week. Every hour the body moves and if you find it you get a token. Then them in for event goodies.
---
I imagine Blizzard will move to seasons after last phase has been out for a while. They love the season approach as it can keep bringing players back again and again.
---
People can and will play the way they want to. I want to min max because it's fun for me.
---
There will be plenty of communities for every type of player.
---
They‚Äôre just imaginary internet points.  I wouldn‚Äôt get so upset over it, k buddy?
---
yeah but not really though
---
100% truth
---
That‚Äôs fucked up.
---
I used to, on my level 40'ish hunter, go to the orc starting zone by climbing up the back cliffs avoiding the gate, tame a level 1 boar, and make it behave like an NPC.
---
noobs wouldnt recognize the PVP markings vs the yellow neutrals since it was like their 1st quest ever and would attack, flag for pvp, and then my cousin who would shadowmeld nearby would 1 shot them.
---
I was a mean teen.
---
Activision stock tanked in the last year.  Some heads will roll.  Hopefully we'll get back to the roots.
---
Ah yeah, altho ofc some shamans do have a stun (warstomp).  Also stoneclaw totem isn't useless in pvp as it will de-stealth anyone within it's range.
---
That and escaping ganks was one of the reasons I always brought invis potions with me. No need for the race with the stylish death animation. 
---
Still a underappreciated racial for hunters and dungeon runs. You can use shadowmeld to wait for feign death recharge between trashpacks.
---
Yeah I think a lot of people forget that a lot of the DPS disparities don't happen until later tiers and some guilds will be farming MC long after hardcore players are getting through BWL.
---
You didn't listen, friend. Wifes and kids, that's the bane of Classic experience. I give thee thy final chance: Make the child farm gold for you &amp; we shall be fair and square again.
---
"Well, I still jerk off manually."
---
We would do the same thing to queue our large group into AV, and then ask the random pug person who was assigned BG leader to relinquish lead to our raid leader, to set up groups, give strats, etc. If the random pug refused to give up lead, we would just have 30+ RCR him simultaneously so he would be automatically be removed from the BG. I think this was in Cata.
---
800 DPS in Naxx is achievable as a hunter, but it's not great in the grand scheme of things. For certain bosses, better classes will approach twice as much damage. Hunters are not as bad as meme specs, but they're among the worst of the "tryhard" specs. For reference, check out [this video of Timecop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YsTAoHwvno), who is widely regarded as one of the best pserver hunters. 
---
Again - I wouldn't worry terribly much about it. Naxx is SUPER high end, you need to invest an incredible amount of time if you want to raid it for progress, and if you're going in with a guild that has it on farm status, your DPS is not going to matter as much. 
---
Elemental Shaman is pretty bonkers. Really fun spec to play, extremely survivable and very engaging to play, as you'll constantly have to adjust to the situation at hand - do you need to support, do you need to burst, do you need to CC, do you need to interrupt? Managing totems is tricky, but fun. Usual spec is 30/0/21 for nature's swiftness. Definitely one of the harder classes to get the hang of, but extremely rewarding when mastered.
---
Well, twice in a lifetime really...
---
Arrows really aren't that expensive. You're the best or one of the best money makers in Vanilla so that's not an issue.
---
You mean bank
---
I don't know for certain but, I think it just has to do with the nature of the faction. The horde is a giant collection of warring tribal peoples. A much higher percentage of their citizens are going to be capable warriors. Where as regular alliance people are more likely to just be farmers. I think the designation of combatant vs. non-combatant existed far before they even added pvp.
---
oh yes! You are correct!
---
Ah I see. Hmm on the fence between hunter or mage atm
---
Time is irrelevant. You can waste 250 hours or you can put them to good use, maximizing your effort towards various goals constantly. As long as you level efficiently (so as to not fall too far behind) and be diligent with mining for arcane crystals and make sure you get some honor each week to keep progressing ranks, you are pretty much set.
---
The paradox is that heavy initial time investment - the harder you nolife - will make the rest of the way like smooth sailing since you can ride your advantage.
---
Same here. I'm playing this the same way I played for the first time:
---
I'm just going to log on and have a good time. I've been away from WoW for so long (WotLK) that I'll be re-learning the whole way. That's the fun in it!
---
There is literally a post asking about hunter basics every single day.
---
Please do 2 seconds of research before making a new thread.
---
No, this time it's different. It has a whole other level of epicness to it. Not saying it's better/worse than original launch, just different.
---
Obviously we are nochanges, bring back game cards, throttled download speed at 700kbs max, 12-16 hour maintenance and random shutdowns with two hour rollbacks
---
Yup TBC was a different era for my feral druid. Got the second tank slot in my guild and cleared everything. I love vanilla, but class balance was not one of it's strong points!
---
Honestly it was part of why i didnt play wow until midway through Wrath, and even then i only had a debit card.
---
Hell, i used my debit card for years.  Didnt get a credit card until....idk, 2015ish?
---
No they stay until the next weekly maintenance and are then cleared (or until a server crash/restart).  Basically the server keeps them there until it's restarted for whatever reason (usually maintenance).
---
Not only can they tank dungeons, but they do it _very_ well.  Especially the undead-heavy ones.
---
Storm scale
---
You are a terrible friend
---
I'd rather rush TN for a Wind Serpent.
---
As a night elf, you die asap and run as a wisp at increased movement speed and res at spirit healer closest to where you wanna go tho
---
There will be no gold on any sever
---
I'm still debating exploration xp vs grouping at level 1 to kill level 5-7's with my friends. So unsure what the best option will be, and both of those could even be invalidated if sharding is impactful enough to give us remotely real mob density early on.
---
you are delusional. people have been doing this on pservers for years and people still have fun... some people dont play classic just for the leveling btw
---
It's just honesty. Every class gets a raid spot. Every spec does not. Many of those specs didn't have proper itemization (feral, prot pal, hunter) or a complete enough toolkit to compete until TBC or Wrath. Some took even longer to become viable in raids, like the long-running joke of Survival and Subtlety dps.
---
I don't meant to be "that guy" but I'm pretty sure server maintenance will still be a thing in classic (#nochanges right?) which means the capital cities will actually be empty fairly regularly.
---
pretty sure that hackers would be the first to set foot in storm wind
---
Indeed, don't need anything else. Keyboard turnings slow, so serves no purpose.
---
This a thousand times. You race through the whole game, then find yourself jumping on a fountain in Stormwind thinking about how you have nothing to do...
---
Fastest levelers, one of the best money makers as you can kill things quickly and solo Dungeons at lvl 60. They are one of the easiest classes to pick up, but the hardest ones to master.
---
In PvE they initially do good DPS in MC and BWL, but they don‚Äôt scale well so it drops significantly in later raids. They are still needed for one ability (Tranquilizing shot), but their numbers drop down so only the really good ones will be taken for high-tier raids. Their rotation is also actually challenging unlike the rest of the DPS classes.
---
In PvP they are very good at world PvP during leveling and even a trained chimpanzee playing Hunter can kill most classes by sicing a pet on it and using Bestial Wrath. I leveled a Warlock on a pserver, and absolutely hated Hunters and felt a special sense of joy when I managed to beat them.
---
However, just like PvE, late game PvP takes quite a lot of practice and a clever use of consumables/engy stuff, but they have a great toolbox of abilities and I they can be a very entertaining class to play if you manage to master all the tricks to it.
---
The cons? High initial competition due to everyone rolling one for easy leveling, a lot of prejudices due to the prevalence of terrible/idiotic Hunter players, low DPS in later raids which makes Guilds picky about their choice Hunters and quite limits their numbers in the roster.
---
I also had a blast with tbc at the time, but really, in hindsight everything this guy said is true for me aswell. I didnt realize it back then, but all this streamlining over the course of many expansion really ruined a lot of the game. For me anyway (and sub numbers seem to agree with me) ü§î
---
I would rather they didn‚Äôt release any expansions.  
---
In fact, if they release even just one expansion, that‚Äôs an instant unsubscribe from me.
---
But I think that if they did release it, this would be the way to do it. Everyone else who thinks otherwise is an imbecile. Why do they even want classic anyway?
---
He doesn't know. Classic internet I know more than you syndrome. Or he's just going to hit you back with information of why everything is better for a warrior and not actually answer the question.
---
YOU DONT LIKE PANDAS?????///
---
That hit me in the feels
---
Good luck gearing 17 warriors
---
This wasn't in Vanilla but in Wotlk. I formed a pug raid for the raid after wintergrasp and the 3 seater mammoth mount drop and i got 3rd place for rolling on it. I just so happened to be master looter. I ninja'd the mount closed game and logged on to a different character. I was like 14 years old at this time. I remember googling my characters name and the first thing that came up was a forum about me doing that. 10/10 still one of my favorite mounts.
---
In the UK they were smart and only kept a display box on the shelf, So I found out you could pull the sticker off with soaking it in warm water a stanley blade and cotton string, Only thing is that it only works a few times as the stores knew my face and would question why I'm buying it to return the next day
---
I'm not entirely sure how you were "left behind"
---
Vanilla was tiered progression, and most raiding guilds that were running BWL still ran MC. Same for AQ40 &gt; BWL.
---
I played and raided on 3 different servers during vanilla and never once had a problem finding a guild that was still running MC/Ony when I started out.
---
The content doesn't go away just because a new tier comes out, and it's not like modern wow where you have insanely easy catch up mechanics to bring you back to top tier to stop into the new raids.
---
I do understand if you are solely talking about wanting to PLAY the top tier raids, but you hadn't geared yourself enough to do it. But the content was still there for you to do, with hundreds of other people still doing it on many servers.
---
I'm looking forward to the fact that these raids are going to be there and I can do them with my guild at whatever pace suits us, regardless of how many guilds have it on farm and are on the next tier.
---
If you have an Etsy or something like that I‚Äôm sure people would buy some classic paintings including myself.
---
I don't know the latest prices, but when I played on a certain pserver a few months ago, the full devilsaur set was only like 300g, you can knock that out in an evening no sweat (I did in 2 evenings on my rogue). Maybe I'm scarred by Asian MMOs requiring 100+hours of grind for one item, but 5-10hours for 2 bis items is basically nothing to me.
---
If you're hitting 10 in 1:20, that's a new world record. I imagine you're playing on a private server with incorrect rates.
---
The lowest time currently I know of is 1:22 in Dun Morough, which is probably the fastest zone.
---
You should record your 1-10 run with xp shown so we can see.
---
This is my mindset. If you can overcome an enemy that would otherwise kill you thanks to missing less due to not equipping an offhand, you will lose the experience of not understanding how to manage and mitigate damage through stuns, vanishes, other abilities, etc.
---
One of the largest parts of Vanilla was understanding how your class works, what is best in what situation, how to manage energy/Mana/damage(input, output), knowing your abilities, getting zen with cooldowns so you don't have to eyeball your bar as often, etc.
---
Managing all those with learning to go with the flow of missing is something that I wouldn't avoid.
---
Yo can w get a copy of the thing
---
There are also going to be guilds that allow for less viable builds, they'd rather have a dependable feral druid than an unpleasant tryhard rogue
---
Private server elitists or vanilla-only elitists are  going to be a thing this time around, pretending as if vanilla content is difficult and if you don't have the proper race/spec/gear/consumables you shouldn't be invited
---
For most people, meters aren't going to matter: nobody is impressed if you top meters in decade old content because you grinded good gear and can spam 2-3 dps skills
---
I think what he's trying to convey is that a lot of casual guilds will be looking for "melee DPS" and having a feral will also help them fill an off-tank role for some of the fights that require multiple. These guilds aren't going to be looking for specific classes unless it's completely necessary. They'll just be looking for dedicated players.
---
I can wait. The level to 60 is a lot harder than people remember, or that classic noobs expect. I don't have the time I had back in vanilla. 45 hour work week, living with a woman, responsibilities. I'll see level 60 sometime in late fall, I expect lmao.
---
The buddy =). I think some may have come out to takes it place, but nothing has been that rampant. A TON of people were using it.
---
Twice as much? I have hard time believing this. Wasn't something like 1250dps what best warrior did at patchwerk? And im not counting in rolling ignite mages.
---
While getting in naxx and clearing it would be timeconsuming, it wont be nearly as rare as it was. Many people have cleared wrath version of it (knows tactics) and many have cleared it on pservers. Also ppl were so bad players then. I tried to find naxx hunter videos and while browsing them i saw that many players in those clips were clickers with 10fps. 
---
Thanks for the info about shaman. Im so tempted to try healing atm that i might go for shaman.
---
Unfoetunately no. But I hope I will find some.
---
I can guarantee you they didn‚Äôt disappear ain vanilla. There were corpses mocking a friend of mine at the MC window for pretty much BWL and until the naxx patch named ‚Äú&lt;name&gt;‚Äù and ‚Äúsucks‚Äù. We even commented on how fucked it was that they were still there when we went back to our old server after rerolling for a few months.
---
Pretty sure I've played in a dungeon with him.
---
Don't forget to give Hogger the whole buff package while playing around in Goldshire.
---
More like dropped on the head in OP‚Äôs case
---
Likewise, though I honestly think we're going to see the later. Where a HUGE amount of players will return + an influx of new ones but then it will drop off slowly with only the most dedicated staying.
---
it's actually quite refreshing to have a civil conversation on opinions that doesn't just divulge into "LOL WRATH SUX" so thanks.
---
Always the classic "click the portal for a buff" as a mage. Worked more often than you'd think
---
I'm actually all for this kinda thing. Quietly moving things to different places in a way that wont really effect game play, but will break guides and routes.
---
More than 4 years ago a person said the following words on deceased Nost forums:
---
&gt; Thankfully there are some people here who haven't forgotten the real challenge in Vanilla raiding was ensuring you had 40 happy raiders who were motivated for long periods of time to log on week after week, not 40 raiders forced to play the "correct spec". If playing a Moonkin makes your raider happy and motivated to stay active for months and months, you are successful.
---

---
As a former recruting officer for a semi-hardcore guild I fully agree with them.
---
Arrow dps margins are pretty small while leveling up so if it's a problem buy the cheaper kind.
---
&gt; One of my frustrations with the original WoW was how constantly behind I was and how I get more behind after every patch
---
I always go through things slowly.  When I actively played in MoP, by the time I finally got inside the valley with my quests, it was already destroyed.  I never got to experience the pre-Garrosh valley.
---
Thanks for this! Clears up a lot. I mean but over all the mages that will be running around might be a good shout to main a hunter. I all about that solo content and I will be playing with a group of friends that are tanks and healers so I can always get a raid spot if I get them in to (hopefully haha). They just seem a lot more interesting to me then standing casting frost bolts for the whole of vanilla
---
Hell yeah, verycoolguy! Bane of orcs everywhere!
---
back when i played EQ a guild on our server blocked us out of end game content by waking up at all hours to kill a boss that spawned semi randomly.. this blocked us from getting into plane of time which was uber annoying..
---
we finally got him on Saturday morning at like 7am..
---
Do not stare at my grave and cry, I am not there, I did not die
---
Got ya thanks!
---
Genial! I stay silent.
---
Yeah, or go engineering and make 'em, since Engi has other uses at the same time and there's zero BoP leatherworking items you need.
---
Im not sure, actually. The cloth turn ins I seem to remember appearing sometime in vanilla. But whether or not you are on the war effort the cloth turn ins remain.
---
I want to experience MoP pre-Garrosh destruction.  When I actively played back then, I always slowly worked my way through the quests.  When I finally made it to the valley, Garrosh had already destroyed everything
---
my Troll Druid would like to have a word with you.
---
Fuck tbc. New content in azeroth or bust.
---
You really think they're going to have a full development staff for new content post-Naxx while also developing new content for retail?
---
Also, TBC was great.
---
If it‚Äôs blue it‚Äôs through
---
Nah it's called world or WARcraft for a reason
---
jea same thing for me sadly, i guess reckoning will be near useless and with it open pvp with pala is not rly possible (even with it pala isnt that strong).
---
You think I like leveling? I just want to pvp, i hate grinding. My point the whole entire time is, why follow a guide that tells you how to play the game for you making it feel like homework? Sure use some guides for gearing and such, but imagine a guide that plays the game for you making it feel like a chore. "Do this quest, now u hit 60." "Now go to BWL and farm for 6 hours." "Now i want you to pick up engineering", that isnt fun and no one has ever had fun doing that. People cry about getting rep on retail feeling like a chore and homework, meanwhile you kids are following a step by step guide on how to play the game and what to do.
---
RAD!
---
&gt;I feel bad for the new players who want to play Retadin or Enhancement Shaman or Feral Druid but stop themselves from doing what they want in a game they **pay for** because this subreddit puts viability on a pedestal.
---
It's for their own good.
---
You don't want them getting ideas of "yeah I'm gonna be a RET PALADIN and do LEET DEEPS!" and then spend the time grinding a Paladin to 60 only to have everyone reject them from groups/guilds because in reality Ret is awful DPS.
---
Really now? So why are there only Vanilla private servers? Why are we even bothering with WoW Classic anyway?
---
Obviously, you‚Äôre speaking out of your ass. WoW vanilla was when players were most dedicated and had the most fun. I know because I was there.
---
CANT WAKE UP
---
Why is this? Is it just the demand for 2H is higher on alliance or something?
---
This guy should be banned. It's not allowed to give your account. :D
---
It was close to the only game I played for nearly a decade...that said, if I dont think about my /played im a happier person...thinking about the other things I could have done with that time is anxiety inducing.
---
It boggles my mind seeing so many people asking what race and class they "should" be. The only race and class you "should" be is the one you find most interesting and fun. 
---
It's scary to think there are so many people out there whose only concern is topping the charts and nothing else.
---
Before just assuming that you are the one who is incorrect, I looked up information on each world of warcraft expansion's file size. Also has been talked about on reddit as seen here for vanilla: https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/53wf9x/how_big_is_vanilla_the_client/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Approximate sizes of these 3 expansions:
---
Vanilla : 5
---
Tbc : 3.5  (totaling around 9 gigs) 
---
Wotlk : 9 (total around 18 gigs)
---
The only reason 2hdned is good on horde is due to wind fury.  Slam spec is not good and you'll do way better dps with one handers
---
Sword spec is better because the extra hit can crit, none of that swing timer stuff seems to relate here at all. On hit you get the extra hit, or you don't, and the swing timer is never effected.
---
What the fuck did you just say?
---
Play other games. It's working for me (kind of).
---
No.  Horde has WF alliance doesn't. Without windfury rage regeneration is a lot worse and you're overall damage is just worse due to the lack of double hits.  Slam spec is terrible as you end up overwriting white hits since slam has a cast time.
---
It's something like "ugh, these stupid elf players are sitting here 'defending' mine while the horse is taking farm. Kill me please."
---
Exactly my thought!
---
I will definitely create a bank alt very soon and super crowded starting zones will be a good argument to do it, still more productive than waiting for respawn... unless sharding makes things smooth!
---
That is not the case here. I explained below that the picture you are looking at *IS*the installer. The upgrade from vanilla wow(5 gigs) to tbc is 3.5 gigs.
---
You really think they‚Äôre going to bring back classic wow?
---
Tons of fond memories from tbc, but it was the beginning of the end with flying mounts, arenas, etc
---
I can get any AQ40 clearing raid through Naxx while still in 1.12.  Hit my line.
---
That is a picture of the Blizzard downloader. I know what it is because I used it dozens of times to download installer files over 10 years ago. Look at the picture closely and look at what it says it's installing. I don't know what else to say other than you are incorrect, buddy.
---
Hahahaha very "Battle Royale"
---
Use transcription software and you‚Äôll be done in 10 minutes. Just proofread :D
---
Let's hope it's not launch day again, I remember that say so fondly when you'd logout but your toon would stay sat there, making it so you couldn't get back on.
---
He drops the chest ;)
---
Helm from Gandling in Scholo
---
Pants from Baron Rivendare in Strat
---
Get one to level 5 and learn enchanting, classic wow you can disenchant items of any level with 1 enchanting
---
And orgrimmar without blood elfs. Gonna roll horde because i have forgot how that was.
---
Yup sharding is apparently all good for launch. If this gets announced I‚Äôm probably not going to play but everyone else seems pretty cool with it so no
---
big deal I guess
---
Oh god... imagine doing sunken temple with ken m
---
Late August.  Im sticking by it!
---
And then you get teleported back to the graveyard you died near and realize you wasted a lot of one :( 
---
Obviously I‚Äôm not positive how this will work in classic, but I do recall this being how it worked before
---
My raid leader was always a bit of a bitch, this explains it.
---
There is a difference between niche specs which can work with dedication and have unique (if not always mandatory) roles in a raid and deadweight specs which don‚Äôt do enough to warrant their inclusion in serious PvE.
---
If somebody is dedicated enough, they can likely raid through all the content as a Feral or a Shadow Priest, the same can‚Äôt be said about Boomkin, Elemental, Enhancement or Ret, though afaik there have been a very few exceptions on pservers. 
---
Earlier vanilla raids are not that hard though, so a lot of non-serious guilds might still take a few meme specs, but if you decide to main an Enhancement Shaman or a Ret you will struggle finding a competent guild and you won‚Äôt get your offspec gear before all the real raiding classes got them. Also your DPS meters will utterly suck compared to real DPS classes.
---
I‚Äôve started my first vanilla adventure by levelling a Shaman on a pserver, intending to go Enhancement, and realized that it is just not worth it, neither for PvE or PvP so I just learned how to Resto and actually enjoyed it. On the Horde side in my experience Shammies have the highest dropout rates during leveling, despite being the most sought after class in 60. If somebody wants to main a hybrid class but are utterly unwilling to become a healer, then they shouldn‚Äôt, because it will end up in a disappointment and there is no point in encouraging their delusion to
---
make that even more painful.
---
Man why are you so angry? Have you made a better alternative to this? You call him lazy but lazy people don't just randomly drum up name generators.
---
Lazy people often criticize things that other people make.
---
The least you could've done is framed your critique more constructively.
---
Llolwouldbemice so I could try to book holidays

I‚Äôve never used enchanting on retail. What do you want to vendor vs disenchant vs auction?
---
TLDR: you can heal as a warrior!    
---
 Got it
---
yes please. Wrath was the beginning of the end.
---
Not sure if its been asked yet. But for a ret pally. How much of a difference would divine strength and bok be compared to imp bom? At what point would the former be better than the latter?
---
WAKE ME UP INSIDE
---
You absolutely wont.  You don't even get cat form til 20 and you don't get druid ambush and druid evis until 32. Rogues get ambush at 18 and evis at level 1.  Druids' finishing move until then is rip, which is terrible for grinding/questing and you're better of just clawing most the time (which is terrible but slightly less terrible than rip).  Yeah you can heal between pulls but it only gives you a slight edge over someone bandaging or eating, which is wiped out and then some by your comparatively terrible kill times.  If you want to kill with comparable speed, you're going to be pull with starfire and moonfire, which is going to force you to drink anyway, so kind of a wash.

Higher level mobs give less XP than yellow mobs.

I will not deny this. Though I question the down votes on a thread about "being a douche"
---
/script if race("Gnome",'target') then use action("Punt")end
---
I feel bad for all the players who roll a Ret pala or other hybrid dps and expect to do well in raiding. They will spend 200 hours getting to endgame only to find that the role they chose is kind of bad and nearly unwanted by most guilds. 
---
I really am not trying to ruin anyones aspirations but what do you want me to do lie? No, better just to say it as it is: You can always do some MC PUGs later on.
---
Was that dk ability unholy frenzy?
---
If there was one good thing about Cata, it was making Subtlety a viable raiding spec. It also had by far the most involved rotation of any rogue spec up to that point, and felt really satisfying to pull off properly. Too bad the rest of the expansion was so bland, and I finally quit when they announced Pandaland.
---
Blizzard said this isn't permanent and will likely only last a couple weeks for certain zones. No other servers are phasing in or anything either, so I'm completely fine with it.
---
They can do it all. Farming, raids, dungeon, elite kiting, pvp. And they almost never die in raids because when you inevitably wipe your group because you're a hunter and can't sit still, you can just feign death until enemies despawn.
---
Lol, there is no way you just said that. Wotlk and TBC servers have been around since like 2008. And they have always been the most popular server out. Vanilla servers only started getting players from phoenix wow and nostalrius. Everyone knows wotlk and tbc will take the cake in a vote of people's favorite xpacs. There is nothing being spoken out of my ass. Its your ass that is clueless.
---
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Thanks!

Private servers have been around for years, and they are still relevant. I don't think content will be an issue.

Great video. This inspired me to actually plan my route out to get realistic Shadow gear pre-raid (It will also involve a lot of UD Strat I think).
---
Im gonna have to move apartments in September, but I am spending 50x the amount of time prepping for wow classic than I am prepping for my move haha 
---
Objects in nostalgia seem closer than they appear I guess
---
Its amazing actually. Can get HoJ down to 35 sec cooldown I believe. Honor farming is a big commitment though
---
Lol because the masses really need every minor detail on how to get scarab lord. Obviously this video is meant to be an entertaining way to show people what the quest line involves. Obviously no one that‚Äôs actually going to complete it will be using this video as a guide. It always makes me sad when I see people like you that are just needlessly miserable about everything lols.
---
Yeah for me that sucks and is about as big a turn off as you can get but that‚Äôs okay if others are cool with it

World of Warcraft: Battle for Royale

Now with orcs and crocs

Omg I remember that meme! I used to fuck with people using the xbox meme too.

this will happen to lots of players i think

Crit is roughly worth 30 AP.
---
If Classic makes them money then they will make more Classic content. Its really that simple.
---
just think of the baby as a gnome mercilessly ganking you in stv - it's hard but he will probably go oom, drinks and logs out long enough for you to turn in a quest before he logs back in and spamms /scream, /burp and /fart on your broken body
---
agreed, I regret my time as a druid in vanilla, if it's your thing then that's great and I'm happy for you, but for me It absolutely wasn't for me. I just wish I had of known what I was getting into
---
Any spec is pretty much viable for leveling/dungeons.
---
Ret Paladin is a fine choice, though I prefer Prot for added spec versatility for dungeons and the +hit chance. Ret definitely has the edge for murdering NPCs.
---
And if you quest in the Ghostlands, a mention of Warchief Thrall before outlands :D
---
I did watch his guide already.
---
Although since I probably will be pvping some along the way, I thought it may be handy to stop for Holy in a while to pick me up some talents that might help me stay alive.
---
Thanks for your input though!
---
You'll have access to the lion in the barrens that alliance hunters pilgrimage to get. I forgot its name.
---
So to answer you yes since SM/Ruin get access to nightfall you'd want corruption on the boss to get an instant shadowbolt or 2.  The difference of 5% dmg between SM and DS will be relatively equal even with 1 proc of nightfall.  However, as you alluded to your guild should not give you a debuff slot.  There are more than 16 debuffs that provide +DPS to whole classes that will sadly be chosen every time over 1 warlocks personal DPS.  I didn't put thes ein order but these are the debuffs off hand I recall that will be raid benefitting:
---
1. Curse of Shadows
---
2. Curse of Elements
---
3. Curse of Recklessness
---
4. Sunder Armor
---
5. Winter‚Äôs Chill/Scorch
---
6. Improved Shadowbolt
---
7. Faerie Fire
---
8. Nightfall
---
9. Demoralizing Shout
---
10. Annilator Proc (OT should be DW using this)
---
11. Gift of Arthas
---
12. Shadow weaving
---
13. Shadow word pain or other DoT/channel debuff
---
14. Hunter‚Äôs Mark/Hunter Tier 2 8/8 bonus
---
15. Judgement of light/wisdom
---
16. Ignite
---
17. Thunderfury thunderclap effect/thunderclap
---
18. Thunderfury Stormstrike effect
---
19. Taunt/Mocking blow/Challenging Shout
---
enh shaman has a niche though. You can totem twist WF + GoA with improved totems in the melee group with nightfall if your guild doesn't need as much healers. It's an increase to tank tps which is an overall dps increase for the raid.
---
It's a small niche, but it's there.
---
I played a hunter in vanilla and raided into Naxx too. I never had a problem with DPS and was with my guild from MC, BWL, AQ40 and into Naxx. We never finished Naxx, but were having a blast.
---
Hunters are great to level and great to farm gold. You can solo most elite mobs with a good tanking pet when leveling. 
---
Hunters are easy to play, and as long as you turn up on time, learn your class well, have the right attitude in your guild, and do all you can to improve your char, you‚Äôll have no issue raiding.
---
In PVP I played on a PVE sever but got to Marshal. They are great to play as there isn‚Äôt much down time at all. You can burst down clothies, kites others.  Loved playing pvp as a hunter.
---
Though it‚Äòs still always funny to movck a moonkin or enhancer üòÑ never forget to salt their wounds!

Here's the issue with going for the low level owls in Darnassus. The don't have the ability that you want owls for in the first place. At least what I've been told. The AoE move isn't learned until much later. If someone can prove otherwise I'd love to hear about it. Thank you.
---
I‚Äôm just thinking that‚Äôs a super petty position. I get the frustration with it maybe just wait till they turn it off.

Saddest birthday YET

Porting people into a dungeon like Cazic Thule was a classic good time too.

---
Never ever, ill just make a new alt.
---
Totally agreed with this. Ulduar was peak difficulty selection. Loved the hard mode mechanics they were so creative. I quit after Ulduar and saw what it became and it really eased the quitting process which was tough at the time.
---
It‚Äôs not as bad with 1.12 talents and everyone starting out in at best phase one.
---
The struggling warrior meme was created mainly because warrior was by far the shittiest class to catch up with. 
---
Your dps is meh with little to no hit, and so is your TPS if you wanna tank. The nice thing is that everyone else does piss poor dps so threat is a nonissue
---
All I saw while reading this was a decimated corpse on the ground covered in baby shit as the camera slowly zooms out to see a baby (also covered on his own shit)
---
People who are just mindlessly spamming the game without a sense of adventure just to get new gear treadmill need to quit imo
---
Well they are free to choose, if they wanna be the tryhard ret everyone knows on the server they are welcome! I love to have different speccs around the server and regocnizing ppl that do something ‚Äûunique‚Äú üôÉ
---
I would vendor anything grey, mail whites to an appropriate alt (1 for tailoring goods, leather goods, etc.), I would put greens and blues on AH, if after 2 tries they didn't sell I DE them. Or just DE if there are a lot of the same item on AH, if undercutting didn't yield enough profit. The currency struggle is real for a long time.
---
No plans to get an Owl.  I hate flying pets.  The flapping noise and being in my face annoys me.  My orc hunter is going to pick up a tiger from the echo islands and I'll level that until I can pickup my metal boar from RFK.  From there HeavyMetal and I will spend a great deal of time murdering ~~people~~ gnomes in STV and not leveling.
---
Sometimes I wonder what the point of the vanilla elitists are. They've likely cleared through everything numerous times on various vanilla private servers. Is being first for the 5th time on the same content really that much more enjoyable than just doing whatever with 40 people?
---
Don't get me wrong here, I was a MT of a top 100 guild back in wrath so I understand the excitement of going hardcore into competitive raiding. But to me that loses the allure of you're racing at the same content for the umpteenth time.
---
Can i have it? üôà
---
You ressed at the spirit healer you talked to. 100%.
---
Can't get more passive aggressive than that. Have fun not playing at launch because they wanted people to be able to actually play the game
---
Pretty sure it's faster to just swim and drown when you're in dun morogh on the map. Then rs sickness by gnome/dwarf starting area
---
I was 13... You didnt have a credit card at 13?
---
I described the swingtimer just to give an example of how and why it is better, so it is easier to understand. It is also better cuz you can proc on proc with HoJ and the wep spez. Also in some circumstances as dagger ypu cant backstab. I wrote that the swingtimer isnt effected since 1.4patch. 
---
The topic was and still is min/max does dagger work, and explained why sword is better and why min/max go this route.
---
All your saying is "it's small different", but it ain't.
---
CALL MY NAME AND
---
I agree, but it won't change the elitist attitude a majority of the neckbeards here have.
---
It honestly just ruins the mood for me and one of my favorite things about launches is the chaos and everyone on the server being in the same zones fighting for mobs and meeting each other. Sharding for me takes a lot of the pleasure of the first week or so out of the game so it‚Äôs just less motivating to play
---
Game stop had a bug(?) in their system a year or two ago where the 60 day cards were sold at a discount (which never happens). I am still paying for game time with those discounted cards. I have a few left!
---
Even for a few days only at low levels so that the thousands of players become hundreds? Look, i've gotten very intimate with sharding as I still play Retail. Nobody wants sharding in Classic in the long run, but if you've EVER seen a launch of any expansion you'd know that Classic will be even worse, and sharding is the only way we will be able to play for the first few days. I want to see the rush of people too, I want to see and experience being unable to kill a single defias because 50 other players are there. But I don't want HUNDREDS of players there. Because it would take literal days to get to 10.
---
I think it all comes down to what you want to do.  I know there are people who raided as fire mage, even in vanilla through MC/BWL.  It's maybe not "optimal" but still does decent damage IIRC.  
---
Fury warrior is fine- not the fastest but there are ways to reduce the amount of downtime.   Paladin is fun, but lower mobility (this can be mitigated through engineering or alchemy to a degree).   Also the grouping and raiding as a ret pally can occasionally be troublesome.
---
I may be retarded but why do you want to cross wetlands?
---
What's with the creepy doll in the left corner?
---
Generally, you will get yourself an add-on that tells you the % chances of getting an Essence or Dust from an item, compare those chances with the vendor price of the item and the value of said Essence or Dust on the AH, then make your decision.
---
Low level items with good stat combos Str/Agi, Str/Stam, Agi/Stam, Int/Spi, Int/Sta will sell well early or are worth keeping for one of your own alts.
---
After about level 52, you want to DE green weapons, since they have a high chance for a Greater Eternal Essence which are valuable.
---
LPT: Don't use the AH the first couple months of launch, prices will be jacked
---
I guess I'm the outlier in this, as I played vanilla and jump to 3 different servers, hitting 60 on each.
---
Everytime, my friends and I didn't have any problem finding people for BRD/UBRS/LBRS/Scholo etc.
---
We also never had problems finding guilds still raiding MC any Ony.
---
I'm not saying that to disagree with you, it's just odd that I've seen your comment and many more, about being left behind etc, when I never personally experienced that.
---
Having said that, I do agree with you and and /u/ShamanLifer to some extent with regards to slowing down the pace of content.
---
I don't think half a year between each patch is where I'd put it, but i think slowing it down a bit compared to how it originally was would be good.
---
As much as I'd like that, I'm pretty sure it won't happen that way, and I'm fine with it.
---
boomers
---
WoW items, locations, and dialogue contain plenty of words that appear on the ACT. When I took that exam way back when I remember thinking "WoW might have just saved me from losing a point. Neat!"
---
I'd love it to be drawn out over a longer period so we can actually enjoy each phase, but that's because I play for like 1-4 hours a day and not 12-16 like the hardcores.
---
Appreciate the thoughtful reply! :) Thanks!
---
Playing 3-4h non-stop isn't what I would call casual gaming.
---
Hi, /u/odes1
---
Mage is good for all of that.  Priest might be a bit easier to find a raid slot but likely in a healer role.  Many raids do take 1-2 shadow priests, and depending on how many friends you make and your server make up healers might be in more demand.
---
I have been in several launches in both retail and private servers, and i stand by my statement. Sharding is cancer for a MMORPG.
---
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

---
New org?? I'm triggered
---
It‚Äôs really just my feelings on the situation, I think plenty of people would be less likely to play the game based on certain features right? 
---
Is it not okay for me to not want to play a game that has features I wouldn‚Äôt enjoy?
---
They were the only really viable tanks for most end game content. Druids could do a bit here and there. But there is one fight in Naxx that requires 8 decently geared Warrior tanks. So you'll have your real MT, the usual OT, maybe a third as a backup, but like 6 DPS warriors that will get tank gear so the guild has backup tanks and eventually enough tanks to clear Naxx.
---
Sounds entertaining, until you remember how fucking hard it is to find Rexxar when you need to! This would be almost as bad.
---
I shall get the white lvl 16 lion in Barrens as an alliance hunter, because I like limping behind by 2 levels to have a showy pet üòÇ
---
Yeah just don't expect to be in a hardcore raiding guild as a "less viable" spec and you're set. You'll get into raids, just probably not Naxx
---
Where is Mankirks wife?
---
I had the same issue with Warlocks, leveling was awesome (other than the aforementioned Hunters), but when I hit 60 and started doing some entry-level raids, Shadow Bolt spam was just boring after previously maining a Shaman.
---
I‚Äôm a bit tempted to give Hunter a chance as an alt so I won‚Äôt go bankrupt if I decide to play a healer and their DPS rotation seems actually engaging, though I still prefer the reactive nature of healing.
---
No worries, I'm sure there are more efficient ways. But that worked decent for me.

1. Paladin

2. Fast

Yeah, but that pleasure you have I guess is from private servers, right? Don't expect things to be the same.

Sometimes your 'condtipation' is just a lil' blockade that unleashes the flood.

You care about prebis but don't want prebis... SMH. And epic Mount should never Trump palpable and massive gear upgrades, you won't kill rag from your steed.
---
Yeah exactly my point! Can't see myself spamming frost bolts for the whole of classic fun..
---
Devilsaur isn't expensive. You can grind a full set in a few hours, which is probably less time than it would take to farm up your belt alone.
---
&gt; even if you belong to a HC guild that farm them it will be given to warriors and rogues first. 
---
Nobody does that. People farm for themselves, not for guildies. It isn't "given" to anyone. Players farm the devilsaurs for money, there's no class-based priority on who farms.
---
Also idk why you aren't putting the UBRS ring in there if you're going to farm the t0 chest. It drops off the same boss and it's a free upgrade over the ZF ring.
---
nic
---
Why? When they could just as easily do fresh servers that start at phase 1. Vanilla private servers have been around for at least a decade and are still going strong (and probably will continue to do so even with official Classic). What makes you think Classic would die after one round?
---
Standing in a pool of 30 people and trying to tag a mob for quests isn't *fun*.
---
why go into prot and not take defiance ?
---
My experience as someone who leveled hunter on fresh in a month and completed full pre-BiS in another month is that Devilsaur set wasn't that expensive early on, and I had enough gold to buy it pretty much as soon as I dinged 60. Not to mention Mara farm is very effective at this point in the game and you can also sell Blackstone ring runs to other classes. Going for epic mount first is an understandable choice though.
---
You have a lot of pre-BiS that comes from UBRS and one hunter is needed to kill Drakk. It's not that hard to run a few pugs and then organize with your rogue/warrior guildies who want the items you already have, and already have the items you want. You might want to do the same for the LBRS xbow. If you can get the UBRS key, can kite Drakk, make your own group and put symbols, you could probably get away with reserving one of the many items that drop there.
---
I mean launch in vanilla was also chaotic and fun and not sharded so idk what you mean
---
They haven't said how big they're making the shards. They could make 2 person shards or they could make server capacity shards, you won't know. I'd rather have a large share that I can play than no shard that I'm in queue for.
---
Yes! Except I suspect the servers will crash midway through the video. Maybe 50 times? Because everyone‚Äôs gonna play Vanilla wow... even if some kids quit at lvl 5 because it takes too long üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
You clearly haven't read up on it whatsoever, or even bothered to watch the Blizzcon panels on the topic, so what are you hoping to accomplish here?
---
You are like 6 months late to the Sharding party
---
I'm gonna bring my Gnome immediately to Teldrassil to get night elf rep :D You get less rep from quests when you outlevel them back then, so if you want a cat but are already 60 you're gonna have QUITE the time grinding runecloth and morrowgrain.
---
I plan to make the run the second I log in, server lag might let me run right through that trogg tunnel without them killing me, and even then they run kinda slow so I should be safe anyways
---
I think it doesn't matter how classic ends. It was always going to be for players who abandoned retail a long time ago and never returned. It's just bonus subs for them. I'd be surprised, honestly, if they decided to make choices that critically ruined classic. Ion seems intent to deliver the most virgin classic experience possible while trimming the fat of the poor decisions they had stood by back then. They are reinstating older systems like energy regen which have been inarguably improved in their current state. But to maintain the bursty nature of rogues and feral druids, it was necessary to go with an inferior system. The fact that they'd go through the trouble to reconstruct an incompatible build to fit in their newfangled platform also tells me they aim to keep their current cash cow methodology completely separate from classic. But you know what, if they revert to their ways and bastardize it, it couldn't happen until well after the last of phases is well lived in. Just have faith, Arthur!
---
I traded my iPod Nano for one of these time cards. One of the best trades of my childhood.
---
It‚Äôs been a lot of fun over the last couple of months to dive into the development of WoW Classic with the team, while trying to answer some of the many questions that have been posed here and elsewhere. Looking at the plans for a phased content release, unlocking dungeons and raids, and unlocking other systems, it‚Äôs clear that the aim is to create a progression experience that resembles the original arc from when WoW first launched. In thinking about what belongs in each of those phases, the team‚Äôs focus has always been on rewards.
---
Developers have scoured through vendor lists and treasure tables for items that were added in patches, and then attached them to the staged content unlock plan. This means that if a new item was originally added to a dungeon boss‚Äôs loot table with Ahn‚ÄôQiraj, you shouldn‚Äôt expect it to appear in WoW Classic until Phase 5, which is the phase that contains Ahn‚ÄôQiraj content.
---
Along the way, we‚Äôve seen many questions asking if we‚Äôre also retracing the steps of incremental changes to individual items and their stats that may have occurred throughout original WoW. Such a plan could be called ‚Äúprogressive itemization.‚Äù
---
Here‚Äôs an example of progressive itemization. The Tier 2 warrior Helm of Wrath originally had Spirit and Agility on it, as well as critical strike chance. In Patch 1.5.0, the helm‚Äôs stat budget was changed to Stamina, Strength, and Defense, along with elemental resistances. Then in Patch 1.7.0, the amount of Defense on the helm was reduced. In Patch 1.8.0, the 5-piece set bonus that included the helm was fixed to work with Whirlwind, and in 1.9.0, it got a better look with an art update.
---
**WoW Classic will only include that last version of the item, as it existed in our reference version: 1.12.**
---
Of course, this raises the question ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù. Why differentiate between adding new items along the way and making modifications to existing items?
---
When new items are added to loot tables, you‚Äôre generally seeing a deliberate effort to provide catch-up gear and/or to provide new goals for players who had exhausted an existing reward structure. For example, in original WoW, items were added to give players a way to quickly prepare for Ahn‚ÄôQiraj without having to spend months in Molten Core and Blackwing Lair.
---
The changing of existing items in patches often illustrated the original design team responding to how players played the game. Their primary goal at the time was to make rewards more relevant and exciting. Developers realizing that Spirit probably wasn‚Äôt an ideal stat for a warrior raid set helm* was an example of this sort of change.
---
Many class abilities and talents evolved similarly. For example, going into Patch 1.8.0, the game designers determined that Moonkin Form would be a more compelling 31-point Balance druid talent than the original selection of Hurricane.
---
It‚Äôs important to remember that there‚Äôs more to WoW Classic than a long series of changes. Even if each item change could be made, and even if every class change could be progressively recreated, that would still only constitute a piece of the overall landscape of original WoW. We remember how early raid progression was punctuated by unexpected roadblocks and workarounds:
---
* As far as we know, every one of the first Ragnaros kills was only possible due to a bug that made Lava Burst temporarily stop firing after a wipe.  
---
* Chromaggus was practically unbeatable due to Ignite Flesh unavoidably and lethally stacking on tanks, until it was discovered that Flamegor‚Äôs ramp in the laboratory allowed the entire raid to damage Chromaggus without being exposed to his breath attacks.  
---
* C‚ÄôThun was infamously seen as unkillable until a hotfix in April 2006 prevented additional tentacles from spawning while he was vulnerable.
---
Recreating, and then re-fixing every major progression-affecting bug wouldn‚Äôt account for what we think matters much more: the people playing the game. There were many unknowns in original WoW. The first guilds to reach Nefarian spent their initial pulls testing different ideas they had and trying to figure out what condition would get them past the first part of the fight (defeating 40 drakonids). That experience can‚Äôt be recreated, because the knowledge can‚Äôt be unlearned. For a long time after Patch 1.4.0 came out, many players simply had no idea how good Obsidian Edged Blade or Aged Core Leather Gloves were. The power of weapon skill will be no surprise in WoW Classic.
---
So rather than try to recreate a specific experience from 2005 that can never fully be recaptured, our aim has been to accurately and fully restore the original game‚Äôs mechanics and stats to their final and most polished state from before The Burning Crusade. That mission has been a pillar of WoW Classic‚Äôs design from its inception.
---
This means that while content will be unlocked progressively to allow for each raid tier to shine, systems such as class design, battleground mechanics, and stats on existing items will all be set to their final 1.12 conditions. That should take the pressure off players to be constantly figuring out what we might do next to remain exactly in line with how the game once played out, and we can all focus a little more on community building and enjoying the experience together.
---
For you, and that‚Äôs okay
---
well haveing sharding on the felix box in dwarf/gnome or the axe in troll/orc, maybe the boxes on undead area i see only beeing a good thing. but other than that, i dont want it.
---
As I started maining my warlock I put my 60 druid on the elevator in thousand needles and killed every single horde player questing there. Every time I was really bored I logged to my druid to have some fun. He lived at the elevator for like a year.
---
Then apply for a job at blizzard and show 'em how it's done.
---
Anyone can be an armchair developer and whine about every little thing they dont like.
---
SAVE ME FROM THE DARK
---
‚ÄúGameplay wise‚Äù
---
MoP class design was better than any other expansion, especially for warlocks. 
---
I and pretty much the entire Warlock discord will fight you over this.
---
I get that but I think we will still have packed zones imo it‚Äôs not fun for 100s of people to be fighting over 7 spawns.
---
You mean I didnt watched that great speach by problem solver about "problem solving"?
---
That‚Äôs certainly a reasonable take and there‚Äôs still plenty of time for me to decide and take in information that they release.
---
Humar the Pridelord?
---
You can definitely tank dungeons with fury+arms with ease.
---
I think you're overestimating even Naxx difficulty. Unless your entire raid is filled with good knows what specs, having say 5 people not playing specs will not prevent progression. I'd even push that number up to 10 depending on the rest of the raid.
---
Yeah, I'm skeptical but the classic team seems to understand what kind of product we want so I'll keep my pitchfork packed away until they give me a reason to riot
---
yeah finding people who can keep their attendance up, is harder than finding the perfect setup.
---
How can they be jacked though if people don't initially have gold?
---
July / ago is a tempting date
---
I remember having to drive my friend 30+ miles to the nearest Best Buy to get game cards because his mom wouldn't let him use the credit card. Of course that was the one time my car broke down so the whole trip took about 4 hours. 
---
Good times.
---
I totally understand that perspective but I just don‚Äôt share it. I‚Äôm really not trying to be too negative or whatever but it‚Äôs just my feelings.
---
I always appreciate it when pvp videos made in the last few years emulate the style of the classics, with music like that and silly editing stuff.
---
I get that you want that little boost to threat but I like having additional gameplay components instead of that flat 3% boost.  My gear is also quite good, so I think it will be somewhat offset not having it by having a good amount of attack power, a really good weapon, etc. 
---
I suppose as I start getting more def gear at 60 my damage might actually take a dip so defiance would become more relevant, but while I'm leveling I feel like the points are better utilized elsewhere
---
The band communicated that they prefer  that people listen to their albums as a whole experience and not to single songs, which I definitely recommend to do, too
---
Female dwarf is like the worst thing you could possibly ever pick. You could be a badass dwarf with a bunch of muscles and a cool beard that drinks all day but you chose the wrong gender
---
Which can also be optimized?
---
Wtf is that keyboard.
---
I have been very impressed with them for sure, way more than I thought I‚Äôd be at this point.
---
Someone is going to be mad that a warrior item won‚Äôt have spirit on it for the first 6 months. Preparing for the shit storm.
---
&gt;albeit ~~probably~~ true
---
Fixed.
---
tldr: Item gating confirmed
---
As a shadow main in vanilla I feel attacked
---
Yeah, so with /sit I already have a huge damage boost so it makes the other damage boosting in arms that much less impactful.  I also am frankly not experienced and not that great at tanking which is why I think the prot talents are a better use- the only thing I'd get from arms that would help me while tanking is maybe Tac mastery for the rare times that I'd be moving between stances.  But if I don't have TacM then I just sit in defensive anyways and simply try and build some rage.
---
RIP Progressive Itemizations :(
---
I first say I see conversation advocating min max as much as the opposite. 
---
You will be fine. If you pay attention to positive posts you may have seen that your position is one we are all envious of. 
---
The noobs will be the most to benefit, if so the game fits them.
---
They just keep hitting home runs with this stuff. 
---
Anyone who was skeptical about blizz screwing this up should be glad they were wrong.
---
There is a dropoff for red mobs but besides that [idk what you're talkin about](https://i.imgur.com/qqJy6Wy.jpg)
---
That's the best way to do it; "hey heals, if x or 6 drops off this boss, do you mind if I roll on this for my offspec/healing set?"
---
Not everybody loves being unable to play for days. Legion's launch was TOO good, they sharded us to the extreme and I didn't see my first player until level 102, that happened because of how much of a terrible mess WoD's launch was. Nobody is saying we want Legion launch, we're saying we want more of a half Legion half TBC. Blizzard will adjust the sharding numbers on the fly when launch hits. YES it will be bad. YES you'll phase around a ton and it will be very saddening. But the whole latter half of your leveling experience, by latter I mean post 20 most likely, will be fine and mostly shard-free. By the time you're 60 sharding should be gone entirely.
---
Don't be deceived by this sub, it's heavily skewed towards fast leveler and minmaxer, nor by elitist forum posters, all those have always been a minority of the playerbase in every game.
---
You'll find plenty of people starting for the first time like you, and a lot of helpful people in game, try it and see for yourself :)
---
Uh what? This is just a confirmation that there will not be progressive itemization.
---
My mom: world of WARcraft? No way you gonna play this. I was 14.
---
Feel free to not play it over a temporary feature that will only be there for a smooth launch, yes.
---
I know I enjoy doing all of it so I‚Äôm definitely going to have more than one character as inefficient as that is. Hunter first for sure, probably nelf because that fits my hunter fantasy best with belf. Most likely priest after that, Tauren if I can just like in retail
---
I shid my pants
---
I think this is fair.
---
I really dont remember negative armor debuffs stacking like that.
---
Recklessness, Sunder, Faerie Fire, Annihilator will all stack on classic?
---
Isnt it a point of debate in the pserver scene?
---
No. No new content.

I love outlaw but bad rng makes me cry.
---
Pretty fair compromise, doesn't go as far as changing existing item stats but still the biggest offenders of item power creep will still be gated.
---
:/
---
I heard about 450G each ! But yeah if the set is only 300G I'd go for it.
---
I actually agree with them on this
---
Many people will be upset about this change. But the people who will be upset about this are the same people that would‚Äôve destroyed the content easily with the old items anyway
---
Ok I mean I don‚Äôt understand why what I choose to do bothers you.
---
Yes. And why would you want that?
---
"unable to play for days" thats a far strech. I guess according to people like you we all might just play singleplayer games which is nice and cumfy. If they use sharding now, they might use it whenever it suits them. We already have proof of what it does to the game (retail). You just want to ruin another social experience :=)
---
It just seems extremely petty. That the first hour of a game being live is really what makes and breaks the entire (likely months long) experience for you.
---
It would have been cool to have item stats change with each phase, just for the sake of authenticity, but I think it was pretty much expected that they would just stick with 1.12 versions of these items.
---
Bruh. Calm down.
---
You got your bluepost. Shit why didnt you wish for a release today
---
I mean, i dont mind. But you are saying it like they made a big decision here. This was pretty obvious all along.
---
Who pissed in your cheerios?
---
Funny I remember a lot raid and mechanic wise.
---
But I can‚Äôt remember how Fem Orc and Male Forsaken looked Cast animation wise. I‚Äôve played retail so much I remember only the new animations.
---
I understand yours to. I think launch will be chaotic and the worlds going to be crazy once the honor system is in but if they do sharding very much past first month then your attitude is going to become mine because it‚Äôs not good for the health of classic. I do see the need for it at launch though for the reasons I mentioned in last comment.
---
PVP happens. And a lot of it. For eternity.
---
At launch a simple Malachite is gonna cost x10 more than 1 month in
---
This is not at all surprising or unexpected. They only have the reference 1.12 client data to work with. Thinking they were going to go piece by piece and try to figure out the original stats was never a logical choice. What's in the reference data is what we get.  
---
Considering the time commitment just to obtain gear anyway, this is not that big of a deal and will only help get Classic into our hands sooner rather than later.
---
A dog keyboard
---
If you wanna DPS go warlock. Cookies and Stones are nice and you can sometimes salvage what would be a wipe with a Voidwalker.
---
That was pretty hardcore. I could feel their pain. I have no regrets from WoW, hopefully I keep it that way Haha.
---
&gt;are there any 2h fury specs out 
---
I think this is the solution to your dilemma. 
---
2Hand fury is actually a really strong spec for horde warriors, and you will destroy things with a big phat 2hander, so that's probably what you should look into. Raiding as arms is pretty shit in 40mans(20mans is okay because debuffs less important and more cleave fights).
---
I was dieing lmao when that chicken started
---
[Link to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Oy8hpPd_g)

Echayakee (White Mist)
---
Idk if it‚Äôs petty it just makes me less excited to play, I‚Äôm not trying to ruin anyone else‚Äôs experience and I hope everyone has fun but it‚Äôs just my feeling. I might just wait till they remove to play but even then there‚Äôs still that lack of chaos that is one of my favorite parts to a launch
---
More like wandwandwand smite
---
**LIVE TO WIN**
---
Oh sure, agreed. But I more meant with every update we get it‚Äôs more clear that their goals are in line with what the community wants. And they are putting thought into things.
---
Nice work! Hits me right in the nostalgia.
---
This is not true. Botting would be more profitable than ever now. People would farm 24/7 for easy free gametime. 
---
Also biggest bot provider honorbuddy stopped developing and supporting bots because almost every user got banned all the time. They just couldnt beat blizzard anymore.
---
The venn diagram of people here wanting to play "less viable specs" and people wanting to join hardcore raiding guilds is essentially 2 circles on opposite ends of the earth.
---
Hysteria
---
Everyone could use a bank alt or 2. They give you somewhere to send mats when your out in the world instead of clogging up your bags while you wait to find a bank. They make trading with random people much easier, rather than having to fly and meet up somewhere you can just both log over banks in whatever major city.
---
It'll be 16 on launch not 8
---
Might struggle with threat with that spec. Anger management also gives rage per second in combat. Bigger crits, extra dot, stance dancing overpowers if low rage.. Imp. Intercept isn't needed, would go 5/5 Battle Shout instead.
---
It's more due to the nature of agro on that fight, and the fact that I was taking agro reduction talents from two trees. There's no way I could have taken top spot on a real DPS burn fight like Vael.
---
Eventually, yes, but back then it was in the Blood tree.  I think it was called "Hysteria" or something like that.
---
Well, fuck. Meta gonna change, that might be nice I guess.
---
Yeah, this rumor got my attention a few hours ago.  What can I say, they don't understand how addon works. And as far as I know, some of the Blizzard employee have tried it and they love it. I'll ask if they got banned as well :)
---
So disable battlegrounds and flying on PVP servers?
---
There's posts about noobs and there's posts about min max tryhards. It's open for everyone and that means it's open for you. There'll be plenty of new players like you and if you want, there's plenty of guides and stuff to make you a master player. I know a guy fx. who played his first vanilla experience on a pserver recently, he was a complete noob at the beginning and now 8 months later he's one of the better players in the community.
---
Most HotW comments I've seen recommend spellcaster gear, namely stam/int /+dmg/+heal stuff. Only actual physical stats come from the have-all-stats druid gear (PvP, AQ40 sets) or certain weapons (AQ20 set's mace, End of Dreams -just GL getting it, pretty much all healers want it for PvP- or Atiesh -even worse-).  
---
This full hybrid gear is also the reason of your example video's big damage (AQ40 set shoulderpads are easy to recognize whenever he gets on caster form). He still has a good load of str/agi  so the damage can be quite big since druids are who scale the best with raw strength (2.32-2.4 ap -4/5 or 5/5 HotW talent- per str point) and cat gets the +agi boost as well. It is not just base damage. 
---
It is quite different from the tbc feral which only focuses on physical stats (well, and some int for either PvE powershifting or general PvP usage of spells).
---
Because the more recent private servers kept doing that stuff. I'd say the major bulk of users that subbed to this sub since the classic announcement have played Vanilla on private servers at least once.
---
Most are just used to that attempt to create the original gear progression... on a 1.12.1 client. Not that I agree with that sentiment of desperately wanting Classic to release and change its content like the original version did back in 2004-early 2007, but I can somewhat understand why people would want that.
---
Still, the private servers have shown that progressive itemization change barely anything in terms of clear times, since players have generally gotten better and information about the game is far far far easier to come by than back in the day.
---
That‚Äôs like 3 paragraphs lad you got this!
---
Okay
---
You can actually get to Dun morogh from NE zone without going through the bulk of wetlands
---
I did Ony, molten core, ZG, AQ, and BWL as an arms warrior. Even part of Naxx. Find the right guild, and they'll make use of you. If you can't find one, make your own! All specs are meant to be explored and enjoyed.
---
I think people will be more upset that items like BRE will be incredibly OP.
---
I‚Äôm considering doing that in classic. With the old school shitty stock YouTube program and everything, straight to video by mindless self indulgence
---
Yup! My favorite way of logging out for a while when switching toons
---
Arms is a bursty pvp spec, it doesnt offer same high sustained dps like fury.
---
Even when going 2h route, people still stick with fury spec.
---
Mortal strike also takes up a debuff slot, so it's a big "No" for raids.
---
A more casual guild that doesnt care much about optimal play would probably be ok with you going arms, but if you're looking to join any serious guild then fury is your only choice.
---
Cats for life!
---
It's obvious you're only reading what you want to see. Ion acknowledged that sharding on things like ore, herbs, world bosses, and just in general is bad. But they always want a smooth launch. You're acting like its some kind of gateway drug, but in reality we just want a good launch.
---
And I can't believe you think "unable to play for days" is a far stretch. You said you have been in several launches. Classic has gained huge publicity, and will see a TON of tourists. People who will check it out because of the hype and publicity, and then decide its not for them. Not everybody of course, but there will be a lot of people like that. In Classic we will all level slow, move slow. We'll all be in the same few zones, doing the same quests. You won't be able to escape it. What kind of social experiences are you going to have when you can't even make out a name in a sea of names?
---
I even gave an example of sharding going too far and you still think i'm for singleplayer games...
---
A very small part of me is disappointed that there won't be certain bugs and balancing issues we remember from launch, but a very *big* part of me sees this as totally logical. His examples are really good at illustrating that.
---
As long as healadins are still running around in robes, I'm happy.
---
Fuckin spoilers on the damn intrawebs. Ace dies too just FYI
---
I quit wow a long time ago and probably won't be in the classic scene but I'm still gonna share my views. I also think horde is ugly and looks like lazy content in the eyes of a newcomer. What's stopping them from building nice cities? It's just pixels. Add some life into it. Orgrimmar is literally mars and it's their main city.
---
Guess we both have to change the pre-raid list anyways.
---
Ok that‚Äôs nice... now give us a release date!
---
Good for Blizzard to communicate this clearly.
---
We may or may not agree, but they are making a (difficult) decision and there is no easy way around it.
---
we farm for next weeks nax
---
The irony of this is that in reality the pictures are upside down. Isolated mind without outside stimulus leading to all sort of mental problems. I know it's just a j/k for most, but game addiction is not a joke and I've seen what it can do to a person in my line of work. "Bring your friends to Azeroth, but don't forget to go outside with them aswell."
---
&gt;Still, the private servers have shown that progressive itemization change barely anything in terms of clear times, since players have generally gotten better and information about the game is far far far easier to come by than back in the day.
---
Completely true.
---
However there is currently 2 big pservers, one has a progressive item release EXACTLY like blizzard is supposing, and one has a proper one. One of the servers is 2k the other one is 6-8k. People (on pservers) very much pref the proper progressive itemization and it means overall more item unlocks and more steady power rise.
---
I've never played anything other than retail so I can't say from experience what a fresh server would be like.
---
My assumptions are like this though:
---
* Convenience is the premium. - if no one has gold early on the odds of them farming their own materials is far higher as they don't have extra income to spend on the convenience of someone else farming for them. 
---
* Listing at high price won't necessitate people paying that price - Because of the limited gold in the servers economy you'll see market prices adjust fast. People want gold themselves and if they don't know other methods, the average player will do what they do on live servers. List things on the auction house. 
---
If a few players see Malachite going for absurd prices - they are either included to A. Farm it for themselves or B. Also list Malachite at a high price (while undercutting) to get in on the profit as well.
---
This is a very different situation to say an expansion launch where people have large differences in capital. That is when you have situations like ore and herbs going for 10, 20, 50 times more than their averaged out market price later on. 
---
Again though this is just my gut feeling, I could be completely wrong in how the average player values things.
---
It might not be casual gaming, but that is what casual raiding is.
---
&gt; Blizzard doesn't plan for the future
---
They never did, ever since the first warcraft RTS game. Or why do you think every warcraft predecessor got retconned by the next one until WoW started doing it with its own expansions?
---
Ahhh I miss the PTR's, my buddies and I got so excited when one went up because it meant we got free 60's in full epics to play around with. One of my fondest memories was when they put up a PTR for AB and instead of going into the BG an all out world pvp war broke out in Arathi Highlands where the horde surrounded the alliance base.. which is just a hole in the ground lol. No one knew what they were doing with their new class, it was madness.
---
I would have liked progressive itemization, but the most important part of it is the loot table being progressive, and at least they got that right, I can live with the compromise they've come up with.
---
Correct decision
---
Thanks for replying and thanks for the reassurance. I thought as much, and I don‚Äôt understand how this even became a rumor. I heard a streamer talking about it. They said they wanted to download it, and someone in the comments was saying a lot of people on reddit got banned for this addon, and people was talking about it in reddit. This was the only thread I found though. I was trying to tell the streamer it wasn‚Äôt true, but idk if he seen my message it was a streamer with a lot of viewers. So my message didn‚Äôt get seen :/ but yea been using your mod since it was on curse and I tried defending you.
---
We had just broken into nax and our raidleader / MT was starting the actual pulls after the first trash. Someone launched a snow ball at him and if you were grouped or something it would knock you down and stun you. The pulls are him alive and we wiped. 
---
He was Australian or something and had a melt down over ventrilo. 
---
Massive epic. No one knew who it was. Dead silence. God it was so funny. All my room mates were there in my room watching.
---
3-12 years of being in acid?
---
We already expected this, but I'm glad that they confirmed it.
---
Imagine looting an item and before you roll on it, you have to check wowhead how the item changes with the upcoming patches and if one version of those items will be worth rolling for.
---
Can't wait to watch a 10 minute video of someone backtracking and saying it's not a big deal. That "maybe itemization won't COMPLETELY RUIN vanilla".
---
As a BWL/AQ raid-geared feral in Vanilla only a ret with an big 2hander or a geared shockadin really threatened me.
---
Shamans are more threatening because they can apply way more pressure and force mistakes. You have to kite or fake earth shock regularly.
---
In general, if you dont get the opener with a rip on any non-cloth wearer class its going to be a war of attrition vs any skilled player. Once feral AP weapons come out from Green Dragons or AQ you can be more aggressive as you get reasonable burst.
---
Maybe you shouldn‚Äôt roll horde if you don‚Äôt like how they look.
---
You already play OW... make the MOBA switch to HotS!
---
Yeah some items that are in the game on launch are gonna be incredibly powerskewed in comparison to the rest of the items.
---
" -  Charges will not generate off auto attacks or npc attacks by trying to sit down and force a crit. However, ability crits from physical abilities such as Sinister Strike, Hamstring, Auto-shot, Aimed shot, etc will generate a charge if you're sitting.  "

It works on pservers, but maybe thats because of their "wonky" code.
---
Quite a few awesome items in there ;)
---
I think they're very fair with their points, I'm not surprised or angry at this decision.
---
This was almost a year after release and a guy was trying to sell gold for real money. Not a Chinese farmer or anything, just a guy with a lot of gold.  So I sent him a whisper and asked how much for 2k and he said $400 money order. Great deal.
---
I told him I want the gold first, $400 is a lot of money for a teenager to just liss away on a scam. We came to an a rage mentioned that I'd talk with him on the phone while I did the money order.  I gave him my phone number and he texted it and I texted back that it was indeed me with my character name and all that. 
---
We met in Stormwind and he traded me the gold. I then mounted up and rode off into the sunset. He kept wispering me about going g to do the money order so I said "Stop harassing me! I didn't buy Gold from you!" Then blocked him. My phone exploded with phone calls and texts. I answered one of the calls and just said something stupid like "buying and selling gold for real money is against the TOS"
---
A couple days later he called me, crying, to inform me that I'm a piece of shot because he got permantly banned because he made a ticket about how I took his gold and didn't give him his money.
---
I feel a little bad for it now, but at the time I didn't at all.
---
There will be bots.
---
There will always be bots. It is the will of the universe. 
---
They will just be prosecuted with the swiftness and efficiency that has come to be in recent iterations of WoW, which may have been missing back then.
---
As i understood the text, meta is only going to change for the people who raided early on in vanilla and havent played any private servers since. All private servers  run 1.12 patch, so anyone who raided in them, knows the meta come Classic. Which would be the majority of raiders in Classic
---
No, not like this again. Not some edgy guy who goes "No, dont destroy the game by sharding the first leveling zone so we can actually play blizzard, noooo".
---
Would you prefer to not be able to tag a mob (And have massive fucking lag spikes, if you can even log in at all) for the first day? No, didnt think so.
---
And if you want that, you are retarded. End of story
---
I can see why they would do this but I would still have prefered atleast some stat progression. Some items are gonna be completely bonkers on launch compared to the rest of the item pool.
---
Awesome
---
I really hope its not going to be as bad as my current perception tbh. 
---
Also, lets be honest, anything cleared on private servers is a joke compared to what actual retail will be like. I watched a video yesterday of all the "mechanics" that were implemented on private servers that are either flat our wrong, or likely wrong, and I don't think content will be cleared anywhere near as quickly as some people expect it to be (somewhat related, the change that made me legit laugh hard was the black lotus spawn time being reduced from 2 hours to 6 minutes...)
---
This right here is my favorite part of vanilla. It didn't matter that you weren't a special snowflake and every possible class that could do damage HAD TO BE within 5% of each other. The fact that you brought so much utility and enhanced everyone else so much made you stand out. What the game eventually morphed into...man.
---
That and skill trees. Man do I miss pouring over skill tree possibilities for hours on end. Of course there is min/maxed to the core pve trees but pvp the world's the limit still. Or even pure farming setups etc.
---
If no sharding drove people away, i wonder why Nost had over 10k players on a single realm. The people who wont like classic are the carebears that play retail these days and think its perfect (instant gratification, nice and easy). Sharding means you sacrifice the social aspect of the game, destroying a possible community. If having to compete over mobs the first few days of launch is the price, thats a far better deal than to split the community of every realm down into chunks for an unknown amount of time for an unknown amount of zones.
---
I just want a ruling on when/if crbgs will be added.
---
Either way they went on this, they would have upset people.  So it was an unavoidable one.  I am mostly just glad they thought it out and had a fair reason behind it and not just "ehh this is easier" but to have a clear philosophy behind the decision.
---
The only thing that is slightly unclear to me would be items from MC that got added in later patches but before AQ, like benediction. If this will be there in phase 1 or if any item changes will happen like adding items prior to phase 5.. or if items are all there, just gated, until phase 5. That means to be it but wish they had thrown in that as an example.
---
Understandable, but disappointing. I'm still holding out that they'll tweak raid balance to compensate at least a little. Even outside of OP items and talents, they nerfed raids as a catch up mechanic in the later patches. I'd rather not play the most nerfed versions on top of the best talents and gear.
---
Oh, hi Mark...
---
Oh? Snap that would be useful, does it involve crazy wall jumps? I've never been good at crazy wall jumps
---
Eye of Divinity, Wild Growth Spaulders, and Gloves of Hypnotic Flame.
---
You didn't even ninja items that would've helped you as a rogue.
---
It costs increasingly more gold and caps out at 50g I believe
---
Yeah this is a good response. Certain bugs and balancing was a big charm of the game but logically and realistically they should be fixed. Like they say in the post you can't unlearn information, they cant completely remake the experience.
---
One of the guild I'm considering has planned to farm devilsaurs as a guild effort. They already said it would be war and rogues first.
---
As I said in another comment I have no problem farming something like 10 hours to pay for it (I won't have skinning so I can't farm them myself). But I read here that the prices could go up to 450G for one piece, it's why I didn't consider it in my gear list.
---
About the ring, yeah it's better. For rogues, fury, feral and enhancement too. So if I can get it I will but I need something before that. Hence the pre-pre-bis name for my list or  Good Enough In Slot as someone put it.
---
I had this really good chat troll. Whenever anybody linked a heirloom, I would say ‚Äúwhy did you link somebody else‚Äôs heirloom?‚Äù  
---
&lt;Created by&gt; doesn‚Äôt show up in chat, so I‚Äôd tell them it doesn‚Äôt show if you link somebody else‚Äôs. I caught a lot of bodies with that one.
---
Raiding in Arms, worked in vanilla because Mortal Strike has a Medium debuff prio, however it wont work in 1.12 since it was updated to a High prio.   
---
So no, Arms is not viable in raiding, since it wont "fall off" the debuff slots. if you want to 2h in raid, there is only Horde Fury :/
---
Who'd win in a fight, Zelda with his Master Sword, or Metroid with his gun-arm?
---
A warrior item won't have spirit? Like half the gear had random spirit for some unknown reason before they changed it later to actually make sense - as if classic isn't hard enough to play with normal gear
---
Do those private servers that have progressive itemization also have progressive talents and boss changes? Genuinely asking as I don't know. The bluepost is correct that progressive itemization would also mean progressive talents, boss changes etc, as the arguments for progressive itemization would be the same for the other things.
---
You really don't understand the magnitude or how vanilla wow really was with the statements you've made. 
---
Also not sure if troll post since you said "seriusly".
---
Blizzard has mentioned in order to make the game playable at launch / during their demo back at blizzcon they had to incorporate sharding. Ion has also said that if they decide to use sharding (which at this point I hope to god they do use sharding) it will be for the initial launch in the starting zones for a few weeks. 
---
If you don't believe they should shard imagine this.
---
Scenario:  
---
Server cap is at 2.5k (probably going to be a tad higher)
---
50/50 Alliance horde split which is 1250 people per faction per side on launch day. That is 417 people PER starting zone splitting up over 6 zones. 
---
417 people starting in the exact same area, fighting for the exact same mobs.
---
That would be absolute chaos and turn people away right off the bat, for possibly even trying classic. I know for a fact when I login on launch day I dont want to fight against 400+ people to kill my kobold vermin. That takes my normal leveling time 1-10 from being 2 hours to being 5-10 hours probably. That doesnt sound like fun. 
---
This also wasnt how Vanilla was back in 2004. When I logged on, on opening day I saw maybe 8-15 people around me due to shitty PCs, download / install time on people computers, and shitty servers. 
---
Them adding sharding will allow the initial launch to go MUCH smoother. It will still put a bottleneck if they end sharding say in the next zone or the next portion of the zone. Using Elwynn / Westfall as an example. If they shard all of Elwynn and then as soon as you enter Westfall its all on the same shard this would be completely fine. 
---
Some people may like seeing the chaos of having 400 people fight for thigns, there would probably be big newb raids and things of that nature, but a majority of the people that want to play classic and have waiting to play classic probably dont want to spend 5-10 hours to level to level 10.
---
TLDR Above: Sharding 1-10 zones for a couple weeks for launch is the best case scenario. So many problems with dynamic respawns or doing nothing at all. 
---
Ion and his team is well aware that sharding shouldn't exist in other places of the world. He's already said there should only be one lord kazzak and emerald dragons. He didnt specifically say AQ40 event, but I'm sure if he's aware of Kazzak / Emerald Dragons, he's well aware of AQ events. 
---
Stop freaking out about sharding, its going to be such a small portion of the game that it wont even matter. Your level journey of 1-60 will take on the low end of scale 120-140ish hours. The initial 1-10 sharding is about 2-3 hours of your life out of that, that wont matter. It will just allow players to get spread out into the world a bit more.
---
Lol see you on launch day
---
What a twat
---
No shit dude, I was fucking 18 being a stupid kid.
---
The guild Casual on Hyjal was responsible for the nerf to snowballs, because they got a raid together to surround and grief a single player in the middle of ironforge, preventing her from moving or logging out for 15 minutes.
---
If you google Elitemaiden there might still be stories about it.
---
I got so many angry yells in Teamspeak the first time I wiped my raid doing that.
---
I am so torn on guilds! Part of me wants to organically meet a guild while playing. Part of me wants to join a community of like minded people (there are some lovely players that are also players I have been spending time with). Part of me wants... well I don‚Äôt even know, the joys of confusion.
---
I just want community. No real goals apart from people to share the experience with, and the sooner I join a guild the more of that experience I get to share.
---
she is in my bed
---
I don't think this will matter too much for the experience of most players. However, the digression from 'we're just going to stick to 1.12 items' to 'top guilds encountering Nefarian for the first time cannot be experienced again so therefor progressive itemization is not necessary' tells me that they wanted to give us real progessive itemization, because they know the (vocal) community wanted it, but for whatever reason could not. 
---
Either way, it was never expected that they would do anything else. They said at Blizzcon that they had the data from 1.12 and slightly before.
---
in vanilla was it you can't wf proc on a wf proc? But if you had 2.0 weapon you could proc every swing?
---
In tbc i know they changed it so that you can't wf proc within 3 seconds of a previous windfury proc. Gave it an ICD or whatever
---
&gt; Lesser than 1% of players saw Naxx in vanilla WoW. 
---
Weren't there only like 20 guilds that killed KT by the end of Vanilla? That's at best 1k players, **if** all of them took different people for each clear if they did reclears every week. WoW was at ~8 million subs by the end of Vanilla. That'd be somewhere around the **0.01%** of the playerbase. One hunredth of a percent of the playerbase by the end of Vanilla managed to clear Naxx completely.
---
All you can do is hope they suck and get within range for 2 or 3 hits. It really did suck getting off a crit as they blink behind you. In pvp I would always go for the distracted mage, a little revenge soothes the soul.
---
The one thing I really enjoy about private servers is the huge amount of people playing at all times of day.
---
Nice. So I'm a bit out of the loop, could you inform me on why fury 2h is good for Horde specifically? 
---
Thanks for your input!
---
You should have plenty of time but if you can't and want to want a main tank feel free to follow my twitch I'll be streaming my whole leveling experience with my two buds. Two warriors and a shaman should be pretty awesome to watch and then watch us smash content at max level.
---
No, it's only nerfing stats on items so they could make "harder" raids without actually tuning bosses manually since 1.12 talents and gear is too much for MC or Ony.
---
It's also useful for hunters. You can't always find an ammo merchant but there is almost always a mailbox nearby. So your bank alt can mail you ammo.
---
When BC launched they made new servers for character transfers.  the server I had been on wasn't any fun for horde, so i transferred immediately.  I logged in, typed/who, and only my name came up.
---
Did they have over 10k on a single realm AT LAUNCH though?
---
I literally said I want to compete over mobs for the first few days. I just don't want to compete against a literal sea of people. All i'll be doing is breaking my fingers spamming a macro to hit the guy first, that doesn't sound fun, it won't be a social environment it'll just be frustrating every time one of the other hundred people hit it first.
---
I'll be spending my first hour running to Shadowglen from Coldridge Valley anyways, so even with sharding i'll see and socialize all the nelves and dwarves/gnomes because those zones will have too few people for it to shard anyways.
---
&gt; I think some may have come out to takes it place, but nothing has been that rampant. A TON of people were using it.
---
Ah I was thinking of glider.
---
progressive itemization is fine on pservers because they are populated by autists who enjoy holding on to random items for future buffs.  for the average boomer coming back to classic it's simply an awkward experience
---
Late July/ early August please!
---
i love you &lt;3 thanks for sharing for everyone that is stuck at work
---
Gotcha. Thanks for your input! I didn't know that Arms was more of a burst spec, I thought it was just an all around DPS spec that was a jack of all trades, thanks for clearing that up for me.
---
There will certainly be some differences in spellpower and hit available due to 1.12 buffs, but it's minimal in comparison to the effect of 1.12 talents.
---
They can make up for it easily by slightly adjusting damage and HP values of raid mobs in MC/BWL.
---
This means bre will be busted from the getgo right?
---
Anyone know what happened to the  [https://itemization.github.io/](https://itemization.github.io/)  site? It was such a great tool to use for looking at the updates items.
---
And what's so terrible about it? It may be a thing if you are a few weeks out of stat rebalancing, but if you are in a long run with this item why would you give a shit?
---
Huh, pretty good actually since sitting in middle of combat to be effective would be silly.
---
Hah, two hours later they release a blue post regarding itemization :)
---
I remember i went to wal-mart when i was a kid and stole a years worth of game time with these in one go.
---
I love your accurate use of the hyenas full name. Respect
---
No worries mate. Just remember that these theorycrafters and what not do not and never will have the official Blizzard patch they're going to put out. So don't feel pressured to conform to what seems the 'strongest' now, because, chances are, it won't be in the future.
---
Just play the game you want to play it and someone will come along and want to play with you. :)
---
Rogue.
---
lazy
---
It's sad to see so many casual players who agree with their viewpoint on this matter. 
---
This is possibly one of the most important things to be vocal about and demand a change of heart on.
---
Items with their 1.12 stats were changed to be much stronger over the course of vanilla because there wasn't that many "catch-up" mechanics available like there is in todays World of Warcraft. By having these items in from the start means that the content will be even easier than it already is - and it will cause people to lose interest far sooner than what the ideal goal is.
---
I don't think people understand how much these items affects peoples interest.
---
Part of playing WoW is seeing your character progress through items. Becoming stronger and stronger every week by getting new upgrades here and there. The thrill of the hunt, so to speak. 
---
If these changes go through, a lot of peoples BLUE gear is going to be best in slot until Ahn'Qiraj - and to some even until Naxxramas. This is not good. You don't want to be as powerful as you can possibly be after 2 weeks of being level 60 for 3 raids. Then there's no incentive to run Molten Core or Blackwing Lair more than a few times unless you're speedrunning.
---
If their stance doesn't change in regards to this, I predict that classic will lose at least 30% of their players by the time BWL has been out for a few weeks. 
---
Another thing to point out is that classic has the potential to be a competitive game. On the private server scene, the competitiveness couldn't be bigger. Guilds are fighting among each other about clearing raids as fast as humanly possible. A lot of people are tuning in on streams to watch it. The amount of attention to detail that goes into these runs is incredible. As a top player myself who's been playing retail and vanilla on one of the highest levels, I can tell you that vanilla is far more interesting and competitive than retail will ever be. I'd even go as far and say that it's harder at the top level.
---
1.12 stats on dungeon and raid drops will not change anything about speedrunning. But 1.12 stats on PvP gear will, however. As of now, every guild is playing on the same field when trying to accomplish a new record. That's good. People need to know that it's possible to beat the record. What happens with 1.12 stats PvP gear is that a lot of people won't be able to beat the record no matter what they do. Because the guild with the most R14 players will be the guild who will set a record that cannot be beaten up until Naxxramas. 
---
This is going to kill speedrunning for a lot of people and thus remove the otherwise competitive aspect that could exist in classic if they made progressive itemization. 
---
Getting rank 14 is still worth it without the 1.12 stats and having 20 melees who are rank 14 with the weapons is still better than having 20 melees with UBRS weapons. But the guild with the UBRS weapons can actually beat the guild with the rank 14 weapons and armor by simply playing better. In other words - the original rank 14 gear in it's unbuffed state is still good and still something people will go for - and it wouldn't kill off speedrunning.
---
Go fury 2h. On the flip side, you will be one of the only serious bidders for whatever badass 2h weapon drops with good 2h dmg stats :)
---
My name is John Blizzard and I'm the owner of Blizzard. I'd like to hire you full-time as head of our art team. How does 6 figures and a private jet sound?
---
Windfury
---
I am all for this
---
See it‚Äôs this kind of news that makes me ok with waiting for classic knowing that Blizzard is making the right decisions. Only thing I haven‚Äôt really agreed on up until this point is sharding/AV
---
Gotcha. I do have a question, would Arms work in 5 man's up to gearing up for MC? Essentially, should I respect when I hit 60 or should I hold off and wait until I get some gear for raiding, and then worry about a respec?
---
We figured this, now where is the info on Guild Banks!?!?!
---
The issue with a sub it is hard to discuss how cool it is to play in a relaxed way. Just doing what you want when you want doesn‚Äôt lend itself to discussion, so you see less of that playstyle here.
---
However, just getting involved, playing what seems fun, finding other people that seem fun and having an experienced well worth it.
---
You can farm a full devilsaur set in under 2 hours, doesn't really matter who gets it first, you can get one pretty quick
---
#‚ÄôTILL YOU DIE
---
Tbc was dope, but they took the vanilla out of wow with that release. Way too much change that led down a shitty path
---
Running out of game time on a raid night. Those were the days
---
My buddies and I are going to be running a guild main leadership has lots of private server MC through naxx experience so we will try and make a great horde raiding guild with our experience that will blend hard core aspects with a fun raiding environment.
---
Only playable PVE spec is boring as fuck.
---
Nope, I‚Äôm with you. I like gatekeeping the best stuff for the most talented (but I disagree with HWL grind).
---
They can do solid dps theoretically in short fights but threat can be a BIG problem if you blast your max dps rotation right off the clip.
---
Thank you, *Protector of the Narcissus.*
---
Normally if Blizzard were to ban an addon for whatever the reason, they would do so by adding limitations to the APIs. Since Narcissus doesn't send any message to the channel or other players, I see no reason for it to get targeted.
---
I feel that. I'm thinking I want a guild that focuses on having some fun, maybe has a 5 man group in it for the occasional runs. It was nice getting help with some quests, or a healer to jump on a run and help out. Bags are worth forming a guild, send over the cloth we have a tailor making bags for everyone lol.
---
 she's up by the WSG entrance
---
Not really news at this point tho
---
Do you remember how much you paid for the whole set ?
---
I'm always surprized by people's time to complete pre-bis. Someone even said 24h /played.
---
I only have experience on Vanilla Blizzard servers and it's more like this guy comment :
---
[http://classicdb.ch/?item=16678#comments:id=180595](http://classicdb.ch/?item=16678#comments:id=180595)
---
82 runs to get the item he wanted ! And it's not rare it's just hunter's T0 legs (which I incidentally included in my list :D ). Imagine trying to get Ironfoe ...
---
Druid! This way you can both stealth around but having her around will also help heal you up. 
---
Depending on her spec she could also serve as your tank or healer in dungeons.
---
I'm sad actually, the a lot of dungeon gear goes from green to blue with epic quality stats. We will have a much easier time when entering MC for the first time.
---
I think we guessed about as much from their previous post on the content plan. They'll be holding off adding the additional items added to the loot tables in 1.10, but those items which were buffed in that patch will retain their buffed state from the get-go.
---
The fact that a lot of those items are incredibly powerful in their later state, is going to mean that BiS lists will need to be re-written.
---
A lot of formerly meh items become BiS for classes:
---
Brigam Girdle https://itemization.info/item/13142
---
Omnicast boots https://itemization.info/item/11822
---
Skul's Cold Embrace https://itemization.info/item/13394
---
Deathbone Legs https://itemization.info/item/14623
---
or Ban'thok sash https://itemization.info/item/11662
---
While some offer good gear/pvp options for classes neglected early in the cycle
---
Plate of the Shaman King https://itemization.info/item/13168
---
Lead Surveyor's Mantle https://itemization.info/item/11842
---
And there are even weapons available that make hard-to-make craftable items like arcanite reaper totally redundant from the start
---
https://itemization.info/item/13348
---
All in all this warrants a pretty big thinkover on how this will change the dungeon gearing progress. I'm sure there'll be 35 minute youtube videos on the topic within the hour
---
Maybe ask her what she likes the look of? You know her better than us.
---
My advice would be druid - go do all the DME tribute/princess runs when you can do so for easy epic mounts.  Plus you can find groups easier for instances when you've got a healer.
---
i like the disenchanting in front of them as a final FU. anyhow, their fault for not setting masterloot
---
&gt; then used it in a pvp video.
---
zZZzzzzZZzzzzz
---
Arms works very well when pre-bis farming, you can tank and dps very well. you dont need to go fury until you actually start to raid.
---
They are getting far too granular and need to just shut up and take my money already.
---
Having said that, I love that they are working hard to make things perfect. Coming from the world of private servers where things are constantly broken indefinitely and Valdred Moray goes MIA whenever he feels like, I am very excited for a polished product.
---
For a game I may very well play into old age, it is worth the wait.
---
Lol doubtful
---
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER NAXX HUUUUHHH HUURRRR
---
I'm at work so I couldn't click the link thanks for saving my life mate.
---
War. War never changes.
---
Why do you think that hunter really sucks? They have an important role to fill, have an interesting rotation, are efficient levelers, farmers, world pvpers, ... yes, they won't top dps meters when paired with hardcore players, but that's really about it. I'll main one for sure.
---
&gt; you get teleported back to the graveyard you died near 
---
Literally never heard of this, ever
---
Ahh yeah, I dont remember if they got sued out right but they did shut down. I had a friend in high school that used it and was super pissed off when they shut it down lol. He got banned like 3 times using it and I'd laugh every single time. 
---
Buddy was another one that was usable through-out WoD I know for a fact. Not sure if it lasted into Legion.
---
You're gonna die. Do you think about it often? Probably not.
---
This is the same. All things end. Don't think about it.
---
There's a lot more differences between the two servers than that, I'm not sure why you're assuming that it's specifically down to the difference in gear progression.
---
I didn't even think about that, good call! I just got excited over a hypothetical situation where I get a badass 2h in a raid 6 months from now reading your comment, I can't wait until we get an actual release lol.
---
In general this is fine.  The problem is with items which completely changed their power level.  The prime example is the PvP Rank 12 and 13 armor.  It was significantly buffed at the end to keep up with the PvE gear, which is good.  It used the same name, yet was quite different gear.  Thus changing the allocation with an items budget is not much of a problem.  Changing items budget significantly is an issue.  I am sure we can come up with some PvE items as well, that were basically different items after an update.
---
Very nice, I never got to experience those runs, hell I didn't get to do most end game, didn't have the time. I would be content with a good 5 man core. Team up later with some other guilds and hit the raids.
---
Tips is gonna be pissed. Can't wait for his salty video.
---
Yeah, a blue post, blizzard is listening!
---
Did not read yet but still I am happy :)
---
&gt; Probably made a few quit the game.
---
Nah, that's just wishful thinking.
---
That‚Äôs... just... so bad.
---
We need a Classic release date to plan our summer now. People need to take vacation days from work. There are summer travel plans that need to be worked out to have time for the classic launch.
---
A lot harder to get a job and make friends with a tattoo on your face, or when you run around looking like a silly lion with horns.
---
Thanks! ;)
---
every server has this person, sometimes multiple. it gets tired and old quick, but it‚Äôs amazing that all these years later i‚Äôm sure people will still take the bait
---
Exactly, it would be a lot of work for the team to keep up with all the stat changes, and a lot of work on the players to keep track of how items will be changing.  
---
I'm completely fine with their decision.
---
Spot on, especially the difficulty and meter part
---
That or ele shammy
---
Let the neckbeards play with the neckbeards, the casuals with the casuals, and everyone in between with everyone in between.

Is this stv? And is that the elite turtle?
---
Great update!!!
---
Nice. I'm wanting to stay arms as far as I can, so this gives me a lot more hope for longevity. I played on some unofficial servers and arms really worked well for leveling, just hadn't reached max level on the server so I didn't know how well it did in 5 man's leading up to raiding.
---
And rogue
---
Not all heroes wear capes
---
Yeah, it was so much work on private servers, barely anyone survived.
---
Looking at that diagram, i think you might be onto something grouping up and killing higher levels. But only at launch, and only in a group. Assuming its reliable in Classic. Im perfectly content with waiting a day or two for the worst rush to pass, then level up the traditional way, quests and level-appropriate mobs.
---
Treetittysven
---
There was also a cliff in Hyjal you could stand on the edge of and summon people.  Soon as they loaded in, they would slide off to their deaths :D
---
Does this mean all the BiS lists for pre-raid etc are going to be different now? Sorry, bit of a newb to vanilla and how this is all going to work. Are pally's still going to wear robes?
---
Yep, and most of the time people playing super terrible specs aren't doing raids because they care about anyone else's fun.  They just want loot, and they often want loot that probably shouldn't go to someone finishing dead last in dps every single fight. 
---
I was in a Friends and Family raiding guild back in classic, and once we started getting to more challenging fights, we had to politely ask people to maybe consider altering their spec so that everyone could benefit more.  A few of the people were rational adults and said, "Oh damn, I didn't even realize how fucking bad I was performing.  Sure, I'll change my spec for next week."  About half of them whined though, saying "But we're a casual guild, not hardcore raiders, why do I have to change my spec. It's expensive and I mostly pvp!"  They lacked the self-awareness to understand how their shit spec was affecting the success of the raid.  They were also the first people to die in any fight that required movement or situational awareness....go figure.    
---
We weren't trying to be hardcore.  We were politely asking them if they could do what's best for the guild if they wanted to raid....and a disappointing number of them got indignant about it because they didn't want to acknowledge that they were shit at theorycrafting, that taking aggro as a non-tank didn't mean you were doing amazing dps, but most of all they bitched that addons ruined the fun....because addons showed how fucking little they were contributing.    
---
Funny thing was we had a priest healing every week who was actually shadow specced, and didn't spec holy/disc until we got to Ragnaros when the mana really became an issue and he couldn't pot his way through it. No one knew because he was doing a decent job and didn't insist on being in shadowform.
---
Interesting points here, I think the only thing I may add is that I believe the long term success of the game past those who just want to grind for the sake of staying at the pinnacle of BIS pieces may be a small fraction of what it takes for WoW classic to succeed. I understand your skepticism of the community returning to exactly the same experience that original vanilla offered, too much of the content is learned at this stage.  At the same time if servers are able to develop positive community experiences that WoW players have felt haven't been a key focus since those days, I think that type of player retention represents a larger segment of players than just the hardcore min-maxers.

10+ minute videos gogo

Farming devilsaurs as a guild effort, but why? You only need a handful of people to farm them, and 1 player can farm all of the spawns if they have a 100% mount. I could see some players lending a hand if there's PVP or to 2-man devilsaurs if someone can't solo/skin them, but there's no point in making devilsaur sets a "guild effort", especially prioritizing warriors and rogues...
---
I've never seen devilsaur being 450g for a single piece. The highest I've seen it nearing was 500g for the set but that was when the mafia was in near-complete control of the market. I doubt there will even be a mafia in Classic because cross-faction collusion will likely be bannable, on top of the reasons I posted above. I don't see a full set going over 300g, and I wouldn't be surprised if sets went under 200g.
---
I have no sympathy for min maxers and this change only affects them so idgaf
---
I had guildmates that did the same thing except they charged for underwater breathing.
---
It's ok, my friends used to do this to Walmart. I hate Walmart so I actually am pretty proud of them.
---
Something that can also CC or hold threat and heal. This would be a druid.

Paladin might work well, too. They have no CC to speak of, though.

Curious, why can't you open the Blizzard link at work? Does it stand out too much or what?
---
The white lion is a horde only quest :( but maybe you can  get some buddies to gank a horde doing the quest and tame the pet that spawns!
---
You know what happens? TBC
---
Like others said arrows aren't that bad, you use slow weapons endgame so you really don't go through them that fast. You will also have one the cheapest repair bills and some of the cheapest consumes, so it balances out pretty well.
---
Impressed. They really look to be listening, but also making each decision from a classic blizzard perspective.

added in TBC, not classic

No need to be sarcastic, it's true. I think progressive itemization would have been nice, but everyone already knows what they're going to progress into, so it's not *unknown* like it was in vanilla. Add in the fact everyone has to do more work to add it in and it just doesn't make sense.

It'd also be great for end game duo gold farming in dungeons.

Chaotic? Yes. Fun? No.

Literally nothing fun about spending an hour to find and kill 3 mobs that are literally in front of you.

If you offer to off tank, you can get arms gear at the cost of most  gear going to MT. I did it, had a blast. Could I have gotten more gear as a tank? Yes. But I also PVP'd.

---
Disclaimer: I am not defending LFR or the random dungeon finder(RDF). 
---
&gt; It‚Äôs easy to forget that when Blizzard made LFR and Heroic versions available so everyone could experience endgame raids, subscriptions actually dropped.
---
Subs started stagnating (which is =/= decreasing) during Wrath first, then increased a bit to 12 million until the first quarter of 2011, which was just a short while after Cata released in December 2010. Subs began dropping there -  which is almost a whole year before LFR even got introduced.
---
Even so, subs were still rising (for a bit) during the Wrath content drought and after the RDF system got introduced with patch 3.3.
---
[Here you can see the sub numbers over the years](https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6995089/world_of_warcraft_subs.0.jpg)
---
As you can see, ironically, when the LFR got released at the end of November 2011 the sub numbers acutally decreased far less than they did before during that year. The steep decline between point 3 and 4 of 2011 was most definitely because they nerfed Cata heroics, as that was in June 2011 iirc. 
---
And then ofc we had the Cata content drought with Dragon Soul not being a very good raid to begin with, especially compared to ICC.
---
In the end it is the fault of the whiny bitches that kept complaining they weren't spoon fed raid gear for the difficult task of doing absolutely no content where that gear may find relevance. Instead of introducing LFR they should've just tried to incentivize players more to run normal mode.
---
There is definitely going to be at least 30-40 people in each starting zone. 
---
Dont worry. 
---
They're implementing sharding so that number doesnt reach 500.
---
I was 18 years old.  I was a shit head kid.
---
Yep, and I'm doing it on a pserver for now so I can at least plan on it for the next couple months =p
---
yes this is my concern
---
Me and a friend who was a lock and another guildie killed like 20+ guildies when we was drunk and boored one night.   We swam down outside theramore.  (Got the water breathing on us).  And proclaimed we where going to pug an onyxia. 
---
Let‚Äôs just say the ventrilo exploded.   I Rez then afterwards and gave them gold. But it was so fun to hear the screaming as I was chuggging down chilli nuts and drinking beer.
---
lols lol
---
5/10 mans were awesome imo. Remember how much fun Kara was in TBC? Guilds struggled with it for a long time!
---
not fun for you which is totally understandable
---
This changes actually affect everyone because everyone will loot busted items and finish the content even easier, while, gearing up considering rebalancing issues would affect only minmaxers. So the result of 1.12 stable itemization is a less authentic experience for everyone and less working for minmaxers.
---
BRE is a self buff, so no worries on the debuff limit. Though if it was a debuff (that all physical dps could take advantage of) you'd want it even more
---
Pretty much as expected, pretty mundane blue post.
---
I like this post. Idgaf about #nochanges shit. They seem to have their hearts in the right place finally. Restore wows community.
---
Is that negative? They stated that adding items to drop tables later on was an attempt to provide better catch-up. They viewed this as being against the classic perspective to add it in on launch and I'd agree with them.
---
Walk into the cathedral as the organ hits
---
I did this exact thing with my guild mates :o what server/region/faction did you play on?

For my own, one other thing I did with the same group is cause mayhem in the cross roads by summoning elementals and doom guards. I felt a bit like a douche but it was really surprised how many people actually found it hilarious to be killed by huge demons in town

Guild banks were added in 2.3, so they will not be in Classic.

---
I feel you man /hug
---
I've always agreed with this approach.  I understand how progressive itemization would have been a more faithful recreation, but I loathed the notion of people seeking out certain drops or quest rewards because *"this item will be patched to be* ***amazing*** *in about 6 months!"*  That just seemed silly.
---
yeah you wont have any problems. i actually find it to be easier or maybe even better, bcuz of cleaves and less %hit req.
---
This is the specc ive used when i have been 60 on pservers (and vanilla but we cant count that since arms was revorked to many times)
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LMhxdIboxuE0zu0x, you can tank, dps and pvp without any worries. But once it time for raiding, you need to go Fury.
---
What was the logic with that "QQ pvp server"?
---
Also what kinda consequences? Blacklisted?
---
That sounds like a lie you know that right
---
This is wholesome. Love you OP
---
During Lich King I would stand at the edge of a cliff in one of the dungeons with a pool at the bottom.  I would cast water walk on people, usually guildees, as they went over.  then laugh uncontrollably when their health vanished.
---
It's not for the "unknown" stats, it's for making items being less powerful for current content, instead of them having catch-up stats to be relevant in AQ/Naxx.
---
People assumed no progressive itemization because "Blizzard/Activision have lost their way and have let us down in the past and will mess this up too". 
---
What I took away from this is that they aren't doing progressive itemization because "they lost their way and are just lazy developers looking for a quick buck", but rather, they really hammered out and analyzed a lot of the intricate details and through that analysis, determined that this would be best for the community as a whole. They even went as far gate items with certain content releases. 
---
I'm very happy with this announcement because they gave feedback to the community, broken down their reasoning and exemplified that they care and are working **very** hard on this.
---
They increased the debuff limit from 8 to 16 though, didn't they?
---
You're lucky, I had to make one for a philosophy class... ended up with almost 4k words. Hardest thing I've ever done because of having classic wow in my head all the time and having to resist the urge to not refresh this sub every 5min lol.

Or release it as the 40man raid it was always intended to be during Vanilla, with the crypts and everything. Mal'ganis as the final boss.
---
I would think hardcore guild means any guild that wants to progress in raids here. If you want to progress in raids, no guild is gonna go out of their way to make it even harder and have memespecs running around when there is an abundance of players playing proper specs around now.

Walmart was not the smartest when it came to Loss Prevention in the Mid 2000's. A buddy and I would go to a few Walmarts every couple of weeks. Get this, they used to put AAA Xbox 360/PS3 games on a shelf without any sort of security casing around it, just the "wire spindle" thing that was very easy to bend the boxes a little and wiggle it out. We would then poke a slit in the cellophane where you would normally open the case, pop the disc out, and throw it in a BACKPACK! (yes, you could walk in and out of the store with a backpack and no one would question you).  
---
We would then go to Gamestop with the discs and trade them in for store credit. Gamestop never asked why we were showing up with 5 "used" copies of Madden '08 without a case.
---
The main difference of those two is that one got a huge following because it is the successor to the corrupt successor of the private server that started the whole outcry after it got closed down due to a certain cease and desist.
---
It's mainly the legacy of that one why the bigger one has had that many players to begin with.
---
Loot sharing was added in 3.0.1, so it will be in Classic.
---

---
You might be overthinking things.
---
Not to mention pay for cable/DSL only so I can play the game. Mom, I had enough deaths in Diablo 2 hardcore because we received a phone call, just let me have cable for this game
---
You‚Äôre right - I joined late in game, and started raiding only a couple months before TBC came out. As a tank I was able to form groups for those instances fairly easily, on a decently populated server.
---
It may be an irrational fear, though - but there were certainly days/times where it was almost impossible to form groups.
---
I think with classic, the fear is that if a server pop dies off, it could really cause problems for some people. But we still don‚Äôt want sharding, so... :-/
---
Not sure I would hide behind age as an explanation though. There are plenty of mature kids that are great gamers and toxic adults.
---
I think that would be an advantage. You can choose a server that has a good population and balance, and avoid the total crap shoot that would be the first month.
---
Naxx isn't hard though...you're really overestimating how difficult it's going to be.
---
&gt;Maybe not being able to communicate with the other faction dehumanizes them  
---
This is a big factor.  But mostly its just fun to be the scary monster lurking in the night, making your enemies fear your presence.
---
The thing with skinning is unless there is an event like Darkmoon for turnins, or you're crafting high level stuff...skins almost never are worth posting. They get very minor profit even when the economy is stable and the cost of listing them eats into the tiny profit as well.
---
The key for skinning tbh is just vending the skins. It costs nothing to do it and it's steady profit with 0 competition. I personally am going undead warlock and plan on going tailoring / engineering in the end. But while leveling i'll be tailoring / skinning to vend the skins for steady cash flow off stuff i'm going to need to kill anyway.
---
Once i'm max and get my epic mount i'll save some skins that are needed to level engineering and just pump gold into maxing out engineering. So for quite some time i'll be skinning for passive cash flow.
---
This is the right way to do it. I don‚Äôt want to have to look up every item I get to see if it will *evenually* be good.
---
I don't think you can attribute the difference in pop on those 2 servers due to progressive itemization
---
I always liked spamming ‚ÄúWoW was the first MMO‚Äù and wait for the replies.

Same here, but why would you waste your time watching others playing instead of playing yourself, even a few hours a week ?
---
many companies have internet filters which prevent opening sites related to video games.
---
That said, Blizzard is one the few gaming websites I can access at work.
---
Having played through a similar experience on three private servers now I pretty much know the updates by heart. I can see how it will be confusing for newer players though, especially on T1 and T2 as they change pretty radically. There are some items like Bonereaver's Edge which is extremely strong at Naxx update compared to other weapons during MC and even BWL. In the end though, I don't care that much.
---
What does annoy me is that we're gonna use 1.12 talents. This means MC/Ony and even BWL will be very easy. It also means that some classes like mages will have access to +hit way before any item has it, which is quite unfair and something I've always hated with private servers.
---
Why would Warlocks rather be Forsaken than Orc. We can‚Äôt cleanse stuns on ourselves.

People would do the same for nature resist gear, getting it in advance before AQ release. And somehow people looked with good feelings towards it, but here it's somehow bad.
---

I think you're confusing the vocal minority with the silent majority. Many people wont care and just want to play Classic, a few people will still "reeee this isn't vanilla"
---
Idk, are you all trying to tell me you're not going to have recount running? If I play a dps or run a dungeon as... Anything I have a meter going. And if bosses aren't dying and the wipes are adding up you know the raid leaders will be looking at the meters.

Warriors are nearly as good if not better at keeping nightfall up with hamstring and flurry (they might not have the rage to spam hamstring 100% of the time but flurry makes up for a lot of that). Which class is more of a dps loss swinging it is debatable. A hunter, especially in mc level gear, can basically just auto and wing clip to avoid going oom and will still probably be chugging mana pots to keep swinging. Doing that they can maybe break 150dps. A warrior at the same gear level with a nightfall might be losing 100-150 dps.
---
Watching Doomguards and Infernals rampage through town was always the best.
---
I don‚Äôt want to be that person that says ‚ÄúNaxx wasn‚Äôt that hard,‚Äù but I do wonder how much our increased familiarity and practice with the game will factor in.
---
Private servers never quite got the mechanics right, but a couple were relatively respectable. Besides the time sinks involved, people really did push through pretty quickly if they had the manpower.
---
Let‚Äôs not forget that at the time, most players had less than 2 years‚Äô worth of experience playing the game. Now it‚Äôll be people who have 15...12 if you‚Äôre discounting the horrible gameplay changes introduced at the end of MoP that made the game somewhat unrecognizable.

Being "tryhard" at vanilla basically takes the same amount of effort as being bad does.
---
The time/gold you spend on consumables and world buffs, you make up for by having clearing raids faster and dying less so you don't have to use as many consumables or repair as much.
---
They did, but there more than 16 debuffs that are more useful than MS though
---
Who?
---
I know plenty of those elitists, and can only compare it to Diablo and its ladder resets. The race is on and people that have refined their skills set off for the hundredth time to try and hit 99 first. Clearing the content is a milestone for many guilds even now. 
---
Playing on a private server and my guild recently finished BWL and people were ecstatic, after ginding gear and consumes etc (we also one shot chromag and nef so that didn't hurt).  OP is correct in thar playing whatever combo you want for a game you are paying for is the way to go. 
---
The downside being having difficulty seeing some end game content - Specifically AQ40 and Naxx- people aren't as willing to bring underperforming class combinations unless they are on farm of some of that content unless they are having attendance issues. And even then, people will sometimes pug over their own guildies to fill slots with similar geared people.
---
As a 60 holy priest who was tailor/enchanter, me and a group of guildies I was tight with would plow live strat on a regular basis for the orbs for crusader enchanters and we'd split up all the blue shards from disenchanting the boss drops.  It was pretty good money, and involved socializing and hanging out with guildies.  Didn't really feel like grinding.
---
Did you even pay attention to why they are using loot trading and the restrictions to it?
---
Nice work dude or dudette.
---
I loved SM so much. Was a great experience to do all 4 wings. Eventually doing it all in one play session with the same group felt awesome.
---
Really love some of the gear from there too.
---

---
This is the place where the Classic/Vanilla crowd gathers :)
---
I'm fine with blizzards decision on this overall, but a little sad that arcanite reaper will be so devalued by the 1.10 patch demonshear. There was something special about arcanite reaper being so good and sought after until around the time AV dropped where you could get the unstoppable force. It's such a great looking weapon and so iconic, it'd be a shame if it's gonna be completely overlooked with this system. However, afaik, it still looks like its a tiny bit better than demonshear (60ap 13 stam vs a 270 shadow damage proc) so hopefully it will still be worth it to save up for it for some people.
---
Can you really count the high rank pvp gear though since so few people will be able to obtain it? The rest of that gear can be obtained by everyone just doing a few dungeons a week. I feel like the pvp gear should be in a league of its own.
---
Meh, I dont care 2 much about it, but would still prefer if they didnt release with absolutely busted Bonereavers edge, and insane PVP gear.
---
Sure did. Same thing can be applied to the lack of Guild Banks in Vanilla, but the likely-hood of it being in Classic.
---
I think they want to become the devilsaur mafia light, without an alliance with the opposite faction.
---
They already said on their forums "expect us to have a massive presence in Ungoro, this zone is ours".
---
My only experience is with Vanilla but I think pservers has made everybody a bit crazy lol
---
It's still a valid PvP spec (but severely overrated), so if you're willing to be a healer in raids, you can just respec once a week or whatever. Lots of people play one spec in PvP and another in PvE. Since you mostly want PvP gear for shadow anyway, you don't even need to worry too much about what loot you get in raids. For at least the first half of vanilla, there's going to be nearly no gear from raids that a shadow priest would wear over PvP gear. I kinda think this is what Blizzard originally intended, which you can see in a few places like the design of Anathema/Benediction.
---
Blizz hasn't said anything. I think the whole concept is a bit over-hyped. Assuming they don't shard the whole game it won't even be something you encounter after the first few hours of play time.
---
 :/
---
There will be a different economy.
---
/2 Anyone want to trade this Green 2hander for a Green Cloth?
---
Hide behind age?  I am not hiding it, I posted this on a public forum saying I'm not proud of it.
---
Were you the same person 12 years ago? I am now 30 years old, I've lived in other countries, gone through ups and downs in life and matured as a person, I would never do this today.
---
TLDR: Supply and demand
---
You're absolutely right, but what can I do while waiting for classic ? ;-)
---
Yeah, that's a great example. You get to experience your class fantasy (altho live strat isnt a big challenge, at least you're healing) and you make comparable gold\hr compared to other traditional DPS specs.
---
This is why vanilla was awesome - class fantasy, class roles, social interactions\benefits, and not everyone being able to AOE farm 1000 mobs an hour.
---
I'll probably be tanking in classic, and I look forward to the live strat farms as well!
---
Most of the private servers on the nost core have the mechanics almost exactly how they were originally now, they‚Äôre not some hidden thing as they were all well documented at the time. The question is armor/resistance values. As for black lotus some servers allowed more spawns because of the servers average population was 5x higher than original vanilla.
---
yupp, im only focused on warrior prebis for dpsing and tanking but im sure every class has to change their prebis list.
---
The lotus spawn timers won't be as plentiful, but people (minus tanks) aren't really using flasks anyways unless its progression content
---
"Probably"
---
Thumbs up from me
---
I'm going to post this on my fridge next to my kids' art to give him a bit of competition.
---
And we deal with them by laughing at them
---
I saw Eye of Shadow on the AH for 5g, instead of 500g. I bought it. The seller pleaded with me to give it back-- he and his friends grinded for hours to get it. I did not give it back, I sold it for ~250g. :/
---
Its interesting, cause the items added in 1.10, in silithus for example are way more powerful than most of those items. 
---
But those items drop in content desigend to prep for mc. Basically making mc easier once AQ was out. 
---
I dunno, I'm happy with what they chose to do. But I think the next best option would have been to just not have those items in the game at all until 1.10. If anything, not having even their pre change states at all would make early raids harder by simply having less loot.
---
I'm sorry, but can someone please explain to me why this sharding thing is such an issue? 
---
If you're looking to power level through to 60 - there's less competition on loot. Therefore, that's surely better for you, right? 
---
If you're playing with friends, you'll be able to invite them to your party and play with them (I'm correct in assuming this, right?)
---
If you're going solo, you again, have less competition for loot. You'll still have people around you, so the game definitely won't feel empty.
---
I'm just really confused why this is seen as such a negative thing. I'm not trying to start an argument with anyone over this too, I'm just genuinely curious and lost.
---
Someone said the word sharding. Better make 9000 10+ minute youtube videos on it.
---
But no, nothing new. Although don't talk about it too much.. you might get inadvertently triggered.
---
With 40 man raids, they will have to intertwine I would imagine.
---
Probably because a lot of the other things fall somewhere in the realm of a minor annoyance or just messing with someone a little, what you posted is outright sociopathic.
---

To bad the boss that drops it is aids...
---
We've all been waiting with baited breath until we get more info. Nothing else has really come out.
---
However, I think most people are fairly optimistic about it. They've said their biggest hurdle is initial zones, and they want to make launch smoother. If it's just 1-10 zones, and only for a month or less, then most people really don't have any issue with it. Based on how blizz has handled loot trading, which was received very well, and spell batching, which I personally thought there was no way in hell they'd even consider going through the effort, I'm actually feeling confident that they aren't going to implement sharding past the initial launch stages.
---
The orbs for crusader enchants were selling like hotcakes at the time, so a couple of live strat runs would yield a few hundred plat per person usually.    
---
5 manning UBRS wasn't as viable because the blue drops there didn't yield any more shards than the blue drops from level 60 five mans.  Dire Maul was also fun to destroy, and occasionally we'd aoe scholomance if we had 3 mages/warlocks as our dps.
---
Remember when the game was released and there was *zero* bs about min/max, itemization, known strategies, etc and we all just logged in to kill boars and smash Hogger with some friendly randoms? Those were happier times.

I can understand that fear, irrational or not. If you do not already have a group of friends that are going to play with you, my suggestion would be to start looking at some of the guilds that are already recruiting.
---
Find one that suits you and join up. While I never had issues finding groups for 5-10-15 and raids, part of that was because I was a tank, My wife a healer, and we were in a guild that had people near our levels.
---
Sometimes we'd have to pug 3 people, sometimes 1, sometimes none. 
---
Add friendly players to your friends list, let them know what times you normally play, and try to sync up for dungeons etc.
---
If you play completely solo, no guild etc, It would understandably be a bit more difficult to consistently get groups.
---
Sharding sounds like it's in for the first few weeks in the first few starting zones. After that, my understanding is it's being removed or turned off.
---
As far as server pop dying, having a group of friends and a guild to play with alleviate some of that concern. As well, servers merged in the past when they dropped in population. Granted I don't think that happened in vanilla, might have been much later sometime after wrath or cata.

Including several +hit gear pieces for mages. Will be good for them though
---
Yeah because we all know it's either 20+ memespecs doing dps, or 20+ pure perfect dps spec. There is no inbetween.
---
Right?
---
There's a very large difference between being a try hard, being bad and being casual. You can be a casual player and not care about minmaxing but still be good at the game. Time spent doing anything whether it's a lot or a little does not indicate the skill level of a player.
---
Consumables will also be far less used in Classic than private servers. If your basis for saving time and gold is using those you're in for a rude awakening. Private server respawn rates and the economy will not be comparable.

What? I think the only people that got triggered were the ones that immediately and mercilessly downvoted a simple question.

They won't be in Classic.

Back in Classic and TBC you could make a Ticket and have GM's move the Item from player A to player B, basically exactly the same as loot trading does. They're leaving that inside for Raid Epics to reduce the amount of workload for GM's and the amount of Tickets they have to go through, which also lowers the estimated time until your own ticket will be looked into and answered.
---
Guild Banks may have been a good addition later into the game, but it wasn't in Classic so it shouldn't be in Classic either.
---
Loot Trading was pretty much in Classic, it just required a GM, and so it can be in Classic.
---
Yeah, i agree.  Its fun to think about what 'could be' if we had progressive itemization, but it'd also probably be a nightmare on both the players and the team making the game.
---
This was kind of what most people expected to happen, too (at least from what ive read on here in the past), so its not really a surprise or anything.
---
A well lead raid with players that listen is literally all that matters. We managed to clear plenty of bosses with just those two things in place, we didn't even know how people were specced besides maybe the tanks, and many people had greens for gear.
---
What they're really asking is "will I regret playing this class once I realize how the game shakes out at high levels?"
---
Oh man, you are in for a treat. Vanilla SFK was one of my favorite low level dungeons. 
---
Super creepy vibe, great atmosphere, neat artwork. Decently challenging too when done @ level. 
---
As others have said, having a mage or druid to decurse the one brutal curse you get is a big help.
---
What we are getting is by far the best and most fair approach for both new and returning players. It allows for people to enjoy the game, not plan ahead for what the game will become at some point.
---
He's probably rolling a hunter.
---
Spoke directly with a Wal*Mart employee a few months ago. He very explicitly explained that none of the employees care about anything.
---
Don't learn Dual Wield if you're planning on doing this btw, unarmed = dual wield.
---
So all we really need to know now is:
---
Release Date
---
Phase lengths
---
Server Lists
---
Sharding Question
---
Make the wife a twitch thot and live off the proceeds as she plays WoW while OP follows her with the rest of her groupies.
---
Max PvP potential of vanilla? Yikes.
---
I read the whole thing haha. And I think I see your point. You‚Äôve detailed a lot of why many people have turned away from retail, imo.
---
When someone was running around IF in full T3 during vanilla, you would stop and stare. Many times they would have an entourage of people standing around inspecting their gear. Their guild would never have issues finding players. Just having a member of their guild in your group/raid often felt intimidating and yet ANYTHING they suggested was received with appreciation as everyone took it as though a prophet spoke.
---
Then toward the end of LK, suddenly when a full heroic-25-man geared player stepped up, the response was ‚Äúlucky, how‚Äôd you get carried for all that!?‚Äù Because everyone had experienced the same content at a lower difficulty. It was a bizarre feeling. I remember being constantly challenged by other players claiming they were better, even if they were solidly outperformed in every possible way, ‚Äúit‚Äôs just that he has better gear!‚Äù Q.Q
---
So the game died. There was nothing mystical and amazing about endgame content - it was ‚Äúmerely a grind away‚Äù
---
It didn‚Äôt matter if you finished a fight with a group of players who literally ran hard-mode in half blues. It didn‚Äôt matter if we used the wrong strategy because we hadn‚Äôt discovered some exploit/mechanic that made things easier. It didn‚Äôt matter if Blizzard had nerfed the boss. (That one really hurt some people).
---
Hell, it didn‚Äôt even matter if you had grinded to 2500+ arena rating. (In fact, if you hadn‚Äôt, you‚Äôre a scrub, lawl).
---
So to me, this categorizes what went wrong. Nothing was sacred anymore. Nothing was difficult. Even in TBC, very few people will admit that they never killed Illidan. Oh no, now, EVERYONE downed him, lawl. But at the time, hardly anyone had that chest... oh, and Archimond was ez too (hah - Mt Hyjal was also an amazing raid, and pretty solid difficulty too).
---
And yes, with more time, more people will clear these instances (which is what the original post was asking for). But this is also what a lot of people are hoping for - that moment when you see someone running through the game, and you can stop and appreciate that you‚Äôve just met someone who EARNED it, no questions asked! No ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your gearscore‚Äù or ‚Äúhe got carried‚Äù or other nonsense. You KNOW he worked hard, and quite possibly spent more time dead, learning and farming for that gear, than you‚Äôve spent in-game...
---
And that was special.
---
From my understanding is that there will be sharding the first 2 or so weeks of launch, when Classic launched there wasn't milions of players waiting for the server to open and all joined in all at the same time. Players joined each server gradually over time.
---
If by hardcore guilds, you mean guilds that clear content quickly, with fewer wipes, expending less gold on repairs and consumables, and time, then no, I'm afraid there's no shortage of special snowflakes who want to leech gear from them.
---
You can "think" or "assume" they won't be, but you 100% say they won't be anymore than I can 100% say they will be.  The guild assets were even in the Alpha/Beta client that was on the CDN.
---
Thanks for ruining it!
---
Sure, because reducing the load on support to give the executives their "no overhead" requirement is exactly like adding a completely game-changing feature.
---
100% agree, sir
---
I hope to find a nice and mature Horde semi-hardcore guild, maybe even with little RP-events (I'm going to play on a RP realm). Well, I guess my chances of meeting a unicorn in the wilds are much higher. Horde population on RP servers is always less than Alliance (the best scenario is 40/60 ratio).
---
I encourage you to try, regardless of if they are difficult to get to, and to run back to from a wipe. 
---
Those extra challenging runs to a dungeon are part of a memorable experience.
---
cool, thanks
---
I've done this twice on FRESH it's fucking awesome and hilarious at the same time. You never want to be the guy who aggros the croc.
---
People here are the minority when it comes to the people who will actually play classic.
---
Guys we get it. You are doing a fine job in giving us back this great game. The classic blizzard team has our full faith and support BUT it's time for some dates. Thank you.
---
Hit the FLOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRR!!!!
---
Agreed. I know it's a pain to get to some of these dungeons depending on faction and server type.
---
But I personally love to do every quest in every dungeon. Get to see the entire world of warcraft. Not just the parts of it that are the "most efficient / worth it"
---
I had a 39 warrior with a pendulum of doom and a 19 rogue with those two level 50 maces. Wonder if those items will be the best again
---
Same, I really hope we see something like this. Not WoW 2, but, Classic Continued....
---
For anyone except the extreme cutting edge, you shouldn't be considering a spec without a bare minimum of 2/5 tactical mastery. Personally I always get 5/5. Being able to swap stances to intercept is critical for 5-man tanking, and having the option to charge into a pack and retain some rage can be helpful. If you haven't learned to take advantage of stance dancing yet, I would recommend that as more important than putting points in prot.
---
When it comes to points in prot, your focus should be on threat generation and a few key mitigation abilities. Last stand, imp shield block, and toughness are good mitigation options early in the tree. Defiance is a must-have in prot. Anticipation is generally overrated and even doubly unnecessary while leveling. Improved taunt is also not a good option. You shouldn't need to be taunting that often, and if you are there are better ways to improve your play that don't cost critical talent points.
---
My recommendation is to either stick with a full dps spec (31/20/0 or 18/33/0) if you're doing at least 30% of your play time solo questing, or consider going full prot (17/3/31) if you're spending the vast majority of your time in a group. If you stick with a full dps spec, get piercing howl. It is a very useful tool for managing loose mobs while tanking, especially when paired with intercept.
---
Which makes mages one of the best bank alts imo. Being able to teleport to any major city is a major bonus.
---
I think the no add on thing is because of recount. FF 14 has a stance against it.
---
Wasn‚Äôt Druid sought after in vanilla though? I was under the impression there wasn‚Äôt huge competition for spots since they were so few.
---
If you aren't planning on being a cutting edge competitive progression raider, then you can ignore all of the posts talking about BiS and efficient routes and speed leveling. People actually planning on doing that make up *maybe* 25% of this sub, probably far less, and less than 10% of the people who will actually play. It'll likely be the same as/close to retail, where only a small percentage of players are actually doing the most competitive content.
---
If you want to play slower and enjoy leveling, spamming dungeons and PvP, leveling your profs as you go to get gear, and expect to hit 60 a few months after release; you're in the majority not the minority. You see a lot of posts talking about competitive leveling/raiding because there's more conversation to have about competitive than there is about casual.
---
This reddit community is hardcore toxic the second they see a word they dont like or agree with people will downvote right away without reading a single word of the post. People won't explain why they disagree it's enough that you just used the word sharding.
---
Yeah, kinda weird, never seen „Éâ„Éâ„Éâ used like that. It should be „Ç¥„Ç¥„Ç¥
---
Hey Johnny, what‚Äôs up?
---
Wife played rp on Alliance and enjoyed it. I never went on one. I went pvp, and never looked back lol. Past experience it always seemed horde was very organized in bg's. Perhaps they are more mature players.
---
who else skipped the "rap" part?
---
Where did I say that? I said don't expect to be hardcore... I still want to main a Ret or Shadow. I'm just saying... chill.
---
This!!
---
Time for content creators to create 10 minute videos explaining why this is the worst thing ever and that Classic will be dead on arrival.
---
Using Distraction on 40man raids running across the chain in Blackrock Mountain. Target it just on the edge of the chain toward the lava, vast majority just bloop right down to their death.
---
Another time, wasn't in Vanilla but in early TBC. I camped the entrance to RFD, since you had to go through that tight little cave to get to the instance. I shredded every alliance who tried for some many hours, including other 70 mains who came to try and enact vengeance. I was focused on arena PvP at the time and was pretty decked out. It got to the point that a GM contacted me and asked nicely if I would consider letting the Alliance do the dungeon. That I wasn't in trouble and they couldn't force me to stop, but I told them no, I wouldn't consider it, and kept on ganking. XD
---
Did something similar in Wrath with my decked out ICC Heroic 25man prot warrior, but it was Scarlet Monastery. Thrashed every level 30-something that dared travel the road. Up until I had a 40man of 85s come and try to take me down. I remember it like it was yesterday: a mage, boomkin, rogue, and a paladin tried to 4v1 me in the room where all of the instance portals were and I destroyed them all. Prot warrior was super mean back then. :)
---
That‚Äôs reassuring thank you!
---
&gt;This means MC/Ony and even BWL will be very easy.
---
To be fair, I think these will be fairly easy anyway. Like the blue post said, you can't unlearn these things. Knowledge about the fights because you farmed these instances for 3 years is far more valuable than some free hit from talents.
---
Tipsout video 2 hours after that video: "Someone is worried about warrior helms which has me worried about classic"
---
Have you done a video for mages?

It‚Äôs domo chest you can‚Äôt set materloot.
---
Oh yeah, I‚Äôm pretty comfortable where I‚Äôm at. I‚Äôve got two rl buddies who plan to level with me - and a few more who we played with in-game over the years. They‚Äôre all die-hard WoW players, and most are still playing retail now. I‚Äôm actually an outlier among that group, as one of the few who finally quit years ago.
---
But all good points of how to make things work. Just gotta point out how making friends was another aspect of the way that LFR just made things worse by removing consequences for being a turd...
---
And still your getting your back up about comments on the Internet.
---
hah, that's pretty good.
---
If other people annoy you because you cant speed level to 60 then MMO is probably not for you. First MMOs didnt even have quests or starting zones.
---
Completely different. Those items don‚Äôt change, what you get it what you get, even if you don‚Äôt need it now, and plan on using it later. What he‚Äôs talking about is items that change as the game goes along, not items that you will need later.
---
Except for Darn lol that‚Äôll be empty again
---
Imagine being the first kink in Goldshire...
---
Hey, I suck, how did you farm that much as a rogue? I thought only hunters and mages can really farm like that.
---
Ok, I just know he goes quite in depth. We don‚Äôt know yet (I think?) if it‚Äôs possible to provoke reckoning via /sit for example
---
Best in Slot
---
You can raid and not be hardcore.
---
Naga. Makes ranged kiting in PvP piss easy having thumb access to all your main skill bar binds.
---
Lol they just made the site into rip 2015-2019
---
I am obsessed with pally t2, although it's not particulary good for anything. What are the talents for this set? What is the optimal way to use it?
---
Doesn't matter what you see on the client. It's based on Legion 7.3.5 patch and they said that on the BlizzCon. There will also be Achievements, DH, Monk, DK etc etc files in the code/core they use, it just won't be active or used since the actual 1.12 data tables do not have references to said things.
---
They won't be in Classic. Sorry dude.
---
What is this, beta? Never so much as heard of anything like this.
---
Its either that, or go 32/19/0 holy/conc for more healing, or do the deep prot 'diablo 2 thorns' style paladin.
---
If you check the modern videos on that build, they all use /sit to stack reckoning and redoubt.
---
I like this.  
---
For some reason it makes me want to main a Paly on Classic's launch instead of my usual gnome warlock...
---
 I remember arguing about this in Org general when I was a dumb kid.
---
Well, the site got updated now. RIP.
---
&gt;If Blizzard to this day doesnt know why its bad
---
They prefaced the entire discussion on sharding with an acknowledgement of why it's bad and why it doesn't fit in Classic WoW. They see it as a necessary short-term evil that will produce healthier servers in the long-run.
---
It‚Äôs impossible for them to keep it like vanilla, with how easily available information is. I think anyone that wants to clear BWL will do it without much trouble.
---
https://itemization.info/
---
I made it to R9 back in the days and I went to high school. R14 is, by the way just as you say, a GRIND. Guess how people nowadays achieve R14? Through account sharing because even if you are nolifing it is not enough. I'm tired of scrubs like you who obviously have never played 1.12.
---
Tbh might downgrade my pc for the authentic experience. Time to dust off the old pentium laptop with the sticky keyboard due to spilled OJ üëåüèª
---
Alenya, curious to hear more about this. What cat did you use for speedrunning and do you train both Claw and Bite?  Do you train both and use both abilities or just Claw because of the focus dump? As a follow-up to that, which ranks do you train throughout the leveling journey? 
---
Is ret or prot good in pvp? I know they aren‚Äôt in raids
---
Meters tell less of the story in vanilla compared to retail where every class does everything, they don't reflect utility. 
---
Like the resto drood innervating priests/brezzing and the feral providing crit aura, the lock with blood aura and cookies, meters just aren't going to reflect everything.
---
I just remember trying to cheese the run to AN as alliance this way and when I spirit rezed i got sent back to hillsbrad but I might be confused about something
---
There are bislists for this kind of solution already because atleast 1 vanilla pserver had the same approach
---
Wonder if this will affect quests that were later added?
---
In that was case, why wouldn't they just have started with the earilest versions of the items? That would give them plenty of time to implement any progessive chances in later patches.
---
No I am an efficient person and have my own goals. If I know I can do something in 2 hours but it takes me 10, yes that annoys me lol.
---
I bought the set after farming some of the easier pre-BiS and Ony attunement, at this point I hadn't farmed Maraudon very much, like 3 runs at best. I don't remember having more than 200g at that time and I know I didn't spend all my gold on it. Probably spent between 100 and 150g. I bought one of the piece from the AH, for the second one I bought most of the mats instead and had a LW guildie craft it for me. 
---
To be fair during these two months I played as much as my fulltime job allowed me, no other obligations. Probably at least 5 hours a day during the week and more on weekends. Not everyday but almost.
---
Seems like this guy was unlucky but some T0 pieces have notoriously low drop rate. On my hunter I farmed UBRS like crazy, got lucky on Painweaver Band as it dropped after a few runs and I won. Dal's MH I guess I was lucky too, won it after 2 or 3 drops. I kept it in my bank for a month though, as I had terrible luck with the OH. Truestrike dropped on my 25th run which I guess was unlucky, but I was lucky enough to win the roll. For LBRS xbow I lost my first two rolls to warriors and rogues which pissed me off cause I'd usually pass on HoJ when they needed it. Ended up farming the boss with guildies until we all got what we wanted. Same for the Mask of the Unforgiven, getting to the boss doesn't take long so you can farm it with guildies. 
---
But yeah, if you don't want to rush, you could just farm the items that will still be relevant as pre-BiS after DM release, and wait for that. The gear competition in UBRS is fierce but it's a fun dungeon and you're more needed than rogues there. And if you can organize with your friends/guildies it'll always be more efficient than spamming pugs all day.
---
&gt; But asking them to revolve the game around the most casual playerbase 
---
Do you mean how it‚Äôs always been, right?
---
I remember killing spiders in Duskwood and a Gnome Mage walked up to me, sat there staring at me for a bit and then /y "Cleanse my taint!" 12 year old me was very, very confused.  Thank you 2006, I still use this phrase to this day.
---
Why not just heal?
---
Im pretty sure that you can't stack reck with /sit in classic
---
Haha that's awesome! My character had what looked like a cleft lip, I can definitely live without that, no dusting off the 50lb box running windows 95 here.
---
Your name adds up :) 
---
You were born to play a rogue :)
---
But really if Mr. Ret pally finds out he int wanted in raids just respec holy.
---
Boom, top notch tank healer. Not all is lost.
---
We have only got the news we have wanted with this last year of updates right?
---
I started to read and then stopped. Doesn't bother me. I think some element of streamline is needed. It was needed back then only too long after release. Why not attack it from the unique position of knowing that items were in need of reworking, and do it from day 1? They have the opportunity to work with 20/20 hindsight. That can *only* be a boon.
---
You obviously haven't been following along. It's based on the newest version of WoW, so currently the 8.1.5 client, and none of those things are in the recent CDN upload.
---
This is honestly completely fine - and totally expected! 
---
I cant stress enough how happy it makes me seeing the devs behind classic share these bits of info with us, and more importantly their thoughts behind  the decision making.  
---
These guys actually care about the product they are going to release and the community receiving said product. Massive respect for the team.
---
Hold on...  I haven't played since wotlk, they changed orgrimmar?
---
Bastards ruined EVERYTHING.
---
Exactly. Well said
---
Agreed. The one that starts with K is a whole hell of a lot closer to what the pserver scene was before the one that starts with N was or any of its derivatives. 
---
And when you consider the way Blizzard rolled out new servers in classic, the K server is arguably closer when you consider then entire code base is 1.12.
---
How? They expect servers will have no new players after release like retail? I tried to explain in my post that you dont need sharding if your game is not garbage and lose majority of playersbase in first week.
---
Haha yupp... I went ahead and got my 300/300 Google skills and found it, thanks tho! :D
---
Since I'm planning to play a class I've never played before (pre-cata), I've done a little research to help point me in the right direction within the scope of what I want, using input from experienced players to help guide me. I've got a general idea about what I want to do and what I should be going for to do what I want to do, and everything else will develop over time. I'm excited to see how my planning has both succeeded and failed miserably!
---
Could someone ELI5?
---
He is talking about people 
---
&gt;seeking out certain drops or quest rewards because "this item will be patched to be amazing in about 6 months!"
---
How it's not the same? These post itemization OP Items will be the same 
---
&gt;amazing
---
as nature resist gear after AQ release or frost resist after Naxx release
---
it was at  [https://itemization.info/](https://itemization.info/)   
---
However as of this announcement they seem to have removed it and replaced it with a RIP landing page.  
---
I hope they put it back up as I still think it's cool to review.
---
&gt;In SSC my friend would jump down the elevator on his Paladin and time it so his bubble wouldn't wear off before he hit the ground.
---
The SSC elevator boss was challenging for many people.
---
&gt;In WotLK, you couldn't fly during Lake Wintergrasp, but you could fly in before the battle.  
---
That reminded me of this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm03136FTI4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm03136FTI4)
---
Because I enjoy tanking far more than healing. I'm okay with healing raids, because even if I were a warrior, raid tank spots require more dedication to the game than I am able to put in. But for five man content I'm much happier tanking.
---
Everyone in this chain is trying to convince this guy his opinion is wrong using their own opinion as a point. It's so stupid.
---
I remember summing people in to chimneys in wotlk pretending we were doing onyxia
---
I don't think it's a deadline thing versus it just more or less being a large amount of work for very small benefit. Some items went through a lot of changes for necessity and ended up in a good place. To me, if they're not doing progressive class balance, there's no reason to do it for items. They have better things to worry about getting "perfect".
---
I wonder if it would be possible to use a spell reflector trinket or that zanzil potion to reflect mind control on a priest and jump THEM into the lava.
---
In TBC my friend went on vacation, but wanted me to level his toon while he was away.
---
Instead I set the hearthstone of his lvl 42 toon to Netherstorm. Then deposited it in the bank (just to make sure). Then we summoned his character into the deepest part of a cave in Blade's Edge Mountain (a level 68 zone with low population iirc) and left him there. Then I waited for him to log back in after his vacation.
---
Yea I‚Äôm going right back to it, I really wanted to play a Druid for support for our group but I just don‚Äôt think it will be as fun.
---
This should be a two part poll, yes/no for vanilla and yes/no for lvl 60
---
Yes yes would be an yes on this poll
---
Yes no would be a no
---
No no would be a no
---
The question is biased towards a no
---
In my case its a no no
---
I don't see anything stopping people from doing that again.
---
It did happen in a story in retail vanilla. A guild had MC on farm. Unstable server killed half of raid at 1%.
---
All surviving priests turned purple.
---
Fair enough. I just think it'd be easier to find a group as a healer than find a group as a tank while reserving healing gear.
---
On a pserver that did progressive itemization, warrior t1, was best for pvp/dps since it didn't have any defensive etc. But the guild I was in gave all of it to the tanks cause in 8 months it'll be tanking gear
---
Make a healer.    Spec as holy.     Get Holy Nova.     Stockpile Mana pots.      AoE level :).
---
You say that as though it wouldnt still die easilly in the first week of raiding. 
---
Any remotely serious guild will clear 8/10 MC and Ony their first raid week, regardless of the itemization. The content simply isnt that hard.
---
I played on a PvP server for quite a long time, but later I realized that it's just not my playstyle and transferred to a PvE one. Btw, in my battlegroup (Vindication) Horde had highest AV win/loss ratio, but unfortunately performed much worse in WSG and AB. I have no idea why xD
---
The one time I bought one the card had been stolen from the plastic case. I was devastated.
---
the problem is that if they keep opening more and more servers to reset ppl will get spread out and it will result in 50 servers with low pop. It would be intresting if they just remowed all of them and took a break for like 2 years and then start up again with fresh servers. Nice with a forced break for all addicts to get life back on track.
---
They're a pure specialist at healing. Everyone always pretends like Druids, Pallys, and Preists aren't "pure", the whole idea is ridiculous. Yea, things emphasize different things. There are more than 3 categories to fall into. Purity doesn't exist.
---
There are a lot of good guild recruitment posts advertising what folk want and catering for many needs.
---
I‚Äôve joined one, and they seem a great bunch with same kind of real life constraints that prevent hard core raiding like back in vanilla.
---
They are aiming to raid twice a week, 7-11ish and that sounds great to me.
---
I am 45 now with a demanding job, wife and kids, so having guild mates to ask for help, quest with, 5 man with and onwards will be great.
---
The Ony attunement quest line takes a lot of work, running LBRS, UBRS numerous times. The UBRS seal of ascension requires running BRD &amp; LBRS. In my view, these will be much simpler with guild mates at or near the same level, rather than pubs.
---
Also guildies can help with crafting, pots, enchants if u have the mats. 
---
All in all, I‚Äôm happy I‚Äôve met a good group of like minded folk, to start classic with. üòÄüëç
---
you're tearing me apart, lisa!
---
Players don‚Äôt only leave when a game is garbage. Classic is what it is, and that‚Äôs a very different game than retail. Retail players may not like it, that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs bad it just means it‚Äôs different.
---
Enjoy the time with your new child! Plenty of bad guys left for you to slay when you‚Äôre ready to start playing. And we will have a booming economy with lots of good items for sell as well!
---
Yes we can count PvP gear since it can be used anywhere.  If the PvP gear is better than all the raiding gear except perhaps Naxx then this changes meta.  This means grind PvP at the beginning to get gear that lasts 1.5 years.  Thus all PvE people should go do the PvP content to get their gear for PvE...   
---
The alternative is let the gear be good for it's phase and for PvP.  Then PvE gear comes from PvE and PvP gear comes from PvP.
---
Nah...darnassus will always be empty.
---
A lot of people refused to admit the game was broken. It was tough to quit! We loved the game, and we didn‚Äôt want to do something else. But if you love something, sometimes you have to let it go. And that‚Äôs what we did. The LFR system has caused so many in-game problems, besides what we went over, it fed all those whiny bitches you mention, and removed consequences for the way they acted.
---
Tbh, the only way I think LFR could have worked would have been to keep it for attunement quests/instances only, or to farm pre-raid gear.
---
Outside of that, having a LFR to run 25 man ICC was sickening. And the way people treated you if you had better gear was actually negative. I remember running 25man LFR because literally one item would be an upgrade. I guided the raid, offered helpful suggestions, was upfront about what I was there for, and pretty much carried the DPS the whole way. (I was already really well geared at that point). But when my item dropped and I rolled for it, some people freaked out!
---
Some thought I would leave and tried to guilt me to stay for the final boss. (Of course I did - you never skipped a chance to down the LK). But others were legitimately mad I won anything. Angered that it wasn‚Äôt much of an upgrade for me (it actually was - I think it was a wand - I had been using a 10 man version and the stupid thing refused to drop for me in 25 man). But it was mostly just nonsense the whole way. After that, the only way I felt ok running LFR was on poorly geared  alts. And if things went bad, just leave, right? Because that‚Äôs what people did.
---
So, some stayed to try Cata, and some of us left a bad relationship. But eventually most people simply left, because it wasn‚Äôt the same quality of a relationship. She was too busy taking care of everyone, trying to be popular, instead of recognizing her self-worth and making them work to earn what she has to offer...
---
Maybe TBC but I would summon an infernal right when AV started and banish it. Everyone would be in combat so couldn't mount up and it was basically an auto loss.
---
I'm so excited and this is a great. I almost resubbed yesterday after seeing the new patch info on WoW, but man, I don't want to play their version of WoW.....
---
I'm so glad that we're less than 3 months away from the WoW Classic release now!! Definitely snagging a year when it comes out.
---
Even hardcore guilds take months or years to build a roster of 40 core raiders. That is to say a roster where every raider has close to 100% attendance and is considered a staple part of the raiding team.
---
When you hear people talking about min/maxing every raid spot remember that those are the people who've played the game on private servers for a very long time and that's just the natural progression for someone who's had a lot of time to think about everything.
---
You'll be able to raid as ret, feral, or whatever. There will be guilds who welcome those specs.
---
Strange how stats work out sometimes. They always owned WSG. They ran it as a group, nobody going for solo glory, nobody running midfield alone. It was good.
---
Are you all leveling as BM. I always played mm hunter back in classic!
---
yeah.. just noticed, was gonna take a look at the Helm of Wrath that Blizz mentioned in their post.. :(
---
his opinion is irrelevant
---
The most exciting part of the tbc for me was leveling. I didn't last at 70 long. I wanted the game to become more vast and even less coddling in the world, I didn't want any dying down of the alliance vs horde mentality which just turned into arenas,shared cities and hardcore pve. 
---
I would rather expanded territories be like an open battleground and up the intensity of alliance vs. Horde and utilize tons of reward systems for boosting your faction in this fight. I'd rather see raids look unique again not like some long hallway dungeon crawler. I wanted epics to remain epic not easily obtainable. I wanted there to be unique classes to each faction. Tbc was the beginning of WoW becoming a completely safe and directed theme park experience when in the beginning it had a healthy mix of both that and sandbox. Imagine a land like av, but huge where quests and warpaths as a faction can readily change who has the advantage in that world. 
---
In my head I want classic WoW to kill retail then we start over as the gods of azeroth intended
---
True. And the fact that intentionally creating bad gear stats is bad game design.   
---
My only issue is how easy the content might be with the updated gear.
---
Shockadin!!! Or the new theorycrafting spelladin.
---
Benediction and the Hunter weapon were added in the same patch as the honor system. So if Blizzard were to gate those, theyd come out in phase 2.
---
It's different because it's one thing to know *"hey, nature resist becomes valuable in later content."*  It's entirely different to know *"actually, this WPL quest reward green necklace with spirit on it will actually change to be a blue quality +2% spell hit necklace in phase 4."*
---
One is kind of just intelligent planning.  The other requires somewhat esoteric knowledge of the game and it's history to understand.
---
i always went with opening up multiple portals on the same spot and declare: PORTAL ROULETTE!
---
&gt;Sure, you can play un-viable hybrid meme DPS specs, just don't expect to make decent progression since you're going to be restricted to super-casual guilds.
---
In my experience, even semi hardcore guilds sometimes take meme specs. Hell i raided for fun as a ret on ely for 6 months in a guild that ended up clearing naxx, and private servers are much more hardcore in general. Yeah the proper hardcore guilds won't accept it at all, but i know from experience that there will be many casual guilds that don't mind bringing a boomkin or an enhance shammy etc. as long as they are reliable.
---
You have to post it on Warcraft Movies
---
Asmongold 6 hours later: "We need to talk about the community's reaction to spirit on a warrior helm."
---
My guild is going for a full clear the first week of release, so no I'm not saying that. I'm saying I would rather want it to be more of a challenge, if you actually read what I said instead of trying to put a spin on it. To add to injury tons of raid gear is magnitudes better and R14 gear is on par with AQ/Naxx.
---
I know ret can be for sure. Just can be subject to getting kitted a bit. I never felt weak pvping on my ret back in the day. Always to fun to SoC down a mage and turn around and heal your warrior buddy.
---
most of the bis lists are based off a "true wow" list made for 3.0x versions of the items and talents anyhow.
---
&gt;We weren't trying to be hardcore. We were politely asking them if they could do what's best for the guild if they wanted to raid
---
Precisely. In vanilla, I play according to the benefit of the entire raid, not just my own personal enjoyment. I could be a lolret, but I'm much more useful to the guild as a healer.
---
Healers have priority on healing items. If you want something, you had better hash it out with the healer while the group is still forming.
---
Why are people downvoting this?
---
And I hope they do quit. The "safe spaces" generation can't handle shit.
---
You used to be able to swap the price tag from a $20 fishing pole to a $200 fishing pole and it would still just ring up as "fishing pole". Nowadays they shrink wrap around the price tag..
---
I agree.  I hope we can find a way to convince Blizzard to make some changes so that this is reversed or at least not quite so much of a problem.
---
I've created a "no rush, no guides, let's play the game and enjoy it" guild. It's already basically "full" with 57 members. :)
---
You want to go play catch 2 feet away from each other.
---
Maybe, but I don't think the challenge was a key focal point to begin with for most players.
---
&gt; i raided for fun as a ret on ely for 6 months in a guild that ended up clearing naxx
---
Congratulations, you found a guild willing to carry you through the content.
---
I MEMBA
---
‚ÄúThat Hogger dude is so OP! This game sucks!!‚Äù
---
I don't get this work places you can browse reddit but not a forum?
---
They should add raids that need certain gear and only give sidegrade items and cool shit like toys
---
Is this still relevant giving the "news" about 1.12 versions of items?
---
You have to remember, though, that things are only worth what people are willing to pay for them. The price can only skyrocket so far until people just aren't wiling to buy them. The price will be higher, but there is kind of a "soft cap" on what you can sell them for. 
---
It highly depends on how the other players on your server are. If you're on a server with multiple guilds full of neckbeards who can farm for 16 hours a day, then the price will be super high.
---
If you are on a server where there's maybe one bleeding edge guild and mostly semi-hardcore/casual guilds, then the price will be drastically lower.
---
NOTHING WRONG WITH ME
---
The reason it was trolling on the SSC boss is they'd wait for the elevator, but when they saw him jump they'd go "oh, I can do that" and then fail.
---
Paladins especially because they'd use bubble right away, and it would wear off before they hit the platform.
---
Does the one doing it exactly like blizzard start with a K?
---
All those links are broken now.
---
I have not seen any of these recruitment posts. Guess I know what I'll be doing the next hour lol. I work graveyards and my days off are week days. I might be playing with the aussie crowd a lot lol. 
---
I like your way of thinking, sounds casual for the most part, and has goals to eventually get to. The way it was.
---
Did you get to keep the gold? XD
---
Renew-&gt;PWS-&gt;SWP-&gt;Mind blast/smite-&gt;Wand-&gt;AA-&gt;wand-&gt;AA
---
Explain what? The post just states that item/stat changes (and loot tables) will be altered with each patch just like it was originally.
---
I leveled to 60 on K. Their itemization was pretty much exactly like blizz is saying, right?
---
Thanks for the thorough answer !
---
After rushing to 60 I can dedicate 3 to 4h max every day and something like 20 hours the week-end. Like you I have a day job ^^
---
If the devilsaur set is that cheap, I won't even look at alternatives !
---
They confirmed just a rp server.
---
\&gt;More of a challenge
---
Dude, nothing in pre AQ wow is tough. Simply knowing the mechanics of the game overcomes most of those fights--which collectively we didnt in MC/BWL times. 
---
You don't even need 40 bodies in MC or Ony to clear it, and that was back in the day. Giving us the same shitty gear but adding 15 years of gameplay experience doesnt make the easiest raid ever created any harder.
---
Yes technically I did nothing wrong, I never wrote anything claiming there was anything in the boxes. I don‚Äôt remember how much gold I made exactly but i was able to outright help a guildy pay for the mats for hand of rag and still have plenty left.
---
Pserver?
---
!remindme 6 months on guild banks.
---
So if you make it rebalanced and more difficult minmaxers will either still breeze through the content or be unable to do it. If they can't do it noone will be able to clear your raids which is no good for anyone. If you make it more difficult to where minmaxers struggle even a bit. Bye bye all hybrid classes and less useful players. Bye bye casual guilds, bye bye progression guilds that don't minmax.
---
Making the raid content harder in vanilla is not an answer to making it better. You destroy any hope a lot of non meta players have to raid, as well you turn 3-4 hour casual raids into 6-8 hours without even finishing. A lot of people want harder vanilla, but I think that would destroy the heart of vanilla
---
Yes this is the spell gosh my age is starting to show. Lol
---
You want me to conjure some cinnamon rolls? ... I already conjured some cinnamon rolls!
---
You think of everything, mage, hah!
---
No one was talking about the warrior tier 2. No one gave a damn. Every single thread or comment on the internet was aimed directly at the items either added in patch 1.10, or changed substantially in patch 1.10. I'm not even sure why the tier 2 helmet is mentioned.
---
There is a disconnect between what the developers are interpreting, and what the community is attempting to communicate. So let me be a bit more direct.
---
We care about the items which were either added in patch 1.9 or 1.10, or were substantially altered in patch 1.9 or 1.10. The items were either altered or added, with the intent to lessen the amount of time newer players would have to spend in Molten Core, Onyxia's lair and Blackwing lair. Before they could progress to the Temple of Ahn'Qiraji. Do you understand that sentence!? Adding and/or altering the items BEFORE the Temple of Ahn'Qiraji has been released, defeats the original intent of adding and/or altering the items in the first place.
---
Your spirit on the warrior tier 2 helm example, does not answer a single question we had. We care about:  
---
''Ban'thok sash'' having +12 spell damage and +1% spell hit, or not having it
---
''Demonshear'' 2H sword, having an attack speed of 3.8, or 2.3
---
''Omnicast boots'' having +22 spell damage or +14 spell damage
---
''Skul's embrace'' having +6 defense, or +9 spirit
---
None of these items were added in patch 1.10. They were altered from pretty bad items or mediocre items, to top tier items for their availability and item level.
---
No tier 2 equipment is even mentioned. The power creep offered by having a buffed tier 2 helmet, or having it in it's original state is meaningless. Compared to having the whole raid, equipped with 3-6 items each, which are substantially more powerful than alternate items originally available prior to patch 1.10.
---
Why would anyone raid MC when you can get better gear from dungeons?
---
Team up with a warlock and keep him healed. It won‚Äôt be faster for him but it will be for u haha
---
I have a feeling the very first sentence is turning people off. It's ashame because I completely agree with the post.
---
Yeah? i don't deny that lol. I'm saying you're wrong that it will be super hard to find a raid spot as a meme spec, and that it isn't limited to "super casual guilds" that won't be able to clear raids.
---
LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOW
---
LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOOOOOOOOOW
---
This is my biggest concern. 
---
  1.12 talents.   
---
1.12 items.    
---
1.12 nerfs.    
---
If they don't retune, its gonna be kinda trivial.
---
Which would be a pretty big incentive to bring a shadow priest, especially given warlocks hurt themselves for mana as it is...
---
Only thing I read here was "bla bla, battleground mechanics, bla bla bla, will all be set to their final 1.12 conditions"
---
Fuck fuck fuck.
---
They really don't want 1.5 or 1.8 AV. think they are beeing fucking lazy here.

---
That "exploit" was fixed in Vanilla. /sit will not work this time around. 
---
It's still an awesome talent, but not as exploitable/gimmicky as most guides portray.
---
BC at 70 was great, great raids, decent PVP balance, the only negative was the flying mounts
---
IIRC, K is 1.12 itemization with non item gating. (At least k1 was that way) So the UBRS turban was in the game from the beginning. 
---
Blizz is walking the line between the two. 1.12 itemization with item gating.
---
Next season starts. :)
---
hah! /camp, I would always say something in Trade and Guild chat on patch day "Oh nice! They finally implemented the /camp tent emote!" it never failed.
---
Or the "Oh sweet, they finally put a confirmation box on /gquit!" that one still works to this day I shit you not lol
---
Corporate firewall blocks virus/gambling/gaming (and lots of other categories) of sites - I'm pleasantly surprised Reddit isnt - its one of my only sources of gaming news apart from my mobile phone
---
Yeah because you have to be real tough to handle WoW lol
---
You can have someone who s both attending AND plays a class that doesn t have to be carried
---
Only a sliver of the player will make it to naxx, even with the 1.12 talents and 1.12 item stats. Min maxers are gonna smash through the content regardless.
---
I think it's the same thing. I think the guild bank is far less game changing than starting Classic with 16 debuffs, since it was more of a limitation than a mechanic according to Ion. I bet the same could be said for guild banks.
---
So I am ofc biased since I‚Äôve formed a guild already and so. But my experience from our Discord is that the ppl in here on r/classicwow are awesome. Compared to in 2005 ppl are... well older I guess. And with that, more relaxed and can articulate themselfs in discussions instead of throwing tantrums and creating drama. 
---
Not to mention how god damn competent ppl are, videoart designers and what not. Kill-videos will be sick in Classic!
---
All in all I strongly recomend going through the LFG Monday-thread and see if you find any ppl with goals that are similiar to yours
---
Adjusting 100s of items to pre-polished states is bad game design.   
---
They are leaving 1.12 versions of items, but time gateing certain items to later phases.
---
Similar story, but with a friend. This guy would always piss me off in game, so i decided to play one back at him. I had his logon credentials, so i decided to take his character to Ratchet after he logged off one night. 
---
In Ratchet, i ran to the bridge that you take to hop on the boat, but not the boat you are thinking of :D I mean the boat at the bottom of the bay. His character was a Tauren, so i knew he couldn't make it down and inside without assistance, luckily my main was a warlock. I gave his character underwater breathing and swam to the farthest corner of that damn boat, removed the buff, and waited until his breath bar was about half... just to eliminate any chance of him making it to the surface. I waited (with a buddy) until the next day when he logged and watched his character frantically try to escape the boat and get air to live, he didnt make it.
---
Needless to say.... he never shared his account info with me again :D
---
Only problem is you‚Äôve gotta level them up!
---
Absolutely awesome update and decision!
---
It's literally the only sensible way how to do it. Their arguments in the post are solid and to add to that:
---
- it would be really weird to have all the bugs and problems from early WoW only to fix them later just for the sake of it, including bad itemization
---
- imagine wanting and farming some item only because you *know* it will become good in the future. It's ridiculous. The previous knowledge of all the changes invalidates all their merit
---
Also this quote:
---
&gt; tba
---
Is amazing and I absolutely love it and it confirms for me they're really doing it *right*! 
---
I am actually really excited about this update, have all confidence in Blizzard and biggest props to them! Thank you so much. Looks like we're really in for a great future of Classic! If the purpose is to re-create the original intent and state of the game in its most polished version.
---
This is just scratching the surface.  Imagine a server where AQ turn-ins are randomized so nothing can be effectively stockpiled months in advance.
---
How about a server with double or half exp for fun/challenge?
---
Maybe a server with multiple weekly lockout resets so you can power through content even faster.
---
Or a server where all gear is tradable.
---
I'm sure a lot of folks will think these are dumb ideas, and that's fine, don't play on that particular server.  The point is with a few small changes, you could radically change the game to a point where players would want to keep coming back and replaying it for years to come even after clearing Naxx several times over.
---
Then don't play for the first week lol
---
no, loot was added too bosses in later patches as 'catch-up' gear for ZG/AQ. Having it on release just defeats the object of even attempting to do MC/ony at launch..
---
Thank you for that information. I was convinced vanilla raiding with its many mechanics was very complicated. Somehow I thought that if you had worse gear that would make it more of a challenge, turns out 1x0 is still 0 and you can clear it with 5 people naked and blindfolded. 
---
How many fucking times does this dumbass comment need to be posted on this forum? We all fucking know how easy it is, I‚Äôve cleared it in 18 minutes.
---
I also loved a turtle for a tanking pet. Shield shell was great.
---
https://youtu.be/XQwH0atQZ0Q it's doable but hard
---
Sounds good to me as i don't want my items just changing one day
---
Hi, /u/Najarin8D
---
Nobody actively seeks out ret paladins. Like I said, you're only going to reliably "find a spot" in guilds that are struggling to hit 40 people or are super casual and don't care about carrying people doing awful DPS.
---
I did the same damn thing lol, but only had 1 guy fall for it and got banned for 24 hours and the gold reversed.
---
Yeah, I level as BM and respect MM at 60. 
---
Bestial wrath is great for leveling.
---
Slightly dick move on your part but I don't feel bad for that guy
---
I had to stop as soon as I saw Warcraft movies I got chills. Will continue now.
---
I had so many boxes of this when i moved in with my wife!
---
Usually bank alts are somewhat leveled. I know hunters are only thought of as better bank alts because at 30 you can cheetah run.
---
You're probably underestimating it.
---
It's not hard for guilds on private servers with ample numbers of players who are extremely motivated to play their best.
---
But even for good players who start on their journey without a premade group, finding one's way into a guild that's consistently able to bring 39 other good players into Naxx is not going to be a given.
---
Let's go even further, make an LFR for every raid and allow people to make hybrids only raids. Paladin tanks and DPS, Balance druids, warriors healing with bandages and trading healing pots to people! All for the sake of hope for "special" people being able to complete raids.
---
Ouch, I did this pretty early on in the game. Not sure, maybe you weren‚Äôt a rogue?
---
What if OP wears capes?
---
i would hope that the intervening decade has led to people "growing up" and learning how to play nice. im assuming a lot of the older players coming back are not teenagers anymore and actually have jobs where theyve had to work with others. 
---
people would rather group/raid with pleasant individuals versus curmudgeonly tryhards. the dynamic is not so different from a work environment.
---
if you have suboptimal spec but can show up ontime, listen to instructions, and not stand in fire thats better than some baby that rages over discord and yells at people
---
But hurr durr \#nochanges!
---
That one came back with the Blackrock Foundry jump down to the The Iron Maidens during WoD :)
---
I had learned from Anub'arak to point my right-click camera straight down when falling into water from great heights, there was always some chucklehead DK or Shaman that would merk people this way haha
---
yeah that's a good solution , just disappointed is all really
---
You can heal 5 man leveling instances easy enough at a hybrid build for dps and healing.
---
I‚Äôm leveling my shammy as ele, but will gather healing gear as I level.
---
Yeah, I considered changing it before I even saw your post. What do you think of the current one?
---
I thought I heard someone say that this would mean that something like Spirit would not be on the T2 Warrior helm. This confuses me because from what I read it seems that it should be?
---
How is this estimated? AP gives you a flat damage increase, wouldn't crit vary depending on how much attack power you already have?
---
The lack of guidance and the openness of the original map was amazing. There was so much content that the devs didn't continue working on. That insane huge gate with the giants, loch modan had a few spots I think as well, Hyjal, the underbelly of Ironforge, Caverns of Time, Un'Goro had a couple of spots too that seemed like the devs just ran out of time. I remember plenty of places that just seemed like, "Wow, this is awesome, the terrain kind of led me here and it's just empty."
---
I would like a proper expansion from what Vanilla was, opening ancient gates that stay on the plane of Azeroth, not just some islands appearing or a gate to another world popping up. I know that monster gate to the Outlands was in the lore, but it just felt like it wasn't executed in a way that felt like was in line with the feel of vanilla. Vanilla felt ancient, like the lands were there forever and were unchangeable. Then Cata dropped and fucked everything when they could have had some crazy Great Walls going up around the barrens to hold the Alliance at bay. Stormwind could have expanded to make it harder to get to throne. TBC is when the factions started to feel less at each others throats.
---
That's retail, BoE's are important in classic, some pre-raid bis items are BoE.
---
My one and only concern with this is PvP gear. If you're able to acquire r14 weapons before even AQ is out, that could be a concern since they even give Naxx weapons competition.
---
8 classes for each faction, 16 toons through Nax and rank 14 would take a lot of time. And then, you could even start trying different race/class combos.
---
In cataclysm it got a rework where it became a lot more metal things moved around
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter. Vanilla isn‚Äôt competitive, and it‚Äôs already unbalanced.
---
what happens after naxx?
---
So you suggest making the game not vanilla like just so you can have a mythic version? This isn't retail... I'm not saying lfr, I'm saying actual vanilla content with vanilla difficulty.
---
You want some non vanilla shitshow, which tbh there's pservers and retail if that's what you need.  Don't speak out against actual vanilla just because you don't like it. Its not for you then.
---
Imagine getting BRE on the first raid ID clear. BRE in its 1.10 state so early in the phases. Madness.
---
The optimal leveler for some arbitrary level of skill? That's unquanitfiable.
---
You‚Äôre definitely right. My friends were basically all agreeing that although it‚Äôs not ideal, we don‚Äôt really care and it won‚Äôt affect us very much.
---
No, for Classic. We have a Discord and waiting patiently (yeah, right :) for the release.
---
Raptor for my troll dawg
---
BoE‚Äôs in vanilla were amazing. For instance, if you got a lvl 20-30 neck, of any kind, it could sell for a ton, since some people may not even have a neck until lvl 40.
---
It wasn‚Äôt possible to fill every slot of gear, and many slots were hard to come by. So anything useful will help someone, and especially once someone has a lvl 60 but really wants to rush another toon to max level, THIS is where you‚Äôll make your gold.
---
They‚Äôll farm max level instances/mobs for the gold, then buy items off the AH so they can level alts quicker. This will help other folks behind the leveling curve, as they will need gold for mounts and such, and create farming opportunities for lower level toons.
---
BoE‚Äôs then eventually develop into ‚Äútwink‚Äù items, and some folks will make lvl 19/29 alts with the best gear they can find to farm low level BG‚Äôs once they are opened up!
---
Same shit. You would fish for gear with nature resist because you know that it would be useful later, as well as would go for this necklace because it would be useful later. The only difference is interface complications, I am sure, people that care about min-maxing their progress in 6-12 months should be able to handle this issue.
---
Do you actually know
---
I am not arguing that the pvp won't be good, it is amazing gear, especially for DPS. At the end of vanilla my fury warrior had mostly pvp gear on in raids(after the patch that made them easy to obtain). What I am saying is that outside of the top end pvp teams most people won't be able to achieve ranks 12+ so it isn't as big of a concern as the dungeon gear that everyone can easily obtain. Anyone can scrap together a team to complete an end game dungeon to get these improved BIS items, but only a few guilds will have a dedicated 10-15 man team to grind pvp ranks all day every day outside of raids.
---
Said the dude posting in a safe space
---
What's the translation of your question into English?
---
8 hours later : RandomYoutuber's reaction to Asmongold's reaction to  not having spirit on warrior helms.
---
Mages kill mobs faster than priests and can easily aoe packs of mobs at once.
---
Then there's little things like teleports and food/water.
---
Loot trading and sharding are still debatable although still generally considered fair. 
---
*disclaimer*: I am not posting my opinion either way on either of these topics. Just stating that the choice that Blizzard has made regarding these things has been debatable within the community, whether you personally agree or disagree with their decision.
---
ZG and AQ is more "catch-up" gear than anything
---
I'd say put your 2 points in Lay on Hands somewhere else, consecration for example. It's an oh shit button on a massive cooldown that's not helping you level. 
---
Other than that it looks good. If you are duo leveling with a warrior it really doesn't matter. Whacking things while healing him will net some fast xp regardless of your spec.
---
Have fun fellow Paladin!

I would even say the vast majority wouldn't care at all. I think not even 100 players rolled on LH with progressive itemization being the main factor, if any factor at all.
---
Boomkin really isn't bad, especially compared to spriest. Spriest's only niche can be filled better by holyweaving, which is basically true of elemental and enhancement as well. Honestly the only spec that probably really will make things hard for you is a Ret/Prot paladin.
---
Very awesome! Hitting that now. This sub feels like the community that was Vanilla. Community was the best thing about the game. 
---
Short story, in vanilla I was solo grinding (warrior) and kept getting ganked. A dwarf hunter named Tooheys came along and we fought off horde until they gave up. We were friends all the years I played, he was a hardcore raider and ran me and the wife through many things on his druid. One of the best humans I've ever met. He played daily, last year we lost him, he was only 36. That was the community we had, one that friends became actual friends. This Sub has that vibe.
---
I'm looking to roll as a hybrid battle healer, and I was wondering what y'all thought of this build:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/A_DUxAAEPKN83A
---
Any suggestions would be appreciated!
---
People like the guy you‚Äôre responding to are the kind of people who make me think hardcore min maxers ruined wow more than casuals did. They need their special impossible one-shot mechanic mode raid bosses to compete with each other over while everyone else doesn‚Äôt get to play the game normally.
---
Good to know, that wrecks the 2H fury enrage also then I guess
---
If you still don't understand, having 1.12 talents and warriors/rogues with 1.12 version of perdition blades/Bonereaver's edge on the release of BWL is not vanilla.
---
&gt;You'll get into raids, just probably not Naxx
---
This is only true if a raid is composed mainly of non optimal specs. If you're taking some here and there, Naxx won't be a problem either. You can probably clear naxx without being full T3 with less than 40 people.
---
Damn. Buzzkill. Haha
---
Do you know what catch-up gear is? It was literally implemented by Blizzard to allow players to get through earlier content like MC and BWL very fast or even possibly skip it in order to get to the more current content.
---
Classic youtubers crying in 3..2..1..
---
Nothing will change it anyway since they roll through content anyway with old or new gear
---
What does this mean for Rank 14 caster weapons? They were never reitemized and were originally released in 1.11 along with the PvP gear reitemization and Naxx. Will they be in released in phase 2 or will they be released in phase 5/6? This is important because if Blizzard is going to forego progressive itemization for progressive item releases then the Rank 14 caster weapons should be released towards the end of Classic. 
---
Overall, I like this move but I hope that they pay attention to little details like this. :)
---
&gt; That would be absolute chaos and turn people away right off the bat, for possibly even trying classic. I know for a fact when I login on launch day I dont want to fight against 400+ people to kill my kobold vermin.
---
Have experienced this first hand and your "alli's" will sit and farm them just to piss you off because they have that ping just slightly faster than yours. Hogger was a bitch. Nobody wanted to group and there was a circle of about 50 characters spamming tab and attack. It wasn't fun. At. All.
---
&gt; Outside of that, having a LFR to run 25 man ICC was sickening.
---
I don't think I can follow you properly. LFR as a system/difficulty did not exist until patch 4.3 of Cataclysm, which released at the end of November 2011 together with Dragon Soul. No prior raids have the LFR difficulty.
---
Currently on retail, LFR gear is so bad the gear from dailies (world quests) is better. The sole reason to actually run it is for raid specific loot and to see the bosses. And it is good that the LFR became irrelevant for anyone raiding normal and higher.
---
&gt; So, some stayed to try Cata, and some of us left a bad relationship. But eventually most people simply left, because it wasn‚Äôt the same quality of a relationship. She was too busy taking care of everyone, trying to be popular, instead of recognizing her self-worth and making them work to earn what she has to offer
---
Well, the first tier of Cata was definitely more hardcore, or rather difficult, than the first tier of Wrath. At least the heroics were. The problem was that Blizzard failed to actually make 10 and 25 man equal in terms of difficulty, as they changed them to reward the same gear. On several occasions 10 man(normal and heroic) was more difficult or rather broken than the 25 man version.
---
So, the beginning of Cata was definitely far less casual than the beginning of Wrath. 
---
The difference was that they started to accomodate more and more to the casual playerbase again by the middle (4.2 and heroic dungeon nerfs) and the end (4.3 and LFR). Cause I remember plenty of people whining because heroic dungeons were too difficult.
---
Sure, and it's pretty easy to find a spot in these casual guilds as a memespec in my experience from private servers. So it should be even easier in the less hardcore classic community. The majority of guilds are casual, and even these kinds of guilds will have no problem progressing and clearing raid tiers, except naxx really.
---
Yeah I was 16 and a piece of garbage.  At the time it felt like I was dispensing justice  so I never felt bad about it until years later. I have no idea why this guy, who I believe was an adult, needed the money. If he was on his last dollar or if he just wanted to make a quick buck.  If the later, I still kinda don't feel bad, but the other posibilities like family sickness or some unexpected expense, males me feel bad.
---
I never player MoP so I can't really say if this is true.
---
But my impression always was that the genereal consensus is that TBC was just the best expansion because it's late game content was the most fleshed out and challenging.
---
K3 has 1.12.1 stats and item gating based on patch. So it is essentially exactly like the route Blizz is taking with Classic.
---
Helloooooooooooooo
---
I see, you think account-sharing is a clean solution.
---
Tell me, exactly what part of having gbanks makes for a worse vanilla experience?
---
tank specs in general aren't great for PVP, especially AOE tanks like prot pally and bear druid. 
---
You'll be good at surviving attacks but you just won't do any damage and won't have buffed healing to help players either. 
---
Although I suppose you'd make a pretty good flag carrier in WG but that's about the only really nice benefit for PVP prot.
---
Items that were added during the original release of the game will be added during the appropriate phases. However, all items will be released in their 1.12 state.
---
Yeh lol, like If I meet a really cool feral druid or ret pally. I dont want to be like hey dude respec or find a different guild. Cause that just feels so assholish. And unnecessary
---
I'm not sure I understand. What about a Stratholme item that was added after Dire Maul patch, will it be phase 1 or phase 2 ?
---
Sadly they instantly killed [https://itemization.info/](https://itemization.info/) which was very practical to establish lists of gear.
---
Oh yeah let me just equip my spellweaver's turban and animated chain necklace so now I can power through MC and BWL
---
it starts with...
---
ONE THING, I DON'T KNOW WHY, IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY
---
Meh I‚Äôm just arguing class wise. I miss KJC and Meta.
---
Vanilla content was never challenging nor are they intending for it to be. The only way you could have an "authentic" experience would be for the entire community to have 0 knowledge about the fight mechanics or what comes with which patch.
---
No one in vanilla WoW collected gear in the hopes that it would one day be buffed to be usable or necessary. If they were to do progressive itemization then they would just be creating unnecessary competition over pieces that would be good for multiple classes at different phases.
---
...lvl 60 in full T3: ‚ÄúHah! Get gud scrub!‚Äù
---
It depends on your definition of opposite--i.e. inverse vs contrast. I would say hate is the inverse of love, not the opposite, which I would say is contrast.
---
By that same logic they should remove instances since the first MMOs didn't have those either. If you don't want people competing with your raid/dungeon then MMO is probably not for you.
---
Neither is buffing raid content? Except 1.12 items were in vanilla, and rebalance raid content never was. Do you not see how one of these things is not vanilla and the other one is late vanilla?
---
That's an unacceptable position to the nochanges crowd who firmly believe there should be no attempt to improve the game using a decade of hindsight to learn from
---
Yeah, wish I was coming into the game at that experience level. Lucky...
---
Hmmm. Overcoming a boss that whipped us 10dozen times was/is very much part of my vanilla memories and the reason I loved to play.    
---
Retail is bad because roflstomp.
---
I believe Asmongold and some other major content creators will still at least keep updated on their retail mains. There's no way that Asmongold is going to get behind in raid progression or mount farming. Maybe at first, but I think a lot of them will still play WoW, if even at a much much lower rate.
---
so as long as i have all the defense gears equipped i can spec fury for MC offtank?
---
Pretty much yeah. Doesn't make sense to me either, but apparently reddits fine and stuff like blue posts gets caught in a filter and blocked automatically.
---
This... just... it needs to be done! Just the thought... *hnnnnnngh*
---
The amount of knowledge available now will do more to trivialize the content than any amount of gear hotfixes could. 
---
It‚Äôs likely people will be able to 20 man MC in T2.
---
Certain items' stats changed between patches. Rather than try to replicate this, the final version of their stats in 1.12 will be used.
---
It's trivial regardless
---
It should be noted that none of the pservers actually know exactly the stats of mc and ony and it's often speculated that armor values are way off
---
tips is a min max no fun gay boy. i bet he would run a raid with 25 warriors and 15 priests
---
Ret is only bad if you want to do end game PvE. You might not be the dps leader in groups a lot but you'll be a good off tank/off healer that mages and rogues can't bring to a group. 
---
A lot of the specs people claim are unusuable are only unusable for high end content and not everyone has time for 40 man 5 hour raids so there's no problem being a ret pally doing 5 mans and pvp to your hearts content.
---
What the hell is wrong with you people??? Half of posts is about how you used to steal stuff from shops as kids!
---
Rage quit.
---
Still roles like ret paladins are in 99% of cases reserved for officers/leadership of a guild or their friends. You'll find joining a guild as nightmare as one.
---
They killed that site off just now after the announcement.
---
It doesn't say that at all though. Items will have 1.12.1 stats from the start. Stats will remain constant throughout the entirety of classic. Items that were added in later patches however will not drop until we hit that point/patch in progression.
---
Did you read the blue posts? Stat changes weren't meant as a catch-up and were just changed to be more aligned with how people used them. It makes more items competitive for those who aren't gonna farm multiple BiS items with a &lt;1% drop chance.
---
&gt; Knowledge about the fights because you farmed these instances for 3 years is far more valuable than some free hit from talents. 
---
Yeah sure it is, but at least it makes it just a bit harder. 
---
I remember the first time I went to MC. It was on Nostalrius and before DM was released. I was so hyped about this raid, my first 40-man ever. Unfortunately we went through it all up to Ragnaros in about 2 hours and we only stopped there because the tanks didn't have enough fire resistance. It was the guild's first MC run.
---
Needless to say I was really disappointed that nearly all the raidcontent was dead in two hours. I can imagine quite a few will never have stepped inside MC at level 60 before on Classic, and I'd hate for them to experience the same feeling of disappointment.
---
1.12 talents are nerfing all content before Naxx because overall classes performed much worse than on the Naxx release patch. 1.12 were in vanilla but they never had these stats on the release day of MC, on the release day of BWL/ZG/AQ etc. It's all nerfing current content. I don't give a shit about something "not being vanilla" we are not in vanilla in the first place because this mix of available/not available raid/dungeon content, limiting items that can drop etc is changing the way it all was. But making raids at least somewhat closer difficulty wise to their proper release stages would be a nice thing.
---
DPS and tanking why not healing gear?
---
i wonder if it's just your server or something? I just did it on a vanilla server about a month ago
---
Addons on Launch (which API)
---
Dungeon farming vanilla-like or changed
---
That should be about it
---
Sure is, but they can still do some tweaking and balancing. It sucks that we're gonna be playing vanilla but arcanite reaper is gonna be trash and bonereavers OP until ever
---
Yeah, those are some great ideas and I'd love to see stuff like that for seasonal wow servers in the classic environment.
---
Some of these reminds of the randomize zelda games that have been getting popular and perhaps some randomize versions of WoW classic could also be fun. Something like opening all raids at once and balancing them differently and let players figure out the proper gear progression.
---
To be fair, end game PvE is my preferred portion of the game PvP is side fun stuff to do in my off time content.
---
Another gameplay flavor? How is it bad?
---
it is not worth giving up 2 extra debuff slots for this
---
Hey Platinum! The puppet bit was brilliant. Thanks for making such refreshing and well made content.
---
I think it's because Reddit is classified by most firewalls as social media and not "gaming." Depending on the company's individual policies, social media might be allowed, but gaming almost never is.
---
I am talking about Sharding. And because it wasnt in vanilla and it will do nothing but harm the game. Why would people even switch from private servers when its gonna be worse then private vanilla servers. This decision is idiotic on so many levels it hurts my head.
---
 &lt;Get of Fenris&gt; - Horde - NA West - PvP Server - Mediumcore  
---
**What‚Äôs it mean?**: 
---
‚ÄúFenrir‚Äù or ‚ÄúFenris‚Äù is the big bad wolf god from Norse mythology who bites off Tyr‚Äôs hand (ring some bells?), straight-up kills Odin, and casually ushers in Ragnarok aka the apocalypse.  The word ‚Äúget‚Äù in noun form means: an offspring or the total of the offspring. Thus ‚ÄúGet of Fenris‚Äù translates roughly into ‚Äúthe children of the wolf god who brings about the end times‚Äù.  
---
**Our Philosophy**: 
---
Despite our scary name (meant to strike fear into the hearts of the Alliance) The culture is a peaceful gaming environment free of bigotry and general ‚Äúgamer rudeness‚Äù and one in which mistakes are expected to be corrected with regards to guild events such as raiding or PvP premades. Most of us are older than your typical gamer at this point in our lives, and we demand maturity from our members, you know - like how people expect one to act in the real world.   
---
**So what about loot and stuff?**: 
---
We will be using a EPGP point system for loot distribution and priority. The system rankings for loot priority will be charted on our webpage for transparency. EPGP is superior to DKP for many reasons that a quick google search will tell you. Certain BiS (Best-in-Slot) items from 40-man raids may have pre-requirements to purchase with EPGP. The MT will be loot counseled items during all progression.   
---
**What Gets us apart**:   
---
We have a built-from-the-ground-up donation system where players may contribute materials and consumables to the guild bank to gain EP and raise their loot priority. This allows top performers an edge, and those who may be busy with life to still have access to end-game consumables if they were unable to farm them. It also provides the guild bank income which will be passed down to our raids. Do you like free enchants? So do we.  
---
PvP has always been a passion of many of our members, as such ***we will have an in-house bounty system for world PvP in which players can earn EP for the collection of ‚Äúscalps‚Äù (screenshotted 1v1 or 2v2 kills of bounty targets listed on our webpage).*** This gives incentive for higher level players to assist lowbies just trying to level who may be getting camped (PvP server), and allows for hardcore PvPers to gain some loot priority in raids. Plus we think it‚Äôs cool.   
---
A lot of guilds will tell you they encourage a mature playing environment, and they are likely being truthful. Few guilds actually achieve this, but do trust it is a top priority for us so that we may all enjoy our hobby. During raids we demand focus, but we also know how to have fun. We never allow bigotry to go unchecked, and although we sometimes disagree, we respect everyone in and out of guild. We do not brag of our successes, and we believe recognition is achieved through action. Many of us have known each other for going on 15 years or longer and we have already have a strong community. We really look forward to starting a new chapter on Classic and hope we‚Äôre a good fit for you!
---
**A Brief History**: 
---
GoF has been a gaming community since 2004 with several hundred members over many MMOs in as many years. We started on Vanilla WoW, achieved a lot of end-game raiding and PvP success, and generally played the game like few then could.   
---
**Raid Times**: TBD but likely evenings during the week, and early day during weekends (to allow for night activities IRL)  
---
**Guild Priorities**: Raiding 40-man content (3 days weekly) and PvP (When not raiding. Premades and 20-man content will be ran on non-raid days).

Drop us a line under and let‚Äôs talk Classic! Our server is already very active with players getting ready.  
---
Not playing Horde? Ask about our IRL friends who are rolling Alliance and are good solid raiders. Even though we‚Äôre gonna like, gank them and stuff.
---
They understand quite clearly. They just don't agree with those that want progressive itemization. I personally couldn't care less either way.
---
Regardless, they have decided. All items will have 1.12.1 stats from day one, with item gating for items added in later patches.
---
Whether or not people agree, they've made a choice.
---
But much more players would put MC on a farm and inflate the value of having Thunderfury/Sulfuras with OP 1.12 version of gear from bosses.
---
Spoken like someone who didn‚Äôt do 40man raids.
---
This is bullshit people prefer the private server with the most population to play with.
---
Congratulations!  Is this your first baby?
---
was totally planning on taking some time off for launch but my coworker (and the one who would cover for me) is taking 6 weeks of maternity leave in mid june so i'll probably just take some time when he gets back
---
Is anyones opinion relevant?
---
I mean, Orgrimmar was built with the help of the taurens, trolls, and orcs.
---
Still, it makes sense that Stormwind turned out prettier and sturdier due to the fact that all three societies are pretty functional and at least medieval in their structure, whereas all the Horde races are outcasts and nomads. Renown architects, designers, and engineers were probably not lining up as they were unlikely to exist on the Horde side.
---
The rank 7-9 gear is much easier to obtain and will be insanely good for many classes when it's released in phase 2. I think blizz may need to rethink releasing that gear so early.
---
You can never ever have all the difficulty that came from original vanilla. Shit man internet speed alone is a bigger factor in raid dps than 1.12 talents. You should require everyone to throttle their internet when they enter a raid to make it more vanilla like.
---
Like knowledge and computer capabilities have drastically advanced which trivialize the content. Not 1.12 talents...
---
LFR destroys the core gameplay element of social gameplay. If you really only care about completing bleeding edge content that's as hard as possible and don't care about the other main aspects that make vanilla wow different, then go do some mythic raiding in retail. It's a lot harder than anything in Vanilla.
---
Play it, doesn't matter if you're a noob or not. Theres tons of people who love to help noobs. you'll have random people come up to you going out of their way to just give you a 2 min buff. Give you potions and random elixirs or help you with a quest that you're having problem with as he sees you struggling passing by. Don't be intimidated by the elitists you see on the internet. We welcome you with opening arms &lt;3
---
It seems to me that we get constantly more information but this ‚Äùall we need to know now‚Äù -list always stays the same lenght lol
---
People just don't want to be limited to a small amount of guilds as like a ret paladin or something like that. Limited often means having to raid thursday period, making your options incredibly small.
---
Hence any normal raiding class/spec would offer the person way more options guild-social/time/community wise.
---
Who cares what was said in the bluepost? Stats were upgraded and upgraded too much. It's not only about having "spirit or agi" on warrior items, it's also making weapons and certain item pieces busted as hell with enormous damage values or with crit/hit stats slapped on them.
---
&gt;a heal druid back then you was bottom in heal after all melee crusader proccs
---
Hilarious ! He was just AFK wasn't he ?
---
How will this affect PvP gear? My understanding is that PvP gear got a huge buff in the later stage of the game, and this would make it wayyyy too powerful early on?
---
I didn‚Äôt downvote you friend. I‚Äôm the one looking for advice!
---
The only change that Wrath would really need is No XRDF (keep the one Wrath started with). 
---
And maybe delaying the tournament phase a lot longer so Ulduar's content has time to breathe without a loot-pinata with superior gear coming out so quickly.
---
Those were the two main changes that caused Wrath to stumble.
---
I'm not actually sure about that. I have a memory of arriving at the place where I died but there was no corpse to speak of. The marker on the map remained, the popup reappeared, but there was no corpse. I might have dreamed that or it was a bug, I can't say.
---
What, no??
---
Items will have the stats they had in 1.12, but boss drop tables will follow the phases.
---
Nice try. You just want us to run out of the starting zones so you can have it all to yourself.
---
goes against the current swing...
---
I agree with you OP, but I also understand why Blizzard is doing it their way though. I think once the game is in full swing and they start either releasing new servers or resetting old ones they will learn from some of these early design decisions.
---
what
---
&gt; to ~~your~~ your pre pre bis pet 
---
Ftfy :D
---
Curious. Maybe they redid it every Wednesday maintenance? Or the corpse respawns when the character logs in again?
---
Yeah prolly true for Asmongold since WoW is all he plays still.He's just too invested now and come so far. But I think Soda could care less for the current wow since he is often playing numerous other games and expresses his desire to play Classic, or even private servers if he could on stream.
---
Sit will get you crited alright but won't proc any talent.
---
&gt; If you want to see endgame, what really matters is that you join an organized guild and just show up ready to play your role to the max
---
And if you chose to play feral or ret, you don't have that oppurtunity.
---
Don't get me wrong, there will be plenty of guilds who willl try to raid but never kill Ragnaros as they will be filled with people who refuses to do the tiniest thing to help others, so they'll have loot drama for all of eternity and should they ever manage to "kill" domo, none of them will have spent the couple to do the quintessence quest anyway.
---
Only a few people per server will even have good enough pvp gear to really matter in raids by the time phase 4 or 5 hits. More people might have them when Naxx hits, but then the game is basically "over" for cutting edge players anyway.
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt think MC or ONY need tuning for a lot of people that become raiders they may be as far as they get. While I get that for a minority of the population this is disappointing I think it‚Äôs going to be fine. They weren‚Äôt difficult raids after people figured them out even with progressive itemization.
---
Yes the rank 7-9 stuff is actually pretty easy to get, luckily it isn't insanely strong, but it does beat most pre-MC gear and even some MC pieces for dps. It may end up being more practical to grind BGs instead of doing dungeons for this gear, especially for more casual players who just have an hour or so to play at a time.
---
All bow to the all-knowing GameStop employee lol.
---
I predict the opposite. No one has money and will be posting for a bit less, perhaps 10% above vendor.
---
Yep! I wanna upvote this twice
---
This. Death to min/maxers
---
IDGAF; I'm not likely to get into raiding in classic. Period.
---
In current WoW, raiding is something I simply don't have the time for anymore - not to mention *zero* of my friends want to do it now. I'm going to get into classic specifically because of questing - I never, ever got the opportunity to do the majority of quests in the old world. Now I will.
---
Most of the quests in the old world are things you can do solo - I plan on taking my time and enjoying myself, rather than doing what I *used* to do back when I was in a raiding group. I spent most of my early times levelling as fast as humanly possible so I could get to the end game and grind with my friends. I wish I hadn't - they were *enormous* flakes. It wasn't unusual for us to miss raid nights simply because someone had decided not to play that day for whatever reason, usually without telling anyone else.
---
By the time I burned out on raiding it was early pandaria - ironically although my guild told me as I was leaving that they'd found someone else to take up my slot and they'd be fine, a few months later I came back only to find the guild disbanded and nobody playing anymore.
---
I want to take my time and do things when and where I want to - maybe I'll get bored with just questing at some point and try to do raiding. Maybe I'll just leave - but fact is, I had more fun doing things by myself most of the time than actually grinding to get into raids - some of which I never actually *got* into.
---
his orientation is irrelevant too
---
Thank you, everyone that has responded has made more even more excited for wow classic so thank you very much
---
Haha what? No it is based on the old 7.3.5 as that was the current engine when they began to make the engine compatible with the old 1.12 assets.
---
Before it was patched out, I would C.O.D. useless grey items to gold farming accounts.
---
In general I pride myself on being a very trustworthy guy. 
---
However back in Vanilla i was a chubby little 13 year old who got made fun of by my so called  'friends' both IRL and in online games. Nothing all that serious thinking back, but just general teasing and things like being the only one demoted to 'peon' in the Halo clan even though i was quite good at the game.  
---
Anyways, about 10-12 of us played back then and for some reason people were very free giving out account info so i decided to enact a little revenge. 
---
To make a long story short, there was this kid, Alex, in our class who it seemed all my friends would try to impress at my expense. So i decided to log onto the wow account of everyone mean to me and frame Alex for stealing their gold and materials. 
---
It actually worked and no one ever found out it was me. Thinking back i don't regret doing it because it wasn't that much gold (leveling as 13 year olds) and as my only friends in the world, they really did make me feel bad some times.  Definitely not something i'd ever do again lol
---
*Some* of them are asking that, but some are asking "is everyone an uptight tryhard asshole who won't let me into their group, as some people on this sub suggest, or will I still be able to find casual groups sometimes?"
---
What are the drop rates on the bonkers items though? Will it be balanced so that only a few people or those who have the time to no-life grind them will have them?
---
The API will be tweaked. It will be completely custom. It will have certain functions added from the 1.12 client, but with some restrictions, then probably many of the 8.xx client functions, but probably with some limitations also
---
There will not be a "hey, we're using X.XX addon API"
---
No one denies that. But certain things, like boss armor, can be
---
calculated by the formulas like armor when you compare stats of characters shown in videos of old vanilla days compared to the damage that boss actually received.
---
Made me*
---
If you plan to rush from launch you will be fine. You will reach 60 faster than most people. That means not so many people will be after the devilsaur set when you reach 60, but the hardcore will have farmed the leather already. The demand won't be that high at first so prices won't go up too much. And as a hunter, you can farm gold better than anyone at this point with Mara farm. So buying the set shouldn't be an issue. It's just a matter of choice what you want to purchase first, mount, devilsaur, 300 engineering... When my T1 pants dropped I didn't use them immediatly because the devilsaur set bonus is that good.
---
Loot tables will follow the phases. So items added in the AQ patch will begin dropping when the AQ phase is live. 
---
The stats on items will be the same throughout Classic. So the T2 Warrior helm will have defense from the get go instead of changing stats.
---
There are always fools that think a sub 1% procrate on tier1 is viable.
---
RIP 2015-2019
---
That‚Äôs the best time to play though, they sleep a lot

Hii all, as [promised yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bhbhxi/name_generator_tool_generate_character_names_for/elrgcd9?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) here is the other tool I've been working on, this one should help navigate vanilla Azeroth efficiently! Fair warning here, it's completely untested in the real world and the data here is collected old vanilla addons and videos. 
---
That being said I think its pretty accurate, some notes though:
---
* All tram, ships and zeppelins are set to 120 seconds of travel - it's about 60 seconds for travel and 60 seconds to wait for it etc. (I will adjust this as per feedback)
---
* Flight points for the Zeppelins / Ships might be their own points in the future - for example the Zeppelin outside Undercity
---
* Some durations are wrong, like Orgrimmar to Thunderbluff (I think)
---
* Flight path "Nighthaven, Moonglade" is not yet visually represented as druid-only
---
* Cost of the trip is not yet calculated, I'll probably wait until classic release for that
---
* You will always get recommended the tram from Stormwind to Ironforge, I'll probably have an option at some point to exclude / include the tram
---
* Yes, it's true that some flight paths are faster in one direction and slower in the other. For example: [Orgrimmar to Everlook](https://classictinker.com/flight-master/?fromLoc=Orgrimmar%2C+Durotar&amp;toLoc=Everlook%2C+Winterspring&amp;faction=horde) and [Everlook to Orgrimmar](https://classictinker.com/flight-master/?fromLoc=Everlook%2C+Winterspring&amp;toLoc=Orgrimmar%2C+Durotar&amp;faction=horde)
---
Possible Future Features:
---
* Ability to set your hearthstone location, and take that into account when finding the best route
---
* Set flight points as visited or unvisited, so you can find a path based on what points you currently know
---
* Find the cheapest route

Original Launch: A few EQ/DAoC players and some War3 fans march out to Gamestop to pick up a physical copy and play the game. Influx of players is spread out over months as word of mouth spreads about this fun new game.
---
Classic Launch: Millions of BfA players, Hearthstone players, Diablo 3 players, and the remaining 6 HotS players all have Classic shoved right in their face just a click away thanks to the B.net launcher, not to mention some fraction of the millions who have left WoW over time.
---
The Classic launch is different, it has different problems, and needs different solutions. The only way to get playable Classic on day 1 is to have so many servers that we'll end up with dead servers in a month. And to everybody suggesting server mergers as a solution to this, you basically just made a shittier version of sharding.
---
Im really hoping they do this tbh.
---
What is the sharding question? Hasn‚Äôt it been addressed?
---
It‚Äôs gonna be easy anyways you guys make MC out to be so much more difficult than it ever was or will be.
---
If nothing is hidden sure. But you dont know if bosses had hidden mitigation or changes. Lots of boss mechanics had hidden elements that players or pservers have no idea how to recreate
---
Yes, that much we know, but some facts stated by blizzard would be great at this point.
---
Quick question. Why cant you just go the blizzard web page and read the information there?
---
Druid is one of the least populated classes in the polls and class distribution graphs posted here? The colors for Druid and Warrior are very similar but Druid is last on both Alli and Horde graphs.
---
How is your guild possibly going to achieve that? In 7 days of release to clear whole MC, when the fastest recorded 1-60 was over 4 and half days PLAYED. That required like 65% time to get to 60 in record time, without any sleep. If you were to sleep 7 hours a night and play all the other time in full efficiency, you could reach 60 in that record time. Then you would also need 39 others to do the same + gear up for MC at least in some way.
---
Ahh Forest-Stump might have it far more right than I do!
---
OP items of MC and Ony are going to help to decimate the shit out BWL too on the release day, fully clear it and snowball even further.
---
I will not be doing this, but I love how it exists in the game... super cool.
---
This was standard play in the day for EQ.  Camping bosses was srs bzness
---
Yes, but it's going to be even *easier*.
---
Madseason's video on the matter a month later: 
---
I'm just glad that we're able to have classic WoW guys. Whether or not a helm gives spirit or not, I'm just happy to be playing the game and be able to relive my nostalgia.
---
Even with patch-appropriate class changes it would be trivial.
---
The plan is to find a decent raiding guild as soon as I hit 60. Shouldn't be too hard since I got plenty of mythic raiding experience from retail.
---
I'll guess you will find out if we achiev our goal.
---
but it does mean youll have dungeons blues that are bis until naxx
---
I know their foundation for the API is the 8.xx version, I just hope they remove a lot of the stupid one-button rotation macros. Like /castsequence.
---
They already said in a previous post that the PvP gear would be in its 1.12 state.
---
So... make a CHANGE and make it more difficult?? :-O
---
The whole thing's a joke. It's like rolling a new char on aug 22 2006, which has got to be the lamest wow experience in the history of the game.  Or another way: you're paying for a blizzard owned &amp; operated pserver.
---
3-4 hour raids once or twice a week is absolutely casual raiding, which is what you originally said.
---
So yes, casual raiding is absolutely going to be a thing in classic, just like it was in vanilla.

Another piece of spell hit gear: [https://classicdb.ch/?item=12103](https://classicdb.ch/?item=12103)
---
I mean, I always said it was pretty obvious they were going to to this, specially because they only have the 1.12 data, and they seure as hell won't be using cached thottbot and private servers as a source to chck the previous state of item X.
---
It's really not the same. Many games have items you get early that you can use later. Like a key that opens a dungeon, or a potion that helps you get past an obstacle. Intelligent gamers will know to save the items for those moments. In a DnD pre-made campaign I got an axe that does additional damage to certain types of creatures. I hadn't encountered those creatures yet, but it's easy for me to decide whether I should hang onto it or not in case I do. 
---
Fewer games would have you progress through the game, then patch it to change an item to actual be useful, and you can't use any sort of natural intuition to determine that will happen. Like if I sold the axe from the DnD example, and later the DM tells later, "Oh hey, I retroactively buffed that axe you sold."
---
That's why an official statement from Blizzard on this is absolutely necessary. If they don't communicate we have no way of helping them.
---
Mythic raiding in retail means nothing for me because items on the retail are meaningless with Titanforge, autoscaling and bunch of other disgusting garbage. I am actually happy to get easy gear from raids so I would waste as low time as possible on boring Vanilla raids (at least boring until AQ) and would be able to outdoor PvP with items from raids. But I worry about people that actually want at least some challenge from raids and bringing overall more authentic experience of vanilla with difficulty atleast a little closer to the original.
---
*looks away*
---
MC/Ony are the most entry level of all entry level raids. High end raiding guilds still ran it to the end of the expansion for legendary parts/mats/T2 pants. It wasn't uncommon for half the raid to be pugs because at a certain point you just needed bodies.
---
It is a concern, but in reality, very few people will get those weapons before AQ (and even after)
---
In complete agreement with Cross realm dungeon finder and LFR. The social aspect of the game went way way down with the implementation of each of these.
---
As much as some people hate having to look for groups in chat, it's a worth while cost to pay to have a better sense of community.
---
&gt; Money sync with buying arrows though?
---
Arrow cost is negligible is compared to all the other expenses you'll have.
---
We should all crowdsource an account that just stands in front of SW and greets everyone coming in, forever
---
They don't have the data for it as well. In blizzcon they said they were basically "lucky" to find a working 1.12 backup on their servers.
---
Must have forgot to drag the new rank spells to his bar after visiting the trainer
---
I think they announced 1.12 AVs a month ago, my dude.
---
You can never have the same difficulty but you can have difficulty close to the original as much as it's possible.
---
More than likely he just wanted to make a quick buck.  Family sickness or unexpected expense I probably would do the same thing he did, but i definitely wouldn't have trusted a 16 year old kid even if we spoke on the phone lol.  
---
If on his last dollar without the unexpected expensive he probably could have made $400 with a real job much quicker than farming $2k gold in vanilla wow. That must have taken forever if he wasn't a full time gold farmer.
---
So you are saying... druid with goblin jumper cables then?
---
so just for the lulz?
---
I'm curious if that includes the T0.5 sets.  The post makes it sound like these will still be added later in the classic lifecycle, but I always felt like they should've been in from the beginning.  
---
There's really very little reason to go through the trouble of completing all those quests to get them, especially not by the time they actually come out.
---
GvG?
---
They just gave an easy to understand example dude, chill
---
And your being petty but that‚Äôs just my oppinion.
---
Thanks for the input, a lot to think about!
---
Glad to hear! and you're very welcome.
---
The only versions you'll see on any items in WoW Classic are their 1.12 versions.
---
Maybe it‚Äòs fun for him. If someone has the time for such things it‚Äôs okay I guess. Maybe he has no job/a lot of time to spare. 
---
For me the sharding is totally fine. Sitting there for two hours to finish one quest isn‚Äòt fun IMO.
---
Which is a bummer, was still a cool site to see the past items
---
You need level 5 to learn a profession.
---
I don't care if it makes content easier.  I am worried that having all of these BiS blue items in the game at launch will give people less incentive to clear content for loot when they already have better gear than what MC can provide.
---
Its easy to make content, but will it be "good" content. Thats what blizzard has been struggling with lately
---
its not just about destroying the content, its about the fun of progressively upgrading your gear. with no progressive itemisation in some cases you could have dungeon blues be bis to naxx. i guess it just feels less fun to sit on the same item for a year
---
So every class tbh
---
Adult Protip/hack: Use a credit card that gives a % cashback for groceries, and use your cc to buy game time (or steam giftcards) at Walmart. 
---
If you buy a lot of games or gametime like I do, it all adds up.
---
It's not the same from your DnD perspective but the same from my angle that I approach these items.
---
Ok, so let's make it even less competitive and even more unbalanced, lol.
---
You can technically level in each spec, as you still got baseline class skills every level, or every other level.
---
So you absolutely could level as a holy priest, even shadow might be smoother and quicker.
---
And in the early game, to about mid 50s in level, you could for instance level as a shadow priest, but heal in dungeons without much gear swapping.
---
Prosper and long live - Yoda
---
And I am not denying that, again.
---
I befriended many shit guild GM's, officers and stuff and would spend time in their ventrilos often with the sole intent to eventually steal their Molten core instances so that we could clear the rest after they would go in kill the first 2, 3 bosses and call it a night
---
Wasn't rare where we would kill Ragnaros two to 3 times a week
---
When stock drops they companies take less risks, 
---
The less risky move is to make tbc, not new vanilla content
---
I had a shitty kids AOL email address that was like "AwesomeWarlockOfDestruction93" that I ended up ditching obviously.
---
What? But they answered the question for all of those items.
---
"Compared to having the whole raid, equipped with 3-6 items each, which are substantially more powerful than alternate items originally available prior to patch 1.10."  
---
Yes, this be the case. ANY item that was buffed throughout the course of WoW will be in the game, from the get go, in its 1.12 version UNLESS It is content gated.
---
Whatever the stats were in 1.12, those are the stats they will have. 
---
Other than that, I don't really understand your point. Blizzard understood completely. They used the Tier 2 helm because uhh duh, they had to pick one item to talk about, and it having spirit was just a nice comedy point about how useless spirit is to any warrior.
---
I was also thinking gear for specs that don't get gear elsewhere, like ret, balance etc
---
I was just using it as it died lol. Please bring it back the advanced search was super useful.
---
I didn't know 13 year olds could have one.
---
I think their last on it was they are thinking of how to implement a solution to the early zone impactedness. I don't think theyve come out and stated their intentions for the implementation.
---
Will it be just Northshire Abbey, 1-5 zones? all of the 1-10 zone? Will we have sharding for Elywnn and Westfall type zones? How long would it last? Is there sharding in cities, pvp zones? How long do they intend for it to last?
---
Or perhaps no sharding, dynamic spawns? Queue times?
---
Ultimately we are looking to solve two problems, launch day playability and long term population health.
---
No, you can have difficulty as close to your MEMORY of the original as possible. This is a big misconception, people got a lot better at video games over the years. So it may have seemed hard 15 years ago, but sucking at games+better cpus+better internet speed. Doesn't mean you crank up boss difficulty to 300. There are people that will experience your perception of how difficult it was even with 1.12 and etc etc. They will whine raids are too hard. You shouldn't fluctuate difficulty for every whiner on reddit. You should stick to 1:1 difficulty
---
smart decision, doing it any other way would be a nightmare for players to keep track of
---
I feel like besides BRE and a few other items this isn't a big deal at all. If they just made an exception for BRE and other super powerful items I think that would be enough.
---
Did the same thing in human starting area on my orc hunter with the wolves!
---
Not really any news here. Just a confirmation that items are their 1.12 form....well no shit.
---
Molten Core is the easiest MMO raid content ever created. Regardless of patch. This changes nothing.
---
I don‚Äôt see this as a problem because the people that clear bel first attempt would have done so regardless of itemization.
---
There's plenty of casual players out there (like me). Play when you want, how you want.
---
It's purely in the starting areas... Big deal, after the first 2 hours of gameplay you'll never even notice it again.
---
Sounds good to me!
---
He borrowed it from https://www.joanasworld.com/azeroth.htm
---
Blizzard is blocked at work, Reddit is not
---
Ah the good old days of ‚Äúfuck it, 37 is good enough.‚Äù
---
OP must be below level 20 then
---
I think that‚Äôs exactly what they did. They‚Äôre matching gear drops added to loot tables in later patches to match up with the phased releases. Sounds to me like we won‚Äôt get gear from 1.10 until Phase 5 is released.
---
Then my advice would be : if you're not a casual, plan to raid consistently in a guild that can clear current content and don't mind being the victim for a few months go for it !
---
In fact my advice would be if you play on a PVP server, whatever your class, you have to raid to get the same gear than the others. Even a non gear dependent class won't be able to do anything if they're dungeon blue and the opponents are T3 / R14.
---
And btw, engineering is absolutely mandatory and if you can get an alt to farm herbs + alchi it would be good too (you can of course buy your potions, but it's going to get expensive very fast).
---
A warrior with engi and potions will find life much better in PVP.
---
I remember walking to Blockbusters and buying these. I'd do the same again but all Blockblusters have closed down :'(
---
I like it.
---
&gt; This means that while content will be unlocked progressively to allow for each raid tier to shine, systems such as class design, battleground mechanics, and stats on existing items will all be set to their final 1.12 conditions
---
I'm 100% on board with this philosophy. Well-reasoned post, and it's always good to see the devs show how much thought they're putting into what they're doing and why.
---
GETHYPE
---
Sort of, but as they detail in this post, most of those changes were to bring items in line with the balance/expectations of the players, in the example they give with the Warrior helmet, it doesn't seem like a very big deal. I'd imagine the vast majority of the use cases are like that one.
---
"...That experience can‚Äôt be recreated, because the knowledge can‚Äôt be unlearned. For a long time after Patch 1.4.0 came out, many players simply had no idea how good Obsidian Edged Blade or Aged Core Leather Gloves were. The power of weapon skill will be no surprise in WoW Classic."
---
How about making BfA and next expansions this exciting then? Looks like some knowledge CAN be unlearned. It's the knowledge of making good games.
---
Don't get nightfall. 
---
Don't spam wing clip.
---
Would destroy all the fun in the gearing process for me honestly.
---
I will probably be co leading a guild that we build from our server population after launch.
---
I obviously yes-way I said it, douche. THAT SAID, I went ahead and looked it up, and turns out you were right and it really was I who was speaking out of my ass. Not only are there BC &amp; WOTLK servers, there are servers for all the other expansions too. All together, the population for these other PSs outnumber that of Vanilla substantially.
---
This is actually great to know as I now understand that Blizz will probably just relaunch all expansions and I want nothing to do with it. 
---
Unless there should come a day where they state their commitment to sticking to Vanilla Classic, I‚Äôm checking out of this sub and staying away from this game.
---
It was literally in the CDN that the employees are in the Alpha of. The base client updates with retail.
---
He wants to clear mc in 25 mins instead of 18 mins with a chance at wiping on one boss, the real vanilla experience
---
I've cleared all vanilla raids on multiple private servers.
---
Thanks for the baseless insult though. :)
---
Yeah I still want to look up what items were added in 1.10, since those won't be in the game
---
We wont get gear added in 1.10 until Phase 5.  But we will have access to gear that existed prior to 1.10 that was tweaked in 1.10 patch. 
---
Im saying those tweaked items shouldnt be in the game until phase 5 either.
---
&gt; Like if I sold the axe from the DnD example, and later the DM tells later, "Oh hey, I retroactively buffed that axe you sold."
---
Except in this case it's "you loot this axe, and oh btw, it's getting buffed later"
---
Playing TBC server right now after years of vanilla. TBC is fucking amazing and I really wish we had some classic TBC servers
---
I have no memory of Vanilla, it's all coming from a general understanding of mechanics how the game works and realizing how these items would influence overall gameplay experience. You should compare how much better items were back in a day by simulating the DPS/survivability/manastability etc of characters and making a proper decision on how many raids should be buffed, or at least make it closer without any buffing by making items in their original state. Even private servers buffed Naxx and people still cleared it up.
---
You might have to click frostbolt 3-4 extra times on each boss?
---
Nah you spam firebolt in the endgame raids :D
---
I agree with playing whatever keeps you happy and motivated. If that class/spec choice ends up being so called "non-viable" spec like a moonkin, be sure to put in that extra effort with consumables, tactics etc to prove that even if you dont top the meters, you serve as a motivator and a good example to everyone else.
---
blocked as a gaming website
---
Do it my man!
---
95% of the time, you play shadow with a Resto in the group and DPS your face off + be a Mana battery.
---
5% of the time, they don't have a healer and you're forced to respec and have to keep a healing set
---
Either way you're needed 100% of the time.
---
So buffing naxx effectively did nothing? Damn glad you're aware that buffing content doesn't change anything except make it impossible for more people to clear the content. Which is fine but now people will complain about the top .01%instead of 1%. What a glorious change
---
If they do expansions it'll be as completely seperate servers for that expansion. Maybe with an option to transfer a character from the previous one.
---
Changing the old one would just start the whole process all over again with people wanting classic back.
---
So might as well just bite the bullet and make new servers.
---
People who enjoy classic can play classic.
---
People who liked classic but want to continue can transfer and keep going.
---
People who didn't like classic and didn't play but liked that expansion come out of the wood work.
---
And it requires a lot less effort to make it all work.
---
Phase 1 TBC Legacy would be pretty much indentical to Phase 6 Classic, just with some new talents and a few mechanical tweaks.
---
The big changes to old world content, sans the new starting areas, wouldn't happen until like Phase 3 TBC. (though TBC is a bit of an odd-ball as all the content up to T5 was available from the Day of release, you just had to work your way up the attunement path to get there).
---
Likewise Wrath Phase 1 would be basically just TBC Phase 5 except for boat changes at SW/MH, the DK section of EPL opened up, and the Horde's new Zepplin towers.
---
PepeLaugh Esfand
---
But a certain amount of people that would otherwise struggle on these bosses, with a bunch of 1.12 BREs and with legendary weapons will also beat all the bosses instead of wiping there and progressing naturally.
---
Hi, /u/Foghe
---
She should look at her map
---
From a Priest POV: 2 changes on BiS list. A ring from LBRS and last boss staff from BRD is actually viable now. I think, compared to how hard they are to obtain, I think it will be fine.
---
I love this
---
I run my own private server for testing and practicing levelling. I keep it running twenty four hours a day but I‚Äôm the only person that ever connects to it. I often find myself thinking about that world that exists only in my computer. I‚Äôm sat watching tv right now but upstairs in my office, there‚Äôs a whole world going about its business. Ships traverse the oceans. Vendors and artisans go about their business. Rabbits skip through the woods. And dark powers scheme in the darkest recesses of the world. I find that thought very comforting.
---
Makes it impossible for some people, makes it harder and interesting for other people. Having content impossible for people is good in MMORPGs. I am more than fine with "plebs" not being able to clear Naxx as much as me being pleb compared to Scarab Lord having his title unlike me.
---
That's what I'm thinking as well. Make the wife give me her chars silver to help pay for it early Haha.
---
This guy knows whats up, they are trying to emulate Valves way of doing things.
---
Try to make the asset as autonomous as possible so it becomes a passive income with very little matinence
---
It was annoying having to delete shit every patch, because your client isn't showing the updates.
---
I think the biggest impact will be the pvp gear. I don't know about other sets, but the hunter pvp gear is fucking incredible. Even the blue set is really strong, and items like the gloves will be BIS even over Naxx gear.
---
I think it would be awesome if they kept the classic gameplay and leveling but made new raids with new gear for us to tackle.
---
Yes mine because its the most important obviously!
---
Irrelevant raids are piss easy
---
What happens after naxx
---
Yeah I love the min maxing here. People beg for the progressive itemization to make it harder, but then all but demand you only play the most optimal spec...
---
If you actually want to make it a challenge, try to bring 5 of every class (since youll need ultimately 8 warriors, if you plan on going to naxx, so maybe 8 warriors, 4 druids, 4 hunter, 4 lock). Let at least one druid, priest, sham, paladin play dps. Let your pures raid in pvp specs.
---
Actually gimp yourselves. want it to be tough? refuse to use world buffs, refuse consumables until AQ.
---
So paladin tier 2 will start with spell power? Early patch it was high plus healing
---
Well some of us didn‚Äôt sign up for the wife and child, 60 in 2 days
---
If you don't have the time to play then an MMO isn't for you. Asking for them to cater to the slowest of the slow is pretty damn self centered and ignorant.
---
happy to continue the wow legacy of college students
---
This guy is a goober SchubertWalk
---
&gt; This decision is idiotic on so many levels it hurts my head.
---
If your head is hurting it's probably because it appears that you have severe brain damage.
---
Nothing he said was wrong. Ret is a joke in pve.
---
Trueee
---
I started in TBC and want to learn the vanilla bosses slowly and feel like i'm rewarded for it. If they rush other content and I don't experience half of it, that would suck.
---
lol. 
---
Ill worry about that late 2020.
---
Knowing how the closest reimagination of classic is going to work is all i need to know for now.
---
Never did mythic so I have no way to compare. I do know that everything had challenges. Every level, profession, dungeon had it's challenges. Completing something was a reward in itself. At least that's how I felt.
---
I love timelapse videos. I hope you do!
---
You understand in vanilla all the hybrids and shit would have cleared naxx if they had more time in vanilla? It wasn't a difficulty thing it was a time available thing. Vanilla content is gated by time spent playing not by difficulty. Difficulty is a retail raid mentality not a vanilla wow one. And it will destroy vanilla raiding. It has no place in this content.
---
I work in the restaurant industry. 
---
I will literally never get to raid unless I find a West coast guild that raids at midnight.
---
‚ÄúAnalysis starts at 8:40‚Äù literally lmao. Esfand milking that cow for all it‚Äôs worth
---
FYI, you can only disenchant green or better.
---
My sincere hope is classic is very successful, we sit on naxx patch hard for 3 years or more while we wait in anticipation as hype builds up and they start releasing more raids,  like in wetlands, hyjal, and others you mentioned.
---
At least every day is one less day. We got the loot trading news over a month ago, and that feels like yesterday. Only 3 more chunks like that and we‚Äôre home!
---
I think it is insanely strong for being released as early as phase 2. Maybe since there aren't any BGs until phase 3 it will lessen the impact, though.
---
Really good post and really do not know why people wanted every change ever made
---
Pretty much.
---
Man i leveled up an alliance toon(for this purpose) and would get parties together to "gank horde lowbies" tell them to meet somewhere and me and my guidlies on the horde side would just swarm em and grief the shit outta them until they logged out. It was super fun in retrospec haha
---
No I plan on the game being social again. I'll log in just to play with friends and have a good time.
---
I'm rolling this build for PvP and healing in PvE content: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/A8zUxAAEzw3_MA
---
Spiritual Focus over Divine Intellect for a chance of not losing casting time when getting hit and trying to heal.
---
Improved BoM and SotC in my mind is more beneficial than the small %'s Benediction or Deflection give
---
Improved Ret Aura and Sanctity Aura is something im struggling deciding right now, I need to log onto a "place" to really test the two out. 
---
Now with my build I might go OOM quicker when healing but I don't think its anything some pots couldn't help, either way I need to test it out but on paper it seems sound. I'd love additional input as well.
---
Super boring take on this. Pretty lazy. You'll be half 50-60 blues the second you hit 60 and do a few BRD Arena runs. 
---
Ban'thok Sash, Cyclopean Band, Bloodclot Band, **Savage Gladiator Chain**, etc. on everyone half an hour/hour after hitting 60. I'm sure some people need that stuff that early..
---
They *actually* went with "it'll be too hard for the Pizza Dads &amp; Gamer Moms to understand" in the last paragraph. Disappointing, but now I'm on the wrong side of history so I'll hold this eternal L.
---
Oh man, this is awesome! Definitely gets a bookmark.
---
Yes but things like expose armor doesn‚Äôt stack with sunder as an example

As someone in the IT department, we dont necessarily block forum pages, managers noticed and requested us to block mostly game content pages. For example, we have had people abuse twitch on second and third shift, playing wow, overwatch, league of legends etc. Our firewall lets us block "Blizzard entertainment" which includes launcher, wow website, wow forums, overwatch, diablo literally anything of a blizzard entertainment product. We leave reddit open because not many use it... other than us for research on IT problems, news, and for BS... obviously ;)
---
But that isnt remotely needed to clear the content. All of it. 
---
You dont need a single piece of PVP gear to kill Rag, Ony, Nef, Kazzak, Azuregos, Hakkar, any of the green dragons, C'Thun, Kel'Thuzad, or Ossirian.
---
If you have no life and can commit to leveling, farming, raiding and pvp rank griding--then of course its another avenue for gear and opens up more raid drops to other raid members upping your groups' dps quicker.
---
But none of that is needed. If you want to be a fella  that aims to clear all raid content in the span of 4 hours go for it. But there is no "Meta" requirement to pvp.
---
PVE wise is bonereaver's edge even that strong? By this I mean on bosses specifically, we see lately that you stack as much armor reduction as possible (3995 in total iirc? Sunder 450x5, Curse of Recklessness 640, Faerie Fire 505 and Annihilator 200x6) for a total of 3995, there is an image floating around supposedly from vanilla with Maexxnas armor (Naxx Spider boss, checkable with Beast Lore since it's a beast.
---
link here - http://www.kurai.com/wow/naxx/maexxna.jpg
---
there was also a thread about kel'thuzad only having 3000 armor with a screenshot showing the evidence, I won't claim armor as a gospel, but with these debuffs bonereaver on bosses will do nothing kinda, but it will still be bis for trash
---
https://i.redd.it/c6yaz4b0z5l21.png KT image
---
Faerie Fire should stack with other armor reducing this, only thing I can find is a changelog from patch 0.9 (https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_0.9) saying "Faerie Fire will now stack with other armor-reducing debuffs."
---
Curse of Recklessness stacking I also think was retail like, but if annihilator works or not, thats just 1 stack of Bonereaver's you would require to put bosses at 0. Anyone has further information about what armor debuffs stacks or not?
---
&gt; full clear the first week of release
---
Unlikely you'll have enough 60s in the first week. 2nd week yes, but not the first.
---
Joana set the World Record during real vanilla something like 4.5 days /played. Assuming new routes have been made/polished up, lets assume the 100% fastest is 4 days played. Most people aren't going to hit that, lets assume the "average" hardcore pusher is doing 60 in 5.5 days played. That gets us 132 hours needed. play for 18 hours and sleep for 6 gets us 7.3 days IRL to hit 60. Or if sleeping for 8 and playing 16 gets us 8.25 days in real time
---
Even if you could manage 4 days, that is 96 Hours, using the 18 hours/played a day you get to 60 IRL after 5.33 days. Or if playing 16 hours/day youll get to 60 exactly in 6 days. That leaves 1 day to clear MC at best. In 1 day, fresh 60s with 1.12 talents and 1.12 itemized gear are unlikely to clear MC. 
---
Some people in your guild might be able to manage those fast numbers, but all? Doubtful.
---
I stand by statements I have made in the past, week 2 of Classic release and Rag will be dead, but I find the idea of a week 1 downing to be VERY VERY unlikely due to the time in real life it will take to lvl to 60.
---
I hope so, it is much harder to rank up before BGs, you really need to have a team just roaming high level zones killing everyone. I doubt many people will make it to even rank 7 before BGs come out, only those dedicated. The big TM/SS pvp fights are actually not the best since you often get random dishonour kills when you join the raid which tanks your rank.
---
Guldan armed Brotherhood

on EU Frostmourne.
---
We are one of the first horde guilds which  cleared BWL.
---
I'm not sure on the interaction between blessing of kings and divine strength so I'm going to just assume it is an additive +25% strength.
---
Improves Blessing of Might grants an additional 37 attack power at rank 7 (185 -&gt; 222). Paladins get 2 attack power per point of strength. If you got more than 19 strength from BoK+Divine Strength, you would come out ahead. BoK does that by itself at 190 strength. With Divine Strength added on you will break 19 strength at 148.
---
This is just back of the napkin match so I may be off slightly but this should be in the ballpark.
---
I would never tell people analysis time stamp if I was milking watch time.
---
no one is saying that's not the case. What they're saying is if a guild has a choice between 30 perfectly maxed characters and 40 capable characters they're gonna choose the capable characters first. 
---
There's a saying in football "availability is the most important trait". Basically saying it doesn't matter how good you are if you're not showing up. If you have the best warrior on server but he's always AFK or just not showing up when he says he will then he's not as worthwhile for your guild than having a NE warrior who has a non-optimal spec but he's there every night and constantly putting effort into the raid.
---
And we are going to have all the time in the world for Classic, unlike Vanilla, because even if TBC would happen they would still keep Vanilla servers out there and hybrids would clear Naxx eventually. So, whats wrong?
---
Using spirit on a tier 2 helm as an example, is used to intentionally downplay the argument of the other side. The real issue is not the spirit on tier 2 they are talking about, but the spell damage and spell hit on Ban'thok sash that they are not talking about.
---
Further more. It doesn't make any sense to content gate items and not have progressive itemization. They even say so in the blue post.
---
'' When new items are added to loot tables, you‚Äôre generally seeing a deliberate effort to provide catch-up gear and/or to provide new goals for players who had exhausted an existing reward structure. For example, in original WoW, items were added to give players a way to quickly prepare for Ahn‚ÄôQiraj without having to spend months in Molten Core and Blackwing Lair. ''
---
This is the argument to not have items added later in the game, not be in the game launch. But somehow, the argument does not apply to items which were significantly altered later in the game. Ban'Thok sash received a whooping 12 spell damage and +1% spell hit, ON A SINGLE ITEM. It's a massive buff, one which repeated 3-6 times on 40 characters will have a substantial effect on the difficulty.
---
'' The changing of existing items in patches often illustrated the original design team responding to how players played the game. Their primary goal at the time was to make rewards more relevant and exciting. Developers realizing that Spirit probably wasn‚Äôt an ideal stat for a warrior raid set helm\* was an example of this sort of change.''
---
Once again, they are citing spirit. As if the items altered in patch 1.10 were simply altered from having ''useless'' spirit, to having other useful stats. When in reality, some of the more overpowered items were quite useful even in their original state. Ban'thok sash had 10 stamina and 12 intelligence, yet no spirit. Mind you the belt can be equipped at level 49, at which level, most casters would see a legitimate use for this particular item.
---
They continue to cite ''spirit'' as the big bad stat which no one wanted. But don't even acknowledge that other items received a buff in the form of substantial increase in strength, agility, intelligence, stamina, crit, hit, spell crit, spell hit and defense.
---
This means prot paladins are viable.
---
Whoever says that it doesn‚Äôt matter whether expansions are released as long as it‚Äôs done in different servers must not have gone through the launch of the original expansions as this is not seeing the complete picture.
---
When TBC launched I had no intentions of upgrading. I only did so because in just 2 weeks, there were no more people to raid with and no more BGs. Understand that every time there is a expansion, the population suffers greatly from it. Its the difference between waiting 7-10 minutes in queue for a very balanced BG, and 1-2+ hours to play with 50% of the same players you see every time. 
---
The world became deserted. There were few people in the major cities. People had moved on. 
---
With this in mind, can anybody argue as to how and why things would turn out different this time?
---
but but but muh authentic 20 people queue for that specific item spawn
---
I think it would be kinda cool to have a giant Zerg of level 2‚Äôs for at least an hour but I totally see where you‚Äôre coming from.
---
Huh, I did not know Joana could and did copywrite a leveling guide.
---
Maybe, but progressive itemization was never going to be the difference between "Hard-mode" Classic and "EZ Mode" Classic.
---
Yeah I've always known sunder and expose didnt. Suppose I just thought none of them did as a result of that interaction.  Guess we'll just have to see how it plays out.
---
That said, I can look at that list and see opportunities where less than 16 of those debuffs would be up. Interesting none the less, I havent seen a comprehensive list of best raid debuffs often.
---
The only fight I see itemization being an issue for is Rag. But even then, that will be hard in early phases and without zg world buff.
---
There's gonna be a ton of funny stories this time around of people not being invited to lvl 30 dungeons because they aren't an optimal spec
---
lol.. it's gonna be funny
---
&gt; You really think they‚Äôre going to bring back classic wow?
---
They had the data and the assets.  That's not a full development cycle.
---
If you increase the difficulty threshold, hybrids may not even have a possibility of clearing naxx. That's the problem. You are breaking the game for some people to make it slightly more enjoyable for others. Destroying 100 people's experience to make 1000 people say well I enjoyed it an 8 instead of a 7. Is a bad fucking mentality. And why retail is dying today
---
Or go to Darnassus on any other
---
We pretty much know there will be at least some sharding. But we have no details on the extent.
---
I mean you can't really just skip over the post if you're making a youtube video about it though since not everyone has seen the actual post.
---
Ahhhh okay I got it. It would be super silly to have those late-vanilla items when we're trying to kill Ragnoras. Raiding is already gonna be a breeze without all the power creep.
---
You are very welcome to link a credible source that says it now uses the 8.1.5 engine then!
---
In WoW, all classes and specs can kill mobs and complete world objectives (including leveling) solo.  You may not kill and complete things quite as quickly as other classes, but it‚Äôs 110% doable.
---
Compare this to games like EQ1 where certain classes could absolutely not solo whatsoever and things are quite easy comparatively in WoW.
---
His comment is in reference to the fact Blizzard announced two hours ago that there is no progressive itemization, but there is progressive loot tables. i.e. items that were only added in a certain patch will be added at that phase, but all items will be in their 1.12 state.
---
They need a job
---
Why dont you go nuke your own city again in attempt to get rid of some pests, and then fail... and make them stronger... and give a terrible disease to your own race...Oh wait.
---
Oh for sure. Shame they took it down but sadly it won't see much use anymore considering this blue post.
---
so, we're getting the most nerfed version of every boss, with the most buffed version of every item and talent
---
Thanks alot for your input, let's say my warrior quits, will this be viable enough to solo?
---
I love the thought of having the hunter set in early phases
---
BIS even after Naxx - https://classicdb.ch/?item=16571

Every week at a random time in a random location, the Lament of Mankrik event begins. His wailing cries of sorrow echo across Azeroth. The free peoples of Azeroth find an enraged, psychotic Mankrik laying waste to the lands under the thrall of the old god C'thun, who has infiltrated Mankrik's broken mind and is using him The Alliance seek to end his life and end the assault of the land. The Horde, sympathetic to the lament of one of their own, seek to subdue Mankrik and free him from C'Thun's grasp.
---
Server Stability as well, is it gonna be like retail servers where a 40man raid creates a 2-3 second lag in between actions?
---
nice!!!
---
I've been playing this almost since launch and for some reason I'm still terrible at navigating it. this will help me a lot
---
Former hardcore raider during OG vanilla (server first kills) to semi-hardcore raider on private server vanilla,
---
I can't tell you how much I loathed wiping on easy content because a few retards can't pull their own weight.
---
Good luck killing C'thun, you will need it.
---
As much as I loved some of the cool, laid back guys in that semi-hardcore raid group, I also love not wasting my time wiping on raids that were on farm mode and/or not completing raids for the night and missing out on gear drops for the week.
---
Hardcore or bust for me only when classic launches.
---
The wow version of having someone put a shoe on their head.
---
No you want to wand at the end to give time for your mana regen to kick in.
---
Well yes, but no.
---
90% sure that you'll just attack without a weapon in your offhand and still suffer the miss chance of dual wielding.
---
What?? Rip...
---
You're right that +10 defense is similar to two levels, but that doesn't make it better than the alternatives. Each point of defense is giving you:
---
+0.04% parry
---
+0.04% dodge
---
+0.04% block
---
and -0.04% chance to be hit (which also reduces your chance to be crit by 0.04%)
---
This is effectively 1.2% avoidance and a 0.4% shield block chance. This is not a good bang for your buck, 5 talent points.
---
You can keep your revenge lit up with the shield block ability, and this will also keep you fully immune to critical strikes and crushing blows for as long as the shield block buff is up (assuming typical tanking gear). Putting the points in toughness is generally considered to be better for mitigation. But putting the points in defiance will go a long way towards keeping you from losing aggro, which accomplishes your #1 goal as a tank of keeping mobs from attacking your party.
---
I will repeat my recommendation of full dps or full tank spec for leveling, depending on how many people you usually play with.
---
MC was cleared first try on Nostalrius with 39 people in dungeons blues and greens after less than 2 weeks.
---
I can't speak for pally/druid/shaman specs but as a priest you can level up as shadow and still do fine healing a 5man group as long as you're not the min level char for that dungeon. Even then you could probably do it with a decent tank. 
---
Will you cake walk/rush through the dungeons, probably not. But 5mans are so desperate for healers they'll usually be fine working with a priest that's not specced for it and taking it slow or hoping for a higher level tank to help compensate.
---
No, retail is dying today exactly because of mentality where
---
&gt; Destroying 100 people's experience to make 1000 people say well I enjoyed it an 8 instead of a 7. 
---
is a bad thing, because they are trying to cater to everyone, as a result, making the game mediocre boredom. Every class can contribute to raids, everyone is welcome. Specs that are underperforming are garbage anyway regards to their gameplay style, rotations, enormous mana issues, etc. People would play it not because they enjoy it but because they want to be special. And it's their choice to harm themselves. No class decision is wrong, but you must know your capabilities and play around them. And yes, I am not rolling a warrior or a warlock, I am going to roll a druid on a classic.
---
The people that hit 60 around the same time as you will be a lot more fun to play with, generally speaking
---
There's also gonna be a ton of guilds for casual players who can only raid once a week
---
well if you dont min max debuff slots for piss easy raids SWP might get pushed off by serpent sting or whatever anyway except for 20mans
---
I've always been there.
---
And it DOES NOT MATTER.
---
Those people will quit anyway. They don't care about classic. They just want to do it to say they did. And then they're done.
---
OR they'll hop between them depending on their mood.
---
That's gonna happen no matter what. Wether expansion servers come or not.
---
You WILL end up dead servers regardless because that's just the nature of the beast.
---
The servers will restructure, and if nessecary Blizzard can combine them to keep a healthy population once the initial tourism surge of the new expansions levels out. And they have a better idea of what the classic scene is looking like.
---
Weather effects!!!
---
There are still idiots like this, seriously?
---
I see what you‚Äôre saying, but I think you‚Äôre missing the OPs point. 
---
When Classic launches, all severs will be LIVE, and every capital city will be empty until someone runs there first. 
---
During maintenance people will still park their chars in the city, not leaving a moment of server time where no one is physically there.
---
Most of the stronger post-rework items are just regular blues like any other item, having regular drop rates. There's no reason to believe that they're gonna redo all of the loot tables to make them more rare than they were at the end of 1.12.
---
Lok'tar, friend!
---
Like others said, Windfury. It's a constant buff you will have on horde that gives your autos a 20% chance to do an extra auto(with a bit more damage). This increases your rage generation (as you gain rage from white hits), and using hamstring as a rage dump makes you proc windfury as abilities count as autos.
---
My faith in their dedication to this project increases just about every time they give an update. This is clearly a labor of love for the team and it seems it will pay off in spades.
---
The way I typed it maybe makes it sound that way, of course there's other factors but as someone who played on both(the classic version being released a couple months prior), people complained like crazy over the system and how broken it was.
---
I will be going on a server with all my friends (around 10-15 people) and first level to 60. If we find a nice guild on the way to it cool if not we will form one.
---
Searching one before picking a server could lead to the guild brake up and you being on a bad balance server or a more hardcore server when looking for a casual one.
---
I think picking a server first then the guild is the better way.
---
Female Dwarves have the best block, dodge, and parry animations so you should go with that imo
---
cramming irl responsibilities (vacation, major work projects &amp; summer class) into early summer pray to the g0dz
---
I believe I have several items and letters from vanilla sitting in my main bank. I'm about to go pay subscription and check I think. Could have some crazy stuff in there.
---
The content was faceroll status regardless of itemization, lol. MC was cleared on Nost by 39 people in questing greens. On their first try.
---
I remember farming for my first mount, I believe the mount itself was 850g at the time. From 400ish gold to the full 850 took about three weeks farming elemental air on my server.   
---
If it's worth anything I did it twice more to Chinese gold farmers in TBC.
---
and end with three
---
tbf that was probably because BC was right around the corner and the vast majority of people couldn‚Äôt do naxx.
---
i bet blizz is gonna announce BC servers when naxx comes out just for the servers to be deserted again, full circle lol.
---
Non-progressive itemization confirmed by Blizzard:
---
Week 1 Savage Gladiator Chain in BRD 1.12 version.
---
Week 2 Bonereaver's Edge in MC 1.12 version.
---
Warriors will now rip everyone a new asshole both in PvE raid dps and PvP wreckage.
---
Good news for meme specs since one warrior with BRE is basically 2-3 raid spots worth of dps, so more flexibility!
---
My parents and I got into a huge fight because they didn‚Äôt want to subscribe with their credit card to a game they just payed for. 
---
Later that night after all the hysteria my friend that was trying to get me to play said ‚Äúoh yeah, there is a free trial, and then you can buy gamecards from GameStop with cash‚Äù
---
Thanks, Kyle, that would have been helpful BEFORE I started fighting with my parents.
---
I will if Bloodthrist heal increases with healing gear, havent tried it out yet.
---
Ah ok cheers üëç
---
Yeah wtf that's a, what, 22 inch screen? I only got a screen like that in late TBC maybe? Early WotLK?
---
Yeah I agree, server first. I'll more than likely character create on several servers to name save. Then watch population to decide where I'll commit.
---
Yeah. All groups will be min maxing. You can't make group with your own rules or find one that aligns with your goals. There will be no casual players playing Classic.
---
All dps specs are fine for lvling. So far I've seen people being picky only when there's serious lack of cc in the group.
---
Server tech is also a big unknown. Right now Blizzard shuts down groups that are too big in retail. Classic depends on server tech that can hold at least two 40 man raids in the same area.
---
Soooooo release date?
---
Looking for a guild that plans to raid 1 day a week preferably starting at 8:00PM EST.  Planning on rolling a Druid.  Willing to roll Horde or Alliance.  Hoping there‚Äôs at least one out there!
---
BRD is way more important to farm now
---
Agreed, this is a huge problem that they don't seem to be addressing. While conceptually I like the of not mucking up item stats over time, many of the reitemizations may as well have been entirely different items, the fact they share a name is incidental.
---
A coherent blue post that has acknowledged that they have heard feedback from the players, reasoning, and in-game examples backing up why decisions are being made... This is the dream.
---
fortunately, i got to avoid all that shit for WoW because my mom was used to the subscription model thanks to Ragnarok Online.
---
unfortunately, my mom had to spend her hard earned money on a subscription for god damn Ragnarok Online. bless that poor woman.
---
Sub count peaked in WOTLK. It flattening out later in the xpac only implies a correlation at best, certainly not causation. I agree that time gating sucks and that LFD was a terrible change, along with many others implemented in WOTLK, but WOTLK still had the peak sub count. The game was growing and until ICC there was basically no stalling. 
---
Plus it's a little asinine to imply the entire population even knew what timegating was or that it caused people to leave in droves. WoW was on an upswing, the bubble had to burst at some point. To point directly to timegating is a bit egregious.
---
Setting foot in Orgrimarr is one of my most vivid memories from launch.  I don‚Äôt think I was the first, but it was effectively deserted.  I remember walking in, exploring the town for what seemed like forever, seeing the auction house, bank, Thrall, RFC... it was all so new and exciting.  I‚Äôm looking forward to again seeing a sparse Org and watching it grow up into a hub of peacocking no-lifers, gold beggars and mailbox dancers again!
---
Aww dont say that they could let activision fuck the game up and then it'll be empty again.
---
My dream is to not prepare at all. Just roll a warrior, start leveling. Find some friends in a 5 man dungeon. Make a guild together or join their start-up guild. Be the main tank, help the guild reach success, and eventually contest the top in our realm.
---
I feel like if I were to go on Discord and try to organise stuff with people way before, it would feel too professional. I want to hit it off with like-minded people.
---
Basically "I'm mad because I'm ignorant"
---
Im going to say have fun spamming one button all of vanilla
---
They were added later on for people who weren't really into raiding and mostly ran dungeons as their primary end-game content, as something to work toward but would not supplant raid gear.
---
If you‚Äôre interested-got for it!!! $15 is really minimal and you‚Äôll know pretty quick if you like it
---
Mor'Ladim killed me more times than Stitches ever did haha, but there's so many grindy Raven Hill quests..
---
This is a huge non-homerun. /u/Zonquist posted a list of items that were in since the very beginning whose reitemization values was a massive buff that contributes to the nurfing of early game content. Conceptually this may be a clean solution, but in reality we're walking into MC as the top-end content far more powerful than we should be.
---
Blizzard isn't designing a game. They're re-creating a game. They can't control if the community thinks it is garbage or not.
---
&gt;I‚Äôm a human being in real life, so I can relate to that shit on a sexual level
---
I'm worried that that's why some people picked undead.
---
What he means that it's weird reasoning. With subscription you can literally only pay for a month of gametime whenever you want to play so you aren't tied to 2 months like you are with gamecards. So ironically subbing is better with your own reasoning than gamecards.
---
I like it! If you need any help with webdesign Pm me would love to help
---
39 people and a Ret Pally is almost as good as 39 people.
---
Yep that's why their whole "the 1.12 database is sacrosanct" stance is so disappointing. I get wanting fixed 1.12 mechanics and itemization stats, okay sure. But if you're gonna do that, buff the raid content to compensate.
---
Not all, just enough to be a recurring story to laugh at, leave the sarcastic strawman over there üëâ
---
you best thank yo momma, she made your future happen on 56k
---
sitting to stack reckoning isn't blizzlike and most likely won't be a thing in classic
---
Love this! I have the same plan but I'll have a healer with me.
---
What the actual fuck did I just read ? are they trynig to justificate their laziness of not releasing original item states because some bosses were bugged early on and they changed the items as catch up for instances that won't be out in Classic ? 
---
NO recreating bugs and items IS NOT THE SAME
---
This is total non sense, just say you are lazy Blizz.
---
Blizzard isn't trying to cater to everyone, they are trying to line their pockets on a dying game. The decisions leading up to that were trying to cater to a select group of people and ignoring the rest.
---
I said the same thing with math showing week 1 60s are hard enough, but 40 guildies doing it and managing to down Rag in leveling gear is not possible. A few days in week 2? 100% it hink that is possible. But not enough the first batch of 60s have at least 2 days to gather gear from dungeons
---
fuck yeah, and my guilds would raid at night when my parents were asleep so it was either wake them up and piss them off = no game time, or steal their credit card.
---
before you ask, no, i did not steal their credit card. i had at least enough dignity as a tween to not do that. i guess i just wasn‚Äôt hardcore enough.
---
Also the xrealm BG question
---
Eh, I don't mind the super consumables being an option. If you want to put in the time and effort and spend all the money to make that happen, more power to you.
---
'Course, I also think organized PvP should never be smaller than 10v10 in WSG, where the effect of said powerful consumables won't be nearly as significant as it was in arena 2v2 or 3v3 matches.
---
That said, I completely agree with your second bit. The old PvP ranking system was objectively terrible by any reasonable metric. It all but explicitly incentivized unhealthy and unethical behavior. It was garbage when it first went live in '04 and it'll still be garbage when it goes live again later this year.
---
That and the woefully unfinished class/spec design of Vanilla are the primary reasons I've never been fully on board with the no changes crowd. TBC got a lot wrong (or at least sowed the seeds for getting stuff wrong in the future), but it absolutely nailed those elements. I also liked the separation between PvE and PvP gear, though I seem to be in the minority on that one. Maybe it was 'cause I mained a druid through the expansion, so I was used to maintaining several different gear sets already.
---
Better written guide, by me:  
---
Macro Judgement and Seal into one macro (Judge ***then*** Seal), so when you Judge it will instantly re-apply your seal.  
---
You're welcome.
---
You‚Äôre probably right - I quit during the 4.0 pre-patch, maybe a few weeks before release. The most fun I had was running BG‚Äôs and shatter-combo kill anything. (I was getting 10-12k frostbolt and 8-10k Icelance combos - basically unsurvivable). At that point, my raiding experience was over. I‚Äôd already gotten all the gear I could from H25 ICC, except maybe a trinket or something I think, I‚Äôm not sure anymore.
---
I did try MoP for a month or two, but that was just the worst - maybe I combined those memories somehow.
---
But I seem to remember doing cross-realm raids during WoTLK, but maybe I got it wrong? Dunno. All I know is that the response I got for helping others went from ‚Äúoh, thanks!‚Äù to ‚Äúwho carried you, scrub?‚Äù
---
&gt;Find the cheapest route
---
I'm not 100% sure, but don't the flight costs vary, based on faction reputation?
---
This looks like a Google Maps for WoW.
---
I really like that it estimates the time to travel.
---
Great work! It's awesome to see amazing tools like this.
---
The key with BRE and Badge of the Swarmguard on pservers at least is that they can push armor values into the negative for the player using the items.
---
Yeah, I was stoned and bored. Such is life.
---
Didn't expect the post to blow up like it did. Either way posted the link to the channel.
---
Rip Google videos. My friend lost a lot of epic PvP videos from his warlock.

I would say progressive itemezation is the same as talents/spells, as they mention the post. Maybe paladins  t2 set was ret and would be cool to test, but then again, you wouldn't have the talents/spells that was aviable at the same time as the "ret t2".  Whatever route you go you will have a frankenpatch or going 100% proggessive through out and that wont be good either. 
---
Devs seem to know what they are doing and have good things in mind. It will prob be cool to see the change up in "meta" from psservers with items such as Blackblade of Shahram beeing viable.
---
one of my friends from HS works full time at wal mart. he used to and still does shop lift from wal mart regularly, so can confirm.
---
Gquit and have fun in world pvp? Then retire early off the coast of Tanaris?
---
Thanks for the clarification.  Defiance being in the third tier though- so you have to at least do 3/5 toughness and 2/5 imp bloodrage just to get there.  But thanks for the specifics I thought the 5 points would have a much greater effect than 1.2% avoidance.  Seems like I overestimated the effects of defense for sure as this was a big reason I thought going prot would help me whilst finishing the leveling grind on countless mobs. 
---
Thanks again for your time and input
---
No sound in the gif.
---
Reddit and social media typically are not blocked for the fact that it's the most common way people communicate when a catstrophic emergency happens and cell towers are overloaded or blacked out. 
---
If you're involved in a mass shooting event, typically there's a blackout for comms due to over saturation or intent to prevent further coordination by attackers. The interwebs though are open and many companies intentionally leave these open for that reason...and their lawyers said to.
---
The kicker is that you can heal all the way to 60 just fine with the normal shadow spec. But by all means play whatever spec you want, sounds good :)
---
They are trying to line their pockets on a dying game by making the game accessible for as much of the players as possible, who used to play wow and can't let it go.
---
Stitches terrorized me a few times the first time I leveled through there. I went back later on, after I was 50+ and kicked his butt.
---
they are utilizing the modern back end. I havent experienced what you describe since actual vanilla and bc.
---
Most definitely! You have the option of killing 1 thing at a time(ret holy) or rounding up a few baddies(prot holy)
---
Not an issue for me o don‚Äôt care about how fast or slow people progress just that they enjoy their time playing.
---
I haven't played pserver, so all I have is old vanilla haze, but it seems similar to what my priest did. I dont think I ever went deep shadow, even at 40 to get shadow form. Which is probably where a lot of leveling builds split. In the demo pretty sure I went imp wand and the spirit regen ones asap. They seem the most critical.
---
I think most people will tell you that you can go deep shadow and still heal dungeons until some of the later ones approaching 60. Still, I always felt better having some of the heal boost skills fir healing dungeons even if it meant slower solo killing.
---
they are actually very popular, like one of the top played alliance classes on pservers. cant find a guild as a hpala because everyone is already full on palas lol. they just seem unpopular because they are alliance only.
---
4Head
---
Oh, I had an absolute blast with TBC when it was live. All the problems I listed above were only realized with the benefit of hindsight.
---
Except the blood elves. I hated them from day one. Gorram "pretty," no-tusks-having pointy ears.
---
A few months after naxx the game dies off, sorry to say.
---
They are making sure the lights in westfall are the correct color. I have faith they will have weather effects.
---
Mc was tuned to be beaten without any epic or bis
---
So there is that
---
True. Also the hybrid experience is good while lvling. Healing, tanking or dps in dungeons. Managing your mana, saving future freinds with a fast heal. The hybrid experience is my favourite. Not a waste at all.
---
Another possible feature I could think of: put two buttons "Navigate to" and "Navigate from here" in the speech bubble that appears when you click on a flight point. So instead of typing it it, you can just click on where you want to go and say "Navigate to" and it puts that in the textbox.
---
But again, still a great tool! Thank you for making it.

Anyone can do this in a few days, nothing hard we now have full data base of all the changes private servers did all the work
---
It's very unlikely, but that's the plan. We've gone through the details.
---
Reddit is blocked at my place of work... So I have to use my data :(
---
When they initially addressed sharding, they mentioned it will be present at launch. Now, how long "launch" is defined by them (is it 1 week, a month?). Given the community's uproar about sharding, I'm more than certain this team in particular will keep their vows and it'll be temporary.
---
I was not being serious lol
---
yup, and with 8 debuff slots and 1.1 items
---
Just go shadow
---
They're referring to 1.12 AV there
---
Awesome. I‚Äôm relieved to hear that. Thanks.
---
Mythic content is not accessible, mythic 10+ is not accessible, pvp high ranking is not accessible. Random lfr epics are. But that's like saying dungeon blues make end game gearing accessible for everyone. Remove dungeons or you are catering to casuals. It's a stupid argument...
---
Cross-realm raids were also implemented with 4.3, just a bit later.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/4270420/coming-in-patch-4-3-2-cross-realm-raids
---
It's probably you remembering things from MoP. It definitely was meh or even shit, especially for the first raid tier. Dungeons were a no-brainer as well. If the asian theme didn't matter to you the raiding from 5.2 onwards was really enjoyable. It didn't matter to me - but I also didn't really start raiding until the end of Siege of Orgrimmar.
---
Yeah pretty surprising. Kinda reminds me of the OSRS community which has a rather sizable amount of failures and trash people. Then again OSRS is basically designed in a way that playing it hardcore consumes your life. Vanilla isn't that different in that sense.
---
Yeah buddy, gotta spend 8 minutes reading the post word for word. Ad revenue time.
---
But seriously all of the Classic WoW videos based of off blue posts are hyper inflated in length and it makes it uninteresting to watch any of them.
---
What is this? A crossover episode?
---
They could, but that goes against their philosophy for recreating the game as it was.  IMO they won't touch mob values.
---
unless you are in a ‚Äúcutting edge‚Äù classic guild (lol @ classic competitive raiding/‚Äúworld firsts‚Äù btw) then play what you want and your skill will determine how far you go. one of my friends wanted to play druid and was suddenly like ‚Äòok well i‚Äôm playing priest now i guess‚Äô, when i asked why she told me one of her autistic loser friends she met on some tbc/wotlk server way back when basically sperged out at her like ‚ÄúYOU CANT BE A RESTO DRUID THEIR HOTS DONT SCALE WITH SPELL POWER! THEY SUCK PRIESTS ARE THE ONLY GOOD HEALERS! AND DWARF IS ONLY VIABLE PRIEST RACE!‚Äù
---
don‚Äôt be like this guy.
---
Or fear, and wotf is reliable.
---
They are letting everyone clear raids, kill the last boss on the same patch with other people no matter how bad you are. While allowing people to tryhard for pseudo rewards.
---
This was a little after vanilla when we had guild banks. My friend myself and my cousin were Ina guild and me and my cousin were doing well and majority of the people liked us but my friend however they didn't like so much. They would force him to respec every raid and he started getting tired of paying for it so he asked the guild if they could pay for it. This didnt go over to well with the guild and later after the raid the guild leader pulled me aside and told me he was going to kick my friend from the guild because many players had issues with him. So being a good friend that I was I took everything I could out of the guild bank and filled each slot with cupcakes to cover up the guild bank logs so they couldn't tell what I've taken. And than I /gquit.
---
yes so basically everything beside AQ and Naxx will be 200% easier than it used to
---
The standard of evidence that you subject the arguments of others seems far greater than the one you subject yourself to. It reeks of confirmation bias. Its fine to play NE, but from a min-max perspective there are better choices.
---
maybe now we can get a movement going to retract the mistake of getting them to do 1.12 in batches.  
---
or do y'all really seriously want to be timegated by easy raids for 2 years
---
BRE is going to be insane on release
---
theyve back tracked and refined a lot of their statements, so I doubt we have heard the last from them re: sharding. 
---
They can have thought experiments related to how it will play out, but they can't know until they collect data from Alpha and Beta (and the alpha doesnt seem as though it has enough people involved to stress test the sharding features). As such, If there is a beta, I dont imagine we will have the details on launch day/week plans until closer to launch.
---
Sorry, but I wasted way too many hours over the past few weeks arguing about Druids as viable raid tanks only to be insulted and have my posts downvoted by people who kept quoting misinformation from Tipsout even though I kept conclusively proving people wrong with multiple sources.
---
Not going to bother going through that again when this subreddit some seem to care about learning anything.
---
I can‚Äôt wait to bail on Light‚Äôs Hope once my guild downs KT. I need a break!
---
Dude, this is a good idea. Like I really like it. I hope somebody does it
---
That's true, but as it is they are already mostly inferior to prebis blues and greens that people will be able to collect before the quests for T0.5 are even added.
---
I wish you all the luck, I would rather be wrong than right.
---
I had the same thoughts while thinking about debuff limit of 8 and 16.
---
Does he look.. like a Lich?!
---
You're right they should ban every streamer and YouTube video that shows any boss content because a casual may godforbid get to see end game content.
---
Many of our questions remaining is the final touches before everything's done, like server lists. Based on their quiet approach with the release date, I assume from past experiences the developer team won't announce a release date until they're 100% certain it's done and ready.   
---
This project is a very unique and difficult task. Since there's no developer team that has ever committed themselves to such an approach to such a particular problem like modernizing code for vanilla, they're most likely in doubt of the exact time for the project to become "done".
---
Oof
---
WoW *was* the safe when it released.
---
Why you gotta twist that knife?
---
Definitely get Imp Wand early
---
Your managers sound lame.
---
I‚Äôm still worried that if I decide to play ret pally I‚Äôll just have a bad vanilla experience.
---
I'm looking for a griefer guild that raids for pvp gear.
---
how so ? not doing progressive itemization is the opposite of loving the game
---
Oh ok. I can sorta see why, but I also don‚Äôt have any idea what sort of impact that will have, either. Guess I‚Äôm just hoping it‚Äôll be pretty minimal!
---
To be fair, Blizz did get a few things right with TBC. As noted, they more or less nailed class/spec design in the expansion, and finally doing away with the old PvP ranking system was *long* overdue. I also liked the separation of PvE and PvP gear, though I seem to be in the minority on that one.
---
&gt;Part of playing WoW is seeing your character progress through items. Becoming stronger and stronger every week by getting new upgrades here and there. The thrill of the hunt, so to speak.
---
100%  It doesn't feel good in a MMO to obtain a piece of gear early on that sits on your character for over a year.  This will be the case for some of these 1.10 stat updated items.
---
There is so much to explore not shure if i raid again. maybe some raid with hard discipline can attrack me. but i dont need stress
---
Sounds like they included that because people still haven't gotten the message that they're using 1.12 for everything.  So all the people crying for older versions of AV or older versions of certain mechanics can now shut up.
---
If guild banks are added, I will literally fuck my dad.
---
Ah, thanks for the clarification!
---
Oh, you're right about defiance being third tier. I wasn't looking at the calculator when I said that, so yeah 3 in toughness is reasonable here. 
---
Overrating +def is pretty common for people learning the role, I think. I know I was guilty of it as well for some time. Prot is definitely not the way to go to improve your solo grinding ability. 
---
20 points in fury does help out quite a bit though. Especially on a private server where you can sit mid-combat to keep enrage uptime at 100% and proc blood craze at the same time. Depending on the mob, you usually gain more health from blood craze than you lose from taking the critical strike damage bonus.
---
they're only thought was to not do any work
---
If anything that makes it more worth your time!
---
Sounds good to me. I always hated that Atiesh was not usable in TBC when it was porting you to the damn raid.
---
On official (since Vanilla): If they do not return to their corpse, their body stays there until they log out. If you notice a fresh player corpse disappear without leaving a skeleton then they logged out. If you see a skeleton form, they just resurrected either by running back to their corpse or taking a spirit res.
---
Source: been ganking/camping people since vanilla (and this is still how it works in live).
---
Any behavior other than that on private servers is a bug/not correct with how it should be.
---
I don't know how to tell you this, but I was 14 when wow launched. My mom let me skip school and I went to my buddy Dom's house three houses down and played on a shit tier laptop while sitting on his couch with my mouse pad on the arm of sad couch while he played on his desktop. 
---
So somehow your dumbass cousins anectodal story supercedes mine? Christ, you aren't very bright
---
Except... 90% of the people who cleared MC in Vanilla didn't have 1.12 talents. And 1.12 talents are huuuuge DPS/HPS buffs. So if they don't acknowledge how easy they'll be making MC and BWL due to 1.12 talents they'll also be violating their own philosophy. Catch-22 there.
---
You got me hah!
---
Our trinket cleanses fear I thought?
---
That's cool. There weren't very many oceanic servers. So you're story doesn't count
---
Which thread?
---
It wasn't an attack. If you feel like it is an attack then maybe you feel guilty about your behavior.
---
You mean NO itemization in wow ......durrr
---
Here here!
---
I fully intend to raid and see all of the content in classic. My regular WoW raiding guild has no interest in joining me in classic, and that's okay with me. Why? Because there is a safety dance in Naxxramas.
---
Ah we can dance if we want to, we can leave retail guilds behind
---
Cause my guild don't dance and if they don't dance
---
Well they're no friends of mine
---
Lol it was a thread about how to tag people. Like 3-4 years ago. People kept tagging you over the span of a year before it got archived.
---
Play worse for "the experience" because it... builds character or something.
---
So you think its fine that posters like Reyzerokek just lists a bunch of weapons, tell people they are best in slot and just leave it at that? People should be smart enough not to give advice when they are fully aware they never bothered to look closely at the spec they are giving advice for.
---
Maybe you mean the old version of LFR? The one where you typed /lfr and it brought up a page of people looking for a raid that you could build a team out of. The cata version is more like the dungeon finder that auto matches you with other people.
---
Should make a 10+ minute video explaining why these hack frauds are making these videos tbh
---
But "1.12, except this mechanic from 1.10 that completely broke rogues and got hotfixed the second people found out about it. Rogue main here btw."
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs what i was wondering. Ret Pally‚Äôs will have divine strength either way. Unless you go Spellibution Pally. Was just thinking if it was worth dipping 11 into Prot.
---
Fort is the most widely loved buff.
---
I borrowed 300g from a friend I made at around level 35 for my epic mount once we both reached 60. We agreed that I buy mine first and then farm his gold back.... I never farmed his gold back, I felt guilty since he kept whispering me about it so I put him on ignore and never spoken to him since.
---
Yup!
---
marginal. the legitimate biggest worry is certain items from MC, particularly Bonereaver's Edge will be noticeably more powerful than competing items. 
---
Some of the reitemized blues are pretty useful too. But its the retuned raid items that are actually worrying.
---
If you are a non raider on a server with a lot of pvp oriented hardcore raiders, it wont be ideal (but unless you have crystal clear memories of real vanilla in 2005, it wont be ideal...compared to what exactly?). But if you keep pace with the upper geared folks--you may not even notice. 
---
One of the cool things about vanilla is how slowly gear scales and how exlcusive the best gear is. So in 2005/6 unless you went looking for it, you wouldnt often run up against a full T2/2.5/3 brick shithouse. But in this paradigm, a few particularly good items from relatively accessible content will be available the entire time.
---
No, it hasn't. We still have no idea how long they're going to use it or in exactly what zones, or what kind of precautions they have taken to make sure it won't be needed in heavily populated zones in the future.
---
I wonder if the classicast guys are going to be relevant when the game actually comes out and people are busy playing
---
1-30 is roughly 1/3rd
---
31-50 is the next 1/3rd
---
and 50-60 is the next 1/3rd
---
its just a rough estimate, theres propably someone who did the proper math :P
---
Blanket silence. It‚Äôs not like mages, shamans felhunters counter spell/interrupt that locks down a tree.
---
noone complained tho
---
There was a site named something like warcraftcensus or wowrealmscensus. Perhaps that's the one? Old vanilla data on servers.
---
I think u/MisterPotat answered my comment and it is a good answer to you as well.
---
Google
---
Exactly. The spirit and agility in warrior items was a shit example and a straw man imo.
---
Toys really added to wPvP and BGs in MoP and WoD. 
---
On my rogue I remember using the following: Salyin Battle Banner (drop combat restealth), Shard of Archstone (untargetable), Pandaren Fishing Charm (buff protection), Eternal Warrior's Sigil (and its WoD equivalent, simply insane with Stoneform/Subterfuge/1 minute CD Vanish), toys that give you slow fall, underwater breathing or swim speed, toys that let you fly, toys that summon a targetable npc/object you can shadowstep to, toys to dismount, toys that give you farsight, toys that let you do funny things to your opponent's corpse. On top of engineering and other profession stuffs. 
---
Ai-Li's Skymirror allowed you to keep any form and do crazy stuffs, for example use Gnomish Poultryizer on a CC'd humanoid to turn it in chicken, use Shadow Dance and glyphed Pickpocket to take the chicken form, then Skymirror to keep the form for 10 minutes even if you deal/take damage, then use items to make your character smaller and now you're a tiny tiny chicken one shotting people with Death from Above. Use Reflecting Prism and you can turn your whole BG team into chickens or whatever weird form you find, pretty fun.
---
Imo MoP PvP was amazing and WoD PvP is seriously underrated (more bursty but just as fun imo). The PvP gearing system was better for casuals who could eventually get the best possible set by just spamming random BGs and Ashran. By removing this system in Legion Blizzard just made them stop queuing.
---
It will be super easy for the most part as you have a healing spell for every situation.
---
Ya! Some one had an amazing post the other week and it was extremely detailed with each lvl an the percentage of 60 it was etc. Also the time per level was similar showing each time spent per level.
---
Isn't SotC barely used though? It is all about SoC and SoR I thought. 
---
Taking Spiritual Focus over DI I understand for PvP. If you are worried about going OOM, I would go with Benediction than Improved BoM. We already won't be the top DPS, and it will be more important that we can heal than squeeze out that extra damage.
---
My RL has told me that he much prefers Sanctity Aura over Improved Ret Aura, but improved Ret Aura would be useful in dungeons.
---
To be fair though, until Classic launches it‚Äôs hard to use Nostralius as a hard benchmark, we just don‚Äôt have any idea how accurate that was compared to the real classic data and tuning.
---
So, I know this is such a noob question, but what I took away from this is they are making stats a bit more relevant on gear to the class? I never played vanilla, only started at the end of TBC. This sounds good, and is making me think I will play classic!
---
I‚Äôm saying everybody that played vanilla knows there were queues at launch time, ESPECIALLY on populated servers
---
Indeed. Come to think of it, I think it's all a big misunderstanding. Most of the players who are in favor of this doesn't actually know how many items it affects and how much it will affect them negatively.
---
People only care about playing classic right now. What I think people are forgetting to ask themselves is what the motivating factor would be to keep playing after the nostalgia fix has been obtained? Clearing raids are only fun the first few times for nostalgia purposes. After that you either quit or you keep playing to improve your character by getting new gear. Right now, your only option will be to quit or to keep playing without getting any upgrades for a year.
---
Furies generally favour dual-wield over 2-handers though. I'm only thinking about PvP where it is a monster weapon in the hands of an MS warrior.
---
And lots if sand.
---
The whole point is that MC is a joke to competitive tier players either way. It really doesn't make a significant difference.
---
You can argue a lot of the same reasons for the modern guild bank system. A ton of progression guilds were account sharing the account with the guild bank pre-2.3, an informal survey on our private realm forums had every single guild with kills in BWL+ doing it. A couple even had a dedicated account for it and I don't know of any that ever got banned for account sharing. You can't really do that on modern Battle.net anymore, you'll get autosuspended and potentially banned by modern technology, plus you're handing access to all of your Blizzard games instead of "just" a boring WoW account.
---
I think implementing 2.3+ guild banks deserves at least being considered because that's returning closer to the way things actually were, rather than the way they were originally designed. This is a lot like the argument for loot trading; they're not gonna increase their GM staffing levels for real-life cost reasons so it's that or losing loot to misclicks, which isn't a thing that actually happened in vanilla. I think a similar argument could apply to implementing APIs for Decursive/PallyPower and a few other things, but it has to be done with great care.
---
That said I think it's better if it launches without guild banks. Wait to see what the community thinks of it. Won't really need it until ZG, won't become important until Naxx.
---
We can finally play the game.
---
Yeah this is a normal system used by some classleaders to make it easier to hand out and divide loot equally, in a way that everyone gets something they want.
---
Ya I don‚Äôt remember if it was a link or just a straight Reddit copy and past... I just remember finding it on here because I‚Äôm addicted to looking at this Reddit ü§£
---
I never played a lock, I wouldn't know. Same for rogues though, but I suppose I'm more likely to be screamed, and a lock more likely to be stunned.
---
My favorite thing to do in classic wow was on my Night Elf priest(barf, yeah I know). This was back when your shadowmeld wouldn't break until your spellcast finished. 
---
So, I'd hang out on the elevators at Freewind Post where the guards couldn't get to me. Then I'd sit there, stealthed, waiting for unsuspecting hordies. They'd walk up to the platform and I'd mind control them off the cliff. One poor bastard even got stuck in midair when my MC broke due to being out of range with the moving elevator. His hearth must have been down because he just "stood" there in midair, spinning around looking confused. 
---
;)
---
It's not laziness; it's sanity.  Having worthless stats on your gear sucked in vanilla and it would've sucked here too.
---
at this ponit why don't you play BFA
---
#goodchange
---
It's not classic if they add random content.
---
Edna Mode knew what she was talking about.
---
My Wine-Stained Cloak will last forever, thankyouverymuch.
---
Lol I fell for this so many times.
---
Seconding this, wondering if any adjustments need to be made due 1.12 itemisation.
---
That sounds a little more like it!
---
The game (in this example the DM) doesn't tell you that. You have to know that through some meta knowledge about the game's development.
---
Please don't compare feral to ret
---
tbf to him, he is saying stuff that makes sense based on what most people played on live. The SoR/spell damage build is newer stuff that got figured out on private servers.
---
It will be more fun than a mage as you have more spells to play with. Only downside is it‚Äôs more stressful if you are a dedicated main tank healer. 
---
Until you get decent gear or if you are pushing content every fight will be a count down until you run out of mana if you can‚Äôt keep up with the damage the tank is taking.
---
Another downside is that farming is more tedious and you will probably roll an alt to do this for you.
---
It's just like other modern games, thanks Blizz for the changes!
---
I wasn't saying to make them more rare. I was more so asking if their drop chances would be low. I'm sorry I came off like I knew what I was talking about but I really don't lol
---
1) Insanely smoother leveling than a warrior. Priest is top 4, behind hunter and somewhere in the same realm as druid and warlock in terms of ease. Warrior, by comparison, is on the complete other end and one of the most arduous and slow levelers. 
---
2) High demand in PUGs, and far more casual that tanking. Tank spots are usually pretty sparse in pugs, because guilds almost always have their own tanks; just due to how progression raiding works. Healers, on the other hand, are rarer than DPS but need to be taken enough that they'll usually have a few slots.
---
3) You actually use your tier pieces, and they look great. Not necessarily a comparison to warriors, which often have pretty awesome looking pieces, but a lot of other classes (warlocks stuck in bloodvine sets) either don't get to use their sets or have to use really crappy looking gear (IMO).
---
4) Much easier to make money. Even holy priests can lasher farm and solo mara pretty easily, while prot warriors basically need to find an alternate way of making money (e.g. fishing or AH trading).
---
Funny to see the things people find a reason to complain about.  
---
What no spirit on my DPS warrior gear?  This will not stand!
---
Oh god, getting flashbacks of fighting over raid zones and bosses in EQ.
---
It'll most likely end up being a few pieces changing that slightly out-edge the previous best-in-slot. The old lists will still be full of good items and ultimately there will be lists with the updated "new" good items before the game launches.
---
Paladins will definitely still be in some weird mix of cloth/mail/leather/the odd piece of int plate, I wouldn't worry. This update should still keep us in our Vanilla clownsuits we know and love
---
Thinking they were going to continually update item stats with patches was a pretty ridiculous stance in the first place.  It‚Äôs 1.12 or bust.
---
Which one do you think brings more utility/dps?
---
We used to have over night LAN parties during BC.  My buddy had a pretty geared Paladin and went to bed before everyone else while still logges in.  To play a prank I put all of his gear in the bank so his character was naked and then ran him into the ocean to die of fatigue.  So he logged in to a dead/naked characted in the middle of the ocean thinking he had been hacked lol, i kinda feel bad but it was funny.
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about getting ad revenue‚Äù - The explanation in a sentence that probably takes less than 6 seconds to say.
---
In a raid you will get to watch many health bars. While tanks and dps only watch two. Their own and the bosses.
---
Seeing it on youtube and personally being there in-game as your own character are two different things.
---
You've got multiple people here telling you they experienced queues longer than what you quote as being the "highest" and don't see how that invalidates what you said? Idk if you should be worrying about how bright anyone else is lmao.
---
Because the game was like that ? Why do you want to change it ?
---
Btw it is more about the balance, 1.12 items were made for AQ catch up, not MC/BWL.
---
Yeah definitely. Soda is more of a variety streamer nowadays until classic comes out. I was more so using Asmongold as an example of a type of person who will continue to play WoW as I am sure there are others like him?
---
Oh, would that be when you couldn't rez in an enemy zone graveyard?
---
I'm sure that was a thing from doing Stockades as Horde you'd rez fucking miles away because that was your GY, you couldn't see the ally spirit healer.
---
Was that a thing?
---
To me that sentence is specifically about gameplay mechanics (i.e., 1.12 AV) and not necessarily underlying server mechanics, which is how I would classify cross-realm BGs. Maybe they'll end up in the game but parsing their wording when they're talking about a completely different issue is not a confirmation of anything.
---
My bet is they launch without cross-realm BGs but keep it in their back pocket if they have any issues with faction balance and queue times.
---
Not when the game is basically a cut scene anyways

So, here's my thought. No one complains that Final Fantasy XIV has no content. The reason? 16 levelable jobs, 8 (I think) crafting professions, and 3 gathering professions. It would take years to do every quest in the game, not including leveling these. Then you have dailies and rep grinds. None of this includes the social aspect of the game (which, by comparison to WoW even today seems a little underwhelming.)
---
My point is, this is why we don't worry. These things were the bread and butter of vanilla. Leveling one character takes an eternity. Professions are vital. Reps have a reason to go for. This is what at least part of the player base lives for. Considering most answers here are the love for pvp, I didn't even touch that OR pve content. Vanilla WoW was a living, breathing world to us, with economy, community, and a way to escape. We were the hero, but we weren't crazy OP. If you enjoy the game, you'll always find content.
---
No but the chineese will
---
First off, what everyone said about not having to level in healing specialization. But also:
---
Your weapon makes the biggest difference for priest, shaman, paladin. 
---
Much of priest leveling strategy is using +25% wand damage talent and making sure you get the elite wands at appropriate level. Kargoz has a video in priest leveling which lists these wands.
---
Shaman don't necessarily need the 2h mace/axe talent in enhancement because much of the high damage weapons while leveling are going to be a staff, and mostly will be quest rewards.
---
Druids you don't even need a good weapon, they do good damage in their forms while leveling and you save up your mana for healing or casting spells on the pull.
---
Sticky.
---
Dude I mean I have to like walk back to my corpse when I die.
---
wat
---
I like how minmaxers are getting shit on due to Blizzard's incompetence. People don't dislike Rets or Ferals or Shadow because they just hate things that *you* like, they don't like those specs because Blizzard never gave them the power or attention they deserved. I wanted to play boomkin for so long and eventually got to, but despite "doing what I want", I was unhappy because guess what? They REALLY suffer from mana issues that are irreparable. Being oom and unable to even attack the boss is not fun, viable or not. Keep in mind the specs are bad, not the mindsets.
---
Dude it's not even Summer yet, relax. It will release when it releases, stop basing your life on a video game.
---
First come first serve, no way they'll do anything different. If someone steals your name, better come up with a new one.
---
Where would you draw the line? Do people get to reserve all their toons that nabbed a bunch of cliche popular names back in O.G. classic, even if they weren't famous youtubers? And if it is just youtubers, don't they already get enough preferential treatment from their fan base that blizz shouldn't be catering to them?
---
That was spot on. I love how MadSeason manages to be totally content with Classic/Modern WoW even with all the drama and elitism that follows it. He's really a great content creator. I can watch his shit for hours.
---
Kings is a great buff for anyone that isnt a melee dps, and for agi classes it adds crit in addition to attack power. If you're planning on solo retting for your while life you don't need it, or if you will be in a guild with a few other pallies who can pick it up. Otherwise it is still nice.
---
Entry level yes, doesn't mean we should stomp through it in the first week. The good guilds will clear it no matter what, but it would be nice if we the casuals got a fair challenge.
---
Sad to see this... hopefully it's just a funny reaction and the site will be back up. It is still a very useful tool for historical searches.
---
It's not just about the difficulty, it's about the incentives. Even when MC is a joke, people will run the zone because the gear is upgrades, which allows them to grow their players. But when the gear is outdone by BoE blues, nobody wants to go near the content.
---
I‚Äôve used this system. It really takes the best of loot council and dkp. It puts the power back into the hands of the players to determine what items you want to get and how important they are to you. These guys know what they are doing and I‚Äôd highly recommend it over any other loot distribution method.
---
This is sick, but finding my own way is more fun I won't use it
---
I guess. I just dont like when people "heard" something was good somewhere, and just keep perpetuating that information without checking if its actually true or not.
---
This guys humor is too try hard, why you all hate tipsout anyways?
---
I think most people that do casual raiding won't even make it to Naxx.
---
What? No way, keep the communication coming! This sub had a post when we went a week without an update.
---
My friend stole them from target &amp; Walmart by cutting the boxes sticker seal with razer blades and sold them at school for $10 each :/
---
Mankirk's wife is the endgame.
---
Seems like you need to redo some stuff here after the itemization update :P carapace spine won't be available until phase 5, so swap that to blackcrow i think
---
We‚Äôll just have to disagree on this. My point is they are giving all these things consideration and then explaining their process around the decisions.
---
Oh yeah... those brick shithouses... I vaguely remember joining AV after having just broken the 3k hp mark (buffed). I couldn‚Äôt wait to run around, virtually unkillable, right!?
---
...got instantly nuked by an enh shaman. Literally ate through 3k hp in maybe 5/6 seconds.
---
Supposedly the warrior set is really good. Warlock/mage is pretty good too especially since T1 and T2 is pretty garbage. 
---
But it's not that easy to get even the full blue set. And the epic set is definitely beyond most people. 
---
4 hours raiding every week is nothing compared to the 6+ hours *a day* that you have to PvP to get the purple set.
---
Ahh. Still happens all the time.
---
Agree. It's a very good site for just historical documentation if nothing else.
---
"Loot List" is a normal system used by some classleaders to make it easier to hand out and divide loot equally, in a way that everyone gets something they want. most use with LC thou.  
---
However this seems to be an odd/bad take on it, some of these i dont see being good.   
---
But normally they way lists are done is:  Say both you and me play warrior. we both list.  
---
1. Onslaught  
---
2. Vis'kag the Bloodletter  
---
3. Onyxia Tooth Pendant  
---
4. Striker's Mark  
---
5. Quick Strike Ring  
---
Attendance and Preformace will always be a main factor for gearing, you want to gear people dedicated, thats where the guild progress is. But say im 100% attendance and always full consumes. i will get my 1. item before you. And you might get your 3rd, depending on how you preform. After i have gotten my 1. next item i get wont be 2nd, it might be my 4th or 5th "wanted item". Then its all roted until everyone has gotten something on their list they want, based on how they are preforming in raids. That way you please everyone.
---
You are naive, they're just doing that to not spend any time working on the items
---
One of my guilds in TBC used the system. I don't remember any problems, but we were pretty casual and a lot of guys knew each other so we didn't have much drama about anything.
---
With how much information we have now nearly everyone knows which piece means the biggest dps/healing/survivabilty increae so if everyone orders their items to maxmimize that then every classes order is pretty much the same within their spec. But, if the guild is more lax and you really want that cool staff even though pants would be 2 dps better for you, you can list the staff first and get priority. 
---
It's a fine system, but I've never been one to care much about gear so I'm sure others don't like it as much I guess.
---
Give her the Slagtree's Tools treatment, where she can spawn in one of a half dozen different locations, and once someone discovers her she disappears and respawns five minutes later at a random location chosen from that list. Kapp
---
I think maybe you should get at least a week to pick a server where you get to reserve one name, from a verified account, of course.
---
Poor tips, I actually like the guy
---
I believe classic.wowhead says when the thing was added as a patch number but lots of stuff are missing source of item for example. WIP I guess.
---
I agree with you, but I don't know if there's enough support for that sort of movement
---
Yup, its going to be an avalanche instead of fall slowly turning into winter.
---
Thanks for the reply, I'm glad to hear that it seems to work out for people. Have you ever had any problems with it? Or was it pretty much exclusively better across the board?
---
AQ too, if you count the original "unbeatable" c'thun
---
You kind of eliminated your own counter point, so I don't know where you're going
---
Yeah in later editions of wow, healers became the big thing to Nuke and FF. But in vanilla there were specs that could global folks, killing them first was even more important than killing healers. 
---
Who know how itll play out in 2019 with all the added game knowledge.
---
RP - PvP Servers at launch!!
---
Damned if they do, damned if they don't, some people will never be happy ...
---
Yeah. My advice would be to only spec healing if you are 57+ and completely out of quests. Then do every dungeon specific quest while getting your prebis.
---
Even then I would probably prefer to stay DPS and just grind to 60 myself.
---
You get to look at all the pretty colorful moving health bars instead of looking at boring drab things like core hounds and lava giants.
---
isnt that just a pvp server with even more weebs and furries than a normal wow server?
---
&gt; there was a dumb rule that I could never be a higher level than my oldest brother because he was paying for the subscription. .
---
üòÇ
---
Don‚Äôt forget every server had their legends, too. How frustrating would it be to land on a server, see a name from vanilla, and think OMG it‚Äôs THE Silverstorm!!!
---
But no, it‚Äôs just some random dude who saw it on a video once and thought it was a cool name...
---
That‚Äôs one way to look at it I guess...
---
All I know, is I can‚Äôt wait!
---
I agree with you, but this really only effects PvP servers....
---
Phase 2 is nothing on a PvE server except DM and two world bosses.  PvE players are going to want Phase 3 as quickly as possible since it‚Äôs a new raid.
---
Such a great movie.
---
Characters will be about 50% stronger  from items than they used to so it will make the early content a lot easier.
---
Maybe you can land yourself in a guild of like minded players but otherwise you're about 15 years too late for a challenge my dude
---
&gt;In Vanilla you rez at the closest spirit healer you died to
---
Well, as of now, there's no update regarding sharding besides the original statements, therefore we should just assume this will be their final statement. 
---
They did update their original statement. However, it was just a clarification.
---
Agreed.  Flying mounts killed world PvP.
---
Non sense
---
What makes you think those items will drop from BRD? They already confirmed some loot wont drop initially.
---
Except /who Darnasses still says 0 people
---
Nice! Classic it will be for me!
---
yeah its chaotic here. very military like, so I just show up and do what i'm told and leave lol
---
My mom would't let me play "violent" video games on Sunday. She considered WoW violent because of the name... I spent many Sunday's browsing WoW forums and theory crafting.
---
The fuck is wrong with pizza
---
Nope, your ghost spawns at it, you can run to any spirit healer you like. You are 100% wrong
---
Breathe.
---
Feral, of course
---
thanks for the quick reply :)
---
they're easy to find because they aren't hiding
---
Spirit actually is very good for Warriors in classic, especially during leveling. Raiding probably not so much, but if you stack spirit on a warrior in classic it's like having multiple Renews on you when out of combat. It's actually insane when trying to minimize downtime between pulls. So I could definitely see someone wanting it.
---
SOON, brother, soon. Here's hoping the May 5th Tool album release date theory comes true.
---
Not very frustrating at all.
---
Good luck brother, will be really impressive if you guys pull it off.
---
There are tangible benefits to the community with both decisions. Whether they are doing it to lighten their own load or not is irrelevant to those benefits existing. I said before that we disagree, and this is what we disagree about. 
---
In other words, I actually like this decision over the alternative.
---
If you need a guide, you ain't gettin scarab lord.
---
It's word for word his guide in most parts. The pictures with the annotation are made by the guy. The OP even credits Joanna. You can use the guide and reprint it. Joanna gives it for free. You just can't reproduce it as your own and sell it for money.
---
Unlocking Scarab Lord title belongs to post Naxx discussions way down the road.
---
they are probably trying to filter and fix the database
---
Bet you are a fun guy to hang around with...
---
Dear god this post is going to get downvoted into oblivion.
---
Oh, I didn't mean it like that. They're just normal items. It can be annoying to grind for the single boss drop that matters to you (and any other casters in your party), but if some boss drops 10 items, those are gonna be closer to 1/10 than any rare special 1% drop or anything. Run the dungeon 10 times and you'll probably see it drop. While running 10 dungeons took a while in vanilla and you'll have a lot of competition on those items, you don't really have to be a no-lifer for it.
---
Renew is probably overkill unless you're low on health, which shouldn't really happen unless you over pull the previous pull
---
I wish to alleviate your fears that yes, the Robes of the Exalted... aka the pretty teal dress will be your wardrobe of choice for some time into raiding!
---
It would be more akin to a player having read the adventure path and being like *"lololol I know things I shouldn't, I'm keeping this axe!"*
---
I was ready to ban the hell out of someone for posting Endgame spoilers, but instead, I'm just like "u asked wut m8?"
---
This is always the most interesting period of unreleased game subreddits. The months leading up to release are just full of exasperated hype boyes who are exhausting themselves into restlessness and what-if hysteria. However, this is a first. Upset because you need a multi-billion dollar gaming Juggernaut to inform your vacation time. 
---
It's a glorified retro video game that they don't even need to revisit, but they are at significant resource cost to themselves. Maybe we let them work.
---
Make her undead, and let her stand by her man üôÉ
---
&gt; posting exactly what we already know
---
We dont know shit, all we're doing is guessing, making assumptions and hoping.
---
And while a lot of them are very solid guesses, they're still not facts until blizzard confirms it. Which what these blue posts are. Confirmations.
---
Remember, it isn't just 1.10 items that are being held back until phase 5. There are also all the items added to MC in patch 1.4/1.5 that will be held back until phase 2/3, as well as other items added in different patches that will be added in other phases. 1.10 is just the patch that added the most items, but not the only one.
---
Blizzard almost admits c'thun was impossible
---
I'm just adding on to your point. :) that it's not simply because the Alliance have more manpower.
---
Yeah maybe. AQ and Naxx are still pretty hard for team private server though.
---
I mean, an addition blessing on every class, additional 3/4 cleanse, additional aura group wide, plus spot healing, bop, divine shield. Lohan, like feral is fine but if you are power shifting and innovating yourself for more power shifting you destroy your utility.  3%melee crit and a bres isn't terrible but they aren't way above ret/prot pallies
---
Nah Darnassus will still be a ghost town for most of vanilla.
---
Any spec is going to do fine if you have a 5/0/5 base, it really comes down to personal preference. The feedback I would give to your holy spec is that you might want to consider dropping imp sw:p since the idea is that you are going to rely more on shorter kill times with holy fire -&gt; mb/smite spam and drinking a bit more. Also pick up holy nova. 
---
Mind blast and sw:p are really good to use especially with high wand dps, since you have to consider the fact that if you are casting spells you are not wanding. sw:p has 0 dps penalty because you can start wanding immediately, mind blast is your highest dps spell after that. But with a holy spec you really need to spend more time casting smites or it doesn't really make any sense to spec for it.
---
Wands definitely kick in before 40. In fact, when you get your wand at level 15 (or earlier with enchanting), wanding will probaly outdps your smite, and this will stay true for a large portion of the early levels. Also you can weave auto attacks inbetween your wand shots for even higher dps.
---
I do think until level 52 or so, both holy and shadow (starting from a 5/0/5 base) are competitive, it basically just comes down to wand/mh dps, personal preference (like do you want to have mind flay/silence for pvp, or more heals, or armor/mana from disc). Personally I'm not a fan of going deep holy after divine fury/holy nova, I think the power spike after that takes too long to reach.
---
sry for wall of text
---
Heart of the wild is mainly about enabling bear form and healing, your cat dps is going to be terrible in pve and pvp because you‚Äôre missing 3 very important dps talents, lotp, IOC, and nw. 21/30 pally on the other hand has nearly all the important ret talents, with a decent set of gear you‚Äôll definitely kill things ok in pvp and even 5mans/farming.
---
Personally I ended up on a really low pop server. It was mostly dead, so much so that my guild had to merge with another guild to keep raids alive. I have no intention of going back to the same server, mostly because that server probably won't even exist. We're not even sure the same server names will be used.
---
The advanced version of this in TBC, was opening a portal, and asking people to help click it to summon a mage table.
---
SGC drops in BRD on day one but originally had +20 defense on it and different stats. It was essentially an experimental shaman tanking piece that only tanks ended up picking up.
---
With 1.12 itemization, it still drops but has +2 crit, tri stats making it BiS for warriors for a loooooooooong time.
---
Basically, warriors are going to get even more retardedly OP for phase 1 and 2.
---
Tips will make a video about how this will completely ruin classic wow! I can feel it
---
If you want it a bit harder find a like-minded group and make it harder yourselves by equipping lesser gear to compensate. There seems to be a ton of people who want Blizzard to tune or make entry raids harder when players are perfectly capable of making raids harder on their own.
---
I have a feeling they will have to focus hard on their streamer communities if they want to stay relevant. Events and stuff. When the game launches they will have WAY more competition.
---
I can buy soem extras for starcraft 2 or diablo 3 so yea money isn't given just like that.
---
A bit of a word play featuring Therapist the PvP Shaman and Frozen the frosty PvE mage :)
---
Well on my current private server i got the reputation for being friendly af, free pots for everyone in the raid core and ill help out anyone who i know needs gold, but if you get on my bad side my gnome rogue will become your worst enemy. Ir if you are also ally ill hope on my not so alive gnome rogue that happens to look like an undead rogue.
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
I'm so glad this was confirmed. It would have been kind of stupid to change stats on items along the way, and would remove a lot of the enjoyment from looting gear for me personally.
---
Server pop cap
---
I will play on a PVE server as Horde, and there are like 1-2 guilds advertising for that, which I do not like.
---
So no, I am not joining a guild until I get to 60 and farm my preBIS.
---
I think people are forgetting about broken items that were also nerfed (like Spirit of Aquamentas). So progressive itemization would give us these broken items back that would arguably have a bigger impact on raiding than 1.12 version of items.
---
Don't you guys have phones?
---
Isn't that water the Well of Eternity?
---
I don't think anyone's going to hold their breath.
---
&gt; instead of throwing tantrums and creating drama
---
Strangely, one of my fondest memories was when my wife (then gf) and I joined a high drama guild of people that were about 10 years older than us, and hearing the grown-man guildmaster lose it and rage out on vent/teamspeak/whatever when someone made a mistake in a raid.  Every wipe, while frustrating gameplay-wise, was worth it because of what would inevitably follow.  We actually stayed a while in that guild just to watch the train wreck that it was.
---
If you have a BRE horde side, you will use it for the majority classic as your main PVE DPS weapon.
---
People have been looking up information outside of the game since literally beta, functionally there's no difference between the two.
---
"Anyone who disagrees with my opinion is ignorant and wrong!" generally isn't going to be well received.
---
 Back in Vanilla I was a high-performing immature diva. (Trolling, loot tantrums, you name it I probably did and said it.) There was a guild master who took me under his wing and was super cool bc although in numbers I crushed it no one wanted to group with me bc of reputation. Things got better and I grew up. I‚Äôve since mellowed in old age. Now I hope for a reputation for reliability and maybe I can pass his good work forward. That GM and a few other dudes I raided with in Vanilla and BC still all keep in touch.
---
avoid literally all social media and forums dedicated to classic wow then, because theyre full of misinformation and people whom are fanatically dedicated to their beliefs about a 15 year old game, to the point of hysteria when confronted with any conflicting info.
---
Case and point: any thread where someone posts the Spelladin build. People *hate* ret paladins in vanilla and no matter what you say or the evidence you produce, they will flip through their deck of insults and excuses and nothing you ever say will get through to them.
---
Cannot logic people out of a position that they arrived at through illogical means.
---
Raiding in vanilla is entirely casual up until you encounter:
---
1. Trash before twin emps in AQ40
---
2. Trash before Ouro/C'thun
---
3. C'thun
---
It's just a matter of how many times do you want to wipe on Nefarian before killing him that week and what guild you join will decide that outcome.
---
Casual guilds will not clear AQ40 in most cases after they realize you can't herd cats and expect to clear the very latter end of AQ40. It's a severe retard check. Most encounters are very forgiving up until the top three listed and then of course, Naxxramas.
---
API will likely be mostly the same as it is for modern WoW due to it being based on the same stuff.
---

No, but it'll be the same fucking thing, except that instead of the official token exchange, you'll be buying your gold from gold sellers.
---
&gt;Yeah buddy, gotta spend 8 minutes reading the post word for word. Ad revenue time.
---
I‚Äôve never understood complaining about this, it‚Äôs his job to create revenue from videos. Can‚Äôt imagine someone coming in to my work and complaining ‚ÄúYour just selling stuff to make revenue‚Äù.
---
Private servers dont do armor into the negatives either. People using BRE normaly dont use Badge with it, and vice versa.
---
Really cool!  Nice work!
---
But only to you. Mine is the most important to me, and so on and so forth.
---
Yeah I wouldn't do both renew and shield. My typical rotation as priest is shield, holy fire, smite/mind blast depending what's more efficient at that level, swp, wand to death.
---
I don't weave AAs as I keep hearing that is not blizzlike behavior and I don't want to practice a habit that is potentially going away come classic.
---
I mean they used that example just to get kids like you who don't know better to defend them.
---
It's not just about spirit on warrior gear there are so many blue items that are bis for a very long time because of this.
---
It makes the content easier (yes it's already easy why make it worse) &amp; it makes R14 pvp gear even more insane. 
---
It changes the game completely and it's sad that people like you would rather agree with a well written blue post with a cherry picked item for all the "dont know betters" to defend.
---
I hope people like you do more research when it comes to things that are important irl instead of instantly agreeing with the first well written post you see about it but given the state of the world I'm guessing otherwise.
---
\&gt; when a bunch of drunk Russian neets implement progressive itemization better than Activision Blizzard.
---
Gameplay-wise, TBC, though it fairly well murdered the lore and came with a whole host of other changes that eventually twisted the game into what it is today.
---
Lore-wise, WotLK, though it continued nurturing the seeds planted by TBC.
---
My personal hope is Classic adopts the OSRS approach and goes its own way. Take inspiration from the good parts of what came after (class/spec design, removing DHKs and axing the garbage PvP ranking system from PvP; all the delicious lore from Wrath) while leaving the chaff (basically everything else).
---
This. Also, can we get a 10+ minute video on how to make our bodies perform cell division? I need sage advice from the trusty legion of private server youtube god kings.

Actually thank you for the in depth response.  This is the kind of stuff I need. I agree some of the holy mid teir stuff is kinda filler but will make dungeons pretty face roll.  I have healed as Shadow and while possible if you have undergeared teammates (which we will for the first month or so) healing is much more challenging and involves a lot of drinking .
---
So I am not getting the math behind rushing IMP wands.  Even if I get level 13 enchanter wand I am going to out level the level 5 one before anyone can make one I am pretty sure.
---
It has 11 dps which is really good and if it exists I am going to get it but 5 talents for a 25% increase nets you a whopping 2.5 dps.... that isn't nearly as efficient as the 2 extra ticks to SWP for only 2 talents or the +spell crit of holy spec.  NOW later on I completely agree this scales beautiful with some of the 30+ wands but rushing it early actually seems like a net loss to me IMO. I am currently messing around on a PServer in prep so I can run some tests.  
---
I have leveled a couple priests over the years one alliance and one horde so I am well versed in abusing the 5 second rule for regeneration. So I am not planning on spamming spells to kill things.
---
The rotation I have in mind is (Shield) Holy fire -&gt; Smite -&gt; SWP -&gt; Wand till dead  rinse and repeat.  I think people are so used to the Shadow meta they forget how hard Holy fire hits and that it also gets insane scaling with any spell damage.
---
Why did they change it to begin with?   Because itemization on the tier 1/0 sets made no sense and were anti-climactic to receive, so they fixed it.  
---
Do you want caster gear that has no +spell dmg and does nothing to increase your dps, too?
---
&gt;If their stance doesn't change in regards to this, I predict that classic will lose at least 30% of their players by the time BWL has been out for a few weeks.
---
Are you seriously suggesting that 30% of the Classic player base will be affected by itemization progression issues going into BWL? I would be shocked if 30% of the player base even hits level 60.
---
And thus replant all the same seeds that eventually led to the game becoming what it is today.
---
Nah, brah. OSRS approach or bust.
---
&gt;So I am not getting the math behind rushing IMP wands.  Even if I get level 13 enchanter wand I am going to out level the level 5 one before anyone can make one I am pretty sure.

I miss being able to shadowmeld aimshot as a NE hunter
---
They literally just spent an entire long-winded post saying that items will release at the same time as in vanilla. How is this still confusing :p
---
We're not, but we're also voicing opinions on why we're not watching it.
---
If you don't like it, don't read it. Checkmate, son.

I actually have the MOST fun playing with noobs, in 5-man dungeon groups at least.  If you are in a group that runs like a well-oiled machine, nothing interesting happens and there are no "oh shit" moments to potentially come back from.
---
Mistakes (and recovering from them) make for interesting game-play, imo.
---
I was R12 on my shaman  (would have been 13 before the switch) and had a 8/8 bloodfang rogue before AQ40 came out. I can almost certainly guarantee I was far better than you at Vanilla and played FAR before 1.12. So please put your ill placed ego aside, because you couldn‚Äôt be any further from the truth. 
---
There was obviously some account sharing but everyone minimizing what a lot of good players did is ridiculous and immature as hell.
---
They changed it to catch up for newer raids(AQ/Naxx).
---
With the exception of wotlk and bc this is the most 2004 looking thing I‚Äôve seen I‚Äôm gonna cry.

At least some things will change, like i see him saying to get animated chain necklace from strat UD, but that won't be available on launch now.
---
They examples arent really the same as they require different levels of deeper knowledge.
---
- Knowing NR is valuable is easy because everyone knows AQ requires NR.
---
- Knowing [That random item] will have its stats changed in [that specific patch] requires alot of more previous knowledge and planning.
---
but how am I going to learn about blue posts? its hard enough sounding out these reddit comments to myself
---
Lesser and greater magic wand will be open af at levels 5 and 13 respectively.
---
He said on his stream he won't be making a video about it because he uploaded a vid a few days ago talking all about it.
---
Wow that‚Äôs a dick head move
---
could totally be it ya
---
A true RPer.
---
"it will be easy anyway" is not an excuse, that's the most stupid  thing I ever heard. This can be the difference between average guilds and complete noob guilds being able to clear the content
---
Yeah I definitely think we will see Raggy fall in week two, three at the latest. Could be wrong but I doubt it. The competition is huge, and a guild funnelling mats to a set of Crafters to make sure as many people as possible get some fr, pots etc, it's not too much of a stretch. I just hope the winning guild documents it in some fashion.
---
I both love and despise you.
---
They changed it before then, when they added the updated tier 1 models (around bwl).
---
I‚Äôve raided extensively under loot council and EPGP/DKP systems. I‚Äôve had good fortune in that I felt that the loot councils I‚Äôve been a part of were fair so most of the complaints I hear about greed don‚Äôt apply. In a best case scenario such as I‚Äôve experienced loot council works out. 
---
As for the other point systems they are fraught with issues and I‚Äôve never played in one that has been able to mature and handle classic wow loot distribution without running into major issues that always lead to drama or abandoning the system altogether. As well the overhead to manage these systems is a pain. I can talk further at length on loot systems as well..
---
As for loot list our guilds ‚Äúcore‚Äù stuck together for the entirety of a recent private servers life cycle. Our raid team was consistent which I believe helps strengthen the system as well. We found the system fair. Players liked being able to prioritize their biggest needs and plan out what pieces they preferred to upgrade. Classes and roles often worked together while creating the list to see what others were wanting and helped to spread out the loot in a manner that benefited everyone. It actually brought people closer together instead of point systems where it works in your favour to be predatory or in loot council where you are constantly worried about your perception among the leadership/council.
---
Our only issues arose with how to integrate new members / under geared members into the system part way through tiers and how to distribute loot with more of one class then another.. (we often had 8-10 warriors at all raids). Its unfair when a new guy can come in and scoop an onslaught girdle from your 5-8th warrior when they‚Äôve been farming MC for months. We never found a good solution to this and it would be worth asking any potential guild how they plan to address this issue.
---
I too play with my wood to pass the time
---
I have leveled as Shadow several times now and something different sounds interesting.
---
I have healed as shadow in Vanilla and I think people forget how hard it is to heal an under geared team as an under geared shadow. Most of the stuff i see people talking about assumes having ideal gear and the first two months are people in under leveled greens,  I still have flash backs it was like Nam. (I kid)
---
Yes that's true, I could add an option to add your rep too
---
Yeah I agree Week 2 is more likely. Week 3 at the latest.
---
On wowhead every item says "Added in patch 1.11.1.28211" I think.
---
Stitches was the original Fel Reaver
---
Not sure why people put so much weight behind the opinions of content creators.
---

Will Rhok'delar be available phase 1 or no?
---
Fuckin Tipsout
---
Well played sir.  One internet for you.
---
Savage Gladiator Chain
---
Ahh that's a really nice idea! I'll add that to my list :)
---
Don't forget that your wand dps isn't just the damage listed on the item itself much like any other weapon.
---
Wanding is typically 40-60% of my DPS while levelling - being half your damage, a 25% increase is pretty huge.
---
I'm duoboxing and this is my pick.
---
Mainly to avoid getting ganked, and doing all the ganking I want.
---
(Dramatically) faster queues at the cost of not knowing the reputations of everyone you're up against.
---
While it was a lot of fun to get to know the people on the other team over time, having 1 hour queue times gets old really fast.
---
Stop\~\~thats new horde. New horde is to fourth wave feminism as old horde is to first wave =)
---
I was not talking about this specifically, just that the items changes were for catch up overall
---
And yes T1/0 update was a catch up for BWL
---
This is accurate for both resto and feral. The demand is low but the supply is lower, and as a hardcore feral druid I even had people trying to poach me from my guild because putting that 1 feral in a 40man slot was something many guilds wanted to do but couldn't.
---
&gt; fan of knives, cloak of shadows,
---
Excuse me sir, we were speaking about vanilla WoW.
---
I'm all for it
---
üî•üî•üî•
---
I don't know if you have a preference on professions, but I think engineering is really hard not to take on a paladin. Having an extra way to get double damage on SoC judgments is very nice. 
---
Also, since you're leveling with a warrior, I'd probably recommend going Imp BoM over benediction, but it's not a big deal really. Outside of using Judgement of command off warrior charges, you really don't need to be using it on cd, and with low gear, BoM ends up being a pretty healthy chunk of AP.
---
$20 bucks says they kick off a new set of servers starting at vanilla all over again because as long as there is interest and people are willing to sub the cycle will continue till everyone quits.
---
Like 3 dudes will be have them
---
Really?  Go to a world boss join a raid doing it on Tuesday 40+ people = 2 second lag between spell casts.  For me things have never been this bad in retail, it is why I am super paranoid about how they will handle servers in classic.  During classic there was server instability in general due to technology being behind but now it's simply cost saving methods that are keeping us behind.
---
A man of culture I see.
---
If Ironfoe has a 10% proc chance (as some seem to speculate that it did back in the day), it's going to be absolutely insane. On par with BWL/AQ40 weapons.
---
I literally just learned that Kibler is Elendril like a week ago, hahaha. Blew my mind!
---
Yeah, bank alt makes a great disenchanter.
---
wasn't it added in patch 1.11? And classic will launch with 1.12 .. So that means that this necklace will be available on launch?
---
Slowly :D
---
/sit is really only used while levelling against mobs, that's what won't work on proper servers. In PvP /sit will work to build stacks in Classic, but it's a really dumb thing to do because you get crit constantly being attacked anyway, most classes have 20% or more crit and attack quickly and getting crit for 3k dmg in two globals by a warrior isn't super fun.
---
But it really could and in my opinion should be taken in that direction, a lot like what happened with OSRS. Though not any time soon, I think they should take their time with the phases and not rush it.
---
I'd love to be the guy who sends their high lvl toon to goldshire with a bag full of lesser magic wands and 2h green lvl 5 swords, just hand out the level 5 BiS to everybody.
---
One funny thing is how tired/unprepared these dudes look with the facecam on those videos. Just woke up? Doesn't matter. Gotta be the first one to post it since people won't care about a day old news narration.
---
What are some examples of the buffed items?
---
- Items that had their stats changed during the course of vanilla will have their final 1.12.1 stats from the get-go.
---
- Items that was added during a later patch will likewise also be added in the phase that reflect that patch in the time schedule.
---
According to the table someone posted below, it's closer to:
---
1-34 is ‚Öì
---
35-49 is ‚Öì
---
And 50-60 is the last ‚Öì
---
Your rough estimate is pretty close.
---
I‚Äôve said this in a dozen different threads. My guild cleared Mc and BWL with 4/5 Druid‚Äôs which PS players apparently think is awful. The game isn‚Äôt that hard and there is room for being ‚Äúsuboptimal‚Äù
---
Very informative video, enjoyed it and made me excited and worried about how hybrid classes will fare with itemization late game.
---
W0rd
---
Oh shit that dank af
---
/cry
---
Moist Cornbread
---
Could you make a 10+ min video explaining why we should do that?
---
I don't see why they never or don't make world PvP practical and relevant besides the kills themselves. I get the game is heavy on pve but you're talking to someone who thought EQ was trash and DoAC was badass
---
Paladin T2 will have the stats that it had in patch 1.12.1. As will ALL other gear.
---
no, i think you've misunderstood, read the blizz post again. Items that were added in patches after launch will not be added in classic until their respective phases. items added in 1.10 will be added in phase 5, items added in patch 1.4 will be added in phase 2, etc. It's the items that were there from the beginning in vanilla, but had their stats changed, that will have their 1.12 stats from launch.
---
explain.
---
So if I want to know what item I'll have will be by the time all the phases come out, I should \*have\* to look it up? That's not my idea of fun. I also wouldn't want to play a DnD campaign that requires me to research the DnD campaign's development cycle. Some people may enjoy it, but others don't. Any information I need to know about an item that drops for me in-game, should have all the basic information I need to know about it \*in\* the game. Online games have struggled with this because they can change in unforeseen ways, that's typically considered a downside of those games. Why would we want to purposefully implement something like that when we now have the benefit of hindsight, and a stable end-product?
---
While I agree that as a priest wanding is roughly 50% of your DPS that is just a standard of efficiency because wanding costs nothing and you just face tank with the dot ticking. This does have anything to do with the talent it is just a Zero cost form of efficient DPS.
---
Your wand doesn't scale off anything it's damage is static.
---
Since your spells actually scale off + damage and other talents and the RAW values on them are higher the net gain on your coefficients is larger with +spell damage and +crit.
---
Man MC gatekeeping is fucking real in this thread.
---
milking a cow for reading and showing the blizzard post on the video, but giving you the timestamp if you want to skip the post? Are you retarded
---
Fair enough. I'll no longer use 'casual rading' in this context.
---
‚ÄúThis means that if a new item was originally added to a dungeon boss‚Äôs loot table with Ahn‚ÄôQiraj, you shouldn‚Äôt expect it to appear in WoW Classic until Phase 5, which is the phase that contains Ahn‚ÄôQiraj content.‚Äù
---
I'm always a pick a name that fits the lore of your race kind of guy,  maybe I belong on rp PvP. I'll save names like scrubkilla and urmom for fps and rocket league
---
sitting doesnt proc reckoning in pvp or pve unfortunately. doesnt work for any on-crit abilities (enrage for example).
---
I feel like there's not much point in taking a ret over a holy. A feral can off tank, dps a lot better and heal if needed.
---
Realistically how long would it take a guild to complete this quest chain from beginning to end?
---
The best tool for finding your way around:
---
üë£
---
No, they launch TBC and the. Launch WoW Classic Vanilla where you can start over from patch 1.12.
---
I wholeheartedly agree.  This will be really great for the people using the questie addon
---
No because I‚Äôm not a fucking whiney child.
---
Thank you for free scouting reports, *laughs in Alliance*
---
You're right that it will be more difficult when everything is fresh but certainly possible. You're right that pre shadowform the damage you gain is negligible. You're pretty free as a priest talent wise outside of wand and spirit tap
---
The only world first that matters is "First" in barrens chat.
---
That depends entirely on your rank. Stop saying "I think" this and "I think" that. The PvP system is well understood and has been for over a decade.
---
The only reason you care about the stats of an item is because you look stuff up, why would you do that if that's not your idea of fun?
---
&gt; should have all the basic information I need to know about it *in* the game
---
But they don't, not even remotely close, even if you don't do progressive itemization.
---
The killing of world PvP was what killed the feeling of WoW for me. I played through BC and quit in wotlk but I missed when I first started playing WoW and would just camp as a rogue on a main road and gank people as they pass by. It made traveling the world feel so much more dangerous. It really upped the sense of adventure. But with flying mount, there's no realistic danger to and from your destination. I felt nothing when I traveled through areas filled with enemies.
---
Being what this subreddit would refer to as an elitist asshole, i.e. someone who likes to play well.
---
I just want to be a good healer. The last time I felt needed in a guild was 2008 karazhan. They waited for me to get home from work to run late night Kara sessions. I never really had that in vanilla because I was a fringe spec, and non-healer until Kara.
---
Why does this autistic community downvote every fucking poster that know what they are talking about? Holy fuck.
---
&gt;The only reason you care about the stats of an item is because you look stuff up
---
Inaccurate. This isn't Legion, I don't need to sim to understand what stats I want for my class.
---
It'll be in on whatever phase Dire Maul is in on.
---
What kind of content would you prefer to see? Not trying to be snarky, genuinely asking. With not much news going on, they're at least trying to keep the hype going.
---
For that one Warrior who wins the lottery and gets it yeah. I think some private server players are a little too used to busted loot tables and think BRE was something that dropped more than once or twice a year. They're in for a rude awakening.
---
Use your brain. No BG's just mean you can farm less honor per week. But so does the entire rest of the server. It makes absolutely no difference if BG's are out or not.
---
I disagree that the most important question is a release date, but I do agree with the general sentiment that what we're being communicated is kind of stuff we reasonably assumed. If we're only getting a single blue post a week then I'd like some different information, particularly regarding servers, population caps, and sharding, etc.
---
I'm fairly sure it didn't work back then / was removed with the kazzak/recbomb hotfix. If you sit you eat the crit but you won't get charges for abilities that activate on crit.
---
You won't benefit from the 2 last ticks imp sw:p give you unless you basically do one cast -&gt; sw:p -&gt; wand, in that case you should really just be doing mind blast -&gt; sw:p
---
The whole idea of going holy is competing against the value of sw:p and wanding. You will still wand as holy after your shield breaks, but you have to go for the lower kill time to really utilize going divine fury. Holy fire is ok when specced (really high mana efficiency), but mind blast has way higher dps.
---
and bags :)
---
Nothing wrong with that
---
I plan on rolling Druid and being feral for PvP and 5 mans. If I can swing it for casual raiding I‚Äôll be down and if not I have no issue healing. 
---
My follow up question. How bad is MCP farming?
---
solo mara? whats the gear requirement?
---
Engineering is certainly nice, but by no means mandatory.
---
I can think of only a handful of instances where having iron grenades, spell reflectors, and my mc cap *might* had effected the overall outcome of a BG, WSG being where these items arguably shine the most. I'm talking R13/14 team vs R13/14 team. I lived in the grind even after hitting rank. Almost never used eng consumables out in the open world. Would have been a massive waste. For the normie players, these items are sure nice to have, but again definitely not mandatory.
---
If anything, he'd be better served just going herb/alchemy so he can actually make some gold. Leveling up engineering and alchemy is not cheap, and unless his guild either gets to or is good enough to sell raid spots, they're not going to be handing him mats or gold to power level either of those crafting professions. That epic mount, and all of the crusader enchants he'll burn through on various weapons won't buy themselves, on top of everything else he'll need gold for.
---
The Nicker is quite OP for trade chat spam
---
Quick question, I‚Äôm trying to understand about the honor system and the rankings in pvp, after achieving rank 14 and getting respective gear and weapons, and next week don‚Äôt get the rank 14 can I still use them? I‚Äôm really confused. (Planning on going for it on my pally)
---
Well my mains name is going to be eazytank. I‚Äôm kinda hoping to convince my co guild leader to name our guild eazy does it. My reputation I hope to be a tank that makes 5 mans easy. Leads guild runs and eventually become one of the best tanks on my server. Even though there‚Äôs a lot of commitment in that I really want to push myself to create a good environment that attracts players wanting to get geared and have fun.
---
Now imagine having 1.12 dungeons items in your first weeks of playing  that will be your BIS for over a year and will be better than most MC/BWL items.
---
Maybe an idea to create the Iron Forge Gate
---
Step 1. Level to 60.  
---
Step 2. Get sick PvE loot.  
---
Step 3. Destroy in PvP.
---
maybe spend about 30 seconds going over the general jist of the blue post, then discuss how they forsee it affecting the game.  What instances the changes might be for better or for worse.  Share their opinion and maybe some quirky facts about how the system worked in vanilla. And finally to wrap the whole video up nicely, FUCKING SMASH THAT LIKE BUTTON, LIKE FOLLOW SUBSCRIBWEOUHEWRWOPEHIRIPWYHENR
---
i do hope they are farming tyrs hand like 12 years ago. i would like to say hi again with a death coil.
---
I get that a couple of pieces will be OP, like Savage Gladiator Chest piece but its still a tough drop to get.
---
Thankfully, they won't be adding drops til later that weren't there in early Vanilla, like the Turban from UBRS.
---
Oh I'm expecting it to be completely non-existent drops but the possibility even existing will fuel me. I'm not expecting to get Scarab Lord and week 2 Ironfoe or anything, but BRE is a realistically attainable, and very juicy, possibility.
---
16+ hours a day for 3-4 months you mean ?
---
I would like to make good use of a profession. I used to sell swifthistle stacks to rogues, presumably for energy pots. The kicker was I was an alchemist. I don't know why I never made the pots myself. Maybe the herbs were worth more alone. 
---
I think I will go tailoring til I get geared, and then maybe go alchemy or enchanting to sell stuff.  Maybe I will stick with tailoring. No idea. Just wanna be able to throw some money around.
---
That one bald ret paladin
---
Wholesome, I will try this in vanilla. I already like the guys who tip the level 40 like 5 gold for their mount. So this is cool.
---
I like Vanilla, it was so much fun that I cant believe i'm experiencing it again for a second time, if I had to visualize it as an event, Vanilla was like that party where your feeling good the whole time. You found a few people to talk with, your buzzed on beer and maybe you caught the eye of that pretty blonde over in the corner with her friends, just a great good vibe party. TBC is snorting 2 lines of coke off the blonde girls tits and being invited to gang bang after party.           
---
          
---
I know peeps are excited for WoW and I am too but re releasing TBC would blow my fucking mind.
---
Only love from me.
---
Ion further clarified... or projected: [" I'd expect 1.4 additions would be Phase 2; 1.5 additions would be Phase 3. In general, Phase 2 is 1.3-1.4, Phase 3 is 1.5-1.6, Phase 4 is 1.7-1.8, etc. There may be some exceptions I'm failing to recall, but that's the general structure."](https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/1121853269033328641)
---
I'm slightly more cool with this. That puts less caster gear in phase 1, I  believe?
---
Oh I see what you're saying, people are just reading the blue post word for word and that's it? LOL
---
This pretty much. In my experience, most Raids bring the player rather than the Class.
---
If some of your most dedicated and best players want to change main character, you let them.
---
&gt;  This isn't Legion, I don't need to sim to understand what stats I want for my class. 
---
Okay, where inside the game can you find information about hit tables or proc rates? Where do you see the effect weapon skill has on your character? How do you know how much regen spirit gives you?
---
&gt; here is a middle-ground between attempting to play the game correctly, and min-max. 
---
No, min/maxing *is* intending to play the game correctly.
---
**&lt;Maelstrom&gt; Alliance community. Recruiting more players for Classic. We‚Äôre a serious progression guild with a 3-night raid schedule. T/W/TH starting at 7pm central time.**
---
**Currently, we are only looking for active and dedicated players who are interested in raiding with us twice a week on our test server. We believe that by playing together prior to the release of Classic, will give us an advantage in terms of progression as well as to allow us to get to know each other better.**
---
**We are not looking for those who just want to populate the roster and then never participate in any guild events (we have plenty of those).**
---
**If you meet the requirements and want to know more, send me a msg on discord.**   **Frost#6270**
---
You are wrong, but keep that attitude, you are the best.
---
&gt;can push armor values into the negative
---
Oh look. Another idiot who watch Tipsout and dont fact check.
---
Prot has Reckoning, but you're gonna be more of a hybrid spec, it only takes 25 points in prot. So like 0/25/26 or something, and there's a holy version too that this guy Drakova has some videos about. It's really not what you'd imagine if you hear "prot paladin PvP" because the whole prot tree is just a path to Reckoning.
---
Reckoning is a powerful gimmick. It's not consistently good, but with the right setup it can one-shot people. You can kind of compare it to PoM-Pyro but more defensive. Using a Reckoning build is a hassle because you need to fuck around a lot to get the five stacks, and it's not so good in BGs where you can't pull a low-level mob and sit down to let it crit you for stacks.
---
Reckoning is alright. It's not up there with the powerhouse specs but it's an acceptable spec in BGs just because paladins have such good support. People will prefer if you're holy, but as long as you pay attention and cleanse CC from people around you, they'll be satisfied. Ret damage output can vary from trash to very decent depending on gear and circumstances. Not so great for solo PvP because it's so easy to kite a paladin.
---
Huge amount of creatures with missing special attacks, complete random ones, or none at all. 
---
Boss and dungeon encounters with entirely guesstimated hp/mana/damage. 
---
List goes on
---
Private servers have a bunch of their own problems, they aren‚Äôt all sunshine and rainbows.
---
Because they can control the market and keep away competitors from killing them.
---
I am level 10 on a Pserver I will run some tests and see.
---
Yeah that one Warrior who wins the lottery and gets it will be incredibly OP... if he's Horde and has access to Windfury. 
---
If he's Alliance he'll just be strong.
---
Holy shit bro just wait until you‚Äôve dedicated 400 hours to that server and it gets nuked when classic launches. Or if it doesn‚Äôt enjoy playing it but I personally would rather play on official servers without the risk of losing my time investment. Also your speculation on performance is speculation.
---
I have two questions.
---
1.	Can anyone recommend a good priest build solely for PVE? I want to do lots of raiding I plan on being a healer.
---
2.	I also want to do plenty of solo questing, will this interfere with my build for raids? 
---
Thank you in advance have a good day :)
---
NOCHANGES
---
They must put a minimum queue time for BGs of an hour, maybe two
---
None of that reasonable queue time shit! I played vanilla back in the day, and lemme tell you, nothing was more fun than waiting in queue for hours just so I could recognize the names on the other end!
---
/s
---
Shortly after launch, sure. But before AQ, it'll be closer to 100 per server. That gear didn't get upgraded to it's 1.12 power until the Naxx patch iirc
---
"Oh I see what you're saying, people are just reading the blue post word for word and that's it? LOL ". Alright guys, that's the latest comment from Rolling Hammer.  Don't forget to check me out at [twitch.tv/pwjjj](https://twitch.tv/pwjjj).  Toss me a follow, and I'll see you next time.
---
&gt;But the guild I was in gave all of it to the tanks cause in 8 months it'll be tanking gear
---
Your guild was led by idiots then. 8 months is forever. Tanks will have their full sets by then.
---
Yeah, but only like 1% of players ever get access to it.
---
T0.5 won't be until AQ if I recall correctly
---
well sucks for you then lol
---
Although I've been seeing a lot of people talking about how optimal specs and stuff is overblown for end game pve because getting 40 people to show up on time is hard enough. So if a raid has a dps spot open they won't say no to your ret pally. However I totally get if someone who does 40 man raids would hate to be a sub-optimal character by nature of playstyle. 
---
Good luck whether you go ret or roll something else regardless!
---
Imo worth it, cross realm stuff killed server identity and was probably one of the reasons world pvp died off. i'd rather have long q's but know the enemy and build rivals.
---
It is if you consider baiting yourself
---
Can you dual wield those or is it unique?
---
&gt; Demonshear
---
Demonshear is added in the nax patch is it not and they explicitly state that items will be added into the game at the appropriate time so no arcanite reaper will not be redundant. its just item that were already in the game but got reworked later that will be in their final form
---
I hate this sentiment that people need to ‚Äúshut up‚Äù. If we hadn‚Äôt shut up you wouldn‚Äôt even have Classic WoW to begin with.
---
I'm a little disappointed, but at the same time I understand. They came out and said a long time ago they aren't looking to run another MMO alongside BFA. To that end I expected a rollout similar to the pserver model, attempting to capture an authentic experience but not necessarily down to every last detail stat.
---
I'm a little disappointed it isn't quite as progressive as I'd have liked, but at the same time I honestly wasn't expecting content buckets at all so I'm pretty thrilled to have any nod to progression at all.
---
I took the last remark on the blue post about "this takes pressure off players so they aren't wondering what we'll do next", hinting at players feeling like they constantly have to re min/max, to mean more of a "it's difficult and time consuming and we don't wanna because reasons".
---
So yeah, I'm a little disappointed that at least some of the glaring changes that trivialize the game unexpectedly aren't going to get some kind of attention via content buckets, but at the same time, I understand why.
---
Still you have no idea how many raids couldn't get past the trash or the first few boss
---
Even on nostalrius  I had so many pugs that coudln't get past lucifron
---
Hand of justice was always a pretty op trinket.
---
Still on you mate :)
---
&gt;we just don‚Äôt have any idea how accurate that was compared to the real classic data and tuning.
---
However we DO know that bosses have dramatically more armor on private servers. Actually, almost every time someone has looked deeply into comparing the two versions, private servers consistently come out on top as the harder version.
---
What happens with T2 from Onyxia and Ragnaros lootable before BWL releases? Will they only drop 2 items? 4?
---
And you're getting classic 1.12, warts and all #nochange
---
Although I agree, lets not try and say they arent doing this for any other reason than try to revive a playerbase and make money.
---
This was mail gear that had +defense on it but was later changed to offensive stats right? Fuck, rip my dreams of building a tank shaman set early on using this gear
---
I did this when I needed a few signatures for my bank alt guild. Good times. Turns out people are a lot more willing to join your cult... eh guild if you give them something usable.
---
i thought we killed rag by getting knocked back into the mountain
---
Imagine being salty because content creators need to make money to keep living your dreams of playing games for a living.
---
Yikes
---
At least one person will get R14 every week. Multiple people will get rank 12/13 gear every week. Considering how many months will be between the honor system and AQ, when the raid gear finally starts catching up, having the 1.12 PvP gear from the start is absolutely gamebreaking.
---
Wow I feel so important
---
You can be good at the game as in single person, but if you are in a casual raid, even Ragnaros can whipe your T2 Squad.
---
FACT. I have done this on P-Server, because I didn't care, just wanted to test some classes and raided Casual. It's a waste of time imo. All your best players get poached or get frustrated and leave.
---
Maybe you should play casual and see for yourself that you neither need to play hamster wheel, nor chasing after first kills.
---
You are allowed a middle ground, you don't need to choose one extreme or another.
---
shoulders from brd will be good now
---
That would be disgusting. Considering the information released so far I would be surprised if they did it. Alrhough I would not be against some form of queue protection. Say when queues go over an hour it auto links you to one other realm, and so on
---
It's both main-hand and unique.
---
There are people that put out actual content though.  I'll turn on the reading rainbow if I want someone to sound out words for me
---
&gt;I hope so, it is much harder to rank up before BGs
---
Why do people repeat this? It isnt true. Your total honorpoints determine your standing for the week which determines how many ranking points you get.
---
It makes no difference if BG's are out or not. It will be harder for the rankers to get honor, but it will also be harder for everyone else to get honor, so the total standing for the week will still be the same.
---
This right here. You have to put too much work and dedication into a character to get it to 60. Might as well play what you want and not what others say you should play.
---
This is sad, I want to use it right now to see what changes will classic have it was a very useful site
---
Is there another site  to check the item changes ?
---
http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-paladin/1069149.htm May 2006
---
&gt;Can I sit down to force a crit and gain a (reckoning)charge? 
---
Charges will not generate off auto attacks or npc attacks by trying to sit down and force a crit. However, ability crits from physical abilities such as Sinister Strike, Hamstring, Auto-shot, Aimed shot, etc will generate a charge if you're sitting.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;* 240 fps
---
What kind CRT monitor you got to support that fps?
---
&gt;* 30 ms ping
---
One of the few benefits of living in eastern Europe
---
&gt;* no sharding
---
No mobs at launch to kill either
---
&gt;* no client errors
---
Plenty of bugs, broken quests and server crashes though
---
&gt;* 10k people online, can handle thousand people in orgrimmar
---
And a third of them are bots and gold farmers. Have fun trying to buy raid consumes without buying gold
---
This was exactly what happened. I saw a recommended video that literally had a guy who just woke up saying he hasn't even read the blue post yet but he thought it would be "fun" to read it together and give his thoughts. I don't understand why he couldn't read it before the video and give his thoughts in a structured way in the first place. This seemed like such a rushed content grab. I'd really like for someone to get into how the blue post changes BiS for different classes for example.
---
And then the server suddenly  shuts down and you lost everything .
---
Neat
---
One year of Milton core sounds awful. Actually, it would be two years.
---
PISS OFF ! BAITIN!
---
It‚Äôs whack a mole with heal spells. Oh he‚Äôs down 10% let me que a heal for 25% oh there‚Äôs 3 monsters on the tank that we accidentally aggro Ed better start winding that big expensive heal. Cool nothing going on tank is over geared I‚Äôm gonna wand this shit to start revenging mana.
---
Sorry didn't mean to say Holy can solo mara, I forgot I had said holy for lasher farm. Definitely doable as shadow, probably pre-raid BiS would be enough. I've seen a few videos of people doing it, but usually in MC+ gear. Mind soothe to get past mobs, kite princess till she dies. Not as fast as hunter or lock, but better than druid princess farms IMO.
---
Agree with much of what you said.
---
I think this breaks down a bit, though, when it comes to moving out of the starting zone and into the level 10+ zones. So you have a smooth entry into the game with sharding, but then all of a sudden you cross into Westfall and it's a madhouse. Doesn't this solution basically punt the problem into the next zone?
---
On the other hand, Druid tanks need the boss for their bis gloves.
---
Cross-realm BGs were singled out in the blizzcon presentation as not coming into the game. The mechanics that are being referred to are likely the old bug of mind controlling players through the BG portal to make them leave, and the timer on the flag carrier preventing turtle WSG matches.
---
The old, levelling in Teir 2 technique
---
Thanks for the daily "play wat u want" post
---
Im glad we have this thread re-worded every day
---
the more you know
---
Remember, you can get all the rewards besides the mount (and potentially title) after AQ is open. You also don't need as much rep to grind as you get quite a bit of rep running AQ.
---
To whoever made, http://itemization.info . Your site is still extremely useful as it shows which patch each item was added into the game, which is what blizzard plans on doing in each stage, adding gear into the loot tables in each patch.
---
There's so much ***SMART*** in this post.
---
Let me say this again Casual =/ bad. Being a bad player and player with bad people makes you bad.
---
Just because you've played with bad casual players doesn't mean all casual players are bad.
---
Got over a week of PTO saved up. I'm going to be such a fat sweaty nerd this summer.
---
And now the typical "wasn't an attack but if the hat fits" card. I should have known better than engage an argument. Sigh
---
Hm I don't think 1.12 talents are as big as 1.12 items
---
I would say talents are like a +30% buff and items +60%
---
I'd love to see someone theorycraft this
---
This is common across many different gaming communities lately. Dunno why people are so allergic to googling/reading news in under 5 minutes and would rather watch a dumb youtube video that reads it to them for 10+ minutes.
---
Most people that do Hardcore no lifer need to fill out a application to join the guild WONT MAKE IT TO NAXX. It's strange the statistic for players who even went into Naxx is something like 10% and yet 100% of everyone here apparently cleared it?
---
When pve gear was just as viable in pvp.
---
&gt;Okay, where inside the game can you find information about hit tables or proc rates? Where do you see the effect weapon skill has on your character? How do you know how much regen spirit gives you?
---
By observing what happens why you equip items with those stats. 
---
&gt;No, min/maxing *is* intending to play the game correctly.
---
No. Don't tell others how to play the game "correctly", that's a completely subjective thing.
---
This dude is 100% correct.
---
People forget that everything they do in vanilla raiding affects 39 other people.  Having someone with a shitty spec is the same as having someone with poor attendance, and is the same as having someone who sucks at the game.  It adversely affects 39 other people, and won't be tolerated in any semi-hardcore guild looking to raid AQ40 and Naxx.
---
Would guilds generally give swords to humans first? Debating race choice but if human is going to be easier to gear I think it'll make the decision easier.
---
Yeah but itemization.info is down. Where can I get the patch in which an item was added ? Wowhead classic seem to always give patch 1.11 for everything including Blackcrow.
---
We are planning to level up with my friend, he will be a mage. Me as resto main shaman. Will it be playable to us if i pick resto talents and gear?
---
thanks! cant wait to try, got a alt for backup gold incase no mara / lashers till phase 2 :)
---
Ah yeah good point u bring there. So i've been discussing this a lot. I've been researching a lot and all i found was nothing literally. There isn't"t much info about the Hemo rogue sadly that is still up to date, however, on buffed or somewhere else if u look for the old servo arm item, u will see that a lot of people are talking about the Hemo rogue using this.
---
So, i wanted to find out, what it's actually about with Hemo rogue. i used it in MC, BWL, AQ40 even(not all the time, just sometimes to test the DMG), and while it for sure is boosting the melee dmg(1 Hemo = 30x9 = 270 Damage) it is not viable as ur own damage is too low for it to be really viable.
---
But somehow, especially with the anubisath warhammer, servo arm and being a human, it does more DMG then the other rogues are able to do + u boost the meeles dmg too. I tested it out myself, the results were shocking. I gotta see if i have some Screenshots to prove this.
---
Though with full T3, combat rogues might be above ur DMG, but counting the 270 more DMG per Hemo makes ur spec better again. Though assasination rogues ofc. will do more DMG if behind the boss. So, we actually wanted to have 1 Hemo Rogue in the raid, and that was me. I wish i could play this spec earlier already, but fiven the fact that it's literally shit before Naxx, let's me play a Feral DPS. 
---
tl;dr
---
There is no Prove for it, all i can give u is my own experience and maybe some Screenshots, u could ofc ask others on private Servers that alread cleared Naxx too, they might be able to Provide u with the same info, if they were even bothering to try out how the Hemo rogue works out.
---
That's nice, keep playing private servers then.
---
Honestly this is fucked up but, it's good fucked up. If this happened to me I would get a good laugh at it. Like in AV summoning them to the tunnel and snow balling them into leaver. I think mischievous is a good thing. Especially if there are no name changes and you have to live with your reputation.
---
Bonereaver is fucking rare my dude.
---
Wanting Blizzard to tune the raids so that they're harder for everyone is very different from wanting the raids to be harder for your guild only for no gain.  Nobody is going to handicap themselves like that.
---
On private servers, only the first hit of reck can trigger SoC. That is why I heard Holy/reck (26/25/0) is a thing and Retreck isn't actually that good. I wonder how it will work in classic.
---
My little brother didnt resell them, but I found out one day at target that he was just ripping boxes open every other month to get his sub.
---
Hmm you have a point about SotC and BoM, once you get SoC you basically never touch it again and with BoM we're definitely not going to be topping the charts. 
---
But I totally didn't even think that you might not be going to PvP talents, sorry about that haha. But I like that newer build you posted. That's a good "out in the world doing stuff while also healing PvE content" build, I made a few tweaks to fit my needs for PvP but I think this is the build I'm gonna go with now. Might test it tonight and see what's what. 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/AzzUxAAErwN83A
---
Haha I am a college student and had a good giggle because of course you have responsibilities but not if you choose not to have haha.
---
However my girlfriend will make sure I will not play to much I am sure about that
---
Keep in mind we now know the damage they cause, we have the benefit of hindsight
---
&gt; By observing what happens why you equip items with those stats.
---
And how are you going to judge what's better 1% hit or 12 agility?
---
You'll get the biggest range of healing tools in the game. While paladins beat you on direct single target output and druids on hots you're the undisputed AE healer of the alliance. 
---
Also, if you die you'll get the angel.
---
BWL is going to be decimated by the private server veterans and hardcore min-maxers no matter what, so who cares.
---
All the gear in the world isn't going to save your raid if people fuck up mechanics on Razoregore and Vael.
---
The point isnt so much what it does to the difficulty of PvE, but what it does to the available upgrades. Some of the blue items are so good you can in several cases completely bypass gear from MC, ZG and BWL by just getting the blue farmable item from a 5man.
---
It GREATLY devalues the raid gear.
---
If he was milking he would have made a 10 or 20 minutes video
---
Don't be stupid
---
According to [the wiki](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Rhok%27delar,_Longbow_of_the_Ancient_Keepers) it was added in patch 1.04.
---
[Going by what Ion Hazzikostas tweeted earlier](https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/1121853269033328641) we can assume that it will probalby become available in phase 2, but since he started the tweet with "I'd expect" there is a chance that he doesn't know for certain and was just guessing, in which case it might as well be available in phase 1 too.
---
I don't quite remember how it works, but isn't there a minimum honour requirement for the higher ranks? Or could you make it to rank 14 with only 100 honour a week if the second best guy only got 99 for example?
---
Because he doesn‚Äôt understand plurals
---
Yeah, once classic is out I don't expect to stop playing it. Like ever. I might take years long brakes but as long as there are servers to play on I'll probably just keep coming back. Might as well make sure they get it right.
---
Do you have ANY idea whatsoever how rare BRE is. I mean actually rare, not private server rare, not "buy it for $50 from a GM who'll spawn it for you rare", rare in Classic WoW with accurate loot tables.
---
Back in Vanilla I saw ONE Bonereaver's Edge drop in the space of a year. A YEAR.
---
Yes. As long as you buy the items while you have the rank you can always use them.
---
And I had multiple friends who played the game WITH me who didn't experience anything longer then an hour. So that invalidates what strangers and trolls say
---
It had some major flaws. Arena, flying, daft story, etc.
---
Offft, melee‚Äôing in your rotation in raid?!?! Never did that in all the time I raided vanilla, and I was in Naxx.
---
Some great stuff, especially dragonstalker expose armor info. 
---
Great idea about getting aimed shot 1st. I like that and will remember that. 
---
Thanks for sharing this, that guy is epic! üëç
---
1. What you want?
---
2. Zug, zug.
---
3. Work, work.
---
4. Something need doing. 
---
5. Me not that kind of orc.
---
Yes, you can still use them if you don't maintain Rank 14. It used to be before 1.12 you HAD to maintain the rank to continue using the weapons but in Classic you only have to be Rank 14 to buy them.
---
But this post didn't change anything. They just restated what they said in the last update about itemisation.
---
arrows aren't that expensive to buy and you usually need more of them than you think. plus because you stay back and don't get hit most of the time, you spend less on food for yourself, and if your pet eats meat you can usually just feed them whatever drops off of mobs.
---
they're pretty fun to play and have a lot of tricks up their sleeves. im maining hunter and i recommend
---
It was 1%.
---
Some on here straight up lie and some have cleared naxx on pservers (nothing wrong with pservers) and claim they cleared naxx in vanilla
---
Not really. It's handy while levelling and trying to hide in world pvp. It's very rarely useful in BGs. It can buy you an extra 5 seconds defending a node but compared to an actual strong racial like hardiness, wotf, or stoneform it's a very weak ability.
---
Nostalrius gave you 8 debuff slots and progressive itemization. And guess what? MC was still cleared by 39 people in dungeon blues on the second week of the server. 
---
Molten Core is trivial REGARDLESS.
---
pservers will be good containment zones for the unwanted
---
Seems blizzard sorta answered this and said that they will probably be in Phase 2 then for benediction and such. https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/1121853269033328641
---
You're interpreting my feelings as a personal attack. I don't know what else to say about that.
---
That would effectively kill most of my enthusiasm, why would I want to play a game that's going to erase my progress? That is the reason servers become barren toward the release of new expansions
---
Honestly you took only 15g per person. This is just good clean rogue fun. You would be a douche for taking a real amount of gold though.
---
It's a massive waste of gold to be respeccing for dungeons while leveling.
---
Everyone was flasked up in Vanilla. Stacking every possible world buff , elixir, dark rune?
---
No. Didn't happen.
---
Its not cross realm, its cross battleground
---
you still had identity and rivalries and all that
---
Lol well stated. I am completely hung up on female Nelf for my hunter, there is nothing that comes close.
---
Reminds me of when my brother looted Sash of Mercy when while leveling up and it used to be BoP, he ended up vendoring before it became BoE. I played a druid so I was extremely pissed when I found out.
---
And where, exactly, did I say there weren't queue times in vanilla? Of COURSE there were qeue times. I've explicitly stated in other comments here that myself and my friends have experienced queue times. But that's a small price to pay to avoid sharding. Sharding separates the community. I made a few friends and just generally socialized with people in starting areas because of how bustling and busy they were. It forces people to actually fucking communicate and group up in an mmo to progress 
---
Crazy concept, I know!
---
You so realize wow isn't a single player game, right? Maybe if you're a BfA refugee, there's a good chance you had forgotten that or didn't even know
---
Why is it so hard to ban gold seller accounts?????
---
I mean, Im standing in IF and BAM, someone is spamming the bridge with a level 1 character shouting GOLD GOLD.
---
I get Blizz cant watch millions of toons at once, but at least have a full time monitoring team.  If 3 people report someone, immediately open that toon on their screens to see WTF its doing, and then BAN, done.
---
Maybe dont allow free accounts for level 1?  I dont know, something!  Stop the gold sellers.  Cancer for the game.
---
It's not that we put a ton of weight into it, but in general they tend to know more than me (the good ones), so it's nice hearing their opinions. Same way I watch  and listen to sports commentary.
---
I completely agree. And tried to make this argument.
---
&gt;400 hours
---
Those are rookie numbers. You gotta pump those numbers up.
---
You could've just started and ended with "i pvped as Prot warrior in WotLK." That's asshole enough.
---
That‚Äôs awesome lol

"Wow I feel so important" Alright guys, that's the latest comment from Rolling Hammer. Hopefully we get some more comments in the near future. Don't forget to check me out at twitch.tv/pwjjj. Toss me a follow, and I'll see you next time.
---
But people won‚Äôt be able to use those 2h swords!
---
Everything is rare until it drops. The iterations of guild clears will be huge since MC will be easy mode. Just don't want to hear the crying when a BRE warrior destroys the damage meters while smashing world pvp.
---
It's not that rare either, definitely lower drop rate vs. other items, but not an eye of sulfuras we are talking about either.
---
Far less does not mean not at all. You do realize private servers had respawn rates for black lotus under 10 minutes. Vanilla had this at 2 hours. Fewer people per server and fewer nodes is a pretty good indication that there will be fewer people flashing.
---
Also your "everyone" is hardly true. Case in point I raided through AQ 40 and early Naxx. I wasn't flashing. Yes it's an anecdote, but it's no worse than your sweeping claim.
---
I do not remember that at all. Hope there's more stuff I forgot I can rediscover
---
You're not sure why? It's celebrity-ism. 40 year old women read up on gywenth paltrow cootie steaming liver cleanses, and some types of nerds watch others play and talk about games to feel apart of a community. The 'famous' person desperately tries milk money out of anyone that follows them and the followers desperately try to gain identity by being part of the club.  
---
I don't know what you're complaining about, it's a great system.
---
So can a ret? Except dps slightly worse but give everyone in the raid an additional blessing. If you are under 5 pallies
---
Shit I had the frostfire I shouldve known
---
This will be difficult even on a PvP server because barrens is a horde zone and not contested.
---
Eternally grateful
---
Horde cities are Mud hut garbage dumps
---
If you think having 10k people crammed into a single server is a plus point then there's honestly no hope for you. Jesus Christ.
---
Cool story bro their content is still better than your shot post.
---
It builds keybind muscle memory and gets you used to your own class mechanics. I just explained this in my post. Weird you skipped it.
---
If you'll be doing it at 60, get used to doing it 1-59.

This is why I'm an advocate for changes. Why not fix the obviously broken hybrid specs like Balance, Prot Paladin, ret, enhancement and elemental? Give librams, totems, idols that grant spec specific abilities that make them viable.
---
I honestly think it would be much better for classic if they tweaked things just a tiny bit. The numbers and the class balance isn't what made Vanilla good.
---
It really depends on what experience you want to have. If you pick the "optimal" melee DPS class and don't have fun, aren't you in the same position?
---
Remember, no pre~~orders~~thanks. 
---
My server, Shattered Hand, had a huge alliance faction imbalance and as such the horde almost never got world bosses. One time Kazzak spawned at like 4am when the server was dead. Horde took this as their one chance at Kazzak so multiple guilds all banded together in a rag-tag team to try and take him down. I, a hunter, began training dreadlords into them while Schmitty, a warrior, began using AOE fear on their raid. We did this for close to 8 hours straight until an alliance guild showed up and killed Kazzak 1st try. 
---
Ironically it was neither my guild nor Schmitty's. And, on top of that, Schmitty and I were in the two biggest rival alliance guilds on the server, Death and Taxes, and Drama, who had fought each over Kazzak many times before that but we were able to put aside our differences to make sure that at least no horde scum were able to kill Kazzak. It was beautiful :).
---
Well there is a difference between creating interesting, thought provoking content, and spending 8 minutes reading a blue post.  There are plenty of creators out there who could make something as bland as a blue post a deep topic of discussion.  Sharing their opinion, explaining how the changes can affect the game and maybe giving some unknown insight into the topic.

&gt; Blizzard new improved client and server

I think some of your time estimations that include boats or zepplins might be off. Your site lists the boat from BB to Ratchet as taking 2 minutes. If you just miss the boat then you could be waiting for up to 5 minutes before the boat arrives, another 1 minute waiting for the boat to leave, and then the 2 minutes of travel time.
---
TL;DR
---
BB to Ratchet Boat could cost you up to 8 minutes. 2 minutes is the minimum possible time if you arrive perfectly.
---
Instead of being upset at the "uptight, tryhard, asshole", why not accept that people want to team up with viable specs and advocate that the laggards get some buffs?
---
If you actually hold this belief, seek help. Immediately.
---
If they just consolidated low pop servers it wouldn't be an issue. I seem to remember them doing in back then but not very often..
---
Min-maxing is intending to play the game correctly to an extreme degree. Again there's shades of grey you seem to want to ignore. Like there's a guy who follows the intuitive mechanics of a game as he sees them appear, and then there's a guy who reads walkthroughs to find optimal paths that may not be as apparent.
---
Usually main tank or healer so warrior or priest
---
I've tried leveling both BM and Marks.  What it comes down to is BM is massively OPed when leveling especially in PvP, while Marks really doesn't come into it's own until you get well geared. 
---
Some people argue that you should do marks until amishot first because shot weaving is going to be your bread and butter, but if your do the normal BM-&gt;Aimshot at 51 you'll still have 9 very long levels to learn how to DPS correctly.  Secondly, you learn how to kite  in PvP when using a BM, more so than when using aimshot, which revolves more around trapping the target for an aimshot.  In my experience kiting is more difficult to master than is trapping and shot weaving.
---
Literally any raid class can lead. Can anyone be a good leader though? That's up for debate. Probably not.
---
And if you have problems with being kited take up engineering and get some rocket boots. So many cool alternatives and options in vanilla.
---
Maybe a fast sword in off hand with sword spec then. Because i think the extra procs proc a main hand attack. At least I remember a main hand Fist off hand sword spec from TBC like that.
---
Same
---
Maybe they should make some actualy good content instead of stretching a small bit of news into a 10+ min video just to qualify for that ad money?
---
Literally unplayable. I'm going back to Hello Kitty's Island Adventure.
---
the best solution would just be to retune the content, I realize that would take some resources, but nothing too insane, just tweak the raid stats a bit
---
I always play holy while leveling. Keep your plan, holy damage is almost as good as shadow (trust me) Once you get spirit guidance. you will keep on pair with shadow priest without shadow form. Also you can do AoE grind quite well with Holy Nova. Spirit tap boost that so much, and includes a huge damage boost once you get SG.    
---
I suggest you add Holy Nova and Inner focus in your plan there.    
---
I also would consider adding healing focus (depending on how confident you feel with fade and PW:S use)    
---
Go 05 disc / 0 holy / 05 shadow first.    
---
Wand is at it's strongest pre 35. Find a good wand plan, worth going BFD asap (lvl 21-25 ish) for really good wand.
---
Pservers are also completely unmoderated and/or corrupt. 
---
If you think the huge playerbase from NA is getting decent ping on pservers then you're trippin bruh. I never did better than 160-200ms there but on a local retail server I sit around 39ms consistently.
---
Preferably a non-melee class because you see 99% of the time a full frontal off the boss. 
---
Easy rotation/duty
---
So mage or hunter - maybe warlock
---
Really living up to that username, good stuff. You gonna play on a RP server as well?  Lemme know what you roll and I'll teach you how to play it.
---
yeah, savage gladiator chain is bis for fury in most circumstances until AQ40 where it can still be better than the breastplate there depending on your other items
---
Not even close to often enough
---
I just don't trust Blizz to do it..
---
Most of the people who don't want crossrealm were either part of the 0.1% who could afford to spend a full-time job pvping or the 10% that had a good, balanced, populated server.
---
I can only remember 1 single person owning IF on my server back in Vanilla but they said the proc rate was pretty abysmal (2% at best) and then I believe it was nerfed so it also couldn't proc off itself?  Could be mis-remembering that all, tbh, but I think the general consensus is a lot of the private servers had the proc rate juiced up to make the item more worthy of its rarity.
---
Nice!
---
Thats a big wall of text for you to not answer the original question. So yes im okay with the other guy trying to answer to the best of his abilities. It is more information than you have given. "Shows how mature this community is" that they dont have the reading comprehension to answer the question asked.
---
If you're a child.
---
It was for swiftthistle tea.
---
This is pretty dang close to it! Has even more details, thanks for the post man, appreciate it!
---
Sure, you can label it however you want, point still stands.
---
&gt;Consumables will also be far less used in Classic than private servers. If your basis for saving time and gold is using those you're in for a rude awakening. Private server respawn rates and the economy will not be comparable.
---
I would be very surprised if people didn't use consumables. If they don't, then that just means cheaper consumables for tryhards and the gap between their clear times and the average clear time will be even larger, which just further reinforces my point.. lol.
---
Mats are usually worth more than the finished product because the act of crafting the product also has value [to people who are leveling that profession]
---
full t1 or t2
---
then gank the shit out of everyone
---
Warlock or mage.
---
You mostly just spam shadow/frost bolt and dont have a giant boss blocking your view.
---
There is no way you killed c'thun if you didn't flask.
---
Most mid-tier guilds like yours in vanilla didn't even kill twin emps.
---
I remember quite well what it was like.
---
Best use of the meme format yet.
---
Well done ü§£
---
It was the worst thing added to vanilla
---
I hope he brings the site back its still extremely useful in finding out when new items are added in each patch. Blizzard plans on adding in gear during each content stage as mentioned in the blue post. Please bring it back if you are reading this! :)
---
What happened on pservers is directly the opposite - they nerfed Ironfoe despite having evidence in the form of old forum quotes of higher procrate, because it was too strong.
---
It is more useful than ever right now, we want to figure out what will actually be different
---
This is a great idea! Could make it a long term project creating a time-lapse of all passing players showing level and gear progression over time.
---
I'm still hoping there will be atleast one RP-PvP realm for me to join, as I'd really prefer that kind of server. If they make one after launch, I think I'll abandon my character and roll a new one.
---
kids dont have much money. kids dont have credit cards.
---
kids want to play wow. kids parents buy game but dont like spending more money on what they already paid for.
---
stores dont protect the game time cards, and you only have to get them once every 2 months.
---
--&gt; kids shoplift
---
Honestly though, it's pretty crazy that they had fully activated cards in the box, no need for a barcode scan to activate or anything. They also were not locked up, just in a cardboard box.
---
 Not that it excuses the theft.
---
I suspect it is not that people don't want to read, it is more likely that these 'content creators' want to put up a new video and farm click with low effort videos and YouTube and Twitch are enabling them by pushing their videos.
---
If that's what you got out of his post then I don't think anyone can help you
---
I‚Äôm not sure how this challenges my statement. Of course some people do different/better work than others. None of that changes the fact that You have to work in the systems that YouTube has created if that‚Äôs how you create your revenue. The fact is releasing a video first that‚Äôs 10+ minutes is the best way to create revenue on that platform. Blame YouTube not the content creators.
---
People were shit back in a day to kill Ragnaros that often, not because gms didn't spawn them.
---
Hmm thats a fair point. Rotation isn't something i've ever really been challenged by but if its as simple as pressing a single button that gives a lot more time to watch for mechanics and make callouts and see who is being bad.
---
Fuck yes!
---
The best I got right now is a webarchive of Allakhazam before Dire Maul patch (march 2005) :

---
Decimated by some people, will be a challenge to semiminmaxers.
---
100% agree, the cat dps i remember sucked without NW, OOC and LOTP. Really promising to hear that the ret dps is decent and you can still heal. Thanks a ton, decision to roll a pally officially made. Now I can have my spring / summer back and stop lurking in these forums haha.
---
I pray they fail to make a living by churning out absolute garbage in increments of 10:05
---
Except /gquit now actually had a confirmation box asking if you really want to leave your guild because you lose reputation ranks.
---
Not sure where you get this idea from, most guilds run 2-3 resto druids and 1-2 feral druids on pservers.
---
Even then BGs werent crossrealm like things are now.
---
It was battlegroups, and I feel like they'll have to wait for server populations to be pretty defined as high/med/low to be able to set those up IF they even decide to.
---
Checks post yep I still would rather hear their oppinions than look at the lack of productive conversation happening in this thread.
---
To use your own point, a tryhard is simply that, someone who "trys" hard. This isn't indicative of performs well. You can play the game 16 hours a day and have every consumable available in use and still be utter trash at the game. Using consumables makes things easier, yes. No one would refute that. It however is not an indication of success or skill.
---
Give a rifleman an old musket or someone who's never shot a gun before a newer rifle. The experienced person is more likely to succeed than the noobie.
---
What's the differences in dungeon farming? Was it different in 1.12 than other patches?
---
The water in the lake of mount hyjal was originally pure. After the first invasion of the legion, Illidan took several vials of water he had saved from the original well. As the war ended, with the portal collapsing and the city of Zin Azshara being sucked under, the well split the world in two, and the refugees retreated all the way back to the mountain.
---
During the war, Malfurion had acquired a seed from the World Tree, which iirc had been destroyed during the war. Upon setting out to rebuild their civilization, the elves found Illidan at the top of the mountain, where he had just poured the contents of the well into the water, creating a second Well of Eternity.
---
Finally recognizing the dangers of the well, the high elves quickly sought to make Illidan pay for this act, though he was confused, believing he had done a great service for the elves. Fused with the passion he mistook for love toward Tyrande, combined with the pain of rejection, mixed with jealousy from his brother, he couldn‚Äôt handle what happened next - Malfurion produced the seed, which was blessed by Elune through Tryande, who had selected Malfurion as her mate over Illidan. Next, all who could offered their blessing to the seed, and the tree was planted on an island in the center of the lake he had just converted into a well...
---
The tree grew quickly, and purified the waters of the lake, essentially removing the tainted well-waters. (Or did it...?)
---
Illidan was imprisoned, to be sentenced for his crimes. Forever banished and rejected by his people. Forever carrying the mark of the legion - a solemn reminder of the price he paid for his greed and lust for power.
---
Ideally they would just consolidate low pop servers when they fell below a certain threshold to keep them all medium to high. If you WANT to play on a low pop server you shouldn't complain about queue times. Something about having cake and eating it too.
---
Either way I'm ok with battlegroups, you still eventually get to know the people in your group. Especially when your involved in the premade game.
---
Shitposting in /world.
---
Glad they're going to start relatively small and expand, dead realms will drive away far more people than a queue will.  That being said, would seem surprising if they don't include an RP-PVP realm as there are a few hugely popular ones in retail
---
&gt; they're at least trying to keep the hype going.
---
They're not keeping it going, they're trying to cash in on it.
---
The only reason why people watch their garbage content is because of the hype.
---
It really, really sucks!
---
I think they were smart enough to not worry about trying to get it ‚Äúperfect‚Äù because they likely understand that there is literally no way to get there with how many different conflicting opinions on what ‚Äúperfect‚Äù entails. So there‚Äôs also ‚ÄúWhat would please the most amount of people‚Äù to consider... but that doesn‚Äôt really invalidate your point as a lot of people that like this are saying that it‚Äôs good to not have to also take future phase changes into account when determining how good a drop/reward is.
---
This is the one thing I wanted to avoid, honestly. I didnt play when vanilla started so I have no idea what items would need to be held in my bank while itemization progresses. It's confusing and lackluster to have to research every single item for that purpose.
---
I tried to search on this subreddit and online but couldn‚Äôt find an answer. Has there been talk about whether or not they are keeping the interaction between Troll tusks and helmets true to Vanilla or are they going to fix it like they did later on? Thanks!
---
On a private server I had a priest who would just follow me around healing me lol.
---
It sounds like they're mostly listening to us, and that's what I appreciates about ya blizzard.
---
Can you share this spec?
---
Well aromatic mentions it is this shitty trend that all the classic WoW Youtubers are following and I agree. Comparing it to you doing you job is insincere.  It's the difference between you doing the bare minimum, being total shit at your job, and you actually giving a shit and putting some effort into what you do
---
It‚Äôs confusing since it would be strange to release the 1.12 Rank 14 weapons without the caster weapons. But at the same time, they didn‚Äôt technically release them until Naxx. It‚Äôs a pretty ambiguous case so it‚Äôll be interesting to see what they end up doing. I‚Äôd be surprised if they didn‚Äôt release the caster weapons in phase 2 but according to this update they will be releasing them in phase 5/6. We‚Äôll see what happens. Releasing them in phase 5/6 is the correct thing to do imo.
---
There's no shortage of those in online games

From NE start to arriving in Dun Morogh for the first time, it takes about 26 minutes.
---
A dangerous statement to make on a cloistered subreddit, frankly. And for some good reason, the #nochanges, #slipperyslope mentality exists partially for realistic fear of screwing things up after all. Retail is a good case study of broken design. Anyway, it's why I want them to talk about servers. I'd much prefer if they kept a purist/progressive option, with the latter being an old school runescape style voting system that a small pool of devs can put time into a year after release or so. 
---
I loved my Troll Enhancement Shaman (Best of both worlds, huh) in 2005. But initially people didn't realize how much of a burden they were. How generally useless it is to have them "off-tank" dungeons because their Earth Shocks or Windfury procs would pull aggro like crazy. Most people didn't use damage meters back then. Suffice to say by the time I got to raiding, that mentality started killing that spec and discussing on vanilla forums about possible balance changes is very much 'vanilla' to me as well. Just because warriors, rogues, mages got the good roll of the dice in 1.12 didn't mean Blizzard was done balancing. As evident by the TBC pre-patch and massive improvements in general balance there (with exceptions). 
---
It's just a shame that a lot of people prefer keeping a lot of classes in a stasis of crap. I get it, there's genuine concern over talking about *any* changes. It *could* be a major issue. So yeah, I hope they make it an option for the future when people pick their servers. It won't cost them any actual work for a year or two until they want to implement it, gives people a good headsup that hey, there might be some changes in a few years. Like if after a year they give the option to vote for dual wielding for Enhancement Shamans or Attack Power scaling on Consecration for Ret Paladins, throw them a tiny bone, I'd love that. 
---
Until then I'll just play Rogue I suppose.
---
That‚Äôs beautiful!
---
You want Sanctity Aura instead of Imp Ret Aura. 10% extra damage on Seal of Command is huge. You will never use another aura aside from Sanctity in PvP. Maaaaaaaybe frost resist when you duel a Mage.
---
Sure, you can stay ignorant to the idea of how everything works and don't give a shit about how you could get more fun out of the same content if it was made properly.
---
Dude, it was a raid strategy, something cooked up by our raid leaders.  Now remember, \*creek\* we were going into MC when no add-ons, no strategies, no DBM's were available.  So if they felt it was faster to die to the imps and run back, that's what we did. :)
---
I think there should be at least one rp-pvp server at launch. Everyone needs to sign the petition.
---
Here‚Äôs the link :        http://chng.it/LYyhpzF7Lg
---
And why would my answer imply I support Account Sharing?
---
Account Sharing won't happen in Classic for a Guildbank like you see it on Privateservers.
---
Second Accounts will cost real money each Month and I doubt some people with a Battle.net Account they have since a decade with all their personal information like real name, actual living adress, saved payment options &amp; co, would actually give anyone else access to that account, except possibly their reallife spouse.
---
But even then, it's on their own risk and it's against Blizzards rules anyways, and even more so punished compared to what happens on Privatsevers.
---
Also Guild banks don't need to be shared in the first place, I always laugh at guilds on privateservers that do this. When you need something from the Guildbank, then freaking wait until the person owning the Account comes online.
---
Not a single situation justifies such sharing between officers. It's not only against the rules as already explained, it's also a huge risk to lose everything in the Guildbank by being ninja looted.
---
Active Guilds will have active Guildmasters, and they'll be most likely be online every day for atleast 2 hours or more. And if they're online on different hours, write them an ingame mail what you need from the Guildbank.
---
Oh by the way, not to mention the whole abuse of the Guildbank system like on Retail. People making multiple Alts with their own personal dead guilds, just to have even more bank space.
---
Which would also decrease the demand for and the value of Bags.
---
Why would people want Travelers Bags on Bank Alts or even Onyxia Bags on their Mains, when they can have unlimited amount of Space by just doing 9 Alts with their own Guild and a few Bank Tabs.
---
Completly game changing factors you're not thinking about.
---
Played Cata for a minute and then left as soon as I felt cancer growing inside my brain.  
---
The only regret I have is leveling my character to 85.
---
Everything has it's flaws to be sure. But damn was it fun.
---
I cleared it....in BC..... after wiping way too much... with a 30 person group....a week before the wrath pre patch
---
Lol how is that a straw man
---
That's probably the best way to do it. For like half of the items in vanilla, the first iteration was garbage. Having played on pservers with patch-specific item stats, it just limits the initial pool of items to such an extent that every other boss you kill drops nothing usable for any class. T1 was dogshit for most classes, like [hilariously useless.](https://i.imgur.com/9wFWtZf.png)
---
However, they still haven't been clear about PvP gear, have they? The blue set had two completely separate versions, the latter of which wasn't added until patch 1.11. Meanwhile, the epic set has only one version and the stats on the items get updated. Blizzard's plans imply that we'll have only the crappy level 58 blue PvP set at the start, but also the insane upgraded epic set that rivals T2.5 but becomes available before BWL even opens.
---
This video has been de-monetized for Copyright Infringement.
---
Exactly, im against crossrealm, but battlegroups are okay, its not as bad as some ppl here make it out to be you still get to know everyone eventually
---
If I may be so blunt, you want to get wand specialization first before anything. 
---
Then going Spirit Tap and imp. SWP is what I'd do too.
---
Generally I will from here on go on to stay in HOLY until 45 at which point I respec into Shadow.
---
So does this mean those overpowered greens with pure spellpower damage won‚Äôt be added until naxx?
---
My idea for a Holy raiding build, "Tanks Best Friend".
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/BDzM9jADz9AdAA
---
Improved Devotion and Sanctuary for the tanks! You're not cornered in to the tank group, either (although those are both great for 5-mans) since you have BoK and Improved Concentration.
---
One RP-PvP server per region doesn't seem like it would dilute the realm lists.
---
And I hope by "expand as needed" he means "we'll have hardware and back end systems staged and ready to flip the switch on, so we can turn bring them up immediately to meet demand," instead of some bullshit like "we're working on bring up more realms but it's going to take a while because demand was higher than we expected," and then taking six months to actually do anything about it.
---
Honestly at this point the best thing they can do is just keep this guy as far away from Classic as possible and let him focus on working his magic with retail. The Classic team seems to be knocking it out of the park with no help from him.
---
No, I mean my guild killed Ragnaros for a year and we saw one BRE drop. 
---
When Phase 3 starts a few months in no guild is going to have "a bunch of 1.12 BRE's" because it has a very low chance of dropping. They'd be lucky to even have 1 and extremely lucky to have 2.
---
BRE was buffed in 1.10, not 1.12, so by the time AQ comes out the tiny handful of BRE's in the raid will be just as good as it was back when the raid came out anyway.
---
I meant, as in if Blizzard plans to do any changes to the 1.12 state. It has very strong farming methods. I'm not against them, I could see the market regulating itself with time. Gold will have less value, but that will be the case anyway. Farming essential mats will always be necessary/viable, so with more gold availabe, people would charge more for stuff and that's pretty much it.
---
LoL I‚Äôm not looking for fun in my content I‚Äôm looking for entertainment and the youtubers oppinions. But it‚Äôs cool apparently I‚Äôm ignorant for enjoying what I enjoy.
---
How would they make raid bosses harder though? Increase their white damage and hp? Doesnt sound like that would make it more fun or harder, just closer to raidfinder where one boss takes 10 mins to kill and u cant wipe.
---
Don't skill anticipation for leveling m8
---
i will level my rogue alt as a sub-optimal split spec most likely.
---
I'm thinkin of getting 10 points in combat to start, getting the +hit% then going 10 in sub for imp stealth speed and effectiveness.
---
After that I haven't decided, but I'll likely get some points in Assn for the passive boosts to crit and S&amp;D and then fill out sub until I feel like respeccing.
---
Just find it fun to have the boost to stealth while leveling on a PvP server and pickpocketing a lot.
---
2 months game card locks you in for 2 months. A pay by the month subscription with a credit card doesn't force you to play the game for 2 months to get the full value; you can cancel after 1 month. How was that hard to understand?
---
True
---
Typical! Left wing, Big Government, Fascist, Nazi, uhhh ummm Nazi!, Fascist, Big Government, Left Wing, TYRANTS!!!

Because they're acting like that's our argument but it's not. And the spirit agility on warrior gear is an easier won argument than what we're really talking about. Like all the shit in dungeons that were garbage and became bis.
---
Quit during wrath, beginning of the end, the signs were there
---
This is pretty close to my plan as well. Sub to me feels more "rogue-like" than Combat.
---
Same. I want to RP for immersion. no-PvP destroys that.
---
Nice! I just realized you said *FROM* NE zone not *TO*, but still amazingly useful!
---
Wow vanilla wiki usually tells you if an item was added at a later patch.
---
Fx perdition blade off ragnaros wasn't added before 1.4 (along with a ton of other rag loot) https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Perdition%27s_Blade
---
That's a level 60 spec, you dont really need to worry about leveling at that point.
---
&gt;Efficiency aside
---
If you dont care about efficiency then just about anything works, not very good, but it works
---
Sub optimal can be fun and, if you can get it to do something wonky. It might even be good. Not good as in best but, good as in unplayed against and their fore hard to defend.
---
hell yeah
---
Ret needs a weapon based on demand damage button. It's comical how bad that spec is for a 'melee' class. Prot paladins need some way of restoring mana during a fight, a taunt, slightly buffed holy shield so they can get crits off the table which means they need a talent rework to remove reliance on being crit. Balance needs mana reworks so they can actually sustain a bit during fights. Feral needs better itemization, put the wolfshead proc on a libram for dps. Enhancement just needs general purpose buffs maybe reducing the cooldown on stormstrike. Elemental I've never played in vanilla, so I'd have to bow to a more experienced player.
---
I'd also like to see buffs to Warlocks and especially hunters.  Shadow needs just a tiny nudge and they are probably ok.
---
Played up through Wrath, stayed for first raid tier cata, quit and came back for end of Cata and a few weeks of Pandaria and never went back. Played FFXIV at that time and now currently since.
---
Remember this when reminiscing about vanilla raiding.  The REAL challenge was herding 40 people and getting them to understand an explanation of the plan, let alone actually executing it.
---
tbh it sounds more like you're trying to think of reasons for something you already believe. If you really wanna research something then reverse that and assume you have no idea what the reason is until you're looked at the numbers  
---
and yeah fyi my mom is also a huge liberal and I grew up atheist so, still no match
---
Hello Hitler.
---
Silencing warriors is fun
---
&gt;  Again there's shades of grey you seem to want to ignore.
---
There literally isn't, if you think there are then you need to look up what the word correct means.
---
Appreciate the response, but I think they underestimate the demand here. 
---
I also think a lot of returning players are eyeing RP-PVP because they want, if not not mature, a calmer experience in general. Not having the general chat spammed with dead memes/thunderfury is worth a lot to a lot of people. 
---
On RP realms, you‚Äôre expected to not ruin the experience for others, even if you don‚Äôt RP, and those realms were somewhat of a safe haven for many in vanilla.
---
Wouldn't be Youtube without this.
---
I would wear anything that's plate with intellect and stamina. Even if that means a dungeon blue instead of a cloth epic that I might wear in raids. You're going to cast Holy Light in PvP, which tends to heal for a big percentage of someone's health even without any bonus healing. The mana pool from intellect + survivability from stam and armor would probably help more than bonus healing.
---
Cringe post
---
When I was 14 I convinced my mom to try it out and make a character, but she didn't want to kill anything so she made a priest just to heal people.
---
Careful, respecting costs more each time you do it up to a cap of 50g, which is a lot .. it comes down over time but not by much
---
the journey is the goal. When you cleared everything and are full gear and every1 else stops coming online its not fun anymore. Alot of ppl reroll servers before even nax comes out on private servers
---
&gt;It has 11 dps which is really good and if it exists I am going to get it but 5 talents for a 25% increase nets you a whopping 2.5 dps.... that isn't nearly as efficient as the 2 extra ticks to SWP for only 2 talents or the +spell crit of holy spec.  NOW later on I completely agree this scales beautiful with some of the 30+ wands but rushing it early actually seems like a net loss to me IMO.
---
you can't really say 44 is exactly middle, cos xp that you get from quests scales up aswell, and at high levels (55+) you start doing juicy (in terms of how much xp they give) endgame dungeon quests, and chains. like attunements, brd key quest, in dreams, lbrs quests, brd quests etc. they all reward abnormal amount of xp.
---
ppl usually measured 44 by joanas times, but he leveled alone, cos he was so far ahead of everyone, so no these juicy xp for him. So from my experiecnce last levels closing at 60, arent really that hard. despite them having a ton of xp in a level.
---
also after 40 you get a mount, so traveling goes much faster aswell. which speed up things quite drastically, abit compensating that level require more xp.
---
No holy fire?
---
My parents we're adamantly against this game when I first pleaded them to buy it for me. They could not understand why in the world a video game would require a subscription. I begged and begged them and tried everything in my 13 year old power to get them to pay for it-- to no avail.
---
I was not going to take no for an answer and I was absolutely going to play this with all of my friends -- bottom fucking line. 
---
So I decided to sell gum at school. My local grocery store sold these [4 pack of bubblicious](https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/3833a48b-9e32-4d97-9eaf-babdc45182af_1.f78f341db44653ba4cbed84413b36fc5.jpeg?odnHeight=450&amp;odnWidth=450&amp;odnBg=FFFFFF) for $1, and I would sell each stick for $1, making 300% profit. I funded WoW for YEARS without my parents paying a cent. They actually encouraged it, and would drive me to the grocery store to stock up. Would ride my bike to Gamestop once a month to buy these suckers. 
---
Definitely my proudest entrepreneurial venture.

Don't mind 1-50 so much, but 50-60 is fucking painful. That is a grind I do not look forward to.
---
Nah you can actually get a lot of stuff super cheap on a fresh server, if you're looking before the first large-ish bunch of levelers hits the cap and starts throwing gold around.
---
The flipside of this is that anything you buy is cutting into your skill/mount fund, so you are probably going to want to be frugal anyway. But in general the prices on anything people are going to come across while leveling (like leather, cloth, herbs, BOE greens, etc) is going to start low, then go up (and then down again as demand slows).

No, but casual raids will seldom weed out the bad people, you know. So while bad casuals is only a subset of the larger group of casuals as a whole, you're will always be dragging some fraction of bad casuals along on your raid night, because casual raids don't have a reliable mechanism for excluding bad players.
---
While you could in theory have a guild that had only a casual time commitment on the part of the raiders, but took a super elitist approach to recruitment, with applications and logs and trial runs and all that jazz, I've never seen something like that. And that's the way you avoid bringing too many bad players along, be they casual or no.
---
And since some fraction of their raiders are bad, they will wipe, and maybe even fail to complete raids. This will increase repairs, and it'll either make people stop using consumables, or make it way more expensive, and after a certain point, you end up having spent more time and gold (which is just a measure of time spent preparing out of raids) than you would have in a more elitist guild.
---
This is very true
---
most people didnt farm these raids for 3 years. most people didn't even raid. this stuff was still very hard for a lot of guilds at the end of vanilla. my server had maybe one naxx guild on alliance, everyone else was stuck in MC/ZG/AQ20 with the best couple guilds in BWL. they weren't farming these raids either, they were beating their heads against them. my guild couldn't kill onyxia over like the last year of vanilla, and we didn't kill her until TBC talents came. we were one of the better guilds on the server too.
---
it seems like everyone is talking about the private server experience, or perhaps the pretty rare high end raiding guild experience.
---
Hi, /u/FlashySnood
---
I definitely agree, there needs to be a queue protection. Servers with faction imbalance can have pretty horendous queue times.
---
Level 10 rogue gets sprint. It's the only class that gets a movement increasing ability below level 20.
---
If you're not just going to use a level 1 warrior then level 10 rogue is imo your most efficient option. (As a bonus, you can twink it out with 100% dodge or whatever to flex on people in front of the AH.)
---
Yeah warriors and priests are my favorite classes, but you do a good job reminding me of how difficult a warrior is. I think I may level the priest first and the  the warrior so I have money for the warrior
---
Wake me up when it‚Äôs the release date announcement.
---
Inc 45 min vid from tips out fraud
---
I would just have a low level bank alt in each city and level one up to 5 at some point to be your DE bot and maybe level the others up to 35 for profession cooldowns somewhere down the line,
---
for locks its for sure death coil at 42. warriors id have to say sweeping strikes, whirlwind, and recklessness. druid have kitty bear and cheetah form.
---
I want to be known as a reliable and great performing healer. Not sure about Priest/Pally/Druid yet. 
---
Similar experience for me actually. I was one of the top 5 holy paladins in TBC on my server, but I had strict parents and a curfew lol since I was in HS. So my team started raiding around 8 to 10, paused for like 30-40 while I pretended to sleep, then I would toss a light blanket over me and my monitor so the light wouldnt show under my room door and get me in trouble lol. It also meant I couldnt voice chat during the second half of the raid.
---
I'm gonna have to look into this
---
Of course the completed build is level 60, but it's not impossible to see the order of progression. Would probably pick up Hit/DW Spec from Combat first and then dive into Sub until Hemo and fill in the gaps from there.
---
Is that what you appreciate about Blizzard?
---
Which items?
---
Well, im pretty sure they said somewhere that vanilla wow will go on as long as retail wow goes on. So you are fine with sticking to classic wow, those servers will always be available. IF they were to continue and progress xpacs, im sure they will be on separate servers where u can transfer your vanilla character IF you choose to.
---
Luminary kilt is a leather green drop in early vanilla with int/Stam only that becomes a blue with 22 spell damage and similar stats.  Pretty substantial difference, but not necessarily absurdly broken.
---
The biggest impact is that casters will have many more options in early dungeons to get gear that is actually useful, and caster t0 gear will be even less attractive.  It‚Äôs fine, but it‚Äôs a different meta.
---
This will mean that the Marshal/Warlord gear will also be in its buffed state. 
---
I know that it's not something that a majority of each server will obtain, but with their current power-level, I fear that it's going to be way stronger than intended for those who obtain it early on.
---
You aren't helping mate, lol
---
Cool lean lists is great.  One RPPVP realm should be good then!
---
Looking forward to all my peeps from Emerald Dream and Ravenholdt reuniting!  (Buy Juliechants, Karlchants, and lets play!)
---
Play what you want to play. I don't know how an answer here will help you or which kind of answer you're looking for.
---
While they may be right that those changes weren't meant as catch-up, it doesn't change the fact that many of them ended up serving as catch-ups even if unintended. While I'm personally in favor of the solution they chose, I think the argument that the progressive changes to items did raise the average player power and essentially made the game easier is pretty solid.
---
Dual-wield for rogues at lvl 10 is a deal-breaker.
---
Thank you devs.   
---
[Please Consider Buffing Content Slightly to Compensate For 1.12]
---
I think this would probably end up with less health loss overall with Ghostly (so probably more efficient), but less OMG CRITS.
---
I have a Warlock item called Abyyss Shard which allows me to summon vw without mana or soul shard. In the updates they changed the item to only allow summon without mana. A warlock is worried...
---
It is true though. I think to be a good fit for a healer then you need to care more about the players than the mobs.
---
Interesting, I have heard the opposite.  Specifically, from here:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/5ahx31/ironfoe\_proc\_chance/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/5ahx31/ironfoe_proc_chance/)
---
"In all I attacked the mob 3,226 times with Ironfoe, and recieved 87 extra attack procs (counting the combatlog message "You gain 2 extra attacks from Fury of Forgewright." as a single proc). 42 of those attacks were partially blocked (but still did damage), 62 were dodged, 32 were parried, and none missed.
---
This would make the proc rate 2.70%, or 0.675 procs per minute. \[...\] This test was performed on the live WoW servers, under version 1.11.2"

I'm sad that they won't have an RP PVP server at launch. Because very few people are likely to spin up a new toon once they decide to open one.
---
RP PVP servers are the best wow experience.
---
Honestly, the whole heal as dps spec is workable until about SM. After 40, you‚Äôre gonna have a hard time without a ton of dedicates healer gear and that takes up a lot of bag space. Im in the same boat, I‚Äôm thinking to level disc/holy with the mandatory 5 in spirit tap. Or if I go pally, go ret till like post STV, then do some kind of holy build.
---
We've reached the stage where Blizz could completely remove an entire class and the response would be "who cares, just give us a release date please"
---
Black rock eps
---
Tame pet, Aimed shot and feign death for hunters!

That's when blizz started making the game easy enough for retards. The start of making every class the same and the start of their subs dwindling.

i want to be that warlock that knows how to utilize everything in my kit. so often i see locks fearing mobs into more grps when they couldve put CoR on the mob and then reapply CoA or i see locks always forget to ss healer. i also wanna be that badass orc lock in t2 causing havoc chasing people down on my wolf.
---
A time lapse of people getting phased in.
---
There, ruined it for you.
---
Item stats changing is dumb. 
---
It‚Äôs shit game design when we know what the outcome will be. 
---
All items should be released in their 1.12 state. If the item wasn‚Äôt added till 1.10 don‚Äôt add till phase 5. Great.
---
The compromise I‚Äôd make with these item progression folks is to make the items which existed prior to 1.10 but were retuned at that time, is to just not have them in the game until they get retuned. If bre wasn‚Äôt retuned till 1.10‚Äìno bre in classic wow till phase 5. 
---
If no one used the poorly itemized untuned items, taking them out of the game completely would give an accurate pre tuning experience and not present the ‚Äúitem stats arbitrarily changing‚Äù problem. 
---
It‚Äôd also make those folks who are looking to make classic harder...a bit harder.
---
My end game is blacksmithing. By the time I learned how to really craft they'd removed naxx and all the blacksmithing patterns inside of it. My one and only goal is to get those patterns.

You underestimate the melee stacking. The drop is 1/100 but you're competing against 10 other dudes for it every time also. I don't mean to dissuade you but it's likely going to be a long term goal.

Also pretty sure he is already losing his mind if he thinks it's ok to lie to his wife for video game time
---
Dial it back about 20% there, super chief.
---
My only concern is how powerful the high rank PVP gear will be, particularly since it will be released in the phase before even BWL.
---
Yes it's unobtainable for most players by design (since ranking is based on being in the top percentiles of all players on the server), but it's still going to exist. People may feel pressured to attempt to get it since it's BiS for like 4 phases and stomps all over the tiers it's released with, but that journey promotes a very unhealthy playstyle. Especially with no BGs for a phase, mass camping lowbies and flight masters is going to be heavily incentivized for a certain crowd of people.
---
(And everyone that crowd interacts with will suffer the result.)
---
I had a friend who would sit in brill and send bags to all the lowbies she saw. And tallabim bananas. You know. In case they wanted a tallabim banana.
---
One of the most popular classes on Alliance, right after Warriors/Rogues/Mages. But Horde doesn't get them so they have a small population compared to other classes. Only Shaman have less.
---
Let's not discount the possibility that TipsOut has seen this guy post it before and that's where he got the information.
---
I despised panda land. I honestly don't even remember much about it besides wanting to put a bullet in my head from how terrible the accent was imo

i played alliance from classic to Wotlk, Horde from Cata to retail. Personally i like the alliance story more. the only horde story i like was in nagrand in BC. but to answer your question, you can easily enjoy both but one will always be better.
---
At least that's bannable.
---
FOR THE HORDE.
---

---
I hadn't considered the difficulties that might come with trying to get your hands on the so called Greater Magic Wand on launch day or shortly after.
---
You're nobody if you don't have haters Esfand. Keep the content coming and ignore the nay-sayers. This sub used to support the community and was all about CLASSIC. It's slowly sperging into a shittier retail subreddit that consists of pissing contests and nothing be negativity. 
---
**PUMP IT**
---
Sell of course, I've seen most of Classic back then so I'm not concerned about the raid visuals. It really is fine.
---
he did answer it further down: Ironfoe and Flurry Axe (for specific spell dmg ret spec that may or may not work on classic live if Blizz messes with spell coefficients).
---
So you want to level as sub, but you're dumping a bunch of points into combat first.
---
And just as you are about to get the really juicy combat talents like sword, spec, blade flurry, weapon expertise etc, you're saying screw that and dumping the rest of your points into the sub tree where you get next to nothing to help you with killing mobs.
---
It doesnt really matter to me how you chose to level, you do you. Just giving you something to think about
---
Remain Horde. Lok'tar Ogar
---
I can‚Äôt wait!
---
It‚Äòs not.
---
Bre? Forgive me.
---
Oh dang, RO was so much fun.
---
Makes sense. It‚Äôs a shame the T0 gear was itemized poorly, trying to complete those sets in 2005 were some of the best memories
---
&gt;no-PvP destroys that.
---
There has never not been pvp on wow?
---
I'm 100% certain it doesn't, because our guild recently mass-merged into a different one XD But nice try
---
It‚Äôs not a trend by choice was my point. YouTube‚Äôs algorithm incentivizes having the first video up that‚Äôs 10+ minutes, so that‚Äôs what you have to do if you want to create revenue. This idea that Esfand or other content creators should martyr themselves by releasing a video a day later is pretty absurd. These guys are just working within the system they have to work with, most of them would likely prefer it didn‚Äôt work this way.
---
hah!!!
---
[Relevant video](https://youtu.be/y8Dn6X2QIZg?t=379)
---
Riposte for rogues at level 20. Makes it a little less aids to solo level a rogue.
---
You should probably decide if you're going daggers or not. Honestly I'm not sure any daggers build works levelling, the dps hit would be really bad anytime you're solo. If you're ok with that, or you'll never be solo, I guess it doesn't matter, obviously you can still kill stuff it's just going to be pretty painful killing 30 tigers alone. Even if you do decide going daggers you probably should keep a slow sword or something to spam SS with when you have to.  
---
Hemo is a little off-meta but really is pretty good and perfectly viable lvl 40+, this isn't the build for it though.   
---
It seems very odd to build for dual wield spec with your build, it's not a great dps talent when you don't have a white damage focus spec. I'd bet putting those 5 points in malice would be a far better build dps wise.
---
No confirmation, but I believe it will stay true to Vanilla. Armor models were the same as in Vanilla during the demo but I couldn't verify with helmets as there was nothing available Helmet wise in the demo.
---
They said Burning Crusade. Oh fuck what's that blizzard? Burning Crusade Classic. Wait what, did you guys hear Blizzard is recreating BC expansion also. Oh shit must be true. BLUE POST SAID BC = BC Classic, duh.
---
Isn‚Äôt the world server fundamentally different to the instance server? Not only do you have 80+ right next to eachother (spamming 2-4x the abilities per person per second into the combat log as one did in classic) but you‚Äôve got everyone else on that continent. 
---
Instance servers distribute the load better. (For example, sometimes you‚Äôd be leveling and on kalimdor, and EK would go down and everyone in your guild in eastern kingdoms would log out at the same time). 
---
So who knows before bgs are introduced, maybe we see 120+ player raids on sw, if, org, kazzak. That could strain the system. But 20 guilds raiding over the same 6 prime time hours shouldn‚Äôt buckle the servers.
---
yea i remember when an entire 40 man raid waited on me to get home to start progression attempts at our first loatheb kill
---
I need 125M :/
---
A merciless ganker and corpse camper
---
Yeah I think most people don't remember that you are loot starved for the first month or so because EVERYONE is leveling lol.  Very few people are going to stop leveling to craft gear.
---
I am not saying it won't be available but I think banking on anything player made is a risky decision.
---
Dank, clarity is good.
---
I got the same problem but reversed. Might be fun playing from the other side, but fear of regret once i hit 60 is real.
---
I played all vanilla raided fairly hardcore into TBC. I burnt out while pushing through sunwell plateau. Came back for wrath, but never joined a guild because of lfr. After awhile I grew bored of daily quests and the lfg/lfr and cancelled my subscription.
---
Came back for Cata and leveled a few of my alts to max. I had no idea what was going on and the end game raid content was ridiculous. There was no need to learn the fight, you just kind of attacked whatever. I don't recall any trash pulling. I got a pretty sweat 2h sword that would spawn a tentacle every so often out of it, but I quite shortly after as it was just do your dailies and lfr. So basically the same idea as wrath.  
---
I briefly tried MoP and hated what they did to the talents / skills and never looked back.
---
Do you know the time per level sheet I‚Äôm talking about that was posted roughly a week ago? I can‚Äôt find it...  it wasn‚Äôt the joanas one either
---
In fairy tales.
---
In the real world, in the war against gold sellers, the only thing that has ever worked was making legitimate gold cheaper and safer.
---
It's like drugs, or prohibition alcohol. Ban it, and there's a black market demand, that never goes away.
---
I know that, I played a Shadowpriest myself. The healing of a dedicated shadowpriest is enough to counteract life tapping easily. In fact a Shadowpriest can heal quite a good amount just by dealing damage. The average damage of a shadow is statistically about 60-70% of a mage/warlock and his healing is that amount * 20% * any group member that is not full health.
---
Well first of all it's not literally 1/100, even if the droprate is 1%, if the boss drops more than 1 item per kill. On private servers it's insane droprate, on retail it's 5%. It's not literally going to be 10 guys either, it's going to be the 5 other DPS warriors because they aren't going to give it to tank mainspecs and I'm not playing alliance, and assuming a 5% drop chance, that's not bad odds at all to see a BRE every week when the boss drops multiple items per kill on the purple drop table. Also I play Vanilla WoW and OSRS, I have no aversion to 6-24 month long goals nor do i expect this to be guaranteed or fast :p
---
I think Esfand is a great content creator, one of the few who actually puts out content cause he loves the game, and cause he actually is knowledgeable and knows what he's talking about. 
---
Super happy he has become more of a face for the classic community than Asmongold. No disrespect to that dude, but whenever he talks he doesn't seem sure of what he actually wants himself and he uses terminology like "we" and "us" way too much implying that the whole classic community wants what he also wants. Esfand does a better job of being more measured, acknowledging he may be wrong or that others have different opinions, and just being better at communicating. 
---
Dude really deserves the following he's got.
---
Pretty much! I view combat as basically a warrior spec. I want to actually use stealth (not just for escaping). I'm only picking up the flat DPS increases in combat because it's just going to make me do more damage in the playstyle that I actually prefer.
---
The procs proccing procs behavior was fixed relatively early in vanilla's patch cycle. A shaman with iron foe and hand of justice doing a screenful of attacks on a particularly lucky roll probably got it nerfed XD
---
Everyone always mentions MC as if it was ever difficult to begin with.
---
With the exception of early patches of Vanilla and lack of knowledge there, it was always a faceroll.
---
I feel like BWL and ZG will still be a struggle for
---
the general population and Huhuran+ in AQ40 is still going to be a major roadblock for most guilds.
---
The itemization may affect early Classic slightly but not enough to warrant the confusion of progressive itemization and the strange concept
---
of collecting items because they will get buffed in 6-12 months.
---
A ret pally can always be available but still don‚Äôt get a spot in a hardcore raid
---
Seems like tight groups of friends could easily abuse that system tho. More easily than the DKP system at least.
---
Probably a healer. They have the best idea of what's going on during a fight and can pre mark for the next trash pull without much difficulty.

A little but but there's always going to be a bottleneck with leveling somewhere. A lot of people wont know what they are for sure playing yet and want to experiment with classes, a lot of people will be slow levelers anyways, and a lot will try and make those big community events. While it will be more crowded than the sharded zones it wont be 400 people entering westfall at the same time
---
\&gt;They're a pure specialist at healing...Purity doesn't exist.
---
Pick one?
---
Does it actually have an effect on warriors in Vanilla? It's been so long, I can't remember if it prevented them from using any of their abilities :P
---
Yeah the guy went hard on his theorycrafting! We'll see how viable it is when it comes around. Yeah, I thought the aimed shot first made sense for practicing weaving pre level 60. Glad you found it useful
---
Rets DPS significantly worse while holy heals significantly better than resto. Rets utility is all spec independant while only feral druids have access to LotP. Also almost all fights, save the last two in each raid with more than 2, before AQ are so short that mana potions can sustain powershifting. Ferals can also gimp their DPS a bit and build a tree that includes the must-have tank talents so they can do both, albeit with somewhat worse DPS, which can potentially save some respec costs. Unless the ret is really fucking decked out, being at least part melee they scale very well with gear, I consider them on par with boomkins.
---
I'm pretty sure /world is not a thing?
---
It's scary if they think they can use the launch from 2004 as a base for 2019 launch.
---
The interest to play will be huge day 1 (millions of people).
---
Sorry but what means ‚ÄûBRE‚Äú?
---
The Shaman experience is pretty similar. I think both classes had some artificial limitations placed on them because Blizzard didn't want to see too much difference between the factions. Those problems weren't solved until tBC.
---
Although my experience on private servers showed me that people are a LOT more open to hybrids than they used to be. If you really want to play a Ret or a Prot Paladin this time around, then you will be able to make it work - but you will still have to build out your healing set in addition to your Ret and Prot sets of gear.
---
For at least a few years, there was a reading comprehension question on the PSAT that included the word Eviscerate
---
&gt; Why is it so hard to ban gold seller accounts?????
---
Because they use stolen CCs/stolen accounts to spam.
---
I want this as a wallpaper! So perfect
---
I just want to have a lot of friendly green banter. Not so concerned with raiding or power leveling
---
Would be a good time for new experiences so go for it!
---
Hehe you are talking with an oldtimer here! ;)
---
I do have the privilege of possibly starting off with a rather big group of friends, so I might get to level enchanting and tailoring along the road to 60 but we will see how that goes. 
---
As for optimization; in this light picking up the wand spec a little latter might be the more optimal solution after all.
---
Really? Which ones? I'm genuinely curious.
---
teleport for mages.
---
It is a pipe dream but I'd like to bang the gong.
---
&gt; Account Sharing won't happen in Classic
---
ok bro
---
It's not hard to put restrictions on a guild bank to make it a healthy addition to vanilla, literally no one suggests copy/pasting the system from retail. Just facilitate the same thing you have with a clunky bank alt - bam your only criticism is defeated just like that.
---
Making running a guild more of a chore, in an arbitrary faction, only hurts the game
---
If they had the resources to put the gbank in vanilla, they would have, because it makes sense to facilitate the needs of a guild.
---
Hint: they didn't.
---
I might
---
I won't normally be solo, but it's not outside of possibility. I'm more interested in keeping the class fantasy of stealthy gameplay than anything, and daggers seem to fit that best.
---
You make a great point about DW Spec and going Malice actually makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the feedback!
---
theres videos of it, they all have anathema and some epics from bwl/mc or pvp blues.
---
maybe its possible as pre raid bis, but i doubt i.  dont think its as easy as lock or hunter mara unfortunately...
---
Don't pay too much attention to the details. The point I'm trying to get across is that this affects everyone on some level or another negatively.
---
cool. will have to check when i resub eventually.
---
I agree with you. At least, I can speak of myself; I will pick skinning and LW for my rogue char and I will be selling just a couple of silver more than vendor my crafted gear so everyone can level up faster. Plus, I will be selling my gear near inns sometimes, to save some silver from AH deposit fees
---
Pretty sure there are pve servers.
---
Hunter doesn't have an easy rotation
---
Everytime i go alliance on private servers i want to go back to horde. I always miss horde. Horde is just my home. I play trolls and hate undead tho. But I wish I felt the same way with the alliance so i could play paladin, which doesn't make sense.
---
Dangit :(

Rofl, I knew someone was going to say that. There were also PVP servers. I didn't say there was only PVP.
---
Nice!  Same here.  I started in the WoW beta and started day 1.  Oh man was STV and Tanaris a shit show on my server lol.
---
I am jealous all my old guildies have moved on with their lives and have no interest this time around =/
---
I think for what you want to do with your build, it works, but I would suggest taking the 2 points out of improved wisdom and putting them into Unyielding Faith for 10% fear and disorient protection.  
---
The reason for this, is because there's likely going to be someone else in your raid who has improved wisdom and with you having Sanctuary and Kings, you're likely going to be buffing those two and won't be on Wisdom duty, so having that 10% chance to resist a fear if you're in a bad spot or something on some fights. Say Onyxia, Magmadar, Nefarian, etc. I think that would be better. Of course, there's times when fears are avoidable, but there are times when they're not. And lets say you resist a fear, and then you can spam cleanse to cleanse fears off of melee DPS or something. that's really valuable!

You're right, we should just encourage this behavior. Hey, you a big fan of loot boxes and Diablo Immortal btw?
---
It should also move every time someone completes that step of the quest.
---
No, they just sit their butts the gy until they give up and leave the bg lol
---
In my opinion this is actually a true ‚Äûno changes‚Äú option. Because to me, knowing what will happen to the stats of an item in the future is a huge change.
---
But that's exactly what the said last update on itemisation. This changed nothing and gave us no new insights.
---
there is quality content and there is effortless shit which floods youtube
---
Normally I see it used on warriors to stop them charging.
---
Except for Darnassus and Thunder Bluff :(
---
Are you using pserver numbers for feral dps?
---
I loved every second of it, the Van Dame Machine gun was hilarious and unexpected, I've never heard of this dude before but I hope he make more videos!
---
There is a trick to going the other direction also.  There's a cliff to climb near the Gnomer entrance that is a VERY easy climb (no actual wall jumping iirc) then you just suicide off the cliff and rezz at the spirit rezzer and swim into Menethil.  If you google something like "menethil wetlands skip" or some such, you'll find a couple of youtube videos explaining it.
---
&gt;you need to fuck around a lot to get the five stacks, and it's not so good in BGs where you can't pull a low-level mob and sit down to let it crit you for stacks.
---
Sit-critting is not going to give you Reckoning stacks in Classic.
---
Or you could just not watch it if it bothers you that much.

What I hate about the progressive itemization solution to this problem is that items like BRE will be considered pretty shitty, but they will still have the extremely high value to players as if they had the new stats. While other great weapons are available by the time BRE becomes great, you'd be a moron not to try to pick it up even if you don't need it in it's current form. I feel like the entire premise of acquiring loot becomes warped because the value or usefulness of a drop isn't necessarily tied to the stats you see when it drops anymore.
---
Agreed. I feel a bit bad for him with this wait because there‚Äôs really not much more to cover but I want him to keep making more content.
---
Rumbling
---
Thanks for the explanation! It's hard to see the benefits from some of these things just from a talent calculator...
---
&gt;And how are you going to judge what's better 1% hit or 12 agility?
---
By equipping the item and hitting a bunch of stuff.   If stuff dies faster and I live longer that item is better. 
---
How do you think the people who released bis lists did it?
---
&gt;&gt; No. Don't tell others how to play the game "correctly", that's a completely subjective thing.
---
&gt;It's not though, if you're doing something wrong you're not doing it correctly, that's objectively true.
---
Again in your subjective opinion you think it's wrong.  That doesn't make it wrong.
---
they wont be added? that was TBC patch
---
It's good for PVP, especially a Holy-Reckoning build. Stack some 'chance-to-hit' proc items like Darkmoon Card: Maelstrom, Hand of Justice, Shadow Oil, Lifesteal weapon enchant, etc.
---
As mentioned in the post, I know it's not the suggested. But what is the trade off?
---
At the 2018 Blizzcon Ion said there wont be cross-realms BGs.
---
You needed 25 honorable kills to be factored into the ranking calculations, after that it's 100% dependant on how much honor everyone else on your faction has.
---
Yes, they do.  The Shmight's Shmope core has negative values for both items...confirmed as recently as like, idk this past lockout.
---
I actually argue that healers are the worst for leading raids. The reason being that their focus is naturally drawn to raid frames rather than the field.  
---
The difference of course between any class raid leading isn't huge.
---
I love throwing a heal or killing a mob when I see another player overwhelmed.
---
This would be my answer as well. I've seen rogues excel in the position of raid lead also.  
---
The class with the least personal responsibility is going to be free to focus brain power towards on-the-fly raid leading.
---
Yup, honestly the Classic team is basically everything that I hoped for so far.
---
Really hope they decide to go the route of tuning content to be just a little more difficult for the 1.12 itemization and balance too. Though not too much hopefully, since I think it's still good to have room for a handful of memespecs in MC/BWL at the leas, otherwise they'll end up even more unplayable.
---
And that's with me not even wanting to play memespecs myself.
---
Are you an armchair player or do you actually parse?  You sound like someone who raids in a guild where furies do equal damage to warlocks when you speak like this.  Don't take my word for it, go look at legacy.
---
In the end we are all humans though, even if we are now 25+ year old humans.
---
Saying that spec and consumables should have a low priority is one thing, but how do you keep those other 20+ people happy who DO come fully prepared so the raid succeeds? Who accept that their PVP abilties are gimped because PVE and Raids come first? That they can't solo as much content or farm as effectively because the raid spec has priority? How do you tell them that the other half of the raid didn't even bring potions?
---
I mean as long as all is going well I see no frictions, but I don't think the mood will stay positive after the fifth wipe.
---
Sorry noob here don‚Äôt get it
---
It will not work in Classic. It was patched by 1.12 back in Vanilla. Also, sit crits did not proc Redoubt in the demo a while back.
---
Oh, you're going to Teldrassil?  
---
https://youtu.be/v5sjX0tdHHY
---
This skip has potential in Classic.  
---
Works on all the private servers (same terrain)  
---
I will test it tomorrow in the alpha client.
---
bonereavers edge with its 1.12.1 stats is the strongest 2h in the game dps wise, not even MoM from kel'thuzard can compete, and bonereavers drops from molten core, it's things like this that make me feel sketchy about 1.12.1 stats from start
---
I dont think that it has that of big following, but your number might be true for a short period of time, since it only require an active subscription, so lot of people might try it, mess a few levels and back to retail.
---
twinking 39 is endgame for our guild, see ya in vietnam!
---
Gonna resort to strawmans now? I was simply explaining why these content creators have to do this, and why your barking up the wrong tree.
---
Okay, this works, thank you
---
An argument can be made that reading the post word for word is just filler content, I mean we can all read for ourselves can't we? A better use of time would be discussing personal views on the topic, how it might impact the launch of Classic WoW etc.
---
ah snap thanks! :D
---
And you really had to share it with reddit to gain some sweet karma.
---
The turn the fricken frogs gay made me pee a little, God damn it I'm at work!
---
And according to Blizzard's wording, the R10 blue set will be the crappy level 58 version which is nearly useless when all other items have their 1.12 stats. The issue is that the blue PvP set's update consisted of new items with different names which, according to Blizzard's plans, means those aren't added until 1.11 when they originally became available.
---
You can still play it. Plenty of guilds will want a shadowpriest, but be prepared to be the buffbot for warlocks with the occasional use of vampiric touch.
---
Oh god or when a Warlock you've beaten down to single digit percentage of HP tries to Fear you so they can bandage or whatever and they see those big "RESIST" letters on their screen. It pleases me SO MUCH
---
&gt; By equipping the item and hitting a bunch of stuff. If stuff dies faster and I live longer that item is better.
---
You find looking stuff up boring, but you literally have thousands of hours to stand in front of mobs attacking them and noting down data in order to figure out which stats are better?
---
&gt; How do you think the people who released bis lists did it?
---
We literally had GMs tell us how hit tables worked, you knew that right?
---
Assuming one could get decent dungeon or MC gear, does pally still stay quite ahead in this regard? Or can you spec deeper feral and still heal dungeons and other content ok and then do a lot more damage in pvp with feral spec?
---
Where does it come from that Retail is roflstomp?
---
&gt; We're not
---
If you're not then how do you know about the content you're whining about?
---
RIP
---
&gt;established narrative
---
We are talking about something that can be easily proven with math. There's no narrative here. Spriest dps is just objectively bad when compared to other classes.
---
Was it? I honestly have no idea. I just remember them being BIS Wands and going for hundreds of gold
---
Nothing. There is too much content. Everyone stop. Do something actually productive.
---
Assuming their DPS is the same, I'm still pretty confident in the conclusion that ferals &gt; ret, mostly because holy &gt; resto (assuming there's at least 2 druids) plus the spec independant utility argument. If you've got a healer to spare and you're choosing between a pala going ret or a druid going feral, I don't see why you wouldn't choose the LotP+stronger healer option.
---
I 100% agree it‚Äôs too bad YouTube forces these creators down the release it first and make sure it‚Äôs 10 minutes route.
---
&gt; nor do i expect this to be guaranteed or fast :p
---
that's all I wanted to make sure of
---
meh, enjoy watching more of these dogshit videos

---
Wow, that is pretty amazing! That looks incredibly fast and easy, saving this for Classic :)
---
Because I've skimmed through one of them.
---
&gt;"we'll have plenty of extra hardware and back end systems staged and ready to flip the switch on, so we can bring them up immediately to meet demand," 
---
This is how all of this works now, it's not quite as simple as flipping a switch, but it's honestly not that far off.
---
&gt;"we're working on bringing up more realms but it's going to take a while because demand was higher than we expected," and then taking six months to actually do anything about it.
---
This is not the way it works, there is no worry about this.  In 04 Blizz had actual physical servers in a data center they owned, that is all gone, it is much easier now to turn up, turn down, and merge servers than it was back then, all of the technology behind the scene is totally different.
---
\[This\]([https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/AQwEDfEMEATwxgMR](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/AQwEDfEMEATwxgMR)) is my reference build that I keep coming back to, and tweak variations on the theme.
---
I really want a Setup build though, so I mix and match a few points.  I am not sold on the 10% to crit from daggers+Malice.  Since I can get crit from gear, I like to put the points into other things I can't get from gear (like Setup + Heightened Senses).  I'm not sold on Imp Sap, because it's not 100%, and if it's not 100%, I don't know that I want the risk of it failing.  I'd rather assume it will always just fail and spend the three points somewhere better.
---
But this one is a:  Ambush+Vanish+Ambush+Prep+Vanish+Ambush build...
---
Me that kind of rogue.
---
From 10 defense you get about 0.40% to the player's chance to be [Missed](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Miss), to [Dodge](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Dodge), and to [Parry](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Parry).   
---
The "trade off" is 5% block and 100% chance to get a +1 rage. And further down the tree you will miss out on: +1 block when you block, and longer duration of the buff.   
---
The defense skill is mostly worth to get "extra" defense you miss from your gear. Not worth speccing into unless you need it.
---
&gt; -15% stats on a raid boss sounds pretty good, no?
---
Demo shout can remove 100% boss AP, making it redundant, even if part of their ap comes from strength and bosses have base crit and dodge chance so I doubt they have any agility to reduce.
---
Nigga that shit changed every release from Warcraft Orcs and Humans
---
Alright mate. Go on and use your passive aggressiveness somewhere else.
---
To this day I am still looking for the sounds verycoolguy uses.
---
The selfish part of me is glad for the OP gear, I won't have the time I did in 2005, so it will be nice to roflstomp most content.    
---
 Buuuut, I think not retuning content was bad game design
---
/u/halefire94 So I'm assuming you want to do this as a PvP build, I would suggest getting Spiritual Focus and going with this build instead. Having Pushback protection can be really really helpful, if you're running concentration aura you'll even have 100% pushback protection when casting heals on yourself.

Most pservers have pretty big dps shifting bugs for feral. Like weight stones affecting their melee damage.

Stop smoking the hash pipe. Your reply had literally nothing to do with whether or not armor can be reduced into negative values. Which it cant.

It took me 25 days /played to hit level 60 on my first character (a Warrior, also my first ever MMO so not the best class to roll as a total n00b) way back in 2005. Part of the reason why it took me so long is the fact I spent EIGHT levels (from 36-44) farming SM on-and-off for the Ravager. I'm not kidding. Worse still, I was (obviously) a pretty slow leveler so my guildies were high enough to power me through the Whirlwind Axe quest as early level 31. That's right - I had access to the Whirlwind Axe AND Bonebiter axe and I *still* spent a considerable time trying to get that bloody axe. I even had Mograine's Might and every other drop from Mograine, as well as the full Scarlet Crusade set (minus the boots, which never dropped) by the time I was finished. The Ravager dropped twice. The first time I lost the roll to a Ret Paladin (of course), but thankfully I got it the second time it dropped - at the low low level of 44. 
---
I think I used it for about one level before I realised I had grossly outleveled it. I had no regrets though, even now it's my all time favorite WoW weapon - and Herod is one of my favorite bosses. I had planned to make a Mage in classic, but I know when I run SM again I'll get huge melee envy and I'll want to reroll. Now I'm trying to decide on Warrior (like my first character) or Paladin (the class I absolutely should've played for my first character).
---
Yeah I agree. I wrote in another post, that my solution would be to just take reitemized items out of the game until such time they were reitemized. It would mimic no one using them until they were good.
---
Thanks for the reply, I played hunter back in vanilla and loved it. I can remember how to kite and everything I just never played BM to level up at all. 
---
Everyone is also talking about how garbage hunters were but I can never remeber it being a problem  when i raided back in the day.

Better use rank 1 SWOP for that.

---
This doesn't address lvl 58/60 blue PvP gear, however, as the set was not upgraded, it was replaced with an entirely new set (new name and everything.)
---
"many" the only ones who will care are pserver spergs that have grinded the shit for years.
---
I'd say "many" would be a vast majority of classic players, which the pserver crowd ain't even close to
---
On second thought I remember writing a "please buff content" post long time ago:    
---
TLDR: if we don't retune classic content to 1.12, entire part of the game will be trivial.    
---
I.e, Dark Iron rep/Fire Resist gear and resist gear in general, consumes, world buffs, etc.....

Buff It!

This is not unpopular, should be more popular it's what it is. Having limited content plan for 1.5 years seems silly and they've obviously discussed this internally. Just go OSRS way ez clap
---
HeyGuys
---
That's why I said, even assuming there's no difference in their personal DPS output I would still choose the feral for the above listed reasons.
---
:D
---
I just did RFD pickpocket runs, it seemed to be about 25-35g/hr. I kept hearing 50g/hr but either I suck or that number is bullshit. Anyway, it's pretty mindless, no chance of anything going wrong pretty much.
---
Honestly stop complaining and make a roll play guild on a PvP server. Smh
---
I don't see how you can even be aware of these videos unless you are subscribed to their channels.
---
Thing is, the only worthwhile talent you're getting from combat is 5% hit. The DW talent will be very minor dps increase due to the crappy leveling weapons you'll be using.
---
Trying to backstab mobs is just not worth the effort, plus hemo is terrible with daggers. (Frontstabbing shouldn't work in classic)
---
Also hemo on it's own is not that great of a skill as it only does 100% damage of you MH weapon. You're spending 35 energy for an auto attack.
---
You need a good slow weapon, a good amount of crit and the lethality talent from sub tree, otherwise it will hit like a wet noodle.
---
Getting a raidspot as an "non-optimal" specc, all depends on the guild. And what classes they are fine with bringing. This is something you would have to ask the guild you are planing to join.
---
While it's a decent solution, I don't like that the "bad" version won't be dropping before the change anymore. While BRE isn't the clear OP choice before the reitemization I'm sure it saw a fair bit of use. Very few items had the shamestain that vendorstrike did, where bidding on it was considered shameful because it was so bad.
---
JoW isn't really necessary at all. JoL for some bosses with aoe mechanics but otherwise it's probably just gonna be a corruption on debuff.
---
True, splitting hairs though.  Emerald Dream was RP-PvP and has long been one of the most populated and active servers in the US.  For EU the whole connected Defias Brotherhood is quite populated and had the same distinction
---
/u/Mellisco So for what you want to do, PvP as Ret with your 2 hander etc. and Heal in PvP. I would reccomend getting Deflection instead of Improved Seal of the Crusader, because you're not going to have that many opportunities to use Judgement of the Crusader in PvP, and often times when you do if there's a disengage or a reset and you can't refresh the judgement on the target with your autoattacks it's going to fall off. So the damage that you would deal by judging command is actually more than the effective overall damage bonus that you would receive by having the holy damage debuff on the target. 
---
Also, improved Ret Aura is actually pretty decent while you're leveling, but because Ret Aura doesn't scale off of it's base value then I wouldn't go into imp ret aura at level 60. Sanctity Aura is going to help you do more damage than Ret Aura in most cases.

Fair enough! 90% is enough to make me comfortable, and if it fails then I just vanish and repeat. If it fails again then there's also Sprint!
---
Ambush crits are nice, but the CD on Vanish would drive me nuts here. Potentially waiting 5-10 min between pulls waiting for Prep/Vanish doesn't sound like a lot of fun D:
---
As a former rogue, we tend to tunnel vision on dps too much =/
---
My 60 rogue was crit with an Overpower for 2500 by someone with BRE. He was rank 7, still VERY early in raid progression overall. 
---
BRE is absolutely BIS until Ashkandi (and then it's still BIS for raiding I believe).
---
Then that‚Äôs what you go for :) both sets of racials appeal equally in their own way to pvp and consensus on which is better? practically a 50:50 split... 
---
Would i love to spit on the 50th UD Rogue‚Äôs corpse that day because crippling/blind is worthless and watch everyone else die on Huhu/Viscidus? Absolutely.
---
Would i love to gangbang some poor fool who stumbled into myself and 4 other NE/rogues? Meld and defend flags in bgs that much easier? Absolutely. 
---
I‚Äôm rambling but the point is they both make a great montage and you can‚Äôt go wrong, with this choice you can safely pick based on playstyle and aesthetic as differences in dps are negligible at best. Just make sure you can kite mobs and manage that pet!
---
Shoot for Priests.
---
Esfands post is literally two below this one (and has several less upvotes XD)
---
Preach. People are prisoners of their assumptions. People are afraid because of their assumptions. Break free and do what feels the most natural.
---
Shadowpriest should be okayish to roll. For anything else you want to know a guild in advance.
---
Take that stick out of your butt, it's funny.
---
I don't see anything about consumables in this quote.
---
I definitely don't want them to make changes that are not in vanilla. Some private servers buffed the damage and HP values on bosses to make them harder but it only really worked for the hardcore guilds as the mediocre guilds couldn't even get past MC. 
---
I do kinda want the old talents though because they bring the game closer to what it was during actual vanilla. And we actually get some tangible updates during Classic, not only new raids. 
---
But I'm pretty content with the way Classic looks now. I think everyone from team private server predicted the worst and Blizzard has definitely gone beyond our expectations.
---
&gt; An argument can be made that reading the post word for word is just filler content, I mean we can all read for ourselves can't we?
---
I agree with this I never stated differently I wish the system encouraged quality more, it just simply doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs very likely that some content creator is already doing exactly what your asking fo, and we just don‚Äôt know him because he doesn‚Äôt play nice with the algorithm. 
---
&gt;A better use of time would be discussing personal views on the topic, how it might impact the launch of Classic WoW etc.
---
Isn‚Äôt this exactly what he does and even let us know in this post when his analysis begins?
---
YOU are a good player and YOU are the only person that can control how WELL you play.
---
Maybe you have to rethink what Casual means, it attracts players who don't give a damn, because they just want to have fun occasionally. IT HAS NO MEANING about the quality of the player.
---
Of course there are good players in Casual raids, BUT THEY GET POACHED OR FRUSTRATED.
---
You don't have 40 high skilled players who just play Casual, be a little bit realistic and stop assuming anyone thinks that a casual player can't be very skilled.
---
WOW so you have 15 Skilled players in a 40 man Raid, WE HAD THEM AS WELL. SO? That doesn't make you not wipe at Ragnaros, when you need 40 people.
---
That doesn't stop Semi-Progress or Hardcore Raids from poaching your people. If you don't have some sort of progress, people will leave.
---
Ret and Prot are great in PvP if you know what you're doing. You can play them in raids, but Prot has a specific role in raids and you just have to know how to play it. Same with Ret, you're not going to do as much damage at the highest end of min-maxing as you would with a warrior or a rogue, but if you go all in and can prove yourself that you can at least pull your own weight, then you'll be fine.  
---
You'll never not be able to complete content in the game because you have a Ret, or a feral, or a boomkin, or some other hybrid in your raid. All the content in the came can be completed with 39 people, so if you're 40th guy is that hybrid or whatever you'll be just fine.
---
Back in classic we didn't know anything about "phase lengths" or patch lengths or server lists before it came out. So why should we know now?
---
Challenge: find the longest route using this tool!
---
So far: the longest route I have found is Cenarion Hold - Kargath. 17 mins
---
Oh it's not for pulls.  It's for ganks.  The dodge and parry and all that is for pulls.
---
This literally represents nothing since no one outside the pserver community knows the difference/gives a shit
---
YOUR SISTER'S HOT WAYNE, THERE I SAID IT!!!
---
...
---
I can't run!
---
Ability to NOT stand in fire/poison/void, NOT chain the cleave, and NOT blow-up the raid. Also in Very high demand.
---
Well I'm not gonna switch servers for it.....
---
Yeah it's pretty brutal. On Nostalrius I almost got rank 10, but I was unemployed and basically did nothing but play WoW and get drunk, so it probably took more time than it felt like. 
---
Will be interesting to see how it will be on Classic, I have no idea if it'll be worse than on private servers or easier, and definitely not compared to vanilla as I don't think I ever got to kill anyone back then.
---
You realize most people on RP servers actually want the server environment that comes with it right? Because it seems impossible that you can't know that by now.
---
Welp I just logged in onto my warrior and found a harness, thanks for that.
---
This is great. I‚Äôm happy that no one has to worry about how an item is going to change. It‚Äôs nice to feel excited about getting an upgrade. I hated that I could get an item that was great,but then a few months later it sucked and I had to replace it.
---
Wasn't it already as simple as it could get? :p
---
100% agree with blizzard. It doesnt matter if one or two items is BiS for a couple of phases....
---
So how many times will this video get posted, deleted and then posted again today?
---
This is like the 3rd or 4th time already
---
I've decided to move the points from DW to Malice, and actually I'd be spending 35 energy for an auto attack, a damage increase and a combo point. I can test whether or not it's actually worth it when retail comes out. Also, "not worth the effort" is purely subjective.
---
Hear, hear! At Vanilla we had 'non-viable' specs in raids. For me it's much more fun to be a little liberal about it. Let the crazy specs loose!
---
Yeah I think it's fine too. (But I bet tipsout will still complain lol...)
---
Because of the proc? The dps stat is lower but I know almost nothing about melee. I've only seen it in PvP and man does it hurt.
---
Bro can you make me one? Druid symbol and the name riverleaf... How much for your time?
---
&gt; You can PvP one another in the world, but there is no tracking, and no formal rewards for doing so. Feel free to repeatedly hunt down every player and NPC in, say, Stranglethorn Vale to your stealthy heart‚Äôs content!  
---
Change "tracking" to "ranking" or "tracking/ranking" for a bit more clarity.
---
im not sure the items are the biggest issue, i think that not buffing warlocks threat might be more important to think about at early content, before tanks get geared.  
---
Because ive played warlock before, and when tanks are not geared a crit is almost scary. If they can trow corruption + made 15% more damage on top of that, i would be scared of trowing Shadow Bolts, and probably had to hold back because of it.
---
DKP works fine if kept up to . Used it in BC black temple days. Can't really argue. You either have the points or you don't and get outbid.
---
The guide gave me a simple overview :) I am not sadly not a vanilla veteran...
---
I love this idea, but I fear that PvP would become unbearable for those of us that don't have time to raid. A DPS+healer in T5 gear would practically be 10 levels higher than even someone in full blues. Even a rogue in naxx gear will shred almost anyone without even trying.
---
Ohhhh I thought you meant change from pserver to retail feral change.
---
The problem is you are assuming you have both in raid, take a situation where you can either add your 4th/5th paladin or a 4th/5th druid. You can't have both. Paladin as a class is comparable to druid
---
No he spammed wrath
---
I'm not sure what the undead campaign is in classic. In retail its about battle the gilneans, which is pretty neat. I also wouldn't recommend focusing on two characters, at least not until your main's first mount is paid for. having multiple characters can sometimes be a money suck.
---
Depends on what kind of a raiding quality standards you are looking for.
---
Good guilds won't take any or will take one, and if they are going to - then it's 99% chance that this spot is already claimed by GM's best friend, officer, girlfriend or whatever. 
---
Average guilds capable of clearing the content might take a one or two meme specs, but you'd better stand out since competition for spots is a very likely thing to happen.
---
Bottom tier guilds struggling to fill up slots would literally take anyone. But don't expect much from them.
---
Did you expect guilds to struggle in mc? Or even in naxx?
---
I play warrior tank, i never felt do fill a niche slot in classic aside from a shadow priest twink
---
As a 60 NE Hunter, I tamed the while lion Echeyakee from the Barrens, named it the same and had him stay on the road north of the crossroads while I stealthed in a nearby tower.
---
Low level Horde players on the quest to kill Echeyakee would see him and engage, not noticing that I was winding up an aimed shot on them.
---
I don't understand what kind of response you want from this post... like yeah a video that's just saying "theres a blue post" is pointless but what are you actually trying to accomplish?
---
Shadowpriest always struggles with mana
---
If it‚Äôs anything like vanilla 25 switched on players can carry 15 duds, should be fine until naxx
---
In my vanilla guild, the druis had their own private chat channel. We would scheme together so we could each get our class pieces for minimal dkp allowing us to horde dkp for non class drops.
---
The gladiator chest piece from BRD Arena too?
---
Gratz mate. You're in the money!
---
yep, while some is important fury warrior is mostly stat based, and that armor pen proc is just insane for dps
---
Quere dodging?
---
Can do the same thing with mind control on humanoid mobs lol
---
Rogue with a 2H Sword?
---
- Shadow Priest, Feral - it‚Äôs possible to get a spot in a semi-hardcore guild but one per raid at most and you have to be very dedicated.
---
- Enhancement - big maybe, also one per raid, and almost no itemization iirc.
---
- Ret, Balance, Elemental - there is no point in bringing them over a healer or a proper DPS.
---
If you are not willing to heal, don‚Äôt play a hybrid class. If you want to play raid spec in PvE and PvP in offspec, prepare for obnoxious respec costs and getting your offspec gear once the DPS are fully geared. If you only want to do dungeons and the occassional entry level raid pug, most of those classes could work, Ret and Balance are still unlikely though.
---
Why back to retail? People will be addicted to the game. Also plenty of new people will be brought in for a huge launch game experience from streamers and press.
---
Ah interesting, never really played Horde.
---
...yeah we know...
---
This kills the classic wow hype. I am definitely not going through the 1-60 grind just to do it all over again later because they don't recognize how large of a community wants this server type. Guess my sub is on hold 'til they make it.
---
I don't really blame them for not thinking it's much of a thing, though, seeing as how they've continually gone out of their way to destroy that community on live via shit like microphasing since WoD.
---
pretty sure we did know about servers prior to release day. 
---
And as for phases, my assumption is phases will last roughly as they did in actual vanilla--since we can peg phases to patch content. That said, patches were often released--at that time--based on when the content was done, not when player bases were ready for it. The content has been finished for 15 years in some cases. 
---
Do I &gt;need&lt; to know anything? No, I could quit my job, refuse to pay my taxes and die homeless on the streets. 
---
But a release date, server lists (so I can begin to think about where I want to play and if I want to join a guild prior to launch), and vague phase lengths would allow me to plan out into the future a bit (is this game going to consume the next 2, 2.5 or 3 years of my life)
---
It‚Äôs a good point though
---
The initial economy for WoW didn‚Äôt take into account people IMMEDIATELY farming BRD or dire maul or aoe grinding etc
---
Going into Classic, people are going to be straight farming ASAP
---
It begs the question if they will nerf the most lucrative farming methods
---
I'm on the fence between Warrior and Paladin. Warrior was my very first level 60 way back in 2005, and it's a class I've always enjoyed throughout the different WoW expansions. I did level a Paladin in TBC before the xp changes, but my classic experience is limited to Warrior, Shaman, and Rogue. 
---
I don't have the time nor the appetite to play WoW as hardcore as I did during Vanilla, but I think I'd like to try out Classic when it releases because it'll be awesome to play WoW again when everyone has to start from level one. Since leveling is the only content I'm absolutely sure to experience, I was curious to know what the Paladin leveling experience is like. Do Paladins offer a true hybrid experience while leveling? I like the control one has while tanking, is Paladin capable of doing this from level 20 onwards? Do Ret Paladins get invited to dungeons as DPS? And how does Holy or Ret fair as a healer? Paladins have a lot less buttons to push than Warriors while leveling, do the extra defensive options, heals and roles make up for this? How do the two classes compare in leveling speed, particularly from level 40 onwards (when leveling starts to turn into a slog)? 
---
I'm not particularly concerned with how the classes compare at 60, even though comparatively much more time is spent at 60 than reaching it. Warriors are excellent in every facet in the game, but Paladins (at least of the healing variety) are much lower maintenance. If I play seriously beyond the leveling experience, it'll be because of the friends I made along the way and not the class I'm playing, so it's pretty important I play something which will engage me on the path to 60. Warrior is the default option since it's what I've enjoyed in the past and it's the nostalgic choice, but I've always had a soft spot for the Paladin class thematically so I'm giving the class serious consideration. Plus Verigan's Fist is awesome.
---
I was hoping I could maybe get you to blow some air out your nose fast. Maybe even a slight chuckle if i'm lucky.  Honestly it was all a ploy to plug my twitch channel but don't let these other guys know.  Just give me a follow, theres gonna be some great resto shaman gameplay for you to watch when classic drops &lt;3
---
God I hated that bloody flap
---
Except you‚Äôll only see 10 people because of sharding.
---
The worst is when you just barely beat someone to an herb but you fail the rng and they don't.
---
Interesting! But why would Deflection be better than Benediction in this case? Do you find that 5% parry to help you out more than the 15% less mana on Judgement or seals? But you are very right about not being able to keep SotC up or use judgement in a kinetic PvP environment, I didnt even think about that. That's the kind of thing you can't "see" when looking at a talent calculator, gotta find a "vanilla community forum" like you guys said to try out my build haha
---
The video is facing some issues with the thumbnail and trying to fix this, sorry for the incov.
---
He had a chance to copy them over to YouTube. But I also lost a bunch so I‚Äôm in the same boat.
---
Gouge - 45 energy
---
Backstab - 60 energy
---
So you have to do the following:
---
1. Wait until you have 100 energy
---
2. Gouge
---
3. Get behind a mob, switch to daggers and wait for the energy tick (20 energy every 2 seconds)
---
4. Backstab
---
5. Switch back to swords/maces
---
6. Wait for gouge CD
---
7. Rinse repeat
---
You'll kill the mob faster by just spamming hemo or SS.
---
Turns out I have a couple but all of them were equipped and apparently all those items were made to be soulbound in 7.0 :(
---
This is basically a spell power ret set or a Shockadin set that you can use. There's plenty of different builds you can play with this gear, but it's just up to you. It's not particularly good for raids, but it's fine in PvP!  
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/A8\_RxATf0DDAAA](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/A8_RxATf0DDAAA)   
---
That's a Holy Reckoning build you could use, there's a lot of discussion about if Improved Seal of Righteousness is supposed to be applied before spell power calculations or afterwards. The thought is, that in Burning Crusade is was after, in Vanilla it was before, but we'll see for sure when Classic comes out. If it's before, then you could argue that imp SoR isn't worth and you should just get divine intellect maybe.
---
Thanks for the advice! Definitely helpful.
---
If I wanted to use this build for pve, what would you suggest?
---
Good at sex
---
Yeah, it's an issue that stems both ways with R10 being worthless and R13 potentially being balance breaking. I really do hope that we get some more information regarding the subject before release.
---
The "I do it because I can" philosophy makes me sad. It does does consider the outcome ones actions. It is extremely selfish and detrimental to community.
---
If you're not ok with that then you may need to reconsider your outlook.
---
I worked at comp usa (RIP)(sike fuck that place glad it burned to the ground)) and I could get these with my discount. Only reason I worked there as long as I did.
---
I mean surely remastering SC and WC2 D1 (and presumably D2:LOD (I honestly want that as much as WoW Classic)) presented similar problems in theme if not technicalities.
---
I think you don't have perspective. Even with sharding you are still gonna have a lot of competition in order to level up. The amount of people complaining about crowded areas would be too big compared to the number of people not liking sharding. You literally prefer to contest a single mob with thousands of people instead of playing the actual game. I think the game you're looking for is the lottery, not wow.
---
Damn didnt try that im gonna told them
---
What doesn't get mentioned enough in this discussion is that the average player, be that in WoW or any other game, is now considerably better than they were 14 years ago. On top of that we will have all sorts of guides and min maxing from day one about a 14 year old game. Vanilla PvE content even back in the day wasn't too difficult and with the release of Classic WoW it really will be piss easy mechanical wise. On retail people don't even need guilds anymore to clear the new raid on HC in the first weeks and those raids often have significantly more difficult bosses mechanical wise than any Vanilla raid. If you aren't a hardcore server first player it really only matters that you show up every raidnight.
---
Reliable healer, blacksmith extraordinaire!
---
I would never trust something like this, if you're not a part of the guild core, you could get told to kick rocks. You have to really trust people for this, and in my experience, people will do what They want, not what's Fair 85% of the time.
---
Tl;dr: Don't trust it, I'd rather it be RNG based, and Needed and Greeded as the situation calls.
---
Same reason I got a gorilla on an old hunter.  Stats be damned, I wanted a damn dirty ape by my side.
---
You're now making an absurd choice out of it, I would never pick the druid in that scenario because there's already plenty. Druids don't stack well and you'd be a fool to bring that many, while paladins have barely any diminishing returns on usefulness before you hit 5+. The choice you're presenting is making the feral v ret debate moot because you'd never need 4 or 5 innervates or brezzes so that utility is completely wasted.
---
I don't care that he earns ad revenue. It annoys me that, to enable the ad revenue, he tacks on eight minutes of him reading the post sentence by sentence. Its lazy filler that plagues a lot of the Classic WoW videos on Youtube at the moment.
---
I can't even going how many times people have asked if Lupos will still do shadow damage after being tamed.
---
I believe Intimidating Shout could be silenced. I know warriors had 1-2 spells that could be silenced.
---
did they bring it back? because halfway though Lich King that trick stopped working
---
This is the patch note on BRE change.
---
* The Bonereaver's Edge's triggered effect has been changed. Instead of lowering your victim's armor, it will cause you to ignore a portion of your victim's armor. Its triggering rate was substantially increased as well as the magnitude of the effect. In addition, the item now has 16 stamina.
---
Yes that's a pity. They'll only be reliable if you unequalled them prior to Cata
---
&gt; BRE is absolutely BIS until Ashkandi
---
Ashkandi is dogshit
---
It‚Äôll be pretty hard as an ench shaman because that doesn‚Äôt exist.
---
Go make a UD rouge, it‚Äôs more you.
---
I enjoy the Invasion and Invasion 2 pvp videos. Some basic stuff but a good watch.
---
And plans to maintain server pops and faction balance, i.e. mergers or transfers, etc.
---
You are literally going against things you yourself are saying.
---
&gt; stop assuming anyone thinks that a casual player can't be very skilled. 
---
&gt; WOW so you have 15 Skilled players in a 40 man Raid, WE HAD THEM AS WELL. SO? That doesn't make you not wipe at Ragnaros, when you need 40 people. 
---
You literally just said casual players can be skilled and then went to say people will leave at wiping on Ragnaros. You are both equally saying casual's are bad and can be good. Just because you don't want to seek out a casual scheduled guild with good players doesn't mean they don't exist. If you have any knowledge of retail WoW guilds, my personal friend is an officer of the guild &lt;Encore&gt;. They raid 12 hours a week and yet often rank in top 100 world. Mind you, this is for more difficult content than what Vanilla will offer. They could easily raid slightly less often and still be successful.
---
You can have good players in a more casual setting. You can have good progress on a more casual schedule. I don't understand why you feel the need to be so defensive about "hardcore" players and if you aren't hardcore you don't stand a chance in progressing. This is a fallacy. I have no issues with people who want to be competitive, but to say a casual schedule means you can't see content is just straight up incorrect.
---
How only works with auto attacks.
---
So it would only really benefit hunters and rets.
---
Challenging Shout is BC I think but I'm pretty sure it's Shouts and maybe something else
---
Perhaps if they played the same class they could adjust their lists priority to make sure they had different top items? Either way, if there is a guaranteed best staff for mages and you have 4 mages, you need the staff to drop 4 times to gear them all regardless of loot system. I guess I never bring the loot system into question cause I don't care what items I get as long as bosses are dropping.
---
If it makes you feel better, its the only part of the video I dislike.
---
Completely agree. I honestly expected this considering how shit the demo was and the release date they gave, but damn classic will be dead as hell after 6 months. The content is laughable with OP gear. Unfortunately the normies seeped into the nochanges community and shit all over the potential of this release. 
---
&gt; Why do you think that hunter really sucks?
---
I was specifically referring to how hard it will be for them to find raid spots. This chart shows that they will have the hardest time of any class.
---
I can already feel the hype for patch 1.13 :D
---
It IS a hunter weapon...
---
No shit, the original situation said ferals and ret aren't comparable. Which my statement was talking about adding one into a raid.
---
I really really hope that‚Äôs the case. It would feel more authentic if the p server community is less than 1 %
---
Wow, thanks for the reply Esfand. Big fan here!
---
yep, the ability to lead trumps any class.
---
Casual implies lower time commitment not lower accountability or lack of tough leadership. You can raid 9 hours a week and be very tough on the no bullshit. You can have a casual raid schedule and only accept good raiders. You are perpetuating a stereotype that in order to succeed you must have a hard-core schedule. This is simply false. I mentioned down below, look at the guild Encore on retail. Their main raid schedule is 12 hours and they're a top 100 world guild.
---
Wait, what?!
---
&gt; dead realms will drive away far more people than a queue will
---
So much this. I get why RP'ers are frustrated over this, but their reasoning is sound on this one.
---
Because by making the video when he wakes up, he can release it immediately and start following the conversation on the topic, then when a clear reddit hivemind-opinion has formed he can make a video explaining the arguments he's seen other people use to argue in favor of this hive-mind opinion.
---
It's like you're not even trying to squeeze the lemon, bro.
---
All you have to do to see a video about how the BiS lists change is to compile the lists yourself, post them in text format and an hour later there's 5 guides on YT on what your new BiS list is.
---
I imagine they are going to tune the raid before releasing. Why wouldn't they? Or have they came out and said all the hp and damage would be the same?
---
Your evidence doesn't count because it disproves what I was talking about. fuckin K bro.
---
It's one guy, and it's definitely #2.
---
Oh yeah my bad
---
Traitor.
---
If they were to remove bad features they'd have to remove a lot of the game 
---
The whole point is keep it the way it was good and bad
---
You can toggle enemy players on or off in the capital cities now.
---
Pretty sure I'm being trolled, here. Good luck out there, champ
---
More clarity. There's been like 8 posts about how they're releasing content in 6 phases, and people are still acting confused? Everybody on this sub thinks they're some Classic Savant, but struggle to understand a simple concept like timegating.
---
Insults most of the community. Nice guy
---
I fucking hate that sometimes I finally manage to get their fucking algorithms to pick shit I actually think is fairly quality stuff, but then I go AFK and forget to pause, come back an hour later and autoplay has fucked it all up.
---

Can you login without paying for 1 month?

Nah you're just moving the goal posts to suit your argument.
---
Old tweet
---
For classic to be as succesful as possible they need the best launch experience.
---
If people get to experience an actual MMORPG where they are an active participant of a living breathing world they will stick around for the journey.
---
I was thinking something more like:
---
1. Stealth for Backstab Crit (from Remorseless Attacks)
---
3. SS
---
4. Evis
---
At least until I get Hemo/Dirty Deeds, then:
---
1. Stealth to Cheap Shot
---
2. Hemo
---
3. Backstab
---
With whatever waiting is required for energy regen. Not really worried about weapon swapping, because ya know, I don't really care about efficiency. It's going to take me 6 months or longer to level anyway, so I may as well have fun with it.
---
It never stopped working. People can avoid it by looking down with their right-click camera so they just plunge into the water rather than taking damage, same way if you're water walking and you want to go into the water, you aim your character down. At a certain angle it will just make you submerge. It's this mechanic that smart players can use to avoid getting merked by water walking fall damage.
---
DKs/shamans in our Blackrock Foundry raid did it rather often on the fall down to Iron Maidens to troll raid members.
---
You can even test it with the Water Strider, jump into water from something high enough to cause fall damage while riding the water strider, just make sure your camera isn't angled too far down or you'll just plunge instead of land.
---
I'm not sure, but I doubt they will change around the stats of bosses.
---
I wish they did progressive itemization but at the same time I'm not all that fussed.
---
Moar blue posts please.
---
Good point on the sharding.  I forgot we don't have a clear answer on that besides "probably but not forever".

That would be kind of cool. During the life of the server, there would just be this lvl 1 character standing there. Over time, people start to recognize this guy, knowing he is not really a player, but this timelapse camera. And then everyone wants to be seen by it, strutting past it with progressively nicer gear etc.
---
Nothing is ever needed. But it's an MMO and a huge part of MMO's is getting gear upgrades. The better said upgrade is, the better it feels.
---
People are going to be stuck in blue gear for over a year with this change. I don't know about you, but being stuck in the same gear for so long while clearing raids where 95% of the epics gets disenchanted isn't exactly fun for me.  
---
Nor is it fun knowing that the best gear comes from PvP, when I have no interest in it really.
---
Month old news wtf
---
Debuff slots
---
In every MMO I've played I always did the "wow was the first mmo" one. Lots of people would bite on that one and it was hilarious.
---
Probably yes. But daggers go to non humans first and you‚Äôre more likely to get perd/cth than viskag because you gave to compete against warriors who if good, can out dps rogues easily
---
This one.  If we need to make the sharding concession to have a better launch experience it doesn't mean anything if people who want to try the game out don't stay because of a bad launch experience due to server capacity.
---
Hopefully blizz can handle it, and have backup plans ready.
---
Server size and plans for server merging in the future
---
If your enjoyment comes from pvp, paladins shit on just about everyone 1v1 and are worth their weight in gold in WSG and AB. Who cares if your raiding is just as a buffbot, it's not like being a DPS in raid means you're some server icon everyone looks up to.
---
For the actual raid leader, I would recommend ranged dps as several others have.  You definitely want to have the main tank and a solid healer in your very close officer core as well though to make sure they are solidly planted in the guild with near perfect raid attendance.
---
I made a Tauren friend cover rival Horde fishing bobbers in STV during an extravaganza. He stopped after 15 minutes though as the affected players were threatening to report him. Not sure if it would be warrant action against him, but he didn‚Äôt want to take the risk.
---
Full T3. It's going to take a long while and I'll probably be stuff in AQ40 for a stretch.
---
&gt;but re releasing TBC would blow my fucking mind.
---
I don't think you really had to reiterate that point buddy, your love for TBC came clear across.
---
That's ok as long as Shaman remains Horde exclusive and Paladin - Alliance exclusive.
---
Part of what makes Vanilla Vanilla is the fact that each faction has its identity thanks to one class that the other faction does not have.
---
In fact it will be good if they add 2 new classes, one of each is unique to one faction.
---
RPers is also in the minority here, not saying they don't have anything to say, but the 'interest' of the masses definitely is more important than a niche group of people. Especially also when RP servers are technically normal or PvP servers, just for people who like RP'ing, while Normal/PvP servers change the fundamentals of the game.
---
Make the only RP realm Rp-PVP if you must. if not, we need to organize and determine which PVP realm will be the defacto RP(PVP) realm if only unofficially.
---
You can log in to sub 20 characters without a sub. For the rest you need to be subbed.
---
Looks the same as it did when I saw it ages ago. Sure you're not just spamming for views?
---
Isn‚Äôt the worgen/scythe plot in vanilla though? I remember a quest chain in darkshire about it.
---
Oh God lol. I can imagine the revolt on that one lmao. UUMM ACKSHUALLLLY
---
This is what they fail to understand.  People that start characters aren't all going to want to start over once they add RPPVP.  Sure, some will, but now all you've done is delayed the splintering of the population that you were trying to avoid in the first place.
---
Theres two types of wow players. 
---
Good, and alliance.
---
Minor news
---
Tipsout: 15 min videon 3 adds 
---
Piece of shit never even played classic. Absolute parasite
---
tell that to the bear tanks main tanking bosses in naxx,
---
viable =/= optimal
---
I will be the Mage that always just hangs around Orgrimmar making good for the million alts and thinks I'll make.
---
People will be like "the Mage has been here all month selling portals and enchants, I bet he's loaded."
---
A modest goal, but it's mine.
---
I've been having an argument with a couple of folks who find it difficult to understand that a casual raid schedule still means you can clear all content and not be completely trash players. It's a stereotype that is very strong in a number of people.
---
Trivial by the elite.  
---
Not so trivial by the average player though. I don't see why you'd want to make it more trivial for the average player though? I also don't understand why you'd want dungeon blues to be BiS until AQ40, making players feel like they aren't getting an item upgrade for over a year, while running MC and BWL and disenchanting 95% of the gear that drops.  
---
That's not fun for anyone.
---
If you open a ticket and ask a gm nicely they will probably give you 24hrs for free. I've heard of people doing this in the past. You'll be able.to log on to characters below 20 without an active sub. But won't be able to post items on the AH with them
---
First podcast I ever listened to was just called ‚ÄòWow Podcast‚Äô and was hosted by what sounded like two NZ guys. It was so basic, being the game was new and they were kinda just going through how everything worked, but I loved it, having that extra layer of depth listening to it while playing.
---
I want a cat too, but I've decided I'm going to spend my time getting that sweet, sweet Winterspring saber :D
---
But it still is? Wasn't for a while though, but nowadays PvP and PvE gear are practically the same thing
---
I got Haunted Memento on my main that I could probably trade/sell for some gametime, but im kind of too greedy to sell it even though I never (and probably never will) play retail wow anymore.
---
Is it still the same thumbnail?
---
I joined an MC pug on a private server in the past week. 2 things happened. Raid leader said "invite whoever, we just need bodies at this point." When we had \~5 spots to fill. We also repeatedly wiped on Garr and then struggled with Geddon over about 3.5 hrs. I guess my point is that even though people come from a private server, they still might not know what they're doing. Also that the body count rule does ring true. There's a reason 40 man raids didn't make it past vanilla. Nerds are finicky, and it's hard to organize that many people.
---
SP does not do 70% the damage of mage (more like 50% to 30% when they are forced to downrank) and they heal for 30% of shadow damage done not 20%, however they run oom really fast and have to downrank abilities which means lower dps, which was already low, which means less healing, it is more efficient to use a shadowweaving healer rather than use up 2 extra debuff slots and a dps slot for a sp
---
I am not saying its useless at all, it can definitely work and putting the SP in the Warlock group makes a lot of sense
---
Theyve been pretty clear its going to be 16 the entire time.
---
You can't look at a meter and see how having a Feral dps providing 3% crit to four Warriors, gives you more raid dps than just having 5 Warriors. The Feral doesn't even need to pull his full dps potential to make it worth it either, but you will see him near the bottom of the total dmg and be fooled into thinking "He has the lowest dmg, that must be the problem.."
---
Bow will add a lot more dps than a corruption will.
---
All your links are broken because the person running the site is having a tantrum
---
Likewise, the people who would have trouble with it are going to have as much trouble as they normally would. Gotta clear these things a few times before lots of the item changes make a difference anyways.
---
I considered it, but man i'll be impressed with anybody who has THAT patience. I'd rather go for the Qiraji Tank
---
i remember the same thing happening when cata was being released. Hundreds of new youtube channels popping up trying to cash in on the potential views for the upcoming expac.
---
Right? I've got an alt, a bank toon, friends, a guild, etc. 
---
I guess we just need to keep making posts about it
---
As someone who recently (earlier today) tested this, yep. As a Priest it did about the same damage as Smite for the level, except much faster, costs no mana, and doesn't get cast pushback either. Shield, Renew if needed &gt; Wand. Easy life.
---
lol gotem
---
The fucking irony dude. I was arguing with somebody a few days ago who was *adamant* that WoW appealed to people because it was the single most hardcore MMO on the market.
---
I just.
---
Couldn't.
---
Can you do damage as a holy pally? I want to lvl with a friend that‚Äôs going to be a warrior.
---
Evil!
---
So how is 1 RP-PVP server going to hurt everyone else?  Its just one realm...
---
There's definitely the upside of having it feel more "fresh", but it'll also just feel _wrong_. You'll miss the Horde by level ~20 and re-roll, so honestly I'd say stick with what you're used to.
---
The slice of the community that will feel "pressured" here is so small, I can't see it impacting anything tbh.
---
Omg this is so true. I've never seen it all in once place but all of the stories are so dumb now.
---
"There must always be a lich king" bothered me the most. Why does there have to be a Lich King? Azeroth killed him when the scourge was under a central command (The Lich King). Why would it be harder to kill the scourge when they have no master? If it is harder to deal with, why didnt the Lich King just do that from the start and kill everyone?
---
And if we have a friendly Lich King who's keeping everything at bay, why not wipe out the scourge right now? Or better yet, why wouldn't the friendly Lich King just wipe out the scourge himself? Then we definitely wouldn't need a Lich King.
---
None of this makes any sense. I know its just so that they can keep him in their back pocket and use him as an expansion again later.
---
jumping off the tree is pretty fun though
---
Mage would probably be best. If you‚Äôre the raid leader and you get a fat shadowbolt crit off the pull, pull aggro and wipe the raid the people that you are leading will think you have brain damage lol
---
There was a spot on the edge of the fatigue zone where if you summoned them they'd be instantly teleported to the bottom of the ocean and the only way you could get your body back is if you spirit rezzed. I also use to pvp in the water as an undead mage back when polymorphing people in the water clipped the sheep down to the bottom so it could walk around and I'd kite them with rank 1 frostbolt until they drowned.
---
Why not use ambush then? Deals more damage and with Initiative talent it will give 2 combo points.
---
But anyways, do whatever you think will be more fun for you.
---
i tried it just now and it took me an hour and 40 minutes, I was estimating numbers based off new stuff i learned but i was wronnng. Getting such a low time will definitely be impossible in retail calssic due to sheer player population lol
---
Whats the point of this post? Just don't watch their content. No need to stir up hate.
---
They're not sharding major cities.
---
But that slice of the community is the slice that plays the highest number of hours per week, and they'll be out in the world, so they'll be impacting a lot of other people's experiences with this change.
---
TBC is trash.  Just put in a horizontal progression phase with content from TBC scaled down to 60.  Karazhan, Caverns of Time, and Arenas.  More versions of the game would just split the community even further than fresh servers will.
---
Lol I was just suggesting an edit. Holy shit dude take your medicine.
---
You don't even know what that term means.....Jesus Christ I need to stop feeding the trolls. Mildly entertaining, at least
---
Or you could just PVE if you like PVE and you can PVP if you like PVP. In Vanilla all I did was pvp and rank because I enjoyed that side of the game. Later I raided to enjoy that side. I think do what you enjoy. Otherwise the grind for gear will be just that: a grind.
---
&gt; Trivial by the elite.
---
&gt; Not so trivial by the average player though
---
No. Molten Core is trivial for everybody.
---
BoW?
---
I'm assuming you mean Judgement of Wisdom, which doesn't add any dps at all, just grants mana on hit
---
It's impossible with proper rates and playing on a local copy.
---
I could MAYBE see 1:20 Dun Morough run, my fastest so far is a 1:29 mage run. I can't break 1:30 in any other zone. If you pull of a 1:20 anywhere with xp shown you need to post it, cause afaik it's impossible with the correct values.
---
Yeah, I think buffing it in moderation's the best route. I still want to see people being able to play their boomies if they want to though. If it's too difficult, it might end up impossible to bring them along to anything which would be a shame.
---
Yes I do? I literally just used it in the correct context. You say X I counter with Z you say Z doesn't count because it doesn't fit your ruleset of what evidence relavent because "reasons" and there you have it; A first hand example of someone losing an argument so they move the goal posts of what counts as evidence so they don't have to argue against it.
---
This is based on private servers, take it for what you want, but it's about the closest thing to real Vanilla we have. 
---
&gt; If you're worried about getting a raid spot, you're also forgetting how  hard it was just to get 40 competent players together on a single night. 
---
It's been shown time and time again, getting 40 people to raid isn't the main problem anymore. Raids are being cleared fast enough to the point where you're cutting a raid night off, from back then, maybe even two if you raided a lot. So not only do a lot of people have the time to raid now, but the general player is also much more 'hardcore' than back then. 
---
&gt; Choosing a class for Vanilla is tough, because there are many factors  involved. I played a Dwarf Hunter in Vanilla and loved every second of  it. 
---
Even 'top' guilds on private servers, which is more hardcore than Vanilla guilds ever were, don't strictly recruit people based on their race, unless that race actually matters a lot, which it does for priests. Until you got Fear Wards covered, for example.
---
As for Warriors, Rogues and basically all other classes, if you can compete with the other races for DPS, or at least perform close to as if any other good Warrior, Rogue or some other class played your character, you're fine, because the DPS difference between the best/worst race for Warriors, Mages, Rogues and so forth are so small that personal skill will often win. A better Tauren Warrior can beat the little worse Orc Warrior for example.
---
&gt; Now I know that had I visited Naxx, perhaps I wouldn't have been able to  top meters as easily as a Mage or Warrior. But it doesn't really matter  for Classic just as it didn't in Vanilla. It's because people are  feeling this cognitive dissonance as WE ALL KNOW it doesn't matter what  you play. But to see so many already min-maxing their nonexistent  characters and talking about raids as if they'll never fight freakin'  Onyxia unless they're a Dwarf Holy Priest or a Human Combat Rogue or an  Orc Prot Warrior gives us a feeling that we'll be perpetually  underpowered if we play what we really want. 
---
The min-max situation is just how the average player play these days. Play about any online game and there's tons of guides up, because people actually read and use them. Because the average player usually does his homework these days, because the homework is out there and much easier to find than back then. 
---
People are not worried about clearing a raid anymore, they're worried about how fast they can clear it. If they have to use another raid night or an extra hour to get it done, which is the point. When something becomes too easy and basically is impossible to improve more on, they'll find other ways to stay competitive and improve, which is clear times. 
---
&gt; It's not healthy nor is it based in reality, and I feel bad for the new  players who want to play Retadin or Enhancement Shaman or Feral Druid  but stop themselves from doing what they want in a game they \*\*pay for\*\*  because this subreddit puts viability on a pedestal. If you want to see  endgame, what really matters is that you join an organized guild and  just show up ready to play your role to the max. /rant 
---
In fact, Feral Druid is actually one of the few accepted hybrid specs these days, at least much more than most others, because they can actually compete in DPS, with proper itemization and dedication. The min-max is based on the reality of the situation, that's what the average player do to some extent. 
---
Nothing stops the subpar specs from seeing content, there'll defnitely be guilds/raids for these types of players, they just have to stop joining guilds/raids, which want most people to pull their weight or at least perform within a certain margin, which most of these specs can't.
---
Muahahaha. Damn tho, thought pallies/warriors could.
---
Haters gonna hate I guess. I live an adult life now and have to balance work/love/WoW. I‚Äôm so stoked for classic and I‚Äôm not trying to miss out on content, but a guild who wants raiding to be my top priority is a hard no. I‚Äôm looking for homies who are down to fuck around with content and have a good time.
---
&gt;  The recent announcement on itemization is not clear about PvP rewards
---
&gt; WoW Classic will only include that last version of the item, as it existed in our reference version: 1.12.  
---
What exactly is unclear about this?
---
And wanding priests
---
We can't argue whether their DPS is comparable because we only have pserver data which you already said you would disregard, so it's moot. I would always bring a feral unless I already had 3 druids. In that case, I would bring the paladin, make him go holy, and have a druid go feral. I don't see any reason to bring the paladin as ret if I have any other choice. Unless that choice is a boomkin.
---
Probably will if I have daggers, which I prefer, but know they are rare while leveling.
---
This is what grinds my gear the most. Blizzard is deliberately taking advantage of the majority of people who doesn't have the slightest idea how negatively this change is going to impact the game.
---
Their whole post reeks of manipulation.   
---
I don't see how making the game easier is good. 
---
I don't see why getting half your BiS gear until AQ40 from dungeons is good.
---
I don't see why it's good that the fastest speedruns will be decided by whoever has the most rank 14s and not whoever has the best coordination and skill combined. 
---
I don't see why it's good for the game that we won't be seeing a bunch of exciting changes when each phase drops in regards to gear. 
---
I don't see why it's good for the game that epic items won't feel epic. 
---
I don't see why it's good for the game that by adding this change, there's less incentive to run raids due to most gear being obsolete.
---
I've also got this. However I'm very reluctant to sell it. Might end up not doing it at all. Grew to like the apparition following me around at times.
---
What?
---
The items will 1.12 stats, AKA their final version.
---
Cool thanks. I'm surprised at the ironfoe one honestly.
---
MadSeason has that silky smooth voice that I think would put me to sleep but somehow never does
---
You need to... like relax.. dude...
---
It's unclear because of the way the two PvP sets work: when they're upgraded in patch 1.11, one is replaced with new items while the other just has the stats on the same items changed. This means that according to Blizzard's wording, Classic begins with the pre-upgrade version of one set and the upgraded version of the other, which is so absurd that one must be able to assume that they just weren't clear about their intentions with the PvP sets.
---
Personally this isn't optimal but it's fine.  The biggest issue is the rank 14 gear and if this affects progression depends on the phase duration.
---
Consumables matter a lot though. 
---
How do you tell people who spend a considerable amount of gold and time in order to perform 30-40% better, that another raider is allowed to raid in a spec that performs 30-40% worse by default?
---
Why should anyone bother increasing their performance if it's okay to just fool around on a Moonkin or Retpaladin? 
---
Personally I could care less, but as a Raid Leader I wouldn't be able to tell people that they simply have to compensate the lack of damage from Bob because Bob likes to be special.
---
Someone people will have to draw a line what is acceptable and what isn't, and what's standard for some will be elitist tryhard behavior for others. I imagine it to be difficult, to say the least.
---
This is why we need streamers to make 10+ minute videos explaining every blue post /s
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s.
---
*I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*
---
Yeeaah sure it would be swell if they could guarantee people get their names but it would be way too much of a hassle to pull off for something almost no one would care about. Not worth catering to streamers or w/e when they can just pick a new name if they don‚Äôt get the one they want.
---
I really believe that this mindset is overthinking what will actually happen once the game goes live. You're talking about such wild extremes.  People always take the path of least resistance.  
---
I think you have a valid concern, but I don't see it playing out the way you believe it will.
---
1-10 is a necessary concession, I agree. But I think people should strap themselves in for a wild mmorpg experience past 10, without sharding. The real game should open up as it was by then.
---
Right.  
---
Alright well forge ahead brave warrior.
---
Asmongolds is, he should be the lead dev for Classic tbh.
---
I guess you can't read?
---
I agree completely. I hadn't actually considered the Ner'Zhul aspect for a long time, but you're absolutely right. 
---
He was SUCH an important character in WC2, and even a fairly important character in WC3. They could have done a lot more with Ner'Zhul's infuence on Arthas in WoTLK. 
---
It also really, really sucks that they had virtually nothing to do with the Nerubians and Anub'Arak. They had some, but really not nearly enough considering that most of what was in Northrend prior to the arrival of Ner'Zhul was the Nerubian empire.
---
My second-favorite line from WC3 is:
---
**Nerubians**: The traitor king!  
---
**Arthas**: Who, me?  
---
**Anub'Arak**: They are referring to me, Death Knight.  
---
That brief exchange did such a fantastic job of hinting at how much story this strange land had before Arthas arrived. 
---
Plus, for many of us during the WC3 campaign since Arthas was getting weaker and weaker we leaned on Anub'Arak to be our main hero and buffed him up so he was doing a ton of work. To have him just be another forgotten dungeon boss, like Kael'Thas and especially lady Vasj, was such a disservice.
---
Maybe they‚Äôll allow transfers for a very very short period. They might have an overpopulation problem, and what better way to handle it then to open an rpvp server, and say in 1 week you can transfer here from these servers.
---
Is he okay with it?
---
Retail raids are so much more complex than vanilla, "dont stand in the fire "
---
No, could you make a video about it?
---
Which item set was available in 1.12?
---
That's probably the one we will get in classic.
---
For a few classes, yes.  
---
If AQ 40, then all classes.
---
&lt;3 this post.
---
&gt; Private server elitists or vanilla-only elitists are  going to be a  thing this time around, pretending as if vanilla content is difficult  and if you don't have the proper race/spec/gear/consumables you  shouldn't be invited 
---
I don't think they're pretending Vanilla content is hard. The reason they're tryharding is because of two reasons:
---
1. Everything is piss easy for them, so clear times is the next step in being 'good' or 'better' than other people, at the game. Pure competitiveness.
---
2. They enjoy other parts of the game much more than raiding, but raiding gear is actually needed for PvP as well. So cutting clear times in half, compared to people not trying, is a win for them, so they can do whatever they enjoy the most, more.
---
how long do the skeletons stay?
---
It‚Äôs one per region, though. If they realize in day 1, that the demand is monstrously higher than they thought, then I hope they have an immediate plan to open rpvps for each region.
---
It's gonna be EZ mode now.  MC cleared with 20 guys in blues
---
Yea, meant JoW sorry, and JoW ads a fuckton of dps, every shadow bolts you, essentially, get one free, that's a lot of time not spent globals not spent on life tapping, which means the lock gets in more damage spells and the healers get in more damage spells, same with frostbolt, less time spent evocating and drinking, for a hunter who spends 540 mana per cycle, yet has 5 hits in that cycle it essentially HALVES his mana usage, again leading to less drinking.
---
Now look at that across the whole raid.
---
Just came here to say this video was absolutely hilarious.
---
If I understand it correctly this means some items that drop in scholo etc will outscale several early raid drops? Kinda sucks to finally get into MC just to pass on all the gear because you already have better stuff.
---
&gt; Will the Alliance have a place in my Hearth, together with the horde ? Or they cant coexist ? :T
---
Yes, they can coexist. Many players have grown up and got more mature. Many people have played both factions at some point. We're not thirteen anymore where you passionly hated every player of the other factions and actually believed the stigmas against them, which, obviously, also existed the other way around. As you can see in this thread, a lot of people are either memeing or are genuinely still in the mindset of a child. Speaking of stigmas, most of these people seem to be Horde players.
---
One thing you should know though: Horde got shafted in vanilla because Blizzard ran out of time for content and they did all the Alliance zones, quests, stories etc first. I'm not making this up, there are enough interview with Jeff Kaplan or other old devs to confirm this.
---
For example, as I recall, the Onyxia attunement quest is really awesome. Spoilers: &gt;!During the Alliance's quest chain, you have to confront Lady Prestor at some point, who is Onyxia in disguise that infiltrated Stormwind. While the horde just goes out and kills some random Dragons in the world. So as Alliance, it makes sense why you have to go to Onyxia's Lair and kill her.!&lt;
---
That's just one thing of many. And that's coming from someone who played only Horde during TBC and WotLK. Going with Alliance this time around to keep things fresh and because I like the cities more, like way more. Iron Forge is just a master piece, and you'll spend a lot of time in it - compared to TBC/WotLK, where the main city was the faction-neutral Shattrath/Dalaran, so you had some escape from Orgrimmar.
---
However, that's just my opinion. In the end, it comes down to whatever you like more.
---
I don't make videos.
---
The way Blizzard explains their plans, all items will be available from the start in their 1.12 versions except the R10 PvP set, which will be in its original form because when these items were upgraded in later patches, they were replaced with new items instead of changing the stats of existing items.
---
There's two problems here:
---
1) If that's the way it goes live, the R10 PvP set will be trash when all other gear in the game has 1.12 stats
---
2) The R13 PvP set will be the best gear in the game (for the specs that it's suited for) from Phase 2 until Phase 5. It's the best gear in the game until AQ40, but available before BWL opens.
---
Livin' up to that username. Proud of you, son
---
/world is world defense channel.
---
pservers are so poorly executed that enable it as a global chat channel. it's supposed to be "x is under attack" only.
---
&gt; one must be able to assume that they just weren't clear about their intentions with the PvP sets.
---
I think you are the only one that isn't clear on it.  They are only putting 1.12 versions of gear in.
---
What the fuck are you on about? No. Absolutely not. That's not how it works.
---
The best option we have at the moment is to have the community organize and choose one realm (per region) that a lot of hardcore rpvp will band together and try to influence.
---
For example, moon guard isn‚Äôt any different than other rp servers. But the community has made it what it is, *that* server.
---
But, honestly, i just hope Blizz realizes their mistake when the demand is waaaaay higher than they thought, and they don‚Äôt wait a week to launch one. More like a day is appropriate.
---
Moongard, Goldshire: This is healthy.
---
Can you show that movie of the 'mechanics'? I doubt it's off the Nost core and/or from one of the most popular servers out there. These servers are 'objectively' famous/popular, because of what the community consider good scripting.
---
On top of that, it's a open source project, so the community can report bugs and improvements, which leads to things getting fixed faster.
---
Not only was this post clear that the pvp rewards will be in their final state, they explicitly stated that the pvp rewards will be in their final state in a previous blue post. 
---
If you compare the first version of the pvp epics to the updated version they are extremely underwhelming. They are just shitty versions of bwl gear. There would be almost no incentive to rank if that were the case. Having a few no life neckbeards get gear better than anything else available for a couple months is better than having a terrible pvp system that also has underwhelming rewards. 
---
If you‚Äôre worried about the people putting in a couple thousand hours having better gear than you for a while you should also be worried about people that get lucky and get thunderfury/sulfuras because those items are op too.
---
&gt;You find looking stuff up boring
---
Compared to the thrill of discovery? Yes. 
---
Its always more fun to figure things out on your own (or at least try to first) before being told how to do something. 
---
Its why so many people play games like dark souls without guides. 
---
I suppose you don't like watching movies because they're boring and take 2 hours when you can read a plot synopsis in 2min.
---
dont forget that retails abilities are much more complex and need A LOT more computing, a modern make doing the rotation and hitting multiple targets would cause much more stress on a server than maybe 20 vanilla mages
---
Keep in mind that of the 4 epics that drop each week on Rag, only 2 can be BRE, not 4. So yeah, even if theres a 5% chance that each of those 2 epics are BRE, thats still veeeeeeeeery low chance of seeing numerous BREs.

Is it possible to just download vanilla wow without the expansions or do I have to download all of it?

There is no 1.12 version of the blue PvP set. It was replaced in 1.11 with a different set, different items with new names. The blue set does not get upgraded, it gets replaced with other items. As such, the way Blizzard lays out their plan, the blue PvP set is the only thing in the game that is progressive. Meanwhile, the R13 set will have T2.5-equivalent stats but becomes available before BWL even opens.
---
All this classic hype... I think I‚Äôm gonna pre
---
RIP WCM
---
Well yeah, to some extent. Vanilla‚Äôs an entire MMO that has to be recreated almost completely, which is on a significantly larger level than any of their remasters or anything alike they‚Äôve done in the past.
---
If it isn't in 1.12, why would you think it was in at all?
---
At lv 40 you could run as a shockadin.  
---
But really you only need 10pts(pushback immunity) but go for 11.
---
Concecrate is in holy tree.  11pts down 
---
I always go for it first.  
---
Then retribution rest.  
---
Gives you more str cast pushback immunity when casting heals. And a aoe.  Perfect at lv20
---
By lv51 you could go protadin 11/31/0 aoe ing melee mobs. There is a few mobs that are ud and grouped without casters.  Shield with spike, concecrate, bos, holy shield, holy wrath. rips them apart.  
---
Recap
---
Go just 11 pts down in holy.  It‚Äôs enough for leveling.
---
Lmao.  Such a smart ass.  (Not complaining)
---
Holy shit that's hilariously cruel. When I read the word infernal I assumed it was the usual killing bank alts but I've never heard of anyone doing what you did, that's pretty creative.

This is why it's stupid as hell. They're trying to make it black and white, when it clearly can't be the case.  
---
Some items were updated because they were shit - but a lot of items were updated because it was needed as a catch-up mechanic for AQ 40 and Naxxramas.
---
Rank 12-14 gear was upgraded to match the AQ40 gear. If it was meant to be super fucking overpoweed for the current content like what's going to happen now, the rank 12-14 gear should have been better than Naxxramas gear back then.
---
I enjoy his voice and I think he is very good at punctuation. He doesn't have a low pitch or a wide range of tone but he makes up for it in his speeches. He can write some dope ass videos and knows when to pause/flow with his words. Also I love him.

Should've gone for the gnomes tho. Would be funny if you just ignored the dwarves and went exclusively for the gnomes.

It was added pretty late

 "That‚Äôll change once phase 2 rolls around and we add the Honor System,  which will introduce Honorable Kills, Dishonorable Kills, and PvP Rank  Rewards. The items you earn from the PvP Rank Rewards will be the  versions from patch 1.12. "

Why exactly do you want something that's already easy, to be even easier?

That's because it's always clear that Asmongold is playing a character and Esfand is just being himself.

Travel times???? You are killing it lately with these tools :)

It's the first part that I quoted at the top of the thread, taken from the main thread about spell batching, taken from a blue post.
---
#IF IT ISN'T IN 1.12, WHY WOULD YOU THINK IT WAS IN AT ALL?
---
OP posted an excellent point and people don't even read. Old and upgraded blue PvP pieces are indeed totally different items meaning they have different item ids but the epic versions use same ids. Going by Blizzard's own rules that would indeed mean blue PvP set will be unupgraded while the epic set would have upgraded stats. Doing that would be simply retarded though so there's hope.
---
Ret is better than enhancement by a decent margin
---
If you're going to post your own content to this sub, please don't refer to yourself in the third person. I think this is very pretentious and self-important.
---
The average player is much more interested in actually being good at the game, because the average player is actually trying hard at online/competitive games, much more than back then. About any online game you play these days have guides made for them, because people actually read and follow them, and because people figure out these days much faster than back then, because, again, there's a audience for it.
---
We'll have to see, but I think the population that is still playing the game (both retail and privates) has gotten more min/max-y over time.
---
On retail you've got the rise of simming and log sites (the first necessary because of the shit gear systems making nothing memorable or BiS, the second giving millions a "target" and a "race" to get purple/orange parses.
---
Plus stuff like raider.io and streaming (more eyeballs on the top 1% creates copycats).
---
On the private side of things the concept of "pre-raid BiS" and "BiS lists" for the current content patch/phase is way more prevalent than it used to be. People say they're pre-bis or T# bis *constantly* when looking for a guild or a raid pug (or being a raid pug looking for people).
---
A lot more than 1% of people will see Naxx this time around. I think the audience has changed, even if there will be a significant number of people that quit long ago and never came back until Classic.
---
It won't be a majority, but a huge number of people will feel that pressure as soon as they realize how broken pvp gear is.
---
I played on a RP-PvP server for over a decade.
---
That‚Äôs just incorrect.
---
rent is rising they are getting desperate
---
That question still doesn't make sense. "It" what? Which of the two sets are you talking about? Your question doesn't match what I've been saying.
---

---
Read the spell. The seal itself only gives mana from autoattacks, but the judgement gives mana from spell casts. JoW is a huge dps improvement, especially for mages going oom on long fights.
---
They haven‚Äôt said that. 
---
Literally the quote - ‚Äúrealm sharding is one of the best tools we have to keep realms stable when hundreds of players are swarming the same initial few zones and killing the same few mobs (like they will be at the launch of Classic). To that end, we do believe that some form of sharding may be helpful, especially in those early days.‚Äù
---
Initial few zones. Stormwind is in Elwynn and will obviously be a high population area.
---
&gt; Compared to the thrill of discovery? Yes.
---
Is the *possiblity* of the thrill of discovery worth sinking thousands of hours into trying to discover something a bunch of people couldn't manage to discover for months despite actively discussing and testing?
---
&gt; Its why so many people play games like dark souls without guides.
---
In Dark Souls you get pretty much instant feedback when you do something, here you wont get that for many many hours and you need to actively put effort into getting said feedback.
---
&gt; I suppose you don't like watching movies because they're boring and take 2 hours when you can read a plot synopsis in 2min.
---
Because it's not about the tedium, only about the duration, right?
---
&gt; There is no 1.12 version of the blue PvP set
---
Then it won't be in the game.  Period.  Why are you so confused?
---
Echoing this. I have faith in the classic team!
---
Having time before BGs officially launch gives Blizz time to make that decision later based on server populations. Hopefully they don‚Äôt go with cross-realm because from my perspective cross-realm BGs killed the close-knit feel of Vanilla PvP
---
Actually it's because raids as designed encourage if not require extreme specialization-. Therefore hybrid specs will simply be at a disadvantage from the start.  It's not class design, it's encounter design.  Hybrids are generally pretty good in 5 man's where there are few enough players that overlap between roles is nice to have, and moreso in PVP obviously.  Plus, they're a blast during the most fun part of the game- gearing up before raids.
---
Please don't mess with hybrid balance.    No one owes anyone a raiding ret or boomkin spec.  The game was not balanced around raiding, and PVP was not balanced around duels.
---
Then what was even the point in the first place? 
---
Class was irrelevant, spec was irrelevant, the only relevant portion was left out: that the person was shitty beyond belief.
---
This response is so uninformed. For example do you not know we're getting progressive itemization? I really want to know whether you do or not because this answer is just so stupid and inaccurate to me.
---

---
LAN party pranks are like 80% of the fun of a LAN. Those were the days.
---
The battle groups seem fine to me.  I used to have a lvl 19 twink and even with battle groups I remember some of the best.  My paladin was named like toasted or something and the biggest rivalries I had were from multiple servers.  Aggi was this lvl 10 dodge twink that took forever for me to escape from or kill.  Faster que times is worth it because you can still create those relationships.
---
How exactly do you know it will be trivial for everybody? It wasn't back then. Private server people can't be measured because a) we don't know if the values are correct and b) most of those players are tryhards (or were forced to be).
---
If they released Molten Core with items having their original values, pretty much all caster and healing loot wouldn't have +healing or +damage. 
---
Tanks wouldn't be able to reach defense cap.
---
Melee would do less damage overall.
---
Even if we were to say that it changes nothing for any raids whatsoever, there are countless of other points to be made as to why this is bad for the game. The only response I've heard for those in favor of this change is that "it's too difficult and annoying to read up on items and save them for when X patch hits". Really?
---
I don't see how making the game easier is good.
---
I don't see why it's good that the fastest speedruns will be decided by whoever has the most rank 14s and not by whoever has the best coordination and skill combined.
---
I don't see why it's good for the game that we won't be seeing a bunch of exciting changes when each phase drops in regards to gear.
---
I don't see why it's good for the game that epic items won't feel epic.
---
I don't see why it's good for the game that this change will make dungeons become obsolete forever once Pre-BiS set has been obtained.
---
It exists in the database. Its stats aren't upgraded in 1.12. A different set is added to the game in 1.11. The way Blizzard explained their plans, they're giving all items their final (1.12) stats, but items only  become available in the patch that originally added them.
---
If that applies to the PvP sets, we will be able to get the patch 1.4 version of the blue PvP set and the patch 1.11 version of the epic set. That would be beyond absurd and completely change the entire fabric of the game's PvP environment, both because it makes the blue set trash and the epic set equal to AQ40 gear but available in Phase 2.
---
A lot of other people will be at work and as such not subject to pvp. I suspect rank 14 will take longer to achieve given most of the player base will only be around on weekends.  Overall OP pvp  gear will have less of an impact on the game.
---
I don't know the exact timeframe, but I think it may be some number of hours (maybe 4-6??). I don't recall ever seeing a skeleton from the day before on the live servers.
---
That's because flying mounts made rogues pathetic for ganking and you never realised that true master class of ganking had transitioned over to AP/Pom pyro mages who could slow fall and gank people mid air.
---
&gt; No need to stir up hate.
---
No need, but it just feels so damn good.
---
Ya man I agree, I go for good enough as well and if I get something off "the" pre-bis then great.
---
Dang, if this guy is outright sociopathic I'm not sure I'd even want to know what you'd call those of us who've done worse.
---
Let me hide columns
---
Ya'll bunch of salty people for no damn reason.  Don't watch their content if you don't want to.  Obviously people enjoy it or they wouldn't have views on them.
---
Right? 
---
I raided in Vanilla and TBC, Shaman healer for Vanilla, Hunter for TBC. 
---
There are *so many* doing poorly on the DPS meters! Who are not living up to the potential of their class. A good player with an off-spec can absolutely be viable, if those people could.
---
While I was leading DPS meters in TBC, the other hunters were stuck somewhere in the middle. While I was fighting for top 3 with two rogues, two more were lagging somewhere in the middle. A lot of it is the person.
---
Of course there are exceptions. An enhancement Shaman just doesn't have the scaling, for instance, and an Elemental Shaman doesn't have the mana. 
---
Elem worked out in PvP mainly because of the utility you could provide if you were bservant and quick, but also for the ability to nuke the shit outta people, but I digress.
---
Hmm TIL
---
Always thought it was just AAs
---
If it was added in 1.11, and still available in 1.12, then it is "the 1.12 version".  End of story.  They aren't going to back and fine tune pieces of gear outside what they were when 1.12 was live.
---
&gt; will mean that the blue set is hot garbage while the epic set is BiS until AQ40.
---
So?
---
The problem is finding someone willing to Holyweave. It's a terrible spec for about anything else and it's just a worse Shadow Spec and/or healing spec for PvP, meanwhile Shadow is top-tier and generally enjoyable. 
---
Moonkin is subpar for about everything, since Druid mostly play the same way across all 3 specs, and the classic resto spec is generally regarded as the best PvP spec, since you're playing like a Feral/Moonkin, slowly killing people, but your survivablity is much better.
---
Even most top guilds on private servers take into account if people actually want to play the spec, unless someone suddenly jumps into their lap and have no problem with playing a spec being subpar at everything else than raiding. The same way you don't see many top guilds using the Fury dual-wield Warrior tanking build, which does good damage and insane threat, even on encounters/raids where the MT is at no risk of dying.
---
Dude you can't give specific numbers and then say don't pay attention to them.
---
I dont see the downside. If you make the realms either they are a little niche community that is happy and doesnt bother anyone else or they blow up and you make more.
---
I'm excited for the grind. It'll be rewarding and I'll have to put in effort and thought to level. Maybe I'm just masochistic.....
---
1. That's fine for the top 10% of raiders.. those looking to be doing speedruns aren't the ones here picking boomkins, they're picking wars/rogues/mages/priests etc.
---
2. That's true.. and you won't find me complaining about a change the PvP system so that there are instanced rates BGs without gear imbalances.
---
Basically crossrealm group-queue-only rated BGs with gear vendors that only work in those rbgs, that give zero rewards other than a skill rating. Then the serious PvPers can work for their skill rating in a fair setting and it doesn't impact the real gameworld
---
Scythe of Elune IS vanilla lore. Just do the Sven quests in Duskwood. Also, and this is from pure memory, I think Draenei were introduced before The Broken ever were. ‚ÄúRise of the Horde,‚Äù which is very good by the way, was published in 2006.
---
&gt; an hour
---
There would be like 500 people there probably. An hour might be generous.
---
I personally wouldn't upgrade VE to 30%, there are more powerful points in Disc to improve mana efficiency or mana burn which is nice for a couple encounters and for PvP. Naxx raid stats show that they do like &gt;60% on average compared to a pure DPS caster.
---
The thing with a holy/shadow hybrid is that he shouldn't have time to apply the debuff at all. If your holy/shadow has time to keep the stacks up then you just brought too many healers. An Spriest heals his group and deals decent damage at the same time.
---
In my eyes it is always a win if you fill the Spriest spot with someone who is *dedicated* and have enough warlocks to fill a group + the Spriest (4-5 total).
---
Spriest itemization is quite different from other casters and kind of specific. They don't need +crit, they dont need +hit as much as any other caster. So they can itemize purely via +damage and int/spirit/mp5. This opens up for a more support oriented gearing style. For example items like Headmasters Charge are really good on them early on. And more importantly they don't compete for the same gear as most other casters since they profit more from stats and just spelldamage. Meaning the dungeon set pieces, the PvP set pieces and the AQ pieces for example are really good on them, which lowers gear competition inside a guild.
---
It is basically the same reason why you want a feral druid, a dagger rogue etc. If gearing is something that is planned in a "guild first" kind of way then they really soak up stuff that others don't need, which makes everything smoother.
---
I did not say "roleplay".
---
make them feel like a friend and not a body lol
---
[This one always gets me hyped](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
---
I really hope the guy brings it back its super useful because it helps with finding out when gear will be added and in which patch. Their will still be certain pieces of loot being added in at different phases which is whats important.
---
&gt;You'll be able to raid as ret, feral, or whatever. There will be guilds who welcome those specs.
---
When guilds are consistently running 40-mans with less than 40 players, it should be obvious to anyone anyone will be welcome as long as they aren't draining healer mana. 
---
Stay out of the fire, and you'll find a guild that welcomes you.
---
You could have no talent points selected and raid in vanilla as long as you aren't actually licking windows while waiting for a side of lead paint chips.
---
&gt; That's fine for the top 10% of raiders.. those looking to be doing  speedruns aren't the ones here picking boomkins, they're picking  wars/rogues/mages/priests etc. 
---
Which is my point, there's nothing wrong with not wanting Boomkins, if the purpose of the raid is to get it done as smooth as possible in a decent/good time.
---
&gt; That's true.. and you won't find me complaining about a change the PvP  system so that there are instanced rates BGs without gear imbalances. 
---
That's fair if you want that. I don't think that's ever going to happen, since I personally think that's one of the main draws for a lot of people. If they worked/got lucky/whatever for better gear, they deserve to be able to have that edge against other people.
---
There are so many streamers that have influence though. The first week will be hell. Shroud/Summit/Sodapoppin each ALONE is enough to bring almost any game to the front page of twitch. Now imagine those three + the dozens of other huge streamers I think it's going to break twitches record of most viewers on a single game
---
As someone who wants to be a pally main but horde since tbc.... Am torn

I remember that one. Really gives me the vanilla vibes
---
How do you know? Who is the guy who runs this?
---
&gt; If it was added in 1.11, and still available in 1.12, then it is "the 1.12 version". End of story. 
---
That all depends on whether or not they choose to make an exception for this one segment of items. There are no other items in the game that share this trait. The blue PvP set is the one and only thing that is **replaced with different items** instead of having the stats on it changed. That means there is no 1.12 version. A different set is introduced in 1.11, during Naxx.
---
Do you understand?
---
Blue PvP set: not upgraded, replaced with different set, therefore the "good" version will not be available in Classic until Naxx
---
Epic PvP set: upgrades stats of same items, therefore available from the beginning of the Classic PvP system
---
&gt; So?
---
I've already explained the problems of making gear with stats equal to T2.5 (AQ40) available in Phase 2 (MC, two tiers before AQ40). Surely you can understand that. If not, I give up.
---
Just watched his video, and he did complain a bit, but he gave the Devs credit. Basically said he's disappointed that he's going to end up not updating his weapon slot for like a year after getting bonereavers edge because it's bis until aq40, but feels like they addressed about 80% of the itemization properly. It was an overall positive video, with a little bit of disappointment.
---
Onyxia wipe animation
---
This post did change things. Before this blue post there had been *No Official* word on if items would be Pre 1.10 stats prior to the Phase 5 patch when the items from 1.10+ will be added. 
---
Now we know 100% that all items in the game on launch will be 1.12 itemization. Then once Phase 5 hits the only thing changing is they are adding some more dungeon gear (Things like Idols for Druids, Mantle of Lost Hope, etc.) and moving some drops around. Itemization still being the 1.12 version of those items.
---
I had two discontinued vanilla swords on my second or third toon. It's a dead realm though. Probably will never sell
---
Badass man. Plan to do any other cities?
---
I see no reason why 1 point in healing light is ever gonna be better than consecration. It can be valuable for lvling and pvp. Even in scenarious where you group up for a quest, you can just pop RF, a 1hand plus shield and aoe everything much quicker by keeping aggro and dealing some damage.
---
I believe they will have upgraded lvl 60 blue pvp set from start. And I am a big SUPPORTER of this, though I‚Äôve seen some people unhappy about it. As someone who truly loves pvp, and wishes to pvp most of his time due to inability to conform to a set raiding schedule, this allows me to actually gain gear that would make me competitive overall in WoW. It will be very difficult to reach R10 to get full set. And I highly disliked being forced to raid PvE, just to be competitive in PvP back in the day. A lot of people are complaining about pvp items being on par with BWL items, but there is gear that is from MC that is BIS till Naxx as well. Before you COULD NOT be super competitive in pvp unless you had PvE gear, now it allows for pvp‚Äôers to remain in their own realm.
---
after trying to research what class to play ither warlock or paladin i have come to the conclusion that ret paladins are both overpowered and barely viable in pvp
---
Man, it's like I've seen this like a thousand times.. but this time it really got to me... must be because we're that close to launch.
---
If itemization.info was still up, I could tell you... but it's not.
---
One thing that comes to mind is Ban'thok Sash, which [was a terrible green at some point](https://web.archive.org/web/20041104221513/http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=11662) until [it had +hit and +dmg on a belt slot pre-raid](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11662). I don't think it even had any pre-raid competition after the buff.
---
I was thinking more like ‚Äòwhat‚Äôs my age again‚Äô
---
&gt; That all depends on whether or not they choose to make an exception for this one segment of items. 
---
They have already said they weren't.
---
&gt; The blue PvP set is the one and only thing that is replaced with different items instead of having the stats on it changed.
---
So now we're back to what I said earlier.  If it doesn't exist in 1.12, then it won't be in Classic in any form.  It'll be gone, and the "different items" will be there instead.  Why are you so confused by this?
---
&gt; A different set is introduced in 1.11, during Naxx.
---
This different set still existed when the 1.12 patch rolled out I presume?  Well then, now you know what set will be in, don't you?
---
Imagine looting an item and before you roll on it, there's no wowhead to check how the item will change with the upcoming patches and then decide if one version of that item is worth rolling for.
---
healing and bubble is OP on a paladin.

But that is balanced by everything else about them being fucking terrible.

Yeah pretty sure. I remember doing that chain one day and just loving it

My brother and I would make the 40 minute bus ride to the nearest Best Buy in a rough neighborhood to purchase these. Can't believe we did it as kids.
---
Damn, you're really grasping at straws.
---
Nice try Blizzard. I‚Äôm not resubbing early just to check my bags.
---
figured as much. STV was pretty much carpeted with skeletons on a pserver. very weird looking.
---
TWO! Nothing wrong with me!
---
Well first off look at classic RuneScape. I have always loved that game and it shows how you can take an old game and deviate from the original path and I hope blizzard took notes on how to do it.
---
I mean I never asked what you would do, nor did I ever care what you would do. I just said feral and ret are comparable and there is not definitive proof they aren't
---
They are OP in situations where any other class would do just fine.
---
They are barely viable in the same sense because whats strong about them is their healing and literal ability to go immune to damage at any point in time and keep healing with nothing to stop them from doing so.
---
Bear in mind, private server boss damage and resistance values are all based on guesswork and largely based on early work by Mangos developers that erred on the side of making things easier.
---
If Blizzard are working off the original codebase, dungeons and raids *should* be considerably more difficult than the private server experience.
---
Because people make it difficult. If you have troubles picking flavors of ice cream you have torubles making decisions in general, you're going to have troubles picking a class. It honestly is as easy as asking yourself what you want to do (to,heal,DPS) and look up the prospective classes of each sub category and pick the one you think would suit you. There's no wrong choice. It's a video game after all it's supposed to be fun!
---
I've long decided I'd redo my Troll Resto Shaman for a hardcore raiding experience. Now its just a question of whether or not I roll on a PvP server or not. I've never done it before, so it'd be different. The danger, the world pvp skirmishes, the tighter bond the community has because of this, etc; all seem super compelling. 
---
But I dislike the idea of while leveling... just being ganked by some passing level 60, or some NEET or kid who has nothing better to do but stay in lower level zones and just gank.
---
Calm down princess. They don‚Äôt owe you anything.
---
*Right click reporting
---
And today they've explained that items will have their final stats, but will become available in the patch that originally added them to the game. They have not elaborated on the fact that unlike all other items in the game, the update to the blue PvP set do not consist of adjustments to the stats of the items but rather the addition of a new set in 1.11.
---
[Original 1.4 set](http://classicdb.ch/?item=16433)
---
[New 1.11 set](http://classicdb.ch/?item=23272)
---
There are two possible interpretations:
---
1) They will make an exception for the blue PvP gear and make the 1.11 sets available from the start, even though all other items added after launch will not be in Classic until the patch that added them
---
2) They will give us the 1.12 version of the original blue PvP set, which never changed and therefore has its original 1.4 stats in patch 1.12. When all other items in the game have their 1.12 stats, this makes the blue PvP set nearly worthless.
---
That's because we know the game, and we're going to play it!
---
I don‚Äôt think they meant that as a metric for how many people they think will be at launch.... I think they are just playing it smart as once you put in a server, you can‚Äôt get rid of it.  
---
If for whatever reason let‚Äôs say 500,000 people started at launch and it dropped to 50,000 within a year they would be in deep water if they started with way too many servers.
---
i dare you to make a seperate post saying other more new mmos are better at pve than classic
---
I really enjoy those private server made hype trailers for raid releases. Ther should be a full mc-&gt;naxx one. Really well made too!

As a long time hunter and a long time raid leader, we're pretty optimal. Leading (debuff callouts, coordinating multiple group movements, LITERALLY RESPONDING TO WHISPERS MID-FIGHT) will often distract from perfect execution and it's not like the raid is losing 1k dps if we're not on point.   
---
This of course will be modified if we actually have to DO something, like kiting during Razorgore or Gluth. But since MOST fights are "stand here and shoot" for ranged classes, it makes the most sense to have the least impactful DPS take the hardest hit of distraction.
---
What does that say? Fuck I wish I could read
---
Molten Core is going to be an absolute cakewalk until Rag and people who can only play a couple of nights a week could clear BWL. People have way more knowledge about how to play well and there will be a 10-minute video somewhere explaining how to raid with your class.
---
People really sucked back in vanilla and 40 competent raiders from this era could smash through the older raids.
---
who cares?
---
Do you honestly think that mass right click reporting will be a widespread "tactic" on classic to "meta pvp" your competition?
---
"oof" - Me probably, summer 2019
---
I remember this. I would save my allowance and made sure I had enough to buy a time card
---
Getting a legendary; Atiesh in particular. And if I never get it, at least it would be a fun run!
---
Ten years will go by. The year is at the decade of the 2030s:
---
Remaining players on the few remaining servers still playing and proud of what's left of the community.
---
2040s: By now, everyone recognizes people just play such an old game for the sheer novelty and still have nostalgia of the original launch of Classic, the re-launch of a 14-year-old game. As well as nostalgia for when the game briefly became popular again in the 2030s when a lot of players old and new flocked to it for it's simplicity.
---
I remember how great things were in the 30s. Some still call it the Golden Age of the community. And to think: The game was already 30 years old by then.
---
Half of the comments remind me why I stopped visiting this sub.
---
1.4 has some pretty big buffs to raid loot.
---
it was the patch that removed t2 from MC and into BWL.
---
That's dangerously close to doxxing, so I'm not going to tell out of respect for their privacy
---
We both know it's because you're illiterate
---
The fire rises.
---
BRING BACK THE BARMAN SHANKER. ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
It could be, really depends on what you like. Classic WoW is a totally different game from modern wow. Is say give it a shot :)
---
They already have a system in place for this.
---
Hardcore with progression: Many guild members on with tier gear.
---
Hardcore but new: Many guild members on in greens/blues.
---
The system that lets everyone know how far they've gotten is how much of their clothes match if they are purple while the more detailed and intricate and less clown-like, the farther the progression.
---
Vanilla got along fine without anything else. You know who the hardcore guild is just by watching players walk by in a major city and recognizing them because everyone is inspecting them constantly.
---
Or, you know, ASK SOMEONE. The whole "social" aspect of the game that's missing these days.
---
Compared to yours or just in general? Because it seems that some of the issues the "streamers" and other people that this sub tends to deride have been heard by the Classic team.  
---
So on average, I would guess his opinions are above average in terms of relevancy.
---
If you want to experience a whole world with all the pain of traveling, finding people to work with, communicating with them, and feeling like mistakes have reasonably painful consequences... then yeah Classic WoW is a great experience.
---
If you want to play in 20-30 minute chunks, WoW Classic is significantly more painful.
---
Oh yeah the rep, totally forgot about that.
---
Ninja looter.
---
Im kidding.
---
So you're just gonna raid log in greens then?
---
it's something to do/aim for outside of your weekly clear where you might get 1 item.
---
This is amazing, but I'm afraid it might come as too obscure a reference for most =\[
---
Classic WoW is going to go through all the content of the base version of the game before the first expansion(Burning Crusade)
---
This is a very good time to get into WoW. Classic is bringing back a huge part of the community that has left the game over the years because they were dissatisfied with the direction the game took.
---
Classic is considered ONE of the best eras of the game. Some would say it was the best era of the game.
---
Very good time to get into the game.
---
üíÄüíÄüíÄ His explanation GONE SEXUAL üíÄüíÄüíÄ
---
Is there grinding involved in Classic WOW. For example killing mobs for exp in order to level up.?
---
Dude you could not chose a better time to start a game! Classic is THE WAE.
---
Why does my wand do higher dps by far than it says on the item then? I get regular hits all the time higher than the max damage. It clearly also scales according to charsheet
---
Yo fuck pandas. 
---
"hurr durr I'm a vegan bear that refuses to procreate"
---
fuck pandas. save the sharks.
---
It's not about nust being able to clear it.
---
It's about being able to clear it as fast as possible with little to no wipes.
---
Well they can always wait to play classic then right?
---
This looks awesome! Did you make this OP?
---
Yeah I think that‚Äôs where it seems really fun as well, having to choose which spell to use
---
You gonna pay for that server?
---
The whole game is a grind man. A good chunk of the quests require you to kill mobs. But it's fun to do the quests because you are working towards a goal.
---
Questing and grinding involved.
---
What makes it strenuous healing a main tank? 
---
I suppose that‚Äôs sort of fun being pushed to the limit a little though? And what does making an alt do to make hearing faster?
---
Umm... that post made it real clear we're not getting progressive itemization.
---
We are at this point getting 1.12 as is, so 1.12 warts and all no changes.  Deal with it.
---
The new server infrastructure if they are using gen 9 or 10 blades can handle some serious shit. We beat ours to death in our data center and they take a serious beating without skipping a beat. I bet we will be fine.
---
That's the one!
---
WoW Classic *is* 1.13
---
I was thinking of this one too because it's above the goblin town right? Same general area
---
The original cinematic.
---
i really, really hope there is no Xrealm anything, including BG's. That is one of the magic things about classic. Server communities.
---
Hey does anyone remember El Stampedo? A dwarf paladin. I can't find his pvp videos anywhere and I'd love to show my friend, as he always used to look up to him.
