Oh man, yeah it was!

---
---
Exactly. So if you sub to play classic or sub to play retail they dont really care. The only thing this means for investors are more subs.
---
Needing to look up info absolute plebs
---
Yeah, I agree. It requires a lot of trust and confidence. If you don't have that then loot council falls apart.
---
There's really no danger of warlock and druid being as near as popular as the surveys here suggest.

What is this quest for? Just because it's a great quest?
---
It happens most of the time, plus the servers are running on new hardware, it could happen.
---
Let's hope it doesn't
---
will probably get updated soon, their gm need to send it in
---
If they put all this work into layering, it better do its job...
---
and I've legit never understood why it bothers you so much that someone wants to play a different way than you do.
---
Wow, chills, made my eyes wet... such a good story - thanks for sharing buddy 😁😇
---
Blizzard's gotten really good at launches. I can't speak to BFA, but Legion didn't even require a server restart. The content was just available.

I actually have met a lot of girls in vanilla. 
---
One of the first reasons I got a Myspace actually lol.  She was from Florida and we were both like 16 and she and I would talk all the time. Finally wanted to see what each other looked like.
---
I have 3 sisters so my big thing in life is to not be creepy... which a lot of guys are. As long as you genuinely listen and don't use double entendres.... you're pretty much golden
---
paladins can't use staffs.
---
You guys have friends?
---
oh dear, it appears you're trying to run. let me just chain sheep you/R1 frostbolt as you try.
---
This is why I'm very skeptical of "melee cleave" dungeon groups at low levels. Shaman/warriors can cleave but probably shouldn't and rogues don't cleave at all early. You can certainly run dungeons with melee to level but the idea that it would be like a caster dungeon clear is pretty bogus.
---
Hahahah thanks dude! 
---
Hope to see you all in game
---
Thanks for pointing it out! I forgot about the UBRS somehow. Will get it fixed in next update.
---
What's the name of the app, I have a phobia about clicking random links 😁
---
did you squirt it in her

That's what I'm hoping for. But they also might be underestimating the numbers.

 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zZxTMscbdLVxsofo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zZxTMscbdLVxsofo)  This would be my planned HOTW/NS spec for endgme content. (could change Feral Instinct to Thick Hide but i want to be able to tank in Dunegons/Raids) What do you think?
---
I think I'd really like it if all three could coexist, but I think it would work best if we started with three groups of servers identified as such *now*. Even if they stay identical for all of the Classic content rollout, players can pick the one they're most likely to stick with long term. Unfortunately, it's getting a bit late to announce anything like that up front, and it's totally understandable that they wouldn't want to commit any resources to that just yet.
---
a thaman named sex
---
I doubt it. Legion had more than 5 million on launch day. Classic isn't likely to have significantly more than that, if more than that at all.
---
There almost a nil chance servers are broken. They have had almost flawless releases recently.
---
The app is called "Lost Troll - Classic WoW Maps".

 - About Us - 
---
We are a group of experienced and dedicated players dating back to the initial release of Vanilla WoW. Guild Leaders and Officers are experienced in clearing vanilla content at a fast and competitive pace which will  ultimately be our goal in competing for server firsts. We will also be securing World Bosses and top PvP Rankers on the server.
---
- Raid Schedule - 
---
We will be raiding Tues. and Wed. **7pm-10pm CST** (sometimes  to 11pm during progression) to fully clear content for the week, allowing players to farm, PvP, etc. the rest of the week. Once current raid is on farm we will be raiding and clearing on Tuesday while preparing for the release of the upcoming raid.
---
 - Loot System - 
---
All raid loot will be handled in a fair manner which will benefit the guild the most. Our goal is to optimize and balance the raid in the best way we can to progress at a fast pace. * For loot outside of raids, it is ultimately up to the recipient of the item such as i.e. (Stockade Pauldrons,  Flask Recipes, and any other BiS items or drops that will help the guilds raid progression)* We do advise providing them to the guild in exchange for gold, consumables or other items the recipient needs.

Orc Rogue named 'Glenn'
---
I love ironic names
---
Not that I can recall seeing. There's probably going to be some amount of playing it by ear and pushing the next phase when it seems like the player base is ready for it.
---
Just make sure you rock the mohawk! All the best
---
It was a goblin :]
---
I remember doing boomkin only PvP premades. We kicked fucking ass and it was hilarious.
---
You're not low health as a mage in raids very often. I had a troll mage in tier 3 gear in vanilla. I spent every day regretting not playing undead.
---
A few physical only bosses could be done by rogues staggering their evasion CDs and avoidance tanking, dont have to worry about healing at all and enrage timers too, ex. Patchwerk
---
Right there with you. I have more time because no wife+kids but I'm not going to No-Life this after the first week (it's my birthday week so I'm taking it off anyhow). Ultimately in September Iceborne and Borderlands 3 will be out so I'll just be playing WoW when my friends *aren't* online since they aren't going to be playing Classic.
---
Lets see here. Hunter pet names must be between 2-12 characters.
---
 If I were to roll a hunter 
---
I'd call my pet croc "SixEightTwo" 
---
My wolf would be "NineThreeNine"
---
My Owl would be "ToSevenOThre"
---
My cat would be "EightSixZero"
---
Extremely high.
---
Realistic? Planning to max tailoring and fishing. Maybe cooking.
---
Will try to run some dungeons as a healer with my priest. And would like to be picked up by a group while leveling.
---
0%, layering exists for a reason.
---
Best form of defence is a good offence

Very unlikely. At worst there’ll be queues for a few days. Practically no chance of actual downtime or rollbacks.

I thought about the same but I think I saw somewhere that in early days of wow that when a name was taken it would still remain “taken” 30 days after the character was deleted. I read this somewhere on reddit and now I can’t find where but I know it was on this Sub
---

I ONLY play frost mage i laugh

Then you can kite 2 mobs making sure to only connect with a swing on the kill target while maintaining hamstring on both. Or only cleaving after you've been crit. 
---
Retail or clasaic. There's a lot of little rotational things you can do to separate yourself from an average player. Just depends how hard you wanna go.
---
So therefor it's not all about having fun?

Oh, cool.

The fact this 20 minute swim is still considered a skip pretty much just sealed the deal to not want to roll alliance.

Yea the elves never asked for aliens with demonic ties to come and clear cut their forests, it is the definition of imperialism for the orcs to invade because they need resources, also they bring undead interlopers into their forest, who desecrate night elven lands with plague.
---
Play to fuck!
---
they wont? what
---
Yes I saw that. Which graveyard does it teleport you to? If tested on beta why not use that footage? Was the skip down the mountain also tested on beta?
---
I agree this is a creative and cool idea, Thex!
---
Warlocks haven't got souls. In fact, even when you get them, you constantly lose them.
---
&gt; realistic aims
---
That's not how any of this works.
---
SO T H E C C
---
Beautiful name.
---
Great name, I wish I'd have thought of it.
---
Yeah spirit on everything. No drinking needed.
---
Eh it’s kinda incomparable... other releases are just expansions, people are generally spread out, and generally start with you in an instanced cutscene like quest and when you’re done you have your whole population spread out across the whole new world because of how the questing scaling works.
---
Classic is going to be everyone logging in 6 zones and you aren’t leaving for awhile.  Way more stress.
---
Wow amazing name!
---
Would the dps be able to beat enrage timers? Lol
---
I plan on being on the loot council and sure, ill take meme specs if we can't fill the raid. But they will never get any loot any of the real specs want. And if any of the real specs want something for their offspec, they get prio over memespecs for that too.
---
Ok that's actually a great name
---
There won't be 5 milion. There's also a bit of a difference between running a game with a rag tag group of fans, and running it from a company that is already hosting millions of players right now.
---
It’s gotta be mobile.  I see nothing on there that’s not 100+ days old.  I’ll figure it out.
---
You are why we cant have nice things.
---
if you spend your time in dungeons to get geared you can beat a lot of classes in 1v1 around level 30-60
---
This is the EPIC warlock and Pally Duo leveling spec.
---
Its also great for tanking dungeons.
---
If only paladins got a taunt they would be golden. Still that AoE threat gen in massive.
---
But my name is Thex so HA.
---
I wouldn't worry about weapons too much. Enchants on gear are more useful in my opinion since like you said weapon dps is such a big part.

---
I have no idea. I don't think there has been a lot of motivation to test it, as of course hunters are the best solo questing class, and I just don't know what a hunter's dps is like when they can never drink or otherwise regen mana. It might be great, it might be terrible. 
---
I have heard lots of speculation, but nothing worth repeating yet.
---
You ain't getting realm first 60.
---
Huh. I kill the ones that try be pussies and make overt signs of friendship, but if someone has big dick energy and just ignores my presence then I let them live.

I didn't say Nost had a good launch. Other PS have tho. Also nost was playable the first WEEK for crying out loud. 
---
&gt; This is the first time blizzard is launching a vanilla server in 14 years.
---
Ehh it's not technically vanilla. They are using an updated client to run it all. They are also already hosting games with millions of players right now. I can see the first day being bad, but a whole week? That would be unbelievable to me.

I can smell how much better you are than this pleb from here. Literally smell it.

Flex mode peepopog
---
It was meant as a general thing. Not to you directly
---
I thought about that too.  I wouldn’t be surprised if Blizzard didn’t give them special treatment.  Streamers were damn near the only ones to get Beta access after all.
---
I'm just excited that things will go \*wrong\* in dungeons. Granted I only made it to the mid 40s recently on retail but I can't recall ever feeling challenged, especially not as a healer. I was DPSing half the time anyways just to give us a little boost.  
---
For me WoW is at its best when the unexpected situations produce opportunities for actual creative play. Breaking your optimal rotation to save your buddy with a clutch Blind or something. From what I saw on Retail it's just not that difficult, no matter what goes wrong.
---
I don't even want to know...
---
We'll see if I can snag it on naming day. I'm hoping I can. I have some back-ups though. Hose, Spiggot, ETC.
---
Just gotta be some kind of water-expelling thing for it to work.
---
Sometimes. SOMETIMES. The first 60 is a druid. That being said, Orcs get a bonus to pet damage and a DPS CD so they seem like the best pick. If you mean Alliance specifically I can only really see Stoneform being helpful for leveling and even that is pretty situational.
---
Yeah it’s my mobile.  It’s all there on pc ty ty man.
---
Actually speaking to other people and grouping up to complete quests.
---
Why not? My friend is going to assist me somewhat and the character is going to have 24/7 uptime until 60
---
This and everybody seems to be planning on "getting ahead of the pack" so I wonder just how competitive leveling is going to be for a while.
---
Yes trade 1g pls

#  &lt;Lifers&gt; NA (CST/EST) - Alliance - PVP - Hardcore
---
**&lt;Lifers&gt;** (new guild formed from members of **Alixium**) is a new long term hard core guild with ties to strong groups of active players and roots to the beginnings of classic wow, both private and retail. We am seeking more like minded individuals who are looking to create a well structured raiding guild, permanently. Individuals should aspire to be an extremely active player and remain extremely active most times as a normal raider. **Past classic experiences are not required for membership** but are required for an officer position.
---
Officers will be held to a more active playing schedule than an already extremely active raider. This means things like leveling multiple characters, having multiple accounts, always being prepared for themselves and others, being way ahead of the curve in content and gear, being extremely active and competitive in pvp and consistent with community communications.
---
Strong PvE focus and are setting up premade groups for Rank 14.
---
We are wanting to have a huge guild to form 3 Raid groups (120+ members) and plan to clear MC by the 3rd-4th week. We are pushing for server 1sts for BWL progression and above.
---
Raid times **(T/W/Th)** will be active from **7p-12a EST**. **The first raid** will be from 7pm - 10:00p and **the 2nd will be**scheduled for **9:00p - 12:00 midnight**. **3rd Raid group is TBA**
---
Server selection will be either Central or Eastern.

---
Im 31 and wow is my life.
---
The first 60 is going to be one of the ones that 3+ people are leveling around the clock - likely a Warrior because the Main Tank is really the only one that needs time at 60 to gear up for a week one Ragnaros kill.
---
Damn near 100%.
---
Don’t forget the canceled the final stress test.
---
Because internet. Iam not attacking you. Iam your friend.
---
Reminds me of a joke where a warri called mage, a mage called priest and a priest called warri go raiding.
---
I mean the first big red flag is you asking this question openly on reddit.
---
Second would be you don't have any army of people to help you.
---
Thirdly would be you haven't actually ever done a speed run to 60.
---
No chance. Just don't do anything dumb (irl or otherwise) chasing after something you won't realistically achieve.
---
Thank you!
---
Yeah fuck those guys for having fun in a videogame amirite.
---
For some nostalgia, checkout the original [Blue Plz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFIW0EXGLfc)
---
Weapon procs do not proc for druids in cat or bear form, since you are hitting with a built-in claw weapon.  However, stat buffs on weapons *do* apply, such as agility.
---
Awesome work man
---
I enjoyed reading this.
---
Its quite amusing people are still re'ing over streamer servers.
---
It still matters in the sense that it can dictate how Blizzard-Activision moves forward in the future.
---
I think the point he's trying to make is that it will be VERY difficult to tag all those mobs amidst the mad rush early on. This thought is why some people are going to do the fedex strat at start
---
If we still have access then...
---
If you have to ask you aren't going to be realm first 60.  But probably orc since bm is the "leveling" spec.
---
Orcs DPS CD doesn’t help hunters so much. As it’s melee AP only in classic.
---
Yeah. It's pretty neat. This is really new territory. On ebbnflow's video, some guy was doing the usual comment that sounds crazy, just "oh, bring a druid, 3 hunters and a priest.". 
---
But I can't say it won't work. I really have no idea. Maybe hunters just do amazing dps without spending mana. I certainly don't play one.
---
This guy has a very soothing voice I like it a lot thank you!
---
Wanted to make a Troll Shaman named Thex. Gonna rush to reserve the name ASAP.

I was going to disagree and say that arcane sucked, but then remembered that it was actually popular as an accompaniment to fire or frost.  Arcane missiles, while not optimal at any point, was still completely viable!
---

---
Can someone copy paste the text? It's too small on the phone :(
---
Because most of the dungeon grind is far away from towns/mailboxes getting ammo resupplied after several levels of grind will be fucking awful. Hunters need arrows every 1.5 levels with a current level ammo pouch. Cannot recommend.
---
I wanted to hate this but realized I feel the same way. Night Elf? Probably a Legolas wanna-be or a guy pretending to be a girl. Human? Probably an elitist douche bag min-maxer. Gnome? Probably some kind of pervert. Dwarf? Now that’s a mighty man!

Yeah - those estimates are all baseless.
---
Fishing and Herbalism is your best bet.   You can provide your own materials for raid flasks, mana potions, boosting drinks, etc and sell the rest for gold.  Have a guildy make the potions. 
---
You can also farm lvl 53 to 55 world mobs with a spell dmg set and sell or disenchant the greens, just slower than a dps would obviously.
---
My goals are similar in reaching 40... after that I plan to try and make some gold with professions and AH. After that first week I'm back to RL and down to 2-4 hours per day, so I won't see the economic benefits of reaching 60 for a long long time anyway.

They're running brand new hardware at multiple locations around the world at once.

They're expecting issues but said they will have a team on standby to solve them as they come up.

It's not just a new expansion. It's brand new hardware. The latest interview with Blizzard said this is the first release in 15 years that they're actually done new hardware worldwide.

His world record time was on a fresh server that launched later during vanilla, so yes?
---
Anyone else excited to reserve the name Thex?
---
It's not a competition you absolute moron. They just want to play on the same server. What the fuck are they supposed to "control"?
---
It's on the client, we get to the make the characters.
---
He could just go pve and get a low pop layer GG layering is broken
---
sent you a DM
---
Yes!! It's like a pretty version of Molten Core.
---
God the GM of the elites sentence wrecked me man. Good on you
---
Post Classic lore is amazing thou, genocide, mass killing, enslavement, big scale faction wars, OP "heroes". Alot of it died down in Classic, its basicly the peace age if you compare it.
---
Can we choose the appearance of our shaman named Thex when we reserve the name?
---
&gt; This alliance will prevent maffias and other bad stuff for the server and avoid any kind of "streamer" server.
---
OP's words, not mine. He wants control.
---
I am.
---
Lack of guild banks.
---
Holding my stuff and guild stuff on multiple lvl 1s is just annoying. Guild banks was the best change after vanilla IMO
---
I’ve decided to main a pally after playing around on a pserver for a while to help with the decision. I really like the idea of being able to fulfill any roll in a dungeon just by hanging on to a few extra pieces of gear during leveling. The aesthetics of being a holy crusader are pretty cool too. 
---
That said, when I finally hit 60 I’ll eventually end up going holy if I’m still interested in doing raids by then. I don’t see a point in wasting a raid spot with a meme spec and I’m sure no loot council will let me get any of the gear that drops. If I’m not into playing hardcore anymore, I’ll definitely be memeing out playing a Ret or Prot spec while doing dungeons and getting wrecked in pvp.
---
Why would you put W on your skill bar?
---
I can't 100% remember the flag runner spec... Is it something like 8/11/32?
---
It's ok-ish in pve. It sucks balls in PvP.
---
I don't dislike post classic lore that much... I'm more doing this to be like the Colonial Williamsburg of video games lol
---
You would be better off with Holy shield imo.
---
Thats fair. But playing long hours isnt unhealthy as long as you are aware of getting up, stretching, drinking and eatting properly.
---
And I will in vanilla.
---
WoW (And LOTR a bit too) is at fault for making me associate lava and volcanoes in general with final areas in games. I just friggin' love fiery zones, and Blackrock is such an awesome place, filled to the brim with dungeons and raids.
---
GOSH DARN IT, BIG-POND!

this comment sums up this sub
---
get out how dare u

---
Hahaha I love it!
---
probably the best
---
It's like you read parts of my post and then made up a brand new sentence out of nothing.
---
Nobody knows with 100% certainty whether there will or won't be major problems. Blizzard themselves don't know with complete certainty that Classic's launch will go off without a hitch. What we do know is that Blizzard have gotten a lot better at launches over time and they've spent 15 years engineering the crap out of their systems to reduce the effects that technical problems have on their services.
---
I think Classic launch will be pretty painless for the userbase because we have a bunch of load distribution techniques now that we didn't back in the day. Amazon Web Services, server layering etc. all work to make sure the service is uninterrupted.
---
It'll be fine.
---
With layering I doubt it, but I have my own plan for getting to 10+ rapidly and getting ahead of the pack
---
Can't wait to make my dungeon tanking-more hair than flesh-windfury proccin' Dwarvern Shaman named Thëx.
---
Brocktree.
---
But any badger lord name could only be lived up to by a tauren. And Brocktree could only be a 2H sword warrior... and I already had an orc warrior.
---
Russano was armed with a stick. The epic hunter quest reward was an epic stick. It was a fit.
---
Isnt Scrubclub NA?
---
the client is downloadable now, the servers will unlock for character creation but not be playable
---
That is a TBC TCG Mount.
---
imagine not spirit healer skipping this run in 2019
---
Troll all the way for speed leveling, orcs for pvp
---
That’s my name damn it
---
Yeah I was sad during the stress test. Wasint able to log in till the next day lol.
---
I mean is it Classic without some free day credits for servers being broken? 
---
Honestly though I think there might be some issues but I am optimistic. It was a bit hairy on the stress test for a bit at first (after they reduced the number of servers available), but they got it playable in a pretty reasonable amount of time.
---

Wait, no barber?

Meet the new barber, Mr. Delete Character.
---
That's not a ninja, that's a mistake. I have seen it happen.
---
Yep. I used to be really into it, but then he started posting (literally) 10 hour videos.
---
Private servers do get many thing wrong - for example, dungeon leveling on private servers gives less XP than on Classic. On the other hand, the overall difference is less drastic than you think. There's a reason why private server players got way faster leveling times on the beta than Joana. The practice is not useless, we've seen on the beta that it allows even classes like rogue and priest to level faster than the former world champ.
---
DoctorIzzt
---
What are trolls offering in the way of speed leveling?
---
Check Warcraft tavern for addons. 
---
They will be separate, in a different Addons folder.
---
That’s why you put a helmet
---
Thanks! Is curse still the most viable client to use?
---
I suspect they do, indeed they are HOPING for it. Retail WoW subscriptions have been petering out for years and their (idiotic) response to that was to water it down even more and make things ever easier, which wasn't what made the game popular in the first place.
---
The ONLY reason they are doing this is get more subscriptions; of course they are its a business. They will do what makes money. If Classic is a big (and long term) hit, they'll do TBC as well, and so on. Money demands that it happen.
---
Separate addons, different versions will have to be made to work with either or.
---
You should never wear boots. Like, *ever*
---
yup exactly, or you can put a point in feral switchness.
---
Best thing. I’ve found on YouTube in a long time.
---
Why would blizzard painstakingly try to rework nearly half the content from TBC into some weird level 60 form instead of just releasing the expansion itself..
---
 [**Patch 1.4.0**](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.4.0) **(patch date:2005-05-05):** This spell can no longer be used on warrior and rogue targets. In addition, while it can be used on a druid target at any time it will only drain mana when the druid is in caster form. 
---
Is there a website we can play with the different hair styles, faces, etc?
---
You sound like an awesome uncle. I've been considering a similar idea with my son and the idea of having a dictionary on hand had not occurred to me so thank you for that stroke of genius.
---
I hope you and your niece get to run around together in classic.
---
Yeah, I'll miss that too.  Would help healers get through the world.
---
and more ppl funneling gold.
---
Prior to level 22, I would say you rend everything. 22-29, I would sunder everything and only rend when I was confident I had enough rage to do both. In that case, I would try to rend mobs that I think will live longest first, particularly normal mobs. 
---
And yeah, I think there's a lot to be figured out for higher levels. I haven't done the spreadsheeting yet because I think the post 30 stuff, people will be doing the same content for so long that approximations will not be needed: it will be worth plugging actual character and mob values in.
---
Also, we will know a lot more about what is mechanically practical. None of this matters if the players cannot reliably pull off the mechanical challenge.
---
Well, do what I did. Schedule you vasectomy for Tuesday so you can get the rest of the week off.
---
They probably don't see appoint to advertising what is essentially a rebooting of the game
---
Once you threatened to leave to get a pay raise you became expendable in their eyes. Not surprising they're treating you like shit since they know you have one foot out the door.
---
This is the god-tier name. Everyone else, let's pack up our bags. Trophy goes to this person.
---
Why post something incorrect that you didn’t test?
---
Most of the badger names in Redwall would be good fits for Tauren now that I think of it. I had an orc hunter named Finbarr after the otter
---
I'm going Discipline just to Power Infusion all the Mage players that seem to be half of what everyone is planning on being.
---
I told my boss I needed a couple days off at the end of August for the launch of wow classic and he looked at me like I'm special.  Can't say I blame him, being that I'm 40 with white facial hair taking time off for a video game.
---
Sorry for this, sucks big time.
---
Thexis Instruments

eh, you melee more than you might think.
---
big yikes to anyone in a streamer guild
---
No barber till Wrath
---
There is literally empirical evidence showing that private server training is not useless. Even though Joana managed to improve his leveling speed, private server players who got into the beta and focused on speed leveling were still getting way better times than he did. Why are you ignoring this?
---
Mike Tyson is that you?
---
Female. Because the male animation can also be achieved by noggenfogger elixir
---
Of course, my plan for classic os going for Tailoring/Skinning while lvling (Skinning is free money), and as soon i get truefaith , im dropping tailoring for alchemy, while i probably drop skinning for herb, get aalchemy maxed out and rop the gathering prof for engi, im thinking of getting an alt (a shaman or a hunter)  with both mining and herb
---
Get check ups often. Catch that shit early.

more agility and berserking and +5 to bows.

Blizzard is owned by Activision, so that seriously is a possibility.

wow congratulations on the very attractive girlfriend.  I can tell shes attractive because you aren't with her for her baking skills.
---
Can't relate tbh. It's the main thing my roommates, myself and some other friends are looking forward to.
---
Yeah, who got classic world first 60 and smashed the record after practicing on a pirate server? Beta is not the final build, anything could change, and pirate server info is useless. I'm not ignoring anything, you just have no argument since the game is literally not out yet.

I was 15 when WoW launched, and too dumb to realize I rolled on a server with a timezone WAY off from mine until I was way too invested in my character. 
---
So between limited to a few hours a day of play and the fact that those hours were like 5am-7am on my server I never got into MC, had a real hard time finding BRD and scholo groups. Basically got to 60, fapped around for a while and quit
---
So this time around I'd like to 60 in time to actually raid and see the dungeons I never got to see the first time around.
---
OooohWee!
---
I cant take Classic off because I have some shipments coming in that require a lot of testing and weekend work is required as well.
---
Nope no wife or kids just a lone need looking to hit classic hard
---
Not yet
---
No
---
I guess you could get it on a dead pve server. But if you’ve never done 1 to 60 before it’s gonna be rough.

no
---
Agreed, unsubbed a couple of months ago but played disc priest. In order to get high effective healing and high parses I really had to learn the fights to make sure I was building at the right times and blowing cooldowns moments before big damage while moving and executing some pretty complicated raid mechanics. 
---
Classic will be fun but let's not pretend BFA rotations and mechanics are simple.
---
&gt; Hopefully Blizzard releases that information.
---
Have they ever released that information before all the cross realm stuff happened that made the info irrelevant? I wouldn't bet on having that data.
---
You would be fine even if they announced them only 5 minutes beforehand.
---
I've been doing this on private servers.
---
if your mana can regen in animal form, then we should be able to drain it imo.
---
There's a video where like 35 frost mages kill ragnaros in like 45 seconds
---
Been playing with this as a Druid Tank/Healer hybrid as an alternative to HotW/NS: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zZxxxscMdtVxsob
---
This is a tank-focused build, except you are exchanging Omen and Natural Weapons for Imp Healing Touch and Reflection. I know losing NS is huge, but I am thinking the trade-offs are worth it. 
---
I'm looking for someone to convince me that NS truly cannot be dropped, even for 18.4% more armor (in Dire Bear) from the last two points in Thick Hide and Leader of the Pack.
---
Corporate sponsors have been included in server names for Classic WoW
---
* Tirisfall Glade-wipes (PvP)
---
* Blackrock-efeller (PvP)
---
etc, etc
---
-- and no, no server names yet. They'll likely be released this week. Next week at the latest (given that name reservations are soon).
---
We get it. You’re gonna level slow and want other people to say it’s ok.
---
Sure, it's a rather basic sheet though as I thought only I would look at it. Feel free to make a copy and move things around.
---
[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1um6ALWeLR01buN3zT3X2x2IC6ydCJisYiT6nqY-KJ7A/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1um6ALWeLR01buN3zT3X2x2IC6ydCJisYiT6nqY-KJ7A/edit?usp=sharing)
---
pretty sure it didn't
---
I'm sure they weighed many marketing strategies and determined that one was best (most profitable). Companies act very predictably fyi
---
I'm playing a druid because I want to heal! Hunter and Warlock are also very appealing to me but I really don't want to be DPSing in PvE. To me, the non-healing aspects of the class (being able to stealth around, soak up damage in bear, kite, general versatility) is what makes it more appealing to me above other healing classes, but it's ultimately being able to heal that's most important to me.
---
It's a rather basic layout without any color at all because I never thought other people would see it, but you could always make a copy and change things to your liking.
---
Youre probably right but it might be easy for them to release the server list earlier than five minutes before. If they don't know how many servers they have then they don't know. I'm not overly worried
---
Depending on your tank and such, if you are in a group of 4 warrs you may be better off using tranquil air totem/wf if they are all threat capped.
---
Damnn they should bring it in lol, gnomes need to step Up!
---
They hated his word, because he spoke the truth.
---
I dont tell my manager shit about my vacation time. It's mine, not his.
---
Thats why I said after level 30. Its a bit of a challenge up to and around 20ish if you pull more than 2
---
teach me the ways of the druid, shedo
---
What begins I don't get it? Just showing something awesome that my girlfriend made I'm so proud of her!
---
Just a friendly reminder in classic you max out at level 60. And have talent points. There’s also no flying mounts. We seriously making posts for this stuff?
---
To add onto this, a fully committed 5 man dungeon group of sham,druidtank, 3 warrs will be as fast or faster than speedlevelers, so world first rag attempts will most likely have multiple similiar groups doing that, with warlocks levelled and afked at key travel points for their guild, shaving off hours of time.
---
It's 2019 and people still think that Activision owns blizzard or something.
---
NO. Blizzard and Activision are just owned by the same parent company, they are NOT merged together. Blizzard has said multiple times that Activision has no impact on their game development/

Totally brings back some memories.  Sad to hear that it is no longer around.  Gonna be a fun learning curve trying to find all these things again.  How much could I have forgotten in 12 years?
---
 *audible shrug*
---
But like actually I don't frequent this subreddit, so I didn't see that post. Just wanted to share this because I'm proud of how it came out.
---
This is the comment I was searching for. I don't want to sound like a total elitist/purist douche... but... here goes anyway:  Do it the correct way. Classic WoW is about the adventure - bypassing adventure at every turn is what created retail WoW.
---
Regardless of that personal opinion I just spouted, OP: you do you. And thank you for uploading a video to help others.

My favorite way to pick a class, is to look at concept art and imagine the story behind it. Concept art is often extremely representative of the fantasy involved in the game, and helps determine what you wish to achieve in it.
---
Osconty
---
Give your balls a tug, titfucker.
---
Most people say it was good because they started playing in like, late wotlk or cata, lol. I was ready to quit the game in late wrath because I hated it, but was hoping cata would change the game for the better. Holy shit was I ever disappointed. Quit forever shortly thereafter.
---
No no no you see the non optimal specs are obviously being played by “dead weight” so it’s worse than having no one... Apparently.
---
Completely agree with you. The Wetlands run is a special part of what makes classic wow awesome. Bypassing it is just depriving yourself of the adventure. (Even to those that have done the "legit" run 200+ times)
---
Probably Thex like always. Or maybe Bort.
---
I think Monday is a good call. Fuck taking off the first couple days. By Monday I think the hype will settle down a little and the starting zones will be less cluttered.
---
I plan to clear clear BWL at a minimum, and we'll see if burnout takes me before clearing AQ40.
---
&gt;for people with compulsion disorders.
---
This so much. Doesn't matter how stupid the achievements might be, and how unfun many of them are to complete, there's always the people that "have" to get all of them
---
what on hit effect is anywhere near that strong?
---
It actually is realistic if you're a maintain/offtank for your guild, getting it as a rogue or others is less realistic.
---
ahhaha Locks best class
---
Streamers were the only ones we constantly saw playing. And they were the ones that played the most, and for the largest number of days, because they were making money off of it.
---
Hey, if you decide to port to iOS and decide to go native I work as a senior iOS dev at a pretty large company and would be more than happy to help you with any questions or work with you on it. Feel free to hit me up :).
---
Someone playing Tauren / Human Warrior Tank, knows they play well in a semi hardcore or hardcore guild has a decent chance to main tank. The main tank gets the first TF. Put in that sort of effort and it should be quite realistic.
---
I'm saying bringing non-optimal specs is equivalent to going in with less players. The raid isn't trivial by itself, it's made easy through knowledge and coming prepared. Coming up short in one area makes it more difficult. Once you stop coming into Molten Core prepared or without applying learned knowledge about the raid, it stops being trivial. That's fine, but guilds usually want to make raids as easy as they can.
---
Time to call in sick.
---
Well, so I found out I'm apparently gay for male dwarves.  I'm okay with this.

How much time does this actually save? You still have to run a long ass way from IF later to get the Loch Modan FP
---
Comparable??? Servers with population thats been set over years and years of playing compared to a fresh server with no one on them is comparable? Think before you type...
---
I made that run too many times, Fuck that.
---
That’s exactly why I haven’t claimed a reward for recruit a friend, you think it’ll go away if I don’t choose anything?
---
The thing is it's not a hard science. There really is no way of knowing how many people will be playing, especially the amount of tourists that will play the first few days. The best they can do is take an educated guess, extrapolate some numbers and trends, etc etc. But I for one know of a few people that have not been subbed in years, aren't in this subreddit or official forums, but will be playing at launch - how does Blizzard account for these people? The answer is they can't.
---
Optimistically I'm hoping to at least get into BWL and getting some nice stuff to do quite a bit of world pvp with then on to BG's later.  
---
Realistically I'll be happy if I get to 60 and get 3/8 of my dungeon set.
---
" welcome back to school kids. Your first assignment is to farm gold for my wow character. A+ for the top 5 gold farmers is up for grabs."
---
Server population set? Your going to have to explain that one to me. Its just like with every expansion, big surge in population on untested content. The same exact thing lol
---
I dont care if this has been posted before on this subreddit. It stands out from the other bullshit sob stories and repetitive questions or non informative meme posts. I love content focused on becoming a better gamer. Props.
---
To be faaaaaäiiiiiiiiiîrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
---
It might not be *exactly* what you are looking for. It is meant to be a concise introductory to each class while omitting raiding, farming, pvp, specs, and all of that. No lore either, just what each class is, some flavor that sets each apart, and something cool about each class to help nudge the decision making process along.
---
He's been MIA for a while, hope he makes some more
---
Oh god... I hadn’t actually thought of that. Barrens chat in uh, “the current political climate” is going to be amazing.
---
I highly doubt that there won't be any German/French RP servers, considering that the RP communities were amongst the loudest cries for language specific servers. Do you have any sources on your claim, or is this just speculation?
---
we had a guy named warpig on our server that was renowned for being terrible.  We all used to laugh when we saw him.  idk how he was so bad, but he did like no dmg as a rogue.  Didn't interrupt heals or anything.   Needless to say, if you died to warpig, then everyone laughed at you.  
---
He got to like rank 10 before we quit pvping.
---
&gt;honestly i just dont think they know how to handle classic
---
&gt;blizz has a huge marketing team im very surprised what could be a very profitible product for them is geting as far as ive seen no advertisement.
---
What if their huge marketing team used their marketing technology, skills, and experience to determine it's more cost effective to not spend money on traditional advertising for the game?
---
Lol I already feel bad for the "you're cool" alliance guy that's left to die
---
If you're looking to min max yes. Out of all the classes race choice probably matters the most to warriors. Aside from alliance priests that is.
---
Human is #1 PvE DPS.  
---
Gnome, orc and tauren are great pvp choices. Dwarf isn't bad for dealing with blind, just that gnome wins out. Generally you'd rather be able to deal with all the slows in the game than just blind, which warriors aren't the primary target of blind anyway in most scenarios other than 1v1s/duels.
---
Crap forgot to respond about the spirit thing. Considering priests have a skill that derives 25% spirit into extra SP. Now on top of that 25, you have 5% more just from being a human. That's 30% more compared to a similar geared priest with only 25%.not a large amount I grant you, but every percent adds up. But different strokes for different folks I guess can't change that
---
Hit em up with the: *"Hey boss. Not feeling well today. I've been vomiting profusely all night and can't make it past the door. I think I've had some serious food poisoning from the chinese restaurant (be sure to go to a Chinese restaurant the night before, and post a pic of yourself on Facebook). I will need to take some time to rest up. I'll check in with you later today or tomorrow morning to see if I'm feeling any better."*
---
Then during that day, throw yourself down some stairs, like someone mentioned in another comment, and say that you passed out from the food poisoning while walking down the stairs. Be sure to seriously cut your skin open and bleed. You don't necessarily need to break a bone, blood is enough to make it look legit. For this one, also post a pic on Facebook of you getting bandaged up. That should buy you 2-3 days for sure.
---
Not that that happens elsewhere. Only Horde scum would think that...
---
Kind of good imo. knowing your way around the internet is a godsend once you've reached the age that you're in a retirement home. Those places usually suck if you have to rely on those environments for social interaction.
---
A win fury! Sorry, I'll see myself out.
---
Does anything actually USE mana in BfA? That resource is practically irrelevant now. Remember the days when priests would brag about how much mana they had, before they capped it? Akin to tanks bragging about their health?
---
They do this consistently. Force something to be irrelevant, then remove it because its irrelevant. Just google the patch notes for WoD in particular and control-F and search ‘removed’
---
Sorry for the random rant. LESS THAN A MONTH GET HYPE!
---
Nonono, we understand the inner workings of a massive company better since we buy their stuff.
---
I drain more than I spend, and it feels good to spend souls of horde scum on healthstones
---
I think you missed the point
---
Can't speak for GMs these days since I have probably only played for like 10 days /played since wotlk release, but GMs were amazing back in the day. Sometimes it would take hours for the initial contact, but they really made sure everything was good before closing the ticket. I even had GMs follow up with me after the ticket was closed with additional information.

I earned 26 days a year and make sure I always have 30 days banked since they have to pay out upon separation.  Unfortunately, they don't have to pay out our sick leave upon separation.
---
Tri spec &gt; everything else
---
The Dwarves are hunters and have fucking guns. 
---
A fucking Dwarf with guns. What kind of ridiculous shit is this anyways. Sounds like the same kind of shit that would spawn a $100.00 collectors edition that nobody will buy.
---
They knew what they signed up for. I'll throw a DI on them and maybe the Horde will get bored and wander off. Or more will show up to taunt then murder them, whatever, I'm at the auction house.
---
Joke's on you, the best troll hairstyle is no hairstyle and every face is the same
---
I miss the seemingly month by month changes to DK's in WotLK. It can make grinding raids so much better because you cannot wait to try the new spec, whatever it may be: diseaseless blood spec, DW frost, 2H frost, like 5 iterations of unholy, hybrid DW spec before frost DW, blade dancer blood spec, whatever. 
---
I leveled up on a private server for the first time ever a month or so ago so I could play SP again. My cousin wanted me to play retail with him so I tried to just simply level up my shadow priest again. LOUD BUZZER NOISE. What a waste of my fucking time. 
---
I'll just echo what you said: &gt;Simple Classic is the next best thing, though; I'll take it.
---
Seems like a super unique name I’m gonna be a gnome male warlock named Thex
---
Yep. I expect the first Blizzard big red button alarm will go off on name reservation day or the day before.
---
his ass is the source obviously
---
Shadowmeld + Charge
---
It's not even a particularly good wpn, cost a fortune to craft, and warriors have better options.  You won't get a half dozen of them either.  It's rare.
---
Oh, I suspect as much, but I like to give people the benefit of a doubt.
---
Luvstospooge
---
2-3 months is what I’ve heard. No idea where it’s from or if it’s even accurate just what I’ve seen said.
---
Personally I would call in sick in that type of situation. I've chosen to be content with my current job despite having opportunities to make significantly more money largely because I have the freedom to take off whenever I want almost to the point where it's less of a request and more of a notification.
---
I'm not choosing to take any time off for classic myself, but if I wanted to and my bosses denied me I would seriously consider just calling in sick those days anyway. Sounds like a lot of bullshit to reject it without a specific reason.
---
Thex
---
&gt;Also not sure why you included priests there. People might pressure them into respeccing holy, but shadow priests by all accounts do respectable damage and really buff the warlocks in the raid.
---
Well because one look at the title of the thread. And two I think you meant to say Priest not Priests. Priests don't buff the raid, it only takes one. And they don't compete on DPS the way you apparently think they do. 
---
To the real point a hunter enjoying the game play of survival over all other specs is not at all different from a Druid only playing boomkin. All it does is gimp them and they are both equally silly.
---
Thanks man! I work mostly on web stuffs, and still pretty new to mobile. I would love to hear what you think about native app vs cross platform (react, flutter). In the long run do you think its better to have two native apps or one cross platform app?
---
this.
---
Of course it matters, you can be using that GBC for a number of things.
---
The tomb for thrall's bots, eh? 🙂
---
they are not launching a vanilla server. we only get classic, with all its layering bullshit. so its not really comparable.
---
yeah if they play solo all the time and someone invited, bad luck. they don't have to have all the skills... it's a way to play too
---
I think you're seriously underestimating how many newer WoW players are going to join Classic.
---
This isn't a niche private server community, anymore.
---
Banana, grapes, small dosages of lsd through the 24h run. Weed ofc. Water with a lot of ice. Dinners gonna be ordered. Thai and mexi!
---
Our guild farmed mc for a year, and never got 1 legendary.
---
&gt;She
---
It was in the last sentence, but I found the problem.
---
Good thing you removed your gear, those apprentices pants rack up quite the repair bill.
---
dont take this advice, holy shit.
---
Also deprives you of the loch modan fp + exploration xp
---
HotW/NS is good, will let you do basically anything, though it's more of a feral pvp spec with nature's swiftness than a real pvp healing spec.
---
Moonglow/Resto will give you very admirable heal/sec (assuming you're using the 50% regrowth crit talent)  and heal/mana, which is great for pvp, however you are probably the most vulnerable healer in your caster form, and won't have any instant heals outside of NS, which makes you a very high priority target, and reduces your kiting potential (compared to a swiftmend build).
---
I would think as a result that Moonglow/Resto is fine in the bigger battlegrounds (AB, AV, City Raids) and will do just fine in WSG Pugs if you position yourself near some support. But for WSG premades  and duels you'll be better off with a different spec. 
---
Don't let anyone fool you that WSG premades are the one and only "correct" way to pvp either, those people only care about farming honor as efficiently as possible, and frankly it seems to me it makes them hate pvp, since most of them quit once they get their rewards. So pick a spec suitable to the kind of pvp you like and enjoy it as much as you can :).
---
They have not announced anything about it but since the idea is to try to replicate the vanilla experience to a large degree we can guess by looking at the time between patches then. If they mirror the original Vanilla timeline it would give us:
---
1. P1 - Late August 2019
---
2. P2 - Early November 2019 (~2.5 months after P1)
---
3. P3 - Early-Mid April 2020 (~5 months after P2)
---
4. P4 - Early-Mid June 2020 (~2 months after P3)
---
5. P5 - Early October 2020 (~4 months after P4)
---
6. P6 - Late March 2021 (~6 months after P5)
---
That's at least the longest timeline I think they would use. I believe a lot of that timeline was dynamic based on the player progression and thus it would not surprise me if it's accelerated for Classic.
---
For example, it certainly won't take us 5 months to defeat Rag this time around so personally I expect P3 drops 2-3 months earlier than the above projection which probably also moves up P2 just a bit. Likewise P6 probably is accelerated a couple months as well since C'thun won't be overtuned for 3 months like it was vanilla.
---
not always true. it's easy to hate everyone. people are very different. even one fair fight doesn't mean i will camp your corpse or fight you again on sight. maybe i will even save your ass one day from those 3 furbolgs. lately most of times it's stupid cowards who attack me first, only to get rekt afterwards. i used to hate all horde, now i see there are decent players who mind their own business on both factions, and aggressive retards who backstab 5v1 and feel cool about it...
---
Oh.
---
Warrior - Standard fantasy game sword guy with metal armor.
---
Priest - Church dude.  Can heal really good.
---
Paladin - What you get when the warrior and priest love each other very much.
---
Mage - Basically a wizard.
---
Warlock - Basically a wizard, but evil.  Also gets a cool Demon pet.
---
Hunter - Plays with bows and guns.  Tames an animal pet.
---
Rogue - Sneaky Thieving Assassin type.
---
Shaman - Primitive witchdoctor / medicine man type guy.  Also can use pretty big warhammers and axes in this game.
---
Druid - Nature loving priest.  But mostly a shapeshifter.
---
Lol I’m glad I’m not the only one. Have you nailed down your appearance yet? Still waffling between two hair colors...
---
I’ll try blowing up Theramore — that’s a good trick!

The best thing to have in world pvp is the ability to actually win the fight.
---
Thank you so much!

Been playing since 1.7's Zul'Gurub (a couple of characters in NA ). Have all classes maxed out on SA servers except mage and warrior

In classic my first character was a priest. I was so excited to heal everyone... To be able to REVIVE A LEVEL 60 DURING A WORLD PVP SCUFFLE
---
SPURDO SPÄRDE MEKI TULLAAN ;;;DDD
---
The whole reason the game has layering was to prevent this. So when there is an inevitable queue, ask yourself why they added layering in the first place.
---
Ion said about 2 months each.
---
The goal is to ensure that the PVP rewards do not make doing MC/Ony raids redundant
---
Especially paladins named Thex.
---
&gt; but those guilds won’t keep their Meta players to carry them. 
---
That's a bold assumption cotton.

Thex got me covered homie

#  MINISTRY OF DEATH [OCEANIC] [HORDE] [PVP]  
---
We are a New Zealand &amp; Australian based guild, we are being reborn once again for classic. This time round we're looking at a semi-hardcore approach, we will be pushing to clear content as quickly as possible. While our goal in classic is to clear all raid content in an efficient manner while maintaining a relaxed &amp; Fun atmosphere.    
---
**- Realm :** Oceanic    
---
**- Realm Type:** PVP   
---
**- Faction:**  HORDE   
---
**- Region:** NZ &amp; AUS   
---
**- Timezone:** GMT+12 (NZ)    
---
**- Guild Type:** Semi-hardcore   
---
**- Loot Rules:** EPGP (specifc items will be loot counciled)  
---
**Raiding times will be:**   
---
\- 2030 start till 2300-2330 finish (NZ)    
---
\- Wednesdays &amp; Thursdays.  
---
\* And Sundays &amp; Mondays used for either Alt+Casual raid nights / or extra raid nights (when needed once more phases are released)  
---
**Position Avaliability:**   
---
\- CURRENTLY ONLY CASUAL RAIDING POSITIONS AVALIABLE.   
---
\- BUT CURRENTLY LOOKING FOR MORE PVP FOCUSED PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN RANKING. 
---
We expect all of our members to be respectful of all guidies. We don't expect everyone to know strats to every encounter, but if you don't, we will expect that you show up with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn, and put in 100% effort.  
---
Also we fully expect some people cannot raid as hardcore as they used to, and we have kept that in mind and will be allowing casual's also to join all classes, as long as "if" or "when" they become avaliable to raid they do so by giving their all.

Gah long day, thanks!
---
Considering the names I plan to use that few minute time window is gonna be a nope from me dawg, I’ll take the randomized features and call it fate whatever I end up with
---
All the classes that can heal are effective and primarily used as healers. None of them are very strong or sought after for other specs with Bear Druids as a moderate exception. In the later phases some of them become decent at DPS (namely priest and cat druid).
---
Warriors will do the vast majority of tanking but Bear Druid is viable for most things as well. Paladins can tank some stuff but have severely limited toolsets for it (no taunt for example). I never even saw a paladin tank during the entirety of vanilla in my dungeon runs or raids, but I know there has been some more development on that front in pservers. Don't expect to see many paladins tanks or them being accepted in most groups.
---
The same will be true, the only MT spec is prot warrior. 
---
Hybrid classes won't top dps, a few off-specc dps guys per raid is absolutely ok to have but it's harder to find a raid as a hybrid dpser.
---
all healing specs are ok though.
---
At sunder rank 2, it’s worth using solo about 60% if the time, up to 2 stacks. This all depends on enemy armor. And when you get sunder rank 3, you might as well use it over Heroic Strike 100% of the time.
---
Classic WoW is supposed to be a total recreation of WoW as it was in 1.12.
---
Patch 1.12 included some buffs to certain specs, such as Balance Druid, but the majority of hybrid DPS specs are below par compared to the pure DPS classes.
---
When it comes to Tanks the only one not truly viable in a raiding atmosphere is Paladins, they have mana restrictions and no taunt.
---
When it comes to healing, all hybrid healers are viable, though some are clearly better than others.
---
No, you didn't understand. 15 people level 5 characters to 60 by Saturday, giving the 5-man 3 full days to gear up before the rest of the guild catches up for the Monday Molten Core.
---
U wot m8? 
---
You wanna throw down right here, right now?!
---
It’s based on a multiplier checked against level. At level 60, it’s roughly 1 rage for 30 damage dealt. I’d assume flat scaling, but we simply don’t know.
---
Thanks for this :)
---
It comes to about 30 damage dealt per 1 rage and 60 damage taken per 1 rage.
---
What happened after they denied the request? Have you spoken to them in further depth to understand why?
---
&gt;NE being the second most chosen alliance race makes me shudder a bit.
---
Why?
---
What about Ryan? just don't PvP too much.
---
Get it? or Thex
---
are you sure? I distinctly remember in vanilla, well before any TBC pre patch, seeing Scandinavian characters in people's names
---
if you have limited days that you can take off, it's usually smarter to take your day(s) off at least a few days after any launch
---
Why skip?
---
A white 2h Axe with 25 agi enchant.
---
when the hell did this whole meta and meme spec shit start?
---
A simple yes would suffice, I’m tired of the reposts. I understand the audience this game will bring.
---
They'll all be undead warlocks.
---
My only aim is to have fun. I have no aims on when I want to hit 60, what sorta gear I want to have, etc. I'm just gonna play it like I did back in 2005. No guides, no flowcharts, no plans. I'm just gonna enjoy the journey.
---
15 hours a week from start, puts you at 60 in around 12 - 16 weeks.
---
Phase 3 brings bwl and should be out some time in early 2020, yes - you'll be able to raid.
---
You can look at this current survey's results [here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQwB39WyONgFnnJzPnhU4MorbNFGnzN09Q-aq5Tkc_065rwA/viewanalytics) Last survey's results [here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSKhcR57Lpsk4YIEWO-u-88xEXoZo2rT6mF9gl27ctRpcOlg/viewanalytics) The Alliance are falling behind the Horde this time around so far!
---
Doing naxx lol, what a goal...
---
So when I don't like my priests hair (Thex), I'll just show helm to cover it
---
Used to jerk it to that back in Vanilla.
---
I’m in a similar boat (which is why I created a one-raidnight-a-week guild), but I honestly think the inability to play as much as I possible want to can be a good thing. As a teen, I played the long hours of an addict. But today, I’m going to savor those hours I get so much more, and have an all-around better lifestyle because of it. 
---
But yeah, once you hit 60, 15 hours a week is plenty. For raiding, it’s more about finding the blocks of time necessary, as it’s usually a 3+ hour affair with minimal breaks. Many adults can manage the 15 hours — it’s the 3 hour chunks that are rare.
---
Need flight path
---
Stream man bad
---
They're not the experts they think they are. P servers have gotten things very wrong. There was an entire metagame built around the idea of tanks using /sit to proc talents which blizzard has confirmed was never in vanilla and will not be in Classic.
---
Peacekrulz, my name always have been Warkrulz and I have always been an orc warrior, now I'm gonna be a human pally and I think swapping peace for war is a nice way to empathize the divergence between those rolls.
---
That's not the same boat that you get off of.
---
Yep very true. Once I get to 60 it’s all about time management to get the 3 hour blocks in.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZLoHl5UH8
---
You probably don’t know more than that, but are we thinking the 12th closer to noon, evening, midnight?
---
That didn't start until Wotlk
---
They obviously would care which gets more subs for figuring out what design choices work

---
BFA has less system mastery, or knowing things outside your class like items and consumables that can change the way you play. For evidence of high system mastery in Classic, just watch Roxana the Ravager AoE farm on a hunter with a level 40 weapon or Skarm AoE tank with a blue cloth Helm from Gnomer.
---
I just leave chat when that stuff happens.
---
Obvious troll is obvious
---
I think there are two reasons.  
---
1. The fans who want classic, already know about it.
---
2. This isn't a game you can jump into blind and have a good time, you need to know what you're getting into, and that's going to be more likely if you're being referred to it by a friend, rather than viewing an ad.
---
Warrior - Tank
---
Priest - Healer
---
Paladin - Disgruntled Healer
---
Mage - Vending Machine, can remove curses **only if not doing so costs DKP
---
Warlock - Summons your short bus riders, banishes, has cookies, has agro.
---
Hunter - Highest skill cap in the game, but no one will ever know because everyone is terrified to invite you because it also has the lowers skill floor.
---
Rogue - back stabber
---
Shaman - Healer with totems
---
Druid - Flag Carrier, Innervater, adequate off tank.. but mostly you just want one around to puncture mages big heads in pvp.
---
They probably don’t want all their severs melting at launch.
---
Looking for EU Alliance priest, pref dorf, for 5 man dungeon leveling all the way to 60. Our prelim schedule is 30hr/9hr sleep/24+hr/9hr sleep/24hr etc, but it is negotiable.
---
We have our own test server where we are testing and polishing the route. You would be leveling with the MT, raid leader and guild leader (yes all three different persons) of a hardcore raiding guild, so we'd more than likely have a raidslot for ya when it is all done, but joining our guild is not required. Sperging out at release and pulling long ass sessions is.
---
If this sounds like something you would be interested in and the schedule fits, then please get in touch :).
---
Looking forward to hearing from ya!
---
They’ve already said it will be released before name day.
---
No idea. Sorry.
---
All these posts with your name bud, I would be surprised if you find a single server with the name available now.
---
I'm considering either skinning or enchanting to go along with tailoring. Maybe enchanting to 70, for Greater Magic Wand, and then switch to Skinning for level 40 mount gold.
---
Bought a stable spot thinking I'd get a mount...
---
Well I was dumb enough to buy BFA. How much for this?
---
The equivalent of a man-bun hipster if I ever see one of these lumping around.
---
Individually, I understood a few of these words.
---
type it out loud, I guess LOL! That doesn't make sense either!
---
I mean you’re the only sane comment. People stating that they have 95% mana through an entire encounter must be /dance during LFR Halls of Containment. That’s totally fine. Your spec has the ability to push the mythic level but not at its base. If that’s you’re goal, cutting edge or AOTC, then to get it you need gear and the level gains are your rewards along with the other goodies. If you’re satisfied and think why do that raid again but harder? Then you’re not a hardcore raider. That’s awesome, but don’t put false info out there because your perspective is so narrow.  Most of you commenting wouldn’t be able to get Cutting Edge even if you tried to just prove a point, I haven’t yet and I say this because I’m not boasting about anything. I imagine the few that could get some kills would not get much further than half the current tier down. Trust me here, all your too much mana problems are solved in a mythic raid. Your “DPS is easy, mechanics are dumbed down” ideas will be proven wrong. Hell you already know you’re wrong. But I bit this time. You bastards.
---
Exactly, I s going to be an undead

Forstbolt frostbolt frostbolt

Dude, I love PvP. Literally 90% of my time in WoW over the last 14 years has been in PvP. And yet, 90% of that time was on PVE realms because while World PvP can be fun (operating word being "can"), I find it much more fun to be able to choose when I want to PvP (BGs) and when I want to gear up/farm up my toons in peace with my wife.
---
No, I'm not a scrub. I've hit 2200+ many times on many meme specs (double boomy in 2s, prot pally in 2s, etc) and yet I will definitely not be rolling Horde or PvP realm.
---
And believe me, I'm not the only Alliance PvP tryhard that will roll on a PVE realm; I bet by bottom copper on that.
---
Logging in.
---
Nice try!
---
I don't think it really matters as long as it's named thex. This sub is really elitist about racials. There's no point in a 2-second stun on a 2-minute cooldown when you can just have a stunning name 100% of the time.
---
You cant just call it "tribe" or "quest".
---
Could have been autocorrect
---
1: I have to disagree here. When Vanilla came out, nobody knew about it until they played it and you can't deny its success.
---
2: I have to disagree for the reason stated above. My friend will be playing Classic WoW and has never played WoW in his life. It took no more convincing on my part than what could be accomplished by an ad.
---
Druid: Shapeshifting, tree-hugging elf or cow-person.
---
Hunter: A hunter who traps their enemies and shoots them from afar. Has an animal buddy.
---
Mage: Yer a wizard. Freeze your enemies and shatter them with shards of ice, burn them to death in a fiery explosion, or cast Magic Missiles and roll your D20.
---
Rogue: Sneak. Stab. Steal.
---
Shaman: Uses totems and calls upon the elements to enhance their fighting abilities, attack their enemies from a distance with lightning bolts, and heal their allies.
---
Paladin: A warrior who smites their enemies and heals their allies with holy magic.
---
Priest: A... uh... priest who calls upon the Light to heal their allies.
---
Warlock: Yer a scary wizard. Summon demons to fight for you and wield dark magics to defeat your enemies.
---
Warrior: A heavily armored fighter who charges headfirst into battle either to protect their allies or to just smash their enemies.
---
Your friend is more likely to be influenced by an ad than a friend who played the game? Lolwut
---
The difference being many more people already know about classic now then knew about vanilla in 2005
---
Well,  sick days it is then friend.
---
I'm going to reserve my names immediately and then delete them and set up race/class/appearance like a week later (assuming the system allows it). I feel like that's the time period I'm least likely to get sniped, since everyone who wants to reserve will have already but launch hasn't happened either.
---
They will have appearance change for sure easy $
---
Meme specs will raid and see naxxramas in classic. They'll just take longer to get there.
---
I've got that monday off anyways :)
---
Source?
---
Wont be unplayable. All the latest retail launches have been relativley smooth. Small downtimes for certain realms, lag etc. They got this down pretty good now imo
---
You couldn’t connect with your character? You are your character. Feelsbad
---
I don't think in vanilla.  But it seems with Pservers boosted the desire to do that because that's all they were offering.
---
There needed to be an optional question on what role druid mains will focus on.
---
That's a good strategy OP. Pretending like that's the name you actually want to weed out the competition by tricking people into trying to take a name you don't actually care for. That's less people to compete against so props for this lol.
---
Good thing my uncle works for Blizzard.  Free WoW for life!
---
I am taking almost a month off work at launch, I am legitimately going to have two 60s in the first month.
---
just reread what i said and im laughing now. i can see how that could appear to be a different language
---
For me and my friends, we have already agreed on what faction and server type we are playing on. I will most likely be ther person who decides what server name we play on tho as most of them will be busy at work when the name reservation occurs.
---
Can I take that bet?
---
Everyone knows crocs eat ass like no other.
---
You need to brush up on the freshest, dankest memes bud
---
I am a simple man. I see madseason, I upvote.
---
Especially not both your elbows
---
Actual GOLD!
---
Need some meme spec optional questions, like what role druid mains plan to focus on. 17% warrior, 9% druid, and 14% tank; I wonder how that breaks down (shoutout to prot pallies too).
---
Gatekeeping to the max there, mate.
---
Danes here reporting in - will this be PvP?
---
Did you calculate the value of cleave with 5 sunders on the mobs vs rending mobs that have 5 sunders? Rend would become worse depending on kill time especially at later ranks as well where its dependent on how long it needs to stay up. Also with deep wounds , was that calculated to only be effective for half of the mobs health? Since on average , a deep wound proc wouldnt generally last the entire duration. Especially with multiple crit procs overwriting each other. 2 back to back crits wouldnt mean double deep wounds damage basically
---
&gt; and the character is going to have 24/7 uptime until 60
---
So YOU aren't getting realm first 60. You're cheating.
---
Attempt to make a Thex on every server until the name is taken, the join ally and make “ThexSlayer” and hunt you.
---
Yeah, never mind Bobby Kotick ex-CEO of Activision is CEO of Activision Blizzard and engineered the merger of Activision and Vivendi Games resulting in Activision Blizzard. They totally called the company Activision Blizzard because their equal parts and not because Blizzard was the cash cow they acquired Vivendi for. Activision has no impact on Blizzard. The CEO from Activision just oversees them without requiring anything of them.
---
Thanks for the gold mate!

Looking for EU Alliance priest, pref dorf, as healer for 5 man dungeon leveling all the way to 60. Our prelim schedule is 30hr/9hr sleep/24+hr/9hr sleep/24hr etc, but it is negotiable. 
---
We have our own test server where we are testing  and polishing the route as classic draws nearer, so you would get to try out first to see if it's a good fit. 
---
You would be leveling with the MT, raid leader and guild leader (yes all three different persons) of a hardcore raiding guild, so we'd more than likely have a raidslot for ya when it is all done, but passing on tagging up is not a deal breaker if you don't feel like it.
---
Moderate IQ and basic understanding of the game is all we ask of you, what we are looking for most of all is dedication. The rest we can and will teach ya. No raiding or even class experience required otherwise, just the willingness to learn and drive to 60 as fast as possible.
---
Looking forward to heaing from ya, don't be shy. Everyone will be considered.
---
I have almost 250 hours of PTO, I made it clear that my request for 3.5 weeks off starting on the 27th was not a request.
---
Honestly my goal is to get into nax. If i can make it that far ill be really happy.
---
More realistic goal is having full t2 and rank 10 pvp. I say im going to play hardcore and i have the time to devote to the grind for aq40 and naxx but have never done it so i really dont know until i get there.
---
I wonder though, if you only intend to take skinning for mount gold, is it better to simply accept getting your mount a bit later? I can't remember how gold scales.

Only the Tuxedo Jacket has a level requirement, you could still wear the shirt and pants.

Gonna offtank/dps for my guild and suck up gear so fast i cant wait. Gladly heal when my tanking is not needed as well. Huge reason im rolling dudu. Barley any competition for tier gear. And easier way to gear out tanking core since feral tank pieces usually dont compete with warr tanks

\[NA Alliance PVP\] LF1M Warlock for 5 man dungeon leveling rush to 60. Must be able to play 36 (possibly 24) hours first day then 16 on /8 off schedule after that until 60. We have the group and route 100% figured out already and need 1 more Lock to make it happen. You must have practiced the lvl 1-18 route and be ready to rush to 17-18 with the rest of the group to begin deadmines. We all have the whole first week off and are a fun and experienced bunch to play with. Please PM me if you want more info on discord. @Alvanos#5706

Nice try but you’re not stealing my name you squatter
---
And my sword
---
You're not getting Realm First 60 without being WAY ahead of the average player so how is your friend going to be in a position where he will be able to help you?
---
I, too, enjoy the Jägermeister.
---
A user yesterday made a thread about only having to wait two weeks until character creation. He mentioned the name he was going to use and now it became a meme.
---
You gotta play Alliance not filthy Horde.
---
Gear looks brilliant on tauren, just dont show helm. And hey fuck boots, we have hoofs!
---
That would be a good problem to have
---
If it's not an exploit, it's not cheating. This is stupid.
---
They did.  
---
It was called the beta.
---
The release is global there’s a timetable for launch on blizzards site it’s 3pm on the 26th for those on the North American west coast 6pm for those in the east, 11pm on the 26th for those in London, and midnight for those on Central European time.

Based on the questions you're asking, you won't get it. People have been mastering this for years
---
All of the countdowns are correct, including the one on the official blizzard page. If you google wow classic countdown you can go to any number of pages with an accurate clock for the world release time.
---
And my upvote
---
What is this thex you speak of. Anylne have the background of the name? This meme is gunna take off i feel it
---
You actually don’t have to own BFA to play classic and I strongly advise anyone who didn’t buy it to continue to not buy it.
---
anyone planning to play on Asian servers? TW or KR

Theory: the Beta was the advertisement.

---
dont happen to be aussie ? 1 night a week raid guild sounds amazing :)
---
All valid points but you forgot to mention the most important thing to name your shaman thex
---
Ya I'm not going to buy BfA. It's the one thing I can still do, to show that I'm not interested in retail.
---
To have people running around in MC 2handers would mean that so many raids are forming with people leveling to 60 and getting pre-bis within the first month which wont happen.
---
The people who will have MC 2handers are the real hardcore guilds and even then thats not that many. Most of what you gonna encounter for at least the first or two months of the game will be blue geared people with barely any epics.
---
Seems like you think I sound like someone who sounds like someone who sounds something like someone who sounds like me would sound like.
---
Sounds like you've got the August 27th Flu. Real nasty I hear.
---
That thing they had to shut down because they let the population get embarrassingly low, when a BFA content patch dropped?
---
Create a shaman named thex
---
red is dead
---
I had no memorable issues with the bfa launch. I took time off work for it no-lifed it starting an hour before the launch time. From what I remember, it started with a brief lag spike, and load screens took a few minutes during the first few hours, but it was otherwise fine. I think the servers crashed a few times, but I was able to log back in within the hour each time.
---
not to mention you won't know the big streamers' realm until sometime after character creation. We have to wait for [http://www.avoidstreamers.com/](http://www.avoidstreamers.com/) to get updated first. Otherwise, you'll waste your money reserving your name on a shit realm.

Sounds like you need to file for worker’s compensation or disability.

Can you explain why you agree that "every point of armor reduction is more valuable than the last." 
---
* From my understanding while DR is on a curve, Time to Live/Effective Health Scales linearly with Armor. 
---
* See graph for example with both DR and effective health on the same graph (TBC formula):

---
 It isnt 2 weeks time irl, it's time played in game. If you can reasonably get to 60 in 14 days played, you're likely doing it wrong. I should find no issue getting to 60 in 7 days played.
---
Your hate is misguided, young one
---
Servers will be fine. The only thing that will stop them is a massive DDOS.
---
As a shaman named thex i will have plenty of insta cast spells so idc
---
Is this the first meme of Classic?
---
It’s bi big deal for me. I just scroll past them since I’m used to all the site that are like this. It’s not gonna change
---
You could up that to 18+ hours a day on weekends and add another day and a third for 2 weekends.
---
I didn't put it on the sheet, but it's pretty easy to do. Just go into the cleave section and replace the "e" term with the "j" term, corresponding to the damage that gets past armor after 5 sunders are applied instead of zero sunders.
---
I will note though, this affects thunderclap's damage to the same extent, so in terms of choosing between tclap and cleave, it actually makes tclap BETTER relative to cleave. Because cleave now gets more expensive (As the autoattack you gave up would have given you more rage), and tclap stays the same price. 
---
In short, you can do it, but I doubt it will be super practical until you literally just cannot spend more rage on sunder thunderclap. At which point, you have to either add rend or cleave, or start executing stuff which will mess up spirit tap for your priest.
---
You are right, you do have to rend specifically mobs that will be alive for 15 seconds, at level 20. I don't feel that is super hard, as even a group that is focusing 1 target at a time looks to be killing them in no less than 7.5 seconds. So just don't rend the first mob you attack, and you should be fine. But you do have to do it. This is listed under the "assumptions" slide of the presentation, which I would recommend looking over. 
---
Deep wounds will be much worse in this method, but frankly, if you are spamming sunder, you want improved overpower first anyways. 
---
First of all, sunder armor cannot proc deep wounds but it CAN proc overpower, and sunder is just a lot of attack rolls on a target with full health, which is the perfect type of mob to drop an overpower proc and deep wounds on.  
---
And secondly, improved overpower is just more damage than deep wounds at 5% crit chance. It's a better, more impactful ability, that is better than both cruelty and deep wounds even if deep wounds ticks to full duration, and remains so until you have a couple points in cruelty. or axe specialization. 
---
And if you DO overpower on a sunder, and crit? the mob almost certainly has the health to soak the full damage, as you are deliberately sundering full health mobs. 
---
As for how deep wounds was calculated, it's not included at all in this sheet. I have done other spreadsheets on the ability, but the dps contributions of talents is not included on this sheet, because they are very small compared to the effect of your actual rotation and the way your abilities interact with each other. I do make a talent recommendation, but the math behind that recommendation is kind of outside the scope of this presentation. 
---
Suffice to say, even if you don't even use sunder, improved overpower is better than either cruelty or improved rend, as long as your target is not spending a significant portion of it's time stunned. If you do spam sunder constantly? improved overpower is WAY better (because you get more overpower chances relative to deep wounds chances and because overpower is advantaged relative to deep wounds when hitting sundered mobs instead of not sundered mobs).
---
The servers are virtual. They are rented from a provider so it's not Blizzards infrastructure you gotta worry about.
---

It isn't surprising to me with how many europeans are playing. Most of them get like, what, at minimum 4 weeks vacation a year? If I had that kind of time i'd be taking a week or more off as well.

My first wow char in 2007 was named „nebola“.
---
I took forever to find that name, and sat like 30 minutes in creation screen thinking.
---
Today, I have read so many bad jokes with the name and the Disease Ebola .. i am pretty tired of it. 
---
So I just take the name Nebo. Which means like Sky in Serbian or something
---
Asap when we know the realm names
---
They may be taking a week+ off and then will be playing 2-4 hours a day after that.
---
I am curious too. Btw did you use react for this app?
---
I was thinking of erotic roleplay, so maybe something like "Sex" but with a lisp. Shaman ofc
---
Pretty sure the names are reserved for 30ish days after you delete the character, for character restoration purposes
---

---
Unfortunately not. Central US. But I encourage you to find a similar Aussie group, and if one doesn’t exist, start one! Recruiting has been a breeze, as many people want a leaner schedule but few guilds seem willing to meet the demand.
---
Yes Denmark is nordic+scandinavian ;) even though as a swede I would like to banish Denmark to hell! DANSKJÄVLAR! Nah just kidding mah danish brothers...or am I?! &lt;3
---
Suppose I am armor man, and you are mr glass man. 
---
As armor man, on your graph, I have 30,000 effective health and ~20,000 armor. 
---
You have ~2000 armor and about 9673 effective health. Shoulda bought some armor. 
---
If each of us lose 2000 armor, you lose 2173 effective health, and I lose the exact same amount of effective health. 2173. That's what your statement means. Effective health scaled linearly. 
---
But where does that leave us? you lost like 20% of your total effective health pool, and change.
---
I didn't. I had like 30k and now I have 30k-2173. That's not 20% of my EHP at all. It's like 8% or something. 
---
That's why armor matters more the less you have of it. this is still the same underlying phenomenon, we are just using two different mathematical approaches, which both share the same conclusions when applied to the same practical problems.
---
This sound about right. I feel like you're following the money. Which is a good way to analyze blizzard the way it is now.
---
Paid name change was a whole year before the merger.
---
What are you implying here?
---
\*Looks over at Blizzard's other half dozen IPs that have been launching over the years\*
---
Not outside WoW itself. There are stories of addons mailing all your gold to a set character though but I'm not sure if they still exist.
---
please list some i cant find any.
---
Speaking of name reservation on August 16/17. Is the reservation period only going to be open during a limited time frame? Like do servers only come up to create characters for a few hours? A day? Etc. Or can we create and customize a character any time between then and launch? I'd be afraid to reserve a name on the 16th and then try to delete and remake how I actually want to look on launch and someone takes name (Thex) while I'm picking options. I'd prob want to try and do the actual customization on a random night between then at off hours to reduce name snipe.
---

Yes, the first 4 weeks of solid 150k+ twitch viewers and article upon article before everyone got level cap and quit. Yes.
---
Too bad only 3 names allowed to be reserved per account :/
---
I think it's funny how this sub is, at times, so intent on min-maxing that they'll play Dwarves in cloth to get fear ward, but also really wants to waste an hour running from Darkshore to a less efficient zone for leveling. Not saying it's hypocrisy or overlap, but it's funny.
---
a man needs an explanation.
---
They announced at blizzcon, they had streamers announce beta date... what the fuck y'all need from them?
---
They aren't selling the game - why would the market it..............?
---
People expect blizzard to make hundreds of millions of dollars from classic... not gon hap, money put into a big advertising campaign would be wasted.
---
We'll get a "After 15 years Azertoth needs it's travellers again" type video when we get closer to launch- again it's just fan service, not to bring in 55 million players.
---
I'm just making a joke. He said it was a 'thing' so I threw in a bit about the beta being a ghost town. There were several streamers asking them to either add players, or just shut it down. Since it was becoming a turn off, not an advert for classic.
---
Crystal meth.
---
Wrong. I had a Tyrandé myself because I couldn’t come up with a food name. When I finally had one in mind, I asked a guildmate to report me, so I could change names.
---
We also had a metric fuckton of Ârthás, Îllïdan and so on. If it was AEIOU you could be sure someone would put ˋ ^ ´ on top of it
---
Incorrect, in the beta anyone who deleted from the guild to try out Horde, I would immediately log off and steal their name.
---
How much does activision pay you to shill for them?
---
But it won’t be 15k either, and while you can setup stable server in some public DC which is capable of supporting 15k concurrently it doesn’t mean 150k connections would be the same. Retail servers experience lots of load at the expansion starting weeks but I would assume that That load will pale in comparison with Classic launch. 
---
What I pray for is that one more global start will bring global raid openings in near future.
---
Raiding doesn't require much time until you start hitting AQ and especially Naxx. So you've got a year or two to figure that out.
---
What happens then if you delete a character by mistake and want to recover it? Free name change?
---
Ya. At the start it was good. It's just sad because by the end it was working as a deterrent. It was sort of showcasing what trolls would say. "Classics gonna die in two months LOOOOL" then the beta just happened to die like that :/
---
It looks great on my tablet! I looked at a few of the maps and they're gonna be extremely helpful.   
---
I noticed that in SFK the slides seemed to be out of order. Arugal's map was incorrectly placed as the second to the last. By no means does it diminish its usefulness, but I'm sure you'd want to fix it.  
---
Thanks for putting this up here!
---
Hi, I shall be the great undefeated champion shaman of the world of azeroth!... thy name is Thex.
---
You honestly think Blizzard-Activision wants a game they’re charging $15/mo for to fail? So your thought process is... Blizzard doesn’t want to earn money off our subscription?
---
Come on, guys, I know the lack of a realm list is a pain in the ass, but OBVIOUSLY Blizz wants classic to succeed.
---
Gnomes with cat mounts are ny favorite
---
Is that even legal?
---
My warrior and my friend the Druid wont be letting anyone live, unless they're maybe leveling as a group then we weigh the fight and live to fight another day
---
We can maybe take 3 but 4 would be pushing it :P
---
You don't need pre-raid BiS to clear MC. First few weeks will be hardcore yes, but after a couple months it won't be that rare
---
I don't think they will advertise until after launch to minimise potential launch issues.
---
Jesus Doc, that is the coolest response to the uncoolest attack I've ever seen! Big applause from a fan (Batjohn here) for that!
---
And to Mr. Assburger, may all of your bags be accounted for in an informal video, thus bringing you peace...
---
That's not even close to true
---
Not Alliance's fault cows are stupid and go into a lake if they cant swim
---
1) Clear at least BWL and get T2.
---
2) Reach Rank 10 (maybe 11 for the mount)
---
3) make some of PvP Twinks
---
4) ???
---
If he was expendable he wouldn't have earned more. They would've let him walk. This doesn't make any sense.
---
It is a way of tanking that requires usable items and being forced into a profession (which tbh everyone should have anyways but still). Most tanks don't want to use anything except their abilities to tank which is fair I think. 
---
I'd 100% take a paladin tank to Strath/Scholo instead of a warrior but that's about the only place.
---
I believe it was fixed already in the beta.
---
" We started this whole project as a love-letter to the fans - they've  been demanding this from us. We wanted to respond and give them what  they've been asking us for. We will continue to listen to community  feedback, and we want to know what people think and want to see next.  "

---
Your not always slamming though. You need to bloodthirst and time the gcd with the swing timer so you don't miss out on a slam. At high ilvl or if hit you also need to dump rage at the same time. It makes a pretty interactive raiding experience compared to most classes.
---
As you say, in either case the end result is that you have to do 2173 less damage to the target. In that sense each point of armor reduction was of equal value. Which I think is the more relevant way to look at it. 
---
Thank you for going through that. That made it clear to understand where you are coming from.
---
**"From the launch of Classic, how long do you anticipate it will take you, in real-world-time, to reach level 60?"** was the question in the poll so I'm going from that.
---
They stated during the media summit interviews that there wouldn't be an Armory at launch but that it would likely come later.
---
Yeah :) Just complaining about Google. You would think they could easily have the capacity for a tiny feature like that.
---
One of the reasons why layering is in the game is that it prevents massive queues. For that reason alone I give it a thumbs up. Would absolutely suck to sit there at launch after a decade of screaming at Blizzard, only to be stuck in a 6 hour queue. 
---
Luckily the EU launch is at midnight so I suspect the servers will clear up a lot after a few hours.
---
Well that's one server I want to avoid.
---
Mine’s obscure enough that I’m still afraid someone is going to nab it.
---
Time to call in sick
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
Phase 3's got some fun content like Blackwing Lair, Darkmoon Faire, Alterac Valley and Warsong Gulch. Phase 2 will let us gain Honor from PvP but we'll have to wait until Phase 3 to gain lots of it via Battlegrounds.
---
So true. Sadly seems a lot of ppl are tired of hearing said truth tho =P
---
And this is the problem. Right here. This fucking regurgitated bullshit.
---
A ret pally/spriest/feral who even remotely gives a shit is NOT, ever, doing "less than half" the dps of an average or below-average player playing a pure dps class. 
---
Just stop your bs propaganda and go read/watch/otherwise educate yourself, you fucking ignorant, no-critical thinking, parroting peasant.
---
Yeah I mean, if you want to cheery pick a situation where tanks dont have professions then sure, paladins will have better AoE threat. But they will take way more damage, and I can't stress this enough they have mana. A run will always be longer with a Paladin then a Warrior and Druid, If we assume equal skill and gear. Regardless of profession. Its just that Engineering gives Warriors such an edge.
---
unless you strictly follow a guide and only do questing and grinding it will take you about 8-10 days played to get to 60. Like if you do some pvp and do dungeons (which i recommend). Expect it to take about a month of playing 6-8 hours a day
---
My alt will either be a feral druid or ret paladin. As a warlock there are like two items I need in MC so I should be able to get in there fairly quickly on the alt. I'll only be there for the PvP gear though. I don't particularly like melee dps and boomkin is very boring to play. I love PvP as a druid/paladin though so I'll try and nab some good stuff in there.
---
Im not saying any hunter will want to play it, just that to get the most efficiency out of it, you should give it to a hunter
---
its not the players really. its the environment. players are the same guys as everywhere.  
---
the difference is that trashtalking and generally annoying behavior is tolerated on private servers.  
---
not everyones a friend of that.
---
Unless you are committed to go oomkin, the only interesting talents in balance are nature's grasp (mostly to access the next tier) natural weapons (10% extra damage with 5 points) omen of clarity for sweet procs and maybe natural shapeshifter to reduce shapeshifting mana and thus allow you to be more annoying to the enemy. Those are 11/14 points, if you add the 21 in resto for NS, that would just left you 16/19 on feral, so no faery fire, savage fury or heart of the wild, so trying to pick from the 3 specs is not really a good idea

---
WowSephiroth
---
Agree that is what makes twinks so strong. But I would still argue that it continues to be just as relevant the more you stack it. Each point makes you exactly 10 health stronger... No more, no less.
---
I don't agree. I've run Strath/Scholo very fast with paladins and they don't run out of mana if they know how to manage it. It's more the DPSers that has to drink except if you're running triple warlocks at which point only the healer has mana issues. Paladin, paladin, mage, warlock, warlock is a really good group. 
---
Warriors as I said has to use consumables to tank which most players definitely object to. There's also a limit on the threat of the sappers/helm whereas paladins can actually increase their threat as gear becomes better. A paladin can easily pull 300-400 TPS on every single mob without running oom and that's way enough for even hellfires to not pull aggro. The sapper charges and other AoE bombs also have a 5 minutes cooldown and the gigaflux helmet has a 30 minutes cooldown. A warrior can do massive pulls with this thing but it has such a long cooldown that it takes longer than several smaller pulls with a paladin. A geared paladin tank btw can do just as massive pulls, especially with bubbles and double kiting. What the paladin desperately lacks is Challenging Shout for when things go wrong, also something like last stand or shield wall. So it's definitely easier to do with a warrior. You also pretty much need a paladin in that warrior group because without salvation the warrior can't hold aggro.
---
Just wear the heirloom shoulders ;)
---
In short, you need to have a lot of SP to be effective. Having just a little bit of it will necessarily sacrifice some Spirit that contributes to your mana regeneration (and therefore your ability to continue your quest/dungeon without having to stop to drink).

---
Definitely true though and luckily the enchant is fairly cheap so you can update your new shoes. Also don't forget the riding enchants and spurs, you can get 9% speed in total from them.
---
Me, as a shaman named Thex, won't tolerate other name callings.
---
So it would probably be best to have an int enchant on one skinning knife and a spellpower enchant on another and then switch them at about level 20 or so. Maybe 24 for the new corruption for warlocks.
---
Druid PvP in any spec isn't about sitting in cat form at all, you will die so easily. You have to use all the tools available. You seem dead set on sitting in cat form alot bit haven't taken swiftness, but taken furor any way. 
---
Feral charge is a must. Feline swiftness is a must. Natural shapeshifter is very helpful. 3 points in HT is pointless. 
---
Take charge, feline swiftness, natural shapeshifter.
---
Drop points in thickhide, improved healing touch and natural weapons to get them.
---
&gt;If this would be a retail expansion,
---
And that's where we stop this nonsense :)
---
It's not a new ip and not a new expansion.
---
It cost them time to get the servers ready, but not enough to justify hundreds of thousands of dollars in an ad campaign for a game that's essentially an add on to their main game.
---
Please write an ad that isn't laughable -
---
 "Come back to wow classic - all you need is a subscription to World of Warcraft and you get access to World of Warcraft* up to legion expansion, which is the old expansion, and access to Classic Wow - where your characters are entirely different and can't play with your regular World of Warcraft characters"
---
Thanks good to know.
---
His dps tests are against a dummy, which doesn't dodge, so the numbers are inflated because of that.
---
Also it hits shaman very hard. A dodge means no flurry proc, no windfury proc, no dmg until the next AA, which is 3-3.8 sec away. A warrior attacks much faster, so a single dodge isn't as impactful.
---
We have a winner
---
Can we actually do this though? I haven't heard many details about this so I don't know.
---
I once deleted a lvl 40 something because I wanted to change his name....
---
Actuashallly...
---
With the new macro API that classic brings you will be able to use items that do not cause a global cooldown through macrod powershifting... such as potions and some engineerings items like sappers.
---
that’s even more depressing.
---
&gt;What are the biggest differences between a paladin and a shaman (healer) for PvE and especially PvP? Which one do you think is better in a PvP environment and in dungeons/raids? Do you think totems are better than blessings for PvP and PvE?
---
Paladins buff group members and they can run around. 
---
Shamans have totems that have to be placed correctly.
---
Holy paladin is one of the best healing classes in pvp and strong in PvE.
---
Shaman idk because I played the better faction.
---
STAHP DOTS

I love when people start piping up in discord cause they thing they finally got it. “IM ON CHARACTer SELECT...I THINK I...wait....wait no, nevermind.....god damnit”
---
One post I saw was one guy using a Razer Naga mouse (it's the one with 12 buttons on the side, reeeeealy nice to have). Will make strafing hard tho but walking forward and using abilities will be easy
---
So they should instead listen to you... I see, I see
---
Seems like people just have to choose between you - Mr. Right &amp; false and other opinions around this reddit that are more open minded towards diverse playstyles.
---
I’m again rolling a palatank and will again have fun rolling through dungeons and stuff. And sure I’m healing in raids. But it’s nice to do that in 1 specc.
---
Maybe you rethink the whole idiot thing... makes people wonder if you might be the idiot.
---
I never had many problems with the pet management so not sure what is buggy about it, will see when servers go live.  
---
As you mentioned the races determine what is better for pve and pvp but think orc is best pick but that is my personal preference I guess.  
---
Hunter is not harder  to master then other classes and by the time you start raiding you should be able to know how to play your class just like warlocks, mages and druids need to know their jobs.
---
As for professions I would go for engineering and not something like leatherworking. Engineering has a lot of items that actually require you to have engineering while pretty much all items you make with leatherworking are bind on equip so let someone else take the profession and just buy those items you really need from it.  
---
Engineering also shines with pvp so yeah if you focus also on that go for engineering.
---
Good god I hate that word so much
---
I thought about the differences yesterday for a sight moment and concluded that in classic, I’d watch the enemies more and interacting with the environment more, while in BfA I just look at my spells most of the time to see what gets reset etc. 
---
That was a horrifying realization. It’s not fun to have to look at the spell bar in a fight, but here we are.
---
It's called lucidmorph now but ya
---
2hours per weekday + 12hours per weekend day is 5.5hours week average. For someone like me with a work but no kids and a wife playing along me it's not so off. Kinda what i'm currently doing during my week anyways
---
Clear NAXX on my priest main and kill emperor taurassan maybe some MC and ZG with my fiance
---
Definitely anyone willing to store materials in prevision of upping a crafting skill later should get a bank alt or two, bank space is getting filled so fast!
---
😂
---
Naw dawg, you can most definitely skip Holy Shield. It costs a shit ton of mana and is the primary cause why Protadins go oom, not to mention the stacks get absorbed pretty quickly. Rank1 consecrate, bosanc and imp. Ret will deal much better with aoe packs and keep your threat up just fine. You just seem to have an agenda against Paladins tanking 5 mans, go cry warrior in some other thread
---
What's that song called, from lord of the rings I believe?
---
I had my own name with speical characters in TBC
---
There is one clear answer. Thex.
---
What?! Defense helps with crits, Protadins love to be critted so your talents actually pop. Come on man, spending talent points in defense for pve is utter garbage
---
&gt;Are DM Lasher runs viable from the start and/or are there better methods?
---
When DM is added to the game, sure. You only need holy nova and certain number of maximum mana (that allows you to kill the mobs). Lasher runs for a priest is great, since you can do it blindfolded, while watching tv at the same time. The HERBS you can collect during the run make up a LOT of the profits, so be a herbalist. You will gain TON of dreamfoil (mana pots), some gromsblood (nice cash). And make sure you remember to check for book spawns.
---
DME 2-man jump runs are another good way to make gold, if you have a geared warrior friend. (DIS)enchanting can increase profits on that and the warrior should have mining.
---
Best simple advice I've seen in regards to professions on this sub is just make sure your skills are your level times 5. I'd say just make markers every 5 levels. So at 20 your skills are 100, at 25 they're 125, at 30 they're 150, etc. Then you know your on track and if you're not you aren't very far behind to catch up.
---
Wtf that swim takes longer than the whole wetlands/loch modan run
---
&gt; I’ll make you a simple deal: I won’t - if you stop acting like unhealthy game habits automatically equals addiction.
---
I never said it did.
---
But I did say it's wrong to encourage it.
---
I, for one, will be spending way more than a reasonable time on WOW in the first few weeks. Definitely not 12+ hours a day for a week, but more than enough.
---
&gt;As for the rest, I see nothing to suggest from you that you’re gonna take me out of that box
---
I never put *you* in a box. I was implying that *some* people other than you may feel validated by your comments that spending 16+ hours a day for a week can be totally acceptable and healthy for you to do. Types of people who *do not* need their addictions validated.
---
I was neither implying nor discounting the possibility that you were one of these people. I wasn't making a judgement on that either way cause the message doesn't change. If you are addicted, you should probably refrain from telling people it's totally healthy. And if you aren't addicted, you should probably refrain from telling people it's totally healthy.
---
I was saying that you shouldn't go around telling people it's totally good for your health if you just bust out a couple of squats every hour and stay hydrated. I wasn't saying much about you personally at all.
---
I agree, we don't really need a taunt because with our toolkit mages and warlocks can easily aoe packs down without worrying they'll die. If they do get aggro, the Protadin just BoPs you and it's all gucci. Definitely nicer experience than with a warrior
---
After 13 years of the same gamer tag (originating with my first wow character) I am going to try to get a new name for my main and retire the old name to an alt. But if someone takes the name I want before I get to it, I'm sticking with my tried and true name.
---
The reason why Finns are never invited to any kind of project like this.
---
Are you complaining about jumper cables being too common in BfA or saying that they are not used outside of classic? Because neither is true.
---
Granted, they are used somewhat differently in BfA, basically only to res the healer after/during a wipe, because a lot of classes + night elves can essentially vanish/feign death/invis to get out of combat (rogues, hunters, mages, maybe more). So it's fairly common when you fuck up a death run or stuff like that to have a random dps with engineering save the day.
---
Thx! Just watching that amount of swimming+running to go from one zone to another just took away 50% of my eagerness to play Classic. Now I can wait another month
---
go break your leg or something
---
damn! Yeah def might look into creating one it with a few RL mates i have playing :)
---
&gt; Concecration is 91,2 tps with Imp Righteous fury (which costs like a 1/4 or 1/5 of the paladins mana). 
---
So, you are assuming the paladin has zero spelldamage and mana pool on their gear?
---
High cost for little return, Game requires a sub to play (No purchase!), It won't have extra microtransactions unless they decide to start making changes to classic.
---
Going in to be a father in the next 3 weeks as well. Really looking forward to the bonding time. Gonna buy myself „a suit“ where the baby is attached to your upper body/chest/belly. I’ve seen a lot of people walking around with it. So the baby can potentially sleep and creat a bond at the same time i can play for a few minutes/hours. Not sure how the „suit“ is called in English cause I’m not a native.

BGs won't even be out until months after classic. People aren't going to have free time like they had back in the day... If BGs only consisted of people in your realm, people probably won't even queue which kills BGs entirely.

Dude, as far as my employer is concerned, I'm leaving country on launch day. Much easier to get the vacation approved, especially in summer.
---
&gt;burning steps
---
Gank them on sight?
---
Go away
---
Warriors doesnt need to use engineering items tho, They can to speed up the run due to the damage, They literally only need the engineering shield, which any self respectable tank will get I even had like 4 of them. and even without it there is a shield from a quest that gives you a 100% block chance proc, together with shield spikes you can do pretty hefty aoe threat while spamming demo shout.
---
And Paladins are better at building aoe threat if we assume that we cant use any consumables, Its just that its an uneffective way to do dungeons because they will either die, or will get have huge downtime, where a group with a warrior can make smaller pulls and cleave with 0 downtime.  
---
&gt; You are also missing the point of this build, it's pure for aoe tanking and you want imp ret aura in this case. Holy shield is for single target tanking. 
---
And I agree I'm missing the point of this build cause getting imp retri aura vs not is 28,5 tps vs 19 tps. For all that investment? no getting Holy shield is better then for when you actually have to tank a boss.
---
What's the point of vindication? It barely does anything, if at all. The other talents also aren't great for aoe tanking, but certainly any of them is more useful than vindication.
---
Hell yeah it does
---
It's smorc or get smorced for warriors.

---
I'm Thor from all the Thex.
---
If they are tanking a level 57 dungeon then pretty much yes? 2,2k - 2,5k mana and there is very few pieces with spell damage at that stage + paladins have bad scaling on things like conseration. If we assume BiS gear warriors are just going to destroy paladins in terms of massive dps so we can't do that.
---
It’s refreshing to see these responses.  These are the badasses of the sub right here.
---
But you have the Rogue flare, hmm
---
Perfekt! Lets go!
---
No.
---
You have my Thex
---
That's true, but it maybe should be mentioned
---
I fail to see how demoshout beats consecration and blessing of sanctuary. Engineering shield, shield spikes, even the bombs. Those are all non-factors, because a paladin has that as well.
---
Fire mages use fire blast charges as their resource management, not mana. Mana is just for your utility spells (pretty much only spellsteal as a fire mage). 
---
So yes, they might play closer to classic rogues mechanically than classic mages. If you want to play with mana you should play arcane mage or a healer. Arcane mage is all about managing your mana, it's kind of rough to play in most encounters though because they need to stand perfectly still during their ~10 second burst, which requires pretty good planning and timing. Their cleave is also shit, which can be a problem.
---
Thex is a shaman from the shadows...
---
Well, I was going to roll a Tauren Druid. But now I have no choice but to roll a female Dwarf.
---
No. They're adding more scaling (probably) and introducing a level squish ml
---
I dont down vote posts, but there is a first time for everything.
---
make sure it's a dwarf priest
---
Threaten to quit.
---
If he still refuses, quit the day of launch.

Reapply to your old position nearing the end of your vacation, as well as to other positions at less shitty jobs.

Never understood why dutch/nords are so eager to replace their culture/language for another, why you guys hate yourselves so much ?
---
That's Retail, not Classic.
---
Yeah man my username has been my Xbox gamer tag since Xbox live started and my steam name too. But it’s just not fitting for WoW. Hope you get your name.
---
Really nice. Now i know which race and profession ill take. Ty
---
I straight up murder them when they are alli and I See them
---
I mean, you probably can't fight it. Why do you care?
---
We will see Classic commercials or adds a little after launch.  There is already hype within the community for launch.
---
Sounds like BfA Arms warrior but with some ddr timing shit thrown in, and with 5 less spells.
---
So on the one hand you talk about speedrunning the dungeons, now you talk about being lvl 57 and for some reason you aoe dungeons at lvl 57 with leveling gear. You really are all over the place. Nobody would run a dungeon with this spec at level 57, because you can forget aoeing through at this stage. 
---
Consecration scales with ~4% spelldmg per tick. Yes, it's only ~8 tps per target per 100 spelldmg, but a warrior gets zero additional tps in aoe situations with better gear, so I don't see how a wrrior in bis would destroy a paladin.
---
All my female toon names will be subtle vagina euphemisms to sneak past censors.  I.E BoneQuiver. All my male names will be poop euphemisms. I.E SewerPickle
---
They have but not with a threat modifier on them, warriors deal 50% more threat with those abilities, so when we stack it alltogether warrior comes out Far far far ahead. Warriors have threat modifiers on thorns/imolation oil/dynamites/engineering shield/shield spikes, etc literally everything that deals damage or does threat. paladins only have that on **Holy spells**
---
And no Demoshout doesnt beat consecration but its not that far off which is my point, if warriors properly rotate revenge/cleave/sunders while spamming demo shout they deal enough threat for mages/warlocks to aoe things
---
So you can probably say with a 100% certainty that the name of the character won’t be the unique identifier in the database so restore it should be just fine regardless of name.
---
Yes they are by giving us classic the original great lvling experience before they screwed it all up. In retail no they are making worse like always.
---
We know.
---
My bad, thought we were on the other subreddit given the nature of the question lmao, very weird indeed then
---
I will try to explain this one last time: M0 should be the ONLY difficulty below M+. There should be no NORMAL or HEROIC. They are too easy. The baseline difficulty should be what is M0 now.
---
So ALL dungeons are M0, unless you do M+. Understand?
---
Warrior in BiS gear does massive amounts of just pure damage which is directly translated into threat with a 1,495 modifier. Which it isnt for a paladin. You know how well warriors scales with gear/weapons in classic right? DW fury/prot is probably going to shredd the entire dungeon with 1k average dps (cleave and thorns items)
---
Yeah how aweful that we are all fluent at a 2nd language - worst scenario ever right
---
I'm leading a guild consisting mostly of scandinavians. We will most likely synch up with this as well but don't put us on the list just yet. Do you have a discord where you'll quickly notch what server you've decided on?
---
I'm gonna make a warrior named Thex
---
MFW when McDonalds spends more on marketing classic than Blizzard does...
---
Or "hey how can we make new content for a classic + and iterate on the massive succes of Classic, essentialy making a wow 2 without all the mistake we made ?" 
---
One man can dream, either it will be TBC Classic or nothing at all.
---
Yes Nordics + Dutch + I guess we can include those poor sobs in Brexit too, is the way to go!
---
Go ahead and “have fun” with your memespecc playing with the bad players. 
---
You could just roll Druid and not listen to the “open minded people”
---
Or do like i do, 0healer 2 hunters and kite every boss and encounter
---
Baby is easy they sleep all the time the hard part comes while trying to game and the child is in there toddler years .
---
Vi sitter här i Venten och spelar lite DotA
---
In Classic is single mob loot and to get all lot have to shit click and not only click like tbc and above
---
PLEASE SHARE YOUR WISDOM! hahah!
---
Iv'e only managed to negotiate 2 week nights and maybe sometime on the weekends but highly unlikely.
---
Yeah Flemksh+Dutch are also welcome of course. They are always great guild mates too^^
---
Lol idk who else is going to be left on this sub when the rest of us are playing...
---
I think you have a flu comming up around launch.
---
&gt; I agree. But my issue is that the top raiders (mythic nowadays, right?) are an incredibly small amount of the population. 
---
I had this argument with someone else a while back. You guys are underestimating the amount of people raiding mythic. There are above 6000 guilds doing mythic raiding (based on 3/8 progress in BoD), so at least 120 000 people, probably closer to 200 000. We don't know the total amount of active WoW players right now, but somewhere around 2 million is probably not a terrible guess (it's unlikely to be much more at least). That means roughly 10% of the population are at least aspiring to be mythic raiders, not at all an insignificant amount of people. 
---
I agree that casual content in BfA could be a whole lot more difficult (I would certainly enjoy it way more if that was the case), but don't pretend like mythic raiding or mythic+ content is something super niche only the 1% or whatever are trying to do.
---
Lol this is classic....
---
You perfectly depicted coming home, it's a masterpiece

Ebbnflow. He mostly specializes on druids.

This sounds interesting but what measures are in place to prevent you from becoming the very thing you set out to stop?

If i remember correctly there was a addon in vanilla that had a keylogger in it. It was quickly noticed and taken down though. I would only trust curse
---
Nope. Blizzard first said International (English) only and then changed their mind on German and French servers, but Spain will not be getting one.
---
Given how each start of expansion is a shit show for the first night, even with just a software switch who trigger the first quest chain, I really can't see it being a smooth xperience considering it's on new hardware and new software achitecture (layering).
---
So it can be filled with e-sport shilling? /r/competitiveoverwatch was useful for like a week till e-sport fans littered it with garbage.

We have a discord for all the guild leaders. PM me if you want to be a part of that.

I think you've just solved it. I don't know why I didn't think of this yet. Fuck choosing or paying for re-spec I'll just double main.

As someone that finds all alcohol disgusting, what's a good wine for non-drinkers you'd recommend?

People that still give this guy attention. He has an hatred agenda against people from the pserver community. Check his post and comments. Downvote him and leave it at that.

Really they do not need commercials they have the email addresses of all the past players some good emails in the next 3 weeks will be very effective and cheap advertising.
---
Should your SO decide to breastfeed, that's a perfect time to put in a short gaming session.
---
Like others have already said, young babies sleep quite a lot, so just squeeze in a bit of leveling when the opportunity presents itself.
---
Just need to remember that your baby and SO always come first, no matter what. WoW will always be there :-)
---
so just to gate content from casuals? out of principle? Do you feel forced to run normal dungeons?
---
It's very minor. For instance, on horde side, there's a quest to turn in 6 worg hearts. In vanilla you'd have to run to Silverpine, do a quest to find the person, then accept the quest, even though said person was literally on the way to Silverpine. Now you can just get the hearts and go straight to the person without the "find" them quest.
---
We have our languages that about 0.3% of the world understand in written form and then we have a language that pretty much anyone we come in contact with understand. 
---
At home or while traveling inside the nordics we use our own language but otherwise we adapt to the situation we are in.
---
Back in Burning Crusade there was a 5boxing team of elemental shaman that would constantly farm in Skettis. As a rogue, I would delight in sapping one to desync it from the pack, only to watch the main shaman run around confused and horrified, trying to get the team back together. Killing the main shaman would totally screw the whole operation. The other shaman would just sit there doing nothing as I slowly killed them, one by one.
---
Ahhh, memories.
---
I plan on dualboxing my main (mage) and alt (warlock) at launch because of multiple reasons-
---
- I've never done it before
---
- I'm not in a rush to hit 60 (played vanilla, have seen 60 a few times)
---
- I plan on mainly playing my mage but while traveling, fishing, doing any professions, waiting for a dungeon group to form, I'll also be on my lock, be it picking herbs or farming elites.
---
This is what I plan to do in order to make my Ckassic experience as memorable as my Vanilla, Tbc and wotlk moments.
---
I want to play both classes but also don't want to be switching back and forth between the two :)
---
F's in the chat for all the Chads turned dadgamers due to fear of vasectomy's. 
---
If anyone is considering a vasectomy I can tell you all about them. Having a child if you're in the lower echelons of society is detrimental to your personal growth and well being of those around you. I don't recommend having a child unless your household can gross $100k / yr.
---
Shhh
---
Paladins are the best healers in PvP. Also very strong in PvE, best single target healers.
---
Not sure if there are resto shamans in current high quality pvp meta. Horde priests have alot better healing output than Rshamans. Strongest PvP shamans are ele/resto hybrids mostly. Purging enemies and dropping windfury for your warriors and helping out with offhealing when priests are in trouble. Also doing massive bursts when the time is right.
---
Holy paladins = best defensive healer in PvP by far.
---
Ele/Resto hybrid = totem/purge support with some offheals when needed. Also massive burst potential.
---
My shaman back in vanilla was a gatherer. I created a macro to toggle between herbs and ore and would just keep pressing the keybinds as I ran around. Otherwise normally out in the world I'd stick with herbs since they ted to be harder to sport or if in or near a cave I'd switch to ore.
---
As far as I know, Blizz is not planning to run official Classic tournaments. On the other hand, it's true that maintaining a good level of discussion would require some solid moderation. Overall, I think that competitive gaming subs can work out well - take a look at /r/spikes.

Berserking racial decreases cast time
---
You could trim a little swim time if you take the boat to theramore, i think that one runs next to the shore for quite some time.
---
This is why I am very happy with my job. I have two very good managers. Wanna take the cat to the vet ? Take half day off, I will not count it ! Need to upgrade your driver's licence ? Just leave for an hour if you have nothing urgent. Want to leave early friday ? Just come one hour earlier and that's fine ! 
---
I am sincerely sad for all the people who have bad managers, I used to have the over-authoritarian one, and also having so much work I just have to do overtime everyday.
---
Haha love this
---
For real? Do you have a guild? Do you plan on streaming? I'd love to see how that works out.
---
It just comes down to the berserking racial really. Provided that you can time your use of the racial ability correctly (once in a boss fight, get hit with enough damage to take you to 40% health), you gain a 43% haste bonus.
---
You can be healed up immediately and keep the 43% haste for the full duration.
---
Ouch no hate man!
---
Hardiness is handy too

This is going to be most used Name on classic now I’m calling it. Thanks to original poster for creating a literal meme name

I probably gonna roll on rp server because of that ? I dont know..
---
I am mid career, so its a long way from me, but in 30 years I can imagine old people's homes filled with all sorts of video games. If people are capable I can imagine Mario 64/Mario Kart being played WoW, Goldeneye and other stuff way into old age.
---
im gonna roll druid alt and tank dungeons and reroll at 60 to heal/support.
---
i think i will heal mostly cuz il have gear for it, also off tank if/when i get gear for it.
---
i dont think il go dps feral cuz of rouges getting all good dps loot, maybe way later
---
I love the idea! How are people with languages. As a Dane I suck at understanding Swedish/Finnish/Norwegian (and you properly find it hard to decipher what I say as well) ... do the major guilds welcome English as a language as well?
---
I fear that I will be stuck on a server filled with awesome players, but heavily encouraged to only join a Danish guild (and honestly, I've been more impressed by the Swedes I've been raiding with than the Danes, sorry, not sorry)
---
Best
---
&gt; It misses the whole point of the RPG in MMORPG
---
Roleplaying?
---
I never said you should not gain gear drops from new bosses. I said the power level of the gear should not exceed that of Tier 2 or Grand Marshall/High Warlord item level.
---
I'm more in favour of horizontal progression.  
---
Add more talent trees to existing classes
---
Add more tier sets with diverse stat distribution (but not high item level).  
---
Add spell books that teach new spells and abilities (like shaman earth shield, or paladin and druid taunts)
---
&gt; I wasn't really a fan of the Mythic+ in legion, because I was just doing the same shit but getting +iLvL on the same shit I had.
---
Neither am I.  I hate the +iLvL crap.  The affixes in Mythic+ are good way to add a challenge to dungeons though.
---
Not your top priority, no. But it should definitely be in the top 3. PvP servers already cater to your "full contact WoW" - you will bring absolutely 0 value to an RP realm if you're not interested in RP.
---
Yeah, have fun filling the raid then. Saying, I take "memespecs" along, but the "real" classes will get loot before them even for offspecs is like saying I won't take memespecs along. 
---
Incredibly disrespectful attitude. If you think "memespecs" are freeloaders, you might as well run with 30 people instead, mighn't you?
---
The  unique identifier in the database for characters is not the name, is a guid. That value is a better key for a database, also it has less problems because a guid will be unique across realms.

I've built 2 small ionic apps. If what you're doing is basically limited to listing and displaying wow maps I think it's a fine choice to go cross platform like react.

You are referring to the Car obviously?

One tip I've heard is to set up the crib next to your pc and tell your partner that you will handle the baby if it wakes up during the night. He/she will appreciate the sleep and you can play when the baby is ok.

I knew about the +5 axe specialization, but I decided it wasn’t worth as it only applies to 1group of weapon
---
I'll be doing it and I'll explain why: I main a Warrior. I played a Warrior in Vanilla, TBC, Wrath, and I quit in cata. Warrior is the only class that appeals to me. Warrior is HELL to level in vanilla up to 41 when you finally get MS or BT. In addition, I am in the middle east for work at launch. I do not have the luxury of taking a week-3 weeks off like you all are. I can still play about 8 hours a day. I cant play with guild mates because I am 11 hours ahead of them. I get back in September and then I have vacation. War/Priest means I can do bigger pulls and not have to bandage/eat constantly. I hate begging for groups (which is why we have guilds but I cant use mine the first 2 weeks) so I'm doing it. To anyone who doesn't like it: Tough. It doesn't break the ToS as long as I am pressing the buttons. In addition ill have 4 professions vs 2, and I can funnel gold to my Warrior for his epic mount.

two lv60 till the end of phase 1, if i dont burn out
---
I will ignore them, and probably camp them alot too. :D
---
If we're talking tanking:
---
Tauren HP is mostly irrelevant, it's only 5% btw.
---
Orcs are great before you get TF, the bonus axe skill is a big deal. Blood Fury is irrelevant for tanking.
---
Trolls are the best TF tank, bonus threat from Berserking is always good and Regeneration hillariously enough produces a tiny little bit of AoE threat.
---
I definitely spaced hardiness, but how relevant are stuns in classic?
---
Well, theory should include some logic at least. 
---
How zero marketing can help to earn more money from Classic? It can't. Period. 
---
If Classic is going to grow in the future, it will grow faster with good marketing at the beginning. Vanilla had good marketing.
---
I dont have any issue with people cheesing a Single Player game, if you want to hack it, mod it or anything else where you find enjoyment out of ruining the game experince for yourself, go for it it's your money.         
---
            
---
An MMO isnt just all about YOU and when you do things like multi box to gain an advantage in PvP, your not just ruining your experince you paid money for, your ruining everyone else's experince they paid for. I guess theres no stopping people from being giant useless sacks of shit though, for everyone who enjoys a good duel win or lose theres always going to be that pathetic kid who only gets a ride off ruining shit for others.

Berserking decreases casting time (the lower health you are, the higher the increase, with the max benefit you can get being at 40% health) along with Beast Slaying having you deal 5% increased damage to beasts, and some of the bosses bosses are beasts, like Fankriss, Princess Huhuran, Ouro, and the Bug Trio in AQ40, and Magmadar in MC.
---
No, i dont think so. The problem is consums and pre raid gear. You will just not have the time to farm it. I plan on playing 3-4 hours each day and if i roll a fury warrior i wont even have the chance to farm everything i need. Its not thwe raiding itself that is time consuming in vanilla, its the prep. Bwl consums will cost you around 400-600g each raid. You will have to farm cons worth around 1000g each week + boe pre bis epic mount etc. You will have money for the ocasional zg and mc but not anything further.

Why not tauren for the big style?
---
If people like to play a certain race because they like the looks of it, that's all good, no intention on preventing that. But its important to realize IF your intent is to bring everything out of your character then a person needs to be informed on the benefits to certain races. Also making an undead warrior will slightly decrease the chance of getting The Corrupted Ashbringer because of the under-preforming race choice.
---
I will answer your question in about two weeks time with a spreadsheet upload on the classicwow reddit, stay tuned :)
---
Too big bro. It’s all about that smol life. Plus I’ve never really played horde too much. Always been a filthy alliance player
---
Sounds weirdly extreme.
---
I'm not an accountant, and I assume it's the same in Germany as the US, but maybe not, anyway I'll try to explain it, basically accounting has to allocate money for people's vacation whether they take it or not, so the more vacation time people have the more money has to be saved to cover vacations and if everyone is holding onto years worth of vacation time the company now has large amounts of money that cant be touched to go towards covering vacation, so even though it doesnt actually cost the company money the more vacation time saved up the more accounting has to set aside, basically by not taking vacation from an accounting perspective you are making more money than you should.  As a simplified example if you get paid 1000 a week, and earn 1 week of vacation a year, accounting expects to pay you 52k a year, but holds 1k to cover your vacation, so it impacts accounting like they paid you 53k, now in year 2 they have to hold 2k because you still haven't taken vacation and they paid you 52k again so now from accounting's perspective it's 54k they are allocating for you, then in year 3 if you finally take all your vacation you still get paid 52k just like the previous years, but accounting only paid you the 3k saved for vacation and 49k in salary, so the company wasn't cost money but but it looks like they paid you 53k, 54k, and 49k, on a related note should the company need to do layoffs they have to pay out all that accrued vacation time
---
You could be me! I got 2 weeks vacation, told my familiy not to call me at all and will play 24/7 :)

Sub is 14.99 LUL

Sub is 14.99$ LUL
---
&gt; On the Horde side
---
Isn't it the only in the entire game?
---
&gt; People don't want to put the effort in anymore
---
Anymore? People never wanted to put the effort into gold farming so they were buying gold even in 2004 lol
---
Can't speak for other guilds but in BIZZNO we do accept danes and we usually use english to communicate with them, its just easier. So I wouldnt worry to much If I where you, so many different guilds will join the server so I'm sure you will find one that suits you.
---
and its almost as if im gonna need that sub two weeks later anyway... hmm
---
99% of the people on here never played vanilla on Blizzard realms. From day 1 people were bitching and moaning non stop about the game
---
Actually this wasn't normalized until Cataclysm. There was an attempt made in TBC but it didn't fly at the time.
---
Brexit means Brexit but I love playing with Dutch, sweedes etc
---

Trinket-wise there's Shard of the Fallen Star (AQ40 drop), Smokey's lighter (Strat quest reward), Ramstein's Lightning Bolts (Ramstein drop, Strat), Linken's Boomerang (Un'Goro long chain quest reward), Six Demon Bag (random drop, multiple effects, many damage-focused) and Thunderbrew's Boot Flask (ally-only, chain quest in Westfall). 
---
If you're fine with poison effects there's also Smoulderweb's Eye (Mother Smoulderweb drop, LBRS) and Chained Essence of Eranikus (ST quest).
---
I'm going to tell you right now that 15-20 elite mobs will be pretty deadly even for a paladin in BiS gear. but it seems like you want to put up a scenario where you just **Want** to aoe not because its effective or fast or even good, you just want to do it. You wouldnt AoE tank as a fury/prot warrior you would just chain cleave everything, killing 4 man packs in a few seconds. And even if you wanted to make 15-20 mobs pulls because just for the sake of it. Warriors in t3 is about the only way you would survive doing it. they have way more mitigation then paladins
---
That may be the case, but retail expansions were met by a couple of million hyped players on launch.
---
Classic will be met by several hundreds of thousands of hyped players. That is quite more manageable I think.
---
What if she's planning on rolling same server opposite faction and wants the head start so she can gank you?

Fuck. Off. You sound like a pedophile defending courting underage women because it's legal for 14 year olds to get married in India or some shit.
---
It's. A. FUCKING. EXPLOIT.
---
Try it. Its probably the only dps rotation I found fun in classic. You also get priority on 2hers which is nice.
---
What are you, some kind of moron?
---
Gnome's racial gives int and that means a slightly higher crit rate
---
Not at launch yeah, but people are being naive if they think Blizz won't introduce them a few years down the line. Just like character services will be available. Afaik blizzard makes far more money through their ingame shop than sucscriptions
---
Go cat form, kill mobs till your health is below 20%, heal up, rinse and repeat. You don't run out of mana.
---
Well... You can't put every multiboxer in the same box though. 
---
There are multiboxers that don't even do PVP and IMO that is totally fine. If you just find it challenging to Play multiple characters at the same time and try to clear PVE Content doing that - that is totally OK :P
---
But stay the hell out of PVP with 10 Shamans spamming chain lightning and lightning bolt and fire Nova totem :p
---
Honestly, as someone who's set out to SM with 3 warriors, a hunter and a shaman on a private server to get mail gear for all of us, if you're spamming dungeons its not that bad. If it's your primary source of xp, by the time you move on to a new place everyone will have like a solid 80% of what loot they want from those dungeons. At least for the shorter ones like SM wings, SFK and deadmines. Things like WC and Gnomer probably less so.
---
Unless something had changed in last months and a half (i haven't followed the classic scene in this period), classicdb.ch seems like the go to site, no?
---
I can't wait
---
To complicate things further, I'm pretty sure stacking stamina+intellect is better for PvP. 
---
It might be better to just outline what each stat gives a mage, and let people choose themselves. 
---
Useful SP coefficients btw: 1 spell power adds 0,814 damage to a frostbolt, and 0,04125 damage to each blizzard tick. Phrase that however you want it, but if people understand that they can most likely value it themselves.
---
I hear it's a  [pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrupted_Blood_incident)
---
I agree with this. We can agree that release week will be a shit storm even without advertising. The big question is what happens a few weeks or months down the road.
---
This way, people won't be oversaturated by promo materials and these can have that much more impact in let's say October. Which will lead to steadying the sub count (if people quit) or even increasing it month to month/Q to Q.
---
Staggered launch makes most sense financially and coincides with what is probably the best for quality of life for the Classic community.
---
Ooo good idea! I'm going to create a shaman named Thex!
---
Just get the sub in the same day LUL. Its like pre ordering games. We’re not supposed to do it
---
Have you looked into Xamarin for cross platform apps?
---
like I said, ill take my chances and gamble away 6-8 bucks lmao
---
I mean If you really want to I can put up all consumables that can be used for aoe tanking and we in the end will multiply that with 1.495 vs paladins nothing and you'll see how well it adds up.
---
And you keep forgetting that paladin doesnt have 100% block chance tho, which warrior has reliably for 2 blocks every 6 second so the engineering shield is usually not as effective and neither is BoSanc. so at average they will block alot more especially with tier gear since paladins doesnt have anything like it.
---
Blessing are 15 mins :)
---
If it's anything like retail, that'll be how it works, yeah. Don't see any reason why it wouldn't be like retail either.
---
Source: I'm paranoid about my neat and rare names that I store on my alt account and I do this whole ritual every time I roll an alt.

TLDR: didn’t listen, will keep lying and giving others at shit experience at 60

---
It's rude and please don't get me started on how bad localized content sounds.
---
could be. I just couldn't say, I know very little about hunters.

It's fine.
---
Defenitely take your time with your newborn too! I'm sure you will it is the greatest Thing in the world! You might not even be too interested in playing while your child is awake :P
---
In case you are you are quite lucky. Newborns are easy to handle in comparison to when they learn to move around and try to eat and grab everything they can reach ;)
---
Have him Close to you and you should be fine. Of course you will have quite a lot of distractions so make sure you are just questing and not tanking a dungeon while you are looking after your child. 
---
Bind auto-run to Mouse 3 or 4. That should make your life easier when playing one handed :P And get used to clicking unless you get the above mentioned 12 button mouse ;)
---
Provided that all of the guilds are under some "oath" to remain to this policy- It sounds awesome. I look forward to rolling on your server!
---
&gt; Your Layer will only have a couple hundred players in it
---
According to what? I got the impression that layers are at least server sized, so like 3-4k.
---
Upvote for Alizee dance
---
I dislike that. either you are hitting the focus target, in which case you are already way too late, or you are hitting something no one has targeted, which is a recipe for constantly being on discord which would get tiresome fast, or you would end up putting 4 sunders on half the mobs and 5 on the other half.
---
End of the day, it does not take long to stack 5 sunders if you have the rage. 7.5 seconds, to be exact.
---
A properly executed 2h furry slam rotation will out perform a hamstring spam horde 2h fury. Fishing for windfury isn't as good as you'd expect it.
---
I mostly played 2h-Frost during Cataclysm, which I also quite enjoyed; just not as much as what Demolock would later become. As far as dungeons go, I'd wholeheartedly agree, though, but my view of raids is very much biased in favor of the MoP era, so I'll not judge.
---
slam spec is great on horde, there's some drop off in late phases of raids but once you get that Might of Menethil, who's going to fuck with you?
---
Guess I'll have to go with TheRealThexTTV then.
---
I am a part of the «WoW Classic Norge» discord, and we have about 20 Norwegian guilds who are gonna plan to start on the same server.
---
most of these exploits get fixed pretty fast, for example, you mentioned the exploit that traded gold to other characters, made famous by a weakaura people imported.
---
this was patched by making the send mail and trade accept functions protected meaning they require "user input" in the form of some button click in order to actually succeed.
---
the damage caused by these addons are usually pretty minimal and in most cases gm's will return any scammed items/gold.
---
That's what spell interrupts do now
---
Multiboxing should be banned
---
Hi, /u/icylike
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ck5lmy/biggest_difference_between_vanilla_and_wow_classic/). 
---
I honestly don’t want them to. The servers gonna be a mess probably the first week. They can advertise once we’re settled in. A lot of people are coming back. I’ve had friends I played with years ago randomly hit me up saying they’re coming back and some haven’t touched retail in a decade.
---
I think people on retail do more dps on average compared to the best than they will do on vanilla especially for certain classes.
---
Can you please have a noob explanation about '5 character multi boxing'?
---
XxThexXx most likely
---
It won‘t be. No worry
---
you forgot your e
---
Here is example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjHw2yV_JC0&amp;t=2244s
---
While I agree, It won't be banned. This is easy money for blizzard.
---
According to the Beta and the Stress Tests and common sense.
---
I don't expect it to be particularly good, I've just seen a lot of other people talking about how slam isn't actually better. And I haven't seen anyone argue much against that. 
---
This is another reason I would really like proper sim tools to be developed for classic.
---
I'm pretty sure you can't enchant white items...
---
!remind me 13 days
---
He was bad, good multibox config don't have this problem, you just can swap main character while one cced.
---
Supposedly, they will announce server lost before August 17th. Then on that day you will log into classic Launcher if you're subbed and pick a server and able to create up to 3 characters per account thus reserving those names until official launch date of August 27th
---
Nightfall should be used by offtanks. In rare fringe cases enhancement shamans and retribution paladins (but most guilds wont allow those in raids for obvious reasons). Fury warriors should be helping to keep annihilator up but with the lower armor values confirmed for classic bosses you'll only need like 1-2 stacks up of annihilator.
---
there is a shorter way over the mountain
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5sjX0tdHHY
---
Well, I am very well aware of the fact that an orc with an axe or a troll without anything is theoretically superior. 
---
I am not going for world firsts; If I wanted that I would go alliance because alliance racials are much better than horde racials when it comes to PVE. 
---
I'm not even going for realm first because that will be done by a ps guild, no matter where I will roll. 
---
I' ll have max of 40 hours / week for Classic. However, I am a skilled MMORPG player, I ran a realm faction first guild in retail a few expansions ago while playing a tank. 
---
If I won't find a good guild with skilled and socially competent players that is willing to have me as a MT, I'm going to make my own guild.
---
So, one way or the other, I'll have my Corrupted Ashbringer; Even if it means that I'll have to work 3 years to get it and school 300 newbs in the meantime. :)
---
Good to know. I’m readyyyyyy
---
Thanks for the video, although I like to do the actual Wetlands run in order to get the Thelsamar flight point and also grab the quest, to bring stuff from Loch Modan to SW.
---
Painted face, master race!
---
Having raided (on private servers) as orc warrior I can confirm that MoM as 2h-fury slamspec does **not** outperform dualwield in Naxx-bis gear. MoM is amazing for fights that involve alot of cleave/ww though, then its top-dog.
---
Easy money, lol. It's just nooblike
---
Gnome Frost Mage:
---
Icecube
---
&lt;Straight Outta Combat&gt;
---
It shouldn't drain mana in forms (except travel form) and it didn't during beta.
---
Far away from my server because we will hunt you down and CC the extras or kill and corpsecamp the main
---
I would love to play there. Also looking for a swedish guild to join in Classic (Horde) since i am studying swedish. So if anyone is willing to take me in :) dutch myself and also speak fluent english.
---
Baby sure, but SO? This is debatable.
---
Blizzard should be able to get rid of the spam if they put any proper investment into trying.
---
A list of regexes should pick up most gold selling messages, and since gold selling messages follow a relatively simple structure, a machine learning algorithm trained to find them should be able to flag the rest.
---
The system should auto suspend any account that sends more than 10 obvious gold selling messages, and flag for review any account that sends less than 10 or messages that cannot confidently be classified as gold selling.
---
Would be funny if there was hair growth simulation but no way to cut it. Launch mains would have super long hair and beards by phase 6.
---
Best of luck mate and hope you and the lads have a great time!!
---
I love to travel from Darnassus to Stormwind and get some fly paths, like the one found in Loch Modan, but thanks for the video. I may do the back track from IF to Wetlands when I need to go with my Human.
---
I fucking hate Multi-boxers. They ruin the game when they are near you.
---
It's a selfish way to play games. Don't care if that gets me downvoted. Multi-boxers can get fucked.
---
You can easily see, that paladin was the worst designed class. They completely revamped the class between the last beta patch and the release patch. So, bascially nobody ever tested paladins before release.
---
I'm out of the loop. Can someone explain Thex?
---
haha, i considered multiboxing before but if it triggers people this bad i pretty much have to do it
---
I ended up being a streamer :( 
---
All I wanted was to fuck over Asmons raid.
---
We just want to avoid the "BIGGUNS" as you put it, streaming in general is fine. 
---
Yes we want to avoid having guilds like Apes on the server.

At 8 weeks shouldn't they be making you take it? My gf took 5 weeks recently because her leave balance was getting too high. 
---
Also I'm guessing you work in the US?
---
In my country the employer must provide a valid business reason for denying personal leave, which is usually only if multiple people from the same team overlap with their leave. Otherwise the law says they have to allow it. I've yet to be denied a leave request in several years of full time work now.
---
Alphaqup
---
You could say, things have improved from that. If you have same class 5-man team, killing the main means absolutely nothing. Just one click and you are leading from any of the 4 other accounts. It is that easy. If you have like a TANK, healer + 3 dps, then killing the tank obviously can make it harder. Not to control the team, but your dps'es are going to face tank everything (with 4 man team, not really a problem either, unless you are clearing elites).
---
Getting the team back together isnt really a problem either, unless your dont notice it at first and move out of range. Bit of backtracking, press a button and you are fine.
---
Obviously you could harass the team, but basically the same way as you can harass any player on a rogue.
---
Yep, similar situation in Australia and New Zealand.
---
Thanks bud.

GIMME A X

I’m getting 60 in the first week, smashing dungeons for prebis and then getting a hunter to 35 for extra profs :)
---
Lol you are probably right I guess.  I did level a warrior to 60 in vanilla though and last year I was into a private EQ server launch enough to get a char to max level and kill Naggy in a couple of weeks so I guess I will see.  My main problem is most games just don't hold my attention very long, hopefully WoW classic is different.
---
All my thoughts probably need to be prefaced by the fact that I find stockades supremely fucking boring to run. If I were to do an alliance group like this I'd push hard to get them to do DM -&gt; WC -&gt; BFD -&gt; one (1) run of stocks, that ring is too good to pass up -&gt; Gnomer or RFK to taste -&gt; SM spam.
---
It's a pretty massive assumption that anyone who is into gaming is watching twitch. Not only that but there was not even a separate channel for classic at the time of the deadmines, meaning for someone out of the loop it wouldn't even be distinct on the browse tab even if you were on twitch. It's only an anecdote but on top of this I have spoken to two former players who had absolutely no idea of anything classic related.
---
This is before we even mention the fact there's a massive market out there for people that have never played an MMO before, young people especially. Classic is a fresh start, far less daunting than jumping into a 12 year old perpetual world.
---
All of this isn't to say twitch isn't advertising. It is, but it's advertising to a specific demographic and it was also done ineffectively because it wasn't distinct from retail wow. Not to mention, beta ended how long ago now? Even if twitch was the most effective marketing campaign of all time (which it's not) it doesn't make sense to just go completely advert silent for up to two months prior to launch.

Phase 5 - Ahn'Qiraj
---
Phase 6 - Naxxramas
---
In reply to your other question, I think you will drink a lot less than with cleave, if at all, because you are doing more dps, the dps is going onto fewer targets at once, and stuff should just be glued to the healer. I expect you to take less damage, so the only mana problem would be just killing stuff so fast the priest can't last hit it. 
---
I am not recommending this because the TTK is longer. I am recommending this because it should kill stuff faster AND focus down mobs one at a time as a nice bonus.
---
Some guy actually posted a thread about what characters we were making, saying he was gonna play a shaman called Thex. And with the whole nature of the name reservation thing, people started threatening to get everyone they know to reserve the name Thex on every server, which has now snowballed into a meme, everyone will now be playing a shaman called Thex.
---
Not break up with my GF
---
It's cheating and you can't just say "but it's how they want to play the game." Why isn't botting allowed? Why do people get banned for abusing exploits in raids? Sure it may not technically be against the rules but if your only argument for something being ethical is that it's legal you're making a shitty argument. 
---
Even if they're not engaging in PvP they're affecting other people's gameplay experience through unintended and exploitative means. Only reason Blizzard doesn't crack down on it is that they end up paying 5 times the amount of a normal player.
---
This is still fire, it also introduced me to Nami Amuro!
---
Im huge piece of shit because I want to play the game as I want? Multiboxing is allowed by wow-law so Im not doing anything wrong, why swear at me in the first place?
---
I had two characters in vanilla with a ú in their name. Don't know where you get this misinformation from...
---
I think too many non Druid players don’t realize that shifting in and out of Cat Form is undoable for mana reasons. Untalented, casting Cat Form uses 15-20% of your mana, and if you’re a geared feral (unless you’re in R12-13 PvP gear), you have close to no intellect on your gear, making it even tougher. Only Travel/Aquatic Forms have a cheap mana cost. Hence why Blizzard created the Rune of Metamorphosis item, and it’s indeed very useful in PvP.
---
Feral vs Frost mage is a very bad matchup, unless you have the PvP set bonus (+15% outdoor speed) which allows you to ignore slows entirely (but even then you’re vulnerable to Frost Nova), and even then it’s not specially easy due to lack of survivability in Cat Form.
---
The only thing that does well against Frost mages is a balance/resto hybrid who can use DoTs and then kite while ignoring slows/roots/polymorphism with Travel Form, assuming he’s fighting OUTDOORS. Indoors you can’t even kite and you’re forced to use Cat/Bear Form to remove slows/roots which will make you go OOM in a moment’s notice.
---
trust me, multiboxing is harder than clicking one button, try it yourself its pretty fun
---
Actually feel bad for the guy...
---
Still, I don’t have a name for my shaman alt yet so thex is looking pretty good!

True, there is ALOT of cleaving in MC.
---
I like that path for gear, but I think BFD would be a nightmare to speedrun. Too much swimming. 
---
I feel like you just have to skip it as a 3 warrior group, as swimming 3 miles for a 20% chance of ONE strike of the hydra is not a good idea. Better just to get it over with quickly and be right in town to train skills and fly to ironforge after.
---
Try [https://sixtyupgrades.com](https://sixtyupgrades.com). You can create custom values for each stat and see a list of gear for each slot, ordered by score. Much better than a BiS list.
---
For my PVP Shadow Priest I use the following custom values;
---
Spell Damage = 10pts  
---
Stamina = 10pts  
---
Shadow Damage = 9pts  
---
Crit = 3pt  
---
Int = 1pt
---
I'd imagine the values would be similar for a warlock. When you click on an item slot you can also change the filter to include random green/blue items (sometimes BiS for phase1 PVP).

It's not nothing, it's just one. For undead mobs, you could even use holy water, where the paladin has the bigger modifier. The point is, all you have is a 50% modifier to the threat you generate with consumables. But paladin abilities will provide roughly 100 tps more than your innate abilities. If you can make that up with the bonus threat created by consumables, that also means paladins generate at least 200 tps with the consumables as well, so should reach the 350 tps mark quite easily.
---
Paladins get 30% block chance for several seconds when crit, if you go with a holy shield build, you also have 4 more blocks every 10 seconds with +30% block chance, that would put block chance at around 80-90% (and I'd say, if you are going to use the engi shield, holy shield makes more sense than imp ret aura). The warrior can block a little better, because they have ~10% higher block chance from talents and gear and don't need to be crit, but it's not massive.
---
Where's the horde one at?
---
Im sorry, but no I won't be doing ally one, because im only doing this one time for fun, but I believe you can just go Elwyn -&gt; Dwarf Area -&gt; Wetlands -&gt; Dun Morogh -&gt; Back to wetlands
---
But 12 lvl is too low for deadmines I think you need at least 15 right? That would mean you need to go and do one more zone probably the 2nd zone of NE.
---
Do only Kill/Deliver quests, dont do gather quests because gathering as 5 chars you would need 5x as many mobs and that would take enormous amount of time.
---
Exploring also gives you exp. But once u do the zones I mentioned I believe u are readyd to hit deadmines and grind dungs from there =) GL!

"Some guy actually posted a thread about what characters we were making, saying he was gonna play a shaman called Thex. And with the whole nature of the name reservation thing, people started threatening to get everyone they know to reserve the name Thex on every server, which has now snowballed into a meme, everyone will now be playing a shaman called Thex."

Great comment :) Of course made by a rogue.

Most of those GM's are slready in the discord. I've talked a lot to the GM of URO which seems to be the one that has a lot of saying in the norweighan server choice. Last info from him today was that you want to dodge this initiative since you think it's too much private server people. The problem is, it's not. We want to dodge the private server tryhards just as much as you want...
---
Actually, no, they aren't baseless.
---
7+million players at Classic launch are very good estimates, based on a minuscule percentage (5%) of returning WoW players from 2004-2015 (over 100 million), a good number of BfA players at launch (it can be easily 1 million trying it, at launch) and an unknown number of old school MMORPG players, which, contrary to popular opinion, are still gamers, they aren't dead, they just don't have an old MMORPG to play. Now they have.
---
There can also easily be 1 million+ new players from outside WoW sphere that could try Classic, at launch.
---
I personally expect 6+ million at launch, but I do not exclude up to10 million, if the percentage of returning players from 2004-2015 is above 5% (which might easily be), if the BfA players trying it at launch is much bigger, or, why not, if the players from outside WoW sphere are trying Classic at launch in much higher numbers.
---
How many will stay in Classic after launch nobody knows, and it's not the issue here. The issue is launch numbers, and I expect a minimum of 6 million players, based on numbers that are realistically, very probable.
---
Okay so TL;DR you don't have "time" to play the game properly so you are paying money to get an advantage in leveling over other players?
---
Yup this is why people don't like multiboxers.
---
Since Classic will have a global launch like Battle for Azeroth had, this window will start at the same time for all players, regardless of where you live. Below you can see the local time the character creation window will start depending on your location, but August 12th or August 13th instead of August 26th/27th respectively.

Care to elaborate?
---
r/healthluts
---
Yes this is true. But only for raiding.
---
Druids are healers but they CAN play feral if optimized properly.
---
Shamans are healers. No exceptions
---
Paladins are healers. No exceptions.
---
Priests are healers, but they can also play shadow. It's not optimal but it's close, however you only want 1 shadow per raid.
---
But again, this is only for raiding. All other aspects of the game can be done just fine in whatever spec you want to play.
---
NO CHANGES
---
do u have link for ally fedex route?
---
I feel like you could pretty easily skip the underwater bosses. The mobs are actually quite nicely clustered if you do it that way, and you should be able to camp out to reset it after a full run.
---
There are only 3 mandatory swims in BFD, the one right after entrance of the instance that leads to the jump, and the two immediately before and after the turtle boss.
---
I do get that it's not optimal, but I'm hoping it's not that bad cause if I have to spam Stocks I'll blow my brains out.
---
&gt; Also it hits shaman very hard. A dodge means no flurry proc, no windfury proc, no dmg until the next AA, which is 3-3.8 sec away. A warrior or rogue attacks much faster, so a single dodge isn't as impactful.
---
Sure, but the warrior attack a lot more, so he will miss more white attack. 6% dodge means 6% less attacks. On a very slow weapons, this just means there will have more variance on fights
---
&gt; Classic will be met by several hundreds of thousands of hyped players at launch. 
---
Some people are delusional. Like you. Several hundreds of thousands?
---
You have no idea what you are talking about.
---
Can't believe this aged so well, had forgotten about it. Thanks!
---
When I hit 60 on my mage I didn't even know /played existed. :)
---
I'm just going off my experiences In pservers. I was dw fury in vanilla and enjoyed it but it was not quite the same as it is in pservers. In wow vanilla fury warriors as a whole were rare so we don't have a lot of examples to use. They started being popular after a guy used tf to get insane dps on neffarian and mainly from the adds with cleave then it sorta spiraled from there but never become too mainstream. There was a ton of theory crafting but it was mainly on 1hers and people had examples of how they out performed all other dps but in vanilla threat felt different. When I was a dw fury warrior in bwl and aq I often pulled threat when meters said I was well below so I think the whole 1h fury is the best is a bit nonsense since threat is classic is not like  pservers. The biggest indicator of this was on vaelstraz where in execute phase I'd pull threat so fast while being well under the treat of the 5 maintank/off tanks we had.
---
Sad... I thought I would be able to switch easily before fighting :(

I just did some quick testing to see how long you can keep casting in HotW spec vs Moonglow spec - it's pretty much the same - so the 20% int seems to have a similar impact as the extra mana cost reduction.   
---
So the difference is gonna be the increased speed after crits (which is low at lower gear levels) and the 10% base healing, which is also negligible when considering you're mainly casting rank 4 HT - where most of the healing is coming from your +heal.   
---
Both specs will work well for both. HotW might have the edge in PVP - and Moonglow the edge in raiding.
---
Watch him being 3000IQ as he reserves a different name he actually intended to while everyone is trying to take his fake one.
---
Probbaly some racist bullshit. Ignore him.
---
I like Druid a whole lot; but my biggest concern is the 'progression' of my character. Will I feel like im getting stronger over time etc. When it comes to feral I know that lots of the BiS stuff is weird World drops and dungeon stuff. But what about in terms of PvP and so on? 
---
Kinda tempted to go something more boring like a Mage or Warrior so I can feel closer to my character's progression you know?
---
No wonder, since the player base was lower and lower, while the hardware was the same, and software improved.
---
When you have hardware for 15 million players, but only 10 are at launch (Cata and MoP), or lower, and software (especially sharding) that can spread the load on hudreds of instances, ofc you will have a smooth launch.
---
But with Classic is very different. We don't even KNOW if they deployed enough hardware to deal with a potentially VERY WRONG estimate of player numbers. Sharding can spread 5,000 people in 100 instances. Layering can only spread it in TWO instances.
---
A fuckton can go wrong if Blizzard is underestimating the numbers. If they are correct, everything will be fine.
---
All I see is a horse. Boring picture.
---
TTVThex!
---
But isn't the deathrun through wetlands an essential low level expirience at least for all nightelf chars in classic?  
---
Honestly racing those cros is part of the story xD  
---
On a sidenote: You might be able to skip alot of the inital swim by taking a boat and jumping off at the right spot :)
---
" we intend to use a Loot Council "
---
kkthxbye
---
Pvp-wise, there isn’t a better racial imo, ultra relevant against rogues or really any class but we all know how dependent rogues are on stuns and the sheer abundance of them.  Pve-wise can save your group from a wipe when things aren’t going well and a stun drops.
---
My boss denied my holiday request on the week of release, but instead I got the week after. I am satisfied with that.
---
Can't you book some time off in October instead? It will take a while to get to Level 60 anyway, whether you use some holiday to plow through 1-40 right at the start, or 40-60 a bit later on, it's pretty much the same thing right?
---
Whatever you do, don't quit your job for it. I mean if you do, do it for a genuine reason, not for WoW. That's the start of a long slippery slope.
---
For me that 10% rep gain is worth more than that spirit.
---
I don't see why you're surprised. Retail WoW has been a shadow of its former self for a few expansion packs already. I've only resubbed once a few months ago because I wanted to check my account (It was banned a few years ago when I got hacked) and maybe farm gold to buy tokens for Classic. But when I saw what the game and my characters had become I just couldn't do it. I think I prefer to pay a subscription rather than having to play retail WoW, which blows my mind because back then WoW was my life.
---
I have a list of 8 names. No way I am going to say which they are.
---
Yep! Me and my wife are hosting a LAN party the weekend after launch. 
---
Made space to setup our PCs already. Actually bought an extra desk for the occasion. 
---
It'll be three friends, my wife and I. Thu-Sun, we all took time off from work. Beer in the fridge, snacks in cupboard, pizza-hotline on speed dial and babysitter arranged.
---
CAN NOT WAIT..... It's going to be LEGEN....wait for it....
---
Joking right? There has been players who've got glad as a multibox, blizzard doesn't care rofl
---
No one knows that there's people who haven't played MMOs before especially young people? What? That's not an assumption it's a fact.
---
If you're going to be pedantic and pretend you didn't say any gamers already know about it because of twitch just because you had the word "serious" in there, then we are already done with this conversation because you're not willing to have it on an intellectually honest basis.

---
Same if it takes me 5 years to finnish Naxx i am good with that i do not want a changing game.
---
Well, people Had to relevel a Lot because their Servers got Shut down after some time. 
---
But private Servers do experience a Steep long-term player dropoff after BWL, aq, naxx etc. 
---
Only because there are some people playing the Game that doesnt mean it shouldnt get any Updates..
---
For those who play shaman or hunter, please sell me on your class and why you play it.
---
Personally my debate between these two falls down to that I think I might have more fun on a shaman, but would find it a harder process to get to the fun parts due to the big competition for gear in raids and the respec costs from healing in PvE and going ele in PvP.
---
The hunter I know is a safe pick because it'll just be a fun, more chill experience but it might not hit the heights of shaman fun, though it'll be much easier to get geared to a good level.
---
In 99% sure the spam will be taken care of by the new client. 
---
But stopping people from just using Google is another issue.
---
In Vanilla my MC+BWL geared rogue was doing 400dps. Looking at how classes performed in Naxx that would be increased to 700-800dps if I'd ever reached it. However, spriests rets and ferals in Naxx are still stuck around 300-400dps. 
---
It's not propaganda, these raids have been ran thousands of times and hybrid DPS is just horrible when compared to pure DPS classes.
---
I was thinking of priest. Kinda want to go troll, but undead is decent too. Probably leveling as shadow, but can always go heal at higher level
---
And people say Blizzard didn't put any money into advertising. It's everywhere!
---
i am waiting there &gt;:)
---
Where and when can you reserve your name ?
---
I have a 2 year old. My wife and I are both gamers, and when we are just chilling at home we basically take turns playing games and playing with the toddler, so we both get a few hours of undisturbed gameplay each day. Also, kids sleep a lot.

Nice try legion baby!

If people think their time is that precious they cry about pvp, you shouldn't pick a pvp server whether its a multiboxer or a dude ganking redridge for hours. No one cares about you or your time and nor should they.

Oh and you cannot BG as a multiboxer because blizzard broke follow as soon as you hit pvp combat.

This sounds like it could be absolutely fantastic or about the most toxic environment imaginable. Either way I'm down to try it.

My planes changed. a couple of weeks before I got a stable chilled job with much free time. My girl is in norway for 6 months because of university. My plans were to play the shit out of classic during the winter. Now I suddenly got the job I always wanted and I have to move to another city 3 days after classic launches. I will see what happens and not force myself into anything this time around.
---
&gt;I would only trust curse
---
Afaik curse's credibilitY took a big Hit Back in the day because they infested PCs with a keylogger.
---
People drop off all the time obviously, but the main dropoff is after AQ, because people avoid Naxxramas as it fucks over PvP. This also makes it an ideal time to launch a competing private server. Then even the people that like Naxxramas jump ship because they don't want to be late to the next private server.
---
Not necessarily if you do darkshore &amp; westfall you can skip loch modan.
---
15-20hr a week.
---
Hit rank 10 in PvP.
---
Clear all BWL and make it further in AQ40 (Huhuran) and Naxx (4 bosses) than I did back in vanilla.

same same but diffrent. Probably gonna roll a priest. But i can't keep myself away from da Voodoo!

Worried? No changes!

I request your assistance . I’m still torn between mage and hunter.

---
Hello!
---
Think I've decided on a class but not sure what professions - I've spent a few hours reading through various threads on this subreddit and I haven't really found a solution for myself.
---
Some context:
---
- I'm rolling a warlock.
---
- I plan on playing casually - not rushing to 60, taking my time, absorbing the world, just like I did when I first played vanilla.
---
- I plan on levelling first aid / fishing / cooking / 2 other professions on my to 60, hopefully at a pace where I'm close to maxing these professions when I ding 60.
---
- I plan on raiding somewhat, but it will likely be casual - likely doing more 5 mans for a while until I can tag along as a random pug for guilds who need it.
---
My problem - I can't decide what professions to take. I'm not going dual gathering, as I'm not rushing the game nor am I looking to be super rich. I also hate the idea of having to powerlevel 2 crafting professions after I've hit 60.
---
I'm open to the idea of one crafting / one gathering profession, dumping the gathering once I hit 60.
---
Initial thought is to go Tailoring / Skinning:
---
- From what I've read, and what I remember, skinning will net me some good side cash. But some people seem to think skinning isn't actually worth it and you don't make much gold at all, which is throwing me off.
---
- Tailoring is something I'm keen on for the epic robe at 60, and the Bloodvine set from ZG (I know I'm casual, but this is one of my goals). I mentioned I don't want to powerful a crafting profession, therefore levelling tailoring on my to 60 seems like a good call.
---
- Furthermore, I can craft bags, maybe sell some of these, and craft the odd bit of levelling gear here and there for that extra bit of oomph.
---
Once getting to 60, I could dump skinning, and take up another profession, but I'm not sure what:
---
- Enchanting - seems like a big gold sink from what I've read to level (I never levelled it), and since I'm a casual, I won't ever get the super rare recipe's that make this profitable in any way. Is there any point in taking this? Would it be easier / cheaper to just buy enchants as/when I need them?
---
- Alchemy - not sure here, since I won't have amassed any herbs during my levelling. Could end up being just as expensive to level as Enchanting - coupled with the fact that this may also not be beneficial for money making at all since I'm a casual with no access to flask recipe's etc.
---
- Engineering - not really drawn to this as I won't PvP much.
---
I haven't factored herbalism / mining / blacksmithing into any of the above, but maybe I should - I just don't know. I could pick Herb up after dumping skinning perhaps and start selling herbs, or take herbalism from the get go. No real need for mining as I won't be levelling engineering, and no blacksmithing for obvious reasons.
---
I've read through many threads, and sifted through many contradictory opinions on what is best to take / what is not worth taking, what will / will not make money, etc.
---
Any guidance from you helpful folk bearing in mind the above would be greatly appreciated!
---
U dont understand why there has to be this builder/spender mechanic for all classes. I dont like it. There can be engaging rotations even without that
---
Chuck a few sickies mate
---
People have played with the same meta on pservers for years and never get bored. We good.

I only had my old (inactive) EU Vanilla wow account associated with it and had no way to install the Classic client. After I went into my Bnet account and added a NA wow starter account the drop downs appeared and I could install it.
---
What do you mean with streamer server or "bad stuff"?
---
I wasn't even going to sub to reserve my names as they are too obscure. But, then I thought of creating a Shaman named Thex and it will be worth the extra sub price!
---
It's 2019. Gaming marketing is done for free via reddit and Twitch. Only AAA EA titles aimed at 14 years old require marketing, mostly so mothers know what to buy for Christmas
---
I can’t confirm character names but the guild I was in during vanilla had Đ in the name.
---
What do you do that lets you leave for an hour?  My old job required by law 24 hour coverage and the new factory job will no t allow it.
---
well, taking your vacations during the busiest times is the best time to take them, I prefer to avoid a busy day than a slow day.
---
I'm talking about the number of people interested in Classic, not the existence of them. You claim there's a massive market for people who have never played MMO. I don't know that and I doubt there's much data about it but it seems like MOBA and fps are the most popular online games at the moment plus there's auto chess on the rise. If you're happy playing these games, trying a remaster (or whatever is the proper term) of a 15 old MMO doesn't sound very appealing considering there are modern MMO's to pick from as well.
---
I didn't understand your second paragraph, no comment here.
---
You skipped it and it was a very important detail in my post.
---

Got two kids. When kids are asleep we are free to do whatever. Im planning to do one evening a week (fridays) without games, to be with the misses.
---
Otherwise Im looking at 3-4hr per evening in best case scenario.
---
Also Im currently studying, so it depends how much I got to do. But its just for 3 more months, then I will start working (software development).
---
You don't, just have dps warriors slap on shields

You boss is taking time off to play WoW at launch.
---
Cute, a lil Gnomey
---
Tyvm
---
Why would you mention it at all?
---
I’ll go for tailoring/skinning. Skimming for money making. Vendor anything before thick leather and tailoring you can just skill along the way. It’s probably one of the easiest profs. You will get so much cloth especially as alliances as you kill more humanoids.
---
Now this is war crimes!
---
Well if your a tailor getting your upgrades as you level will be easy.
---
&gt; Worst part of it is that I don't really see any way to solve this issue. 
---
You could, example, play another game. Take a break if you are set until next phase. Seriously, if you think this is a problem, i would suggest not even starting to play. After the hype is over, you are going to be that guy complaining in the forums for changes.
---
You know, how we got to current retail ? 
---
:)
---
This is a great run because you gather flight paths for future use and saving you time when higher lvl
---
Save up all cloth (except for first aid) while leveling. Level tailoring then get archmage chest and abandon tailoring. Then level whatever gathering profession best fitting your gold farming spot. Mining, herbalism and skinning are the options. You can also level these while leveling if you know in advance which one you want to use.
---
And ofc level engineering afterwards. 
---
Once ZG comes out you swap out your gathering profession for tailoring again and start farming gold from AoE'ing ZG crocodiles.
---
There you go the absolute best in slot profession solution for mages.
---
Usso taunttaa

madseason is first person ever i have became a patreon to.. the man is a gem
---
Aren't all youtube videos stretched to over 10:00 now for the ad money? But yeah, quickly skimming the video and after 2 minutes he is still talking about utterly basic stuff like that you need a mining pick and you can track minerals. And ofc it has the obligatory +1min outro.
---
But the "honest" youtubers that make a 2 minute video about a 2 minute topic, they get fucked by the algorithms that favour +10mins videos. Try googling "How to get Thunderfury". You will get videos that are 2mins, and they have all the information you need, but they have hardly any views. And then there are some +10mins videos that are literally 90% fluff, but they have tonnes of views.
---
Met a great paladin yesterday named Holytits. Might steal that one
---
The good posts never get they love they deserve.
---
Yeye ofc but the cordination and decision making will be done between the nordic guild leaders
---
/castsequence insert1 [reset = length of the shortest trinket] trink2,3 4
---
Is just an option
---
Almost nobody is going to do that in phase 1. Just because onyxia resets much faster, you will have 2 days / week minimum. Even if you clear MC in sub 1h, you will want to go do onyxias few days later.
---
Commenting for follow as I'm Swedish, seems interesting. Wouldn't mind if a couple of Dutch or Belgian people choose the same server, they're usually cool people.
---
I, for one , am ready for the new game experience of classic wow!
---
since you can easily use at least 8 in a raid, that doesn't have to be a problem :o
---
Can someone explain me this Thex joke?
---
Brother. You should be getting out of the house and out and about as often as you can, as early as you can. It’s great for you, the Mum, and the baby. Don’t cool yourself up in the house and never get out, you could run into all sorts of problems (re mental health and post natal depression) 
---
That being said, newborns basically eat, sleep, poo, repeat. For at least the first 2-3 months. You’ll get plenty of time to get a few sessions in - and make sure you do - it’s important to take time for yourself. 
---
Get a white noise machine for when the babies asleep - they’re fucking awesome 👌🏻
---
smegma alliance
---
Wow just imagine a server full of Swedes. Just one whiteknight and SJW guild after the other... Even the Germans have better humour..
---
Yeah I mean at that point when you have Naxx on farm people start using all sorts of wierd gear combos just to test out wierd and unconventional shit for the fun of it.
---
BOJWOLB
---
Yeah the fix in tbc was so the Warriors wouldnt have the same scaling curve to eventually become rage capped due to their scaling was the same as it was in vanilla. Imagine a level 60 warrior with t4 gear in vanilla and tbc weapons. they would generate like 50 rage per auto crit
---
I want to do PvE (on PvP realm) and I assume Alliance would be better since paladins.
---
But 1/ shamheal a powerfull still 2/ very few paladins 3/ More Horde people.
---
This does not reflect what will be the 60 community of course, more people will go paladins, but how many will go 60 ? How many will keep main at paladin with "broken" (or not yet finished) ret and tank specs ?
---
I am wondering if Horde wouldnt be a better choice. I played on both side (reveling a character all the time before 40 in Vanilla... a kid...).
---
What are your thought on that ?
---
Pservers have been using the pre 1.12 version of BRE(which gives a small armor debuff on the target, actually very useful for raiding as it stacks with everything) and 2hand fury was still good on it. You don't need BRE to make it work.
---
Tell that to all those horde in Redridge. There's ALWAYS a horde in there
---
I was thinking of going with like Xeht or some shit.
---
I would if I had any friends at all.
---
I work in the IT, I maintain virtual infrastructures and help users on second level. Basically we are a team of three so if one is missing that's not a big deal - it becomes one when there are emergencies.
---
&gt; Some new players don't seem to be able to look up where to get quests on Google etc.
---
One could google the information individually, but it's nice to have it condensed into a single video
---
Hey man just a quick heads up, jumping off the zepplin takes you to brill. I tested this jumping in roughly 20 different spots and I even tried drowning myself. I know on pservers it takes you to the starting zone but that was not the case on the beta. 
---
I could find no way to be sent to deathknell before walking through the gates.
---
I meant I was looking forward to when this ends after stage 6 has been out for a longer time.
---
I like his view in this.
---
If its a person farming gold and sells it later for dollars, it shouldnt be a problem. But if somekind of automated bot does the farming, istant ban.
---
Indeed they are!
---
Hey guys just a quick PSA to anyone testing exploration routes that include death skips. 
---
Death skips on pservers compared to what I personally tested on beta servers can be COMPLETELY DIFFERENT, DO NOT TRUST PRIVATE SERVER DATA.
---
I was in the process of making guides from all horde starter zones to each other. I had each part pretty much down to about 10ish mins. Then i got access to the open beta for two days.
---
Every second death skip sent me somewhere different and it ruins half the paths. For example jumping off the zepplin takes you to brill not deathknell. 
---
I hadn't got around to doing exploration leveling but it was next on the list, if people are super interested I can see if I still have the recordings but to be completely honest I rage deleted my spreadsheet when I realised just how fucked it was lmao.
---
Who said anything about gold farmers? 
---
Anyways, you’d probably need at least 20-30 people in order to camp me aka have fun with that!
---
I almost definitely won’t gank people while multiboxing anyways, but I sure will enjoy defending myself.
---
Few months for the devilsaur maffia
---
Warlock/rogue, both can solo pvp and always wanted for pve groups.
---
My cat is going to be named Anu, so naturally I have to call myself Anu's Master.
---
You’re gonna pay for 40 accounts just for the fun of it 🙄
---
I don't follow. You spend 5 GCDs killing the target, use the first on sunder.
---
Yeah but a huge chunk of the original vanilla player base didn't even make it to 60 or end game content... I didn't before TBC came out so I skipped almost all of the end game vanilla content.
---
A undead rogue called Sly.
---
Oh ok, I'm starting to see that name everywhere now xD
---
Because there is no bis pre-raid for pvp.
---
What are those values exactly? 9 points and 10 points and whatnot..
---
Would you explain a little so I'll understand it better? This tool looks really amazing.
---
Hunters dont need to respec ever. 20/31/0 or 1/31/19 both great for pvp and pve. Alot more chill too.
---
Yes mam
---
Actually now that I think about it I didn't test jumping off the zepplin as it was leaving the undead zone, I'm not sure where it paths on the way out but there might be a way there.
---
I was known as Imbadin between 2004-2009
---
Warriors rogues and Hunters were even stronger pre-1.12. Things are actually pretty balanced in 1.12 and that’s why they’re using it.
---
I'll plan to play extremly casual for a year. For example: I log on 2 hours, invite random people and do some quests. Maybe a dungeon or two at friday night. 
---
In the long run I want to be able to do bg's and even pugs.
---
My main options are:
---
* **Mage**: I feel that it will be very boring at raids but pvp and leveling sounds fun with it.
---
* **Warrior**: Gear dependent and very slow leveling. This would be my top1 fantasy choise but I don't want to make my experience extremely for myself.
---
* **Shaman**: I never healed in my entire life and again, it seems a boring role in raiding, otherwise the fantasy appeals a lot to me.
---
* **Warlock**: They look very fun in all scenarios but probably mage is more casual friendly
---
Can you help me decide or at least get classes out of the decission range?
---
Your posts show otherwise. Just admit you’re a gold farmer and be done with it. Either way I’ll easily get 30 people to honorfarm on people like you
---
I sold the name Sniper for 5k gold in BC
---
My household income in actually above average, I just have things that actually matter to spend it on.
---
Spending 80$ a month on a 15 year old video game is fucking retarded. Straight retarded.
---
We will find out soon
---
Yes i'm fully aware, I'm just saying that if BRE is viable on pservers where this proc doesn't exist, then it also be viable where the proc exists.
---
Really hope you bring old segments like Memory Lane, Anger Management, Forum &amp; Fauna, and Lore back. I like the Calls a lot, don't get me wrong, but I miss the diversity of earlier episodes. 
---
Cheers, and thanks for your great work!
---
With blizz like server pops the demand won’t be so much higher than the supply. I doubt farming devilsaurs will even be very lucrative if they’re uncontested after a couple of months.
---
It sounds like to me, you need to *cough* get sick *cough* from at least August 27 to 30
---
Hey! i was going to create a Shaman named Thex! Goona have to reserve it on every server then.
---
Either a skinning knife or a level 1 dagger with Fiery Weapon. The 40 damage *melts* mobs at level 1-12ish
---
Yes and no - they are entitled to holiday not entitled to holiday if your boss says yes. You take it at a convenient time more to be helpful than because daddy said so
---
It's lame as hell. I'm allowed to have that opinion. I'm so sorry it upset you so much.
---
13th*, not 17th
---
It's roughly the top warrior spec until bwl is on farm and you can afford those hit piecesfor dual wield. It's harder to play than all other dps which are actually top tier dps. Overall though even with high dps, magea out perform because of their damage absorb and the fact they take less damage while outputting high dps. There is aways a spot for 2h fury though, it uses way less hit gear and no one else can itemize the 2hers apart from 2h fury so it's good to have 1 in the raid.
---
Yep, me and 3 friends are going to LAN!
---
You can just do staff on horde and mace on alliance. Shaman and paladin are kinda mutually exclusive
---
4-5 hunters taken for MC, 3-4 for BWL, 2-3 for AQ, 2 for naxx.
---
If your a decent hunter though, you will have no problems.
---
Also dont worry about 'low dps'.
---
In classic people compare there dps to there same class in the raid, not the overall. Aim to be the best dps out of the hunters.
---
Tauren or Night Elf Druid?
---
What is more useful for an ele shaman- hardiness or warstomp + health?
---
You can though.
---
I get what you mean, but it all comes down to how many EUPVP servers there will be. You can just as easily be stuck on a Spanish/Italian server and speaking from experince, it sucked. Met some friendly people, but finding groups was a hassle when everyone was LFM in their own language. At least with a Nordic server everyone can/will(hopefully) speak English in public
---
Get rid of the baby
---
I'm really sorry for you, that's shitty.
---
Again, no one said anything about gold farming so wtf are you on about lol. 
---
And yes, good luck with that. It’s just as likely that I’ll wipe a raid that’s the same size as me. I’ve done it on retail many times!
---
Nightelf hunter called ElfIegolasx
---
Very interesting survey poll results... looking forward to Classic more and more with each passing day 
---
FOR THE HORDE!
---
Is there a website that has Classic appearances for us to play around with to find a good look we can memorize for the reservation creation? Thanks
---
I feel like time flies by on busy days and can feel like a week on really slow days.
---
All classes except druid :(
---
Are you me?
---
okay so it was an attempt that they retconned? like they had it normalized for a while but then reverted it? Cause I remember them tweaking max level rage atleast
---
Warrior names: Vancleave, Cleaveage, Sunderwear...
---
Of course you do. I just told you my opinion as well. And Blizzards opinion too :) It's called an Argument where to opinions are put to comparison and then you argue which one is actually right/the better.
---
Obiously we have been there and done this - hence it isn't against TOS and EULA. 
---
Just wanted to let you know :D
---
All good brother you didn't upset me much. It is more about the Overall discussion that is - rather annoying than upsetting - because it is pointless.
---
&gt;I spend more on coffee comes out of my cock before the end of the day.
---
And you're making fun of me?
---
I spend my extra income on my dogs, my wife, etc. I also invest in my future so I can retire in my 50s.
---
But yeah spending $1100 a year on wow, and more than $20 a day on coffee (according to your lame ass brag) is definitely the way to go.
---
You aren't stupid at all..
---
Got 2 weeks of vacation for launch.
---
Plan is to:
---
* go hard the first 2-3 days and trying to get ahead of the pack, like playing 12 hours+
---
* after this period I'll play a lot but not more then 10 hours / day, I don't want to just play and sleep the whole 2 weeks of vacation - maybe I'm just to old for something like this now ^^
---
* hopefully get most of the leveling out of the way in my vacation, not sure if getting 60 is necessary the goal, will be most likely a bit to much and I don't want to burn out in any way or ruining the experience completely just to get it done
---
I was hoping they would do a little class balancing. No major changes
---
Nelf
---
Theyre treating layers as individual servers? I didnt know that. I always thought it was different channels on the same server to break up the players, but that the population cap of the server itself was static.
---
Good point and thank you for taking part in the study! :)
---
If you're interested in playing feral end-game Paladin blessings will be more usefull than Shaman totems.
---
If it's PvP you're after, Tauren can War Stomp into Regrowth+Rejuv I think... which is pretty nice.
---
If you just want to Resto heal PvE it doesn't really matter I guess.
---
I heard a rumor that he's working at Disney
---
I hope we won't experience Error 37 all over again.
---
Some guy made a thread asking what we are gonna name our characters and said he was gonna name his Thex. Nobody who replied gave their actual character name, instead everyone claimed they were gonna reserve his name (Thex)
---
I love that he clicks half his abilities lol
---
 No you just wanna know what gear costs in gold and study the economics of wow.. 
---
Good luck? I’ve gathered 30 to counter the devilsaur mafia countless times and they aren’t near as hated as people like you are
---
Instructions unclear, accidentally ran back to corpse
---
Yes. I’m pretty sure it was originally just an EQ site. I definitely used it back in 2000 for my EQ spells and loot.
---
Yeah that's what I was thinking. I dont think they ever actually stated that it would happen at the same time as launch. They just said it would be 2 weeks earlier.
---
Right, with you now. Thex gnome mage it is.
---
Few swipes of a credit card
---
I'm in Sweden and if I don't budget for some of my 30 days by May, the HR lady comes in and makes me take vacation.. Since I don't want it planned by her now I do it myself.
---
But you don't want your employees accruing massive vacation time balances; it means that there is an unhealthy balance at work.
---
My sons name is also Thex.
---
Very helpful! Thank you.
---
If it were like vanilla you would log in after the reset and the server would have rolled back so you would have to do most if not all of the dungeon again.
---
There are more raidspots for ally druids than horde side, and if you're planning on feraling, pala buffs are pretty huge in comparison to WF that does nothing.
---
Oh Lord, what class?
---
 Easy.. rogue..
---
Why is it retarded? Can't People have different priorities and opinions on what is OK to spend on a game and what not? 
---
You told me you are allowed an opinion. Why are they not? Why are they retarded? xD Dude you are spiraling yourself into a dead-end m8 :D
---
It is totally okay for you to think it is too much to spend 80$ per month on a - well - can't really call the game 15 years old since there is changes and a new Client it is running on.. :3 Or would you call Warcraft 3 remastered 17 years old too? :P
---
I know People in mobile games that spend far beyond 400€ each month on a mobile game. For them 80$ would be nothing. Thats how everyone is different and they still don't have to be retarded.
---
Sweet thank you
---
So like, do you have something against people making gold in wow?
---
Like... you brought it up out of nowhere, and proceeded to look through my post history to talk shit about me making gold in wow? Lol
---
Of you like wasting time it sure is! Just open classic dB it takes 30 seconds to find all this info if you know how to read
---
Sure you want to “make gold”. Let’s go with that.
---
You hang around with the wrong sort of people
---
All their numbers are merged... so yea dude, they both impact eachothers. That’s not a question.
---
Good points, yes. I don't think we're going down that path atm, but we may at a later stage. Interesting perspective, thanks.
---
Lol are you accusing me of being a gold seller right now
---
I personally think no person needs to spend that much on a game to be entertained. The money should be used to better their future, or someone elses.
---
To recap. I personally think it's a huge waste of money. I also personally think wasting money is retarded. People are free to be retarded. And I am free to think they are.
---
Does anyone know if the client is available for download (posting from work)?
---
Because having 1 difficulty unites the playerbase. In vanilla/classic, Scrubby McScrubface runs the same dungeons and raids as Mr Hardcore Raider. In retail they never encounter each other or likely interact in any way.
---
If it makes any consolation, I started playing MMOs think week again. :p
---
I've been going back and forth between Druid and Priest. I want to be able to be a main healer in a raiding guild and have a solid spec working my way to 60. I will be playing Horde with a large group of friends, who are playing a diverse set of classes. My considerations:
---
**Priest**
---
*Pro's*
---
* Strongest healer
---
* Shadow to 60 seems to be fun, albeit slow
---
* Mind Control
---
* Having a dream item like Benediction/Anathema looks a great end-goal
---
*Con's*
---
* Worried about solo play as a Holy Priest at 60 
---
* Seemingly limited spellset at 60 in raids
---
* I feel like Priests are worse in PvP while being raid specced/geared
---
**Druid**
---
* Feral to 60 seems to be fun, and relatively fast
---
* Innervate / Brez
---
* I feel like Druids have more PvP options, while being raid specced/geared
---
* Worried about being a gimped class
---
* Worse at healing
---
Anyone who has experience with either of these classes in Vanilla and who wants to share their experiences with me would help me out a ton!
---
Most welcome :)
---
I just want to finish a set and look cool. I don’t care if it’s dungeon set .5, never made a full set of anything before
---
out of the loop what is this thex thing
---
Man I can’t even imagine trying to gatekeep the Wetlands run
---
Can you read? They just confirmed the layer numbers on beta was much smaller than it will be live, they needed to set it low to test it..
---
But HF on your doomsday-rant :-)
---
Hi, yes someone would have to be playing an MMO to take part or to have recently played an MMO. That particular item could have been changes and should have, thanks.
---
Honestly, I am quite concerned about this aswell, but it's a difficult discussion. Most people will jump in your face "no changes means no changes!", but for me it feels like so much lost potential.
---
Little balance tweaks (and with little, I really mean little) on items/spells/talents could provide a complete new drift to the game. It could offset the current meta and even make tons of specs raid/pvp viable.
---
e.g. when Blizz talked at Blizzcon about debuff limits and said that the 8/16 slots were a technical limitation back in the days, I really hoped to see them removing the debuff limit at all. Maybe that's because I experienced it on private servers for multiple years now, but just when thinking of how this could make certain builds (balance druid, shadow priest, affliction lock) viable, it makes me sad to see them restricted just because of that. And before someone comes in and tells me how viable shadow priests and affli locks are, yes you can bring 1 shadow priest to the raid if you have enough warlocks with you. Just 1 tho. And yes you can raid as SM/Ruin as a warlock, however you will rarely make use of dots, most of the time you just spam shadowbolt and sneak in a corruption if the time is right.
---
I know the example mentioned here is not a small tweak and it's impact on raid dps would be huge, but there are tons of other small examples that can make the game feel more dynamic. I just picked this one because it was mentioned during Blizzcon.
---
Personally I'd really love to see small regular adaptions on a patch 2 patch bases, like League of Legends did it a few years ago. (no reworks, really just Skill 1 deals 1,5% more damage, Talent B increases armor by 3%, Item X now has 1 more int, etc.)
---
This is the machinima that made me want to do machinima. Of course I didn't, but it was the ultimate reason I got into video editing.
---
Princess mara is decent and herbalism. Duo with a warrior to farm places like tyrs hand as they kind of suck at solo farming as well.
---
You already can.
---
I'm making a pally on a pve server, i'm  just unsure what i want to level him as. Prot/ret to aoe farm mobs and then start saving up healing quest gear once i get lvl 50ish? Level as holy and do dungeons along the way?
---
It has been for a while.
---
Is the Warlock version of Robe of the Archmage from tailoring just as good for Warlocks as it is for Mages?  
---
eg. Would it be benificial to get tailoring on a Warlock till you can drop the class specific  robe and then drop it for Engineering
---
&gt; because it has 6-9min remaining and bosanc only lasts 5. 
---
Jesus dude... Greater blessing of sanctuary?  [https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=25899/greater-blessing-of-sanctuary](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=25899/greater-blessing-of-sanctuary) 
---
&gt; Higher armor is not true. Especially in the case where he wears the gigaflux helm, the paladin can easily make up the deficit, because a pala doesn't need that item. And even if the pala wears gigaflux too, the extra armor amounts to at best 2 dmg less per hit. 
---
Usually you apply it for the thorn effect then just removes it, this guy is just playing around so hes not doing it that seriously the buff will remain after the helmet is removed.  
---
&gt; Higher armor is not true. 
---
Yes its so so so true, there are no gear that paladin can wear that even comes close to T3. Warrior hit Armor cap without a shield when using a stoneshield potion and buffs lol.
---
&gt; block chance, parry/dodge true. But again that's not really important for such weak mobs and redoubt could be near permanently active against this many mobs, which would make that a moot point anyway. 
---
with redoubt you have like 45-50% block chance?  for 5 blocks.. then its down to bad block rate again, Warriors have way higher base, and getting crit all the time in this scenario is probably deadly, which again is a weak point for paladins.
---
You dont have to pay for classic wow IT comes with the sub. I recommend you letting them try on your account

In vanilla your box had 2 trial account codes aswell aa your top up card coming with 1
---
You’ll be fine healing low level instances no matter what spec you are
---
I can imagine that this cap changed due to the modern server technology.
---
Lmao you’ve kept this gag going all day. Kudos.
---
agree thats why i will not use skinning while leveling up but take tailoring so i can make and sell bags and switch at 60 to engineering
---
Nameistoolon

I pray that you are quick enough on the 13th. Lmao

I don't know the exact formula but this is basically how it works: You still get the same amount of total experience for the group regardless what levels the players are, however the higher level players get a larger portion than the others. This is pretty annoying because even a small exp difference can actually build up over time if you are leveling in group with the same people.
---
doesnt work on classic only on private servers
---
Have fun :)
---
you can probably buy one of the free trial codes that came with a vanilla box for like 50 bucks or something 3rd party
---
I always wish the creator did more of these for other classes.  Though, as a Rogue, I did appreciate getting some love.
---
But the server, presumably, hits a cap. So you end up with a static number of players on a server, but an increased number of spawns depending upon how many layers are open. So you would have a much higher supply than demand compared to a private server.
---
Thez
---
I don't see anything
---
Why don't you just post it on r/wow where they appreciate stuff like this? Your post has no direct connection to Classic WoW, just WoW in general.
---
Is this some USA joke I'm too European to understand? how can a boss deny your personal time?
---
When will you be able to reserve your name? Will it be before the 27th? I’m kinda out of the loop rn
---
What do you mean by mafias?
---
attack speed... but guess you never tried the game aside from the current retail so telling you all you dont know seems to take an eternity.
---
Ebbnflow has 2 great videos on such matter:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7KXRMv0iZw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7KXRMv0iZw) \- Phase 1
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41cfmyFWGP8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41cfmyFWGP8) \- Phase 2
---
TL;DR: HOTW/NS is THE best spec for Phase 1, and also one the best in Phase 2. And be assured, with HOTW spec you can heal AND tank any dungeon and raid (for raiding rather offtanking though)
---
Never accept a counter offer. Workplace rule #1.
---
For AOE farming you need to go Prot/Holy for Consecration. You can heal any leveling dungeon, if you have a set of int/+heal gear while staying in Prot spec. Some respec at level 50 or 55, but you can go to 60 like that and then respec. As a prot you can tank BRD and already get some nice blue healing gear on the side, before you are 60.
---
Yeah mate, that's generally what happens to any drink that you have had, turns to piss and the body removes it before you go to bed.

---
No problem!
---
in the first week i will definately play one seassion for 48H without sleep (ofc food break etc) then sleep like 10h and continue with 12-16h a day till lvl 60. so i think it shoudl be doable
---
Now just let us know what server you’re going on so we can pick any other server.
---
I doubt that I am the only one who doesn't think you need to drop $1000 per year of your salary on extra wow subs for it to be fun.
---
I think someone named “Thex” pissed you the fuck off and you’re trying to get someone to steal the name from that guy.
---
yikes
---
But can you get a free trial sub? Ff14 for example let's you play for free, as long as you want, but has a level cap and you don't have access to a bunch of player interaction things, including their version of the AH.
---
&gt; we tought its better to have a good night sleep
---
Man of culture as well! That's why we are not rushing, rather avoid stressful launch hour and later have chill gaming session! 
---
Thanks and same to you!
---
getting two birds with one stone, smart man
---
Yeah I answered Yes to that question and my private server "experience" is playing for 2 days to test out a class I'd never played before, would've been nice if that was a 3 option question to differentiate between "Never", "A little", and "I have multiple pserver 60s"
---
Fair enough m8! I totally get that. 80$ IMHO is still - in some cases ok. As Long as it is for a game you love and you actually Play very much - go for it I guess. 
---
But I see where you are coming from. There is People that could literally quadruple their income if they had 80$ a month extra. Which is insane... So you have every right to think People are retarded xD
---
Maybe retarded is a bit harsh. Let's call them stupid spendthrifters :P
---
&gt; she will damn well approve it or I'll be headed to HR
---
Just remember, HR aren't there for you.  HR are there to protect your employer.
---
Lmao but why? Do you think it'll still be good for Classic? That's legacy support from hell right there
---
To help with my choice, what class do you most want to see in your groups?
---
It's hard to predict exactly how the ranking environment will turn out in Classic, but I think two things are very likely: more players will be trying hard in PvP compared to any prior vanilla server, and the game will erupt in absolute chaos as soon as phase 2 begins.
---
A trio of players camping a good spot will be raking in honor to the tune of thousands per hour while someone running around alone looking for fights will have long stretches of time without any gains, and needs to be more skilled or better geared in order to succeed at all. Without BGs, casual rankers can't just solo queue and gain a certain baseline minimum of honor income no matter how they do.
---
Meanwhile, if you want to be a hardcore ranker when BGs are available, you have to maintain a consistent premade group. It takes the right combination of classes and enough people to form a full BG team. It's a pretty big commitment. When there's only WPvP, you can just grab whoever's online at any given time and go farm level 55s somewhere. As long as you still put in more hours than most, it's just as effective and far more comfortable.
---
When WPvP is both the only way to rank up and also much more accessible than hardcore premade groups have been, it's gonna be fucking mayhem all over the place. It could become borderline impossible to do anything alone throughout phase 2. I'm not sure people are really prepared. We could be looking at a whole phase where the only way to get to an instance portal is if you bring a big crew of people with you, or where gathering professions become basically unusable if you're a solo player.
---
A lot of players have plenty enough time to go for the higher ranks but didn't do it on pservers because it required joining and scheduling everything around a premade. It's a lot like being in a second guild and many don't enjoy that. Now they can just cruise around in groups of three or four. And just like premades try to avoid fighting other premades, ranking crews will have no incentive to fight eachother more than necessary.
---
You would already expect a higher proportion of serious PvPers even if there were BGs from the start, given how hyped everyone is for Classic and how much people want to make their mark early on. When you no longer need to stick to a rigorous premade situation in order to do it, surely the number of players trying for the high ranks will be way higher than anything we've seen before. It'll definitely be interesting.
---
Will the PvP community be able to maintain an unofficial honor cap that everyone sticks to in order to reduce the hours required to keep up? That could prove hopeless if there are just too many participants and no way to punish anyone for breaking the cap by shutting them out of the premade scene. It might not even be mechanically viable if too many players can reach the permitted amount of weekly honor. If so, it would be every man for himself, and competing for the top ranks requires absurd amounts of hours. You'd have to play as much as whoever plays the most, and there's people who have the ability to put in 16h/day.
---
Yeah same here. I have 3 kids. Named them all Thex so I don't have to shout 3 names constantly.
---
That's my plan as well.
---
Yeah retarded is a bit harsh. Just not smart with their money at all is what I mean. I especially get a kick out of people who brag about being terrible with their money.
---
I usually assume they are compensating for something else..
---
Because, well for several reasons. Tailoring really doesn’t supply a crazy amount of upgrades while leveling. And isnt mandatory for warlock until Bloodvinw which isn’t till phase 3 ZG. Also as lock, First Aid is best friend, and you are reducing resources from that. 
---
You say you aren’t looking for a ton of gold; but you when you hit 60 gold is a game changer. Warlock epic mount isn’t free like the 40 mount, and getting epic riding as soon as possible is one of the biggest upgrades in Vanilla. Think about all the traveling you do and increasing that efficiency by 40%.Also, more so even as a casual player, gathering herbs isn’t as hard as mining  —and are you really going to want to back track through all the low level zones at 60, on your 60% mount because you don’t have quite enough gold for epic mount quest, leveling herbalism for x hours? 
---
If you want to feel productive and take your time I highly recommend trying out fishing and cooking and keep them up to date while leveling(the food buffs are pretty nice for a warlock).
---
Yeah but none of them were continuous. servers went down, people tried other servers, fresh servers came up etc, lots of them have wierd non blizzlike things too. We don't have any non changing blizzlike ones that have kept a stable population for more than a few years, even the old servers on popular realms had drastic population decreases when they released fresh realms
---
I would figure out if there is a profession that will help with the leveling process. For example, I will play a Warrior and take Herb/Skin up until time to do WW axe quest where I will trade skinning for alch and make some nature resist potions to make the fight easier
---
Not in Vanilla/Classic.
---
I think you totally missed that last message about 50 bucks. If you subscribe it is $15. You get up to Legion in retail and classic is free along with it. 15 bucks little man put that shit in their hand. Or you could spend 50 bucks to try it out
---
Leveling as a priest is not that slow. You can be killing mobs very mana efficiently, especially with a good wand and spec points in Improved Wand damage. Priests are the most versatile healers.
---
Druids level even faster and find good raid spots, because they are rare. This way you get your full Tier set quicker. and if you are bored, you can collect a tanking set and tank 5 mans as a feral tank.
---
I will just make sure to get the asap. Thanks for the tip.

Your a moron if you think this won’t happen just because it’s not official. It’s a big business on Runescape run by players, why wouldn’t it be in WoW (unless it’s bannable)
---
I'd like to know how many other hobbies give hours and hours of entertainment daily, 7 days a week for $20.
---
/sit doesn't work in Classic from what we have seen anyway.
---
AOE is pretty poor until you get "geared" for it, or are killing undead. Your only AOE for a while is Consecration and Ret aura. You aren't getting improved ret aura, or any of the other reflect damage until much later because they are down different trees than Consecration. You don't get holy wrath until 50 to AOE undead. You want the best shield spike you can buy. You want either Skullflame shield (rare and expensive) or engineering for Reactive disk (expensive to repair). You need a certain threshold of enough mana to kill everything and enough health/armor to live through it.
---
Pick 1.
---
I see intelligence is your dump stat.
---
Must not be leveling up weapon skill.
---
Nope.
---
Go to the WoW tab. There's a a drop down menu titled "Version". Change it from "World of Warcraft" to "World of Warcraft Classic."
---
I really wish blizzard would adopt the OSRS model and forge their own destiny
---
eg. Create completely fresh content, which fits the gameplay and style of wow classic..
---
Make trial accounts in retail and play the first 20 levels with your friends, it's not classic but they get to do some quests and they can try a dungeon. It's not a huge time investment, you can probably get to level 20 in 2-3 hours.
---
Guess you don't get to play Classic then.
---
Blizzard will launch at least one "fresh" 1.13 classic servers each time Naxx is reached by the previous...?
---
I think there is a problem. If i wanted say 100g in classic and someone wanted 100k in retail (idk what the rate would be) then i could just buy a wow token for bfa gold, thus in theory buying classic gold
---
That's why you get some spirit gear and switch to it while still running. If you have a lot of spirit, you will gain health rather quickly and be able to pull again. Even if you only kill 2 mobs between quest objectives, that's still a lot of xp.
---
Who said it won't happen?
---
Just wait like a week after character creation had started and so it late at night. The chances that anyone will take in 30 seconds at that specific time is really slim.
---
You’re not breaking any rules. If I wanted to give you gold in classic and you wanted to give me gold in retail that’s not breaking any rules. That’s what friends do. They help each other out.
---
Yeah well obviously the market would decide the rate. It wouldnt be 1:1
---
Is the dance mandatory to succeed ?
---
Could be worse, I can stay up to 11. Sucks to be further east in Europe though!
---
Sure, but that's the way it has been done in the past. It's not a perfect system, but it means you don't have to play 100h/week in order to get past R12. Doesn't matter how good or bad the idea is, they'll do it if they can and won't if they can't. If they can't, it just about doubles the time commitment. That's why they've been doing it. It's a system that allows you to compete even if you have a job or whatever.
---
&gt;Noone will help you. 
---
???
---
I'm quite sure you can't Free Trial Classic.
---
Pretty sure that was a wrath thing
---
&gt; Jesus dude... Greater blessing of sanctuary? 
---
I know how the icons look, thank you very much. Would you please look at that icon? Do you see it anywhere in the first couple clips of the video? If so, please point it out to me, because not even in his mc clip, where he got three greater blessings can I find it.
---
What he has is something with the icon of normal bosanc: https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20913/blessing-of-sanctuary
---
But this can't be bosanc, because the duration is too long.
---
&gt; Yes its so so so true, there are no gear that paladin can wear that even comes close to T3. Warrior hit Armor cap without a shield when using a stoneshield potion and buffs lol.
---
And what does it matter? Assume the pala wears 5/5 avenger, the 5 corresponding dreadnaught t3 pieces have a combined 300 armor more. Even so, what's your point? If a warrior can reach armor cap without a shield, then the paladin shouldn't have trouble reaching armor cap with a shield. It's not like a prot pala will have over 2k less armor. 
---
&gt; with redoubt you have like 45-50% block chance? for 5 blocks.. then its down to bad block rate again, Warriors have way higher base,
---
Warriors have ~30% block without shield block, palas ~20%. You also have holy shield to get 30% blockchance for 4 blocks and a crit for ~250 every couple seconds isn't too bad. So, the warrior has ~50-55% avoidance the entire fight, the paladin only has ~35% avoidance permanently, but gains 30% from redoubt. Depending on how frequently you get crit, this is more or less useful. Statiscally assuming 20 mobs and 5% crit chance, you'll get crit once and avoid 5 attacks for it on the next round. So discounting shield block and holy shield, the warrior takes 9-10 hits for ~110 dmg per round of attacks. The paladin takes 1 crit for 220 and 7 hits for ~95 dmg. That's 1000-1100 dmg for the warrior and ~900 for the paladin. If the paladin doesn't get crit, he takes 13 hits for 95 dmg, so 1235 total.
---
And what if i don’t even know what server i wanna play on? Have the servers been announced at all?
---
Moron
---
Blizzard isn’t marketing it because retail is where the most money comes from. It’s the whole reason they didn’t give us classic earlier. As to not impede on their retail sales. An example of my argument is classic will not have mounts, pets and tmog available to purchase through the store. There is literally nothing that they can implement into classic to change that, aside from possibly tokens for play-time. And even with tokens in classic, retail still has that avenue of revenue plus others.
---
What queues will there be in phase one? I don't think Classic will have a single queue until BGs.
---
Yeah imo beta showed us that it wasn't worth it pre-40 compared to the loss in kill speed you have to suffer due to A) making pet stop attacking and B)you stop wanding.
---
As long as you have a good wand, at least up to level 40, it seems better to wand then use rank 1 imp. drain soul. And higher ranks are even less worth it. But the equation might change around 40.
---
Mine's going to be Zargoltir.

I have 4 of the old 2012 Naga model (blue one). When they changed to that newer green one they changed the shape and I hated it so I keep an eye out on eBay and pick up the old when whenever I find it.

They have an issue with the left mouse button double clicking on a single press so I've now started replacing the micro switches for the LMB. You can get 5 for $5 on Amazon and they aren't that hard to do of you're half way decent at soldering. If you can't solder for shit then you can just replace the switches internals.

Nordic people are pretty good at English and very possible other European languages aswell. You really shouldn't be afraid of a language barrier - it's not like they understands each others language anyway

Yeah, what the fuck. I just turned 39 about a week ago. RIP my future I guess.
---
How would this affect the economy in any way at all ? There's no actual funneling of gold going on. The gold on the Classic (and retail) server is already on the server, it's just changing hands. 
---
I guess you could argue that it might incentivize gold farming even more, but this would be a drop in the bucket compared to straight up gold selling.
---
It would cause more people to farm for it and eventually have "switchers" being quite frequent, as well as it being a portable respec unless it was kept to a trainer. It doesn't make the game look better to me.
---
Something something little something Classic WoW.
---
I'd love to see this, and other 30+ of a single class in Raids to see how it turns out. I hope there is at least one Guild out there that does this and makes videos on it.
---
because of fresh servers. How many private servers had a decent population after 2 or 3 years?
---
You can't delete the character and then make a new one right away at launch?
---
If they were warrior specs holy pal would be protection warrior and resto sham would be arms war. They have much in common but they play very differently. 
---
Holy pal utility is stronger but on longer cooldowns, so pal looks at every scenario as a healer first. Shaman has more utility on short cooldowns and a good shaman will focus equally on utility and healing. Paladin is reactive, shaman is proactive in approach.
---
Overall paladin is stronger and has more impact in pvp and pve. This is partly because shaman is the harder class to play well and partly due to the toolkit. However, shaman offers a lot more flexibility for a creative player looking to shine.
---
Two good choices. If you go paladin be sure to make some friends to level with because the process can be very slow and dull for them.
---
The laughter is a MUCH better response than I'd expect. That's a good sign.
---
Like r/Undolips said above, try to create a trial NA account linked to your B.net.

While I enjoyed playing a druid at times the majority of it felt like i was always runner-up. I played from launch so I did play through some rough times for druids, which is important to relate to my points below. It's the hybrid tax that really made me feel underwhelming as a character.
---
I could stealth and cat dps but it was a longer CD than a rogue, didn't have the stuns or ability to vanish or even put out real damage. You could tank to a degree but raids weren't reasonable for the average bear. Offensive casting was meh, healing was fine but in a dungeon you needed a OOC res, because a lot of people were still in shit gear and knowledge was low, and in raids you were 31 points in to resto for innervate, for the priests, which gimped you in open world. PVP was fine if you liked playing support and running away but the lack of burst to kill people I found frustrating. Itemisation was a problem for a long time too. I probably shouldn't have played a druid. That said, I loved my druid in TBC. 
---
I think a lot of the problems will be moot with a 1.12 start but I don't think I can go back through it all again.
---
Confirmed to be working on beta.
---
Rip name Thex
---
Literal translation: "only a little left until classic" so somethingakin to "Classic is almost here"
---
One thing about Joanas Guide is that it was originally written while leveling a hunter. The guy grinded a LOT while running from one objective to the next, not every class can do that. (He changed it a lot for classic release though)
---
From my experience (1-60 as rogue from launch day onwards) you always fall behind after a while.
---
You can fix that by doing dungeons (with ALL the quests for each one) from lvl35+.
---
If this discourages you you honestly shouldn't bother playing at all. This is nothing.
---
I'm probably gonna go with Thex, maybe troll shaman or smth.

I tried out both 2H Arms and 2H Fury in Vanilla in raids and they were both viable. Obviously not optimal, but it works just fine. If you do go arms though, just avoid using mortal strike and dump your rage with other abilities.
---
If they don't prevent you from taking personal time, they can still prevent you from taking *specific* personal time.

Usually this is reserved for busy seasons, or when a lot of people want the same time off. Accounting loves when people take time off in dead weeks.
---
It's more difficult than just making a new widget with a new countdown.  The link to the site is unnecessary.  You just have to do "release time" - "current time" and display it in one of the various formats while having it update to whatever the smallest increment is (in this case milliseconds).
---
What’s with everyone thinking they’re going to be making money with mining/skinning? If everyone takes these professions, nobody is gonna be making money from them. Especially early on when there is no money in the game.

Haha haha
---
All boils down to $$$$
---
Do you really think Activision wants a mass exodus of players from their user base who constantly buys cosmetics and what not to go play a version of the game with none of it?
---
They are just throwing us a bone for extra $$ subs like myself who got bored of their expansions years ago.
---
There is that scene in captain america 3 when stan lee calls iron man tony stank. In retail this name was still available. Will go for tonystank again
---
One thing I forgot to add: stealth can make WoW a completely different game. You'll have this at your disposal as a druid. Farming as a healing spec is doable but definitely miserable. So, as a druid, I would just stealth in caves and mine thorium veins. I memorized the thorium routes in Winterspring and just do a 30 minute session. If you get at least 1 arcane crystal, that's easily 15-30g with the thorium (varies with server economy).
---
On my priest, I was a tailoring/enchanter. I sold mooncloth which was roughly 15g every 3 days for my server. I would disenchant dungeon drops and sell on AH. Enchanting requires rep grinding so I just speccd shadow for a short time and grinded rep / whatever else I needed. 
---
As a mainly healing spec, you have less choices for making gold (especially when it comes to killing things) but you aren't exactly helpless. I relied on my professions + fishing. Fishing is boring for most people and can be easy gold during downtime.
---
There isn't for me. :( Unless I have to buy BFA to not play BFA.
---
This doesn't appear for me and I check daily. EU.
---
It is bannable though.
---
Thex, he'll be a shaman.
---
Josh - will you be continuing the podcast after release? (Not sure if this has been answered already) 
---
I’ve grown used to your voice on my daily drive to work!
---
Or maybe because it makes more sense to start marketing when the advertised product is actually available?
---
Are there any limitations on the free trial other than level cap? Ie can't form groups, no whispers, no access to ah, things like that?
---
Not available for EU yet
---
I think you have to have an active sub? Or maybe payed for all expansions?
---
Regular retail sub includes both Classic and Retail games.
---
Consider herb/alch from the start.
---
Definitely DO NOT try to level enchanting at 60 that is one that is such a pain to level at Max. Grinding out those low level greens will make you wanna pull your hair out. Not to mention the fact that enchanting is one of the least casual friendly of all the profs.
---
Engineering is good for pve as well but mainly to make up for lack of utility in certain classes imo (Hunter and rogue especially).
---
Make his guild this time you lead it and help Lowbie friends
---
EU I presume ? Download is not available yet on EU for whatever reason.
---
hm, now I want a Shaman named Thex...
---
Warriors have way more avoidance then that vs a level 60 mob they have atleast, with that gear.  
---
15% parry chance, 15% dodge chance, and probably closer to 45% block thanks to how defense works and how much block there actually is on naxx tanking gear, and lets not forget that its like 10% miss chance aswell. Since paladins cant effectively reach those numbers of defense they are not going to get close to those numbers.  
---
And Warriors also have Demoralizing shout which is probably the best mitigation ability in the game thanks to how bosses and mobs work.
---
Any source? Or just intuition? Free trials in some shape aren't super uncommon in MMOs.
---
Ok. Can you please link me to a confirmation of that?
---
Thank you kindly.
---
I see everyone going engineering tbh. I don’t think we know what will happen, and gathering professions will still be useful just like they were back in the day. The number of people isn’t going to mean it’s a bad idea to pick one of these. You’re blowing it out of proportion a bit. Plus, layering.
---
I bet your boss is playing wow during those dates
---
I personally believe cross realm BGs were such a change.
---
Also has the added functionality of showing how many times i can fap before release.
---
LEEERRROOOOOYYY JENNKKIIIIINNNSSSSS
---
That's a lot of effort to do something that requires no effort.
---
August 12th in US / August 13th World Wide. Not positive on time, 6:00 PM EST would be my guess. 
---
Active subscription required. 3 name reserves per account.
---
It's not legal to deny accrued vacation time in many states. Get in touch with a local lawyer.
---
Not only may you wind up with your vacation request, you might also be able to sue and settle for a nice bonus :)
---
[Oh....just 26 days you say?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA1mbZ_MMh8)
---
Reddit is not “everyone”
---
No no. They can’t tell you not to buy tokens. They can’t tell you not to trade or mail gold to a friend. See what I’m saying?
---
Don't you get a few days of game time with starter accounts?
---
I myself don't recall a Zaar however their toons were "Tumuch (Orc warlock)" and Abrilla (tauren warrior) 
---
I think after awhile that specific guild on lothar fractured to a guild called Z force which they went with Z force instead of staying with The Elites.
---
Hmm strange.  I would get on your computer and get to suppose live chat and ask.  You def want to have it DLed before name day.
---
First 60 first guy with thunder fury first rank 14 AND ima open dem gates!
---
Why would a Hunter spamming wingclip be better than a Warrior spamming Hamstring?
---
Not saying that not giving activision money is not a good idea. But $7 to get the name you want?
---
That's a steal, at least compared to the prices of services on retail. People would gladly pay $20+ for that easily.
---
Naxxramas seems aimed quite high with only blue PvP gear.
---
What's perfectly viable almost up to Phase 4-5 is the 2 piece PvP Setbonus 23 SpD - especially for Mage with the boots (1 % hit) / shoulders (1 % crit)
---
Otherwise get the Bloodvine Set and you can probably skip a good part up to AQ.
---
In the end it all comes down what a guild needs - if you're the only mage available they'll take you even with only a carrot on a stick
---
If your focus is on hitting 60 first I would not get a profession but go for 2 gathering skills and just sell it all.  
---
Tailoring is easiest to level as it just require all types of cloths, I would just cash it all while leveling and get that mount first.
---
I personally find herbalism better then mining but if you go engineering I think mining is in your case better.  
---
I would only take engineering for pvp, if your focus is raiding I personally like alchemy/herbalism better.
---
Looks like I'll be making a new home page now.
---
At least the response wasn't "... Are you fuckin kidding me? You know what, I think I have an appointment then at my Mother's, hopefully give you some time to get your life together. PS: I'm sleeping with Jerry"
---
45% block seems extreme. Even if I add all the items, which grant blockchance together I get 27%. Add to that 5% from def, talents and base block and you get 42, with every single item available. Misschance is true, I didn't consider that at all. 
---
But fine if those avoidance are so high warrior is better. We can knock up warrior to 75% avoidance and paladin to 45%. Then we have 550 dmg taken on the warrior and with one crit 220 + 5x95, that's ~700. Now the warrior is ahead by 20%, but the absolute difference is very small.
---
Fuck you then crybaby
---
What’s meta mean again? Most Effective Team I think I forgot what the A means.
---
Not sure, but I would imagine that it has limitations like that. 
---
Even with limitations it will still show them the game, if they hate retail they are probably not going to enjoy classic. If they like it or think they might like it they can spend the money to buy a months of game time, if they find out later they hate the game it's only 15$ they lost.
---
Willferal
---
For horde, I would go Orc if PvE is your only concern.  Blood Fury brings a decent attack power boost for a cooldown.
---
If you're going to PvP at all, either Orc for stun resist, or Undead for WotF are the best racials.
---
Troll berserking is good, but you have to be ~40% hp for it to get the max effect.  If you are able to consistently and safely get to that health threshold I could see it being alright, but Orc overall is better imo.
---
It says you need an active sub to play. You can still free trial retail.
---
Absolutely, I actually find Rogue more cumbersome than Warrior.
---
Is that a hard character limit or just for August 13th? I'd be pretty sad if I could only have 3 characters on my classic account (main/alt+bank?)
---
Where did they say? I havnt been able to find anything about it
---
A pally named blessinslave
---
It's 100 STR, not 50, and it's actually much more powerful in practice, because when it procs you practically one-shot whatever you're fighting, and it heals for ~100 hp which is huge at that level.
---
Ure not doing dungeon grinding? I cant even think of leveling in zones with that muvh chars lol
---
&gt;Give the game 2-3 years and the community will ask, nay BEG for content updates via polls.
---
The problem with this is that the community driven changes is what led to what we have today. You dont want the people that plays your game to decide how the upcoming content has to be or which classes have to be buffed or nerfed, you want a good talented team of guys in the development and creative like they had back in the good ol'Blizzard days, anyways just my two cents.
---
Dude posts thread asking what people plan to name their character, puts his plan for shaman named Threx in the post. People memed the commwnt section saying they will pick that name too.
---
I'm in the exact same boat - leaning troll actually even though wotf is sick early on.
---
I can't see it either and I'm not subbed. I think you need to be subbed. Someone can confirm this?
---
I might be wrong absolut it bring a bannable offense. At least I cannot find it at the moment.
---
Troll.
---
I was thinking of rolling a Shaman, probably named Thex...
---
I dunno, might delete later...
---
Tauren are ok. Undead are Kill on sight
---
Why does naxx fuck over pvp? I didn’t play vanilla so I have no idea
---
I'm thinking go for Warrior, I forget mention it.
---
You can also wear a darnassus tabard to get rep
---
 *hahahahahahahahahahahahaha*
---
Translation:
---
I dare you! I double dare you, mother#%$&amp;#@!
---
I’ll explain it without the insults.  An expansion is completely different.  For example, on retail there are 246 servers.  The population is already set on these servers.  If one gets too out of hand they have systems in place to widen the load, and this is with 246 servers.
---
Classic servers are not set.  They said they are keeping a slim realm list, so every server on classic is 100% going to be a ‘full’ population server, regardless of how many servers there actually are.
---
Also with an expansion, blizzard tends to give you early quests specifically designed to widen to load on the servers.  Most quests at the start of an expansion is a type of instance or qued quest to ‘take you out’ of the crowd.  Also, when you start questing everyone can choose where to go which ends up having everyone spread out across the whole new content.
---
Classic is going to have everyone crammed into starting areas, for hours, there’s nowhere to go, the servers are at max capacity, it’s going to be way worse than any recent expansion.
---
It’s not even remotely comparable.
---
I also get no changes, but in PvP, some classes are just ridiculously better than the others. I get rock, paper, scissors, but it's not a good design if (for example) it's next to impossible to kill a spriest as a druid, in my opinion.
---
T2 items are cool its a good beginning to start and try naxxx. but its class dependent.
---
me as shadow priest have not lots of items.
---
Just for early name grab. Character limit at launch is 9 per server, I believe.
---
you can get and will get banned for using it.
---
31th? Nice to see Mike Tyson is getting in on the classic wow
---
Yeah? Well I'm going for 37,993 minutes the first week.
---
My guess is yea it’ll be in client. It’ll be just like your logging in normally but all you can do is select realm and make your toon can’t log in.....OR CAN YOU?!!!! DUHN DUN DDUN??!!

How can you tell someone plays horde? Don't worry, they'll tell you.
---
Cool, thanks! Good to know
---
What's the date for name reservation?
---
The blue pvp gear is pretty good when used as a 2set, so that's 2 items you do get. Maybe you will get exalted with AB doing this pvp grind so you can buy the weapon. But the rest has to be bought or raided with. You basically just have to join a guild and raid there's no "just gonna do this boss for that piece" kind of raiding in vanilla. 
---
So essentially, go rank up, after that get all the amazing dps items that you can obtain outside of raids(it's a fairly long list), and then just join a raid guild.
---
Your post comes from a good place, but this sub is kind of on the warpath against these types of things lately.
---
Ahh, ok.
---
I was Orc Warrior, perhaps best known for being poor (guild lend me 40 something gold to buy a mount at lvl 47 (I know, lol)) and by wearing Paladin shoulders (yellow ones) for a long time.
---
I was also heavy into PvP (ironic, perhaps, since it was PvE).
---
I can't remember the name of the guild leader, but I remember few names such as Tyranthrax (Undead Mage), COwenbunny (Tauren druid) who sounded like a merry hippy, doing voices and laughs, such nostalgia.
---
My memory is hazy regarding other names, unfortunately :(
---
A nice lady (Orc Hunter) who was from Florida (I know her real name) got me ino the guild and the Guild Leader actually gave (sold?) me one of his extra keys.
---
All in all, the guild was amazing, so many nice people, many families playing together and such. Playerss were all around the world, too, USA, UK, Australia, Netherlands and so on.
---
Hunter without NF = Useless
---
Warrior without NF= TopDPS
---
It's only for August 13th
---
My wife is looking forward to launch as it means I will leave her alone!! 🤓
---
I remember before wow token people would sell shop items like mount or pet for gold. "Ill buy you a $20 shop mount for 20k" and blizzard didnt stop that
---
Good thing wow and wow is the same game platform.
---
Blizzard have said they will be releasing the server names before the name reservation day so that guilds/communities can co-ordinate.
---
Yeah i modified the numbers now, had to log in and check on my warrior. block chance wasen't 45% its around 32 without any procs/buffs. but it still adds upp to around 80% mitigation, vs a paladins 45%, and paladins have blessing of sanctuary warriors have demo shout which is better. and then we add in defensive stance. You can see how in the end its going to add up to close to 30% less damage taken then a paladin. And that was just a guess But we're getting pretty close to it.
---
Sounds spot on mate
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/asljj7/does_size_matter/
---
I don't think this dongeon really need a guide haha
---
Pally for the buffs, and heals.  They can also run a bit faster than the rest so you're not dragging your bro down in movement speed.  You can also tank dungeons or heal so you'll never have a problem finding groups quickly.
---
Sharding will make it better to just do starter zones guys Idk if there’s a need for this anymore yea?
---
Undead warrior named Smokey Bones. Any of you take this I will never forgive you.
---
Of course you are right, thanks for the tip!
---
skinning and tailoring for leveling. drop skinning once youve farmed enough gold for epic mount + mats to level engi from AH.
---
Ok, so I'll be able to play on Tuesday when I get back from work (or even when I wake up at 6 to start questing lol).  
---
It's so confusing to use midnight as a release I think. Maybe that's just me being dense.
---
At least I'm not you.
---
ow nvm - its the 30th :)
---
well start @ 27 with playing ofc, but the first weekend we all gather at 1 location :D
---
Out of the loop guy here. What's that joke all about?
---
Not sure but it would make sense.
---
You mean 632 hours, right?
---
I miss the website [Lanparty.com](https://Lanparty.com) I used to host lan parties by posting there all the time.
---
With some of the best gold making methods you can make about 125G per hour. This means 1712 hours of goldfarming efficiently, or 71 days /played. That's a bit unrealistic, so basically you would need to do various rich-gets-richer methods like flipping and controlling the market once you have sizable capital.
---
I'm not even trying to play on launch day. The game will be out on tuesday 27. I'm gonna start playing on friday.
---
This is hysterical! Seriously, pure comedy gold. To say that you are full of shit is an insult to liars that actually care enough and are clever enough to invest the time and energy required for a plausible cover story,  This is the block over which you continually stumble.
---
Look, I can see your feelings are hurt and I don’t really want to dog pile on you. Let me offer a bit of advice. There are people that come to these boards looking for real advice from folks with good judgement and real experience. If you have something to share, that’s great just don’t post suggestions to threads that you have no real experience with. Anyone can google a subject and throw out a line or two but without fully understanding the context it just leads to less thorough understanding and spreads confusion. 
---
Maybe you are the world’s most knowledgeable enchanter for example..awesome! Stick to that. But when you go beyond that scope be sure to include caveats such as “I read somewhere” or “imo this might work” or “I haven’t played that class but I saw this steam and here’s a link”. This is how we build a stronger knowledge base and a more knowledgeable community.
---
Peace out,
---
Ps-keep the middle school comebacks in the past where they belong. Not everyone here is a functional 12 year old.
---
Be sick on friday, she deserve that... I praise the sky to have such a wonderful boss.

not sure but I figure you would need a sub.  It should be coming up soon
---
Or it will end up like shattered hand where people spoke Swedish in trade chat.
---
Because he obviously prefers a buyer's market.
---
Good man, see you on The fields of battle
---
I don't think there is much blizzard can do to stop this, sure it is bannable but how high is the chance they find out and put their resources into it?  
---
Same goes for all the gold selling sites nothing to stop them now so nothing to stop them on classic servers.
---
Big question is how do you make sure you don't get scammed?
---
What about a character creation timer?
---
What's this Thex thing?
---
I’m talking specifically about players who didn’t create content, but were so popular they most likely had content created for them. Similarly to how every other post on this forum references the almighty shaman Thex
---
Damn Vikings. When they are united, nothing can stop them.
---
Good luck guys, but please announce the realm name.
---
Blue pvp gear is basically equal to MC gear.
---
Half of the slots does not have any pvp item or not any good pvp item, so you still need to get neck, trinkets, rings, cloak, weapon, belt, bracers somewhere.
---
I doubt you can get into Naxx without a mix of AQ/ZG/bwl gear (probably a lot of people with better gear, so why pick someone with gear that is just a little better than pre-raid gear).
---
Noone on my faction in vanilla cleared Naxx, it isn't something that will just give free loot to everyone like LFR, so you probably have to put effort in to getting into the good guilds that does it.
---
Yeah you need an active sub.
---
right? horrible cringy music. Animations are dope though.
---
Oh, I am sorry that I care about character identification in an **RPG**.
---
Yeah it's not ideal but if the starter zone is totally packed it's a way to do something while it dies down and you do save yourself the walking time later
---
The PvP meta will change if crossrealm BGs are a thing. R14 groups use queue dodging and win trading to gain honor and these will be significantly harder with dozens of R14 groups. As it is now, Alliance tend to dominate organized pvp but they know that win trading offers a faster solution to gain honor so they take an L for the sake of efficiency. It will be nigh impossible to organize win trading across an entire CRBG. 
---
You will see specs like PoM pyro mages and destro warlocks become more common because of their burst potential. The general idea as horde today is to win fast because the longer the fight goes on the more it favors alliance. You'll see fewer warrior centric groups on horde. Mark my words.
---
For Rogue, you will be playing Combat *whatever the best weapon is that you have access to* spec.  You will likely have to commit to this playstyle until the other melee dps is geared as well, especially at the start.
---
Your playstyle will basically revolve around:
---
- knowing where to stand (out of the fire)
---
- managing threat (not too difficult with feint and vanish)
---
- keeping Slice and Dice at 100% uptime
---
- knowing when it's the best time to pop Adrenaline Rush (is Vanish ready to handle the threat spike if necessary?  Will the boss be stationary for the next 15 seconds?  Is this phase even dangerous to my guild, or should I hold off for another minute?)
---
- maximizing your utility by having goblin jumper cables for when your last shaman uses their self-rez cooldown
---
- being ready to evasion tank for a few seconds while you reposition the boss and communicate vanish-timing with your tank (happened to me on one of our first Ony kills haha)
---
If you are totally new I would recommend you play hunter, easy to learn, hard to master.

Waiting until at least 5 of us are in the high 50s so we can make the agenda “get multiple preraid BiS items for the group and then raid Tarren Mill”
---
Can you implement Swatch Beats please?
---
Not sure that this is really included in this section. It was clearer in older versions of the tos. I'd say its just not supported by Blizzard.
---
Man it's really okay.
---
I understand that you aren't interested in min / maxing or tryharding.
---
It's okay. People can play the game casually. It's nothing for you to get upset about.
---
If you enjoy playing a class for the memes and how it looks (front flips!) that's totally okay.
---
Not everyone wants to be the best. You just do you and have a fun time bud. 
---
Not everyone is cut out to be a part of server firsts, and that's okay.
---
Do we even have server lists yet ?
---
People complaining about the lack of meta changing and here I am just happy to play whatever I want regardless if it’s “the best”. 
---
It’s an MMO - play what you want. Get bored of the meta? Roll a meme spec and see what you can do with it... who cares if it’s not the best spec for X or Y, it kicks ass at Z!
---
If you only want to play the “best” pve dps or pvp class/spec, maybe challenge yourself after a year and switch to playing something that isn’t as easy to perform well as.
---
Naxx gear is too powerful, simply put. The problem with Naxx gear is that it's not only the strongest gear in the game by item level (i.e. raw stats amount), but Blizzard also went ahead and gave most items (near) optimal stat distributions. The scaling is turned up to 11 and the difference in the speed that different classes scale at is made painfully visible (e.g. Warlocks becoming complete monsters).
---
Classes were just never really balanced around Naxxramas level of gear. The best balance is BWL/early AQ. MC/AQ40 is still fine as well as it's "close enough" in terms of stats, but Naxxramas just blows all previous gear out of the water far too hard.
---
When/how can we reserve our name?
---
Suomi, Suomi!
---
Getting a business degree from a community college, state school, and a school like UPenn’s Wharton School of Business is totallyyy the same thing.

I'm not sure but I sure do hope I get to play my troll shaman named Thex on a Classic World of Warcraft server.
---
Okay...but we're talking about with NF. You want to bring an NF to the raid. You can have either a Warrior or Hunter use it. Why bring the Hunter at all?
---
sorry for my ignorance but then whats the use of a nordic server?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cjrmyv/character_creation_in_2_weeks/
---
I vaguely remember that.
---
Very true. Pservers where the mafia has been successful in making money had WAY higher population than blizzlike (3-4 times the cap, and since they are global servers those numbers are consistent throughout the day meaning a much greater total pop of active players), and they had (well for what we know) pretty much blizzlike spawn rate on devilsaurs. So with easily 5 times more demand with same supply, and the ability for such mafia's to farm 24-7 by having both european and american players working together, they could drive up the price heavily. 
---
There's just NO way that this is feasible in classic, you won't be able to control the market especially not in phase 1 since securing 3-4 layers of devilsaurs at the same time is just implausible, and with region-locked servers you just cannot get the manpower to farm 24-7, and there's just not the demand to drive up prices, and lastly this is without even talking about cross faction collusion which isn't allowed in classic.
---
TL;DR Mafia cannot exist in classic, there's no way. Devilsaurs will pretty quickly lose value, but doing the first couple of months they will definitely be good money makers.
---
Uh how to get the game, it's not on steam is it? Last time around I got it on disk.
---
Next time you feel bored make a countdown until classic in different quantities from [https://www.worldometers.info/](https://www.worldometers.info/).
---
The big question would be how much time is there between phase 1 and 2, they put Dire Maul further back because that was how it was in classic and some rewards from there really helped progression in MC.  
---
But to be honest I think a lot of people will within weeks clear parts of MC and top guilds will have cleared MC by end of week 2.  
---
Would not be surprised if phase 2 is started very quick else DM is totally useless addition.
---
There's horse armour in that game? That you buy with real $? Lol are you serious?
---
Jajajajaja😁
---
It means to burst someone down instantly.
---
Really torn between shaman and priest.  This will be my main and likely a healbot as I’m quite sold on a hunter alt which I’ll use for farming.  How would you compare priest and shaman healing in BGs, world pvp, dungeons, and raids?  What are the meaningful differences?  Thanks!
---
I think before tbc launched WoW subscriber account was around 6 or 7 million? I’d love to own a company where a simple 6,000,000 x $15 = $90,000,000 a month is chump change not worth investing in...
---
Found the alliance! That didn't take long.
---
&gt;Nope

---
And yes 80% mitigation is insane, I wish that paladins actually were better tanks since I play one myself. But I when people say that they are better then warriors at certain things when they really aren't I have to barge in.  
---
But yes paladins are better at building threat if we dont get to use consumables/proffesions or other players spells. on 20-30 elite mobs, they can however not survive it which a warrior can I guess thats the conclusion.
---
If you're going to be leveling with a Hunter, any class is works. Rogue does compete with gear though. Pally or priest would be best for finding dungeon groups. You'll be healing at endgame either way.
---
Alright guys, if anyone can shed some light I’d greatly appreciate it. Been grappling w this for a while but I can’t decide which one to roll as a main and an alt out of these 3: warrior, warlock, rogue
---
I’m planning on playing pretty frequently, anywhere from around 20 hours a week, but could easily be more depending on how free my weekend is because there will be weeks I log 35+. I will be second in command of a guild, with my brother (an experienced guild leader) at the helm. He will be rolling Druid and we will level on and off on the path to 60. Will be on a PvP server so I do pride myself on world pvp, will run a few BGs here and there but not going to grind for high rank. We won’t be a hardcore guild but will be looking to progress consistently. My goals in classic are the following: enjoy the leveling experience (running dungeons w guildmates, killing horde in stv, questing at my own pace, leveling professions), clearing raid content incrementally, naturally I want to enjoy the gear I’m accruing and I want to be a force in world pvp.
---
I’ll give some pros and cons that have arisen for me:
---
Warrior pros: I don’t foresee myself being a main tank at 60 due to the commitment but I love the ability to tank 5 mans on the path to 60, as dungeons are some of my favorite parts of the game, therefore my gear should be pretty up to date. I like how a warrior uses a whole arsenal of weaponry, 1h and 2h. I much prefer plate gear compared to anything else
---
Warrior cons: Overpopulated class, have heard that it’s a pain in the ass to gear a dps warrior as well as being very expensive, have checked some bis lists which put leather gear which is fine but as a warrior I want to wear plate bc then I’m just a rogue wearing a 2h without stealth, can’t farm gold well like other classes, pretty weak without sustainability
---
Rogue pros: will be able to synergize with Druid while in stealth, melee dps which suits my style, world pvp god, better at questing than warrior
---
Rogue cons: saturated class, same gear competition as warriors, gear competition early with my Druid leveling partner, won’t be able to find groups as easily but might be offset by the fact I’ll be in a guild, can’t use two handers but one handers and daggers are cool
---
Warlock pros: cool class flavor, demons are dope, Mount quests, brings a cool niche utility like banish and soulstones, cool tier sets
---
Warlock cons: cloth wearer, summoning bitch, I play alliance so will of the forsaken would be annoying, I prefer using melee weapons as opposed to casting daggers or staves but not the end of the world.
---
The main thing I’m lacking is actually playing and experiencing these classes to know what it’s like day to day or at 60, or what gear I can expect to use (I had no clue fury warriors would be decked out in leather and mail which sucks, breaks the immersion for me). Haven’t played since late WotlK and I was a hunter/DK main.
---
All in all I’d end up maining one of these classes and using the other as an alt, possibly to farm or PvP or also raid as. Let me know your thoughts.
---
My battle.net doesn't have it. Been looking to find a way to download it in prep but can't find anything.
---
How is it even a gamebreaking experience? If it was that - it would certainly be against TOS and EULA. 
---
It is pretty much the same as coming across a 5 man Group of different Players. Just that a multiboxer is weaker.
---
People don't run around crying that grouping is a gamebreaking experience either.
---
All multiboxers I have met so far (which isn't a lot tbh xD) didn't even want to pvp. They liked the PVE challenged they could give themselfs. The theorycrafting etc. - People just start Q.Qing so fast nowadays because what they think is what everyone should think and they have a right to have it removed because they are such precious People...
---
Okay, I can't freaking wait for classic!  Question:  do I go ahead and install the classic app now in the Blizzard launcher to reserve names, or is that done on a website?
---
No one knows
---
Right?! I had no idea, now the date is saved
---
We are not even sure if there will be RP pvp
---

Login and put in Thex.
---
Priest/shaman or dps base class again? Looking for some input as i played a rogue starting in vanilla then warrior end game. Want to play a more support role i think, only issue i never played a priest past 42. Also thinking of going horde as went ally with IRL friends. Just want to have a better time looking for groups and playing instead of being 1 of 100 rogues LFG or other dps.
---
Guess who is not gonna be named Thex
---
My wife watches this on the TV with surround sound at least twice a week. Not that I'm complaining, but I don't think I could forget this video for the next few lifetimes.
---
I already give up with that name
---
&gt;Loot distribution has to be agreed on beforehand, so nobody gets "pissed off".
---
So the tank quits before you even raid?
---
&gt;  so I think it'd be okay to be an exception to the otherwise sensible loot 
---
WHY!??!?!?!?! THERE IS NO GOOD REASON TO GIVE IT TO ANYONE BUT THE TANK!!!!!! The Rogue can't even use the damn thing in the raid without pulling aggro!
---
Trollgodx
---
Huh. I wonder how that calculation happens. demoshout is -196 AP, so basically -14 DPS. By what logic is that reducing dmg by over 20% from 3.5k to 2.8k? Those mob mechanics are really weird.
---
Wait... did they actually give this as the specific time? I thought it was 08/13 (unknown time).
---
Wrong; that many means she a hella supportive all in wife and she’s making sure there’s no doubt
---
One of my buddies is coming out to visit me for the whole first week so we are having a week long lan, two of the other members in my 5 man goon squad are also doing a lan.
---
Damn - that I will take too! I will just take everything that - when spoken - sounds like Thex/Thexx/Theks/Theccs/Thexs :3
---

---
I can tell you from experience that you won’t be riding a saber for a long time. In the Beta, I only reached 3,715/21,000 exalted with Darnassus by level 40, despite completing nearly every single Darnassus quest as well as most Alliance quests that gave spillover Darnassus rep. After Desolace and Feralas quests, you’d have to supplement with Morrowgrain/Un’Goro Soil turn-ins at level 47 and/or Runecloth turn-ins at level 50 to finally achieve exalted.

LAN prepared for the weekend after launch, Friday to Sunday.
---
3 of my friends that we all played WoW until a bit after RotLK released, we never came back to it because the game feels very outlandish to us right now , a total turn off.
---
Hopefully we can recapture that feeling that made us play till we dropped when the game first came out.
---
our party will probably be dwarf rogue, warrior, paladin with NE Druid and 5th player still undecided between priest and mage.
---
watching youtube guides till then and going to follow Joanna's leveling guide loosely , that's our big plan with lot's of coffee and BBQ in our new place we just bought outside Montreal, we will have been moved in for about 10 days, hopefully the internet installs quickly :)
---
Sounds like the kind of thing that causes stress to the point where it manifest all over your body. Like muscle spasms in the back that cause a blockage around your spine.
---
Which, in turn, would prevent you from getting up. It's pretty nasty if you ask me. Usually takes at least a week to get over it too.

You're going to roll a mage/druid, get to level 30/40/50 and get face-rolled by a mage/druid and then re-roll!
---
:) I'm stuck on Troll Shaman/UD Mage right now
---
And where would one get that magical tabard I've never heard of before?
---
Mages get pretty good 1 ups over other classes in classic as they have water/portals and sheep is awesome for 5 mans. I played vanilla from retail until tbc. Druids i don't even remember them doing much but heals same with pallys. They might have been doing more later but i never got either one pass 30.
---
I wonder how many marriages will end over classic wow. 
---
I had two girlfriends dump me because of the game and probably more decide not to date me strictly because of it. I struggled with "addiction" to the game and my wife knows it. Even if I was responsible with my time, I don't think she would ever be ok with me playing.

PVP is the best. RP just stands for Role Playing so People usually have Names that are more relatable to the lore of the game or other things.
---
Also some like to actually role Play and slow walk and have "fun bed time" and stuff xD
---
Usually there is more Events on RP realms too - Player organised Events like City raids and stuff. 
---
RP-PVP may not even be a Thing in classic though. It is still not 100% set in Stone what Servers we will get, how many, what names etc.
---
In theory, you could reach the gold cap of 214k in less than 6 months, given a healthy economy, a solid population (more than Vanilla cap) and a very solid raiding population (at least 20 serious raiding guilds on your faction).
---
But one of those conditions will likely not exist, which will probably push the time to reach gold cap to 1 year or more.
---
Playing the AH in Vanilla is very different than playing the AH in the other expansions. The profit marks are much lower in Vanilla. You could still make more than and AoE mage farming, but not by much, and that if you are really good at trading.
---
I realistically don't see anyone making over 1,000g/day profit in Vanilla, every day, for 6 months straight, even in perfect conditions. And even if someone manage it, they will still be at 180k, 34k short of cap.
---
Controlling a resource market in Vanilla, given the capped, low population, no cross-servers, will be close to impossible, and will be probably end up with a loss, instead profit. I know that, because AH was my "main" game in WoW, since Vanilla. The moment AH was linked with other realms, my profits grew...well, let's say that exponentially is not even begin to describe it. I reached gold cap at the beginning of TBC, ending with over 800k gold in cash and mats worth another 300k. At the end of Wrath, I had over 3 million gold in cash, and over 1 million in mats.
---
By the end of WoD, I made well over 70 million gold with AH exclusively.
---
Vanilla much, much harder for AH gold making. I still made a fuckton of gold, but compared with the expansions after, it was very different. And cornering a resource market always ended up with very low profits.
---
I can safely say that if I will want to focus again on AH, in Classic, after a period of time to readjust realm economy, population, raider population, farmers, sellers, professions, phase duration, Classic popularity, etc. (about 2 months) I can reach the gold cap in around 8, maybe 9 months.
---
Maybe some people could do it closer to 6 months or earlier, hence, my starting phrase was that in theory, you could reach the gold cap in less than 6 months.
---
nah there's no other place that is as retarded as reddit

I haven't laughed at many of these humor posts but I lost it when the Stayin Alive came on. Great work
---
It states in the title that it's a census, and in the description that you're answering the question about your "first/main character".
---
You bring 2 hunters so you dont waste their tier sets and for tranq shot. You have some hunters in the raid anyway, let them be useful atleast. 
---
In theory you could raid with 30 fury warriors, they deal most damage, but have fun gearing 30 of them.
---
Because a group of 5 players fucking you has 5 players involved. A group of 1 player fucking you has 1 player involved. How can you see that it's a lot easier to grief people if you as 1 person has the power of 5, or even 40 players. One person alone can pay his way to destroy an entire capital city if he wanted to. 
---
Why is not against tos? Because blizzard makes fat money off multiboxers of course..

why are you like this

I only remember the first High Warlord (I think) on Thunderlord - Norwood, the Tauren Warrior.
---
I'm planning to roll ally hunter as an alt mostly for PvP. Am I gimping myself going nelf over dwarf with their racials? I've never been a fan of the dwarf or gnome aesthetic.
---
Do you have something against my mighty shaman Țħěᶍ?
---
I think class distribution will be a lot more even then we think. But warriors will undoubtedly be the #1. It seems like rogue is your best option. If you don’t like the play style of casters, it’s only a matter of time before you reroll
---
You're dreaming.
---
Yeah 3 dps is going to be tough to get a group for dungeons for sure. Plate and 2h for leveling is also a perk, well until I take herods  shoulders, might be sleeping on the couch that night...

Me too! 😉
---
I find resto to be a lot more agressive/offensive in BGs but I never really got the hang of priests.
---
Priests destroy 5 man content for heals, it's a joke most of the time if you have a decent team.
---
Personally I like the extra utility of the shaman and lore stuff. Horde Holy priests never really made sense to me, shadow priests where always amazing in BGs though.

I mean yes, but life as a fury warrior isn't that great outside of raid dps. You'll see a lot of arms warriors doing middling dps in casual raiding guilds, I think.
---
I agree. I love the whole Tauren and mulgore theme so much.
---
 I got WoW again for classic (played vanilla-Cata). The only thing I’ve done in retail is get my tauren heritage armour and sit in mulgore admiring the rolling plains and towering mesas while enjoying the soft pan pipes play in the background. I love it
---
1) Hunter - Has good performance early in the raid releases and having a reasonable geared hunter allows for a lot of easy farming for mats for the alts. If it gets main replaced not a massive deal.
---
2) Druid / Shaman - Versatile, good to level, can do whatever is needed on the server at the time, better itemization as phases are released. Having a healer opens doors for alt runs with other characters.
---
3) Warlock - Latter in the release schedule when you get to this, where locks perform better. 
---
4) The one not picked at 2 - Twink elemental shamans are great fun, flag carrier druids are great fun.
---
It's a genius ploy, really: Get everyone to try and reserve some variant of Thex instead of what they actually wanted to reserve, and be free to actually get the names you were going for anyway.
---
staysafe tested it and didnt work
---
I played alliance on SH from early vanilla days. I initially started to raid with "Origo", but switched early to "The Nobles", raiding through MC, BWL, AQ40 (I don't think we ever killed Cthun) and a few Naxx bosses (I mainly remeber pathwerk which we killed on our first day).
---
In TBC I did some raids but can't remember the guild names, mainly focusing on arena PvP.

&gt; most of your BIS are crafted
---
Then you list two items. Granted two crafted items as bis is pretty insane, but it's not most. :D
---
I’ve found in the past that sometimes the monetary reward of money does not always our way the benefits of a quality, respectful employer. However 38% is a huge increase... it’s like comparing a titanforged item to a lower level one with a socket. Try running a Sim on your employer lol
---
Or just level normally and turn in some cloth at 60.
---
I am glad that there are so many countdown timers out there until my vacation feelsgoodman😁
---
it is almost like some people enjoy different aspects of the game
---
On the next rendition, I'll change it to something along those lines. Thanks for the recommendation!
---
Gatekeeping at its finest. It's been worse than ever with Classic.
---
"Asking your partner to play" is so cringy.  Between WoW and /r/gamingsuggestions I just see people constantly asking how to get their wives/gfs into games.  Just because they're your significant other, doesn't mean you have to share the same exact hobbies.
---
Also, if they aren't respectful of your hobbies (like not wanting you to play WoW) then they just straight up don't care about you or what you want.  Getting them to try it out one day for 15 minutes isn't going to change that.
---
Oh that's exactly what it is. But I legitimize it by saying I can experience the hype of a release and all the planning without actually playing the game.
---
&gt; It isnt 2 weeks time irl
---
The question asks in **real** time, or irl (in **real** life) time
---
Not taking Monday off because it doesn't even release until 6PM EST so I'll be home an hour before that anyhow.  Taking the rest of the week off though, the Monday for Labor Day I have off anyhow, and we're working 4 10's so we're just going to work Wed-Fri that week.
---
All in all Tuesday to Tuesday for a solid 8 days off using 3 vacation days.  Really nice having a flexible 4 10's schedule right now.
---
HR is not your friend.

That has to be the worst advice for launch I've seen on this website, and I've seen a few.

Hunter's rotation is engaging, you need to watch your autoshot timer at all time and weave your Aimed shot and Multi shot between your autoshots, when both come off cooldown at the same time you need to prioritize your Aimed shot unless the boss will die before you can finish the cast. Rapid fire and Imp AotH procs will will make your timer and Aimed Shot casts faster. You need to use your FD for threat (watch resists) and for trinket swaps. You need to position well and try to get progressively closer to the boss to squeeze that last one autoshot (travel time) so move between autos when not casting something. Melee weaving currently isn't in the game and we're not sure it will be. You also have to manage your pet, although wolves and wind serpents are easier to manage than cats. And mana with pots and runes.
---
You also have to take care of tranq shot, sometimes kiting, sometimes pulling. It's a good choice if you want something engaging with a lot of micromanagement. If you want a high apm class i'd say fury warrior but before raid gear and hit cap for rage generation, warrior feels quite slow.
---

I'm assuming you were reallllllly young when it came out then. I'm talking actual adults.
---
haha, most likely him with his concern about it :D
---
This poor guy:  Super excited for the game (me too buddy) and thought man I want to get in on this community. I know, maybe if I share my name they will share theirs and I can look for some of them in game and we can level up together...  
---
Reddit: LOL OP is not getting that name!
---
It doesn't involve any real money or value outside the game. It involves trading gold on both servers (which then can be used to buy playtime).
---
So in that sense it shouldn't be against rules. I want it to be against rules though. Kinda bad if people are allowed to buy gold and then do gold dkp raids and buy their gear and also use their bough gold to buy way more consumables for pvp than any normal player would use.
---
still one of the best wow animations out there
---
Will be rolling a troll priest named Thex! Finally made my decision!
---
Yeah.
---
It sounds like you are going to fall ill those days due to the stress of this event.
---
I recognize some of those names myself and I'm sure my parents do too. My parents had been with that guild for longer than WoW. Dad told me the guild was all the way from Ashrons call 1 and it stayed together into AC2 then went to wow. Guild master in AC1 was named Chet aka Zorn. I think my mother even keeps on touch with a couple of people that used to play.  I think Zorn eventually dropped GM and left and created Z force.
---
"Stack all your cooldowns and make them line up with heroism" is basically the only dps advice anyone really needs on retail.
---
&gt; because they think we would all go play retail and buy tokens and cash shop mounts
---
Seems like you're leaning toward the melee's. If you're really leveling with a partner I hear warriors are great, so out of the three there it seems like your best bet if you have heals.
---
Bank Alt Names Thex, Thecks, and Tchecks are high demand. But yes, Active sub required.
---
A guy started a thread asking about name reservations. He said he wanted to reserve his shaman name (Thex).
---
Hahaha LEGO &amp; IKEA.. så jävla ikoniskt.
---
What’s the time commitment like on a rogue vs warrior? I’m assuming warriors have to try a lot damn harder to farm consumables and get geared or am I wrong?
---
Don't you just hate it when you get hit with one of those mysterious summer flus around august 26th and have to call in sick for a month?

It kind of makes sense.  If he works in a job where you 100% need to have people there then people will be upset if he gives others off and not themselves.  
---
If you have 10 people working and need minimum 5 people to keep the line moving and all 10 people request off, who do you give permission to?  This manager found it easier to just deny all requests in order to keep it fair than give a few people the privilege and tell the others they're out of luck.
---
I thought these posts weren't allowed

In the last week I decided to roll my planned classic character in retail. The animations look and feel so much more satisfying.

I'm comparing to private servers so maybe real classic will feel a bit better.

---
There is no rp-pvp servers so the choice is now easier
---
Playing with Nordic people is nice, but I really don't want to speak/write in Norwegian/Swedish to people.
---
Its mostly for social reasons and it increases the chances of bumping into friends irl and having a certain cultural inside joke type of thing.
---
Its not exclusive at all however since nordics very often prefer english over local languages in gaming. So dont worry.

Can’t it be both?

The leveling will be on and off since our schedules might not always align/he might want to get ahead. If that happens and I have to grind my way from 30-60 as a warrior I have a feeling I’d want to reroll. The main aspects I like about warrior is the ability to tank 5 mans up to 60 and use almost every weapon, for rogues I love the ability to stealth which would be fun rolling w a feral druid. Just not sure which one outweighs the other.
---
I think they should just make both versions available. It's cosmetics. Just turn on what floats your boat.
---
You know what?  Sure, they will have rp pvp servers on launch just for you honey.  I’ll be sure to follow your reddit username and I’ll drop you a DM when they open with rp pvp servers.  You’re so smart how did anyone miss this. Lol you’re so adorable!!
---
Yeah? seems like you are reaching. There has been no info suggesting any sort of population cap increase. Infrastructure is not even the issue, the game was designed for a certain number of people, over that number it breaks. Until you come in here with proof of anyone who matters saying they are going to increase the concurrent population cap there is no reason to assume it is going to happen.
---
&gt; when a lot of people want the same time off
---
Seeing as this is labor day week, I'm leaning heavily toward this.  A lot of people request off, they need a minimum amount of people to keep things moving, so it's just easier to deny everyone's requests rather than giving a few, select people the privilege.
---
3D Intern Dev sounds like a computer generated title.
---
For me it’s more like “I can’t believe you have a date saved for a video game, but I know how much you like them so you do you”
---
I plan to go dwarf but mainly because I am nostalgic and I love the lore of a bearded dwarf fighting off his foes with a bear and shotgun. I debated NE for awhile because the appeal of stealthing with a cat pet just seems really awesome and will provide you with some cool ambush scenarios that other hunters wont be able to do. Go with NE if you want, it wont really matter much in the end.
---
This. So much this.

True, true

Not to that extreme, but all long braids/ponytails do it.

It’s much more prevalent in the Alliance races.

Hello Thex, I am Thex.
---
&gt; As a Dane I suck at understanding Swedish/Finnish/Norwegian (and you properly find it hard to decipher what I say as well)
---
Really? I find that norwegian/swedish/danish is so similar I can easily read/listen to a speaker of any of the 3 languages and have a fairly good idea what they're saying. 
---
Of course I don't understand every word but there are so many words that are almost identical between the 3 so you ought to be able to gather a general idea.
---
1000iq prediction
---
Noted about the quests, ty!
---
One last question - Do quests in the starting zone (Shadowglen) provide any rep? or is it first the quests outside the starting zone which gives rep to Darnassus?
---
It's a busy time of the year.  Why not just request 3 days off the week after launch?
---
Why is it that picking a class for classic has me so excited, yet picking a class in retail I hardly even thought about it?
---
I’ve been reading all these guides getting excited for Aug 27, it just feels so different from retail. I never really had much attachment to my new characters, I just wanted to multi-class in pvp. 
---
I think it’s also clear that each character feels really different. They all have a very unique role and I think that helps keep it interesting for me. It sure feels a lot more like a fantasy game.
---
Graphics are subjective too. Sure there's more detail etc. in retail but it's different style. I like the classic style, I wouldn't mind it being physically improved, but only if it has the same style.
---
Shaman feels more durable and powerful in PvP with more utility and durability, whereas a holy priest in PvP feels pretty squishy and pretty impossible without peels, sans AV. Fort buff will destroy a ton of your mana, every time you rez if you buff up you'll be pretty much OOM.  They can pump out a lot of healing though if you can create space and get heals, best partner is a mage hands down not even close. Mage peels the best, CCs the best, bursts well, and can give you water which is AMAZING because you will drink A LOT. Mind Control is very situational, but it's pretty much awesome when you get to use it.
---
PvE, nothing feels better for healing than a priest. You have a huge toolkit and it's more than FOL spamming in that you have big heals, small heals, HoT, PWS, and if you get aggro you can Fade. Honestly the most fun healing I've ever had of any of the healing classes and you're not the insane mana efficiency of a paladin spamming FOL, but you're better than druids and certainly shaman with respect to mana.
---
Shaman is interesting. They have a pretty kickass AoE heal, but lack mana efficiency. They also have a huge toolkit, it's just a tradeoff difference. Totems can be annoying to deal with positioning, but Windfury is amazing for everything PvE and PvP, and you have cleansing totem, mana totem, heal totem...you get the idea.
---
If it's really a 50/50 balance of PvP and PvE, my opinion is Shaman is so much better in PvP I'd go that route. However, if you weight PvE higher I'd go with priest and find a mage to PvP with and you'll be fine there too.
---
Yeah, many of them were togheter since AC, I remember that. The avg age of the guild was probably like 30 or something. Gchat policy was to be polite, no cursing and such. All in all, wonderful people.
---
The leader was (still is?) A doctor in RL, if I recall. The lady that I met in Open beta, who brought me to Ventrilo server and the guild was Army/Navy nurse. 
---
Aww, this brings so much nostalgia back xD
---
Someone didn't listen to the podcast.
---
I don’t agree with that though. 
---
The classic community are so passionate that I don’t see them voting ‘Yes’ for an option like retail LFG/phasing/war mode etc. 
---
Blizzard should make the big decisions and the community should vote on the specifics for example: Blizz could say ‘TBC is being launched January 2021’ then poll the specifics like, ‘Should flying mounts be included in this release’, ‘Should the level cap be increased to 70’, ‘Should we introduce the badge system for gearing’. The majority of this community knows what it wants (sometimes a bit too aggressively) and I believe by handing decisions to the community the game will improve just like OSRS did. OSRS got better with each patch because the community knew what was good for the game and what was bad. 
---
The only places I see that being a problem is if they polled for more races being added again. Races shouldn’t be voted they should just be added over time.
---
That's weird, all of the dozens of "what faction are you going to play" poll threads over the past couple years have shown an almost perfect split.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule
---
In the “character creation” section they say they’ll have realm names available.
---
Okay cool, so is Medivh in Classic I assume? I will be playing alliance so I do prefer a series focused around them
---
All Blizzard releases are 00:00 CET, and have always been. Every expansion since 2007.
---
I’m in EU and had zero problems on Legion and BFA Launch nights. Like, no lags at all, no disconnects, no bugs and a very reasonable queue to log in.
---
Thank you. I will be playing alliance, do you have any other suggestions?
---
I woudlnt worry about it because Nordics almost only talk their own language to eachother but generally prefers english in games etc.
---
Lmao we’re gonna need a bigger board
---
It's going to be absolutely fine.  Launches were fine even back in WotLK.  The servers were just a bit laggy until you got out of the immediate starting area.
---
With all of what we saw on the stress tests, I'm really wondering how people can think otherwise.  Have you even been around for a recent retail launch?
---
Thank you very much for this
---
Thexymuhfugah
---
I honestly don't think that multiboxers make such a big difference in Money.
---
Seeing how many People are literally building a salt mine in this reddit because of them - there must be thousands that stopped playing due to that. Hence they actually probably loose Money :p
---
Well see that is where I make a line as well though. 40 People as one Person is a bit over the top. But 5 is totally fine... Honestly why would someone be against that? So easy to Counter too...
---
It is just as easy to grief People when you are 5 chars as 5 persons as it is for 1 Person with 5 chars. 
---
There is literally no difference except for the fact that it Needs less Manpower. Which shouldn't make a difference because in game it is still 5v1 no matter which way you put it
---
Indalamar. In the time when everyone said Warrior was garbage and bad and needed tons of buffs to be sueful, Indalamar posted a video of himself just massacring elites 1 after another, 1 or 2 shotting them and moving on. He proved that warriors weren't garbage, people just needed to gear and spec properly.
---
His legend was so great that soon after warrior was lol nerfed, and Blizzard gave him a job as an itemization designer and balancer. You can still see things named after him in 2 quests and 2 items bearing the name "Ramaladni." Also Diablo's Ramaladni's gift.
---
I also take this as a PSA for Blood Elves being added after the OG Vanilla patch cycle is over, please and thank you.
---
So this is like a paid computer cafe type deal? Just out of curiosity, what do you charge per hour / day or do you have "unlimited use" passes and such? Is there a restuarant there?
---
Where and how do you reserve a name?
---
Night elf for PvP is amazing. Grab a cat and get prowl and create a macro for Shadow Meld + prowl. You will love that. You can even start eating and drinking then hit the macro and stay stealthed.

"Welcome back, kids! Today we are doing math and economy. Take out pen and paper and write down the following: Timmy farms 10 gold per hour, which he sells online for 1$. How many hours of detention does Timmy need to farm enough dollars to pay his 15$ subscription?"

---
Will this be a global release, like BfA, or will EU get access one day later ?
---
I can see how wow and two girlfriends would take a lot of your time.
---
Nope.  I'm just commenting about people that ask their partners to play video games.
---
Haha some guy started a thread where he was asking what people's names are going to be and he said he'll be "Thex the Shaman" 
---
Since then there have been several threads regarding similar Topics and everyone just memes and says they will be Thex. Actually quite hilarious. I think you can call yourself lucky if you manage to get Thex reserved :D
---
I always choose my old names / accountnames with the things that are currently around me.
---
At one point I had Dittmeyer Valensina , a brand name for orange juice . So I think I am either going to name my first character Dittmeyer like in the old times or when I feel like playing a Troll Hunter , Jita. Just because it sounds cool and somewhat trollish :p
---
Sadly I cant choose Harvestwagon . Everyone thinks I am somewhat smart for taking that name because it resembles an old I think english painting called "The Harvest Wagon" . And I always feel embarassed when I have to reveal I meant that undead wagon from Warcraft 3. Cough.
---
Okay, as a Dane that does sound terrible.
---
Isn’t Classic based off of the Legion version of the game? I don’t think it will have private server graphics, which are from the actual vanilla version
---
Tack så mycket. Will check it out. If i cant find one now ill find one once Classic launches on the server!
---
Polymorph is great, but I have so many memories of hunters in dungeons who would always attack my poly-morphed target straight away. The concept of CC was lost on them it seemed.
---
dude the pov is clicking half his abilities, including rupture. This isn't high tier either way. Yes people will be better at the game given its 14 years old at this point.
---
She is denying all vacation from now until October 1
---
Shadowglen quests give Darnassus rep, along with all other quests in Teldrassil/Darnassus, but none of them (except for Tumors) give spillover rep for any of the other factions.
---
Better graphics, same aesthetic.
---
Sadly I now remember reading this, I just forgot where it was at and couldn't remember if it was speculation or official. Thanks
---
Oh shit I totally forgot about this. In retail I just say fuck it and go with the default experience knowing I can change it later.
---
Now I am gonna spend like an hour in the character creator, goddamnit. Maybe I wont get the names I want.
---
#nochanges
---
Im gonna dust off mt old toaster for the full vanilla experience.
---
I just realized I haven’t seen u/shittymorph in a very long time
---
My take on support classes is that they're really fun to play if you like that role, but only if you're 100% sure you have people to group with. Otherwise, you will regret it if you end up solo a lot. If you have ANY doubt in your mind that you'll get stuck solo a lot, then go with a base DPS class.
---
Only female player I recall so specifically was named Day I think, my mother still keeps in contact with her. Both my parents are military retired so makes sense why they loved it there and got along with people. They were both officers in the Guild. I think once TBC came out parents rolled troll priests together one named Bonnie and one Named Klyde lol. I remember being young and they'd always play. They stopped after WoTLK but I think Z force cleared into ICC. Not sure of the guild is still around though. 
---
I know I'm playing when classic releases and I know a couple will probably go back to playing too. Parents haven't confirmed nor denied lmao. 
---
I was homeschooled back then and in the evenings I'd literally watch them raid MC. 
---
I logged onto my mother's warrior awhile back. She was level 62 i think. Stopped playing her warrior after vanilla and mained her priest Bonnie. I think she evening had a TF binding just sitting in her bags. Was surreal.
---
This shit is cringe
---
are you 14 years old by chance?
---
Because retail has three classes, DPS/Tank/Heal with a tiny bit a flavor from each individual 'class'. Everyone has CC, almost everyone has interrupts, everyone can sustain etc etc etc, they pretty much watered down the classes so anybody could use them without trying too hard.
---
Classic has a huge difference between classes/playstyles and all of those extra little details.
---
The most basic rotation in Classic would be the most complicated rotation in Retail. That's why class choice feels so important/meaningful.
---
I could 100% do this at my place. 100mb internet, single guy that doesn't decorate, 2 bedrooms with plenty of extra room in living / dining area...
---
Except I don't know anyone that plays and lives near me IRL. Just missing that one key component - friends.
---
Usually when it comes to wow at least, a mafia is a group of people who have a monopoly on a certain resource.
---
You might have heard of "devilsaur mafia"? Basically the big elite dinos in Un'goro are skinnable and they drop a really rare LW reagent that is used for some crazy good gear at max level.
---
If a group of people manage to have Un'goro on lock down they can control how much devilsaur leather is in AH at all times and so they themselves can set the price of the gear. So they can for example put up devilsaur gear for like a 500% markup just because nobody else has any devilsaur leather.
---
Most often this is a collaboration between some horde and some alli guild so that the horde guild will kill any allis trying to skin devilsaur and the alli will kill any horde trying to skin.
---
The x-faction collaboration is what makes it a mafia.
---
I missed that.  That's just stupid.
---
Mage is the best class in the game. Sounds like you answered your own question. Maximize your time and gold making abilities and go with the Mage IMO.
---
And even then you still have a sizeable amount of counters.
---
Can someone give me some pros/cons for shaman vs hunter, or just sell me on either class. 
---
I will be able to play frequently but not for massive stretches and my focus is on battlegrounds but I still hold a good interest in the raiding side of things, will probably be in an average guild.
---
Thanks.
---
What would your guilds stance be on a raiding Elemental Shaman? Experienced raider looking to meme spec it up bringing healing set to be able to flex as a hybrid where needed, and offer terrible sustained but amazing burst DPS elsewhere and some good ole totem support. Would someone like this find a spot in your guild's raids and be able to compete with mages and the like on gear?
---
can somebody please tell me how i go about reserving my name? please.
---
They are pretty close tho. You're paying a sub for both. They haven't specifically addressed this issue yet.
---
That might be you, but i doubt that would be majority of people. There needs to be some kind of carrot on the stick.
---
Let me ask you then why they would implement layering at all if there was no increased population per server? #NoChanges right?
---
I’m really struggling with whether or not to play on a PvP server. The idea of world PVP is fun, but being camped and ganked constantly? Ugh. I think it would just be tedious after awhile. 
---
I’ve always played pve in the past. I’m probably going to again.
---
It because once you pick a class it is a huge time commitment. In retail you can reroll and have a toon at max level in a matter of days with pretty decent gear. 
---
Just getting to 60 in classic is a feat on its own, much less getting gear. That will take a ton of time. You are right though, each class is unique in its own way and they all have their pros and cons. I cant wait!
---
Fate will definitely be already taken.
---
You should play mage.
---
Why get rid of gold sellers?  What happened to #nochanges?
---
Well they tried to adjust most things to it's classic state - graphic wise too.
---
I think Shadows you can Switch between old and new - as well as the water graphics you can also choose.
---
Besides that I think all should look like it used to in classic.
---
&gt; PvPing in Arathi-Basin
---
It's too bad AB doesn't come out until phase 4. It's the best BG by far. We're stuck playing WSG and AV for all of phase 3.
---
World PvP, 2nd in command w/ access to gear....rogue main. Make a warlock alt.
---
There’s the Ooga Gang!
---
Lovestospooge can have any colour hair as far as I'm concerned.
---
actually I think you'd be hard pressed to find many swedes online who are SJWs or white knights. A lot of them tend to be more moderate and less idealistic so they're a lot easier to reason with than swedes irl.
---
Do we know what time it will go live? Already taking time off work to play on launch, really don't wanna take any time to get my names
---
In b4 LEGO vs IKEA Race for World (second) first Kel'thuzad
---
I think the Ooga Gang were the first 3 WoW Classic Celebrities.
---
*cries in cloth*
---
Two-handed fury is BiS early on for horde because there's a general shortage of good one-handers. Once you have used Bloodthirst and Whirlwind you can spam Hamstring to fish for Windfury Totem procs with your extra rage.
---
Your stupid american dating system had me in a panic!
---
The trial was 15 years ago
---
It’ll be easier to put raids as a resto shaman, it’ll be easier to farm and PvP as a hunter. Ele sham wrecks face in duels, too.
---
I’m actually in the same spot. Probably will have both with shaman as alt.
---
First, because they were in Vanilla, and secondly, because faction imbalance was horrendous on most realms, with huge ass waiting times on one faction.
---
You can't have proper BGs in Vanilla w/o cross-realm BG.
---
Awwww shit it's all over boys. Pack up shop.
---
exactly.
---
Kluas has been mine since vanilla because of the series of unfortunate events books. I know his name is spelled differently.
---
Wow, that blew away my expections.
---
Give it a toggle, because I’d love to see this but there’s no way you’d ever get it past the no-changes crowd.
---
Ming, Kungen, Maydie, Pat.
---
where can I do the reservation? do i need an already active subscription for that?
---
Or the marketing team did an analysis that told them they are already reaching most of their target demographic via twitch, reddit, youtube, and other forms of social media and that running a million dollar ad campaign on TV isn't worth it.
---
In before the anecdotal, "yeah, but my best friend's brother's fiance's uncle that hasn't played video games since vanilla didn't know classic is coming out."
---
More like scandis pretend to hate eachother but in reality they see eachother as brothers.
---
You log into the Classic client at the designated time, choose troll shaman, randomize appearance, name it Thex, and you're g2g.
---
Indalamar is a name that everyone should recognize atleast. Nurfed also got the only legendary necklace in the game IIRC on their main tank.
---
Warriors is a lot higher. Being a top warrior in any spec is a full time job
---
Got the same job and can also choose when to come/leave as long as I do my hours. I won't get off time for taking the cat to the vet though
---
I wrote an extensive answer to this above. I'll distill it down to this: PvP healing is much nicer on a shaman than a priest except in AV. PvE healing, priest is #1 hands down in terms of capabilities and fun.  If you weight PvP 50% importance w/ 50% PvE then I  would go shaman, if it's more like 25/75 then go priest and find a mage to group with because you will need water and peels.
---
Layering is a function to make more, vanilla population, layers to deal with day one numbers that will go away. It is the same as if they made server clusters where names were unique with the plan of merging the servers together when numbers dropped. It's not an ideal solution, but it is a pretty good one. You shouldn't act like that somehow makes a megaserver though, because they are separate, population capped, instances that will all be merged into one, vanilla capped server by phase 2.
---
20...
---
MadSeason loves Classic. So his goal is to make a guide for each Classic dungeon. More of a passion project than a necessity.
---
dong
---
Hehe yes they are quite mutually exclusive =P
---
Going to be making a gnome mage called Thex
---
It's the same as going 1H fury... but 2H instead. There isn't much that's different besides Gear since you don't need nearly as much Hit%. Shaman are still your best friend either way. 2H Fury is pretty great for leveling too.
---
&gt;Seeing how many People are literally building a salt mine in this reddit because of them - there must be thousands that stopped playing due to that
---
No. I don't think anyone has stopped playing because of multiboxers, they are terribly human trash but they are by no means enough to make someone quit playing the game. Complaining about it being possible and unjust is not the same as quitting the game.
---
&gt;It is just as easy to grief People when you are 5 chars as 5 persons as it is for 1 Person with 5 chars. There is literally no difference except for the fact that it Needs less Manpower.
---
And that manpower is a MASSIVE difference. When classic comes out try see if you can recruit 4 people to come help you corpsecamp some person you don't like for 5 hours. See how that goes.
---
Nope
---
Regular blessing is 5 minutes, greater blessings 15, but they cost a reagent
---
What are the advantages of joining this server if you are not nordic? Im dutch and have dutch friends who play and we would love to join if this environment will be a lot less toxic and more fun!
---
Classic isn’t supposed to be balanced.  Constant tweaking is necessary in retail because balance is the goal.  In Classic, you know what you’re getting on day one, and you know what it will be on day one thousand.
---
Prot warrior
---
CC is lost, but feel like people know more now about CC then ever. The information of classic wow and people spreading what they know about the game is a huge difference from what it once was.Granted still will be a issue, hunter-traps rogue-sap and mage -poly will always have problems somehow.
---
Yeah and stat bonuses on boots are pretty minimal, maybe 10 or 12 stat points by the time you get to level 40?  If you have something with great stats you can always swap into it when you're fighting a tough monster or in an instance or something =P
---
This might be the best answer
---
&gt; and there's plenty of people ~~who have the ability to put in 16h/day.~~
---
Who'll account trade just like they did in vanilla
---
The vanilla "ranking" system is a joke
---
Same.  I still listen to this song, as well as others.
---
&gt; Will the PvP community be able to maintain an unofficial honor cap that everyone sticks to in order to reduce the hours required to keep up, like on pservers?
---
I think yes, but there will be even more people trying to break brackets.
---
the audio works but the video doesnt, anybody got a youtube link?
---
Welcome to WoW!
---
I am planning leveling as 2hand anyway(start farming pre raid bis around 56). And I might as well going in 2 hand fury raid spec(abusing WF).  It will allow me to lower hit cap requirements (8/9) and less gear competition (no need to compete with DW warrior or rogue) while doing good boss damage and awesome aoe damage.  But I just not able to find a detailed guide explaining why take which talent for certain build and gear progression for this spec(BIS for each phase, most guide only show for DW bis).  And 2 big ass weapon looks cool.  Will probably switch to DW at the end of Phase 2 or mid phase 3 when everyone else got their needed DW gears.  JUST want a good two handed furry warrior pve/raiding guide, please !!!
---
Retail leveling is so garbage too. I like the level scaling changes but I skipped out on some expansions so I can't fly in WoD and it's super annoying. They need to do something with the old pathfinders after new expansions come out (easiest fix it to make path 1 flying and path 2 the mount for people who really want to grind it out).
---
Druid is a lot of fun. You can also tank w/ some effort. If you have ANY reservations WHATSOEVER about not being able to burst people down in PvP, then avoid that class. If you're cool with running away 95% of the time or going REALLY try-hard and have a massive amount of skill playing a druid, then you can probably make it work. It's a lot of effort though.
---
You mean like they did on retail? How did that work out?
---
Who the fuck put FRESH up there without talking to any of us?
---
Damn, i work that day. Do you need an active sub to get i to that? Was planning on resubbing once classic released
---
shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
You didn't know about the horse armor DLC in Oblivion? 
---
Not to be facetious here, but that's been the go-to-example for pointless microtransactions for about 13 years now.
---
haha
---
Absolutely agree. I have much more expensive hobbies and WoW would likely save me time and money in the long run. But marriage is a bit different for me than a girlfriend. And WoW would only be cutting into my fun hobbies. Physical activity, outdoors, face time with family and old friends would all be cut down by any significant gaming.
---
 I used to be apathetic about the animations, but after logging into retail recently on the three day trial I realized that I absolutely loathe them. Too bouncy and cartoony, reminded me of a Disney movie.
---
Oxhorn?
---
Gluten intolerant vegan horde players who just started CrossFit with their service Chihuahua.
---
well that's not true since i saw quin69 delete his character and restore it on the beta.
---
I'm in EU and I have the drop-down, so I dunno if that's it.
---
The servers will be fine. The login servers will be broken.
---
Well my issue with going base dps or even a warrior, everyone will be one. Classic will be a group base game, when i played vanilla you half to group up for dungeons/raids/pvp. Vanilla it self did promote to be more friendly then what wow is currently. Just know i wont have free time as i did in those days to work on a dps class, just to gear up will be longer i feel.
---
If you are serious about having struggled with addiction, refer to step 1 of the 12 step program to see why this is a bad idea.
---
Yeah that’s what I figured. I liked the idea of wearing plate and using a two handed but if the time investment is too substantial I’m gonna have to pass.
---
I think there will be official spanish servers so that shouldn't be a problem.
---
Dickhard
---
Hunter, as it will shine in pvp with skill and less gear reliance, and if you arent interested in healing/respec costs shaman isn't the better bet. Hunters can pvp in a pve spec, shaman don't have that luxury.
---
Me and my friends that played wow classic when we were 14 years old all took a day off on the Tuesday. I actually took the rest of the week off, but some of them couldn't.
---
Anyway, we're having a mini LAN on Tuesday - going to be a blast.
---
It's funny that I've lived literally twice as long now as back then.
---
My Dwarfs beard always messed up the helmet look during Vanilla as it broke the frames lol
---
Hm, am I the only one that doesn't find this funny or good?
---
It's much less dps than dial wielding, so it's less popular, so there are not many guides.
---
I promised my wife years ago that I would never play world of Warcraft again. (Her father chose the game over time with her, tons of sad stories) 
---
Since that game did hinder some of my past relationships, college, &amp; my business, I had no problem agreeing to never play the game, and had no interest in its current shit show that it is.
---
Then classic spoiled and I’ve spent so much time watching spoilers &amp; streams.  Damn.
---
I was in an airport in Vienna waiting for a delayed flight a couple weeks back, and someone linked Angwes AMA and website. It kept me entertained for well over an hour going through the hatemail etc
---
Oh I've probably heard about it and just assumed somebody was making a joke. Not keeping track of all the stupid microtransactions in games I don't play.
---
PvP blue gear is worse than pre-raid gear. There’s almost no chance of you taking that directly into Naxx.
---
This guy was huge. He made some of the best PVP [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDXXr3ad3is) and had a huge presence on the forums and his own site.
---
I think you’re right, significantly less time investment than a warrior and the gearing issue should be compensated by my rank in the guild. Thanks.
---
Yes, they put hundreds of thousands of man-hours into a project they want to fail.
---
I've used it for months, no you won't.
---
Hahaha this guy made a thread claiming that since tauren has a bigger hit box he will hit the mob sooner which is better than berserking.
---
You should have herbalism/engineering.  Raid consumes are a big deal and herbing is a great source of $
---
Ya, I'm gonna need a source on that, there's nothing I can find about concrete number sizes. Also Layering as I understand it, is based only on the server you roll your character on, as that would make no sense that your character can be randomly moved to another realm after phase 1.
---
Any luck?
---
Meandro
---
It will be all the realms. If they only did a few name reservation is pointless.
---
So how is Druid healing while leveling? 
---
I'm probably not going to be too fussed about raiding but happy to heal if I do. I'm also aware about the lack of res. But are they more than capable otherwise in 5 man dungeons while leveling up and also at 60 assuming they are wearing healing gear?
---
If a group had a choice of taking a priest, shaman/paladin and druid for healing, is the druid always going to be the last option?
---
For US, what time / time zone is reservation open?
---
Holy crap that IS a long swim
---
Sometime between now and August 13th
---
Amazingly, the “everyone” population you speak of will still be needed sans a MT.  If you’re really paranoid about being needed, then OK: roll a dwarf priest.
---
It definitely isn't uncommon. Pretty much my entire development team is taking off work for the Borderlands 3 launch on September 13, myself included. Ages range from 28 to 60.
---
I found a few graphs that state it was around 8 million just before TBC. But you can't just multiply that by 15$ since some people paid less with longer subscriptions and there were entire regions (like China) that paid way less.
---
Also 90,000,000$ wouldn't be chump change to ActiBlizz today, but there won't be that many subscribers since WoW classic will likely be a niche product while vanilla was a mainstream hit back in the day.
---
So to get back to OP's point  - I don't believe that Blizz cares so much about the user experience. They probably don't believe that Classic will make that much money so they won't spent too much on marketing.
---
PVP = player versus player
---
RP-PVP = player vs player, but also player vs player in the way where you have cybersex with girls in Goldshire that in reality are full grown men.
---
Hueheyeuewh my wife dae Love Grizzly hills? Hueeheyeueh check out what my wife did in *breaths in* grizzly HILLS heuehh
---
So we’re positive they will tell us before Aug 13th?
---
Impressive! I had 25 days on my hunter.
---
He's probably refering to section C iii that says you can't trade stuff outside of the Game(s). The problem is we can start arguing about it being the same game but we don't even have to. They put a freaking (S) in that section we would then have to argue about as well.
---
Yeah, Thex the Shaman gets the spot of first Classic celeb.
---
I am, yes. Why ? We have to reputation to be confused people ? 😂
---
&gt;celebrity's
---
*celebrities
---
Nyquil or any of the generic store brand variants.
---
Getting your other half to drink Nyquil might be a bit tricky though.
---
you should let hunters have the 2h weapons and go dual wield instead :)
---
&gt; Because that break the « RPG » part i suppose
---
Because Getpwnedlolgodxx, that has nothing to do with Twitch, is certainly not an immersion-breaking name.
---
Gluten intolerant vegan horde players who just started CrossFit with their Chihuahua service dog while also being an ironman.
---
^^^btw
---
Reserving Thex for your wife is so sweet of you!
---
If you play on a PvP server I wouldn't recommend skimping on fire ward (vs locks) and Mana shield (for melees and hunters). I wouldn't drop the Mana gems either since they can turn around a bad situation in PvP or a dungeon. Otherwise, I agree with this list. Nice job :)
---
It's already a dead meme imo, people ran that into the ground within hours.
---
I will miss using my Armageddon transmog strikes on my DK, those look devestating. Its awesome watching t his massive weapon swing around
---
Fucking PAT
---
Totally! He had that guild named after himself too so it just said Zapple twice 😂 Server was so small I definitely pugged VoAs with him. His dps was ass but he could do some insane shit in PvP
---
Shaman named Thex.
---
Say Thex again!
---
There won't be RP PvP servers, but in case you didn't know RP realms are PvE realms that encourage roleplaying in-game as well as having stricter name standards, like disallowing references to real life people or things.  
---
Hunter:  Ranged dps class good for soloing
---
Warrior:  Melee dps/tank class.  Tanks are in high demand so this will be either a blessing or a curse
---
We can hide our elms in vanilla...right?
---
I watch his videos sometimes because he just fucks people up so bad in PvP. Ass in PvE but I would take him in my PvP team in an instant.
---
Also, decurse us very cheap and only has one rank, so there is no reason not to pick it up, since it's useful in early dungeons like SFK (although not NECESSARY). Rank 1 blizzard is also good to have for those pesky rogues.
---
I think it'll be different though. Retail is the result of Blizz catering to the masses, trying to make a pure mass-appeal game that can keep 5 mil subs. Classic will probably always be a smaller project with a fanbase who cares specifically about the RPG elements of classic that have been cast aside in favor of Diablo 4.
---
I'm the same. Been taking it all in. 
---
Are you going to play or are you going to take in the hype of the release and enjoy it second hand?
---
The only way I can play is if I stick to 5 hours a week and be ok with not raiding. Maybe tank a dungeon a couple times a month. Level fishing and cooking. Stick to gathering professions. Maybe get to 60 in a year. 
---
Then I wonder if $15 a month or any time at all is even worth it to be so casual.
---
He was in a Jeopardy question, that's real famous.
---
The comments in this thread are the reddit equivalent of responding to a general chat question with "Google it".
---
Frostshock! 
---
Oh you wanted items. There's a trinket that summons a cannon that hits your enemies.
---
There's also Ramstein's lightning bolts (another trinket) that you activate to deal nature damage.
---
There was a green diamond shaped trinket from Eranikus that deald some dot.
---
No offical ETA from Blizzard yet.
---
They have said that they will be releasing the server names/types before the name reservations go live.  So some time between now and the 13th.
---
It's all at the exact same time (afternoon for US, morning in EU, midnight if you're somehow playing in the middle of the atlantic ocean on satellite internet)
---
Thex - orc shaman
---
He has videos out? Damn I’m gonna have to watch some at lunch, see if I recognize any old names from that server!! Drak’Tharon during wrath was one of my personal favorite times in wow
---
Valueing 1% crit at 3 pts seems weird. 1% crit is much a larger stat budget. I can understand you vlaueing crit lowly as a shdaow preist, but for a warlock? Your rating basically says 30 spelldmg is worth 90% crit chance. Even for a shadow priest this is quite ridiculous, wouldn't say? 
---
I mean you certainly would take guaranteed crits over 30 spelldmg, wouldn't you?
---
I'm actually going to.name my shaman Thex on every server. Please dont take this name
---
Where we are gathering the different guilds who wants to be a part of this. Its not a public one as we only want guild masters/leaders in there. So I don't know what your deal is so perhaps you should check with Asyx. 
---
Tell me if you want to be removed or if you want someone els inside the discord send me a PM.
---
I mean, TECHNICALLY, both accounts are under my name and my credit card.
---
There is a TON of communication.  That's what I'm talking about with this community acting like children.  How much do you need to get?  
---
Are you just ignoring all of the forum posts about minutia details of niche systems in the game?  Are you ignoring the gigantic interview they had literally yesterday?  Did you ignore the blizzcon panels?  What additional information do you want?
---
Perklunt/ perkluator rogue.  Had entertaining PvP videos along with grim.
---
Well, there's a demon hunter on the original box art, so go with that.
---
It's all subjective. Personally I like the vanilla animations a lot better, the WoD ones feel too... bouncy. And all the characters just look a bit too polished and pretty for my liking. I liked being able to play a big ugly orc but the new ones just look more cartoonist than I'd like.
---
Some of the spell animations are flashy and cool, but again, for me it takes away from the immersion. Having more muted spell effects (especially in early levels) feels more realistic
---
Nice try.
---
Well I can't at all disagree with you on that. Blizz is definitely approaching classic with caution. I cannot comment on how they operate but I do have faith that there is rhyme to their reason. Maybe they *are* trying to funnel new players into retail. However, there are other factors that could be at play.
---
Think of it this way: World of Wacraft: Classic is *not* a purchase project. You get it essentially for free with a subscription. So, when the project deploys, their immediate return on investment is extremely low. It's very, very possible that their marketing teams simply don't have the budget for marketing, and they won't have the budget until re-subbers [for classic] have been re-subbed for a significant amount of time. The project needs to make some cash before they can give it a good push.
---
The number of people coming back to the game (re-subs) won't make Blizzard any project profit until some time has passed. Remember that Blizzard laid off a bunch of people recently - they are trying to save money. It very easily good just be a budgeting issue.
---
3 hours on what kek.   Yeah I have some issues with the 20 point in arm(there are 2-3 talent point unsettle). 
---
3rd point in imp heroic Strike? 
---
1/2 or 2/2 for imp overpower?
---
Anger management or nah?
---
Do we ever take 1 point off the 3/5  two hand specialist to fill 1 of above ?  
---
Also I like to take 1 point to howl from 2/3 cleave. Cuz that just 25 more damage I think(bonus only) and howl can help not respec tanking/ world farm/pvp a bit I think
---
That's what (a very small subset of) ret paladins are for. Not because they're good or anything, but because they are the only enthusiastic nightfall welders.
---
Out of the loop here. Who’s Thex?
---
However if the hunter is your wife she will let you win the melee weapons as they will be of much greater use to you as a rogue and vica versa. The main leather gear you get from questing anyways if I recall correctly. (Tunic of Westfall, Triprunner Dungarees, perhaps some others). Only your tank will compete for weapons ofcourse.
---
It really is though. Its a big difference Just try both, but you'll find you don't have nearly as much rage with a 2h, and when you miss it really hurts.
---
Ion turned WoW into a gigantic equation.
---
&gt;It's too bad AB doesn't come out until phase 4. It's the best BG by far. We're stuck playing WSG and AV for all of phase 3.
---
WSG is the best by far!! I can't believe my eyes reading this :(
---
It’s gonna be interesting for sure. 
---
On one hand, one would have to hope they use available data like the current census posting (to extrapolate how many will reactivate). There also might be a lot of people that downloaded classic already and hopefully most will activate and reserve names on the 12th.
---
On the other hand this type of release is so unique compared with other game releases and the demographic is so different it has to be hard to get a really accurate read on the numbers.
---
I want to be the very best,
---
My 3 buddies and I will be playing together on discord, but it may end up being a LAN party if the hype gets too real towards the last few days before launch. If anything, it will be myself and Friend 2 at Friend 3’s house with our MacBooks. 
---
I don’t have any obligations until September 7 (basically 2 weeks after launch), while my other friends are either working/interning and couldn’t get more than launch day off. That being said, they won’t be able to log in until 6pm on most weekdays which gives me a lot of time to gather things for our group or level an alt. 
---
I plan on leveling a Mage and Hunter to 60 and possibly a Druid after those two classes are capped. 
---
Strength and Honor.
---
Un'Goro soil. You're welcome.
---
Is retail aesthetic different?
---
Only about 17,000 rune cloth. No big deal.
---
The only gimping that will occur is that sour feeling when you can't count your Nelf front flips in a row while making some endless trek. Follow your heart. Also shadowmeld while eating/drinking is dope.
---
If you had the word astronaut in your job title you would drop it at every opportunity too.
---
Will the realms after character name registration give us an indication for server population, like "high, medium, low" etc.  
---
I would like to join a basically capped server for the economy, and I was hoping the name registration period will give us some indication of server pops.
---
Long story short, dude made a post saying he was gonna make a troll shaman named thex and asked what everyone else was gonna roll. Everyone else then responded saying they were gonna make a guy names thex thus overnight thex was made a celebrity
---
Nurfed was actually originally on Archimonde with Indalamar as the gm. I remember inspecting their warrior Noktyn who got the legendary necklace and their rogue Orgetorix to drool over his gear. They had a lock named Nystyr who also had items named for him.
---
Dunno but now it has to include Thex https://classictinker.com/name-generator/?maxLength=8&amp;minLength=8&amp;startLetters=Thex
---
Yeah, those people are the worst. In fact, I don't ask my partner to do anything with me. Camping? Nope. Going for a walk? Fuck no. I enjoy baseball, but I'll be damned if I ask her to go to a game with me. My first wife was an avid tennis player and made the mistake of trying to get me to play tennis with her once. I divorced her.
---
My guild is organising one. Total strangers to me but people are flying in from all over to get to know this new strange family and kick off classic properly. Can't wait.
---
Wasn't his name just Lard?
---
Morning? Well damn I was preparing for the evening glad I found out!
---
Perhaps they are reporting it because Alliance seems to be the default on this sub and most would be confused.
---
It's simple.  Some like this and others like that.  No-one is wrong or right.  If they do decide to come out with the next expansion then they should keep the classic servers frozen but allow you to copy your character over if you want to continue down that path.  Simple
---
Hopefully though, if they do continue forward then they, Bliz, makes changes as in No flying or LFR/LFG, among other things.
---
3 hours messing with the spreadsheet. I did 2 points imp overpower, might swap 1 point to anger management and so the same on cleave for howl I’m just talking pure pve
---
Vanilla wow challenged my GPA and career goals.
---
Classic will challenge my marriage.
---
You only need 9% hit (8 with +weapon skill) which is fairly easy to reach, and is your number one priority anyways. Nobody maxes out hit to 24% hit or what it was for was for dual wield.
---
Technically altering the model textures is a bannable offense.
---
&gt; Retail is the result of Blizz catering to the masses
---
Retail is the result of Blizzard catering to the most vocal*
---
It's people that kick and scream that get their way.  The people that were happy with the game as it was just stop playing when changes are made to cater to those others.
---
very epic
---
Yes. Private servers die after AQ/Naxx and a fresh one is born.
---
Great idea. Have the subreddit condone trolling! /s
---
Guki on Eldre’Thalas.
---
undead fire mage, got to 60 and figured out how to get on top of the goldshire inn early. would also do a lot of other shenanigans but most notably killing lowbies on GS inn
---
Thex but I'm not really worried about reserving it cause it's an obscure name
---
Yeah exactly like that!
---
We charge 4€/h at single hours and at cheapest the price is 2,5€/h (40 hours package). We don’t have unlimited hours packages tho we might add them during the fall. There is not a restaurant, just pretty casual snacks, drinks and coffee.
---
We opened the place in December so there is still a lot developing to be done. :D
---
If you're not leveling with a duo rogue would be better/easier probably.
---
They are free to not join the guild.
---
&gt;It's using the same launch style as the global release. So if you look at the wowhead global release schedule and just sub 8/26 or 8/27 with 8/12 and 13, youll get the accurate time and date.
---
Sounds good
---
&gt;the people getting payed to do a thing did it more than the people who did it for free
---
Very interesting theory
---
Mid late game maybe, in early phase where hit gear is lacking(blues/greens, you can barely get 9-10 hits) 2hand isn’t too far off with their low hit requirements
---
zug zug
---
It's fine and gets better the more phases come out, you get a lot out of leveling tailoring as you go. 1-60 with a healer you can spam Sta and shadow dmg and lifetap it back up
---
Posting to keep an eye on this. Way too old Swedish warlock here that'll hopefully find a guild sometime soon and join up.
---
Why would you not? Have you ever been in a relationship? I share a lot about what I look forward to, my concerns about the game, etc... even if she doesn't care, at least she's in the know about it.
---
Communicating about stuff, especially when it comes to what you do in your shared free time is pretty damn important in a relationship. 
---
Some people on this sub are so obtuse when it comes to this stuff. Even some of the people I plan on playing with can't seem to understand that I actually enjoy spending time with my wife - even more than I will enjoy Classic.
---
More a hobby thing, I’m a sort of serial entrepreneur with a couple of businesses. Tho it seems like it can turn into real business and we have plans of opening a second place this year
---
It's gonna be fishy when he spends the entire hiking trip playing wow in the house. Something tells me she'll catch on...
---
Dabu
---
There's a balance/resto hybrid spec that is fairly common in pvp. You could still raid with it too, but keep in mind that you're going to be expected to heal - the odds of you getting in a raid as balance are going to be slim, *especially* since you won't have moonkin aura.
---
Tricksey Hobbitses
---
Animations and spell graphics I agree with are amazing in BFA. The wow art team is on top of shit. HOWEVER... New alliance models look like ass and all of their running animations look like ass.
---
Is trade chat across all major cities in classic? You could just spam for a mage port if it is.
---
My top priority in Classic is Battlegrounds. I love them and want a class in which they can excel. I'll do a dungeon now and then but don't have the time for raiding. What is the best/most fun class in BGs, both max level and lower level?
---
I'm thinking a few classes: Warrior for obvious reasons, Mage because of easy leveling is with them, as well as control, Rogue because you can pick your fights, and Shaman because I've heard Ele can blow people up. Out of those 4, which is the overall best in battlegrounds?
---
In early phase you don’t even use 2h from 58+ dungeon or raid... you use the 3% hit chance sword as stat stick (you need to understand my post is all about early/mid phase where you have hard time getting hit cuz item/enchant, etc for hit isn’t release yet.  I am talking about phase1-2 maybe beginning of 3 of slow.  I would like to switch to DW at some point
---
I will be orc resto shaman main, as I played that through retail for years.  
---
I am looking for best suggestions for professions (assuming starting level 5 bank alt with goal of level 35 eventually) and alts to pair well.
---
My first thoughts were a warrior (tank/dps) and a hunter (casual ranged DPS/great PvP without heavy gear requirements).  I would love some suggestions on how to manage Professions between these three characters to maximize my Resto Shaman's raid/instance output and coin.   Thanks for the help!
---
Please
---
It's not, there is a version available to some people, nobody seems to know why for sure, but there was a blue post linked yesterday that said that's not the live version which will be available to everyone closer to the name reservation.
---
Is this a joke? Most raid dps specs in vanilla are 1-2 buttons. Just spamming.
---
In retail you have synergistic effects, procs, cooldowns to deal with. 
---
The most basic retail rotation is more complex than 90% of vanilla dps
---
What happened to your guildie? Was he ok in the end?
---
HA! I'm starting off with blacksmithing right away for the fire resistance gear. Kidding.
---
I really am flip-flopping on if I can play. Most of it is talk. But raiding is absolutely out. I'll likely get bored with my super slow warrior before level 30 if I can only play 30 minutes a night. That's what happened when I tried playing Pandaria. Played a month and was bored as shit. Maybe it was the content.
---
Yeah, let Thex be an exception!
---
It has been available to me for weeks, EU.
---
I think we'll see Phase 2 coincide with Blizzcon, then other phases will be more spread out
---
NOMEGALUL - they won't and can't- you get access to both games with a sub... ain't nothing stopping you from trading.
---
Is there a blue post anywhere saying its actually at 6pm or just assumed?
---
Soon!
---
Added later 100%
---
omg I really hope WoW tokens in classic arent a thing. That would ruin so much. Prices would go through the roof.
---
**Completely new to WoW: Planning to go Troll/Orc/Tauren Hunter. Which professions pair well?**
---
I would like to have two gathering professions until 60, because I don't know how much time I can invest in WoW and therefore like to have a playstyle that lets me level a bit faster (without doing powerleveling, i want to enjoy everything). So here are two options I am considering. What do you think about it? (:
---
* Orc/Troll: Start with **Mining** (keep everything) + **Skinning** (for XP and selling for Gold). At 60 switch **Skinning** to **Engineering**.
---
* Tauren: Start with **Herlabism** (keep everything) + **Skinning** (XP and selling for Gold). At 60 switch **Skinning** to **Alchemy**.
---
I don't want to focus 100% on PvP, I just want it to be possible to also play PvP. Is it possible with a Troll or even Tauren? And is Tauren  better for making money than a Troll, when I decide between these two?
---
Most of the new casting/spell animations look pretty damn good. The biggest compliants that I've seen were about the character models. 
---
Some (not all) of them look way too ... toonish... like their reactions are too stretchy and exaggerated, like they were from a cartoon or something.
---
I played both during Vanilla, BC, and WotLK. 
---
I would personally give the edge to shaman if you are looking for entertainment and engagement.  
---
I reached rank 11 on my priest and 10 on my shaman, so as far as battlegrounds go, I would ask yourself do you want to be more defensive or offensive? Priests are great as heal bots in BGs, but Shaman bring amazing utility and the ability to adapt to many situations in BGs. They can go from healing to bursting at any moment. Know what totems to use when can change a skirmish. 
---
Dungeons should be a breeze for both classes. Priests more single target healing capabilities, but shamans again bring more utility. They can heal any dungeon without a problem, but they can also lay down wind fury, grace of air, mana tide, etc.. they can interrupt enemy casts with a shock and they can purge some buffs that the mobs give themselves. 
---
Raiding will depend on your raid set up. I was always a main tank healer on my priest, but your team may give that to the druids. Shamans are typically used as group healers because chain heal is much better than what a priest or druid can do for multi heal situations. 
---
Some people think totems are a pain, but I enjoyed the extra requirement of moving and placing the totems properly. Healing the DPS was more engaging than spamming heals on the main tank. 
---
If you are looking to heal, both classes are amazing, just in different ways. Think about what style you would prefer and it should be an easy choice!
---
That's my thought. Is WoW worth it to play 30 minutes a day? Not likely.
---
You appear to have made a mistake when scheduling your week long off-site training.
---
"This is my Thex.  There are many like it, but this Thex is mine."
---
This isn't a new game why would they offer a free trial to a game that doesn't have a base purchase?
---
It causes more headaches than new customers...
---
It sound a whole lot like punching out at 1pm type of days in September then.
---
That sounds so fun. I wish our public computers (I work in a public library) were a bit beefier and could support wow classic. if they could, I'd totally do a lock-in event for kids / teens when it launches. Getting paid to play wow! The dream =)
---
Are you the owner or just work there? Was curious how the profit margin is on such a place, with the huge up front hardware cost, internet, and such. 4 Euros / hr... that's like $5 per hour? Doesn't seem too bad, if I had no other choice I'd gladly pay it, but man that would add up fast lol. I guess if it was like $100 per month unlimited I'd consider that.
---
Idk what you mean just try it. I saw 2 hand fury top the meter in phase 1(altho pserver, but he got EOB -no one need against him while I am dal rend).   Even we both in blue he would still be 5% range of dps difference only. Once bwl on farm ofc will think about DW (with zg out would even be better).
---
But I'm Thex the Shaman
---
Well, he needs to put some work on the idea, that's on him. He could start by barricading the door of the room and do animal noises for awhile. Improvise as needed from there.
---
Like aids in general, hunter aids is held in check by the massive amount of money they can make farming. [Here's a great, extremely comprehensive Mara farming guide.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=VozAoQ3gPCQ)
---
there's no dude called asyz or asyx in FRESH :D
---
If you want a good example of how far Vanilla PvP has gotten for rogues, look up Perplexity.
---
Is there any word on when the classic client will be available for download? I know some people have had it show up in their launcher, it hasn't shown up for me.
---
The difficulty is not what's important, it's the same core concepts you explore the map looking for quests or do dungeons for rewards.
---
Also your topic is about getting to 12 - that does nothing for alliance :)
---
Blue 40-58 2hand sword just filter this in classic dB
---
PMd
---
thanks man, sorry in the delay in getting back to you. So far I think we have a Priest, a Tank, a Hunter and a Rogue. Maybe a Mage or Warlock would compliment my mates better than a Pally.
---
2 yes
---
as 2h fury with decent gear on pservers I still found myself sometimes needing to spam both HS and hamstring to burn off extra rage (wbuffs and windfury spikes). wouldn't drop the talent myself and would just keep an eye on the threat meter like always
---
I would whichever race you like the looks of most and then go Herb/Skinning to Herb/Alch regardless of which one.  As a fairly casual player that isn't into die hard PVPing I don't think you'll get the full value of Engineering for it to be worth the cost.  Tauren's racial for herb is nice, but don't let that be the only reason you pick them over the others.  It's not THAT nice. 
---
If you truly like all three races and have ZERO preference between them aesthetically then I'd probably go troll.
---
Hahaa that made me chuckle after seeing that post yesterday
---
LONG LIVE THEX THE IMMORTAL!
---
Would you say of the 4, mage is the fastest leveler?
---
A hunter called Thex, I think I'll call my pet Thex.
---
Sorry, but most of the features you mention are a good reason why a big part of this Reddit community wanted Classic in the first place. So no, they do not exist in Classic and I really hope they never implement them.
---
I plan to go alliance hunter but if I was going horde it would be Orc 100%. Stun resistance, increased pet damage, plus the dps cooldown orcs get (blood fury? i forget).
---
I'd go engineering just for the utility you get with all of the bombs and being able to make your own ammo. If you are wanting gold go herbing and alchemy. You can make your own potions and sell flasks/potions on the auction house. So to me the real question would be do you want to have a few more buttons for pvp with eng, or rake in extra gold with alchemy.
---
I concur. I don't know how multi-leg griffon flights or sorting by "Buy It Now" prices at the AH can impact "that vanilla feeling".
---
Whats a key ?
---
This. You'll meet people on the levelling and gearing grind. Easy.
---
You just recruit 6 Mages?
---
Give him a break, he can only take 10 of you at once.
---
Dungeon finder f off, it ruined wow
---
IMO de-ranking alone makes the rotations more dynamic/complex. Retail might have more mechanics but that doesn't make the rotation more complex.  
---
Raids are way more complex now than they were before so it makes sense that you would need to use more situational spells in retail.
---
I can see your point though and I played as a shaman in classic so maybe my rotation was just a lot more complex than others?
---
I was torn between 5 box and dualbox leveling but I think I've ultimately decided ok dualbox questing instead - I just don't think I can spend 150+ hours strictly in dungeons.
---
That's really my only negative for it, I think the challenge of running 5 would be a lot of fun at 60 though :)
---
You've always been able to turn off the shadows in WoW.
---
Make sure you name him Thex
---
No doubt. Shaman is also really good, but mage has more conveniences and can AoE (though maybe not at launch). Warrior is the slowest, and rogues are OK (definitely on the slower side, but I found it very fun)
---
Hahahahahahahaha
---
Dont play then. Like i dont get it, you already have retail which has everything you want
---
Your race is next to irrelevant. I would 100% pick that based off what character model you want to stare at for the next thousand hours. While you *can* min/max your race pick, the mynute benefits are going to be negligible for a new player.
---
The professions are a little difference. While I'd still recommend you pick what you'd overall enjoy, engineering is the superior pick between the two as it has great benefits in both PvP and PvE raiding scenarios. The PvP benifits are widely talked about, but also most *hardcore* guilds will in fact require all their raiders to have engineering. In addition I believe there are some BiS that engineering gives hunters, though I am not up to snuff on my hunter gear progression. 
---
However, alchemy/herb is going to be a larger money maker at level 60. Plus, I like the idea of buffing myself with potions/elixirs more than using engineering items during fights. 
---
TLDR:  
---
Class - which ever character model you like  
---
Professions - pro/cons of each with engineering having the edge. I'd personally go alchemy unless you're serious in raiding/pvp.
---
Sometime scary about 2 hand is if you got lucky 4 crit in a row( BT , auto , WF, Hoj) you are rip af.  But how would u put ur 20 point in arm pure pve https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LbhxkIbZVVkVMxoVo
---
For some reason mages are the only class that didn't really apply. We filled up quickly on everything else.
---
In raids I agree but in PvP it's no competition, classic had more dynamic/complex playstyles.
---
Raiding has always been more about output than specific skills/spells (for the most part) anyways.
---
Anyone got something like that for shammys?
---
You deserve a harem of Nelfs dancing around you.
---
And it begins, the Karma mill is open
---
I do plan on adding more things, yes. Infra's doc was definitely my inspiration for this. It's so good. On the main page there's a "Things to Add" section that shows my intent on things to add for the future. 
---
I'm currently working on a professions page to be added next. Consumes / Enchants is definitely coming in the future. Pre-BiS and Raid-BiS I'm still in the air about adding. I'm most likely just going to add links to Shedo's dps calculator, Thick Hydd's mitigation calculator, etc... they've done it better than I will have the option to on that spreadsheet
---
You'll be fine as soon as realm names release... I have zero intention in looking for a guild for me and my friends before realm names are released.
---
That could be it. It's been 13 years but I'm sure you're right.
---
Alliance Mage here.
---
Same. That would be my wife's reaction too.
---
There will be more mages than rogues. Mages we're very OP in classic, especially with gear

ThexMex
---
Those features exist in retail.
---
Have fun!
---
AV is bae
---
i wouldnt be so  concnerned to have exaclty 40 before you even hit 60, Id make the recruitiung less strict and try and get 60 guildies. You never know who will actually get to 60, and you never know who will actually be any good
---
You won't go wrong picking a mage. They have tons of burst, control and being at ranged in BG's is always the best in my opinion. Rogues are very situational in BG's, warriors require a pocket healer to be optimal (otherwise prepare to be rooted and slowed most of the time), and shaman are hit or miss. Shaman you will bring a ton of utility. 
---
So i'd go Mage or Shaman if i were you.
---
It's a 5 min video. You make a big deal out of saving 2-3 mins.
---
Exactly! Same attitude I’m going in with.
---
This is it. The thread I didn't know I needed lol
---
If you have an active sub, it should be available.
---
They have the choice of 2 specs and will forever be  behind until naxx where they make up some ground.
---
I'd say mage.  Easier invites for PVE, not crazy gear dependent, quite versatile and effective in pvp.  Warrior and Shaman are great but pretty gear dependent.  Rogue would be up there with Mage but not quite as easy to get into those PVE groups.  For Rogue v Mage it'd probably come down to your preference of gameplay style--stealthy melee or flashy caster.
---
Warrior/Mage/Rogue are the big dicks in term of popularity, but how good they are in PvE depends on whether you refer to leveling or end game. In leveling, Warriors and Rogues are maybe the two slowest classes to level with worse solo capabilities. Warlock has it very easy to level and solo content, even some elites. In endgame, they still perform a vital role even though they may not top the meters.
---
Just for fun factor, everyone should (try) make a Shaman named Thex.
---
Every realm should have a Shaman named Thex.
---
Best answer
---
I agree that most content is very fun if community driven, but having full support in game for endless challenges also seems fun to me.  Nothing about new content says you are forced to do it.  The only reason you would be 'forced' into playing what I am mentioning is if the meta is forced in a new direction by whatever is provided as a reward for getting through X levels of the endless dungeon concept.  Even then I think it would be best if it was just cosmetic or just materials for crafting or pets or whatever is not progression based.

Dude how single/insecure are you? Or are you just really young? This is the second posts I've seen you on calling something relationship related "cringy" Believe it or not, people in relationships enjoy sharing activities together.
---
Still need to know how the gear progression/to aim for at least from phase 1-4. In case it take longer for me to transit into DW cuz too many warriors
---
I understand people don’t want changes, but sometimes it seems really counter productive. 
---
It’s also a bit frustrating that most times when you try to debate these things you immediately get downvoted to hell because, “no changes!” Even thought a majority of the people here are used to private servers which are tuned completely differently.
---
Most of the respondents chose PvP server. The locks just want ez gearing for PvP. Warlock t2 is the only one even close to r13 sets. The rest are just miles behind for PvP. 
---
Expect the first MC/BWL raids to be full of warlocks on PvP servers. The number will fall off once you hit AQ and those locks are running around killing people instead.
---
I'm doing the exact same thing to avoid Loot competition. Orc 2h. Craft an arcanite reaper asap to get your raid spot nailed down for MC. You have 4-5 chances of snagging a great 2H every MC run. Earthshaker, Obsidian Edged Blade, Spinal Reaper, Bonereaver's Edge, or maybe eye of rag if you want to farm your ass off. Plus untamed blade drops from Razorgore in bwl first boss. We can switch to DW during the AQ40 phase and beyond. The last thing I want to do is compete with the million fucking rogues for Brutality blade etc etc
---
I guess the butthurt meme spec players report me
---
 Lol
---
Hey i remember this aswell, i have no clue why! Nostalgic feeling :D
---
I plan on either going Troll shaman or rogue. I have decided though that his name will be Thex. That was decided long before i picked a toon. Please do not reserve Thex as i really want it.
---
Probably multiboxers.
---
&gt; Retail might have more mechanics but that doesn't make the rotation more complex.
---
How? More mechanics means more to track and more to react to. More room to play well or make mistakes.
---
The one constant I can think of (as me and two other friends can download it too) is using our 3 day free sub about a month ago.
---
Scroll down for the obligatory "then go play retail tool" post
---
Yeah fresh restarts is another option, especially if the private server community has already proven this to be viable.
---
Fresh restarts makes me think of ladder systems too, but this doesn't translate well from ARPG -&gt; MMORPG
---
I'm assuming this also means the server list will be announced soon seeing how we need to choose a server to create our name reserve characters.
---
Same meta for 1 year is one thing.
---
Having the name Thex forever is another.
---
Troll. Reported.
---
I see your point but we have to remember server rhymes with horsetail was built with passion; Blizz is for profit all profit and the programmers are probably treated like shit.  Don't quote me on that.
---
You seem really open minded.
---
You can drop improved overpower later in life when your gear is better. Once your rage generation is starting to go bonkers the switch to battlestance becomes more problematic and less beneficial
---
If you are thinking PvP, yes. Troll berserking isn't that useful, while undead WotF is huge against priests and locks (which are two of your hardest match-ups). For alliance, generally speaking, human doesn't give that many benefits for a mage (other than rep, which is nice. The spirit isn't that impactful). Gnomes, on the other side, have a nice little bonus to intellect (especially nice early on, not that impactful in the late game) and escape artist is always nice in PvP.
---
Also my question would help you if that’s how you feel as well. You’d know which servers to avoid but hey, what do I know.
---
What quest reward are you gonig to take for Voodoo Feather's Quest? I'm leaning towards razorsteel shoulders because I don't want to farm truestrike against rogues / hunters and the abyssal shoulders are AQ phase... plus the diamond flask is overrated imo. Hand of Justice is #1 and then its either blackhands breath or rune of the guard captain, right?
---
Honestly , achievements. They dont even need to give a reward, but its a nice way to track what you have done.
---
Lvling priest in vanilla is actually pretty fast and fun because there's no down time. Stack spirit and maintain 50ish percent hp and Mana and adjust casting vs wand accordingly.
---
Ah yes, the classic Dwauren Druid
---
there should be instances where you actually want to use heroic strike
---
At this point, I feel Blizzard owes us an in-game Thex themed trinket with this as its flavor text... Classic+ or retail, idgaf. I would farm the shit out of it on my troll shaman (unnamed to protect against handle sniping).
---
What faction have you decided on? Horde?
---
Interesting, I’m rolling warlock as my alt so that should be cool.
---
In the past couple weeks, I've been juggling between Hunter, Mage and Warlock (Probably Horde, not set in stone yet...). 
---
I'll probably be able to clock in about 5 to 10 hours a week with a 12 hour day here and there, so I consider myself very casual. This and the fact that I always preferred PvP over PvE, I'm looking for a class that can perform well in PvP with either PvP blues (rank7-8 max) or Pre-raid BiS gear. 
---
I mained a Warlock through Vanilla and TBC focusing heavily on PvP (approx. 2000 rating in TBC 2v2) and dabbled in PvP with Mage in MoP (1800ish rating casual 2v2). Never really tried Hunter and it looks like they have a very complete set of skills for PvP without great gear. 
---
Help me out on this one, I probably only have the time to level one character to 60, so I would like to have all the information available to make an enlightened choice!
---
Knowing I made someone that giggly makes me happy.  Thank you.
---
I raided with a priest in Vanilla, healing though MC and BWL, where I then switched to raid in shadow in AQ40 and Naxx. I struggled with farming mats/gold though, so I had a Rogue and Mage that I sometimes farmed on. I plan to play fairly casually, but I do intend to raid a bit.
---
For classic I'm stuck between a Mage and Hunter
---
**Mage** (Male Human, will lvl in NE areas to get Cat mount at 40)
---
Pros
---
* Has Portals
---
* Can AOE Farm
---
* Has good CC
---
* Has very high DPS, more so as you progress in raids
---
* Has a buff (AI), I like buffing people, has a feel good factor to it
---
* Has CC, which can help groups, makes you feel like  you are contributing
---
Cons
---
* Frostbolt can get boring...
---
* Downtime to drink every few pulls
---
* Lots of mages, so might be harder to get raid spots
---
* Lots of casters to compete with for gear
---
* Can be pestered a lot for portals and water/food
---
**Hunter** (NE female, for shadowmeld and also best looking animations imho)
---
* Crazy fast leveling speed
---
* Very little downtime
---
* Pet's add a fun aspect to the play style
---
* Has Frost Trap (but it's not as powerful or reliable as sheep)
---
* Can solo elites and even some bosses
---
* Less Hunters is raids, so technically quicker to gear up
---
* Bag space issues due to ammo and pet food
---
* DPS does not scale as well as you progress in raids
---
* Rogues and Warriors rolling on hunter weapons for when they pull mobs!
---
* Not as much demand for hunters in raid groups compared to other classes
---
* Have a semi-bad reputation which can follow you around
---
For professions, for leveling I'll be taking skinning/mining for Hunter or skinning/herbalism for Mage, with the idea to drop skinning and to go engineering with hunter and tailoring with Mage. I'm fully planned out on how to play both, but I only want to have 1 main!
---
I'm sure I've missed a few things, but I feel like both are pretty powerful and I'm finding myself flip flopping on a weekly basis. :P
---
The basic idea is that STR gives AP while Agi gives 1/2 AP but also gives crit. What a lot of the better gear has both STR and AGI, his hypothesis also notes that AGI gives you increased armour and dodge (which is true). While leveling prioritizing AGI is probably right whereas when you get to end game finding the right mix of STR and AGI will be based on your current gear and what not.
---
It's name is Thexjr isn't it?
---
There it is, the obligatory Fortnite reference if someone disagrees with you. Heaven forbid people have fun with another game!
---
Seems like when this games launches every dev team is going to be at half power for a week
---
Every morning I check Wowhead classic for exactly this. Let me know which server to reserve my name on already reeeeee
---
But who will get legolas
---
NEET4CLASSIC
---
Who is this Thex?
---
Most guilds will have a holy priest spec into shadow weaving and not bring a dumpster fire spriest
---
You need to add a countdown in global cooldowns remaining
---
Vilken stad?
---
woah Pog fresh playing with bork borks this is Poggers
---
I'll take your advice, thanks for the long explanation. I wasn't sold on the idea of dual gathering for levelling as a warlock, but you make some good valid points. I'll definitely consider it !
---
I'll be heading over to my dads for a morning into afternoon session at some point during release week.
---
Oh boy this again
---
Ppl need to put some respect on it.
---

---
idk how it works, thats what class leaders are for
---
I do have an active sub, but it isn't available for some reason. All I see are BFA and PTR in the drop down menu.
---
&gt; Roll a meme spec and see what you can do with it... who cares if it’s not the best spec for X or Y, it kicks ass at Z!
---
I mean still though, there's so many absolutely busted things that have been nerfed on private servers that were discovered in the beta datamine. Things like 1,400 health-per-second self-healing Rogues with the Bloodfang Set, or Paladins hitting 800 thorns damage coming from the Flame Wrath weapon. Not to mention the fact that we have confirmed proc rates on maybe 2 out of 400 unique chance-on-hit weapons which were known to have variable % odds to proc.
---
People put too much faith in private servers, this meta ain't "solved" yet.
---
To get people hooked so they start paying for the subscription? The only difference it being new makes is that they aren't going to be as hard up for the cash, but it's not necessarily a terrible idea. I could see them wanting to hold off for at least a few weeks though to ensure the servers aren't absolutely decimated.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cjzd2p/whats_your_classic_main_name_going_to_be/
---
You forgot the most important aspect.... fun.  I don’t think many people are attempting to min/max a meme spec because they think the dps will work they are doing it because they want to.
---
Before you say something like “BUT THE RAID MEMBERS ARE CARRYING THEM BLAHHHH”.  The majority of guilds won’t give a shit, not only because raids don’t really require that much dps, or because it’s hard enough to find 40 people, it’s just that most don’t really care about min/maxing no matter what the forum leads you to believe
---
This isn't hard, you just give the time off as either first come first served or seniority like everyone else in the world. The answer isn't "lol no vacation cause everyone wants it". That's horrible logic
---
Basically true.
---
well maybe they are browns fans

---
Good for you, wanting something so bad =D its nice.
---
There are however a few issues in your comment here.
---
1. Troll Berserking on a warrior dps or tank, is a meme, if you do the math on it, its so bad.
---
2. Alliance racials is not superior than Horde in PvE. Except for Fear Ward which only applies to some fights, but is very strong in those fights.
---
3. Its the Paladin class that makes Alliance so insanely LFR mode PvE, not their racials. This is because of Blessings and judgement debuff applied to the target. Paladin &gt; Shaman ANY DAY OF THE WEEK. (I will play Horde, because this is somewhat of a slight challenge)
---
4. If you intend to tank, there is even less chance you will be the receiver of The Corrupted Ashbringer. Even if you make your own guild, manage to have steady progression in almost 2 years when Naxx will be released and then to clear The Four Hoursemen, taking this weapon as tank won't be welcomed by the dps.
---
But, I hope you somehow get it and at the same time not stepping on anyone's toes :)
---
Thanks dr Phil
---
So a free trial to what, level 5?
---
He’s obviously taking his pc to a hotel with good WiFi for a week.

Medivh came in during BC with the Karazhan raid and the Black Morass dungeon. He wasn’t in vanilla, no
---
I don’t want to spoil if you intend to read the book, but the books do cover some of the same material that occurred in the Warcraft film from a couple years ago
---
Great point you have there
---
One of The main problem will be dealing with bracket breakers (and I’m sure there will plenty). On many pservers there were Chinese (or other) ranking mafias that’s would religiously hunt down/camp/grief bracket breakers to make them stop. It’s definitely possible that a bracket breaker hunting mafia will be created, but I don’t think one would be present on the majority of servers, making bracket breaking have no real consequence (aside from the rankers trying to blacklist the breakers). 
---
I personally think that with x-realm BG’s that bracket breaking will be rampant as there will be no problems with BG que times (come phase 3 of course). Only time will tell how it plays out, but I’m sure there will be solutions found on each server if it’s a big enough problem.
---
I agree that phase 2 will be a shitshow, and I’m looking forward to it!
---
I have a better idea, stay tuned ;)
---
Confront her/go to HR. Mostly because I want to see a follow-up post where your boss says "I'm blocking all vacation because I heard some dumb video game is coming out".

Recall some of the guild names from a certain private server. Even played in one.

---
My plan is skinning and tailoring, dropping tailoring for Herbalism when I make my archemage, then dropping skinning for engineering.
---
Alt will have enchanting and alchemy.

---
You'd be suprised how many people actually do care.
---
Why bring a ret or boomkin when there's no short supply of rogues and mages out there?
---
General is my prefered porsjon snus though, but for løs you cant beat Ettan
---
So what is it you tell yourself? Do a million+ people just not know other games besides retail WoW exist? Is that why they keep playing such a garbage game?
---
Maybe it could be that it's just for a different audience that you aren't a part of anymore? Or would that be too simple?
---
If Classic doesn't hit the same or greater subscribers, should they make it more like retail? Or should they be more mature than you and accept that different people like different things, and decide to have two games with different design philosophies that bring in two different audiences? What's your preferred outcome there?
---
I'm planning on a shaman named Thex

I played on a wotlk server for over 8 years, and I don't really enjoy wotlk as an expansion.
---
You could queue BG and get in one almost instantly, the channels were spammed all the time looking for people to do ICC (they wanted 5.8k gs for 10n, so this is a problem with a server that is played for a long time)
---
People enjoy the game for what it is
---
Winterspring is going to be absolute hell to level through if youre not 60 by phase 2
---
The game systems don't really support it. Shit like this works in Eve bc the systems are so developed
---
Enjoy being a garbage hunter. You'll fit right in with the huntards.
---
Ultimately both have management of their characters which can be tedious - like you mentioned. 
---
Both are fun. 
---
Mages can be monotonous in raid spell rotations. Mages have mana management and downtime between pulls. 
---
Hunters have ammo management. Access to more ammo - can be rough.  Also, the swing timer for your dps rotation can be fun - and challenging. Also, keep your pets happy and fed :). 
---
Mages farm well for aoe. Hunters can tear through single target and farm fast. 
---
Do you want to shoot arrows, or summon frost bolts of death?
---
Narrowed it down to one of the two pet classes for my main.  I heavily prefer mobile classes in the sense that I like to move a lot when I'm doing stuff (instant casts).  
---
For these reasons I was pretty much dead set on Hunter, but after reading more and more, I'm not sure if they are the best choice after all due to deadzone, leeway, and the end-game rotation revolving around a very long Aimed Shot cast time.
---
So now I'm considering Warlock as well, but there are a few things that concern me.  Hoping I can get swayed in one way or another.
---
Hunter Pros:
---
* Mobile-ish, but not nearly on the same level as retail (stationary autoshot, aimed shot, deadzone)
---
* Better pet damage/aggro (at least on beta this seemed to be the case)
---
* Less gear reliant
---
* Easier life starting at 60 (phase 1/2)
---
Hunter Cons:
---
* More pet management (not huge)
---
* End-game rotation revolves around a long (3s?) cast
---
* Heavily nuanced gameplay with deadzone/leeway and autoshot clipping
---
* Requires paying more attention to rotation/gameplay
---
* Have to play in/out of combat for CC
---
Warlock Pros:
---
* Mobile-ish, some combination of instant casts/procs and short cast times.
---
* In-combat (semi-broken) CC
---
* Group utility 
---
* Potentially easier to get into groups
---
* Lots of keybinds (pvp)
---
Warlock Cons:
---
* Soulshards (this isn't that big a deal to me tbh)
---
* "Boring" pve rotation (I don't plan to raid much so this also isn't that big a deal to me)
---
* Late gear/power spike (this is the one that scares me the most)
---
I would be doing a mix of group/pug PvP and PvE.  Probably running a lot of 5/10 mans, Battlegrounds, and maybe occasional raid.  Would like to be self-sufficient since I don't know if I'll have a dedicated group online for stuff most days.  I like being tanky/survivable which has me leaning Warlock more these days, as well as the fact I feel a Lock would be taken over a Hunter in a pug (for group utility if nothing else) but at the same time I love my BM hunter on retail and the hunter/ranger playstyle.
---
halp.
---
Ya for sure I agree with that, PvP is where the utility can shine through and ya, utility in classic is far more vast than anything in retail
---
They're adding multiple leg flight paths, a customized UI, cooldown timers in the default UI, and a few other nice quality of life changes that don't negatively impact the games community the way dungeon finder did.
---
 I’m more excited about the server names being announced so I can select a home!
---
And: Race.
---
People like me are not trying to be absolute assholes when we point out how big the racial differences can be. We are just trying to prevent unknowing people from being disappointed.
---
If you pick weird professions or the wrong spec, you still get to change them when you are disappointed.
---
Cringe
---
I wish. I will have just moved countries to The Netherlands 3 weeks beforehand so I probably won't know anybody, but god damn I'll be there on launch anyway.
---
Spamstring and run baby.
---
100% agree with this. From your engagement level - and what it brings to a group - this would fit really well.
---
there are multi-leg griffon flights.  
---
they also added a quality of life to them that allows us to cancel and get off at next stop
---
It appears that the only other time that this link was posted was over a year ago.  Don't know what to tell you about that.
---
Kuth
---
Isn't this the exact type of casual shit post everyone was dreading this sub to be inundated with as we get closer to launch?
---
I love this build! Ignore what people are saying about holy shield and defense, definitely do not need them for a paladin aoe build (holyshield is nice threat in a group however). Unfortunately, I will not be running this dream spec, with the Uber 8% speed buff, because I will need to raid and I cannot heal with this spec at max level.
---
If I ever go through a phase of non raiding I would highly consider running this build so I can farm low dungeons etc, the Hobbs way of pulling
---
They should, High/Medium/Low pop servers are not showing you the current or active players in that server, they are servers set up to handle high/low/medium populations. 
---
If you like less chaos and want to stand out easier maybe a low-pop server is for you, where as a high-pop server is always going to have something going on somewhere.
---
For you I'd join a high-pop server, most people will join those.
---
I am a bit weary about taken the day(s) off. I took 5 days of for  WoD launch and had to endure sever issues/connection problems at beginning (probably affected my love fore WoW as I havnt played since WoD). 
---
Although it's been badly advertised I Truely believe there will be a huge gamer population playing it or atleast trying it for first few months and I don't want to get hit with failed to connect issues!

The Zins (one of the first, if not first WoW Multiboxer) from Magtheridon-US. He would allow us to win AV games in under 30mins because of how dominant he was in PvP with his 4 mages insta-gibbing anyone nearby.

---
I mean it could. I'd be pretty surprised to see a re-launch of a 15 year old game using updated engines have a bad launch. There won't be 10 million people playing it launch day either, like there has been in past expansions. 
---
I could see a bit of lag, but the whole day being shot would be surprisingly bad. We're accepting layering for phase 1 specifically for this issue.

Warlocks will be beasts in the later phases. They scale with gear. I hear their first two Tier sets are like PvP gear.

That's good to hear, thanks!

No one cares stupid. This looks like a good post for r/ihavesex

Ska bli intressant, kanske man träffar folk på servern som bor i samma stad. Vore kul med någon tävling mellan städerna hehe.

Well, that spree ended I think on June 26 as the server launched the 22nd. They basically haven't played since.

They're  an odd fellow...

I'm naming all my bank alts Thex, Thexx, Thexxx, and TheRealThex
---
Only one of these priests will kill Ragnaros. Dare to guess which one?
---
Amazing list, keep it up! 
---
I'd add the atal'ai gloves https://classicdb.ch/?item=10787 for healing in Sunken Tempel (+9 heal/spelldamage and can roll as "of healing).
---
Because that’s the way they’re doing it. Classic is not a carbon copy of Vanilla. I don’t like it either but cloth turn-in was in the beta so you can expect to see a lot of people with tiger mounts in Classic.
---
For deciding on professions... are there any professions that are *fun* to level while your character levels? They all mostly seem like chores to me.
---
Lol uninstall fuckin casual
---
I would go with mage or rogue. Warrior is a wrecking ball, as long as you have a pocket healer. 
---
Mage is probably more flexible outside of bgs and would allow for some easy aoe farming to provide some income since spamming bgs does not allow much time for getting gold.
---
😁
---
Nah, classic will maybe have a mil on launch. BFA had over 3 mil on the first day with minimal issues
---
Identity theft is not a joke, Jim!
---
I'm totally speculating too. At the end of the day I just want to play the WoW that I love, and I'm happy to be going back to Vanilla. Can't wait to see you, and everyone else, there!

Haha eller hur. Jävla feeling endå

blizz needs a long term solution, i was hoping the classic community would rally to this cause, but they force us into r/classicwowplus and downvote us.
---
This will have us right back where we were before once youve cleared naxx for the 100th time
---
there a few modern features from wow I'm going to miss. the barber is one of them. little quality of life thing that had nothing to do with the way the game played.
---
1. Avoid ganks by duo leveling. safety in numbers, and there's a huge boost to xp/per hour.
---
2. getting ganked isn't that bad, most of the time its a mild inconvenience. If your being camped then fly to a different area to quest and you're fine.
---
Edit: Humans are by far the best alliance warriors thanks to that extra weapon skill on swords and maces. NE only get 1% dodge, and shadowmeld is only good for ganking/camping.
---
Why did you have to interject that? At this point linking ihavesex is the ultimate sign of “I Don’t have sex and am jealous”
---
Some might, some wont.
---
You dont need to buy the newest expac to experience the changes to the game.
---
Guys I am not a celebrity. Please, you're making me blush.
---
The fact that they're upgrading servers with new hardware makes me hopeful that layering is going to eventually come to Retail or the removal of sharding completely. Wasn't one of the big reasons for sharding in the first place that their "new" servers couldn't handle so many people in one place?
---
It's ganking, not 'gangking'.
---
I had time planned off, but not launch day. I don't expect the launch day to be unplayable tho. 
---
I'm getting more and more hyped for it tho. I honestly think I will have more fun than original classic. I won't be worried about class reworks and such. Plus I already have a large guild of irl friends and people from previous PS to play with. It's gonna be awesome!
---
Here's the video/time stamp of why agi is better for raid dps: [https://youtu.be/P2t7qG9SrVI?t=618](https://youtu.be/P2t7qG9SrVI?t=618)
---
Suprisingly high representation for Druids btw, at 9.7% as of commenting.
---
It wouldn't be a wasteland because lots of people enjoy doing things that you do not.  Lots of people would like a static realm they don't have to worry about grinding gear on 24x7 and just relax and world pvp.
---
Furthermore if blizzard does entertain the idea of adding TBC content to classic later down the road, they will most likely keep a server or two held at vanilla for those that wish to continue playing vanilla.
---
Hey. It me.
---
Whoaaa you just reminded me of an old buddy, Nang. I think he was an orc but I cant remember his class, maybe warrior? We played on Blood Furnace in our guild &lt;The Foot Clan&gt; and Nang, though he never had a mic, was notorious for /yelling "UNLEAAAAASH THE FUUUUUURRRRRYYYY!" before charging at allies. We almost exclusively were charging toward people that outleveled us but we would cry laughing at his hijinx. I wish I could find that dude, great times.
---
You can make up the hit via things like edgemasters but you’ll lose out on dps. Human warriors do anout 7% more dps than the other alliance races
---
It's disturbing when nobody mentions "gangking"
---
Thought it was the 13th

Amazing spreadsheet, added to my disk, thank you very much for this!

Please get the stick out of your butt... Wether the post is true or not gaming is still male dominated and a lot of girls find the gaming world completely alien, so it’s just poking fun at that.

Okay? Post a vanilla raid screenshot.

&gt; As someone who really really enjoys playing the AH and who only stayed subbed to retail as long as I did just for the AH, I tell you this.

This... is really sad

Yes please, as long as the gameplay remains unchanged.

Bal/resto in pvp would be very gear dependant.  You likely wouldn't have either moonkin form or swiftmend, making you pretty squishy.  If you could outlast burst damage from rogues/mages it could work alright, but again you'd probably need to outgear your opponent by a lot.  Commit to moonkin for the armour or resto for the instant heal, either spec will be fine for doing pve content.  Of course a moonkin won't be top dps but the only raid out there is gonna be MC and Onyxia for several months and they're not that hard.  You're also going to be hitting those 5 mans at level 60 for quite awhile too.  If you really want balance/resto hybrid its viable but you need the gear to back it up.  It can be a nice spec for healing 5 mans and being able to farm/solo quests.
---
It won't be like back when a TV show talks about the one gnome that got a sabercat mount by fetch quest turn-ins.
---
I mained a Druid in Vanilla. They are very fun to play out in the world, with stealth, snare-breaking, and other perks. I loved that aspect.
---
As a healer in raids, the gameplay is mainly queuing up Healing Touch on the tank and then deciding whether to let it go off or cancel it. This does take skill and if you do it well, you are very mana efficient (Healing Touch itself is mana efficient, and if you get to cancel a few in a row, you reach the 5-second rule) and are one of the healers still healing at the end of the fight when everything is going to hell and a boss kill is hanging in the balance. However, it is repetitive. Druids aren't very good at doing quick raid heals. The faster heal, Regrowth, is very mana inefficient. Rejuv (instant HoT) is an okay way to do top-offs on DPS, but if you do a lot of that you become less efficient and won't have those moments where you hit the 5-second rule. Battle Rez and Innervate do give you a sense of added importance in the raid, which is nice.
---
Bear tanking is viable (and I did a lot of bear tanking in vanilla) if your guild is willing to gear you for it (for example, the armor cloak in MC is a way bigger  upgrade for a bear than it is for a warrior, but in vanilla many guilds would give even dps-focused warriors those cloaks before a Druid could have one). You also need to research how bear stats function, and do a lot of work on your own to gear properly - for example, it's mandatory for a bear tank to have Enchanting so that they can make the Smoking Heart of the Mountain armor trinket, and you have to go deep into BRD to make it - it can actually be done solo using some tricks, if you can find a guide. The gearing of a bear tank was contentious at times, and I sometimes resented the fact that I put in so much personal effort to be a viable tank, but the guild would casually give tanking stuff to Fury Warriors who didn't care about tanking.
---
Yes they are a dps increase **if** the target can live for most of the dots duration.
---
If the target dies early then it is a dps decrease to use rip/rake.
---
Don't play a PvP game.
---
**Soon**

can't find this, could you give me a link?

Tailoring skinning while levelling, switching skinning to herb at 60. Keep heavy leather and rugged leather for when silithus stuff comes since you need it for rockfury bracers which is arguably bis the entire game. If you get t2.5 or better you can safely drop tailoring for engineering. Its also possible to never go herb and go engineering but you kinda want some form of income then like strat living farm with lbs split, selling felcloth, gathering alt etc.
---
I would but none of my friends will be playing classic
---
What guild is this? This exact thing happened to me lol
---
Here’s the guide I used tho (this guy is a genius) 
---
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jumRwtDrqaiFwGd6zr6v2sZvQh7iniTDuzZLjmSpGAc/mobilebasic
---
Is it? I don't have to pay real money to play classic wow now.
---
Is that a function on retail? Did it really turn out bad?
---
Compared to other vanilla videos this one held up surprisingly well. That was fun to watch lol.
---
Thex is your ingame name aswell?
---
Stay hidden, kill them before they kill you, intimidation factor, vastly out-level them. Shadowmeld is pretty helpful for the first option. If you shadowmeld before they notice you, there's a super high chance they'll not notice and wizz on by.
---
I really like this version of Troll. Badass.
---
good question tbh. i tried searching for some lists and didnt really find shit to help you. i learned most by just following along during beta and such but at this point ive forgotten most. Nothing really game changing of course.
---
What is the best case scenario for gold making with fishing? Can you even go over 30 G/h?
---
Shadow meld won’t work in combat in classic. It’s pretty common to gank when someone is already in combat so nelf wont benefit you much there.
---
If you are gonna roll on pvp server you are going to get ganked as an ally warrior. So try not to worry about it too much. Try to get your trinket asap and just roll with the punches. 
---
I think you’re probably better off going dwarf. You can remove poisons, bleeds AND blind saving your trinket for breaking stun.
---
Sorry, Thex is the name I roll with, I'll be taking that name on as many servers as I can get.
---
Suh dudes
---
My plan is to go Orc Shammy 30/0/21. I wanna PvP but also not suck at raids where I plan to heal. Professions are gonna be skinning / herbalism and then alchemy / herbalism once I get my epic mount.
---
How does my plan sound?
---
Im considering doing mining and engineering because apparently engineering is god-tier, but I don’t know how I’d finance the profession.
---
So perhaps creating a community of inclusivity would open up the avenues for more woman to play games. Comments like yours do just the opposite and more harm than good.

My wife told me about the date it opens and I told her flat out "no one is picking the names I've got in mind". I'd say them here but that...... well, you know.

You ever think the reason your getting denied is because of this? Don't find a new job and bring it to your current job as leverage.  Ask for a raise you think is fair for multiple reasons if they deny you just leave for the new job, don't mention you have an offer in the request.
---
I have no idea what you are trying to show here
---
Some of the mid level blue enchanting mats will sell for 1-2g, even on a fresh server. 
---
Play however you want, it does take some time or addons to figure out what to DE and what to vender. Might be worth it to learn, might be better to just cruise past it and vender everything.
---
Not even the slightest (acid fixed that for me).  
---
I just see people on this sub mention their job pretty often, so I felt like making a joke this time around.
---
You wanna come over bro?
---
for clothies I think enchanting and tailoring are pretty satisfying since you can make your first wand and there are several good greens you get well before quest rewards start giving stats.  
---
Engineering can be fun since you can make cool stuff that actually helps you along the way.  It's expensive though so if you don't mind leveling slow by trying to farm mats as you go it might be an option.  I never get in a rush and I don't always have more than an hour or two to play so sometimes i spend my time farming mats and leveling professions instead of just grinding out quests and xp
---
Yea you're completely wrong here. Hunters are very strong DPS in Phase 1 and 2. They only fall off after BWL because AQ has no really strongly optimized weapons for them and their pet has no scaling.
---
Remember that being ganked is merely a small inconvenience and just keep rolling like nothing happened if someone is pvping in the area or camping you go somewhere else.
---
Flex?
---
Considering that’s only 4 months, that’s already not bad for a casual player.
---
I doubt I’ll make it by end of December

---
There are some pretty significant differences between those results and reality on private servers. Compared to the class statistics of the last big pserver, you've got stuff like shaman jumping from 5th most popular to 2nd, rogue from 3rd to 7th and priest from 6th to 3rd. Hunter's drop is expected given how messy they were in the beta, but most classes weren't so different in the beta that it should lead to huge swings in popularity. After all, the majority of people who took the survey have played on those same servers.

If he is the gang king, it's going to be hard to prevent him from doing whatever the hell he pleases.

You cant transfer gold between retail and classic though...? If anything you could just farm gold in retail to not pay for classic, which isn't a big deal.
---
I'm sick at home for two weeks for a pretty serious case of scarlet fever now (don't get this **** as an adult).

ONE MONTH TOO EARLY! -.-

Perfect! Then i will get even lower fps.

We are getting patch 1.12 which I believe was way past when they changed flights to no longer be single-leg though this will be long before they added the additional flight points(both location-to-location and actual new griffon locations such as goldshire) and a ton of other QoL improvements that happened over Vanilla such as key ring &amp; updated talents.
---
No dungeon finder, no dual spec, far lower mat stacks, no heirlooms, no dailies, horde only shaman/alliance only paladins, weapon skills, no crossrealm sharding(and only temporary in realm sharding at launch), no flying, no arenas/RBGs, ect...
---
If you are looking for Vanilla wow but re-imagined through modern wow's lens that's not what's going down.
---
I know you are getting crap from a lot of the responses but as someone who played back then to the point of burnout several times I completely understand recoiling at the thought of playing it again.  Honestly I tried out a pserver a couple months back and had a mixed reaction...on one side was that recoil I mentioned and there was a bit of wonder at the little things I forgot about such as working out mana needed for mobs and tracking respawns, planning out when to go to each area to avoid dealing with orange+ mobs and a surprising amount of quests I forgot about.
---
I've debated with myself about playing it and I've pretty much accepted the fact that I'll play it at some point so screw it...once more into the server launch race I go
---
Not that I know of. There is one for mages which is where I got the idea from; but, that's the only other one that I know of.
---
Tell me about it! Im lucky to get four! FOUR!
---
That's unfortunate. Oh well, I'll get it eventually. Ty anyway though.
---
Would be pretty shit if something would happen to you on your way to the dungeon wouldnt it?
---
All one word, only first letter is capital
---
Y'all are dumb. They meant "why would you tell them (this sub) about the band reservation date?"

Tauren

Hmmm do I play on the coke or pepsi server?
---
That feeling when you make your first few leveling/dungeon pals and you run like 5 in a row...the best.
---
Tauren, aoe stun is nice and starting thunderbuff is super cool.
---
Booooo
---
Classic has the best pixels! Great Pixels. So great!
---
found the tauren hater.
---
Because everyone started noticing he had very buff possible whenever he went in to bg’s so it wasn’t impressive, from what I heard anyway
---
I will miss the Timeless Isle, i like to chill there
---
I don't think you'll be able to see that right at registration, I actually can't remember if the colour thing was in Vanilla or not but that does ring a bell.
---
The easiest way to do it I guess would be to go:
---
Region &gt; Cool Name &gt; High:Med:Low in determining the highest player counts (for your area), I believe high/med usually have the most active players on them. Servers with the 'coolest' names are generally the ones that most people go on but that's so esoteric to guess during registration it wouldn't help much.
---
Lol right, I feel that. Just seems like an even bigger time sink into 1 game that’s already a massive time sink lol.
---
Gnomes anything&gt;anything else
---
That's my ganking prio
---
Swapping to alchemy earlier (shortly after hitting 60?) might net more gold than skinning if you can get some rare recipes and help you get your epic mount quicker
---
Doing a LAN with my closest WoW mate for 6days, it will be a blast!
---
Your hand painted your future character. 
---
Nice!
---
The OP is Mike Tyson. "Let's all have Thex together!"
---
In fact they are the best pixels youve ever seen, trust me!
---
I'm gonna strap my laptop to myself like an old timey cigarette vendor
---
someone made a post asking what people were going to be naming their characters, he was going to be a troll shaman named thex. everyone memed that we'll all make that character now. and here u have it. this is the point we're at now.
---
Agreed, but you probably would want to take the corresponding gathering prof to go along with each, not level with both alch and eng
---
Why does that matter
---
To those posting "whats the point", clearly its to show how overly complex the game can get as you progress. 
---
The point is totally valid.
---
Some people think its overkill and hurts the spirit of game.
---
Others like the complexity and what additional features those mods add.
---
Both are probably right.
---
If I could I would photoshop the simpson's Bort name plate to Thex
---
All enemy faction is KoS, even if you fail it was worth it to send a message
---
How about your moderator shoves his fist up his bum WITH effort
---
No clue, I just heard a lot of people in streams saying he wasn’t as impressive as people thought because of all the buffs, I’m just using that as the reason no one else said him
---
Warrior is the BG king
---
I've watched that show twice all the way through and never noticed that. Nice.
---
Why exactly? I’m all for women playing games if they want to, actually it’s kinda cool when they do but that doesn’t really change the fact that compared to guys not a lot of women play, or they play extremely casually which is of course also fine. The women/girls I’ve met through my life simply do not have much interest in playing video games at all and I would assume it’s the same most other places and they shouldn’t be forced to do so if the interest simply isn’t there.
---
What does that even mean? BFA client, not BFA textures.
---
Exactly the information I am looking for. Thanks in advance.
---
Best pixels, everyone agrees.
---
But the op stun resist :(
---
&gt; I agree that phase 2 will be a shitshow, and I’m looking forward to it!
---
It sounds cool in a "wohoo, mayhem!" kind of way, but I'm pretty sure the community will explode over it. Once people get the Tarren Mill battles out of their system and realize that even weeks into the phase they still can't do anything at all without bringing a whole crew of players, people will start to go nuts and all forums and subreddits will be drowning in complaints about how the game has become almost literally unplayable. 
---
And they won't necessarily be wrong about that. As much as we espouse the ideal of vanilla's sociality, WoW becomes an intensely terrible game if it isn't possible to do anything whatsoever on your own. If there's a huge drop-off of players in Classic, I think it'll happen a month into phase 2.
---
Human Mage. Quickest to get to SW. Quick to level to 35 for Ench
---
No one I know plays anymore but this sounds awesome. Might try to get an old co-worker friend who played a bit to resub with me
---
Guess I'm rolling troll shaman named Thex now
---
Yeah, cause the only real difference between retail and vanilla is dual specs and transmogs.
---
I agree that there shouldn't be additions to classic, but it's fucking stupid to see people say this. You're not going to have the talent trees of vanilla in retail, you aren't going to have the dungeon experience as classic, and you aren't going to have the same pvp experience as classic. They're 2 completely different games, playing retail isn't the answer to wanting a non-mechanical feature added to classic.
---
pve server
---
Skip any rank of psychic scream past 1-2 (you don’t really need the ability to fear an extra 1-2 mobs as the only thing the rank ups change for fear is the number of mobs feared). 
---
You can also skip levitate as it requires light feathers to use (I grab it bc on a pvp server you can run to the water + levitate for more space if you get engaged on).
---
You can skip mind soothe entirely (optional, but I only ever used it if I was sneaking around trying to do a quest without killing mobs) as well as rank 2 cleanse disease (rank 2 makes it dispel another disease every 5 sec for 15 sec iirc which isn’t needed while levelling). If you’re levelling as shadow (while also healing dungeons) you can completely skip smite/holy fire once you get a wand (more efficient to just SWP -&gt; MB -&gt; wand than to smite/etc.)
---
If you want to cut corners, you can also skip every rank past rank 1 of resurrection.
---
Honestly, priests tend to want a lot of their skills due to us usually healing in leveling dungeons even if we’re shadow. Rule of thumb is grab your healing spells, inner fire, pws, and offensive abilities.
---
She laughs now, just wait till she figures out she's lost the top spot on the important things to spend time on list.
---
4k is overrated, requires a beefy graphics card to play any modern games (ofc i dont mean Classic WoW). Do yourself a favor and get a 1440p monitor with a high refresh rate and Gsync/Freesync. Generally they will come with a lot more features than the 4k monitor. Also, if you really wanted to, you can run 4k on your 1440p monitor using Nvidia DSR.
---
Hey Guys, I am having a big dilemma. 
---
In Vanilla and on some not so legal servers I played Hunter. I have leveled a hunter on Horde and Alliance side and know the class in it and out. There is a lot of nostalgia factor with play a Hunter. 
---
With that in mind I am thinking about rolling a warlock. I love the pet classes and I know warlocks are very powerful and a unique class when it comes to its PVP play style.
---
Has anybody else had this debate? Choosing between a warlock and a hunter?
---
Thanks for your thoughts. Isn't 1.12 post-PvP ranks? Like, AV and such?
---
addiction and hobbies you're passionate about aren't the same, though
---
But BFA shadows, effects etc.
---
How about an ultrawide with 144hz instead?
---
I couldn't find much either. Thanks for posting.
---
I came for this comment, was not disappointed.

Are you a giver or a taker? Do you want to be able to take a beating or give one? No need to resist stun if your foes are dead.

If their analysts tell them they can make more money/ drive up their stock options more by adding tokens and cash store, it will go live very quickly. You might argue that it would kill the game over the long-term, but that won’t matter. What matters is how it affects the income of the shareholders, because the company has a fiduciary obligation to them, and none to the players.
---
They have lost over half the player base since they switched from adding extra items you could earn in-game to adding extra cash store items, TCGs, and bonuses for 6mo/1yr subs, and adding the token system. They believed they would make more money from the extra transactions than they would lose in subs. More cash with fewer servers to maintain. They were wrong, so now they are making Classic servers to get subs back up. If someone makes the right graph to convince Activision they can milk Classic with the cash store, you’ll see tons of fake forum posts from “players” demanding those mounts because they don’t affect gameplay. That makes it look like they were listening to players when they bend you over.
---
Oh nice. 
---
Yeah, it kinda depends what recipes I’m able to pick up at that time.
---
How far behind engineering would you say alchemy is?
---
Yeah, I meant instant-cast in the sense that it doesn't have a cast time, not necessarily a spell specifically.  I thought about Shaman tbh, but really don't think I have the energy to manage totems, and I really don't want to be pigeon-holed into healing at max level.  I know the Ele Hybrid spec is a thing, but I like more fluid rotations, and less big burst/multiple CD management type specs.
---
Warlock is pretty set rotation with fishing for Nightfall procs and throwing out instant-cast curses/dots.  
---
Hunter I really just have to stand still when autoshot is actually about to fire, and then just aimed shot.  All other abilities are instant (arcane, concussive, viper, serpent, etc...).
---
144+hz &gt; 4K
---
But yes, it'll look awesome
---
Dual spec.  Being able to play two different specs without spending tons of gold is a lot of fun.  But I understand the problems that come with it.
---
My god, how did people clear the content back then?
---
WoW classic is best played on a 720p netbook
---
Looks like a decent spot to gank Nelves.
---
do we know that's possible tho? can we delete char and name won't be locked?
---
The fact that bear druid stats work in a weird way can be fun - for example, leveling enchanting and doing the solo-run to the crafting spot in BRD to make your Smoking Heart of the Mountain gives you a sense of personal accomplishment. And you definitely have a sense of stat-increase with a bear tank, due to the multipliers. The biggest obstacle is getting your guild to understand how the class works as a tank, and be willing to give you tanking pieces that you need.
---
Some of these seem vaguely familiar, but I'd argue the three true WoW celebrities of Vanilla were all PvP celebs. All of them mentioned here at least once so far.
---
* Ming, female human rogue
---
* Vurtne,undead mage
---
* Pat, tauren warrior
---
I'd even argue that Ming's popularity had a lot to do with there being a metric ton of female humans at the top of Arena ladders when race/gender changes were introduced around the same time as the concept of Arena itself in the TBC/WOTLK years.
---
I played on a very tiny unknown server called Lethon in late TBC/WOTLK (and the realm wasn't even around in Vanilla)... and when High Warlord Pat came back to play again 4-5 years later he chose Lethon and we were friendly with each other.
---
He chose our server because it was one of the only ones the name Pat was still available on. But he wasn't quite as dominant anymore "later in life" with new mechanics and Arena concepts vs. BGs.

Swifty on Copy/Paste macro
---
I don't know...considering how quick it is to get through content in Retail I don't think it'll be.  Either way, most of your time in Classic will be at the start since we don't know if they'll do OSRS style new content or do TBC/Wrath servers.  So basically right now the next raid they release for retail might be the only pinch that I can guess.
---
I suppose it also depends on whether you play retail casually or if you raid and also want to raid in classic AND whether or not you are running with the same crew or not.
---
I don't see Blizzard ever releasing content at the same time for both as well
---
I've never subbed on my current blizzard acct and I was able to for some reason.
---
because more height = more better
---
Leveling section. Spells to train... am I confused here? It says red=do not train. Rebirth, moonfire, frenzied regen, huh?
---
I do love my hunter, and the hunter class has always been my favorite in any game.  I'm just not sure how perfectly I need to execute the rotation to be decent.  I'm older now, have kids running at me interrupting me, put in long hours at work and want to come home and just relax.  I'm not sure how on my Ps and Qs I need to be to do Hunter things in classic vs something like a Lock that just face tanks everything and hits things off cooldown/when they run out.
---
That is a valid entry, correct.
---
I wish you good luck on your journeys, Booooo

What database did you take the reputation values from? It has been proven that reputation values on all ManGos-based private servers (all of them) have reputations from a post-tbc patch which basically doubles reputation gains from most quests 1-60. In classic you wont get enough reputation for the mount even if you do all darnassus-tagged quests all the way to 60.
---
For sure. My wife is also supportive, she knows every few years I go on a huge gaming binge when a new game I'm really looking forward to comes out. I basically go into isolation for 2-4 weeks and she'll bring me food or just check in with me periodically. Once I've gotten through a lot of the end game "setup" I'll get back to a more regular schedule where I raid once or twice a week, do dungeons/world stuff casually and go back to spending time with her regularly. 
---
If you have to hide things from your SO or are in fear of ridicule or wrath from talking to your wife about your hobbies and passions you need to re-evaluate your relationship (or get help for a problem you have)
---
Who?

this! maybe a lot of girls find the gaming world alien because they feel alienated and out of place in it. the gaming community isn't a friendly place for a lot of people, women included.

comments like this are just fucking dumb because sometimes it is just a dumb joke, but other times it's men who look like they're seriously about to force their wife to be a full-time mother/chef/maid while they dump all their time into a fucking game

Most didn't

Omg, thank you for posting that gem. Ahh, the nostalgia feels. I loved that video back then! Still love it
---
I wonder if she would let you laugh in her face about the Bachelorette finale.
---
I actually did a count of all the current WoW servers to determine which ones are full:
---
EDT = 10 full servers
---
CDT = 11 full servers
---
PDT = 3 full servers
---
Given this data, clearly EDT &amp; CDT servers are most popular in terms of numbers of players.  
---
Does anyone know what time raids normally start and end?

Nothing
---
Yep, but god-forbid they take a step back a realize how what they say may offend others, but you know they're all for feeeemales playing games, we're just not allowed to complain when they marginalize us.
---
Literally everyone uses them on pservers and the gameplay of private servers is what is going to determine how classic plays.
---
Thanks
---
If we define ganking as attacking someone who has a clear disadvantage, then you just have to make sure you never have a clear disadvantage. The level-based disadvantage you can try and fix by not venturing into contested zones close after every 10 levels. So try and enter STV at 35-36 instead of 30 and so on. 
---
Numbers disadvantage is the easiest one, just stick around in a group. If your friends are not online, make a group. Then add them to your friends list and enjoy the epic social community that exists in Classic. 
---
Busy-with-a-mob disadvantage has the same solution as the numbers; stick around in a group.
---
Or fun in the comment thread. THANKS DAD
---
You read it right... that's correct. You don't need any of those spells for solo leveling. You can't res yourself with Rebirth. Won't be using moonfire in cat form (can be ok as a pre-pull but not that great), and you'll be in cat form for leveling, not bear, so won't use frenzied regen. Be sure to read the disclaimer at the top left of that section:   
---
"*Please keep in mind that following this guide at a 100% accuracy is ONLY considering solo feral leveling and won't guarantee the best results, maybe there will be a lot of PvP activity on your server or you want to do dungeons and it might be a good idea to learn spells that you would otherwise skip. Use good judgement.* "

Straight into the morning invisibility engineer trinket. Log off when visible to wait for CD’s

Oh I fully agree - I think anyone who isn’t 60 by phase 2 is in for a REALLY bad time in the 50+ zones. Even the 60s will be in for a rude awakening as it’ll be very tough to even just try to herb/mine for gold/raid consumes in the open world. Server imbalances will start to rear their heads in phase 2 which could cause major problems for certain server populations down the line as people will quit if they see their faction outnumbered everywhere they go.
---
I think one saving grace though is that since DM comes out at the same time, there will be much more possibilities for instanced farming (dme jump runs/etc.). But that assumes that people will even be able to enter DM as that place will be a massive battlefield at the start of p2.
---
&gt; optional, but I only ever used it if I was sneaking around trying to do a quest without killing mobs
---
Which you shouldn't do, because you will almost always have to grind a bit every zone or so.  Should always be pulling and killing on the way between places too.  So it just makes no sense unless you need it for dungeon cheese, which is not common while lvling.
---
Alchemy is a no-brainer money maker, and engineering is closer to blacksmithing as a money pit/net zero/do it for yourself kind of profession. It can certainly make money in larger chunks, but alchemy is really easy to make money with. I think most people level with professions other than eng, then switch to it to make what they want for themselves for pvp, dungeons, and raiding.
---
Yeah, I don't really understand the immersion argument myself. I don't see how having to manually fly from flight point to flight point adds more "immersion" than having them connected. Dual speccing takes away from immersion because you're supposed to be *that* spec of that class, and it's unrealistic to be two jobs at once.... having 5000 arrows with dozens of potions and others sets of equipment are fine though.

Raid times really depend on the guild and when they are playing (weeks/weekends). 
---
I find most week night raids are 6/7 pm to 10/11pm. Weekend raiding is usually 11am-3pm with the guys I've played with but again it is so guild dependent. All EST
---
I knew for sure it's possible in TBC, but I've also heard people say it works in vanilla. Proof would be good, though
---
Builds, rotations, gear, role and consumeables are covered. 
---
Different playstyles and races aswell.
---
I don't remember their names, but two Alliance characters tried to gank a mage in Tanaris. Mage jumped off the cliff into Un'goro, used slow fall and obviously survived.
---
The two Alliance plummeted to their deaths but got trolled on the official forums where they doubled-down that they were merely testing their Engineering parachutes.
---
The forums were a shit-show back then, but every once in a while a true gem like that pops up.
---
I don't think it's fair to say most guilds, some guilds perhaps. That's a shit spec that nobody wants to play. I'd rather have a dedicated shadow priest that loves the spec than someone reluctantly running a shit spec.
---
Probably Shaman. I can't wait to roll my Shaman - Thex.
---
“Not as fast as in retail.”
---
And your support for that argument is?
---
Shurrik is the reason I rolled a rogue in vanilla as well. I re-watched this not too long ago and I was cringing so hard. I thought he was so good back then. Back then, I didn't even realize that paladin was keyboard turning and thought he just owned him.
---
Jeez.
---
Edit: Probably still rolling a rogue this time cuz of shurrik
---
A pserver literally went from launch to naxx within a year and it worked out fine, so massive delays between content release is definitely not necessary (although I would prefer it).
---
right? it's crazy to me that he didn't even acknowledge WHY a woman might feel awkward in the gaming community, hes literally just like ''oh heh heh these femoids are another species that cannot possibly comprehend our complex games''
---
Ah that's so cute you think that.
---
Great read I appreciate you for sharing. Might try this trick out on my mage dad
---
Did very little thinking about this tbh. So here is my rambling stream of consciousness. Would start off with guildies and friends. Definitely would have some parameters that the person would have to pass. They would have to be in a guild, they would have to have main that logged significant hours. I would need a running list of people who rented from me so I can put them on blast in major cities/chats if they don't return the items or pay up. Probably a 2 or 3 week rental window. Could have them pay up 2x the rental price then return them their deposit when items are returned. Would I try to friend the other faction so they could go and corpse camp the defaulter for a fee? Maybe..probably not. This overall would be a fun social experiment that will lose a lot of gold.

My char name in vanilla was Dalamar so I will claim part fame
---
Woah brothawoah now, you got too much dip on yuh chip
---
Yep, Nurfed and some other top guilds decided to roll on the pvp server that was first in alphabetical order, which just happened to be Archimonde. Unfortunately, the overehelming population created too much stress, so it ended up going down for a couple of days not long after launch. A few guilds rerolled on other servers, and Blizzard eventually offered free transfers to Mug'thol and another realm. Archimonde could have been one of the great servers like Tich or Medivh, but it wasn't meant to be.
---
You don't need every pull. There are a very finite number of types of mobs.
---
In that instance, you are more likely to wipe on trash than the bosses. Spending 10 minutes talking about bosses and loot is a waste.
---
It is hyperbolic and strawmanning to say that I asked for 30 minutes explaining every pull as well.
---
While the blue PvP set is pretty great for PvE warriors, you'd usually want 2-3 pieces only. Specifically, Gloves and Boots are preBiS level at best, and the helm, while not bad on it's own, looks pretty bad compared to Lionheart's. The chest piece is okay, worse than Savage Gladiator Chain though. The shoulders beat Truestrike at least, quite a bit behind T2.5. The legs are pretty great until Titanics become available. The 2pc set bonus is really what makes it viable.
---
If you could get your hands on R12 gear, both Legs and Boots are amazing items for warriors.
---
I'm 26 and have had several long term girlfriends with my current being almost 4 years now.  
---
Whenever I see posts asking how to get your significant other into video games it makes me cringe so hard.  I do a ton of activities with my girlfriend, but I don't push her into doing anything.  If the significant other WANTS to get into gaming, she'll show some interest.  
---
Every time I see this question being asked I read it as, "How can I make someone like something they don't like?"  I talk with my girlfriend about WoW and video games in general.  She engages me in conversation, but she's only doing so because I enjoy it.  I can easily recognize that and don't push her to, "just try it," because she isn't going to like it.  You are allowed to have separate hobbies, I figured that having some hobbies shared with your SO goes without saying... You'd have to have something in common unless you wouldn't be together in the first place.
---
Yeah, I think there may be a use for it with certain quests where there are elites around that you don’t want to engage, but even then it’s not needed. The spell having a target level cap which requires you to rank it up further to use it at higher levels also makes it a lot worse to get while leveling due to the money you need to spend to keep training it.
---
I had a friend of mine back on Madoran who ended up taking his own life, he went by the name Killercloud. in his memory i coined his name when i faction changed to horde so now i will probably go by Killercloud on classic.
---
I don't disagree with anything you've said, but I don't play any modern PC games. Just WOW (here soon) and like *Cuphead*. Maybe some *Albion Online*.
---
The primary purpose of the monitor will be for photo editing and reading documents, but of course I'll also play these games too, if somewhat sporadically.
---
[Buzz Killington](https://youtu.be/y39P8PsGCNI)
---
I agree.  People keep saying that everyone is so much better now, but typically that isn't really the problem.  As people point out the rotations are very simple in raids so how is skill going to help there?  The "difficult" things in WoW were getting enough players and having them geared.  Classic is not mechanically difficult by any means but there are still more than enough bad players and getting geared still takes a lot of time.
---
needs more chicken.
---
Does elemental go trispec?  What do you do about losing imp cs if not?  Seems like big gimp to pvp power.
---
If you want burst you are probably looking at rogue.  Warlock can burst in destro too though, so that flexibility is there, but I think a rogue is more about finding your rhythm and bursting than warlock is (warlock is more of a decision tree playstyle, since you have a lot of different tools).
---
I dont know much about druid or pally dps though.  Healing can be fun in pvp though, if you like it then you should consider it, since pally is almost too OP in pvp healing situations.
---
Okay. So would I even need skinning? I’d imagine Alchemy has some start up costs.
---
No, I say you're wrong.
---
Dont even know who he is and I was there in Vanilla.
---
Exactly where I'm at with this.  Warrior was my first ever character and was also my main all through my wow "career". (Probably \~400 days /played over 10+ years)
---
Since then, I have a full time job, (40-55 hours a week) a wife and 2 toddlers.  I'll realistically get to play anywhere from 6-10 hours during the week and another 6-10 during weekends.
---
Part of me wants to go Warrior and push through the hardships but part of me wants to go Warlock for ease and convenience with my time/schedule; I just feel like I'll kick myself in the ass if I pick Warlock over Warrior. /shrug
---
edit: I plan on PvPing mainly, going for rank 10 blues. (Anything above rank 11 is probably out of the question for me) I may jump into the occasional raid when my schedule is open.
---
Stop trolling around
---
I had to scroll too far down to see this name.  Best paladin.

Ah then yeah, if your primary purpose is photo editing yeah get a 4k monitor.

Ctrl+F gave no results, Laintime!

A couple discord communities have made charts of what spells to buy when, but if you want something generic you can look up the spell list on classic wowhead, add in the following filters with an OR condition:
---
- show max rank  
---
- show where rank = 0
---
This will give you a list of skills at their max rank, plus any skills that have no rank (like summons or whatever else you buy only once).
---
Bone apple tea.
---
I can probably raid 8pm (9pm would be better) till 2am ET.
---
I wonder if I should go with a CT server which would fit these times better?
---
This time we have Thex.
---
He said that he is!
---
Hey, me too
---
I'll play with you over discord, if you plan on playing horde.
---
There is this little quote i like: either you will change the world around you, or the world will change you
---
Its even funnier when idiots say because it happened on a private server it will happen in actual classic. They didn't have mobs working correctly, correct proc coefficients, correct skill coefficients, or even actual vanilla drop tables. 
---
All the window lickers talking about their private server haven't actually played vanilla.
---
Cool
---
Cold turkey
---
Idk man I check this sub every day for answers and nobody knows
---
I would guess those people are raiding like once a week or something. If I had a family I would just make a deal with the SO that certain night each week they take over the kids and then I'll do the same for them on another night.
---
7PM was 100% the most common raid start time but you'll find guilds going earlier and later no problem.
---
Part of me wants to take the day off from work and take part.  The rest of me expects some part of the server to be overloaded, so most of us will somehow be locked out or just staring at our frozen casting animations.
---
More than likely, I bet there were a TON of requests that weekend, it’s Labor Day which most people take off for.
---
He was probably like, “well.... not everyone can take off... so no one gets to take off, problem solved”
---
Weird Thex, but okay
---
 [Maize...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLXVkVXr9rs)
---
would it work as an offtank for a raid?
---
Will we only be allowed to name 3 characters total across all servers that will be made available? This is gonna be rough.
---
It looks like Blizzard only has 2 data centers, Chicago and Los Angeles. 
---
So no east coast data centers.   EDT or CDT servers will have the same ping.
---
I care stupid, so shut up.

---
Yeah just know it’s sometime this month oh well
---
Right. Thanks
---
at this point they could lose just as many people as theyd gain by removing it.
---
Which gets me into another dilema, who should decide the future of a game? the players or the designers?
---
&gt;Mimicking better players than you won't make you good.
---
Yes it does. That's literally how all learning is made. You start out by learning all that is known already, then you improve on it. Science students learn about the discovers of previous great scientists, chess students study the moves and openers of famous chess players, you don't learn playing chess by just learning how the game works and finding out all the things on your own.
---
400-600g a raid? Get out of here no way
---
Ah, right. Luckily being in Canada Chicago is a pretty standard EDT point for most servers/games!
---
Yeah if raid times are 7pm-11pm, I'm 100% going CDT server.
---
Thanks for your help.
---
good meme but Thex is a troll shaman you fucking infidel, seize him!
---
Have fun camping Flight Paths all day long, cause that's what all the "hardcore PvPers" will be doing
---
How do we reserve names? Do we need a subscription to current wow?
---
That shows the time until launch in one format: dd:hh:mm:ss
---
This guy's timer shows time until launch in five formats:
---
total days, total hours, total minutes, total seconds and total milliseconds
---
So it's not the same thing
---
Sure there will be withdrawal symptoms, but in the end everyone will be the better for it
---
The problem is that Happiness is a really hard stat to sim (super unpredictable proc rate). However, any build with 0% WoW is definitely Trash Tier.
---
That or summerbreak from school.
---
I think it’s hilarious you think classic is going to smaller then BFA.
---
Pretty much the same build as the flag carrier build I posted but I had points in Feline Swiftness and reflection in mine. There are minor changes people can make and they're honestly all fine to use. The major talents are there though. Druid just has so many options for builds it's hard to take into account EVERY viable build. Spreadsheet is meant to be more of a rough guideline that people can follow. Definitely encouraged for people to make their own informed changes based on their playstyle.
---
Strange how even complete strangers to classic can start playing pservers and complete content because all the information is out there for you.. wonder how that works.
---
R14 is achievable in phase 2.
---
This is why I don't take launch days off anymore, for any game. There are bound to be server issues, frustration, immense over-crowding... I like to take a Monday/Tuesday the following week off and get rolling.
---
so it should be the designers. (not publishers or players)
---
Clearly activision needs to go
---
I'm quite certain the point of his videos were to show the power of a warrior fully buffed and with pocket heals, he even thanks them in the video. For me it was when I found out he botted and most likely botted rank 14.
---
They will all be variations of thex
---
Yeah, totally, they're just greedy assholes doing it for the money, spending countless man hours in a product for a niche audience, only to intentionally let it fail
---
definitely
---
Ask the mods if they'll let you do an AMA lol
---
What are you even talking about
---
Model detail will be sharp and crisp.  The game will render in a 4k resolution.  Basically a really good anti-aliasing and no jaggies.  Sure, texture resolution is still going to be really low.  But I wouldn't say it's entirely going to be bad.  There are plenty of games that get the 4k treatment on Xbox backwards compatibility and look much better in 4k.

Being married doesn t mean you have a life. Hell I'd argue you have less of a life.
---
you loose, rage regen, 3% crit, 10% damage, omen. Thats alot of threat + why would they want a feral tank, if you cant give the raid crit ?  Then they can just get another warrior instead, who will do a better job early on.
---
Not only is it alot of threat, but it changes your stat prio, since you will need to gear to make up for it. And looseing out on mitigation instead.
---
With AQ gear it works, because you dont have that same "trade" of TPS vs Mitigation, since you have gear stats enough to make up for it,
---
Now: with that said early HOTW, sure it can work. But you can oom your healers or you get clapped.

Why does she get a say in your hobbies?

Of course, Activision care only about the button line. But as for the designers. I'm afraid the old developers are gone now. But one thing baffles me. Ion was a player back in the day, how can someone molded from the glory days derail the game so much as a game director?
---
Why go through all the problems of buying and selling the token and trading the gold, when I can just buy the gold directly in classic. I'm going to need a 3rd party no matter what so it's easier just to skip the first steps and buy the gold directly from him.

There were a lot of class specific celebrities. Drakedog was a big warlock name for his world PvP videos playing specs that weren't popular and very skill dependent.

Yep, it's a viable option on both horde and alliance.

True, but the line is very grey sometimes. I think it becomes an addiction when you use a drug to escape something. That drug can be anything really. The addiction isn't necessarily bad, but what you give up to sustain it usually is.

The idea of mythic+. 
---
I say the idea, because it's good in concept and even for a while in practice. But the pug scene brings out the absolute worst aspects of retail community, and organized just turns into an ilvl/socket slot machine.
---
You want improved lifetap when going DS/Ruin.
---
I hope and think that when/if I reach that point in my life, that'll keep playing the latest games. Rehashing my childhood games makes me rather depressed because it reminds of how much time has gone by so quickly. WoW is the exception as it'll be my last serious multiplayer, but I like to experience new things. I hope that I'll never turn into an old fart that stops embracing new experiences and starts saying that 'he's too old for x' or 'it's too late for me \[to do x\]'.

But you already are seeing it now in retirement homes, that in some countries the elderly get courses there on how to use an iPad and how to navigate on the web. Videochat by the way is a revolution ongoing right now for the elderly to reduce loneliness.

It's not better, it's worse. It takes you to Kharanos, which sucks if you're trying to speed level, and that's the main reason to use something like this. Playing normally you may as well just go to Stormwind and tram to IF.
---
This is decidedly untrue for at least some people, including me, as far as *nothing* having enough pixels. At normal viewing distances, I can easily tell the difference between the same ***plain text*** at 4K versus FHD. The difference in photographs is night and day.
---
But ironically, I think that today's vector-drawn fonts have many more dots per inch than the graphics of Vanilla WOW did. LOL. So I kinda doubt I'll see a difference here in Classic.
---
It’s not rly an argument, it’s a fact.
---
In retail you can go from being a fresh 120 to raid ready with a little help from friends in about 4 hours(quite possibly less). There’s no way you can gear that fast in classic
---
Atheist gluten intolerant vegan horde players who just started crossfit with their chihuahua service dog while being an ironman that vapes.
---
No word on that either. My guess is they won’t release them prior to name creation which is disappointing.
---
I want to play paladin but not in any ordinary way. I want to smash with a 2-hander, but I also want to throw holy stuff at friends and foes. What does a decent leveling spec for this look like? Thinking holy/ret mix, I want the best of both worlds please help
---
Why would i bring a boomkin or a retpaladin when i can bring someone who actually contributes to the raid? Why should some people be allowed to freeload on people who spec optimally to contribute as much as possible to a raid? That is not fair to the rest of the raid at all.
---
what about all the mages and fury warriors that are sacrificing their aoe and pvp specs to push out as much dps as possible. is it fair to them? no. memespecs are incredibly selfish. and selfish people dont get loot.
---
I have quite a few activision shares and listened to the earnings call. Activision spoke a lot more about 8.2 dropping than they did classic, it was hardly a footnote. They have all the research, I don’t understand how anyone can really think classic will be anywhere near retail
---
Why do you need a third? Say you want to buy some gold and a guild mate offers some game time. You can directly buy it from him by transfering gold in game.
---
LOL
---
It said don’t use hamstring and rend(rend ofc). But hamstring procing WF and gearing... I think this guide is a bit old /outdated
---
Yeah. Playing on Archimonde was rough. Lots of great guilds though (Nurfed, Void, Relentless) My guild chose to transfer to Dethecus when it was available. We were by far the most geared on that server until Nurfed transferred there too : /
---
I have to use my vacation within the calendar year.  If not, they just cut me an extra check for the time.

You seem really edgy for someone who doesn't know the answer to the most basic of questions.
---
i'll admit there is. there's almost too much to do actually. and it all feels pretty meaningless when the next patch that comes out invalidates your gear entirely. i mean shit, gear from reputations was obsolete by the time i could actually access it when i levelled to 120 during bfa launch..

Hey since someone at Blizzard apparently told you how long each phase lasts can you tell us the dates?

lol I told my wife too. She’s taking my daughter out of state on the 23rd of aug to visit family for 3 weeks. I’ll still work (other than the first 3 days of classic) but it still will feel like a vacay!!!

It's a 200IQ troll for sure.

---
Yes, the company that owns blizzard. They are called Activision-blizzard for a reason. If you think classic wow or any MMO for that matter will have anywhere near 13-14 million subs youre high
---
You are making a poor comparison. Of course jumping into retail right now has catch up mechanics, the expansion is 4 raids deep. Should you have to play for a year to gear up? It would be like hitting 60 when your friends have cleared AQ 40 and they carry you through a raid.
---
There is no way it is a fact that a vanilla raid is going to be harder at release or take longer to clear than a new retail raid.
---
Gearing up won’t even take as long, everyone knows where their BIS gear is from and every dungeon mechanic is known. The best specs and builds are already known. Not a single thing will be new to most players. Vanilla will be fun, but it won’t be difficult.
---
Yeah, true. I guess your only choice is to either wait to level 24 for a port or head back to ironforge whenever you want to learn new skills. Shouldn't be too hard since you will probably get all the flight points after your first trip.
---
Another redditer commeted on the post that I almost save 600 runecloth by doing Teldrassil quests. Thats many hours of farming in my opinion
---
Skirmisher?
---
I’ll check it out, ty for info
---
it's not though. many items are bis through multiple raid tiers. basically every class has items like this. every time a new raid comes out in retail they raise the ilvl so you have to go back and do the same fucking mythic + dungeons 20 times again just to upgrade your shit.
---
You remember it wrong.
---
&gt;Because everyone started noticing he had very buff possible whenever he went in to bg’s so it wasn’t impressive, from what I heard anyway
---
Eh, this was brought up when the video was released from time to time, but that didn't stop his popularity. As someone who played on Arthas when both his videos were released I can say with confidence our queue to play jumped significantly after his second video. 
---
It got so bad he made a forum post after he stopped playing as much pretty much telling everyone to stop /whispering him when he logged on because he didn't play as much as he used to and only got on to pass the time and grind a bit while listening to music.

I was fortunate enough to only run into him once in the battle grounds. It was AB and it was a pug vs their premade so we just said "fuck it" and decided to rush the stables. 
---
They must've known somehow because they were all literally waiting at their gate and rushed us when we all got there. He charged me, I got stunned and within 1-2 hits my health bar went from full to 0.

Pretty sure that was after he sold his account though but that didn't make his toon hit any less hard.

The attunes change weekly for M+ with a major change every patch so the dungeons are different constantly. The bis thing is sort of true up til AQ where everything takes a massive jump in power
---
I would give that title to Omar Gonzales.
---
Good.
---
Can this be pinned? 
---
Also, gonna name my main Thex
---
&gt;So i think getting the most RP per week should be fairly easy compared to phase 3
---
Doubt it, a general rule of pvp is that it always, ALWAYS gets easier over time. Early ranking will be tough at least if there's any hardcore presence on your server. 
---
As for how far you can get. The absolute minimum time to hit rank 14 from start is 12 weeks, this requires you get decently high standing week 1, and then hit bracket one(top 0.3% of total standing) either as standing 1 or with honor stacking(means essentially all the top players coordinate so everyone gets standing 1) for the rest of the 11 weeks. This is fairly plausible since if you can beat people one week, you can probably bet them the next. As for more normal human being approach usually you think about bracket 3, this is the top 0.8 to 2% of players. This bracket is usually not controlled by top end players so it's free for anyone to rank in
---
With consistent bracket 3 you get between 10k-11k rank points per week depending where you are in the 0.8-2%let me do some quick maths:
---
Lowest possible for 2 months: Rank 9
---
Lowest possible for 3 months: Just shy of rank 11
---
Highest possible for 2 months: Rank 11
---
Highest possible for 3 months: Rank 12 
---
At this point you are hardly making any progress because bracket 3 is just too low for that high rank. Basically the way it works is the higher rank the higher bracket you need to actually get any progress.
---
So yeah as an active pvper but not a top end, you can get around rank 10 just fine.
---
I was talking more about the duration, not attempt counts. You can't entirely make up for the fact that classic was a slower game than retail with just skill. What about bosses who, with the current gear you have, are mathematically impossible without sufficient gear from the raid they're in? What about the fact that fuck all gear drops for a 40 man raid? Even if the final bosses only take one attempt, they're still going to take a while to kill because people will still be gearing for that fight.
---

You can do that with anything though. Doesn’t mean they are actually linked.

OMG WOW TOKENS COMING TO VENDING MACHINES CONFIRMED
---
If goldsellers means tokens why did it take multiple expansions for them to do tokens? Like it was 8+ years before they did it. 
---
But according to you, if there’s gold sellers that means there’s tokens 🤔
---
Here we fucking go. Cringy WIFEY HUBBY posts start rolling in.
---
Gold sellers were in vanilla and they didn't ruin the game.
---
I wouldn't mind having a token, but I'm also not ignorant enough to agree with this logic.

Sounds like it needs some team effort then

---
I’m not really experiencing a lot of girls playing single player games either and there are no one to “act weird” around them there. 
---
I suppose it’s a matter of the people you surround yourself with. I’ve played with a few girls over the years and they’ve been treated like they would any other person, no acting weird except for some occasional incidents with some guild mates but that’s like in real life as well, not everyone is equally mature and not everyone is a nice person.

WoW peaked at 12 mil my bad. MMOs are a niche genre that peaked almost a decade ago. Zoomers don’t play them en masse and those that did most won’t have the time or want to get back into a time sink like classic
---
Nah. My guess is they won’t be out till name reservation
---
Interesting. Thanks!
---
People bought gold in vanilla. Bad players will always cheat. Doesn't mean they have to put in a token. 
---
But Blizz is also clearly not trying to maximize profits from classic either as there has been no advertising so far. I think they hope it dies so they can just point to the sub influx and give credit to retail.
---
This is why I roll PVE. Naxx will nuke the PVP servers hard. Also no reason to rank anymore as the gear is better than epic pvp set which is tuned for AQ40. The endgame is all PVE.
---
Are you mentally challenged?
---
One month in, there WILL be a mass of Classic players looking to use gold for their sub.  This is going to happen.  Why not just cut out the middleman?
---
Every warrior is going to tank 5 mans to get their prebis. It's much easier getting it if you never allow rogues or other warriors in your group or put hoj on reserve lol.
---
I don’t play retail, no.
---
Regular texes, no.
---
Collections for expenses, sure.
---
As long as the guildies who provide services on raid day get comped idgf.
---
Hoping it dies would be extremely short sighted.  I think that Blizzard thinks it will fail, but I don't think they want it to fail.
---
I'm a simple man. I see Thex, I upvote.

I'm rolling an orc rogue on a PVP server.  I know that engineering is great, but i feel like i really want to do herbalism/alchemy.  Is that nuts to play a herb/alc rogue?
---
&gt;the biggest challenge is in fact having 40 people show up **now**
---
In your first post you implied that this was a constant and not a new thing, and there is the miss understanding. But yes NOW this is the case.
---
This is the point i originally replied to:
---
&gt;The "difficult" things in WoW **were** getting enough players and having them geared
---
Then your buddies should be ready to protect your ass and do some pvp
---
Rogue gets a strong rep for pvp because of how strong a ganker it is, but in level cap organized pvp (namely BGs) it is one of the weaker choices. It's toolkit is built around 1v1, not 10v10. You mostly guard the flag or the point in stealth.
---
Very good Young Padawan
---
I think it's more along the lines of which can generate more revenue for them. 
---
Theres classic, where you'll have monthly subs.
---
Then theres retail, where you have monthly subs, mount shop, gold shop, and whatever else it is they're selling these days. 
---
Why spend resources on a game that will maybe make half as much money as the other? Why do you think theres been a complete lack of advertising, or news in general?
---
Even Danes talk english to each other. I guess they find it easier too!
---
To be fair, I vividly remember how many players were posting daily about wanting those extra services they'll gladly pay for. 
---
And while the #NOCHANGES crowd surely will flail me alive, I really couldn't care less if that would come to Classic as well.
---
I remember reading about a Brazilian exchange student who met unbreakable (he was living at his house as a homestay) but never heard of the accident, you sure about this?

Productive discussion.
---
im not saying they wont, Im saying that at the start of phase six you can expect it to die right about however many months there was between 5 and 6.
---
Altho die isnt the proper word, you are gonna have a lot of people playing still who dont need constant fresh content, as well as speed runners, and certain pvpers. I dont think it would every truely die if blizz let it run
---
It's important, but not as important as your motivation.
---
If you'd still be happy as a human, be a human.
---
I wouldn’t mind if it was used to help healers and tanks pay for consumables / repairs. Something like a 2 - 5g per raid charge for a month or two then let the money float and build off of BoE sales.
---
Iirc it wasn't that huge a difference. I think it calculates into attack power but I might be wrong

Yog, a very skilled undead rogue on, I think, Executus PVP server.
---
I wish trolls would look as coll in game as they do on artworks.
---
Just because engineering is BiS for PvP doesn't mean that you are completely screwed if you don't have it. Herb is really good for Rogue, so you might as well get the fitting Profession for it.
---
its the priority stat, its stronger than crit and hit
---
Yeah, literally everyone here.
---
It's still an in game transaction. If you're guild can't facilitate it another could. There are ways to prevent scamming. Also if blizzard doesn't ban it, or make any statement about it being unacceptable it could be treated as a normal transaction. Like trading a bunch of enchanting materials, or crafting materials. 
---
Actually some crafting materials are way above whatever the cost will be for a month of sub. 
---
&gt;Your guild will only has a limited amount of gold at some point you are going to have to trade with people you don't know
---
How much gold are you buying...
---
Mom said it was my turn to post this today
---
It will 100% be based on the Retail token price.  I’d expect a token to be 150-200g in Classic based on gold farming per hour being stable (once we hit 60).  That means right now you’d get around 800:1 ratio.
---
you are way wrong so why even reply?
---
This was not intended as "they were here first, they get gear first" more along the lines of the 12 will be commited to the guild early and roles such as MT and roles are filled within that. Obv if a rogue comes in and dps's much better than a rogue of the 12 core they will be geared.
---
Chonar was the most memorable person there tbh. Warrior tank in CoI
---
Swifty. the Nelf Warrior... Or he is from TBC?
---
Paladin God Jamaz. Had a bunch of pally videos back in vanilla that inspired many.
---
Yeah, those Layer numbers on the beta were ~10 or even 1. So 100 at launch and then gradually increase it to 1k is right.
---
Getting through nax instead of burning out at aq like I did 15 years ago
---

---
Maybe a dumb question to ask in this subreddit
---
Im excited for the Thex
---
Never even heard of it.
---
i bought an AW3418DW just for classic wow, i have been testing on some wotlk servers and retail and it looks fucking great so far, the loading screens i hearth they got unpdated but i dont know havent play retail since the open beta was announced
---
I know it's a dumb question to ask in this subreddit but idk, maybe people don't miss the time they gotta spend on leveling and farming for shit
---
Yea, why in the hell would anyone speed through the 1-60 grind you love but they hate? I can’t fathom why they’d do that!
---
I literally just made a post about what I'll miss most and then I saw this :)
---
[Heroic Leap!](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ckbl0o/an_ode_to_heroic_leap/)
---
maybe the true reason for the shared sub. Backdoor in app purchases.
---
One word. Delusional.
---
Will the real Thex please stand up.
---
A better alternative, to name and practice, is to take a pension of all the gold that drops in raid. When the bosses are looted the gold is distributed and each player can make an easy 10g from this. 
---
After raids that go well, no wipe-fests, you can ask for 5g per raider. This way it’s more of a sense that you are collecting all the gold that the raid bosses dropped, which was a team effort. 
---
Another gold “tax” for your guild can be the Onyxia Hide Bag. For our guild we had a 5g fee to roll on the bag. Winner could take the bag or sell it. The 5g per raider was put towards tank repairs and flasks.
---
Im just sad that vanilla doesnt have troll druids as it fits lore imho
---
&gt;I assume you also have backup team formulations and substitutes in mind if certain groups fail to come together with all their members?
---
Yeah, it's unrealistic that every single 5-man grind group will keep together until level 50-60.
---
We also have plenty of solo players that would fill in the gaps, and we're looking to keep growing to remain flexible. Groups can advertise on the spreadsheet to search for the kind of people they need to minimize flaking.
---
The goal is to have enough players to fill the gaps.
---
Why does everything have to become Thexual lately?
---
It all makes sense now.
---
He was a tbc celebrity though, after s2 as well.
---
Your mom is a grain of sand!
---
charge is pretty awesome tho too.
---
I will probably miss just anything about a paladin that makes it actually do proper damage.
---
And many more!
---
we are in a hyper thexualized community
---
I can't tell if I'm dealing with a troll or you're dense. 
---
Classic is released on August 26/27. How much time from that date do you anticipate it will take you to reach 60. This question has been answered by over 30,000 people and you're the only one who seems to have trouble with it.
---
Thex?
---
Can people stop saying shit like this?
---
If you don't want to be a human, that's fine, play something else, but stop lying to people to make it seem like weapon skill isn't the absolutely most bonkers stat in the entire game.
---
It's still the same dungeon. Dodging volcanoes or hitting explosive orbs depending on the week doesn't change the fact that this is your 100th shrine run for a trinket. A trinket which you farmed 3 times over now as item level restrictions get raised every patch, and will continue to farm because it's not a Max ilvl w/ socket.
---
Not to mention some affixes in some dungeons are a fucking shitshow because of strange interactions w/ mechanics, like boss adds influencing spawn rates of said volcanoes or orbs, or trash mobs having an enrage on top of enrage on top of fortified.
---
I look forward to just being done with an item slot once I get what I need, and only having to farm for it once. I also look forward to dungeons being meaningful without insane scaling, and without random weekly mechanics making them arbitrarily harder.
---
I'm OK with doing new content for new gear when a patch/phase drops. Repeating the same motions, in the same dungeons, patch after patch is infuriating and boring.
---

This. I know people are going to be hardcore and try for work first rag and basically have complete phase one in a couple of weeks, but I’m hoping to play casual and still be able to experience the role out of new content.
---
For retail? absolutely.
---
True, but I can only name one 'Thex'  though... :-/
---
Dives
---
Exactly, if you can prove yourself to be useful in raid (ie master how to totem twist, do not take aoe damage and do your best to be support) then you could find yourself in raids especially if you are friendly and reliable. Is Enhancement even decent pve dps? No, you will likely be competing with the tanks for dps. Unfortunately not being able to use flameshock and stormstrike due to debuff limits are some of the biggest issues for enhancement. 
---
I would say if you are going to even think about raiding as a meme spec in Vanilla, please be prepared to be a try hard, min max everything you can including world buffs, flasks, talents, rotations etc otherwise you will not be happy with your performance and others likely won't as well.

Hi. No.
---
Which is why many of us hate retail...it has become a shit game and gold is worthless there.
---
Another big aspect of addiction is when continued use of the substance/activity damages other aspects of your life. (Relationships, jobs, etc)
---
Most people that talk the engineering min/maxing are coming at basically from an entirely one dimensional performance stand point.
---
People talk much less about how eng is a gold sink while other professions are going to make you money. This is entirely normal to do, and the only people who want eng maxed on every char also probably have multiple alts with other professions and a stock pile of money.
---
Especially the first time around on a character you have to decide where you want that gold invested. it's gonna be gear, enchants, repairs, epic mount, all farm time. Maybe you won't have grenades but as alch especially you will be making gold ontop of easy access to pvp potions like FAP that you wont have to burn a hole in your pocket for.
---
The min max rhetoric on this sub really has very little to do with the average players experience.
---
Agreed on the private servers.
---
And it depends on how you look at it. For me, classic WoW is $15 a month because retail, since I'll never play, isn't even part of the equation. Let's just agree WoW is going to be $15 a month regardless of how you play. 
---
And like I said, I get why it's that expensive and I think it is a good thing for overall game play. But look at anything that's been successful recently. Free base game. $$ for in game purchases. Awful for classic Wow. But overall successful.
---
Mats for potions/enchants/food/gear for the guild and repairs for tanks.
---
wow u sucked at leveling lmao
---
Jump with noggenfogger and 100% from LB in AB and charge a mage.. ez
---
Most top guilds do this only at the start and its usually to buy stockade pauldrens, edgemasters and pallies + locks have to help pay for hunters mounts.
---
But anything out of the top like 5 guilds in the game no. Also dont get pissy when your gleader sells shitty mc boes before you have them. The items suck and the guild needs cash
---
I'm an American civil servant and banked up holidays cost A LOT of money here. Our workforce does not take its holidays partially because we equate them to money. You'll see some organizations where sick leave is not cashable, so many employees will hold 0 sick days but be hoarding every single vacation day since their orientation. Some people also consider cashable leave an investment because they become worth more as your earnings go up.
---
For example, say we have a rookie cop, Doug. Doug makes $20/hr and shows up for work every day for 5 years. Doug is now an experienced cop making $40/hr. He also accrued 24 days of leave each year for 5 years. If Doug were to quit or have to disability retire now, you'd have to pay out 120 days at $320 a piece. That's $38,400. 
---
Now say Doug makes Police Lieutenant after 25 years on the force and is now getting paid $60/hr. If he still held on to all his vacation days, they'd be worth $288,000. That's a less likely scenario, but like anywhere else, people tend to keep and promote extreme workaholics that produce reliable results. 
---
Companies and governments do not want to pay out 6 figure sums for PTO whenever someone leaves. They'd rather you just take the days off because it also prevents burnout and keeps your productivity high.
---
That’s a real head scratcher, seeing as at this point they probably already have an official list.
---
Gosh, Eternal Legend. I watched that one a lot and loved it. The Nostalgia is real with that one, far stronger than with Blind for me.
---
LMFAO
---
Daily play time more than 50% between 1-4 hours. Time to max level estimate mostly 1-2 month. Some are in for a surprise here.
---
Ya people don't like good games.
---
For horde its better than dw
---
I got 12 weeks of time off i can't take...
---
I can't tell if this is copy pasta or serious. Please tell me it's the former.
---
So it looks like I'll be leveling on my own, since only one of my friends might play. Regardless, can't seem to choose a class no matter how much I think about it. I'm about to be starting college, so I'll probably play really casually at least until I have a solid standing with schoolwork and stuff (and even then I'm not gonna rush to 60 or anything like that). For my classes, I'm deciding between paladin, warlock, and rogue. I really like the themes between all three, class design, and general gameplay. 
---
I'll probably just casually play PvE *and* PvP whenever I feel like one or the other. Respeccing probably won't be a big deal, but I can't see myself doing it  too often. 
---
As **Paladin**, I've played probably the most under this class. After playing the latest stress test (last month) I found it not too bad to level as holy, despite most of the community saying it's boring with just autoattack and Judgment for rotation, and plus having heals is nice. I just wish I could wear plate armor :/
---
As **Warlock**, I haven't really played too much of it. I like the concept of summoning demons, and don't really mind having a soul shard bag *yet*. Destruction tree for talents looks badass though, and might have to go down that route and just burn everything I see. 
---
As **Rogue**, using stealth is such a game changer. It seems like a really methodical and tactical playstyle in Classic, especially in PvP and managing energy/combo points. 
---
I'm pretty much equally split between all three of these for different reasons. I'll probably make all three, but I'm not sure which to start as.
---
Leveling is part of the process to be raid ready on a fresh server. The fact you choose to ignore that aspect is pretty telling that you’re not too bright of a dude
---
Either you compare a fresh 60 to a fresh 120 in which case the 120 with undoubtedly faster
---
Or you compare expansion start vs fresh vanilla server. 
---
Any other comparisons in time spent getting ready for raid doesn’t make sense.
---
Launched team viewer and actually made a character on retail. Via phone. This works well haha
---
Enhancement shamans are bad at Nightfall wielding, Hunters and Warriors are far better for optimal uptime on the debuff as they have actual melle abilities they can use and spam unlike Shamans who auto attack...same goes for Ret's.
---
Yeah you for sure won't need higher than 60, let alone 75. 144 is pointless for WoW
---
Skinning &amp; Herbalism/Mining. Unlimited gold
---
Let us gingerly touch our tips
---
We're all Thex now
---
r/woosh
---
Planning on rolling a Troll Shaman named Thex.
---
Thanks for the advice!! So I won’t be able to tank early dungeons? Probably have to wait til early 20s?
---
Yeah, I'll farm 1000 gold in BfA and trade it for 1000 gold in classic with my good friend mister gold seller nothing wrong with that, and no one knows about the credit card transaction except him and me.
---
I have friends that are going to pay a leveling service and buy a shitload of classic gold from illegal sources.  That is "blizzlike" vanilla WOW.  It's just the way it is and the way we want it to be.  The moment Blizz puts in a token or level boosts to try to cut those people out, they just made classic not vanilla like.  Leave it like it was.
---
LFG ruined the game.
---
Case closed right here
---
In phase 1 it's near top DPS warrior with OEB + edgemasters on horde, the real issue is threat though, no way in hell you'll be able to go all out which really takes the fun out of it. I would say it's more viable to play 2h Fury as human with OEB and salv.
---
Mute/Kishkumen (?spelling?).. From World of Roguecraft, anyone?
---
Also Karabasan from Shattered Hand EU who posted the thread "Bogget is noob like most alliances" that literally blew up.
---
I've been reminded quite a bit that Eye of kilrog being able to pull large numbers of dungeon mobs was a bug and has been fixed so it doesn't work anymore.
---
Get to 60. It took me about 3 months IRL time back in the day, and im expecting about the same this time around. Less time to play, but more efficient play so it'll even out.
---
Second, get in a guild and prepare for raids (attunements, gear, professions etc)
---
Third, start raiding :D
---
Human Warlock or Gnome Warlock?
---
I still have Vurtne’s vids.  And Pat
---
Funny! I was Warrior named Phatmini, primarily with Aesir Descendants, later The Ancient Ones, and in Original as a social. Aesir was Danish along with Danes of Honor, and they raided together in Vanilla!
---
"Most guilds" that's a bold statement.
---
I think what he is saying is more that it should have a weighting closer to the performance gained from it. There is no way that you need 3% crit to equal 1 spell power. Looking at your rogue weighting, crit would have points 10x that of agility or stamina. Warlock probably wouldn't be that high but it definitely would be a higher weighting than any of the other stats on a per point basis due to the performance gain from it and how little is actually on gear.
---
Troll Shaman named Thex.  Going to RP that he is the father of Zappy Boi.
---
In all seriousness, probably an Orc Lock.  Small chance I change to Hunter but doubt it.  I like warlocks and summoning/curses are cool.
---
What spec?
---
Playing rogue on horde side PvP server. I like world PvP, BGs, and casual raiding. I was wondering if WoTF is important if I plan on mostly doing PvP or if the Orc racials are better for a hybrid experience at 60.
---
Probably a dwarf priest, gnome warlock is a close second.
---
I really like dwarf animations and stone form is such a boon. It works in ZG too which a lot of people forget. Plus, it doesn't just remove the poison, you can't be poisoned while up.
---
Gnome for escape artist. The + Intel is nice but even with 400+ Intel (AQ40ish) you are only getting +20 intel. Its not as good as people say it is.
---
As to your troll spriest - use it on Drek Thar to wipe ally zergs lol.
---
Is it at exactly 6pm on aug 12th?!?!
---
LOL, true
---
The only joke is the void microchasm that is the skull of the turds claiming this is sexist
---
Ok thanks I figured I’d have to heal the first few dungeons til I got some decent gear, appreciate the help!
---
&gt; Below you can see the local time the character creation window will start depending on your location, but August 12th or August 13th instead of August 26th/27th respectively.
---
So August 12th 5PM CDT, adjust to your timezone accordingly.
---
They're needed for Curses and also have good DPS, plus Soulstone and Heslthstones.
---
Quite good, I'd say, unless you just want to be at the top of some addon.
---
MY WIFES BOYFRIEND LOVED THIS POST!!!
---
lol why the fuck are you deciding how other people should play
---
Fangorn the Hunter.
---
Or maybe I have enough common sense to know it’s pointless to compare the leveling experience of classic and retail?
---
Which is why I’ve been discussing the gearing and raiding, which happen at max level.
---
Nice effort! My character took 21 days. It was pretty close to the same time played to 60 as my friends! 25 days doesn't sound crazy to me!
---
I think most of the recipes are indeed tradeable but im not 100% on that
---
I don't think it's comparable. I think you did a poor job stating what your actual problem with it is because punishing people for playing the way they want isn't what that is doing and you don't have a problem with punishing people for playing the way they want if the way they want is doing something messed up like ninja looting.
---
I know.
---
I chose TheSauce and never looked back.
---
Ok the exchange rate won't be 1 to 1. Also, you could trade gold for gold and NEITHER of you could use a credit card. You could have gold on BFA and just trade it for vanilla gold. Then the guy who now has the BFA gold can buy a token from somebody completely random off the AH. It could be the same guys token, but it definitely doesn't have to be.
---
At my company I'm allowed to deny your vacation based on operational needs.  If 2 other people are scheduled off and it's going to affect the operation, your vacation will be denied.
---
It could have been "Snu Snu"!
---
Yeah I’m checking out classic wowhead. Thanks. Priests don’t have binding heal or PoM? That’s a yikes.
---
I was not completely serious.  But do you mean there are too few options for it to be difficult to remember or too few to train a GAN?
---
4K classic wow is a MAJOR upgrade in my opinion. 
---
I dont even have a 4K monitor, but running the game at a dynamic resolution is so much better looking than 1080P.
---
Still stuck on leveling and you can’t realize people are talking about gearing up and raiding. 
---
Good try, thanks for playing.
---
They arguably are the best leveler because shadow meld is a great tool in the open world. The grace is also good because it helps manage 2+ mobs, which if you are hardcore leveling is a must.
---
At which point it would be better to just introduce the token to classic. I don't think the token would be good for the game, but it would be better than just allowing uncontrolled trading of gold between the two games.
---
Does anybody else instantly downvote anything with an ‘Unpopular Opinion’ label?  Makes my damn skin crawl for some reason.
---
Never go out of your way to play with friends. I've learned this the hard way. When your friends all quit for one reason or another you'll still be stuck on a PvP server.
---
It entirely depends on the organizations policies and how they handle/account for leave. I am not an accountant, and I work in the public sector where there is no annual leave payout, but it becomes complicated within private companies where leave handling is tricky. For example, some organizations allow employees to cash out portions/all of their leave each year for a cash check (some employees don't like to do this because it's taxed at a higher rate I believe). The more annual leave employees have, the greater the chance for a higher payout needed, and this must be accounted for. It's essentially a liability on the books. Even if there isn't a payout yearly, you have to account for it if staff are paid out upon separation, because you never know when some one may leave.   
---
PTO is a tricky encumbrance and companies will sometimes have a position dedicated to monitoring staff leave balances and planning for it. That said, I'm surprised OP had it denied - my suspicion is that the manager had multiple requests for the same reason and doesn't want to let some off and have others upset that they were denied, creating resentment between employees. However, this would be better handled by just discussing with employees and forming some sort of rotation if they want to spend their leave that way. Ultimately, HR would likely be interested in this because depending how leave is handled within the org, the manager is making things harder on the company books. Also, depending on HR policies and laws, and unjust reason for denial, while allowing leave during a period that makes less sense, may expose the org to discrimination/bias claims.
---
Isn't Hunter quite difficult to master, especially if you don't use macros (which will most likely be not working in Classic I heard)?
---
Is there a /s missing?
---
This is not true at all.
---
The game looks identical at 75hz, 120hz, and 144hz.
---
The difference in texture quality when using 4K is massive. All jaggies are removed.
---
Because that guy doesn't like male night elves? For me, it's paladins that are kos. Sometimes also gnomes depending on my mood.
---
This is me too man, where are ya? I'm near Sacramento, CA
---
Legomyegolas
---
No. I really hope the OG Thex gets his character created before he doesn't get a chance due to people stealing it for the meme.
---
&gt;4k offers no advantage that is actually discernible to human eyes.
---
I can't even imagine being this wrong about something with such confidence.
---
I try to make my sarcasm so blatant it doesn’t need it
---
Or maybe women, on average, simply aren't as interested in video games to the same extent that men are, on average. Believe it or not but men and women are different and display different population level interests. Not everything is about oppression and systematic inequality.
---
I don't feel oppressed because I don't enjoy shopping in the same way my girl friends do, nor would I feel oppressed if I decided to tag along one day and I'm the only guy going. 
---
As to your point about men possibly ignoring their responsibilities to play WoW, that's obviously a problem, it's also a completely separate problem from why women don't play video games in the same numbers men do.
---
Train from SW to IF and pick fly point in IF. Afterwards climbing dun morgoh and drop down to westlands
---
The reason I multiply by the armor passthrough after sunder armor is applied is because the primary point of relevance is "when does sunder get better than rend". 
---
Because rend ignores armor, I wanted to modify sunder's change in physical EHP into just what that would mean in terms of change in "pure HP" so that I can compare more easily to rend.
---
Another way to think of it is that "rend's damage contribution is just the amount of EHP you removed from the mob too". But rend doesn't remove EHP, it removes HP, and you need to divide that number by the passthrough value of the mob to find out how much EHP the mob actually takes (as EHP damage*armor passthrough=HP damage). 
---
So to make the two directly comparable, I need to modify EITHER the sunder column or the rend column. 
---
But the amount of change in EHP rend provides is dependent on armor level, and I don't have space or desire to clutter up the presentation with 6 separate columns for rend depending on the 6 different numbers of sunder armor. 
---
So instead of dividing rend by the armor passthroughs for a corresponding number of sunders, I instead MULTIPLY sunder by the armor passthroughs that exist after you apply each rend. And thus, hopefully (If I am not making a mistake), get the sunder numbers in an equivalent
---
Cleave gets left behind here, but if you read the cleave slide of the presentation, you can see why: because It's already a super rough approximation AND it's going to interact with sunder in a complex manner. 
---
And thunderclap.... frankly, I do feel there is more complexity to investigate there.... there just isn't space, and I feel that number of targets is going to have a larger impact on if you can tclap than number of sunders.
---
I play with at least one a day on Overwatch. It could be the games we play that affect that - never had a girl on my Apex team except for one who was in the OW group..
---
They will probably have more on launch. I believe several very large streamers plan to stream it which should balloon popularity. 250k signatures were on the petition for classic. I saw a 30 minute class picking guide with 500k views on YouTube. I believe that something like 100 million total accounts have been created for WoW. Those are all part of the potential market for Classic. Additionally, younger folks who have heard about it will come to check it out. The launch could be huge. It’s hard to say.
---
play from work, duh
---
People are going to swipe credit cards for gold regardless.   The only question is do they pay blizzard or gold farmers?
---
Ya at this point they pretty much have to. I don't see what the point is of trying to ban it. I can walk up to somebody and give them some crusader orbs, and later on somebody gives me gold on BFA. Nobody is going to bother looking into that trade. 
---
So the tokens exist, the game time is shared, and its going to be difficult to stop. 
---
Also blizzard would have to pay staff to stop people from buying tokens from THEM. They actually have to go out of their way to stop people from giving them money? Are they seriously going to do that?
---
I agree with you there. Overall I think classic has a good chance of passing retail on sub counts. Definitely not going to pass the peak in WotLK though. 
---
But with that said, there are other ways for actiblizz to make money off retail that are absent in classic. There is e-sports for arena which is still pretty big. There the world first races which are getting bigger.
---
On top of that, it's not that every sub on retail is buying extra stuff, it's just like "F2P/P2W" games. They dont need everyone buying, only the whales.
---
Yeah neither of those, but they are still probably the most versatile healers in classic.  Lots of other healers spam just one spell.
---
I'd recommend reading war of the ancients. Maybe it's not directly connected to the classic lore because it's set 10000 years before the events of wc, but you would learn general lore of the universe and particularly the stories of malfurion stormrage, tyrande whisperwind, krasus, rhonin, Illidan stormrage, nozdormu, queen azshara, broxigar saurfang for example and of course the Legion.
---
That’s not exactly proof, though I would call it evidence. There are a million explanations as to why they may be underestimating the potential revenue from Classic.
---
Gnome
---
One thing I can say about rogue is that while leveling stealth is pretty useless. Most mobs are grouped too close for you to get close and ambush. Sap also removes you from stealth unless talented. Most of the time you'll open by throwing a knife and letting your target run to you.
---
I've been pronouncing it Tex, but maybe it's supposed to be T-hex as in T-rex?
---
Good one WeirdChamp
---
Shadowmeld is only out of combat in classic, so it isn't as useful for disengaging
---
You just reminded me that after my grandfather died I flashed to a bunch of memories were I was sitting on the PC playing WoW whenever they were over.
---
I was no older then 13-14 - but I never want to have that experience again. That’s when you realize the meaning of wasted chances..
---
And so it begins
---
No pets
---
No power from darkness
---
No "free" mount
---
No DoTs
---
No over-populated player base
---
Whichever you like the look of better
---
Do i understand correctly here that you’re saying you dont get rep for quests after they turn grey? Owch...
---
From everyone I’ve spoken with, guides I’ve read/watched, leveling as a priest /shadow priest is not slow. It’s on par, if not faster than the average.
---
Epics? fuck that i’m going for Thunderfury.. I play MT in literally every other game I play, can’t see it going any other way.
---
Me and at least 4 other friends will be rolling Horde and we plan on making a Guild just for us, perhaps more later. Does this count as a guild? I’m a newbie, btw.
---
Some guild fund buying, crafting and stocking the basic consumables and mailing them to raid members would save time and gold overall I'm sure. It would also distribute raiding costs more equally.
---
I don't think I've ever seen that done though. Might be a good way for casual/semi-hardcore guilds to increase consumable usage.
---
Hunter is a better choice for first character, levelling a warrior will probably put you off the game
---

Thexen would be the proper plural I believe.

Hi Harowyn,  
---
On private servers skinning was mandatory to afford skills + mount at 40. From the recent beta we learned that so isnt the case on classic. You get enough grey &amp; greens from mob drops. If you want to rush to 60 it's adviced to skip professions but if you want to enjoy the marathon just go with mining and engineering from the start.
---
Love your content man. Keep up the good druid fight :)
---
Your comment reminded me of GDKP runs back in ICC and that was certainly interesting.
---
Those are some serious money making professions too.
---
Because you wouldn't be able to get to that chest without your group?
---
I'd be honored. Yeah, take anything from either of my guides or my comments and credit me somewhere. I think the area that would improve your macro section the most is the description. Use it to explain the goal of the macro, then how it functions. A commentary is the most useful thing for beginners.

I do not remember any guild tax in Vanilla. There are many more ways to ensure a gold flow for a guild, and none of them is perceived as something everyone hates : taxes.
---
First one is donations to guild bank, be it gold, mats, consumables. Many players will accept to donate to the guild. Second one is selling BoE drops from raids. Third one is guild farming runs. Have 3-4 groups run Strat live, sell the Orbs and split the gold, half goes to GB, half is split between the runners.
---
Another way, which is used on pservers, when a raid is on farm, and raiders don't have gold issues, is to collect all the gold from raid bosses for GB.
---
PuG selling runs by alts of top guilds are probably the best way to have heaps of gold in GB, but again, it comes later down the road.
---
Personally, I don't see any guild that will ever tax their members, unless they RP and the tax is symbolic. But that would be the exception, not the rule.
---
Indeed, before those changes Enhancement Shamans were nightmares to deal with as you couldn't kite them like you can now. 
---
On 1.12 I lmao being a Hunter and seeing an enhancement shaman there is literally nothing they can do to get into melle range and they are always an easy kill. 
---
Shamans got the worst end of the stick in Vanilla, along with Paladins I still can't believe all those changes that Blizzard had ready didn't go out until TBC pre patches...complete disservice to hybrid players.
---
Mute/roguezeroskill was the first and was in my guild for a bit.
---
At least it does change. In classic you’ll run the exact same raids hundreds of times, odds are you’ll see MC every single week, unchanged for the foreseeable future.
---
Agreed all around. It's just spreading misinformation, even if unintentional. This post needs to be removed since OP didn't delete or even edit.
---
They paid you by clearing the mobs in the dungeon so you could safely open that chest
---
I "stole" (I didn't let shitters roll) the mammoth mount from vault in wotlk and one of the shitters followed me around on the forums calling me a ninja and generally losing his mind.  Unrelated to my "ninja"ing I was transferring my char back to the glorious arthas server and because I already had a char of the same name on arthas I had to rename my char.  So this dude finds me on the arthas realm forums and makes daily threads about how I'm a ninja and how I stole the mammoth and how I'm trying to change my name and literally replies to every post I make with a copy/paste about it for months.
---
That's my ninja story, that dude was PISSED.  Nobody cared.
---
You are correct ( however I don’t know if it will keep a record of your kills and retroactively apply once honor is a thing )
---
are you always wrong when you decide to write something?
---
I feel you on this very much, I'm rolling alliance to join my best friend. At least we can revel in the nice layout and organization of IF and SW. zug zug :/
---
I’m going Tauren Hunter. Nostalgia purposes. Might switch to Orc because I’ll be focusing on PvP. I’m gonna level mostly BM, but will switch to MM around 40.
---
But if both of you play Classic, who is doing Laundry?
---
I actually lol'd; but the fact of the matter is not all business courses are created equal. And running a hoagie shop and a multi-billion gaming company are not the same thing.
---
Have you ever healed PvP before? I was a holy paladin back in the day and absolutely loved healer in PvP. I only ended up respeccing to Ret because I was sick of players on my team not killing enemy healers. Healers are a crazy important part of winning PvP fights.
---
It's worth having rank 1 of shadowguard on bars right? Spam it for blackout stun proc when getting nuked and don't waste mana on highest rank?
---
We Call Him Thex Paulson
---
You know, not everyone who discusses your points is trying to attack you.
---
And it's "too dumb"
---
No where did I say they were unaware; I’m sure they have thought about it, but maybe decided it wasn’t a priority, and I want them to know it is for some.
---
People will definitely  be taking advantage of WPVP phase, it is a very easy thing to farm. On a private server I played on I was able to get to rank 8 while seriously farming alliance. This was usually done by hiding in IronForge with 4-5 other people and owning a small building, guarding entrance to DM ( Blackrock is not as good because so many ways to escape) and camping Menethil Harbor. It is incredibly boring if you want to compete, as you'll basically just kill unsuspecting people running by who just want to get away, probably 80% don't even engage.  I am not sure it will be easier than phase 3 though, infact it may be harder due to less players ranking. The smaller the total honor pool is, the lower you will be in overall ranking.
---
The other big downside to doing this is you aren't queuing so you have very little time to farm gold between farming HKs. I personally will be doing some PVP but not expecting to get more than rank 5/6 during this phase and would rather productively accumulate gold or consumables for battleground oriented PVP and get ahead of the Phase 2 honor farmers who won't be winning games as fast as my premade due to lack of consumes.
---
Yes, P1 pvp will be pvp in it's purest form.
---
If someone kills you, it's because they actually wanted to do so, not for some reward or title.
---
have 4 other friends that live near me and planning on doing regular lans with. 26 days....
---
Awesome, thanks. Will probably have that done over the weekend (unless blizz decides to give us the stress test finally. come on blizz!)
---
Ive done darn rep as human mage on pservers. Youre exalted by level 42.
---
Remember client will be 1.12 and there will be full quests
---
The whole idea of applying a GAN makes no sense. A GAN would produce new faces that look like faces a WoW developer would make, when what you are trying to do is match similarities between faces.
---
When i say too few options I mean that the best thing to do would be to just make a matching table.
---
They're rolling content out in phases based on which patch they were released in.
---
*My, you're a tall one!*
---
I've heard some contention between two old formulas and I have not got onto the classic beta or stress test to confirm.  I think that the current formula is 20% less rep and exp for each level of grey you out level the quest level.  Example, completing the level 1 quests in mulgore at level 7 will give you 80% rep and xp.  This goes down to a floor of 20% rep and xp, which is honestly not worth the time to work through completing quests that are 9 levels below you for 30 rep instead of 150 and 20% xp.
---
To reiterate you should receive 100% as long as the quest level is at the worst 5 levels below you.  Once you ding and the quest level is 6 levels difference the reward is reduced 20% per level, down to 20% as the lowest reward.  You do not get any bonuses for completing an orange, red, green, or yellow quest.  The rewards are identical.  I do know speed levelers use a similar tactic by not turning in yellow quests until they are completely done with the area.  So they get the most exp from killing level appropriate mobs and the same xp rewarded from green quests as they would from turning in the quest when it was yellow.
---
I understand the math but look at from the late persons perspective. There are so many things that can cause you to be 5-10mins late without a notice, that doesn't make you a bad raider and it certainly isn't justifying a 250-500gold fee which is 5-10 hours of labour as you mentioned, meanwhile wiping a guild due to some stupid mistake like blowing up the raid on baron that's your fault 100% and it costs the guild way more than someone being 10 mins late, yet the fine is 10 times lower.
---
Account 3: damn that's real desperate....just play the game the way it's meant to be played...
---
Maybe it was the pandas.
---
You know there's a census survey answering all these questions with thousands of results right?
---
the "Tax" of a guild is the guild keeping the boes that drop basically. Core Hound Leather, putting rare recipe drops on the officers/gm. Ive NEVER heard of a gold tax implimented by any guild I played with or of one that was on a server I played on for Vanilla WoW or Private Servers I have played on.
---
The closest thing I heard of was a guild asking members to give 100g but that would go towards potions/flasks for members who gave it and I think the members also got DKP for it? But it wasnt a required tax. 
---
I dont think any guild needs to tax its members or should. Just as an antidote, I was in a pserver guild who absorbed a GM from another mc/bwl when the gms guild died at the start of AQ40 and I remember hearing the GM of the dead guild had enough gold/items to sell from his dead guilds bank that he didnt have to farm for the rest of the servers life (which he never did. he raid logged on and off and thats the only times I ever saw the guy on, and I was on a LOT).
---
So yea. Taxes? Sounds like a bad idea for anyone paying them. And anyone thats able to get people to pay a guild tax... Im kind of impressed.
---
Taking LSD is the answer.
---
Get a life
---
No one mention Laintime? That Korean had some awesome undead warrior balls.
---
Did this a few years ago. Only recommend for easy stuff like grinding, fishing. Not so good in groups
---
Make some good guild friends! Because all your real life friends are going to hate you!
---
Either Orc or Gnome Warlock. With either echant/tailor or gather/tailor I'll start my spec with whatever is best leveling till 40ish and respec to a more pvp based build to 60. I'll be sure to enjoy some WpVp on the way. Then once I got enough gear to get a spot in MC I'll switch to a raid spec.
---
I'll spend one week a month switching spec to pvp in between raids. Not sure I can afford more than that.
---
just save the website I linked, check around 10th to 15th august
---
I'm skipping professions on my Hunter and going with Engineering/Enchanting once I hit 60. Farming gold is more fun than farming mats for me. If I want trying to hit 60 relatively quickly, I would probably level mining and engineering as I went.
---
I wouldn't call it optimal but min-maxed to the nth degree.
---
I have a friend who is likely to be playing warrior. I want a healer that can function best with his class choice in BGs but still be able to raid effectively. Are paladins my only choice?  Is being a paladin at level 60 as monotonous as everyone claims? I never see many people in this thread considering paladin so I wasn’t sure if people were put off by them. 
---
This is the dumbest argument. It's a group effort to get to the chest, so it should be shared with the group. Rogues get paid for lock picking services if someone brings them lockboxes to open, not when a chest is found in a dungeon. With that being said, I still found this story humorous.
---
Years ago I was in a guild that had a weekly upkeep fee for free consumables. Saw it as perfectly acceptable.
---
IMO hunter is very easy to play but difficult to master
---
And if they grow further, they want to watch you play. No killing allowed, just fishing, doing AH stuff, traveling..
---
Did you opt into beta? Even if you didn’t get beta?
---
Naxx is and will be a guild killer. That place is tuned for level 70s and 80s. One night of progression could easily take 300-500 gold of potions and buffs. I was there at the time. Mechanics are not hard, it's just brutally tuned. I don't see a guild kill it in the first week
---
Pally wont be able to tank deadmines until consecrate imo because theres lots of mobs.  SFK and beyond is all doable.  Zulfarrak is when things start getting tough, and i honestly have never seen a pally tank zf, mara, sunken temple.  BRD, initially, will be difficult to tank because of gear, so often times pallies will heal earlyon to pickup tank scraps, and start tanking once you have 4 or 5 pieces.  
---
True hallmark of a good pally tank is managing your mana.  Knowing when to save consecrate, when to use lower ranks, how to keep a good pace, being fair with loot.  And to be selfdeprecating, accept that pally tanks are not the best and make fun of yourself with the group.  When you start getting defensive with other players (who is prolly deadset in their opinions), everyone loses.
---
Omg, i cant manage 1 hero. What you do for life?
---
Im actually in two of Vurtne's movies, i feel honored to be killed by him :D
---
Yeah. It's too bad the game's never gonna get another content update again.
---
No this was the most helpful comment! Thank you!

No it's not. They are significant for a reason called deep true love!
---
Absolutely nothing.
---
Holy fuck that's good.

Only Rogues and blacksmiths. Note engineers. Or just who ever bought a thorium key off AH.
---
Sure sure, but can I be a shaman named Thex on 3 different servers? Or can I only be Thex Thexx and Thexxx on a single server?
---
It's doable, but still not *quite* there. I play in 4k/144Hz but I only get the full 144Hz in the open world. In packed cities, etc, I drop down to 90-100 in retail on everything fully maxed with HDR enabled. It looks absolutely incredible, but like I said, not quite full 144Hz all the time. Still 100% playable and a true treat to be honest. This is with a 5Ghz i9, Strix 2080 Ti, Samsung 970 Pro M.2 SSD, and 16GB ram FWIW. Monitor is an Acer Predator X27.
---
I heard “you’re such a god damn nerd”.
---
Playing to dick around is what you do with things that require low investment. A guesstimation for how many man hours it takes to make a thunderfury is 100. Even in the most casual of settings this investment means you should put in towards what would have the most return.
---
After you have 4 thunderfuries, sure give them to the rogue, it doesn't really matter, but to get through Naxx everyone in that guild is going to have 50 days /played on those characters at least, so making things easier will be a priority.
---
I can justify bringing Balance Druids and Ret Paladins because it doesn't really hurt anyone and it is more important for everyone to do what is fun, but a Thunderfury is special and giving it to a rogue is USELESS and lowers the performance of all 40 people in your raid. Rogue having a Thunderfury is only fun for the rogue, giving the tank Thunderfury is more fun for everyone.
---
I don’t think they plan to, which is the whole reason for this post in the first place, and I stated the reason why I think it would be beneficial in the post...
---
Good I hope I’m the minority because that means I can hit rank 14 before phase 3. And I know it’ll be insane based on prior experience and crunching the numbers on it. Why are you so mad that I have fun this way ?
---
Ohhhh
---
I'm excited to have that feature back! Instead of having to run to Org every damn time I get a new helm/cloak to xmog it *eye roll*
---
It does if you're trying to make a guild before someone snipes your guild name.
---
I don’t think there will be less world PvP because of it. The thing that kind of kills world PvP is battlegrounds.
---
Downvoting out of envy

Hey, Josh. I’ve only just discovered your podcast, but I’m having a blast going through and listening to the episodes. It’s been great hearing about WoW from various perspectives from past developers and gamers from all over the world. 
---
I never would have imagined there could be so many hours of podcasts dedicated to classic WoW. 
---
Also props on your solid podcasting skills. I’m not gonna pretend to know about the economics of podcasting, but it seems like something you could/should be doing full time if you aren’t already.

Tauren Warrior, at 60 planning on running a hybrid Arms/Prot spec for casual PvP and 5/10 man tanking, or offtanking Ony/MC/ZG pugs.  Some kind of 31/5/15 spec like this:

...the same way modern raids work? The same way they've always worked? The reason why some players want the old game; because semi-random weekly changes are annoying?
---
Nice Dodge m8, how much did it cost?
---
Once the guild outgears MC, the only reason to go back would be for TF bindings, which is basically 1/4 of a full run, or to gear some alts, which will be short runs due to overgeared chars crushing the content.
---
In m+, you only get rewarded on completion, you can only outgear it if you're running too low of a key level to be relevant (and going fast will result in a higher key that will be harder to crush easily), and there's no guarantee any gear that drops can even be given to the undergeared/alt.
---
What if there was a racial that rogues got 10% more gold from drops. Would you expect them to trade you you're share of that 10% after the dungeon?
---
NE priest is literally unplayable and everyone will mock you for picking an inferior race. also you will have a insanely hard time leveling due to NE being ultimative inferior to all other playable races.
---
/sarcasm
---
Man, should've just ran with the group to the dungeon entrance but kept a few feet behind, pretending like you'd walk out, then run back to the chest to ninja loot. Part of being a rogue is misdirection my friend!
---
They will probably keep record of your HK count, but no you will not get honor from past kills.
---
Perhaps, if you already out gear them, "lots of fights only last 1 minute."  I'm sure there is a hard to calculate sweet spot on trinkets pre-nax, but your snarky opinion doesn't really contribute to finding it.
---
This is going straight to the fucking top of the totem pole.
---
I agree with this. Warlock is the only class that can reliably take on 2-3 mobs without using a potion or cooldown
---
I'm assuming it will be 2 weeks before launch exactly so 6pm EST on the 12 for NA. Check back the weekend prior for more details.
---
Haha hehe
---
People feel very very strongly about shadowmeld + MC on /r/classicwow for some reason.

That s not true. Human warrior will be slightly more played counter all servers
---
Michael Jackson dancing everywhere.
---

---
Yes, beserking is valuable for just about every class that can be Trolls both in pve and pvp especially if you know how to optimize it.
---
Also thunderlord, ISOLLATOR was a legend. I remember the chets and solanrius and oberius (sp?) but I played alliance so i remember a lot more horde names. Only ones that come to mind on alli are heratli the twat and flowerpot.
---
edit: AND FUCKING BOSU, THAT STV CAMPING ASS.
---
You're the one equating it to a job, not us. We equate it to a sports team. If one of your starting players is late to a match, then there are consequences, regardless of the reason and those consequences are often much worse than a fine, it could be a total forfeit. The easiest consequence in WoW to keep track of and measure is a fine.
---
Run with it, boys. This one's out of the barn and needs to be in the wild.
---
Yes. You did give very poor reasons why you should get your video game servers names early.
---
&gt; Tokens absolutely have a limitation.   They aren't just creating gold  from nowhere someone still has to go out and make the gold to buy the  token.   
---
What are you talking about? Do you think when tokens where introduced they were close to worthless in retail? They had a set price that was changing. You irl money is and will be the only limit. This is not playerbased economy. Blizzard decides the price through some sort of algorythm and starting price.
---
This IS gold from nowhere. The purest form of economic cancer for video games. 
---
&gt; I also subscribe to the belief that tokens incentive blizzard actually  banning people for buying and selling gold.  Without them the gold  farmer is just another paying customer. 
---
I'm just going to lol on that. I'm done.
---
Lok’tar Ogar
---
Put resources into losing money? Why? They are buying the tokens from blizzard in the end. They would have to pay employees to go after, and ban people paying them money. 
---
If the shareholders found out their heads would explode.

I'm sorry but Guild Thexes?

---
The automod and mods won't let me post this question outside of this thread, so I guess I'm going to try and ask it here:
---
Are the recipes required for crafting bind on pickup or are they tradable?
---
I know there are a couple of posts on this subreddit listing what craftable items are BoP, but I'm wondering if the recipes you need to make the items are generally tradable. I know that some higher level recipes are dropped from raids and dungeons and I want to know if those are bound or available for trading/selling.
---
Why not? Youre swinging a 3.5 speed weapon to generate rage and using hamstring every 1.5s GCD.  You think you get enough rage from 1 hit to use 2.3 hamstrings? What if the hit glances, which happens 40% of the time and significantly reduces damage dealt and rage gained? Or gets dodged?
---
Well I only know stuff in pre raid bis level and quite basics. Like I don’t even know you can snowball yourself to dodge fall damage after rag hit u to the sky.
---
I'm so alone ;_;
---
&gt; People basically go NE priest to troll with shadow meld and MC people
---
Everyone I've spoken to on this subreddit is convinced it's the most effective strategy in the game.
---
Good for you, still sounds too much, but if you can manage it great. Cheers.
---
Exactly, I don't even know why it needs to be said. 
---
I'm rolling as Thex the Troll Shaman.
---
&gt;There’s been no indication that there’s an intent to do so and we’re less than two weeks out
---
But there is? They literally stated that they will give it out in advance of character creation when they announced that you can name characters 2 weeks in advance. 
---
&gt;Players with an active subscription or game time on their account will be able to create up to three characters per World of Warcraft account. We’ll have more information on realm names closer to launch, but rest assured—you’ll have plenty of time to figure out your plans for realm domination!
---
Lol I guess you can put 25pts into fury for imp slam, but then it’s just a tard fury spec with more points into arms.
---
Maybe, do you have natty light and gamecube?
---
Downvoted cause the options for answers weren't all "Thex"
---
That way I can try to aim on ground instead of lava with this trick to take couple less tick of lava damage then go back in
---
Excuse me but the gold that I spend as a raider keeps countless numbers of alchemists and enchanters and others gainfully employed and able to support their family of characters. That gold trickles down throughout the realm economy. Guilds levying taxes are not the solution to our problem, guild taxes are the problem. Guilds don't tax to get the gold they need, guilds always find a need for the gold they get.
---
Your completely anecdotal and highly unlikely personal experience aside, the point is that posts like these (this one really isn't that bad but still) are basically "dae The Wife get mad when you play vidya?? Females don't understand, amiright fellas". This is kind of alienating and really doesn't make a woman even want to play when you treat it like a no girls allowed tree fort.

What about our trusty vending machines?

As a European player I'm a bit disappointed that Dire Maul has been pushed back to phase 2. :/

Crafting take time ? yep is hard to go and BUY from AH . Running and compete with ppls for nodes is easy. Presing that botton "craft all " is fucking huge problem need like 200+ IQ
---
I mean it's a great meme thing to do i guess but hardly useful.
---
I thought it was funny too, but dontcha think if these chests weren't so "available" to the group, that they wouldnt be bummed to see the rogue take it? For example, rogues receiving an extra 10% more gold from drops, you wouldnt expect a rogue to trade you your share of that bonus after the dungeon. So just because this treasure chest isnt put directly into my inventory, everyone should get a piece of my pie
---
Yea the bid war runs where you knew you weren't getting any loot but you were gonna get a whole lotta gold

Glad I asked because I had Tuesday on my calendar and I was going to try and schedule a dr appointment the same day so I could get off work a little early and all that jazz.

Usually there's chat restrictions and such.

You are equating pve to a sport team which is by definition pvp?

HAHAHAHA this is what I meant when I said "I learned my lesson" the lesson was DONT GET CAUGHT

What if pigs could fly?
---
Being able to unlock stuff, is one of the few reasons to bring a rogue over other classes
---
To most the name is almost as important as the toon itself, and to lose out on it while you wait to coordinate which server between a group of people seems like a poor reason to potentially miss out.
---
It's also non existent without a tank and a healer
---
This is EXACTLY how I want it to play out. I want it to be like a good book you haven't read in a while.
---
There is a clear start and a clear finish. It would be really cathartic if this actually happened... wouldn't have to stress and worry about what shit blizzard would add onto Classic (looking at you Cataclysm)
---
He's clearly meeting with some Fraternity members from back in his college days "Zeta Upsilon Gamma" to discuss the logistics of a potential business merge or product partnership.

Smite’s Hammer is just a myth

did some poor guy really post that he wanted to name his shaman Thex, which resulted in a reddit meme and also gave him a zero percent chance of now getting that name?

EDIT:  oh lol i see now.  It's Shatner.

Because understanding the workings of a massive company is pretty simple.  They all do the same shit...it's not rocket science.

To master, both have very high skillcap. But to be good at easier, Mage.

Farm Bloodelfes in Azshara. They have very low armor and are in the level range for the best BOE epics. Plus they drop traveler's backpack and greater healing potions.
---
I can only speak to paladin since I haven’t played priest. I like humans for paladin. Removing stun is better than stoneform since paladins already have cleanse. That’s gonna remove 1 poison, disease, and magic effect each time you cast it.
---
Yes, dailies are SPECIFICALLY quests...
---
No. It's unnecessary. If I run a guild, then I'm pocketing every single BoE &amp; all unused crafting materials. That is more than enough to fund items and consumables for loyal guild members.
---
Only a fool would plan to play uninterrupted on launch day for a blizzard release. There were some BFA realms experiencing downtime and horrendous lag around launch and BFA is regarded as a relatively smooth expansion launch. Take that as you will.
---
We're speedrunners and world/realm first seekers, so yes, every raid is a competition. And not every sport is PVP in any case.
---
No, that would be a total hassle to figure out. This is a pretty simple situation.
---
&gt;This is not playerbased economy. Blizzard decides the price through some sort of algorythm and starting price.
---
Why is that? if the item is on AH then why is this not a simple case of supply and demand? how much gold is a subscription worth for the players and how much gold is paying the money for a subscription worth to the seller.
---
What do you mean special version? In what way was a server's "Kungen" similar to THE Kungen? Jw
---
No path available!
---
Impressive guide and thanks for sharing! Hope to see some druid macros working with the classic client before launch so i got them ready to go. With the leveling spec i would personally get the 5/5 furor right after feline swiftness, it's soooo nice to have early on. I can understand people rushing Hotw tho.
---
No one is trying to take your name. You’re a nobody.
---
i dont know why im crying at the club right now
---
Easier of the two to master? Neither...
---
Bless your heart.
---
When did I ever say I was mad? Lol. I thought it was funny is all... At the end of the day it's just video game. 
---
You asked if anyone else is doing this. I won't be. 
---
Regardless, best of luck to you! I hope you are successful!
---
every single priv server group i was in always gave the locked chest to rogue, despite me(the rogue) happily saying we should roll for it  
---
have to assume everyone acted that way as the rogue had to spend time leveling lockpick, so he put in the work, where the others didn't.  
---
i sure didn't mind
---
lol I agree, but I have had people argue with me to the death about how it's worth ignoring every other racial in the game for. 
---
I'm not even going to give my opinion on priest race and race specific spells ever again.
---
1. Enjoy the leveling experience because it is one of my favorite parts of the game.
---
2. Enjoy leveling professions again.
---
3. Run all of the 5 man dungeons
---
4. Hopefully clear through BWL (Probably won't ever see AQ40 or Naxx, but you never know)
---
5. Join a fun guild.
---
6. PVP a good bit.
---
You buy token with rl currency from blizzard that is redeemable for 1 month of gametime.  You then sell it to another player for gold they earned.  At no point is gold created from nowhere.
---
You're essentially overpaying for gametime and then selling it for gold which was created via normal game mechanics.
---
Edit: ofc they weren't worthless when they were first introduced you had mature servers with stockpiled gold.  On a fresh server they are only worth as much as people can pay so it will take a month or 2 for them to become valuable.
---
You know I fucking do m8.
---
You are doing a good job keeping the opinion unpopular, well done soldier.
---
Truly amazing spreadsheet!
---
To consider adding: Phase 2 Dire Maul Dungeon Drops: Tribute Chest from DMNorth which has many great items including the (2nd) best Druid Tank Item [Unyielding Maul](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18531)
---
&gt;Account 3: cost split with friends , used to spy on opposite faction via friends list and /who for phase 2 world pvp . In order for us to maximize honor we need to see where the most concentration of alliance players are so we can go gank them. 
---
Love how people have issues with mutliboxers but don't mind this garbage lol.
---
Doesn't sound obsessive at all...
---
Yeah man having a huge Lan party once my kid goes to bed. Going to invite all my friends that play WoW...
---
So really just my wife and I playing together for about an hour - her getting bored and asking me to come to bed to have sex and such...
---
I won't go of course - those boars won't kill themselves. Also that guy at Goldshire wants me to grab 6 morloc dongs for his stew. I can't let him down. Priorities woman!
---
We probably won't hear or see anything about clasic until the 13th/12th.
---
I would have one person just decided on the server and tell everyone else on the 13th/12th.
---
Hash out the server type before hand because past that it's a name... nothing more
---
On the most well known pserver that I cannot name due to subreddit rules, a guy deleted a rank 14 hunter and rerolled a new hunter of the same race with different hair.
---
This is something that doesn't get talked about enough. You can safely pick a class and not be worried about getting gutted further down the road. When I tried BFA out every patch I was sweating they would nerf me lol. On retail you almost want to pick a middle of the pack damage dealer bc you know after a few nerfs you'll be in a good spot, but on classic? Go ahead and roll that overpowered rogue!
---
We had just killed twin emps for the first time late in the evening and decided to try a pull on C'Thun to see what he was like. Suffice to say this was a huge (and hilarious) surprise to us. 
---
We had to spend about two full raid nights to figure out how to do the pull. The [fourth thing](https://youtu.be/F1xLXXGwA4s) we tried was quite hilarious as well, where we tried if it'd work if 39 of us put follow on a tank.
---
If those chest only contained rogue specific items, like poisons and powders, then yes sure.
---
But they have items that everyone can use.
---
Being able to unlock doors for shortcuts and chests for extra loot is one of the few perks of bringing a rogue to a dungeon
---
What benefit does going feline swiftness, omen of clarity, then finishing feral have when compared to going hotw then ns when leveling solo and duo on a pvp server?
---
We had a troll rogue in our guild named sweegy, he had a mod that told the guild who he killed and what lvl and the zone. This was before the honour system came out, and the names of the dead lvl 55-60 characters in ungoro and sylithus would just spam our guild chat. Definitely a legend in our guild.
---
Yes, but the thing is, as a warrior, if rogues start taking all the locked chests you know what class I'm going to stop inviting to my groups?
---
Yes, yes we are.
---
Holy fuck its Kold from Vis maior! Bonechewer rep here
---
The tryhards want you to use cookie cutter builds otherwise they'll dance in a circle around you chanting "meme spec".  Experimentation is for casuals!
---
&gt; in retail 
---
Classic has much lower requirements than retail.  You'll get 4k 144hz easy with your setup.
---
most MMORPG's with active subscription as the main income eventually resolves to using playtime tokens so I wouldn't be surprised either. It's just a naturally thing to do as it combats RMT and it boosts sales as players who cannot afford the game can suddenly play it (with someone richer paying for it)
---
CHANGE MY MIND
---
I think respec cost capping out at 50g is fine for level 60. 
---
However during the leveling phase it would be nice to experiment with different builds and not lose all your gold for your epic mount.
---
It will also encourage people to play multiple specs and learn your entire class than just one spec.
---
Oh please, spare me.  Trickle down is proven not to work.  In theory, sure, it's a great idea, but what actually happens is that the richest players invest that gold into power leveling professions on their alts, not buying trade/crafting services from others.  If they *had* to go to a 3rd party Alchemist to get their flasks, it might work, but when they have an alt with max Alchemy it just doesn't play out that way.  Meanwhile, you have a new player trying to get out there and sell his alchemy services to a population that doesn't need him, and he can't even afford his weekly respec to PvP on the weekends.
---
Maybe with regulation in place forbidding the richest players from bankrolling their alts we could see some actual progress, but until that comes to pass, higher taxes are the only way.
---
Eh, I like having to commit.
---
Everyone knows this, why does this need to be posted?
---
Pvp kills won't be recorded before phase 2.
---
Bgs are in phase 3.
---
Only way to rank during phase 2 is to open world pvp - have fun if y'all ain't 60 by phase 2!
---
Night Elf Priest looks amazing and has great animations.  That’s a good reason!
---
Most recipes from dungeons and the open world are tradable, as well as some from quests. As far as raids go, I'm not 100% sure, but I feel like most of them will also be tradable.
---
like no one ever was
---
if you are a world first or speedrunner guild you don't have people pay 25g if they wipe you, you kick them from the guild lol goodluck buddy.
---
Druid since day one. I fear nothing
---
I have no idea what half of you are typing, but i'd love to play with nordics and would also love to avoid streamers and mafias.
---
I would assume so, to a degree - I've never been apart of one though.  To me it's a way of balancing out the fact that ~10% of a guild normally ends up covering the bottom ~50%. I don't think it's necessary but get the merit.
---
Athene, best pally in the world!
---
Yeah, one of them is actually useful.
---
A new meta is emerging where competent 5 man teams blending questing and dungeoning to yield incredible XP per hour numbers. While traditional leveling routes will still be the optimal route to level, average players will typically get 10-12 days played from 1-60. Taking a player from this position and then having them practice to yield numbers closer to 5 days takes a ton of effort and dedication. Dungeon Grinding shows instant results. You can take a player who isnt as familiar with his leveling route and place him with 4 other killers and they can immediately cut their leveling time in half. This is especially true for classes that traditionally level slower, like warrior.
---
&lt;Dungeon Grind&gt; NA PvP Alliance CST (server tba) We are building a guild full of duo levelers including duo pairs, spell cleavers and melee cleavers. We are closing in on 100 members. Many of our teams are missing their final players to round out their comp. We provide you with the opportunity to access our spreadsheet of users and find someone to level with on your journey to 60. Whether you are a hardcore nolifer and need the last man to fill out your team of 5, or you are a casual guy looking for a friend to play with on weekends, we aim to link you with like-minded players. The strength of this opportunity is its guild format. The hardest part of leveling as a team, is finding 4 other committed players who adhere to the schedule and are reliable. The reality of running many cleave teams simultaneously is that some of them will inevitably fail, but this is actually our strength. By opting to roll with a guild of cleavers, you have the opportunity to salvage your team and collaborate with other partial teams to save your grind team. We have numerous perks, like level 1 alts that will be logged in at all times and can be added to your party to act as your 6th member and will convert to raid and reset to port your team back to the dungeon entrance in an effort to maximize your efficiency. Hit 60 fast, with your pre BiS and make lasting connections a long the way. Then transition quickly into rading with other players who have achieved 60 and pre BiS early on.
---
Consider dungeon grinding and consider Dungeon Grind - message me on discord at Corey#6648 for more details.
---
I think a party of 5 people beat a single player so it is not so much about what is the fastest class but more what is the best combo to level fastest from 1-10.  
---
Not even sure how xp is in party when leveling maybe solo is faster but I doubt it.  
---
I think with a full group you could just fight monster which are 3 levels above you and get better xp/hour and hit 10 sooner.
---
The statistics are actually skewed the opposite way - they are inflated by some people marrying, divorcing, marrying, divorcing... The majority get married and stay married.
---
It's not that weird when you consider really young people marry, they don't have respect for the commitment or don't yet realize what it is.
---
Sitting around on Reddit shitting on marriage sounds pretty neckbeardy. Marriage is what you want it to be, if you don't want kids, you wouldn't marry someone who does. You wouldn't marry someone who is controlling or doesn't respect your hobbies.
---
Ever played on private servers?
---
Valtieri for president!
---
Swifty
---
I did see a dude named Apnslickback
---
with a 5% drop rate? yeah. 
---
I thought it was more like 20%.
---
100%.  Have done so with my friends for every expansion since Burning Crusade, when we were all in college.  These days it's with our wives, and the fare has evolved from double cheeseburgers from McDonalds to more adult foods, but it's the same shenanigans.
---
Paladins and Hunters on my Rogue.
---
&gt; testing portraits
---
Huh... I never thought of that part. Once I get a helmet it won't really matter though.
---
Fair enough. But 2g would still be a sizable tax to pay to switch and switch back while leveling.
---
Paladin. Too many defensive CDs.
---
Hahaha ya. It's gonna mess with the class distribution a bit, but some people like being the underdog ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I main Druid too but if I get Hunter Marked marked out in the world I want to kms haha. Hunter is definitely my closest matchup and I definitely need that opener for it
---
As a warrior, everything pretty much

Awesome, thanks. I'll write that down. That part of the sheet took forever and I knew I'd be missing some things
---
While human is technically min max for combat - I doubt you'll ever be in a situation where you're going "man if I was human I would have been #1 dps"
---
You don't get gold cap by "farming".  You need to work the AH.
---
Mage as any class.
---
If there's even slight chance of them losing, they'll just sheep you and run the fuck away while you're stuck there for what feels like an eternity.
---
I think the rogue has all the right to keep the chest since if there was no rogue that would be no chest so just imagine there is no rogue in the party and there is no problem.
---
If you don't get the roll option then there is nothing to share right?
---
No you always share the loot. The group helped you reach that point in the dungeon. Besides spread the love and you'll find it comes back. Healers and tanks especially usually have a hard time finding gold.

As hunter:

Pallys in group.

Same here.  There are times I have so much fun running a dungeon leveling because its a great break from questing/grinding that I want to run it again.  Unfortunately its difficult to find a group that's willing to run the same dungeon back to back.
---
75 Strength for a full minute. That is 150 AP for a full minute. A good raid leader may even call for all furies to put on flask and pop all cds at the same time.You will be sitting there with your sub par shoulders and no trinket doing a small portion of the dmg the rest of the furies pump out. 
---
Vael literally kills your tank every 45 seconds. This fight is usually not much longer than a minute and Flask is worth it just for that. 
---
Never mind all the time you spend farming MC in later raid tiers. Many bosses dying in 1 minute, while you cleave 3 adds with 150 bonus AP. Don't skip this trinket. You can also just throw it on pop it for some big trash mob cleave and then swap it back again for the next pack. SOmetimes you pop it before the pull with your RObot Chicken and swap to your normal trinkets, but still have 150 AP for 1 whole minute.
---
Thats not a hard to find sweetspot. Thats you giving up the equivalent of 2-4 pieces of gear in a fight (150 ap) bc you are too lazy to farm truestrike when you could just tank, make the group, and not invite rogues.
---
very quick google search got me this
---
which has teh time breakdowns
---
Hunter; Paladin with their "out-last you" play style(I think that was before Viper sting), Warlocks using Soul Link, and anyone with Naxx gear. :D

Very true! Not that I'm trying to elitist and stop people who enjoy playing Priest from playing Priest. But yes, as you are saying there will people many people who don't really play Priest in the long run for valid reasons.

I really wanted to include in this post, something about how these no roll option on chest loot! It's a reasonable point!

Experimentation is for casuals because they are the ones who haven't experimented yet. The reasons tryhards use cookie cutter builds is because the experimenting is over, the results are in.

Athene is still streaming every day btw.  [www.twitch.tv/athenelive](https://www.twitch.tv/athenelive)
---
I don’t think we have enough data to say how many there will be either way, but there are hundreds of imaginable scenarios that could lead to a lot of different outcomes where Classic becomes a run away success. 
---
Here are a couple of factors off the top of my head which I think will likely have the effect of increasing the subscription base of Classic
---
1) The gaming market is larger than ever and continues to increase: 
---
Size of PC gaming market in 2011: $15.9 billion 
---
Size of PC gaming market in 2018: $29.6 billion
---
2) Large streamers have said that they will stream Classic. The effect of this is hard to quantify.
---
3) Each expansion for WoW has always had spikes in subscription base before a severe drop off. These could be the people that are still wanting what the older versions of the game could give them, but do not find satisfaction in the new form of the game.
---
4) The design of classic promoted socialization. Social groups are very sticky and will cause people to stay in the game for much longer than in other games. People were swept up in Vanilla and will be swept up again. Basic psychology and motivating factors for people do not change across single generations.
---
There are many other possible factors that could increase the number of people trying Classic and sticking around.
---
Why is it just repairs for tanks and not repairs for plate.  
---
Yeah I get it tanks have trouble farming, but they also get the all the loots and the thunderfury. 
---
Fucking tanks.
---
I don't know which trinket you're talking about, sorry mate xD
---
I would assume it is the same time the server goes live but you never know with Blizz
---
Please welcome Asmengold and Sodapopin
---
As a stealthy it is my goal to open any sitting mage for the free kill lol
---
So first you say that there are numerous reasons why anyone would be late and shouldn't have to pay a fine but that there are absolutely zero reasons why anyone could wipe a raid and still remain in the guild...
---
People make mistakes, those mistakes have consequences, it doesn't mean they aren't still worth having on the team. By your logic, there would only ever be a single professional sports team because the others would disband the moment they lost a game.
---
Yeah I'm totally fine with 8 Shamans in a Raid! (if you mean Shamans in your comment)
---
You can charge people with patterns a commission (e.g. 30% of their profit). We did it and it ended up helping pay for things like weekly tank flasks and free weapon enchants for all prepared raiders
---
Will these macros work with the new client? It looks like the old engine macros from the 1.12 client?
---
So ore, skins, and herbs from a dungeon are group loot? To be split and sold or used? It took the party to get to them.
---
I think blizzard “fixed” this in BC by having blue and green items in chests bring up the loot roll box.
---
Our rogues always offered up greens, rolled out blues, and kept the rest of whatever was in a locked chest.
---
www.wowclassicbis.com
---
I rather Blizzard get the mechanics right with no server crashes come launch then focus on fluff like graphics. There can be a later update with graphics and what not in stage 3 or 4 for another influx of newcomers.
---
As a mage I generally dislike fighting hunters. Viper + scatter shot + annoying pet. I basically need to kill them in one dead zone shatter combo.
---
Right, what harm I could do!
---
Outside of Asia, WoW tokens are not just worth game time, they're worth $15 Blizzard Balance, which can be used in any game for any purchase.
---
Usually if something doesn't make sense, it's for a good reason. AKA there is some fuckery afoot here.
---
Either OP is being totally honest or there is some shit going on in the background at his company he doesn't know about.
---
But would you? Why or why not?
---
If you're self esteem is low, or if someone who is controlling brainwashes you into believing it's for your own good, or convinces you that your hobbies are garbage and you need them in order to not fail in life you would most definitely marry them. Call me a neckbeard all you want but marriage is a sham that does more harm than good.
---
However I do agree with you that the statistics might be misleading and not at all accurate.
---
Rogues.  
---
I play a warlock.
---
What goes through people's minds when they post shit like this.  Do they really think blizzard is going to painstakingly recreate classic as best as they possibly can down to the most minor details and then implement some tiny change that some random posted on reddit?
---
And the other player CHOSE rogue. You could have chose rogue if you wanted. I don't really see a difference here.
---
well thats dependent on where you are in the world actually
---
Since PVP ranks and more important their rewards were not at the start in classic they decided they don't want it directly in and add it with the other things in phase 2.  
---
Else you could just add everything from AQ, Naxx and AV and say have fun.  
---
Since we as the players wanted the same sort of playing they will add things in phases.
---
Honestly the one modern feature I would be happy with them adding to classic is dual spec (the way it was in wrath)
---
I don't miss the days of grinding gold to keep up with my 2 respects a day habit (going between raiding and pvp specs)

---
It has nothing to do with you.
---
all of them, im a pacifist lol
---
Oh, my god, I totally missed that. 
---
So you would pay a priest for ress? These arguments are stupid. You share the loot in the chest.. You charge for boxes!
---
Because as a warrior I can't open the chest without a rogue, and as a rogue, you can't get to the chest without a warrior, it's a team effort. Whereas everyone or no one can have mining, it's not a team effort.
---
Til tomorrow?  Bruh
---
There is no way for Blizz to protect against this besides granting one IP address to one account. People did this back in 2005-2006.
---
I didnt think people would remember Aedak.  Ming was still relevant in tbc aswell.
---
Sure am! I'm fortunate enough to have a house full of players and am the de facto host for friend events! We'll be hosting all weekend!
---
I doubt it as it was not done back then so should not be done now #nochange
---
As you'll be gradually getting used to the idea of "game-time" becoming a thing of the past, I suggest rolling a druid so you can at least level efficiently without relying on others or spending time waiting for groups.  
---
I mean this in all seriousness.  You may be the fortunate type of gamer/father where the SO handles more of the day-to-day tasks, or you may be required to be more involved and interruptions will be frequent and unplanned.  I plan on rolling a druid for these reasons as my time to play will be limited to short bursts and I want to be self-reliant.
---
Yes, if you want waste that much time splitting few ores between each member, you should be able to do that.
---
Also, people do DME jump runs with a miner specifically so they could split the thorium ores at the end
---
Yeah its a good thing I'm talking about retail gold...
---
The whole point is that you should be leveling and learning to play a spec and not just swapping at the press of a button, especially if you’re a new player. If you’re a veteran player then you should  know how to make enough gold that respec costs aren’t an issue.
---
From a fantasy standpoint a lifelong frost mage (Jaina?) doesn’t just wake up one day and decide they’re gonna specialize in fire spells instead and be equally competent.
---
Oh wait august first blizzard is going to go a PSA about how classic development stopped and they have to cancel the launch..................
---
Shadowpriests also dont take tier sets at all and roll for what most people would consider off-pieces. So you'll gear your raid faster by just taking a spriest.
---
as a noob, i'd recommend hunter.  you can always make a warrior later, but it would be a harsh introduction to the game to start off leveling with the (by far) worst leveling class in the game.  Hunter, on the other hand, is probably the best leveling class in the game.  
---
Also, if you go hunter first, you will have money to give to your extremely gear dependent warrior when you decide to finally roll him/her.
---
Same here!  W - F because Tuesday is kind of a waste.  Though I might try to go in early and leave early on Tuesday.
---
Humans remove stun?
---
A conditional GAN wouldn't produce options that exist in classic.
---
which is useless if hes interested in classic.
---
I really dislike the OSRS comparison for having content post-naxx. The games are nothing alike.
---
I appreciate the response, and I think you're right that we don't really have enough data to say for sure. You bring up some good points, although I don't necessarily disagree with them.
---
IMO:
---
1). The gaming market is bigger, but it's growing in the opposite direction of games like WoW (and especially like WoW Classic). The biggest games recently have focused on solo, competitive experiences that have a very low barrier to entry. As a game, you can't get further away from WoW than Fortnite -- and that's gaming's recent gargantuan success.
---
Likewise, games that *do* have social interaction have embraced the retail WoW mindset of having the game do the group finding/social interaction for you. While old gamers don't like this, younger ones seem to not mind -- or prefer it, depending.
---
2). I agree -- this is a wildcard!
---
3). I think there's good evidence for this (the WoD launch, for example). I think, though, a lot of players are looking for not just the "classic" experience, but the "TBC" or "WotLK" experience. Classic WoW might give them what they want, but I'm unsure if it will.
---
4). I agree with this, too. I think the real "addictive" portion of WoW is the social element. Personally, I don't think Classic will have greater numbers than retail, but I *do* think it'll be more stable and lose players slower.

Sure that’s a fair point I understand the dungeon is a group effort 100%. The chest however is not a group effort. They were happy to complete the dungeon thinking it couldn’t be opened, and it wouldn’t have been opened if they invited a feral Druid or any other dps and everyone would be happy. Every class has perks. The tank and healers perk is they will always be in highest demand for dungeons. They can choose not to bring a rogue you can’t choose not to bring a tank or healer. Paladin and warlock get their mount. Mages can portal around and get free drinks. Saying that a major benefit of playing rogue is required to be shared with the group isn’t fair to them. If your friend played warlock and you leveled together is he required to pay half your mount cost because his is free? You can’t open it rogue can. That’s the end of the debate if they share what only they can acquire that’s up to them. Don’t invite rogues. Just like if a mage didn’t give out water at the start you probably wouldn’t invite them back.
---
You didn't mention it but you should really go Hunter.  As a casual, Hunter is the fastest leveler by far, and excels at solo.  You also won't have a lot of time to run dungeons, and hunters are not hear dependent.  Most importantly, you will not have much competition for raid slots, and you will hear up much faster because there is no competition from other classes for Hunter gear.
---
Paladins can wear plate at 40, same as warriors.  No class can wear plate at level 1.  Warlocks are fun and useful but you won't be posting big damage numbers, idk if that is something you care about.  Rogue is self-explanatory.  Good DPS, very strong pvp, pretty strong at leveling too.  Also the most popular class, so there is competition for groups and raid slots.  As a casual, you may struggle to get raids as a rogue.
---
Undead warlock.  
---
Going to be an absolute unit.  
---
Fell in love with undead warlocks thanks to the cinematic, been a warlock at heart ever since.
---
Some phases have very little added content, such as phase 2 (end of layering, intro DM and honor system) and phase 4 (dragons and ZG).  I think the prior phases 1 &amp; 3 should be as short as possible to get the small additions into the main game ASAP.  The other phases have a lot more meaningful stuff like a 40 man raid, or doing pvp with out instanced BGS.  Because they are adding large pieces of content, the stages before them should be based on if the server is ready for the new phase to roll out.  If your server has multiple raids speed clearing BWL and pugs getting up to chromag, then you should get phase 5 introduced to start collecting rep for the AQ scepter event.
---
Dun mat, if a serial killer gets away with murder because he isn't caught - does it make it right?
---
You can't spam dungeons in classic wow.
---
Are you ashamed of what you have been saying here and don't want your guild to find out / ruin your guilds "reputation" ? lol that's pretty sad
---
I was being a bit hyperbolic ;P I don't sincerely believe GRRM was playing Horde on Thunderlord in 2004-2006, nor do I believe ISOLLATOR inspired the books
---
A rogue can get to the chest with a paladin or druid, especially while leveling, so no, a rogue would not "need" a warrior.
---
I’ll consider it - maybe a bit of testing is needed
---
1. Shaman 2. Gnome mage 3.Gnome lock or hunter. This isn’t based of the random unverified opinion of a boomer but consistent findings within the speed running community
---
It is what? Did you read the post?
---
Capped at 1g. It is currently not capped at 1g. Its capped at 50g with a very slow decay. The decay rate is 5g every month. It would take 8 months to get to 10g, which is the minimum.
---
Probably KingBob or Naofumi or LizardMan. All seek entertaining to hear people call me. Gonna play a warrior tank
---
Would I? No, it's not worth the effort. 
---
A locked chest however, will be typically worth more than all the ores in the dungeon.
---
Where exactly do you get your data from? Some people have bloated expectations, others don't. How do know how many people's expectations are unrealistic and who's aren't? 
---
I'm in the "hitting 6 in week 2" boat that you specifically called out. I know I'll hit it because I've done the research, I've practiced my route, I'm taking a week off of work, I'm playing 144 hours in the first week (which works out to 6 days played) and I'm continuing that grueling pace into week 2 until I'm 60 and farming Preraid BiS gear.
---
I expect the majority of people who have targeted 60 at week 2 are aware of what it takes to get there and have planned accordingly.
---
Escape artist is nice for PvP, although being an alliance warlock sucks because of will of the forsaken.  If you don't care about PvP, the increased reputation you get from human is nice.  You do get the increased intellect for being gnome, but it's pretty minor and you generally will not go out of mana anyway because of life tap.  If you want to PvP though, escape artist can be a life saver.
---
Wat
---
So you would consider it ninja-looting if a non-miner demanded to roll for the ores and the miner said, "no, I chose mining, I get the ores"?
---
So, crafting 50 items that take 10 seconds each doesn't take time? It take minutes.
---
Skilling up herbalism, mining or skinning doesn't take much of your time and adds a lot of extra gold to you, which you can use to purchase items, potions, mount etc to lvl up faster.
---
Rogues are already a class that a lot of warriors won't want to bring to groups because they need to compete with them for DPS gear, giving them another reason not to bring them isn't a good idea.
---
But if they add nothing other than the ability to buy and sell tokens then all they'll be worth on a classic server is gametime.
---
I mean that is pretty scummy of you as well? All good though, you do you.
---
So they state that August 27th is release day, but here in the northeast of NA we're going to get it on the 26th.  Does that mean (as the title implies) that we get character creation one day earlier than the 13th?
---
It's clearly an error, and pointing out that warlocks won't be overpopulated like mages.
---
Yes.
---
So because a rogue has a more profitable profession, they are forced to use it for you?
---
Ok, we should all stop posting discussion related posts and just stick to the 600000014th what class should I play posts.
---
Like Sex, but with TH replacing the S, and the aforementioned TH making the same sound as it does in 'the' or 'thought'.
---
What an angel
---
Not ashamed - just common sense. Your Reddit history is enough that we would never even consider you as a boosting customer let alone a guild member.
---
All I'm saying is that DPS are a dime a dozen, don't give people another reason not to want to bring your class to the dungeon, especially when you're already competing with the tank for DPS gear.
---
I think going with monkeynews' quote, "always level in pvp spec," is what had me abandoning an efficient level talent choice like OoC and going for resto after level 40.  I will probably also start my first talent point in balance before putting 39 into feral for the hotw/ns build.  I was just reaching out and seeing how you felt your suggested talent build was for a pvp server start.
---
That's not shit advice and you don't have to swear just because you're ignorant.
---
You'll make new friends on your server. Trying to play with pre-existing friends is fine but never swap factions or realm types because you have no assurances they'll still be playing 6 months from now. One of my guildies taught me that when I was contemplating changing servers to play with some IRL friends.
---
A seniority list or first come first serve policy works fine and is fair as long as its mentioned when your hired.
---
Since it seems you are playing alliance, clearly, you deserve to be ganked king.
---
Yeah, Hunter can be pretty casual friendly. Never seriously leveled one so I’ll see. Also, having a pet is a great pro and helps with solo content.
---
Rogue has lots of competition for groups, so that narrows it down. 
---
Warlocks? I don’t mind not doing the best in the group. Their toolset is unique and nice, too. 
---
Paladins just seem to me like a mix between healer and DPS no matter what unless they’re Prot, which sounds kinda fun but not too engaging. 
---
Suppose my choices are Paladin, Warlock, Hunter now! Thanks for your input
---
unless you are dungeon grinding solo is faster you get massively reduced xp in a group =/
---
If Blizzard adds WoW Tokens to Classic, they'll almost certainly add all the other paid character services to Classic beyond realm transfer.
---
Yeah. There is still plenty of time for that 2 week notice..
---
I think Blizz said we'd have the realm names before the 13th with "Plenty of time to plot our realm domination" or something like that. 
---
If they don't give us the realm names in advance that's going to suck balls.  I'm trying to coordinate a server with like 10 other people and we all have our names picked out.
---
Is Warlock raiding really just spamming shadowbolt with the occasional corruption?
---
I found this weekend on a private server that if you keep going south along the coast of dun morough, about to the point of the cold ridge valley area, there will be a house and a dock that has some NPCs. I swam just south of there and BAM, I was technically in westfall. Died and rezzed at the sentinel hill graveyard.
---
Your math is wrong.
---
The top contributor gets 13,000 RP at the end of the week.

At 10k RP per week, you'll be Rank 10 at 2 months and Rank 11 at 3 months.
---
At 11k RP per week, you'll be Rank 11 at 2 months and Rank 12 at 3 months.
---
At 12k RP per week, you'll be Rank 11 at 2 months and Rank 13 at 3 months.
---
I'm taking off the first week of September. Hopefully they got it straightened out by then.
---
You nerds need to stop stealing my toon name. I'm the original troll shaman Thex!
---
In my experience, sharing locked chests is one of the many unspoken rules of running dungeons.
---
yeah, that might work, depending on mob armor and level, and depending on how druids play: I think that faerie fire is different depending on if you are in elf/cow form or bear form.
---
HAHAHAHA!
---
MadSeason does it for the love of the game, not for the necessity. He's been making Classic/Vanilla related content for years. Yes, some of it may seem a little on the nose at times, but it has more to do with a passion of the game.
---
Quick edit: he's also noted in his Deadmines guide that he's going to be going through every dungeon with a guide. This just happens to have been the next in the series. This man is all about the documentation and the preservation of history at times it seems.
---
Guess ppl need to state the rules b4 starting (I agree with your points)
---
Good way to buy mats for te raid's designated nightfall bitch
---
I bet his amror's all oiled up and READY TO GO.
---
You can not look at that thread then..
---
Kneegrow
---
Orc is better for pvp because of stun resist while troll is better pve for berserking. I’m going troll because I can’t stand orc casting animations even though I plan to pvp more with my shaman.
---
im in a guild that was asking 20 gold tax to raid, but all the "element" protection potion are supplied, fire for MC, Frost for Azu, Shadow for Kazzak.  For the rest of consum you bring your shit
---
I found that resonable.
---
Unless the numbers changed drastically from when you posted, the most played recent expansion is BfA. I made the same mistake initially too because Cata has a similar green.
---
Well things like this should just be a given, if it's found in the dungeon and people want to split it, then it gets split. If we start listing every little rule then each message in world chat or w/e will be 15 lines long.
---
He didn't say each phase, just phase 1 for anything longer than 2-3 months may kill the game
---
Phases like 3 and 4 (4 especially, I believe it's BGs AND ZG? I could be mistaken)  can easily last 3-4 months .
---
In total the 6 phases should last about 18-20 months imo, with a tbc or vanilla+ content planned for 6-12 months after phase 6 is concluded
---
I'm gonna miss instant cast ghost wolf (the talented version from tbc)
---
That is the "for release" option.
---
Probably not for the average guy but I know boosters who made sooo much gold during the Ghuun and Jaina boost craze, not sure if they are still boosting, we're talking hundreds of millions, multiboxing multiple accounts advertizing in trade and dungeon finder (even though it was against ToS it was profitable to buy new accs and keep doing it)
---
The cost is very affordable, since no one needs to respec more than once or twice during the 1-60. The fee is an incentive to be absolutely certain you want to put points there, to double-check and triple check what you're wanting to do with your character. As you get to 60 it's even more affordable and merely serves to nudge you to commit to learning one spec and stick with it while the decay occurs. 
---
As you level you might want to switch from one spec to another and you're able to do it, but you now must decide if you'd rather have more gold or have a new spec. What is it worth to you? You can experiment pretty cheaply at first for the first change or two, which is okay since there are only 3 talent trees so there are limited options anyway.
---
You could always have a holy pallie apply wisdom
---
Oh, my bad. They didn’t add that until WotLK. Perception is their racial in classic. Kinda conditional for finding rogues which is nice in BGs. I’d say human vs dwarf is whatever you prefer. But humans also get sword and mace specialization. Plus a 5% spirit boost.
---
He was mentioned on a Formula 1 broadcast and Duck Dynasty as well.

Mine was Sim_Man because I loved playing The Sims and I'm a guy. The creativity of a 10 year old.

We welcome any adventurer looking for a Semi-Hardcore raiding Guild where you can meet new people for the ultimate Classic WoW experience. We believe in a non-rushed, friendly leveling experience where both veterans and new players can thrive. This isn't a pre-made exclusive group, but rather a fresh new guild open to any background. 
---
**Raiding:** We are spending two nights a week starting at 9pm CST on Friday &amp; Saturday raiding. We will use a Loot Council for distribution of gear. We are not a hardcore group and will not require you to grind out 24/7 or have the best gear ASAP, but we still want members to do what's necessary in order to complete the raids. Looking to step into MC between weeks 6-8 (Week 8 being the latest).  
---
**Class Priority:**   
---
Warrior (Prot): Medium  
---
Warrior (Dps): High  
---
Rogues: High  
---
Priests: High  
---
Hunters: Medium  
---
Druid: Medium  
---
Mages: High  
---
Warlocks: Medium  
---
Paladins: High  
---
**PVP:** Early on we plan on making groups for World PVP (especially World Bosses) and protecting our guild mates from gankers. Once Phase 3 roll out, we will run PVP every week for BGs.
---
Feel free to message me on discord or join our discord for any questions. Hope to see you there!

Never had that back in the day.  Wouldn't join a guild with it today.
---
Every player is already responsible for gearing and loading up on their own consumables, what value does a guild tithe provide?  Guilds in vanilla don't provide much more than a formal way to group a large number of players.  There's no guild repairs/storage or perks like in retail.
---
There is going to be a few variants but there are specs that's are pure and simply the best. I.e. imp life tap... It has a direct impact on dps therefore it's an absolute given
---
Only resto Shaman.  Sorry!
---
Hello, I am Thex.
---
Yea the fact that you continue to reference people as shitters makes me think you are also pretty bad. Sorry to hear it.
---
We did! Took a long time, but we got him a couple months before the Naxx release afaik. We even managed to kill Ouro and Viscidus after that.

I don’t get it.. people bitch for blizzard to come out with vanilla servers. Now they finally do. And all I see is this, more bitching and wanting changes. It’s a vanilla remake not design your own game. Wtf
---
Close enough. I think i may have lost count on the lowest possible or smth.
---
only thing worth taxing in classic wow is DKP, to stop inflation. Other than that it's not necessary.
---
Introducing WoW Tokens would guarantee that Blizzard plans to treat 3rd party gold selling in Classic the same way they do in Retail, which means no action at all. So people would still buy gold from 3rd parties because you can get almost twice as much for the same price and Blizzard doesn't take a 25% cut.
---
Thanks, friend.
---
Don't they get Nova at 10? Mages do have polymorph and  water pre 10 though.
---
Anyone know if we need to have BFA downloaded? Or is classic desperate entirely? Played 2 months of BFA and I’d love to delete it.
---
Hey man. Do you happen to have some screenshots of this setup?
---
Hulksmashs fury pvp video is always one that comes to mind.
---
But you have to realize that the vast majority of people don't have the issues you describe, and simply found someone they want to spend the rest of their life with.
---
The gold adds up quick that’s for sure
---
Well obviously not looking at the comments in this thread. Everyone seems egotistical and doesn't seem to care at all about the group mentality sadly. Know which ppl I won't keep playing with.
---
The tanks also go through the trouble of gathering tanking gear, leveling their weapon skills etc. Should all of the loot belong to them? Without them there would be no bosses killed.
---
He has to put in twice the work to have two different gears after all.
---
No I did not!
---
Well done, but...
---
Elves in the horde, smh
---
Not joking, that guy isn't going to get that name. There are people that will take pleasure knowing that they have stolen the name, that is why you don't tell people what you are going to reserve.
---
I have a nightelf themed Sylvaneth/Elf army for Warhammer Age of sigmar which I am currently working on. Check 'em out @humpelminis on Instagram.
---
Holy shit that's pretty detailed. Man I wish I had talent. Just any kind of talent lol.
---
If the tanks die, everyone dies.
---
There is a distinct difference between pre-honor and post-honor patch. Phase 1 world pvp is just about the fun of it. Phase 2 is an open world honor grind and a hellscape. BG's actually even this out a bit.
---
When packs of lvl 60s farm every lvl 52+ trying to quest ... you will know, oh yes, you will know.
---
This is how I plan to play to have fun , I’ve done enough casual sight seeing play throughs of classic
---
I want to off tank. Druid or Warrior? I keep flip flopping.
---
If I'm warrior I want to be tank 3 or 4(so I can be fury). That's a thing right? 
---
I want to be able to farm my consumables and actually defend myself in world pvp...
---
Very worried about that if I'm a prot warrior
---
Lol you’re deranged
---
Hey, thanks for getting in touch, it means a lot. I have found a different guild that seems like the best fit for me. Best of luck to you with your WoW Classic guild!
---
Don't remember trash pulls eh?
---
Yeah boi, I envy your mud huts.
---
Yes, really.
---
Should at least get a flair in this sub that says Thex
---
I'm Theodore from Texas, and everyone knows that Texas *was* a country at one point, so mine is:  Thex
---
That may be true but it just reinforces my point that mages without nova or a wand are going to be slower than warlocks
---
Every single person in here saying "pay for a guild? What a rip off!!" Is a leech or doesnt understand how endgame raiding works. Where do you think your tanks 100g titan flask comes from? The mana pots used by healers on progression? What about supporting your lucky tank or hunter who gets both bindings? Or things like nightfall or thorium bro set?
---
A person who joins a guild only thinking of their own progression will probably be phased out as the guild gets further into progression. Raiding in Vanilla is a group effort and if all you expect to do is bring your "sick skillz(tm)" to a raid you are missing a huge part of it.
---
If you're guild doesnt keep an excel available to officers or you don't trust your GL then you should probably hop to a guild you do trust.
---
Isn't it easier than running to teldrassill at lvl 5, skipping skilling for levels at end just to farm winterspring frostsaber? Same time taken but less time wasted.
---
Living action potions are your friends!
---
I have unlimited PTO at my company so who cares
---
My name starts with Be and my favorite country is America, so naturally the name I got was Thex
---
I heard he was kind of an idiot anyway.
---
#NoChanges. Study it. Absorb it. Realize they aren't going to add this dumb little tweak for you.
---
A lot of classes are spamming one spell, or maybe 2. The most variety is probably in healing as a priest or something. 
---
In retail you have less mana issues and can basically use what you in order to push your DPS/HPS to the limit. In classic the focus is less on DPS/HPS and more on mana preservation. And the best way of doing so is spamming your most mana efficient spell. This isnt just a warlock thing, all classes suffer from this in classic.
---
Yeah rip everyone in their 50s in phase 2.
---
I don't realize that. I see more messed up couples in my day to day life than happy ones. I constantly read more about abusive relationships than happy ones here on reddit. Arranged marriages are still a thing, maybe not legally enforced but culturally or religiously mandated. From my point of view hardly anyone finds "the one" and spend the rest of their life happily ever after with them. Your perspective might differ from mine but to me that just means you are very fortunate and I hope you are never disappointed.

---
I used to delete characters so I'd stop playing them. My first 60 was a shadow priest.. and I could never get into a raid without healing. It made me so mad. I just wanted to play Shadow.. I rerolled a warlock, and even still I'd get "Can you come on your priest and heal?".. so I deleted him. Now who got the last lau..... wait. True story.
---
I loved playing with Lego, when I was a child and Las Vegas is a cool city at night. So naturally, the name I got was Thex
---
Arenas in BC was a total blast.  Such a pity its impossible to balance.
---
I'm not sure what hoagie shop you're referencing.
---
I’ve never played shaman, only seen videos of their speed runs but my guess is that it has to do with utility, little downtime and consistent damage. Once they get r1 rockbiter wep, not only can they dish out solid range damage but they have decent melee damage for when they need to regen or finish off a mob. 
---
I believe they also get rank 1 earth shock fairly early on and when you combine a low cd interrupt with being able to heal, it’s fairly strong utility for 1-10.
---
Would it be possible to put names under the boss icons in Raids/Dungeons? Otherwise really good work! Thanks man!
---
This. I HIGHLY! recommend starting with a hunter if you're between those two.
---
Warrior is fun when you're doing good e.g. are geared and have a pocket healer. Otherwise it's ass.
---
Hey look at all you can bring to the table.  Impressive.  It’s a discussion sub.  Not imma be a dick to bring you down to my level.  That stuff only works on people like you.  Try harder, use intellect, you might actually offend someone if you bring some logic, I’m just helping you achieve your goal.
---
At some point I know you had to have at least one hit on the mob yourself or you didn't get the loot/xp. Is it not that way in classic?
---
I think the world servers will be fine. That login server though
---
If she was that supportive, she’d make a healer to play with you.
---
Female orc ele shaman pvp focused
---
I don't even know what you're talking about.
---
Will probably play Tauren Feral Druid by myself, Undead Prot Warrior with friends. Looking to really get into tanking for the first time in 10 years
---
How unique!
---
Wait is that Dives? I swore I heard his voice multiple times in that clip.
---
Alliance just have to wait for their allowance ;)
---
I want an RP-PVP server and chose RP, world PVP and dungeons. For RP-PVP enthusiasts RP and world PVP should be the obvious choices. I do think there is enough demand for at least 1 RP-PVP realm and hope we see it on launch day.
---
Okay, superfans.
---
Classic is just filler content to keep people subscribed during content droughts for retail.
---
After that here are some facts you should consider.
---
MORE people played WOW after classic than before.
---
WoW became a pop culture phoneomen.
---
People who never got a chance to play classic are likely going to play classic, not because classic is better, but because they never did.
---
People who did play classic might play classic again. Some won't
---
The reality is classics relaunch success isn't successful because it's classic. It' will be successful because it's WoW.
---
What matters is long term viability after people try it out and get bored.
---
+10000000
---
I don't think there's much logic in that conclusion.  If anything dicks are probably on average better than non dicks.
---
I plan to be an altaholic and will have all my characters cover all professions. I refuse to double gather and will level while skilling up my crafting professions since im a masochist.
---
They will want to get the servers stabilized so they can go home and start leveling up.
---
That's an interesting way to play that I hadn't considered. At most, I will dual box to help my warrior along when my wife can't play with me. That 3rd account is hilarious (in a good way) We're going Horde pvp as well, sure hope we're on the same server so the Alliance scum won't have a chance :)
---
Eh, remember that's gonna get split in ~half by faction. I thought the same thing at first, but 1 in 20ish means about 2 per 40 man raid, so pretty close to where they always were
---
Obviously if blizzard doesn't enforce no gold selling rules there's little benefit to the playerbase to add tokens.  I haven't played retail since wrath and always farmed my own gold, but I was always under the impression they banned sellers frequently,  and buyers usually got a first offense slap on the wrist.
---
Let the slaughter begin.
---
So are videos like the one I'm linking below using incorrect rep values? I'm hoping as a human I can get a cat and wondering how long that will take, is your experience talking about a special cat, or just any of them?

My company has done this to me before. I had 70+ hours of vacation around the month of May. July 1st is the beginning of the new fiscal year. We are only allowed to roll-over 40hours (so I had around 30hours to burn). I was denied various random days to take off so I wouldn’t lose my time... guess who got sick a few days before the end of the fiscal year. Keep in mind I let them know well in advance what days I would take off.
---
My rogue alts are named "imastabu" and "awesomebro"
---
Come at me.
---
Mah name-ah Thex.
---
I don’t really concider camping flightpaths as PvP (like horde camping FP in western plagueland). Searing George and burning steppes will probably be quite bad, but other zones will probably be about the same in phase 2 as in phase 1.
---
However when battlegrounds are introduced, there will be a drop in world PvP.
---
They ban an account if that account advertises gold selling in-game and gets reported, but otherwise do nothing.
---
Hard to believe you have IRL friends with that attitude
---
At 0:53, guy says he's hit for 322071. No idea what number he is in the chain line, but yeesh.  
---
Edit: 1:05, someone says 966213 resisted
---
Hes talking out of his ass. Maybe a tank whos progressing with his guild needs that many consumables, but an ordinary mage may need 100g worth of consumables. Hunters can get away with even less. It depends on the server economy of course.
---
I mean we had the same thing last survey, people had all these really creative ideas about why the poll was different to private servers, and then the beta came out and the class distribution was almost identical to the private servers. Basically the poll is nonsense - either less popular classes are really vocal on forums or people just don't actually play what they say they want to play.  
---
Either way though it's the same, druid/warlock will not be popular in Classic.
---
Could you show me the source of this please? I have been theorycrafting pre BiS gear just today and all I could find on most recent/trustworthy pages was, that with 305 weapon skill you have 8% miss chance. I also dont understand, how can +5 weapon skill gives you 3% hit chance
---
That is ridiculously easy to scam. I would never do that.
---
You inspired my post do an ama now
---
What side projects?
---
Just another sign of the times...
---
Every time I read a post like this I find myself thinking, “I guess there were a lot more cool people around when Vanilla first released.” 
---
People who did stuff like what you described were more of a minority back then.  No big deal. Everyone makes a name for themselves in their own fashion.
---
The secret is to be terrible at something a lot until you aren’t so terrible. You can be kinda ok at something with enough failure, I believe in you!
---
Probably a sound board, like this one https://www.soundboard.com/sb/Rorekil
---
Blizzard isn’t going to ban a level 1 account for it though. And if they do , it just requires a new subscription for a new account. Low risk.
---
Hate? The pointing out of caustic, toxic behavior is not hate. Its a hope you reflect. Or keep being the way you are.
---
Those macros exclusively use the modern API, and multiple people have confirmed they work in the beta client. Old macros would use 'run' or 'if' script commands instead. You just have to be careful because some modern API functions don't work, such as /petmoveto (which I had to be corrected on).
---
To be fair Jousa is a decent name
---
This. Why not go into the wowhead dressing room and make a few to see what looks cooler to you? That’s how I wound up on Troll!
---
I'm honored I'm worth a tag, a screen grab and an upload to imgur in your opinion! A simple down vote would be fine as well though if you disagree with my comment. Or if you want to really go that extra mile you could post your thoughts on the issue. Crazy I know.
---
No I'm a shaman named thex
---
the guy who started it (unknowingly) must be having the biggest e-peen boner of his life. i know i would!
---
Troll for burst threat.
---
If you're going to be gear limited axe spec from Orc is also good. Not to mention PvP benefits.
---
You could go cow, but threat is just so much more important than health especially on Horde side.
---
I'm taking a vacation the whole labor day weekend and I am totally fine with it for this exact reason.
---
Zug zug
---
You won’t kill them unless they’re bad. Blink a cheap shot and they’re fine
---
No changes
---
What you're saying is dumb. As would be a protracted conversation with you.
---
^ That took about as much time as using the snipping tool, imgur and copying and pasting. Are you a Luddite as well, or just bad at comebacks?
---
But you're welcome. You earned it. Have you made a realm and character name choice yet?
---
How foolish of me. I could tell because of the way that you are.
---
If anyone can afford mounts at lvl 40 it is definitely hunters. I have never heard of this before.
---
But you said top guilds, so this is out of my league. thanks for clarifying.
---
Pretty much everyone sucks at miniature painting at first but with some training and tips and tricks to avoid rookie mistakes you can quickly advance your skill. My minis suck compared to others too. You should only compare to yourself :)
---
What is your guild name going to be? Thex?
---
it is rogue specific loot. don't let them discourage you. i never played a rogue and hate them with passion, but everyone arguing locked chests should be shared is a dumb fuck.
---
My man, he meant why would you tell the sub about the date to save names. No one cares about your wife and no one thought you would want to play classic more than hang out with her, but nice flex.
---
I'm Ryan, from Canada, so I guess I'm Ryan...
---
A Dane
---
Wpvp ranking might backfire big time...the 50-59 people will be camped relentlessly
---
I'm not going to explain to you in r/classicwow how percentages work. ~10,000 people voted on their class, and ~1,000 voted druid, regardless of faction. 1 out of 10 players. 10%. If you look at Horde or Alliance, or half the player base, druids will still represent 1 out of every 10 players in that sample size, according to this survey.
---
Did he die today or anything? I really don't understand how this is trending so much right now
---
Arcane shot?
---
No you're RegalisA. I'm Thex and I'm the only one who parties.
---
I have met someone like that. That isn't the point. If it works out for us great. If it doesn't, oh well. I'm just saying I do not believe that outcome to be the majority.
---
Hahahhahahaha thats not your wife u lonely neckbeard. Cringe alert
---
Only the talent trees and ability to be a Horde Paladin from TBC, nothing else
---
It would be really hard to do this while leveling because not that much gear has +spell damage/healing at lower levels and the stuff that does is usually cloth, not mail or plate. While leveling you’re better off with more straightforward strength gear. But I have seen some theorycrafting and one or two video examples of a spell damage paladin at 60. Paladin T2 raid gear is actually a nice set for this. The talent spec involves at least 20-21 points in holy (5/5 illumination, +/- divine favor is too good to pass up) but the rest can go into ret if you want. Try looking up “shockadin” or “spelladin,” one of the best examples I think was Theloras.
---
Did you even play classic? Lol
---
If you really want to min/max then troll is the best for the extra threat that you get by popping berzerking.
---
UD is also decent since you dont have fearward as horde and tremor/stancedancing is not always reliable.
---
Tauren's extra hp is nice, but hardly makes any difference, though warstomp can help with trash pulls.
---
Orc's axe spec can be the best racial if you're using an axe, but most tanking weapons will be swords or maces.
---
When they’re sitting it’s a guaranteed Crit. Mages are especially weak to openers too, and even more so while leveling. Also, Druid here so they just can’t really run too well
---
Wait how do you reserve names before the release date? Sorry if this is a stupid question
---
https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table#miss
---
Beta testing results is the best we have.
---
We have always known that points of weapon skill reduce your chance to miss the boss, which is the same thing as increasing your chance to hit the boss. We just didn't know exactly how the formula works. Now blizzard telling us the extra 1% hit gained from having 10 or more, makes it more clear.
---
‘Teach then how to farm and you’ll be golden’
---
I see what you did there
---
That name spread like wild fire on the sub xD gz your name is now a meme
---
I was gonna try to steal Asmongold´s name, but honestly, it´d be really cool to get Thex now that it´s talked about so much
---
It's not even that bad. Most people are just honestly suggesting a character. You can tell people are getting desperate for classic
---
Hunter vs paladin duels can literally go on forever assuming neither side has engineering. It's one of the stupidest matchups in the game.
---
Yes, and no. You will be spamming shadow bolt BUT vanilla is also about managing your threat, positioning yourself, and warlocks are a high utility class - you'll be expected to banish. 
---
Also, not that this is something 90% of players, probably me too, will get to experience - in Naxx shadow ward or whatever is an insanely good shadow caster repellant. Iirc you need at least 3 warlocks for 4 horseman to spam cast this.
---
Did either of you play vanilla? Because those Chinese farmers or bots camping your favorite spot 24/7 was really annoying. One major downside to rolling on a pve server: no way to corpsecamp the bots. :(
---
Bad shaman, bad shaman, whatcha gona do, whatcha gona do as enhancement too, bad shaman              
---
                
---
*Due to the low nature damage of this class, viewer discretion is advised
---
That sounds hella tight, I'm thinking of doing a stormcast army to represent the Stormwind Humans, I would love to see your army and another Warcraft theme army play against each other.
---
and nothing changes, you still don't get the chest.
---
Noted!
---
In B4 Thex!
---
That's what I'm really afraid of.
---
If it gets anywhere near as bad as it does on pservers, people will quit in droves during P2.
---
Hmm. Maybe I'll give it a try again someday.
---
Yeah I’m not expecting to be the best tank ever just want to do some while leveling and maybe some 5 mans at higher levels. My main was a mage so at least I’ve got some experience with mana management. Any particular reason why Zf Mara and ST were harder?
---
They are honestly all pretty good on their own but troll is superior.
---
😆 haha
---
Go warrior if all you want to do is offtank and dps (but good dps). Druids make for good offtanks but their dps in raids is poor in comparison to dps. If you're interested in versatility, go druid. If it's literally to dps in raids and offtank when needed go warrior.
---
Rag will die easily in about a week.  A large portion of the guilds will one shot bwl and aq40 the first night it opens.  Naxx will see a lot more kt  kills than in retail vanilla...
---
This is a fact, sorry bud
---
Atheist gluten intolerant vegan horde players who just started crossfit with their chihuahua service dog while being an ironman that vapes while drinking smartwater
---
I will name my bank alt Lazlo in honor of the quintessential Italo track...
---
I understand that, but there is a lack of content after the first year. That is why private servers begin to die once AQ is released.
---
I get the benefit of not having to roll against rogues for my gear.
---
It’s 0618 hours in Australia right now and that was still too much and I’m 40.
---
There are entire guilds trying to plan things out right now too
---
Respecing is a privilege not a right
---
Right, so let's change everything then...
---
Because they're faction-specific, they're going to be overrepresented on their factions. So 8% of the entire playerbase will be Shaman according to this, but because they'll all be Horde they'll represent 16% of the Horde. 8% would be 3 per 40 man raid, but because they're all Horde it's more like 6 per raid.
---
I don't, but you can imagine it. All of my abilities fit in the default 12 key action bar, and I don't use any visible floating action bars. I've rebound the 9, 0, -, + keys to Q, E, R, F. When I strum alt, shift, and ctrl all my icons flash like a strobe light. 
---
Any really non-essential macros, such as chat macros, gear swaps, item uses, or raid callouts are hidden on my second bar. If you remap the keybindings, you can activate the bar even if it isn't visible. This way, I can use my mouse buttons to mark targets and give callouts.
---
There was a guy on Runetotem-US named Aracka. He literally just sat in trade and shit talked everyone. Super troll. But he was awesome. I loved watching people fight with him. It really turned into a spectator sport. I feel like he became a server celeb. At least to our guild.
---
I didn't get invited but I have it downloaded already so that must not be it.
---
so these Starbucks baristas must be making a fortune with those 900 dollar wages
---
Where's the source from this research because there are posts daily on this very subject and so far there's no official word of this.
---
So don't be offended if people think you're pulling that out if your ass.
---
Idk, the idea of a rogue taking all of the locked box loot leaves the same bad taste in my mouth as a Mage charging for water during a dungeon run, a Warlock charging for summons to the dungeon entrance, or a Druid charging for Rebirth cooldowns. 
---
Out of a group, sure; pay up for class services. When running a dungeon I'd expect a rogue's utility to benefit the whole group, not just themselves.
---
Kyni, oops, I misspelled Thex.
---
^(Edit:  Kyni; definition, kinda tiny.  Must... be... a gnome.)
---
Mike Tyson is that you??
---
Been passionate about tanking since TBC (mostly pally) and want to tank again in Classic. Rolling warrior for obvious reasons but not sure if I'm up for it time-wise. I'm torn between Mage and Prot War.
---
I keep hearing horror stories about how hard it's to level a prot warrior. Is leveling really that bad? Lastly, while it's kinda hard to tell right now, how in demand tanks will be in raids? I imagine it won't be easy to get a permanent spot in a guild even as an OT. Tanking is my preference, hands down, but I wonder if Mage would be a smarter choice.
---
Appreciate it!
---
Damn, why am I not playing Classic now?!
---
Yeth
---
Ah, I see. Retail gold to buy tokens, which gets you sub time, which will let you play Classic. Carry on! ;)
---
Exactly... people complaining about the subscription price would be like joining a gym, then complaining about having to pay the full membership fee because they only use the treadmill.
---
The guilds thatbraid mythic will still raid mythic - good luck to the rest.
---
Troll is bis. But UD is also nice since you don’t have to change stances as much.
---
Never called you a dick, so thanks for that. Just saying that people who have any sort of elitist attitude over a dungeon like VoA are typically the types of people you see buying cutting edge right before it goes away.
---
LOL yes! L2P was around for a while; my license plate back in the day said L2DRIVE, playing off of that.
---
Also should be noted that it's a staggered system. He referenced the min/max rank you can get in the months.
---
It should also be noted that you can only go up X amount of ranks per week early on. 
---
I can find the exact numbers but it's like 1-4, 4-7 and so on.
---
From Wiki's:
---
Note though, that there is a rank promotion limit, which is due to the fact that you simply cannot earn more than a certain amount total rank each week, plus your total rank decays by 20% each week. A rank 0 (pre-private) can earn at most 13000 RP, which would put him in the middle of rank 4. A rank 5 (with the minimum 15000 RP) can also earn 13000 RP but will lose 3000 RP to decay, so his new rank will be barely 7 (25000 RP).
---
So early on; it may be good to do the required grinding of RP's, but not go crazy. I'd be surprised if there are enough people to not allow the general population to do rank 1-4 the first week at least. Past that who knows.
---
This was actually during beta, and due to his video and the subsequent nerf Bloodthirst was pretty awful for raiding until the warrior talent revamp.
---
Glad I'm not alone with this
---
AHAHAHAHAHHAHA
---
I’m from Lightning’s Blade. We’ve been growing a guild and are trying to get what’s left of demon hunters, sigil, etc in here. We’ve found ming, zya, and a bunch more but have yet to find Aedak 
---
Edit: oh hi quad :D trinzik here
---
Ootl, what is thex?
---
That's about as ordinary as it gets
---
Sure it would.  The inputs during training are matching BFA/vanilla pairs of the 8 races with pose and appearance customization varied.  Then in inference the generator ingests a BFA character and outputs its estimate of the vanilla version.  At inference there's no restriction that the BFA character has to be from the training races.
---
Re is the start of my name and Finland is my favorite country so I got Thex
---
rogues are good dps with nice cc?
---
If anyone can contact him, we’re forming a guild with old Lightning’s Blade players and would love to have him on our classic server.
---
Turtles too
---
So are mages, and to some extent warlocks.
---
What realm bro?  All of them
---
Thex is love Thex is life
---
My name turned out lame...
---
I love Barrens chat and my favorite type of jokes are Chuck Norris jokes. He is also without a doubt the greatest actor of all time. I want to name my Shaman after  the best TV-show ever made, Walker Thexas Ranger. That name is too long, so I'll just be Thex
---
In before Thex!
---
Oh trust me I know how it is.
---
I've had the "pleasure" of playing on one of the pservers during pre-BG honor patch.
---
Even as a rogue, it was impossible to do anything out in the world, and it was one of the smaller pop servers too.
---
Can't wait to see how blizzard will handle P2 outcry
---
Talking to you is a chore.  Bye
---
I'm out of the loop, whats thex?
---
My name is X, and I'm pretty unique so you can call me "The X"
---
&gt; I’m just helping you achieve your goal
---
My discussion point is that OP's suggestion is poorly thought out and appeals to the lowest common denominator and overall detracts value from the game.
---
But since you feel clever by wordshopping a pedantic response let me show you a faster method.
---
&gt;Deal with it.
---
Ekki málið að velja einhvern íslendinga server bara... hefuru séð einhversstaðar fólk vera að ræða það?
---
Those discussions also suck.
---
Maybe I just don't like the reddit Classic WoW community lol
---
Im Guiseppe from France but friends call me Thex
---
And that priiledge will increase as it should.
---
You want to respect constantly? Put in the effort to afford such a luxury.
---
I see no issue with the vanilla system.
---
&gt; Oh please, spare me. Trickle down is proven not to work.
---
Well look 'e here boys, we got us one of them Zenjin village socialists just runnin in from Duratar tryin to live off Orgimmars coppers, bet you this dirty tusk face thinks we should all just support their little potion habits! Nothing makes me sicker than when hard workin Orcs cant put Deviate Delights on the table for our families but the Warchief aint got no problem handin out "Staff of Orgimmar" to these people!
---
It's there (UK), I downloaded it 2 nights ago.
---
Dont you mean Guild Thexes?
---
No. That’s what raid BoEs and unused materials are for. To fund guild sponsored consumables and resist gear.
---
/r/outoftheloop
---
Ymmv but I heard that the pickpocketing loot on the beta was like 1/4 as valuable as it was on private servers
---
Thex is a cool name I think i'll name my shaman that. Thanks!
---
Hell yeah I do.
---
Quality oldschool wow content.
---
This is sub is that desperate for any kind of entertainment while they wait for Classic to launch.
---
My ex laughed good naturedly about gaming/football, and i laughed good naturedly about the bachelorette/gray's anatomy. No one ever got offended, there were never any issues about that. So yeah, maybe OP's wife would let him laugh about it in a text.
---
Goddamit 
---
I got MoonMoon
---
Second this
---
Yesterday someone asked what our names would be on classic and said they where creating a troll shaman called Thex, so now it became a meme and tons of people are saying they are gonna name their characters Thex and create a Thex on every server
---
I honestly have to agree, eastern plaguelands does definitely have an advantage in leveling compared to all other classes
---
100% legal in America. Though I'm surprised the OP has so much PTO saved; my current Job has a "you get X PTO per year and must use it all by Y date or lose it" policy.
---
It's also not paid out if you quit, so everyone takes Z number of days off before they leave the company.
---
I share your anxiety for the most part.
---
I assume Blizz will impliment fresh classic servers in response.. and I don't kbow how I feel about it  .
---
It definitely does not.. I did both and timed them.
---
Awesome, nice work!
---
Ask me what?
---
SM/Ruin is a viable endgame spec that works for both PvE and PvP that does not require you to sacrifice your pet.
---
You are on point, mages do not have significant downsides. Water conjuring as a downside is a meme, it's literally the lowest effort raid prep.
---
You can argue about simple pve rotation, but its pretty much the same for most classes. And with fire spec, it gets more interesting.
---
One thing to note, if you want optimal pve and pvp spec, you need to respect both as frost and fire. In contrast, hunter and warlock are more likely to get away with their specs in both pve and pvp.
---
But there is one more thing: preference. I fully understand that mages have no significant downsides, but I simple do not like the mage gameplay. Despite everything, I cba to main a mage thats for sure. I envy the people who enjoy playing mage but I cant do it myself.
---
Why the hell is he in a Japanese co mono lol its awesome. Think i might get me one to play in too
---
That's too bad mate.
---
God damnit I hated this forced shit meme so 🥺
---
Wow, some thexy names you've all got there. Please tag for nsfw
---
In b4 LoW EfFurt
---
Found the boomkin.
---
You are correct.
---
Believe it or not this is the second time I've become a meme.
---
They said it was postponed indefinitely. At this point I'd be a little surprised they end up having it.
---
I'm in a mythic CE guild and zero people from our team are switching to classic, but many are going to try it out.  Its kind of cute when they talk about how long itll take them to hit 60, most think they can do it in a week or two of casual playing.  My guess is most will quit before lvl40 when it gets tough. The only people I know who're switching to classic full time have already quit BFA for one reason or another.
---
Tank, shaman, mage, then whatever.
---
Those video guides all rely on rep values from private servers or TBC or later expansions. Classic rep values are much lower.
---
&gt; R14 is achievable in phase 2.
---
also isnt productive , it takes a minimum of 12 weeks to hit r14 and we have no information on how long blizz plans on having phase 2 last for
---
Damn, 12 days? I had no idea. It's not like this sub is constantly being updated with people creating posts identical to this one.
---
After grinding through 4 pserver launch days I have 100% faith Classic will crash relentlessly. 
---
It's the pain that I like about Classic though
---
Yes I will be a Shaman named Thex.
---
you aren't raiding so why do you care about raiding roles? 
---
all four are fun. warlock is the most idiot proof, warrior probably the most difficult, shaman the most balanced. mage is very fun in all aspects, too. since your focus sounds like PVP, just decide if you want to be made of paper (mage), be in the thick of things (shaman/warrior), or something in between (warlock)
---
ignore the absurd idea below that if you are playing casually, you should play a mage. leveling is easy with all classes and will take a long time no matter what
---
It's definitely not as big a deal as warrior. It's going depend on exact gear/spec/fight but the ballpark seems to be 2-3% for a rogue, and 6-7% for a warrior.  
---
 
---
If you like the idea of playing a dagger rogue going nelf/gnome can be good because all the humans will fight with the warriors for swords but pass you the nice daggers.
---
No fun till p4 unfortunately:(
---
I think I can almost guarantee it, I'm buying sub just to try and get it myself
---
There will be so many people leveling these first few months that it's probably an IDEAL time to level a warrior because there will always be people around to group up with for quests or dungeons I think.  For raiding, unless you have serious time available you're unlikely to get a MT spot but you can always go DPS/OT and find a spot pretty easy I would guess.  You can also level and tank 5 mans fine as fury and just got prot when you hit 58-60 and are just grinding dungeons at that point.
---
I mained mage in the olden days. Took a lot for me to commit to a different class because the fantasy and design was soo on point even up to Wrath.
---
Downsides are competing for cloth gear, being a suuuper squishy glass cannon, and stopping to drink frequently.  Another side to this is you WONT always be invited to 5mans because there is probably a warlock or likely another mage who wont want to compete with you for gear. Id be like LF hunter &amp;rogue lol. 
---
If you do not want to play a mage don't play it just because they are megatier everything.  
---
Topping the meters is cool and all but that is not the game. "Play what you want" is a common response because it is the truth. If you want to be a druid because they are a swiss army knife then do it, so what if you get out dps'd.  The tryhards on here running for prebis in 2 weeks are a tiny tiny percent of the community. If everyone was a warrior mage and priest the game would suck. Playing a "lower tier" class doesnt mean the game is no longer viable.  You can play well and do well and have fun as anything even a meme spec.  You might not get invited to the tryhard guild but if you have a life you wont anyway.
---
It is MORE impressive to play smart and perform well as a sub tier than to spam frostbolt and top Recount imo.
---
You can easily heal every leveling dungeon 1-60 as a shadow priest.
---
Well half of that long time, or more, was due to him being unbeatable was it not? I remember my guild was on C'thun for several weeks practicing him and learning the phases and positioning (we had a problem with a lot of people gaming while eating/studying/hw/talking to whoever and sucking at quick responses and positioning). After the hot fix on a tuesday which made him killable, we got him 2 days later on Thurs (I think). Killed him 2 or 3 more times for a warrior to get his Dark Edge, before we decided that the clear to him was not worth it and focused primarily on Naxx. Also, fuck the 4 horsemen.
---
Unless you’re already in a guild, and have dozens of others planning to rush 60 with you.... which I am. There will be no waiting around for the casuals with kids - those people will hit 60 together and do raids together also, just later. There will be plenty of people hitting 60 at all different times.
---
I laughed because you’re actually the OG Thex.
---
Charge was always the selling point for warriors imo. Leap is cool too
---
Eyo. Did you get my PM ?
---
At least on horde side there's some debate.  My god the amount of people on this sub who just lose their shit if anyone suggests rolling any non-human warrior on the alliance side.
---
You don't have to have BFA, just an active subscription. I don't intend on purchasing BFA.
---
What are you getting in return for this tax? I instantly assume fuck all
---
It's still going to be hard work getting mount at 40 without planning. Joana had like 30g or something when he hit 40 on a beta speed run I think? The reason people were so rich in beta was because as soon as they hit 30 or 40 they'd just do more quests and the xp was converted into gold, so there was very high inflation at the cap.
---
Aszune, EU?
---
On the beta? Lots of people.
---
So I think our major point of contention would be around #1 (maybe your opinion in #4 that retail will have more subs than Classic, but that’s sort of the wider context for the conversation). 
---
I think it’s possible that the reason why games like fortnite and league of legends and DotA do so well is because of the noticeable absence of a satisfying, highly sticky, and rewarding (in terms of time put vs what you get out of it) mmo on the market. I mean when you drill down, the mmo market was dominated by the so-called “trilogy” of WoW: the three versions of WoW that most closely adhered to that Classic design vision. With the fall of WoW, some of that market may have gone to other notable MMOs, but none are quite the same as Vanilla WoW in their design or delivery. So players such as myself have to go to other games. I remember in Cata many of me and my friends from WoW playing League of Legends and Minecraft. I think League is a magnificent game, but I think some of its popularity may be tied to the decline of WoW. But the void in the space of games that delivers on the social and gameplay aspects simultaneously left by WoW is huge.
---
Also, WoW’s, and many other modern mmo design, has become more and more action oriented. They have incorporated systems and designs from diablo, and have put more and more instancing in, making it more like those great lobby games. Unfortunately games designed with bite-sized engagement in mind are going to be more engaging in bite-sizes, so WoW has trouble competing on that front. 
---
Personally, I experience a sort of empty feeling when I play too much of those types of games. They’re fun for a bit, then a hit a spot where I would have to dedicate a ton of time to improving my tactics and knowledge of the game to progress in ranks at all, not to mention a ton of time. That’s when I go and try to play WoW, and am left with the same empty feeling after not too long.
---
Deeprun Tram rave parties. Make it happen.
---
It'll be fine - people are vastly overestimating classic and I'm not being sarcastic - sure it's going to be popular and have tons of players during the first week but the servers won't crash on names res due to # of people
---
Idk if anyone remembers but the last stress test had like 10 servers available and they had to shut them down to get everyone onto 2 servers... sure it was odd hours when they opened, but there isn't a "new" surge to the game.
---
Damn, you remind me that I've got so many old games to play that I've never played. I have actually never played any of the Elder Scrolls games. Have you played any of the ES games with graphical enhancing mods? And if so, do you know if any good ones? And neither have I played Diablo, nor any of the Legend of Zelda games. They have been on my list for a long time, and was meaning to have done them by now, but with Classic coming, I'll be preoccupied for a couple of years again. :)
---
And with music I too am definitely very conservative. I still listen to old EDM stuff from Tiësto (his old stuff is much better), Armin van Buuren (same for him as well), The Crystal Method, The Prodigy and what have you. Also my metal and metal derivatives library is mostly stuff that was popular during Vanilla and TBC (Disharmonia Mundi, Marilyn Manson, Pain, Linkin Park, Distubed, Godsmack, Soil, Soilwork, Rammstein etc). And film &amp; game score albums is what I listen to the most throughout the day (WoW's OST, LotR, PotC, The Dark Knight, Tron Legacy, Game of Thrones, The Matrix, etc).
---
In trying my best to not sound like a hipster, I have to say that almost all new music just doesn't excite and invoke. And I too have the same problem discovering good pieces late. That's due to a decrease in signal-to-noise, as artists are frankly running out of ideas, piracy has dissuaded a lot of actual talent, and with all the advanced software, songs are partially automatically generated. Not to mention that sampling and autotune have been huge contributors to the signal-to-noise decrease. Yikes, I'm already starting to sound like an old fart with 'kids these days'-esque whinging, but I really think that creativity and good ideas the music scene have overall dropped.
---
Maybe I was a bit emo exaggerating about not wanting to play old games, as there are still some classics I'd like to give another spin. GTA Vice City is a classic I'd still enjoy for example, Wacraft 3/TFT (kinda had hoped that Blizzard would've released it before Classic), Age of Empires 1 and 2, Need For Speed Underground 1 and 2.
---
If you're a rogue/can open locked chests. And none have asked you to open it. It's yours to keep, They're just salty, dismiss them and go on with your life
---
I'm also someone who entierly ignores when people roll on chests. i open it and tell party whats in it, whoever wants it or can use it will get it.
---
I did! Sorry, been having stuff going on in the evenings, I'll show up eventually, lol
---
I've seen this vid before it seems like a repost of a video. Is this really your guild?
---
Sure do, sure have.
---
I've been model editing since vanilla and never even received a warning
---
I wasn’t even going to play shaman but now I will be playing a shaman named Thex.
---
He said he wouldn’t care and just pick another name. 
---
...but inside he might be broken.
---
I missed the bit about the beta because reading is hard.
---
But just to still be difficult... a beta name isnt such a big deal is it? Like all the characters get deleted before the live game
---
I love to make other people better. What class suits someone who really wants to just buff his teammates up and make them do what they do the best?
---
Poggers
---
You are going to get destroyed by almost every hunter no matter their skill level, unless you are very very good.
---
Seriously. These posts can’t be moderated heavily enough.
---
Lmao I'm not sharing my herbs unless there's another herbalist in the group. Rogues shouldn't share their locked chests unless there's another rogue (or nutjob blacksmith willing to waste a key) in the group.  
---
    
---
It really is that simple.
---
Very true. Those two things are also a shit game designs that have been introduced.
---
That's why you open garrotte.
---
Thin your paints
---
... jk looks real gud. Especoally your base.
---
I’m really torn between Paladin and Priest, I want to play dwarf for either so fear ward is an easy way to get into raids. But the thought of a plate caster is really cool to me as well. My biggest worry with Paladin is how bad the item optimizing is, and finding good plate gear. Whereas priest all cloth has int essentially and benediction is pretty sweet. My biggest question is if I play Paladin will I pretty much just be running around in cloth 24/7? Even for pvp?
---
If they don’t do it on WoW classic then I hope they do another reboot where they bring all the old content back.
---
The fact that you have no downranked heals on your action bars :)
---
I mean, I feel that as well, but I also attributed to the fact that it was 2005 and even something as simple as talking to other people online was fantastic and new and exciting, and the idea of being able to do it in a game while playing with other people? Yeah there were a whole lot of things that came together to form that feeling.
---
if you think about main tanking raids, roll troll because you'll have a chance to roll thunderfury, if not you'll be better as an orc because of the axe's racial
---
ench sham vs ditto. just a dice roll
---
Blizzard already said they might.
---
The kill took 20 fucking minutes? Damn, that's intense
---
Maybe if the stress test happens.
---
Any reasons that exist in your head that you are not telling us that you think would be good reasons to play certain other classes. So you can roll them as an alt, but we know that playing the main first always means every alt experienced after is diluted to a certain point
---
Think this is a pretty obvious answer to this question. If it does well and retains players then obviously they would consider it. If it tanks then no I don’t think they would bother.
---
Barrens chat owes me at least 10 IQ points. Can't wait to give it 10 more!
---
I wont be posting this cringy stuff. My wifes boyfriend told me its no big deal if i want to play wow.
---
People are going to think youre an idiot if you skip Rebirth, Abolish Poison and Challenging Roar... GL with that my poor Druid friend.
---
Ah, back when Sylvannas was just trying to be a leader to her people and help them survive in a world that has turned their back on them and just wanted revenge on Arthas instead of the warmongering "destroy the living" bitch she is now.
---
Microsoft been arresting people since 1980.  The poor individuals labor day after day in blacksites data mining.
---
No one ever sees them again.
---
I wanna Thex you up!
---
How do you know if someone is a pacifist? Don't worry they will tell you.
---
for most players yeah, im talking about people speed leveling as a guild though. no one will have any professions other than first aid and the hunter needs mount the second they hit 40 to keep the lead
---
Straight Thexin'
---
Awesome! Thanks!
---
Nice CC is a stretch. With improved Sap its still only ok.
---
In the one where the MS (not to mention deep wounds) pushes of debuffs you want.
---
Kinda like a vegan lol, but really I'm just a coward that sucks at pvp, but pacifist sounds better lol
---
I love this. This man socialisms
---
Praying server names are released early to organize with peeps
---
Jousa kinda sounds like you’re marketing a blender...
---
My name would be Saco, btw.  So yeah, we’ll go with Thex!
---
&gt;Have you ever been in a relationship?
---
Hahahahahahaha
---
BFA lore outside of the whole Sylvannas thing is actually pretty good, though. They went back to their roots a little bit in that regard. The player character is still an OP "the one" kind of hero but they at least went back to "older lore" with Zandalar and Kul tiras and old gods and Azshara.
---
Or just go SL, you'll be immortal.
---
There was this guy leveling to, i believe 60, with only herbing iirc
---
Sort of contradicts your earlier claim of a secondary account being useful for farming linen cloth for the wand market doesn't it? My guild will be c.o.d. wands to clothies in general chat before you get on your first flight or boat. Not trying to brag because that's not me. I'm just a pleb trading cloth to our tailor and skins to our LW.
---
Blacksmiths can craft skeleton keys to open locked boxes and chests.
---
I think they will have to at some point, even if it's very far down the line. No matter how much everyone loves the game, if you run out of things to do it becomes boring and people will stop playing as much, or quit entirely.
---
True
---
I’m rolling a Druid on horde side. So all set there but debating my profession. Thinking enchanting and x, or maybe just alch and herb. Anyone have any advice ? I plan on tanking and moving into healing later and some pvp. Thx in advance
---
Oh hey  I didnt know we found ming
---
Did you have downranked heals on your action bars at level 13? In 2005?
---
undead starting area is dope too
---
Sit in bear form and kite \*them\* while you kill their pet and LoS the Hunter when possible. If they are smart, then they will call back their pet and neither of you will die. If they're bad and keep chasing you, then you kill their pet first, heal up, and eventually kill them. No opener necessary.
---
Can't do anything about that Hunter's Mark though. Just gotta wait it out.
---
Thanks I did that, but what is the account name that we use for logging in to Wow Classic?  Is it our battle net credentials (email/password)?
---
A level 13 in 2005 with actual good keybinds. I’m flabbergasted.
---
makes sense but idk maybe they'll track it it's just a fun number to brag about that's all.
---
That’s what my thought process is. It’s also my dream to play WoW in Cata again because it’s when I REALLY started and in my opinion it’s one of the best Xpacks.
---
Well fuck
---
It won’t be included. It wasn’t in the beta either.
---
For pugs yes. I mean they need 40 people... Theyre not all going to be geared bis and meta spec for a raid. Then as a bonus if you have a few gearsets you can be flexible and heal or off tank or ranged/melee dps depending on your spec at the time, which has its own value. Being able to spot heal in a clutch moment or morph to bear to save a healer when the warrior loses threat literally could save the raid. You could be that guy. You wont appear on the meter but you will be remembered.  (Just going with druid example there are analogous moments to every class)
---
The game is soo big, to focus on one aspect (raiding) to determine what could become months/years of your life.. Meh. If that is your only goal with the game to top charts in raids then yeah be a mage and hope you are one of the 8 mages who get ignite off. Lol.
---
But you will be doing a TON of other content and if youre not feeling it because youre not super into your character youll prolly end up rerolling anyway.
---
Locked into one roll. Can’t tank, can’t heal, can’t melee DPS. 
---
Honestly mage is super strong. If I wasn’t tanking for my guild as a Warrior, Mage would probably be my main.
---
It’s about having the gear. They all require “flags” or keys of sorts. MC you need to in through BRD. BWL has a small quest chain. Ony requires key, etc
---
Bro, the Horde was founded on principles of equality and acceptance.  We were the rag-tag, the outcast, the refugees.  The Orcs separated from their homeworld and enslaved by the humans, the Darkspear a mere shadow of what they used to be, the Tauren struggling to survive in a harsh world, and the Forsaken accepted by literally no one.  Thrall's Horde is a glorious melting pot of diversity, and for you to turn your back on that heritage is the most un-Horde-like behavior I can imagine.
---
Frostmane low key best realm
---
RIP the one true Thex, your sacrifice will be remembered everytime I get laugh out of this
---
Pretty similar to every other online poll I've seen. Horde outnumbers alliance, and most pvp focused players will be horde, so horde will have longer queues. Warrior is most played on each side, followed by shaman for horde, followed by mage.
---
Every poll I see is pretty much exactly this.
---
I tried this with 4 different names and locations, all Thex...
---
Well, mage is the premium class of vanilla. If this were a mobile game, it's the class that would cost $199 to unlock. Traditionally, the downside has been that there were a lot of mages (consistently the second most played class behind warrior) and a *lot* of competition for gear, but recent surveys haven't indicated that there will be that many mages in Classic. I'm not sure how much one can read into surveys, though.
---
I still don’t understand the point of a day for reserving names before launch. It’s open to the public so how would this allow you to reserve a name that you couldn’t at launch?
---
Those dungeons take longer so more time is spent drinking.  ZF is where mobs hit harder and players have decent gear, and lack of a quick taunt becomes more noticeable.  ZF has the stairway fight where mana can be an issue.  Its totally doable though as a pally.  Healer mana pools become noticeable.  ST mobs hit really hard for that level.  But i guess it just takes longer and requires more attention to the fights from all members, and groups have a higher chance to wipe and people will attribute it to the offspec.
---
I remeber a gnome rogue named Jang on Spinebreaker that was quite famous on the server for trolling in game and in the forums. He was pretty funny
---
Lol hahah ya it's gonna go away pretty quick. Quickly enjoy while we can!
---
It just seems like you are making it a much bigger deal then it is. Which also makes everyone assume you have a lot of pent up sexual frustration.. which wouldn’t surprise me cause look where we are.
---
Its better to just drop it - people go off-topic occasionally in literally every sub and obviously this post is a familiar feeling / similar situation for many.
---
My dad has a server? Give me the ip!
---
I hope to get the name of my first char - when I took it there wasn’t another in the world. Now there’s close to 50. Hopefully I’ll get it.
---
Man, 2024 is gonna be the year of the Custom Server.
---
i haven't done enough prep in running a multi-box setup. The amount of time between now and classic i won't get enough muscle memory / know-how with multiboxing to be effective for the launch. 
---
i've hit 60 5 times in vanilla (twice back in 05-06) and 3 times on pservers since. i know how to hit 60 via horde with my eyes closed with a close to perfect rouge (always getting refined), things like pure optimal hearthing/how to complete class quests effectively / when to abandon a quest
---
i just forsee too many headaches with multi boxing. i'm content hitting 60 in a week and using multiple accounts for info/time advantages while i'm on one account (no logging off required)
---
I plan on bear tanking. 
---
Half the people think it's a meme the other half think its viable.
---
I dont care what people think. I love being a druid. And I love tanking. I dont need to fancy shield to block or sword to parry. I'll face tank shit and I'll do fine.
---
I wont be able to be MT for certain raids or bosses. But I plan on nolifing the first week. And druids are less gear dependent to tank. So I'm hoping to tank MC while we get our MT prot warrior geared.
---
And whenever the mobs dont require a prot warrior, he wont be able to pull threat off of me. He will tank when I let him tank. Kappa
---
I'm also okay eventually being the off tank or off healer. 
---
Dont think I want to main heal again. But maybe a balance spec where I can innervate and heal as a support but deal damage when we dont need a healer.
---
This way I'm valuable to a raid as I provide utility. I deal damage when we need it. Heal when we need it. Tank when we need it.
---
Plus I have a battle rez for when the prot warrior isnt as good as me ;)
---
Obviously that sentence did it's job perfectely looking at your comment. It's to deter little snowflakes like yourself &lt;3 Im sure there is a carebear guild for you somewhere, best of luck with the soy!
---
We need more Thex license plates.
---
August 8th
---
Most classes have a leveling, PvP and PvE spec. Why signal out shamans?
---
Priests take wand spec when levelling, Mages go fire after AQ40 etc etc.
---
Aside from the weird decision to limit the description to one class, yes it is good design. Different specs should flourish in different areas and in different circumstances.
---
There was a problem with specs in classic, some talents were so good that they weren't even a choice. Cruelty in warrior is a good example. It's so good that basically every spec takes it. It's a first teir 5% crit.
---
Blizzard acknowledged this with talents and they accounced way back then that they were going to change talent trees to be **more** situational and **less** critical and invariable. The problem was the way they went about this was insanely lazy. Rather than make all the talents interesting and circumstantial they instead just opted to reduce the amount of talents you have at all and eventually reduce it even further to only augment existing abilities.
---
not on a mage lmao
---
not bad , didnt know about that macro
---
Hmm. Chronicles 1 probably.
---
It will be tough if they don't, you will hit a certain point there is nothing left to do or to progress, now that might take years but still.
---
I know there are people on private servers that have been playing classic non stop and that's great! Same thing will happen in classic. 
---
Problem is they will be so geared everything under nax or aq40 will be a waste of time for them you will have this clique of super geared players. 
---
But most people will just stop after doing mc for the 1000th time cause they cant progress further in bwl.
---
And then they find out besides raids there's not much to do, sure you can do scholomance for the 1572 time or make another alt or try to go for rank 14 in pvp but most will just get bored and quit. 
---
You will need a steady stream of new players to fill in the gaps (endless cycle of gearing new members) and so it continues. 
---
All this said though unless xpacs are made with the same philosphy as vanilla/classic so for example still lvl 60
---
new gear are side grades
---
even better IMHO they drop rare enchants or recipes. 
---
Titles. 
---
even dance or emoji animations I know I know it's stupid but it's better then making gear obsolete that took you months to build up to. 
---
I would prefer for it to stay as it is. 
---
My advise would be though, enjoy the ride. 
---
We will be burn that bridge once we get there.

I'm trying to get it...but I dont...

Zug fucking zug! So excited for Thrall's OG Horde.
---
Bandages, dood
---
I think their progression will look something like this:
---
Burning Thex
---
Wrath of the Thex King
---
Cathexism
---
Mists of Thexdaria
---
Warlords of Thexnor
---
Thexgion
---
Battle for Thexzeroth

Just my 2c though

Bandaid build!
---
Praying that the streamers announce which servers they are rolling on ahead of time too. Not hating, I just don't want to deal with all that.
---
you still need darnassus exalted to ride the winterspring frostsaber as a non-elf
---
So, I’m hella out of the loop here, but what the fuck is up with Thex?
---
I am sure I will get sick of watching that at some stage. 
---
Maybe.
---
Nah... probably not. \*giggle\*
---
Priests will be the second highest played class?  :O
---
You didn't understand and i did explain, you just went "UHHH I DONT GET IT CAUSE I CAN"T READ WORDSSS HURRR DURRR" You just simply can't comprehend what you read.
---
That's what we're all naming our character.
---
1. Rise of the Horde (~70 years before WoW Classic)
---
2. The Last Guardian (~25 years before WoW Classic)
---
3. Tides of Darkness (~22 years before WoW Classic)
---
4. Beyond the Dark Portal (~17 years before WoW Classic)
---
5. Lord of the Clans (~7 years before WoW Classic)
---
6. Of Blood and Honor (~6 years before WoW Classic)
---
7. Arthas: Rise of the Lich King (~3 years before WoW Classic)
---
8. Cycle of Hatred (~1 year before WoW Classic)
---
I purposefully left out anything by Richard A. Knaak, especially the War of the Ancients trilogy.
---
Launch date is monday afternoon for me, perfect time to grind all night after a long days work.
---
What part of "mistaken" are you not understanding?
---
I made a mistake. Holy hell.
---
Edit: And now I have to block you, because apparently people like you enjoy hammering people even after they admit to something.  
---
You know what, screw this sub as a whole actually.
---
Any particular reason why?
---
A guy made a thread excited about hearing all the names we may choose and told us what he was planning on doing; a troll shaman named thex.  Many people replied they were going to be Thex.  Now everyone is going to use that name across every realm.
---
My wife found this post hilarious too. I wonder what other people's wives think about this.
---
You don't have to do it immediately. You can play just normally and then mobtag your characters to 60 on your rogue. A bit unfortunate that it's a rogue since you can't mobtag well, but even then having a level 60 kill everything you tag, that's really fucking good exp. One pro tip is to have a druid put thorns on the lowlvls(bonus if one of the chars is a druid since thorns is only 10min buff), then just put all the alts on /follow on the rogue and run your rogue into mobs. The lowlvls will pull and on first hit they will apply thorns and tag. Then you just kill off the mob with a sinister strike and continue. Repeat until alt is low hp and refill hp with either bandage or again bonus if one of your alts is a healer(DRUID!!).
---
Anyway I despise multiboxers of all kinds, but here's how to do it effectively. Use at your own caution and damage to self integrity.
---
Nobody likes a liar. :p
---
You could also go all the way down to elemental mastery and go 2hand for meleeing spell casters and clothies, but shield macro vs melee.
---

the more you wait, the more gold there will be in the economy, the fastest it will be from the moment you start.
---
Nguyen and China, so Nghi...
---
this does not have a good ring to it.
---
Nope. It's going to be impossible to have a successful private server this time next year. The new copyright laws will allow Blizzard to force your ISP to block your access to any offending sites or servers regardless of their hosting origin.
---
I would like to see them drop more unique items/thingies.
---
Yeah, I just did the math based on my salary and bonuses and shit... and conservative estimate I make enough money to pay for a month of WoW in about... 12 minutes?
---
It just doesn't seem like playing the AH to pay for your subscription fee is worth doing so instead of actually playing your real life career in terms of real time/value.
---
Wonderful lol
---
Yeah retail has "harder" classes to play for raiding. I wouldn't call them something even close to being complex tho. The current version of DK, my main since Wrath, makes me want to sleep when I'm raiding with it or doing M+ as almost every other class in BfA I've tried so far. Nothing is complex on BfA classes, but I guess it's more complex than spamming shadowbolt. MoP classes were complex way more than the current BfA garbage.
---
Also I'll mention PvP because on retail it's fucking braindead, when basically every class plays the same, they guy you responded to is completely right. One big CD you have to worry about, some defensives, few utility spells, builder and spender. That's it. Nothing is complex on that. Vanilla PvP is way, way more complex with so many different utility spells, items and so on.
---
WoD tanks laugh at this.
---
oh yeah, i absolutely plan to mobtag multibox my alt up via rested exp. that kind of multiboxing isn't really multiboxing to me as it's just /follow with occasional alt tabs. 
---
Being able to crush every elite quest solo with a 60 guardian angel is great, but definitely the 'low iq version' of multi boxing, which is perfect for me lol
---
I'm named Thadeus, and really like six-sided shapes, so I'm naming my toon Thex.
---
interesting idea that could probably work too. There's definitely many interesting options out there that I didn't mention or yet know of.
---
Sounds like they want to keep you around. So take the days. If they are willing to let you go over three vacation days then fuck them.
---
 Or you could always just get a summer flu.
---
How about this for an idea. If you don't like being forced into pvp don't roll on a PvP server.
---
As a hunter I hated fighting Paladins. They were my favorite class to kill but often they would outlast with bubbles/heals and (from memory) ridiculously long stuns. Getting them to bubble hearth was my favorite achievement.
---
Noone cares
---
Its hard to see past the boxes we live in, just email ya HR - make sure you highlight mental health.
---
Did someone say "Thexfury Blessed blade of the Thexseeker?"
---
Hopefully the person who reserves your name will be so understanding
---
The dishonest media with their very low ratings will tell you they are not the best pixels.
---
Yeth.
---
Narbo
---
IMO everything is monotonous in raid except maybe for tanking and Hunters (because the DPS rotation is a bit more involved, but the DMG from hunters are crap so people also don't find them fun)
---
I'm torn between running alch/herb and skinning/lw for my Druid. I want to go alch/herb but skinning/lw on fresh server is so gooood.
---
I never played DK that much as I quit early in WOTLK, but Shaman maybe?
---
Bonus if it's a troll named Thex
---
Haha nice try but it’s not the AU of S.
---
When I read the title, I knew what was coming. I love it.
---
My name is Ted and I'm a witch doctor so you can call me T. Hex
---
Can I ask how old you are? I'm 30 and have a "never marriage, never kids" life outlook, but I've been with an amazing chick for the past 6 years that certainly deserves the ring. Kids are a definite no go, and she is on board with it, but our financial situation dictates that marriage isn't ideal so that wouldnt be happening regardless.
---
But 8-10 years from now? If the finances allow it I'm marrying this girl.
---
I'd hope you're younger than me to have such a negative outlook on long term commitment.
---
[Some person made an innocuous post about their anticipation/plans for Classic and mentioned their Shaman's name would be Thex. That thread got filled with people saying they would name their character Thex and it grew into a meme.](https://redd.it/cjrmyv)
---
I'm not changing my decision but I am slightly bummed. I did expect Shaman to be populated as it pretty consistently shows 3rd most popular class Horde side on Pservers but I'm flabbergasted that it and Priest jumped up. I've been planning on Priest and the previous poll as well as pservers show Priest as usually 4-5th most popular class but for some reason in this survey it has jumped to 2nd over all most popular class, 2nd most popular on Alliance, and 3rd on Horde Side. I've always enjoyed healing so I'm going Healy Priest and not just Priest but Healer roles is over populated it looks like :\ I don't want anyone to not play what they wanna play, just minorly bummed it seems so many people want to do the same thing as me 😂
---
Are you planning on raiding? If not, you can tank with any spec.
---
Lol you're giving this guy all the responses he wants yet he's trying so hard to demean you. Wtf lol
---
Thex O'clock EST
---
Druid because I'm horde and, if classic allaince druids are going to be "authentic" it means they are going to open up on me with their dots, cast moon fire and, get hit back once. Upon taking damage they are going to travel form run away until the cycle repeats itself 20 minutes later.
---
if I remember correctly you have to go into your battle.net settings and opt into classic

May also be under options in the battle.net client

No, private server players like to claim that so they feel special. They have zero proof unless its the ones with completely fake numbers.

I feel exactly the same. Shaman was my go-to but seeing it being popular makes me question my choice. I dont even know why, when I think of it. Something about being a snowflake or something
---
Who the fuck is Thex and what are all these threads popping up?
---
T is for Thex; my shaman.
---
I wish I had friends for this :( Can I be in the guild? I plan on being a tank!

Aww ok :(

---
0 value video as it is all the easiest info to find.
---
As someone who has played every class to max in every expansion, often 4-5 times over again. I don’t think your going to find what your looking for, imo.
---
Dks when introduced were a game changer in many ways. And while they did steal the theme of some classes - especially warlock, who always gets stuff taken - ability / feel wise there isn’t anything similar.
---
It’s why when Dk’s entered the playing field, pvp was massively shifted.  I remember (at the time) in BC my Mage could sit for hours spamming AoE easily in AV racking up hundreds of kills, or go into the enemy and wipe them out single target, cc, ect.
---
As soon as Dk’s entered with their death grips though, that entire idea was shut down. Not to mention spreading diseases that actually hurt, their self healing, their tankiness, their sustain was just insane by all accounts, and the damage.
---
Dk’s kept a lot of that throughout all expansions, and while their playstyle changed here and there, they always have been a good anti-caster class, with good sustain, while being melee that can cast spells.
---
Imo, the closest thing to that in classic would be enhance shaman, but even then, I don’t think that’s anything really similar. 
---
If you really wish to play classic, I would instead decide if you want to stick with the undead-like theme (and go warlock) or if you don’t care about the theme, just pick a class that sounds fun, because nothing will really give you a similar feel to Dk.
---
If you're being serious (you would risk your house and livelihood and marriage I suppose if you decided to play Classic) you need to stop coming to this sub. That's some legitimately unhealthy shit.
---
i hope ppl wont be this kind of hardcore crybabies and start to get some 60s groups into those zones to pvp them away

quality shitpost

Yesssss transmogging is the best. One of the things I absolutely hated about vanilla was the gear looked so bad. And rarely ever matched until you got to higher levels.
---
I enjoyed it.
---
I didn't assume anything. I asked a question. He's just 12 and is offended by language.
---
Personally I've never had a guild not ask for gold unless I was farming myself or spending gold on mats. Raids were so expensive it makes me wonder how many people here even did them. Some more casual guilds wouldn't be pushy I remember, if you couldn't afford it that was fine. Higher levels would cover it in turn since it was a big "pay it forward" mentality. After a while as the guild got settled we wouldn't need to ask for cash but then it ended up being a few high levels paying out for a lot of lazy people. Good lads. Just a teamwork thing trying to pool resources for the best success as I saw it.

The potions that cost a fuckton and are necessary to complete the raid

---
While it all SOUNDS great, it's still a big no go. 
---
Players are already going to be spending the majority of their time in IF/Org when they arent actively doing anything in the world. Dont give them a reason to further remove themselves from the server community.
---
I'm really casual, so I just went with the Ultimate Visual Guide.
---
When you join a group, your abilities become the group's. Mages give food, warlocks summon and rogues open chests.
---
Once you start getting some +damage gear with some +hit (ZG with some BWL pieces) SM/Ruin becomes the best PvE spec (if you can have a corruption up) along with a pretty nasty PvP spec as you can Shadwbolt-&gt;Coil-&gt;Shadowbolt-&gt;Shadowburn most people to death without them being able to do much. SL build are fun when geared, but not as good imo.
---
I played DS/Ruin then SM/Ruin then SL for a bit to tank Twin emps and then DS/Ruin again for Naxx (we wanted a 0/2, 1/2 and 2/2 HS in raid so all locks specced that) plus DS voidwalker was nice for Loatheb.

HEY ARE YOU GUYS HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE JOE ROGAN PODCAST BECAUSE I LOVE TALKING ABOUT THE JOE ROGAN PODCAST

Must be fake, I don;t see any Chuck Norris
---
You're telling me. I was only a kid when I played Vanilla and didn't get into macros until Wrath. The kinds of insane things I would have been able to do with the old macros... I would have literally built an in-game bot to depopulate the Plaguelands.
---
Just do what I did. I literally quit my telecommunications tower climbing job just so I could play classic for 2 months straight.
---
can some ELI5 what thex is?
---
Very good to know.  This put me a day behind when BfA launched.  They really need to stop posting all official announcements as Tuesday, Aug. 27th.  That's way too confusing since traditionally they always launched expansions on Tuesday (12 a.m.).
---
Is this referencing something? Or is it just hilarious?
---
You are a true master.
---
27. I also have a girl I've been with for 7 years in September. I love her. If she wants to get married then I'll do it for her. Doesn't mean such a thing is the norm. Just means I got super lucky.
---
I thought it was Slapfactory
---
Dungeon tanks are generally dps warrs in their farmed tank set, scrounging for gold etc, so if anything it's the opposite.
---
Notthex also seems like it might be an equally great name for the lulz.
---
Well night elves are the one race where this does have some benefit, but otherwise you stay on the boat to Theramore, and then boat to Stormwind. You get the extra Theramore flight point which you'd want for later.
---
Caap.  Stop trying to get name ideas from us OP!
---
One look at /u/Snowjob_tv's post history confirms they are a very negative person. I don't mind discussing aspects of the game with people like that, but you have to tune out all the personal attacks and other annoying crap.
---
Probably an undead mage, named Thex.
---
I was hoping warlock wouldn't be so popular, at least not on alliance where WotF is over hyped.
---
those werent really options on the table, all changes should be to create an authentic vanilla experience, not to change the game to something else. respec cost was there for a reason and people liked it, even the ones who complained didn't realize what they had and woould change their minds quickly when the negative consequences started accruing.
---
Seems like OP really wants Thex
---
I know you'll get downvoted to oblivion, and so will I, but this is actually one of my favourite discussions. I've posted this before but I love to share my thoughts. I really hope they do fresh expansions, but don't just rerelease content.
---
1) No flying, ever, anywhere. As soon as players are in the air they are immediately 'safe', and safety should be a rare gift in the world of warcraft.
---
2) No exponential jumps in stats from one expansion to the other. In my opinion this is what broke wow. Having raid gear at the end of one expansion with +10 STR on it to having quest gear the starting zone for the next expansion with +15 STR leads to a race that can never be won. How many times will they stat squish before they get it? Linear progression please.
---
3) No power creep in terms of story. They're always raising the stakes to the point where I stop caring. At the end of legion I'm super guru commander of everything, right? Where do I go from there? Why does it matter any more?
---
4) No catchup mechanics. Every part of the game should be important, no matter when you're joining.
---
5) Just because you're releasing an expansion doesn't mean you have to jump up 10 levels. How about releasing a new continent/world that has lower level stuff in it to? So when we all level a new character we get some new content as we level? Lots of MMO RPGs do this.
---
False if you both roll the same race. A warrior can get a shaman pet at level one.
---
Shoulda had a Zboard...
---
Shhhh don't remind thousands of people please.
---
You called?
---
Shamans are an offensive supportive caster in PvP. They are great healers and they also do insane damage at the same time. Most people spec 30 points into elemental and 21 into resto. 
---
Paladins and shamans have very different play styles. Paladin is incredibly defensive. They spend a lot of time buffing and protecting their allies and they almost never run out of mana spamming their fast heal flash of light. FoL is the best sidle target heal in the game basically. 
---
Shamans are very offensive oriented. They can give their allies insane damage with windfury totem and also use other totemic buffs on their allies. They have the best aoe healing spell in the game chain heal. 
---
Overall it’s a very different playstyle between Paladin and shamans.  It’s as different as the Horde and Alliance. They are thematically very distinct. Alliance is all light and protecty and civilized. Horde is tribal, valuing honor and strength. 
---
Paladins are slow and don’t do a lot of damage. But they have incredible supportive tools that are super strong. 
---
Shamans are fast and can do a lot of damage, and they have their own supportive kit.
---
They said they WILL be banning for model edits of any kind after that last banwave, just a heads up for returning players.
---
Frost is just more efficient and easier.. if you just want to play casually and have fun.. just play fire and burn everything :)
---
Lol were you standing 100m away taking snaps while your guild downed Rag?
---
Whats a downranked heal?
---
MCing people is one of lifes greatest pleasures
---
I plan on rolling as an Ungoro/coarse blasting powder hybrid until reaching max fishing
---
I'm rolling a shaman named Thex. Pls don't take my name ffs.
---
lol, you could take a random person on the street and they might know who Leeroy is.  Fuck, he gets referenced in my office regularly by non wow players.
---
Nobody knows who Kungen is.
---
And this is coming from someone that played on Leeroy's server/faction and played with Kungen in Lineage 2
---
he did the Thex
---
Just to be perfectly clear this isn’t alli ganking this guy is complaining about the Nelf rangers that patrol south barrens not knowing they’re npcs
---
Flight was one of those double edged swords. The world is massive and the time it would take to venture between areas would make it mind-shatteringly tedious to to anything. 
---
I do completely agree with the stat mechanics though. I remember doing raids in Cata for really great gear, then then greens in MoP made top tier raid gear look like Grey items.
---
All, because I'm slow and I hate you guys.
---
Time to make a bot to get "thex" on every realm.
---
&gt; was
---
Brother, still is. Forget what that crazy federal government says!
---
Thex is mine
---
when you get gear it turns into who has more outs, so go in with frost reflector, LIP, SOID, net trinket, double iceblock, poison cleansing remedy, grenade. Do all that and the last one standing when the cc chains are done wins.
---
I think it's "Thex"
---
thex
---
Thexxxx lol just trolling and bored
---
Thex’ar Ogar!
---
Awesome, thanks :-)
---
I’m pretty sure I’m gonna get my shamans planned name. It’s long. It’s complex. And no person or bot will get it. It’s gonna be a PvP orc shaman named dunkasaurusthex
---
Righteous?

You weren't on Azsune EU were you?
---
i'm william shatner, and i'm a shommen

Troll Shaman I think named Thex.
---
Thanks for quick answers everyone. I'll highly likely respec and mess around with both builds at some point. Just really wanted to know if setting everything on fire was workable and not a waste of playing the class.
---
Thanks again.
---
Ive been tossing up between a few names but I think I’ve settled on Thex

Classic is going to be filled with 24h no lifers sprinting to level 60, not gonna be nostalgic at all :(

I'll never forget stocking up on Red Bull for the launch, eventually going to bed with severe palpitations then having to reroll off Archimonde due to the server problems.
---
idk about best but definitely top 4.
---
What would you say is the best leveling spec out of those three?
---
It would have been true with TBC mount training which only requires you to have 150 riding skill.
---
I understood this reference.
---
me
---
So is it saying the 12th for character creation?
---
Yeah, wtf is youtube like downscaling older videos?
---
im testing a druid out on PS and honestly you become the shitters of society, i gank and run away and chase, root and heal, faerie fire and dash your sprint, just a cancer on normal people.
---
I think you are mixing up all the mechanics changes from WotLK onward with heirlooms.
---
And the difference between an explicit xp boost and something that lets you kill mobs 20% faster is an illusion. Either way you level faster, the mechanism by which that happens does not matter.
---
Can’t rely on Frost nova either. Shapeshifting breaks roots. Mana shield will make the mage run oom very quickly, even with evocation.
---
I think many would disagree but I only read the War of the Ancients trilogy by him and enjoyed it I know nothing of his other writing.
---
I've been raiding 10/20/25man for all the WoW I've played. After so much raiding 20man feels actually like a pretty small group. I wonder how crazy 40man will be.
---
Blask battle saber might be what is easiest to go for.
---
This is amazing and actually makes me want to play a druid.... I wish every class had something amazing like this.  Well done.
---
Ret Paladins have surprisingly little gear competition. But in raids, you'll be healing in a baby blue dress.
---
Back in Vanilla I played a pally and gear was rather easy for me to win in dungeons. Depending on the tank (and the tank's spec) I could roll on DPS gear and two handed weapons all day long.
---
There were DPS warriors of coarse, but they leveled so slow I didn't see to many and if the warrior is leveling fury, then he doesn't want two-handers anyways.
---
Back then rogues, mages, and locks were way more common and feral druids too. What's a tank druid going to roll on that a ret pally wants anyways.
---
I don't want them too. Honestly it's just another thing for people to get toxic over.
---
Do you already have keyboard, mouse and headset?
---
Edit: Build around a Ryzen 2600 and RX 580.
---
Speak for yourself.
---
That's just your opinion man...
---
It's a mix. Devilsaur is BoE, but you have to he 40 to specialize. In contrast, Recipe / patterns in tailoring are BoE, but the crafted item is BoP.
---
You are in for a treat!
---
I leveled as fire in vanilla and again on a different server in BC.  Fire is fine for leveling.
---
I was just looking for a friend on amazon, shinnobee makes a decent gaming pc with various options from 299-499$ish. You could always update the hardware later on too....
---
Pretty much anything. Aim for 8gb of ram or more, and make sure it has a dedicated graphics card. Beyond that, it doesn't really matter.

Fun fact. If you read the bible. You'll be able to read about the character who Chris Metzen used as inspiration for Thrall.

Classic wow economy and group content is not meant for streamers so i completely understand that
---
Technically it is, but killing afk players that do not fight back is not what most people think about when they are talking about PvP.
---
Thanks for your stab at the question, that's why I asked because I've also seen conflicting info.
---
That's awesome that you're that dude! You had one of the first elitistjerks-esque sites that I used to put myself a step up, because back then people didnt know how to do homework and research. Thanks so much for your overall contribution to this scene/community, and at least one person (me) is stoked to see you back. 
---
I'm gonna keep tabs on your site since I figure you'll be updating it regularly now. Love from a non-Rogue!
---
Yes. Not the best quality, but will do for now. All I'm looking for is the computer itself. Will upgrade monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc over time.
---
Hi everyone! Very excited to play Classic with you all. I want to play a class that really suits my playstyle. I love flexing at my foes and want to be known as the flex or something like that...oh! I know!! THEX!!
---
Indeed. Painful lessons, some of them ;)
---
Oh...
---
You can "skip" Molten Core &amp; Onyxia depending on your class if you get the blue pvp set but if you want to enter Naxx you'll need an entire new set with a mix of BWL/AQ 40 gear, Naxx is no joke. 
---
So if you're serious about entering Naxx you need to start raiding when phase 4 comes so you'll be ready for AQ 40 in phase 5.
---
Thane, and my favorite country is Texas.
---
why would you think that a streamer would not get suspended? Many of the streamers that are even really serious about Classic have all been suspended at some point already.
---
Much appreciated thank you. It'll likely be 5 or 6 months before I'm 60 anyway. So I might then just play fire until 60 at which point I'll probably be very ready to try something new like Frost.

Savage strikes is a very good talent, melle hunters do exist in Vanilla and are played at high levels in PVP please don't kid yourself.
---
No Rogue or Warrior will be happy to melle you 1 on 1 when they get hit with 2k Raptor strikes from high end 2h's...you can see how strong they can be even choosing to melle only vs Warriors and Rogues and crapping all over them (Yes that's Monkeynews btw one of the best Warriors in Vanilla Wow currently)

Enjoy.
---
So on further research (because I was getting some previous stuff wrong), I think your macro isn't firing correctly because 1.12 just doesn't let you cast two spells at once.  (just tested with PoM Pyroblast)  Your macro *should* work on classic live, but there is no way to test at the moment.  As Murkomatic pointed out though, you might want to do it in a cast sequence so you don't accidentally hit the button and refresh SoR while judgement is on cooldown, because your current macro will probably do that.
---
Please tell us about your first, Thex.
---
In case the servers go tits up on launch, basically. Basically just separates reserving your name from taking the time to create your character.
---
Understand where you're coming from on that; but, I see questions posted all the time regarding what spells can be skipped to save money for a mount. Buying only the necessary spells on that list saves roughly 35 gold at level 40 which is pretty big.
---
There is the disclaimer on there that it only considers solo leveling and takes nothing else into consideration such as pvp/dungeons/etc... but I perhaps need to make it more obvious. I'll look into some possible solutions for that when I get the chance.
---
Thanks for the suggestions.
---
You don’t

Ah good old 600x800 resolution, you can’t get more vanilla then this

Nice! I hope you guys join the server.

Ya, I played Vanilla from day one but I played on a PvP server so it was possible to take care of at least half the bots.

---
Well that mentality and a hyper focus on skill is why arenas became a thing which were a god send for some and another reason to quit the game for others. ( personally I love all forms of pvp)

Im not understanding this thex joke but hey it's funny

By slaughtering the people that didn't finish leveling to 60 by phase 2.

Restorative Totems is a 25% increase to a very, very small amount of mana regeneration for 5 entire points. I mean sure, it's going to benefit someone spamming totems in the long run, but Totemic Focus, Mana Tide and Nature's Guidance are far more impactful resto talents for leveling.
---
That being said, resto levelling is mind-numbingly slow when you get to the later levels.
---
Lol nice, but should of ended it with

Yeah, I'll think of some other way to code it for people. Maybe have more colors such as green=you'll need if you plan to dungeon heal. red=you'll need for tanking dungeons, etc....  maybe something else... I dunno

Honestly my target audience started as just myself and guildies but it started to grow more so decided to share. Now I gotta be more careful with stuff like that color code. lol

Ya.......so no where in that link does it say "realm names will be released prior to Aug 13th"
---
All it says is realm names will be available prior to launch. 
---
*Before launch does not = before Aug 13th*
---
So I reinforce what I said earlier about you pulling it out of your ass. Like I said, there have been dozens of posts about if Blizzard will release the server names BEFORE Aug 13th and so far there hasn't been an answer.
---
The answer you've provided is the same answer that we've all had for weeks upon weeks. Nothing new.
---
So you're wrong, and the link you provided just reinforces that you're wrong
---
If you think the stress test population is indicative of what it will be on live you’ll be mistaken.

My name is Anthony, and as of 2 minutes ago, my favorite country is Malaysia.
---
You could level with ench/herb then switch to ench/alch or if you want engineering for pvp i would level with ench/mining
---
Can you give a source that say what you said?
---
There's barely any difference between melee builds unless you're earthbind kiting, in which case a slow 2H would be preferrable.
---
Ele leveling kind of works post-40, but the increased dps nowhere near makes up for the massive downtime you have drinking.
---
They have three for each it just depends on your expectations. I played all 3 in pve and pvp and had a blast doing it.
---
They are guessing, they don't even know how the armor debuffs work so they just let them all stack giving pserver bosses 0 armor. You're actually wrong. Nice try though.
---
The chances sunder, faerie fire, and expose all stacked like they do on private servers are next to zero. You can literally go watch videos with the dev of Nostralius saying as much. Anyone claiming anything else is bullshitting.

That's where I'm torn.  Identity is good but locking each spec out of the majority of content isn't good design either.  I lean towards identity over viability but I wanted to see what the overall consensus was

Neither of those are true, and if you don't care why'd you comment?

How'd you know what I'm naming my character?

Why would you stop and farm instead of just continue leveling and buy it when you can lol

I don’t get why you’re stopping leveling to farm gold, you can farm gold while you keep leveling.

Thing is classic heavily favors the person with the most time on their hands. Time to raid, to rank to the pvp potions, time to get engineering, and stock pile bombs and such.

He was putting out videos at the peak of the "let the bodies hit the floor frag montage" period.  But yeah, he would go into AB with 10 of his buddies spam healing him and headshot a gnome mage in tier 0.

If you’re eager to claim your character name in WoW Classic, take note: we’ll be opening character creation on Tuesday, August 13.** Players with an active subscription or game time on their account will be able to create up to three characters per World of Warcraft account. **We’ll have more information on realm names closer to launch, but rest assured—you’ll have plenty of time to figure out your plans for realm domination!**
---
Clearly that implies that prior to the 13th realm names will be released. 
---
I’m not pulling anything out of my ass. Not to mention you have literally *zero* information to reinforce your stance so you look more foolish and like more of a jackass for trying to be cocky and flex on me with nothing.
---
They wouldn’t reference realm lists in the the same paragraph literally right after the reservation date if they weren’t implying that the statement is linked to the character reservation.
---
People have been wanting Xpack Locke’s servers since new Xpacks were a thing. It’s always been a part of the WoW scene.
---
The original mount is actually quite easy to have money for as long as you’re not spending on useless auction house shit.
---
Nah it's pretty much for sure the best burst class at late game gearing. It's actually absurd how much damage you can put out.
---

Yeah, must have missed the campaign for them...

I accidentally read the title as "Guild Texas." I assumed that you were looking for only players in Texas to join your guild lol!

I am genuinely confused by this thex shit
---
Understandable, it’s a great resource. Maybe various shades of green - yellow based on how “urgent” the spell is.
---
That way if people end up short at the trainer there’s a rough guide for what to prioritise
---
Hate going against hunters as a warlock or mage

Does Phase 2 come in April?

"Makes my lightning bolts extra spicy" - Troll Shaman
---
I love this sub
---
I think most rational people would agree that there are many parts of vanilla that are poorly designed, most off-meta specs included - but that's just part of the charm.
---
A thing I like about shaman is taking a very basic "boring" class and using its limited tools to do cool shit. Like juggling a mob between a Stoneclaw and Searing totem, or using Grounding totem to succ up boss abilities to a point where it feels unintended.
---
Moonfire on druids.
---
Not april but 2020 for sure - rank up in phase 2 - enjoy only doing open world pvp for 14 hours a day lol
---
Let the man live his dream this world sucks anyways just play till you die, fuck it
---
And his point was that the statement remains true even if you play like an [ableist slur here]
---
Don't stop and farm, just keep leveling to increase your income.
---
The main reason to level as frost is for control over your battles, mages are glass cannons and if you pull more than 1 mob frost spells can be the difference between living and dying, so you can absolutely level as fire but you have to be more cautious with mob pulls or play with friends
---
Lol... Thex...
---
It really depends. If you can get on early and a quest or two ahead of people, you can just fly through it. I did that in both stress tests. The real shit show will be several hours into the launch, lol.
---
Do you honestly think Blizzard would unleash phase 2 only 2 months after launch? You know, the phase with pvp honor and bis gear but no bgs so levellers have to be farmed 24/7? I think he means a couple of months each, that would make more sense. So phase 3 and BWL in about 8 month. The majority of all players would not even reach 60 before BWL if its only 4 month.
---
Edit: Or do you think a couple means 2? I guess it technically does, but not when used in that context. This is Blizzard and lawyer talking. Summer 2019 turned out to be end of august... Well well, we will see.
---
It would be terrible for A LOT of players if phase 1 lasts only 2 month. Every 50 zone will be camped by  rankers for months.
---
Secede from the union!
---
Daca
---
Awesome spreadsheet!
---
What are the stat weights on the dungeon drops tab? It says based on Teladrils stat values but I could not find them.
---
Hopefully you're right. My only concern was hearing that Classic will not support multiple cpu cores. Not sure how that'll affect performance, but if it's comparable to or better than retail, I'll be happy.
---
[Welp, get on it.](https://i.imgur.com/mcR13iJ.png)Tomorrow in the afternoon/evening would be a good time to get some attention!
---
Interesting. This is my personal opinion obviously, but I find the calls a LOT more engaging than Josh reading a bunch of forum posts back to back. I can read the forums myself any time, I never get to interview devs and celebrities.
---
That's correct. Phase 2 adds the pvp ranking system, and one of the earliest ranks rewards you with said trinket
---
Gear really wasn't that important in classic.
---
The biggest issue back in the day is as follows: players on bad pcs, bad internet connections, and no clue how to play the game. That was about it. To compensate people min-maxed gear requirements and classes for their raid group. In reality it's not necessary if you just have good players to begin with.
---
and in the other parts of the media summit the reply was again 'stay flexible, base it around overall user progression and - to expect the first phases to follow a similar path as the original
---
then we would be counting november to june aka 8 months for BGs
---
Both are pointless numbers in the end.
---
Either way I doubt that they will a) toss BGs (and with it the death sentence to the open pvp zergfests) and b) ZG at players after 4 months when the majority of the playerbase probably hasn't even finished their attunements for Ony  - if they've even managed to level up to 60 that is.
---
Leeroy!
---
it would be kinda dumb and unfair if they only allowed character creation on the 13th and then shut the servers down again. I *assume* character creation will stay open once it starts.
---
Because the rogue would have no other way to get to the chest if 4 other people didn't help clear the mobs protecting it.
---
Weird Thex but ok
---
Need nades to deal with blink-aways
---
I was like "what does this have to do with.... Ohhhhh I'm an idiot that's how"
---
ZG is phase 4. Alterac Valley and Warsong Gulch are Phase 3.
---
Speculation is pointless. What we do have is an estimate of two months for Phase 2 and another two months for Phase 3 from the game's director. Everyone else from Blizzard speaking on the subject takes their cues from him.
---
In any case, Battlegrounds launched less than 4 months after the European release during Vanilla.
---
If I had friends to do LAN parties with, I wouldn't need Classic for that. I'd waste every free second playing any (oldschool) LAN compatible game under the sun with them.
---
Negative ghostrider, they don't.
---
Thank you all for helping me with that! 
---
I appreciate the responses. 
---
I also have another question for all of you...
---
Since nothing is set in stone does anyone think blizzard will opt in to that option to transfer servers or games to take your 60 to the retail from classic?
---
I think I see it happening in the future. Or personal level caps? 
---
Last question.
---
If you say it’s not going to happen please tell me how you know
---

couple  
---
: two (things) or a few (things)
---
&gt;[cambridge.org](https://cambridge.org)  
---
two or a few things that are similar or the same, or two or a few people who are in some way connected:
---
In this context, a couple means a few, that can be 2, but it can also be 5, or 3, or even 6. Can mean anything really. One thing is sure, when he is that unsure, it doesnt mean exactly 2, even if it can mean 2, but that would be pretty extraordinary.
---
You better be fast youre name creation will be gone as fast as asmongolds will on every server. Dont worry i am not Thex.
---
I believe latest rank for shadowguard is already highly mana efficient?
---
R is for Rogue, the most feared in the land.  With a *woosh* and a punch, your eyes then met with sand.  You struggle and stumble as they cut you apart, a rogue in a flurry is a work of art.
---
Farming leathers in STV was my go to way to make gold. Heavy leather iirc.
---
Use rank 1 shadow word pain instead.
---
Just my 2 cents but I feel like these reasons are why classic is getting so much attention. No more pay to win, heirlooms, obscene quantity of mounts. 
---
Leveling is going to be hard AF, we can use each other to build a community and interact and that is super attractive to those of us who tried the new version but lost interest.  
---
I remember getting a mount the first time was one of the coolest experiences of that year (2007 or whenever i played) and that was only a little after level 40.
---
Edit: Changed the year to 2007 (freshman in HS)
---
Could someone tell me exactly what time it will open Central time (Texas)?
---
Dude, even with max flight speed the travel from Stormwind to the far south took like 20 minutes... it was gnarly aggravating for raid farms. The only thing I would say is that every class should have a “Dismount” type of attack. Or at least incorporate some sort of thing where ranged attacks can still be used in the air. I mean, I never saw a lot of people just flying away from a fight because if you’re in combat you can’t mount up.

Rank 14 being in a league of its own, even compared to naxx.  Naxx, you just have to make raid times for 6-8 months.  Rank 14 is a full time+ job and still only works if you know the right people.
---
I actually don't recall. For some reason I'm leaning toward 100% XP but you don't get loot unless you hit it. Or maybe you don't get either. But the pet can kill an entire mob and still have half HP. Shadowmeld CD is 10sec, and you should be able to dart out and hit/loot the mob safely before anyone comes near you with tracking. Without shadowmeld, you'd be killed and lose the mob anyway.

This won’t work against any decent player. First, it requires you to be daggers, a lot of rogues go swords for pve. Second, the ambush will allow them to blink immediately, you still have 1.5s before you can cold blood evis. They can easily flame blast -&gt; r1 frost bolt, your grenade channel is longer than their cast. Hitting a max range grenade is 50/50 at best, assuming equal skill. At that point you must vanish if you miss the Grenade, leaving you with 1 vs 2 ice blocks. Plenty of consumables or pet trinkets from the mage at this point make it unwinnable. 
---
It’s not even like you can catch them off guard, sap -&gt; cheap shot gives them 3+ seconds of time to be ready to blink your ambush opener.
---
if this was current day Barrens chat we'd be golden tbh

5 months per phase min.
---
I did this once and got double crossed. Killed a warlock who downed the devilsaur, kek'd on em and everything. Another rogue came and ganked me. I thought it was odd that a warlock was killing a devilsaur but didn't really care. Not gonna lie, I laughed my ass off.

Good guide here on maxing reps: https://shadowpanther.net/questing.htm [@Shadow__Panther](/u/Shadow__Panther)
---
&gt; reaching Exalted with another race by level 40 is just not possible. To reach Exalted, you will need to complete many more quests and/or complete "turn-in" quests. At level 47, you can turn in Morrowgrain and Un'Goro Soil for Darnassus rep. At level 50, you can complete Runecloth turn-ins for any of the four factions.
---
Their being common is easily out shined by their overall desirability. 
---
I would definitely not cry if my 5 man group had 3 mages.

Roll mage.  Pew pew

You will ride your horse and you will like it, silly human.

Especially with Blizzard banning and muting people left and right for any joke that could even be considered slightly offensive or w/e. You can't even make anal jokes in retail in public channels anymore without getting a 12+ hour ban most of the time.

&gt;Sure, and in this context "a couple months" more than likely means two. Not more than two, just two.
---
Wow are you serious?
---
Ion said: "A bit FLEXIBLE. If you ask me to BALLPARK a RANDOM number, I would say", 2? Is that what you believe Ion said? Being flexible and ballpark a random number 2 and not "a few". Yeah, logic. That makes sense. That context makes perfect sense, he said 2. Lets pallpark a random number, 2. lol. Jepp, you are right, makes perfect sense. Especially based on what we know happens in Phase 2.
---
1024x768 most likely.
---
Still have my \`06 1440x900 monitor...
---
I think a lot of people are overestimating the need to pvp in phase 2, like vanilla it will be server dependent
---
I can see a few very active servers and a few servers with a more casual population, the pserver tryhards won't be all on the same server this time
---
Hahahaha you are very correct
---
Anyone who calls another player trash that downed C'thun, has never fought C'thun in Vanilla.  There was one guild on my server that cleared Naxx before they managed to take down C'thun.

I'm not saying we aren't getting a list prior to the 13th, I'm just saying from all the information provided so far, the soonest CONFIRMED date we will get them is on the 13th.

You're the one claiming you KNOW we're getting them prior to 13th.

This is what I was basing my belief off of.
---
No flying, no dual spec (added in wotlk) no daily’s for gold farming, no loot tokens from bosses till AQ40,
---
If that's so, then you don't need to charge stupid ass late fees.  Everyone in the guild should be striving for fast clears and be online and ready unless some unaccounted for shit caused them to be late.  Your rules are more along the lines of some shit-tier guild that can't really clear anything and is trying to blame anyone else for their failure.
---
Nope there was not.
---
DPS had like 500-650k health, I can’t remember tanks though. I think some people had 10 mil with all possible buffs and cooldowns, but I’m not 100% sure.
---
I'm not making any assumptions. I'm just reading what was written by Blizzard and taking it the same way everyone else on this sub has taken it.
---
You're the anomaly that either can't read or is so optimistic that you believed we're getting them early so much that you peddled it as a fact.
---
Most classes have one viable pve spec.  Warriors are the only class that can tank all boss fights.  Gold has more meaning.
---
I did it the last time I played. I could casually PvP and still get decent gear from reputation rewards etc

Here's an excellent list showing what was added to vanilla from BC. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cdmx4b/how_much_was_vanilla_different_than_bc/etuzbvi?context=1
---
They are comparing low lvl questing to the maximum level of content that Retail has to offer. People are taking issue because its a stupid comparison. Most legitimate would be to compare Vanilla Raid boss fight clips vs Retail Mythic fights.
---
Thanks for this. I remember in BC there were a lot of options in specs. I’m looking forward to experiencing a more narrow class identity
---
excellent. I needed new desktop backgrounds!! this is beautiful. Thank you!
---
My vanilla hunter had 36 billion HP and like triple that in DPS, or that's at least what I  remember from 15 years ago.  Tauren HP racial was ridiculous.
---
This is outdated.
---
It's usually not a problem finding a group as a mage, so don't let that hold you back
---
Have you done the math or pulling it out of your ass?
---
Loot tokens. As in the ones similar to the vendors from WOTLK? Like the ‘chest piece of the vanquisher’?
---
Is that monkey
---
Thanks I’ll take a look!
---
You know what’s fucked up is that I guessed that exact story.
---
Wouldn't it just be Beap?
---
Yes, the leveling process is slower using a quest completionist strategy, about 2-3 times slower. I’m not aware of any other rep guide like it, Horde or Alliance.
