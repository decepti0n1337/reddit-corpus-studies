I chose a PvP server this time so I could gank low levels, ninja items, and just be an overall cancerous nugget. Back when I played vanilla wow 15 years ago, I was that low level alliance newbie putting the group first, getting ganked by high level rogues, and getting my items &amp; quest mobs taken from me.
---

---
I'm making sure that I do everything completely opposite this time around. Didn't get a chance to be a dickwad in original WoW, so now i get to be one!
---
---
---
It's about 100-150 hours I think. Of course it all depends on certain factors but I'm averaging 300-400 rep an hour in a 3-5 man group only running the furbolg genocide quest. 1 run can be about 6-8 minutes if we're lucky with no questers or Horde around.  
---
I'm half way there.
---
It's super sketch. He can reset while doing this. Also you have to wait for him to be in that spot. I takes him 5-7 minutes to pat there if he's not there already.
---
BGs are phase 3
---
Alright, man, wow.
---
This is truly just sad.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;or that everyone is strong enough not to care about wasted time / bad experience.
---
Wasting your time is not bullying. It never wi be bullying. Your definition of bullying is seriously damaging to what real pulling (and emotional trauma) is. Please stop this ridiculous melodrama.
---
You are the best!
---
Thank you!
---
This is just simply wrong. All this gives is +9 agi for hunters. The 1% crit only applies to melee. 
---
Even Warmonger is a better weapon.  Or any weapon with more than 9 agi. 
---
And now that DM is out, Barb Blade is a lot better than that sword.
---
Hunters don't really have a good set of dual weapons until BWL/ZG
---
Yeah, some people just have way more free time than others. My wife, kids, and career take priority over gaming like that. It worked for me in vanilla since I was a young single guy in the military. Easy to do if I wasn’t deployed.
---
I farmed elemental fire for like 2 days. I started with 26g and no mount at lvl 39 ended up with a mount, lvl 43 and 170g extra.

the wizard will pull agro so you don't have to worry about healing, and they might as well have infinite mana
---
The problem with Skeram (and I assume other servers), is the server population addons showed slight imbalances, blizzard opened server transfers, and then broke those addons. All factions on a server where they were the underdog then had nothing to go off but rumors. Rumors of guilds leaving their server and the fear of being FP/spawn camped at p2 drove all underdog factions to transfer causing an even worse imbalance.
---
"Mana Cream"...yeah, that's a hard pass.
---
Except he’s not lol.
---
Yes.
---
One involves a gun and the other involves lots of water.
---
The important part isn't getting from A to B, it's what you do along the way.
---
Orgrim Doomhammer please
---
You got everything after "Brotherhood" right, which is kind of fucking amazing, haha.
---
Honestly it's been a few hours and I don't even remember what the first part was supposed to be. ;p
---
I'd solve PvP server imbalance and ganking by giving a 1% chance every time a member of the majority faction ganks a 10+ lower level pVp target (including NPCs like quest givers) of that character being immediately transferred to a PvP server where their faction is in the heaviest minority.
---
Not a ban but I remember losing my account way back and their auto form stuff did not work, I had to call their U.S.A support line and speak to a real human to get it sorted. I imagine a chat support would do the same these days.
---
Ahhh right that changes the function a bit!
---
No you just need speed on your boots
---
Some of them drop 15-25s
---
Kind of, the twisting nether is where demons originally come, and where demons go when they die, to come back to life. But races like the Eredar, who are fell corrupted Draenei, come from planets. So a little of both I suppose.
---
This totally could have happened with pre-need lasher xp.
---
Ya I just ran it and they were mostly 4-10s
---
Mage, Hunter, Paladin, Warlock are all super chill leveling.
---
Just playing the game. Questing at level 60 and doing dungeons to get expensive mats like righteous orbs that sort of thing.
---
It's more like. "You like to pull the wings off flies too?" Shooting up a school is a bit of a reach man.
---
deadmines is vc you nit.
---
I feel personally attacked lol
---
in dungeons, tanking pugs is usually not boring XD
---
5 instance lockout was added BECAUSE of dire maul lasher farm.  It didn’t exist before that.
---
Salty forum posts like these are all the reward we need to fucking people up in world pvp. Don't even need an honor system.
---
I wanted to see it
---
Just a reminder that there are guilds requesting proof for you having no job.
---
Yup I re-rolled mage mid way and made my own groups, so easy because everyone wanted sheep bare minimum, especially for places like MGT later on.
---
No. Pretty much only mages can do this because if the zombies touch you, you're dead. This farm strat is all about dancing just out of reach
---
If they're in your faction, yeah
---
Lol
---
Same thing is true for QS.
---
Nah, pass. Do your job and heal me.
---
Välfärd
---
dude, i literally rolled a priest just for lasher farming. Imagine how I feel.
---
yeah, how dare people ask about the status of a UI element that should have been in the game since launch
---
such entitlement for wanting the game to work properly
---
gosh
---
not always true, but in general staffs have more white stats on them while main hand/off hand has higher green text stats.  as a warlock you want as much spell damage as possible so mh/oh is going to be your best bet.
---
Meh, don't, it's the way the game is meant to be played.  WoW pvp is pussy anyway, you don't even lose anything.  Most of my interactions with the other faction is casual wariness anyway, we mostly don't want to waste each other's time.  If someone's being a dick just go somewhere else.
---
Sex is temporary, WoW is forever
---
It's like 70xp per lasher so no. Not efficient at all. You're better off elsewhere
---
“Those that say ‘it’s pvp it’s allowed, don’t complain etc’ could in my view be the same folks who complain when they don’t get the loot they want, or some other common in game experience.”
---
Pvp on a pvp server is a common in game experience and you’re complaining about it. The irony tastes funky here lol
---
I’d assume the database is just not 100% complete. It’s still a decent reference.
---
Probably a priest healer with 2k hp and not keeping shield up, East is easy with 2 if you know what you're doing.
---
this is really common to see across all servers, anyone trying to do runecloth turn-ins for exalted rep will be making these offers in trade chat (i see them daily from multiple people on 2 separate servers i play on)
---
Neh. I started over after accidentally rolling horde and getting to 30. It was due to a few reasons. The alliance cities are so much better. I was on a USE server and could barely find any guilds with USW raid times. They actually split out the servers into USE and USW tabs. Figured I’d just cut my losses and re-roll. Pretty good decision so far.
---
Sunder is awesome for those pesky high armor mobs
---
Herod, and tons of people advertise for runecloth and thick leather. You good?
---
Can I offer you a dildo in this trying time?
---
Never said it was a bad thing, just mentioned that it was a thing. I'm fine with running on tight and fast groups too a lot of the time and usually prefer it. 
---
But it does mean that often the healer legit just doesn't have the mana to be topping up the rogue that likes to stand in the cleave/fire/poison. It's just good form to have a stack of food for those times when the group is moving quickly and the healer is drinking. Hell, it's even better if they get some stat food. They shouldn't need to be eating more than a few times in the whole dungeon if they are playing right, and that's perfect for re-upping the stat food.
---
Pally tank here, successfully tanked every instance I've run up to my current level 56. 
---
At low levels, all the early prot talents pale in comparison to consecration. You simply don't have the tools to generate any real aggro on more than one target at a time without it. Retribution aura helps, but it's not gonna be enough. Unless your group is dedicated to pure single-target DPS (doubtful), you need consecration.
---
That said, Sanctuary and Holy Shield are stronger. I specced out of consecration at 40 to pick them up. Rounding up groups got tricky, but by body-pulling them onto me with shield and sactuary up, I was still able to generate AoE threat, with tons more single-target threat and mitigation. I picked Consecration back up at 51, and all's been well since.
---
Holy moly you’re both stupid and you both lose ok? God it’s so cringe reading you two trying to sound smarter than the other. Do you even know what you’re saying? It’s like a white guy with a Chinese tattoo that says “chicken” when he asked for “Honor” or some shit. God!!
---
That's just because literally 50% of mobs are immune to poison/nature/bleeds.
---
Yes it does and it has always done so.
---
Should try the faerlina discord
---
Mail order brides don't count
---
I know one of my guildies was about halfway through the chain when I went to bed if that helps?
---
You only need tailoring for the set bonus that’s mentioned in the OP (crit).
---
Special character??
---
Yes it is possible.  It was certainly possible with pre need lashers with no instance lockout cap....
---
It’s pretty fast for a fury and any slower level 60 dungeon weapon is better butttttt. It’s fun so Have fun. 25g is cheap, maybe don’t put crusader on and hold out for better
---
On a server that’s 80% ally, SO TOUGH GUYS.
---
I thought a KOS list would be nice to have after getting ganked so I searched and downloaded VanosKOS.  After installing and playing I noticed that it shows a list of any players that get within range(not sure the distance but it’s pretty far) and it will color them red for opposing faction and green for same faction.  I thought to myself that this might be too much info to have.  It won’t show stealthed players but seeing any red players pop up already gives me a heads up to be on the lookout.  Wish it didn’t have that as I really just wanted a way to keep track of dbags withou having to get out the old notepad.
---
You can invite someone outside the instance, promote them to party leader, logout, they reset the instance, then you log back into a fresh instance at the beginning of the place.
---
Yeah but I mean barrens chat specifically will be dead
---
Yes, if you slam a few back your aa chip goes away.
---
Is it a defensible choice? What's the argument against it?
---
I too would like to know this
---
The majority of it is just knowing exactly what you want and how to get it in an optimal fashion. It's like the player joining full BRD runs versus the player doing anger-arena-golem runs, guess who gets SGC and HOJ first?

Nice
---
Main tanks don't usually respec for ANY reason. Their gear is not great for pvping (being mostly survival stacking). So usually they have an alt for that.
---
But yeah, what else are warriors doing all week besides main tanking raiding?
---
It's a terrible threat generator.  Ok maybe not terrible, but certainly not great.
---
Heroic Strike rank 9 adds 175 threat for 15 rage. Sunder Armor rank 5 adds 260 threat for the same 15 rage. Heroic Strike also removes the rage you would normally get from that auto-attack, so it's actually quite a bit more expensive to use.
---
By the time you are rage capped and trying to dump rage, you do not *need* it as a threat generator. It's simply a cherry on the top.
---
Changed from P servers, not from vanilla.
---
What server?  I feel like I've seen this before
---
This is how heroic strike works, it only casts on the MH swing. The feature-bug described by OP is that while you are waiting for your main hand to "cast" heroic strike, your offhand attacks during this time will have an increased chance to hit.
---
Can confirm this to be true. earthfury while quiet at the beginning has turned out to be a pretty cool realm, no regrets about leaving Kromcrush
---
It's surprising to me that this is surprising to you.
---
Don’t forget the shame we are “dealing with”. THE SHAME!!

Most of mine has been 1 on 1, too. Me, a measly level 38 trying to quest in peace. Them, a level ??, with no dick, making sure I quest in pieces.

---
No, I don't think that's it.
---
I think mobs "go social" in wrong ways. 
---
For example ogres in Badlands: I am a hunter, I want this named ogre that is protected by 5 other ogres. I send my pet in, I just snipe the main ogre, let my pet die, and feign death. And now those other 5 ogres run off to some poor, poor warrior 50 yards away and destroy him. At no point did this warrior aggro anyone even close to my ogres. He was just fighting another single ogre way over yonder.
---
Somehow because ogres are social mobs, they magically decide to help out their buddy that shouldn't be part of their group.
---
Where are you getting 4 hours from? I got 3 in a little over 3 hours in the burning steppes. Two were from the same node roughly an hour apart.

People have different opinions on twinking and it makes sense you would see it as bullying. I’ve been in the 19 twinking bracket for a couple years now on private servers and plan on jumping in here as well. Most of the fun for me comes from more or less balanced BG matches or outmatched world pvp. The challenge is what makes it great. The matches where the enemy team does no damage is just boring.
---
The fun of twinking is the very specific gear and enchant limit. There’s little chasing new gear each patch update to make sure you are always keeping up like you would at 60. There is a very limited range of gear you can get and it makes it a fun, obtainable side project.
---
As for there being no options for specialization, I would disagree. For team based bg matches, there is surprisingly, at least, two builds for most classes. I made a website specifically for this “classic19twinking.weebly.com”
---
They also sell a level 55 juice that gives spirit
---
UwU
---
At 60 warrior tanks are the most needed class, you can make your own dungeon like Strath live and res the orbs.
---
Jus yearning for a little dot love.
---
You can LOS it I think. We had a mage for that boss and he was the only one sacrificed so I can't say for sure.
---
Last boss is indeed harsh to duo, we had to clear the room and pull the boss near the entrance to his pit so I could stand on the ledge to evade the small dudes and have them stick on warrior. You also MUST LOS the poison or that's half your mana gone.
---
Thing is its unlikely if the person has been lvling the toon that they would delete it,so i would assume they are hoping that the person just has the name reserved on an alt. If that wads the case then the owner might not log on that toon for a long time if ever.
---
Nothing in a 15 year old game requires skill, what's your point?
---
I knew zero main tanks who didn't have access to absurd 2hers.
---
There's virtually zero competition on them so MTs naturally rolled on them with anyone else who wanted to for PvP.
---
Every single person I ever saw who had a Sulfuras was a raid MT, for example.
---
Yeah I'd like to know how the hell you've gotten a dozen Viskags. It's been a little over a month. I doubt you could have even killed Ony 12 times with leveling an all that. Even if you split and do it 20 man it's still a 2% drop rate.
---
I was bidding on some 1c posts, but maybe a maximum of 5-10 of them. Wasn’t nearly as the straight buyouts I did
---
If you don't like it, play PVE. Problem solved.
---
Me and a warrior did dme jump run just fine in classic.  We have just slightly better than prebis gear.  You never interrupted the sacrifice, you just LoSed it on the healer so only the tank is in LoS for it.
---
You really think someone would do that? Just go on the internet and tell lies?
---
Yes it messes you autoattack timer, it get's push back when you get hit. But still, it's what carried me to level 40.
---
Just make sure you use it right after you autoattack. The moment you see that white damage text flying from the mob, use slam.
---
You don't want your character standing there for 2 seconds getting ready to swing again, and you cast slam and lose the 2 seconds preparation.
---
coordinating cross-faction is against the tos
---
Haters are Alliance. I like, 10/10.
---
For all the complaining I see from alliance on pvp servers, seems like alliance hit back with more organized pvp.  On my server they have been doing some DM camping and there were raids in blackrock mountain.  Never see horde doing it.
---
He did literally nothing wrong. Reckoning was working as intended.
---
Lucky druid, those pants are dope
---
Is this Fairbanks? We have a guild like that aswell
---
So exactly like Alliance?

I tried appealing twice, do you know if they came back to your friend after he tried appealing?

What do you mean?
---
Raid tier from MC
---
I exclusively tanked retail since MoP and, prior to that, healed since vanilla beta in 2004.  Why take 2 hours to clear a dungeon when you could do it in 1?  There are like 6 things to do in classic endgame, and setting a leisurely pace to enjoy the sights and sounds of UD Strat on your 450th run is not a thing.  It's ok to be wrong.
---

incase you need some Karate lessons
---
this guild literally used other guild's as a resource. After leaving the guild and seeing this post. The guild is supposed to run a 2nd group and all mats from raiding go to the guild bank yet they charge for chant or any help. This guild and GM are so smart.; they just love to manipulate . Wish i was smart enough to do it myself.
---
I really want to try and organize this. Also the game ball should be a tauren for alliance players and a gnome for horde players.
---
Most players never hit 60, most stop playing at lower level ranges. 55-60 is very active on any server.
---
Right? Especially with the whole Hearthstone tourney situation. Really falling off the rails here
---
I want that book.
---
Poor baby cant sneak up on someone fighting at half health.
---
Look at it this way. If youre a piece of shit, the addon alerts you of people you can gank.
---
But I feel like even single target, in a raid, cleave makes more sense. Because it does not generate extra threat like heroic strike does. If you are just DPSing you should probably cleave not HS. But, I could also be wrong lol.
---
Sounds like they’re already getting fucked
---
I'd trade it for villian that's sick, add me on disc?
---
I healed a bunch in vanilla.  I got to the point where I would drink until I was full mana, then I would heal.  If they died before I got up, then they should learn to not pull too soon or rip agro from the tank.  Overlapping the start of pulls with drinking was quite time efficient.
---
Well, this will be self apparent to good players.  Of course people who can't think for themselves are about as annoying as whiny healers.
---
Druid actually didnt need them they went to the priest
---
Stealth player detected? Lmao wow. Why don’t you get an addon to play the whole game for you
---
That sounds reasonable
---
I've seen the same thing happen with those hillsbrad peasants, where the a farming mage will die with a horde and suddenly they'll aggro on to me doing nothing. I've never seen it happen again or with anything else
---
You can start with tailoring and skinning. Skinning with make you some easy money. Professions can be dropped whenever. 
---
 Tailoring is pretty easy. You get cloth from humanoids, recipes from the tailoring trainers. And you can buy more coveted recipes off the auction house. Or get them from monster drops.  Having a guild will help a ton too. 
---
 I'm also new to wow. It took me a minute to get used to the game. 
---
 Here's a few tips. Change your camera turning from A and D to strafing. That helps so much. 
---
 Try to get some hotkeys setup, mainly your main spells and abilities. Also don't buy every since spell when your buying new ones, as some you don't really need and it'll burn through your cash quick. 
---
 You can Google macros for your class and put them in so you can have one keypress do multiple things. Super handy. 
---
 But mainly just putting in the time will allow you to learn things. It took me a good while to get used to this game as I had never played any games on the PC besides runescape lol. But I'm loving it. Have a good day
---
It looks like Alliance aren't either.
---
I mean there is also a degree of ninjaing. I've been accused of being a ninja for needing on an item that I immediately equipped and that was a big upgrade for my spec. To me that is not the same as someone grabbing something to sell, or just on the off chance that they'll use it.
---
\*laugh in PVE server\*
---
Is this a copy pasta?
---
Not correct actually, I didn't get consecration until level 51 and tanked everything fine.  I regularly received compliments for excellent tanking.
---
Hum, well I tried suggesting reading my comment to the other guy, and that's litteraly the comment your replying too. but if you're not capable of that not sure how to get you the information.

Okay okay. Let's try this

WITH Herbalism, seems most people are averaging about 50g/hr. Without Herbalism its around 30g. This is just for pure lasher drops &amp; herbs. 
---
The other thing with being able to farm DME is that you get  access to Travelers Backpacks, Freezing Bands, Dusty Tomes, etc. you can also do your 5 instance lockout in about 35mins leaving you 25mins to hop on an alt or bank alt and do other stuff.
---
I guess I'm one of the only ones who doesn't see how this is funny in any way, and who wishes that all these players get permanently banned.

Lol I guess that works

They did come back to him after shutting down his appeals. He had actually bought another copy and power leveled to max level when a GM contacted him with an apology via email telling him they had made a mistake. Let me ask him for specifics and I'll get back at you.
---
that, actually, is what she said
---
IMO that's a good sign. Let the investigation team do their digging, and wait for the result. If it's unsatisfactory, start another chat and re-escalate the issue.
---
It’ll go down significantly after a bit. But each of those robes patterns were over 500g initially as well, and we had people that couldn’t make use of it take them from us, so tanks can have Furor’s taken from them too.
---
Sucks to have that mentality, but I’ve been fucked out of my pattern multiple times by warriors. I have lost sympathy for them in any fashion.
---
49 is where it's at :)

Phase 2
---
&gt; of a very polite fuck off was "Oh thank you, but as much as I would love to have my guild absorbed by yours, I actually have a brain, so fuck off." He said something rude, which then in turn triggered the GM of End Game to offer a bounty for people to poach from them. Obviously he didn't take it that far, because now we're here. Everybody in our discord was saying, "People are just gonna whisper their members and tell them, hey if you leave your guild and join mine I'll split the gold with you," etc... hence the OP SS of the whisper to that exact nature. I know over the last week our guild has grown to some extent, where we have 2 full raid teams and we're building a 3rd for weekend raiders. Honestly, trying to give people the opportunity to raid in a guild, with the functionality of being in a loot system, progress and see end gam
---
listen they are taking some g1 members into g2 and they can use their flawed dkp system to steal loot and resources from g2. Get the story totally correct. Either way zerth is like a cop that has never had power and is acting as such.
---
Sooking overalevel 26 item and 2g? Oh boy ..
---
I appreciate a HoT on my pet if he's low, especially if I'm sending my pet to save the healer when he pulls heal agro, but yea, I don't expect it.  I'm not even sure how to pull up friendly pet bars in the stock UI.
---
Or do it 2 hours a day and get it in 2 months. Game isn't going anywhere.
---
I got a reply shorty after from the live chat GM saying no change. Like they didn’t even bother looking at logs that I told them to look at
---
Welcome to classic wow where it looks and feels like vanilla but the players you are playing with still have the retail mentality
---
Who is getting 100g/hour?
---
Also - run Strath live as a healer and get orbs, pretty reasonable gph even if assuming no other drops.
---
I read all of your comments but thanks for clarifying your point.
---
If you're going to dictate where people play why not enforce strict server ratios in the first place.
---
You guys are buggin, Kromkrush has plenty of alliance. Most of us are 48+. Before that it’s mostly horde but not too unbalanced. Look up census status for active players it’s actually more alliance than horse. Horde just has more characters on the server.
---
I think one issue is that classic is being played differently to vanilla, with so many experienced players and so much info out there there is a much larger rush to get through the content and some people have been super nice and helpful with new players but others get frustrated and just expect everyone to know everything.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Your best bet would be to find a guild imo. Just say in general chat you are looking for a friendly casual/leveling guild. I'm sure you'll find one eventually. 
---
I noticed in another post you mentioned using the AH, you probably want to avoid spending gold while leveling so that you can afford your mount at level 40. Unless you know what you are doing and have an idea of the prices/economy/what items are used for you could end up wasting a lot.
---
Also just jump on youtube and look up some wow classic beginners guides, i've seen quite a few class specific ones as well as general ones. 
---
Ignore raiding until you are 60, by that point you should have picked up enough. With dungeons just look up a dungeon guide by level and aim to be 1-2 levels above what it lists as minimum before looking for a group, at the start of the dungeon just say that you are new and do not know the dungeon and to let you know if you are doing anything they don't like and most people will be happy to give advice.
---
Check out sites like icy veins too, they have mage leveling guides. These will give you basic info on what stats you want which will determine what gear you want. They will also give you what talents you should be taking. None of this is set in stone though, there are better leveling builds than others but at the end of the day nothing while leveling is going to seriously mess you up and just because you missed afew talents it's usually not the end of the world. These guides will also go over rotations you should be using, this is what abilities you should be using and when.
---
On your making money comment, while leveling my view would be to just be saving your money. If you want to start making more take some gathering professions like mining skinning or herbalism and be efficient by grinding mobs in areas that will allow you to use those professions. The real gold making will probably start once you are higher level though and understand more of the game, at that point you can set up a bank alt with a starting fund and start playing the auction house or set up your routes for farming to make gold that way. There's plenty of guides on this too if you do some googling.
---
I think it's just really hard for people to shake the retail mentality, or rather, the modern game mentality. 
---
Modern games are fast paced and offer constant dopamine hits to keep you hooked, they change, they offer clear objectives for you to constantly pursue and so on. It's all about you, the player, being as entertained as possible for as long as possible.
---
WoW on the other hand is slow and deliberate, it makes you work for things and it's uncertan when you're getting your next dopamine hit. You're sidelined to being a member of a whole, and your individual enjoyment is contigent on everyone else's enjoyment.
---
So you take people with that mentality and put them in a game like that and the result is they'll be unhappy with these core systems and have different expectations than you, who's more used to the pace of the game. That's how we get shit like the spellcleave meta, people expecting 1shots in every raid, warrior/mage being like 50% of the server, everyone obsessing with "BiS" gear and burning through content even though we're like months and months away from BWL.
---
As a guild master, my advice would be, don't mind those people too much. Work on creating a core of chill people you can trust and ignore the people with the idiotic mentalities - they'll leave the guild (and every other guild they join) or quit the game anyway. Concern yourself with the people whose presence is helpful to your community, make a solid core that other people will see value in joining.

Drac? Thunder fury?
---
Killing the opposite faction is pathetic?
---
How is that any different from someone with hp and damage of a lvl 40-45 character in a lvl 10-19 BG?
---
This is awesome. It's almost like the whole world is at war.
---
I’m hardly seeing a single body sooo I guess not?
---
In vanilla this change didnt happen until 1.9
---
&gt;What happens in a game is not bullying.
---
Could you show me where I said that, or are you just going to put words in my mouth to argue against because you didn't like the ones I have you?
---
why kill them when they pick up the quest?
---
Need to wait for them to get just in sight of the end and then kill them.
---
I took all the ones with special character but i just want the OG 😓
---
Here's a little thought experiment: If I get killed in a bg against a 70 rogue wearing Warglaives, is that abuse too? No matter how much skill I have I'm going to get stomped. 
---
How is that much different from a 19 twink destroying level 18/19 non-twinks?
---
Not all twinking is just bullying, but either way why even care when it's WoW we're talking about. 60s camp low levels in STV all the time for the hell of it, it's more a mentality than a character decision.  
---
I'm not a fan of twinking but I've hard a few friends who were stupidly into it for years and joined them on a few occasions. I can say without a doubt the PvP is much harder than it is at 60. The type of dueling you saw in the beta tournaments is the kind of dueling you see at 19, 29, 39, 49. A lot of farmed consumables, little tricks, heavy fake-casting and kicking, etc. It's fundamentals to the extreme, and often times you can tell a player by how they fight. If 60 PvP is BlazBlue/Guilty Gear then 19/29 PvP is King of Fighters.
---
I did extremely well in WoW PvP when I played, and I continue to do well in MMO PvP in general, but I hardly ever took a duel/match off a good twink.
---
Most of my friends who played it back in the day are older now. Some of them with their second child; they really could not invest as much. I myself don't want to invest as much in all honesty. Those I actually see playing hardcore are people like my younger brother, who never actually played vanilla (he is in his early 20ies now) and is enjoying it immensely right now. I think the expected stereotype of the player sticking with Classic, i.e. the hardcore fans from the past, is wrong; it will be again young, new people, who never played it in the first place, but enjoy the feeling of challenge and lasting reward to their efforts. 
---
I myself will drop off for a month or two and come back to continue leveling next year most likely; it is the nature of life, this game is not all that interests me anymore.
---
Have you tried their phone support? Cuts through the noise when you can just talk to a human immedately-ish.
---
I have use the Blizzard phone support once during WOTLK when my account was hacked and cleaned out, they resolved it for me right there on the phone.
---
Great advice, thank you
---
That's not ever gunna work. Real solution is to start playing tank.
---
I miss the  days of dishonor points
---
That wasn't the meaning of my reply either, hahaha,  I totally understood your comment &lt;3
---
Can you explain how you're resetting? We've been drowning ourselves and running back to rest.
---
hahaha
---
If I'm seeing them that much when they're moderated... should they really be moderated less?
---
None have dropped off. My dad, I know will keep playing. My brother in-laws, are different. I had/have a feeling they won't play for too long. So I made sure I joined a guild that would have a solid foundation before we started. Forced them to join it. So this way if they leave....I've got a good foundation of people to play with.
---
xD
---
Sounds like Vanilla to me! :)

No, I am being intelligent by being considerate. If I develop a reputation of rolling need on everything, just because I can play those roles, I will find myself without the ability to find groups in these high level dungeons. Furthermore, what else do I have to do at lvl 60, besides run dungeons? Your attitude is what would cause you to not be invited, when you would get many more runs if you would just roll on what you need within the role you are currently playing. It's not complicated at all, you don't get to roll on the draconic deflector if you aren't tanking, end of discussion, you don't get to roll on Eye of Rend, if you aren't playing as melee dps, end of story. If you want those drops, tank for the Draconic Deflector, do melee dps for the Eye of Rend. This is an incredibly simple concept that you fail to get because you are greedy and entitled.
---
Is that no good? Just Rolled a priest alt
---
Rolling something is never accidental. You intentionally have to click a few times to make a toon.
---
What, you don't have a centaur rug at home IRL?
---
No changes is meant to ensure the vanilla experience is replicated.
---
  
---
An obscure and potentially game breaking bug that almost nobody knew about is not part of the vanilla experience so I'm down with this.
---
So main reason people tend to avoid streamer servers is:
---
1. Que times idk if they're still affected but I know they were incredibly awful at the start
---
2. Griefing due to certain streamers being incredibly toxic (we all know who these people are) as well as their toxic communities
---
Overall these servers will have the biggest communities make it more likely server events will happen and not all the streamer communities are bad, but you gotta take the bad with the good you can't have a super larger server community (2k-3k + people events) without having magnets like streamers drawing attention to that server and/or event 
---
Tldr: bad stuff can happen but so can good stuff on those servers
---
No I’m on Herod in US, it’s common for lots of people to ask in trade to buy stacks
---
what you said is pretty much the same. Camping a kid's body for two hours or killing his dino can be more painful than a punch in the schoolyard.
---
I called that bullying, and you said that my definition is damaging what real bullying is. So i did not put any word in your mouth.
---
Lots of stone in this guide, maybe it'll help?

I don't believe in the concept of bad or good person. It's absurd when you think about it and is used to excuse too much bad behavior (child molesting priest, but he's a "good person" so they move him to a new church/person who does charitable work every day and positively impacts people's lives but uses the word "colored" because he's 75 and that used to be how you said "people of color" so he's a "bad person" and needs to be cancelled).
---
I'm not using abuse as a cudgel. It's just that people with some experiences and attitudes aren't going to produce any kind of productive dialog, because they are too deep in their emotions to think clearly about the topic.
---
Oh boy another one of these threads. You, you're a real superhero... /s
---
Good, one less obnoxious moron running around.
---
You mean arcanite? Yeah, see if you can get 10g. If not, drop until you sell, minimum 5g.
---
Yeah. My first run-in with them was when I was 22ish in Duskwood...saw them run past me at 4 in the morning east coast. They ran by for at least 3 or 4 minutes straight.
---
Fuck, I literally turned in that rod of transformation from Raene's Cleansing 15 minutes ago.

If you use the small rock you can just strafe back and forth with her on the opposite side and you don't even need movespeed. You should still get it because it's cheap and very useful overall though.

Long time osrs player here. We've been dealing with twitter as our customer support since 2013 and and before that customer support was nearly non existent. Anyone who reads this please heed this warning: Blizzard is likely not going to allocate significant customer service resources to this game. Do with that what you will. I've sunk thousands of hours into osrs and my worst fear was always ending up falsely banned because it's impossible to get a human to look into it.
---
lmaooo sucks for you bruh
---
ive already sold 2000g for real money. no bans : )
---
suck it blizzard
---
Yeah no. People take between 7-10 days played to reach 60, which is almost 200+ hours
---
Apparently much harder to pull off without good gear, as sacrifice is uninterruptible. Still not confirmed if bug or intended.
---
Big Darius Rucker fan huh?
---
They are not
---
"Love it or leave it" is widely recognized to be an absurd way of thinking, but there are better sources on the internet than me (and I don't want to do that much typing reinventing the wheel) so I'd refer you to google for that. As a starter, you might consider why ganking is not the solely defining trait of a pvp server.
---
Get a life.
---
Nothing for pve. For pvp almost all others.
---
Its also not 2%. It's 2% of auto attacks which comes out to a 1% or less total damage output.
---
At 120-125 make Bronze Tubes.
---
125-145 make Small Bronze Bombs.
---
145+ Heavy Blasting Powder until you get no more gains from it.
---
Ideally you can just go around and mine a bunch of ore after you get your mount, so I wouldn't worry too much about it.
---
But if you want to speed things up, you can definitely buy mats off the AH but this will likely slow your progress towards your mount.
---
And that was just about the only class that could do that, mainly because of how overpowered the Rogue stunlock was with all CDs up and the fact that only Rogues had a PvP trinket capable of breaking the stunlock, as well as an attack that scaled with absolutely nothing and had flat damage equivalent to raiding gear.
---
Since none of these players had a way to break the CC lock, they were already dead the instant the Rogue opened on them unless the Rogue dropped their combo.
---
Doesn't exist anymore
---
That's... Feralas?
---
Please see my responses in the original post.

To get to the other side.

---
Huh?
---
Oh gehennas where this screenshot was taken, the other layer was held down in the same spot by other alliance guilds. No hiding
---
What are people doing for the fire resist bis? People make it sound like you need to somehow get over 200 fire resist before lvl 60 to start raiding , but even if I get super shitty gear that just has fire resist and sacrifice all tanking stats, I'd probably still only have maybe 70 unbuffed.
---
I've made it to 50 on bigglesworth fine. There's a lot of horde but it's not crazy. Now phase 2 on the other hand might get hairy. It honestly feels balanced to me
---
That is some Twilight Zone level ironic justice right there ;)
---
True but not really on the scale I am talking about. All non jewelry and weapons were tokens.
---
&gt;What you said is pretty much the same.
---
No, it isn't.
---
&gt;Camping a kid's body for two hours
---
That has little to do with twinking. I would agree that targeting ganking can be bullying.
---
&gt;killing his dino
---
Is part of the game. Period. If someone is not mentally well enough to handle that, they shouldn't be playing the game. Coping with disappointment and frustration is an important skill that too many people aren't teaching their children.
---
&gt;I called that bullying
---
No, you called "wasted time" bullying in reference to low level battlegrounds, specifically. I completely disagree.
---
This is a video game. Getting ganked is fun and yanking other people is fun. The fact that uou can compare the inconvenience of running back to your corpse to literally being physically or mentally abused is a fucking joke and honestly irresponsible to what you are trying to do. When you sign up for a Pvp server, part of the agreement is that you will gank and get ganked. Abuse has no such agreement before hand, and when there is such an agreement, that's what people call a kinky fetish which is allowed because all parties literally agreed to it beforehand. Fuck off with what you're doing and stop whining about getting ganked.
---
Currently level 51 paladin with 11 points in holy for consecrate. Just wondering if I should be healing in dungeons decently with gear if asked.

looks like he just send his pet in on previous pack and walked away for the automatic range dismiss.

---
Have you ran hardware diagnostics? I know you say other games aren't having the issue, but it may be Classic is installing to some faulty sectors on your hard drive. Considering sometimes you have to plug pull, it sounds like your PC is locking much more than the game which is indicative of some sort of hardware failure.
---
Classic is not hard on the GPU, so probably not that, but update those drivers anyway if you haven't. Update any other chipset and storage drivers as well.
---
I'd suggest running a full read verify scan on your hard drive with https://hddscan.com/ and see if it shows any very slow or bad sectors. My hunch is your game is getting installed to some faulty parts of your drive. If this is the case, you'll need to get a new drive.
---
keep telling me how much nobody cares.. keep repeating it.. nobody cares...  maybe some day someone will believe it.
---
r/meirl the guild.
---
Wish we had that on US.
---
I miss pservers for this very reason.
---
I'm on Herod, and it's the closest as it gets to this on US.
---
EU players overall are more PVP oriented than US players it seems.
---
Same here.  My RL friends I’ve been playing with have pretty significant amounts of spare time and got up to high 50s/60 quick.  I’m not so worried about a raid spot but I’ve found myself playing dramatically less.  Just not as motivated to play when I’m so far behind the crew.  Certainly not bitter - but kinda just like “meh” now.
---
I put it on all my openers.  Just be careful using it on Sap cause nothing sucks worse than getting a Lockpick resist on a target you need to Sap.
---
If you are Horde, I HIGHLY recommend the Duskwood quest, not because it has good rewards (it doesn't) but because it has an awesome ending and foreshadows expansions 3+ years down the line
---
No, because that rogue with warglaives isn't going out of his way, going against game mechanics such as leveling and enchant exploits / getting boosted by high level chars at lvl 10 in dungeons, etc. 
---
That rogue worked hard for his gear and if you're a noob without time and knowledge on how to gear, you deserve to get slapped in the face. 
---
Have you seen those video where there is a rogue in white gear killing fully geared people in world pvp? Skill overcomes gear difference if you're not a scrub. 
---
You are basically aknowledging that your skill cannot overcome gear difference so you choose to be the one with warglaives who bullies others. 
---
You would love to be that rogue with warglaives, but you are lazy and choose to get poor man's warglaives at lvl 19. The end result is the same.
---
Nothing in classic is particularly hard; it just takes time.
---
Actually don't known how my reply is to you, I'm sure I sent this to a person who was saying if you gank low levels youn should be transfered from your server, sorry.
---
Yes today
---
:’( well then I’m definitely happy with faster phases release schedule
---
I'm not even arguing against buffing it, like I said I buff people all the time. But to argue its gonna do anything to help a dps who is playing well enough not to pull mass threat is dumb. Its a 20% bonus at the most and if you are getting hit enough to go down to 21% health, you should adjust your play.  
---
There is no reason to not buff it. But it also gives nothing of value to 99% of dps play in leveling dungeons.
---
I didn’t know what you wanted to be explained, sorry. Yeah that’s weird I didn’t notice it
---

You must be a gnome. That one went *way* over your head.
---
No, what i am trying to do with this post is to show the hypocrisy when people don't admit that twinking is bullying with extra steps.
---
It's a centildo you dildaur.
---
The lockout didn’t exist until 1.9
---
You would have done better taking consecration first then going into prot.
---
People already break 1k dps LUL

I would say the vast majority of people aren't even aware, and most don't even realize what bugs exist or what promises are made.

And without loud voices building up a croud, blizzard will stay dark and classic will suffer for it.

Playing the doomsday pawn is effective at bringing attention to an issues so I'll have fun russle some jimmies and play it. Win win in my book

---
Nope, you assume wrongly. I play on a PvE server, because in the (maybe) 5 hours a week I have to play I just want to chill out, relax, and get my mind off real life.
---
I've got no need or desire to gank, or to be ganked. Hence my choice of server.
---
Both points mentioned still stand as valid.
---
I think the way better system is to have grey players as dishonorable kills... wouldn't stop ganking but would definitely discourage it heavily.
---
I stopped reading after “60 hours a week”. Whatever happened, they are doing you a favor.
---

Yes, I said trying my “best”. Didn’t want to spend all my mana on that guy.

pretty sure there's a classic version

You can't Google it yourself?

i guess i can kinda understand that guy, i ran SM about 12 times until  i got the shield for my warrior, woulda been pissed too. fuckn mograine always dropping the damn gauntlets.   
---
but if you stated before that youre a tank its fair game of course. Its just.. i feel bad for him too. But he overreacted.
---
$11 btw
---
Wow really? I was thinking like 200-250g. Also worried if a lot of people are holding onto them they won’t be as valuable as we think once BGs release
---
Damn getting to Redridge in 8 hours is insanely impressive what the fuck. I got there at 22 hours albeit I have my professions caught up.
---
Brazzers
---
Damn shame to hear you must quit due to bills needing to be paid! Not to be a dick at all man, but is the 15 dollars too much that you have to quit the game?
---
Yeah I had this happen earlier today. A rogue decided to aggro 3 elites in Stromgarde and vanishes after nearly dying and guess who gets the aggro :) 
---
I unintentionally did this to an alliance once as well. I handed in the quest in the circles in Arathi and it spawned the elite giant and there was a mage nearby killing an elemental and the elite went straight to him and killed him. I played Vanilla and I don't remember this happening but it does result in some hilarious situations.
---
Oooo Burnnnnnnn... yo mamma jokes. Ironic that I haven’t heard one since I was a teen. Lmao!
---
How much are you selling your transmute cd for? On my server its only 5 gold. For a 2 day cooldown that's like 10 silver an hour..
---
I'm leveling druid and every time I end up in a random party with warlocks it's super fun. I get to lean into the hybrid thing while the lock goes ham. A+ would recommend
---
&gt;  (due to the fact that to get a crit, you must get a hit) 
---
that's the way spells work, not melee. spells do two rolls, melee does one roll.
---
Wait but then what did you mean by "darkest feral aspects of nature"? The one thing Druids all share between games and mythos is balance, you couldn't possibly be more neutral.
---
you're in both since blizzard laid off their support staff
---
An Elitist Jerks forum post from 2006? Yep let's just go grab that.
---
fuckin nark
---
Feels bad man. Hope it works out.
---
honestly problems only occurred for me around zf onward. Dungeons will require more out of the dps from now on
---
Where can I disable that? If I don't have an Xbox is it even there for me?
---
That's how BRD is for us every single day, so enjoy
---
Firstly, trinkets are a library, you use the CDs and swap to a new one. Having more trinkets with powerful CDs is always good. 
---
Second, the effect is powerful. 1000 HP. Obviously this absolutely shits on every passive effect trinket in the game.
---
Unemployment
---
&gt;Getting spawn camped for two hours is the same.
---
And like I said before, if you were actually reading what I'm saying instead of just arguing against what you assume I mean, I agree that targeted ganking can be bullying. But again, that is barely relevant to your original point about twinking.
---
Yeah, I kind of expected that, but i hoped for a few good responses. Having a conversation on reddit about anything that isn't shallow is like playing russian roulette, but with 5 bullets.
---
Did you miss the part where I said I stopped reading? Lol nobody gives a shit dude hang it up.
---
&gt; you don't even lose anything
---
You lose time, which is a lot more valuable to me in my 30s than it was in my teens.
---
Not a lot if it's just a corpse run or two, but a bigger pain in the ass if the enemy faction is camping an area to the point where you have to go somewhere else, play an alt instead, etc.
---
Idk. PVP servers felt a lot more fun 15 years ago. Now I just look at all the ganking and think "this is pretty dumb". Too much time invested to re-roll on PVE, but hoping that realm transfers come out sooner or later.
---
👍👍👍👍 care to express your feelings any more. I like how diligent you type and how smart you sound.
---
No add-ons! It's a clean slate
---
Blizzard really, I MEAN REALLY needs a wake up call. The whole company is quickly turning from a pile of garbage into a steaming pile of garbage. And I’m assuming blizzcon will be a dumpster fire.
---
This is not something a ST class would complain about anyways...😂

Frostradamus. All done via farming herbs and ZF

I only run with another warrior in my group if they are friend/Guildie.

Lazy "I am a dps warrior only " warriors can go earn some loot.
---
Fuck logic! Get out!
---
Meanwhile - lucky if I get one per 10 nodes, the. Lucky if I get 10 nodes per house.
---
When I’m ganked by high levels I say in my head “well that was unnecessary” then forget the whole thing and carry on, when someone corpse camps me I take the sickness and go somewhere else, there’s no deep meaning behind killing someone on a game, you’re taking it way too serious.
---
As someone who is stockpiling Free Action Pots, you’ve given me a great idea!
---
I feel the exact same way. I've never quit a pvp server, but Skeram Ally has me pretty damn close
---
He's a shaman, which does not have any mind control abilities. He used an OP engineering item:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10726/gnomish-mind-control-cap](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10726/gnomish-mind-control-cap)
---
BiS feral tank weapon is a 500g epic BoE. Nobody is going to pass up the chance for 500g so some random (me) can get best in slot. I will buy it off the AH.
---
Good geared rogue + healer can't do it? 30 sec evasion sounds nice for bosses
---
Click on shop and free transfer should come up
---
Hahah thanks man! We usually are 800 plus constantly booting anyone thats 2 weeks away unless we know they're on a leave of absence
---
Keep contacting them, demand that they escalate your ticket.
---
Frostadamus I think
---
Consolidate all your info and tomorrow do the exact same thing but do not budge on insisting you are escalated to supervisor.
---
 Remember there is literally no proof you did anything wrong as you did not do anything wrong.
---
 This is probably lower employees trying to prevent the escalation to prevent reprimand. Push for days, weeks if yes gotta.
---
I've seen this before. Just light of elune, nifty and go.
---
What up!
---
lol yeah we had striker's mark and brutality blade drop last night which was nice
---
Guess I made the mistake of enjoying something on the internet. I should have known that I was mistaken for being excited about a hobby. I should have realized speaking positively about something is equivalent to sucking dick.
---
My bad.
---
Yes thats what I meant haha. I guess I will try that next time around on my CD. I usually offer my services to my guild first. I wouldn't charge them anyways, but they are usually always very good tippers anyways.
---
Anyone who thinks there is only one good way to do it has forgotten we are playing an old MMO with a huge global cooldown, you could stand up and do a spin between each spell if you really wanted
---
Ahh the joys of World PvP.   Never are they balanced or fair.
---
It’s not that I have to quit, it’s more less I got some unexpected bills that came up the last month so I really don’t have the extra money to renew.
---
As Greenman of the guild Paddys Pub of the server Bigglesworth, I approve this message.
---
I already did! 😃
---
I think there's really two different types of twink players - and you're lumping them both together as one. There's twinks that see the 19/29/whatever bracket as a static hard line challenge to rise to and perform at - much like somebody who would prefer to go for a full completion of Battletoads on NES than spend hours on Skyrim. These people see it as a top tier challenge clear of things like guild politics and legendaries etc. They do it for a perceived purity.
---
Then there are the people, like you mentioned, who are, yes, bullies. They wouldn't stand a chance against those their level or skill bracket, so they gear themselves out and go around WPVP ganking because they won't actually win in a fair fight. I had 4 level 19 twinks chasing my 23 warrior alt through Stonetalon spamming /laugh and /spit and corpse camping me for an hour. Yeah it's PVP on a PVP server, but that doesn't mean they aren't complete dicks.

Your issue here is that you're saying all twinks belong to the second category, when it is clearly not the case. As with all parts of the game, some people want to prove to themselves that they're the best, and some people just want to prove to others that they're the best, because they themselves don't believe it.
---
haha, got em mate!, seeing mindcontrol plays like this always make me want to roll a priest :)
---
I will say there is also alot of incompetent tanks going into higher levels, a chunk of people have leveled as damage spec and might either see it as tedious to change, or then try and tank a level 60 dungeon and have no idea what they are doing. 
---
Forexample despite not being 60 we did sunken temple earlier in the evening, we were two who had never been there, nobody explained what was going on so we just kinda followed along, despite the awkwardness it went reasonably well because we could survive the mobs we ended up pulling extra (for some reason he decided to always aoe multiple big worms and several small ones then only keep aggro on the big ones regardless), however when we hit the last boss he was like "this is the last boss, i need you to nuke it with everything you have as quickly as possible" and i was like "Aight, you da boss" So popped rapidfire and got a proc of imp hawk on, alongside an aimed shot and he lost all aggro in 2 seconds leading to everybody but me and the other hunter dying due to feign death, after which the tank ragequit. 
---
Yes you shouldnt have to "babysit" players, but it seems to me that different tanks tanks in different way, so you cant get mad at people for not doing what you want them to do when they are instead trying to do what the last tank told them.
---
This game is already about dead, lmao. Not even 3 months.
---
yep. it was fairly common for people to get all world buffs and be raid ready and log out right in front of the raid a day before the raid started.
---
Horde did this to the Ally on Faerlina
---
That would just mean more to kill, so sure.
---
Oops meant that for the person you replied to. 100% on the side of a warrior getting the warrior item.
---
Not gonna lie, but your comment was pretty funny. Or maybe it's late.
---
I mean I feel ya but I must say you're still lucky compared to every decent totem slinger on the block dropping 20% of their mana before even starting to DPS on packs of elites.
---
Nah
---
The hyenas in North are also much faster than before. AOEing them is possible, but much more difficult.
---
Where the fuck are all your abilities and spells?
---
I'm ded ty lmfao
---
Kinda glad it isn't viable. Economy is already screwed enough from Mara and ZF.
---
You talking about the nets ? yea that not being in was a pserver thing
---
Which means for the rules of this it didn't change.
---
My meme just got hit with the same rule too. Seems mods are a little overly concerned with meme regulation. The could at least suggest an edit or alternative sub.
---
take my upvote
---
Just dirty mike and the boys looking for like minded guys
---
different quest but the hearts also drop from the big elites.
---
You can turn in the quest. The item link you posted literally states it's rewarded from a quest.
---
I was going to say something similar. WTF is Classic turning into. If this sub is any indication, it's a bunch of min/maxing elitists who never grew up since Vanilla WoW was current.
---
Someone said they wouldn't let a hunter into their raid if they had this sword equipped. What a bunch of neckbeard divas.
---
Hey without playing wow you will make 15 dollars In no time!
---
Whereas horde group gank solos because there aren’t enough of us allys to go around, they have to share
---
So the other guy who got double epic drop was also in BRD....  something is up
---
Seems like it would take forever when you can just run with a full group and get some xp/gold.  Spending money for something for something that might not drop seems silly when you could start your own group and invite whatever class you want and not lose out on gold.  It can take 1 attempt or 10+. What exactly are these rogues paying for each run?
---
It’s basically 1 streamer with a million bots in a botnet
---
Appeal and insist on talking directly to a Senior GM. Regular GMs are minimum wage monkeys who just follow prescribed instructions. A Senior GM will actually interact with you, pull the logs, and investigate.
---
What’s the deal with arcanite reaper? Any reason it has the lowest server population?
---
Tauren warrior I keep seeing. Unstopabull. Not sure if it's in violation but I thought it was clever as hell.
---
How do you deal with the rare spawn in DM arena? It hits really hard and another group will just wait till you get it low and jump you. So you just stand there and wait forever since the first to start it loses?
---
oof. you could have traded that gold for like 800$ IRL bro
---
Strawmanning and vapid platitudes are not responses.
---
I don’t pvp, you dolt. I’m level 45, play healer, and use clique because I hate keybindings. I suck at pvp.  
---
Yet I don’t cry like a little bitch when I play on a pvp server and get ganked.
---
I'd lose the roll so hard
---
Imagine misunderstanding such an obvious statement
---
Benediction checking in. Ahoy m8
---
inb4 this sub turns into r/2007scape and becomes the de facto support channel where you can only get issues resolved and mod responses from highly upvoted posts since normal support channels don't do shit

It's DM:N. Nookie rhymes with Cookie, and we all know that you do it all for the Cookie!

How long do LIPs last? FAPs are great for getting past UBRS campers

You should be fine assuming you have some int/+ healing gear. If you're worried put blessing of light on your party.
---
I did this quest on my warlock and it took over an hour and I farmed a fair amount of a level doing so. On my warrior it dropped off the 4th mob xD
---
The real reason they rushed DrM out.
---
Try their twitter support also. The account is: @blizzardcseu_en. I have seen dealings there also. It would not hurt to try
---
The sleeping Druid one can be solo’d. It only spawns adds if you go along the road. If you stay off the road there won’t be any adds to attack you
---
I'll usually just pass by druids and paladins I don't get a lot of time to play and don't want to waste half of it fighting one person.
---
Check into overheating.
---
Yep, I had a swedish guy in my pserver guild that lived in spreadsheets and was in/around top 10 dps on his enh sham. It takes a lot of effort/time/consumables though.
---
My addon shows 265g for Staff of Jordan on Myzrael Alliance.
---
Why are most of main characters so big at all? I feel like a dwaft standing next to a giant.
---
God, look at all those fucking no-life’s. Like do these people ever work?
---
Does warden staff drop from a specific dungeon?
---
Better to start off as a Druid tank imo.  Easier class to tank with, levels up fast, and you can switch to a healer or DPS if you're uncomfortable with a particular instance.  Sure, you can switch to DPS as a Warrior, but most Warrior tanks will not want you in their dungeon groups.
---
Ahh, the tough shit life throws at you. GL to you and hopefully see you return to Azeroth.
---
As someone who has been reading mtg stuff this title confused the hell out of me.
---
well i mean on average all the bestial traits, like the oens of the druid you posted.
---
only that those are either personal, and/or without context.
---
Thought what i also meant is that all the druids show, msot of times, a good-sided nature and rarely an evil one, even when it comes to killing.
---
Did you say anything bad about China recently?
---
Especially now that you can make 150g an hour on hunters with Tribute runs, it's absurd they would do this. But they have no idea about their own games, anyway. It's painfully obvious.   
---
Tbh, after that bullshit mistreatment, I wouldn't even want to play anymore.
---
Lol then got caught up posting the pic and auto passed. Like he’s in a wow sitcom or something.
---
Thanks a lot for the heads up! &lt;3
---
I like how not a single part of this post actually responds to a single point made in the post you:re responding to.
---
You're not here to have your mine changed. You're not here to have a conversation. You're just here to rant.
---
I mean I have girlfriend, I’d rather have the epic mount then have sex with her once.
---
Considering OP was unbanned you do indeed do dumb shit, like posting that comment.
---
This macro will permenantly enable party pet frames for the character you run it on. The effect is character specific, so you'll need to do it once per character.

By making youtube videos with titles like "HOW TO MAEK 500G/MINUTE!!! GONE SEXUAL", then using the ad revenue to buy gold from chinamen.
---
Good chance other stuff would be affected as well, but there's some possibility that the only time the system accesses that part of the drive that could be faulty is when it's accessing Classic files. Before you run a full ready verify scan (takes a while) you can also check the SMART status of the drive instantly with this utility: https://crystalmark.info/en/download/ . If that tool says anything other than "good" you'll know there's issue with you hard drive, if it does say "good" then that doesn't guarantee there's not some bad sectors and I'd still run the full read verify test with hddscan when you have some time.

Netherwind server: 
---
{Dweeb} 
---
Looking to have fun while making lasting friendships? That is what being a dweeb is about! We have members of every level, at every stage of the game. Looking to eventually raid once per week. If you can't make it, no worries. Most are military (or ex military) and have family and other outside lives. Being said, most of us still play daily, and the guild does daily dungeon runs together. Looking forward to getting to MC as a team. Please PM me if interested!
---
*Will discuss raid times once the majority of us are at that stage, and whatever most members can make*
---
On average they're pretty bad, BUT if done right they're not nearly as bad as people are saying. They won't top the meters, but they won't be under tanks either. Probably in the same realm of hunters in terms of dps.
---
The rejuv is nice bonus threat for you too.
---
Get ahold of someone in &lt;Invictus&gt;
---
Considering 1/3 of classes can literally just walk away from him, I say let the holy man play his game.
---
Problem is, that whole mindset kind of assumes the most perfect, safe &amp; clinical conditions where a tank slowly pulls small packs one at a time and nobody ever pulls aggro ever, there's no additional aoe damage going out, the mobs aren't putting debuffs that onto dps players that you can't dispel (like in my case, poison).
---
This just isn't reality. 
---
If you ever pug, there are going to be unforeseen chaotic conditions. There will be a pat that joins the fray that the tank didn't see coming. You might be doing a BRD run in that final huge room with the torches and the only real aoe damage you have is a hellfire-ing warlock. Maybe you even have a mage that does enough aoe damage to significantly speed up the dungeon and destroy packs in 10 seconds flat, but he'll inevitably pull threat and take additional damage here and there. There are trade-offs to consider here.
---
It's not about what *should* happen, it's about being prepared for what *might* happen. I'm not going to smugly sit there and tell a DPS he shouldn't have needed a fort when I could quite easily have adapted to the situation by doing whatever's necessary to get us through it. I can't control what other people do or how badly they play, all I can control is how I use the tools at my disposal to get through a situation.
---
Pattern: robe of the void ...how much is it worth ?
---
yeah... that's why you were banned /eyeroll
---
correct. Battlegrounds aren't open until phase 3 of patching. Phase 2 will start progress for world pvp, but until phase 3 there are no battlegrounds at all.
---
This is what you get from a company that are bootlickers for an authoritarian communist regime that harvests organs from political prisoners. You think they care about the truth or being fair?

Yes but in game, rexxar is depicted as a large wolf with a low texture wolf head lol. Got a custom model in WCIII and HotS but not here.
---
i dont think that is possible either there are so many people that scan the AH for 1c bids and just bid on everything under the sun that will sell for more than they bid i dont think its even possible to transfer mats via 1c bids

The dude is right there 3 sec away from princess,

This, I’ve heard taking to them over the phone can resolve an issue super quick as they are generally nicer in person not a generic email/reply
---
The 50 Rogue quest was on there too - I totally agree in that most Questie errors have just been having quests show as available regardless of being unavailable due to the current phase!
---
We're talking about mage not locks
---
Only alliance would do some gay shit like this
---
I have not run into any problems with threat yet, i just use holy shock usually with divine favor to grab aggro back if i lose anything
---
Yeah I was wrong. Still cool though.
---
This isn't TBC or beyond. Everyone's on the same continent, running or flying over the same zones. Gankers keep the world alive, by creating reasons to travel the world. Local and Global defense channels are a thing.
---
This isn't Retail. Even low-level players can hurt high-level ones. Even if they need numbers to kill. 
---
Warcraft is a Real Time Strategy game. Except the players are the units. Ganking is a call to arms.
---
No, all i am saying is that running from lvl 60 pvp to avoid getting pwned and wanting fair pvp and ending pwning noobs yourself for the vast majority of time is a ridiculous and hilarious situation.
---
What is that mount?
---
Yeah I'm happy with picking Firemaw. 55% Horde, 45% Allliance.
---
Yeah def wish BGs would come soon!
---
&gt; I'm seeing memes pushing towards 10k upvotes getting removed here on the daily for not meeting rule 7.
---
That's because memes are the pinnacle of low-effort idiocy, and the world would be a better place with them.
---
Lmao, "I should stop tanking for pugs since they wont pay me for it"
---
Population feels great tbh,(I work Eastern and nights so by the time I'm home it's 10ish pm server and I have no issues finding people for dungeons) but since whitemane was one of the original servers for transfers away everyone spread dead server lul bs around and got everyone to believe it. Which tbh was because of people going as soon as xfers opened and wonder why it wasn't as full as whitemane. Or the huge amount of people going oh I'm not going to transfer others will and then we won't have a que.
---
What a good looking guild. Congrats &lt;3
---
I look forward to the days of dishonor points.
---
The bosses hit too hard for a rogue to tank them.
---
Dreadsteed, the warlock-only epic mount
---
Buy the mats, then AH the bar for maximum gold.
---
Meanwhile in Bloodsail Buccaneers RP everyone is making rude gestures at each other.
---
You can go into the library and get the quest without the key, which saves having to run DM East twice. Just go up to the north door and let an ogre kill you (doesn't cost repair bills since you take equipment off), then run back and respawn behind the door and go into North.
---
Lol. Ya they are divas
---
This worries me, i want to turn in for rep but now im scared to buy the runecloth.
---
Sounds like they messed up and don’t want to get caught at this point. Hope you get your account back and then some
---
The worst entitlement is when guildies get mad after like 3 dungeons because hey I promised this other mage in the guild I’d help him do water quest. But dude we’re already in a full group yeh we are but I’ve done 3 things with you in your custom built group to funnel yourself gear annoys me. mind you I’m not getting shit for drops full pbis. So yeh I’m gonna go help this other more chill mage because I’ve spent 3 dungeons in here listening to you felatio your own dps meter every pull.
---
prolly someone on the team wanted more phat lewtz 
---
:P
---
i mean i'm sure thats what happens other times, just anecdotally i wont pick a fight unless someone picks a fight with me
---
If you go in and jump down to the left you get one pack right there you land in. Clear them. 
---
Go along north wall about halfway. Watch the treant pack they get close but if you stay by the pillar they don’t aggro. Move directly south and you can pull a whole pack back to the pillar (where you jumped down) and aoe them down. 
---
Move directly past where you just pulled and you reach another pack you can pull same way. 
---
Now... there are 3 packs on the east side. One Middle East, one a little further south and east. And one almost directly south. You have to time this right but you can get to the east wall in between the Middle East and south east one. Wand the Middle East one and run directly to the south one. Wand them. The Mid East will pull the south east one. Go to the south east corner by the door to the satyrs. Ice block there then blink north along the east wall and do your aoe on them as they follow. You won’t aggro any other mobs done right. 
---
I’m not great at it. I die 50% of the time cause I mistime it and pull treants but I just started. 
---
Then when you’re done you can run along the south wall. And pull the southwest pack.
---
No one can answer this here. It's all relative to your server and faction and the economy.
---
So then a full raid geared warrior going into a bg at level 60 is the same.   How should we be playing the game o wise one?
---
Problem is, that whole mindset kind of assumes the most perfect, safe &amp; clinical conditions where a tank slowly pulls small packs one at a time and nobody ever pulls aggro ever, there's no additional aoe damage going out, the mobs aren't putting debuffs that onto dps players that you can't dispel (like in my case, poison) etc.

Maybe you even have a mage that does enough aoe damage to significantly speed up the dungeon and destroy packs in 10 seconds flat, but he'll inevitably pull threat and take additional damage here and there - I might decide it's well worth healing him in that situation. There are trade-offs to consider here.
---
It's not about what *should* happen, it's about being prepared for what *might* happen. I'm not going to smugly sit there and tell a DPS he shouldn't have needed a fort when I could quite easily have adapted to the situation by doing whatever's necessary to get us through it. I can't control what other people do or how badly they play, I'm also not going to withhold heals from people out of spite to "teach them a lesson" when experience tells me that the chance people will actually take these "lessons" on board is slim. All I can control is how I use the tools at my disposal to get through a situation.

I quit my warrior today.

I’m confused. I see how you spent your gold but not how you made 1800g?
---
I bet they are on all layers doing the same thing.
---
Is it possible to play on one server while waiting in queue for another?  
---
I want to play on a particular server but the queues are always long. (3000 people today when I got home from work)
---
Go to sixtyupgrades.com and create your mage. Then take the stat weights and manually plug them into pawn.
---
not yet.
---
no official word as to when/if they will add them either.
---
iirc they were in classic so they should be - eventually.
---
Pictured is our guild; we have a Screenshot of him finishing it in Dire Maul @ 8:58PM EST. We doin' MC now.
---
This is some ReadyPlayer1 shit.. (the book)
---
Just saw a pic from a guy on my server on his one. Apparently some of the mats are reusable so ask around the other locks on your faction and maybe you can save some gold if you all work together?
---
maybe in the first world 10? 20?
---
Which passive aggressive number does my post fall under?
---
Slightly random: can the opposite faction see your custom emotes? Ie. /e random action.
---
You can see that all the buffs the priest currently has are basicly "just" applied so its probably not the actual duration he can see. he just has an addon that guesstimates how long a buff is gonna last. It doesnt know when fort/motw was applied to it assumes max duration but this is very usefull for buffs that were applied during combat (like the power word shield) since the addon can have exact data on the duration it has remaining.
---
I don't see a jeweler's monarch of deflecting anywhere, I'm so confused!
---
You won't be high enough to follow this. After early Ashenvale you had Redridge and Wetlands, Duskwood. Before going to any of the mentioned zones above.
---
$11?
---
nope
---
They are only selling for like 3-4g above mats price unfortunately
---
BRD mage aor farming, about 100-150g/h.
---
DM lashers, 100g/h now about 40-60g/h later.
---
DME duo farm, 60-100g/h now, 40-80g/h later.
---
DMN solo hunter, 140-300g/h now, 70-140g/h later
---
Just to mention 4 of the 40 available gold farming methods.
---
World drop
---
Apes sometimes refer to themselves as a "welfare guild", go figure.
---
The Devilsaur sheeping was at least "mildly" funny. This is just pointless griefing (and not even effective, considering that it just requires one or two corpseruns).
---
I'm not saying your lying, but your story reads like someone who got caught. You "excitedly bid" after "sleep deprived nights".
---
Lying 101 is exaggerating your situation to get sympathy from the reader.
---
If you are innocent best of luck but seen too many stories like this.
---
Is that a storming Stormlight Archives reference?
---
Now I’m Big Sad, but congrats tho
---
I don't think they are paying each run. I would imagine they pay for the ring and are in until it drops but I may be wrong.
---
it says free character migration while you're in queue
---
5 hours, 5 skins every 12 min. 15g a pop. that's 1.9k gold they stole from devilsaur farmers.
---
Bro...RMT is against the TOS. When will you learn?
---
Went through a bunch of the top comments and no one mentioned that horde could have easily just entered through the Lariss Pavilion doors. That's where I headed as soon as the quests became available.
---
In this game you got pimps and you got bitches. I think it is very clear which one Noobmurderer is.
---
Just got the items and will first take care of my guild warlock buddies, but I'm wondering what would be a reasonable fee to ask for. Any insight?
---
You're not looking for a conversation,  given your "see my response that doesn't actually  counter your argument" bullshit posted to every response.
---
Probably the way to go. Good luck
---
Endless corpse runs = fun
---
That's a niche of a niche of a niche.
---
saw one on twitter earlier
---
He either bought it or he's selling it.
---
Wait so why would you want to do this?
---
Dang hope that it was worth it.
---
All but 3 of my guildies. Out of 10 or so. A few were toxic shits we were glad to be rid of but the rest left when borderlands 3 dropped.
---
I've been running it as warrior with full pre bis (exchanged shoulders and legs for plate), with the exception of onslaught girdle and wristguards of stability. Works just fine, ofc it's tight but very doable
---
On Fairbanks there was an alliance raid and it got smacked down very quickly.  Most of the day it was horde doing the same so I don't blame them.
---
which is why his post is clearly BS
---
Good job dude! I finished a good portion today. Gonna get it tomorrow probably
---
cloudkeepers sell for 3k bet the first books will do as well.
---
^ How I got my lvl 40 mount. Was avg about 10g an hour. And I sold the fishing rods I got for about 1g
---
No one is making that much gold per hour.
---
cause you clearly RMT. You know logs are a thing right?
---
I'm pretty sure I've seen u in chat a couple times lookin to buy Runecloth stacks(I'm Horde on Herod too) bc I recall seeing the same account asking for it and I was like "WTF they need all this Runecloth for?". Hope it works out man!
---
Only with two accounts
---
All my gear is leather and I use 2H weapons pretty much exclusively. Usually a staff. Sounds like your tanks just aren't casting Dire Bear Form very well.
---
Is it worth anything on alliance side?
---
he averages 1.9g per kill and takes more time, its also a bag space issue
---
I feel like shaman isn't a great compliment just because druids don't benefit from Windfury totem
---
Post their exact first email and I can tell you if it is automated or not.
---
I appreciate the advice. I’ll try to make this pulls the way I perceive you talking about them, and see how things go. What about drops? I heard drops are shitty, but than I also heard people say they’re getting an absurd amount of gold.
---
i've had decent pugs.
---
although we'll see what the lv. 60 dungeons are like as i mainly focused on questing.
---
Of the 6 I personally started with, 4 are still here. 2 of them went from “might play a little” to “on 12 hours a day”
---
&gt;pvp at lvl 60 where everyone is more or less equal
---
AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA
---
AHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
---
Holy fuck you are so wrong it physically hurts.
---
You have literally no idea what you are talking about. A fresh 60 vs a fully MC geared 60 is just as bad as a white geared 15 vs a 19 twink.
---
can you read or is comprehension an issue with you?
---
Ha! Well I’m pretty sure the West Coast servers are at their headquarters in Irvine and I’m in LA so I feel your pain! My ping is 60ms on East Coast and 20 on West Coast. It’s not bad at all but I definitely notice it. I don’t mind too much though - gave me an excuse to roll a Horde alt on Grobbulus!
---
&gt; Blizzard's bans are automated,
---
Nope. Not a single one is  "automated". 100% of bans require a human to process. Cool that you defended this RMTer tho.
---
After you mind control, the pet action bar shows up.
---
all of which are private server fantasies and not working on classic or in vnailla.
---
East wing/warpwood is significantly lower than the other 2
---
My mistake, I was actually a necromancer myself and knew so many of the bosses where magic resistant and the few dmg spells chanters got were all magic.
---
Ashenvale/Stonetalon cover to 30.
---
Desolace goes to 40.
---
Ferelas goes to 50. 
---
Sure you'll run out of quests, but that doesn't mean you stop completely.
---
What herbs?
---
You must rise above.  Not going to bother looking back at the exact number response but basically someone having another opinion basically and they need more schooling?  This sounds like you employing the thing that you are trying to fight against.  Not a response to someone because you preemptively did it but basically lowering yourself to name calling because.... someone did that to you before?  Helps prove your point I guess that no one is above that principal so you might as well not fight it.  But this is me calling you out if that helps. That's what you want right?
---
&gt; Did you screenshot your mount before logging ou
---
who cares? RIP RMT
---
What is RMT?
---
Until we get proof of another existing prior, gon' keep the title the way it is :P
---
I see tons of people in SM level range. I see tons of people playing in general.
---
Cost of OSRS subscription
---
Good luck for phase 2, looks like it'll useless tho.
---
The problem wasn't that he bought gold. The problem was he bought gold from a NON-Chinese goldseller. lul
---
Shamans are more than Windfury Totems ;)  Strength of Earth and The Grace of Air totems are pretty complimentary for droods
---
yes lets waste someones time.
---
Dang. I was literally already counting the gold as my mage gets closer to 52...but probably for the best.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
the DM ones have confirmed not the drop rates people were expecting because private servers were inflating drop rates.
---
half ?? Loool dude you are way off the line.Around 10 % are 60 and pre BIS atm. As others ppl said they did it for the streamers and for that top top 1 % (10 %) .
---
And they aren’t and shouldn’t be “banned” either...because they don’t provide any information that a player doesn’t already have access to via the default interface.
---
Wait respeccing is capped at 15g? I always thought it was 100
---
Other than that is there no other way?
---
Ooohhh. This is why some mage was giving away a bunch of it for free earlier. Didnt realize it was "new"
---
Everything in your post is wrong.  Each sentence includes either a baseless assumption, your uninformed opinion, ignorance about the game and it's history, flawed logic, or a combination thereof.
---
Time will tell
---
Work towards other goals and accidentally make gold.
---
I needed items from BRD so I ran it until I got them (mainly HoJ but some nice plate and weapons too).
---
I needed items from LBRS (bow, UBRS gems) so I ran it until I got them (20+ runs).
---
I need a few items in Strath but I quite like the place anyway so I run that a lot too, and the rep is accumulating which doesn’t hurt.
---
Been 60 for a week and I have almost 800g in the bank just from questing and dungeons. Should have my mount in a few days of casual play.
---
Totally 100% necessary tweak.
---
Players back in the day who did do this kept it a closely guarded secret and did not exploit it to the extremes that it was taken to via private server wads.
---
If this weren't changed every "hardcore" raiding guild would require their guild members to farm out 5 copies of DM until the end so they could rush their tanks and melee dps through the tribute portion for each of them to stack the buffs before every raid night.
---
&gt;How many times while leveling did you survive with 5-10% health &gt;party wise and say wow Stam saved us?  
---
vs.
---
&gt;How many pulls while leveling went fine (no one dipping below &gt;40% HP, regardless of pull size or w/e)
---
Is a small ratio. I have nothing against just giving a stamina buff with no question.  But the number of situations where this buff is really helping your party (outside of the tank) is probably not very significant.  It seems really good because you'll always remember the times it worked well, but most pulls it means squat.
---
Take advantage of the situation and walk away from the game for good.
---
90% of the addons should be banned but it wont happen
---
Why do liars always go to this kind of length to deny things?
---
Depends on country and tons of other factors obviously.
---
&gt; Yet I don’t cry like a little bitch when I play on a pvp server and get ganked.
---
Yet again, refuse to actually read do you? I mean do you just look for places to complain?
---
I'm not whining, I'm saying what I think of people who do it. They're allowed to do it, I'm allowed to think it's pathetic. Pretty simple.
---
People who insist on twisting that around to crying about PvP? Well.. that says a whole lot about them.
---
I shoulda had a V8
---
retails levelling dungeons are a blitz. much easier than my esxperience in classic thus far.
---
Gold is BiS for every class. For BoEs, I can understand (and let group members know when I'm leading) that everyone will be needing on high cost items that can be sold on the AH since it prevents ninjaing.
---
Misinformation on Rogue there.  More than half of combat Rogue damage is from auto attack.  They have good sustain.  Dagger builds are more bursty but still great DPS.  Rogues are a fantastic DPS class.
---
Ahem, the many expansions haven't been confirmed for classic.
---
Do you agree that it is possible, in the physical world that we live in, for a person to lack sufficient knowledge or critical ability to have meaningful thought on a topic?
---
 You are not. It is very possible through. Another method to hit 200g per hour is to farm devilsaurs from 2am to 8am.
---
Yep. 
---
Trying to complete a quest in the dungeon? I’ll invite anyone and everyone.  Trying to farm a certain tank item? All warriors and paladins can find another group, sometimes rogues too.
---
Is it? QS is a raiditem as well. Futhermore, its classified as warrior/paladin. If youre a hunter and you need on it, you're a greedy selfserving twat and a ninjalooter. Exactly as it would be, if I need on the leaf. Just because its BOE, doesent mean everyone needs it. You need the gold it can and will sell for, not the actual item. - If I need on the leaf to vendor it, its fair game? I need the gold, and vendoring that shitty leaf is like.. atleast 3-4G! And I need gold!
---
6s...?  Comparable to BoP at any rate, but a truly competent wPvP oriented group like the ones APES can field will be dispelling those off you anyway
---
Everybody I've ever known who said they weren't cheating when they got caught really was

Hi! I previously reached out to OP requesting a recent ticket ID about the issue. Although I won't be at liberty to offering details about the account to the public, I will edit the post soon as I have have confirmed the details and have responded to OP.

Alliance can use the dancing troll village.

maybe when youre younger and care about that shit lol. idk what the fuck the ppl i know are doing and vice versa these days.
---
Google: disable Xbox DVR windows (whatever version you have)
---
Mara farming should be able to get you 50 g/per hour.Dunno how fast priests are doing it compared to locks tho
---
You don't pay for each run, you pay for the ring drop. So it might take a few runs to get it for that person, and you get all the rest of the loot to vendor in the mean time.
---
I generally never upvote or downvote but holy this post filled me with anger. Upvoted for visibility that blizzard is fucking useless. Hopefully someone with half a brain from blizzard sees this and resolves your issue.

Didn’t you spam with your request for cod cloth “free Hong Kong”?
---
Some are.  I have an herbing spot that not many people are aware of that has been netting me 80-100g/hour if I have it to myself.  I go there really late night/early morning and rarely have to share.

---
When I need a break, I play my Mage.  Not only do I get to coast through a dungeon as a DPS, but I'm also making it at least one-third easier on the tank I'm with because I don't fucking pull aggro.  Funny how I can still be top DPS at times as a single-target spec'ed Mage who will not even start casting until 3-5 seconds into a pull.
---
The fact that you bought 250 gradually and then all of a sudden bought 500 and an epic mount and got banned the same day just is definitely a red flag. These topics often are often people just lying about any wrong doing (like how in prison everyone calls themselves innocent...).
---
All I can say is, if you keep pestering them and you truly didn't cheat, then it might work out for you and I hope it does if that's the case, but otherwise you're just wasting everyone's time for breaking the rules and should move on as you'll stay banned.
---
Unholy. Blood is good too.
---
Maybe if we knew what class you were it would help.
---
You’re still bitching about getting ganked. Omegalul. Go play on a PVE server with the other Care Bears.
---
I think he is
---
Which is the idea - if you gank helpless lowbies, then you get to be outnumbered lonely prey.
---
If you don't want to be outnumbered lonely prey, don't gank helpless lowbies.
---
It could have been the range, totem's have pretty restrictive areas and I *think* some are even shorter than others.
---
I can't tell if this post is sarcastic
---
Would you rather pay?
---
great idea!
---
The people who farmed all the materials in advance for today's patch that released the quests for paladins and warlocks epic mount quests are making a killing
---
link?
---
To some extent, you're right, but travel time means that there isn't much reward for a level 60 to maybe come get a fight in in a lowbie zone. I think as the population of max level players grows you'll see this more (it's already more common in just the time I've been playing). I would characterize that as a healthy, pro-social response to the phenomenon, as opposed to the deformed morals of a "I got ganked, so I will now go gank" person.
---
So lashers then? Because the rest are boss drops/gathering and those are 100% unaffected.
---
Also to the people who downvoted me, go learn instead of downvoting correct comments.

You've entirely missed the point of the post.
---
If a mage and level 60 paladin were harvesting your soul at the orchards in HB, that was me. Sorry, I was bored, and it was my only time engaging in such buffoonery
---
Talk little, listen much and just play. The game is enormous. Some of us have played it for 10-15 years. Don’t underestimate how long it takes to learn all the little things. There’s no way to teach someone. Just pic stuff and dot it. Each time you discover a new zone, go to a new dungeon, do a quest, etc you’ll learn a bit more. Of course you’ll forget stuff too but if you keep going you’ll start piecing things together.
---
Nothing is straight forward in this game. Everything is convoluted. Making gold is fine, but you won’t learn much just sitting on the AH. Get out there, get dirty and lost. Fight things. Talk to people. Ask small questions. Don’t try and fill in the whole picture at once, it won’t work.
---
You're kind of boring.
---
Just wondering what the best is, only level 15 so making a new character if Priest is not good is not an issue.
---
there is free char migration in shop too
---
i went fucking hard and tanked to gear prob like a quarter of my servers pre raid bis, always pugging, not judging and dealing with dicks as nicely as possible, then i started getting sick of it because of all the reasons you stated.
---
final straw was probs when i pugged my 50th ubrs and rogues got salty that i rolled felstriker, i was like.... uh... there was no res on run, im tanking this shit for you guys, am i not allowed to roll on pre raid bis fury gear? (im not prot)
---
these days i dont even pug and just roll with my friends, or just farm RTVs. tanking is a stressful role, i DPS too sometimes and thats brain dead, relaxing, and fun. dont get me wrong, tanking can be amazing with the right group, but yeh, 95% of dps i pugged with just dont understand the struggle
---
Please see my response in the original post.
---
Huh... I don't see that at all. In the large image you have of Vol-chan, dude looks about to break, on the verge of tears. I just want to give him a hug.
---
Did you farm the mats beforehand or buy them all?
---
Nothing stopping you from using a fap
---
Many people are. You just lack knowledge.
---
Venruki did 160 gold per hour in BRD consistently for maaaany hours if you want one source.
---
Make sure you ranged pull if you cant handle multiples or use sap.  If you still get multples periodically attack and gouge 1 and retreat and the others will reset.  Kick, gouge and abuse LoS on casters.
---
Do you jave any issues about it? I mean you could just find another tank
---
Think the biggest issue with 5-man Paladin Tanks... is mana. Every. Single. Pull. your Paladin has to sit and drink from 0 to full. No mana means no threat.
---
You play on Shazzarah?
---
Numbers were off I guess. Remembered it wrong as four hours. Was likely thinking of there are 4 spawns. Still thought it was less often than 1 hour though.
---
This is called [training](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Train). It is, just as was in Vanilla, possible to train players with mobs in Classic. I'm not sure about the mechanics. I did attempt this on the open beta, and it seemed the mobs resetting would attack any player along the way that were attacking the same type of mob. Not sure at all if that is the mechanic.
---
There isn't much reward in the game beyond the thrill of conquest. Blowing up a ganker is it's own reward
---
As an Alliance on Skeram, while I respect your opinion on it, I'd take the higher pop any day now. It's a fucking blood bath trying to do anything, not to mention most Alliance have swapped so LFG is dead, and we get camped when we finally do get a group. Skeram looked so promising, and once the census came out, it got soooooo bad so fast.....
---
Naw. Wasn’t you, but there was a lvl 37 paladin that was RP’ing as a mob inside the chapel/building there when you enter it and Aggro the whole place. Was a few weeks ago and I was like lvl 22. That guy needs special treatment.
---
If you’re ever in the position where 15 bucks could make or break you, you should really just stay away from WoW.

If you felt like passing on BoE epics to group members that's on you.  This has nothing to do with "retail mentality."

Effectively what OP is allegedly doing.
---
I have skinning so I farmed the black dragonscales from doing UBRS runs for Briarwood Reed, and I bought the rest as soon as I found out DM and the quest were going to be released soon. Cost me ~200g at the time (75% of the cost being the arcanite bars)
---
Buffwatch. Works with any class. Especially good for paladins, but good for druids as well.
---
It goes for 200-300g on my server I would sell it
---
No, a mentally unstable person isn't inherently bad, that doesn't really track at all.
---
Perhaps if you provided an actual response to it that wasn't an attempt to draw me into the meta-layer weeds I'd be more open to engaging with it, but so far it looks like you're not really interested in doing that. You're doing the noble trolling thing that makes most online conversation pointless.
---
To be honest the only reason I'm still engaging is as a form of turing test, to see if you provide anything novel or just kind of continue the same general responses that most human animals produce to this kind of conversation. I am so rarely surprised, but I consider myself an eternally disappointed optimist rather than a pessimist.
---
I see why people get upset, I was also planning to do some farming myself (never player pserver or vanilla itself) but honestly, I don't see this as a bad thing. I suppose there were never meant to be a gold farminf method like that, even if it was possible in the original vanilla. 
---
This seems just to be the way vanilla was meant to be played, being broke af.
---
&gt;  - Dude, you need the gold the compendium sells for, not the item!
---
So, exactly like you do?
---
&gt; You need the gold! Go farm like everyone else.
---
Exactly.
---
What happened? I thought Blizzard CS was always far more superior
---
Personally, I havent done a single Scholo/Strat/LBRS run without checking with the priest/lock/mage if they need the pattern. - You just dont do that. They were in the group, contributing and helped getting the drop in the first place, so they get prio on the item if they need it. Thats just common curtesy, and a part of creates a decent community. - The other mentality that is being jerked around here, that everyone needs on BOEs, is selfserving and egoistic, and quite frankly, id never play with people like that. Purely because, people like that will fuck you over eventually, most likely first chance they get.
---
lol
---
I got a 30 day ban on my account for using my account from a different location while traveling and with 2 appeals still no change or further review. GG.

Where do I go? I click on shop and there is nothing there to do with free classic character migrations.

Oh absolutely. My rule of thumb is - if everyone’s chilling then let it be, but if you attack me I will retaliate. Let’s try not to grief each other too much :)

There are always three versions of any story.

I think his shardplate is lackluster. Storming fool...

If you’re ever in the position to judge someone who cancelled possibly all their extra services because of unexpected bills or debt? You should stay away from society.

Also on AR. The population is actually pretty healthy. We sit juuuuust below the medium threshold most of the time. On alliance side, it's been easy to find groups, AH moves at a good place and it's an amazing community minus a few trolls.

Ive been playing tank warrior since launch, I am Even specced to full prot since i got my 1st shield But i havent played for almost 3 weeks now, i got really tired of constantly  only  doing dungeons because questing was so bad as tank. I used to play everyday Like 5+ hours But now im so disgusted by Even the thought of playing and leading another dungeon and im not Even lvl 60 yet.
---
I saw this on tv when I was on the phone. My wife was also watching and I screamed out “World of Warcraft!” Everyone else was very confused.
---
Can i get that horse even if i am not a warlock?
---
This didn't age well.
---
From my experiences in support, we were kind of supposed to dodge escalations, which is why you have to be very clear in what you say.  Make sure you use the words "escalate" and "supervisor".  Sometimes people would say things like "can someone else take a look" and issues would be routed laterally.
---
It isn't complaining, it's not being able to play the damn game. Ok so you see one screenshot and all is good? We get camped by this amount of Horde daily on Skeram, and although that's the worst or 2nd worst server, It still shouldnt be ignored and offered a "free transfer" for a fix. They should have merged 2 servers -- one ally heavy, one horde heavy. Now all the Ally left and it's even WORSE... How is 80/20 or 85/15 ok?
---
I’ve been healing dungeons as ret since VC, just healed ZF last night.
---
You’ll be fine, just get a healing set, stack Int and have different levels of your healing spells on your hotbar. 
---
It’s really easy, I’ve never had an issue. There are no ret talents that aid in healing so you healing as prot would be essentially the same experience.
---
This is honestly what I don't get, how do these people have such a disconnect that they can honestly pretend they're doing something *other* than going out to wreck someone elses night for fun?
---
I've said it a thousand times that I fully support this being in the game and accept that it happens on PvP servers. When I roll there, sometimes I get ganked and camped. But I also say that I find his behavior to be pretty pathetic and genuinely sad.. and oh boy do people not like that. 
---
I mean.. what did they think people thought of them?
---
If only mankind could evolve to the level of technology required to deal with balancing realms. But no, MUH SERVER IDENITY
---
you're boring and seem dumber than the dumbest sheep
---
almost like a .. battle for azeroth
---
So you don't want people to call out this kind of behavior.  Got it.  I wasn't trying to troll or anything and actually liked the read until that point, made me think about it at least.  But go ahead and hold your power over the powerless.  Maybe those uneducated people will hit the books then they can talk down to others too!  Still not trying to argue just thought putting that part in about needing education could have been corrected in some way.  Just feels like putting yourself on a pedestal to me.  I thought the post was about everyone being better humans.
---
This is commonplace for blizzard. They decide you broke the rules, ban you, and ignore evidence that proves your innocence. Had this happen to me in the summer. Took 3 months to get someone to listen AND they threatened to terminate my account if I kept appealing. 
---
I won’t be coming back to the game - it was the principle of clearing my name.
---
Well without really any luck as I said about 30g in 3 clears. If you get blues or purples or books obviously that goes leaps and bounds. I’d say 50g an hour without much luck.
---
Haha that's generally how Biggles goes. Mostly big groups of horde and Ally and there is peace but when it goes off it goes off big
---
Lol maybe because I quit reading your pretentious ass post. Did you miss that point?

Also got banned for trading AH. Never bought or sold gold and got banned for a month. Blizzard is legit banning false positives.

---
Amen.  I don't run these dungeons because I get a thrill out of it.  I do it to gear up for raids, because for me, that's where the thrill is.  Counterproductive to bring a DPS Warrior on a dungeon run when I need to roll for the same shit he's rolling on, and there's a good chance he's going to roll for the tank loot that drops as well.  At least with a Rogue or Hunter we're only competing for the DPS loot, and they provide some form of limited CC as well.  DPS Warrior brings nothing but a fucking pair of dice to the group.

He tagged a mob in the guys train and it was close to the other mobs enough to social aggro probably.

Show me a raid without Rogues or dps warriors.

They had to fix this before Dire Maul because overloading the buff limit was pushing world buffs off.
---
Dire Maul brings more buffs with it. You would have seen major backlash if they hadn't.

Hey how about all these people shouldn't have to go this route when they're legit. Honestly how many threads in here and in r/wow do there have to be where you guys have to get paged because of a false positive?
---
&gt;people are playing the game efficiently

They make others do their job for them.  It\`s not efficiency, it\`s being an asshole.

A fellow adventurer! Theres a few spots I can't get to anymore since wall jumping was made incredibly hard in classic. :(

Mind Control has added an entirely new level of gameplay for me. I have so much fun running people off boats, into a pack of mobs, making someone attack their buddy, but most of all, buffing a lowbie that thinks I'm going to kill him.
---
Also nice when a lowbie is being attacked my someone on my faction so I MC him to end the fight. Then I /no the aggressor and /pat the dude I have mind controlled while i run him to safety.

(Then I sometimes go kill them because....balance in all things)

He’s not working for Reddit. He works for Blizzard, and Blizzard is the one that made the mistake. So again, how is it wasting anyone’s time?

Wasted Effort.

DKP is a constant spreadsheet that needs updating every raid kill. 
---
Loot council works if your council is knowledgeable and fair. 
---
With classic, we know literally every piece of gear that will be in game for the next year or two... so a good loot council will hopefully be assigning loot correctly for the greater good. 
---
It’s very easy to have written loot priority to drive council decisions for everyone to see... I.E. mana igniting cord getting mage priority because T2 warlock belt has the exact same stats...
---
No no, there are Asians outside of your country and I think it's offensive you think every Chinese man is living in America.
---
Mind controlling gets you banned? What?
---
In my long history with Blizzard I noticed that it really depends on the GM you get. Many of them are hard working and realize how invested we are in our accounts but there are a few who just go with the motions and cant be bothered with proper GM work. I recommend keep escalating until you get a GM who cares.
---
How do we/you know that’s his alt?
---
Wow, I'm at a loss for words. Consider yourself relieved of engagement then, this is clearly going nowhere. You might want to check out r/iamverysmart on your way out, we plebeians of differing opinion are clearly beneath your grandeur.
---
Here are my points, again, in clear English if you really want to keep riding your high horse.
---
1. A culture of ganking is not inherently bad, and starting your post with the assumption that it is means that you should be ready to defend your assumption.
---
2. Labeling everyone who challenges that as abused is obviously absurd and irellevant, to say nothing of disrespectful.
---
Keep copy pasting your responses all over the thread though, you've clearly thought of everything and us human animals can't appreciate your psychological genius. I suggest next time skipping the post and getting your thoughts engraved on a dildo, that way you can properly masturbate to your own genius and save the public the spectacle.

Yea the fondant decorated to look like skin was better for looking at than eating 😂😂
---
Hes immune while spinning though :(
---
In cases past when there have been false positives, I have been clear and upfront about that. In this case, I will only say that I have already responded to OP with details of this particular account action.
---
Blizzard fucking sucks.
---
Wtf is safespotting in this sense? What does this all mean and why are people saying mind controlling people is worth a ban?
---
So fuckin confused
---
&gt;Maybe you won alot of those 1 copper bids on the AH.
---
Doesn't the default AH (with no addons) sort items by lowest bid price? Putting up your item up with a 1c bid can get it higher up on the list and more likely to be seen if there is a lot of the same item in the AH.
---
It wont get banned. It doesn't go against anything ToS and all it does is scan your combat log and prompts you about others around, which you can do manually by looking at your combat log yourself.
---
I would instantly join this guild.
---
No, they aren’t. Based on the info you provided, you got flagged because the AH activity on your account was out of the norm. The person you replied said they’re basically constantly playing the AH. So them making a lot of bids is not out of the norm for their account.
---
Nice way to put it
---
"no changes"
---
It wasnt in the game at launch, wait until the patch that brought it in.
---
First, assuming where others live is an odd thing to do in World of Warcraft. Secondly, some people (you have no idea who has 'your' name) might consider not giving/making a deal on your name since you are hoarding names others might desire, which someone else is doing and thus leading to your dilemma. Perhaps some other dude wants your random name and he can't even get it with an alt code (oof)...anyways... it's just something you might consider.

Bitches

yes welcome to every class that's not warlocks

The dps mindset is super frustrating to me. I play warlock, but used to play mostly priest,  and people constantly talk about how they can't use voidwalker to tank or are constantly pulling aggro. They are obsessed with doing as much damage as possible as quickly as possible. So I happen to join a SM cath group that was two manning it with a priest and tank. I have to wait a really long time to AOE in this case because as a lock you pull aggro very easily. But I'm not willing to tank the whole pack and nearly die every pull so they kick me out of the group. I would much rather have a smooth fast run than have this mass AOE, constantly pulling aggro meta. It just blows cause if you play more of a slow build you get labelled a bad DPS instantly. I've only died a handful of times in a dungeon because of this but I am concerned about getting this bad label.
---
1. get someone else to pay for you living expenses.
---
2. literally have no life.

3. make money for an 1/8th of weed and 2 $4 combos from Wendy's.

&gt; cause you clearly RMT. You know logs are a thing right?
---
You are not, indeed, a decent human being.
---
I've never been a fan of dps systems that involve bidding.  Every time I have been involved in one it has lead to players conspiring against others attempting to drain them of their dkp for items they want.  I prefer the loot system for the guild to not add an additional layer of competition, personally.  One issue I had run into back in vanilla was players not bidding on upgrades to save dkp, cause they wanted a more exclusive item.  This caused upgrades that could have been helping the guild get passed on to less active raiders.  
---
The worst example I encountered was from a rogue in my guild who was heavily lobbying for dkp bidding in guild chat, so he could never use his dkp and then get Thunderfury eventually when it dropped.  The guild split and he started up a new guild with half the people and had dkp bidding as the loot system and guess what dropped, a Thunderfury binding, and guess who had the most dkp?  He did, and guess who's guild broke up later that day cause he got it, that one.
---
The criticism I would have of dkp bidding is that the item probably isn't going to end up where it will help the raid the most as a whole, the item ends up where it helps the individual raider the most probably, but a guild that is going to prioritize the individual over the group probably isn't one I would want to be in anyways.
---
I too envy those who can live off $80 a month

Warrior is the hardest class to level. But if you’re a good tank you’ll always have a raid spot once you hit 60. Not worth it for me

We are on a transfer server, so lots of people transfered from across 3+ different servers. Our guild has 90+ raiders, we're looking at adding a 3rd MC. We have about a dozen swords between Viskags and Brutality blades, not a dozen Viskags, sorry if that was unclear.

Not since 2002. RC is EZ mode for a long time.

It should still work with mounts the old way! Stand close to a small spot, sit down use a disconnect macro logback in and mount up. Let the climbing begin!

Found the random doubter who will inevitably be proved wrong
---
There is a phone support line, though? It's only open like four hours a day, which is admittedly pretty fucking useless. Unless you mean they specifically won't take calls about account issues?
---
Let me respond by not responding at all.
---
Blizzard are fucking asshats across the board now. Had similar nonsense interactions with useless "support" staff, and then was immediately invited to participate in a survey. The company is done. Classic is the last thing I'll play, and I'll play it until I got the inevitable well if asshattery like OP. Then I'll uninstall and not look back.
---
So im debating folks. Do DPS warrs not take Impale/Deep Wounds due to the debuff system right now? My officer says they dont because he saw a top 50 log and some didnt have it or something. Just wanting to be sure, thanks!
---
clearly you never did it then
---
I didn't know that Blizzard took after the old Runescape style of customer service.
---
Hopefully if they REALLY do, they'll notice you since this reddit post blew up.
---
I got a ban , now removed for buying something for 50g on ah. I had 3g previously but my gf gave me the gold..  she was banned for selling gold..once we had proof both accounts live together they did uplift the ban. but they are obviously not putting In the effort to check up on this stuff. it's all just flagged automation
---
Yes, same problem here.
---
Sounds like rmt confirmed
---
Memories of others completing raid content you couldn't is rewarding?
---
Interesting considering many steamers layer abused for Thorium veins and have 10 to 20 stacks of arcane crystals in their banks. Payo was one of them.

Sounds like China supporting blizzard is mad you didn't buy gold.

You should definitely go Karen-mode and request a month-subscription credit for the time and energy you're having to waste on this.

I'm not being sarcastic. Escalate the shit out of this and make them waste their time telling you no until you speak with someone that has the ability to say yes. Fuck them. This is incredibly poor Customer Service as a paying customer.

---
Why don't you try reading the ToS before spreading false information?

lmao. Yeah, the Blizzard customer support representative definitely shouldn't provide Blizzard customer support when something with the potential to attract the company negative attention lands on their plate. I mean it's posted on Reddit, so clearly it doesn't matter, right? 
---
That's not how any of that works.
---
You've never made a fully geared 49 twink do you don't know the time and resources it takes. It's still hard work just doesn't take coordination with 39 other people.   Stomping white geared people happens at every bracket including 60.

On the off chance we're on the same realm/faction, which race are you and which server/realm?

I fear that WoW is just in a whole different level. No other game I’ve ever played can allow the same caliber of so called grinding that WoW can dish, they somehow make it fun even when it’s not. Don’t get me wrong, it was super fun and enjoyable most of the time. I enjoyed the grind. The social aspects were great too. Since classic seems limited in features, I feel like I can’t be the only one that’s out there thinking about returning to a great, classic game.
---
Also, I feel like I may be looking for validation that I might be able to play in my current point in life without it completely taking over my life. 
---
So are you really saying, that in your opinion, it’s still addictive as fuck?
---
thanks internet stranger for knowing my own life better than I do
---
Stories like this (assuming its legit) really make me NOT want to play anymore, for fear of being unjustly banned. I dont do anything against TOS, but from the sounds of it neither do quite a few other players who get banned. 
---
Of course obviously not all of them, im clearly not talking about those guys.
---
These warrior and healer sob stories are getting really old.
---
Whole Server Tho!?!?!?!?!! They dedicated their lives for this. They gave up pussy for this. They gave up jobs for this. They gave up any semblance of a real life for this.. bow down!
---
First, this is a US server.

Second, you are absolutely right.
---
Third, I love you and have the utmost respect towards you.

Lastly, I hope you have a wonderful day.

Hey how about stop believing every idiot who uses you to try and get away with rmt.

You got banned because you didn't spend real money on runecloth -Blizzard
---
I disagree, mostly because they fixed wall jumping which was a critical part of vanilla for me.
---
I actually agree. That’s why I’m already back doing pet battles and LFR (with my wife’s permission of course).
---
Except they 100% auto permaban without a human looking at it, or just pencil whipping. Like that guy they banned for exploiting roof tops only to come on reddit and admit that they were wrong and never even reviewed if he was there. Or the guy they perma'd for rbg win trading when his character had never once entered a RBG. They later apologized and reversed his ban and gave 1 month free game time. No human ever looked at the case, because no human would be dumb enough to ban someone for rbg win trading when they've never been in a rbg.
---
Lmao not how it works
---
Sure you can! Give up real food, pussy and a future and you too can dominate wow classic!

Recommend using consecration until lvl 40. Than you respec and get down to holy shield on prot tree. You’ll pick up consecration again at 51
---
There are very few circumstances in which a prot pally can tank raid content. Yeah, they're fine outside of raid, but once you cross that green portal you'd better be holy speced. 
---
I'm sorry, but that's just the hard truth about the class. I've seen so many people thinking they're gonna be the next Esfand and show people that Paladins aren't just raid healers. What they don't realize is Esfand has little enough of a life that he can devote his time to maxing consumes to output mediocre damage. I hate to break it to you, but unless you're getting carried hard/in a guild that doesn't care, there's no place for Paladin tanks in raiding.
---
My first character was alliance and I still think of SM as S/M in my mind from that long ass run.

I'd love to hear an update on this matter. Good luck to you, and may your blades never dull!

So, leveling a hunter for the first time. Fill me in on the specs. I totally want to be survival, but don't want a nightmare of time leveling, I'm happy to level as beast master and then change later if that's what it takes. Marksmanship isn't appealing to me at all. Any tips appreciated!
---
Level 47 alchemy level 270 or something and I'm awful at the game :)
---
For this exact reason I quit ArcheAge, I got banned after buying a lot of items from ah for flipping them and it took Trion a month to unban me. The compensation was laughable so I gave away my gold to the guild. Never ever a game with Trion Worlds.
---
Hit them up on Twitter @BlizzardCS. That might get the attention of someone who cares to help.
---
Seeing as the main wow sub has been like this for years, I would expect nothing different here. Araxom is basically your only chance at any customer service if you get perma banned.
---
Hoard or ally?
---
The goat
---
Eh I'm not saying it's never happened but I certainly wouldn't call it common. I've never been in a guild that paid for anybody to respec.
---
Honestly I just wish they'd put dual specs in to the damn game, it would make things *much* better. I'm a rogue, only have one job, and I fucking hate being combat specced. Once the raid is geared enough that it won't matter (soon) I'm getting the hell out of combat, I just don't enjoy it and I have no utility for anything other than "DPS ALL THE THINGS".
---
And who would complain that the hybrid classes can actually, you know, switch roles effectively? Not me.
---
I mean I know it's a US server, just saying many non US play it. We are really just talking about the person who has your name.
---
I can respect you descalating that conversation here, hopefully it's genuine... apologies if I came off extra rough.. just felt like your first reply to me was kind of off base given my point.

Just stay away from LEGOs and Gunpla

Ally mate we have a waitress character in the guild

Can confirm. Escalation is huge in CS.

That's been my main way to get gold. I have been playing the mat game. Buying and reselling cheap matters at a higher bu still reasonable price. Some people just want their mats gone and don't care how much they get and that's how you make your profits. Good old economics.

Maybe someone has to "click ok" but I have seen airtight proof that they are permabanning automatically with zero due diligence. Like the guy who got permabanned for RBG win trading when he'd never been in a rbg. You can tell me is not automated, but if someone scrolls down the list clicking "ban" without doing even a cursory check to validity, I consider the non-automation to be in bad faith, thus it's automatic.
---
Way to reward your most dedicated players Blizzard. Jeezuz. Maybe next time do some investigating before banning someone. Guilty until proven innocent I suppose.
---
Yes.  I don’t eat as much as I used to, stopped smoking and drinking.  I used to get drunk and play shooter games all the time costing me a lot and then taking smoke breaks in between matches.  Now I don’t do any of that in this game because I’m too distracted.

---
Even in the most hassle situation, a manual spreadsheet, EPGP decay is just a matter of multiplying it down by whatever factor you decide on.

Which is one formula that pulls that data onto another sheet in the same format, to paste into the next month/week's spreadsheet.

Little confused what your question is about the increased threat talent. It only affects defensive stance so you can dps 5mans/raids just fine. Tanking without tactical mastery is not as convenient, but its still totally doable (largely it means after you charge you burn rage before you switch to defensive). Soloing you just stick to battle stance, or pop Berserker Rage pre-charge if you want it up. Interrupts suck without stance dance, but just kill caster mobs in berserker stance.
---
Its gona be such a shame when Alex has to retire.
---
It's an idea, but reddit already knows about the issue so idk how much that would help
---
Its a question of how gamebreaking it is. I wouldn't be surprised if people could use this bug to 5 man Onyxia.
---
Its not hard to get a healer at 100% spell crit, tank at 15k HP and dps doing double their normal damage.
---
Because of the Booty Bay teleport, Gnomer is actually considerably more easy for Horde players to attend.
---
this should be the top post, the amount of posts like this is astonishing. Araxom is ALWAYS here and at /wow. Its not good that so many people have to reach social medias to make any noise. Its not good that the guy has to go through this after all he went through to get his mount. This is like taking hapiness away. He could go back and do it all over again but it will never be the same, and why would he do it again?? For me this is absurd. Not sure hos you guys see this but im actually really bummed and im happy nothing ever happened to me (im just the casual anyway, nothing rad going on) but if that happened im not sure i would ever go back. Being theft from such an accomplishment is really something. I can only imagine the soul OP put into doing this. Damn im not angry im just really sad with the world today.

Soy.
---
Well, first of all there are no glaives in vanilla. Second, a well geared 19 in TBC can beat a 70 rogue in theory since 19 rogues can pass 100% dodge in TBC. Third, Rogues use some of the most abusive things possible, especially in TBC like you're talking about. HARP Rogue, Prep/CB, SS Hemo sword spec. All extremely abusive specs.
---
Lastly, it's mindset once again. There is a massive community of "twinks" in Guild Wars 1 that are still active to this day. They stay in the tutorial zone and choose never to leave (you can't get back) and there isn't any PvP component at all. Some people just like certain ranges of a game more. I like early Oblivion more than later Oblivion because of the writing style. People that want to abuse worse off players will do so regardless of the method.
---
Yup you would need to be solofarming. I am just saying that it isn’t impossible to get that ghp.
---
There's reasons for that.  The one I have yet to see, and I know it's possible because I've done in back in Vanilla, is a Hunter who can lay down a Freezing Trap, Distracting Shot a target and lead it to that trap, and then FD/Freezing Trap again.  Hell, I'd settle for a gd Hunter who can lay a Freezing Trap in front of the healer so if the Healer does get aggro from a target it will be CC'ed.  DPS in Classic are just plain trash.
---
The bleed talents are best purely because what else is there. First tier it's either that or 5/5 in parry. For dps that obviously sucks. Second tier is 5/5 tac mastery  then third tier is anger management, overpower crits or deep wounds. I have like 33% crit not even using full bluffs in MC, I'd say that's enough to make 20% extra crit damage worth. But I don't crunch numbers.
---
Hmmm that’s odd, I’ve had an ok time in trade chat (all cities) or in IF general. Also /lookingforgroup (type “/join lookingforgroup” to join it.) When we can’t find a tank or healer I often will do like “/who warrior 32-36” and then whisper the people who come up one at a time to politely ask if they’d like to join. Hope that helps.
---
Something I’ve noticed no one else pointed out, level 17 is not a high level to restart from. Are you planning on leveling to 60? If so, the early levels are the fastest levels to get

To be fair though, I've seen Araxom revert far more false positives than I've seen him confirm a ban being valid over many years on the main WoW sub. The lack of faith isnt unwarranted.

You can duck yourself.

I play rogue and let tank and healer know not to stress my health/aggro in a dungeon. Rogue has a good toolkit to deal with situations. Feint, vanish, evasion, blind. I like to stealth ahead and tag pulls for group, depending on the group make-up it will influence my play. If there's a lot of dps, I'll mark a different target for group and open up on the softer target so I get a strong combo and focus interrupts, easy to escape if dicey and give it up to the tank. If tank isnt comfortable like that I'll hang back a few seconds before opening, or feint regularly. But if rogue is going ham on a target, they have the tools to deal with it. As long as they communicate and patch themselves up between pulls so your healer isn't topping up 2 tanks don't stress it.
---
Seems good that you can "catch a break"but in my experience loot council always end kiss ass competitions and whos better friend gets the loot...Really wondering what kind of guild i should be looking for
---
I'm only 45 on my warrior but I've tanked ALOT of dungeons already and the amount of time I spend running around after the pull chasing mobs to get threat back is insane. I'm getting burnt out at this point. Tanking just infuriates me. Not because I dont like it but because NO ONE will let you do your job. I take my time watch healers mana and try to keep your repair bills low. DPS let your tank do their job dont pull for them and let them get aggro on skull before you go ham.
---
Smack down already came through.
---
Tips on tanking dungeons as feral druid? I've read that it has good AoE threat management, but I'm having trouble. I'm level 33 and just did SM Library. The DPS were 2x mage and a warlock.
---
My team kept pushing me to do big, entire room pulls. So I'd generally run in to a group of 3, get an auto attack or 2 off and hope to get some rage, and then maybe do a Swipe before going to pull another group of 3. I'd then use Demoralizing Roar.
---
At that point, everything starts falling apart. There's so much AoE going off with the mages and the warlock that I start losing aggro left and right. Also those mobs would literally stunlock me for like 8 seconds. I was able to keep maybe half of the mobs on me through taunt and rotating Maul hits on mobs while randomly using Swipe.
---
We never died during one of those pulls, so it ended up working in the end. But it felt super messy across the board.
---
My account was suspended as well for the same reason. When I submitted TWO tickets for repeal the GM warned me that if I submitted another they would potentially ban my entire [battle.net](https://battle.net) account. I've spent thousands and thousands of dollars since 2006 with Blizzard. It really puts a bad taste in my mouth to be treated that way.
---
You’re kind of whiny.
---
So I've made the decision to main a druid for the time being for classic. Thinking towards end-game, how viable is druid for dungeons/raids? I mostly PvE and will probably PvP as feral soon, but for now, I am looking at my endgame as a healer.
---
Will guilds take me? I probably won't have trouble finding dungeons to run as a healer, right?
---
Yeah i don't really mind this fix, i'm just salty about wallclipping :(
---
Would you look at that. A company that doesn't care about human rights doesn't care about its customers either. Who would have thunk?
---
&gt;Wrath == Retail. There is absolutely no Vanilla/TBC spirit in that game at all.
---
I agree. People hold Wrath up as the pinnacle of classic WoW, but it's literally where I got bored and quit. Vanilla had a lot of issues and is janky as fuck (devs not really understanding how to itemize classes, lots of stop gaps or just straight up incomplete mechanics and talent trees) but TBC is the sweet spot for me. It needed some iteration and streamlining, but they took it much too far for my liking with Wrath.
---
Ranting to CS reps about suing them does absolutely nothing to help you. Just continually request an escalation, get references and emails for everything, and carry on up the chain until things are resolved. 
---
If need be you can take all you have collected and submit it to a regulatory authority that helps with consumer complaints. But yelling I WILL SUE YOU just gets eye rolls and makes people not want to help you.
---
I don’t know either. Thanks.
---
Reread the thread to get the context of the conversation you're replying to, please and thank you.

[THIS ONE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aNUuLCWCjbbuB255mDsG47RpT2LU9dSgEMW9kQe9gL0/edit?usp=drivesdk)
---
Back in  vanilla, as an unaware lvl 32 rogue, I went in gurubashi arena and saw a lvl (i guess) 60 mage fighting with all her might another lvl 60 caster (don't recall that class)
---
They were fighting right next to the chest. I sneaked to it and started to open it. And they didn't notice me ! I was gonna get it, the gurubashi trinket !
---
Then I got one shoted by a fire bolt at 9.5s, I was so mad. So far it's the closer I ever got to getting that stupid trinket
---
When i started wow back in vanilla, some random ass dude came to me, opened trade and gave me 500g and ran away. Never got banned but was so hyped with my lvl 23 lol.
---
I did get banned for a week because my character was named Perbert, which I got through their randomizer...
---
Further up looks like a blizz guy all bit confirms they found rmt activity, so no I wouldn't listen to this thread on how to AH
---
I tried this it just keeps recasting AoTM each time I press it. I want it to only activate once If press the key repeatedly
---
The fact that those were even necessary though, man, come on.
---
Everyone has excess to the AH, so that would be one of the most inefficent ways to RMT with someone. It would be easier if the customer sells an item for 1000g and the goldseller buys it. No interference possible. Or you know, just send it via mail.
---
I thought so too but hes saying that in all these logs none have it which is odd to me.
---
But that same loot council would give prio to friends and give Mageblade to only mages and not locks which would suck
---
In a sceanrio with 3 AoE casters and one tank around the same level, there's realistically no way you're going to hold aggro.
---
Sure you can tell them to hold off on DPS until you establish aggro, but within a wave or two they'll go back to spamming Blizzard the second something is within 30 yards. 
---
The best thing you can do is try keep aggro off the healer, and to pull big packs away from the AoE casters. But you won't be able to hold aggro on everything, it's just not possible at that level if people are spamming AoE.
---
Doubt it, in my city we have streets named after Stormwind, Ashenvale, Silvermoon, Winterspring and I think Felwood all connected to each other. That leads me to think the guy who names the streets here plays too. Don't think blizzard paid them to name the streets but I do think the guy who names the roads plays.
---
It's not hard at all, I had it weeks ago on my toon, I just was cheap buying runelcoth, but got my mount 2 weeks ago I think.
---
60 hours grinding a week and you have a job? Damn maybe the bans for your own good.
---
That being said, hope you get it back.
---
You can no longer call support
---
I rolled the class I wanted to have most fun with in all aspects of the game and I’m still loving it
---
How did you survive waiting so long?
---
Or they're just lying because it's Blizzard, a notoriously unethical company.
---
make me
---
Correct.
---
You could do a full run on the Monday, then another full run on the Tuesday after it resets.
---
This is on Grobb right? I've seen the adverts
---
They do it straight to your face every single day. Why not.
---
Can I ask why? For me the game is so much better when im in a guild.
---
Cant call them anymore
---
100-150g on the Yojamba AH. 
---
Can be found for 80g if someone is looking for a quick flip.
---
Why is Blizzard constantly shooting itself in the foot?

Fellow Herber on Kromcrush horde, care to share this route? Been farming azsh for DF, and the black lotus, then doing a loop in fellowood for those plus tubers.

There are plenty of people who have been wrongly suspended or banned

I agree, they shouldn't have, but they did - and I have worked with our departments to help bring illumination to those cases to help prevent such issues going forward. I can't guarantee we're ever not going to make mistakes, but we'll do our best across the board to own up to them when we do. Thanks for understanding.
---
I think I actually added you after a BRD run a week or two ago. We will have to run something again soon mate!
---
Well parry is good to a degree for dps, because parrying moves up your swing time. Which is great when using a 3+ second speed weapon. But also, isn't impale's damage increase only on the *bonus damage* of your abilities? IE if HS does attack+100 and you HS crit for 500 (making up numbers here), Impale would only give you 20 extra damage (20% of HS's bonus damage, which is 100) not 100
---
&gt; being disproved
---
Nothing of the sort happened here.
---
Isn't this just in line with the 1.12 data though? This isn't a private server...
---
What I'm saying is it's exponentially harder to put a combat log in a second window and be scanning that chat window constantly looking for a single line where an enemy rogue stealths while playing the game.
---
I garuntee if you're pvping, grinding mobs or even just navigating somewhere you would miss a rogue stealthing. It essentially removes all situational awareness when playing the game and just let's you stare at an interface until a giant button pops up telling you someone is near, even if you can't see them on your screen.
---
I think it's unhealthy for the game and removes pretty much any element of using the terrain. I understand why people like it so much because it makes things easier for them but they have to see how it hurts the game.
---
You should uhhh. Use keybinds.
---
One of the reasons I have jumped off other MMOs back to Classic was because of Blizzards nearly flawless support system. It sounds like it's nearly as bad as OSRS at this point, which is saying something.
---
Going to get shit on for this but in a multi hour long dungeon that must be run dozens of times for gear, slowly killing 1 mob at a time is not fun. I wouldn't complain if every tank skill generated 3x more threat.
---
If anyone remembers Cata heroics before they got nerfed - I'd love if dungeons were like that. It was the perfect formula of fun and difficulty.
---
Interesting that you were able to match his WoW account with his Reddit account.
---
Threaten a chargeback on you card if you can. You didn’t receive the service you paid for.
---
Uh I did like less than a month ago there's a "phone callback" option when you try to contact support.
---
I thought that was Chen’s Empty Keg II
---
dude, not all asians are chinese. chinese american please
---
So basically it is beneficial to get hit passed 9% hit,  for eg passed 9% hit would Mask of the Unforgiven be better than Eye of rend? I am also confused as to what items i can mix match with.
---
Come to heartseeker, we need more horde
---
You're about to be even sadder. https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/digj3y/-/f3w2br2

Just so u know if you're lying you will burn in Hell but if you aren't since that's the case you want us to believe I hope you get justice and it would seem Blizzard doesn't want your money lol.      
---
How about gold being sent from friends or alts did you do any of that?
---
Hi Razorgore !
---
skullflame shield!
---
Knew it sounded like he gave up and bought 1500gold when he said he “farmed” gold for 900g mount and 500 stacks.
---
Sorry but what do roads and Jeopardy have to do with each other?
---
Ditto, got one first puslin kill after launchl within the hour
---
As a warlock that has been subjected to several healers that wont heal. thank you.
---
To the healers that wont heal a lock in combat. FU.  
---
When I get down to 5% life and 5% mana, guess what happens. No DPS. 
---
The part that annoys me the most, is to be economical, its easier to life tap then eat food. Locks are pretty mana hungry, which basically means, if im not getting heals Im stopping to eat every second fight. This makes a run much much slower. 
---
If youre one of those tanks that tells heals to ignore the lock. You are also an a-hole.
---
Yeah, even at 30-40g/h which is completely reasonable for solo mara farms, you'd get to that amount of gold in like a quarter of the amount of time 'normal' people take getting to 60.  It's not hard, like all farms it's braindead and repetitive.  But that amount of gold is easily obtainable for semi-hardcore in like a week or two.         
---
Dude probably got banned because the bots caught him as 'guilty by association' for buying so much of a common material from *actual* gold farmers, and maybe trading with them if he was doing trade chat stuff like he said.  Like a drug bust almost, he got caught up in a web interacting with sketchy characters to meet his goal.           
---
Which is ridiculous because what he did isn't difficult in a game that can be played as a lifesink.  You really shouldn't have to watch yourself with who you interact with if you're playing legit.
---
It's weird seeing people worshipping companies, no matter how notoriously dishonest and unethical, with a religious fervor.
---
Blizzard support responded in this thread. OP lied and actually did a RMT
---
Just fire off a macro at the start of the run:
---
"You spank it, you tank it"
---
Further up someone with at least half a brain saw it and basically said it's a deserved ban.
---
I lol’d, you’re not wrong
---
Did you gild your own post?!
---
I've seen Dire maul has been released, as it's my first time playing in interested in the patch notes etc is this avilable any where thanks
---
Ironic that you haven't made any posts since your last post.
---
Keeping the pet alive is the Hunters responsibility unless the tank dies and the pet has the best chance of next holding aggro. That said, PW:S may be awful on tanks, but it's decent on pets.
---
So we basically agree then that twinks are people that want to abuse players and search for the best possible way, since at lvl 60 they get stomped by people who really put effort AND people who are actually good at the game. 
---
There is no pve component in twinking decision since you can't pve because you will lvl up. There is just 100% intent to fuck with undergeared / leveling in shit gear people.
---
Keep drinking the koolaid, buddy.
---
Link?
---
The BattleTag is in their screenshot, and they PM'd me their ticket ID#.
---
&gt;no this is me saying blizzard has no customer service or care for it player base
---
Activision literally chopped half the CS department last year.
---
Now World of Warcraft active subs have tripled since July.
---
Blizzard doesn't have adequate customer service. That's a fact right now.
---
Its 2g man.. who cares.
---
Sounds like a wonderful bunch.

I usually take the path from southshore and run along the lake in arathi and then scale the side of lorderon to get around the east side of uncercity. From there you'll be far less likely to get gabked than running around the west side of lorderon. Takes a while, but most people don't have the wpl fp at that level

Biggest factor for raid tanking is imp shield block and defiance.  Get those and for the most part you can main raid tank just as well as someone deep in prot.
---
Remember he is allowed to discuss a false positive, since no action are done to the account, but he is not allowed to discuss Pending or guilty cases.  
---
Unless the user expressily says it, he can't say "Lol I saw the proof, you goofed hard dude, we no reversing that ban".
---
[🦀We did it reddit🦀](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/digj3y/warning_banned_for_buying_500_runecloth_stacks/f3w2br2/)
---
Blizzard: no bots allowed
---
Also Blizzard: uses bots to ban people
---
Yeah, basically people not doing their jobs or doing whatever the fuck they want, and then putting the shit on you. I blocked an entire guild because they had 3 members in a pug and all 3 were terrible. They were a little underleveled but I was trying to help them out. This was in SM, and not one of them were attacking or snaring runners, all of them kept AOEing as soon as I pulled, none of them would focus down the dangerous mobs (one of them actually seemed to make a point of not attacking skulls when I marked them), and when we got the endless adds because of them not dealing with runners, they made no attempt to cc them (poly, root, snare, whatever).  
---
I ran SM 3 times last night as dps and spent my time focusing on hamstringing runners and dealing with wizards/healers and it went super smooth. The one time I tried to tank no one was doing that and it was awful, so I swapped and let the paladin tank while I dealt with the mechanics of the dungeon.  
---
And I know this will continue well through the harder dungeons, where repairs cost a lot more and where people are even more emotionally incapable of dealing with feedback (the reaction of these kids when I sat down and typed out what they were doing wrong before I dropped group was ... predictable).  
---
Luckily I have a good guild and I've been friending good players as I level, so I should have a good group to draw from, but I can totally see why people would stop tanking. The game isn't fun when people refuse to play it right but also blame you for everything that goes wrong.
---
Excuses. There is less than 10% difference between MC and pre-bis dungeon gear, some of phase 1 prebis dungeon gear will last until NAXX, so don't give me that kind of crap. If you can't pvp properly in pre-bis gear it means you're not good enough and you turn to twinking just to stomp ungeared scrubs while being at the top of the food chain.
---
Yup, OP deleted his reddit account too lmfao.
---
OP deleted their account. RIP sillykitty69
---
You can't target a stealthed rogue just because an addon detected him.
---
That's just excuses. There is less than 10% difference between MC and pre-bis dungeon gear, some of phase 1 prebis dungeon gear will last until NAXX, so don't give me that kind of crap.

No, I'm not sure how that happened. Fixed it. https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/digj3y/warning_banned_for_buying_500_runecloth_stacks/f3w2br2/

OP was lying, they actually were RWT. They even deleted the post now
---
You really need the full improved blizz otherwise mobs get to you too fast. With full improved blizzard you can Frost Nova, get two full bliz channels off then Frost Nova is up again to cc everything again then finish with another channel or arcane explosions.
---
 The hardest part is simply finding mobs and gathering them together to start the aoe.
---
This user has deleted their account.
---
I would think OP tried a con and got owned.
---
I'm also not posting sob stories on reddit needing justification or proof though am I?
---
Aaaaaaaand it’s gone. OP got caught out. Can’t dig yourself out of every hole
---
I've never seen Araxom discuss a pending case. Only a response asking for a ticket number and a final follow up, which we can all take to mean this dude is guilty as fuck.
---
Streamers do it so the sheep follow
---
Faith is a stripper with a good heart just trying to make ends meet as she studies neuroscience to try cure the disease that killed father.

But yeah she sure loves to get high.

Well, Araxom pretty explicitly said "I'm always very clear when there's a mistake, and in this case *I have no comment to make*". Now OP has deleted their post. You tell me.

Uwooo, is that a volcano in your pocket, Raggy-sama?

Nah OP deleted their post, so blizz actually are right here.

When you have a dumbass kid and you tell them not to touch the hot stove, you stop them the first couple times they do it.  Eventually though, you let them touch the hot stove and burn themselves, and they stop touching it.  Some of these DPS just need to die, a lot.
---
Yeah, basically he can only say "this has been dealt with" and either "yes or no to false positive". 
---
But for all we know, the true issue might have been botting instead of rmt!
---
it's a bicep bro..
---
The census is more than a month out of date and not accurate at all. I’m horde on Kromcrush and it’s basically a circlejerk. I don’t even gank Alliance anymore because it seems so unfair and I don’t want the remaining few to transfer off.
---
Îdk buddy, looks normal to me. It's 5 am and we had a server restart.
---
I feel ya man. It's so fun to aoe on a priest for some reason
---
How was it nerfed?
---
If you’re going to charge for tanking you should have decent gear for the instance and know it quite well.
---
You can probably find takers either way, but aside from anything else if people are going to buy your services you should do your best to provide it at a quality level.
---
I feel like the meth tweaker mentality has ruined more than tanking, it's leaked into every cooperative game. I can't play a game and look around at all, or sometimes even pick up loot, without falling so far behind people that I have to push to catch up. God forbid I hit a mining node or skin a monster.
---
Druid healer is viable and variety in healers is good for large raids. 
---
You want my advice, go bear tank. It might be different on your server, but on my server good tanks are extremely rare and the most looked for class in LFG.
---
Currently playing. It's not addictive at all. In fact it's quite frustrating and I find myself taking breaks of 3 to 4 days just to stack up rested xp. 
---
Almost lvl 46 Warlock on non pvp server. I'm also in no rush to 60 as pvp isnt released at the moment

Capitalist would be if he bought some alchemist character accounts, let other people grind and make the pots and do the selling and took 70% of the revenue.

damn. they probably hoped we'd assume it was censorship 
---
That is extremely annoying. I am not happy with Blizzard right now, not at all. But I also hate everyone that tries to fake a narrative. Those people aren't helping they are just adding excuses
---
I think 4-6s
---
You could use this exact same logic for talents and item stats etc
---
You’re the one who said there is *airtight proof* that permabans are automated. Not me. Burden of proof is yours.  
---
&gt; You’re not being intellectually honest if you don’t think false positives happen.  
---
Please cite where I said false positives don’t happen. I said permabans *aren’t automated*.   
---
&gt; When they happen, these canned emails confirming the ban always happen. Then when a person actually takes a few minutes to look into it, they apologize and give game time. It happens every day when you have xx million players.
---
You’re the intellectually dishonest one here, stating all of this as fact and claiming certain things - canned emails - happen *every* time when you have no proof whatsoever that it happens every time, or even a majority of the time.  
---
You’ve shared none of the *airtight proof* you claim to have. You have no records documenting every ban that blizzard hands out. So you can’t possibly support or prove the statements you’re making.  
---
Swing a miss, dude.

I'll ask, what's RMT?

Get it in the top right from the Forsaken in the tower near the exit to Deadwind Pass.
---
I believe it's called *And Nothing But The Truth!*
---
just have your shit raid leader set the loot threshold better...
---
true, because no one ninjaed/lied in vanilla....
---
I think at some point they fall off. Partially because warrior solo questing can be a lot slower, partially because competing for raid tanking is hard, and partially because tanking for pug groups can be one of the worst experiences in gaming.
---
For me, I don't take aggro off any DPS if they take it from me. I just assume they can either nuke it or use survival skills. If the mob goes to the healer, THEN I'll take action
---
At what devilsaur leather price?
---
you will be fine... they won't ban you for no reason
---
Thanks man
---
No way the internet only allows facts to be uploaded to ot
---
Depends on you're definition of "hard" and "easy", but many many people argued that Classic would be too easy compared to retail.
---
I did this bc solo gold farming is hard enough as a warrior in general. speccing fury helps. trying to gold farm endgame with sword and shield and prot talents blew. and cost to repec...  nty
---
this time around I rolled 2 wars and if/when they get to max I'll have one for tanking and one for dps
---
ive got probably 27 hours so far to get to 18. Its not alot of hours but I don't want to restart either lol
---
Real money trading (buying gold essentially)
---
Keep trying this amazing line of logic it's surely working wonders for you, along with OP who deleted his account rather than fess up
---
Legendary
---
It’s feasible, but I don’t know how you can drop down without aggroing something on the main level. If you aggro as you fal, you have approximately 2 minutes until the entire upper level comes down to kill you.
---
I use the MSBT floating combat text addon and you can change the size, colour and location of the text
---
well i'm a night elf so i have small improved stealth, but i don't take stealth talent.

you should be able to pass them with invis potion
---
Today no pitchforks were raised.
---
How? They sell all the trash?
---
Yeah, you're not going to get any evidence from Blizzard's side. Araxom's statement there is really the strongest I've ever seen them make in a case like this. It's pretty unambiguous.
---
The real tips are in the comments.
---
Grof, Bird of War and Orc Warrior if &lt;Daymen&gt;, Grobbulus Horde checking in.
---
&gt; But for all we know, the true issue might have been botting instead of rmt!
---
Doesn't matter what it was, OP is a piece of shit for trying to play the sympathy card to get unbanned when he was guilty. I love a good GM smackdown.
---
Naming characters has always been one of my favorite parts of WoW, and seeing what isn’t already reserved on a server. I got quite a few I wanted and will level most, but the only one I’ve ever deleted deliberately was Notretarded because I realized I really didn’t want to waste a strike on something that stupid.
---
What addon is that?
---
If you accept the limitations of the class — in that you won’t top the DPS charts, be the MT for every raid encounter, or *immediately be the best raid healer — you will love being a Druid, and guilds will happily take you. It’s a very diverse, rich experience — leveling and raiding as a Druid.
---
* As you progress through raids into AQ and Naxx, you’ll become a top healer. Druid gear scales incredibly well.
---
A guy named "killingjack" and another guy named "jackkilling" both doing it lol...not even transparent

Actually blizz’ support system wasn’t at fault here. The user did actually buy gold in this case

&gt; ok

That literally just says "deleted."

"Person says thing" isn't overwhelming evidence.

Well...I said it.
---
Lasher farm is alive and well, if you know what you’re doing.
---
Ahhh that makes more sense
---
I had the same issue, should've just gone horde shaman tbh
---
what is rmt?
---
don't get it, someone explain pls, why did they run away?
---
r/iamverysmart
---
Agree. That's why I like some speed runs in BRD - mobs are low level, deal close to no damage, you can just cleave then with 2hander and have fun.   
---
Sunder armor imo is the most unfun skill in the game - you use a skil that deal no dmg, you feel no impact at all, rest of your skills aint better, revenge hitting for less than you white hits ect.
---
That seems to have fixed mine. I had this issue after I transferred realms after playing on another one since launch. not sure why that would have triggered it.
---
I try to adjust to how the healer's mana is going. If the healer is dropping too low each pull I'll swap out to more armor (or go sword/board instead of 2h depending on what we've been doing). It is weird to me that someone wouldn't do that, healer mana is the primary factor that determines how fast you can run a dungeon.
---
This shit was in vanilla. When are you getting banned for being woefully ignorant.

thats why i picked a completely different server
---
That is quite an absurd accusation given how bidding on 1c auctions at the AH actually works
---
So it would fit Blizzard monitoring this.
---
Bro they know what they getting into when selecting Pvp realm. Alliance and horde are at war, it kinda makes sense to sabotage one another by slowing down the rookies.
---
Yah the point though is there's also no good evidence from the now deleted account. So far as I can tell they were just trying to ride the coattails of controversy. And like you say, Araxom is at least attempting to be clear. 
---
Again, I am really fucking pissed off towards Blizzard, they have fucked up very badly. But that does not make me automatically believe the OP that has now deleted their account.
---
Well it’s about 200 hours to 60. And I assume you’ll want to play past that point. I’m not even 60 yet and rolled two alts
---
DKP had so much hassle (from officer POV) from monitoring the points, decay, value, etc.
---
Not to mention raider tend to bank their DKP for BIS item only, causing this awkward moment where they could get an upgrade but refused to use the point, but you cant throw away the gear because technically its an upgrade for him, this is a headache for the officers.
---
If you trust your officers, loot council is always better and quicker, but ofc some guilds focus on progression while others focus on loot for the sake of getting loot.
---
Top teir players wouldn't pay 50g for this item.  It's absolutely dog shit for TPS.  Mirahs song is a MUCH better tank wep than this sword

The entire point of World PvP is wasting someone else's time, so I guess yeah.
---
You want battlegrounds, not a PvP server.
---
PvP servers and Ganks come hand-in-hand. 
---
You get ganked not for "no reason &amp; no gain". 
---
Being ganked delays your progress, the opposite faction doesn't want you to progress fast. Being ganked frees up more spawns for the them, allowing them to quest/grind faster. Heck you might even leave the area completely, which leaves more for them.
---
Does **Don Mauricio's Band of Domination** not have SP in the Phase we are in?

---
Every piece of gear gets replaced eventually and it's worth like ~150g on most servers. Using it and having to not replace it until you're clearing MC each week is great, you don't have to worry about running a dungeon 80 times to get another piece.
---
APES has a bunch of people who are on welfare, who've been grinding non-stop since 60.
---
No shit you’re in a guild that can’t clear Mc- you have brain damage
---
It’s why I play...
---
I jsut play on an alt
---
Orb of shadow will increase in price when BGs hit, espically on normal servers. 
---
Felcoth and mooncloth disparity is just there because of the 4 day cooldown. Moomcloth will become more expensive as more priests get their epic chests patterns.
---
you can pretty much play it on a gameboy
---
how good is cruelty?
---
it seems a bit meh to me. i  don't see how an extra 5% chance is that noticeable...
---
Instead those 5 points can go into 3/3 imp TC and 2/2 imp charge? 
---
Especially when you are pugging the majority iof the time. 
---
Thoughts?
---
Ditto. Im not sure where this mindset comes from either.  Wasn't this widespread back in vanilla or tbc.  And for this item? A clear bis tank weap and grps are not gonna let tanks need on it uncontested if they need their weapon?  Kinda mindblowing.  
---
  Good luck pugs.  Ill be one less tank you'll be finding, have fun waiting. Guild runs only i guess.
---
OP BTFO'd
---
You dont have to heal. This happened on my warrior while questing because some dude ran past me with a pack of imps on him. He got away then they all jumped on me
---
I logged on just to reply to this 13 hour old thread, but yes, I agree. weird experiences. Here's my strangest:
---
I'm nearing the end of my feral druid pre bis tank gear grind. All I need is the girdle off QM Ziggy and Hide of the Beast for my chest. I log on and the first thing I see in lfg channel is a group looking for a tank for QM Ziggy farms, they have a mage for water a priest to heal and a warlock for summons. Wow! I must have had some good karma that day because I even let them know it was the perfect group for me. We start going and I am LOS pulling but the lock is dotting everything like it's Christmas and he's trying to flaunt how much money he has. All the mobs start looking at him and so I'm not getting the rage for my swipes and there is no other major aoe threat taunt or ability.  
---
I mentioned that I should be getting a good swipe or two before the dps lays it in heavy and thick and am met with silence and things run just about how they were. Granted, no one died but the whole time the warlock was tanking more mobs than I was most of the time. Because we weren't wiping or dying I didn't complain or mention the aggro situation any further. It was even a very fast run, we got to Ziggy and downed him in about 30 minutes, even taking down Voone first. No belt dropped and it was time to reset and the lock tells me "sorry but you're just not good at holding agro and it is too frustrating to play with you" and left the group and then it disbanded. That about sums up my tanking experience.   
---
Luckily I have a decent guild and I enjoy helping other people from time to time grinding out runs targeting one or two bosses. I've done countless angerforge runs, jed runs, emp runs, arena runs, MC attunements, ony attunements, but then when it's time to get that last piece of prebis on an obscure boss mob I am forced to pug it, and it honestly just ends up ruining the mood when I have experiences like the one detailed above and lately I just  go level alts instead.
---
Haha thats true,you have to remember we are playing the latest final patch in classic wow:) they added things like this over time
---
This. Play as much duels against as much classes as possible to get a feeling how much energy you need in certain situations. Engage every open world pvp fight to get experience.
---
As a healer I find it mind boggling that there are healers out there that wouldn't at least toss you a renew/rejuv after healing the tank.
---
It's like a gcd and a tiny bit of mana to keep things moving that much smoother. I wonder what their reasoning is?
---
Chad guild
---
"with no consequence"
---
Horde questing is raptors from 1-60.
---
Report them, terrain manipulation is one of the few things you can be punished for exploiting. Even on a PvP server.
---
i don't get it whats so game breaking about it. all it does is save 1 healer for ressing so that people dont have to corpse run.
---
I appreciate the detailed reply.  Will I be able to see the number of "layers" on the realm select screen?
---
Well everything that led up to retail in the game wasn't in at start so why shouldn't they add all that since they obviously intended for all those things to be in the game?
---
This is why we (Horde) hate the alliance. Weirdos everywhere
---
if you are twinking, at least be honest with yourself. Say it loud: "i'm a bully and i'm proud".
---
K.
---
I'm a bully and I'm proud.
---
..
---
Now what?
---
Precious moments from your mom's basement.   
---
Brush up on your reading before calling people brain damaged. I didn't say can't. We don't have enough 60s yet. 
---
Let the salt flow, neckbeard.
---
I did this one yesterday, grouped with one other player and prepared for one hell of a grind.  We got it our first kill.
---
For fucking reals. My savings deposits have doubled the last 3 Checks
---
Well you cant really reserve a boe world dropm thats jist absurd
---
Real money transaction. Op paid for gold
---
Am healer main, I never heal pets unless as you say they are tanking or they are about to drop dead and I have the excess mana to be helpful. Other than that its not my responsibility to keep your pet up.
---
brah what? 
---
Im getting 200ms to an East Coast server from Sydney, works fine. 
---
Back in vanilla it was 500+
---
that came later, and mods can't remove entire accounts. So it does seem likely my initial suspicion is correct and the OP was trying to bank on current outrage and bailed out be cause I'm not that smart and am definitely not the first to call their BS out. 
---
Again, Blizzard really sucks right now, but this whole post is very likely bullshit.
---
They were 50g yesterday I checked this morning and are now 100g RIP
---
I’m happy for him.  Every trolls goal is to upset the person to the point where it ruins their day and they post about it
---
He won
---
absolute madlad
---
Yeah, and that's like over $2000 real world dollars of gold there, so he's out some serious cash here.
---
lmao he deleted his reddit account
---
if thats not admission of guilt i dont know what is
---
Yep. As a druid tank I tell people, "let me have two swipes before you start dps. And if you are going to pull aggro before I can get my swipes I am going to just assume you want to offtank whatever you pulled"
---
You are lucky.. since release I played 11h everyday in average. I don’t know why I have to go all in.
---
And a bicep.
---
Oh YAWN.
---
I actually looted the Dark Whelpling before getting the quest drop. 😂
---
Thats how I feel too! Had a tank tell the healer to stop throwing renews on me last night.
---
im like... the fuck... note to self: never run with this tank again.
---
Probably closer to 3k earned in ZF then, if you watch his vods he had his first time in ZF at 4500g ish, and the last gold from 9000 to 10000 he mostly herbed as far as I saw, helped alot that he got 9 black lotuses :') Anyway, I guess it doesnt matter how much he got and where he got it, he achieved 10k gold with various methods, and we all know ZF is a great farm. Herbing is also great but I mostly do it at nights when there are low competition.
---
(Watched a bit through his vods now and he does all types of farming, some felcloth in feralas paired with elemental fire, felcloth in azshara paired with herbing, lots of time in burning steppes, lots of time in hearthglen)+++ the list goes on :')
---
Im seriosuly contemplating deleting a 34 orc lock, just so I can hang out with a couple bros in good shape. Nothing sexual of course
---
Alliance lick balls
---
2 questions:
---
I just started, having only played about a decade ago when i just spammed the free trial over one summer. 
---
I'm creating a tank paladin, i'm level 19, i've found lots of guides online my first question is  is there a specific order that I should put my talents into the appropriate trees? or does that not matter at low levels.
---
My second, is there a guide or setup that explains proper spell rotations to maintain threat and max dps?
---
Our server has a 1500 player queue as a result of DM releasing. Obviously people wanted this.
---
&lt;Upside The Head&gt;! Ftw!
---
the game also wasnt balanced as patch 1.12 at launch either, this is one of the stupidest things they didnt include
---
Definitely! Haven't been buying console games day 1 and instead waiting until Black Friday sales
---
IMO it's worth keeping an EPGP system going even if you aren't using it to distribute loot and I ran one for months this way.
---
It really is useful to keep track.
---
I was hoping we left "no homo" in 2010
---
In a year someone will still be level 39. Can't wait for everyone to get there. That's how they design retail.
---
Just got done tanking sm with two mages that would AoE as soon as I got to mobs and shaman that spammed earthshock on CD, not a fun time.
---
What can mage skin in zf?..
---
Thats a bad loot council and you should leave the guild immediately if you notice favoritism. In your example that doesnt make LC bad because it can be abused, its like saying putting loot on master looter is always bad because the lead can take all the items.
---
Exactly right. Tanking is just so rough this time around. For game that was praised about community, the scummy mentalities recent have been rampant.
---
What fucking dead ass server is this?
---
Many people are legitimately pissed at Blizzard right now. Makes it easier to rile people up and start mess just to pile on.
---
it's a dildo. Of course it's company policy never to, imply ownership in the event of a dildo... always use the indefinite article a dildo, never your dildo.
---
You can probably play on low settings just fine, however you may want to look into something with a little better graphics processor.
---
Never hesitate to put someone on ignore based on a single interaction of this nature. It makes your entire gaming experience better. Same goes for reddit or any online interaction. Blocking people is usually the best solution to idiots on the internet.
---
The bracket conditionals are tested in order.  
---
So on your first line, it checks if you're holding shift.  If you are it ignores the rest of the line and casts Renew at your target.
---
If you're not holding shift, it checks the second bracket on that first line (@mouseover,help,nodead), so it would cast Renew at your mouseover if you're moused over a friendly, living target.  
---
Try this:
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /cast [@mouseover,help,nodead,mod:shift][help,nodead,mod:shift][@player,mod:shift]Renew(Rank 7);[@mouseover,help,nodead][help,nodead][@player]Renew
---
Homoginzied? No way.
---
Blackmouth and Stonescale are used by alchemists, not cooks.
---
STV is pretty good. So are Tanaris and Desolace.
---
This was a lot of fun to watch! I checked it out a few days ago. It's fun seeing people suffering through group content drama lol!
---
Of you bring DW to a raid where bosses can only have 16 debuffs....you in trouble.
---
Both firefin snappers and oily blackmouths were (things you get in STV)(when I was fishing for dollars) a goldmine on the AH
---
I have a Nature resist ring that is like plus 11, Is that gonna be worth more when AQ and stuff drops. or is that amount too small to really matter?
---
Thanks man, this table is is exactly what I was after. I'll give it a proper review.
---
every server and both factions do this
---
Where can I read up on raiding content? 52 spriest on Smolderweb by the way.
---
noobmurderer is guildless lol
---
bruh
---
&gt; because people excuse it rather than deal with it.
---
No.
---
The person that was 10 levels above me, he either played more,  played more efficiently or both.
---
People ahead of you will block your progress.
---
The more geared/higher leveled opposite faction will slow you down by killing you. The better geared DPS/Tank/Healer will take your slot in the Dungeon/Raid. They will pump in more money which will inflate the economy, making you meager gold worth even less.  You see how they also "waste your time" by making it less efficient for you indirectly?
---
This is an MMO, progress is power, and time is the currency.
---
TBH though all these issues piss me off when I'm a DPS or Healer as well..... not really a tanking issue per se. I'm sick of the randomness of pugs...sometimes you get an awesome group and sometimes you have a pack of retards and the group falls apart wasting a good 1.5 hours of my time....
---
Interesting how this popped up a little another ban was confirmed as legit on another thread and the poster from there deleted their reddit account
---

---
Because DKP is stupid
---
\&gt; But even with the most complicated rolling system, it is far from fair.  Someone always gets screwed by RNG and someone gets way too lucky who  doesn’t show up to raids. 
---
Dice are fair. The RNG isn't out to get you. If you have people who don't show to raids, either exclude them from the roll or exclude them from your guild.
---
You might as well just jump back on that H train. There’s atleast help for that addiction.
---
Ye.
---
2hand fury is a thing for horde, you know.
---
No but this is awesome. I ran past a female tauren druid the other day that was jumping and exiting moonkin form to get what looked like a height displacement to get in the top part of the island in BlackRock mountain. Started sniping people from there too.
---
Only made it to level 46 before they started rushing content. Ceeeebs.
---
On H or A?
---
&gt; What makes more sense, someone selling it for a few hundred gold, or you actually using it as it's one of the best tanking weapons until AQ.
---
If he needed it, he would already buy it. Obviously it makes more sense for everyone to roll for the gold for it.
---
Hello!
---
I am new to WoW Classic, but certainly not new to WoW.  I am looking for a "serious casual" moderate-to-large sized guild of adults.  I am a dad and work full time , so I am looking for folks of a similar cut (family-friendly).  I am by no means an elitist, but I do like folks who take things serious enough when raiding.
---
I am looking for a NA Normal or Normal-RP server.  While I would prefer Horde, I would consider Alliance.  I would very much prefer a guild that has a substantial member base that is still leveling and will be for the foreseeable future, so that I have folks to play with.  No use being the lone lowbie in a field of 60's.
---
Ally
---
Lashers + Satyrs. People are grossly overstating how "bad" it is. Yeah sometimes you don't get stuff. Other times you get several greens and herbs worth a decent amount. Then you kill two packs of Satyrs and I've gotten at least 1 felcloth every run. You can do the entire run in 10 minutes. There are so many idiots that rolled mage and literally don't know how to farm outside of what they see on a video. So when a pserver video doesn't line up they give up and complain. Mage is the new huntard.
---
Tell that to all the Naxx guilds that ran Fury Warrior DPS with deep wound.
---
Not great = best option until TF or ZG is released??
---
Haha what... this is literally what I used for our Guild... I changed mine up a bit though..  
---
 What up! We’re a few cool guys looking to raid and do dungeons in our party guild. Nothing sexual. Tanks and Healers in good shape encouraged, if you’re a hunter you should be able to find humor in the little things.  Nothing Sexual. &lt;Tucking Fitties&gt;
---
I think its pretty clear and obvious they mean world first in terms of Classic and the content being "relevant" once again. There is a first for everything. And this is the very last "world first QS" we will ever see. Regardless of how unimportant or minuscule u deem it to be.
---
I recommend buying a more powerful used but refurbished notebook. 
---
Also I highly advise against playing wow at work because this can cause you your job and is a alarming sign of gaming addiction.
---
Damn, I'm sorry but you must have bumped into some shitty people. Anyone who gives me free water or mana pots is instantly my new BFF so I can't fathom why they'd treat you like that. 
---
Hope you find some better people to run dungeons with mate.
---
Warrior is the most interactive class, with the most things to do in combat, aside from rogue. It's slow and boring to start, but it definitely picks up.
---
My problem with my druid seems to be the effectiveness dog my healing. I have downranked heals on my bar and some decent healing gear. I'm lvl 47 with 30 in feral and I'm working on the resto tree now. 
---
 But it seems like after 6 or 7 decent heals I'm oom and I have like 3k Mana. What am I doing wrong lol
---
Wow I can't believe that actually worked, would have been so useful to know earlier.
---
Something with a dedicated graphics card new will be $650-700. Used you could get it a bit cheaper. The Asus K570 has the GTX 1050 for graphics and runs about $680.
---
They really need to do something about orcs and mounts. Make them bigger or something.
---
Is it not the best tanking weapon until ZG or you somehow get TF?
---
Wall jumping/cliff walking was patched before the end of vanilla so this isn't unexpected, although disappointing and a lot less fun
---
I've seen a few people with follow-up posts to this kind of shit stating that their accounts were reinstated. The only OSRS-related ones I've seen were popular streamers / ironmen / etc... who I'm convinced (but not confirmed) get some sort of special attention. 
---
It's *almost* 100% of the time.
---
Thank you for this!
---
Free stuff! Cool I'd totally want to meet (and marry) (rich)guys who give me free stuff too! (NVM that I'm a guy...)
---
There are green rings with +20/21 so ur ring is not hat high imo. If you want to invest in AQ stuff already gather some elemental earth
---
I level each toon myself? Pay for enchants myself, same as a 60 would? What are you getting at?

Wow I can’t believe you got 3 Dense Stones out of that! You incredible...
---
i've reached happyness for the first time in a long time, i feel like thats a pretty hard to reach place
---
Melee weapons are incredibly important while caster weps are stat sticks so I wouldn't say it's comparable.
---
But yeah, I've seen 60s with that dagger :D
---
Yeah no. They're saying the same thing.
---
50/50
---
Yep i like doing this out of nowhere with grps and see them getting super nervous for a second and then realising something is up!
---
Yea ok valid points but have you thought about all the money their shareholders are making? /s
---
I had one drop during the AQ gate event in vanilla, but it's going to be a while before we get there.
---
For one layer.
---
Vanilla world first: figure it out for yourself and achieve it before anyone on earth
---
Classic world first: stick to the guide and zoom through the steps as fast as you can
---
I dont get it
---
You do realize in the last month or so I've personally seen at least 2 or 3 of these threads make it to the top and then the OP get unbanned.
---
Like imagine unironically defending shitty blizzard customer service.
---
In Everquest we called them Trains!
---
Ah ah ahhhhhhh
---
I've already been through 3 shitty guilds with crappy loot councils or other systems and just now hopped ship into a DKP guild. I'm already behind on loot from those shitty guilds and lower in the DKP rankings, but most others in my class already got a decent amount of gear so I can see myself actually benefitting from it especially if people want to save up. It also keeps good track of who is actually raiding. 
---
But yeah if course people are going to bid on what they want instead of "the greater good" but seriously why is that even such a big deal especially now? This min maxxing shit is becoming too much. WoW classic is not a hard game.
---
Yessssssssss. It's absolutely ridiculous like they're like 56 and aggro from 30 yards away
---
Those damn fields
---
Not a good look.
---
I know right! Imagine the tears 😭
---
levelling a shaman alt, put 5 pts into enhancement shield spec but now realise I am going resto with a buddy - should I spend 5g and respec? or will I be fine as is? (he'll be tanking as a warrior)
---
A warrior won the rare pally mount that deops in dm, nice
---
touche.
---
so maybe a few runs and a bit more gear before i do so XD
---
you sound sooooo sweaty
---
I bet you eat rocks.
---
I'm going to preface this by saying that it's literally been years since I've futzed around with casting macros, so take this with a grain of salt.
---
It sounds like you're over-complicating this right to hell.
---
&gt;If no mouseover, casts downranked renew on target. If no target, casts downranked renew on self.
---
This right here is just how healing spells work, you don't need anything special other than the mouseover modifier to override the normal functioning.  So give this a try:
---
`#showtooltip`  
---
`/cast [nomod] [@mouseover,help,nodead] Renew(rank 7)`  
---
`/cast [mod:shift] [@mouseover,help,nodead] Renew`
---
That SHOULD do what you want it to do with the minimum of fuss, but like I said I've been out of the macro game for a very long time. And I don't play Priest, so you should shift-click the renew ranks you want because I have no idea how the syntax works for them.
---
How come when ever I ask for help, advice or god forbid gold. I get sworn at, blocked and added to 'hate lists'.
---
&gt; given you have already shown a propensity to use multiple accounts in the same thread to give the illusion that people agree with you
---
That's just because of the 10 minute timer.
---
Had to change IP address too.
---
&gt;baseless accusation
---
It's literally a 5-second google search, the posts on Blizzard's support of the PRC were on THIS subreddit.
---
Also, for example:
---
Person A is a pathological liar.
---
Person B says "maybe this person isn't to be trusted just because I'm an indiscriminate consumerist."
---
That doesn't *sound* baseless, but, then again, I have the burden of knowledge.
---
But for the record, Hitchens' Razor; I didn't even need a basis in the first place.
---
&gt;GM who literally has logs

They literally said they have logs.

But I actually have access to far more pertinent  logs [here.](https://imgur.com/yyfDGkA)

you get 20 energy every 2 sec, so when you open on a mob/player, you wanna be as close to getting more energy as possible without going over, so you wanna try and open in the last .5 sec, which basically gives you 20 more energy from the start
---
np good luck leveling! I found dungeon runs to be the most fun because grinding mobs on a priest gets really slow at higher levels. Groups are always looking for heals.

Deadmines has tribute buffs?

This is really great! What happened to the arm of the girl on the right??
---
What I saw happening thousand times was when the pull is over and everybody has no mana a warlock life tapping while the healer starts to drink, never eating or drinking himself.
---
What level of fish can I catch at different levels of fishing skills?
---
Is there a correlation table I can look at? 
---
I'm level 52 hunter. I'm wondering where can I catch some fish for my level 52 cat .
---
Blizzard used to ban people for doing things like this.
---
Yikes the salt is real in here
---
It is.  You can't backstab with a sword.  All the kids these days want you to do combat swords.
---
How is classic easier, isn’t it supposed to be the same?
---
Your post implies you believe they'd be capable of tuning level 60 raid content to proper difficulty. Are you?   
---
I totally am not.
---
Which specs in particular?  Who wants a warlock, druid, or hunter dps when warriors get to use deep wounds and rend?  Or when rogues can use deadly poison and rupture when they have extra combo points?
---
Making arms viable isn't really something to get excited about.  Warriors already have good parses in raids.  Druids (balance and feral) aren't going to bust down meters with their dots.  And warlocks don't need dots to hit high dps, they just need gear.
---
Ok but QS is cool looking
---
buy wow tokens from blizzard does not break the ToS, while buying gold from other "sources" does you should re-examine your values
---
It's a safe run to fpp get the wpl route which you'll need later anyways so might as well snag it because he's got 10 levels in sm to go at least.
---
Nope!
---
You mean exactly what this guy did? Please don’t reproduce.
---
For pve combat tends to be better especially because end game has some really kickass swords you can use. However I believe if you have nearly the best gear you can get in your slots, the seal fate build has really good crits that slightly out damages combat but I’m not 100% for that because I always did combat
---
Yeah now warlocks and hunters continue to dominate the economy with Maraudon.
---
I find it impossible to play in moderation. "1 week" of intense play during launch (i planned to go slow afterwards) turned into 6 weeks.
---
I got mine for 3g on the Sulfuras AH Horde side. It was the most expensive one.
---
graphics card requirements are the newest though. tried on a 2008 mac desktop and the 3D graphics card needed replaced (not a tech guy) something like that. i think 2015 or newer is safest at least for macs but i’m not sure tbh
---
But what forest? The only options is to go through the 50+ plaguelands, or go between undercity/brill. Unless you mean to run all the way around brill?
---
Its because they have nothing to lose. 
---
You put hundreds of hours into this account. Might as well spend 30 minutes making up a sob story and hope Blizzard can't prove anything.
---
You can kill him in less then a minute if you were geared right.
---
Hijacking this comment, is it viable with a prebis druid and healer?
---
Oh yes, finally I am able to use Rend, a DoT that scales with literally nothing and barely does more dpr than heroic strike ( which disables glancing for your next aa mind you) and can't crit! /S
---
Go assassination with 5 points in combat for crit and a few in sub...  Rest in assassination.  Crippling poison and stunlock all the way.
---
You'll still want to open with a cheapshot on almost everything except a mage.  Unless of course you can sneak up on someone healing in the back that doesn't expect you.
---
I assume you're talking about pvp.  If you're talking pve I'm not quite sure.
---
Are you simple? If every piece of gear was BoE everyone would be doing things differently I guarantee it.. Your making up things to try and justify w.e it is your thinking.
---
instead of these random varietes BFA should have united horde and alliance and made the burning legion/naga/dragons etc all unite as an opposing brand new faction.
---
I keep the pet up when I have mana.  Having a clutch off tank still breathing beats a wipe.  Tank gets priority then myself then the could be tanks before the dps.
---
I haven't spent any money at the bar since the game came out lmao a
---
This WoWhead guide might be of some use! [WoWhead Pet Guide](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-hunter-pets). What I took from the guide is  
---
* Only the Beast pet family is tamable as other pet families have not been introduced yet.
---
* Scaling has not been introduced yet so you may only tame a beast that is your level or lower.
---
* You cannot tame a beast that is a higher level than you are.
---
Broken Tooth is a level 37 beast, so aside from being a sought after pet, there is no reason in my mind that, as long as you are level 37 or higher and able to make it to the zone that beast spawns in, you would be unable to obtain it.
---
Ok thanks daddy
---
He’ll do a chargeback like the dirtbag he/she is.
---
You cant tame pets that are a higher level than you.   That being said,  tame him when your at his level so he levels with you.
---
Don't macro weapons into stances without modifiers. So many people recommend it, but I think it's just not good, unclean.
---
Nothing about Battle Stance makes it a 2h stance.
---
Just use separate buttons to switch weapons or you need extra, redundant stance buttons that also switch weapons. Either way you want it is fine if you have the buttons free.
---
The ideal stance macro to do this on is one that casts Overpower, not charge.
---
A lot of these stance-switching buttons are just gonna result in redundant buttons where a stance conditional macro would only use a single button (shield bash/pummel for example)
---
&gt;-This is my all in one attack priority button while in Battle Stance.
---
Don't use these in general unless you want to play on your phone.
---
What absolutely any warrior should do is bind their main stance keys to macros that can't recast the stance you're in, since classic will let you do this and dump all your rage otherwise.
---
    /cast [nostance:1]Battle Stance
---
etc. I don't think there's any argument about what Berserker Stance should cast in Berserker Stance: Berserker Rage. It's the standard stance dance macro and has been forever.
---
For Battle and Defensive you should choose any other stance-exclusive ability you want. Disarm or Shield Block for Def, Charge or Overpower for Battle.
---
I think this was the best answer.
---
I ended up doing laps of Thousand Needles for 2.5 hours mining. Vendor trash, smelt the bars, leveled Blacksmith, AH'd everything when all was said and done. Turned about 15G at the end of it all.
---
Just looked up how to get Steel. I feel like an idiot for AH'ing all my "leftover" Iron but w/e we're here and I'll farm it again. Gonna start questing again once I level out of Steel.
---
My dad plays retail on his 2013 macbook
---
Join the horde and alliance, add in a new faction of united bad dudes we've fought with 4-5 new playable races.
---
It comes down to economy; Everyone is so freak rich in TBC-Cata.
---
This is classic everyone is freaking poor.
---
Once you hit 40 - mount - 90g
---
Once you hit 60 - epic mount - 900g; then you have your craftable gear and enchants which is another 1,000g worth of grinding to sink into.
---
All of the pugs that I've joined I've seen everyone rolling need for all good blue+ BoEs.
---
Seen this in Incendius, too.
---
nice... yeah i’m not sure what the cutoff is, for sure i can’t on my 2008. rip
---
Thanks I didn’t know that.
---
&gt; Who wants a warlock, druid, or hunter dps when warriors get to use deep wounds and rend?
---
Hunter traps, warlock health stones and summons, druid brez.
---
Not everyone wants to play a warrior, you know.
---
I personally don't care whether they change the debuff limit or not but saying "Who wants this this this or this" when the answer is quite obviously: People who play those classes
---
That sounds about right, if on the high end. Definitely not anywhere near 800.
---
What is the point of doing #showtooltip?
---
I've been playing my warrior with similar macros minus the #shpwtooltip with no problem
---
Problem is trinkets and weapons mostly, but there are also shaman healers. Mostly the trinkets and weapons are an issue.
---
Thanks for pointing that out and ignoring your deep wounds talent.  Which does happen to scale.
---
If Blizz roll out the xpacs there's an end in sight with cata though
---
Have you ever played a healer? 
---
No you don't need to be full Mana, but it's all based on group composition and how good/geared they are. And if I'm buying my own water I want to get the most for my money.
---
It does take a long time to regenerate Mana if your drinks are low level/you have a high Mana pool.
---
5 seconds of drinking is just as useful as 5 seconds of you eating. (It doesn't really change much).
---
Why are you only blaming the healers/tanks? DPS players can also be bad too no? Dungeons can be fun even at a slow pace.
---
We're healing with 2005 game mechanics with 2019 play styles. And they don't mesh well. Lol
---
Good to know. I usually ignore firefin snappers
---
In a group with several frost mages and another aoe capable class, you really have 2 jobs- bunch enemies up initially, and be prepared to stun/bash enemies getting too close to your dps.
---
You generally want to bunch up multiple groups as quickly as possible. to do this you have to know which enemies are melee and which are ranged, and good spots to duck around a corner to pull ranged mobs and group them up. As a druid, you have an advantage over warriors and paladins in that you can use rank 1 moonfire or fairy fire to pull enemies at range, which makes this easier. 
---
Let yourself get hit a little but not too much- just generate enough rage for a bash and maul. don't waste rage.
---
Mages will then start blizzarding and using nova to hold enemies in place. Just keep a look out for enemies that get free and be ready to growl or bash them to buy your mages a few seconds to get their blizzards off and reposition. 
---
If you play it right you take almost no damage
---
The consequence is a ban...
---
Report them, glitch areas to pvp are bannable
---
It shows the tooltip.
---
If you don't name an ability it also changes based on the conditionals for what it's actually going to cast.
---
im getting the same,  and on east coast.   I got 200 for west coast back in the day so the NBN has helped... slightly.
---
And dont lie, we'd only get 500+ when playing on EU.
---
Unless you were on dialup and not ASDL / Cable,  or your internet connection was being utilised by your entire family at once that is. 
---
But i dont need no macro to get instant hits,   use a swing timer,  hit mortal strike just before it ends (as we would back in the day) and bang,  double whammy.
---
I presume this macro is to help people local to the server, with a ping of under 50 to where the forced lag emulation really fucks with them.
---
Take off the rose-colored glasses, grandpa.
---
People were worse in vanilla.
---
I feel bad for the reddit users who gave the cheating little shit silver,gold and even platinum awards,
---
&gt; I prefer Vanilla.

I'm so sorry ..
---
He reminds me of the magma guy from Mighty Max
---
Can you link those complaints?
---
Made a really good friend there, and gained quite a few levels , and now im sitting on a mount and 250g at lvl 47 so I'd say that a couple days farming there was pretty damn worth it.
---
This is what I want to know! How did OP know that was the mage’s alt?
---
This. 
---
We used to use Mage detect magic for a second marker. Usually the sheep.
---
Thought you said damage meter. I know they can put out mad threat
---
UPDATE: Because I know this guy personally (sadly). He was banned for purchasing Power Leveling. LMfaooooooooooooooooo
---
Serves you right, dude.
---
It's official, you're an idiot.
---
You cant actually finish that many runs in 2 hours though so it doesnt matter
---
Oh awesome thanks so much !
---
Ahh ok thank you
---
This has been fixed.
---
I got banned for 48 hours in BC for PVPing on a PVP server. A mage was AoE farming mobs I needed for a quest, so I kept killing the mage until they left the area. I raised hell on the forums and everyone told me I was full of shit. Sure enough, I got the ban lifted. False bans do happen.
---
There's another way to play priests? Shadow all the way, every day.
---
i have fuzzy memories of doing coirnav with over 100 people.. the under water raid boss. terrible
---
As long as they aren't in combat or nearby
---
just realized you could probably pretty creatively grief some open world boss encounters with this mechanic.
---
A warlock was already removed from the duel tournament and I cant figure out why. He had almost full felheart and would have almost certainly won
---
Arcane explosion will knock them out of their stealth and reveal them as long as they are in the blast radius.
---
College students were born after 9/11. Only 4 when WoW launched.
---
You do it then.
---
He’s level 37, so you must be at least that level.
---
Been doing 3 man til we get more gear. Highly recommended. Just have a miner and herb. An enchanter would. At even more. Got 2 hunter books a forors and a pally book
---
You need a good chunk of gold. If you're gonna try to control something like devilsaur leather you've got to be willing to invest in the high hundreds if not a thousand gold on the effort.
---
Best way to farm gold as a disc priest?
---
I've heard mara, but that just seems like such a drag. (Ya I know gold farming isn't supposed to be fun)
---
It happens with demons as well. I've seen mobs run past me while i was quasi-afk chasing someone only to turn in my direction after the initial target has had their combat reset.
---
I’m in Fight Milk on Incendius
---
As long as you are doing some dungeon runs this is a fine progression
---
Buying from other sources is not just buying from farmers though, in vanilla/bc/wotlk era before authenticatiors a lot of gold came from hacked accounts. I don't think it'll be prevalent now with these security measures but if they find a way hacked accounts will be back to fuel the gold industry.
---
Yeah, exactly what this guy did. Oh wait, no, nothing like what this guy did.
---
yeah this is my life's experiences exactly, don't rely on other people.
---
Trebek is probably a rank one glad
---
Classic is fine. It's the fact that people are so much more impatient now 15 years later. We're so used to instant gratification that nobody wants to wait 5 sec for the tank to get aggro.
---
I was wondering if there was an add on like this.  I wanted to use it for Gankers and mob hoggers.
---
This took me about 300 hours to do. 24 hours is clearly the nerfed version.
---
These sorts of posts are getting out of hand
---
You can ride a bee?
---
Meanwhile in New Zealand...
---
I was going to say there had to have been some threat charted somewhere because mobs just zoom past me to get back to their path.
---
Trust me when I say you do not want a 300 dollar laptop. Yes it can probably run Classic WoW. But it will make browsing/using more than 2 applications hell. Do a little extra work for a little extra money and buy a factory refurbished laptop for 5-600 dollars.
---
Ok?
---
It seems my blades weren't sharp, and my mind the same. The swarm of kobolds come to claim my name.
---
Guess I got the update i was waiting for! Rip OP
---
Makes me really want to play as each character escaping the stockades, finishing with escaping stormwind
---
Nice horrible unsolicited work advice.  Some people have jobs where they have a lot of down time and keeping boredom away is a big deal.
---
Yes. Because blizzard said whay they were going to do with talents, items, and stats, and they said the keyring wouldn't be available at launch but would come with the first patch. Nor reason to believe it won't be in ph2
---
Solution! Tank appreciation day once a month! The first Friday of every month is tank appreciation day.
---
Celebrate by giving your favorite tanks gifts! Gold,  special items, matts for their professions, gear, fun little gag gifts like alcohol or pets!
---
Give people an incentive to tank!
---
If the pet is tanking yes
---
&gt;do I dare return and put a few hours here and there in classic? I wouldn’t dare touch retail ever again now that I have a family to take care of
---
You got it all wrong.
---
It is not retail that will would be the addiction.
---
It is Classic.
---
That's why I don't like to tank anymore.
---
I wish
---
A game that was pretty challenging to run for its time.  That laptop will probably run under 40 fps which imo is unacceptable.
---
I'm an alliance fanboy from vanilla. I love paladin. I played horde because some friends I know wanted to play horde.  
---
None of them play anymore.  
---
Luckily I've found and joined a guild of fairly cool, like minded individuals so that I could continue playing my Horde priest. I definitely did not want to reroll Paladin and start over so my other option was to just stop playing altogether.
---
Reserving it means Master loot the entire run, it's gonna be slow and painful. Unless you have a dps lead that you trust and pass put loot as it drops.
---
Found a random ironhide devilsaur while in ungoro, killed it solo then got told I tagged someones mob so he camps it waiting for me to loot it so he can skin it. Lvl 60 mount gonna take a few years at this point.
---
Blizzard said to me it's like having dbm for raids. It's not going to be removed, so you better be using it
---
mid 2012 Macbook is the cutoff.

all of that ss was low iq and the last line was just screaming I’m a boomer
---
actually it's been 7 weeks, EU release was only 4 weeks prior to the DM patch - and of course players leveled much, much slower in 2005. So for 99,9% of EU players, Dire Maul was an instance that has just always been there to go to the moment they reached a level to do east (ie around 55)
---
The trick is to not do anything that generates threat. When you see it happening just stand there until the mobs reset.
---
I remember using EPGP back in the day and it actually kept a record in game of your EPGP score (So you could tell who is highest, ect).
---
If an addon could run this and intergrate into the game, this would be epic
---
You should be required to tank before you get a DPS license.
---
It takes the minor speed enchant and the sprint ability or the sprint trinket, so yes, it is hard to reach! Totally worth it though.
---
I mean I was with ya right up til ya took a dump on Wolf’s Head Helm. Is it a stupid mechanic? Maybe. Maybe not. But it is Vanilla. What else do you want to see changed? #nochanges dawg
---
Agreed.  These arent edgemasters, if anything this mentality just fucks over tanks needlessly.
---
Not to be morbid, but he's not going to retire. He's going to die in his current position.

enhancement healing is fine as long as you have the gear for it and know how to heal
---
I've heal'ed MC in enhancement with some minor difficulties.
---
All dungeons are fine.
---
Classic doesn't offer you many different ways to level your characters. There's 40 zones and some are faction exclusive so sooner or later you will find yourself doing the same things.
---
Skipping Barrens is a really bad idea but if you really want to be in Eastern Kingdoms right now then grinding in Tarren Mill is your only option.
---
"Streamer server"
---
Streamers probably make up 0.005% of Faerlinas population, if even that
---
Hahaha oh man, I can see some people being offended by this but I think it's true. I'm a lady and when I started playing I was talking about it at work and learned that like 4 of my coworkers (all guys), that I have worked with for YEARS, have been playing WoW forever. They had never mentioned it. It sucks that it's cool for girls to play video games, but nerdy or lame for guys. They're fun and they are a valid hobby.
---
I ain't mad. The moron I replied to was assuming he was making big $.

Nope. Each attack has always consumed a charge regardless of a second target.

&gt;And if I'm buying my own water I want to get the most for my money.
---
Why make a huge wall of text and argue when your whole argument is "I don't want to spend gold." I mean its a perfectly valid argument, but just say so.
---
&gt;Why are you only blaming the healers/tanks?
---
Because the healer/tanks that make posts to whine on reddit are absolute trash and trigger me when they spout nonsense.
---
Hillsbrad Foothills.
---
But thats the point of the PvP server. To pvp . Idk what did you expect when u picked that. And losing time applies only to you . Its not lost time when you are having fun. If you dont like pvp just dont pick it . Its simple really.
---
Why would you take 2h spec as dw fury ever
---
&gt;without stealing someone’s potentially only shot at a piece of gear.

Wait what?

If you can make gold another way, why can't the other guy make gold another way and buy that boe off the auction house?

&gt;join DKP guild
---
&gt;start at the bottom of the totem pole

&gt;get gamed by the core raiders who are already stocked up
---
&gt;guild disbands at BWL cus they can't clear the suppression room
---
sure dkp can be okay, but I would be more concerned about finding a good guild, period. DKP is truly the system in which you are most likely to get screwed over.
---
I guess I didn't answer your request, but seriously, find a good guild that you enjoy playing with. if DKP is important to you, I will simply add that DKP is overall an inferior system in terms of fairness, and when it is done as well as it can be, the inner core has complete priority over members on bidding.
---
Eyy!
---
Nightfin soup is used by many healers and casters for raids.
---
Lmao as if anyone in their right mind would transfer to a server that's 90-10 alliance.
---
He might have been pvp flagged and the other members were not.
---
I've run almost exclusively with loot council guilds since TBC onwards and had little to no problems with it. DKP drama killed 3 guilds I was in during Vanilla by unfair distribution of points, giving excessive bonuses to sycophants and family members.
---
Assuming you aren't lead by corrupt fools, loot council is the way from my experience. DKP is too much of a game, and it distributes loot unoptimally for long term success. What makes the most sense to me, is to funnel items where they get maximum yield, which in turns allows for more gear to be obtained more easily as time progresses. Our guild runs a mostly preplanned ruling on who is receiving what, so you can set your expectations accordingly. I'm not gonna see tier pieces for a couple of months, but once its my turn, I'll be swimming in it.
---
And their fans make up a.large portion
---
To work cross faction? It absolutely is.
---
It does though. All ingame assets (each piece of gold, every character made, each account and everything in the server) is blizzards property. Buying or selling either, is like using someone elses property to make a profit.  
---
Thats the difference.
---
People need to sign a contract saying they won't lie before given internet privileges.
---
What an idiot...
---
Fight like a crow!
---
I sadly can give no numbers. What I can say is, the most efficient leveling style I’ve used on my mage(who has been 60 for a couple weeks), was to quest and grind. Do quests with a guide if you need help being efficient. Aoe grind when it makes sense. 
---
Lots of mobs who aren’t ranged and packed closely? Get some aoe xp. Maybe stick around until other people show up. 
---
Certain quests that ask for kills, maybe stick around and grind extra if they’re humanoids or beasts and you are a skinner. 
---
Do your quest chains to get every dungeon quest available and do said dungeon and complete all said quests. 
---
I had a bit under 7 days played on my mage when I dinged 60. Not a very quick time, but not horrible. I wasn’t specced for aoe and not once did I go into an aoe spam dungeon group. Not fun imo. I like wpvp and questing much more. Single target frost spec can still aoe great. Frost nova &gt; flamestrike &gt; CoC &gt; AE. Works a charm.
---
    /cast [mod:shift] !Aspect of the Monkey; [mod:ctrl/alt] !Aspect of the Hawk; Raptor Strike

Best you can do, as both abilities are on the GCD. Hold shift and press hotkey to switch to AotM, then just mash it without shift to RS. Hold Alt or Ctrl and press hotkey to switch back to AotH.
---
gdkp =/ dkp
---
gdkp is when you bid using gold and the gold is distributed at the end of the run.
---
Are you referring to solo-farming dungeons or the actual end-game raid content? From what I've heard, pservers over-tuned the raids compared to Vanilla.
---
Yooooo is join if this was skeram
---
Your post is textbook toxic behavior.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Yeaaa cross-faction collusion actually is against TOS...still though my answer is ‘why’d you roll on faerlina if you wanted to have a true ‘classic experience’?
---
Doesn’t help a good amount of people left thanks to Blizzards stance on a few things
---
Depends on how serious you wanna be.. when I was in vanilla seriously raiding I would put in 14hrs a day to make sure I was the top raider in my class. But I was a stay at home dad back then...
---
Exactly
---
I don't sit down. I jump around with rank 1 arcane explosions occasionally looking for them while trying to change areas. I either find them, they show themselves by forcing an opener on me or just fighting a mob, or I make it out. A good rogue will still get to open on me but at least I'm ready for it and not tabbed out or something because the area appears safe.
---
Ahh, do it on the OT so he just squishes the top dps!  Brilliant!
---
Rofl dude. At least 90% of these peoplr are always guilty. Don't waste your time. Yeah a few exceptions are mixed in there where Blizzard fucks up but they have a whole system designed to hunt and ban these people so you don't have to play the police for them.
---
Axe of deep woods is better than this as an orc. But to answer your direct question, you can reserve whatever you want if people agree to it.

Just wanted to post here that Heartseeker pvp realm on Alliance has a great community. Even the Horde seem pretty cool too and so far world pvp has been more about /emoting although my friends and I are still just I'm level 30s.

Hey could you help me out as well? I too love battlegrounds, duels and open world fights.. but I prefer daggers. My favorite is open world and duels, controlling smaller fight with CC and burst. I'd love some advice, I'm kind of new but I understand most of the lingo.

Correct me if I’m wrong, but that looks like they’re all part of the same housing development. In that case names are often chosen by the developer, not the city. For example, there’s a neighborhood near me where all the street names are Shakespearean characters, and I doubt the county just decided to go classic theatre with this particular plot of land
---
Still was likely a fan of WoW, or at least WoW’s poetic naming scheme, but probably not from the city
---
Or, I was just part of a community that didnt fuck over people first chance they got. - I played on Argent Dawn, and if you needed on BoEs there to put it on AH, you were all over the official forums until it got shut down. Im sorry you had your classic days in a buttfuck-community.

&gt; causing this awkward moment where they could get an upgrade but refused to use the point, but you cant throw away the gear because technically its an upgrade for him 
---
This is when the raid leader forces an item onto someone. In the end, the raid leader decides what happens with the loot. I was an officer in vanilla, never had a problem with this. If someone is hoarding for an item but passes on other items that would be an upgrade... sucks to be them, because we would force it on them - AND we would dislike the person. Gear is for the benefit of the raid. It's a dick move to not buy upgrades.

Currently level 17 mage on Kirtonos.

I'm in the process of levelling fast as I can. I work overnights, 8-10 central time, four days off four days on. I'm looking for a guild that I can socialize with as playing an MMO completely solo kind of defeats the purpose. As I level and hit cap, I'd like to get into the PvE scene as I've only ever been into the PvP scene. Likewise, I'd also do PvP.

---
There are only a couple areas where AOE farming makes sense, and to make it faster than questing requires some skill/risk. 
---
And the good AOE spots will usually have competition / other faction killing you just because which really hurts how fast you can level.
---
I've been doing it and honestly even if AOE grinding is technically faster, leveling FEELS like it takes forever because you're just farming the same mobs over and over for hours.

Can anyone confirm if you can still blink through the gap in the 2nd door in DM north?
---
The main thing is that people know what they're doing. Knowledge about the game is so much more readily available than it was before. People know better what gear is good or bad for their spec, they know their rotations better, they know support items better, that all and more combines to make Classic a much easier experience than Vanilla.
---
The game's basically the same, but the people are vastly different.
---
Blizzard stated its "working as intended"... Ya... Shrug
---
Yeah probably. Tamarack is the general housing construction contractor for a lot of the houses. Wouldn't be surprised. I have no idea who does the naming I just know they play Warcraft.
---
It seems like no one here would enjoy Everquest
---
Says who? I pass on BoEs if people needs it, because im not a douchebag. I dont expect people doing the same, but if you do and drop it on AH, eg. needed an item to sell it, you're a fucking ninjalooter, a thief and a really bad sport. That everyone does this and has become a "thing", doesent make it right. It just means the community and the players within it are shit.

LMFAO found OPs alt

I hear you. My priest is an alt. I still enjoy him (not as much as my warrior main), but this is definitely a convincing reason to keep the priest a secondary character.

Get the Western Plaguelands flightpath. Take off your gear and die a few times looking for the safest route.

Go back to Reddit and ask some more questions on how to get there through a level 50+ zone, watch a Youtube video and die some more.
---
Finaly you're ready to acknowledge that Western Plaguelands is the worst zone to go through as a level 30 alliance and you will go to Soutshore, start running northwest toward Dalaran and from there up north to Undercity where you turn right and run to Scarlet Monastery.

Don't bother with WPL, the few minutes it saves isn't worth the ganking and potential screw up when dodging mobs.

There was a whole wave of b servers. Also people in cities don't represent the population of the whole world. There are more casual levelers than you think
---
It hasnt. I was doing it this morning

Blame Esfand.
---
One of the best things I’ve seen on reddit in a long time.
---
I often top meters on ony and Mc. Saving the tank with nature swiftness.
---
Ey! It's bis for balance wrath builds!
---
They make Fire Oil, which is used in a number of tailoring recepies, and Elixirs of Firepower.
---
If you want to paladin tank through raid content you're gonna have a bad time. If you want to tank just reroll to a warrior youre still low level won't take you long.
---
Im not trying to justify anything. Im trying to imagine a scenario where your retarded logic actually makes sense.
---
Yea, gotcha. I see that most are fire/frost. Thats why i consider speccing into something different. thanks
---
We're in patch 1.12. This is what it was like then. It hasn't been nerfed.
---
You sound sociopathic tbh
---
of course its been removed reddit is so gay
---
Let’s get this out onto a tray.
---
It typically varies server to server based on who else is offering what but generally i've seen 50g is the most common amount. But if nobody else is offering especially early in the server life like now 100g or so is commonly accepted.
---
I just dstance dual wield tank, I only demo shout non elites until the aoe can take care of em and I tank every elite no issues.
---
I'm wearing all my pre bus except the leather-- in those slots I've got on 4pc valor. I'm always top DPS in the group due to infinite rage.
---
If your healers good you should be fine. Use a shield on hard hitters.
---
Makes perfect sense to me. It also sounds like you've already made up your mind about it, and just want somebody to confirm it for you.
---
There are two paths:
---
1. You either actively try to make it work on the server and faction you are at, and look for a nice social guild that has the same objective in mind as you. Could take a lot of work, but work that's more on your mental side. It's hard to change mindsets while thinking the grasses is greener on several occasions.
---
2. You switch to a server and faction you want to play on this time. Going to take a lot of in-game work, as you will have to "catch up", although if you've already leveled two lv. 60s then there's really nothing to catch up to. You've got this in the bag.
---
Both paths could still leave you with feeling more, in the end it is up to you which one is worth more to you. The work you've already put into your characters, or the change of scenery. 
---
One thing you should keep in mind is that you have leveled two 60s in a relatively short amount of time. Relatively, as most people who cannot play much because of their jobs are still leveling. So make sure not to burn yourself out. Could be all you need is a little break from the game to come back and enjoy it. It could give you the fresh perspective you want from a server/faction change.
---
Can confirm that he is ridiculously huge. It was weird walking with him.
---
We easily 3 manned with warrior Shaman mage. We initially 2 manned everything fine. I even got sacrificed but just popped NS-HW on myself. The problem was killing the last boss. It takes too long to kill him as a 2 man in current gear (Warrior is well geared but doesn’t have BRE) and just not worth doing. As a 3 man we clear 3 bosses and get the thorium in 13 mins. Pretty easy to do and worthwhile for the ore since trying to mine Rich Thorium in the world is basically impossible and will only get worse.
---
imagine paying for wow at all rofl
---
Sounds like you were in some pretty awful guilds.
---
I recently oined a guild with loot council and one of the first things they asked me was which 5 raid items I was most interested in so they could add me to their spreadsheet. As long as I pretty much just log on every day and be a part of the guild, I'm guaranteed to get the items I need at some point in the near future. I don't need to worry about accumulating points or rolling or any of that. All I have to do is show up and play.
---
is pure coincidence D:
---
haven't heard of these novels till now.
---
Alli heavy? I am not sure about na situation, but i think similar to eu eng. There is not a single ally heavy pvp server. Also how do you merge two servers which already have 3 times the capacity of vanilla realms?
---
Hrm, not always in fact Jagex Mods have been caught with major fuck ups in the past, even during the smackdowns.
---
Wait what? How do you pirate an online game like Destiny 2? With a keygen or someshit to give a unique key so you can create a Bungie account?
---
Your friend doesnt have a Terms of Service that you sign, whenever you borrow a film. Your friend bought that movie and now owns this one copy of it. Copyright laws are in place, so he cant make a copy of the movie and distribute it. Because its still the intellectuel property of the studio who made the movie. You are mixing up owning a copy of something and owning the rights to something.  
---
Blizzard does have Terms of Service you comply to, when you create an account. Back then, you had to accept the Terms of Service after each minor patch.  
---
In these Terms is written down, that everything ingame is owned by blizzard. Even the intellectual property theirs. This is the reason why people have been asking for classic servers for so long, because running your own classic server of the game is against copyright laws.  
---
You dont have to study law to understand stuff like that.  
---
You say the used game market is unethical? This only applies to online games and not to single player games. You seem to shove everything into "corporations are shady as heck", while they all have the right to protect their ideas and property.  
---
How would you feel, when you have an idea and someone else just replicates your thing, sells it for cheaper and pushes you out of the market?
---
This is what I dont understand. As a tank, the only people I bother adding to my friend list are healers. If I (and/or the healer) dont want to group with a certain DPS, thats it, most groups wouldnt even bat an eye because they know they can find a DPS in minutes, but finding a tank/healer would mean sitting around for an hour or more. I feel like DPS should be the ones who really want to figure things out simply because they shouldnt want to p/o a tank or healer due to how replaceable they are.
---
Information also didn’t spread like a wildfire 15 years ago. If this stayed in the game you’d have guilds kicking people for not coming with at least 10 stacks of each buff.
---
Haha is this the Overeem fan?

Stat priority for AoE mage? Some guide's say Int is best while some say spirit, then there's one's that say Int and Stam (eagle gear), or SP and Int. I've been reading guide's for a couple hours now and they all seem to conflict with each other. Just to be clear, I'll be using Blizzard, CoC, and Frost Nova primarily, with the occasional Blink and Arcane Explosions.

Last year it was guitars and guitar pedals.  This year I built an entire [home brewery](https://imgur.com/a/C2PSdfd) .  What guitars are you playing?
---
I‘ve bound everything to hotkeys and made all the bars transparent. I‘m using Weakauras to show all important cooldowns.

Pretty sure the woman on the left answered this one correctly.
---
It’s probably because “raze” basically means rape and pillage.

I'm going to be main tanking for my guild at 60 and I cant wait, currently loving that I can tank as fury (now arms since I've got my whirlwind axe.)
---
I am super looking forward to fury pvp but I've just always loved tanking since 2004 through wotlk. Quit after that, and came back for legion and DH tanking was a blast.
---
sp is good nature damage isnt
---
Some of the gold came from chinese prisoners. Well, to be exact, the guards. In Vanilla you could hear about prison guards forcing prisoners to farm gold in WoW, while it sounds crazy, I also find it very plausible.
---
Mara farming isnt 50g/ph its more around 30 on average. To get 50 youd need both herb *and* mining decently high and killing all 3 bosses. If youre only taking out 2, its for sure around 30.
---
You’re vendoring Larval Acid?!
---
Two types of people in this world. People like the op and those who use getting ganked as fuel to be better. This game is a war, ganking may seem pointless, but by hindering your enemies your faction will gain a overall advantage as your faction progresses. Everyone is a potential future enemy. 
---
Fight or flight. Learn to fight bud.

I wonder how many bans have been resolved without Reddit being involved so that the posts we get are mostly from people who have been legit banned which is leading to the death of innocent before proven guilty because its just a high likelihood that cheaters will post and false positives don't need to. It seems like we only really see false positive ban posts when the appeal is rejected.
---
He provides links to the TOS, which is no longer in effect. Nowhere in the EULA is what they’re doing expressly prohibited.
---
for priest mind control, yeah. for the Gnomish MC cap it doesn't iirc. It just attacks your target or something. It's kind of mindless.
---
Just play arms and 2h tank most of it. Or fury if that's your thing. Prot is objectively worse, especially while leveling.
---
How is it griefing if the server is like 60% very hardcore horde? There are 3 horde players for every 2 alliance. As reading forum post seems like horde have been terrorizing alliance levelers on this server for a quite while.
---
Big Facts. Biggest lie told to date “people weren’t as bad in vanilla”
---
32 y/o checking in here, kids, job, adult responsibilities you know. For me it’s been easy to play in moderation, I have a lvl 28 Druid and I started playing at the beginning of September. I must admit though, this is my first time playing wow, ever. 
---
I will never get the full experience of those who play religiously and care about phases and other things I am completely ignorant to. I am having a blast though. I play maybe 7-15 hours a week and it’s just a great escape. I usually solo and I will sometimes go into dungeons if I get a group. 
---
I must inform you though of a rule a have for myself is I won’t make friends or join a guild. I don’t care if it takes away from the experience because as soon as I do that is when I know the addiction will begin. I grew up playing Diablo 2 and played well into my early twenties so I am well aware of how addicting Blizzard games can be. Spent a lot of time playing SC before that, and a large amount of War3 thrown in. I had real life and in game friends in all of those games and part of the addicting nature is having fun in a group with friends in games like this, so as a responsible adult, unfortunately, I cannot do this to myself. We can still have plenty of fun playing though. 
---
I still play D2 for 1-2 months on Ladder resets until I get bored or it seems like there are more bots than players. 
---
I still jump on War3 once in a while and sit in horrific wait times to scratch my itch to slay with my Orc brethren.  (Although I am a filthy traitor I joined alliance in Wow because I heard playing on Alliance has much better areas). 
---
I think you can do it if you really want to. Just set some rules for yourself to not get sucked into the black hole of almighty Blizz.
---
Cool beans
---
They do have an internal level (which are likely the same they are showikg now) which determines things like skinning and stuff.
---
If you notice in mu post it talks specifically about COMBAT maths like hit chance
---
It has evolved just play BFA.
---
considerably is a strong word choice
---
really? i didn't read that anywhere.
---
if that's the case, my bad. i took op's word for it.
---
Now I won't see it the same way again.
---
It is because other mmo has been released at the same time.
---
What addons is that?
---
Well, here i am to tell you that i want to tank. Only issue is im slow as at leveling. I enjoy tanking, because other tanks upset me.
---
That too. 
---
It's more worth to auction the mageweave though, at least on my server.
---
Thanks for your semantic contribution which was completely unnecessary since I said the very thing in my comment.
---
Dire Maul wasn't out when I started playing as with many others, VC is for new players.
---
That was a temp ban cause you probably got reported for griefing, when in fact you were ending your own grief
---
Honestly, when vanilla first came out I was surprised to see that the alliance and horde were at each others' throats again. I remember wondering what happened to the night elves and orcs being buds on Hyjal.
---
Last boss turns into a wolf which is pretty much an enrage. It also has 32.000 health. You really need T2+ to burn him down.
---
i stuck up for the guy and called out someone that called him out on it...lost time and got a bunch of downvotes for it
---
ya the idiots streamers are pretty toxic for the people who believe their shit

About 10g each on my server
---
\*walks in door* \*walks to computer and turns on* \* logs in* \*enters world* \*takes shoes off* \*grinds for hours until exhaustion*
---
i dont think they changed it,

there is just noone online so the servers are not layered right now
---
Golemagg is a &lt;Forged&gt; realm.
---
Look at my statement, I never said he was farming MC.
---
Don’t put words in my mouth
---
Pleb
---
Grobbulus is RP-PvP and it has an almost exactly 50-50 split it is one of, of not the most, balanced realm on NA.
---
It was not. It was patched sometime around the release of sunwell in TBC as I distinctly remember climbing into hyjal with some friends using wall jumping after our first illidan kill.
---
R/soberdwarf
---
You never wanted to fight lashers. If you hit 11:30min at all three bosses + the veins mined + tomes checked/ picked up, you want to engage the groups guarding the herbs. They drop demonic runes for the healer, fel cloth and you can pick up the herb.
---
Hahaha that was a great read at least I know about how many stacks to farm legitimately. I’m a tank and send all my RC to alts I’m about to hit my first 100 stacks. Feels good doing this the legitimate way also raptor&gt; bone pony
---
Good idea, thanks for the tip.
---
It is always so hard to find an area where air grinding is possible, especially on a PVP server.
---
A few tips: only target melee mobs, start with one mob when you get to a new area to test out your damage to their health, buy better water 5 levels after you have learned your most recent one, and have empty bags.
---
With that said, anything more the 3-4 mobs will be faster than 1 at a time. If you can find an area where you can consistently do more while being uninterrupted, stay as long as you can.
---
Is that a fucking Ret pally with BRE? DISGUSTING!
---
can hunters solo DM tribute? did a trib run with my group yday and when we stepped on the king's platform we got in combat. Wonder if that was a bug or some kind of measure to fuck with hunters.
---
I guy at work, just yesterday wanted me to reroll onto the realm he and his friends play on. He offered to give me 4 14 slot bags and 10 gold to start a new toon.  So I rolled an undead mage started leveling, when I got to Brill it dawned on me, I have yet to see a single player or hear anything in chat. Not even a lfg sm. So I went to under city and saw 3 people.
---
I can not play on a dead realm no matter what anyone if offering me. It is way to limiting in the social aspects of the game.
---
Yes, by being a blacksmith with skeleton key.
---
Lul wut.
---
1. There is Stealth potions every Alchemist could craft.
---
2. What about DM and Gnome? Horde gotta run through Alliance Territory to enter either of these two.
---
Its how Blizz designed it 15 years ago and for the sake of god, I hope they don't change anything. Just deal with it like everyone does.
---
I accidentally got this pattern while doing onyxia attunement, just by killing the mobs on the way in/out. Hope he doesn’t see this.

This is a fact.

&gt;  I don't find it boring to Starfire mob 1, moonfire mob 2 and then promptly scoot behind a corner, bear form, rage up, demoralizing shout when they round the corner, and go to swipe town. Then all the casters aoe it up, and everything's dead.
---
Yeah that's pretty boring having ot LOS everything all the time, then drink for 15-20 seconds afterwards since everyone is AoE'ing.     That's a lot of sitting around doing nothing.  
---
&gt; constant go go go
---
That's a weird way of spelling fun.   Drinking is not fun.  LOS'ing *every pull* is not fun.  When I DPS, 80% of my time is standing around doing nothing (drinking, waiting for pull, waiting for LOS, waiting for threat).  
---
Most people liked TBC, because the biggest improvements made in TBC was major fixes to the extremely broken tank model.  Now that I've played it, it's pretty damn obvious tanking in vanilla is broken and why Blizzard changed it so much in the following 2 xpats (and continued to add tanking classes through MOP to keep adding flavor).   
---
The fact that tanking in vanilla is deeply flawed is why we keep getting threads like this, and why no one wants to tank.  It's not the players, it's the game.
---
1% crit is better IF your spell has more than 1k x spell coëfficiënt damage. So with Frost bolt for example, the 1% crit is better as soon as Frost bolt hits for 850.
---
I’ll stick with my accurate scope. 😅

Devilsaur Mafia is the name given to the vanilla wow private server players that would take control of ungoro crater. It normally consisted of a horde guild and an alliance guild that would have an agreement with each other and kill anyone who comes into the crater that isn't in these the pact. From there they would farm all the Devilsaur leather on the server and they had an set price they sold their leather at without undercutting themselves just like the mafia hince the name. 
---
So when someone says Alliance Devilsaur Mafia it doesn't really make any since, that's just people farming leather.
---
The problem is the person who pvps doesnt win anything, even when they win, even honor isn't really worth it, you'll get way more doing BG's, world pvp is just an annoyance, I don't even feel like going after people who attacked me, since it's just a waste of time for both of us, no one actually wins on wow pvp. And ofc, world pvp is extremely dull 90% of the time, since it's about numbers and levels mostly.
---
pvp server is for people with a ton of free time, because you really do have to level as fast as possible, to simply avoid the zerging afterwards.
---
ROFL *sobs*
---
You seriously can’t walk from Southshore to SM? And just go around Camp Mojache. Horde does this all the time in Ashenvale with Astranaar. Can’t believe you’re shocked you’re dying while walking through a horde settlement
---
Ekhm, what? Evasion? Vanish? Thistle tea combos? Blind? Kick? Cheap shop? Gouge? If that's no utility I don't want to know what your meaning of utility is.
---
I have a full time job and I'm still able to play around 10 hours a day. With the right job, anyone can do the same.
---
There is a chance to mediate. You can do it right away when he asks. He had to leave the group before you were willing to act apparently.
---
Must be nice, I’m on Fairbanks which is all Horde.
---
I finally got the chance to run with an Spriest today, they said they come to most dungeons with 120 drinks and sometimes run out. Is it really that bad?
---
You go through the backdoor which starts at the demon part.
---
He took it down already but this was some next level whining
---
Big plans inevitably mean going separate ways from friends anyway.
---
I joined in vanilla because my best friend talked me into playing. I joined his guild, and they helped get me to 60. However, I eventually left as he was in the guild's core raid team and I went off to join a scrappy cess pool guild, where I got a taste for raiding and pvp glory. I ended vanilla as a rank 10, having left my cess pool guild where I made plenty of friends, and went on to farm AQ40, before eventually clearing spider wing and wiping relentlessly to Patchwerk in the halls of Naxx. I didn't see the rest of Naxxramas until I came back for a bit at the end of MoP and cleared it for nostalgia on my shaman.
---
Point being, my friends were at different tiers of the game than I was when I started, and my ambitions were ultimately larger than theirs. We rekindled at a few points down the line, but if you have big dreams and your friends don't, that's fine. Just find other people that share your goals and you will forge friendships there.
---
Also, it's worth saying that trying to drag your friends with you along the path to your WoW ambitions is the quickest way to torpedo an otherwise solid friendship.
---
Hope this helps, and may you not have to learn the hard way!
---
Just farming leather 24/7 so horde prices skyrocket. Hmm...
---
Yeah I assume they only hunt and kill when they need to eat, but for a long time I was under the impression they only did it to survive or that the elves might not even eat meat. But nah, not only do they eat meat, killing and eating something is supposedly like a religious experience for feral druids, it's basically taught at their school. 
---
I guess it depends on one's definition of 'chaotic' as well, because I've heard different explanations. I've heard it's either basically an anarchist, or it's a character that can deviate from their alignment when making moral choices. I dunno, seems hard to put the classes into any given alignment when there's so many variables.
---
And if were talking the players then we're all chaotic evil because we do anything for gold, loot and exp.
---
What I don't get is that this stuff may inconvenience me for a few minutes but then I just go somewhere else and forget about it almost instantly. Why hang around and let people fuck on you.
---
Luckily WoW classic has no Pandaren or Kul Tiras humans.
---
I agree 100%.. not sure why I got downvoted by someone either lmao I was agreeing with the bullshittedness lol
---
A subdivision nearby me has a number of streets named after things from Lord of the Rings, Aragorn and Rohan being two of them I believe
---
I still rewatch that video on occasion.
---
Yea but you're also wasting your own time lmao.
---
wow world pvp is so silly, 0 stakes.
---
If it makes you feel any better, that's how many I got in all of vanilla.
---
I wish more rogues would try gank, saving retaliation for no reason :(
---
warriors use deep wounds in raids already, bozo
---
So.. Nothing? Or would that still be decent exp for like 2 lvl 52
---
We couldn't kill Zevrim, as we couldn't interrupt Sacrifice. So we can't get to the end boss unfortunately. Priest is going back to full holy tomorrow, maybe that helps.
---
Lol, I've been able to see enemy buffs this entire time, players or NPCs, quit lying to these people.
---
What guild?
---
Leveled as Enh and healed dungeons until 52, no real issues. Just keep a somewhat updated int/SPI set for those occasions. You can still put it off further if you wish, but I shifted more to dungeon grinding and went deep resto.
---
If at some point you want to make life easier, go 5/5 in the tier 1 talent for reduced HW cast time - this is not necessary, but might be quite nice I think. Also, after 40 I would respec to Ele if I leveled again - more similar gear to resto, and more steady / non-RNG damage compared to Enh.
---
Lol ya currently have herb and alch. So maybe the ghost shrooms are in Mara. 
---
Ya I am like 100g away from epic mount.
---
I just bought my carrot on the auction house, took me like 30 seconds.
---
Yes, the mechanics are also so dull and simple, there's not even any mechanical outplay. Just run in with 60+ people, drop every engineering item in the game and spam AoE.
---
You don't have to go through Ally territory to go to Gnome, Horde get a teleporter that takes em in.
---
no need to be racist, they all like that
---
You can get into hyjal on classic.
---
I'm playing a lvl 59 survival Hunter only with Agility. Without buffs! I do have like 450 Agility, 4k Armor. A lot of melee damage (that I am using) and health, dodge and parry chance. I can easily tank until tank ist taking over aggro again. While I do have aggro I am doing massive amounts of damage due to improved melee abilities of my survival spec.
---
In like lbrs i can see on the damage meter when an other (lvl60) Hunter is critting, but its not even nearly close to the overall damage I am doing. 
---
If we are talking about long fights other hunters may overtake me.
---
But you are saying, crit ist the best stat for hunters. Are you only comparing the damage output?
---
If you are on pvp i imagine the servers will be merged at some point, but who knows when.
---
it's the zone's level *5
---
so for 60 level zones, it's 300
---
starting level zones work slightly differently i think. but Barrens (or the next zone i.e. 10-20+) should be 50 fishing
---
NB: this is to be able to cast in the zone. it will not guarantee a catch.
---
Find a warrior struggling to farm and duo-farm Tyrs hand  or something else. You'll get it going pretty fast =) It's an MMORPG, play with people.
---
Also, as a healer. You could message people trying to find a healer for a while asking for 5-10g / run and every green that's not needed etc.
---
Herod is fucked. So very fucked.
---
and people wonder why no one wants APES on their server.
---
they sell for over a g on ah...
---
For later.
---
Name checks out
---
After learning paths and practicing, I can get to steady 40-42 g per h income with pickpocketing BRD. It took me like 2 and half week to get this far. Ofc it can go up and down depending on drops and resists.
---
Yes it’s amazing.
---
Too late. But being morbid is okay.
---
So I must be talking about the guy with the guild then huh?
---
Can off-hand items that are not shields be enchanted?
---
If you have a high performance computer from 2008 you're ok. But if it's just a laptop I think it'll be hard. 
---
Just try a 1.12 pserv and see if it works, if it does classic does as well.
---
Blizz officially states that cross faction collusion is against tos
---
Give Combat / 10 points in sub a try. I am making money rain this way and still top DPS.
---
Please say hello to me
---
You can do that in 30 seconds. There are places where it would take a LONG time to run away. Or it would require killing of lot of mobs, like REND runs.
---
Blaumeux is pretty evenly split &amp; is a pvp server. Great spot tbh got lucky
---
I'm playing a lvl 59 survival Hunter only with Agility. Without buffs! I do have like 460 Agility, 4k Armor. A lot of melee damage (that I am using), a fck ton of ranged damage. health, dodge and parry chance. I can easily tank until tank ist taking over aggro again. While I do have aggro I am doing massive amounts of damage due to improved melee abilities + crit chance of my survival spec.
---
With buffs i do get like over +10 crit chance only because of my agility.
---
If we are talking about long fights other hunters may overtake me. I dont know, never had a long fight yet.
---
But you are saying, crit chance on items ist the best stat for hunters. Please explain why it is. You lose so many other things. After i explained what Agility gets you. Please explain.
---
Can you help me out with the book locations ? Can’t find reliable info.
---
Gotta admit that priest was shit if he couldnt get you
---
Same as above.
---
I have done it, it's just not worth the time.
---
So much room for error, time consuming, etc. ZF Gy aoe is just so much faster, safer, easier, more GP per hour.
---
I cry evrytim
---
Bro just buy a used i5 and slap a graphics card in there. With the money you save you can grab yourself a mechanical keyboard and an mmo mouse.
---
I think it is pretty great. The world feels so real compared to other mmos and the variety of landscapes dungeons etc is massive.
---
Depends on the country. In Czech Republic welfare is available only to those who worked full time at least 12 consecutive months in past two years. I don't think that other European countries are that different.
---
I got like 2 pieces of plate on my healing gear.... both of them green +healing items

I am also losing weight, as I arent eating due to being extremely bored. Oh and i quit smoking too!

Downvoted. We NEVER argue here wtf are you even saying?

Pristine black diamonds.

Do you have to clear mobs to get to the quest giver
---
Is this easy to solo though?
---
Firemaw had layers yesterday evening. They prolly spin up layers when one is full so you wouldnt have it in the morning
---
since you're in the subreddit for a 15 y/o game, I'm guessing you're caring?
---

---
Nobody is going to clear that area so you can make big circles. In those you need to assign healers. And soon you are going to kill the boss in sub 20 seconds anyways. But in a PUG, it doesnt hurt to have one arcane potion on.
---
Just saying, others suggested like 10 fire protection potions that cost 5x as much.
---
idk, seems lika a lot of trolls in here.
---
Currently on the path. Hit level 17 on my mage and just got my Manaweave Robe before work. Feels good to finally have an actual robe and not homeless person tatters ;\^)
---
You absolutely can when your players are bands of nameless mercenary-adventurers who're loosely associated with their faction by virtue of being born into it but're otherwise self-motivated.
---
The moment you turn the story into a shitty single player game and make the player a singular defined entity you start having to create justification for why the Champion of the Alliance/Horde isn't being crucified for murdering random nameless adventurers from the other faction in cold blood
---
And yes, modern WoW's story is single player as fuck---The number of times I heard morons defend shit like the player being the leader of their class order and the Heart of Azeroth being a singular object that only one person holds because "In YOUR world YOU'RE the leader/champion and *they're* just a nameless hero but in THEIR world THEY'RE the leader/champion and *you're* just a nameless hero!"
---
Every time I heard some moron say that without a hint of irony or self awareness I found myself wishing that someone would put them out of my misery, preferably by castrating/spaying their parents before the spawn of their combined stupidity could steal my air.

that's a hunter weapon!

---
Spreadsheets
---
Exactly my point
---
&gt;My job is to keep mobs off the healer first and foremost. After that it’s up to the DPS to manage their own threat levels.
---
^This. Even some guildies I run with (DPS) disagree with this. Ive had many discussions about who's responsibility threat is and there is a high number of DPS who don't want to take any responsibility for threat at all and believe it is solely the tanks job...
---
Hahaha what a dud
---
Just die and ghost walk past, rez and zone, you people are amateurs.  
---
Alliance attempted to camp North on my server too, we just entered West and entered from the Library.   Must be exciting to camp a doorway nobody is using!
---
Yeah don vendor larval acid...
---
Basically you want to go for a shatter crit build, which means 3/3 precision (of course) and 5/5 frostbolt, frostbite, ice shards and shatter. That is the core of your damage abilities, the rest can be filled in afterwards like piercing ice. Get frost channeling as soon as you unlock it as well.
---
Also the game is shipped in the 1.12 state, which is basically the strongest point for many classes.
---
I have similar issues. I have 2 chars, 2 diff realms. I try to be equal leveling them but meh, is what it is. Im in no rush with either. Just enjoying the time.
---
I guess it was too hard to understand, the whole point went over your head.
---
Max poison lvl is determined by your character level.
---
Try with making it raid instead.
---
I've tried that, but moveanything can't make a vertical action bar (the ones to the right) to an horizontal.. the addon can just change the position :(
---
My dream is to create the guild &lt;Mirin Tor&gt; that only invites male dwarves, humans, and night elves of both sexes (or male tauren and orcs of both sexes on horde side). Everyone needs to be a warrior (druids could be OK, but no cat/travel form when the guild is watching). Everyone needs to have at least no shirt or chest piece (although less clothes is encouraged). If a guild member sees anything they like (a big hammer, a paladin with the banana shoulders, another shirtless muscly player) they must express their appreciation with “bro”, “brah”, “bruh” or any variation thereof.
---
Is it not capped at 280 at level 58?
---
Can I ask what you mean by only rewarded for time played?
---
Just reroll to another server. It's basically guranteed that blizzard will add paid server transfers, since it's printing money and it existed in vanilla.  You can bring those characters later.
---
We just went in through West and through the Library, lawl.
---
Would the Mara epic dagger and downranking help them much?
---
So since It's a class quest you wouldn't mind a Paladin rolling on it too?
---
Your not 60
---
For anyone that wants to read what was here, I took a screenshot on the tab I still had open https://i.imgur.com/X1regsY.png
---
Yes it is true and yes it is possible as long as you can have 0.5 seconds of non-combat time. Just gouge and make some distance.
---
I would like to know what proportion of warriors and druids go tank at 60. We can see the class break downs of the census data (before blizz broke it) but we don't know the spec.
---
I would imagine that &lt;&lt;20% of level 60s are tanks probably closer to 10%
---
5 poison skill per level.
---
i'm 100% with you. I have a job and still got my epic mount a week after hitting 60 without ever needing on any BoE's. 
---
I think it has to do with the mentality in western society nowadays. The last few generations feel entitled for everything, parents shoving everything up their arse "you are so special bla bla", i need this and that fuck everyone else and so on. It is tiring me, i feel sorry for them.
---
50 g/h is more than you usually make in BRD as rogue. I would say it's still amazing gold farm.
---
I got every class 120. Classic is so much better that it renders retail 100% unplayable.
---
It would depend on how long you did this. Was it like 5 minutes then your group came and you killed the mob or were they hiking across the map for a good 15-20 minutes while you just repeatedly slaughtered the guy? The longer you do it the more likely it'll be zone disruption I think.
---
 I finished brutal armor just now on my level 32 warrior. Should i get the 3 other pieces of armor that the quest spawned or should i forget it?
---
I seen somebody in my guild got the pattern so I thought I’d go give it a crack. I got it literally on like my 4-5th kill lol.
---
Im hoping for some tbc
---
Not strictly sure if this is what he meant, but I think he meant that he'd have no idea what's going on, who any character is or what the story is.
---
But then again he might've actually meant he's concerned about slow leveling. Going from 1-120 DOES sound daunting until you realize they've made it significantly easier (even allowing people mounts at level 20 if I recall correctly, which means gold gains must be higher at low levels than it is in classic).
---
Fair, but if you dealt with hours upon hours of queue time because you randomly chose the server and refused to leave, then that's questionable. It was either a complete novice (who would want to actually play the game than wait but didn't want to leave their level 12 char) or the world's most oblivious player.
---
Finished it earlier this evening. Everything went relatively smoothly. All 6 quests done for everyone and it took about 2 hours. A hunter, and 2 rogues were the dps. So no AOE, and we didn't bother with CC. 
---
It was brutal even though we didn't wipe. As a warrior who already struggles with AOE threat, those huge pulls didn't help lol. No one died though until Thermaplugg. Tank and spank worked until him, but this is the first boss thus far with actual mechanics. He kept switching aggro, and those bombs killed most of the group before we somehow downed him with a dead healer. Even after he died, those damn bombs that you can't outrun ended up killing someone. We had good laughs about that. 
---
Overall, it went smoothly but felt slow. I won't be doing that again. Came out of it feeling like I had just completed a raid. 
---
The map the other guy linked helped a lot. And we stuck to the wall during that corridor to not pull all those adds.
---
Anything dual core+ with any sort of dedicated graphics card from 2013 onward will play it well. Dual core Intel cpu's with integrated GPU less then 4 years old will run it decently as well, but will struggle in raids and wpvp
---
Gratz on your meme weapon!
---
shouldn't the max at lvl 58 be 290 then?
---
They were on the other side of the zone so I probably did it for a good 10 minutes or so, I just though I was being smart allowing us to get the quest done without having to wait for the mob to respawn.
---
Came here for this comment.
---
And people like you who genuinely believe that they are 100% correct always fuck the few outliers who are wrongfully banned. Leave the judgement to the company, not the masses.
---
The odds of 4 players rolling a *specific* number is 1 in 100,000,000, but the odds of rolling *any* number is 1 in 1,000,000.
---
When was this? I play on Gehennas and the opposite was true when DM released, all alliance players got slaughtered, tons of horde everywhere.
---
There were a few places walljumping still worked even after vanilla.
---
Dude, that is a pretty insane setup! Looks more like a professional setup then a hobby one to me.
---
When I swapped for a bow it takes longer time to shoot than it does with a throwing knife, so I think you're wrong
---
Bigglesworth is horde dominated. But they spent so much time group ganking they now suck at pvp. I feel alliance is starting to catch up.
---
I'd go so far as to say don't bother until mid or late 20s unless you're twinked. 20-24/6 can be rough. But like others have said, if you find a good spot and don't get bored of it it is efficient. However I'm not convinced that it is worth not doing quests for
---
yes, improved gouge -&gt;spam stealth -&gt; have cheapshot bound to the same key on your stealth bar as stealth on your main bar -&gt; profit.
---
Thats cool
---
Dude Tanking in MMOs has sucked since they were invented. There's a reason the dedicated tank population is ALWAYS the smallest. Sure there are the other social issues with players being numbskulls and the tank having to babysit but that just compounds the already dull gameplay. Healers save lives, DPS push their limits, Tanks herd cats.
---
I say all this as someone who loves all 3 roles. Tanking is the only one people get tired of on a regular basis. You can run with the same 5 healers for years, but your tanks need to rotate every 2-3 raid tiers at minimum or they'll quit the game entirely.
---
&gt; No Chnages
---
its such a joke at this point :D
---
How much Fire Resist do I need for MC and what equipment would you recommend?
---
Unemployment isn't enough. It requires virginity and bad hygiene too.
---
not that bad but you can definitely use 60-70 drinks in one run
---
Must be horde, alliance general chats are quiet af.
---
If you are in combat with a creature they are social with that will do it,  also any shouts, as well as obviously any kind of damage.
---
.... oh no. oh fuck.
---
Some people can't have a little fun
---
This, OPs post, and many others I've seen floating around is the main reason I've always been a DPS player. I take my job as dps seriously, because I know it's an important job. Especially on classes with a lot of utility and cc. I just love it. I'm not saying any role is more important than the other, but it's what I do best. And even though it's a thankless job, I'm happy to contribute to the group of dps players that aren't brainless and don't ruin dungeon experience for healers and tanks. Because that is very important now in Classic. I've decided to fully commit to my shaman instead of my 52 warrior, I'd rather play a totem twisting enhancement shaman or even elemental than to get another group that demands I tank even though I joined as dps. I'm also just gonna do dungeons with guildies from now on.
---
I know tanks are like the unofficial party leader traditionally, but at this point I think it's just something we put on ourselves when we tank, but it's ok to not know everything. I'm often the group guide and I play dps, it's fine really.
---
Epic mounts are nothing when you just grind out quest XP and dungons for extra drops.  Probably took me a casual week of grinding to get my epic mount once I hit 60 and that was also buying a pair of Edgemaster's Handguards for 450g before my epic.
---
I myself am a proud member of Wolf Cola on Ashbringer.
---
Ten minutes isn't that bad but I wouldn't go for much longer. GMs seem a little overzealous sometimes and innocent people get caught up in nonsense like what happened to the guy above and that guy who was banned/unbanned because he got false flagged for abusing guard mechanics in Tanaris. Turns out he wasn't and the ban got overturned. So if you kill NPCs or camp somebody for like 20 minutes you should expect an intervention at some point soon, provided you're reported.
---
iTs A cEnTaUr DeRr
---
Why would you want a reward for not even playing the games?
---
Very true. Don’t get me wrong I enjoyed playing up to 60. Not saying it’s a terrible game obviously hard to convey tone over text just wanted people’s opinions
---
Noted and saved
---
Not really. There is nothing fun about what apes virgins are doing. There is no way of stopping them when the rest of us have real life obligations, hygiene, girlfriends etc.
---
ily
---
so not no changra then? :D
---
people really need to understand that were not playing vanilla wow AT ALL but an activision remake of it.
---
I audibly chuckled, my friend.
---
That’s undoubtedly true. But as anyone who does keep up with those things knows, when blizzard initially announced the servers, many of the mainstream streamers (lul) agreed collectively to play on faerlina so their fanboys and all their shenanigans wouldn’t ruin the ‘classic experience’ for people on a bunch of random servers. So for all intents and purposes it is in fact the streamer server.
---
And not a single person who has lost their virginity. Weird, huh?
---
Sorry, 10 i mean.
---
Big tree create big shade
---
Fair enough.
---
I've only done DME jump runs and know what we get as a duo.
---
Like tried running MC it just wasn’t for me. Such a long haul for just one item or whatever, not slagging the game off just not sure I really can justify investing so much time into it
---
Just keep a threat meter installed, it's way more important than a dps meter.
---
/r/im14andthisisfunny

You dont only play for the ingame rewards. Up untill now I've been leveling and goldfarming. Yesterday a mate who played hunter level 28 asked me and friends to help him out. We (60, 60, 56 and 28 hunter) went to STV to help him out with the full big game hunter quest for the bow reward. It would speed leveling up for him by alot having that bow at 28. While we higher levels were doing the quests for him all he did was yelling "Alliance!" and start chasing poeple 10 levels higher than him knowing we would help him. We killed a shitton op lowbies during this time and he, the lv 28, had the time of his life. Once some mains showed up we fought at nessinway camp for 30-45 minutes and hearted out.
---
After that we helped out our level 31 mage friend with his wand quest in SM Library. All we did was laughing and stealing loot from eachother in friendly banter. 
---
An ofther friend level 33 rogues had the Sword of Omen quets so we brought him aswell. Laughing everytime when someguy pulled and letting him die for fun. Its was only laughter and took twice as long as it should be.
---
These moments, no matter what level or rewards, are fun. Fun with friends doing whatever someone needs to or likes to do.
---
Its not the quests and dungeon farms I remember its the fun from doing random stuff.
---
TL;DR
---
Do stuff with friends.
---
Username checks out.
---
It's okay. Now that I got my mage to 60, I'm the one terrorizing the horde on the server. I see the same reaction from many others who finally maxed out on alliance side. Seems to be that we are finally able to fight back.
---
He's already discussed briefly that he has struggled with some recordings and knows his speech and such have taken a hit. Not that he likely has a lot of time left barring a miracle, but it seems fairly likely he will be calling it quits soon before he gets too bad off.
---
For a human, maybe. It's a good tanking weapon because it's a &gt;50 dps wep. But you can find those in MC as well. As a non-human on ally side I'd rather go with CHT/Perd blade and ACLG. As an orc you actively don't want QS, and as a non-orc horde side you'd go with the daggers and gloves again. 
---
It's a fine weapon. It's not the best option until TF.
---
I can't unsee the fact that the slime portrait looks like a Labrador.
---
Get it to 60. Your 46 hunter is going to get destroyed
---
I didn't say you have to, I said it has it's place
---
The devs on this pserver are lazy af
---
No one's trying to hold the non-elites, the dogs aren't a good example.
---
When your mage pulls aggro and eats a pile of snares or silences as all the elites turn to murder him, it generally goes very poorly very quickly for the mage. You know that's true too, or you wouldn't bother looking for tanks in your groups.
---
The difference between waiting till the tank has established threat before aoeing and not doing so is night and day.
---
In the former, the mage *will* pull threat at some point - but by then the mobs will be low, and they'll peel individually from a tight, clean, easily AoE'd cluster. They'd die before they reached the mage.
---
In the latter, the whole pack immediately disengages from the tank and scatters. The tank can grab 2 at best unless he's willing to burn a 10m cd, and those scattering mobs are going to start forcing the healer to waste mana *and* try to stay alive while the mage is burning all his mana just trying to control the group and stay alive. Meanwhile when he does get AoE in, he's hitting a little cluster in the middle of a clusterfuck instead of a nice clean pile.
---
Playing alliance is cool if you are gay. So a apparently you are gay. (see, anyone can be as childish as you.)
---
Also got mine today after farming crystals for two weeks. Grats! Feels good to have a mount these non-pally plebs can't get.
---
I see Horde all the time on Heartseeker, idk what you're talking about. I have plenty of PvP every night I don't spend in SM, and the 60s love to camp the entrance. Heartseeker is probably about 70/30, maybe a little more balanced. I wouldn't go so far as to say 60/40 though.
---
Yeah might be true, heard a lot of possitive things about Ashbringer as well.
---
Gnome is far better instance on 30s that trying SM graveyard until lvl 32 at least for the Alliance. You have full instance with solid AoE pulls. With two jumps you can skip trash, if you are only interested in acquiring key to workshop and killing of last boss.
---
You just need to jump on huge cog (sounds somehow wrong...) from the first balcony to hall where elementals and slimes are. Second jump is in mech spider boss room. There's a bridge to his platform, under it an a bit to the side there's a beam you hop on and below it wall has small edge you can jump onto. You can run on that edge skipping all unwanted mobs and enter tunnel that leads to the last boss area. 
---
Last boss drops usefull rings and you have easy access to him via workshop gate. So if you are 31-33 and done all your quests it is ideal for you to farm that pre Whitemane BiS caster hat, rings or other rewards.
---
Yeah people who buy gold typically complain when they banned but they always say they've never bought good lol
---
Yes dbm I used a lot in retail for boss pulls mostly. It requires all partymembers to have dbm installed. Thought it would be ”easier” to have it as a macro and not an addon.
---
A++
---
Geared guy doesn't show up, noobie replaces him who needs all the gear
---
It will take over your life again if you have a history of such behavior. I'm honestly lucky that this time around I'm just bored of grinding quests so although I still play far too often, it isn't for crazy long periods of time. 
---
Here's what you can expect if you do play: make character, grind hours and hours to 60, grind hours and hours for gear, grind hours and hours for pvp rank if you're into that. Yes it's fun and definitely a great time sink, but if you've done it before there is nothing special waiting for you.
---
This isn't to hate on wow by the way, I've just seen how it can consume people to an unhealthy degree(I'm sure we all have). So I say to you, nah man it's honestly not really worth it
---
Not trying to start any fights here! But I really don't like barrens.. or westfall.. but darkshore is amazing and lochmodan is nice too. Mainly because of the old wibes I get from it many years back :)
---
PSA: You don't need to heal us after the combat ends. It feels terrible to get a big heal from our shaman just after I've put a piece of cheese in my mouth. It's not even your job to keep everyone at 100% health, as long as people aren't dying you're doing your job. Especially if we have a mage.
---
Why are you wearing fr gear for mc trash lmao
---
Same here. Without WoW taking up all my free time, I tend to find things to spend money on. Games, electronics, hobbies, etc. 
---
An old coach of mine from back in hs actually spent like 30k when he quit wow. He got into motorcycles with his wife and pretty much blew a good chunk of their savings. 
---
If classic wasnt here, I'd probably still be blowing my paychecks on all kinds of dumb crap
---
I only blink once, I am using Rank 1 Nova already. I will try to time the blizzard better.

It wasn't like that in vanilla and I hate it since it makes it much harder to body pull and let your mate pick one out of the group.

I mean, if the  pally is eligible to complete the quest and is going going to use the weapon, I don’t see a problem.
---
Transmiutes are a passive and guaranteed income, not a gold farming method
---
There is no such thing as a fair fight.
---
you can play a hybrid of ele and restro,
---
not the best of both worlds but you sure can heal raids and kill people in PvP realy well.
---
&gt;keep classic classic
---
People in vanilla had tons of add-ons! These fucking people smgdmfh.
---
3x dense stone... grats.
---
You do not LOSE threat you become nonthreatening. It is very much like being feared tanking in a group. The instant the buff is off you have all your original threat. As others have said this is awesome with aoe taunt as it forces focus.
---
Am spending more playing cos high just brings the game to reality
---
This story sounds exactly like the kind of sob story someone would send blizzard to justify a ban.  
---
(Not denying the validity of your story, just made me laugh thinking about it)
---
Psychic scream often feels like the epitome of it. 
---
I have no idea why but I've noticed on some occasions that when I'm around priests that finish their quest at the same mob camp as me and run back, pull stuff and scream it off I for whatever reason get aggro'd by both the feared mobs as well as whatever those guys collect while being feared in all directions.
---
No idea what's going on there but it's not the first time that I fight single mobs only to get swarmed from all directions without really doing much (or doing stuff like healing the priest or anything that could put me on the threat list).
---
I guess you havent tried getting into BRM most of the time on Gehennas as alliance. Sometimes the ganking starts just below thorium point.
---
Most of the time at the ramp up the mountain.
---
A BoE is essentially gold dropping.  Gold that can be then used to purchase any other needed BoE item by whoever wins it.  It isn't "ninja looting" to roll on a BoE item.  You're clearly just salty you lost the roll.
---
Ninja looting is rolling on a BoP you cannot use or entering a instance and specifically breaking whatever loot rules were established at the start.
---
Next time clearly define: "Only roll on BoE if your class can use and it's an upgrade, otherwise greed."  If it tilts you so much.
---
Once again this has nothing to do with "retail" this was the norm 15 years ago as well...
---
Not playing cause of Nostalgia but for the gameplay here.
---
wow... FFFFFFFFFFFFFF That
---
Yes, of course, if the class that can deal damage while moving and doesn't have a minimum range can kite something, so can the class that needs to stand still to deal damage and does have a minimum range.
---
Fact is, killing princess as a hunter is absolute waste of time unless you get god tier rng.
---
I’m holy pala for my group. Can’t stand solo leveling and can’t imagine spending tons of gold for talent switch every evening, so I’m leveling a hunter for farming. Also tried to heal with hybrid build it just not the same.
---
Agree, just want to add if OP is thinking about doing a full quest run, that involves running the dungeon multiple times (some quests require a second trip)
---
Posting it on cringe, thanks
---
"kekw" ok
---
Any good for exp?
---
Trolled ENTIRE SERVER ? Or trolled VERY limited number of people ?
---
Depending on your server, you might think you'll tame it at 37, but you probably won't, because he probably won't be there. And if you camp it for 10 consecutive hours, it might or might not be there. If it is, another player might or might not get to it before you. You might or might not spend weeks camping it. If you decide to level in badlands and check once in a while, you might get lucky  and get it, but I wouldn't count on it.
---
Short answer is play with any other pet and consider broken tooth to be the holy grail that you'll probably never get except maybe in 5 months when there aren't any hunters camping it at 4 am on a monday, if you get lucky.
---
with the mass of players hopping into dire maul during the next few days? Not a chance
---
There will be high listings for the book, no doubt about it. But who would buy those? I assume the book will actually sell roughly for the same as Blademaster's probably less, cause it will be a lot more common the next couple weeks.
---
Transmute = effortless passive income
---
Herb picking = farming method
---
After every boss fight in deadmines, a patrol spawns at the entrance of the dungeon and walks towards you. Keep that in mind.
---
If you should find a chest in there, don't just open it. Use /roll in chat to roll on it.
---
I don't know why he is downvoted, it's right. Economy would be hurt really badly with much more money floating around. Prices would skyrocket and classes who can't farm effectively would either have huge problems or had to make gold farming alts.
---
I don't disagree. It's not great and gets used rarely. (I've only used it as a rage dump occasionally in dungeons) But in my quest to not devote 6 points for Deep Wounds, there's nowhere else of use to put the points. I would love to put them in Cruelty, but those points have to go somewhere in Arms to get MS :)
---
Biggets mana saver is keeping them stacked. Goodluck!
---
+5% pet damage isn't exactly OP since while raiding you'll sac your pet all day so..
---
That’s a lot of toilet breaks too
---
Alright yeah that seems a lot more feasible than pirating a game like Destiny.
---
bows also are much slower than all throwing weapons.. besides the default cast time
---
Yeah, and the reason they seem to make it work is cause they're spoon-fed gear in the start. Once people catch up to the gear level things will be different.
---
I love the CE flex.
---
Oh, I've always thought MacBook was just a word for an overpriced unneccecary PC.
---
I remember a gold co-op style that was briefly popular for pugs. Each piece of loot has a silent auction and the winner pays up. At the end of the run the total payout is divided between all raiders. 
---
This has the advantage that if you really want an item you can make it happen by farming for gold outside of raids. And if nothing drops for you, you still get a share of the pot.
---
Come to bigglesworth ally, full pop constantly, people everywhere. I'm only 46 but I will absolutely reroll with you. I have a guild, 30+ people on all the time, we're always doing things. I need a leveling partner lol.
---
These posts are too similar and happen daily. They are a guaranteed karma farm and people have figured this out. They're easy to fake and impossible to disprove.
---
With all this said, you should always take them with a grain of salt and challenge the OP, instead of blindly agreeing and further encouraging this behavior.
---
This. You can think of it as the value of the first roll not mattering, except deciding what number the consecutive rolls need to be. The first roll can be 1-100, but ended up being 49, the three remaining need to be exactly 49, the probability of which is 10^(-2*3) = 1/1,000,000.
---
you think we care, but we dont

To make it more frustrating, when you run to them, they might drop a freezing trap, or wingclip (slow you) if you’re in melee.

Come to bigglesworth. It's like' 55/45 and it's pretty balanced.

Nah, that shit is lame. That's why we classic.

its worse...mob grinding i never oom, but every 1-2 trash pulls i gotta drink...went thru 80+ waters in a single mara run a little bit ago
---
Around 300g
---
Every hit you miss needs an extra fireblast to finnish off. But maybe your mana pool is a bit small? I don't know what else it could be.
---
You could try out DM farming if gold was the reason you were doing it. There you fight mostly non-elites and does not require your entire mana pull each pull.

Alchemists can transmute 1 bar every 2 days. With a limited number of alchemists, arcanite prices increase rapidly with any minor increase in demand.
---
Also and mostly, people buy up all of the arcanite and arcane crystal supply and relist it for more to turn a profit.

Stuff like this is why i moved from golemagg (EU streamer server) 2 hours before launch

Subjectively, yes, it's good. But I can feel you.

I played on and off on pservers, leveled up, then took a break of a year or so. When the itch came Back I restarted fron lvl 1. Rinse, repeat. Maybe try another class and Race?

Fun fact, “gehennas” is the name Jesus actually used to describe Hell.

Just gonna warn you while you are low enough to reroll pally tank is only really viable for 5 man dungeons if you want to tank end game raids 95% of guilds use warriors and druids exclusively as tanks with warriors making up the vast majority of tanks.

First off I started late so to assume that I'll never be 60 is an interesting view point.
---
Second I'm not arguing for the sake of having the community "wait for me".   In fact only now am I actually arguing as you say.
---
And as far as contribution being 60 vs lower level.  Please define "contribution" because that appears to a statement with no actual context.
---
The first few words of your post clearly show that you were starting from a different point of view from the beginning. The journey to Sixty is the goal in classic. Play slowly, advanced slowly and enjoy yourself and your surroundings and your fellow players whilst doing so.  If you have rushed to Sixty within 5 days of six days on whatever then you have missed the point of this game into.

That's an exaggeration, but we need more horde to even it out, silly

I prefer Wicked Cruiseship (WC)

You have to actively try to go OOM during raids. The amount of mp5 and spirit buffs you get make it difficult to go OOM during boss fights. During raids you should also have mana pots, you'll have your mana gem, robe of the archmage ability for mana, health you wont need to worry about much, you have fire ward which protects you from 1k fire damage, and you should have greater fire protection pots, 3-5 per raid is usual until everyone is super geared out. The only boss you might worry about is Baron gedon, but the bomb damage is blocked by a fire prot pot + you have iceblock and ice barrier if you're worried about dmg

I mean, i understand but i guess now, im just trying to fully grasp the limitless (or limited) possibilities!

Thank you so very much!

Thanks. Too bad you can't remember the rest - I'm really curious about what it really meant.

There should be a subreddit for this stuff.
---
you aren't stealing somebody's only shot at a piece of gear. everybody has the ability to farm gold and purchase it, as they would do normally if they never saw it drop in a group.

can foros drop in every dm wing and trash or just in one?

 if youre a tank and can't figure it out. go ahead and buy this awful weapon.

Dismissing your pet causes it to lose a small amount of happiness, but while dismissed it doesn’t lose any over time.
---
Dying makes it lose a big chunk, other than that there’s not much you can do to avoid happiness going down.

Report and continue with your life.

Or see it as a challange, using line of sight and continue doing your thing.

Two gear sets is all you really need, unless you also want a specific pvp set.

Int+stam &gt; spell power, mostly for dungeon aoeing and solo aoe grinding, and just general use  
---
spellpower &gt; int &gt; stam for raiding. There are trade offs, e.g. 1% spell crit = 59 int for example. but mostly holds true
---
its about the time spent with a group of people completing a task, if you don't enjoy that (either the task or the people themselves) then it won't matter how many items you get
---
In Outland, yes!
---
How is this unfair actually.  I mean when you on a pvp server you can't complain that you get camped/killed for whatever reason.
---
And with Evocation you probably don't have to use a mana pot on most fights.
---
Don't know answer to most of that but with regards to the food I am aware that you need to feed a pet something they like. Which is why you have different happiness depending on food. For instance a cat might like chicken but not ham and a wolf will like ham but not really chicken. I.e. you don't feed something fish for instance if it won't eat fish in the wild.
---
No don't assume I am late to the show.  But I also don't rush there if I look at my map and if see a guy in Thousand Needles queuing up for SM Lib then I'll probably work my way over to the dungeon in a manner that doesn't involve me getting there just to wait for Mr. TD to take his time.
---
I understand their point.  Is it okay if I have a different take on something?   I'm hardly ever the last to arrive because i manage my time efficiently.  Before claiming that I'm part of the problem refrain from assuming that I am the guy everyone is waiting for at the instance.
---
this is how i deal with friendly mages AEing. Just run a bunch of mobs thru their channeled blizzard and you don't even need to vanish lol
---
Ahhh ok ! Fair enough ! Let me see what there is
---
Not rly worth playing, it's not the "real" vanilla WoW.
---
It's a wayyyy too easy together tinkered everything down nerfed version.
---
It's okay to look at it if you've never played vanilla, but that's it, it's not the original experience.
---
Always dismiss pets in town. You lose 50 happiness from it, but that's 1.5 ticks of a level 45 food. Easily made up for when you go adventuring. 
---
Dying always makes it go down one tier.
---
Once you have all the gear you need from dungeons, there's really not much left to do, especially if your guild is doing well on the current raiding content. I think this is accentuated even more now with how much better the player base is. We have 2 groups 1 shotting current content. Dying 0-2 times during an entire mc run (&lt;2 hrs) as melee really cuts down on the raid consumables used and means I only need to farm mats for a few hours a week (if that). Things will probably change as bwl comes out and we get that on farm while also still needing to farm mc every week. ZG has some useful loot, too. So I can see it getting a little more time consuming later in the phases. But for now, if you're established, you can get away with basically raid logging.
---
Raw food, good food type. What pet u have?
---
Yeah im done. Got to 51.
---
Honestly I think that is how most people feel. It's exhilarating when there's the challenge and you pull it through, and of course it's annoying when you're just dying because the party is bad and they eat through several of your 3g a pop mana pots.
---
People hear healers talking about how to mitigate the 'bad' stuff though and interpret it as healers saying they don't like any challenge ever, and that's really odd. Like your post here, even though higher in the tree I said how I get annoyed when a tank wants to sit and wait after every pull for me to be full mana.
---
It sounds like you agree with what I was saying, but somehow framed my posts as 'hysterical'.
---

THAT KIDS MOTHER IS YAPPING AGAIN

Thank you for sharing your thoughts and tactics! 
---
Do you think a countdown of any length would be ok?
---
Surely they would have known quite fast that something is off if they are following the general chat channels even a bit, no?
---
Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like there must have been plenty streamer related stuff in there.
---
To further explain this, blizzard doesn’t crit.
---
1 item worth of 9s dropped from 4 packs. It's pretty bad.
---
Ally here never ran gnomer either.
---
While I think the idea of controlling a market is pretty cool, I really hate the whole premise of Devilsaur Mafia. There is no way to combat cross faction collusion without resorting to doing so yourself, which I find antithetical to what PvP servers are about, and I think Blizzard would agree seeing as you can't make both Horde and Alliance characters on the same PvP server.
---
If you think this is strictly an issue on Faerlina, Devilsaur Mafias can  rise up on any server, we just see it most prominent here because of the exposure via streaming.
---
I don't know if it's because I sat at max range, but I've never been mc'd in Strat after 20 runs.
---
Can't believe they actually nerfed lashers but let mages have uncontested broken farming in instances.
---
You only had needed to take a look in the combat log, maybe mob beneath floor
---
TFW this is a legitimate ban lol
---
This is why classic wow is just so much better.
---
I'm not sure we have any proof unless we have Video evidence of back then.
---
But I just think - why would they?
---
If People found out about that they would rage a lot. And Blizzard has no reason to do that really. We wanted Classic and if that meant having a fucked up economy I think Blizzard wouldlet that happen :D
---
Using someone else's property to make a profit is literally how capitalism works.
---
Don't think there's any spotlight on specific proof other than patch notes, but also remember they're trying to recreate the intended experience rather than the actual experience.
---
Your argument of ”people who twink do it because they get rekt at 60” 
---
Is just you being mad because you get rekt at 19.
---
And since you so freely use anecdotal evidence, ill just say - the twinks ive know are usually tryhard PVPers that just want an alt - and will go ahead and tryhard on that alt too. 
---
You dont want your mind changed because nothing in this discussion is objevtive.  
---
Bullying comes from a place of insecurity and the need to press someone down to feel better.  If you choose to think that way of someone twinking, it says a lot about you. 
---
Ill add that ive never personally twinked a character.
---
Calling someone out on their bs doesn’t mean you ‘care’
---
Spoken like someone who needs to do some reading
---
If you find yourself pulling aggro off tank then you should switch to cleave as it costs more and does less damage in single target, and also does not have increased threat gen like heroic strike. For optimal dps you would want to rage dump with HS since it's more damage for less cost than cleave (single target).
---
Selling stuff for gold is literally the definition of “greed”
---
Benched players get full dkp  that anyone in the raid would get
---
I found minor speed does help a bit with Princess. I also clear all the turtles (I'm a skinner) to prevent any accidental multi-shot aggro. Make sure you use a swing timer addon for your auto shots and you can also use your pet to bait princess into casting her AoE which gives you time to get an Aimed Shot and a multi off.
---
But, it still takes like....5+ minutes to kill her..?
---
Gehennas became the streamer server
---
Tbh, i got a few gray items from the 5 packs we cleared as a group and still made 8g. It's gonna be worth it for a holy priest.

Activision does not make Blizzard games. Blizzard does.
---
This isn't news. Though I thought the Vampire Clan or whatever Unbind's former guild is called was involved as well. He went on Asmongold's stream and explained how they were colluding with the Horde to run the Crater. It's not a secret. Blizzard isn't going to put a stop to it.
---
Thanks for typing that out!
---
I guess most confusion is about answering  different questions: the chance of rolling 4x the same number vs rolling 4x exactly 49.
---
Well, in the FuryProt spec you actually do go into prot, you get to have the 2 hit shield block, the threat bonus, last stand CD and the lower Sunder Armor cost, you only take the major tanking nodes, going lower actually does nothing to pure survivability. Though the stun and threat snap talent in deep prot are great.
---
I am using this, though I am a tank who want's viable DPS or to switch in raids without respec since my role varies every boss.  https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/-05050105305010051-5023011053 
---
One key difference to pretty much any other warrior spec is that you do not take tactial mastery, which is really sad and takes a lot of flexibility out in a lot of situations, but on the otherhand you will be DW/Shield dancing all to time, and it's really important you do so, staying in DW all the time is a bad idea, also you won't be able to interrupt withouth shield in def stance, and it triggers a gcd to swap so you need to have foresight of the situation.
---
On the otherhand you have a spammable AoE slow for 10 rage which is really nice to have to help tempo for your team, once you get the hang of it you have nice DPS, and if you manage it correctly, you take pretty much the same damage as deep prot.
---
Though one limitation from this spec is: you need a lot of gear.
---
You need enough gear that you actually have high hit/crit rating, so you have steady threat and lots of rage to dump, also you need to target some dodge parry, items giving 2 dodge can become better than DEF items while in DW but you'll still have a lot of def, I'm currently running with 375 def. But you can probably skip a lot of the def gear if you have T1.
---
Dal'rends are great for DW tank, for their dps, and stats, they seem made for DWtank.
---
In talents the real difference from a full dps tree is that you do not get exec rage reduc (some do), you don't have tactical mastery, and you don't go impale in Arms
---
I'd say the spec is on par of many other, though it's harder to play in some aspects and is better for premade
---
yeah I would like to go mage but it seems to me a lot over populated... and when I was watching some duels with other classes I had feeling that everybody except warriors and palas are beating mages.... and friend of mine is playing warlock so I dont want to play same class
---
I just use my rage at being cold to beat it
---
Fucking finally
---
This statement is so stupid.
---
 Ragnaros has a knock back which is terrible for the tank as if he gets knocked back, some random meele will die. Having fire resistance will make you resist this knock back. It may not be absolutely needed to kill him, but it sure as he'll makes it alot smoother if the tanks has some fire resistance.
---
Tbh the ones doing Ragnaros with raid filled with pre level 60s are people who have played the shit out of private servers so the whole argument is just stupid.
---
but dude he saw it on esfats stream its legit
---
Numbers just seem inflated. Frostadamus the guy with 11k gold did some today and it was not nearly as much gold
---
On Gandling EU &lt;Aim&gt; and &lt;HYPE&gt; tried the same. They seem to think they're some kind of APES-style guild but fail miserably at individual playerskill. A number of random horde players wiped them and just entered
---
LOL Sick :O
---
Is that connected straight to your fridge? And is the beer cool when it Comes out? OMFG

How on earth are you saving Money when there is unlimited supplies of beer coming straight outta ya fridge bro :D
---
depends on how you define good.
---
It has flaws sure BUT i've been playing Classic more than any game in the last 7 odd years.
---
Fuck I feel you...
---
I'm so glad I got out of this... make sure you delete this game while you are not playing it.. .You'll fall right back into the addiction!
---
I'm pretty unsure that there will be a ranked system in this pre BC together tinkered anything but not vanilla nor classic WoW version.
---
I’d also like to know. This weapon is a bit of a goal of mine, since I’m probably never going to get Thunderfury. I know it’s not the best weapon ever,  but to me it’s a very special blade. What makes it a meme?
---
Damn... with the nerf to DME Lasher farming I'll invest all my Money in WoW Gold... xD
---
Back in the days our policy was that you couldn't pug the progress or farmed content. You get your dkp if you are standby and need to be available on the raidtime for this. At some time it was discussed to even give a bonus for the standby, but not sure anymore if we finally allowed it.

Stupid analogy.

Your friend owns the movie, he obviously gives you consent to borrow it, making it ok. A better example would be if you borrowed his movie to watch it, then sell it and dont give him any of the money.
---
Blizzard owns your gold, they let you use it how you wish inside the game, but you are not allowed to trade it for real world things.
---
Same, I already had most funko pops and dvds, but my family was concerned about my love for the ladies of Marvel.
---
Thanks, killed her last night in pre-bis. Only problem was towards the end of the fight with some healers dead and some oom, which caused me to die.
---
Personally I would never pay for it but I understand why someone would. I think everything in the game is pretty achievable if you spend enough time grinding it with the right resources but if someone were to level an alt and not want to spend the time to grind it away in groups and just wants the item I think 20g is not that much for it.
---
Not fun being outnumbered 5 to 1 eh?
---
I agree with you. High ticket gold items are for everyone to need. Every class can switch that tanking sword for a full boe preraid bis set.
---
Well luckily he is Tauren so it isn’t as bad but there are better tanking weapons. Typically you would want something slower and harder hitting for HS tanking or something super fast like a dagger or eskanders. It’s almost better as an off hand for DW tanking honestly. The proc also takes a buff slot which could be bad in certain circumstances.
---
Get a petfeeder addon, it will make him eat automatically selected foods (so he won't eat your buff food)  (you can set the threshold happiness level) and also let's you see how the food affects him.

Pussycat gains 17 happiness..

Are you wearing +healing gear?  Get it from the auction house, and look under cloth because all of the good +healing gear is cloth it seems.  Also what I do is downrank my heals 2x times, so like you most powerful heal is +6 rank I use +4 rank and so on.  I also use hots only when things are getting hairy and try to use healing touch more then anything else cause it can crit, while rest of the hots cant.
---
This is the only way I die while levling my hunter. From nowhere there comes 10 mobs and kills me, since feign death is bugged 9/10 times nothing you can do.
---
It is not his alt. He said it was for his alt but then he put it up in the AH with his main.
---
So it isn't for his alt apparently

Not saying a ban isn’t possible, but I don’t think it’s very probable. Plenty of people are posting hyjal screenshots, and who didn’t go to Old Ironforge? It’s a fun part of the game :)
---
because it didn't happen in vanilla.
---
What is ridiculous is the amount of people who seem seriously angry at this.  Maybe it was just a shit pug that let this guy roll? who the fuck cares
---
In Denmark, you get up to 18000 DKK a month for 2 years while being unemployed. You have to be actively looking for a job and will get a lot of help from the government. You will be paying for membership to a union, as they administer your unemployment money. Most people don't want to be unemployed though.
---
We also have programs for people who get a handicap that makes it impossible for them to work (whiplash eg). After 2 years of unemployment you are dropped into a much much lower monthly payment. Like a fourth of what you got before. And if you have a working partner you often get nothing at all.
---
So is Gehennas. Every other dungeon entrance has been gatekept by walls of horde since launch. The resistance strikes back!
---
Ahhh so the ninja is even dumber than I as giving him credit for
---
I don't get your problem, really. Why do you care if others play the game a lot? The only really reason I can think of is jealousy. You are jealous that they are in a situation in their life where they can dedicate this much time into something they enjoy.. While you sit at work.
---
RiP Shaman runs, tell me if you find a successful way to do it.
---
All I do are guild dungeon runs. Haven't seen a pug since classic came out.
---
All our level 60 dungeon tanks are arms wars or hotw druids and all they do is spam aoe while dps goes ham. Dungeons are quick, easy, and profitable because we also funnel greens to tanks who are running for sake of gearing guildies.
---
The game is fun when everyone is on the same page and there is a baseline requirement for playing properly to be invited to the group. None of our tanks that run guild groups tank for pugs, because pugs are shit and they don't make any gold or its terrible gold per hour.
---
Basically, join a guild.
---
Wow just is a terrible experience for large scale pvp, it ain't about minmaxin
---
Pretty decent guide but I think you overvalue Anticipation and don't give any credit to Improved Revenge. 5 Talent point for 10 def is pretty shit, but 45% chance to stun with Revenge makes you so much better in 5 man dungeons. I use the other 2 points off Anticipation on 2nd point in Improved Taunt and 1 point in Improved Shield Wall.
---
Got any proof? Cross-faction communication is in the terms of service.
---
Uhh. You’re wrong you neckbeard.
---
They made it so enemy buffs are visible. One of the “minor” changes they brought over for Classic.
---
Fucking idiot lol
---
In my groups blood fury reads -100% healing.
---
APES don't though. There are people who work normally playing there.
---
The order of the cast matters.  It will cast the first one on the list as a priority.  It will not cast the second one,  unless the first one is on cooldown.  This looks like a good one to me and I'm going to try it out myself.  Good stuff here.  I'd add a tooltip in there for a matching icon and also a /startattack so that I don't get stuck not autoattacking when tabbing targets and such.
---
Your attenpt is futile. Nothing will change canon horde clearing DM. Puny alliance.
---
Fairly difficult to overcome 1000s of people cooperating in discord. Seen the shit happen in other games as well (Atlas, Life is Feudal). Mega groups form and just ruin the game. Discord makes it too easy for toxic shitbags to congregate.
---
Yeah this post really came together with that last line. This is nothing personal but from my experience as a dps, resto shamans are baaaaaaaad. Either that or priest is just that much better. The amount of times I've had to sac a VW instead of my succ just to get a self heal cause the shaman refuses to heal life tap hp is insane, and yea I eat after a pull and keep plenty of bandages handy. Nearly 100% of the healer complaints I have heard are coming from shamans. My best advice would be to just deal with it or reroll cause people are not going to change. In fact as we get more gear, laziness in between pulls is only gonna get worse.
---

can play an alt if they leave their main logged out at the instance.

&gt; That literally just says "deleted."
---
Yes, and there is a difference between "deleted" and "removed". Do I need to spell out the difference between them or can you figure that out for yourself?
---
&gt; "Person says thing" isn't overwhelming evidence.
---
But, clearly, in this situation, it's not just a person saying a random thing, but there's actually multiple things implying it. Not acknowledging that is a fault on your end, not everyone elses.

What? I have never known that there's specific terms for streets going certain directions. Probsbly because that is useless in most cities i've been as the streets tend to go wherever the fuck they want.

If you need cardinal directions maybe you just need someone to hold your hand while you visit places

How is this shit upvoted? Most of people in APES are in their 30s and have jobs/families.
---
&gt;you get access to Travelers Backpacks, Freezing Bands, Dusty Tomes
---
Exactly. The rng factor for big ticket items is there. Which ZF doesnt have at all iirc.
---
Then 1% crit is the equivalent of 6 damage.
---
Yellow hit cap for pvp then sta/crit/agi in dungeons agi/crit. For raids hit is king all the way.
---
the proper way to question this post... is "Nani?"
---
Did you even read the thread?
---
I would reroll. It's a social game so the way to enhance your experience is to get together with people who want to play the same way you do. You've already leveled 2 toons to 60. You can likely do another one before Phase 2 comes out and it will give you a chance to see the other faction's zones.
---
Let's play a hypothetical here. Only takes are allowed to post groups. The thousands of DPS and Healer groups are all sitting there, potentially for hours waiting for a tank to come in and save the day. Lo and behold, a tank finally posts a group, but alas! the group is already full as only the tank can post. 
---
boy do I hope this is jsut god-tier shitposting

There's no way to make a macro to do exactly what you're trying to do.  You're gonna have to make a modifier macro as someone else explained, or just get used to casting it as you (or your opponent) closes distance.
---
And the streamers who have their flocks of drooling fans are probably largely to blame over this. Like sure this would probably of happened anyway, but how many of these guilds are "streamer" guilds like Asmons?

Where exactly do you LOS it? It's almost instant cast. .5 second

It’s not like APES are all around at all times sapper rushing every horde on sight. When alliance is unorganised (which is 99,99% of the time at any spot) horde is completely dominating the wpvp in Gehennas.

&gt; A mob that is targeting a player will keep targeting that one until another player moves to the top of its aggro list for some reason – the targeted player can die, Vanish, use Feign Death, etc., or another player can do enough damage to the mob to supplant the first player at the top of the mob's list. If there is no one else on its list, the mob leashes back to its spawn point, **again meaning that it ignores everything on the way back. **

Thats not how classic remastered works

that is however how vanilla worked

Shit is broken, as usual.

Deadmines = DM

ele shaman is viable. You would be hard-press to find something in Classic that isn't viable.

I tried to just put the Raging berserker's helmet over Moe's head, but his weird...upper lip thing? kept cropping through
---
Yes they can but op said he wants to mainly pvp and the bis items for phase1 are also bis for mage lock. It would be smarter to heal in raids as hybrid and get mail caster gear that might not be best for ele but better than having a cloth chest. He will also find raid spots easier

Any clips or videos?

Can we get banned for using this type of addon to adjust macros?

Shouldn't you do DME DMN and DMW?

I disagree with you. I don't know his intentions with that question and I'm also not psychic. "He had to leave the group" sounds as if I made them do that. It was their own decision and of their own volition. Expecting me to know what they have in mind is a bit much.
---
I've had multiple people in a run say they are here for item x and when they asked if I'd roll on it I said "yes" - they still stayed. Mostly because in previous runs I had greens in specific slots and those new items would be a much needed upgrade anyway, yet I rarely link them in chat because I wasn't asked to.
---
Now I'm in a position where I can actually choose to pass depending on if I already have a good enough slot item and am willing to run a dungeon over again.

Pretty sure the commenter somehow missed the "tonight" in the title and was thinking of the old Jeopardy episode which mentioned Leeroy Jenkins.
---
I think fury prot is more about dealing a lot of damage and very gear dependent. I would think until you get the correct gear for fury tanking you could prolly benefit from just do a normal anger management, cruelty , shield slam build
---
I would obviously expect a retri/prot paladin to roll need on it.
---
What is concerning It's not just DM. They're rushing things out because of handful of EU streamers on welfare who are no-lifing it. Barely 1% of player base is 60. Between the gym, girlfriend and 45 hour work week, I'm lvl 32 myself and I seldom meet anyone above 35 when leveling in Shimmering Flats. Phase 2 already announced coming in December, I just might quit right no
---
You missed my point, if you are trying to mount up and get away you're gonna die anyway if you are caught so the shadow lock doesnt matter
---
Older cities don't really do this, it is more common in younger cities like the ones the US (New York etc)
---
Of course it's from faerlina...
---
wrong
---
No, we don't. That's just the short version about how social security works here.

You dont need to farm blue dragon sinew at all.

The "feed pet" buff lasts 20 seconds. It is interrupted if your pet takes damage or is sent into combat. It doesn't get cancelled for no reason, as long as your pet is doing nothing and doesn't have any dots on it, it will get the full duration.
---
Pet food level: check your combat log while feeding to see this. 35 happiness gain per tick is the maximum, and for that the food needs to be within about 20 levels of your pet. What's probably confusing you is that happiness has a hidden numerical value; an unhappy pet might be just under content or right down at 0. The latter will need more food to get it up to happy.
---
Your attack speed with bows and guns are dependant on the actual speed of the weapon. The throws is just the ability itself. It is a lot faster for rogues to throw stuff but you wont reach the dmg numbers of bows and guns since they have individual stats that the throwing weapons dont.
---
Dont know how warriors work but this is the case for rogues at least.
---
I was considering lashers farm for xp alone on my priest 54 to 60, is it still worth it or would I do better questing ?
---
&gt; It's literally a 5-second google search, the posts on Blizzard's support of the PRC were on THIS subreddit.
---
So, because they did that, they are more likely to lie regarding someone being banned for RMT how, exactly? 
---
&gt; Person A is a pathological liar.
---
I don't think you've proven anything like that. If you were to exclude the word *pathological* it might be better. 
---
&gt; But for the record, Hitchens' Razor; I didn't even need a basis in the first place.
---
You should look up the meaning of *non sequitur* and it's meaning in regards to rational debate. Because what you've done in this thread is exactly that. You still haven't presented a basis for Blizzard being untrustworthy when it comes to their statements regarding RMT bans specifically. 
---
The fact that you don't know the difference between "deleted" and "removed" isn't everyone elses problem.
---
This would be awesome to see. I'm still struggling to comprehend how so many people have had the time to reach level 60 :)

I didn't specifically grind any gold when I hit 60 on my mage, I just started grinding pre-raid BiS from lvl 54. A week after I hit 60, I got my epic mount. A week later, I got my Robe of the Archmage.
---
That's roughly 1.5k gold in 6 levels + 2 weeks from just playing the game. I probably averaged 15-20 G/hour, so it's not efficient at all, but I also got all my pre-raid BiS except 2 pieces along the way.
---
As far as i know Deadmines has always been DM but with Dire Maul released I think it makes most sense to say DME (or east) DMN etc.
---
I do have the time, I didn't know if it's more valuable to just de everything, or actually get to 300
---
What good NA server has more ally than horde like this?
---
How is that better than VC, DME and DMW. If looking through chat calling Deadmines VC and Dire Maul east and west DME and DMW it makes it way more distinguishable.
---
&gt; I wanna play a shaman, they look very fun and interesting. I searched on youtube and stuff, and everybody's saying how bad dps they have and aren't going to be invited to raids, and that is pretty much a dealbreaker for me if I can't get to experience the endgame content. Are they as bad as people say?
---
No, this sentiment mostly comes from people thinking Classic is hard (it isn't) and everything needs to be optimized in order to kill a boss. I understand this mentality in Casual guilds but in any other guild who has people willing to read guides and follow instructions it's not necessary.
---
If you want to be rewarded for time spent not playing, maybe Farmville is more up your alley.
---
I think it drops of books lying around and from bosses
---
I’d say 26 is where it becomes more viable imo for CoC I had a hard time competing for farming spots and that was when the server was layered I assume it much worse now , it’s fast and good money earner if you can do the same thing for hours on end just try keep mana potions and good int gear on
---
This dude hasn't seen the naked rogue videos.
---
yeah i do that with my pet, sometimes he dies on the return getting stuck in her farts. i also have the barov trinket or my chicken to help too.
---
So it is in game then? Good.
---
I thought fury tanking was all about overgeared healers to farm out that reluctant drop before next raid tier.
---
You spelled "what life should be like" wrong.
---
My opinion on this is fairly Sturn. No.
---
No I don't think people should just be running this spec, because it exists within the capabilities of the class. 
---
No I don't think the average player/guild will pull this off effectively.
---
No I don't think that in its current for that it is better than Prot. 
---
Why? 
---
This is something that has arisen from the PServer community and was used within higher ability guilds who were smashing content for the bazzilionth time, had the movements/tactics better drilled than an Infantry Sgt Major and were in optimal gear to do so. One of the biggest highlighting factors to this Fury/Prot spec is Skarm who is just a really nice and informative youtuber and makes plenty of good videos, however even he states that he doesn't recommend this build before BWL at the minimum! 
---
That being said, can you make it work? In short of course you can. If you have healers who are willing to pump a little harder, a guild that's willing to wipe and practice this spec and tweak it to boss fights then you will find success in almost every element of Classic. The content is easy and for the most part already very trivialised, but just because something works, it doesn't mean its good.
---
For 5 man's, play it by ear. I have both a Warrior at 60 and my Healer is now at 51 and it's always about playing it out. Ask the question, are you happy for me to tank with a 2h or duel wield? The healer might be in such good gear that having you take a bit more damage might keep them awake more. Then do everything you can do to make their life easier e.g. mark the targets.
---
Of course this is my opinion and others will/have told you otherwise. The whole thing about classic is having fun and if you find that more fun then rock it.
---
If Revenge is up, it will cast Revenge, otherwise Sunder Armor.

If you're out of combat you charge, and whilst infight it casts Hamstring. This way I don't need an extra slot for hamstring in BS. If you wanna chain abilities in macros you have to use timers and I'm not sure if they work in classic. But you could always just press the button twice to work around the global cooldown problem.

In everquest you get to dps race, which would kill the mafia instantly.

&gt; Blizzard has literally advocated genocide.
---
You are going to need to provide such an accusation with evidence. Please present clear evidence where Blizzard has stated they advocate genocide. 
---
&gt; Non sequitur. Religion requires bigotry.
---
I love the fact that you are trying to use that to defend yourself, when you are "guilty" of it yourself. Even *if* Blizzard advocated for genocide, how does that mean they are untrustworthy in regards to their statements regarding bans for RMT? 
---
I don't know why you included the last couple of quotes. Trying to throw up a smokescreen to divert attention away from your shortcomings?
---
I mean they only go in there if they want to minmax and they go in there with max level.
---
True, however some classes still can farm really well.
---
Wait so focus does work in Classic you just don't get to see the nameplates for it?
---
I tried setting a focus, but thought since it doesn't show anything it wouldn't work. Or are you using another solution?
---
Which mobs are you farming? Elites won't be quick, more like mass whelp farming. I would say UBRS/rend runs are the best source of scales.
---
How so, exactly? And why is it relevant in this context?
---
Get used to them calling it VC now.
---
did u fucking read the post ? Your own faction proxy killng you

Because people are mad that people are innovating and making funny videos that they didn't think off. It's the classic effect of thinking that the opposition has some unfair advantage instead of admitting you suck.

You actually won't gain too much more mana.  If you look at Naxx gear, it has relatively similar amounts of Int as T1.

This exactly. The other day I was with a rogue pug (running Uldaman, not max level yet) and he topped the DPS chart by a landslide. What he was doing was literally going from mob to mob, letting us finish up whatever he started, so he could get his opening damage of has much as possible. Incredibly infuriating stuff.
---
Nah ma8. I am tired of people  crying  every day about Feralina and Asmongold. Cross- faction  communications done outside  the game are 99.99% impossible to prove and you know this.  You also know Blizzard will not dare touch a 75k viewers  streamer no matter what. So then what are you aiming at exactly?  You just wanna build up tension  and cry. Well good job.
---
Lol he used "cheap exploits" way too much if he didn't want People to hang up on that but only wanted to get the "easy way to make Gold" Point across.

I find it very reasonable to comment on that Point of OP's post.

Congratz on that. Now get back to doing whatever you have been doing so far it is quite entertaining

Whats BS is the aggro radius. Some of the mobs in tribute runs have to be pulled in weirdnways or it aggros the pack from across the damn room.

I swear the aggro radius in Dire Maul is worse than in Molten Core.

---
It is. There were several changes in DM (heck alone the only 5 instances per hour was instated because of DM farming in vanilla) that are not in the archived patch notes, so people forgot about them. Pservers are everywhere in between from accurate to completely arbitrarily wrong about server-side only data that they couldn't read out from the client and never had access to. Using a pserver as a reference is simply useless as Blizzard will never adapt their classic game to a version that only existed / exists on privately operated random servers.
---
 *(tl;dr the odds of "quadruple rolling" in a dungeon are* ***1/500,000****)* Stats are tricky*:* 
---
There are 100\^4, or 100 million possible *four-roll* sequences. Odds of *Any* sequence is 1 in 100 million({49,49,49,49} is equally as likely as {1,2,3,4} or {2,2,8,8}) 
---
In *four rolls*, there are 100 possible ways to "quadruple roll":
---
 `{1,1,1,1},{2,2,2,2},...,{100,100,100,100}` 
---
Therefore the odds of a "quadruple roll" is 100/100,000,000, or **1 in 1 million**
---
# BUT WAIT!!!
---
There are *five* rolls in a dungeon, not four! A sequence of 5 rolls is really two sequences of four offset by one.
---
`{1,1,1,1,X}{X,1,1,1,1},{2,2,2,2,X}{X,2,2,2,2},...,{100,100,100,X}{X,100,100,100}` 
---
Note that {1,49,49,49,49} and {49,49,49,49,1}  would both qualify as a "quadruple roll", but {49,49,1,49,49} would not.  So in a 5-man group there are twice as many opportunities to roll 4 numbers in a row than if there were only 4 people. Therefor the odds of seeing a "quadruple roll" in a dungeon are actually 200/(100,000,000),  or **1 in 500 thousand!**
---
At least raptors don't squeak as boars.

Not personally worried. VC imo is just easier to see in the sometimes fast moving trade chat. But to each their own I suppose.

This is why I dont like the namecensorship on Reddit

Alliance proving their age once again
---
The issue here is when he's switching between targets to apply sunder armor, then I have no idea which target he actually wants down first, especially when he's applying more sunder armors on other targets so others don't draw agro.
---
He's talking about the giant trees that are the size of a raid boss.
---
I really dont understand that, since some changes are 100% positive and make troublesome or badly implemented stuff better, while having 0% effect on the actual gameplay, it just makes for example with auto loot, the game in some aspects easier and up to date.
---
Why are some people so against change?
---
Its not like vanilla was flawless and perfect.
---
Yup
---
It dropped for me on the first run I did and I paid 20g. Very worth it, even if it took 5 or 10 runs. I lost 5 rolls on the ring previously, including a 7 vs 8 roll. Way more time intensive to run it as a group and compete with 3 people
---
And why would viability of more niche stuff be bad?
---
Enhancement Shamans are nearly non-existent in raids because they rely on stormstrike which isnt allowed. More debuff slots would give them a chance to play too.
---
But in reality. Rogues are not the issue to keep aggro off of. The issue is that rogues can finely balance their threat right behind the tank. The issue becomes when just ONE guy attacks anything but skull then the blade fury from the rogue becomes an issue. Mechanicly rn I have a rogue friend and I can keep aggro from two blade fury targets of his but if our warlock budy dots all mobs up then I lose threat from the rogue. I slam sunder til max stacks and use shield slam whenever I can so at that point I can't do much more except burn taunt and mocking blows which is alright, but people need to remember and respect the fact thst there comes a point where the bare mechanics of rage gain out weights your potential to keep threat. If I need a sunder and a heroic strike right now at the same time to get threat but only get 4 rage a hit and I need 27? Then I am limited by the game and my gear and at that point I say it's the dps fault for pulling mad aggro because like it or not, i cannot just conjure better gear or magically get alot of rage out of thin air.
---
Same thing with the Westfall Tunic. Just replaced it at 42. With a Nightscape Tunic I could have gotten 6 levels ago :(.

Bye bye account.

This is the road to alt-aholism, and one of my favorite activities in Vanilla.  I currently have no 60s and four toons above 30.

But like the others have said, if you don’t enjoy it, thats okay.  You can always come back later
---
Yeah....
---
But &lt;Olympus&gt; has 12 guilds full of fans. So that's 6000 Asmongold fanboys alone. So while the actual prominate streamers only make up a minutest of population, their woadies make up a fat portion. 
---
Have you ever met an extreme Asmongold fanboy? It's why I refuse to play Alliance.
---
You only need 6% for hitcap with combat talents(+5 weaponskill), and you have 5 from talents so you hit yellow cap at 1% crit.
---
After that, hit is an okay stat, it is not as good as crit though. IMO hit is about 15-16ap worth, and crit about 20.      But it massively varies on your gear setup and I don't have a proper spreadsheet for rogue dps unfortunately(pls send).
---
If you're that bothered, fly to feathermoon.
---
I cant wait to get this. Huge gratz to you!!!
---
ToS has been changed over time, cross faction collusion is not bannable anymore
---
I expected a GM to know, but forgot to consider that Blizzard laid off all of the competent Game Masters and replaced them with tech support staff the majority of which have probably never played the game.
---
I have heard that DM lasher farming is not viable in Classic.
---
The problem is you're up against cross faction PVP and tag wars at the same time. Cross Faction guilds will camp the fuck out of you until you leave and leave their allied guilds to take devilsaurs while they pvp you. This is made worse when your faction is actively griefing you by telling them where you are and making PvP nigh impossible. I've seen countless stories of people riding on horses on top of stealthed rogues to show other faction where they are.
---
Haha didnt expect to read that here of all places :D
---
The Flamescale Dragonspawn in Burning Steppes. I read it was the best place to farm them outside UBRS
---
You do not lose threat so per say, but while you have the potion up, the mobs will prioritize any other player with threat over you since you are invulnerable. So if you intend on killing your friends by popping it, yeah that works as long as your friends dies in 6 seconds.
---
This is why I use crippling poison, then kidney shot the runners. Most groups dont give a shit about meters, they just want to do successful runs with no wipes. Being able to blind, kidney shot, garrote, and vanish also keeps me from doing most of what OP was whinging about.
---
I feel it's like being live at a Jerry Springer show. There's so much random drama and conflict and activity going on and it's infinitely more fun to feel like you're a part of it rather then watching it at home.
---
Apes is a EU based guild? Back on lightshope they where mostly during NA Times online.
---
No one was ever "stuck" anywhere, saying that basically proves you either: 1) never raided before at least T9 or 2) were the kind of person that didnt wanna put even the most basic effort in and complained about being "stuck in Karazhan".
---
I hit 70 about 3/4 through TBC and half my server was literally raiding every single tier every week, so please take your revisionist fanboy nonsense somewhere else.
---
Just guys bein dudes.
---
As a Priest I literally carry 5 stacks of water and at least 5 of mana pots with me at any time. Obviously switchout trinkets and FR gear, keys, conjured water (however much i can carry) and 2 stacks of buff candles. Forgive me but my cup of fucks to give is empty 🤓
---
well when I go there it also just says (deleted)
---
Almost zero streets in Australia are named in this way. Who cares if it’s going east/west?
---
When he says expensive buffs he's not referring to class buffs but rather consumables like flasks and elixirs.
---
Exactly. There are no ally heavy pvp servers. Best bet is to play one with as close to 50-50 as possible.
---
That being said, we have somewhere between 40-60 and 45-55 A/H on Razorgore EU, and horde are getting whacked both in Dire Maul and BRM. Loving it.
---
I do remember that too. I think I even started levelling my hunter twink more because I only then became aware of their soloing capabilities and wanted to try myself (not DM farming but other solo farms).
---
I also remember them doing something to lashers and not least of all, I think there were rogues chain farming dusty tomes so that's when they implemented the 5 instances per hour maximum limit.
---
There were many DM changes and not all of those are in big patch notes that are archived and still available. Pservers simply are not accurate enough to be any useful reference.
---
B-baka! I-it's not like i like you or anything!
---
It was certainly against the ToS in Vanilla :)
---
&gt; **IF you trust your officers** (big if), loot council is always better and quicker, but ofc some guilds focus on progression while others focus on loot for the sake of getting loot.

If you don't trust your officers then find another guild IMO.

Tribute runs are harder. Doable but you need to be an engineer to open the door at the top. Saw a guy solo it so it's possible but one resist can ruin your run. 2/2 imp Feigh Death is 100% needed to do this.
---
are reusable materials also found in the paladin mount quest as well?
---
How do you know? Genuinely curious.
---
Where exactly did you spot the hate? Did I say I hate them? Neckbeard is not related to hate in anyway either so get lost. And yea sure, they have families and jobs and play over 12h a day.
---
I'm at 1.  Hell I've only had 2 large veins that had more than 2 taps in them.
---
Level 50. Same, but I Naruto-run on my way home from work for more playtime.
---
That attitude stems from people who think Blizzard messed the game up once already and the game is better off without any tampering rather than risk breaking the core design tenets of the game apart a second time.
---
Haha I am 55lvl Warr on Skullflame Eu . I am just tired of people  crying  just for the sake of it against  streamers.
---
Dunno about other servers, but on Whitemane I think healers are the most common role. It's extremely hard to find a group as a healer. One of the reasons I rolled a priest was to get easy groups, but it's just not the case.
---
However, when I do find a group most tanks/dps add me to their friends list so hopefully that pays off down the road.
---
I made many friends while dungeoning / leveling and have plenty of warriors to do dungeons with. I mean, if you want to find one, I can be my ass off that the best tanks are already befriended and invited to dungeons over and over again. They would rather also go with people they know what they are doing than with someone who could fuck up dungeon runs and wipe by asspulling or not interupting right target. Run dungeons, befriend tanks/healers if you are DPS. You will have both people to play with and friends \^\^
---
You’re literally “paying to win”. Nobody is going to respect that. It shouldn’t even be allowed.
---
Back when WoW was, you know, current, I was playing a frost mage.  A geared as fuck frost mage, on a pvp server.  You can imagine, it was glorious.
---
So, when I added the Zandalarian Hero Charm to my Talisman of Ephemeral Power, it was less than a week before they nerfed it so you could only use one at a time.  I turned in the quest, and then because I was there, I went to go participate in the fight for this arena.
---
So I rolled in, and I popped both trinkets for the first ime, and I blasted four different guys with 3500+ frostbolts, obliterating them SO HARD.  But I took some damage, got that attrition damage all on me.
---
So when I went to go open the chest... a level 41 rogue ambushed me and I died.  That motherfucker got the chest.
---
Some of the guys I killed whispered me to make sure that if I was killing them THAT hard, then I had better get the fucking chest, right? And being a person who's not a fucking liar, I had to tell them what happened.  It was so depressing.
---
Probably has to do with people not knowing who Darius the Great was.

What's the most fun class to level? Taking into account:

* Downtime

* Interesting spells / rotations

* Dungeon experience

* Independence

A hunter did this to a group of us on purpose while we were killing elites for that humbert sword quest in hillsabrad... he pulled 5 extra elites on to us.

---
default for 'pet attack' is shift-t
---
How long are your MC runs. Typically a decent geared and experienced guild can full clear MC in under 2 hours.
---
After waiting long hours, I don't want to get ninjad by a 50-60 ally hunter. Funny thing is, I ninjad broken tooth from a 38 ally hunter. That's why I've waited. After doing 1 ZF and 1 full maraudon run, I've leveled the pet to a decent level to catch aggro. Problem solved.
---
Again it isn't a problem for me atleast with rogues. It is other people attacking targets that's not even market. I've had marks skull, cross and moon and a shadow priest blasting on the fourth unmarked mob and the issue there is a mind blast forces me to taunt. But then the rogue has aggro and needs a taunt off their main target, that's when I use mocking blow and start to sunder the other target his blade fury hits. Once Ive build aggro on that target I taunt the mocking blown target and were gud. I have no idea how you guys find these shit tanks though, the bare minimum they should be doing is just sunder main target twice then use revenge on the other targets and circle like. You auto attack target 1 twice. Revenge target 2. Sunder skull twice.  Stuff like that.
---
Did you find out? Ive seen this font around before but cant find the addon for it
---
Farmed for two hours yesterday, and made like 20g which is awful considering 12g came from lucky green drops. Had no issues killing the packs and avoiding patrols, but the loot tables were complete garbo. Kinda miffed about it tbch
---
An entire legion of them
---
Its not a 3rd party addon, ifs doable with what blizzard allows in LUA, its fair game. They will block (in LUA) the parts that arent allowed.
---
A 40 man guild needs 2 tanks.  The guild tanks got thrown through guild runs non-stop until they completed pre-bis.  For our guild this happened by week 3.  Now pre-bis, they have no reason to tank dungeons anymore (except maybe rep grind).
---
So I think that's why tanks stop tanking.  They log on for MC &amp; Onyxia, then hibernate for 5-7 days.
---
For Alliance, probably Dwarf=Gnome&gt;Human, for PvP.
---
Go for whatever spec you want. I'd personally go for the weapons that complement the PvP spec you wanna play. So if you want to play a dagger PvP spec, go combat daggers for PvE, and so on.
---
If you don't play human, there's no reason to go for any specific weapon type during leveling. Though I'd discourage daggers.
---
CB-Hemo is typically played with Swords or Maces, yes. You wanna spec differently if you're playing with daggers.
---
What are you running? Grilled squids, winterfall potions, mongoose, roids, jujus, onyxia head and stuff? For MC?
---
They did shut down those sites
---
Gnome is better for PvP, Human for PvE
---
6.  Don’t be a warrior
---
I'm really glad I moved from Shazzrah to a better server, the horde to alliance ratio is awfull in Shazzrah for alliance. I believe it's almost a 80% Horde server now (maybe even near 90%) so why stay there? The server I'm on is still on the horde side but more on the 45/55.
---
My opinion.
---
Healer - priest, pala, shaman.
---
Tank - warr (maybe druid)
---
DPS - warr, rogue, lock 
---
Mage might be ok for aoe farm and utility - portals and stuff. But mages are the new huntards so take only if you are ready to be viewed a bit negative (noob favorite class).
---
For endgame, mostly 5mans, some gold farms, few raids (wouldn't expect to have more than 3 evenings, most likely 1-2). Otherwise just BGs when they come out and I hope that is soon.
---
Use an add on like bartender to easily bind your buttons to an action bar then copy this macro a bunch and replace “spell name” with the name of the spell you wanna macro. This macro will first target your mouse over being a raid frame or player,or it target you if there is no friendly target/mouse over.

I didn't say you hate them, just said that your post is hateful. And nobody uses "unemployed neckbeards" to paint anyone positively. Get the fuck out of here with your shit.
---
I tank as druid with a full dps gear in dungeons. There is no other way to keep aggro. Also tab spamming as crazy while swiping. It helps a lot but otherwise yeah, tanking is high demand thankless job.

Have you ever actually watched Jeopardy.  The week leading up to a major movie, say avengers for example, jeopary will have catagories about marvel and the like. It happens all the time. At least on Wheel they don't hide it.

Wall walking was patched during vanilla. Wall jumping was patched late TBC.

The age of fire begins in AQ
---
I feel like 5% mana is kind of bogus though at lvl 14 I think I have 350mana so an additional 5% would only equal 17.5 mana - is that a big deal? seems like I would need to be a significantly higher level for that 5% to even amount to a single cast of healing wave or what have you

adding to that you can type #showtooltip Ability Name

That comes in handy if you have stance dance macros and want to see the skill not the stance etc.

None, unless you're a tank. Then you should go for ~120 unbuffed. Volcanic set, rings, Blazing Emblem and the Onyxia attunement necklace is what I personally use on my druid.

Theres no reason to specc into 2h specialization if you're playing DW Fury.

Lashers are giving 70xp each at level 57. 7 lashers per pack times 8 packs is 3920xp per run. 5 runs per hour is 19600xp per hour
---
You're a shitty rogue because I just found you
---
Im not surprised if you think thats too expensive or not expensive enough. But shits crazy now that more people know about TSM and such, goldmaking is an integral part of the game, which means prices are ridiculous for some stuff.
---
Hit has certainly lower value for Warriors than it has for Rogues, even without using this technique.
---
Just use this technique when you're comfortable with, for example sitting at 50 rage and then slowly weave it into your rotation.
---
I find myself in the same boat. I recently rolled horde on a new realm and i’m just taking it slow and enjoying the leveling &amp; since i’ve never leveled in classic as horde it’s been fairly exciting and a new experience. I found min-maxing and tryharding pretty much killed the game for me so I want to play the game as the mmorpg that it is and immersive myself in my character and in azeroth itself. 
---
I’ll most likely will still play my level 60 alliance toon but only when my friends decide to play again which i’m sure will happen. there’s a few friends who stuck around so it’s not a total waste. I’ll still be able to BG or Raid with them if they ever decide to hop on.. but for the most part i’m playing solo on grob now, and as a new role player i’ve really been enjoying it! Try it out you might just enjoy it! Playing on Grobulus RPPvP

Nani the fuck
---
But he suddenly became a giant to do so.
---
More than half our team is ranged. We just use our melees are expendable additional DPS. As long as the tanks are alive, we really dont need the melees :P
---
I think OP most likely means "what are the odds of seeing a quadruple roll in a 5-man dungeon", in which case the odds are 1/500,000. IE {43,43,43,43,1} and {1,43,43,43,43} would both count as a "quadruple roll"
---
"What are the odds the first four rolls are identical?": 1/1,000,000
---
"What are the odds the last four rolls are identical?": 1/1,000,000
---
"What are the odds of a quadruple roll *in a 5-man dungeon*?": 1/500,000
---
Are you specced prot or fury? Because most of the people we're talking about here are relatively fresh Fury 60s who don't have the gear to be tanking. And let's be real; most of them are doing it because it's easier to find a group as a main tank.
---
I don't care if you want to spec Fury, but join as a DPS warrior. You are going to have newbies and relative casuals in PUGs sometimes, and if you can't make up the difference you need to not be tanking, even if it's far easier to find a group as a tank.
---
Also, if we're talking about what's frustrating; don't roll on daggers. There's lots of other gear available for you, and unless it's Felstriker it's probably not even an upgrade.
---
The real loot is the friends you make on the way!
---
It'll be post nerf 100%
---
Not sure how they would be. Didnt try yet but did DM:E with a full group for loot and all the "money making parts" of DM:E seem to stil be there. Herbs are there, Thorium nodes are there, blue drops from bosses are there.
---
The big "issue" with DM:E drop runs ofc is that you're making money based on the current market price. It's not like most other DM farms where most of your money comes from vendor gold and was therefore "safer" due to not being effected by fluctuating market prices.
---
Lashers got nerfed during actual Vanilla. We're on the 1.12 client so we're on post-nerf Lashers from day 1.
---
Nope - it 100% did not happen like this in vanilla.  Please stop spreading misinformation.

Remulos?

From what ive seen, shamans (in all shapes and sizes) have no issues whatsoever finding raiding spots... I'd take even enha shammies at the moment :/

Yes

Y'all ain't comfortable just letting people die as a result of their own bad play and refusing the blame, and it shows.

Idk what you tank but whirlwind gets used often when tanking 60 instances without big cc

The opposite, actually. I've only now started getting into WoW and it would seem that I can't stop spending. I just purchased BfA and another subscription month.

Deep prot with tactical mastery and 5% crit.

Why is gnome so good? You can basically take improved sprint and get the same benefit.

How does it look long term? Like few phases from now? Will gnome/dwarf stay on top pvp wise?

---
Yes you would have to sacrifice some damage for that..
---
For Healers it is not as bad as they don't rely on the weapon damage as much. Same for flag carriers etc. 
---
But for damage Dealers it is very niche
---
Yeah, but you usually are under contract under the person responsible for the company you work for. I covered that down below already.
---
The amount of hypocrisy here is too damn high.
---
Apes is the mafia
---
how can you do better than full aggro and additional mitigation?
---
Sort answer: Because you are cheating. You are paying for an advantage, you might not see it that way, but that's how most people see it. Is it allowed? Sure, because blizzard makes money for it, but a lot of us see it as cheating, and that's why people are annoyed by the ruling, and the people who abuse it.
---
They offered free server transfers to low-pop servers only. Nobody wants to go to low-pop servers.
---
"Forever ago" is now a few weeks...am I just old or...
---
I mean, alting is or atleast can be way more fun than getting to 60. IF you dont want to raid, what is waiting for you at 60?
---
Nothing. 
---
Running dungeons for BiS before raid only makes sense if you want to raid, so if you dont, there is no reason to grind dungeons.
---
There is no honor, Bgs are almost a year or so away, it has barely anything to do. Atleast alting is some activity that lets you see the game from different angles.
---
You should if possible always use highest rank renew.
---
its alarming yes .. my highest char I have is a lvl 50 warri .. but I dont want to even get him to level 60 and tank ... like Op said the biggest problem for me is as dps you compete with every other class except casters ... and as tank you can forget raiding because the dedicated maintanks there wont have any competiton .. 
---
so basically if you are not a MT in a bigger guild .. you are stuck with PUG normal dungeons which imo is the worst part for tanking .. even worse if you are behind the curve ...
---
id love tanking but right now its more punishing than rewarding ..
---
Try to look up engineering item called something like "dummy".
---
Hmm not sure what this could be. Is the depency named correct? 
---
Check inside the Auc:Auctioneer Folder if the files inside have the same Name as the Folder itself. If it is different - rename the Folder to the names used inside of it.
---
If that isn't the solution I really don't know sry :3
---
All of them
---
Yeah there was a guy that ganked my alt in wetlands lv40 something.. brought my 60 there and and killed and camped him, apparently a lot of lowbies were complaining about him too. He disappeared after that :p
---
people who play less then you are noobs
---
people who play more are nolifers
---
Because with most specs (unless you play daggers) you don't go deep enough into Combat to pick up Imp. Sprint. Even then, 'getting' two extra talent points is crazy good for a racial.
---
Gnome/Dwarf are the strongest alliance PvP races, yes. Dwarves let you restealth easily against rogues and warriors, and gnomes make your matchup into magi and druids better. It's mostly up to prefference.
---
CB-Hemo isn't played with daggers because Hemo scales at a flat rate with your weapon damage, and slower swords/maces do higher damage per hit than daggers. Though it's very offhand-agnostic. You can use whatever you want in your offhand.
---
How is this even a question
---
Dont go fire untill you start raiding AQ imo. A LOT of the mobs and bosses in MC and BWL are straight up immune to firedamage.
---
You wont have a good time in there. If you even get a spot.
---
Back in vanilla, it was DM for both. You just shift+clicked a person's name to level check &amp; that told you which instance. 
---
Since everyone was level checking anyway, this was routine. 
---
At least on Horde. I never saw it called VC until I rolled an alliance alt just before Burning Crusade.
---
Yeah, can't summon in DM
---
Exactly this - never heard that someone wouldn't get the dkp just because they are on reserve, they are usually counted and awarded.
---
Working as intended. It's to avoid you getting PVP tagged from AoE healing.
---
deadmines = dm        dire maul = dire maul east / west etc

Apes is not the mafia, they are not cross faction colluding. They are just farming for themselves.

Yes the Target Dummy, but it isn't very good probably won't hold agroo for more than 1 Backstab...

You can make some Money with it though. The Fused Wiring usually goes for a good buck on the AH and those dummies drop them

Wow hurt much, you are literally giving out about people who play the exact same game you are.

You will never meet them, you will never play with them but yet you are butt hurt right now, because you are not those people.
---
Sorry I found out what it was right after I posted thanks for the help!
---
Funny since Karate in my language means fucking.
---
There is definitely more horde than alliance. Every time my buddy and I ride around un goro we end up having a raid group of 10 horde come to fight the 2 of us.
---
I imagine you've spammed a chat channel at something whether its LFG or trading. I have about 20 people on my ignore list I've never ever spoke to and its simply because they spammed a message more then 3 times in a chat channel.
---
Why dont just put him between the melees and the tanks? They are across each other with Raggi in the middle. 
---
There is about 30 yards to left of the melee group that is open space with nobody standing there. Put the shaman there and he can provide totems without sitting in the melee group.
---
Harvest Valley is also a location from Dark Souls 2
---
But how is it cheating?
---
I just want someone to explain why you think so.
---
It is allowed to have multiple Accounts..
---
So where is the difference if I play on one computer with two screens or just two computers?
---
I still have to click every single attack. Every single loot... Etc
---
It is not like anything is automated.
---
So how is it cheating?
---
was there ever a 'blizzard entertainment' category?
---
If you look at the comments on the link you posted you can see some have used it with success... not sure what more you want?
---
They have removed most layers...
---
Some Servers have 2 Layers (not sure - maybe Faerline even has 3) but on a lot of realms it has already been removed completely.
---
On the others it is currently not possible to remove all becasue there is still too many Players (per Zone) I guess
---
Taelan you been stretching yourself out again!
---
Well in the group of four I decided to roll with it is two of us still playing (I think the other dude is still playing, we are in different guilds and he have odd work schedule)
---
I'm still below 40 mostly due to queue times still (playing on Gehennas) but also due to me prioritizing stuff to do in RL.
---
I have been thinking on transfering from Gehennas but seeing my choices will put me on Low or Medium servers I am not that thrilled to move (weekday prime time) (gonna check the medium choices a bit like how much there is on the AH).
---
Howcome warlocks are always wanted for groups?

Thanks

It's a meme weapon because damage mitigation procs are a silly concept

I had a petition to a guild called the kiddy phiddlers , a musical talent group that encouraged kids of all ages to join, I was lucky to only get a 3 day ban because some idiot reported me for the guild name being inappropriate
---
Some people just hate musical freedom
---
Ah, makes sense, thank you.
---
summons. but other things as well like for AoE groups they have the Eye that is always sought after.
---
and Badlands. and Tanaris. and Un'goro. and basically any zone.
---
The problem is more along the lines that you have to prove your worth as resto first, before getting gear funneled into you.
---
A warrior can get away with 10g in consumes (1 mongoose, 2 fire pots pots, done), while a shaman never raids below 50g in mana pots and dark runes/ has to farm demonic runes. With BWL coming, the consumes will not drop below 100-150g even on farm while the warrior still breezes through with 30g in consumes. 
---
Point is eles have to invest a ridiculous amount of gold and effort into making it work.
---
In North America the mongoose has been prevented from establishing a breeding population except on tropical islands. There they do some $50 million in damage a year, principally to the poultry industry.
---
Why are you even replying? It's not like you want to talk or discuss anything. It's just draining. Think you need go to look at this post and comments and have a long think about what you're trying to achieve with it
---
98% sure its a centaur, in case you havnt heard yet
---
Just Keep an eye out. Maybe post something yourself like "Level 60 XXX looking for raiding guild" optimally with your spec as well.
---
Otherwise (I don't know your Server) maybe there just isn't enough 60s yet or most of them already have a guild.
---
Just give it some time in that case - but I would defenitely post in /world and /lfg that you are looking for a guild.
---
You will find one =)
---
Just to let you know you probably joined a spellcleave group. They’re not your conventional trinity group setups, heck most the time they don’t even bother with a tank. Best you can do in such groups is swipe away at the packs as there rounded up and act as a bodyguard for the healer. You’re going to find it very difficult to maintain aggro in such groups.
---
He probably meant the piccolo of flaming fire or whatever it's named from Stratholme which makes people dance.
---
My experience on Mograine is that it's fairly close to 50:50, difficult to tell anecdotally of course.

Oh, that's nice to know. So it basically uses any sort of input to generate these requests and I don't have to click on a particular button. In that case you convinced me to install it again. :)

I think it is this.
---
Pserver bullshit. I would never join a pug with such agenda going on, if I did pugs
---
Its a numbers problem first of all.
---
In retail you have what, 6 tank specs/classes?
---
Warrior, Paladin, Demon Hunter, Death Knight, Monk and maybe even Beast Master or Enhancement Shaman if its not raids.
---
What do you have in classic?
---
Actually only Warriors are kinda good at tanking, Druids already struggle compared but they get the job done. 
---
Aaaaand thats it.
---
Alliance has paldins which can atleast somewhat tank, while Shamans can tank in low levels but higher levels are kinda meh.
---
So in conclusion you only have 3/8 for alliance and 2/8 for horde, of which many just dont want to try to hold aggro against some idiots that just spam everything before the tank can even build aggro.
---
Its unthankful, it makes leveling hard and its stressfull, so many people rather dont do dungeons at all than tank.
---
I wanted to play ele/heal shaman, i switched to enhancement because its quicker to level and i had to tank like every single dungeon so far except for maybe one or two. Shaman tank is actually quite easy but you dont really have that good defenses so its kinda meh like i said.
---
Nah people are stupid, if you advertise that you’re reserving an item then people can decide for themselves if they want to join the group or not. I guess this is an opinion based question, but I don’t see a problem with it, and I think the people who have a problem with it can start their own groups.
---
imagine being jealous of in game stuff rofl
---
It has all the pserver hardcore pvp guilds on it on both factions so yes , it is.

Sounds like someone's dad went for a quick trip to the Blue Recluse and never came back

Might be an addon causing it. Check that your addons are up to date.

You named all non-problematic zones. Not a single issue in any of those with horde other than a bit of fighting at pirares in Tanaris

What you do to mages, especially same faction ones that refuse to invite you so you can get your quest item, is pull extra mobs half way in so they die and get dura loss.
---
Shift V to toggle Health bars on allies, interface settings to include pets. Really nice to have for dungeon healing
---
BoP doesn't prevent spells and running in with Divine Shield is useless, since you can't AoE bomb as a Paladin.
---
It really depends on the game, most though, will only connect to other cracked clients. Some though, like that new infinite stratos game, has zero checks and connects to the normal servers.
---
That's not my point, it was just an example. 
---
But does't prioritising loot to certain people defeat the purpose of EPGP? Plus, who decides who gets what prio? A loot council.
---
Hey guys! Couldn't find an AddOn this morning so decided to write one up. Really simple so far, but please try it out!
---
Link here (still waiting for approval by Curseforge, link will be dead until then):  [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/no-real-friends](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/no-real-friends)
---
everyone who owns one eventually ends up dual booting it anyways so essentially yes it is
---
Isn't Gehennas like 65% horde?
---
I'd say there's basically 4 options depending on what you want to accomplish.
---
Moonglow, 24-0-27, is what you'll want to use for the best mana-efficiency.
---
Regrowth, 21-0-30, is what you'll want for must burst-HPS over a short period of time.
---
HotW, 0-30-21, is what you'll want for best flexibility with other roles.
---
PvP, 8-11-32, is what you'll want if you are going to do PvP for the most part but Swiftmend, which you get with that spec, is also nice in PvE.
---
Of course there's a lot of ways to go slightly different within the respective specs. For example you could pick up Omen of Clarity in the Moonglow-build for potentially even more mana-efficiency or Nature's Focus in the PvP-Build for anti-cast-interruption.
---
I'm 59 and still full-feral, so I personally haven't decided yet. Pretty sure I won't go for the Regrowth-build but the other options all are on my radar.
---
I learned about Asmon probably a week ago. I wouldn't think twice about "inv to Asmon layer". I would just disregard it as some weird trick.
---
Or you mount up on a normal mount and get hit by anything at all????
---
Looks good. Ill give that a shot. 
---
I havent tested anything yet (havent even tried ghostly strikes yet) but I read about how tribute is crucial to get near 100% dodge with evasion popped. You suggest tribute requires prep for double evasion and more?
---
lawaiiiii
---
Comparing it to a Jerry Springer episode is so accurate, wow
---
Possible but way harder than on private servers so that even some of the best hunters struggle and take 15 minutes just to kill the king. Add a few changes to trash (aggro radius, behavior, pathing) and it isn't worth it at this state when you can easily farm 65-70g/h in Maraudon from herbs + Goblin
---
Yeah you sound like a person who cried about rolling PVP
---
Is Myrmadons signet pre-reaid BiS for feral tanks? Or should i get naglering and ring of protection?
---
I think ArenaNet had an official policy regarding these posts on the GW2 sub-reddit, there were so many pwnages like this.
---
In grid-based street arrangements, "streets" are often perpendicular to "avenues," ie, the streets will all run one way, and the avenues will cross over the streets. Look at Manhattan in Google maps to see what I mean. All the streets run east/west while the avenues run north/south.
---
Please be Horde side. You guys need a priest?
---
I wouldn't do it personally :)
---
im amazed this made it within whistling distance of the front page since it's horde getting camped
---
Sorry if Im asking dumb questions
---
If hemo-CB is best pvp spec and its not played as daggers this means that swords are superrior pvp wise? I always thought its swords for pve and daggers for pvp
---
Cross faction love. So wholesome
---
Thats not true, you can see a world class NHL team at the Canadian Tire Centre... when they play against the Sens.
---
This big sexy has been chillin outside undercity all week on westfall-us.
---
mhhh not really...I can feel you as I am the same...but I'm still browsing the pages for my 3rd pinball machine right now xD
---
nobody is going to inv a lvl 55-59 player if they can get 60's.
---
Yep.  Never had this happen until EPL.  So many people love running through the farm fields on their mounts.
---
F.
---
Why give a shit. Fuck your metaslave bullshit in this easy af raid environment.
---
But we all knew what we signed up for with Classic. They where pretty damn clear about it being the 1.12 version of vanilla. So I dont understand why we're all shocked everytime we get a 1.12 "nerfed" version of some vanilla mob/mechanic/etc
---
What have they now "shadownerfed"?
---
Crusader is quite expensive. You say it is your main character - meaning you don't have another 60 to farm Gold on?
---
If you have plenty of Gold go for it. 
---
If you don't then donn't because otherwise your Mount will be Level 45 or 46
---
Hadn't seen yet as I'm not on reddit every day. Truly magnificent video.
---
That's bs and you know it. You could just as easily fire blast a warrior trying to summon his normal mount.
---
Classic.
---
Young, no family attachments, (mostly) unemployed. They've been refining the grind/farming on private servers for years and Classic is even more forgiving, so it's a cake-walk for them.
---
From what's been released of their comms and internals, it seems like a really, really uncomfortable environment. You're constantly pressured to farm or be ready for Un'goro duty or to farm dungeons etc.
---
It's like a systematic way to squeeze any and all fun out of the game and grind it down into progression-loops and dominating the server economy.
---
you should be getting bonebitter if you are alliance, if not i would go with either +5 or +7 weapon damage much cheaper like a lot cheaper
---
I got a video from WOTLK that proves that he shouldnt be this big and it's an scaling issue with his Height. knew it 3 weeks ago but cant post on the Bugtracker, cant figure out to choose any character from my german account in the english forum.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHrFZgJt3Zg
---
maybe anyone of you got an idea?
---
I was killing any horde I could get my hand on while levelling lock picking in Scarlet Monestary. It was perfect filtering of the people who have engaged in PvP and those who have not since it was a horde zone.
---
I wouldn't bother personally. Ravager (SM Armory drop) and Bonebiter (SM quest reward) are potential upgrades you'll have access to very soon.
---
If you wanted something you could do +DMG or Fiery Weapon enchants.
---
False. They completely removed the option of Torch Runs in BRD. Was 100% working the way it was in Vanilla.
---
Its a big game. To big to fully understand within months. My advice is to just do what you like to do and when you are stuck, look it up. 
---
There are a few type of items ingame.
---
- Gray items have no use and can only be sold
---
- White items have a use, you can look it up each time you find something. But 90% of the white named items are worth nothing and you should just vendor them
---
- Green items are more "Rare". For example an Tigers Eye is a gem that can be looted from early mining or monsters. Its used for Blacksmithing and Engenering but its still worth nothing
---
I personally have leared alot from looking up what items do and before selling them check the actionhouse to see if its worth something 
---
Professions is to eigther Gather stuff ( Skinning, Mining, Herbalism )
---
Or to craft stuff with the found items ( Leatherworking, Blacksmithing, Alchemy )
---
As a first timer I advise you to pick a profession that fits your style. Do you like to craft your own gear with the stuff you farmed? Pick Taillering for a mage. Leatherworking for a rogue or Blacksmithing for a warrior.
---
If you dont want all the hassle of crafting gear and collecting stuff for it you can go with 2 gathering professions like Skinning + Mining. You can't craft anything with these but you can sell the matherials you find with it.
---
Mind you that you can only pick 2 "Primairy Professions".
---
And there are secondary professions wich everyone can train besides there primairy professions.
---
First aid, cooking and fishing. These can be moneymakers but dont expect to much from it.
---
Raids?? That is a worry for later. But its basicly a dungeon for 40 man that you can do once a week. This is where guilds come in handy.
---
You can always DM me any further questions you have and I'll explain them to you. 
---
Don't get overwhelmed by trying to understand everything at once. Just learn a few things each day and once you feel like understanding all the basics. The rest of the information will be easier to understand.
---
I see your realm is exploring the alternate timeline option.
---
Lmao
---
Dude claims he was banned for RMT incorrectly. Explains that he grinded lots of gold for Runecloth Stacks, and used it to buy reputation and that faction’s Epic mount and was “erroneously” banned. Appears that a manual manual review confirms that he’s a sack of shit.
---
Like I said it's allowed. But you are literally paying to have multiple times the power of any other player.
---
Buy a lotto ticket
---
I don’t see it
---
He's right on the part "Oh, I've been abused when I was a grey by subject X, so, when I have a ton of greys below me, I'll unload my frustration on them and feel powerful!".
---
That's just dumb and it does have some semblance with real life assholes.
---
You can argue that one can kill greys to RP the terror of Hillsbrad and ok, that doesn't mean you're a dick IRL, but it comes a time when if you go uncontested and keep corpse camping people that have no way to fight back, then you have to realize you are kinda being a dick and just impairing everyone else's fun.
---
&gt; Ill usually charge + battleshout macro switch to def stance, tab sunder/revenge until i have enough threat then macro switch to sword and shield 
---
Do you not use things as flurry, deathwish, bloodthirst when you're tanking?
---
Sounds good mate
---
Yeah it's not like wow has been like that ever since tbc... Fucking dumbass.
---
How does it work out for you? I wanted to try that but I'm worried that most groups won't appreciate the pace since I'd need to position more carefully to pull it off. I've done it multiple times back in cata/MoP and it was far easier with much more powerful healing kits, zero effort aggro and self sustain on tanks, but in classic it's a lot harder to group heal from another window since you can't just spam prayer.
---
Some of the best fanart ive seen for wow.
---
They removed that from the tos awhile ago unfortunately
---
Weapon damage +5 is a lot cheaper and probably just as good, don’t waste good gold if you don’t have a 60 yet, a mount would be a much better investment when you hit 40!
---
Imagine being this clueless about pvp. I guarantee you someone like Xaryu would curbstop you 1vs1 mage with trash gear.
---
each!
---
In DM Tribute runs could work.
---
Aside from that, you are lock so you can always go and farm eye of shadow.
---
hey everyone, this guy has the burden of knowledge. must be heavy on your shoulders dude
---
I was a 25 year old American when I was a sophomore in college bio/pre-med program. Did I just shatter your world ?
---
What if I were to tell you that I know some people in APES? And that I know for a fact that some of them surely do no thave a job? That's why.  And my post isn't hateful, negative for sure, but not hateful in anyyyyway.
---
How did you make the mc'd guy attack?
---
My PvP policy is KOS unless:
---
&gt; target is below 58
---
&gt; target is a Priest/Paladin/Druid/Shaman in what is obvious full healing gear
---
Dear bot, the post has been approved :)
---
I rolled a warrior and I’m about to fall off at level 45. Tired of ZF runs, and questing is slow and painful
---
It is still easly doable without agrooing. As a 56 mage I can do all lasher packs without agrooing big elites.
---
Ontario represent!!
---
You think this is bad, you should see the fighting game community. They implement a huge fix that fixes the game for everyone and people are cheering, and still you have these fucking assholes constantly asking for a character to be added to the game.
---
Omg are they alliance?
---
Yeah i tried the hyenas, them being fast isn't the issue in itself, it's that gathering them all is wonky because blizzard slows in ticks and it's very commong for 1-2 to simply run through your blizard without getting slowed, and they hit you for 600dmg a hit so, yeah...
---
Obviously you can't have a warrior roll on the choker of the firelord.
---
There will always be checks and balances. However the checks and balances are worked out when the guild is founded and then tweaked as little as possible. 
---
My guild for example released a prio list in advance of the first raid and asked the warriors to lock themselves into a preferred weapon category. Me being PvPer am rolling on 2handers like BRE and Spinal Reaper, supplementing it with plate gear like Onslaught and Flameguard.
---
EPGP's strongpoint is transperancy, not that there is a FFA brawl. Nobody ever mentioned that you can't set rules well advance to counteract DKP weaknesses.
---
HOTW is a healing build, pretty much. Go that or Moonglow. Ignore Swiftmend or deep resto.
---
Search for “classic Druid resto” on YouTube, there’s a good video where the guy goes over 4 common healing specs at 60 (spoiler: HOTW is his favourite)
---
You shouldn't have to get a raid group together every time you want to farm.
---
Its against the rules, plain and simple, and Blizzard needs to make an example of them.
---
Talk about a wasted bis rofl
---
&gt; Weapon damage +5 is a lot cheaper and probably just as good
---
lol no
---
Mobs in Tyrs hand drop a lot of silver per kill, and some of them are very strong in terms of skills.  Many are in groups of 2.  You can walk up (maybe mind soothe to get in range) mind control one, and have them fight each other until one dies, break the MC, kill it, and loot both.  
---
You kill 2 mobs at once with little to no downtime, and they have great drop tables as well as the silver.
---
Azeroth Auto Pilot + ClassicCodex are all the AddOns you need for a comprehensive 1-60 levelling guide that is in game.
---
I eat less junkfood that's for sure. I also eat less food in general. The game is time consuming, but it's not all bad. I've been sleeping a lot better and generally feel better as a result.
---
i dunno about sarcastic but i think it's definitely designed to trigger with that shiny BRE front and center on a ret lmao
---
It is incorrect behavior.
---
Gathering mobs and running to a player and then out of range to make them aggro is called "training" (from forming a train) and it was one of the most popular ways of griefing in MMOs.
---
When WoW first launched there was plenty of praise for its anti-training way of aggro. 
---
Mobs should not run to other people unless they are in your party or they have used an aggro producing ability.
---
if only
---
Windfurry axe XD
---
If you press the printscrn button it takes a pic of the screen for you.
---
Wow nice, thanks for sharing
---
if only they had finished pally talent trees and he wasn't totally irrelevant XD
---
I almost always open my fights with Cheap Shot and I only ran Uldaman once then I lvled 60 by questing, due to that I opened with Cheap Shot when doing Strat aswell just due to habbit. My warr tank just friendly asked me to not open with a stun, I had completely forgot how their rage generation works so I was obviously playing it wrong just due to ignorance.
---
I was on the fence whether this was a sarcastic joke post, until I saw this...
---
&gt; **-This is my all in one attack priority button while in Battle Stance.**

---
7/10 trolling attempt, I'm sure you'll get some people taking you seriously.
---
There's a bad side to it. Like most nice things, shit people ruin it for everybody.
---
I'm wowed by the amount of people that approve the "mafia" in comments (probably involved in it). And even more wowed, that Blizz is OK with this, it's basically griefing.. Cuz if you refuse "the fee", someone from your faction is following you and reports your position to opposite faction to camp you.    
---
If I found out someone is trying to do something like that on server I play, I would never pay fees to such dicks. I would rather gather raids to keep wiping them out. And I'm not even a skinner or a leather user. I really hope it backfires on them.
---
for real it isnt even salt. might as well have DE'd it lol
---
I went there, and even brought randomers from Winterspring, like twenty times and never got banned.
---
This would destroy big world pvp fights for people that want to rank up.
---
1.12 talents and itemisation are a big deal why it's "so easy". That's why some wanted to have old talents and items too.
---
At least you can gift 4 groups with your mana. Try priest with 3400 mana fort and 1800 spirit (minus 10% due to talent).
---
Oh I kept fucking with people in LFG yesterday who would Ask if DM was up I kept saying of course deadmines are out
---
Twinking is fun when you are not the only twink.
---
10v10 and both sides having 2 twinks is fun because the whole team has to play around the twinks to win. It gives the battles a commander.
---
True, but if everything has been said about the reserves and they roll on it and take it you can open a ticket and you will get the item. Has already happened before on classic a few times.
---
There's Raynewood Retreat in Ashenvale
---
This is my struggle. Full BiS hear with an epic and full enchants. Epic mount with 500g and stacking in my bank and all professions done in 12 days played ( first runthrough). Now what do i do? Make an alt I guess?
---
You're implying that the alliance is full of dip shits who only fight unfair while OP is stating that Horde attracts more dip shits?
---
Stealth and Track. nice
---
dicks out for kanklecrabs
---
pickpocketting Dire Maul ?
---
how comes. they are either full of elementals with no pocket or stealth breaking hyenas.
---
what am i missing. where is the spot for pickpocket there ?
---
So just to be clear, both factions are colluding with each other, but you are calling out the Horde for this bad behavior?
---
You wouldn’t happen to be an Alliance player would you?
---
My class and weed consumption go hand in hand.
---
Trans trolls 😂😂😂
---
IDK, most BIS lists I reference have a lot of T1 in there. Obv. the 2 T2 pieces and crafted back and chest are better. Also the belt from DM:E. I'll probably run 3 or 4 pieces of T1 for a bit though.
---
I only spare people with funny names, thats it.
---
We’re not doing a 5 man. We’re just making a dungeon group bro
---
On levels 5-60 it’s 60:40. No one can be sure about ratio at high levels. But horde almost always got control on all dungeon entrances. This could ofc be because the culture has developed in such a way that allies just flee/hide instead of trying to assume control.
---
No, ours is very similar but replaces it with "Tanks/twinks encouraged and if you are a warrior you should be able to find humour in the little things" ;). Always Sunny in Azeroth represent.
---
there are just so many layers of shittiness to this comment it's almost like an art piece
---
That worked on an old version of vanilla, it did not work in 1.12 and does not work now.
---
Abilities sharing a cooldown (includes global cooldown) can not be macro'ed together like that.
---
Its a fact that they are unemployed and live on wellfare though
---
Ever heard of The beers? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Beers  they controll the entire diamond market. Nobody gives a shit.
---
Thank you blizzard 😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
---
i made teldrassil=&gt;darkshore=&gt;ashenvale and never ran out of quests or things to do. There is a ENORMOUS amount of quests in darkshore.
---
Generally this seems to happen if you interacted with that other instance of combat in any way. Healing a player who's involved with that combat, damaging one of the mobs, casting a buff, etc. 
---
I haven't had this happen to me if the mobs leashed on another player and I was 100% passive and just observing.
---
**De Beers**
---
De Beers Group is an international corporation that specialises in diamond exploration, diamond mining, diamond retail, diamond trading and industrial diamond manufacturing sectors. The company is currently active in open-pit, large-scale alluvial, coastal and deep sea mining. It operates in 35 countries and mining takes place in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Canada. From its inception in 1888 until the start of the 21st century, De Beers controlled 80% to 85% of rough diamond distribution and was accused of being a monopoly.

lmfaooo its okay you can just pick up another one from the library xD
---
I’m not saying that’s needed for warrior I’m just saying slow weapons increase skill dmg 
---
The hell do I know if that is useful for prot warrior
---
they could do balls out and have have him record a speech set for watson and have watson host the show.
---
I believe Ashbringer-EU is a pretty close 50/50 split
---
This is my case too. At a strath UD run we even decided to have our tank to grab mobs from healer and to tank baron, on packs I was tanking to make it less frustrating for all of us.
---
I haven't been doing tribute yet, not sure if I want it over solo BRD farming now as I usually get to 42-50 g/h without preparations, mats and stuff which skyrockets as DM was released. I don't know the strat but if you want to theorycraft tanking then something like that https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fZGxVb0VzxbZxrxohbo ? You could also add 2 points from imp evaison to parry for example or even max on dodge + go for riposte like this:  https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fZMxEz0VzLbZxrxohbo .
---
For someone without gold crusader is a dumb idea, obviously it isn’t better but still works as a damage increase
---
I actually can’t stop playing sometimes. Some days I don’t eat just because it’s an xp waste of me to cook food. Please stay away if you’re scared of getting addicted again.
---
Deadmines is still DM.
---
Nobody seriously says "LFM DM" only when they are looking for players or a group without naming the wing(s). It's DM east, DM west, DM north.

What guild was it if you remember?
---
Hurricane them.

 [https://classic.wowhead.com](https://classic.wowhead.com/)
---
most of the quests can be done north AND south, for example, the "kill stag/bear/cats" quests, as well as the furbolgs and fishing quests
---
CB-Hemo isn't necessarily the best. It's just the easiest to gear and play, since it's very forgiving on energy and works with most weapons (you basically just want a slow, strong mainhand). Check out Perplexity if you want some absolutely top-tier dagger rogue play.
---
Combat-daggers is very viable (even encouraged, for weapon diversity) in PvE situations, too. Rogues are one of the vanilla classes blessed with the most viable specs. Seal Fate daggers, Combat Daggers, Combat Swords, CB-Hemo and probably many more that I neglected to mention or don't know of.
---
Lvl31 noob, gnome mage with tailoring and enchanting, whats the best way for me to make gold so I can buy a mount?
---
Yeah but early 90’s puts you at 25-29 years old, bulk of people have graduated by then.
---
When you get so good, your own faction is forming a raid to kill you.
---
"all the way", lol, he stop at the border between the two areas...
---
It's not like I even need these, knowing which button to press and how to get to it is the main fun part of playing wow. Taking it away with all-in-one macros seem like the epitome of laziness.
---
Thanks, ill check it out after work
---
What type of gear r u rocking to get a intellect boost that much. I'm also 32, 18 disc/holy for the extra mana boost
---
Dont buy any enchant for it, you can get one free in badlands from an easy quest use that.
---
so it sounds basically like tanking isn't a thing
---
Waste your gold when you already had your mount and your 60
---
Say its reserved and set loot options to "need before greed" and dont take any other warriors with you if you can help it.
---
People who think vc is a legit term non ironically can step on a lego.
---
Blizzard doesn’t care about colluding. They’ve already stated this. Just don’t buy the devilsaur if you care this much.
---
Why is everyone having this problem? If I only heal the tank (and it's a prot warrior), I barely ever need to drink. If I need to heal DPS as well, I'll have to drink together with the casters, no big deal since we need to wait for their mana anyway. If the tank is a dps warrior I'll have to heal them more, but they also tend to hold aggro better.
---
i find pets worth a heal but not worth stress
---
36% with talents :p
---
You may not want to hear it, but this is pretty much the same as it was in Vanilla. EU players especially will not have any issue with the speed of this release.
---
Plus, if nothing else, Dire Maul is a good thing for players like you. It's just another few dungeons for you to run (with plenty of 60s to make for easier runs) and get gear/exp from, nothing more.
---
Yeah thats nice and all and the second you find yourself in a group with some scum thats gonna need when everyone else greeds and then proceeds to hs out you gonna change your mind. In full guild groups, sure go need before greed. But the second you dont know everyone personally greeding just does not make sense.
---
I gonna add one more reason:
---
Everyone farming same shit which have no sense for tank after few runs (BRD arena/general/golem / LBRS gems/ UBRS jed/rend runs)  as a Tank I also want to have a pre-raid bis Gear , but i need to farm Startholm(live) BRD(tavern) a bit Scholomance which much less popular as result I'm trying to find party for my needs, lfg trying to find party for their needs and we have tanks without party and parties without tanks.  
---
And OFC I agree with points from topic that pugs is annoying and I prefer to have one  run with guild per day and spent other time for farming rep or other bullshit instead of farming dungeons with pugs
---
In Un'goro, the Alliance guild Progress has been camping the Devilsaurs for days upon end. We gotta stop them!
---
Lmao, the "great" ones still pale in comparison to a badly specced mage who spams frostbolt all the way through nax.
---
Won't this just cast Bloodthirst when we want Execute/Overpower?
---
So is this only a problem on pvp-servers?
---
Don't you do the same thing in the barrens ?
---
I knew that story seemed really suspicious.
---
B..b...but VC was used for about 3 weeks before tbc release...that must be the right answer! /s
---
Reroll Paladin...pick consecration...Profit
---
You'll make more money of 300 enchant
---
Harvest Valley is a place from Dark Souls 2
---
If I tank, I’m fully aware that mobs don’t really threaten anyone. But healer will have to drink more after healing the dps, making the dungeon actually take longer. If there’s anything I hate about dungeons it’s waiting for healer to drink, and that’s coming from someone who pulls when healer is only at 30-40% mana to keep things going fast. Much better, and more efficient as well, to clear packs at 90% speed but then not have downtime.
---
Most likely to either keep a decline of active subscriptions hidden from everyone. 
---
Or so a realm with an Alliance favor, doesn't attract more Alliance players to join that realm.
---
Dkp for being online and ready for invite at raid start.
---
id put the consumables bottom right and change the unit frames. other than that, perfectly fine.
---
its always about what you want out of your ui. i personally havent seen a single pve ui that i really like. all that elvui stuff looks like shit to me. all those raid addon block way too much vision. the less there is on screen, the better it looks imo
---
Just tank dungeons. You’ll get xp and pre-bis all at the same time :p
---
Do you mean like audio?
---
Which makes sense considering she's a rock.
---
What is this weapon tho?
---
Not at all. It's phase 5, we are in phase 1 1/2. 
---
Maybe late 2020, but I imagine they want to draw it out quite abit. Possibly Q1 or 2021.
---
Isn't Olympus ran by that tall meth junky teeth rotting ninja Asmond? Says a lot
---
Depends if you mind waiting for the healer to drink after every pull or not.
---
So what you're saying is that their answer was correct?
---
100% Crotien.
---
As I mentioned, I dont have that much time to do dungeons. Got a new born 6 weeks ago (lil warchief inc) and its pretty time consuming. So most of the time I have to grind or do quests.
---
I don't think engineering works actually
---
"BiS" about a two-handed weapon. Now that is something that is going to be an interesting claim. &gt;:D
---
I think what you're talking about is called an action cam(era). I remember hearing about an addon back for retail that did this, but I don't know if it's available for classic.
---
The way it works is that your mouse movement always moves your camera, and you don't need to have right click held down or toggled. DCUO has something like this and while I hated it at first, I actually grew really attached to it and would prefer to play with something like that. I only know what the concept is called, but not if one exists for classic. I may actually look it up later and try to get it if it exists.
---
In fairness it really does get your blood boiling as Alliance that literally every horde quest there involves killing our faction NPCs.
---
I've been told that DM was nerfed around patch 1.9. And classic is 1.12 so its nerfed compared to old vanilla videos and private servers.
---
If you got a fast route you ca  still make a decent amount of money.
---
That casual « parachute cloak » drop. Been dreaming of it for too long
---
They took time off work.
---
Fucking rocket science to most redditors, I know.
---
What EU streamers ?  
---
All I know is Preach and Bellular play on Shazzrah, and APES are on Gehennas.
---
&gt;You can have 10 Druid healers but only 1 rejuv per target.  
---
You could have 5 Rejuv druids and 5 Swiftmending druids, that consume this Rejuvs :)
---
Last I tried the dummies were bugged and unlootable. Has that been fixed?
---
You do not understand capitalism if you think that is how capitalist endeavour works.
---
Would be more like : He took an account leveled up alchemy and set up other people farming for him while paying them for the work of collecting herbs. He invested time and now uses his investment and build up infratructure together with employes to make a profit from his investment.
---
I mean I could say the socialist would sit there picking his nose next to the alchemy guy and after he worked the entire day selling his goods would demand 45% of his earnings. It's equally as idiotic and equally as correct.
---
You get like 15 scales per UBRS Beast run.
---
Back in vanilla i got the 1st trinket by just running up and looting. Thought it would be easy to get the other ones. Nope, didnt get another obe in a year
---
you might have saved my day! thanks. going to check it out at home
---
Makes sense... my parents used to take time out of work to travel with us. I guess to reach their own.
---
Those aren't raids.
---
If you wanna raid = NOPE.
---
I don't like their videos in general, but the idea here and the music (!!) was funny! GJ! :)   
---
P.S. Come on. it was not the entire server.
---
Seems legit.
---
that´s exactly what I´m looking for classic
---
That’s solid drama, I know nothing about any of it, where can I read more?
---
How much Health and Mana do you need for ZF?
---
Did UBRS about the time Dire Maul was released. got ganked by alliance.
---
Then later did Dire Maul and seemed like entrance to both East and North had 5-10 hordes waiting around and not many alliance. But really anectodal evidence though. Our tank got ganked on the way to North, so might have just been a temporary thing
---
Stance macros and weapon macros are the only ones you need.
---
Stance macros straight up save you one keybind on top of being rage-safe stance buttons.
---
Weapon macros because the moment you learn Dual Wield the game doesn't know what to do with your weapons when you click them.
---
Wow, such empty
---
&gt;How is this hateful shit upvoted? Most of people in APES are in their 30s and have jobs/families.
---
citation needed
---
The lashers aren’t hard to kill but it seems they added more patrols in that area and the patrols have different paths which make the farming more difficult
---
Clearly no. As of today on my server, crusaders costs around 150 gold... appart il you have 2k gold in bank, you should not. you have a mount to buy...
---
Classicwow.live is another great free guide if you want a comparison
---
i don't know where you find these peoples guys (not only you but everyone else).
---
I play as a healer on the Hydraxian Overlords server, alliance side, and everyone is so nice, patient and competent (even the worst ones are just mildly clumsy) that i feel like you are all in a alternative universe
---
This was the one I was thinking of
---
You could on pvt servers, but that is not really useful knowledge anymore.
---
Yes, already saved ~70 EUR by not buying games on Steam.
---
That's really nice of you, I will definitely join that for when I'm 60 (51 currently). Is this US only, or EU too?
---
What we got is actually even worse. Blizzard removed the threat API so the damage/threat meters are now back to parsing combat logs. This gives a way worse threat management tool (addons monitoring threat calculate it based on combat log data which isn't very easy due to talents etc.), but damage isn't really affected in the same way.
---
I don't really agree with the choice to not include the threat API, it would make the life of tanks much easier.
---
Serenity now funeral raid
---
Nice one. The (no homo) is really lame, you know.
---
Very close to my experience too. Dinged 60 last week, have 750g now. Herbalism + mining did wonders during levelling
---
It is not against the rules.  [https://imgur.com/a/toQ8fwK](https://imgur.com/a/toQ8fwK)  blizzard literally confirmed this to me in a ticket.
---
I'm just saying it's possible to contest the mafia by simply outmanning them. There is lots of counterplay to be made, but yes I'm all for banning cross faction collusion and thus the mafia.
---
I'm on Gehennas.
---
Is it good? xD
---
Need a macro like this
---
/run SetCVar("groundEffectDensity", 16); 
---
/run C_Timer.After(5,function(self) SetCVar("groundEffectDensity", 256) end);
---
but to lighten my gamma so I can see those dark areas in DME for tomes
---
apes were pretty much everywhere around here when they slapped MC the first week the game was out. you can't really argue that it's difficult content, blizz made a big mistake releasing updated itemization and nerfed bosses from launch. MC and ony are kinda jokes not sure how you're gonna say they arent.
---
BONEREAVERS EDGE
---
You think you do, but you don´t ....
---
With some groups, I have to assume they have either disabled their group frames or put some black tape over my mana bar, because why would someone pull a boss or big pull with most of the party at half health and me at 10% mana sitting on my ass trying to get a few sips in before everything goes to hell.
---
You’re right, but at one point it did.
---
I can tell this has happened to you many times before, and that's the funny part to me.
---
from what I hear the vendor value is much weaker but they spawn more herbs
---
herbs which prices are crashing now
---
Winterspirg is 58+ but lots of mats are farmed there so it can be too crazy at times to quest.  You should go back and do felwood first if you haven’t Becuase there is carry over, and timbermaw rep farming helps unlock the passage between the two and moonglade. Only need to farm to neutral, but there are rewards for farming more, but it takes days. 
---
Aszhara is 55+ can bang out a quick level if you haven’t quested there. 
---
searing gorge, burning steeps. Are 50+ but you can quickly knock out quests since your a little ahead.
---
Strahth, scholance, lower black rock spite and all 58 plus. Dire mail just came out as well, 58+ will get you into most groups. Though some people like a 60s only speed run kind of thing. 
---
Even though you get some quests earlier, Wpl/epl are best started around 58 because everyone else will be 58-60. There is pvp elements to epl so everyone is on attack mode. 
---
Sunken temple is 52+, brd is best 55+. Both dungeons are long runs and require some knowledge or getting around. 
---
Lbrs is where you get your key (ring) for Ubrs which is a small raid you can start at 58.
---
gnome or even dwarf is very good
---
not human unless u love camping AB
---
Wow, congrats!
---
i literally can't believe the salt getting thrown at this lmao. this is so far from vanilla rag, we went in week 2 and we don't go near as hard as apes and the tank was dandy in half greens and half blues. i think 1 piece of warrior tier had dropped too. when he got knocked the other tank just taunted for a few seconds lmao.
---
Its all about the 25% stun resist
---
He is the HIGHlord
---
Same boat here. 0/30/21 and I'll tank if that's what's needed but half the time, it's pretty miserable because damage dealers don't give a damn about aggro.
---
so wand one then quickly MC the other?
---
Forcing VC is "Milhouse is now a meme"-tier at this point.
---
Still not as great as Darkwolves in Darkness Falls in DAOC back in the day \*grin\*.
---
Boost its resistance, 
---
If I’m not wrong that’s not a thing besides the resistances you train it
---
Last question. I'm not tanking in raids, so I want to use this in UBRS and lower. Could I just pop this DW fury tanking spec with my shitty gear, or do I need to farm some +hit items so I wont miss as much attacks? Missing attacks is the worst thing in this build right, since you wont generate through or rage.
---
happy to help :)
---
The concept of optimization means to be as good as possible in one particular thing. The moonglow-build evolves around optimizing the efficiency and throughput of healing-touch.
---
So you get everything that improves your healing-touch including Tranquil Spirit and Gift of Nature.
---
The regrowth-build is an attempt to counteract the druids' weakness of being sniped all the time since, no matter how efficient HT is, it is really slow.
---
Mixing those two builds together is optimized for neither and would obviously best suit a healing-style best where you switch back and forth between using HT or Regrowth.
---
Is that gold per hour including selling ring drops? The most I’ve gotten per hour from mara was 24g from drops and 16g from the herbs I made into pots.
---
It isn't.   [https://imgur.com/a/toQ8fwK](https://imgur.com/a/toQ8fwK)
---
As a dude in dogz, im fairly certain this isn't true. I'm not in the core group of this guild, having only joined a couple weeks ago, but I've participated in a lot of wpvp with them, and rather than colluding with Olympus they are really just ganking them relentlessly in un'goro with little to no interest in actually getting the devilsaur leather.
---
I’m a priest, I can’t catch up anyway :D
---
They're all part of one zone, you can even go between North and West while inside, but East is pretty much segregated from the other two.
---
&gt;Feral dps shaman
---
Shift to ghost wolf and run around I guess.
---
I see it all the time because my engage ability (charge) requires me to be out of combat. Only happens in open world, fortunately.
---
Like, naturally without farming? That seems pretty nice! :) Yesterday I bought skinning for level 225+ and forgot to see it costs 5 gold so I lied about the 25 gold part.. But 43 doesn't seem that bad at all tbh! Thanks!
---
I kind of want to do that just for the guild name. That's amazing.

Quadruple means ordered

Solo tribute is for Hunters. They FD.

My server was “low pop” once. Now I don’t have an issue finding a group for Scholo at 3 am. So fuck that argument

For a moment I was confused I thought  was in /r/Ottawa subreddit
---
I only kill gnomes. And when I do I camp them and kill them multiple times.
---
no, that's not it sadly, it was an actual machinima, not ingame style. Looks fun tho! nice bit of wpvp lol
---
This. In fact I strongly prefer tanks who roll in full dps gear/spec.
---
I throw on some plate gear to replace my leather and I can *easily* hold aggro against some very geared players. With cooldowns I can top dps on bosses. Fury just feels like a way better tanking spec than prot, especially in dungeons.
---
This is the 3rd most controversial post on reddit this week? I'm confused. Congrats
---
I used the stones to destroy the stones

I’d love for you to try catch my druid in an open World lol

Also this was with Inspiration, but I'm counting it anyway!

To make them even more unbalanced?
---
No, riding the Wintersaber tiger does NOT require you to have rep with Darnassus. You can also ride it with journeyman (75) riding skill.
---
Wait what does your reading and bathing habits have to do with this?
---
this!
---
DBM removes the last bit of fun from Mc raiding. The bosses have at most 2 abilities.
---
Warrior question here.
---
How does whirlwind + sweeping strikes work exactly? How often does it hit?
---
Lets say I stand in front of two mobs. First sweeping strikes then whirlwind. 
---
Whirlwind hits both mobs, so each hit triggers sweeping strikes to hit the other mob again?
---
So is it two hits total per mob?
---
From the ingame battle text it looks so inconsistent, sometimes there are more hits, sometimes less.
---
Even on Wow subs I can't escape the Sens getting beat up.
---
Epl is from syria
---
UwU shame I can’t mind control beasts 😉
---
&gt; I agree. Why would anybody wanna be on that server.
---
Because it's a big server that won't be dead as fuck in 6 months like a lot of others.
---
Or maybe the blizzard was made my ottawaians
---
i worked a couple weeks out there a few years back, the take-out was amazing. everything i ate there was fantastic
---
There's a "bug" with heroic strike that makes activating it after autos and deactivating it before autos if you are low on rage is beneficial, so an ideal warrior has heroic strike pressed down 95% of the time.
---
Just ask all the questions, listen to the answers and then form your own opinion. It's an old game, there are many players who have played it for 15 years, there have been many changes to game, different experiences, of course you will get different answers and opinions from different people.   
---
To be honest, WoW ist not that complicated, you DON'T NEED to know all the answrs to every question to play the game and have fun while doing so. It was designed for casual players. You can figure it out along the way. No need to theorycraft the shit out of it before you even start. Just relax.  
---
If you feel like you're really stuck, maybe I can try to help you out or give you a general idea of what to do other than grinding mobs and farming gold. You play a mage, right? What level are you?
---
To be fair, they ARE building lots of barracks and can probably churn out lots of units.
---
Need some suggestions for warrior gold farming (killing stuff turning my brain off) that is decent gold. Thank you.
---
Its just not very good in current tank meta. You want a fast weapon regardless of stats (hence why alcor's is so damn expensive). 
---
It's also too fast for dpsing.
---
 And the proc is kinda wierd &amp; nothing special even if it had a 100% uptime.
---
Looks good i guess?
---
I swiped the Taelan Fordring escort from a full group of Horde over the weekend and watched them rain hell on the empty room after I vanished out. They spent about 10 minutes combing the keep to find me but I was in the basement laughing my ass off.
---
How do you have a gun?!
---
I raid as [0/31/20](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LZVVzmLxoVoxfzoe), but for the most part if I have aggro on a raid boss I will have my shield on
---
It's a good spec, but if you are going to be a dedicated main tank, outside of an organised group who is happy you are running it probably best not. I run it because I am able to be a very capable dps (and can do world content), and fill a niche of being the highest threat tank in our guild.
---
A slightly nice bonus is having last stand as a dps can save you, but missing tactical mastery is really annoying.
---
In germany most people dont start university before 18-22, so even if they just complete their bachelors and not their masters and they would do it in the lowest amount of time, at 25 they would have just graduated with a B.Sc. at best.
---
But most people cant keep to the recommended timeframe of 3 years for a Bachelors and 2 years for a Masters, and its closer to 6-7 years than 5 years, so most likely at 25 they would be close to their first degree, but not finished yet.
---
Thats why i said, i dont know how it works int he US but in germany thats how it goes for most people.
---
Whats HS tanking?
---
I would probs break MC just before MC target dies and Holy nova to last hit.
---
When I was leveling I ran LBRS and Scholo in parties of randoms as 57-59 mage, no one said a word. Also while grinding Strat Live had a lot of 58-59 tanks and heals inviting on the basis on who's whispered first.
---
My hunter is lvl 50 at the moment and I find it easy to level. I can pull several targets at once even being higher level than me but I find doit one by one more efficient. I usually go running around with aspect of the cheetah and don't even bother on applying hunter's mark, unless things get tough and hawk+mark are needed.
---
Assuming you are BM, just send the pet and do auto shot - serpet sting - auto shot - arcane/multi - repeat. Mobs go down really easy and just move to the next one. In places like STV, Tanaris or Hinterlands you will level quite fast.
---
See if you can pick up a pc from around 2014/2015, these should be relatively cheap ($200~). The only thing you need to look out for is making sure the motherboard has a pci-e slot and a chipset that relates to something around the intel i3-i5 range.
---
If you can find something along those lines (should be fairly common these days) then you can purchase a brand new GTX 1060 4GB gpu and a 3.6ghz i3 cpu for roughly $300.
---
That will run most AAA games on med/high, with some exceptions running in ultra for $500 and cuts out the hassle of building a pc.
---
How many times does it have to be stated by Blizzard that this doesn't violate the ToS. It is inarguably not against the ToS. You're also referencing a ToS that was written SEVEN YEARS ago. People have contacted GM's numerous times about this and you can Google it yourself because there's so many instances and it's been repeatedly stated that guilds that participate in this are building a negative reputation and it's up to the players to stop this activity if they don't like it.
---
Do arena/anger runs, but say theyre xp runs and clear all the early trash. Best for xp and you get a chance at the bis chest from arena and +hit trinket from anger. If you have more time you can do emp runs and get force of will
---
Nice guildname
---
What add on are you using for that font?
---
Are the free character migrations only applicable if your server is full?
---
ah thx for the clarification!

people like him are the reason why idiocracy is more a documentary today... thats just next level of stupidity

"If you're fat you should be able to find humor in the little things"   
---
AKA "We gon' make fun of you because you fat"
---
I mean in the end it would still benefit the raid and allow Enhancement shamans to play, so im all for it.
---
Apparently, a previous member of the Olympus guild, Unbind, played pservers before and allegedly was known to do shady shit and randomly got an invite to the guild. He's been working with other members as well. Fortunately, officers from the guild did not tolerate his toxic behavior and he got banned from Discord and got gkick. But this will not stop the whole "Devilsaur mafia" thing, and others working with him. Gotta admit though Asmongold was defending him and doing the "Innocent until proven guilty" thing. He even made a poll about it.
---
I really want to tank, but I don't want to tank for 5man pugs for all the reasons stated above.  The piece I want to highlight is the competition for gear- When I roll on dps gear (leather / mail mostly) people cry and whisper me to die and every time theres a warrior of any spec in the group they roll on tank gear (and usually win over me lol).  It doesn't feel good to go in as prot and roll on dps gear or go in as dps and roll on prot gear imo.
---
Glad the warrior won it
---
From what I've learned from the comments here is that rets are not allowed to have purples and should be content with their questing greens in order to perform a self-fulfilling prophecy of low dps, and if they have gear then it was obviously spoon fed to them.
---
Meanwhile, the warriors should get all the gear spoon-fed to them instead
---
Just because it takes you 8 hours to go from 33-34 does not mean it is not possible to go from 50-60 in a day, it's just means that it is blatlantly obvious of how little you know of the game and how bad you are at executing it.
---
Hydra still dies to Rotgrip occasionally, despite being full pre-raid BIS + Anathema
---
Five feet apart couse they’re not gay
---
If you join as a DPS you roll on DPS-gear.
---
If you join as a Tank you roll on Tank-gear.
---
It's common etiquette. You're a pos, OP.
---
I think [Immersion](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/immersion) does this. 
---
It has for me before but not always. Might be an option I've unchecked at some point.
---
I’m heading to Amsterdam in a couple weeks and haven’t been saving money for it due to going out with friends and eating out all the time.
---
I haven’t seen the light of day since release and I’ve saved a ton for my trip.
---
ZT seems quite friendly for the most part as long as you don't meddle to much at the usual hot spots. The vast majority of [A] have tended to play non-aggressively, but then again I rarely venture alone.
---
Obsessed
---
Give man a fish..
---
The rest you can find here:
---
 [http://google.com](http://google.com/)
---
I do mark, and pull mobs back (assuming dps don’t stun/freeze the damn things).
---
But just FYI, hamstring while tanking multiple mobs is a pain.  I have to dance to battle stance to use it (losing some time and rage in the process), then back to defensive.   More importantly, it can be really hard to judge when skull is going to get low enough to run, since I’m tabbing between multiple mobs, not just looking at skull. After a while you can get a feel for how strong the dps is, and how quickly things are going to drop, but not in the first few pulls.  Finally, the tank takes the majority of hits, including special hits like stuns and disarms.   (You need a melee weapon equipped to hamstring.)
---
Combine all those points and you’ll find your warrior tank isn’t going to be able to hamstring reliably.   They can maybe do the odd mob, but there’s probably a better solution.   (Like pulling back far enough and having dps focus on one mob at a time.)
---
Actually if skull is a healer and you’re a good rogue, I’m not even bothering to sunder it, let alone hamstring. I expect you to lock that one down while I look after the rest.
---
Forget about raiding, it is literal endgame... Learn about dungeoning and all the other little things first.
---
Protip for my tanks out there. Skull the squishiest target, pull it, maybe hit it once for initial aggro, then let the dps go wild on it. 1 dungeon mob wont hurt them, and most casters have very little hp/armor (and you have taunt as a failsafe) 
---
While they gang up on it build threat on the other targets so they cant beat the lead you already have
---
Also different raid sizes and with colloseum, difficulty levels lead to a massive jump in item levels with later raid tiers that increased the faceroll feeling of dungeons.
---
Question is always kill speed to get to 60. Can you afford crusader now, mount at 40, are you alliance for bonebiter and can you afford Executioners Cleaver to breeze to 60. If you cant afford these stepping stones when picking crusader, the answer is a crystal clear no.
---
If you can afford it due to play the AH for a bit, then go ahead and buy it. Make sure to grab the exec cleaver at level 43 tho.
---
I'm level 49 now. Got like 75 gold, while still learning the important abilities. Also bought the 10gold bank slot and the 3rd stable spot.
---
What I do is I do the arcanite transmute. 4 gold every 2 days.
---
I did some mara and the elite quests in hinterlands. Found some ghost mushrooms. Found out they sell for 1.5g a piece!
---
Other small ways to make gold? Every green item I get and is useless to me, I send to my alt to disenchant. You can get blue shards from them, too, at a reduced rate, which might sell for 2g+
---
This is what I've done until now. No real farming, just profiting from professions as best as I could.
---
How is it better on warrior? Warriors go dual wield fury for PVE raids
---
Try Harder actively clears MC and Ony every reset. Only downside is on a raid night there is typically always atleast 50-60 level 60’s online...
---
I believe they are working on coordinating a second team currently.
---
Thurs/Sun 6pm ST
---
I wonder how he feels about Hong Kong.
---
My main is a warrior and I've gone for a druid as my alt.
---
Ultimately I want all 3 tank classes at 60, so the warrior and druid will be a good start. Plus farming on a druid is not as painful as farming on a warrior.
---
My personal experience as a Feral druid who actually enjoys tanking is this: I generally prefare tanking in dungeons because i can set the pace and actually feel like i am improving the party speed over time. However it definitely is more tiring and you get significantly worst at it if you want to multitask like talk to phone etc...
---
Thats a hard choice! Both are great!!
---
If you go mage I recommend at some point in your leveling giving aoe mob grinding a shot. I remember there was a zone in the 50s (I did this in vanilla wow) where's there was a pirate ship and you could ice barrier &gt; run on ship collect all mobs &gt; jump onto dock &gt; run to area where they all "funnel into" &gt; ice Nova &gt; blink &gt; blizzard &gt; blizzard &gt; possibly ice Nova some stragglers &gt; done. Rinse repeat, I believe I got 5 levels fast just doing this, but it's a bit of a finesse because you can also die easily bring a squishy mage.
---
Hunter is a unique class (not in that its uncommonly picked within the player base; because in a lot of ways it's also one of the easiest classes) in that you have to buy your arrows/bullets, learn the mechanics of feeding capturing and training a pet, etc. 
---
If you go with Hunter you will have two characters who wear leather which could be advantageous if say you have leatherworking on one of the two.
---
Making your own water as a mage is nice advantage over other caster classes.
---
you can heal just fine in brd as shadow and respecing will severely lower your solo leveling speed. there is no downside to staying shadow until you start doing more requiring content like UBRS and Strat and even then its still managable if you have decent +heal gear.
---
Uh, no they were Bay Area in Cali. Formerly, Condor Games.
---
I was Prot spec for most of my time at 60, but my new guild is full on tanks for raids and lacked Fury Warriors, so I recently respecced.
---
Every time I join a group that needs DPS (specifically as DPS) I get the 30min long spiel on how they really need me to tank. "don't you have offspec gear?" "have a shield at least?" etc. Usually if I'm not in the mood to tank I just end up getting kicked (not replaced by a tank, just kicked out of spite because I don't want to tank when I was invited as DPS).
---
Tanking for PUGs is frustrating at the best of times, when you are full prot spec. Tanking for PUGs as fury is just infuriating.
---
Lvl31 noob, alliance gnome mage with tailoring and enchanting, whats the best way for me to make gold so I can buy a mount?
---
Have you been keeping up with the vanilla private servers for the last 10 years? APES were well known and it was also known they were swedes living on wellfare
---
Its its buyable its never his only shot of getting it. If he won a epic item somewhere else he can sell that and buy the epic he need.
---
Some classes need close to zero BoE epics while others need 5. Everyone rolling for a high value item seems fair to me.
---
So is maraudon then.
---
&lt;NEETS&gt;
---
The audio team of Blizzard are amazing, at least the ones who worked with vanilla/classic audio.
---
It is! At first the latency was at 80 but i now got 700. leveling my warri will be even harder now than leveling him normally!  Wish me luck
---
Firefin snappers and oily blackmouths are sold for barely anything on my realm, too many fishers and too little use is my guess. Last time I checked Firefin Snappers went for 26c per fish.
---
It’s a quest item for strat live side.
---
With crafting professions you don't make money when you sell, you make money when you buy. What potions you are making should be dictated by what deals on materials you are finding.
---
Also very curious about this
---
I’m inclined to believe that the rogue is not only a scum bag but the one at fault but that is my class bias
---
Would using only "#showtooltip" alter the icon to revenge when available, then sunder when revenge isn't? Might have to use this one if that's the case.
---
Imagine even playing a fifteen year old game for nerds. Same logic applies.
---
Quest item for an EPL quest
---
mara is way more gph
---
I'm a warrior tank and even I agree. If that thing dropped I'd *ask* everyone to roll, because that's the fair thing to do. Why should I be handed a 500g BOE just because I happened to play the right class?
---
With the shortage of tanks you can make big money selling your service. I've seen tanks filling up there groups in minutes while reservering all Rightious Orbs.
---
&gt; Blizzard does not want your money.
---
No no, they still want the money, they just don't care if you're in the minority of people not enjoying the experience (and I'm speaking as someone who was in the minority who wasn't enjoying the experience).
---
I decided years ago that I might as well not play because I don't see the purpose of giving Blizzard all this money to not have fun.
---
Well i now have 700 latency. We‘ll see how long it will be playable!
---
I'm re-opening my ticket for two weeks now. Everytime there's a different lazy answer.
---
Dude you're so fucking cool. I bet you smoke drugs and fuck chicks on the reg.
---
The main reason I don't play horde is due to the levelling zones and cities being depressing as fuck, with the exception of Thunder Bluff.
---
Plus I enjoy killing UD too much.
---
Keep tailoring since you will craft your BiS archmage chest that will last to phase 4. 
---
Don't use enchanting as there is no gold to earn by disenchanting items until like 50-60+ items (you can also make an alt lvl 1-5 and disenchant everything... so you can mail it).
---
I recommend skinning (just vendor all mats, only worth putting on AH is thick leather?)
---
You will eventually get loads of gold by questing, spellcleaving SM, ZF, BRD etc.
---
Undead warriors look amazing imo. Great animations too!
---
I've set my num pad to all the raid markers, it help A LOT.
---
My two problems is that usually one of the dps that flat out doesn't bother following the kill order and the inability to waiting for the tank to build threat. I've counted five dots on a target before I get my first hit in after a LoS pull. =/
---
I'm not talking about MC or ony, just strictly Ragnaros. Show me a log where the the raid is primary 56-58 lvls and I'll be impressed.
---
It's Egan Blaster, a quest item for Stratholme
---
ahh i found it!!! its called "the molten chorus" and it came out in TBC (Its about ragnaros being sad that everyone is waaaay stronger than him now) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oLodvKCNuU
---
That guide seems to be almost identical to Joana's Guide. It should be fine!
---
And HoJ instead of   Royal Seal of Eldre'Thalas. Paired with Devilsaur's Eye (p4), lol.
---
Imagine getting spammed for water all day every day wherever you are, and when they say no to someone because they actually want to play the game, not just be a waterbot, someone like you comes around and starts flaming them. Expecting or even asking for tips when you make a couple of stacks of water is completely reasonable, and for a level 60, tipping 1g to get enough water to last you for a couple of hours is completely reasonable. If u farm lashers in DM, you're getting 40+ gold out of just a couple of water.
---
Works just fine. Just need big mana pool
---
This thing doesn't have much to do with streamers tho we have this mafia on several EU servers aswell. Maybe they got the idea from the streamers tho I don't know if this was a thing in vanilla/pservers
---
He's not stupid. He was trying to ride the wave of Blizzard Hate for karma, and maybe get unbanned if he was lucky. He knew exactly what he was doing.
---
APES are doing the same way on Gehennas.
---
How painful is the Druid 1-20?
---
I just remember back in vanilla my friend Justin played a warrior and was always broke and or dying..he always needed gold from me for repairs.
---
DM East with the current gear is too slow or hard for just tank and healer.
---
You need to disable the tracking protection in Firefox for that site to work.
---
To be fair I like that PvP servers has an element of betrayal. 
---
And it's player versus player, not faction vs faction if I'm going to be a troglodyte about it :P
---
And he only survives due to stoneform removing the stacking bleed.
---
Can the mods do a better job at removing basic questions that are posted to this sub and place them here?
---
Have you tried that?  A macro like this tries to execute all lines at once, regardless of their order.
---
Perhaps your server has a discord? Might be able to find recruting guilds there.
---
Awesome!  :D
---
Had a good laugh!
---
Just use invis post and run through the last guard into the dog pack.
---
Mother fuckers I tell you, content on s Tuesday evening...........
---
Nah, I play wow
---
You said it yourself, "there's loads of other servers out there". This is happening to other realms as well.
---
you are showered in gold after level 35+. If you are diligent with your profession, it will "eat" a lot of gold by going to artisan, and that's natural, but after that, you don't have a lot of "mandatory gold loss" :)
---
Exactly. 500g is 500g for everyone!
---
Citrine is a normal gemstone that has no inherent ties to wow other than being in it.
---
Forgot to add, some over view of your available gear could also help, since with OEB your hit cap is 6, this can be reached with 4/5 prices of gear and makes gearing verry flexible
---
The current raids aren’t for fire mages 
---
Almost all mobs and bosses are immune to fire dmg 
---
Once a raid comes out where this isn’t the case you can go for it
---
The only decent Horde city imo is TB and even then i wouldnt replace it for SW or IF
---
This was the first notable difference in how mobs worked from classic vs vanilla I saw. The other is how mobs don’t pull others when “attempts to run away in fear”.
---
In vanilla, if you got a humanoid low and he started to run away you better down him *NOW* or he’s going to pull that group of 12 people he’s running toward. I can’t honestly say I’ve seen this happen once in Classic, even when the mob runs right into the middle of an untagged group
---
But in Mara you don't get aggro reset by bug/exploit, you just kite.
---
You should remove the weapon swaps from the macros you use in combat and manually swap instead.
---
Consensus is that it is worth it to equip a shield in combat when needed but probably not the other way around in general.
---
man I was like you, HUNDREDS of days /played, promised myself I'd never touch the game again after cata. Classic comes a long, I'm a good \~5 years older and wiser, I'm married, job, responsibilities etc etc, I'll play in modera.. NOPE LOL, EVERY WAKING MOMENT IS WOW, I'M AT WORK BROWSING WOW REDDIT, I'M WATCHING WOW VIDEOS WHILE TAKING A SHIT, DO I WANT DINNER TONIGHT? HMM NO TIME BETTER HAVE INSTANT NOODLES... FUCK!
---
I'm having fun for sure though.
---
Not really a big issue since you never have that many buffs in the first place but nice to see them trying to keep the game as #nochanges as possible!
---
That's what happens when you fall for the "Yojama forever" memes
---
Omg I completely forgot about this weapon! I remember getting mine (was during tbc so not completely fair) but absolutely loved it and it's looks! Big grats!!
---
good old jmod smackdown
---
Wind-UwU
---
&gt;yesterday a priest kept aggroing because he was casting a big heal while i already pulled and didnt use fade at all, and he kept telling me to use thunderclap more because im not holding aggro. thanks priest :D
---
Cringe
---
The talent "improved curse of agony" with 3 points give you 6% more damage with this curse, but this bonus is calculated before or after the set bonuses of int/dark damage/etc.
---
Unfortunately, healers are not rare anymore and easily replaced. If you are lucky enough to get into a dungeon group, the last thing you want to do is annoy someone that might just get you kicked out. You are walking a fine line and speaking up and trying to fix things carries a risk.
---
I'll do it if I notice the run is in danger, but if it is just inconvenient, I might hint jokingly at a problem and gauge the reaction of the group (especiall the tank), but if that doesn't help, I'll try and muddle through.
---
Oh don't worry, I always tip, and I tip well. I just get triggered from the stuck up mages that doesn't even awnser. And or the people who market it
---
:D
---
BRE is a pvp weapon.
---
Really useful! A Guild Registry without server names column
---
Not that many buffs? Eh?
---
I have made over 20 different characters help me
---
Well not everyone has resources, time, dedication and organisation like APES. Imagine an average guild that tries to world pvp versus Olympus I - Olympus MDCLXVI, while their location is compromised by mafia members of their faction.
---
looks more like recycled old playable night elf models.
---
Warhammer Age of Reckoning was a brilliant world pvp experience comapred to WoW!
---
I'm not black. Take that joke somewhere it works
---
It definitely got censored at some point. I remember it as one of the more ridiculous aspects of the filter and a reason to turn it off ASAP.
---
Because people refuse to migrate off some servers.
---
It's amazing, an absolute gem of a game
---
That doesnt mean it is for everyone, and theres nothing wrong with that
---
Yeah honestly as much as I wanted to farm lashers for easy gold. I can see how a lot of the stuff PS taught us was basically abusing game mechanics that blizzard and the vanillia community didnt have time to find out. I would assume that a lot of those things would have been nerfed eventually if TBC didnt get released. 
---
If they did ninja nerd these gold farming things it would probably be beneficial to the economy but not the individual player
---
Being able to fly in Azeroth was rather nice, and updates on areas that had been in game since the start but there was nothing there, like Grim Batol, Uldum, Gilneas, etc..
---
Must be a good story of how you got camped by a gnome...
---
I think getting one item per raid is a great outcome
---
I did and thanks, I'm glad this clusterfuck of a thread brought a smile to someone haha.
---
It's not scummy. Look, in a guild run you probably should all roll greed if someone actually needs the item and let them have it, but in a pug, there's no way I'm passing off an item worth bank to someone just because they can use it. A lot of ninja looting happens that way by people who pretend to need an item, only to later try and resell it. 
---
Also, the BoE is worth gold, which can buy any other class upgrades so it is still beneficial for even a Lock to need on an expensive BoE for, say, a Hunter.
---
Hey again ;) my rogue is level 30 now, any tips for where to mobgrind some gold? :)
---
Yeah i agree about the limitations and the transparency of EPGP, but as someone who's been on both, there's just something about loot council that i like. It's less stressful imo.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Seriously tho, it's a bit long but nothing  it's ok. I did a lot of dungeons as tank or healer starting lvl14 so I didn't have to do much solo questing.
---
loooove me some mre reviews
---
Because everything is balanced right?
---
Are you named after the shoulder lock...?
---
I don't know, I did some Winterspring at 55\~56 as resto shaman and it worked fine - some group quests are higher than that, but as 58 you should have no problems whatsoever finding a group for those. It's a pretty nice, if a little bit spread out, zone. Great place for mining or herbalism. This is a pretty decent alternative as far as grinding/questing goes - you could also pick up the Hydraxian waterlord quest from Azshara and grind some elementals in EPL/Silithus or finish off some quests in Felwood if you still have some. 
---
Given your sporadic play schedule some dungeons are a bit out of the running (the marathon that is BRD) but if you got \~1-1.5 hours and a decent, dedicated guild group you should be quite able to push through LBRS &amp; DM:E, and maybe strat live in that time time. One of the three obviously, not all three in that time span.
---
&gt; Where are you getting your 80% Horde figure from?
---
my ass
---
Member of Reclaimed Virginity here. It is EU-Firemaw, Alliance! 
---
We are still recruiting if anyone is keen!
---
That wouldn't show in the logs, though.
---
Ask and you shall recieve.
---
Well this blows my mind. On trains I'm lucky to have wifi. If I do, it struggles with Reddit.
---
Fishing.
---
You can easily level fishing and cooking together even though it is quite time consuming. I had enough gold on both my characters to get a mount at 40 (theyre now 48 and 51), my time /played is going to be huge when i get to 60, but I've had plenty of gold along the way.
---
If everyone was honest, that'd work perfectly. Since there are people that aren't, its better to not give them the chance to steal from the entire group.
---
They definitely pull nearby mobs if they run away in fear.
---
&gt;And that not even getting started on asking for a fucking portal after a 2h long dungeon is done and your In the deepest part of lbrs
---
Oh man, those are the worst. I really lost my shit after an 1,5h Mara run where I (Healer) sipped 6g worth of mana pots. And that mage has the audacity to ask for 10s for a fucking portal. Because "iT cOstS mAtS, dUh!".
---
Yeah I have, and it’s BS. Some of them are swedes, not all of them. And not every swede is on welfare
---
First time I stepped foot in STV I got ganked by 2 high levels less than 60 seconds into the zone. Noped right back to Duskwood. Came back a couple levels later and never had a problem after that.
---
56 is fine for eastern wing
---
&gt;As an enchanter, I advice you to stop disenchanting until you have your mount.
---
 **As an enchanter, I advice you to stop disenchanting until you have your mount.**  This is the most important answer
---
Approx 55-60g/hr as mage, with herbalism. That seems to be the upper ceiling.
---
The fact that you're saying you had to drink up your own gold when you had a mage in the party. Those kind of people.
---
Hello,
---
Congrats on getting to 60. You can stop if you don't enjoy the game and have fun!
---
Your character will always be there, ready for when/if you wanna go back.
---
I started classic since I didn't want to level on another private server with a risk of it getting shut down (happened 2 times already, while I played for 100 days on another server with quite low pop, like, sub 1k combined).
---
So yeah, play what you like, come back to wow if you want to, or drop it. Life's too short!
---
Out of 4 friends that play, 3 are 60 and still going. And the one whould said "you guys will all quit before you reach 60" has gone back to retail and his char is lvl 32.
---
You sure you can recast the same stance? Just tried it and it doesn't work.
---
rightclick name, report player, cheating, "I think he's a gold seller"
---
I didn't say I was shocked, I was responding to someone basically calling out pservers for not being "right" when Classic is in no way "right" itself.
---
Classic is not the same as Vanilla. There are underlying mechanics that have been carried over because they're using the Legion client. In 1.12 Vanilla we had access to all raids and dungeons, PvP was out, Battlegrounds were out. What Classic is is a mishmash of different patches just as pservers were. Personally I much prefer the mishmash pservers went for and I know A LOT of others feel the same way but yes I knew this is what Classic was going to be like.
---
it depends on what you want to do with the 2nd account, eg are you on a pvp server and want to play as horde and alliance? or do you plan on multi boxing? do you have someone els you can play on it? if you can’t play multi box then it’s probably not worth it trying to play 2 characters at the same time is not overly optimal or easy
---
In a casted fear yes, but the pull from the low health I’m gonna run away now fear seems less dramatic
---
Awesome, i'm very close to 56, i wonder if i can find a group that will stick it out for a run or two.
---
Dire Mall is now open
---
Damn and i really bought he is innocent ...If they are scamming how the hell do they think they will get away with it posting here and asking for GM's...?
---
My pvp policy is this.
---
Night elves are kos.
---
Male night elf hunters are kos and camping for a bit. Hunt them down.
---
Hunters are kos.
---
Boomkins i won't touch, they are pure.
---
I don't kos healers.
---
I run away from shadow priests.
---
&gt;  You can't interrupt sacrifice with neither pummel nor shieldbash. 
---
pretty sure I interrupted him yesterday
---
Perhaps I can get some help here - I got lorti UI, and want to use bartender. But the bartender addon removes the blackness from lorti Ui.. like it doesn't work together. Anyone know a solution? 
---
And also, I tried dominos, and it worked with lorti UI, but as bartender has an option to keep the blizzard UI, does anyone know If dominos can be on and still have the blizzard ui? 
---
My request is that I want an action bar addon so i can change my right action bars without fucking with the original blizzard UI! Anyone knows?
---
This answer is absolutely on point.
---
Only thing I'd add is to emphasise that also all the other classes can do just fine as dps in raids. If asking for the optimal dps, yes it's warriors, rogues, mages, warlocks and also hunters in phase1 at least.
---
I'm playing enhancement shaman myself and so far I'm going just fine.
---
Take the stickers off your laptop, it's yours now
---
I'm not doing your due diligence,  apes did it and most of this subreddit saw the vod. You find it.  Iirc the raid wasn't even full because not even enough people were 55 to attune.
---
Not true. 
---
I made a new account on OSRS a couple years ago and got a permanent ban for cheating after about 20 minutes. There was no way to appeal so I posted on Reddit and got completely roasted by people saying I deserved it. 
---
Shortly after I was quietly unbanned after messaging one of the mods via Twitter, despite their "we are always correct and don't accept appeals" policy.
---
It does happen.
---
As a Syrian i find this funny and sad.
---
Not on pve servers muahahahaha.
---
I mean, I don’t know the aggro radius, or whether it is larger, smaller or the same as vanilla, but it definitely exists in classic.
---
have u tried elvui and just disable everything except the bars?
---
That's an insane level of damage mitigation! Wouldn't be surprised if in the open world, mobs hurt themselves more with Thorns, than they do to you! o.o
---
I hope the tabard is a bicep. With extra veins
---
That's a very idealized way of looking at capitalism that does not reflect our reality. 
---
It would be more like, there's a guild that accumulated such a wealth, they can invest into alchemist characters without much of a risk and so they cover most of the AH with their products. Occasionally, there will be self-made alchemists, but they rarely can compete with the guild. 
---
Herbs are collected by the herbalist characters that you can rent from the guild.
---
The most characteristic feature is though, that 90-95% of the population are either using the alchemist characters for producing potions or they too are collecting herbs, but the products will still belong to the 5-10%. The producers will only get a small fraction of the AH price, not much more than they can sustain themselves with, so they can produce once again the following day.
---
You sound like one of those F.R.E.S.H morons.
---
A "low" pop classic server is still going to have thousands of active players...
---
This retarded mentality is exactly what causes low pop servers.
---
This.If i could gank the shit out of my faction at least it would be better.Would KOS all Devilsaur mafia on my server
---
Hey I live pretty close to there and never knew that these streets existed!
---
Assuming your current account has a high level character already, I guess you could boost a character on your second account with the character of your first account (run two applications of WoW and use /follow in-game). Could be handy if you're doing a difficult quest or want to run a low level dungeon. 
---
But I don't think it's worth a second subscription, even if you can afford it.
---
&gt; WITH Herbalism, seems most people are averaging about 50g/hr. 
---
only on servers with super high prices
---
anyway the herb market is crashing now
---
I haven't! But doesn't elvis UIs bars look very.. special? :p like not like the regular ones?
---
Viel Glück!
---
yeah and using certain spells to help them like breaking CC
---
Same.
---
You can use a second account to sit and scan the auction house to snipe while you play normally on the other. Or Multiboxing
---
Haha as a hunter I like this
---
Danke!
---
you made that way harder than you had to
---
Which is exactly what I'm talking about.
---
Pff... gym
---
I mean Olympus is literally 10+ FULL guilds of people at the beck and call of one person and his subordinates. Doubt anyone can compete with that.
---
I think they could alternate the GM and make it work with 5 other players.  It would be a lot of /ginvites and /gkicks, but still possible.
---
Sad, you are now raiziiiii
---
this is not true, default is ctrl +1
---
Everybody needs tanks for every run.
---
Probably because most people dont have that time.
---
Jean? Is that you?
---
I'm 60, hunter, Beast Mastery, and I'm 8/16 of the BiS pre raid gear. Haven't run any raids.
---
&gt; You want a fast weapon regardless of stats
---
Actually I don't think this is true. At least on horde with a shaman in the group, I find it much easier to generate threat with my Axe of the Deep Woods than with my Flurry Axe. In fact the bis lists agree.
---
I will at home !
---
I log in and pay 1g for 100 lvl 45 waters to the first page see. Now that you can only conjure half as much at a time I'm probably gonna have to pay double lol fuck
---
Tried with a large and it worked.
---
Happens a lot in BRD spellcleaves, using abilities such as ice barrier would cause aggro, same thing with being too close to a mob when puller is iceblocking.
---
I was a little curious after this and had a look around on google maps. There's a part of El Paso that features within close proximity the following: Darkshire Ct, Southshore Pl, Thunder Bluff Pl, Coldridge Valley Pl, Shadow Glenn Ct, Winter Spring Pl, Goldshire Pl, Hammerfall Pl, Nighthaven St, Duskwood St and Everlook Ln.
---
That would be the thumbnail meta on youtube. Gotta have all sorts of popping images and arrows and surprised faces in order to sell your product.
---
Check the private servers price trends, it will give you some idea: [wow-auctionhouse.com](https://wow-auctionhouse.com).
---
I don't think felcloth and mooncloth will go up much.
---
Different story with consumables.
---
ElvUI. Right there at the bottom.
---
Defense gear is also a meme. MC is clearable in greens. Fury warriors in full dps gear can tank if you have good healers. Threat gear is all that matters
---
You‘re right i will
---
It's basically a weekly ranking with a rank being assigned depending on how much honor you gained relative to  the other players of your faction on your server.
---
It's a bit more complex than that but I don't know all the details.
---
I think it started with fortnite right? Or at least became the meta then.
---
Layering doesn't increase realm capacity so it has no effect on queues. Layers are literally just for splitting up players WITHIN the realm to fight overpopulation.
---
increasingly smaller and smaller ammount of gym if I may add... but I know for experience that its gonna end badly if I stop going, so I wont. You just feel so much better when you work out its not worth stopping over anything.
---
If the group agrees beforehand that everyone should need on expensive BoEs, that's not ninjaing.
---
I'll get downvoted for this but the game is fucking fantastic at 200 fps, max settings, and AOE density adjustment(howto on youtube).
---
So the graphics are certaunly great. If anything I would love blizzard porting over improved character models from retail. The spirit of classic is in gameplay, not in ugly blood elves ;)
---
You severely underestimate the amount of sweaty losers streaming to 1-5 viewers and clawing to get in a group with a big name streamer. I met plenty in my time on faerlina.
---
Quality chirp.
---
People like you are why there's a tank shortage on most high pop servers.  
---
Why does the warrior have to hamstring a mob when as a rogue you should have crippling applied in a dungeon that has enemies whom flee?  
---
Why aren't you using CP to Kidney shot a mob you pulled aggro on to mitigate the damage done and reposition when you've pulled aggro so the tank doesn't have to reposition every mob because you're running and jumping around, probably still auto attacking the mob YOU decided to burst on because you had 100 energy and couldn't fight the urge to dump it all instantly?  
---
As a rogue why are you not attacking enemies based off the tanks target? Do you plan on doing PvP at all with your rogue? because you're gonna be breaking a lot of CC trains if you are randomly guessing who to target and expecting a mark everytime....  
---
Your post is so obnoxious but i don't think you really understand the game well enough to even have an opinion on this matter, let alone call out tanks for doing the hardest job in the dungeon while being a babysitter for ignorant DPS who thinks this is retail and tanks can press a cooldown to aoe taunt to 120% threat every pull and burst 30% mobs in one GCD.....
---
awesome thanks
---
Bought 2 dark whelplings 12g each. Going to wait in my bank for couple of months and then sell for 50..60.
---
You can use Leatrix Plus to move the default character frames. Nothing will move them back.
---
The threat generation only applies in Defensive stance.
---
If you are 55-60 and comment about DM you are obviously talking about dire maul and anyone confused is being a pedantic a-hole
---
Why not just tell your pet to sit, go out of range so it goes poof and doesn't get hit with the dismiss penalty?
---
They don't. Layers don't increase realm capacity, so they do nothing for queues. Layers are there for splitting up people WITHIN the realm, to avoid overpopulation.
---
People also do this when it isn't, like when half the mobs pulled can heal and all 3 mages go oom without even one mob dying. Repeatetly.
---
Uhh, that will cost 50g+ in beginning of 2020.
---
Selling the gear from princess runs are the main way, but also selling ring runs, or mining/herbing.
---
That’s like the 15th always Sunny reference I’ve seen. These guys are very original.
---
Therefore ganking is BDSM. What's your safe word?
---
Which realm is so dead already?
---
Much serious not joke
---
I got RMT banned 2 weeks after classic launch, it lasted a day, then they reviewed my case and i have my account back, so Blizzard does ban the wronge people once in a while.
---
Kind of unrelated, but how do you pronounce "Gehennas" because the only thing I can come up with is "gay anus".
---
&gt;Minor, replaceable upgrade
---
What are you going to upgrae it with? Lvl 58 blue that costs more than most purples and is hard AF to find?
---
Dead mines?
---
DM was out at the launch of the European servers, what exactly is making this so rushed?
---
Strong no. Get weapon damage instead. Its not worth the gold. Unless you have 1500+ atm
---
the only thing that matters is how you do compared to other players on your faction.
---
Come Mr Bigglesworth
---
No, you'll get "your corpse is not inside this instance". But you can usually rez just outside and run in, very low chance of failing unless there's a hunter trap.
---
2.5k hp/6k mana
---
Druid in healing gear can fuck your shit up if you’re not careful.
---
They also didn’t give most of the mobs their abilities and the like because hey had to manually enter them.
---
Warlock\`s damage is 90% shadow  or even more, unless you\`re going for a meme fire build.
---
The prices vary but you can also look into fishing up Winter Squid  to cook. They give a 10 Agility buff and are only available until some time in March. In Kirtonos they currently average 50s a piece on horde side, but the price will climb in the off months when you (hopefully) have been able to stockpile some! 
---
It requires 240 cooking though, and the recipe comes from the fishermen vendor in Steamwheedle Port in Tanaris!

---
I've been a Gladiator so I doubt it. He'd beat me at even gear though. Why are you guys so fragile you think my comment is directed to your skill level?
---
I need advice for finding the tomes I got no idea where to look exactly
---
There's not much room for individual skill in these. If you watch these videos, people aren't even doing anything but run in and pop sappers/spam aoe. Small scale skirmishes are much more skill intensive.
---
I have a feeling that there is a max amountif ppl on a server allowed and layering will increase thatsaid amount. We have to have thereal answer fromblizzfirst tho
---
I've seen people doing it with 3 people though.
---
Making points? Lol.  Im well aware of the selfishness of people with boe's and their reasoning. We're just a couple of blokes commenting on it being a new dynamic this go around thats all.  
---
Have fun pugging dm with less available tanks.
---
Best eu server to start an ally?
---
I've been running as 0/31/20 for a while, and while it does hurt a bit, it's mostly OK. Charge, Demo Shout, Thunder Clap, Berseker Stance, Berserker Rage, Defensive Stance and then stay there for the rest of the fight.
---
Mostly sucks for Mocking Blow and Hamstring, but Piercing Howl mitigates half that.
---
I'll take it over full prot with basically no ability to solo.
---
I already got mine on my twink :)
---
&gt; there's a quested Ring that flat out beats this
---
Breaking news: you wear TWO rings.
---
Min level is 17-18 so you should be just fine.
---
Very nice. Forgot all about the whelplings.
---
Im also pretty sure without the - it would be a Turkish name :D
---
Ooooooh

2 bars from 58, druid healer. Have every possible thing I want from BRD par the robes emperor drops and the gloves off priestess. Is it worth it to still run BRD, or should I move on? I know Rivendare has a better chest, but I'm unsure about the I'd go healing strath
---
How long is Robe Of Winter night viable for a Warlock?
---
What are some other items that would last a long timr thag you can buy off AH? 
---
I'm someone  who cant really commit to a raiding schedule but wants to be decently PVP geared
---
What pieces exactly?  
---
Gonna azume that you have access to T2 head and legs if you have access to T1 so here's my thoughts on the T1 pieces:  
---
Head: T2 way better, Cassandras Grace and Green Lens of Healing also better.  
---
Shoulders: Yes, would use this at this time.  
---
Chest: Truefaith Vestements and Robes of the Exalted both better.  
---
Bracers: Another item I would probably use atm, you can get better +healing green loot and the +33 healing random enchant from BRD is also better.  
---
Gloves: Hands of the Exalted Herald from princess in BRD better.  
---
Belt: Whipvine Cord from last boss DM:E better.  
---
Legs: T2, Padre's Trousers and Senior Designer's Pantaloons better.  
---
Boots: Boots of the Full Moon from second to last boss DM:N better.  
---
Before DM I would go for Shoulders, Bracers and Boots for the 3/8 set-bonus. After DM Shoulders and Bracers are stil some of your best bets, but then the third piece would vary a bit depending on if you're missing some of the other "BIS" items.  
---
But yeah, any BIS list that has a lot of T1 in it I would question heavly. Some of them are probably not up to date with the updated loot for Classic if they are lists that existed during pservers.
---
with full world buffs and buffs generally you have so much rage its possible to heroic strike most main hand attacks. Sometimes 100% even if you are horde.
---
The aoe aggro from consecrate is extremely helpful. I mean you could do fine tanking without it (you are god tier if you can ) but it makes paladin tanking trivially easy.  For 11 points it's a no-brainer
---
So many of these posts now! Dire Maul; since they kind of share initials, some people refer to Deadmines as VC, for "van Cleef".
---
The DM you see spam about now is Dire Maul, the 55+ dungeon in Feralas.
---
sänk ju for träwelling wis Deutsche Bahn!
---
I cant speak for hunter, but for locks no don't bother healing them, unless it's the voidwalker acting as a tank/off tank.
---
just dont give a fuck. dps pulled aggro and you have to chose tank or dps? let them die. you got aggro because of that and died? now you have 2 different people to flame, the dps that did this and the tank that didnt do his job. 
---
on the other hand, that is the most fun you can have while healing. if everything goes according to plan, its boring and sometimes even feels like a waste to bring a healer. but if all hell breaks loose, you suddenly have to use your whole kit, make clutch decisions and be the only reason the group is still alive. 
---
the best healer i ever played with was a holy pally from for the horde. we tried to kill dreamwalker 25 man in icc, but the group was just too bad. either we couldnt stay alive long enough, or we couldnt heal him enough. after 1 healer left some1 said that he got the world best holy pally to help us. the fight was the same desaster as before, but just before the last phase the new holy pally just shouted "GIVE ME BL I DO THIS SHIT SOLO". and off he went. i think 1-2 people where alive at the end, after he solo healed more in 1 phase than the whole raid got done before. he was the only reason why we got loot that day and it inspired me to try healing myself. and i can say, those situations are the only ones where i really like healing.
---
Solution?
---
Don't buy Devilsaur.  No market to sell to will kill their business.
---
I wouldn’t call this “luckily”. If feral’s dmg was based on weapon dmg you wouldn’t need to farm gnomeregan in the first place
---
Oh I know. I was just joking 😆
---
Youtube.
---
Using Chrome.
---
Tried on phone through Joey and it worked.
---
Just don't buy devilsaur... particularly as a rogue or hunter, you are gonna replace that shit in MC. Fury warriors need it more but as easy as the content is you really don't need it.
---
&gt;H Shattered Halls! Still my favourite WoW experience was tanking that with my wife and friends pre-nerf. Nail biting the whole time.
---
I remember having this conversation with an in-game friend at the time (guy named Narruto). He was all about how shattered halls needed a lot of CC. So I put on my tanking gear (mind you, it was shit, but I had 2 tier4 pieces) and I went there. Alone. I just equipped the sporeggar shield instead of my regular shield (for damage, really) and I made this video for him.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW2EJpriM1E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW2EJpriM1E)
---
You're welcome to look at the date of the upload. That was during BC and it was on "retail", not some "private server". 
---
BC heroics required no CC. It may have been nice/useful in certain situations, but it wasn't REQUIRED. A warrior with mediocre gear (say 4 epics and blues) could tank them with no issues whatsoever.
---
The reason why que's got shorter in the first few weeks is because they increased realmpop caps in the first (second?) Week. That alone should be a giveaway that layering has nothing to do with that cap
---
This literally made tanks lose buffs in raids. Having regular enchants on chest, boots, bracers, gloves, weapon, shield and cloak would eat up 7 slots. Head, shoulder, pants and other item-based enchants still eat up slots by design.
---
So purely based on your kit, you already lose 10 slots easily. Add all necessary tank buffs, flasks and pots to the mix and you can see how simple heal over time spells would pote tially push off your more important or expensive buffs.
---
Most of them have proper jobs in the real world lol.
---
Seems like you are a bit tilted.
---
I have no policy. I do what I want.
---
So I’m a greens/wetlands geared hunter and I hate feeding my pet too
---
man am I glad I didn't roll on a streamer realm.
---
Provided you have done the MC attunement and any Royal Rescue stuff that you might want to get done there, leave the place and don't look back. 
---
58 is fine for healing any dungeon in the game, pretty much. Check out some other places - Dire Maul just released last night, some tasty pieces in there.
---
This is why on my rogue I take a few seconds to pickpocket every mob. Almost never get aggro and get extra loot to boot!
---
It's interesting. My question is, why can you even see the name of the opposite faction. Let alone their guild etc.
---
If you can't talk to then, how would you know their name?
---
So what you mean is, blizz should ban anyone who doesn't use the voice software and chat channels, in the blizz launcher? Gotcha....
---
It's to late to get rid of things like discord, and you can't ban people for using a third party app for communications, all of a sudden.
---
Take my upvote and go fuck yourself.
---
Oh you, adding in the /s afterwards! 
---
Hard to know who's serious and who isn't at this time.
---
If it is a large enough problem you can form a raid group to go deal with the mafia. And kill them for a couple hours while you get some leathers.
---
This is the best one! #nochanges
---
If we have X amount of days without queues on prime time. They close a layer. This continues untill layers are gone or phase 2 arives.
---
When phase 2 arives there will be queues and they will stay forever if the servers stays being overcrowded.
---
I had a group for strat who gave me every orb, even though I only asked for the first one. No complaints either and all around chill run. They said it was better than waiting 2 hours for another tank.
---
There are a lot of advantages. You can boost yourself, Level up 2 chars at the same time via multiboxing, having a bank char on your 2nd acc so you can trade with him, scan AH on 2nd screen, enchant your own gear (if you have enchanting on both accs)
---
Ice Cold Milk and Linen Bag as well 😂😄😅
---
Yeah, I have just started tanking lower level instances because hey are just chill. I don’t have to worry to much and can just relax, take a few minutes to type and joke around while still pulling at a good pace. It’s what tanking should be rather than stress.
---
Its an ancient meme from the bodybuilding.com forums.
---
My guild, particulalry our leader, gets an insane amount of pleasure at killing you guys. Doesn't matter what we are doing, if he sees Alliance piorities are shifted to destroying y'all.
---
What's the draw in doing tribute runs, other than the buffs at the end? It seems there's more desirable loot in the actual guard loot tables compared to the tribute chest (cough sublime wristbands cough), and you can get the basic stuff like mana potions just by leaving the mage alive on the last boss.
---
Yeah, I forgot the /s was a thing. Just in case I get more explanations hehe
---
Nop, a dude here.
---
Image taken from /r/funny /u/fjordfi2 :)

The only people that want to be there are wannabe streamers and childish fanboys. Like people actually sat in 5 hour queues just to spend their time following around an internet "friend". My buddy wanted to start streaming so he rolled Faerlina and the rest of us just kinda followed. He was playing like 18 hours a day with a big streamer just aoe clearing dungeons for them while the streamer sat in the back and talked to chat. My buddy still only gets like 2 viewers average even though he is constantly in a party with a 10k+ streamer. They just don't shout him out or host him or anything, I really don't get what his endgame is but hes still at it.
---
 Anyway we all rerolled on Thunderfury (best server NA) and constantly call him a dumbass for sticking to that shithole server.
---
Here's a cool tip for tendris, bring a warlock or shaman, nuke boss down 
---
. Die then red. Saves you a shit ton of time running round that place.
---
I've tanked &gt;90% of the dungeons I've done.
---
I just belive that as long as you didn't specify anything beforehand, anyone who can reasonably use the loot should be able to need on it.
---
Nice hiss
---
You have to use sunder to bind them to you in the beginning because all the other skill cost too much or make to little aggro.
---
WoWheads rotation is meh at best. They dont even mention that you stack sunder armor to 5 on a boss before you start with anything else. Their AoE tank "rotation" is uttlery messed up and relies on engineering explosives and spamming demo shout(bad idea since first patch).
---
What's your thoughts on horse racials. I like raiding so I was thinking rolling palomino warrior but pvp has its moments so I was thinking clydesdale rogue maybe...
---
I really should've added that to my first comment. In every group I'm in, rules like that are established before the run even starts just so everyone knows what is expected.
---
We were wallwalking w/Levitate in Wotlk mate
---
Heroic Strike
---
I must've gotten shafted, then. Only got like 3 pieces each of the good grey loot they drop... guess I'll go back and give it a go again!
---
Well, just the loot and buffs. You can also buy some special alcohol from Stomper Kreeg.
---
My favourite one would be the Night Elven forest theme.
---
Oh you mean that exploit some people do. YOu dont need to do it at all to farm ZF.
---
That's incredible! I had no idea
---
&gt; I'm lvl 32 myself and I seldom meet anyone above 35 when leveling in Shimmering Flats.
---
Dude, come on, what are talking about? I am 59 and i met people in all zones and was able to find someone to do important elite quests with... and I play on the least populated server.
---
&gt;Phase 2 already announced coming in December, I just might quit right now if I don't make it to 60 in time.
---
What? How does that affect you and your leveling? People started playing in the middle of vanilla or later expansions and still were able to get in raids and whatnot. Why do you think you need to quit because you may not manage to get to 60 by the time phase 2 starts? I think you are overreacting little bit, but it's not just you, feels like half of the people on the forums.
---
You don't get to do dungeons at 14 on alliance side.
---
Ok
---
Sounds like account sharing to me mate, that's a big no no.
---
#nochanges hahahah troll? So many changes i cant count for example.. if u Craft Stuff and sell it will interrupt the cast, layers (omfg what a big gemachanger was this?! But ok Cause they Saved Money) u cant duel in ironforge Jump about the latern in sw under sw (back then i COULDNT Walk allong the latern w/o seeing someone trying to get up there) this leewärts thing that actually helped ppl with lags makes everythine to lag now more then back then ( as mage for example got 3/3 imp blizz and mobs actually can Walk threw complete blizzard w/o getting slowed now i ask u how did they do Farm dm n back then) there are so much more #nochanges failed so hard
---
[Robe of the Void] (https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14153/robe-of-the-void) is better, and gives you quite a money sink for a while.
---
I mean, you seem to get the same amount of loot, just a different loot table. Not sure if it's worth all the materials for RP elements/doing risky skips.
---
I think what he is outlining is that the more popular classes, will pay more on average for their class loot than others. Say a core with 40 people. 8 of these are priest, 2 of these druids. The priest will have a higher DKP spend per class loot, than the two druids, which in turn means the 2 druids will have higher chance of getting the staffs, trinkets, rings and what not.   
---
Also I'm completely neutral as to what system is best.
---
Sorry but who is the beggar already in your story? 
---
All I see is an entitled prick wanting someone else's time/money for free
---
I was switching back and forth between weapons as a rogue and it takes about 2-3 seconds to be able to attack again.  Not sure if it will only be 2-3 seconds to use your ability.
---
When I switch into my spirit set armor it is equipped immediately
---
If you do a lot of trading between bank alts it can be very useful since you can skip the mail delay time.
---
I also allows you to check AH prices on drops you get on your main, if you place an alt on the second account in a Capital City
---
You can reset your own Dungeons either for solo play or in Dungeons groups and make use of the teleportation trick to get back to the start of Dungeons.
---
If you plan on twinking in classic it is also super helpful because you can boost yourself and dont have to depend on friends doing it or paying gold for someones service.
---
If you are an enchanter it allows you to enchant your own characters on the second account
---
These are the benefits i found so far running two accounts since launch
---
That's my experience aswell. Doesn't do shit for taking aggro off an enemy you're already fighting, but rather helps when you accidently pull more than intended, to keep the extras busy
---
Had the exact same thing happen to me, was wrongfully banned from OSRS and spent close to a month trying to get someone from Jagex to take a look at my case. Their customer support was basically non existent and my thread got no traction on their subreddit since everyone there just assumes you're obviously lying. Thankfully I wasn't as invested into the game as you were but yeah no way I'm going back to that game if something like that can happen
---
Ah, this is why I can loot mobs twice sometimes! I thought autolooting in combination with faster looting addons would be wonky!

Bullying (text or camping you) you out of the zone is quite literally under the harrassment rule.

 You could do trib runs and take the BoPs that no one needs.
---
I'll  happily heal quick trib runs if I can take the mana pots from chest.
---
I thought it was coming out like 24 hours later lol
---
What i dont understand is, people cleared mc\ ony without devilsaur gear, now tribute runs will make them even easier, so if theres no demand for devilsaur gear shouldnt the price be pretty low enough that its not worth the hassle?
---
WoW has made me smoke more :/
---
zf has 40-49 twink items
---
They implemented AzeriteUI into Classic? Gotta check it out!
---
That makes a lot of sense when you put it that way.
---
Cosplay too good
---
Sadly, that's the impression I've gotten during questing as well. Everyone's just looking out for themselves. Unless you're really playing with a group of closer friends noone will come and get out of their way for 5-10minutes to help someone. One's gotta be lucky and be there at the same time someone else does this stuff, otherwise one's doomed.
---
Daggers are shit tank weapons on classic, alcor isnt good. They were op on private servers because the way rage generated on there was broken.
---
It shows as "&lt;name&gt; gestures strangely" or something like that. It involves strange gestures, at least.
---
Could a solution to this just be that while DKP is used as currency, there is still a council deciding which classes get to bid on what? So, warriors are prio on Thunderfury etc.
---
how did you get the paladin mount on a warrior? :O
---
How are you boosting your 2nd account alt?
---
Or you can suck my dick cause I always tip 1g per stack. I ever said I was cheap, I just have a problem with bitch as mages, like you.
---
I kindly ask for water, if they show they are willing to give, so shall I.
---
You need to create a profile and set stat weights for that to work.
---
You can get a really good gaming laptop that will play classic in flawless 60 fps and most AAA titles in 60fps(with 6/10 visual settings) for about 800-900 . 
---
Pretty much any 2019 gpu on a laptop is nothing but scam. Get a laptop which has  gpu of in between 1050ti and 1080 and you will have perfectly good laptop for less than a 1k. 
---
Just be careful with their cooling system, you can check Dave2d videos have a good idea.
---
Ok, I need to learn tributes runs. 
---
I'm always down to split profit with a good healer, I was splitting 3:2 orbs with a guildie healer and prlmised to always bring a mage so he didn't have to buy water.
---
Not to be confused with the eye of Sauron!
---
Semi-related: A bunch of streets in the Netherlands have been named after Lord of the Rings:

---
No, that's sharding, which doesn't exist in Classic. Layering is the server actually being two servers presented as once, with players split between them. Each server has a cap, so layered it has twice the cap of unlayered.
---
I knew it was different than Vanilla I could not put my finger on why, I thought it was just my memory failing me because I had a feeling it did not work like this 15 years ago!
---
[Your first impression after seeing the orc coming towards you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70utG1L5bfU)
---
It would quickly fix itself with honor rankings out. Tbh the honor system could go live in a few weeks I wouldn't mind.
---
Yeah while I do have some friends that legitimately left because of it, I am assuming the vast majority of people who frequent this Reddit and said they would quit actually did not quit.
---
I assume it's a situation of: "well, I already paid for this month, may as well use it! Fuck blizzard though"
---
Then at the end of the month they will see their game time running out, and will extend it because they're still invested in it.
---
&gt; to stay alive
---
Heh. I see what you did there 😏
---
Whats that map addon
---
you can wipe most raids by taunting the boss or just standing in their raid and wanding if you have a mana bar
---
In that case half of the 60s ok sunstrider EU during vanilla would be banned. We had a ventrilo server and IRC channel for the server.
---
So, like discord but old.
---
I think they misspelled Vulcan like Roman god.
---
I can only really speak for Noggenfogger PvP, but it's been great so far. I haven't met a single real asshole-kinda guy there so far. It's also the exact perfect size in that it just barely reaches a queue on peak time weekends, but goes between high and full at most other times.
---
It's a horde-favored server though (like most PvP are) by about ~60-65% in the last census.
---
If you want a more balanced PvP server I've heard great things about Ashbringer, too.
---
It’s fine from lvl 10 when you ger bear form, then you survive the fights a lot easier. I definitely wouldn’t skip in playing druid because of the hard start; you will compensate that from level 30 on when leveling becomes a breeze.
---
Just blizzard evertything down or..?
---
Not really, APES always only fight when they know they are outnumbering their opponent, it got boring pretty fast. They will never engage you in 1v1's randomly out in the open, they only fight when they have at least 2 more people or 1 more healer than you, too afraid to get their egos hurt.
---
Alcor's is trash lmao.
---
I used ONSLAUGHT route for both characters, it's probably the best guide for the horde.
---
Over population of leveling areas is still an issue with classic imo. I joined vanilla about a year in, servers were never this crammed. I've been to questing areas with 10-15 horde thinking where the hell the alliance are.
---
In vanilla I played a hunter and it was pretty much kill on sight any alliance I saw. Was planning to do same for classic but I just feel too bad for them. They're all going to xfer out or quit and I don't blame them.
---
I really like the general idea of trying to motivate people to tank who otherwise don't feel they can take on the responsibility.
---
But yes, this ad is very convoluted and you could bring it across with basically just the beginning.
---
"You feel like you could probably tank but are afraid to take the blame if things go wrong? Don't worry, if asked, I'll give you a step-by-step introduction and you'll be amongst the best in no time! :)"
---
Come to me when you reached the cave south of the dark portal.
---
I clearly remember getting onto the if bank and the auction house using the wall jumping method and I didn't even play vanilla
---
Majority of warriors I know levelled by tanking dungeons.
---
It's a fine line to walk. The point of Classic is to replicate the Classic experience and not to replicate the Classic experience minus those mechanics that Blizzard deems problematic. Because that is just Retail.
---
There's many mechanics in Classic that feel kind of bad and I wouldn't want in the game. But That's not the point of Classic.
---
The alliance one is the one with the dwarven paladin am i right? And the gryphon
---
Orbs aren't worth on my server. Like 12 g 😅 and the drop rate is rly low
---
It doesn't. Just think its funny.
---
When I form the group I let them know orbs are reserved. 
---
Yes I click need on them, everyone else greed/pass.
---
Once or twice some over excited DPS failed to read the whole post saying orbs were reserved. The other people in the group told them that I indeed reserved them and they traded the orbs back to me.
---
Hacks!
---
Quest item from stratholme
---
I know, however i think it's a waste for the tiny upgrade it is
---
I was thinking in terms of javing it as an alternative for Robe Of The Void, when does it become obsolete
---
Damn that is low, I was averaging 2 a run and they sold for like 35g-40g
---
Allies controlled the start. Then the rest of the night horde controlled all dungeon entrances :P gehennas will be fun in p2
---
maybe don’t use discord cuz it sucks
---
You can get gloves that are almost as good from DM:east, though ultimately princess gloves are a bit better. You can do lava runs, which should be fairly fast.
---
Why? The infrastructure never gets updated.
---
A week to get 1k gold means you're playing like 12 hours a day though. Not many can do that. You prob play more in a week than I have since release. It is an effort to get 1k for most people.
---
12g x 2 =24/5....thats not even worth making a group
---
Maybe they said something about a certain movement of people for freedom....
---
My guild seems to intend this roll method. I'm already pissed about it. One of my pre Naxx Bis dropped and lost it to low roll vs the other tanks who had already gotten T1 pieces and will replace it relatively soon. "But they didnt get a piece this lockout" in no way makes it feel better
---
Having no way of prioing loot onto those who it will be best on or way of saving to get the very few upgrades MC has for me already has me ready to stop raiding with them. 
---
Blowing 20g+ on consumables and all that to have no way of reliably getting loot and also having no system to best help guild progress isnt really my thing. It just makes you resentful.
---
Are you intentionally leaving out the cross faction part of the equation? 
---
They've never had a problem with 3rd party voice programs. Its how they're using them
---
I have only had to queue twice recently, and was just under 500 in the queue
---
How you gonna work rag
---
Also, if you reroll, do some research, look for a guild/server that fits your lifestyle. Once you find a guild, be active in gchat. You WILL find new friends in the game. When I first started playing in 2005, I made friends that I would actually go visit from time to time for the next 10 years, until that no longer became an option. I’m not saying you will find something like that, but you can form real friendships with people in the game.
---
To raise your standing on the chart.
---
No, no it's not, it's running on 7.3.5 modified. It's closer to BFA than classic by a giant mile.
---
What do you mean by blackness? Button outlines? Bartender and most other action bar addons are compatible with Masque, which can reskin your buttons - I'd look for an appropriate masque theme. There were lots of them for retail version, unfortunately only a few were ported to classic so it might require some manual work.
---
Blizzard will ban you for trying to have human rights so duh they gonna ban for cheating their lil game
---
I don't argue, that APES don't deserve to farm the spot.. I guess you misunderstood. I was trying to say, that not everyone is like APES, and not everyone can chase out their local mafia away like them.
---
Piss off. No need for your bullshit name-calling.
---
It's ridiculous that groups fall for that rip-off. Even a 40g Tank service is cheaper and that person won't even roll.
---
Oh, congrats on the alt :D
---
Yeah, I would say you could probably quite easily find groups for LBRS for example which you can knock out in 1-1.5 hours but as far as quests go I’d maybe say Winterspring? But quests are much more scarce at 58+
---
How’d you go from “just as good” to “obviously it isn’t better”?
---
Until you get to BWL and all your dps outscale the tank massively. Nobody wants to wait for 3 sunders and be told they can't go all out. Not to mention 4 hour MC clears won't cut it when you're forced to clear MC+BWL+AQ all in one week. I don't see a boomer guild raiding more than 2-3 nights. If your guild falls behind and fails to clear AQ recruitment comes to a halt and your guild slowly dies. This isn't vanilla classic has a much different meta and players have different expectations.

Im a EU guy and I played on Flamelash EU until very recently, decided to move into Faerlina.
---
I don't get queues, ever because of my schedule. NA raid schedules fit me perfectly unlike EU ones due to work. The server is 100x more active than my old EU server.
---
The biggest pro, is that there is no fucking language barrier and I don't have to spend 10 minutes trying to explain something to someone because they don't understand english.
---
Well usually through Dungeons. For leveling though it does not make a lot of sense before level 41-42 when you can Enter zf. But you can use your main to equip your alt in Dungeons at certain levels to make the leveling easier.

Jesus.. how many times did you do strat live? 100

Maybe I am, maybe I'm not, doesn't change a thing tho. But if you're so smart, mind answering the last question? Can't wait to hear another great explanation of wrong facts.

Im getting this for dual wield tanking. Hyped af

I'm not talking about apes I'm talking about the mafia. If they can bring more players than you can, then why shouldn't they farm?
---
Yes. Classic Thrall is awesome even at normal height.
---
Didn’t say it wasn’t?
---
As long as they don't fuck with my jump runs, I'm GUCCI.
---
There's no damage bonus from int, just crit chance (which doesn't apply to dots). Generally, all talents that improve ability damage only apply to its base damage, before stat bonuses.
---
Ye but not comparable to Tomes and Epics i think :P
---
Ill test both anyway and decide whats more fun while being lucrative. No sense to farm whats not fun.
---
Don’t worry, it doesn’t take 35 hours :D
---
Centaur
---
training a pet to farm in 1 place is kinda bad IMO i would max nature and fire resistance because they are the most common ones and almost all the dots in the game are either nature or fire based
---
Thanks everybody! Frost it is 🙂
---
I hate that so many guilds sit in discord voice chat nowadays, moreso than teamspeak/ventrillo back in the day, because i want to listen to music or watch something while grinding, not have a voice conversation with someone
---
You know, I offered my services for 20g and no one wanted to pay that, but I can do tons with orbs reserved... oh well.
---
Targetting you until you leave (prolongued camping) was considered such, at least some time ago
---
Still so fresh and juicy to this day. It's amazing
---
Druids and rogues could do duo tribute runs and split the profit, at least on pservers. It comes out at aroun 40-50g per hour each, if I remember correctly.
---
Does that work? It’s also 14 ingame days right? At my current rate I need about 3 weeks to get that in /played though

Hello fellow Huntard,
---
I'd recommend Kargoz youtube channel for his hunter guide released just before classic it will pretty much tell you everything you need to know. The only macro i currently use is Feign/Freeze. All you need to do to begin with is assign mouse scroll fwd/back to pet send/return. Everything else is in that guide (to be honest I think that is too!).
---
Best of luck!
---
The demand for the devilsaur set is insanely high. For many classes their tier set from MC is made for tanking or healing. Therefor warrior dps, feral, enchancement and retri can not find a great replacement in MC for the set. Even for rogue, hunt it is still pre BiS while a MC only drops 2-3 epic items for 40 people so it will take a long while to gear up.
---
That's baffling and so weird.
---
*Your suspenders will fail*
---
In 10 runs I saw 3 orb drops. How the hell did you make 1400?
---
Are you actually just dumb?
---
BRD runs are 75h an hour minimum.
---
Deepfake AI can practically master someone's voice from hours and hours of recording and video of their face talking. It's getting scary. He could die and we'd never know because they'd produce the show with a deepfake.
---
Seeing as I agreed to tank DM east runs for nothing but Thorium to then have the said Thorium ninja looted by a rogue vanish sprinting after the last boss kill. Good luck getting a group to give that to you... I wish it were the case. I personally really enjoy the buzz of someone getting an item that really makes a difference to them, unfortunately people are confusing need and greed at the moment. Gone are the days of people actually giving items to those who need them. Back in the day this was a custom, now it's almost a rare random act of kindness. Alas good luck with your runs!
---
I averaged 2 orbs per run. Lick perhaps?

Black mirror wants to know your location
---
Re watching it I notice a lot of things I could have done better, what would made me survive the encounter but i still think its solid ! Enjoy.
---
you fucked up, i can still se a little of wow gameplay on your white screen
---
I DO have crippling poison on, but when no targets are marked, you have more than one target with quickly dwindling health and I can't tell because none of them are marked so I can know which is supposed to go down.
---
When I'm attacking the target a tank is focusing on, I DON'T gain agro, however I DO gain agro when the tank has to focus on ANOTHER mob because the DPS just gained agro because THEY don't know who the tank wants focused down first. While me and the tank are trying to focus one down, it turns out the DPS was focusing a SECOND and occasionally a THIRD mob down, because no marks means we don't know which mob is supposed to be taken out first. Each DPS is doing their thing by picking their favorite target at random because the tank is most likely tab targeting to apply sunders, and no clear 'winner' is present among the enemy group.
---
When the tank pulls three mobs, all titled 'Myrmidon' and none of them are marked, it becomes a toss up as to which mob is going to be sheeped. And he KNOWS one mob is going to be sheeped, because the mage has been sheeping the entire run. The TANK doesn't know which mob is going to be sheeped.
---
Why is it so much to ask the tank to pull the mobs back as well? You have any idea how unnecessary the risk is to fight the mobs at the place they were pulled? We have SWATHES of empty territory behind us, why are we fighting so close to the mob's allies? Corner pulling because the enemy is a caster happens so that we don't have to go over to the enemy and agro everything around us, this logic is still valid for pulling melee enemies back as well.
---
The tank trying to finish a dungeon quickly and not bothering to pull enemies to a safe location *even if it's only about 20 feet back* is causing us to pull LOADS of enemies onto us. When we're suddenly facing about 8 mobs because we pulled two additional groups, I find myself having to tank enemies off the healer because the tank was too lazy and too impatient to just pull the ORIGINAL group to a safe location. I don't even dare go behind the enemy to land attacks because I'm trying to maximize the distance between me and adds.
---
You make all these excuses for subpar tanking, but all these strategies are 100% valid and make coordination among the group smoother along with safely taking down the enemy. Marking, and pulling targets away from danger, not being impatient, all these are entirely reasonable. Why are we fighting so close to dangerous mobs? Does the tank want the dangerous raging enemy down first, or the healer? When all three enemies are named exactly the same, are we just going to take a guess who the mage is going to sheep?
---
There was however one suggestion here in this thread that actually I can benefit from entirely, and that's to do the marking myself. If I can't trust the tank to tell me who he wants downed first, or who he wants sheeped, I'll organize it myself. Because that's what it takes if you want something done right.
---
With DKP you end competing Against your guild. With a good loot council you compete with your guild against progression.

Obviously favoritism can ruin this. A good loot council should have transparent rulings and have preset plans to where the gear goes if/when it drops.

I´ll give it a shot when I´m home. Thanks for checking :)

Yeah, it takes even more tho :D

You think you do... but you don’t!

Kargoz on youtube did 2 amazing Hunter guides. They helped me a lot. He's got a guide for leveling 1-60. Which specs, what addons, weapon progresion etc. And he's got a live at 60 "field manual". I would advise watching both. Since both were released prior to Classic release there are some private server errors in them. But that's not a huge issue. The info he gives is still very relevant. 
---
1 tip I can give you, when you get a pet. What makes grinding way more efficient. Have your pet build some threat before you start your attacks. Since they have difficulty holding aggro otherwise.
---
It works really well! Bunch of different lists (nice, hate, KoS, guild KoS, etc). When someone on a list is near you it flashes your screen and tells you in chat. When they talk in chat you’ll see the list they’re on in parentheses next to their name.
---
Please do us all a favor and quit.

I'm just trying to be nice! Haha. I don't know how to properly reference people on Reddit and besides I'm not sure if it's their photo either.

Why are people asking for server mergers? In 15 years blizzard has never merged servers, and are not likely to do it now a few months in. There was plenty of servers back in the day that had uneven populations, and they didnt do anything about it.
---
Thats why he reserves it so it is just 12x2 = 24g for him (asuming the Prices are this low)
---
Except that I've seen him in BRD a ton doing coffer runs. He's streamed a few raids for our guildies who couldn't make it. I know how much gold he has. He doesn't have his epic mount. If he was buying gold, where the heck did it all go?

Is devilsaur set THAT desired? I didn't realise. I thought it was just for rogues who had hit 60 and hadn't got better gear yet, why would warriors want it? I guess druids would want it as well for solo mob grinding.

On our server nobody will run strath with reserved items.

As a rogue in which order should you use your CDs (orc's racial, adrenaline rush and blade furry) ?

Also, at what point in time during combat would it be the best time?

Eh, we're already outnumbered. I'll let em have the spot.

Cant agree with this post. This is my first WoW player through, but ive been playing mmos since early 200s.
---
Why would a low level run to SM from chillwind? Sure maybe you save 5minutes IF YOU DONT DIE. Stupid decisions cause stupid results. Run from Hillsbrad and swim thru the lake. What exactly "needs" to be fixed?  Someone running SM has no business in WPL.
---
Because no one is playing the game as a team, I made a post about this last week as a tank, this game is just Toxic, so much abuse aimed at you. 
---
So many people not willing to allow you to get aggro a tank effectively it more exhausting than work, but hey just need to "get gud" right
---
I have quit Classic now it was amazing leveling and enjoying the game but since 60 it has just been horrible.
---
Yeah, to me it was pretty clear he was lying, mainly how calm he was and his "Oh well" attitude he had in his post. 
---
If I leveled to 60, exalted rep, and epic mount and got banned, I think I would be too angry/frustrated to calmly type out a reddit post saying "oh well I guess I cant play anymore." I would be flipping out.
---
You can grounding totem It though
---
My server they recipes are selling for 25-30g on alliance side.

Lower on the shared AH. Thanks Horde bros btw.

I like to think that I would really enjoy living on Stormwind Avenue.

yep, firemaw ally.
---
I watch him every  day and I know blizzard would never dare touch him or his guilds. Simple facts.
---
Can’t get over troll feet and I personally think armor looks best on orcs. But as that other poster said play what ya like and personally what you don’t mind looking at for 60 levels and then some.
---
I remember it being mentioned in a game guide back in the day. But I'm not sure.
---
it is always both and you are supposed to know which one they mean from the context , which is very easy in 99% of the cases. 
---
DM can also be 'Direct Messaging' or 'Dungeon Master' or  'Designated Marksman'  to name a few common examples
---
You have to get inside their dead zones in between melee and ranged distance and they cant attack
---
Had a group for ZF, we were waiting for a dps that was questing in the middle of stv. Didnt even start moving to booty bay before the rest of us were inside the instance.
---
He didnt have the FP to tanaris either. Took him 25-30 minutes to get to ZF
---
First thing he does when he finally arrives is aggroing a boss because he thought it was a normal mob while everyone was low and drinking
---
And while 4 of us do the corpse run, he goes... «ress plz». God dammit dude
---
The company did judge him here and found him guilty. Same with all those other "I was wrongfully banned!" Posts. Occassionally the company overturns it, but do you think crying about it on reddit helps the case at all? That's still the company overturning it on their own accord. Of course they can make mistakes, especially when they're outsourcing to shithole countries.
---
DM has been Deadmines since vanilla, unless you've been on some wierd private server.. ?
---
It should be but it is "buggy" as hell. The general idea is that if you don't interact with the mob, the target of the mob nor anything else on the mobs threat table/something that is linked with the mob like a friendly mob also in combat with the same target, you should be fine.  
---
Well if someone runs with mobs next to you and they do an AOE while next to you, you're in combat with them. If you're in combat with a mob and they do an AOE buff, buffing your mob, you're in combat with them.  
---
Sometimes weird shit just happens. I was once in Tanarisin the pirate cove by the campfires killing a mob when some dipshit agroed the entire construction site boat of dockworkers and then jumped down and for some reason the entire boat of dock workers went straight for me.  
---
This is however part of the game and most of these deaths can be avoided by playing with a path of escape in mind and by paying attention to your surroindings. Keep in mind that mobs are unpredictable and do random ass shit sometimes. This is how I remember Vanilla and it goes under the #nochanges part of the game.
---
I skipped every single boss including cromcrush without using trap and ogre suit and we only got 1 blue in the chest.
---
Gonna try using the trap tonight.
---
&gt; How painful is the Druid 1-20?
---
1-16 is a breeze. 17-20 is a pain.
---
Its annoying cuz trap mats are like 7-10g/run
---
Not seeing the debuff though.
---
What exactly are you wanting to do?
---
Someone told me Asmon isn't even on there anymore.  That he rolled on Herod now.
---
Cool. Having some zoomer say "POG!" when they win an item roll didn't really feel like the OG wow experience for me, so I left. If you enjoy that sort of thing then keep it up.
---
I mean if you want to call everyone that lets you know how stupid you are a basement dweller then go for it. But you got to max level in only a few months just like they did. Only difference is you somehow failed to learn the basics and they didn’t
---
Well I guess Alliance is doing just fine on Gehennas. Good to know that I can keep ganking the living shit out of them.
---
The best reason: roll a rogue on the opposite faction and gank your friends. Repeatedly.
---
Just to clarify, this was before dm opened. After opening it was full corpse for alliance. I'm rogue and it was still extremely hard to even reset dungeon without dying as alliance.
---
On the bright side, you get so good at tab spamming and stance dancing that you can pursue a career as a pianist
---
It's a guild run and you are the warrior? If so, time to find a new guild mate. That's despicable.
---
I was making about 20gph without herbalism so yea not great.
---
It’s nothing sexual. Suwoo bitch ass big words
---
^ What they said. Think of trying to "collect" cooldowns without spending yours. If you blink in too close you're just going to get scatter trapped into a reset which leaves you struggling to get a poly off or waddling back into the deadzone.
---
Wow is a gateway drug
---
No it was pug
---
Get in their dead zone, frost nova, CoC, fire blast, AE
---
What are some good 1 handed weapons that aren't too hard to obtain for a level 60, but that aren't BIS level? As in yeah I know Del Rends sword are highly shaggy after etc but is there anything where there isn't any, or isn't as much, competition? E.g quest rewards, drops from mid-50s dungeons etc

Majority of people get mount around 42-44. And there's nothing bad in this.

Quests will reward you with nice sum of gold, especially at 41-42 - all Uldaman quests have 2-3 gold reward.

From that point of view it's totally true. When I read lawful I always think of society and "human" created laws and not natural ones.

Streaming to a couple hundred views is not lucrative. These people are the embodiment of the south park wow episode except more pathetic cus they've been doing it for 15 years.

you can always beg for money at rideau

If you have need, roll need! Your group should understand that, one of the best weapons for Tanks and they just think about the gold.

Started playing Alliance on Pagle with a good count of friends, despite regretting not rolling horde on faerlina/herod to show my pvp prowess.  I myself am a 60 rogue with 10 pieces of pre raid bis so far, currently stuck on getting the dal’rends mainhand with 23 rend kills and still running it nonstop.  My warlock buddy from Cali is lvl 60 and raiding more than me, far more geared than me and frankly owning the fuck out of the game.  My IRL buddy from way back (3rd grade)  got to 56 on his lock and burnt out seeing that incentive to pvp isn’t out yet (he’s really competitive and big into the pvp scene of games).  My coworker is 60 on his hunter and pretty on par with me, except he got lucky in MC and got a few of his giantstalker tier pieces.  My buddy from Texas has rerolled from hunter to paladin to rogue, all under lvl 30.  He’s got a wife and two daughters though so his first play-through of warcraft is limited for him, he’s just finding which class he likes before he commits.  Another friend from school played a warrior all day every day from launch to about the third week before dropping off the face of the earth around lvl 30.  Our guild master and her close male friend work an awful lot and are leveling a priest/warrior duo together, both lvl 48.  All around having a good run with my peeps, only lost two so far.

You're wrong but you wouldn't be the first one on the internet.
---
Hey, that's my city!
---
Thanks for taking your time to write a reply to my 8d old comment.
---
I still disagree with your line of thought, though.
---
but that doesnt lock you out of one of your skilltrees for 8 seconds
---
Also, no matter the spec on my server there is a definite shortsge of shamans. So there is almost leverage to play the spec you want as long as you put down the right totems for the group and can use your other utility spells right!
---
Griefing is a stretch, and while I hate that it's happening I don't think it's the right word.  Manipulating/Controlling the market while taking away that ability from others? idk.
---
Now...spawn camping at the SPIRIT HEALER until you log out?  That's definitely griefing and mean spirited.  You spawn at that location you aren't fighting anymore...you just want to leave.
---
After not playing for 15 years, I come back to more than a few douche bags. But there are some pretty great folks out there. I was running at lvl 40 yesterday (4g away from 90g for mount) and a 60 came up and asked why I was running. Traded me 7g and told me to go get my mount, it’s dangerous to walk. What a legend.

LC can easily fall into corruption. Or my worst fear.

Rogue A plays alot of WoW. He farms preraidBiS. He farmed UBRS key and has ran rend over 100 times, losing the swords rogues, warriors and huntards. Finally, Rogue A, with his epic mount and lots of gold, gets both Swords from Rend, and enchants them with Crusader.
---
Rogue B plays some WoW. He leveled at a good pace to 60, bought some preraid BoE BiS like devilsaur, but never put in the time to get preraid BiS. He never farmed UBRS and still uses thrash sword.
---
In MC an epic sword drops. BiS sword right now for rogues and fury warriors. Since the fury warriors already have the sword (fury warriors get certain items first because most warrior gear goes to tank, and rogues still have thier T1) the rogues are up for the gear. The LC decides it is beat to give the epic sword to ROGUE B, because it is a larger upgrade and helps the guild more.
---
How is that fair to Rogue A? He misses out on an upgrade because its a minor upgrade? Rogue A worked hard for that loot, worked hard for preraid BiS so he could bring good dps to the raid.
---
#MelnykOut
---
A guild that would distribute loot this way, trying to maximize raid DPS, would not have a ret in the first place.
---
Ok cool wasn’t sure how it worked
---
Mograine isn't bad. Slightly more horde (though I think every PvP server has that) but it's not horribly imbalanced. It seems like i more commonly see horde than ally in the wilds but it's certainly not rare to see ally.
---
The one place I notice it most is in Blackrock mountain. Constant ganking by groups of horde there. The one time I saw allies controlling the BRD portal a horde raid came from MC and chased them off lol
---
Imagine complaining about people ruining your Og WOw ExPerIeNCe and using a term “zoomer”...
---
Ok, Im stupid he isnt 60 but 57..
---
I think you are supposed to double down and pop them at the same time, as the dps increase is much greater if you can synergize their effects.
---
I’ve never seen someone so happy as when I see a random warrior out leveling alone and I give him 60 summoned goods. Hell, I rarely see that level of happiness on anyone lol.
---
Damn, why did you greed? Even if they tell you not to. It's an epic drop for warriors only (since you're horde) Makes no sense to me. I don't understand why they would even bring up to tell you to greed. Idiots.
---
I guess the difference is that you end up locked out of holy school, which can get you killed.
---
The gear of someone screen capping and calling me a ninja I think
---
It is many places.
---
shitstorm
---
what the frick! Is that a normal amount of armour to have as a level 60 baer? seems massive
---
If it was like real life and you could attack anyone it’d be much better
---
damn, i'm on it and never saw anything about it. Not enough stuff gets put on the FAQs
---
which class spec
---
~50g each for the bars. They ranged from 45-65g each
---
They wanted the gold cuz after it was distributed that's all they talked about

If you really want to get technical the British drawing the maps of the middle east after WWI actually fucked it up.
---
What is this HUD/combat text?
---
Yeah it can seen as a lot of different things. Where I play e.g. DM-E is common.
---
Most quest have some kind of accept text, and a completion text.
---
It was very frustrating having to deal with all types of morons. You are right, no one wants to be this stressed every singe dungeon. 
---
I've had people pull bosses before i charge, and then my shield slam misses and the boss goes on a rampage. I've had them AoE spam while i am stunned for 5 seconds and later complain why i'm standing there doing nothing.
---
 That's why i'm only logging on raid days and going to be playing PvP when it comes out and leveling a DPS alt now, as it's just not worth it stressing so much.
---
But that puts responsibility back onto people like OP. How can you expect something so common sense from him? He's a special snowflake. We should cater the game to him, and give him everything for free.
---
Nice throwback to when they did it before
---
Sorry zoomer, successful adults don’t fantasize about gaming 8-12 hours every day.
---
atleats its cheapper than upgrade cooking in the game
---
I don’t want leeway and batching in the game, but here we are.
---
Farming raw gold is not an option for us really, we just cant kill stuff fast enough.  
---
    
---
Personally I grind Ghost Mushrooms in Maraudon, orange to purple then reset, purple to orange then reset etc. Each run nets me 6 mushrooms which at my server's prices earns me 45g/hr as the mushrooms sell very well, there will always be a demand for them due to shadow power elixirs.

I had the exact same thing 5 min ago, book dropped all greed.. i shoulda needed it.. 1k gold luls

I dont know what kind of deal you have with the devil.

I've had to chain-kill like ten fucking quilboars last week, because gouge doesnt work once the little fucker runs away just to come back with his two bros.

Fury warr, sword/mace rogue etc. Just 1h dps weapons really

I mean the draw of this whole thing was to relive WoW. Zooming through dungeons aoe pulling everything and dropping a monkaS during wipes isn't how I remember it, but maybe I'm wrong.

How do you disable this?

“What does SMOrc even mean and why are they EVERYWHERE” - me first week
---
I don't know either way on this specific issue, but I've definitely seen a lot of advice going around that's just wrong because it's based on private servers. Need to find forum posts from 2006 to check anything.
---
Group talked out out of needing it too? Damn man feels bad

&gt; Hammerfall Pl,
---
Beautiful double reference right there, given that the town of Hammerfall is, itself, a reference to the band Hammerfall which Samwise was a huge fan of during the development of WoW and started doing the album covers for them starting with [Crimson Thunder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF3vck3cL3c) the year before WoW released
---
I would have selected need, u could use it.
---
But they obviously count only for your squad...  4 warriors Dont care for mana while 4 mana dudes usually don't care for windfury
---
Looks like you need to go to Strath.
---
As a Hunter this pains me so much. I saw the blue post addressing it and thought salvation was on the horizon... Apparently not.
---
Lol you got screwed. No one on your server would have called you a ninja except maybe the greedy turds in your group. Did you agree to this before the run??!
---
You just run north up the west coast of alterac then walk west along the back wall of UC into Tirisfal
---
Screen capping a warrior needing on warrior loot should not effect your server rep.
---
Any idea on the age of these buildings and if they were build sometime after 2005?
---
The warcraft universe came long before this did so he could have been a big lore character and that for those who played warcraft would know who he is.
---
Was not agreed don't think it was expected the guy who won didn't know what it was and at first was ok with me needing
---
Only if you do something to cause aggro.
---
I still don't know but assume its something streamer related.
---
no its not. camped multiple streamers with my guild, some well known, until they logged off to play other games or logged to retail. we verbally "abused" them the whole time. got a shitload of whispers from the streamers whiteknights how we are evil and its against TOS to corpsecamp someone while streamsniping them and they all reported us.
---
if true, me alone should have gotten hundreds of reports for ganking someone on their corpse and even the spirit healer with the help of my friends, completely blocking the streamer from playing the game.
---
BUT, als blizzard has stated, corpse camping IS NOT against terms of use.
---
so i will continue to camp your favorite streamers for all eternity, and no one can do anything about it.

&gt; How do you get 100 gold for riding and a mount by the time you are 40 on your first character? 
---
You don't. If you don't specifically grind gold, you will get mount around level 43 by just doing quests and playing the game.  
---
And this is perfectly normal. Just stop buying all skills, don't spend gold on AH, sell non-needed stuff.
---
Because people don’t want to lose their money and pay (ofcourse they also lose money losing the orbs,  ur they don’t have that money in the beginning. Something psychological

He had so many people jumping to defend him and linking irrelevant pictures in that thread lmfao

They’re in Irvine - SoCal.

It was an expansion dude. Of course the old stuff was invalidated.
---
Not at home so can't check - but if you've got WeakAuras (for other reasons) I'm pretty sure you could put something together that would trigger off your pull spell / move and then post to /s a suitable message - might even be able to post /s WAIT &lt;delay&gt; /s KILL SKULL

This might work: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveWoW/comments/610eri/weakauraaddon\_that\_can\_show\_text\_at\_specific/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveWoW/comments/610eri/weakauraaddon_that_can_show_text_at_specific/)

Not sure how flexible the scripting is - I've seen some pretty awesome things in WA, but some fairly 'basic' stuff is impossible due to API restrictions.

no queues at 7am after work amigo :\]

They didnt really start the big character little character thing properly till like TBC or Wrath I dont think.
---
Hey, remember questing with you :D
---
Did you pug rag or you're in a guild now?
---
I did it for 2 hours, average was 20g per hour without herbalism, with the herb market crashing you might push 30g per hour but no way are you hitting 50g unless herbs on your server are insane. It's not horrific, and I didn't get any tomes appear which could bump it up mind you.  I've also had resets where I've made basically nothing so I say over a bigger sample period it would be lower.
---
That’s normal Blizzard. Blizzard North was in Bay Area. They don’t exist anymore, though.
---
Typically, player reports for botting or tracking trends of cash flow through the mail and trades.
---
Trading 1 or 2 sums wont flag you, dozens in small windows of time will...this recently happened in retail to Limit who were funneling gold to guildies for typical world race stuff so it does actual have a history of being not so foolproof.
---
Player reports typically are the most common way to flag a bot, and typically botting goes hand in hand with RMT a lot of times so if they follow up on a slew of bot reports, usually they're gonna track who the account interacts with too.
---
What do you mean?? Multiple comments say it works with sunder and it’s one of the best non-Epic tanking weapons in the game
---
Still waiting for mountain dew to come out with morning glory dew 😤
---
It was tougher than expected. I did it with a pug but luckily they were competent players. It really helps to have another warlock in the group so that you can SS the tank and healer (our tank died near the end of the wave event but luckily he was SSed). Also, it helps because you can banish more than one felguard. 
---
The most important thing is that you (or the warlock providing the service) doesn’t take aggro so that they can fix the items.  This also requires 1 soul shard each time, so I’d recommend having at least 20. You have to say in the center of the circle and wait for the demons to come, then aoe them down. This repeats for several minutes. 
---
 Imo an ideal group would be a warrior/Druid tank, shaman/priest healer and at least 2 warlock dps and another with good aoe (mage).
---
No raptor for us either.... Stupid.
---
he is a terrorist
---
&gt; It is soo much better on a warrior, poor bastards losing bre to a retardin lul
---
&gt; BRE is a pvp weapon.
---
Logic???
---
Could have been a nice boost for your guild. Don't worry though it is just a game.
---
As a tank if à rogue pull aggro, I either taunt or stun, if those are on CD I don't do anything... I expect said rogue to feint vanish or stun himself or even evade until my taunt is off CD
---
Lulz dude. If you got need, you roll need. Ignore those greedy bstrds. I never heared of someone losing server rep by rolling need on things they actually need..
---
Don't forget the sapper charges. You can see when APES or SALAD BAKERS did something when solid stone is at 40s per piece.
---
if priest would get a lot of killing blows it wouldn't be that bad.  
---
but with 4-5 people attacking it's rare to get the killing blow and regen some mana.
---
Mage: "LF1M TANK DM N"  
---
War: "Hey, are you guys all going to roll need on the epic warrior sword that drops from DM?"  
---
Mage: "Yeah man im gonna sell it on AH, of course ill need it lol"  
---
Warrior: "think ill pass"
---
Mage: "asshole you can't reserve BoEs I need that gold"  
---
...
---
Mage: "LF1M TANK DM N"
---
Majority of people who cared about “reliving WoW” already left after realizing that they can’t relive being a 14-20 year old without responsibilities playing the game 20 hours a day.
---
dats a bit hard cuz they were suddenly attack you from the huge range. When i reach them i have like &lt;50% of mana(
---
Tbh I expected this to happen but the fact that it happened on a streamer server was surprising till I remembered that the twitch morons who streamsnipe love nothing better than to screw over streamers so I guess they killed two birds with one stone.
---
Side note : Its hilarious how Asmongold tries to act like his guild doesnt sell gold when literally everyone on his server knows the players who do are in his guild.
---
Yes... Fast is very special term here... 😂

All we did was come along and draw them some nice neat lines on a map! Cant do right for wrong!

Opened my first dusty tomb and it dropped! Then realized I never got it since a mob attacked me smh.

Someone was recruiting for a guild on Noggenfogger Eu with the same IASIP quote. Wanted to join but never heard from him again :( please come back
---
Well that really sucks... Next time defenitely roll Need if you Need it. Don't let them talk you out of it.
---
If they really wanted to avoid you getting it they also should have just needed. You could have just taken it... But knowing your Warriors you are just too big hearted...
---
Next time just take it!!!

Meanwhile on other layer we run dm normaly whole night. Lul at layering
---
Dou you even read?
---
I dont know if you tank, I do. You are never ragecapped while tanking. And that is the argument the people use for daggers. Using heroic strike as tank is rarely a thing you do.
---
\+ Daggers have less rage generation.
---
True. I only run pugs, even as a dd warri, when I got forors when it drops. There a so many pugs and so many son of bitches spread in between
---
💪
---
See you In 6months when your servers deader than my sex life
---
Bunch of decent 1h weapons you can look at:
---
Ironfoe, Axe of the Deep Woods, Dal'Rends, Mirah's Song, Doomforged Straightedge, Serathil, Felstriker, Krol Blade, Heartseeker, Bone Slicing Hatchet, Bonescraper.
---
Yeah that's what I figured... better to not get 70g than to loose 5g.
---
Orb drops aren't guaranteed, and even if a few do drop there's a solid chance it doesn't go to you. 
---
Losing 5g is a guaranteed loss. Losing the ability to roll orbs is not.
---
Unpopular opinion: fuck the devilsaur set, its completely overhyped and overrated. There are many decent or even equally good pieces to use instead, which are free as dungeondrops or even quest rewards, and which dont **render useless as soon as you break the setbonus** by replacing one piece with something else.
---
The only classes which dont have too many other decent or equal options are rogues and maybe furys. But mail/plate classes can get the gloves from the lbrs main quest easy, guaranteed and for free (2% hit, 7 agi) together with f.e. the legs from the beast (1 hit 1 crit, 5 agi), and all non-dual wielding classes are easily getting hitcapped anyway with various other pieces and accessories. I cringe a little everytime I see a hunter or even a ret with devilsaurs, possibly having payed \~300-400g for it, because some people keep telling everyone that its bis and a requirement.
---
I am just lvl 48 and also undecided which build to use. Actually I am going like you for hotw/ns.  
---
The plan is to do more PVP and be able to heal pve content. I think I will respecc later to Moonglow but I am also interested in 29/11/11 just for PVP. I will also try my luck as flagcarrier and I think the build 8/12/31 is for it.  
---
I think to be effective in everything there is no way to use different builds.
---
I never actually knew griefing was a bannable offense. Was it bannable back in vanilla as well or is it a new thing? From a business perspective I can understand why you'd want to temp ban griefers as people would probably just cancel their subscription if it went on too long. From a player's perspective I'm not too sure. I'm guessing it's a somewhat controversial topic?
---
wat?
---
which other instances do you call after last boss?
---
"LFM Drakkisath" ? :D
---
I believe he means the combo of feign death and ice trap, rather than using them separately which didn't do anything. Overall this guy was a "huntard" rather than a hunter.
---
It sells for 1k+ right now
---
The content is piss easy, you don't need any buffs outside of what your raid members have in your toolkit and flasks and pots is even more unnecessary.
---
You need one consumable in two years when you're doing Loatheb, I think it's fine.
---
I never had played warrior. only mage. But i get what you mean.
---
That’s the world of pugging. The idea of everyone needing the patterns is because you can never be sure if the caster will actually learn it or sell it. I’m sure there’s plenty that get the pattern passed to them don’t instantly learn it because “I haven’t refilled tailoring yet” or “I’m not quite 300 just yet” then turn around and just sold it on the AH. Similarly, we don’t know if you tanks will actually use Furor’s or try to sell it. It may be annoying (it is to me, since I’ve had multiple of my pattern taken from me by warriors), but I fully understand why everyone just needs. Same for all high value BOEs that someone in the group can use. I don’t know if the warrior is actually going to use Edgemasters, or the druid is actually going to use the Sash of Mercy, or if they’ll just AH it for a bunch of gold.

What is the keyring?  Is it a separate holding system that's isolated from your bag space?  Or is it a specialized bag that holds keys(like a spirit shard bag/herb bag/etc)?
---
It's a twitch emote that looks like an orc face. People spam it in support of the horde.

Back during vanilla, I farmed the Furor’s book like a mad man. The guild I was in was more than helpful. During my winter exams, I wasn’t able to play but sat down ready to farm for 16 days straight once I finished my last exam. The book dropped on the first run we did and I was able to forge the sword later that night as was organized an impromptu Onyxia run.

To this day, this has been my favourite vanilla memory and it’s the reason I use this transmog exclusively on my warrior (former main) and paladin.

---

This is pretty much what i've used to level my warrior all the way to 54. Though I stopped every 10 or so levels to do a couple dungeons and stay ahead of the curve. There's a couple times later one where it has you killing stuff 2-3 levels higher than you for a quest and it's just not efficient at all as some classes.
---
I don't even watch Esfand and I've been ret with BRE way before anyone knew who he was but yes, blame him
---
I was expecting this setup to be much more expensive than it actually is, looking these units up now. Still pretty hefty but much more affordable than I would of have thought.
---
Nope. Its only purpose is to be used as an activatable item. It doesn't have any damage stats, and Druids don't have an ammo slot.
---
Don't forget R for Molten Core and N for Black Wing Lair.
---
Unlucky, I'm sure I've bought some gold in almost every expac since vanilla and had no issues. Was hoping it was still viable these days.
---
If you have double crusader it's best to wait for double proc before popping them to get max efficiency out of everything but if its a pack you can pop them without waiting. Its situational. But in essence.. there is no rotation. These are cds you re supposed to use whenever up.
---
I really believe groups in a rush always take longer to complete anything. Methodical and deliberate is always faster (IMO) and a group like this rarely if ever wipes no matter how FUBAR a pull gets because everyone's prepared, topped off and ready for battle. Not coming in half-cocked, at half mana while the Rogue is lost and the healer is downstairs because the Hunter's "gotta go fast".
---
Asmongold is such a simple neck beard how he has an audience is beyond me.
---
Yeah, I was pretty shocked at that too.  Even if it was guild mates I wouldn’t trust them enough for that.  Especially if this was on Alliance.  If everyone is supposed to hit greed, why not just have everyone hit need?  What’s the practical difference?

For example: Maybe you have 40 rage and overpower proc is on. With this macro you will waste the 40 macro on execute, and go 0 rage, while you could have used overpower first and use 35 rage execute.

I'm Ally on Benediction and it's been great. PvP is very back and forth. There are plenty of times that the other side will play beside you, and plenty of other times where they'll gank you while you're in combat. Such is life on a PvP server. Some days Alliance dominates a zone, some days Horde does. It's very back and forth, I think.
---
But the Alliance community has been awesome, I've found. If I'm having trouble with a quest, or need someone to take care of some pesky Horde for me, I've always found plenty of people willing to jump in.
---
Yes, the goblin chest pretty much only contains patterns and some random mats.
---
There used to be a lot of confusion about how the contents of the chest were calculated. As I'm not sure I remember correctly, and private servers probably guessed it too and might have been wrong, I'll leave that one open.

You're probably right... We hope.

You're not denying it

Is this what happens when you Bing something?
---
tribute runs are always going to be running and there's plenty of gold to be gained in the chest. Probably too much to ask for the entire chest outside of what people need, but maybe res the mana pots or something
---
Yeah, that’s my one consolation now. The extra int effect would have been beneficial for raid members though. Oh well.
---
I had such a moment yesterday. There was a hunter in feign death in the troll ruins of STV. Next to him he had to watch his pet getting punched to death by 3 trolls.   
---
Once he realized I pulled the only 2 mobs blocking his way outto safety, he took his chance and ran by me. I instantly feared him into 2 headhunters, knowing that feign death was on cooldown. For the horde.

During my two hours there, I got herbs worth 40g, living essences worth 10g (dropped a lot in price and were worth way more earlier). Grays, greens and blues that I all vendored for a total of 40g. Also got some other things that I have yet to put on the AH. You also have a change to find books from the book spawns in the room, as well as epics from the lashers.
---
Dude why
---
i bought my mats last week for 1/10th of what they cost now :D
---
I don't even consider using Major pots in pre 60 5 man dungeons. If a superior pot can't save us from wiping then sorry guys, get your shit together!
---
Of course when you run xBRS with all 60s or go raiding, sure - major pots are more warranted here.
---
Find yourself a priest friend. Priests are by far the best class for tribute with soothe. When you learn the routes you can do crazy fast runs.

---
Haha thanks man! Yeah I was tempted to splurge out on a regular horse so I won't have to deal with the mana cost + resetting 5SR, but this was so iconic and I'm playing classic for the nostalgia anyway - doing the mount quest back in the day when I was a whole lot younger was one of my favourite memories, so I thought meh and went for it. :)

Lol this is the absolote worst. No wonder people have zero patience with you
---
I found 10 damage per tick to be trivial, compared to say the extra threat from reckoning procs (which can be abused and procced on command), BoS, imp RF, holy shield, redoubt.  You'll be drinking after every pull with cons.
---
That's actually pretty comical.

No question: I just wanted to comment that I had asked about mace spec for leveling my rogue and had a bunch of people jump down my throat about how bad it was ... only for me to actually try mace spec and discover how badass it is.  I get to grind higher level monsters without glancing eating up all my dps, the stun is amazing vs casters, and the stun is even better in groups as even most bosses are stunnable too
---
Thats a grey zone and there is no right or wrong here. Personally i think that since he is tanking the dungeon, then he should get the shield if he needs.
---
Same goes if an dps item drops then you get that because you are dps and not him.
---
Imagine tanking an instance and loose shiels to a dps.. That sucks
---
Yeah, I can understand that you not happy about this and feel sorry for you! I would have been not happy aswell!
---
But think of you lost none bis item and not the mount :)! 
---
Mages can buff int aswell 👍
---
I'm 21/30 in Deep Holy build (check icy veins). But I just bought a bunch of int gear from the AH to fill in the spots that I don't have MC gear on.

* Neck: Gemshard Heart
---
* Shoulders: Elder Wizard's Mantle
---
* Back: Frostweaver Cape

* Chest: Robes of Prophecy (+3 stats enchant)
---
* Bracers: Vambraces of Prophecy (+7 intellect enchant)
---
* Weapon: Staff of Hale Magefire
---
* Gloves: Magister's Gloves

* Belt: Devout Belt
---
* Pants: Elegant Leggings of the Owl
---
* Boots: Boots of Prophecy
---
* Ring 1: Songstone of Ironforge
---
* Ring 2: Band of the Hierophant
---
All that lands me on 6.55k mana. I also use Elixir of Greater Intellect which is an additional 375 mana. You could ask mages and druids that are near the instance for a buff aswell.
---
Thrash Blade &amp; Mirah's Song is the standard combo.
---
Cat cats find friends easily on a server.  Best bet is to find a server that suits taste instead of clipping a thirsty boy to one's experience.

Thanks for the admission of you being a moron. No, I'm not jealous of social pariah playing a game to "earn" a fraction of an entry level salary for unskilled labour. You're obviously jobless manchild yourself since you're idealizing this failed lifestyle so badly.
---
Haha what in the fuck? I had no idea that Hammerfall was an international thing. I thought they were some obscure band from the wilderness of Sweden that my dad liked.
---
I think the bigger problem is that for most people, end-game tanking is temporary.  It's a mostly thankless dead-end gig. Thanks for tanking all my 5 mans, now fuck off while I go heal/dps in raids. 40 man raids need 1-2 tanks, so you need 5x as many tanks for the dungeon tier as you do for the raid tier.  For anyone planning their path into end-game raiding (which is pretty much everyone these days), tanking is a thankless difficult side-quest.  You have to build a gearset and skillset that is ultimately useless and without dual spec, you suck at questing and gathering and have a much harder time doing everything except tanking 5 mans.
---
It's a big advantage yes.

But #nOcHaNgEs...

“I was a piece of shit to people and didn’t get in trouble for it so it must not be against the rules.”

It is an amount you can reach without ever setting a foot into a raid. But on the other hand you can't parry or block and you will receive crushing blows and critical hits, both dealing increased damage. You need your large health pool and high armor to compensate.
---
I guess “life experience” is “having a 9-5 job that you hate” for you, in this case I’d rather not look up to people like that, you are right.
---
Thank you for letting me know.
---
Ahh so one person have a good experience. Good argument :)
---
N please...
---
Wailing Caverns is a horrible dungeon for people discovering it for the first time.
---
Wailing Caverns is a fantastic leveling dungeon if you have a group who know the layout. should never take more than 2 hours, lots of bosses and great loot.
---
Anyone have a working square mini map add-on?
---
That is very important to me. I was wondering if ally would help if I get attacked and not just run by me. Hopefully ally here are as friendly as you say.
---
I quit smoking to vape since i cant smoke in my apartment. Now i chain vape between raid pulls and dungeons: even with 48mg nicotine salts.
---
I’ve never tried tanking before, but maybe I’ll give it a shot! Sounds good!
---
This reminds me of a DM group I was in a few days ago.
---
A mage was exiting the mines and pulled like 30 mobs, so I figured they'd aggro my team afterwards, so I used consecration to gain aggro, I'm using dynamite and spamming consecrate, they're dying thanks to the mage. 
---
I'm tapped out of mana and extremely low on health, I turn to see what my healer is doing, whose also a paladin. Guy is looting corpses and has enough mana to get off his maximum heal but doesn't.
---
The mage and I die, so I ask the healer why he's looting corpses instead of healing, he gets angry and says it was my fault for tanking the enemies that would have wiped everyone if I hadn't, proceeded to throw petty insults and claims he wasn't looting corpses when I and the mage died, which was a blant lie. He continues ranting and raving about how he has a Lvl 60 and raids, l and that I can also heal and bubble myself. (I did both) funnily enough he was also in one of the many toxic Olympus guilds.
---
Long story short people suck.
---
If every piece of gear was BoE then it wouldn't be expensive to begin with.
---
Hard disagree. Boomkin is def better than ret mainly due to how short fights are in classic. Boomies main drawback is the lack of mana regen and sustain not dmg.
---
My guild bailed on Kirtonis during the free transfers because of stuff like this.
---
Should've gone to specsavers
---
Not even really a question on my server Horde side. Alliance outnumber us like 3 to 1, so I doubt anymore than 2 or 3 groups of Horde have done any Deadmines.
---
“I was a piece of shit to people and didn’t get in trouble for it, therefore it must not be against the rules to be a piece of shit.”
---
Why is that??
---
MVP.
---
Assuming level 60.
---
Essence of Water in Feralas, Elemental Fire and Essence of Fire in multiple locations, EPL Bats and  larvae has a very solid loottable for greys.
---
It's a bug, it should get fixed. If you don't want to use that many buffs, that's your choice but for people who do want to min-max, this bug is was annoying.
---
Suppose paladin mounts were bugged and all other classes saying it doesn't need fixing. Quite infuriating if you're a pally, no?
---
Which is why I adjusted and picked up FR. but yeh I made mistakes just trying to learn.
---
I’m saving money by quitting WoW this week.
---
Quest rewards rump up quite a bit 30+ but you have to utilize professions to make it exactly by 40. Mining, skinning, herbalism all make you money as you level.
---
Look up videos on YT under "items not to vendor in classic wow" for white items from mobs that you think are useless that you might not think twice before vendoring cause there are a few that if you stack them and AH them you can make decent gold.
---
Obviously you can get lucky with BoEs that are in demand but at the end of the day and especially late 20s and mid 30s you ll have to grind not just rely on quests cause there s a lot of variance in quest levels in the relevant zones and you ll have to make up the difference. If you look up good farming spots per level range (again there are YT videos showing you how to get to 60 just by grinding and show you the best spots; not saying you should grind 1-60 but when you re out of quests and the next ones immediately available arent soloable at ur level just find the best spot for your level and grind 1-2 levels. Vendoring trash/greens you cant use and selling some of the mats i mentioned earlier + any lucky BoEs on the AH will help you cover a lot of ground).
---
Hi, we've had some issues with ragnaros the past couple of resets. Suddenly he just slaps a melee in the face, killing them. This is despite threatmeters saying the tank is top threat. Any idea why this happens?
---
A heads up: you can only track one thing at the time, and tracking mobs are one of the best parts about leveling a hunter, you'd be giving that up with herbalism.
---
Sweet! I’m mostly excited to the versatile game play tbh, I enjoy the roaming of the world, but I know that can only get so far before raids!
---
Someone brought him to the Tirisfal zeppelin tower the other night on a Westfall. He was just chilling there for a few hours.
---
If people weren't so obsessed with bis, wouldn't be an issue
---
I levelled the whole of something like 30 to 34 in that stupid Darkshore tower farming that tailoring recipe that I thought would make me gold since it was used for a quest.
---
Sometimes luck just sucks. Sometimes you're convinced there's an rng that says "when you roll this character, he rolled that he would never get x item".
---
And hunters
---
If this were to be put to a painting. I would title it: *Legacies Enduring*
---
The number of layers on a realm was never static to begin with. At first, when there were more layers than just a max of 2, they would increase or decrease the number of layers during the day, according to online population. Now if layers really affect realmpop caps, that means that a realm, in the first few weeks, would have different pop caps throughout the day, which wasn't the case.
---
Realmpop caps are static, number of layers aren't.
---
Paladin is pretty much the least gold-hungry class in my experience, especially if you go with a Holy spec that is viable both in PvP and PvE. No need to respec, consumables are pretty affordable, and hardly any extraordinarily expensive BiS pieces. We even have a budget mount, though I unfortunately didn’t stock up on Arcanite Bars after the announcement so decided to just buy a Ram for a bit more.
---
Unless you play a Spelladin, I don’t really see any reason to mindlessly grind for gold.
---
Your posts make people worry. In a world of security blankets and safe spaces, you can’t just go spouting facts and things that make people feel uncomfortable. Even if what you say has some serious merit.
---
Haha, I don’t play enough to top DPS charts normally anyways, so I don’t really mind being middle of the pack
---
Hopefully that warrior isn't apart of a big guild on your server. Blacklists can be serious and don't be surprised within months when you are dropped from groups randomly.
---
Nice. Thank you for the info bro!
---
You are tank and thats a tank warrior class quest. So no deal to ever think about greeding
---
This is like high school freshman level analysis for your english class paper. We get it, streamers bad. 
---
Give it a rest.
---
I feel you man! With all this talk about Server Reputation and loot rules and all Need or all greed or whatever it can get quite confusing when something Drops and everyone wants you to greed. You only got a Little time to think about it. Social pressure etc.
---
But next time just think to yourself "Fck those guys Ima take that shit for myself" and Need it.
---
They literally just wanted to make some Money while you would have used it.
---
I bet you - if a nice caster BOE blue dropped they would have rolled for it instead of greeding just so everyone has a Chance and then sell it in the AH later...
---
Just hypocrates everywhere... As Long as they get something out of it they are happy..
---
Yea but its at the cost of a Paladin. And sure you can brez, but now they have half mana and half hp, zero buffs, and you wasted a brez.
---
Perfect! Now the next step is to find a guild hahah
---
They can enter through the LFD Tool.....
---
...Oh.
---
&gt; But story wise it pulled me in marking me feel like I was actually in a war that got added to every patch, fighting a villain who had presence and motivation. 
---
Generally I'd agree with the exepction of the Argent Tournament patch. That one was terrible, both storywise and mechanics wise - and by mechanics wise I mean being able to do it 4 times per week per characters, which means spending hours and hours in the same stupid room...
---
I also learned that anyone playing ret paladin is obviously copying Esfand. Ret paladins didn't exist before Esfand and anyone who's playing it now is clearly a copycat because it's his own personal spec.
---
Salty people gonna salt. I was kitted in epics back in 2005, the "ret lol" comments are just dumber now.
---
I guess it's doable by standing on the side by yourself. But killing rag yesterday with my guild I was healing cause we needed more healers and it was our first rag kill.
---
Got Crown of Destruction btw :)
---
Well you better get walking then!
---
I never managed him. But I never shined on my alt Hunter at all.
---
I spent most of this past weekend in STV from levels 31-35. I saw a lot of death. But whenever I asked for help in general, I got it. It depends on the zone, obviously, and who's around but I had a good experience. Well, as good as STV can be, anyway.
---
Memes and icons go hand in hand
---
Ah I have my paladin for spamming dungeons when I'm bored on my shaman. Outside of that I don't mess around soloing.  I've stacked int and Stam gear so I have a lot of Mana to go through and it's pretty easy to get a stack or two of magewater each session.  8 damage per tick in an aoe is great for the lv20s and ofc it scales up with increased ranks. Early dungeons are not bad for mob damage and the extra bit of threat with both ret aura and consecrate make it so I very rarely had any problems tanking even at level 20 in deadmines
---
What they nerfed on them?  
---
Drop rates ?  
---
Gold drop?
---
Mythic raiding is awesome if you’re in a good guild. Sucks to be stuck on a boss because the bottom 4-5 people though
---
But big numbers!
---
Retail still has general chat and guilds, actually.
---
Yeah but its Orleans and no one has time to go to that part of the city. Shits far man.
---
Well the 60 Kings all have a hard on ATM while the rest of us who didn't make the cut now get left behind. 
---
Thanks blizzard.
---
Haha thanks! Congrats to you too my pally brother.
---
Go deep frost aoe spec. Run around one side spam clicking all the graves. Follow them up they run up to the platform where the Witch Doctor sits, clicking more graves along the way.
---
As they pile up on the platform, you should be getting closer too, and when they finally aggro on to you, jump to the flat portion of the platform to the right of the staircase where the lit brazier is. They will evade until dropping aggro.
---
Rinse repeat until you have a bunch, then aggro them and keep them as tightly clustered as you can and aoe them down
---
Even in original vanilla those patrols didn't move that fast i can guarantee you. So much for no changes.
---
As if I would care for that. It is a BoE item - so expect everyone to roll Need on it. Either to use or to cash hin. Whoever blacklists me for that is no one I would want to run with anyway. Probably the same people who reserve items in Dungeons.
---
End game content is non existent it takes like 2 weeks then you have nothing to do but wait and log in to raid, which reward worst gear than what you can get out of most dungeons. Except for a few items here or there.
---
Yeaaaa we are a little rough on yall ally scum aren't we? I dont think your completely correct tho. I was in stv last night on krit and there's more ally now. They are just leveling slow it looks like.
---
Go Tauren for uniqueness.
---
If only there was anything competitive for anyone to be relevant at in Vanilla XD
---
"But mages are the new huntards so take only if you are ready to be viewed a bit negative (noob favorite class)."
---
That is just this subs circlejerk. Nobody actually thinks this
---
My friends who took their time to level all stopped played because they hit STV and got corpse camped. I’ve literally lost friends because of STV being so bad.
---
Omg that sounds incredible...!  It was supposed to coincide with DM?
---
300 hours? That's like... my played time so far, wtf.
---
Hey! Made this guild on launch day lol. Been my guild since actual vanilla. :)
---
I am asking if people would consider this a ninja considering the other group members greed rolled because there was an alch that would actually use the recipe in the group. 
---
In the eyes of the winner of the recipe, he was going to use it on his alt so he says it was fair to roll. 
---
In my eyes, in that case, everyone should have rolled because anybody can make an alt with alchemy.
---
&gt;First off I started late so to assume that I'll never be 60 is an interesting view point.
---
k.
---
I never said you wouldn't hit 60. I said you'd always be behind. Are you assuming that you'll be competitive with people in full-BiS the day you hit 60? 
---
My point was that when new phases roll in, I'm pretty confident you'll immediately fall behind every time (based on how far behind you are now). Not like it matters, you'll find people either similarly paced to you regardless.
---
&gt;And as far as contribution being 60 vs lower level. Please define "contribution" because that appears to be a statement with no actual context.
---
Do you not understand the word "contribute" or do you not understand what max level players do differently than leveling players?
---
Leveling players have way less capital to work with, can't add value to the majority of groups that are doing dungeon/raid level content, and aren't engaging with the community via high level crafts (which is where the majority of the economy is focused now).
---
I thought this was kind of an obvious fact, but I can explain in more detail if you need.
---
Coming from the OSRS reddit this sort of thing is so common that people make popcorn for it.
---
"The little boy says ironically as he's crying."
---
Ouch
---
SexyMap works with the Square preset I believe, or ElvUI but that's a full UI overhaul.
---
Moron.
---
Tank not in melee range?
---
I chuckled way more than I should have.
---
Exactly! I brought up class trinkets on the way  the last boss and how it's kind of a similar situation. they all got silent with one later on saying well it's only a blue.
---
Endless WPvP, fee and away the most skilled guilds in classic( 2 of the top 5 alliance guilds, and another top 5 world horde guild) etc. very fun and competitive server.
---
That said if you are a casual player that doesn’t like PvP, you are better off on a PVE server.
---
Everyone should have needed.
---
If you decide to make the trip come say hi 😂
---
What level are you?  Simple answer is ice barrier, blink, frost nova hitting both hunter and pet, poly pet, kill hunter using slows to prevent him from getting into range.  Block and cancel when he scatter shots. Hunter is the easiest match up for mage.
---
Indeed. Spent too much time trying to figure this out on wowhead but only got a piece of info here, and a piece of info there, and some of it was wrong anyway..
---
The fact that you think having a 9 to 5 job immediately means you hate your life proves his point about life skills etc
---
And I just want screenshots instead of pictures of screens. Oh and why did you include “150-225”? As if there is a search result specifically for 150-225 lol
---
😂😂😂😂
---
Aye, those pesky insanely OP mules!
---
Yes exp is 50% of what it was on pservers
---
Lel... I would consider this a big dick move.
---
No clue - the lines between ninja and being a huge cock is quite Slim.
---
I would be super mad for sure - no idea if that would Count as ninja though. He just rolled for it and you made no rules beforehand.
---
It just seems like he wanted to lie to you more and more and you just unveiled his lies :P "I don't want to feel bad" ofc he will feel bad if he rips you off like that... 
---
Never Group with him again for sure - People will do anything for Gold in this game xD
---
Really stupid decision not to roll need.  You will learn from this though.
---
If you’d ask other players to do something, I’m 100% behind you guys, fuck em up. 
---
Asking Blizz to do something..... nope it’s a line we don’t want to trace. Roll on a pve server if you dislike pvp and what derives from it. The game doesn’t have to change to please you.
---
Stop victim blaming. 
---
It being the “streamer server” doesn’t mean the experience has to be trash for everyone else.
---
I missed the inv timer lol.  Is it possible to link one that doesn't expire?
---
They have not yet recruited the one known as The Dayman ^^^a^^^h^^^h^^^u^^^u^^^h^^^h^^^h^^^a^^^a^^^a^^^a
---
Nonono... Kissing does not do the Job.
---
Your tongue really Needs to get in there as well
---
There are plenty healers on server so I doubt that would work to well. But thank you for reply.
---
Too bad you want to be rocking threat gear in 90% of scenarios
---
Lots of healers do this in Strat UD.
---
I think it's a bold move because a healer doesn't really carry a group, but a good tank can. So you're basically getting paid to stand back and heal, promising to not take any BiS items.
---
But hey if it works then who am I to judge.
---
0 spending issue.. I have a different issue. I´m rich and don´t know what to do with money cause all I do is play video games.
---
Only light traffic, get going now while conditions are good
---
Well sort by new then and only look at Videos that are about 1 month old.
---
Problem solved
---
Hahahahahaha
---
Feign death is 30sec CD
---
personally haven't tried that door specifically but can confirm engineering works for the door before last boss in DM:N so seems likely
---
It's not even quantifiable how much more balance tbc was. Sure Destro was broken, but at least "meme" specs became viable and it wasn't just mage overlords demanding every single buff and debuff to create a positive feedback loop of mage elitism.
---
I know they had Add-ons back then, I would have tried not using them back then as well.
---
I will look into the DPS meter though.  That does seem important, thanks.
---
Tbh even the 16 slots are not that expensive at ~25g. Sure the keys take up some space on the bank but with putting selling stuff and crafting mats on twinks (which is easier accessible though the mail imo) no one should have any issues.
---
I mean I went PVE and im Horde PVP so I dont quite get these alliance crying things when being horde or alliance on PVE means nothing aside from having either a paladin or a shaman to pick from.
---
We have 0 hunters. We have dropped several leaves and sinews which we destroyed. We are stacked on mages, locks and priests so we're usually 60-40 in favour of ranged. Our melee consists of warriors, rogues and 1 enha shammy.
---
"BUT I WANNA PLAY WITH ASMON and the STREAMERRRSSSSS"
---
Nice server you got there. You want a better experience? Swap to Rattlegore, almost as High Pop - and like 1/10th the cancer.
---
Won’t work on my realm. Nowhere near a heal shortage
---
Can the Scarlet disguise from the pre “In Dreams” questline be kept? 
---
Like, not hand in the quest and keep the disguise in my bags. Anyone ever done this?
---
Big fan of appearance changing items.
---
Right? As soon as I was high enough to get the Tanaris quest and farm the eggs I went from 225 to 300 in about 5 minutes from all the fish I had.
---
Maybe because our servers are dead and have massive imbalances and the game just launched? What servers back in the day were around 85/15 in less than 2 months since they launched?
---
Yeah you kinda made my point for me dude. If you think working a 9-5 is some dreadful existance you have been spending too much time watching streamers vicariously living in their fantasy land getting money playing video games. 
---
Reality is you will be working that 9-5 someday and idolizing someone who looks down on that sort of thing probably wont do you any favors, but again, we'll see.
---
In all honesty this is making me want to tank even more so that i can dictate where i want to go in dungeons
---
Goodluck finding the time to get to loatheb. Unless your guild raids 4+ nights a week clearing MC in 3-4 hours won't work once more raid content gets introduced.
---
As a person with 3 different accounts that I don’t multibox I can say I loveeee having different accounts. Sitting at AH, or something to do while on a long FP, sit on a rare spawn, or have a summoning alt sitting at BRM, etc. There’s a lot of use to having a few accounts imo
---
I am thinking about the PVP aspect and that is what prompted me to ask this question.  I think I need an edge or to at least get on a level playing field now that I am higher level.  Getting a bit more serious it seems haha.  Thanks!
---
Does this mean they can't MT for a raid?
---
Not really as they are old about old dm content which has been implemented in the nerfed state. So as a holy priest it's not overly helpful
---
Nerf devilsaur gear. Problem solved blizzard.
---
you made a character on a pvp server. stop crying when people pvp you.
---
I like that your amulet is just a piece of goldthorn.
---
Translation: you are in position 9863 in queue
---
Except its actually advice.
---
Thanks for your reply. 
---
Yeah the thing is realistically I won't have time to do any raids unfortunately - I won't be able to spend 2-3 hours at once online. I might try get rank 13 tho. Blue pvp set is most likely I'd say!
---
Yea, the PVP part is what made me ask this question.  I think it's time I start using some Add-ons to get on a better playing level.  Thanks!
---
Newbie warrior here. I am not sure I get you. Would you care to elaborate?
---
Opinions are like assholes  everyones got one.
---
And you know what I do to assholes? I lick 'em.
---
Also, I dont care about your feelings.
---
Any Action removes it. IE: opening a chest or trying to use a Flightmaster
---
Whooooosh
---
OP you get energy every 2 seconds 
---
With a energy tracker addon you can initiate right before you gain energy
---
That's all
---
The point we're making is there's exceptions. If anything,  the more know about and use Spy, there's a chance it will get removed.
---
Your name is so perfect.
---
Literally rerolled yesterday. I got to 60 and realized I absolutely hate being the tank. I enjoyed it up to 60, but now i dont know the dungeons and I honestly don't have time to dedicate to being a main tank.
---
You get about 650 with pre-bis but your mana will be on the low side.  I have 700 healing with 4700 unbuffed mana atm, should go up to 750 &amp; 5k mana after I get new stuff from DM.
---
Having more mana and less healing is fine too, it all depends on what content you're looking to do, and in case of raids how fast you kill bosses. The more healing you have, the more you should downrank to offset lower mana pool.
---
So first of all, don't listen to players telling you that Macros are a requirement. Nor are AddOns. They always help, to some extent, but are never a requirement.
---
If you go herbalism then the GatherMate AddOn can be very(!) beneficial.
---
As far as the hunter is concerned, you'd want to go something like this: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/hunter/0500322150521251-05051-33
---
Basically you want your Pet to survive all the shit. You can change a couple of points around as you think you need but that's pretty much bread and butter right there. Personally, I'd consider putting 1 point each from survival damage types into Mend Pet and that's about it.
---
As for Pet choices, well, there's lots of things to consider. Firstly you'll do pretty good with any Cat-Family-Pet since their Damage is fine. If you're going into later leveling, you'd want to consider a proper Tanking pet like a Gorilla (their Thunderclap is amazing for AoE Aggro).
---
The one thing you really need to master is the movement of your pets. PetAttack and PetPassive are crucial things to have keybinds for. 
---
Ultimately, Hunter is a pretty fun and engaging thing to level, despite the whole AutoShot/AFK-Memes out there. When it comes to Dungeons and stuff things get more boring because you can't do that much in Classic. TBC is where Hunter became a true bitch to master. But for grinding multiple mobs, nothing beats the hunter during leveling, nothing.
---
&lt;YMCA&gt;
---
It was done in TBC
---
And he still picked the fight. not me :)
---
If your into the AH game you can arbitrage items at the neutral AH for a few silver and relist on the normal faction AH for some really big profits.
---
I think I'm even more proud than younger me.
---
i prefer 8/31/12 myself.
---

---
lets me stance dance out of def stance and keep enough rage to execute, overpower, pummel, etc. gets the important talents in prot tree like last stand and shield block for the bosses that hit really hard, otherwise i'm dualwielding in def stance for rage gen and extra threat and more dps. no defiance from prot tree but in the current 'go go go' meta, you dont need the extra threat gen. mocking blow and taunt the ones that are on your healer, let your dps offtank their own mob if they arent focusing on your skull. most pulls are easy enough that the mobs die fast enough as long as healer can keep them up while you do your best to keep mobs off the squishies in your party.
---
regardless, i feel the pain. used to be a tank in vanilla and it was a much different beast than it is now when it comes to tanking. i basically gave up tanking in pugs and only dps. i only tank for my static group.
---
Well if you want DM Content then you got to only watch Videos that are made since it released. 
---
Ofcourse there is plenty of wrong info because nobody knew what to expect but every1 wanted to make a Video.
---
You are always quite safe just watching stuff that has been made SINCE something has been released.
---
Didn't know you were specifically asking for DM. I thought it was Classic in general
---
Along with other replies: if you get honoured faction reputation, you get 10% discount. So 90 gold. After phase 2, if you get honour rank 3 from pvp, that is additional 10% discount.
---
I would maybe care just even a little bit if you didn't say Faerlina... You made your bed, now lay in it lmfao. Enjoy sucking on that Asmon teet.
---
I don't use questie as I think it's too powerful and I like to read the questlog
---
But fuck using AH without a mod
---
I am not sure of it's origins but I know it has been around for a bit. I think I've just grown accustomed to not judging books by their covers and being more aware of a Creator's intentions to draw in a crowd.
---
How'd u level if not hotw? 
---
Leader of the pack?
---
This is def just making Kirt worse too. They opened those way too soon.
---
Don't listen to all the haters. Most people just look up a guide and do what the guide says, and assume anyone who doesn't is just trash and wrong. 
---
Play what you enjoy, especially while leveling. I'm 53 and just swapped back to Daggers, because it's my favorite playstyle for Rogues. I was Swords for less than ten levels. I've leveled as Daggers for over 40 levels and enjoy it immensely. 
---
The only issue might be in raids. Some RLs might expect you to be Swords, because they actually DO give slightly better damage. Hopefully it won't be an issue for you, though.
---
Not really true. We have students at our university (Cologne) born in 2000 and with the new semester 2001 as well.
---
Upvoted because your answer is the correct one!
---
To add further explanation to this:
---
Stacking Hit beyond 6% (5% from Precision, 1% from gear) still yields higher DPS, but other items with stats other than +hit% may increase your DPS more. It depends on how much EAP the items give and how much benefit you get from them considering your personal stat weights.
---
Spreadsheets as well as people testing this out in-game have confirmed this already. You can take the 6pc Shadowcraft Bonus, which SIGNIFICANTLY increases your DPS, equip a Tarnished Elven Ring and then just mix and match the items that yield the highest additional DPS. Popular choices are 2/2 Devilsaur or Cadaverous Chest + Truestrike Shoulders.
---
You only need 9% hit (5% from Precision, 4% from gear) if you have 300 Weapon Skill. 5 Weapon Skill from Weapon Expertise are the fabled 3% you don't need to get. After reaching 305 Weapon Skill the effect of further Weapon Skill diminishes greatly, and the glancing blow cap can be reached with as little as 308 Weapon Skill.
---
Also, if you need a Spreadsheet, search for Bloodmoon's Spreadsheet. Using that was an eye-opener to me. While the "regular" BiS list is definitely giving good DPS numbers, people shouldn't take it as gospel.
---
Thats a good lvl 40 Mount post all others I have seen are uselss and trash no one cares about your dumb lvl 40 mount after more than a month stupid pieces of attention whores
---
I’m already working and studying full time, my dude. I’m not looking down on shitty jobs, I’m just saying they suck. I’m fully aware that people working them know that too. 
---
I’m just not in the point where I go online to trash streamers because their life is better then mine.
---
While this discount exists and is pretty useful, you already get it at Honored. I am not aware of any further benefits.
---
No your not. Supply and demand. People that don’t get this must not understand how economy’s work.
---
Did you even look at the picture?
---
But it can be used in combat, right? And lasts through damage? Say a raid where I wouldn’t be looting etc.
---
Honestly, I love this shit. To me if you aren't willing to put up with stuff like that's why are you playing on a PvP server ?
---
All you need to do to break this mafia is show up with more members than them. I know that take effort / planning / coordination, which is something you aren't willing to do.
---
You know who is willing to go through that effort / planing / coordination, people monopolizing your leather now.
---
I’m so glad I’m EU and far away from all these cancerous servers and the drama that comes with them. I’m having so much fun playing the game.
---
If you don't have 2-3h at once you probably won't get r13
---
I don't even follow that shit, was just using it as an example.
---
People out here, getting Quel'Serrar on the first day, and I just dinged to 39 and probably have to run my warrior ass everywhere for the next 5 levels...
---
But you know what? I'm not salty about that. I'm having lots of fun, and I hope you are, too. Gz, my tauren friend. And /moo on.
---
it's 'unique' so you can only have one?
---
Sincerely don't get why this is upsetting for you. If you feel attacked by the suggestion that people like playing with streamers that's on you. Don't be so ashamed of the things others enjoy.
---
Live in your world, get owned in mine.
---
Don't play on this horrible server. That simple. 
---
Everyone knew this was going to happen and most people avoid streamers at all costs because 99% of them are the definition of cancer. That's why there were website setup to avoid them and only the spergs from twitch chat followed the streamers. 
---
All of these problems with were foreseen and expected.
---
This is a tip that has worked in my server. I am a tank that groups with a priest to do live start runs with orbs reserved. We split them 3:2. If I advertise that I want 3 DPS it fills up in 5 minutes, if I got to look for a healer it can take much longer.
---
No idea I am afraid, best to check a guide for it.
---
Find a couple dps and farm eye of shadows.
---
You obviously didn't read my edit... all those posts talking about how they "nerfed" it were pre-patch 1.10.
---
Once again Classic is built using patch 1.12 so that is all a moot point. Even then reading those comments they are only discussing the loot tables not the Spawn Locations/Routes that a lot of people are discussing with the so-called "Classic Nerf".
---
Well holy shit. I never thought I’d see the day. A Bing search.
---
Play it however you want to dude. You don't need addons to play.
---
If that's the staff from ZF, I swear it doesn't exist. I've ran ZF close to 15 times across a few characters and have yet to see it drop.
---
“This is illegal”
---
You seem to not know the definition of legality.
---
Against TOS != Illegal.

Leveled lotp/balance for natural weapons/omen/thorns buff. Switched to HOTW/NS at 60
---
I don't pencil and I work so loose and sketchy that these take about the same amount of time as a PUG dungeon run so if anything they're saving me from that frustration.
---
Honestly the hardest part of this was the fucking interface panels. I should have just used screenshots.
---
Alright. Keep at it. Alchemy isn't really profitable until endgame. People just don't buy potions before then. I didn't start making money until I got some of the rarer, more useful recipes like Elixir of the Mongoose, Greater Stoneshield Potion, and Greater Fire Protection Potion. Hell, I only got my first flask recipe 2 days ago. I haven't even made any yet. In the meantime, go make a philosophers Stone if you haven't yet and start selling arcanite transmutes (recipes for this are sold by the alchemist in Gadgetzan). It's a 2 day cool down that people will pay you 10g to use (while providing their own mats).
---
Don’t forget those &lt;vampire clan&gt; pserver rejects as well, they’re just as guilty.
---
its not too slow. its just bad. the speed is fine
---
Yeah actually what the hell? This sub seems nice most of the time and about playing how you like etc. But when rets are brought up suddenly all the assholes show up shitting on rets. Really weird.
---
Literally not confirmed at all.
---
A lot of people think this. Also with the insane number of mages on every server you'll have a harder time getting into raids/getting a raid spot in a guild. For dungeons you'll be fine cause everyone wants mages for aoe runs.
---
Our server was medium/low pop and 70/30 for years back in the day. They might offer paid transfers in a year to let people change servers.
---
If they havent made any server mergers in the entire history of the game, i doubt they will for classic, especially this early in the games life.
---
Dude shut the fuck up and go play Pve
---
I read to taunt every knock back including resists not sure though haven't got a day yet
---
Spriest, or Warrior ( with heals) are my picks. If you prefer Wpvp, Spriest. A warrior with blue set and an epic weapon, as arms, is still quite strong with support.
---
/r/2007scape is leaking, lmfao i love it.
---
Most items can be used regardless of your specialization, but there are a couple items that are BOP so you need the right spec to craft them for yourself. For gnomish the most notable ones are shrink ray and death ray. There's also the battle chicken, which has some PVE uses. I don't even remember what BOP items goblins make, but the important one is that goblins can craft sapper charges, which are going to be (or already are) in huge demand for world pvp, so it's nice being able to craft them yourself instead of having to buy them.
---
👌
---
I appreciate the solid reply! I will try this!
---
You think you want to tank... but you don't :)
---
yeah fair enough
---
Cool, it was around 77g on my server yesterday, so they didn't peak that high then, thanks
---
It did exist in Vanilla, at least the macro functionality did (there wasn’t a unit frame though). Shame they did recreate it for Classic.
---
This is my guild on Westfall, Sherkaan.
---
probably, but i'm sure that this is amplified even further on a streamer realm
---
I believe it's called Alliance Battle March, you can find it on youtube :)
---
ABSOLUTELY NOT SEXUAL

---
I think the issue with "it's against the rules" lies in the wording. They say direct communication is against the rules. Direct to me means pure in game chat, because that's all they can really control. 
---
Skype? Discord? Facebook? They can't do anything about that, and I highly doubt these groups are using in game tools to communicate. So it turns into a mess because... how do you actually prove it? They have no actual evidence of communication, collusion and teamwork maybe, but the rule states communication, not coordination.
---
It sucks but... wtf can they do? Ban people they suspect of communicating outside wow? That's not a good idea.
---
I've seen this invite for a while on Old Blanchy. Paddy's Pub is the guild name.
---
&gt; If it were that simple, it wouldn't be a problem. A lone rogue ganking and stealing a devilsaur skin is one thing, but the only way to combat operations of this scale is to have a competing mafia, which is basically impossible for smaller guilds just by number of bodies to throw at the problem, and completely unrealistic for pug cartels in terms of co-ordination - not to mention is hypocritical and only promotes the same toxic mindset.
---
+ in most cases, each member of the mafia have most likely made friends with non-mafia members, They could easily hire people to come assist as well, and whenever they needed protection/extra bodies, those mercs would come and be paid for just getting to PvP.
---

Uh very early on, there's lots of different stun bombs with varying damage, throw range and explosion range. Most popular ones are iron grenades, which require 175.
---
Lol sounds like you don't raid. And if you do you don't use flasks and world buffs and sharpening stones, thorns, heal buffs, etc etc. 
---
Just because you don't personally play with Max buffs doesn't mean no one does. 
---
This bug was causing tanks especially to lose highly coveted buffs because they bandaged themselves for instance

The new thing to do is everyone rolls need on BoEs, so the person that actually does need it and will use the item gets screwed. This supposedly prevents ninja, but in my opinion if the person that needs the item doesn’t win, because everyone needed that’s a ninja. 
---
Had this happen in strat ud... whole party needed a pre bis tanking ring, that I would have happily worn far into Mc. I later offered to buy said ring, and the mage in my party refused, as claimed he planned to give it to the MT in his guild. 
---
I understand people need money, but where is the loot etiquete In classic? This includes bop items as well. The other day in Ubrs Gyths skull of fire resistance drops, 3 warriors in party, only one of them tanking, and nobody designated as an OT. Back In the day people at least had te consideration to ask in chat if it’s OK to need for their off spec. At the very least 
---
I realize these are pugs, and running with nothing “red” so it’s a free for all. However in some situations loot drops that is very specific to one role... an example like the Op sword, book, Pre bis tank rings, and arguably one of the best and rarest helms for tanking in Mc and bwl.
---
YouTube knows all...
---
OK, so you think it was right that OP didn't need on this item?
---
Opposite for me. While you can heal non-raids OK as any spec, tanking without a tank spec hurts, and you deal no damage outside of ret/spelladin. You have to be decently far down prot to AOE farm effectively.
---
If you solely stick to holy, yeah you aren't going to break the bank and you won't need gold for anything, but if you want to play the other 66% of your class, it costs a ton of gold.
---
Ah makes sense. Thanks :)

Currently farming MC/ony with 0 flasks used total.  Seriously stock them up for when it matters.

He claimed to have spent 60hrs a week for about a month or so “farming” thorium and gold and got up to 1500g for 750 stacks of runecloth and 900g for his epic mount.

Allegedly he actually paid for this gold. So it wasn’t really his purchase of runecloth that flagged his account.

*"Why don't we have a druid tank Rag? HAXX! I have thirteen thousand AC. NERF"*

thanks man, i dont know how i did not think of it yet
---
They take more damage than warriors and most encounters are designed with warriors in mind. As a druid you don't have defensive cooldowns like Shield Wall, can't break fear and especially during the first few raids you won't find item upgrades for a lot of your slots.
---
All of this makes them undesirable as the MT. 
---
On the other hand they have better threat generation and are better at changing their role midfight (like tanking an add first and then doing some damage or decursing after it dies). They also have some nice utility with Innervate and Battle Rezz they can't reliably use while actively tanking. Additionally they don't compete with warriors for a lot of their item slots, so it is easier to get more equipped tanks faster if you use one. Considering all of this they make pretty decent tanks for your raid, just not in the MT position.
---
Left right and middle mouse buttons, with shift and alt modifier keys, that's 6 spell options.
---
You can also have shift+alt modifier, which gives you another three spells. 
---
I don't use alt modifier as it's in a slightly awkward place.
---
If you still dont have room maybe consider leaving some of those bound spells (e.g. longer duration buffs) just on you action bar?
---
ret paladins deal trash dps. The guy he's talking about flexes the fact he's no1 rrt paladin, when in reality any sane guild is funneling early melee dps gear into warriors that a ret paladin would use. Hence he's no1 compared to other paladins - because he's getting all the gear compared to other ret paladins that have none.
---
Viskag is better, Brutality Blade is better, Ironfoe is better.
---
Nope they're unlikely tanks. Unless you're really good and well liked in the guild.
---
I wrote that in my post above:

For now I wanna farm the blue dragon sinew from winterspring elite dragons and afterwards probably the winterspring mount.

Uhm getting the hand/leg only is pretty cheap and allows u to focus on other t1 parts like chest head and shoulders, no reason not to get it.
---
Rape and repentance?
---
Yes, even in raids Druids can tank. I would argue right now they are quite strong compared to warriors. Warriors really start taking off with T2 and BWL stuff.
---
You’re Fucking mental my man lmao
---
I have been using mine mostly for bank alts. As soon as my main (mage) is lv60, I’ll be using it to boost a rogue alt, also.
---
Hm my friend who moved to Thailand  that I used to play vanilla with convinced me to play horde on a certain server cause some mutual friends decided to roll there. It was apparently a high pop realm so when the server transfers were announced the group started rumbles about how they wanted to transfer off. I was maybe 5-10 levels higher than the average. 
---
I know my friend’s friends well enough to know they’re a group of people who just hop from one game to the other so I told them feel free but I was gonna stay but I’d be more than happy to make an alt on whatever server they xfer to. 
---
Out of the 8 of us, myself and another are 60. One has been 58 for like two weeks, my buddy is abt to hit 50 and the others haven’t been on since 30, they’re all playing Apex Legends together currently. I’m actually curious if they even have subs still.
---
Not to mention there are like 15+ Olympus guilds, which Asmon mostly just manages 1-3/4 and then deals with shit that gets brought to him from the others.

---
Hurry, grind some cash, buy that axe back!
---
I play a healer on the same server horde-side, and most people are fine. But in the dozens of dungeon runs I've healed so far, I have run into some idiots nonetheless. But I can still count them on one hand.
---
Healbot is very good for 5mans as well. I mained a priest back in the day and it makes a difference, to say the least.
---
Lvl 60 hunter jumped me (57 rogue) while I was alt+tap to look up stuff. I pop a few colddowns and fucked him up with 70% life left. Didn't even have poison on my weapons. Lots of players out there not use to pvp yet.
---
Then do that? This is what I’m confused about. Are you asking for help or just saying what you’re doing?
---
SexyMaps works and has a square option.  I'm currently using it.
---
What's there to disagree about? You came into a thread about someone being happy about something they achieved, just to spout negativity. Is this really the kind of person you want to be in your life?
---
Was literally thinking the same thing. I think it’s there to create pvp rivalry. But removing the names and or guilds above players from opposing factions would largely solve this
---
OP so bold and confident in his post about server collusion he had to make a throwaway account.
---
Do us all a favor and stop whining because you're bad. Find a nice PVE server and stop filling this subreddit with more manchild tears, it's actually pathetic.
---
I feel sick.
---
Druid will have an easier time in phase one.
---
Just 1 thing. It is not illegal. It is not against the rules and afaik people who "run"the so called Mafia did contact blizzard themselves to talk about this issue and Blizzard confirmed for themselves that what they are doing is fine. 
---
Stop crying. Get good or choose another realm. There are literally millions of other methods to farm gold. And you can literally join any side of the Mafia to fight competitors its competitors for some world pvp and gold.
---
I myself made a character on that server to level to 60 and create the guild "The Police" to meme around and kill the mafia.
---
Your computer is trying to tell you something....It's Spontanious Road trip Time!!!

Yeah I'll tell the guys getting beat up because they are gay that they shouldn't complain, because we are being catered to by having gay figures in comics/tv/games. Very good point!
---
Let's give you a simple example. Devs decide to create a fight where after 10s the boss throws an unavoidable corrupting orb on a random target. It then does some nasty stuff and duplicates on another target... And then they both duplicate. And so on. A soft enrage timer simply by the whole raid being affected at some time. 
---
Now imagine the same thing with DI. You time it precisely to use DI on the orb's original target before it hits. Boom. No corruption at all, easy fight. Now you can come up with several ways to still make it work. But that's the thing. Every single fight in the future would have to first run through a "can DI break it and if yes, how can we prevent it". It's annoying and limits creative options.
---
How do you deal with the Sacrifice on Zevrim as well as the adds that spawn in the end of the final boss? And do you run any leather gear like Devilsaur set?
---
Wanna try this with my friend who is a dwarf priest (I'm a human Fury warrior). Any other tips you might have would be very highly appreciated. :)
---
This hunter was so bad;(
---
This is ridiculous. You're making this strange assumption that tribute buffs stacking was abused in vanilla. It wasn't until TBC and then it was swiftly fixed. The precedent is there and leaving tribute buff stacking in would have literally ruined raiding.
---
If you honestly believe that people should be able to stack world buffs for &gt;1000 bonus AP, &gt;20% bonus spell crit or stack HP bonuses. Then you're undeniably a fool.
---
and the hunter started at 50% health
---
Because breaking stuff like this is in the spirit of a lot of classic WoW stories.This is just the first half of one before people start cross-faction coordination to gy camp members of this guild across the server. Make a discord whose only job is to report the location of these guys and you'll have your happy ending.
---
I'm not using codex because you can't disable auto turn in and accept quest. Yes there's the ctrl click option but I want it permanently off.
---
I bet they keep it high and tight.
---
What I do is get 1-2 combo points, pop slice and dice and blood fury, immediately pop blade flurry (so with both attack speed buffs you'll have 50% increased attack speed), then wait until i have low energy and pop adrenaline rush.
---
That's for boss fights. I rarely use blade flurry on single target fights outside of bosses.
---
Dunno if it's optimal but that's what i do.

---
your best option is to go tank Strat live for orbs or there are a couple of places you can farm Ghost mushrooms but i know on Shaz on the horde side they only sell for like 65s each at the moment. im mainly a resto druid for my guild but also have most of the BIS tank gear and start live is how i make all my money. i reserve the first orb each run and i think in my 25 runs ive only ever not gotten an orb once.
---
For da horde
---
What exactly are you looking for?
---
I would say clique is the most useful in general as it substitutes mouseover macros completely. You should also use a party frame that shows all debuffs, not just dispellable ones. (blood fury, veil of shadows most importantly)
---
The DKP system the guild is using gives you points based on how much damage you do compared to some expected result for that spec.
---
Despite being massively overgeared, he does much less damage than most players in the raid. However, he is playing a PvP spec, so he is doing much better than expected for that spec, which nets him a huge chunk of DKP. The players who are doing better than him are merely average for their spec, so they get less.
---
A bit unrelated, but what happened to "no cross faction communication" dogma? I just found out that you can literally rightclick an enemy player and add them as bnet friends, allowing you to chat with them freely.
---
Firemaw is good as i can see
---
Grats!!!
---
So many people playing classic, but you're one of the rare people actually enjoying the Classic Experience proper.
---
No they can’t.  The mafia works by having people at a spot that is important but not important enough for guilds/good players to care about. Then never leaving. A guild going through and raiding it once in a while won’t matter.   They are selling gear to solo players or players trying to get a spot.
---
A complete fabrication, of course. I won't let myself get fishing or cooking past 1/75 until I'm at least level 50.
---
That's how I wound up with like 3 weeks /played in vanilla but never really making it to endgame.
---
I had a high level alliance (around 56) that I ditched due to faction the faction imbalance, albeit on a different server. I'm convinced that phase 2 will mean the dominant faction camps flight masters and grave yards to farm rep.
---
Can someone send me the proof of the cross faction talk? Also, this won’t continue phase 2 so at least it will end soon
---
Yep and this way you don't actually spent a single coin.
---
Not really. Before classic I had my sub cancelled for years, only playing on private servers.
---
How'd you get started with boxing? Is it complicated to setup?
---
What do you mean juggling on the small rock? I’ve been kiting her across the entire room and it’s painful to say the least. 12 minute kills (Only tried twice)
---
As someone who primarily plays horde, the one class I tend to encounter  the most being multiboxed is Shaman.  If you want to multibox 5 characters, a full 5 Shaman team is highly effective whilst being simple to play.
---
viskag/brut is only better if you are human and its slow AF
---
ironfoe isnt better than perd/CHT its only 0.8 PPM
---
Who knew leveling cooking from 150 to 225 would be such a long road?
---
most people in my guild have agreed with other members of their class to only bid 1 dkp on tier gear, which puts it to a /roll. this way popular classes don't spend more on class specific gear than unpopular classes, but if you REALLY want that one piece to complete your set bonus or something, you can still bid to win.
---
Depends. They take less damage overall but the spikes can be brutal. That said even a warrior tank can get a streak of bad luck and take multiple bad hits. That said. Warriors are still better overall.
---
Or people like me who chose Faerlina BEFORE the streamers did. When name reservation was first available many hadn't decided yet. There were only 3 servers at the time, total. Now, I could transfer off, but lose my reserved names I signed up to get.
---
Hmm you're right, this isn't the right track. I'll keep searching for it :D
---
They did, but it was rare. Would go to Hyjal, caverns of time, etc. Constantly back in the day. The worst that happened to me was a message "you're not supposed to be there!" And I was teleported out. Went back plenty of times lol. 
---
So, not saying it's not possible, but exploring is fun and if you do get in trouble it should be very minor. So long as you aren't using it for any gains.
---
HotW/NS spec?
---
Yes it did. And it does not say that in the tooltip.
---
oh man.. its already starting
---
heroic strike cancelling is the new "look what i just learned so better repeat it forever".
---
you do know that queueing heroic strike then cancelling it wont show in any logs?
---
with decent gear and buffs youre never ever rage starved so might aswell use heroic strike as long as you dont get aggro.
---
HE SAID WHAT HE SAID.
---
bad advice.  I don't even play on that server but I'm not limiting my own personal performance to try and gain a moral victory over some guy on a video game.   Farm the gold, buy the set, move on.
---
Were you being childish in general chat? That usually gets people ignored, or at least I block loads of idiots that way.
---
I did it in one run. Just got key and immediately went and got quest. Then ran back and group already cleared trash, killed boss and then turned it.
---
No it did not.
---
Can't find any videos
---
Is there a source for this?
---
Also, is this the intended behaviour? Sounds kind of fishy.
---
PvP servers are never going to be fair.  PvP in a non-skill based game is always going to be a shit show.
---
Mirah Song should carry you through to raid replacement
---
You dont have a clue
---
It is but you need to switch gear for that. (Not always necessarily a shield though, but in PuGs you probably need one not the least they are going to complain to you if you don't use one).
---
Jeez 35 hours to level cooking 150-225?! Absolute madness
---
It’s on other servers.

If you get the skull collecting quest you can murder the ghosts.

honestly i dont think so.
---
I remember one of my guild's longest playing wizards being absolutely livid when PoP released and his best nuke was a drop while the best magician nuke was a vendor spell.  Since magicians were basically wizards with more utility, a pet, and slightly less powerful nukes.
---
That is so cool lol
---
Suit up on flamelash is a great active group. Drunk raiding ftw. Horde btw.
---
A crushing criticism from one with so many quality posts
---
whatever is fastest, so a dagger. your offhand is a poison applier, first and foremost.
---
Go back to retail if you want your hand held.
---
It also depends on the level spread of your server. Are you 60? How many people have reached 60 on your server? Maybe the 60 guild's are taking a break after grinding to 60 and raiding. Maybe your 60 and everyone is re rolling into something else.
---
Mailboxes, you can mail more than one item at a time. Request stop on flight paths. There's more but I'll have to add em as I remember lol

Sitting at 39 and a half here with 22 gold 😂
---
Would this be usefull while leveling? My Warrior is 30 currently and skilled arms, but for some reason he does way more damage when using dual weapons instead of 2h and spaming heroic strike.

My group just ran past him at the right time. No vanish, no mind soothe, nothing.

Let's find a trip for OP and see if his skill increases.
---
I haven't started yet, but i wan't to try it out. I'm probably gonna try it out with a dual account to start with, and if i enjoy it, i want to try out a full 5 man team. I've been reading a few guides, and it doesn't seem like it is too complicated for me to set up.
---
Nice. Sounds good thank you for the info.
---
But is it live this time of year or dead?
---
Lol you are an idiot. Nobody here is envious of this lifestyle except for maybe you.
---
Fairie Fire is free and had a short CD.  When I’m tab targeting I spread the FF.  I don’t think it generates much threat, if any, but it’s a free armor debuff.
---
I have a similar experience ahead. All of my friends raided but my parents were super strict and wouldn’t let me play at home. It was something I was always missing out on and was very jealous. 
---
Waiting for my guild to be ready before I jump in any raids but the day is coming soon
---
Doubt RNGeezus will smile upon me the way he did for you!
---
Have fun out there
---
it's honestly not bad but u can literally hear the virginity in that guy's voice.  the quality of the song is actually extremely high compared to what u would expect.
---
I mean, it sounds like you did normal tribute with ogre disguise :P
---
Just something to consider when thi king about double gathering - you also need to carry arrows and pet food. Bag space is going to be ridiculously tight with double gathering.
---
Fuak I feel like I should leave a comment, just to add to the chadness aura.
---
- goes duelwielding
---
- boss/mob is a heavy hitter
---
- gets parried 3 times in a row
---
- boss decimates him with 3 quick strikes against a no shield target
---
“Healer why you no heal you nub I 200iq streamer”
---
So your job as the dps is to adjust to the tank you have and stop cleaving. We don’t have aoe threat like we used to.
---
Sure, in this instance, your original comment states that cases of people pointing to wrongful bans are always false which isn't the case, coming from someone who's been served a wrongful permanent ban, not from WoW but another OSRS. And it absolutely sucks when you're greeted by a "you're banned" message only to have droves of your lot coming in saying well deserved when its anything but.
---
"Crying on Reddit" (Why do you have to be so demeaning?) absolutely helps, since should it pick up traction it gains visibility which in turn generally gets the devs to take another look. This isn't a hard thoughts process so why're you being provocative?
---
So they make mistakes, but at the same time any post calling out a wrongful ban is someone bitching about being caught? It's paradoxal.
---
&gt; Sometimes i get ganked, sometimes i gank.
---
such is life
---
Layering increases realm capacity indirectly by shifting players in the same zone into different instances of that zone. Because of this the server will let more people on at a time. Essientally it creates a second line for logging in.
---
Yeah, i know 5 shamans are popular, but i plan i am playing alliance, so that won't be possible for me, unfortunately.
---
You played yourself
---
I was just thinking about flight paths last night! And I used an addon before the mailbox revamp to do basically what it does not so I did not even notice that one haha
---
Where is the dang cooking trainer in Booty Bay? I tried to Google it but it just shows me a dot on the map which is helpful but not very specific. I tried asking in the in game chat and just received the typical childish replies of "use google" and "he's next to yo mama". Can anyone give me specific directions?
---
&gt; Ban people they suspect of communicating outside wow? That's not a good idea.
---
They ban people suspected of buying gold or services outside, how's that any different? Both are pretty obvious even though they can't have 100% proof.
---
+frost dmg is pretty shit for pvp tho. You use so many different schools of magic in pvp.
---
Very informative comment!  I really appreciate this breakdown of sorts.
---
I really like how you grouped the Add-on types.  I will be looking into them, and this comment will help keep me on track. Thanks!
---
There are alot of sources for this, i also raided in apes and was a part of the world 1st as warrior, im Devv in the videos/screenshots so you can trust me or google it.
---
While HS is queued up, your offhand attacks gain yellow swing status, meaning they have a slightly higher chance to hit, as yellow hit cap(point where hit rating stops affecting it) is much lower than white hit cap. You can then cancel your HS queue before your mainhand attacks to prevent using the rage. You just keep doing that process between your mainhand swings to get far more reliable offhand damage, ergo more reliable rage gen.
---
Or
---
Dreamweave pieces for those with tailoring and not lucky enough on drops.
---
What's the best addon for seeing average/historical auction prices for a particular item? Don't want anything super complicated.
---
Fun fact, tooltips lie all the time.
---
After 10 seconds the tank should have enough threat on all the mobs that I can whirlwind. No that's just a shit tank.
---
Yeah mages are great - I previously had one so was considering rolling something new!
---
So our DW fury warriors should intentionally gimp themselves so a ret paladin won't get a 2H? Solid logic
---
I think it‘s Seasons of War
---
Other people rebutted the false claims elsewhere in the thread. And I am giving people a little too much credit, it seems. I was assuming that people will understand that the existence of a second layer means supply was not fully shut down for the server. Clearly I was wrong to make that assumption, people are shockingly stupid.
---
The warrior discord disagrees with you and so do the theorycrafters.
---
Deathbringer is literally BiS tank weapon for orcs.
---
They fixed the enchants buff bug yesterday!
---
&gt; I'm wowed by the amount of people that approve the "mafia" in comments (probably involved in it).
---
I dont approve of it, I wouldn't participate in it. But I do think the whole situation is blown out of proportion. Its leather for gear that no one actually needs. They are blues that get replaced by raid/dungeon gear.
---
This is the shit that goes on when on a PVP server and it should be expected. It was like this is 2004. It was like this on private servers. And its like this now.
---
Collusion is going to get real bad when it comes to rank grinding as well. You will find that you will not be able to hit GM/HW without colluding with the opposite faction to farm honor during BG downtime.
---
Does it suck? Yes. But this is what PVP servers are.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPjeNWDsszw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPjeNWDsszw) this?
---
Keep in mind I JUST hit 60 the day before lol, I had tank gear but it wasn't great. Yea I agree healing was a problem but dps are also greedy as hell.
---
they fixed it already
---
I think it is common practice to have mainspec&gt;offspec and I think that's good and right. Yet some people seem to think dungeon role=mainspec, which is just a faulty assumption. Of course dungeon roles often do correspond to a player's mainspec but often they do not.  Especially for hybrid classes.
---
All of this can be easily solved by talking about loot rules before starting a run and not assuming there is some unwritten law. At the end of the day you'll find you have to compromise sometimes, especially with tanks needing on dps gear. That or you just don't get a tank.
---
They aren’t screwed, they just didn’t get fortunate enough to have it drop in a dungeon. needing on loot for gold is nijaing. Unless the party specifies otherwise. Don’t be a greedy player. You are wrong here... anyone can go Farm for gold, you don’t need to be needing on Loot that drops from dungeon runs your whole party contributes in. That’s why people do dungeons to collect gear. If you want gold go farm mobs, don’t think that as te fifth person in a party you deserve to need items that four other people helped you get, and otherwise could not get if you were by yourself.
---
Only need to buy recipes, but the drawback is that you have to level fishing. Grilled squid is a moneymaker for me though
---
No stick to arms, its also better for dungeon tanking thanks to sweeping strikes and tactical mastery.
---
To make his mounted speed seem even slower.
---
I see more Tauren ones then Troll/Orc actually, rolled Orc my self, but if I got offered a free change, I would change it, guess it cause I haven't needed the stun resist yet.
---
Yep works fine for me. Just not a good Hunter.
---
Ok so if you are right and able to support your claim, Blizzard will ban all of players engaged in this activity.
---
Let's see if you are right indeed, only time will tell.
---
You go to silithus and the next part is the DM quest.
---
Ive found wowhead guides to be better than this spreadsheet aswell.
---
Pretty noticeable to me.
---
Oh, for some reason and never thought about using sweeping strikes for tanking lol
---
thx!
---
Yes, my spending now only encompasses gold.
---
and it was also Feralas
---
The map coordinates would be pretty cool. I'll check out Titanbar, thanks!
---
You are in the Barren's until the mid 20s, than come back a bit later.
---
You are the only one who has mentioned the tooltip
---
People go out of their way to min-max even for MC. Not only does it result in faster clears, but for them min-maxing is the name of the game.
---
Actually, you’re wrong. Addons can actually do this somehow. Check the other comments, I randomly was able to do this after testing some new addons a while back.
---
Kromcrush server?
---
I've noticed many more unusual behaviors regarding mobs/aggro/tagging. For instance I keep randomly getting the tag (xp and loot) from mobs i havent even touched, literally standing 40 yards away and havent done anything to the mob and somoene else pulls it and kills it and its my loot/xp. Also one time on my mage I was doing an AoE pull, gathered around 10-15 mobs. Got them all down to half hp with blizzard (no one else touched them or was close), I nova them all at 50% hp and blink away to blizzard, as soon as the frost nova ends they all start chasing a mounted enemy faction player just running past. Something is definitely broken.
---
When you do find a guide, your fp to the next vendor will look something like this
---
Copernic is better
---
[So this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-505030130302215-35502200031)
---
I thought about it and what's the point of Insect Swarm if you're not taking Gift?
---
Thats classic for ya!
---
Don’t know specifically but if you look on wowhead it should give a name
---
I will usually then /tar npc and if your in range it will target then a marker on them. Skull or w/e to help locate them. 
---
Hope that helps you find the cooking trainer.
---
As a healer in a group moving at a fast pace I dont have time to drink + heal the lock up every pull starting handicapped on mana.  If you lifetap to 5% health, dont heal or bandage and run into the fight while im drinking,  you deserve to die.
---
This is why people train mobs to AOE  farming mages.
---
It doesn't take 35 hrs in classic for that. Maybe like 28 or so.
---
What macro do you use? I use
---
 #showtooltip Freezing Trap
---
/petpassive
---
/petfollow
---
/stopattack
---
/cast [combat] Feign Death
---
/cast Freezing Trap
---
and it still freaks out for me about 50% of the time.
---
Whole new meaning to Guild master
---
Yes, you can even main tank all raid content in-game right now because nothing hits that hard. Even if your guild has a strict no meme-spec min-max everything policy, 3 Warriors 1 Feral is the optimal setup anyway (even more for now when stuff like Nightfall isn't in-game yet).
---
The last 250 gold quest item is soul bound but if you get the last stage of the quest you can have a warlock that has done it join the dm west group to summon the boss you need to kill.
---
Honestly if you don't use quest or other addons at all then you will most likely don't need them in pvp. 
---
I for example can't imagine playing wow without any addons but i growed up with wotlk. Having played classic and probably being lvl 60 next week will drive me back to retail because QoL is non existing in classic and i only played it for leveling experience which was and is greate so far. Anything else sucks for me to be honest
---
Get the prat addon to shorten the channel name to [1] my man
---
"It's the implication..."
---
&gt;I'm being forced to respec Resto.
---
And the the typical toxic wow community rears it's ugly fucking head once again.
---
The top tier play is to save rage in battle stance for next pack, that way you have sweeping instantly for the next pull and can whirlwind with a 2 hander for insane dps/threat.
---
If needed you can use your shield + deff stance macro right after that threat burst, or keep dpsing.
---
That was already true hours from launch. Alliance would have to make a conscious effort to establish dominance but Horde passively overpowers the entrance just by outnumbering Alliance.
---
I would say that a threat meter is needed eventually. Pulling a boss in a dungeon is not that big of a deal. Pulling a boss in a raid can cause a wipe.
---
I was able to do complete it several times, but it took significantly more time than on private servers and I died at least 1 time each run. With the mobs spreading out more and getting the health regeneration it just takes longer each run. If the patrol comes down at a poor time it can screw you over as well.
---
No doubt, imagine being like this guy and thinking that's enjoyable, lol.
---
Could you link the version you downloaded, I couldn't find any square options in mine.
---
When both mobs are fighting they're getting each other to low health... this is how priests solo elite quests. You MC the mob you personally want to kill, wait till it's at 5% health, drop the MC and then kill that mob...
---
eh, it's not really toxic, it's just stubborness
---
Patch 2.0.1
---
Oh hey I think this is Grobbulus
---
That looks fine to me. As long as I dont try to move or turn during the animations I pretty much always get off the FD and Trap.
---
Same mentality should be used for lvling, pull 2-3 mobs every 2nd pull with pooled rage. Then kill 1 mob while sweeping is on cd, dont waste rage on execute.
---
Layering and sharding was discussed to death before the launch of classic. Blizzards whole strategy with Classic is based on the fact that they expected a large initial player base where the number of players quickly dropped off. However this was complicated by the fact that Sharding, which is how they handle the problem of many simultaneous players and dynamic scaling in retail, was very much unwanted by the classic community due to it's tendency to break immersion (ie. with people disappearing on zone boundaries) and generally get in the way of the vanilla experience. To solve this they created the new layer technology, which basically allowed them to fill the servers beyond capacity by having multiple servers, and then scale this back dynamically as the population dropped off. However this didn't solve all the problems, as they'd be in trouble later if too many people flocked to the same server. They have to get rid of all the layers before phase 2 to avoid exploits and to keep their promises to their players, and this meant that they couldn't just create new layers without regard for the future. Basically they have multiple strategies for dealing with players who drop off and preventing dead servers. There is no one perfect solution.
---
I had a dps war seriously considering rolling on flamescarred shoulders over me, the druid tank because "its great for both fire resist and threat sets". like yeah dude, i know. Im the tank.
---
Now you have a guide and a map
---
No this is when you enter the city Stormwind. I'm looking for the music when you enter the Stormwind Keep, where the throne room is.
---
&gt; Yeah guess what, anyone can sell the boe and use the gold to get the boe they need.
---
That's not a valid reason for needing on a BoE, there are other gold farming methods you should be using to make gold rather than taking someone elses BiS to sell to buy your own... 
---
&gt;The fact that a certain boe dropped should not mean everyone who needs a different one is screwed.
---
Yes, yes it should because the other BoE's never dropped.........
---
Damn that's a nice haul.  Is that just from orbs or did you get some good rng on patterns.
---
You know you don't have to roll on a PVP server, right? 
---
Also I never said it was vanilla WoW, I said crazy attempts to break the game are in the spirit of classic. Players just have more tools to do it these days. Lobby Blizzard to open more transfer windows if you'd like a solution to the issue that's realistic.
---
https://forum.elysium-project.org/topic/49150-farming-the-dusty-tomes/
---
That's still a personal policy.
---
He's right next to Joe.
---
For real though, I don't think there is a cooking trainer in Booty Bay.
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16072/expert-cookbook](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16072/expert-cookbook) i mean. here is a result. specifically to take cooking from 150 to 225. Expert trainers train 150 to 225.
---
Just do jump runs with your pocket healer (+dps if required).
---
You get drops from 3 bosses, and 2 to 4 Rich thorium veins.
---
Trib runs are good too - or just keep doing Live Strat, with all the tanks doing DM, you can probably reserve all orbs cause groups will be desperate.
---
Also you’ll need a full group more than likely it’s a pretty long gauntlet type event after it’s done mana up kill the dread steer but prioritize the big guy that spans a lil after him because he sleeps party members
---
Prove it did?
---
You'll bounce around between Barrens, Stonetalon and Ashenvale between roughly 12 and 25. If you haven't done the early Stonetalon quests yet, go do them now then come back. 
---
If you haven't already, install Questie to check where all the quests appropriate for your level are.
---
&gt;No this is when you enter the city Stormwind. I'm looking for the music when you enter the Stormwind Keep, where the throne room is.
---
Unfortunately that isn't the piece I'm looking for. I'm looking for the music when you enter the Stormwind Keep, where the throne room is or when you enter the throneroom of Ironforge.
---
Yes posts on here 100% are guilty. If you're not guilty provide evidence in e-mails to them and have the company look into it. Call them. Posting here is just trying to give them bad publicity. Even when you're in the wrong (like the above case) and you flame a company saying you're innocent and they're wrong they get tons of bad publicity and pressure to let a shithead off the hook.
---
Look at all the comments trashing Blizzard and defending the scumbag. That "visibility" you want is 100% bad publicity you're trying to push even if it was a mistake. If it's a mistake normal people solve it by actually working with the companies instead of trying to get them flamed. So yes, people bitching on reddit are in the group of shitheads that I'm never going to believe.
---
As a Druid, I sympathize with this. Here’s the issue, playing the game isn’t about me. It’s a social game with a ton of content that requires grouping, and when the general mindset of the majority of players is that your choice is suboptimal, it DOES affect your game experience. If you just want to quest to 60 and run low level dungeons, play whatever the fuck you want. If you plan on doing lots of high end content and progression raiding, it IS important to understand what role you’ll be playing and decide if that fits with your class choices. 
---
I feel horrible for the paladins that think they’re a badass 2 hand sword wielding plate wearing death machine and then end up wearing dresses and spamming one down ranked heal. Those guys should probably just roll warrior, for their own happiness and enjoyment of the game.
---
Command one of the fel guards during the scenario. Guy is a beast
---
On my server Alliance was camping the whole inside area of Dire Maul. That's way more than two rezzes.
---
he edited the comment because I called his bullshit.
---
Ah i missed that.
---
More to story period.  This isn't what happened, don't care how long you've known em.
---
Hey thats me!  Bosoms on Westfall server, alliance side. Hit me up if you're a cool dude and need a guild of other cool dudes!
---
It's on the "Not a bug" list from blizzard.
---
You'll be in barrens till mid 20's, but you shouldn't do it all in one go. Head to stonetalon, do WC, and in your mid/low 20's you can pop down to 1k needles for a couple quests as well.
---
You don't need to speak a foreign language to identify people's names.
---
The last 3 pieces is 250g total, which you can save if you find someone who has them. The other mats you must acquire.
---
When you are taming a pet you take more damage so if you have freezing trap that helps. But for elites. You may want them to be green. 
---
https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/family.php?id=windserpent
---
Those do appear to be the lowest you can get according to petopia.
---
Am I to late to the party? 
---
Probably been beat to death but I only recently joined classic. Haven't played since bc.
---
I don't quite have the capacity I used to do leveling is pretty slow. 
---
How long has classic officially been out? Am I to late to have hopes of ever raiding MC/ony/bwl again if I slow roll my way to 60 over the next 2+ months?
---
they only had 4 of the 6 spawns tho it seems
---
&gt;it makes players in pvp turn in the direction of your distract, but only if they arent in combat i think
---
&gt;By tides on 2006/04/11 (Patch 1.9.4)
---
Lmao a town near me in Canada. Only thing you'll learn how to cook there is meth.
---
Also a fun fact, the way this buff works is exactly like compounding interest. You can figure it out by having 15% as your nominal interest rate, 4000 as principal, time = 31, compounds annually (once per year), making the formula  A = 4000(1 + 0.15)^31 = 304, 574. 
---
If you wanted you could also throw those numbers into a compound interest calculator and you’d get the same answer. 
---
It’s also interesting to think about that as an actual investment (even if 15% interest rate is pretty unachievable), with only $4000 in principle, you’d have 304k by the time you retire basically if you able to achieve that rate.
---
Thank you, do you know the words from horde to alli?
---
Is there maybe a specific codex to translate? Would like to tell alli players to suck my cock sometimes
---
I recognize most of the icons but could you provide a gear list so i'm sure?
---
Lol I spent an hour camping a pair of meme lord mages spamming murkock AoE in dustwallow that looked exactly like this.
---
They deserved every respawn timer they got after denying the area to honest questing and fishing folk
---
&gt; is no way to combat cross faction collusion without resorting to doing so yourself, which I find antithetical to what PvP servers are about
---
There is also no way to combat your own faction trying to out-tag you, which is even more antithetical to what PvP servers are about.
---
Im lvl 21 in barrens but my mining is only at 15 and just now ive been starting to find ores, it seems like u have to go well out your way to level up mining? Any tips? Also what mininglevel would i need to be for the next zone when i leave barrens?
---
I was in the same boat as you! Was juuling a pod+ a day. I recently quit cold turkey about two weeks ago. It’s only really tough the first week or so. I feel a lot better! No more coughing, it doesnt feel like my lungs are in that much pain/discomfort anymore. If you ever have the thoughts of quitting you can do it! I’m saving myself 40$ a week.
---
Looks like the ones outside WC are your best bet. If you can't solo them, get a buddy to CC it. :)
---
There is no Cooking Trainer in Booty Bay to my knowledge (and according to various databases). 
---
There is however a vendor of cooking recipes named Kelsey Yance who is in the first building you see when you come from the boat - the one most people never enter because there are no quest givers in it.
---
Oh never knew that. So I should do it through a macro then. Thanks!
---
Anyone who plays on that server deserves what they are subjected to.  You're basically all just props for streamers and entertainment for their 13 year old audience members.
---
No, they don’t.
---
Yeah for real, it ran on my MacBook. It's not pretty, but at 1280x800 and low-med graphics, I get 60 fps.
---
There's some level 18-20 ones near Camp Tauraje in southern barrens
---
Having to be your very best with the belief that if you don't you are wasting all your guild mates time sounds both exhausting and unrealistic. Not to mention that this is for a game.
---
If his guild mates were just sacrificing their own time for his class fantasy do you think many would stick around? Regardless, it could be that whoever else the sword would have been better suited for either already had it, had one better, or just didn't want it. Put simply, you don't know why he has the sword.
---
If you want to make people feel bad about things they do it helps if what you're accusing them of isn't baseless.
---
Good example, I agree.
---
Has the best server balance for alliance on a high pop realm. I really only care about wpvp so I play there for that reason. It's truly great for that. Streamers bring many great events such as duel tournaments/large scale wpvp if you want to get involved in that. Mafia is on every pvp server. I personally am in a streamer free guild and you don't really see any streamers unless I want too. I have nothing against them though. Faerlina community is much less uptight than my old server too. Got gkicked from a guild for leaving a quest group once on my old server so that meant I was toxic... apparently he hadn't finished his quest and never told us. I think reddit just gets stuck in the streamer man bad mindset and doesn't want to acknowledge the benefits.
---
Hey it's Frak....damn it. #WHISTLES
---
Absolutely not. Classic is going to be around for a while. People will be running MC/Ony for a long time.
---
Damn, I am playing with pretty high ping so maybe that's part of the issue, but I wouldn't think it should matter with how spell batching works. Thanks anyway though
---
 I play on Nethergarde Keep PvE server and created a Horde guild with my friend. It’s very early days with about 10 members and I think most are alts but everyone I’ve met on the server has been really friendly and my friends list is already pretty hefty at level 30. You’d be welcomed to join and all members are encouraged to /ginvite others so if you ever party with someone you think is good, or even someone you just get along with, you can invite them to join the guild and keep in touch that way.
---
All \[horde\] races and classes welcome. If I’m ever free, I’ll come help you out and hope other future members can do the same.
---
Guild is called Indestructible. My characters are a 30 rogue called Ggallin and a 20 priest called Baaz and I’m usually on every night between 20:00-22:00 UK time, if you wanna /w for an invite.
---
My mate and I duo-levelled in Vanilla and plan on doing the same, but he’s not around as much as me – hence my priest only being level 20. What I’m trying to say is we’re not complete newbies and hope to one day get to raiding. Just time restrictions have stopped us from being any higher level by now – life is a lot different than it was 15 years ago!
---
No worries if you’ve no interest in joining. Anyone who reads this is welcome btw. Hopefully see you in-game.
---
There are some of them level 18, I think near Camp Taurahe. You can try at 16 with concussive shot but I don't think you will resist its attacks. After level 20 you can tame everything despite of being elite with freezing trap.
---
I'm hoping to see how hunter tribute runs are handled live. does anyone know of any streamers to check out?
---
Need some advice on feral tanking. I've been gearing up and getting ready to go into MC with my guild, but a couple guildies have brought up concerns with my lack of +hit gear. It actually got me thinking that every guide I've been reading on druid tanking doesn't even mention hit gear in their lists. The only info I have found is on Taladril's guide which mentions that druids need 8.6% hit to be capped, but when he goes on to mention some gear options there is nothing in there with hit.
---
Do I not need to worry about misses when generating threat? As a class whose only method of threat generation is mauls/swipes and white hits, shouldn't I focus on hitting that hit cap before I worry about stacking a little extra armor?
---
I enjoy it.  I don't think he's under any impetus to not enjoy wasting time,  I'm just telling him how it is.
---
Resto Shammy question. I currently am deep into resto with points in enhancement enough to get 2 hander  talent. Read that elemental is a better split as you do more damage and don't have to change all of your gear. 
---
  Any good specs that don't sacrifice too much of my resto tree?
---
Wait, there's a rogue ability that reduces aggro range? I don't have it yet at 35. I had tanks who started fighting mobs right where we found them rather than pull them to a safe distances (I mentioned this in my post), and also had unmarked mobs so the DPS were just picking their favorite target and DPSing enemies at random, causing some mobs I didn't realize were dying to flee into MORE mobs (I also mentioned this in my post), and I can't chase them because we're all several levels below the mobs in the area and have a large aggro range, myself lower leveled than even the tank so I have an even bigger aggro range and can't chase them (again, mentioned this too in my post). Feint, vanish, evasion, at level 35 they're not yet capable of reducing aggro range, are they reducing them at your level?
---
I mentioned the issues in my post, none of those abilities (at this level at least) are capable of fixing them. I'm actually beginning to learn that tanks pulling enemies to a safe distance is considered an unorthodox approach here.
---
This is the effort of one guild. Alliance are still getting stomped on every single PvP server.
---
Northern Ontario is a bitch.  2 lane, slow speed limits, limited legal passing areas. Far more strict LEO than the rest of ontario... For nearly 2 days. (Assuming 10-11 hr driving days) done it a few thousand times in a big rig.  Id take Chicago any day.
---
Find a new guild
---
&gt; Is there a source for this?
---
his ass.
---
Go to retail if you want a "fair" game. 
---
You don't even know what would make a fair game. Fair has no objective definition. All you want is everything for yourself without having to fight for it.
---
You're not a fair person. You're a greedy person. You're a snowflake because you can't handle other people playing a different way than you, and possibly being better than you.
---
Have you known very many literate orcs?
---
Yup, I don't spend money on other games because I don't end up playing really anything else anymore.
---
Are you even fooling yourself? "I am not mad".
---
Add the fact that you blatantly call everyone retarded cause someone had a theory about you. God, I hate people like you.
---
The fact that you are literally spamming comments in this thread, calling people retarded and defending you fact that you got a piece of loot is the pure definition of being mad.
---
Just let people think what they think. Who the hell cares. Maybe your entire guild wanted you to have that sword for some reason, or you took it from someone who could have used it better.
---
IT LITERALLY DOES NOT MATTER. Rant over. Relax.
---
I'd say everyone should have rolled if they could make use of the item on the character they were playing or even an alt, because it benefits the character they are currently playing.
---
The deal breaker is AQ40 and Naxx. If you are a good player (pays attention and knows his class) your limiting factor is gold. In this game if you have gold for consumables you could basically just raidlog and do well. Obviously you won't be getting into a top end guild but if you bring your own consumables and world buffs and don't cause trouble there's a lot of progression guilds that stay current that will want you.
---
If you intend to be a Main tank or potentially a melee that's different though, as you ussually are expected to be available whenever a world boss spawns in a minute's notice.
---
I recommend you play a healer or caster dps, healers in particular and casters to a lesser extent use very little consumables and don't rely on gear too much, making them way more reliable for casual play
---
Go spoil yourself ;)
---
Yeah, horde stays in barrens for longer than pretty much any other zone. It's just huge. However, if you are on a PvP server this does mean that you're unflagged basically till 20 (except for the couple quests you do in stonetalon), so horde is a lot less susceptible to lowbie ganking.
---
Very fun. Very strong. But singletarget only. Not 1 aoe spell. All you can do is multidot. And Mana problems. Like a mage has. But no water to conjure. Also you dont have any mobility at all.
---
I said the same thing to someone else, but I was honestly never able to do much maraudon farming as Affliction, I was only ever able to solo Tinkerer.
---
This is the most stable guild I've been in my 15 years of WoW. 
---
That's not happening.
---
Gold from quests picks up a fair bit at 40 and up. Not at all unusual for each quest to be basically worth at least one gold. I hit mount at just before 43 after I started saving up at 32.
---
Thanks for your helpful comment.
---
Rose City can be hit or miss, but it's so good when it's done right.
---
Yeah I referred to questing in my comment
---
Jeez, Captain Obvious reporting for duty 🙄
---
ok but see the problem lies where I've done runs where people say "oh that BOE is my BIS!" then we all pass to them, they refuse to equip, and sell it on AH for hundreds of gold.  I've passed on freezing band, maiden's circle, krol blade, and a flurry axe, all 4 of which ended up on the Auction House.  I've had people literally chastise me for rolling need on a BOE they "needed", then they go and sell it on the auction house.  How is that right?  So you're allowed to roll need and sell it because it is more appropriate for your class, but I can't roll to sell it?
---
I have news for you, if Edgemasters drop and you pass them to the warrior in your group, the odds of him selling them are much higher than you think.
---
Well, 2% hit from devilsaur set is pretty good and easy to get compared to some bis dungeon pieces.. I don't play a melee in Classic, but back then when I played it, I remember how hard and important was to get hit capped for PVE.     
---
Anyway collusion for rank grinding was different. They farmed honor from each other. I.e. alliance raid stands and let themselves kill few times, then switch the roles with horde. Reporting positions of other individuals is not good honor farm compared to this "mass gifting of honor" to grind for ranks.
---
Silly question, how do i get the dragon on my portrait? is it an addon, or has it always been like that and just NOW im noticing?
---
To be fair we have a fury warrior going 2h just to have something useful to do with 2h and reduce the intense competition for viskag/brut blade.  We don't consider having a ret paladin in the raid useful haha.
---
Sold it. Who needs it.
---
Blink into range (They don't have anything that you need to blink out of), frost nova, cast. They will usually FD the cast, quickly retarget and cast again. Make sure to hit the pet with nova. If it's a BM hunter, ice block through the pet buff
---
This is awesome, I didn't know you could do that. Thank you
---
"Get good or choose another realm."
---
Can i realm-transfer free off a mafia-infested server?
---
You are a god amongst men
---
Well in Classic (at least until AQ40 and Naxx) it is not so much about the difficulty.
---
I find myself not having much fun in a PUG unless I get a decent drop :D
---
But when I run MC with my guild and we have nice Chats and joke around - that is what makes the run for me.
---
Not the raid or difficulty but the People you do it with (even though that sounds weird) is what makes MC for me :)
---
Bears have tanked all of MC and Onyxia.
---
I agree with this. Getting something with dedicated graphics, means you could use it for more than just wow.
---
My point is, you can always join one whose schedule suits you, and then leave again if it suddenly doesn't anymore.
---
And how boring will that be in phase 2
---
Just get all of the skinners not in those Horde guilds to put an end to it - if you all unite, you can take out that ally guild and end this.
---
Could be you don't enjoy raiding, could be you don't enjoy the people you're raiding with.
---
We have a multi-guild PUG going and it's been a blast for me, but I also have done other PUGs for Ony that just aren't fun because of the people in it.
---
Assuming you’re a warrior?
---
Which money making prof for a fresh rogue alt? (have some cash on main but nothing crazy)
---
was thinking skinning and herb but since I intend to go engi later on then maybe mining instead of the herb? Seems like there is no perfect choice
---
Like others have said everyone probably should have needed on that. But "I have an alch alt bro" is a dumbass excuse, especially for a FLASK recipe. What, he's gonna get someone to boost his level 35 through scholo to craft flasks? Fuck outta here dude.
---
*notices your hate boner* owo
---
It made my life QUITE easier, and i made a lot of money in the process.
---
No you can't
---
NO!
---
hard because of their schedules, sure, but also because it's fucking boring and mindless and many people couldn't bring themselves to do that :)
---
This patently false bullshit. I did just yesterday asshole. Way to be elitist.
---
&gt; Because it's boring as shit
---
The corpse run back into Blackrock Mountain for the N^(th) time is far more boring.
---
It is not, by name, listed in the terms of service. If you saw actions before against players abusing it that would've fallen under one of the vague harassment or trolling policy that leaves it up to GM discretion. If you really want to change it, complain in the forums.
---
I found 1 last night, got the grey angler book tho
---
Simpson's memes with wow classic, can't say no to that
---
Camp Mo-ha-jay?!? I always pronouced camp Mo-jash-shee. Dont think an npc has ever spoke it aloud. To each their own.
---
If you kill a target with swipe, you stop autoattacking until you select a new target and use an ability (if you have rage, or manually hit autoattack). By adding a simple autoattack to your swipe macro you 'automaticly' target the next 'aoe' mob and continue autoattacking!
---
To do this, you do /macro, and make one with the following text (out of my head, will doublecheck when i get home, am at work now):
---
\#showtooltip Swipe
---
/autoattack
---
/cast swipe
---
simple as that (also make the same macro for your Maul etc for an easier time)
---
I'm assuming that this works by queueing HS/cancelling the queued HS every other click so that you can cancel the queued HS just before your main hand swing lands?
---
Just quit this shit game already.
---
You used to be able to “request” a landing by logging out
---
It is not, by name, listed in the terms of use. If you saw actions before against players abusing it that would've fallen under one of the vague harassment or trolling policy that leaves it up to GM discretion. If you really want to change it, complain in the forums.
---
But you don't have to be active. You can get on the vehicle and then do other stuff instead of making sure you are going the right way.
---
Heheh I'm gonna do it anyway
---
I asked the community their opinion on tanks getting unwanted greens / grey items, or first righteous orb from live strat. Same deal, met with a ton of hate. I don't tank for pugs anymore, only guildies, and even then there better be a very good reason you need that dungeon, as we're all in pre raid bis at this point and working on MC/Ony BiS.
---
Dude, GM's don't serve as your personal gameplay guide
---
It's great when you pvp and gotta dip off a cliff
---
Its a great class choice. Especially if the lone wolf play style suits you better. Most grp elites can be solo'd either by pet tank or kiting.
---
You can get out of most pvp engagement where you dont get to open on your terms. Especially low level once you got cheetah. And when you get to open on your terms theres few players and classes that can combat you in the open world. Thanks to all the space for kiting.
---
Grinding as a hunter is a breeze. Theres zero downtime unless you run out of mobs. You dont even need mana, autoshot+BM pet will do. 
---
The whole element of getting new pets and training them in different skills for different purposes is also fun.
---
Right, especially when other members rolled greed because they thought they were passing it to someone using it on the spot. If everyone rolled need and I lost it would have been whatever, but he just pulled a shitty move imo
---
[Mage Wipes](https://imgur.com/60Kd4mM)
---
**that's why I said they changed it for multi class to farm.**
---
I can already get my gold, same with Hunters. This way just made it so that more classes can farm for gold and that those who weren't lucky enough to be able to solo can still get 1 other person and be able to solo still.
---
I knew it too. 
---
500 stacks of rune cloth is just insane. Let alone being able to afford that.
---
The quest I got for Silitus was Wasteland not Reliquary of Purity. I didn’t have an option for Reliquary.
---
This is me yesterday. Human Warrior, dinged 40, and had enough for riding skill and mount...if I sold the Whirlwind axe (which I rarely use as a devoted tank).
---
Thr best part other than the horse is being able to purchase the neglected talents I am missing.
---
I was bouncing alt to alt every 5 seconds mindlessly jumping in circles. Speaks for itself lol
---
B-but if you're solo leveling warrior then it's really unwise to skip on cooking...
---
If I wanna kill farm, I check the auc to see what elemental ESSENCE is 8-15g each, go and focus them. This funded my entire 100g-900g epic mount and continued until I hit 1k gold after it. The market on my server crashed hard after and I stopped. I checked again recently and with the "masses" hitting 60 now, essences are back up to 10-15g per on my server so i'll prob do some this weekend while everyone is living in DM. These can vary but I was averaging 70g per hour with spikes up to 150g with lucky drops. A single hour I had the worst luck (and lots of competition) and hit 30g.
---
When the market crashed I hit thorium hard. A 20 stack of bars goes for about 15g on my server and arcane crystals were going for 40g. I could get on average 2-3 bar stacks per hour and up to 2 crystals an hour. This one though is even more hardcore on the "swings". I've had hours where I pulled none, and hours where I got 3-4. You mostly base this on the stack of bar value so 30-45g per hour with spikes up to 165g per hour depending on arcane luck. All the other crystals unfortunately sell for 1-2g each on my server so I don't even bother. I hand them out to guildies who need them for profs. This method has also gotten very congested on my server. There is a lot of competition but so far it's still decent. I'm hoping with DM out so many will focus on that so I can hit it hard and just stockup like crazy.
---
Oh shit, are undead the basic bitches (i.e. the gnomes) of the horde?
---
I think you can pickpocket or lockpick in BRD pretty efficiently for a lot of gold. That being said, both herbalism and mining can be very profitable. Mining has more synergy with Engineering, though.
---
A lot of specs like this work extremely well in certain niches.  Mace combat spec isn't optimized for PVE or PVP DPS, but as you've discovered, it reduces damage from mobs and makes casters cry.  But this game has become such that if something isn't optimal in Nax, it's considered bad... which just isn't true.
---
How is it in PVP?  I imagine the constant stuns would be tough to fight, but I don't know what "essential" talents and abilities you have to give up to get it.
---
He didnt list block %! He isnt one of us!!
---
Bears eat bread
---
Find some casual or semi-hc guild with more mature people which has some normal rules and people accept them before joining a raid - like priorities etc.. I can say that more like 40% people who are on level 60 now are probable epaxhunters. They eyes see only purple items, this is the attitude from retail and is very bad for raid environment. More chill people will ding 60 in about month or maybe even two. It will eventually consolidate, people are in a rush for dem EPIX, but I really don´t know why :)
---
Maybe it is to do with your pet not liking bread.
---
Maybe it is to do with it being summoned Food.
---
Try high Level meat for your bear. Maybe you have to kill some Mobs with him as well.
---
Just try things
---
I didn’t see that name anywhere, and I don’t find the gender of the person in question that relevant
---
Part of me thinks it feels so different because back in the day we had no clue what we were doing. I swear we died to every boss a hundred times. Now everything is down to exact numbers and its so easy. But yeah I agree, getting that connection with guildies or friends is a major part of the experience.
---
What seriously?  Has anyone else tried?  Maybe just bad luck?
---
I would prefer if this game didnt revolved around mages the special cookies.
---
Except in most cases dps wont even give you 1 second, let alone attack the marked mob
---
Somewhere back near Trisfal Glades is a box full of mixed jawbones somehow misplaced in the resurrection process.
---
Bears eat meat I'm pretty sure. I think you giving it mage bread is the issue lol
---
I appreciate the edit.
---
And yeah 😅 I’m just trying to plan ahead for a Twink.
---
Unless, like someone else pointed out, he gave it to himself.
---
It's not like Horde is particularly organized or assume control either. It's just easy to dominate areas when you have a massive population edge over the other faction.
---
What addon is the gold dragon portrait border?  Looks sick!
---
Look at the screenshots, genius.  I'm horde
---
Psssssst hes /s’ing you!.
---
Rogue sprint animation.
---
Nevermind I think I got it figured. That quest doesn’t open up until you’ve been inside DM.
---
I was a druid tank in vanilla. You will not get a legitimate dps spot. Just sayin.
---
Thanks for your info. First time engi and I'm a bit lost hah
---
HELL NO!
---
Some of those meals take quite some time
---
\-2% chance to hit and some extra threat for free I guess
---
Thanks for the info.
---
This is it.  I absolutely hate having to pug anything significant like raids.  Being in a fun guild with people joking around and having fun in discord or whatever totally changes the atmosphere.  I mean there’s still awkward times when you’re not in on inside jokes or conversations between cliqs in the guild, but it still outshines dead silence running around with 30+ other random people.
---
Yep, this will fix your FP woes for that area of the map. I flew 2 of those Kalimdor sightseeing tours before I had enough and just hoofed it to azshara
---
There's also meant to be potion of swiftness in slot 3 and the cap on my G434 GraphicPro marker looks like it's exactly the right shade of green but THE CAP LIES!
---
Fishing is a great way to get cash.  But it does come at the cost of leveling speed.
---
What guild is it that you’re in? I just rolled an ally mage there last night. Lvl 5.
---
Ctrl:1 to make it attack, Ctrl:3 to make it follow, Ctrl: 2 to make it stay once it hits wherever you want it to stay?
---
The Classic Experience which so many don't understand is addons didn't become mainstream until several months after its release. Millions of people played it without addons of any kind, that is what is meant by The Classic Experience, as it was, not with quest helpers, dps meters, node locations, and in the case of dungeons/raids yep you needed to use instinct and awareness.
---
We're a bunch of scrubs and killed rag with 10+ &gt;60 and an off tank that wasn't even 60 for resisted knock backs.  The secret was 15 healers and voice comms. You can keep calling rag hard all you want cause no one was logging for our first fuck around foray into mc but I'm Judy going to keep calling you wrong because I know better.
---
I wasnt reffering to pyro, more so to all dps generally
---
I think most groups would pass over a tank trying to reserve stuff. Especially right now with a lot of gear upgrades out of there. If it was me I would probably stick with orbs in strath.
---
.... As sword spec you are suggesting a dagger ....
---
Many things we know and do nowadays weren't nearly as well known during actual vanilla WoW. Diremaul buff stacking is just possibly the most egregious and impactful example. Blizzard has elected *not* to fix other gameplay-affecting, but less impactful bugs.
---
Even without tribute buff stacking raiding is already kind of ruined with stategies being well known and players in general being much better at the game. I'll be surprised if any boss in Classic poses any kind of meaningful challenge (except maybe world bosses due to PvP).
---
They’re fine in the MT position. You just need to have a warrior for certain fights. And they’re the best tank to pick up a boss after the MT dies
---
Yeah I'm really jealous of them never having touched a tit
---

I was assuming it's Destruction because that is where all the warlock AOE talents exist.
---
If you'd ever done DMN farming on a private server you'd wish it worked in classic. It was 100g/hr average, sometimes more with close to zero risk.
---
I'll be busy waiting for battlegrounds playing Fallout 4.
---
Happens on multiple servers and has nothing to do with streamers. Mine isn't "the dreaded streamer server" and it still happens.
---
&gt; the last one standing goes for the chest sap him/blind him.
---
on herod there are teams that organise who gets to loot. there are always about 15 or more people there defending the guy looting the chest
---
I agree... same for dungeons. To get into a dungeon with lv 48 mobs and 52 bosses you need to be like 55. Why? Are people that insecure and need to be absolutely certain to never face any challenge ever? I don't mind losing and trying again, it's what makes the victory enjoyable in the end.
---
Not sure what the issue is, are you saying your pet is stuck at level 0 loyalty?
---
Why is the dungeon Stratholme called "strat live"? Why is it live? And is there a non-live Version of the dungeon?
---
SASUGA AINZ-SAMA!
---
Rogues aren't useful either as warriors flat out outDPS them so I'm guessing you don't bring rogues either? It's just vanilla, and MC to boot, there's nothing to be this tryhard over.
---
The rules say killing someone a couple times is fine but camping them is not. Open a ticket and get them banned for harassment. When it goes from pvp to harassment their rules state they
---
Get punished.
---
And I just wanna grill for ancestors sake.

HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Lol you dont know what humble bragging is

Priests are the most played class since launch of Classic, while fun in pvp leveling can be difficult if you want to Participate in dungeons as it can be hard to find a spot.
---
Ahh Bing. You really do suck but I appreciate the effort

Eastern Dun Morogh, there’s a ramp between north &amp; South Gate passes that leads to top of the entire mountain range. Can access searing gorge, badlands, and loch modan with it. First mountain shortcut I ever found

Lower level food doesn't do much for happiness, try feeding it food closer to it's level.
---
Maybe its just early into Classic and people arent geared enough yet, but my guild seems close knit but are so serious in chat currently. Maybe once people get geared and stuff isnt so difficult it will lighten up.
---
"Daggers are shit tank weapons in classic"

Survey of the top Tanks in WoW says....you're wrong.

with a small chance of completely wigging out your flight path if I remember correctly. Can remember logging back in to flight paths going under mountains and things to drop me somewhere close.

What quest tracking add on is that?
---
No other instance shares initials with a 60 dungeon  
---
Checkmate revisionists.
---
This is crazy to me. Never have I seen anyone tell someone to roll greed on a BoE item if it was honestly an upgrade for them or class specific just because they wanted to be so low and just sell it off for money. This just saddens me that there are people like this in the classic community. I have yet to witness this myself.
---
No problemo. The macro I have seen people throwing around for this is below. Also should be mentioned you can do the same deal with cleave if for some reason youd rather that.

obviously the ones enjoying it and good at it aren't complaining about it.

step up, woW has evolved in the past 15 years.
---
Get out with the gaslighting dude.
---
As a Horde player I've been gangbanged by 10+ Alliance players too, doesn't mean much.
---
I have no idea what you're on about now. You can be happy all you want and I'm not gonna say you can't but I'm definitely going to point out you essentially ninjad one of the greatest items in game for your half baked rp spec because honestly that's just lul. I'm not being negative.  I genuinely find your insistence that this was a good idea amusing.
---
Agreed, I'm no longer buying 2 $80 games a month to satiate my gaming hobby, WoW is all I've had a desire to play.
---
Yes, for wpvp and solo questing it is a blast. However, you will have problems finding dungeon groups since you can't fill the aoe role and have a lot of downtimes. Prepare to talk to a lot of mages if you wish to do high end PvE. Furthermore, most serious raid guilds will run 0-1 Shadows. You are only there to buff the damage of the Warlocks and that's about it. You bring nothing special to a raid group.
---
no, you don't.
---
not at all.
---
thanks for this .. makes alot of it easier to understand!
---
I play on a pvp server and love it actually. I did however know to avoid the streamer server because of how it would attract these malding neckbeards with something to prove through a 15 year old video game.
---
Thanks for the insight. What talent build do you use, if you don’t mind me asking?
---
What was your rotation at 40? 43 now trying to find the most mana efficient rotation
---
When you quest in ashenvale, always make the trip to get FP in Aszhara. Same when questing in stonetalon (if you dare as ally) always go through scarred vale to get desolace. I often even make the trip to get Feathermoon Stronghold, just because it makes it eaiser flying around.
---
I'm personally sick about reading about them all the time, Im pretty sure they started the Ape spam on forums themselves and people got caught in their "hype".
---
the sad part is baddies will never know how fast and efficient a good group can be
---
Right well, I just meant that the mindset itself is toxic. I'm not against minmaxing, I'm against being pigeonholed into a certain spec or even class because your favorite one is considered a meme. You can minmax a suboptimal spec or class and be fine. 
---
It's not just wow either, you see it all the time in Monster Hunter. The vast majority of the community is positive, but there is still a lot of elitism about only using the best armor and weapons. If Capcom started catering to that crowd like Blizz has over the years, I probably wouldn't be able to hunt with the Hunting Horn anymore because it has the lowest dps.
---
Lemme know how it goes for you.
---
How does stat optimization change for raid healing as HotW NS vs Deep Resto. I’m sure + heal is still first, but does int stacking become more viable?
---
Uhhh welcome to vanilla snowflake.
---
Defender of the Timbermaw is a pretty good choice. Easy grind, can be gotten solo.
---
Roughly 20 energy* sometimes its really stupid and rounds down somehow to 19 energy..
---
It is definitely a bug and super annoying if you're aware of is
---
Dwarf priests aren't that unusual for alliance. Probably in part BECAUSE of Fear Ward.
---
We have a Enhance Shammy in our Raids and he does excellent dmg.  There are times he WF crits, pulls aggro and dies.  Otherwise he is easily in the top half of our DPS and was actually 3rd overall for the entire raid when we did MC 10/10 last week.  We are very much still in the process of gearing up everyone and nailing raid rotations.  For now, you can absolutely do MC and Ony with an Enhance Shammy.  YMMV on the other phases.
---
It was nerfed during vanilla and we're getting the final version including all fixes by 1.12 here.
---
Its a Scam by the flightmasters to get all our silver.
---
Blizzard only bans for collusion based on chatlogs/communication on their game, so if people are using discord there is really nothing they can do. Screenshots can be easily faked, and blizz obviously doesn’t have access to 3rd party chatlogs so what do you expect them to do?
---
Would it not be better to be rogue in 19 bracket? And level that hunter to 29 or 39? You can get the epic lvl 37 bow for a 39 twink.
---
There is the dead side, and the live side
---
Skarm probably already has it on Fairbanks.
---
Sometimes guilds do be like that.  Just have to keep shopping around to find a home that’s compatible with the level of social interaction you’re looking for.
---
Wait, can druids use guns??
---
&gt;o
---
there are 2 parts, one "live" or living side. and one undead side
---
Unlock desolace, east feralas, stonetalon and azshara fps. The route is based on what you have unlocked. If you are missing links... tough luck kid. You can go back to BfA or maybe cry on reddit... oh wait
---
On alliance side druids are better for Ony. Keeping threat is easier, and we have fear ward + 30 seconds of fear immunity via BS trinket.
---
You typically divide the dungeon into two parts. Strat Live or living refers to the side with the Scarlet mobs, with Balnazzar as the last boss, whereas Strat UD refers to the side that gets to Baron Rivendare.
---
Is the only place to fish them from Tanaris as well?
---
What are good recommendations for classes for a duo to level together? I played BC through Cata, thinking about getting into classic with a buddy who has never played wow. We wouldn’t play too serious, just looking for classes and professions that are fun to level together.

Ya know, I'm usually the wet blanket on bro humor, but this is mostly harmless. Let 'em have it.
---
Crit is worth about ~10/11 sp.

If you go EleM for the double Spell Batching crit, spell power becomes even more important.

It will have a reticle so you can left click where u want it to go. If u do it fast enough u can make it look like no reticle
---
Seems to me your guild leadership needs to get their house in order. Google doc sign-up sheets prior to raids are mandatory in our guild. The raid roster is essentially 95% filled / reserved 24 hours ahead of time. We use a in game dkp system (Monolith) supplemented by Loot Council, which decides which classes can bid for what items. Works pretty good so far. Loot council picks who gets Ony head, eye of rag, bindings, etc. The usual. The officers put in a lot of work on the side and I think most of the raid members are cool with how it works so far.
---
We're a good bit off from it being relevant and it does depend on the AH, but once Large Brilliant Shards increase in value as people stop running dungeons as much, an enchanter can do solo BRD Roccor/Incendius runs for 1.5 LBS per run. About 7 LBS and some other enchanting mats a hour. Will start becoming a decent farm when LBS are 6g or higher, probably sometime between ZG's Brilliant Mana/Wizard oils or AQ enchants becoming available.
---
He has inspiration buff l so it's 25% higher than normal.
---
Arcane damage for Balance in PvE, son!
---
damage over time favors the dagger with poison
---
Np! Its fast to level, because you can get multiple skillups from the same vein.
---
Never got the chance for Thunderfury first time around... stoked and thankful to be able to experience it this time!
---
Are you druid or warrior tank? There is mail FR boots from ubrs that are very handy for ragnaros tanking.
---
When honor system comes out they'll be the ones getting farmed.
---
Any resto druids to give some spell rotation advice in end-game 5 mans? Should I use max version of my heals? Respeced yesterday with basically green AH gear for transition, wondering what to expect...
---
Disgusting
---
Hit stonetalon for 2-3 levels. Then ashenvale for a few and then mop up whats left of the barrens
---
I'd say the number 1 rule is to have fun. All of the stuff you said is pretty great, but it's just vanilla - if you're not going for Naxx progression it honestly doesn't matter. You could clear MC with 40 druids if you so desired.
---
The best part about ret paladin is seeing the triggered snowflake warriors (like in this thread!) getting angry over someone having a weapon that they don't, because that's the kind of people they are :p
---
Oh I've used AddOns way, way back. Basically when we started raiding. And I've always been a person to hack the shit out of my user interface.
---
But I just hate the people saying that it's a requirement.
---
Both keybinds exist. One is for the first special action bar slot, the other a dedicated keybind for pet attack.
---
How is this being funded?
---
I meant not accessible to all meaning horde.
---
I had his stream on while I was playing saturday, and he had a member of his guild who supposedly runs or is a big part of the mafia. There was a lot of drama around the guy, whether or not he was selling gold etc.
---
Not boring at all.  Maybe in a year or two when everything there is to be done is complete.
---
Boggles the fucking mind. "The path of least resistance' indeed.
---
Srsly, leave those assholes behind. And btw if the loot council didn’t clarify beforehand how the loot will be distributed and just took it without saying anything, you can report them and if you are lucky they will even receive a ban. It’s called ninja looting and its forbidden.
---
You mentioned all the raiding guilds are full etc etc, maybe look for a more casual guild. You said yourself that it’s quite easy to clear the content right now, so a non-progress guild will also have absolutely no problems clearing MC.
---
All the best!
---
You think you do but you dont.
---
Hemo swords requires gear, PvP daggers requires a good dagger ... You got it backwards
---
Yep. That is just how it works
---
Here's the thing about classic and vanilla - there's only so much to do at 60. Even back when the game first came out, something like less than 5% of the population raided. You're not missing anything by joining late.
---
Just finished the level 60 grind and started raiding on my Resto Shaman! Absolutely love the utility and options I have! Leveling in enhance was amazing, switched resto around 53
---
What should my next 60 be? 
---
Right now, I'm considering a Mage for legit just gold farming, and using him to fund my epic mount, or go Warrior and tank cause they seem in hot demand. Especially in endgame dungeons and what not.
---
Any thoughts or advice?
---
GMs have stated this is not against the rules. Their recommended action is get alliance allows of your own.
---
Wand is elemental hence why it is resisted and why if you use a fire wand you can’t hit most fire based enemies or fire dragon kin. Why it shows up as a white number instead of yellow is because it’s not an ability such as why does heroic strike from a warrior show up as yellow text instead of white even though it is pure physical damage but it’s an ability.
---
You need to like the players you are raiding with. The strong emphasis on community is just that. 
---
We joke and troll each other throughout the entire raid. It's a blast.
---
First thing I noticed. There's a reason Google reigns supreme haha.
---
I have definately found that dungeons have been hard to find spots which is surprising because healers were typically in high demand.
---
Rogues seem to quiet overplayed as well though... are you saying I should just focus on rogue if I want to do world pvp?
---
Figured he spent around $500 on the power leveling and $200 on the extra gold. What’s another few bucks for gold to try and get it unbanned
---
Relax dude i was maybe too sarcastic in my first post there was 10+ groups LF tanks while i wrote it.. :(  
---
Basically what i'm trying to say is bad groups happen but knowing you can position kind of inside a mob and you'll still be "behind" him in terms of hit% etc, also you should practice using all of your abilities actively to manage anything before it gets too wild, sometimes pulling agro off the tank isn't bad because they sometimes don't know the right spot to LoS etc.  
---
I kind of assumed you were high level also which was my bad, too much retail over the years my man #roguesquad.
---
I swear my roll luck fucking sucks.
---
Sorry the technology just isn't there yet.
---
You arent making 30g an hour "just playing the game". Going to farm spots with a class that can farm is not "just playing the game".
---
Exp leaching in parties?
---
Rested exp?
---
If the mob is green you get less exp.
---
As a holy pally you wear cloth, so you should be getting a whooping, mate :D
---
Because he’s an idiot. He tried to play dumb and act like he did nothing wrong because the initial email said “Buying Gold” when technically he bought power leveling. 
---
Basically tried to play the system and shit. He’s probably hella embarrassed.
---
If ur still wearing sm cath gear in brd you made some terrible mistakes on your way.
---
yeah i think i'll just wait for my guild to level up before tanking dire maul.
---
So all those dumb 15 minute mc clears on pservers we’re just bug abuse runs.
---
Nah that's a terrible rotation (No offence meant).
---
You definitely wanna be going like this and using the addon druid bar, which let's you see your mana in bear form%
---
Regrowth if not full hp, rejuv if full
---
Moonfire to pull
---
Bearform
---
Enrage, maul, maul, maul, maul
---
Do you have full mana? If so, switch out, heal and buff yourself if needed
---
Rinse repeat
---
This way you're benefitting from both resources, rage and mana, as your mana continues to regenerate from 5s after your shift to bear.
---
Do bears eat fish? You could just feed him what you catch? Maybe cook it first?
---
More hit+weapon skill+crit = more rage. you heroic strike once whirlwind and bloodthirst is on cd at like 65 rage, it happens quite a lot with raid buffs and good gear.
---
Atleast it’s light traffic 😤👍
---
my equipment who add spell damage doesn't apply to wand
---
Except... it doesn't? Dire Maul is not a singular instance people run. Dire Maul East, Dire Maul North, and Dire Maul West are the instances. If you don't specify, that's your own fault.
---
A Survival Hunter would have fucked you up instantly :D
---
Stratholme is one dungeon but people divide it into two internal wings.
---
Strat Live means you're going to clear out the Scarlet Crusade fortress. Strat Dead/Undead/UD means you're going to clear out the Ziggurats and kill the Baron.
---
Second boss is very tough as druid tank - you need to interrupt the sacrifice and druid just doesn't have that skill set.
---
Wow forum i think? select a character as forum avatar. Or item restore page might also show your characters.
---
None of the guilds mentioned are selling gold.  Farming devilsaur isn't even that profitable considering that there are 4 guilds doing it.  There's some members of &lt;Olympus&gt; and &lt;Vampire Clan&gt; on Alliance, then &lt;clc&gt; and &lt;DOGZ&gt; on Horde.
---
How much gold do you think they're getting?  It's pretty much 20g a Devilsaur.  It's barely enough to pay the bills.  You don't go into the crater for gold.
---
Daisy dukes in shimmering flats doesn't have the booty shorts anymore, now she wears shorts that cover more
---
I don't think that many people will be pissed about rank 14. Because realistically not that many people will aim for it anyway. This kind of collusion for honor ranking doesn't really affect other people's lives, besides someone getting ranks that would be out of the accessible range for most people anyway.    
---
But devilsaur's set is one of the first things that brings you some quality of life (hit rating) and it's also used by casuals. Compared to R14, which is not a casual target.
---
fire spell damage to my fire wand
---
Olympus is the main culprit now.
---
Vampire Alliance hasn't been dominated Ungoro for weeks.
---
Cool, thanks. Maybe it was the same version but the options were really limited in the one I downloaded yesterday.
---
35 hours sounds about right though
---
This has literally Nothing to do with streamers wtf are u talking about
---
Classic
---
Try Tamar is to ashenvale...absolutely aids of a flight path.
---
They grow in dm. Prices already dropped signif.
---
This is actually an insider deal among the flight masters. It's a way to get more gold from adventurers.
---
What do you mean telling the healers who to rez?  Do you mean combat rez during a fight, or do you mean after the fight?
---
Jigsaw?
---
Honestly if the whole server knows this and you're not getting large raids together to murder these people I kind of feel like its too damn bad.
---
I never said I was envious, just that you seem to have a problem with people living their life how they want.
---
Engin and mining
---
Completely wrong.
---
Same if you are attacking mobs higher level than you, you get less xp.
---
Are there any working addons for auto dismounting in classic? I tried one but I don't think it worked, and if there isn't I'll try and figure out a macro. Looking for something that dismounts upon attack, or activating stealth or clicking a gathering node etc
---
&gt; 35h
---
Faster than expected tbh.
---
Is the bug where you can tame beasts two level above you still in the game?
---
Minor speed to boots and be prepared to pop a healthstone here and there, you should be able to kill Princess just fine.
---
Their insanely faster than in original vanilla dude, i can assure you.
---
People have asked GMs through tickets. 
---
So far, Blizzard has ruled its legal and won't take action.
---
Both bindings are needed for one sword
---
Benediction is a great server, full but no queue on peak times. Faction balance seems pretty good too.
---
They know about the situation, have made reference to it before, and are NOT banning anyone for doing it.  That means that it isn't a banable offense.
---
My group has an enh shaman and what we do is put him on another part of the spiral, between the melee and the tanks, far enough away that he won't knock back the melee if he gets hit, but still close enough that his totems affect his group.
---
Warriors are only better due to having a larger kit of tools, which mostly only comes into play when tanking trash.
---
If better tanking trash is an issue in your raids, then your raid is quite different than mine.
---
There are bosses with a few effects which are better suited for a warrior but ironically it tends to be those encounters and mechanics they hate the most (stance dancing onyxia for example).
---
There are fewer bosses where a druid tank is way superior (Vaelestrasz initial tank, for example)
---
Not if you have 31 points in arcane.
---
Im a druid. And they'll get mad regardless. I get told to kill myself daily for reserving orbs in strat.
---
&gt;but it's only useful as cc if you pull more than one mob so you can 1v1
---
Exactly, and using it together with magma totem so the magma totem doesn't take aggro.
---
Good for them.. i'd rather kill myself than spend entire days and hours stopping people from farming leather in fucking WoW.
---
No we made sure to test on mobs that were yellow for each of us.
---
Ah how much I’ve missed the stupidity of embriel.
---
That involves messing with npcs though, which is easy to arbitrate. If blizzard bans people for walking on top of stealthed rogues to reveal their position, what’s to stop a rogue from walking underneath an oblivious person and getting them falsely banned? It’s impractical to regulate, and would result in a lot of false positives due to either mistakes or trolling.
---
What I’ve gathered so far is that as long as the lure is touching the school, it counts. It doesn’t need to be fully *in* the school.
---
This is something you’ll get a feel for after fishing a few schools
---
I know two people in real life who purchased power leveling services and both were banned within 1 day of hitting 60, but only for a month.
---
&gt; Microsoft Search
---
Well there's yer problem!
---
My guild ran MC last night and no one got any gear from the first 3-4 bosses. They didn’t want to spend DKP because they’ve bought into the madness that is BiS; “Why am I dying??” - Warrior with Truestrike that gives no Stamina)
---
When you tokenize the system, people game it. Now a bunch of classes are saving up for the exact same items and they have to compete with each other when they drop. Good luck.
---
DKP isn’t necessary and rolls are random. Some people get fucked but most don’t. Our Druid got 5/8 Cenarion in one run because no other Druids ran. Cool. Didn’t have to spend DKP because they didn’t have to bid. So now this class has DKP and everything they want. That also reduces things to a chance.
---
If meta is fast weapon, how is deathbringer bis at that slowass speed?
---
There was an addon called VanillaGuide for 1.12 that is similar to what you described.  It's been revamped into [ClassicGuide](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classicguide).  It still has some of the same misinformation and typos, etc.. but it's not bad.
---
[Oh I dunno, he could have used snipping tool and uploaded to imgur (like he already did). Then used his phone to link the picture (if he only uses reddit from his phone like you).  
---
It's not even that hard to upload a picture to imgur from a computer, you don't even need to save a copy. You can literally copy paste the picture into imgur. But hey, you be you.. keep doing things the backwards way.](https://i.imgur.com/CH1Rhpy.png)
---
According to [WoWWiki](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patches/1.x), patch 1.12.? lasted from August 22nd 2016 to December 5th 2006, when 2.0.1 was released in anticipation to TBC's launch.
---
That's nearly 3½ months, which is longer than any other patch lasted, with most patches lasting ~2 months, on average.
---
Obviously, that's much less time spent playing 1.12 than all prior patches combined, if that was your point, but that's still the patch where the game's balance and mechanics made the most sense (pre-TBC), when most classes had had their talents and abilities reworked.
---
ie.: I wouldn't play Priest with the long ass casting times and [pre-1.10 talents](https://web.archive.org/web/20060203044903/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/priests/talents.html).
---
Also as a Druid tank you should be ready to save the group when shit hits the fan. Like healing the healer, cc a mob or dps-kill last percentage of a boss if necessary. Adaptation. This is the strength of a Druid.
---
I very rarely use my Max rank, I usually spam heal rank 4, and keep a max rejuv on the tank for a quick swift end when needed
---
Only time I’ll use a Max rank in a 5 man is when paired with natures swiftness for a big heal
---
Bug number 1749 has been fixed.
---
Still only 56, 4 more levels and I can use it!
---
Im not pre bis. im raid bis from MC/ony etc
---
Fish! It works well! There's even a lake in the way!
---
Get Leatrix. It's basically a classic wow quality of life addon that has an option to do that as well as many other things.
---
I agree. I ran sweeping strikes/prot for a while and liked it most of the time. But a few times the dps was a bit too eager and I didn’t get time/rage for both ss and ww (I then do zero threat instead) and therefore tried ww only. It’s easy to hit a parry or two and then you’re probably better off with a shout or even tc for the early threat. I use Mirah’s Song, so just one ww isn’t that much damage.
---
Below 60 I used 2h so can’t really compare. Will probably do more and more 2h ww openers as I gear up though.
---
Addons are not required.  
---
Same as it's not required to play WoW with keyboard - you could play using mouse only.  
---
It's just much easier to play with addons, they make your life more comfortable.  
---
Take a Bagnon, that combine all your bags into one. Is it changing gameplay? Nope. But it make your inventory management more simple, allowing you to focus more on mob killing, questing, etc.  
---
Or SexyMap with SimpleSquare preset - it make minimap square, so you see more surroundings. It doesn't affect herb/mineral nodes, they still appear in same round area. But it allow you to see map geometry better, saving some seconds on selecting proper way.  
---
So addons simplify something, giving you more time to spend on some other tasks that you may like more.
---
That equals around 56 runs, encounting the one guaranteed drop. Onne run is around 60 min one orb is around 25g.
---
So you played 56 hours in one weekend, not counting repair ways back etc.
---
Yeah buddy ....
---
They wouldn't need him to do anything anymore, we have like a billion hours of his character on HD video and audio. If they wanted to they could have a 100% walking/talking virtual Trabek host the show indefinitely, I dunno if the public is ready for something like that though.
---
My guild’s main tank is a bear.
---
[deleted]
---
You need to kill bosses to gain dkp, you also need others to get loot so they spend dkp. 
---
Helping others get loot, opens up for when you are the only one spending dkp.
---
Dkp is basically suicide kings with numbers.
---
It is still more reliable than everything outside of Blizzard's own original databases. Obviously, a lot of drop rates were off, especially for quest items, since those are conditional drops, but all in all, with everything being relative and since we don't have access to anything that is more reliable, that data is as reliable as it gets and certainly more reliable than data from private servers, afaic.
---
Right, gotcha.
---
Thanks.
---
I actually know the guy and he actually did grind the gold and didn’t purchase it... he bought Power Leveling like a dumbass and tried to play it off that Blizz was after him for buying gold not leveling. 
---
Obviously he didn’t understand that RMT is both gold and leveling services loooooool.
---
I love guild drama. I've been in so many different guilds over the years and seen so many rage quits and loot fights that I'm completely immune to any emotion regarding it.
---
Instead I just have a good laugh watching people being completely unreasonable about petty things (kinda like watching "The Office" UK).
---
I usually have a couple of guild mates that I play more with and get along in general and we have a great laugh making fun of all the in-fighting.
---
Check out this comment on [Wowhead](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20219/gnomish-engineer). 
---
If you want to min/max Engineering, you'll want to level Gnomish Engineering, craft all the Bind on Pickup items that it allows you to make (most of them can be used without the specialization), then drop Engineering, re-relevel it again and switch to Goblin Engineering.
---
You want to do it in this order because Gnomish is monstly trinkets and items that you can craft and use after you drop Gnomish engineering, whereas Goblin Engineering allows you to craft a couple different explosive consumables, so if you went Goblin, then Gnomish you'd have to continuously buy the explosives if you wanted to use them, but you're not missing out on anything Gnomish (other than the World Enlarger and Transporter) after you switch to Goblin.
---
If you don't want to min/max and level both, you have to pick between fun Gnomish items, or useful exposives from Goblin.
---
Why does it matter so much to people specifically on this sub? 
---
You could do all those things, sure... but some Reddit phone apps have a button that automatically uploads to imgur from cam. So you could alternatively just snap a picture and press “upload image” on your phone instead of snipping tool, save pic, navigating to Imgur, uploading the file, going to Reddit, linking the pic, and deleting the pic from your HDD. 
---
It’s not hard, of course. But for some folks just taking a phone pic and uploading it is like four fewer steps. I don’t share pics here either way, but I gotta defend the lazy because I am a lazy.
---
It isn't usable for damage/pulling. But that slot can only be filled in phase 5 when relics become available, so why not just keep that in there?
---
I somewhat dislike all-in-one macros that changes stances AND weapons.
---
The thing is that some spells require only a stance, not a specific weapon. Changing stance AND weapon adds a CGD that fuck up the flow before and after the spell.
---
I’ve heard about this an was wondering if it’s ever been officially acknowledged by Blizz? Have two rare spawn pets right now and would be pissed if I lost em due to a bug. Guess I should be safe and screen shot them both now just in case. Might run with a third pet I don’t care much about too.
---
I feel like Mages should be considered lawful as they need to obey the laws of physics/arcane/magic and Warriors can be noble or absolute monsters.
---
experienced resto druid here.  I keep three ranks of HT bound: 4, 8 and 10.  I pretty much only use 10 with natures swiftness as a oh shit button.  Think of regrowth as another safety button if you have the mana and need a faster heal to go off.  Rejuv is good for a tank / lower ranks are good to top people off (this is only if you have the mana to do so).  Try to heal in bursts so you can be back in the 5 mana regen mode as much as possible.  dont discount tranquility if the whole party is seemingly taking equal dmg, although if can be interrupted.
---
Thanks, I’ll get it. Funnily enough I think I have Leatrix Maps but not actual Leatrix lol
---
Fuckin goblins. Hate them.
---
I'm on Stalagg which is full but heavily skewed towards Horde
---
&gt;Before anyone knew who he was
---
Idk about that man, unless you're talking about 2006 lol
---
Feelsbad for all the people /whooshing at your comment tbh.
---
Sure thing. 
---
First of all any feral tank needs to get 1st tier talent "Ferocity" reducing maul and swipe rage cost by 5.  This is 100% mandatory for any feral build, a no brainer. 
---
Swipe is now 15 rage, although you're somewhat likely to crit with either your autoattack or one of the three swipe attacks which would make it's effective cost 10 rage most of the time assuming you have the feral talent "primal fury" which gives +5 rage anytime you crit. 
---
Maul costs 10 rage, but it also means you DO NOT generate rage from your autoattack which usually is about 7-8 rage in my experience. So maul is basically the same rage cost as swipe.  Maul does 2x the damage of swipe at least, and does more damage the more +str or +ap that you have.  Swipe doesn't scale with your attack power, but does scale with your crit. 
---
So we've established that maul does 2x the damage (at least) of swipe.  But there's also a threat modifier on maul, where it causes bonus threat based on the damage it causes.  So it pulls WAY ahead of swipe single target.  While your actual DPS as bear lags behind everyone, you do +145% threat as a base in bear form, plus about a 2x multiplier on Maul, so you're basically doing about 3x the threat of normal with your mauls.  For comparison sake, my bear form DPS as a level 47 tank is about 70-80 with maul.  But the effective THREAT I'm generating is close to 215-230 which is beyond what anybody at my level can do without popping some big cooldowns. 
---
Additionally, in order to pull threat, someone has to go like.. 125% beyond your threat or something like that.  So if I'm doing basically 250 threat per second, someone has to actually push 325+ to pull it off. 
---
So what does it all mean?  Maul will convert rage into a lot more threat than swipe will, although swipe does slightly more DAMAGE. 
---
Usually I swipe once early in a pull to get that 'baseline' threat on the group.  If it's a difficult pull or there are elites + nonelites then I will also demo roar to make sure I have some threat on all monsters so the healer doesn't take aggro immediately.  Thorns will also help a lot to get this baseline, AOE threat.  But after one swipe, I maul the focus, then alternate between mauls on the focus target and other targets.  You can't ignore the focus target, but generally a big fat maul at the beginning of the pull will buy you plenty of time to get a few attacks on the other targets, thus building up a nice threat lead.  You can still fall back on taunt on the focus target if someone else pulls it, and focus your maul back there to hold it. 
---
Make sense?
---
I really feel like I should know better. Hell. I played from vanilla all the way through Legion.
---
And my highest fishing ever was 120. I passed that in classic in about two hours maybe. Shame.
---
I've seen two drop once in ten runs...
---
If your guild already has tanks its understandable.  We have Druids that want to tank but already have 2 warrior tanks so outside of offtanking it's not really needed.
---
But they spec 0/30/21 and offtank things like Garr / Sulfuron etc when needed.
---
But yeah most of the time they are healing because it is usually more useful than another melee dps.
---
I'm not sure what would cause it but why would your only option be to level without him? He's getting less than 4% more xp per kill on those enemies while the amount of xp he needs to level is something like 7% more than what you need, he's not going to get further ahead of you from it.
---
Post fight
---
50-65g
---
You may not realize it but you probably just have a much lower tolerance for bullshit now
---
Higher levels get a higher % of mob xp in a party.
---
If you both solo the mob out of party, you'll both get the same xp.
---
The increased xp per kill does not widen the gap. A level 38 needs 6.2% more xp to level than a level 37. And there's only a 3.9% xp per mob differential. So you'll always be closing the gap, just a bit slower.
---
Tremor totem may work, it may not. That's half the fun!
---
That dropped for me yesterday.
---
How much money you get w/o books? Is 30-35gph too optimistic?
---
You are much nicer than me, I reserve all.
---
Yeah he’s either trolling or an idiot
---
Screenshot/10
---
Fair point. I personally kind of regret having to go cat at 20 sometimes. Just love the way it feels to run around with that big bear model.
---
This guild definitely isn’t doing it right, but there are in fact people out there not “getting horny” over drops in a video game. 
---
Why would someone on a loot council pass on an item? For the good of the guild. To reward someone else putting in time and effort. Because they care about the raid environment and the longevity of the guild. 
---
If you want to do DKP that’s fine, but to be completely honest the only reason most people write off loot council is because they only played in vanilla where DKP was the go to system and they label LC as a “retail” thing. 
---
Fact is that a lot of returning players in Classic are just greedy, impatient when it comes to gearing up, or just immature when it comes to this type of thing.
---
You can sell the relic coffer keys? That's actually very helpful, thanks :)
---
They can switch into the stance when the ground starts shaking and back out of it right after the fear.
---
Get walking.
---
Although this involves another respec, you can respec to disc/holy for PI and some holy crit which will increase your viability for solo play(and make you a favourite healer for casters in raids) as you don’t sacrifice a lot healing ability in this spec
---
You don’t have to use voice if you don’t want
---
Except GMs have said they won't take any action in Ungoro for cross-faction collusion.
---
Yes, that's my problem with Princess. Not so much the time (it is still bad) but the intensity. One bad move around the boulder and it's Kodo Graveyard time.
---
I wound up using this spec in my 50s, its pretty solid for solo questing/grinding/wpvp. The sustained damage sucks for instances but it wont get you kicked or anything.
---
Find a rogue friend, sell anger forge stealth runs to rogues paying 200g on drop, or duo dm with rogues on tribute.
---
Big money.
---
Levitate doesn't prevent you from sliding down steep terrain.
---
When you are in a party with someone the total experience from mob is calculated, then it's spread out between the players in the group and that spread depends on level. So if you are higher level than someone you will always get a larger portion of the experience.
---
Easy to get to 150 cooking and fishing in thunderbluff at the little pond, only takes about a half hour
---
They've made it pretty clear that you are either a mage and set for cash or not-a-mage and fucked. So I vote mage.
---
It's funny how you were super condescending toward OP, then repeated exactly what he said.
---
Animals will not eat food that they don't like. Bears also do eat bread.  You can check the combat log to see how much happiness food gives your pet.
---
Low level, call center GMs mean literally nothing and their word isn't worth the keyboards it's typed on.
---
I leveled as [subtlety](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhebotzZhZxMe0cGRo) because I enjoy it, but anything with blade flurry is going to be good enough for most pve.  I'm trying to put together a build that has both blade flurry and prep... but it just seems lackluster without the assassination talents.
---
Okay except I'm already herbing in order to get raid mats my main needs.
---
Try again.
---
I'm glad you said this I just woke up to your comment and it made me happy if you are on fairbanks let me know and I'll help you in any way i can
---
Without proper gear fury prot is both lower threat AND lower survivability. You get threat by doing damage. With crappy gear, you dont do damage. You mainly survive due to abilities from the prot tree and your shield as long as you have crappy gear. As DW fury prot you have neither, again toppling over without doing damage and keeping aggro. 
---
With low amount of gear deep prot &gt; fury prot in all regards.
---
Make your own group, and set the loot to need before greed or what ever it is, problem solved
---
59 and a half, so I'm just trying to find out decent ways to farm when I turn 60
---
that's what you get for using "microsoft search."
---
Effective stance danceing, calculating the cd of BT and your next rage generations are all part of beeing a good dps warrior.
---
Im full bis with ironfoe and mirahs, i literally need to spam HS so i dont get ragecapped every 5 seconds.
---
The gear scaling is so broken, thst pre raid bis feals like full t3 -rage gen wise.
---
More like 50/50 since you are dependent on proccs
---
GM's are low paid customer reps and most say whatever they feel like it, Blue posts are "canon"
---
I bought a level 50 green sword off the AH for like 4g. It’s better than your weapons and has a 1.5 speed.
---
If only it was possible to use cat/bear models from Retail ...
---
Yea but 8 additional slots are behind my epic mount,  priest robe, eye of shadow and hide of the wild on my to buy list
---
I tank all the instances I run...and when I got the Whirlwind Axe I gave the whole 2h tanking thing a try.  It's...kind of amazing how much easier it is.  Not for every group.  If the healer is struggling or you're otherwise losing health way too fast, for sure go back to the shield.  But for trash, tanking with that 2h is kind of great.
---
What class and what level are you?
---
I was gon a throw those in the next one since North has fewer quests
---
I think what you're trying to ask is how do you make a pet run back to a set location after attacking? 
---
1. Move to location you want your pet to stay and click the clock icon on pet bar (makes pet remember that spot and will stay there)
---
2. Order pet to attack monsters
---
3. Click pet passive button and your pet will run back to the spot you told it to stay in
---
I recommend binding your pet attack and pet passive to a separate key to make it easier if you're doing something like dire maul tribute farming
---
Man... the first time tanking and downing Rag, what a thrill. He was always that boss that "some people downed when it was current a long time ago and it was a big deal". 
---
Now? I'm that guy. We downed rag with 45 minutes to spare before submerge the first week with Onyxia buff. Last week we got him down with 8 seconds to submerge without the Ony buff. 
---
PS: OP you can get a good fire resist set just from dungeons. You don't need anything crafted. I hit 350 FR when fully buffed in raid (FR totem, FR pieces from BRD / LBRS/ UBRS, FR buff from mind controlled Spellbinder (lasts an hour) in LBRS, magic resist potion, etc). From what I've been told, going over 315 is pointless.
---
The bracers from BRD have a 3% chance of rolling shadow wrath ontop of needing them to drop. I would be happy just using T1 if it ever dropped or finding a green pair on the AH.
---
I was doing Ancient Egg on my 45 Ally alt, ran into two separate groups of horde about half way up temple, they were clearly just killing elites for exp.  One starts emoting towards me and the cave, I did a couple emotes.  Next thing I know their little herd of cows runs in an smashes all of the elites all the way up to egg for me.  Cruised in, got it, sent a thank you and went on the way.
---
Things have been pretty civil on Heartseeker without any real PvP benefits yet.  Often both sides seem to work together on things.  Obviously phase 2 will change everything, I think mostly people are just bored of PvP that doesn't yield any benefit.  Half the time due to dynamic spawns it's better to have more people there farming the mobs anyways unless your the sole party requiring it.
---
I use your dungeon playlist religiously! You put out great guides and the whole part about where all the quests are, I want to give you some wow gold for that lol.
---
You have helped me tons. I try and recommend your guides anytime I can bring it up.
---
Again, thank you so much, I really do appreciate the work you put forth.
---
Do you do stuff like this often? Is this something you want to do more? How can ppl support you or give back for the help you have given?
---
Patently false bullshit? A guy with a priest flair asked if it was easy to solo and you gave him directions to go deep frost aoe spec.
---
Pull your head outta your ass.
---
Define retail. Because the earliest distinct memory I have of this is in ICC where Tirion skyscrapers over the player in the entrance.
---
&gt; Which addons make healing easier? I've seen Healbot being mentioned but I don't understand what it does, even with videos
---
I'm probably not the best one to ask... I hate Healbot, but it allows you to bind certain keys to mouseovers on frames. Basically instead of targeting each person then casting the spell, it lets you hover over them and click a certain button to cast each spell.
---
Personally I prefer the flexibility of using Clique to bind mouseover macros (because binding the spells directly doesn't work correctly for the healing priority I use i.e. target,mouseover,self).
---
I am. This Reddit is so full of projection, with people thinking everyone is a streamer copying monkey just because they personally are. 
---
No, a lot of people got into classic because they were nostalgic about what they played back in 2005, which wasn't always warrior or mage in full BiS PvE gear - which was nearly nobody back in the day.
---
Just because you don't win a roll doesn't make the roll not fair. For distributing items like the Mageblade I think rolling, with certain controls, is actually the fairest approach by far.
---
- **DKP and variants:** You get the item if you ignore all other loot and blow weeks or months worth of points on it. Most of your raiders will be forced to do this if they want the item, which may lead to dusting loot in the worst case.
---
- ("raw", absolute) **Loot council:** You get the item if you stroke the officers' cocks enough. Fact is that the skill cap in vanilla raiding, and raiding in general, is so low that there will virtually always be multiple people equally deserving of big items like Mageblade. How do you decide between those people? That's where the dick-sucking comes in.
---
- **Pure rolling:** You get the item if you get lucky. Raid McLogger might also get the item while doing 50% the DPS you did. Sure, that sucks, but at least it doesn't fuck over your entire loot distribution like DKP or incite drama and favouritism like loot council.
---
- **Objectively best system:** Officers pick worthy players, or rather exclude unworthy players, and the chosen players roll for the item. This is basically what loot council *should* boil down to in Classic, because in my experience in any given raid in a decent guild anywhere from 50% to 90% of your players will be performing equally well.
---
I unfortunately fucked up my first couple respecs because I'm retarded and so I want to just stick with my current one rather than spend ~50g to respec two more times.
---
Might just try to sneak into Strat/Scholo groups on the way to 60 then.
---
You wouldn’t last 5 seconds in real vanilla or private servers.
---
Yeah, I winged that one in all honesty :p
---
Herod, whitemane and pagle
---
You can also have a line to make it cast on cursor location, so you never get the reticle.  Don't recall what it is but it worked in vanilla for distract.  Didn't keep it because I needed to know exactly who would be in the radius.
---
Both wont be truly valuable for a while. I've had macaw for about a month and no one is biting. You can put it up there for 200g but unlikely to sell, or hold it for later when people have more gold and less needed items to buy
---
Read the first word of the title of the post
---
This, but unironically.
---
Fish fucking on the other end...
---
I call it "The circle of blood"
---
Druid, but thanks.
---
Hey Epcon from &lt;Best friends club&gt; checking in. I too recognized the names, lol.
---
Nop its out , got mine yesterday but the total cost. Was like 380g lol still better than the 500g i spent for blue sinew
---
one more free run for ballz' head and learning the pulls then i'll start reserving an orb.
---
I did something like this: https://www.bobo-talents.com/?c=paladin&amp;t=GJGKGLGMGNG8G9G_GTGUGYGZG0GVGWGXHVHWHXG1IaG3G4G6G5G7G.G~G-HaIbHBHCHDHEHFHcHdHeHgHfIUGwGxGyGzGAINIOG2Hb
---
I guess I just don't mind as much now. I 2H tank with an earthshaker so its fun for me.
---
Has blizzard got any plans for the future of Classic? what I mean by this is, will it be stuck in vanilla version forever? are they planning on adding new content to the same expansion? Are they gonna release a 'classic Burning Crusade' at some point? My guess is, as much as people love Classic now.. after a few years, the playerbase will start to decrease at some point?
---
Do you understand how sword spec works? Use a fast oh sword. You go look it up
---
Check twink guides.  They aren't optimized throughout the leveling but they can show you how a 19 twink can get over 2k hp.
---
from my experience its 30g per/h and it goes up to maybe 45 g per/hr  with herbs. Depends if they keep tanking in gold
---
I really appreciate the kind words! :) The best way to give back is to just watch my videos, I don't want anything in return
---
How many water does the top rank of conjure water (from DM) make per cast?
---
Stonetalon Mtns in the north of the zone's FP (at work, name escapes me) will help to take out the need for Auberdine on that flight too.
---
Was a shitty joke.
---
Seems legit
---
Where do you get your census data from? All of this is just not true. Maybe you experienced that in a little isolated pocket. In the grand scheme of things, Priests are not the most played class. They are somewhere in the middle.
---
I know pservers aren't 1:1 to classic but from watching the warlock who helped me get blackstone ring, it's exactly the same. Dot her up, run away, take tight corners that she has to take the long way around. Seems like minor speed to boots is more important here but yeah, still doable and you don't really need any gear.
---
I feel you my dude. Almost gave up last week. But don't give up just yet. It means that we're most likely to get more gear from dungeons/raids if we have less competition. Then we can kick their asses and avenge ourselves.
---
Well there aren't any blue posts on the issue, so its the best we have.
---
Clear cast can be a life saver on aoe pulls. Saves me a lot of times. Well worth it.
---
It's not. If hé vas 15 levels over you like 15-30 you'll be 55 and he'll be 57 at most.
---
Gear and Mobs to kill?
---
Class trinket.
---
This is not Discord - please try searching for things before mindlessly asking.
---
I know I'll get a lot of shit for this so I'll BE PREPARED
---
That looks like leveling cooking IRL!
---
It doesn't make anyone want to take them or their advice seriously when they're assholes in party chat. I've had some people decline advice in the past but I've found most people who really need the advice really want it (and have been too nervous to ask strangers for it). It's been a while since I really had to do that, though; maybe MoP or even Cata? But I distinctly remembering helping out new tanks in leveling dungeons &amp; a worgen druid healer in Cata who didn't understand which spells to use when. They were all really grateful to get the advice. :D
---
Unfortunately, servers 9/10 aren’t balanced faction wise. And there’s really no way to do this aside from either a) not letting people make a character of a certain faction in order to balance server faction pop or b) giving a large amount of rewards to the faction that has less people which would make the other not want to play on that server.
---
Farming DM North was never worth it for gold/hour, that's what DM East and West were for. I used to do DM North full solo for fun, the mobs running at different speeds happened as well, same with glitches with the ledge and ramps evading mobs. 
---
There's spots where you can still do it but you have to be really careful because it's still pretty buggy as you can see here: https://streamable.com/k8t59
---
Huh, I didn't know that function is in Classic. Guess I've got another macro to make.
---
I'd recommend an AH addon at the least.  I actually have quite a bit of addons but I stay away from 'cheating' plugins like Questie.
---
Is that mainhand or offhand?
---
Holy shit i live in Edmonton right next to strathcona... it is cold here... like ice crown citadel...
---
I know that you don't care, but I just have to let you know that I condemn your choice of the sidegame
---
lmao that's not the mafia, nobody in any mafia gives a damn about questers, they'll just kill anyone that comes around the spawns.
---
t1 pieces all look so kewl, but man their stats are so utterly shit, especially shoulders and robe :(
---
Pagle is heavily Alliance. I think it was about 70/30 A/H at the last census.
---
Using a hack = solving a problem quick and dirty, aka vpn connection to move a character to not get kicked for being inactive.
---
Not hack aka hacking software.
---
&gt;How does loot work specifically for your guild? I’ve never really partaked in a free roll system, let’s say if a deathbringer did drop I assume I would be rolling against rogues/warriors, and if I win I can’t get a main piece loot that I want for a week/few weeks or just that raid specifically? Do all melee classes that can use it usually roll or are they more conscious of what they want since they are capped on certain items per raid/week, etc?
---
Rogues can't use axes in vanilla so no competition there :P Just fury warriors.
---
We use the +1 system that was popularized on private servers. You start at 0 points, then when you get an item you get +1 so you're now at 1 point. Next time an item drops, you can't roll on it until everyone who's eligible to roll on it (MS &gt; OS) and has a smaller number than you (so 0 in this case) has passed. Everyone is reset to 0 at Ragnaros, and your loot limit is on a per raid basis since everyone will end up having everything from Ony eventually anyway.
---
Even in our guild, fury warriors would get priority over a paladin on Deathbringer since they're the only ones for whom it's MS, but most people are reasonable, if you spoke to me about it I'd ask them if they're okay with you rolling on it as it's not the end-all-be-all of for them. If they were okay with it, you'd be allowed to roll.
---
In general that's how we do everything, democratically. We vote on raid nights / hours, people are allowed to play whatever they want so long as we've got tanks and healers covered (we got shadowpriests / feral druids in the raid), and even the guild name was voted on. You'll find that when you've got chill, reasonable people in a guild, who recognize that vanilla isn't a competition, democracy can work very well. :p
---
Thanks for the tips on holy reckoning, one of my favourite videos ever (Grievous, if you remember him) played holy reckoning with Deathbringer so I may give it a go some day. But I've been AP ret since 2005, it's a very big part of why I'm even playing, so I can't see myself getting tired of big Seal of Command crits anytime soon. :D
---
I thought they was bugged before... Where did you loot yours?
---
You don't have to rely on other peoples testimony, anyone with a simple understanding of combat mechanics could see for themselves how absurdly powerful devilsaur is compared to all of the available alternatives..
---
Hell yea man! Big congrats! Was wondering the randomness of the question lol, can only imagine the hype you’re feeling 😁.
---
This is why people need to set up groups properly prior to the dungeon starting. Stating loot rules when high value items drop is essential to avoiding situations like this.
---
Also I personally wouldn't categorize this as ninjering. The term 'ninja' is becoming so diluted recently and half the time is a scapegoat for your poorly set up group.
---
&gt;just to spam feed your pet and eventually it’s loyalty level will reach 1 again.
---
To be honest this just sounds like people making shit up. Pets have a happiness cap and feeding them past that won't do anything.
---
Unfortunately I don't think anyone has found a fix yet.
---
Sorry to hear that, maces rock for leveling if you can find a pair comparable to available swords; I havent done much with tgem, but I would imagine mace mastery is quite a bit better than sword mastery while leveling.
---
and people say adding bindings about 8 months before blizzlike wouldn't impact anything LUL
---
I wonder who is behind the (((Venture Co.)))
---
Plus you can tank your way to your pre-bis gear and stack groups accordingly.
---
/unlimitedpower.gif
---
How about actively organizing with a third part app to communicate with the other faction? That line can be drawn by anyone. Blizzard is simply not holding its rules.
---
Considering you can right click enemy players and add them as battle.net friends, I doubt they're against cross faction comms as per se. The problem is when players coordinate actions cross faction to disrupt gameplay, and it's up to them to decide if that's allowed or not. All I'm saying is, they can totally enforce their decision if they decide against it.
---
No one should
---
Yea, especially after seeing the new AH updates in Retail. That part of the game can use and Add-on for sure haha
---
I really wish this were true. I've literally ran past somebody on my mount and have stolen aggro :(
---
the rules are weird, and i feel sometimes bugged
---
All the mitigation in Prot is in the first 2 tiers and corresponds to a marginal increase in gear quality.
---
Try Un'goro to eastern Feralas. Horrible!
---
Mage, no question about it. They've nerfed any efficient farming route except the ones that can be done by mages. Mages can open world AoE for leveling, for farming. They can dungeon AoE for farming. They are the only class that actually gets decent gold/hour farming DM (hunters may catch up if they get REALLY good at the new tribute, which is much harder than before).
---
Princess farms are meh, at best. The majority of the gold came from finding rogues and selling them a space in your party so that if the ring drops, they get it. Outside of that, you're looking at MAYBE 40g/hour if you also have herbalism and find ghost mushrooms.
---
I am a solo player that farms devilsaurs sometimes. I've solo'd and skinned the devilsaurs to craft my own armor, not to sell. On several occasions I've ran into these mafia groups.
---
Either they beg for leather *claiming* to only need 1 more then they can leave. (Which is a total lie because I'll see them as part of a 5+ group still farming an hour later.) Or they openly say "kill one more and we will camp your corpse for an hour."
---
I don't listen of course. Even worst than all of that is rogues who sap you the moment you loot the body, skin your devilsaurs, then leave.
---
Have you tried solo tribute runs? It has been done on pservers but I'm not sure if it would work in classic. I'm not 60 on my druid yet, but that seems like a good way to make gold.
---
Berta Boys Unite!
---
Lmao, oh well. Is he gonna start again at level1 or just move on?
---
I’ve ran Cathedral 20 times in the last 3 days and have lost the Chapeau roll 8 times, mostly to players too low to use it. Sad times
---
You went out of your way to make a snarky comment. You could’ve just said nothing. Why.
---
If you want to behave like that, go back to retail and good riddance.
---
The people you raid with make raiding fun, not the loot.
---
Then you are probably looking at Shadowpriest.
---
Mage water quest. Level 55 water!
---
As a horde player, I go out of my way to gank and camp players running towards sm. You are in my territory.

Have you told your dad yet? Or is he even playing again?
---
Download atlas loot addon
---
I went Crit = rage and also went agility &gt; strength &gt; Stam since I was having no survivability issues and wanted more threat. I did sprinkle cat stuff such as feline swiftness, but the other talents I believe had bear and cat effects in the same talent
---
Dude, install atlas loot please.
---
I've seen so many who don't even look at their own health, and it's frustrating because "YOUR REPUTATION MATTERS IN CLASSIC" comes up against 'not healing the tank when you could have' (but chose not to because you were drinking). Without streaming you don't have any proof that you're not just a terrible healer.
---
That said, I get snippy when people don't let me drink, and have definitely demanded tanks put shields on (lvl 34 *ret* paladin tanking Cathedral...ffs...put a shield on bro). Most of the time people listen...but not always. The chance of us doing well in a pull goes up a lot more if I have a full mana bar. You're right though, I gotta just start lettin' 'em die.
---
I've got satyr's lash for now from Maraudon for the OH - i know its a dagger but still... i'm level 54
---
Ya know rogues would be top dps if they weren’t busy pickpocketing everything before entering combat.
---
Class trinket is hot garbage for mages.
---
Which DM ?
---
Nobody stays prot, so I don’t get what you’re on about. I think I’ve seen one prot warrior in about 150 runs.
---
Lol shut up why did you bother replying then, just ignore it.
---
Pretty sure that was Tanaris
---
It’s how often it happens that makes the difference.
---
Greater sagefish has been a damn hard sell on my server, with pretty much only me selling. Don't really know why.
---
Don’t know don’t care. He can eat it tbh. Dude lied to all of us about it too trying to get us on his side.
---
Seems mostly healer stuff
---
Phase 3
---
#NoChanges
---
Yup, warriors are so much more fun in pve than rogues.
---
But I still picked rogue for that phase 2, I'm gonna own lots of silly warriors.
---
The SP/Heal loot is fairly good for priests. Especially when needing to farm. Gimme Gimme
---
It’s in a later phase, don’t worry it’s coming.
---
It's a tarp!
---
I use the retail version of Auctionator in Classic and it hasn't had any issues. Crazy that in 15 years the AH has never had any meaningful updates.
---
Phase 3.
---
This is why Andrew Yang said no one uses Bing last night. Ha!
---
Ah, so you weren't [implying camping = harassment?](https://imgur.com/a/FhlJFSy)? Oooooookay buddy.
---
The top Tanks from private servers you mean? Private server knowledge is redundant.
---
You're a moron if you think any of these versions is remotely difficult. Their are less mechanics in end game vanilla raiding than an average dungeon on live. Classic isn't hard - it was never hard.
---
Literally forever. I have to go back into time in perpetuity in order to find out when I saved those mats.
---
Raid leader was a priest lol
---
Lock here: I hate "of shadow wrath" items listed as BiS with no optional.  The cape has a 20% chance to drop, then has 4.3% chance to be shadow wrath. Statistically locks need an average of 80 kills (50% point). The wrists have a 12.35% chance to drop and a 3.9% chance to be shadow wrath. Or an average of 144 kills. 
---
You may be able to farm the cuffs at 5 kills an hour (if you can find a group that is), but there is no way you can farm the cape that fast.
---
Happens pretty damn often when I go to Blackrock for something.
---
Considering several of the spawns are  in the middle of quest locations, then yes yes they are the mafia. One of the devilsaurs can spawn right next to all the dino's you need for a couple quests.
---
24/0/27 certainly outperforms 0/30/21, if you're ok with not being able to farm anything solo.
---
Didn't know about that, will do. Cheers
---
Hunters sounds like a lot of micro management with ammo and pet feeding and all that jazz. I would lean towards a more caster oriented approach, e.g. 5x Mages or Shamans.
---
From what I can tell yes it can.  Some wowhead comments suggest putting it on a low level white weapon to level new characters with. You can then sell it when you are done with that weapon.
---
How are you a rogue and DON'T have your dagger or sword skill bumped up a few levels? I dont miss.
---
If people weren't 'obsessed' with making improvement we would still be living in mud huts
---
Can a mage/healer do it?
---
It might be this same song but start at 6 mins
---
Dont bother. Tried as a lvl 52.. was getting 80-120 exp a pop and pretty time consuming to navigate the pulls.
---
Damn, I've deffo missed the book. Can it only spawn in one place or is the spawn location random?
---
Funny, because even the most hardcore guild leaders recognize the need for an additional 15% bonus to a windfurry totem that bluffs your biggest damage dealers. This is a pretty widely accepted thing, And honestly not really arguable..
---
My PvP policy is
---
- /hi everyone. If they /wave back, they live. If they don't, then they die.
---
- Fuck gnomes though. I hate them, but every time I see one and he doesn't attack me, I feel like he's friendly enough to make an exception
---
Just curious. Is he a teenager or adult?
---
How do I transfer guild ownership as GM?!  I cannot for the life of my figure it out.  When I right click on someone in the guild, I don’t see an option to make them GM.  What am I missing here?
---
And get ganked again? No thank you.
---
Thanks for the input - I should clarify that i dont have difficulty in leveling, its just more boring with constant wanding. It has got a lot better now with shadowform+lvl 3 mindflay though. I have been following the exact same specs and rotation you outlined.
---
For pvp I think my biggest thing is kiting - I dont do it enough. I usually think im tankier than I am and run out of mana before I can kill them. I think ill focus on kiting+dotting and try preserve mana as much as I can.  
---
I am horde and I chose orc for rogue - I think being able to funnel gold to him has made it a bit easier, but youre right that its a lot more downtime for bandaging/eating.
---
Can you not google this? Honestly go to wowhead.com
---
Ah I see.
---
Also horde do not have the "best races" for PvP. It's subjective and combat based.
---
Perception, Escape Artist, the list goes on.
---
Orcs have a stun resist.
---
Undead have WOTF for fear.
---
It's because this isn't vanilla, it's 1.12 patch
---
well dungeons are basically spamming the same ability over and over with the occasional situational ability.  pvp is all situational
---
What a the point in this post? Why can't you just Google it or check the classic wowhead? Are you lonely or something?
---
Dreamweave gloves are better than jumanza grips from zf unless I'm a dummy
---
Does it have to be white though?
---
Could you add it to a BoE Blue on your main and mail it to your alt?
---
You can’t prove it, so probably nothing is going to happen.
---
ye dude im just messin
---
Is that a penis? No its a bicept! Hmmm it looks a lot like a penis.
---
You should rarely be using Heroic Strike while leveling as Arms. Sunder Armor is a much better option until you get Whirlwind and Mortal Strike. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d1vjxm/dear_leveling_warriors_heroic_strike_should/

Loot? what's that. Anathema is my only piece I can get without some other caster class complaining that an spriest got loot over them.
---
&gt; a druid tank is way superior (Vaelestrasz initial tank, for example)

Explain this please

Ele / resto hybrid is best. You have crazy burst and don't have to worry about being kited around. Enh can be fun but good players can outplay you without too much trouble.
---
Don't worry bud, gold is a lot easier 35-40. If you're only at 4 gold, you're probably not getting a mount right at 40 though.
---
As for fishing...I don't find the fish themselves to be worthwhile. It's the mithril trunks that made me money
---
I do. I also play rogue, so dropping threat is insanely easy if I manage to pull it, which I normally don't since I'm sword main and use garrote, not ambush from stealth. I also almost always pickpocket the whole group before engaging to give time to build threat (and make a bit of extra gold).
---
The path of the epicure is beset on all sides...
---
No the top Tanks that have been around since Vanilla  and know all the differences between Private Servers and Live.
---
I've had multiple 5 orb runs.
---
I’m playing as a warrior with a group of friends and I’m looking to start a solo alt. I was thinking rogue or hunter because they are able to farm gold easily but I also want to be needed in groups. Would a Druid be able to farm gold easily too? I heard druids can tank/heal/dps with one spec is that true? Are rogues needed at end game content and if so will they play too similar to a warrior?
---
Highly doubt it. Aggro ranges (both regular and mind soothe) are *WAY* higher on live than any private servers, I would imagine stealth detection range would be proportionally higher as well.
---
Upset, certainly. You are, very clearly, an idiot. Your rationales are again contradictory yet you refuse to acknowledge it.
---
The only reason you can think of is they post for bad publicity? Not a single one just wants their wrongfully banned account looked at? Like I said. Idiot.
---
You're claiming a situation where it is outright impossible for you to know the variables of either side is 100% black and white,it is either one way or the other but since you lack access to a) the history of the banned and b) the developers routine and process you STILL want to claim its either this or thay and you're taking an ACTIVE STANCE in the matter without any access. Idiot.
---
If you want to continue living a life of idiocy I'm not stopping you, but come on this is getting comical.
---
yea if you like playing hunter
---
Especially when the reward sucks lol
---
Seriously, people are all about making sure this is nerfed, but no one cared Hunters and Warlocks are able to tap into the bank of Mauradon whenever they want and come out rich.
---
&gt; ruining personal and guild rep
---
lmao
---
people need to stop this, its so wrong :D 
---
nobody cared back vanilla if you ninjad 100items and nobody will care today.
---

Do not send free mats to the guild bank unless you have been in the guild for a few months at the very least. You need to build trust before doing stuff like that.
---
No shield block, no defence, no shieldwall no last stand.  Cant dualwiekd for insane threat. Lesser class .
---
Is Battle.net down? Can't log on.
---
and all I said was that I could hear virginity in his voice, I didn't call him a virgin.  Looks like neither of us were implying anything at all with our statements
---
What will be included in the Hallow's End event?
---
I don't understand the problem.  Taunt the mob after the Pyroblast hits - now you've got a jumpstart on threat.  
---
INB4 wHaT iF tAuNt ReSiStS1?!
---
More hit raises your crit cap. It's beneficial to get more hit when over half your damage is white damage.
---
Thanks man, I will go for Nighstalker. I have some friends that should be able to farm that with me.
---
REPORTING IN
---
Fwiw im combat daggers and im usually top 5 dps on raid bosses. Its MC, play what you want and have fun with it
---
Friendly to the medics, I like you
---
the reason you don't see combat / sub specs because there aren't really any sub talents worth taking after Master of deception / Elusiveness. 
---
swords pvp will never burst like the one shot combo of a cold blood improved ambush crit. but you can do sustained damage if you stick to your target. improved sprint + free action potion. most of your damage is from auto attacks.
---
being good at pvp is also about using wound / mind numbing / crippling poison.
---
Looking at it in terms of total xp to 60 doesn't give an accurate idea of what's going on. Going from 38 to 39 requires 7% more xp than going from 37 to 38, but he's only getting 4% more xp from killing mobs when you're together. This means you're closing in on 38 faster than he's closing in on 39, and it also means that as long as you're always playing together this is the biggest that the gap between you will ever be. You won't ever close the gap completely because once you're at the same level you'll be gaining xp at the same rate but he's never going to get further ahead than he is now unless he plays without you.
---
Can't she hit you across that rock? I only use it to LOS the boulder throw if I happen to be near, then peek-a-boo around the big pillar until dot falls off and then go for a big loop. I'm a priest tho, just wondering how is it so different for druids.
---
Literally exactly what the first guy to hit 40 in my guild did lol. One of us said at level ten "it's like 40g right?" and everyone else went "yeah that sounds about right" and none of us thought to confirm that until he was standing in front of the trainer, 30g short.
---
I wound up loaning him 15g a week ago so he could get it and he managed to make the money back and send it to me exactly one day before I reach 40 myself.
---
Facts right here. I'm clc. We're primarily a pvp focused guild and crater is the main outlet for that right now. People just see crater as a way to get gold through pvp rather than other gold farming options.
---
The counter to mafia has always been an opposing mafia and frankly most would probably welcome the competition cause it gets everyone their pvp fix.
---
If people don't like clc controlling crater, organize and push us out. Don't pvp through reports and reddit threads, play the game.
---
Good druid tanks swap useful trinkets on CD. The Arena Master is fucking amazing, and you only sacrifice 1% dodge for an encounter to get a 1k hp shield. There are a couple others I use outside of raid to tank too.
---
\&gt; [Says camping is harassment](https://imgur.com/a/UkQ5vuH) when blizzard has literally said the [exact opposite](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/10184)
---
\&gt; In the same post, [implies people should get banned](https://imgur.com/a/U1rUJ1I) for "targeted harassment"
---
I know connecting more than one piece of information is probably hard for you, but to a normal person its pretty clear that you think that corpse camping is harassment and people in un'goro camping should get banned for it.
---
Hunters will be poor in BWL, they'll absolutely suck in AQ40. In Naxxramas they pick up again - Naxx tier is actually designed properly for hunter.
---
Why on earth do you care how much damage you do raid wise? The boss dies for all 40 players or for none.
---
PvP hunter burst is pretty damn great anyways.
---
If you're gonna play a huge mmo with only numbers in mind you will be very disappointed very fast.
---
&lt;GRIZZLY&gt; on Stalagg is the same. 
---
Have had a kid legit tell my friend he’s in a KoS list
---
Ok awesome I will give it a go! Sounds good to me!
---
We cleared every single raid 14 years ago with zero consumables or any idea what the hell we were doing. I highly doubt it'll be harder this time
---
hahah oh my god
---
nobody cares about "server rep" its as useless today as it was 16 years ago.
---
people have so short memory you can ninja shit and then group with the same people next day, they wont even notice.
---
I've played just enough to not get rank decay and that's it. I'm sure I'll try league again eventually, but Classic has gotten me interested in the MMO market again, so probably gonna play both Retail and FFXIV when I finally get tired of Classic.
---
For world pvp with some (but not a lot) bgs, what’s more fun - warlock or shadow priest? They both appear to be elite so I’m just looking entirely for opinions on fun factor. I don’t have time to level both to 60. I’ve tried watching pvp videos of both and could see myself playing either. Horde if it matters. 
---
I’ll use friends to help gear me, but I’ll never be full raid bis. Might be able to push rank 10.
---
You're a nerd
---
Dude all I did was give a warrior 7 of the charms from the fire eles so he would fuck off my elemental fire farming spot and the dude was like "tysm! Now I can get my ww axe!" 
---
He even tipped me with the ele fire he had! 
---
I was like , well, that worked out :D
---
Depends on your healer if they are more than 1-2 levels lower than you you will probably need to use shield. Just be kind to the healers, let them get mana
---
Hunters do mediocre pve damage after MC, but are still good in pvp and are good for farming. If you care about seeing your name at the top of meters, reroll.
---
Yes but they banned my account on no grounds, my 15 year wow account, not just the classic account, they didnt even give an apology when they unbanned me.
---
But i made a reddit post and no one believed me either, so i get the frustration from people that get banned, some are innocent (maybe not that many though.)
---
Except me. You can trust me.
---
Of course I can google but obviously I didn’t care enough to do it. It seems like you do though so why don’t you google it for me.
---
I think you're "googling" wrong.
---
I am fine with the responsibility. 
---
When I get a good group I fucking love tanking, they listen, they are fine with the pace, they are grateful to have someone call the shots, and thank me for the awesome run at the end. 
---
I get tired of the bitching, whining, moaning, dealing with peoples emotions constantly, people complaining, the sense of entitlement.  It’s just exhausting and can ruin an entire evening. 
---
Plus, as a Druid, I have farmed 3 sets of bear BIS for tanking, boomkin, and healer. I don’t need anything else for minor upgrades at this point, even dire maul I got all but 1-2 “meh” upgrades across all three sets. 
---
Unless something Is reserved, why would I want to take the risk of a shitty group when I can just grind the same amount of gold with less stress.
---
Need? No. But you likely won't replace the set for a long time as a warrior, at least until AQ/phase 5. Depends on where you're getting hit elsewhere. But more hit raises your crit cap, since it converts a miss into a chance to crit.
---
I don't think I'd be too upset with a day off to play wow, DM or not
---
man after enough AOE runs you just delete that shit :\\
---
Personally, for playing a mana using class, I found FiveSecondRule a necessary addon. This thing helps me so much with controlling mana.
---
but "DM gonna ruin the economy" :D:D
---
remember that most redditors have no clue how things work.
---
On pull Vael gives a buff that essentially gives infinite rage, energy and mana to everyone in the raid. The encounter also starts at 30% so immediate execute range. It is therefore important to maximize threat so the DPS can maximize their damage output but they must not pull aggro because that would cause Vael to turn and with a high probability immediately wipe the raid.
---
Druids have a higher single target threat multiplier than warriors and do deal higher damage while tanking. Getting an initial very high threat ceiling at Vael is therefore extremely good and that makes the druid initial tank superior to all other options.
---
Starting area of brd its very easy to tank with 2hander, but there are some packs (near BaelGar) that hit crazy hard for some reason.. wouldnt recommend it there unless you got sheeps or something.
---
It's not trash, it just has more problems than the other servers...as everyone expected.
---
I think the real issue is unrealistic expectations for this server, it's always going to have more problems than other servers and some problems take a long time to fix.
---
Yep that’s exactly what I want I love the improved sprint and sword damage and if I’m in trouble ever pop prep and have a fresh start on cooldowns but also be able to vanish and be stealthy!
---
Saying "u can literally hear the virginity in that guy's voice" is equally as pathetic as calling someone a virgin.
---
Earth Mother*
---
Run around Brill or get killed outside Under City lol. Not even trying to be cruel, but I’m going to kill any Alliance I see in front of our city. It’s especially hilarious when someone tries to run by while the zeppelin is arriving and have two groups of horde running right through them, like what in the world do you expect to happen.
---
Hello! I don't know much about how weapons skills work. Would edgemaster's handguards be good for a 49 warrior twink in BGs? This guide I'm following lists https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9640/vice-grips of the Bear as the best gloves. Not sure if EH are useful in pvp or not. Thanks!
---
How do you know?
---
ShaquilleOFordring
---
I didn't play pservers but had no problem stealthing up Jintha'Alor at lvl 45, the mobs there are up to lvl 51 and didn't get aggro even once even though it's very stacked. I'm more worried about managing to kill the boss
---
Honestly end game dungeons arent optimized enough for this stuff to matter. The limiting factor 90% of the time is just finding a healer or tank, and the content isnt difficult enough that youre gonna get excluded just cause youre a shitty spec. Practically every UBRS run ive done has had a couple level 58-59s and its generally been fine. If youre geting excluded from a dungeon run its probably because someone doesnt want to compete with you for gear rolls
---
The only time it really matters is for 40-man raids, but you can always respec so I dont see why that would deter you cdom playing shadow. For every single class the optimal PvE , wPvP and group PvP specs are different
---
What? The Lashers drop tons of loot. Where are you getting this info?
---
Hell, it even helps you sell AH auctions now?
---
You have to actually click the bauble with the mouse right?  So what would you bind other than the 'cast' button?
---
It sounds like you just want to complain, honestly. I see lots of Alliance everywhere. Last night at Dire Maul I saw *way* more Alliance than Horde, for example.
---
PAPA!!!!
---
Both warriors and rogues scale extremely well with gear. We're the two classes most dependent on it. However, fury warriors have talents that allow them to scale more exponentially. Until gear availability allows for seal fate builds to be competitive rogues scale more linearly as our talents are basically just "do more damage." So at an equal gear level, a warrior should pull ahead of a rogue.
---
That said, the fury warrior meta seems to have brought about *a lot* of completely clueless warriors who think they'll do big dick dps no matter what, or suck at their rotation and think funneling gear to them will fix it. My raid brings 8 fury warriors and only 2 of them are consistently breaking 300dps on fights, which is pretty bad.
---
Could report them for slander.
---
It being difficult had nothing to do with it but the road to get there was so god damn long.
---
It´s possible. Make an appointment with other guild leaders (not guilds). For the Raid every raidleader has it´s own voice chat for his/hers raid and is in an raidleaders VC for coordination aswell. It´s not that hard, just plan and organize smart!
---
Mmmmm.... these old cigarettes
---
Ok thank u for the advice !
---
Interesting. My wife may like that Add-on, thanks. I'll look it up and let her know.
---
I'll answer #1, as most people will tell you Dwarf Priest and Gnome Mages are the best race/class combos.
---
[Here you go](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/wow-classic-cooking-guide-1-300/)
---
I've never thought to do that but that's hilarious
---
The dude I originally replied to has deleted his comment but what he said was that fire resistance is useless on tanks, which I replied to that it's absolutely not. As I said it's not needed, but you can ignore the whole knock back mechanic which will make it alot smoother, especially for guilds that aren't that good already
---
Druid or Priest
---
I convinced my girlfriend to play with me. I am retooling to level with her. I’m between picking a Druid or priest. Both seem like a lot of fun. 
---
1) how is Druid tanking and healing end game?
---
2) how is priest leveling and 
---
3)anything I should know?
---
Best bet is just something that drops naturally from the dungeon instead of a fixed amount of gold. For example first righteous orb, maybe 3-4 corruptor stones, dark runes, etc. Basically as long as it’s not some BOP that people actually want for their gear to use it’s open game.
---
That's why I laugh at YouTube guides which suggest rotation for every level range. Rotation is only important at end game raids where every dps counts.
---
In 5 man dungeons, it is more important to know how to keep CC on your target with your abilities, know your positioning so as not to body pull extra mobs, etc. Once you know your class well, you should have a rough idea what skills to use in dungeons. For example, you don't need a 5 pt slice n dice when clearing thrash. 5 man dungeons have at most 3 dps, put all your warlock dots on bosses and don't worry about debuff slot, that is for raiding.
---
While leveling and being handled, are you goin to stick to a rotation? You don't, you react with what your class can do and all these fall into place once you understand your class more.
---
Really I was just looking for recipes for all the meat you get from the jungle mastery quests
---
[Sounds more like you need a set of matryoshka dolls than a drawing](https://imgur.com/N3leSNq)
---
Sorry to tell you then. They are not top tanks if they think dagger tanking is good.
---
that's not really a solution to people that are breaking the TOS to get an advantage though
---
A lot of it is pretty obvious in game. It only happens are very specific parts of the map and its the same players over and over.
---
They just don't want to.
---
The improved threat is only in Defensive stance, so unless you put your defensive stance, improved threat will not be applied, so you shouldn't have to worry about that, though this spec does lower your DPS a bit, compared to deep fury+Impale but you can can still pull off serious DPS without a problem, you need to mainly focus on Hit Crit and Weapons / attack power for DPS.
---
Though again, this build is more Gear reliant than DeepProt for tanking. And the less gear you have the more you'll play with a Shield. Also, if you don't have at least 14% crit in defensive stance, you're going to have a hard time having uptime on your Fury 30% Attack-speed Bonus.
---
Their other favourite is ‘Hi I’m calling about that gryphon accident you had that wasn’t your fault’
---
There's nothing to be jealous about. If they were just a group of friends having some fun there'd be no issue, but there's regular threads here to suck APES' dick and trying to glorify their no-lifeing, PvP collusion or camping Un'goro leather with their entire guild.
---
That’s our plan for this week. Thanks for the suggestions.
---
Our issue was we have 3 enh shamans and only one is well geared
---
Deadly will make it so you can’t gouge or blind, and it will sometimes proc if you sap and break it immediately.  If it’s a lot of short fights just do instant.  If it’s elites In a group where you aren’t needing to cc at all you can do deadly.
---
they sell for more than that sometimes on Mograine-Horde.
---
Nothing official. They did say in the AMA before the launch that (paraphrasing)  by creating classic, they've done all the hard work and doing a TBC/Wrath version of classic would be far easier now having done Classic. So take that for what it's worth. 
---
I'd bet money we'll see Classic TBC servers at the very least in a few years. Wouldn't surprise me to hear some news on that at Blizzcon considering they announced classic 2 years before it launched. It's probably the highest money:work ratio option for them.
---
Is there another way to do it?
---
Daddy Azeroth
---
No I mean while playing separately playing the same ammount of time with the same effectiveness it evens out. 
---
I had a friend who was 3 level behind me from level 45 and when I got to 60 he dinged 60 like 1 hour later at most. We were doing all the content together from 45.

Now that it turns out lashers are immune to nature and farming DM as a shaman is a total bust, what are some good options for generating gold as an elemental shaman?
---
I mean everyone can profit off of someone’s BIS item by vendoring it so why don’t we all become narcissists and need everything.  That would make for a great gaming community. /s

Hi, /u/benzone34

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/diqdk0/ruthless_wow_vanilla_guild_situated_on_stonespine/).
---
Yeah true. I always prioritize PVM in my mind
---
I mean useless is strong but I'd definitely say pointless. He dies before the first submerge 100% of our runs and we're pretty far from leet
---
Can you be more specific as well?
---
I suspect that they are, but the only reason I've retained my Jamanza (51 now) is because I have so much other spell damage/+shadow damage that I noticed my other stats were getting neglected. The spell damage gear sure is fun when I do a run with another lock and destroy them on the damage meter. Get lots of "are you specced demo or something?"
---
Skinning isnt generating much gold (unless you're skinning the 55 elite devilsaurs). Just buy your mount at 43 like the rest of us
---
Aggro range is not a function of mob level, they can put arbitrary ranges on any mob in the game. I can assure you that many mobs in DM north have absolutely insane ranges, especially compared to pserver videos where people just walk past ogres that would notice you from a mile away on live.
---
You need to brush up on your math, there's complexities here you're missing.
---
Because of ganking or because you played alone? I had a hard time in taren mill running into loads of alliance
---
Any specific brand recommendations?
---
You can leave Welland but the Welland never leaves you.
---
No what *you're* saying doesn't give an accurate idea of what's going on. Read my edit on the post.
---
Had a warrior cleaving/whirlwinding immediately on the packs in strath, yelled at the 58 healer for not keeping him alive and then rage quit the group when I told him to stop aoe damage immediately . I switched to boomkin immediately after that. Switched back to help with Dire Maul groups but honestly there is no soul in it anymore after having so much fun on boomkin.
---
I don’t really reserve anything but I truly don’t understand why if someone’s advertising reserves and you don’t want to run with those items reserved people can’t just mind their own business. I hear stuff like this all the time.
---
I got as far as 55 skill just through DEing (never even crafted the rod). Not sure if there's a cap, I stopped DEing when the economy turned and it stopped being profitable.
---
I'm clc. We're a pvp guild with our core being p server rankers from LH/ND. 
---
Crater control is mostly just an outlet for competitive pvp while no other content available. Our guys like being able to pvp their way to gold rather than boring pve farms.
---
The counter to mafia has always been opposing mafia or guilds that organize for the express purpose of breaking mafia control. Most of us would honestly enjoy the competition anyway, pvp is why we're playing this game.
---
If you don't like what clc is doing in crater, organize and push us out. Don't pvp through reports and reddit threads. Play the game, win the fights.
---
P.S. DOGZ are dogshit and have nothing to do with us.
---
People use mumble?
---
What add on do you have for your graphics , looks smooth and also the damage fonts. And health plates ???
---
Nice, ty.
---
Use bings video search for porn sometime, its incredible
---
People don't do that on Ashbringer for example. It's a well populated server and none of the weird shit I see being reported in reddit threads is happening there.
---
So what raid took you 30 minutes?
---
Better leave now while traffics light
---
No it's not going to get banned because that's not possible to "Ban" and addon. I was simply stating that I hate the logic that I see time and time again on reddit when someone posts about something and other just say "Great now everyone knows about it".   
---
DING DONG Sherlock Holmes! That's the point. When it's not just a small group of people using it then two things happen:  
---
A. People can stop bitching about someone having an advantage, because they now know how to do it too.  
---
B. We can a better discussion about the subject since everyone understands how the addon works and have been able to actually use it themselves.
---
Since number 1 is answered well, I think [this site](https://classicwow.live) can help you with finding the best leveling zones for your class. I used that guide as a general guideline for what areas to go to next but following it step by step may feel like your hand is being held too much through the leveling. At least that’s how I felt about it, depends on how much you want to balance exploring and absolute efficiency.
---
posting peoples names and what they say and screenshotting and capturing everything is funny, i sure hope that one day I say something outrageous so that everyone can capture it XD
---
People who get so worked up over a 15 year old game have little going for them in their lives.
---
Shaman is awesome bud. I had a very enjoyable time because of his utility and all-around game, a Jack of all trades. I loved that I could be off-healing/spell dps/melee dps/applying shocks and totems in one fight. On top of that, I could Ankh and Rez too. Getting Ghost Wolf at 20 was very underrated. All of that Shaman versatility made leveling fun. Battlegrounds in the future also seem interesting because of my DPS/Armour/Ghost Wolf(capture the flag) potential. Never raid healed before, only in instances, but I'm sure it won't too bad.
---
I've played War/Priest/Mage/Rogue before, only up to WOTLK. This Shammy was my first and I only played him for 2 weeks, up to 31, but he is by far my favourite character. I know there's so much more to unlock and still to come for him.
---
My bro was a Tauren Druid. Unfortunately he was much higher level than me when I started but I felt we had great chemistry when we did quest a little bit. We could both heal each other and travel quickly from place to place. To me, Druids and Shamans are kindred spirits.
---
Yeah, its what ive seen most prebis tanks are around. 4.1-4.3k
---
What is Blizzard stance on character morphs. It seems like there's never been a ban for them, is it an don't ask don't Tell situation?
---
Probably want a shield unless group is geared to hell.
---
Farm larvic acid in eastern plaguelands, they go for 7g a pop on my server
---
hahaha so glad I clicked on this. Although I'm a west coast Canadian I have family in Welland! Too funny
---
This is another level. Good one!!
---
I mean... killing things faster also reduces the amount of damage you take.
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
I play there - always people around doing quests, never really seen any quiet zones!
---
Why should we “grow a thick skin” to enable people we don’t even care about to do content we don’t want to do, or need to do? 
---
Why are they entitled to our time when they give us nothing but shit in return?
---
Just leave it, if you genuinely are not a ninja you won't retain this reputation. Report it to blizzard if you feel its harassment, which it could potentially be.
---
They will merge servers or just allow new transfers.
---
Timing isn't an issue. It's instant. Shifting out of a form doesn't trigger GCD, neither does drinking a pot.  
---
Shift out, drink, shift in. One click macro.
---
If for some reason you base your enjoyment of the class on where you are on a DPS meter, than reroll. But they’ll still be used/needed in raids, solo farm well and do fine in PVP.
---
I want to level a warrior but the idea of having to lead a group and micro manage everyone is really turning me off.   AND the fact that were a dime a dozen.  Its kinda sad that warriors are the most abundant class yet finding a tank is near impossible.  We need more druids.
---
Most of my friends quit. Honestly, the launch was a fucking mess. We all ended up on different servers  due to queues, new servers opening and that drove most of my friends away. They should have open up proper server transfers immediately. At this point, even if transfers open up tomorrow those friends won't come back. They're more likely to stay on their private server together.
---
Literally just added your messages as quotes. Again, just moving goal posts...
---
good to know :) thx
---
You need a way to open the inner door. A rogue, a blacksmith or an engineer.
---
Shaman totems are amazing. You can also do some good damage. Shaman also get Windfury Totem at level 32. That totem is a MASSIVE damage increase for Rogues and Warriors.
---
Only when rage stacks up to like 70-80. It’s an expensive rage dump.

It's literally r/ChoosingBeggars all over. Pretty funny if you ask me.
---
Because in 15 years it has been proven that you cannot enforce the idealogy that is need before greed. Ninja's like this will always exist and they are hardly the exception. Even in the real world we let assholes overrule basic decency because the decent people end up getting shafted otherwise. If you think this topic hasn't been discussed far and wide ever since wow launched in 2004 you are mistaken and to this day only personal loot (which we all hate) has stopped ninja looting. But we don't want PL.
---
I realised a good part of the reason why hunters fall off so fast and even harder is because the following AP buffs don't apply to hunters:
---
DM 200 AP
---
Firewater 35AP
---
Juju Might 40 AP
---
Onyxia 140AP
---
Lack of Crusader and offensive items like sharpstones (mana oil and +15 agi next closest) 
---
On top of that the scaling on Agi versus the stacking of Agi/Str is pretty bad.
---
Finally pets not scaling and needing to be kept up dolcks this further. 
---
Then you put all this on a full rotation weapon timer and you have a percentage efficiency. 
---
I mean, that may have pushed hunters over the top in P1 but it amplifies the gulf in later tiers. No chance it gets changed though, they may hit you in the DM but they won't toy with class buffs, only bugs :D
---
Yeah, and the diner down the street from me has the "Worlds Best Coffee".
---
They're looking from a third-party opinion, not something that the sites owners coulda posted themselves. It's a lot less likely the guide's writers would fake a comment on here than on their own page.
---
Traitor.

Unless people are actively talking about streamers idk how anyone would know otherwise. Haven't been on that server so no idea.

There is maintenance from 7AM- 8AM pacific this morning.
---
ahh ok cheers for the advice. Yea although im new to wow ive tried to make sure I do a lot of research and make sure I know what im doing etc. I understand that warrior CAN be top dps but they rely more than any other class on gear and only when they have that gear can they perform that their best. Also things like stance dancing etc, even though it may be a learning process im going to make sure that I take my time and know what I'm meant to be doing and how to do it so that my (when I get to that point) raid group doesn't suffer because of me.
---
Well what do you like pvping for? The thrill of the battle or getting +10 internet points?
---
Does no one else use a vacation day every now and then to relax and destress? This sub is fuckin weird sometimes.

I'm sure, bud.
---
She cant melee through the rock, it blocks boulder Throw and if she goes for an AoE attack you just back of during the cast then run back in.  
---
If you do take damage you can heal up as she can't melee to finish you of as long as you keep mobile.
---
You can go back to Eastern kingdoms, finsish a bit of the silveprine forest, and go ahead to Hillsbrad, if you are tired of kalimdor :)
---
Your guild is shit, leave it.
---
I would also love to see this spreadsheet
---
I don't see why that's a good thing...
---
But the drops are nerfed so it isnt worth it anymore. Back to mara

It is.

and on release you could run it on a 3dfx card feature wise when the company had been out of business a while.
---
Everyone in vanilla bought gold although nobody admits it.
---
As a healer, how do I determine the best gear stats? The trade off seems to be int/spirit vs healing/damage done. In other words, how do I determine if I should give up 3 int for 4 healing? Hope that makes sense.
---
Instant Poison on MH + OH unless you have a Shaman in your group (due to Windfury). Crippling Poison OH if you have humanoids that run away at low hp (e.g: in BRD)
---
Can’t say it wasn’t rare in vanilla. On our server it was like 1k gold minimum, me and my guildmates farmed it nearly every night a couple of runs and never got it
---
Warriors are, in fact, a pain to get to 60, but they are one of the most powerful classes endgame, so it's worth it.
---
Honestly, I'd suggest finding a priest/shaman/druid to group with, it's really the best way to level as a warrior.
---
I have a good guild at least that will feed me some gear considering I have full prebis holy set, and 90% prebis shadow. Mages and locks will complain about me getting some pieces but they dont necessarily see it the same way I do. IE my reed, they replace it relatively soon, where I'd hold on to it for a few months longer.
---
You're like the guy from South Park lol

There's a guy in the Port Authority who sells recipes.

People use mumble or TS...?

Yep that kind of crap is an insta /gquit for me

Imagine. My. Shock.
---
a somewhat-related question, as a 53 druid tank, what level should i be before looking for BRD runs? can i do the first half yet?
---
As DPS you can do a full run at 55.
---
As I mentioned I just tunneled him from start to finish without ever using a yard with a shaman buddy.
---
Drop WF, next GCD drop grounding immediately. After its eaten, wf again, once grounding is off CD, he puts it down again. You maybe lose 5-10 seconds of WF over course of the fight, but you also dont have to care at all abouve movement or anything.
---
I love coming to this sub and seeing these tiny sketches you do about your journey in wow. Idk why but it always just makes me so happy every single time. Thanks for that :)
---
Yes it does.
---
I won the tournament 24 times on a level 1 character (the trinket isn't unique-equipped, even if the effect is) some years back. If you work night shift (or is unemployed / student / etc I guess) it's super easy to just drop by 3 and 6 am on a workday. I think I checked the arena 50 times before I got it, which is barely anything all things considered.
---
No, you're still not understanding how this works.
---
37 to 38 requires 76,100 xp to level. At 128 xp per kill that'll be 595 kills.
---
38 to 39 requires 80,800 xp to level. At 133 xp per kill that'll be 608 kills.
---
Let's say you're at 0/76,100 for your level and he's 0/80,800 for his level, killing same mobs together the entire time for those xp values per kill. After 595 kills you'll be a fresh 38, for simplicity's sake we'll say 0/80,800 xp towards 39. At that point, your friend will be at 79,135 xp towards his next level.
---
After another 13 kills, he'll reach 39 and be at 0/85,700 towards 40. You'll be gaining the same amount of xp per kill during this period so you'll now be 1,729/80,800. At this point, let's say the xp values go back to what they were with you getting 128 and him getting 133.
---
At this point, you'll need 618 kills to get to level 39 at 128 xp per kill. Your friend will need 644 kills to reach level 40. You sit there and kill 618 of these mobs to get to level 39 and are now 0/85,700 towards 40.
---
Your friend will now be at 82,194/85,700. He'll need another 27 kills to get to 40, at which point he'll be 0/90,700 while you'll now be 3,591/85,700 since you'll again be gaining the same amount of xp during this time.
---
At this point you'll need 82,109 xp to get to 40 and your friend needs 90,700 to get to 41. At 128 xp per kill, you'll need 642 kills to level and at 133 xp per kill your friend needs 682. You sit there and kill 642 mobs and you're now 0/90,700 to 41. Your friend is now at 85,386 towards 41.
---
Let's do a quick check on how much progress your friend is making for every full level you're gaining at these xp rates. By the time you've gone from 37 to 38, he was 98% of the way from 38 to 39. Then in the time it took for you to go from 38 to 39, he ended up at 96% of the way 40. In the time it took you to get to 40, he ended up at 94% of the way to 41. Notice how he's further away from his next level every time you catch up to his level? That trend will keep up all the way to 60. Do you understand the math or do you need me to do this all the way out to level 60 for you?
---
Exactly. I don’t understand where the “wanting to sell it means you need it” came from - thought that was considered ninjaing but now everyone who plays the game has essentially made ninjaing OK by having everyone “need” on an item that only one person actually needs and would use. 
---
Hell, even when I’m healing and an obvious healing upgrade for me drops, I’ll still ask if it’s OK if I need before needing. I don’t run pugs anymore because of people like in OPs screenshot.
---
The only real point of leatherworking late game is to make devilsaur armor in all honesty.
---
If you have a friend who is tribal then go dragonscale, that's what I did. If I manage to get devilsaur leathers somehow I'll get him to craft for cheap.
---
To be fair, most of the objections to releasing DM too early centered around its impact on the economy.
---
Since it was released in this 1.12 state, the disruptions will be minimal. 
---
Which means it’s negative impact will be almost entirely mitigated.
---
Based on the number of people that were upset about DM’s early release, I’m “shocked” this hasn’t been met with an overwhelming positive response here.
---
Same
---
That's what you get for using Bing
---
If you play multiple hours in dungeons with the same people, and they know what they're doing, it's really good.
---
If you're trying to AOE farm outside of dungeons, it's horrible. Too much competition.
---
I honestly don't understand people being terrible at their rotation on classic.... The warrior one is one of the most involved but I was doing 200-300+ in shitty gear with no buffs while grinding in the late 50s. If they have decent gear they should be doing over 300 dps just by hitting bloodthirst and WW on cooldown.
---
1 is my thrown weapon, so as a rogue I really don't use it often unless I'm pulling a solo mob away from a pack.
---
I can understand that you find it hard to make gold when you can't even do something as simple as read. 
---
I never said you can make 30g pr hour "just playing the game". Another poster commented that you can make a little bit of gold (net positive income) by "just playing the game", however my post specifically referred to knowing how and where to actively farm for gold. 
---
I said "easily" farm 30g/h as with the recent prices on my server, I've been almost doubling that. I never said that *I* specifically was hitting 30g/h. I spend most of my time ingame PvPing, only allotting 1-2 hours pr day grinding.
---
Mages can push 40g/h grinding ZF zombies. Locks/hunters can do the same with Maraudon boss runs. Priests can push 30g/h holy novaing lashers in DM:E, more with herbalism. Warriors+druids (or other healers) can pair up and do DM:E jump runs for bosses and hit something like 100g/h (50g each) with herbalism/mining/enchanting. 
---
Rogues can buy Relic Coffer Keys on AH/from players and do BRD pickpocket runs + looting the vaults. 
---
Un'goro devilsaur skinning is insanely lucrative if you go in off-hours or don't encounter too much competition, and still competitively lucrative with the above methods with competition. 
---
Druids+rogues can 2-man Tribute runs for up to 120g/h. 
---
Arcane Crystals are hitting 45g a pop on my server atm with thorium stacks bringing in another 8-9g.
---
There's so many ways of hitting 40g/h+ with little effort, just taking advantage of professions and class.. so fuck off with your shit ass comment.
---
&gt;For leveling, you should be pulling by pre-shielding yourself, then cast Mind Blast, immediate Shadow Word: Pain, and then 0-2 mind flays
---
I'm lvl 39 and this is what's starting to make leveling Priest a drag for me. The same 4 spells then wanding down, over and over.
---
Alright thanks for all the love. Sounds like as I'm leveling I need to get a sword and board unless i'm tanking for a group of 60s with a solid healer.
---
Can't ever reach that point, armor caps in vanilla and it's not hard to reach it either in a raid. That's why it's kinda downhill for druids later as they never get much 'better' and some mobs just fuck them no matter what they do(like nef).
---
Except they don't post in lfg, they spam trade chat.
---
Wouldn't it be great if they merged us back together with Heartseeker?
---
I wouldnt even spit in the direction of such nerd losers.
---
Ahhhh I'm ally so no grounding. Good to know though, appreciate the response.
---
He broke the terms of service of the game, contributing towards the sustainment of toxic and harmful services such as gold selling, and then lied about it.
---
Don’t be mad cause someone burst your bubble.
---
I like having a feral in my raid.
---
Thanks, but I'm on the German server Lakeshire =)
---
Cuz the poor dude is just sharing his joy of getting a lovely horse and your ganggang is roasting him for doing the thing we encourage the most here 
---
“Enjoy classic, let people try ret pally, feral druid, lets bring in a new non elitist meta” but when this guy is holding his nice 2h ppl rage
---
I think, in practical terms, since you don't like percents and what not, the best way to explain it is - he's getting a little more xp, but it's Impact and Value to him per level is less and less. you get a little less, but need less to reach the next level - he gets a little more, but needs More to get to the next level. so - its like the  accordion principal. by the time you go up a few more levels, you will catch up (not fully, but close) as the higher levels require a larger milestone to reach. 
---
its not just raw numbers - its what the value is in relationship towards the level goal. 
---
right now, the gap is noticeable, but in 10 levels, it wont be. I am leveling with my GF, and she did some Pally side quests that put her about 7 bubbles ahead of me when we were level 20. at 35, she is only 5 bubbles ahead of me. and we only play those toons together. by 50, we will be around 3 bubbles apart.
---
Will have to try this out. We just used grounding, because it has a 100% chance of grounding it.
---
You can do angerforge/arena runs. I’m a Druid tank and we downed emp when I was 55
---
And lacks voice features that TS/Mumble offer. People have very easily managed for the last 15/20 years to install voice and chat clients and input server details.
---
If installing and running a piece of software is too high of a barrier to entry for people then I think that says a lot.
---
Yeah I feel you, well-made guide but made the grind feel way more grindy for me if you know what I mean.
---
It’s like 15%, so the numbers add up, when you get to 8 then say wtf
---
The disguise is for the captain, which is the last boss you need to skip who is standing in a doorway. You either all need the disguise or distract him with a rogue or hunter
---
I'm SM/Ruin. I can solo Tinkerer no problem as long as I let VW tank at the beginning. I just saw a video of someone kiting rotgrip which may make it possible for me, but I cant just defeat him in the water like I have seen in some videos. Princess just wrecks me. 
---
I pull her to the edge with vw aggro, I then throw all my dots on her and tell VW to follow and we start kiting around the island. She only does the stomp in place thing if the voidwalker is attacking her, so once I pull aggro I put him on princess. When she does do the stomp I pull VW to me, but he loses a lot of health. I then get to max range and refresh the dots/try to heal VW before she starts chasing us again. Rinse and repeat but eventually she kills VW and at that point she slowly gains on me since she no longer stomps.
---
Seems to me like he just explained the logic to somebody who might not be great with math
---
Yes and no.
---
After tbc came out, they went back and nerfed a lot of drop rates because 70s were going back to farm Grey's.
---
So for actual vanilla, yes this is post tbc nerf.
---
Because he’s missing the flight masters for the short way and this is the only way remaining without them
---
It seemed even enough at first and still does seem fairly even but I do detect a slight horde bias especially since server transfers went up. (Why anyone would transfer off Sulf to begin with, I dunno)
---
Me reading this thinking: Hah, you're old. 
---
Also me, counting the decades: Oh my god same for me...
---
Not sure where you're getting pally tanks aren't endgame dungeon tanks.
---
I've tanked every dungeon so far without issues. My groups and many others say how they like pally tanks. I've not ever encountered one person at 60 pug or guild that says pally tanks can't dungeon tank.
---
Now if you said dungeon and meant raid I understand. That much is true. Pallies cannot MT and OT is severly sketchy. I'm not trying to be a raid tank. I'm collecting healing gear slowly for raids. But dungeon pallies are just fine...and in a tank shortage they're an important asset.
---
Nah vanilla had both sprint animations based on your speed (source played a rogue almost exclusively in vanilla) maybe not immediately at launch but I started when bwl was added.
---
I don't buy gold but I also don't care much if other people do.
---
Lol this guy
---
2H tanking can be better for rage generation (and that is your threat output) but it depends on content and your healer. Don't try willy nilly with a pug
---
Yeah, but it's much better water!
---
I got my priest to 60 yesterday. 1-43 was a mix of all specs, then 43-55 I was pure shadow (and loved it), then 55-60 was holy, and yesterday after hitting 60 I respecced for my final holy raid build. 
---
But I really liked shadow. Hell, I don't even have wand spec or spirit tap anymore. Grinding mobs for gold is super aggravating and slow now. I don't even want to quest for gold because I get annoyed just thinking about killing quest mobs in this spec. 
---
Super tempted just to say for get any end game raiding plans I may or may not have had, and just doing what I want and playing as a shadow priest. My only concern is that it'll be damn near impossible to gear up. I might get into 5-mans here and there, and maybe even get a drop here and there (which I feel like I'd be stealing from a mage or warlock). but I doubt I'd ever get into a raid. 
---
Should I just do what I want and respec shadow? I mean, it's a game and the whole point is to have fun right? Anyone been through this?
---
The other option is to keep him holy and keep working on my alts to fulfill my grinding/questing/farming desires, but the 1-60 grind was a lot, and my next highest alt is only a 35 rogue.
---
How's that hole you've dug working out for you?
---
The main mafia guilds are CLC and Vampire Clan which have no streamers in them. This has nothing to do with streamers at all. Stop being obsessed with streamers, it's fucking weird
---
On a pserver when I played with a priest I just got some cheap +shadow resist gear like Eidolon Talisman, Opalescent Ring of Shadow res from Scholo and I resisted it a good 80%.
---
Haha, it's brutal, isn't it?
---
Explain yourself 😂😉😃🙃
---
What gear level? Blues? Spriest by a mile? Full T2 + gear - lock by a mile.
---
My man
---
GL trying that on a PvP server.
---
This kind of griefing is not the in spirit of PVP, it never has been. Good try at PR control.
---
How is this even a problem?
---
You are the tank. You are in demand, unless your are utter shite , so you just say 'Foror's reserved, rest of the loot Need/Greed '  and nobody will mind.
---
You can technically do it all as a DPS. The issue here isn’t “what level can I do it” it’s “what group will take me over a higher level”. You’re competing against lvl 60’s now running the dungeon for prebis raid gear. I had a lot of luck forming my own group and advertising a “quest/xp” run. This tends to pull more lower levels in who just want to run the dungeon for fun while leveling and aren’t as picky with credentials.
---
Vael is always in execute range. Druid threat output is still higher.
---
Once you get that juicy Anathema enchanted with spell damage though... those bitches will know that you're there to stay so they better get used to it
---
lol not really, you don't need gear to lvl at light speed as a mage and you only get SM and ZF gear because you can AOE group for those dungeons.
---
1. Is the booty bay AH connected to the rest of the world AH?  I posted some items on their last night, first thing I noticed is that the deposits were really expensive then when I went to SW I saw none of my items show up in the AH
---
2. Is there a list of "updates/changes" that blizzard is implementing every tuesday.  I was posting my alt gold every day to save for a mount and then this morning I logged in to transfer my mount gold back to myself and found that I can no longer send gold to myself (which i guess is how they are combatting gold sellers), but this is very annoying, also I dont see anyway to deposit my "gold" at the bank for safe keeping - I dont trust myself to not spend it on better swords etc.
---
In terms of levelling. Did you quest in the world or did you dungeon level?
---
I’d like to stay prot and dungeon level if possible but I’m not sure what dungeon I should be in at what level etc?
---
There's no rush dude, all content will be viable for the lifetime of the game. I started playing WoW late 2005, and by the time I was in MC they were talking about burning crusade, and there were still plenty of people to play with. Play what you enjoy. I will say though that warrior probably has the most "complete" toolkit available as all of their specs are viable in one way or another.
---
I’m guessing that person doesn’t understand any of standard threat reduction mechanics in Classic. 
---
E.g. mobs that knock back actually reduce their targets aggro when they knock back. Or that melee mobs that have rooted the tank always go to a secondary target. Or that onys fireballs drop their targets threat in P2....or....
---
I mean I get it. It’s not retail. Threat is complicated here. 
---
But. To pretend it doesn’t work? That’s just a sign that someone isn’t paying attention. Because it does. It’s just complicated.
---
Yeah and for some reason I thought you suggested taming the non-elite at 16. You were super clear, I was just reading between pulls. Then, Foror‘s Compendium dropped and I didn‘t ninja it. Today‘s a good day.
---
This
---
I know, I know. I had 3 twinks back in the day too. My original comment getting all the replies refers to the 1. Opportunity cost of obtaining the trinket at 2. This stage of the game (as in wow classic in the current month day and year).
---
Is it a good trinket all around? Sure.
---
Everyone uses addons for a reason... questie, realmobhealth, and vendor price at an absolute minimum.
---
I like that idea a lot. I resisted several with no shadow resist on so I’ll give that a shot. Appreciated again.
---
Congratulations. I hope that keeps you warm at night
---
Yes. I was divorced in 2010 and went from a casual player to a raid lead in a hardcore raid guild (16 raid hours per week). I basically spent nothing for the subsequent 6 years and am now able to retire at age 42.
---
OMG there's an alliance FP in ratchet? ;\_;
---
Personally I just keep a macro button bound to /target (mobname) and I just quick edit it on the fly. 
---
e.g: /target Rexxar
---
You can run around spamming it and if you see the mob, you can right click their portrait and assign a raid icons. The raid icons show through some terrain and can make it super visible.
---
All depends on the healer id say.
---
Near Dia de los Muertos, my high school Spanish class would always take a field trip to Mexicantown, and despite the barred windows, I never felt unsafe, all the people were super friendly, and the bakeries were *amazing.*

Detroit's definitely come a long way in the last few years.

There there. Let me tell you about Elemental Mastery Chain lightning.
---
lul, ya its fun to read this place but i definitely use this anonymous profile for a reason
---
2 weeks played 60 mage 300 cooking fishing and tailoring
---
I'm on Smolderweb and I sometimes put out a similar Guild recruit message
---
Why do you hate hunters so?
---
Somewhat metaphorical.
---
You mean the lashers which actually have comments available from 2005 and 2006 talking about them being nerfed? That's definitely not a TBC nerf.
---
Maybe. Its just a thought still. Problems requires solutions. If I would get this to work I would not use it all the time. Only if group is struggling. It can be frustrating when dpsers constantly pulls aggro etc. Aggro on others than tank can have wide spread implications.
---
So... would only use it if dpsers are not respecting the job that the tank should do.
---
One last thought. Ive had runs when aggro is a litle all over the place. But I felt that players compensated well and the runs were smooth anyway. So I am not the guy that will start hating as soon as aggro is on anyone but me.
---
No I understand the maths. I understood what you were saying before too. It's you not understanding that I'm talking about the literal xp gap increasing, not the difference in levels, which is causing the confusion.
---
Although I think that's because I wasn't clear enough.
---
I understand. I am hoping others can learn from my specific experience.
---
I think that's the best approach if you want to take your time and go through at a leisurely pace. Tell people ahead of time before you invite them.
---
You're the boss as the tank, I just know I personally would rather run a dungeon fast twice than slowly once.  
---
The game can be played many ways and nobody's way is the only way.
---
same spot
---
How are Padres vs Senior Designers?
---
&gt; play the game.
---
says the guy using discord to convince opposing faction to not attack him lmao
---
Considering that WoW subscriptions were in their peak during TBC/WotLK, I really can't see them not pushing those out eventually. The content will get stale, likely much faster than it did back in 2005.
---
That’s not true lol.
---
Oops lolllllllll
---
Well he could always try since people on reddit tend to believe everything told to them.
---
Ok so end all be all, "play what you want" like everyone says. This is true, if you really don't like a class you won't enjoy leveling it.
---
But for someone who is totally new, and doesn't know what class to play, I have one recommendation: Play. A. Druid.
---
They can heal, they can DPS, they can tank, they have great move speed increases, they can stealth, they have the highest PvP evasion of any class in the game so they are very difficult to gank... It's a bit of a learning curve because they have a lot going on, but classic has a good way of easing people into new classes. You slowly learn your abilities, and figure out how they all work as you get them; so it's really not that bad. Their utility will teach you how all of the roles work and give you an idea of all of the different classes and playstyles, and how they all work. 
---
At the very least, if you end up deciding "you know what, I don't really want a druid and want to switch off" you'll have a much better understanding of what all of the other classes are like. As long as you get to like level 20+, you'll have at least some understanding of healing, tanking, caster DPS, and melee dps. You'll have a much better idea of which class has a play style you'll enjoy.
---
I don't get it either. I'm not an elitist by any means and could certainly make some improvements to my own(like optimizing energy pooling/swing timer), but man it sure would be nice to clear Ony+MC in one night rather than carrying the handful of dead weight warriors/mages who seem to be going afk half the fight.
---
Mage rolled need on (soon to be mine) +shadow damage BoP gloves this morning. Wasnt happy about it as spriest since i lost that roll.
---
Wait for real? So if I'm a 47 I get more XP for killing a lvl 47 mob than a lvl 48 or 49 mob?
---
Thankfully it's only used in 2 recipes. Yes the set is good, but there are other options out there it's not like you're 100% gridlocked into those two items or you can play. Then again, people seem to only follow bis lists and anything not on their listing is unacceptable trash.
---
Remember, MC, which drops better gear, can be cleared with half the raid in greens and not even level 60.
---
Why the fuck wouldn't you all roll need on the pattern after he was a dick about a 10g blue BoE? I would have need rolled that before he even saw it in the loot window.
---
There's that too, but neither of my tank characters is a warrior (my warrior is barely at level to do deadmines).  I'm more referring to groups with 2-3 people who can tank (often at least one warrior) searching for an hour or more for a tank because everyone in the group already is "only dps."
---
A decent mix of both. Mostly questing / grinding with some dungeons to fill in the gaps. At level 49 your options are Maraudon and ZF, approaching ST (garbage dungeon), and then you can start doing the first half of BRD around 53-55. 
---
If you don't already know - you absolutely do not need to be specced deep into prot to tank dungeons, especially below level 60. I tanked every dungeon as Arms up until level 60 when I switched to the 31/5/15 MS + prot spec.
---
^ they are using cross faction comms. CLC and Vampire Clan work together and never touch each other, they KoS everyone else
---
As i had already alch and taloring, the 49 one will be making mooncloth and arcanite, so it will be a free gold cooldown.
---
Im lvl 29 already on the orc, so i think i will get to 50-60 in no time.
---
It depends on the situation. During fights, I'd say yes. In between pulls, I'd say no, since the healer is trying to regain their mana so the group can move on. I'd say that complaining that the healer isn't healing your life taps while they are drinking is a dick move. Just throw some silver at a mage and get some food or water, it makes the whole thing go faster.
---
It's literally all I did for hours while waiting for raids.
---
Fishing?
---
Grinding?
---
Farming?
---
No...  Wall jumping around for no real reason.
---
Use what you want to use. Idk why people have to criticize everything.
---
I never heal life taps if it's during non combat. Drink with everyone else, selfish ass.
---
Hes a fuck.
---
I honestly don't even take iswarm, I just do another point in improved enrage for more snap threat in dungeons. But other than that that's what I'm using. 
---
A lot of druids overuse rejuv even with moonglow...probably one of the most common mistakes.
---
It’s a long drive on the Car Mount, driven it a few times. No way to portal, costs too much good for gasoline.
---
I second Questie. It's made my questing life so much easier.
---
Instant poison is uh... instant. It just deals damage and doesn't leave a debuff.
---
They dont have  respect for other players. i just put them in my ignore list, i would  rather search for another healer or tank or dps than get trashcan in my group.
---
I heal life taps and consider it a normal part of a warlock's dps. I also play a warlock, so I know not to over tax the healer.
---
If a warlock life taps excessively I have to let them remain injured (I consider "excessive" to be using it over and over to jump their mana from empty to full). As a priest it's much better for me if a lock uses life tap frequently, but spread out so that renew can do most of the legwork.
---
I guess I see it as this: your healer is a healer, not a mana battery. I heal the warlocks who can tell the difference.
---
And if you are the tank in my 5 man guild run, I would happily pass it to you.  That's why we are in a guild!!!!! 
---
I don't understand people who want this kind of loot and don't join a guild that runs dungeons every day.   (not saying they have to play every day, but they have to give themselves the option to join proper guild dungeon groups)
---
Why are people so mad that a paladin got BRE?
---
So you got carried as a 12 year old hunter ? Seems right
---
I'm Alliance on Incendius level 45 and the balance seems to be nearly 50/50. Maybe very slightly horde favored but I've never felt outnumbered in any zone.
---
So get more FPs lol
---
It's not the lifetapping that bothers me. If I throw a renew your way, it usually nullifies the amount of life lost. It's more the lifetapping out of combat that annoys me. Bring water, bring food, bring bandages.
---
Let's get one thing straight, right now.  You're healer, is not a warlocks indirect mana replenisher!  Your healer has a mana pool, that keeps the group alive.
---
When the healer is drinking between each and every fight, and the warlock isn't drinking at all because of the healer healing life taps?  Then something is very wrong there.
---
Now, with that said, I do heal warlocks that are life-tapping, but it is, "Best-effort".  I run a resto druid, my best effort is, he get's a Rejuv, and that's it!  And that is only if I have the mana to spare.  If the run is going well, and I'm not drinking between each and every fight because the tank is actually spec'd and geared properly, then i'll upgrade the warlock to a regrowth, and sometimes, regrowth and rejuv.
---
Exactly!
---
Yeah I get you.
---
&gt;they wouldn't have drain life.
---
I guess if you want your warlock to be #4 on the DPS in a 5 man dungeon, drain life will work just fine.
---
it's the most competitive server by far. Perfect faction balance It's a blast to play on. I can't imagine why you'd want to be on a different server.
---
The guilds dominating the server (CLC and Vampire Clan) don't even have streamers in them
---
As a paladin main, I stand better chances outrunning you than letting you fear/dot me to death. Your only weakness in pvp is mobility or rogues, so I count my blessings with my measly 8% movement speed buff.
---
Hey guys I was wondering if I have fallen too far behind to keep playing? I am a lvl 46 warrior and my concern is by the time I hit 60, I will be irrelevant and no one will be running the things I will need to run.
---
Intellect will give you a larger mana pool, and at certain intervals, will give you a higher chance to crit with spells.
---
Spirit will regen your mana faster after you haven’t cast a spell for 5 seconds. (Mana per 5 seconds is independent of this, you will always be ticking mana up with mp5 gear)
---
Healing/spell damage will increase the amount of damage or healing for each spell (not crits).
---
I don’t know your true needs, but hopefully this helps. Usually bis gear has a nice balance between the int/spirit and damage/heal increase
---
I'm honestly glad the streamers all decided to have their own containment realm
---
ah gotcha
---
Welcome to the minority my friend :)
---
We all learn from this. I mean you have to look at this in sheer gold value, even with boe epics the gold value is just too high to let your tank/healer/dps (when pugging) ust get it for free because it dropped. With the gold anybody could convert said drop they can't use into a drop they can. So in theorie what just dropped was 280+ gold. Not a book. Ppl would never pass on a bag filled with 300g if it dropped.
---
Crazy that its not a BoP drop, but cool that someone can sell it.
---
Bravo, Nolan.
---
Not having relentless strikes, lethality, or imp S&amp;D just seems lacking and I can't find a good way to get it without missing out on a lot of the 5th row subt stuff (which I love).
---
Ghost mushrooms are 1g on my server now that dm is out.
---
wtf
---
im disc - PI right now, collecting gear for shadow.
---
also collecting SP gear for disc power..
---
basically im just farming cloth gear so i can do whatever i want lol. but PI disc is alright, i do miss spirit tap tho.
---
The nerve that controls your ring and pinky finger run through a channel in your elbow. You haven't been leaning on it excessively have you?
---
Also, do you not use your middle finger for Right Mouse? Strange..
---
Source: I gave myself cubital tunnel syndrome when Classic launched. Don't lean on your elbows, folks.
---
While other people are throwing fits about rolling need/greed on BoE epics - this is what grinds my gear personally. 
---
Roll on items that fit the role you're in at the time of the drop, unless the person currently playing your "offspec" role lets you roll.
---
Usually, yes. Most pugs are led by guilds and by now those guilds are almost always supplying their own tanks, and they don’t want any competition for them in gearing.
---
You can try and lead your own pug, but that’s going to be much harder to fill than a guild already supplying 20 members and some stability.
---
Save your raptor flesh
---
Currently in school in Welland, it's something else that's for sure
---
Yeah that’s not always true
---
Well we'd still probably clear it faster with the lock doing 4th damage than we would if we had to wait for me to drink more often because I kept blowing through my mana keeping your mana bar full.
---
Yeah really depends on the heals. Healer not having Mana will slow your group down more than the extra dps and threat would help it. Btw arms is a bad threat spec - fury is better for threat and much more dps with a shield and you can dw or 2h depending on your gear. I'd check out some fury specs that might work out for you.
---
For #2, are you sure that you just hadn't typed anything in the subject line?   You can't send a mail with no text in the subject line.  When you send items, the subject line automatically populates with the first item you add to the mail, but if yo'ure only sending gold, you need to manually add a subject.
---
Been kind of nostalgic for my Wrath-era DK lately. Not sure what class in classic would help fill that gap. Looking at Warlock and SPriest for having access to shadow magic, DoT spells to simulate diseases, and being overall pretty tanky/immobile classes. Warrior/Paladin get to fill that feeling of being plate and wielding a big weapon. Rogues also get to be melee and poisons are similar to diseases in idea.   
---
Currently leaning most towards Warlock as I think it might have the most similar gameplay despite being a caster, but wasn't sure if anyone else had any thoughts.
---
BOY you must be fun at parties, meathead.
---
That’s false lmao. It’s all about mitigation.
---
Alright ill try to find someone in-game, thanks for the tip
---
probably about 5% of players on Faerlina care about streamers at this point,
---
It's the most competive server with the best faction balance in NA. Ggs lol enjoy your gigascuffed server btw
---
I thought shadow priests would be easier to play due to their rotation being very straight forward compared to a lock or a mage.
---
&gt;Basically all DM exploits and easy gold were nerfed long before the patch classic is based off...
---
Ah okay so we are based off of 1.12?
---
Cool, I'll go farm tyra hand with my naxx gear!
---
Stop. Making. Shitty. Excuses.
---
They are doing post 1.12 nerfs on vanilla content, nerfs designed for people in tbc gear and levels. It's stupid. Blizzard needs to stop hiring art majors for their development staff.
---
Every spell has a correct time and place.
---
That being said, I always start off by telling my locks to feel free to tap as much as they need.
---
Healing self-inflicted damage is a lower priority than damage from mobs. Simple as that.
---
I'll heal them when I can, but I also feel confident that my 30% hp lock will be just fine as long as they don't have aggro.
---
No gear upgrades but enchants and 55 water are upgrades.
---
We're more than 5-6 years away from convincing video deepfakes, at least if we're talking about the purely AI-driven technique that we currently call "deepfakes".  AI's great for getting 95% of the way there, not so great at getting that last 5%, and that last 5% is critically important for convincing video.
---
I suspect what would actually become a workable solution that we'd actually see in use in 5-6 years' time would be an approach that combines some AI for data *extraction* with more traditional, purpose-built techniques for video *synthesis*.  E.g., use an AI to extract a head model of the "output" actor, data about expressions from the "input" actor, then through non-AI code put that expression onto the "output" actor's model and use traditional rendering to render it into the scene over the "input" actor's performance.
---
To a degree, sure. Throwing a single renew on a lifetapping 'lock won't break the mana bank. But I agree that they should maybe have a updated wand so that when it looks like the healer mana would be too low to manage a tank *and* their lifetapping habits, they can still manage some damage.
---
What makes them so bad in BGs?
---
&gt;If the mana you gain from life tap, and subsequent damage as a result, is not worth the mana I will spend healing you, you are not getting healed.
---
If that's ever the case, then you're better off just booting the lock and 4 manning.
---
People said (and still say) that MC and Ony were not for casuals and it feels like your statement just moved the bar back.
---
Nothing in classic is going to be hard for us.  We know too much and the fights weren't too hard.  By the time we get to Naxx, guilds will still be recruiting and any active player will see them if they want it.
---
It really comes down to if he can put in more hours than his guild needs to raid.
---
To be actually helpful, try wow-professions.com - they have good classic guides!
---
I see, thank you.
---
Start without, add them 1-2 at a time as the need appears.
---
I started without a quest addon and had fun reading the descriptions and finding the objectives. At some point, that got boring, and I installed an addon for it.
---
Same for other stuff... AdiBags once I got tired of sorting my inventory myself, shadowed unit frames when I got to a point where I wanted more information on my frames (specifically, I installed it so I can see my mana bar while I'm shapeshifted).
---
I am looking for a pure farm char which is focussed on killing stuff. Additional requirements are that the char is super easy to level up and not mega gear dependent since it won't have access to raids. Keeping that in mind, I am torn between Frost Mage and BM Hunter. Desired professions are Mining+Skinning.
---
Are there any other specs that I should look into?
---
Who of you have played Hunter and Mage and can say something about how chill they are to play/level. Is the constant drinking as Mage annoying? Is managing ammo and pet food a hinderance while grinding as a Hunter?
---
Thanks yeah that makes sense.
---
[See? Everything is fine](https://imgur.com/zvxKbwT)
---
Black Lotus for 16-20g? I wish. 35-40g on mine and rising.
---
I would prioritize feral shit. You honestly don't really even need anything in resto to heal stuff while leveling. 
---
In a 5 man, the intellect from hotw is going to do more for you than the reduced mana cost which is more of a raid talent.
---
Yeah sorry mate the prices you list along with comments from other people lead me to think you’re full of shit.
---
I’m sure you made good money but this wouldn’t be the first time someone on the internet grossly exaggerated to seem cool
---
My PvP policy
---
MAIM KILL BURN MAIM KILL BURN MAIM KILL BURN
---
Dont forget to use the new picture in picture mode to watch some youtube while you're at it!
---
Yeah except you KNOW you get no loot. So it inherently fosters people bringing their B game instead of A game.
---
Even though I know it, back in the day I used to take the long way (since back then, I wasn't aware of it). Now it just feels weird "cheating" the route.
---
Gamezero spamming trade like usual, that absolute legend.
---
Exactly this. Find out for yourself!
---
In my OPINION healers' mana pools are for main tank primarily. If it's no sweat, go ahead and heal life tappers but keep priorities in check.
---
I only run with Questie and Auctionator.
---
Thanks a bunch, mage here I go!
---
Tanaris and badlands are literally swamped with alliance atm, lmao. Keep being stuck in denial though.
---
Only if you value all loot the same, which you don't have to.
---
We all know bracers aren't worth as much as weapons and that's why zero-sum DKP wasn't good enough.
---
first link to a website gives a forum post containing the info you seek. the way you typed your search, bing assumed there was a possibility of the search being addresses, so it showed the map for it  you could use "level 150" rather than just 150 to tend the search away from the address issue
---
You do realize that the health to mana to damage conversion for Warlocks is extremely efficient, right?
---
With Shaman, you place down 4 totems so there's 6 potential targets for sacrifice.
---
It's a neutral FP for both factions isn't it?
---
I would definitely settle for that
---
What are some useful engineering items for a level 30 warlock with engineering?
---
yes exactly, you can start all of those about 1 lvl earlier then what you mentioned
---
If only Warriors had 3 abilities that instantly put them on top of a mob’s threat list.
---
He’s got perseverance we’ll give him that
---
Thanks for the nostalgia RO brother
---
I never understand how you can tell people they are wasting their lives while playing the same game as them.
---
Times like these I am glad I was raised by an alcoholic. He woulda came in, told me of better sites to use and paid for a hooker if I asked and bought me a pack of condoms.
---
On top of that Fortnite black hole thing that took their game offline for at *least* a month?  Gotta pour some out for those little guys; it's been a rough time.
---
Last time I was in STV i didnt see a single horde. Only alliance players. So nah, even that is not true.
---
I do. It’s too dps a lot. But it’s been proven that a feral with everything bis can bear it. Go look it up before you go off about shit you know nothing about.
---
Rather not say
---
2mannable with Shaman only at this gear point, I'd imagine. Totems are potential sacrifice victims.
---
I am sympathetic to the prot warrior case. Outside of dungeon tanking you're sort of lost. Everything is annoyingly slow and tedious. And most probably don't know that just collecting the tank gear that is barely wanted anyhow would empower their dps spec enough for most stuff. On the other hand, people also expect tanks to lead, know everything and literally carry the group single handedly. Not everyone wants to do that. Good dps also is involving but in the end you still just follow that dude there and when you check out for a bit, it's usually inconsequential.
---
Finally spec switching is expensive. Some will do that later, but not so early in the game's cycle where gold is scarcer.
---
This seems a good spot for a warlock question; is there a time and place for downranking life tap? Does the mana gained (which scales from +spell pwr) also increase the health taken? I haven't figured it out yet... but rank 1 LT gives me over 100 mana now for maybe a cost of 30 health? Anyone know the answer to this?
---
\+1 warlock brother. On the same subject I keep seeing posts for tanks offering to tank dungeons but only if each party member pays them 10g+. IS that not ridiculous?? That is their role and they want to be paid for it?!
---
Ahh you must be too retarded to understand logic
---
nononono  take a deep breath, step back and look at it neutrally.
---
It's fair for everybody.  20% chance for everybody
---
RULE 1.  This is about BOE!!!   
---
RULE 2. This is about PUGs!  
---
Ok we got that clear. let's continue.
---
The warrior rolls on the expensive priest drop, the mage rolls on the expensive warrior drop, etc Everybody rolls on EVERY Very Expensive BoE item.  20% chance for everybody on these things.  It's literally the MOST fair system.   
---
Needing for class use is actually less fair because not every class has such items, which would mean some classes have 0% chance on these while others have some chance.  
---
REMINDER: Remember rule 1 and rule 2! (I apologize for spamming this, but  previous experience with advocates of your school of thought show that people easily forgot this)  
---
So what to do as a class who actually needs such an item?  You have two good options
---
1.  Join a guild that has enough people to do guild runs. Your guildies will pass such items to their reliable tank. 
---
2.  Make a group  and reserve this item.   This is not greedy, it's a fair way to provide a service (tanking) with a small benefit for yourself  (getting the item on the tiny chance that this will drop)  
---
and finally there is always
---
3. Buy it  (partly financed with some other expensive BOE , like a Flask recipe you managed to get despite not having alchemy   ;)      ) 
---
Good luck!
---
Mage rolled need on a boe last night. Was nice drop. Int spirit +spell and leather.  
---
I hate mages this go around
---
Lol mumble and TS. How are you this out of the loop.
---
Base mana isn't actually much of your mana. Base health and mana got raised drastically and rebalanced in Wrath of the Lich King.
---
Even if you take off all your gear your innate stats might contribute more to your pool than base mana.
---
Care to explain why?
---
Well, yes. People run dungeons to farm gear. If they weren't undergeared, they wouldn't be in dungeons.
---
The Priest's gear is irrelevant to the fact that Warlocks who **abuse** lifetap are slowing the group down, which is the point ponzLL was making.
---
Asked for opinions but thank you for the tips fam.
---
I mean we are a steady medium server now except first thing in the morning.  Not like tiny ole Arcanite Reaper.
---
Elesham’s as well.
---
2.	Both can be chill, however with hunter you can just auto shot and relax lol. 
---
4.	Not really, just have to keep reminding yourself to get ammo (or buy on alt and just mail to hunter). I rarely buy food, mainly get it from mob kills. The bag space for food/ammo is annoying though. 
---
6.	 not too much time, once you get your pain pet you can Keep them until max level, just have to occasionally get another pain to train up their skills about every 10 levels.
---
Immediately going to personal insults, wow. You can fuck right off.
---
Frostadamus also streamed himself getting 10k gold while farming ZF and selling herbs. Where there is a will, there's a way.
---
I mean i googled her and... Excuse me i'll be back soon
---
55-60 did you only do dungeons to level?
---
Half my server (low pop) is screaming for spellcleaves
---
You don't need ideal play to clear dungeons.
---

You don't even need to leave Tanaris to have 10k gold right now as a mage
---
Time stops for you, this is the problem. 11 hours probably feel like it when you’re immersed... at least you’re having fun, right? 
---
I probably should stay away.
---
Bing.com
---
Yes. XP from kills is split by damage. No damage, insanely low exp.
---
Ok buddy, go put on your goblin tin hat and stop spouting nonsense.
---
Good to know! Im new to tanking in classic but tanked everything in bc besides bt and sunwell and a little more in Wrath. I cant wait to give classic raiding a try!
---
I’ve been in for a while now.
---
When were they the top?
---
Like they made a good game, but I've never heard of them being particularly reliable bug fixers, or transparent with their communication.
---
Try playing in a server with people?
---
Lol I live right by strathcona county... funny that this popped up randomly on the map
---
Yeah their mindset cringes me out big time.
---
I have a 59 priest on a pve server and really like it. I kind of wanna make an alt though but I'm pretty indecisive. Warlock seems ok but I already have a clothie, and I don't like pet classes. or at least I didn't back in the day. mage seems overpopulated. druid seems like a jack of all trades but master of none. rogue is moderately intriguing, but I heard they suck to level. hunter is a pet class. paladin seems sort of boring since I already have a healer and I'm not too sure on pally tanking. warrior seems cool but there are so many of them, and ive also heard leveling them sucks too. 
---
what do :(
---
It's personalized to you since I'm replying to you.
---
PvE servers are so boring lol, how can you even unironically roll on that
---
However the Flameweave Cuffs have of Frozen Wrath have a 0,4% drop chance (10% dropchance, 4% for frozen wrath affi). I'd rather farm Sublime and spend the other 100 hours you don't farm Flameweave on grinding out flasks and use them for better effect (if you so choose).
---
That’s awesome. I live in the City just South of Welland!
---
Wow you're spare parts aren't ya bud
---
Wall walking was a thing in TBC? You could shortcut the beginning of the first dungeon with it.
---
I’ve gotten my shaman to level 43 using enhancement, and it was fun. Not the *most* fun class I’ve leveled but not the worst either. I’ve heard some guides suggest switching to elemental around this level as that gets a lot better once you can reach the end of that talent tree. Just wondering what reddit’s opinion on this is. I imagine even with talents its quite mana intensive? I’m not trying to be 100% most efficient leveler possible (I read that using a 1H + shield was the most efficient way to do enhancement leveling but I just couldn’t bring myself to do it, swinging a giant 2H was so much more fun) so I’m ok with some downtime to drink but I don’t want to have to drink after every pull either. I do have a lot of int gear as I kept a healing set with me (for 5 mans while leveling) but much of it is cloth and leather so if I need to refocus on int gear I’ve got some work to do.
---
Or should I just stick with enhancement all the way to 60? I’m still having fun with it but it is getting noticeably harder/slower as my level increases. Or maybe my gear just sucks. Curious to hear what other people think, both in terms of what is faster for leveling but also which is more fun.
---
Same people that are behind the banks and auction markets
---
👍
---
Grew up in welland 10/10 would avoid
---
Right, wait for the lock's summons, then kick him. His job is done.
---
You’re in for a nasty reality check in phase 2.
---
What's in yer mind?
---
Found the gold buyer.
---
Lmao my first time playing was in wrath and I played a hunter.  Had no idea how even the most basic things worked cause I was in 4th grade.  Apologize to any group I wiped because my pet was on aggressive.  I also used multi shot on single target because I was retarded and didn't know how any spells worked I just used them randomly.
---
Stopped playing when I got to level 40 ish because I had gotten an xbox 360 with modern warfare 2 for my birthday that year.  Now in classic Im almost 60 (57), and I actually understand the game.
---
It's a give and take really. Most of the time I will leave them be but the situation changes drastically if they roll up on a farm being use my my faction and try to strong arm away.
---
Ganks deserve a gank in kind so I totally understand that though regardless of faction.
---
yes. I have mitigated this by 1. finding a good guild that runs stuff daily and 2. making my own groups. if you /w people, you *will* fill a party.
---
So i have down time at work every so often.  I am able to remote into my home computer and can boot up WoW, but I'm not able to really do much (moving around in-game is a little difficult by itself).
---
I'm thinking I could use down time to do some mindless fishing.  I guess I could also play the auction house game. Are there other activities that are easy to do with limited functionality?
---
Obviously that's as a raid warning, but can swap to say or party easily
---
&gt; Well, yes. People run dungeons to farm gear. If they weren't undergeared, they wouldn't be in dungeons.
---
That's really not the case at 60. People run the same dungeons over and over for raids.
---
&gt;The Priest's gear is irrelevant to the fact that Warlocks who abuse lifetap are slowing the group down, which is the point ponzLL was making.
---
It's very relevant. Healers' heals turn into mana turn into damage turn into less time in the dungeon.
---
Sure 🤪
---
Thanks :)
---
I actually came really close to scrapping it out of frustration. I started with the UI elements which took way longer than I thought they would and then when I went to start on the figure I had to actually do half a dozen practice sketches to figure out how to draw an undead horse and how to fit the character on top without being too zoomed out or hidden behind the boxes all without the benefit of a pencil layer.
---
I wonld up doing the horse/character drawing on a second page and editing the UI boxes back over the top after scanning in so that I could make the whole thing sightly wider than the A4 page I draw on. You can see the clipping around the merchant buy back screen because I'm lazy - hope that doesn't spoil the magic for you :P
---
Like I said, I've seen this happen so, so, SO many times, not just with WoW private servers, but with other MMORPG private servers too.
---
Some guy comes crying to the forums that the evil nasty GMs banned him "for no reason", swears up and down that he did nothing wrong, and then a GM stops by the thread and points out that the player was cheating/hacking/botting/RMT.

Your raw dps isnt amazing, but 2-3 hunters will be in most raids
---
Bizarre logic. Apart from tier gear you share literally everything with fury warriors.
---
Yeah... I built a new PC and got myself a new WQHD monitor to go along with it so I can play wow in style. So no, I'm not saving shit.
---
To be honest, you should make things easy on the healer.   Send them a whisper before the run and tell them when and when not to concern themselves with healing you.  Usually I tell the group when healthstone is on cooldown, and I tell the priest at the start that only worry about me when my health AND mana are both dangerously low.   If I tap too much and I fail to let anyone know, that is completely my mistake and I DESERVE to go down.
---
As a fellow warlock, I know as well as you know, that we have some unique mechanics.  We might look like we are in trouble, but we're often completely under control.  Used correctly we can effectively trade mana for health and vice versa, as well as replenish on the fly.    Help people in your party to understand you.
---
Okay, good. Well not good that it took you out, but you know what I mean. I guess I've just been missing it. Odd.
---
I cry my self to sleep every night cause I don’t have good karma on reddit.
---
Yeah i'm actually thinking of going fury now at 55, need to get familiar with it for raid dps anyways. Arms is just so nice to be able to stance dance to whirlwind packs, taunt when necessary, sweeping strikes and overpower on a dodge. But I know fury is the meta, probably time for a switch
---
IRL or a druid?
---
Drink with the mages instead if you're gonna tap out of combat.
---
Sure, and I won't even say everything I do is optimal or anything like that. Probably not even close. But what are you doing if you're not trying?
---
I dare say his entire point is that it's just a game.
---
The worst part of the trip is the 45 minutes you spend in Indiana.
---
You can't get multiple skillups from one vein. Unless you mean the smelting afterwards
---
Yeah, there has been plenty of gear I wanted to roll need on but it would be a dick move to take it from a Warlock/Mage. Also, shame on you hunters who take HoJ from melee (Seen this, I kid you not).
---
That’s just not right.
---
Should have been free transfers for the overpopulated faction only.
---
Its not about ethics at all. In 90% of cases if the tank convinces you guys to let him have it hes putting that bitch on the AH asap lol
---
Sulfuras seems to be slightly more horde than alliance.  As an alliance player I like that.
---
Okay. My point still stands. 
---
I know what my heals are worth. I know what the tank and other party members need. 
---
If the warlock’s life tap is getting in the way, they’re not getting healed.
---
Getting manaburned in bearform
---
IIRC, it can skill all the way to 75
---
Well if it helps, I have killed it in retribution about 10 times since for fun in our group haha. Sometimes we make little escapades to go there and take him out now that we are much higher level.
---
What were your DPS and healer at though?  Party comp?
---
At any rate, we were discussing dps, but I have had 54 tanks go for emp as well and the issue is threat is slow and damage is big because your DPS have to slow down.  Not necessarily in the torch room where mages can just blast everything, but afterwards.
---
I think your perspective for 'no issues' is maybe different from what the dps and healer felt.
---
I did my first classic onyxia last week. Walking in and seeing her in the cave is still impressive
---
It should be incredibly infrequent that you would come across a situation where your heal is worth less than the damage a Warlock is putting out. With your +heal gear, improved lifetap, and the lock's +SP gear, the lock would basically have to be afk.
---
When i got tranq shot, my former gm told me that from now on i'll have no problems getting into mc raids and lootlocked me from the rest of the run. Found out about lootlock when first peace of t1 dropped. 4 t1 dropped that night. Felt quite salty. Still waiting on pple shouting for hunter with tranqshot for mc, so i could shine. Fml.

Put two first points in Remorseless then do whatever you want.

Apparently being mad that this shit is coming at him at all, let alone being baseless, is also proof he's guilty. I'm surprised no one has set up a pitchfork emporium.
---
YouTube “DOGZ get majordomo loot ninjaed” for a good laugh. People were routinely joining their guild just to ninja.
---
You should have needed it.
---
AC = Armor Cap?
---
Click MCP, do more ST threat than any furyprot warrior who's now taking an insane amount of damage.
---
Nice try though.
---
And on my server devilsaur is dirt cheap now....people need to realize devilsaur is only in high demand on fresh servers.  Most people who were serious enough about raiding to actually need the devilsaur set, have already gotten it.
---
I am afraid there is nothing you can do, I had the same problem when I was making my bank alt guild ranks.
---
Jumping in about another thing but i use MSBt, i added overpowered like a big guy and it advertise me well in solo, but in groupe it also trigger from other ppl :(
---
Anyone know what to do ? or use another Battle text addon ?
---
sure kid, whatever you say. Badlands which doesn't even have an alliance settlement swamped with alliance. I guess someone hurt you, and I'm pretty glad they did and hope they continue to do it... I might even help if you give me your in game name
---
I'll never join a vanilla guild if there is no loot council, but what your guild is doing is some pyramid scheme shit. Leave immediatly.
---
There's this bizarre perception that DPS is what makes runs go fast or slow. It ain't. Not dying, and smooth pulls with controlled aggro are. There are no meaningful DPS checks in classic dungeon content.
---
DPS want to top the charts because it's fun, and have convinced themselves this is critical to finishing a dungeon. All you need is good enough, which does not require lifetapping.
---
It is really rough until mid 30s, but it is a lot better after that.
---
Whirlwind, Sweeping strikes, and plate armor solve a lot of issues.
---
Because none of your post matters except for not wanting to buy drinks. If you just do your job and heal everyone and drink for a bit after every pull, there is never any problem.
---
They wouldn't join a group where orbs are reserved.
---
He very obviously is full of it.
---
&gt; If you use them for everything
---
Is this something they enforce? or are you saying that the more services you use from them, the more avenues you have to accumulate points?
---
I would play a while without addons to get an idea how it is and being able to compare to addons. This is why I plan to level a bank alt to lv 5 immidiately to get a refresher. I have a list with addons I plan to use after that.
---
If you want to have addons which don't change the look and feel you can check out this: https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d86rs0/my_list_of_recommended_addons_that_will_improve/
---
There are more important addons so I would take this as a foundation and keep an eye out on what's good. Bigwigs, Details!,fishingbuddy, Spy and more are all useful
---
&gt;Hell no, let them get back to full first
---
this is where you fucked up
---
You had no fun because you joined a hardcore raiding guild from the sounds of it. Sounds like they already have it on farm. That isn’t any fun. The fun is learning and growing with a guild. Working through struggles, pushing through each boss etc. 
---
No one wants to join a loot vendor. If you want that, retail is a better place than classic.
---
Yep, sorry, but downvoted. Homogenization is one of the main reasons people lost their love for retail and came to classic in the first place.
---
You named yourself after an herb.
---
We ran one elemental shaman in TBC
---
&gt;He is draining to recover, not to dps. This provides an up-tempo where the healer focuses on the tank and only emergency heals the dps. 
---
That just draws the encounters out longer than necessary. Meaning more damage on the tank (and whoever else that gets hit) which just leads to the same downtime having to drink form heals.
---
As someone that has been in both types of guilds AND led both types of guilds... Loot council is not less stressful. People complain incessantly about half the decisions. It's a little more work to do dkp/similar systems, but it is worth not having to manage the drama of people getting hurt feelings when they thought they were more deserving for x item.
---
Wasn't it literally impossible?
---
Sure, but saying they are mostly unemployed and having no family ties is nothing but an assumption and it seems like youre just extremely jealous when you talk in such manner.
---
I used this method, only make sure rotgrip +tinkerer is dead before starting princess. 
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/485781453
---
You can start a timer when he does to keep track of when you need to stop fighting tinkerer and run to the top plateau in order to doom rotgrip again
---
At 3:00 dont run up the ramp to the right but run straight to princess instead, rotgrip will slow down in time
---
I put pet attk on Scroll up, passive on Scroll down and juggle vw so he doesnt take too much dmg from princess. You can proc dust field every 20s. Use deadly boss mods if u want a timer.
---
Juggle/kite her around the small rock if you are in trouble at the end.

12-20g per reset? Yeah...
---
Don’t do outdoor AoE. It sucks. Every spot in the game is taken by other mages and/or questers.
---
 If you are in a guild, or can find one, with members who want to AoE grind dungeons it’s amazing. Doing so without a guild usually takes a lot of effort to make the party and you need to be lucky enough to find capable team members.

The ranking of Alliance races that make me want to kill on sight
---
1. Gnome
---
2. Dwarf

3. Night elf
---
4. Human
---
For whatever reason i always find humans to be the most passive towards me while out questing. Gnomes however deserve every ounce of ganking they receive. Gnomes are the worst and you should feel bed about it
---
No because you're actually mentally deficient if you *dont* sell it...
---
Prices are at a super premium right now, that shit was selling to guilds for 1500g on my server. It's just the correct thing to do to sell it and buy it later for 1/3 the price.
---
Ok.
---
All druids should solo Gnomer in their late 30s.
---
The Manual Crowd Pummeler has the highest str + agi stats you can get until your late 50s, making it the best leveling weapon, even when ignoring the on-use haste effect.
---
Don't forget to farm Hydrocane too, as a weapon swap to breath underwater is useful, even for a druid.
---
We managed through vanilla, we will do the same now..
---
#nochanges
---
FD/Frost Trap macro though.
---
The retail m+ dps race mentality isn't really necessary in classic imo. Yeah good dps always helps, but it's not anything to cry about unless it's absolute shit
---
I get killed in like 4-5 hits by Rotgrip and Princess..
---
Lmao calm tf down. Anger and lies is no way to try to prove a point. You just look stupid
---
Farm SFK, bank Twink Weapons, hope they sell in Phase 2-3.
---
Thats what I came to say
---
I tank DM E jump runs and reserve the thorium for myself. Thorium Bars go for like 12-15g per stack on my server, and Arcane Crystals are 40-45g. With a full group you can do ~15 minute runs.
---
Well lucky me that I’m not on a competitive realm then :)
---
Yeah I let any group I join that I need 0 gear but I will tank for first orb. 90% have no issues.
---
Well we used SR pots on Loatheb but that's about it. The content isn't even close to hard.
---
Thank you!!
---
Will try it.
---
It will become easier than it is at that level. Best advice is to stick to mobs 1 or 2 levels below yourself, and don't hesitate to spend some rage on demo shout or thunderclap. At low level there isn't much else to use except rend (heroic strike is generally not worth using)
---
.I think you have to consider efficiency of the entire party vs just yourself.
---
What do you mean? More damage means mobs die faster, means less damage taken by the tank (and others), means less heals and the downtime resulting from them.
---
Cool shitpost.   Expected downvote given.  You're welcome ;)
---
No. Are you? 
---
“You’re”, btw.
---
This is why Yang said nobody uses bing
---
I asked why he was getting more xp and it's been explained.
---
I then said that the gap would get bigger following this trend (because I didn't realise q's give more xp to lower levels and that will more than make up the difference.)
---
Although you've been trying to show me that the mob grinding alone would close the gap, which is still incorrect.
---
You do realize that on tough pulls DPS is not the limit, but the ability to heal/keep alive physical DPS who can keep going once the casters run dry right? Per health point, healing physical DPS is vastly more efficient than healing a lifetapping warlock.
---
I'm sorry buddy, but your DPS is shit in a long fight and healing you shortens the length the people who do good DPS over a long time can stay up.
---
Wintersbite? That low level herb?
---
Yep. I always make sure people are aware and ready before i dust them
---
Uh? I read all 13 books and I don't understand :x
---
That said, have you heard the news? We have a date for the 14th book, finally.
---
"...butthurt Carebears..."
---
While you think this makes you look "cool", saying dumbshit like this makes you only look like a total douche.
---
You're pathetic, and your points are mere excuses to cover for being a douche.
---
trying to showcase the "end point" of some logic by pointing out a case where it isn't applicable doesn't quite make sense to me but to each their own
---
for example:

---
I KNEW IT!
---
Not only on that server, I can tell you that on the server I play a horde guild, is "hiring" Ally rogue to sap people who try to loot Devilsaur... It's known and talked about, the problem is that everything is outside wow channel of communication and super hard to prove. 
---
Then what do you do? Ban a whole guild? Ban the GM? Officers?...
---
The problem is that it was borderline impossible even the entire raid played perfectly, had full raid gear from that tier of raiding and also managed to do a high level of dps despite all the required movement. The problem with the fight was just number. How many tentacles spawned and how much damage had to be done. How much healing had to be done due to the tentacles. It was just bad math.
---
I enjoy neckbeard drama, C A R T E L I Z A T I O N at its finest. 
---
God I love economics.
---
I switched to ele, and while some people love it, I really didn’t think it was that amazing. Unless you have a decent set of caster leather, you’ll be wearing a lot of cloth to boost your stats since there really isn’t much caster mail for awhile. Which means you can’t really take much of a beating. I ended up switching back (I’m 52) within 2 levels and have been running enh/resto and really enjoying it. Getting the quest staff from ZF and then charstone dirk and tinkerer shield from mara are key for getting through the 40s, as that bit of of extra mana with mana spring makes grinding noticeably quicker.
---
Can’t you go shadow and just dps in raids?
---
I've bound auto-attack to one of my mouse buttons.If I've got no target it usually targets the nearest one. You also have the option to bind a key to target nearest hostile if you look under key binds.
---
I noticed this too.  It's ridiculous.  Does anyone know if the Silithus FP (or any of that zone for that matter) exists yet?
---
If you are SM ruin, use imp and have the imp run through or next to princess to trigger aoe, if you have any items that spawn helpers it makes it a lot faster too. My best time on princess was 1 min 0.44 seconds but normally i do about 1:40-1:50. If you wanna play it safe it's a bit slower i stop a lot to spam shadowbolts on her. You just need to be smart about triggering the aoe.
---
I agree it sucks, but druids have a LOT of other useful tools that make up for that, and that make them worth having in a group.
---
Maybe thats why i never get ganked
---
&gt; That's really not the case at 60. People run the same dungeons over and over for raids.
---
Yes, because they want gear. I'm not sure how you're claiming that's not the case.
---
&gt; It's very relevant. Healers' heals turn into mana turn into damage turn into less time in the dungeon.
---
Sure, but if you run with a healer who is struggling with mana and add more strain on his mana by lifetaping ad nauseam, you're effectively making him spend even more time drinking, hence, while the Priest's gear is a variable in that equation, the issue is that you're lifetapping when you should be drinking, not that the Priest is undergeared.
---
ie.: If you **ABUSE** lifetapping, you're slowing things down, not speeding things up.
---
&gt; So all I use it for is to scout out loot I want from certain dungeons.
---
Isn’t that all Atlas loot is for? Other than the rare use of looking up recipe requirements this is litterally 99% of my usage of Atlas loot.
---
I'm not angry lmfao, I'm just debunking your arguments with facts, and as I said you can go test yourself if you don't believe me.
---
Bye now.
---
Grew up in welland and I can confirm this is true
---
Rogues are 2nd highest sustained dps after warriors, much needed in raids, but there are a lot of them
---
They admit they are no lifers. They don’t care what you think lol
---
You get points for searching, and you can also get points for playing little trivia games and etc. You don't have to exclusively use them or anything.
---
As in 'easy to hit with gear' so I shouldn't bother with the talents?
---
Obviously not, they don't have the internet over there, do they?
---
So still nearly 40 hours then
---
Well fuck.
---
I tried with west side. Two ghosts came up from nowhere and killed me in stealth. Cant vanish that shit
---
Just find green quests. Instead of heading to a 11-15 area like west fall right away, go do the 8-10 quests in a different area. For example if you’re an orc who just finished Durotar and are struggling in barrens, go to Tirisfal.
---
This might be frustrating in a different way, but it’s at least an alternative to dying repeatedly.
---
They're proportional, so while they are made up, they are still appropriate.
---
&gt;If you're trying, then you sit down and eat/drink after lifetapping to 50/50 hp/mana.
---
&gt;You don't just expect a healer to run himself OOM and have to drink twice between every pull because you're lazy.
---
I'm pretty sure I didn't say that once in my conversation with you or with anybody else in this thread? So I don't know why you are bringing that up as if I did.
---
&gt; The retail m+ dps race mentality isn't really necessary in classic imo. Yeah good dps always helps, but it's not anything to cry about unless it's absolute shit
---
I don't play retail and haven't since WotLK so the "retail mentality" I think it just trying to distract from the point I was making.
---
Makes sense ill just have to establish myself as a better tank than the competition. Also brining consumables and enchanted gear.
---
Please get tmugsy banned. Worst player on north dale by far and a screeching high voiced idiot.
---
Yes, from what I've read sometimes a raid will take a single shadow priest just to buff warlock damage 15%. You can't even use your DoT spell.
---
I mean, I'd be ok going regardless, but I wouldn't expect to be given priority over a warlock on gear either.
---
Sounds like you are raiding with a bunch of shitty people who just wanna bitch and moan about loot and how they aren't getting enough of it.
---
The ferry that crosses the mouth of Georgian Bay is pretty nice honestly
---
Is sanc worth the trade for Holy Shock?
---
Sure, but then, every case is different.
---
I barely even drink anymore, even in raids, because I regen mana so fast at this point, but what I'm writing is meant to cover the entire spectrum of players, from Deadmines to Molten Core, in a general-ish way.
---
If you can't manage your health and mana beteeen drain life/life siphon/ healthstones then you are the problem not the healer. I have repeatedly told healers not to heal me becuase I can self heal fine.
---
&gt; All I'm saying is taking a little more time on being safe during pulls not only makes the experience less stressful but often results in less wipes and deaths. DPS rushers in 5 mans in classic rarely save as much time as they think they are by trading safety for dps. You often aren't impressing anyone but yourself by getting your name high on meters in pugs.
---
You can have that opinion and it's valid. I would say that the mobs being dead is the safest option rather than drawing out encounters longer than they should where something else has potential to go wrong.
---
It Should be against the rules like it was before though.  There is a reason why the factions cannot talk to each other in game.  I'm lucky that I don't have to deal with this toxic garbage but for those that have to suffer because of it something needs to be done about it.  Getting good won't fix the gear and numbers discrepancy since if you have the gear to beat the mafia you don't need devilsaur anymore.
---
I like going through the city always feels cooler
---
&gt; In case they might spec shadow one day  
---
This is a ruse. Those players are respeccing as soon as they get their bis from dungeons. Some may wait for the honor patch. So many people want to go Shadow for the PVP potential, but they're smart enough to know that no one wants a Shadow Priest in a 5-man dungeon since they bring virtually nothing to the table. So they go heals and just roll need on anything they would use for DPS.
---
QQ
---
They should try printing out more dick flyers.
---
Good lord, y’all have too many gold farmers inflating prices. I like my backwater server.
---
If you can't manage your health and mana between drain life/life siphon/ healthstones then you are the problem not the healer. I have repeatedly told healers not to heal me becuase I can self heal fine.
---
If you skip your prebis, you dont get given raid gear. At least in any decent guild.  
---
Especially devilsaur, its very very overpowered.
---
Shadow protection pots.
---
Try to get the pet with the Nova too. If not ice barrier or even Mana shield to get off a cast without getting pushback. Expect them to feign death at that point and be ready to retarget or aoe so you don't lose cast time.
---
Stop crying and group up. If you’re fed up and Alliance, send me a message on here and we’ll become battlenet friends to fuck em up. If you’re Horde message Codfish in game and let’s grief those scurvy bastards. This is in part of why WoW is so legit, conflict that is created outside of what the game is meant to be. Let’s team up.
---
It's just RNG. Don't over think it.
---
Wooo wee 3 whole clears!
---
That's why you form the groups yourself, having carefully cultivated a large friends list of contacts.
---
Doesnt work for everyone, but dps have to make their own opportunities, not wait for them to arise like tanks/heals.
---
ah DM West the tunnel that explodes?
---
He didn't?  They won the fight on their terms.  Which makes further engagements less likely.  When you are utterly stomped by someone, you don't usually want a second helping.  Demonstrating that you have the superior group and will wreck them if they attempt to keep up any shenanigans, you effectively zone them out of the area or make them play honorably.
---
1500g a raid? That’s hilarious. I cleared AQ40 many times and most of Naxx without using very many consumables.
---
Give your rogue alt awesome BoE weapons, and 2/2 remorseless attacks, and you will nearly half health consecutive mobs in a couple hits due to remorseless attacks sinister strike crits. 
---
People say don’t bother buying boe as you will replace it, but listen to me here: feral blade and cutlas around level 10 to 18, then wingblade until 25, then wingblade and the blackfathom deeps quest sword until 30, when you can buy the BoE flaming torch mace I forget the name of, but basically it has a fiery enchant. I used that weapon until 36 for the SM and RFD quest swords

i recently hit 60 with my shaman and for the most part i leveled as enhance/resto and it wasn’t bad at all even though you have a lot of downtime for drinking. in the early 50s i did swap to ele just to test the waters and it’s definitely a fun spec but i think it comes down to preference. with ele you kinda know how much dmg you can put out as with enhance its rng if you’re running 2H WF. 
---
also, if you plan on healing at 60 i suggest swapped to resto around 58-59(if you have the gear) so you can farm your preraid bis and it’s also easier to find a group as a resto shaman than it is as enhance.
---
You forgot to blank out your name on the item display
---
Use a questing addon like ClassicCodex (ClassicQuestCodex?) or Questie, you'll spend most of your time looking for the *area* to quest in more than you'll spend doing the quests. It's not worth the effort without it. If you do though, go in to interface &gt; addon &gt; ClassicCodex &gt; turn off "auto hand in quest" and "auto complete quest" or you won't get to read the quests,  
---
Also Quartz is a great cast bar addon
---
Well you're talking to me, I assume that you're discussing the things I've said to me. I didn't think you were discussing everybody who was playing the warlock class as a group at that point.

Are you set on playing in the realm or Herod?

"it's a feature that was in fact a bug, but hadn't been fixed by 1.12, so therefore it qualifies as a feature" ;)

So just to correct myself, I actually use a 0/32/19 setup.
---
You don't need tactical mastery to tank, it's really nice but not strictly necessary. If I'm facing mobs that are squirmy/zoom around, I'll throw a piercing howl down on them to make it easier to run up and taunt them off. If it's a emergency, I can just switch to berserker stance (dumping all my rage) and use bloodrage + intercept. I try to stay on top of my rage management so I don't lose too much rage in these situations. 
---
But yes I pretty much sit in defensive stance for 95% of the fight, if not more. I'll initiate with charge + battle or demo or thunderclap before immediately switching to defensive.

They don't tell players that sort of information because it will help those that want to exploit the game figure out how to do it better next time. With that said Blizzard tracks just about everything that goes on in the game to one degree or another. 
---
Here's some of the info they could have been working with: IP address, account information, trades that the player made, auctions placed/purchased, MAC address, play time, how often a person presses an ability (e.g. they press sinister strike every 1.5 seconds with little/no variation), etc.
---
It's a quest item I think. Not a real gun

Just being upfront so people don't call me out on being from clc like they unearthed some conspiracy.
---
Good luck. We got 4 leaves before our first eye :/
---
Install the add-on storyline. It creates a dialog screen when doing quests. Great imersion.
---
I did the math on Target Dummies and I found that I would make like 2G an hour for constant effort, while needing a few hundred gold a day wrapped up in materials. However, maybe my fused wiring price estimate was too conservative. What are they selling for on your server? I did this calculation a while ago, but IIRC my estimate was 10-14 gold each. I'm actually not allowing myself to play until December, so this could be way off from reality.
---
I think it's likely worthwhile as a casual thing when you are still leveling, at the very least, but the problem then is that putting aside money for investment is really hard.
---
what do you mean by sustain? they don't take a lot of breaks to rest?
---
dogzhit
---
It's been like a few weeks of epl.
---
There's no obligation to pass on loot that is an upgrade to your current role in the dungeon (there's a debate about rolling for off-spec that I won't rehash here) just because you've already one one or more items. If you feel like you're winning a lot, it would be polite to pass, especially if this is a group you intend to run multiple dungeons with (chain runs, guild runs), but that's your call.
---
What about using the internet when you REALLY get stuck? Do you really want to know where to go all the time? Told what to do? You will be 60 in no time and forgot all about 80% of the journey in a years time cause your brain did not need to remember, questie did that for you. First time classic and ur wasting it on path following machanics. It seems fun when life is easier, I know normal life is already hard enough, but it gets more boring quicker if you don't immerse urself.
---
had a rogue roll need on the 14str/13sta ring off gordok cause "He didnt get anything this run" -  Neither did I...
---
Had the same thoughts (main is a lock), ended up going with druid and loving my time so far.
---
Yes I won't be the best tank/healer/dps but I think the versatility is fun to play by it self, shifting out of bear to heal yourself, stealthing around, etc.
---
Yeah he tried to act like oh I bought out all the cloth so that’s why it must have flagged me. Nah it flagged you because you suddenly had 1000 more gold on your account overnight.
---
Didn’t you know instance portalsare like stargates. They are actually wormhole to a far away land. That ally is about 50 bajillion light years away.
---
Tried that. Didn’t work
---
Lol poor fella
---
I use discord but mumble is still updated. It isn't like any archaic software or something. I think disc is more convenient tho with many servers.
---
How long did this take? A run taking over three hours can become unbearable.
---
I'm interested to see if I can get away with 1/29/21 when honor system comes in heh. My healing gear is quite good, I feel like that's more important than most of the talents.
---
Ahh, okay thanks - that got completely glossed over with the Felcloth Gloves being the headliner for DM release.
---
Yeah we realized that after but knowing it's classic I wasn't sure at first.
---
Yeah lots of offhand attacks at level 11 mate
---
Correct or received a mage port
---
Thanks for the tips!  I figured out most of these but there’s still a ton of info on the class to learn as a new hunter!
---
Yep. There are only two reasons you "need" rogues: BWL suppression room, and soaking their tier gear drops.
---
You don't need rogues at all from AQ onward; they're fully replaced by fury warriors.
---
You need a lot of gear to do Rotgrip but princess should be easy if you have decent gear.
---
Someone around here claimed that Classic is broken and buggy as hell, and private servers are better.
---
Uh.....no, private servers are a million times more buggy than Classic. Just because there's a few bugs and glitches in Classic doesn't mean that emulated pirate servers are better.
---
Have they considered using the Eastern entrance to DM East? At Lariss Pavilion, North of Camp Mojache.
---
Meh, the pvp is not engaging when you are sheeping enemy faction members to heal them and also grieving members of your same faction the whole time.
---
Thats the thing. You claim the mafia is for fun pvp times, but when it comes time to pvp, its just scummy tactics that aren't available to people who don't no life collude with the other faction. It was the same on every private server.
---
The actual pvp was fun at times, but the reality is you aren't going to contest without bringing tons of people or colluding yourself. 
---
And none of you ever 1v1 in pvp.
---
That's *very* different than your original insistence that the level gap would keep getting bigger unless you played without him.
---
Also, since the amount of time you'd be spending at the same level as him would keep increasing the difference in xp would end up being significantly less than 4%, and it would probably even be theoretically possible to catch up to him completely since quest turn-ins that get you to the next level give the full xp for the previous level but the overflow counts towards the next.
---
Rogues don't fight fair
---
I am a firm believer in what you enter the dungeon as is the loot you ought to need. If no one else 'needs' then you can ask and take it home with you, but it irks me when people do as you described.
---
We got the book drop from 2nd boss on our 1st run of DM west last night! We gave it to our guild main tank on Shazzrath

---
Downranking heals while leveling is not a good idea. The higher ranks are more mana efficient.
---
Honestly there is very little “honor” in PvP. Every time I go to BRM the horde outnumber the alliance so heavily that I haven’t a single chance. Maybe I can kill one, but when it’s usually a 5:1 ratio I’m lucky to make it to any instance with less than two deaths. 
---
World PvP is almost never a balanced approach because there are too many factors. You could only get some level of balance if it’s a organized event.
---
I think all of you guys should quit right now... what will they do make another guild with the 10 of them. You guys are outnumbering the council just make your own guild
---
&gt; Yes. I'm not saying DOT every trash mob. But if you throw a curse of agony out on the main target, maybe a corruption, shadow bolt... you've done your job for that mob. You can throw siphon life on some other targets and life tap away.
---
To me, that just feels like I'm barely playing at that point. Everybody's opinion is different on that though.
---
As someone who has tanked a lot in both pservers and retail for over a decade, I'm confident in saying it's not just an opinion. Unless you have a very tight knit group of players that are used to playing with each other, you'll spend less time in an instance and cause less stress on your healer and tank by making smart pulls and dpsing intelligently rather than trying to just mash out big numbers
---
Everyone talks about shield wall this and shield wall that. That shit has 30mins cd.
---
Is it a bad thing that after 5+ years of nullsec Eve Online I find the Devilsaur Mafia griefing quite tame and somewhat amusing?
---
Nice job.  Just remember that the majority of gankers have no honor and will jump at any chance.  Disc priests are extremely resilience in 1v1 and I've stymied many a ganker.  I don't start fights with people who want to leave me alone.  I don't engage in situations where I am outclassed.  But I can utterly waste your time by stretching a short gank into a long affair that risks it backfiring on you majorly.
---
Like the time I was running to Tarren Mill after a quest in Alterac.  A 40+ paladin tries to start something.  A level 60 orc warrior just appears and wrecks their day.  Funny how honor works out sometimes.
---
Yeah if you fly from Ratchet to anywhere north of Ratchet you first have to fly to Theramore, fly *back* to Ratchet; close enough to glare at the flight path goblin while he doesn't even glance up from counting your 17s, *then* carry on northward.
---
It's... well it's something.
---
I get brought into 5 mans all the time as Shadow, it's only on Mage/Lock AoE farming groups where I either have to skip or get used for PWS.
---
You can create macros for your common abilities, including your opener. The macro will be:
---
    /startattack
---
    /cast ability-goes-here
---
This will start your auto-attacking when you use those abilities, allowing you to use any targeting system (left click, tab targeting, assisting).
---
Not really. It's regularly updated and has more voice features.
---
If you play anything that requires more than a basic voice call it's incredibly useful. Any EVE player can testify, and I suspect ARMA and other games benefit from the complexity offered.
---
&gt; Also, shame on you hunters who take HoJ from melee
---
For Alliance Hunters, HoJ is still the best trinket you can get before raids. At least it was before Dire Maul was released. Its a dick move since melee get way more from it than Hunters, but its still the best you can get.
---
Is there a way to setup either of those to make it to where when you press Shift + 1, or 2, or 3 (etc), that it changes to another bar?
---
This is how I currently play, and I know in retail, I couldn't find ways to change it to my playstyle when I downloaded EvilUI. Or I couldn't figure it out. I was wondering if that was something I could do in the Classic versions.
---
Yeah good one bud
---
You can do wrath builds, wrath is nature damage, so is hurricane.
---
Prat! :)
---
Pretty sure I never said that the level gap would keep getting bigger.
---
Literally gimping your raid team by taking BRE
---
Ugh minimum lol this dude knows how to enjoy life to the fullest. You know there is this mobile game where you have auto questing right? You don't have to do anything but open rewards you get from just looking at auto-questing. Gives u dopamine as reward for ur time.  You should try it
---
There is always a lava run.  Just look up lava run tutorial on youtube.  And yes, many people are very efficient about whats worth doing and whats not.  Many people skip bosses along the way.  It just depends on what's worth it to the group, what level everyone is, and what quests people are focusing on.
---
That’s pretty insane, I must be underestimating the number of trolls that are capable of rallying under a trolly flag
---
Lot of bosses drop bop greens in DM. It’s kinda weird for non-consumables/keys, but it exists.
---
Didnt notice till I started leveling my rogue the other day even though I ran to the shaman trained god knows how many times :facepalm:
---
Well in pug raids, it’s almost always a standard that you get gear for the role you are filling. There’s often too much competition, the items too valuable, to mess around with convoluted loot rules. Unless you make the group yourself and people are okay with the loot reservations (usually for MC, they are only cool with bindings and boe crafting mats bring reserved).
---
Maybe I'm just assuming I'll be struggling with threat at the later levels more than will actually be the case lol. I admittedly haven't played endgame content in vanilla before. But it seems nobody thinks points in prot are necessary, so I'll stick to fury after MS. Thanks for the input!
---
Not always, knowing the bug exists you know to instantly apply heroic strike instead of just random time before auto.
---
It would be insane RNG and not very repeatable. Literally depends on who gets pulled into the room.
---
I play Starcraft on my other monitor
---
I’m in Leduc now. It does.
---
Yeah probably the most common guild name
---
They actually SHRANK him for WoW. Dude was like 18 feet tall IRL.
---
Incendius hasn't had a queue for quite awhile except for last night because of the release of Dire Maul but it was less than 10 minutes for me.
---
BUT WHAT DOES WARLOCK DO!?!
---
Some morons argue that by removing the debuff limit all content will be trivial.
---
And also be able to whirlwind and bloodthirst on cooldown?
---
60min runs wut, pug 30-40min runs very easily without mage aoe for the larger pulls
---
Totally. I no-lifed the first week with an irl buddy. One of the best gamer moments I’ve had, especially for a launch week. The cool thing about WoW too is if you’re on earlier or longer than your friend you can just work on professions or organize your shit
---
I usually just watch an episode if some series while travelling... pausing when I arrive and resuming on next flight... or do some work but thats rarer :p
---
Honestly the dynamic is so different because of how educated most players are now. I don't see a big change on prices worthy of an investment.
---
Ppl outweigh the time it costs to form their own/a new group and get everybody there vs the hassle of the current run. Usually acting on your principles just isn't worth the time it'll take
---
If you're doing it in places like gadgetzan where the guards can't stop you from pvping like they're supposed to. Then it's bannable, but doing it out in the open world? I don't believe so.
---
It's not like we aren't questing or having the quest done for us. Sometimes it just isn't fun to wander around for 30 mins trying to find that one cave that the year log vaguely describes as "Southwest of the river"
---
Then you couldn't see how tall he is
---
Thanks. Yea recount is perfect for my needs, I mainly only want to know if i'm pulling my weight.
---
all of the devil leather on the server comes from un goro.
---
Yet here you are on Reddit, notching about them not letting you play a certain spec
---
Ssssh dont tell blizzard..
---
I'm Horde on Incendius. It's been great so far. It's extremely active and I see lots of both Horde and Alliance everywhere.
---
I've fucked enough warriors already buddy I can fuck some more. Oh noes they can trinket out of my stun oh no what will I ever do
---
Ewwww Welland...
---
There is no difference  between pursuit of justice and minor speed on boots fyi
---
Yeah that’s bs if people were doing that to me I’d pull the whole “I’m gonna roll on +healing gear just in case one day” and promptly vendor it.
---
People keep trying to push the VC for deadmines thing...but it wasn't a thing on a lot of servers.
---
Is this coming from the private server community?
---
Ohhh, this explains why the runs last so long. It's because if you reserve the Orbs... you're going to get worthless garbage players coming to your runs. Well enjoy that cancer, anyone with an ounce of self respect wouldn't take part in it.
---
Haha, I checked his/her previous posts and yes, it’s all shit that can be googled.
---
Yup, and not everyone contributes towards guild repair but everyone benefits from it. Fair, right?
---
By tag wars I mean skin wars too yeah. It's the same thing, pressing a button fast.
---
Got wrongly banned for selling names on retail a while back. Not against ToS and the gm was mad at me for doing it and told me to stop and acted upset he had to unban me. Luckily I read the rules.
---
Hold control and click on items you want to try on if that's what you mean. That can be done with anything linked in chat though not just Atlas loot
---
No of course not lol. Even 8 slot bags would be more than enough! The early bag slog is just too much for me.
---
in a really deep voice
---
I heard you could be banned for fishing in STV after phase 2. Against the EULA.
---
What was it?
---
there's no point in arguing on reddit. on this site capitalism is bad and akin to slavery.
---
Wrong.
---
I'm horde.
---
Except it does.  That's the difference between getting the chest and not.  Those are complete opposite results.
---
Server is Thunderfury.
---
Where does the aspect of downranking your spells factor into this discussion? What I mean is, if you have a lot of +healing could you in theory downrank at a greater degree and artificially conserve your Mana that way?
---
There is no way I was even spending 500g a raid to do do AQ or Naxx. People will be ableTo do AQ with zero consumes having difficulty with the end bosses. Very few guilds in general with beat 4 horsemen, sapphiron or kel thuzad regardless of spending 1500g a raid. Those amount of consumes are hilarious.
---
Yeah that doesnt make sense ^
---
I just got the game after not playing for over 10 years and this is quickly becoming my problem as well. I read about everyone talking about each class and how fun it is and it makes me want one of every class but I know I just need to focus on a main. I just can’t decide which I want to be my main.
---
That’s solid! Enjoy the last bit of the level grind 🤙🏻
---
I think it's the case on most servers, priests and healers in general are much more popular than they were in vanilla.
---
\&gt; This is illegal
---
Go away
---
The old UI is kinda tedious. I'd recommend Move Anything and keybind being able to move your UI on the fly with one press on your keyboard. And Titan panel so u can hide sertain things like the time in combination with Move Anything. Move anything I'd say is required. If you find something old or you have an insane screen ratio for example, adjust it 😁
---
Pornhub
---
only bad rogues lose to warriors.
---
I'm a Hunter, but I kite Rotgrip all the way up to the Princess area. Takes about 8 minutes to kill him.
---
If you use this method you have to be careful not to aggro a Hydra. Hunters can constantly concussion shot the Hydra and then feign death after Rotgrip is killed, but 'locks can't.
---
&gt;  Doesn't Cheetah let you auto attack quite often?
---
It lets you auto attack once per circle.
---
So you're on Incendious too?
---
He really is. It’s sad bragging about dps. Like it requires some extensive effort or knowledge to be good at it with the meta pve classes in phase 1
---
Well then they deserve to have this happen to them. They are effectively condoning it and only contributing to the problem.
---
Solid guide.
---
the reddit neckbeard stereotype exists for a reason. it's not just this sub
---
None of them was clear of these stealthy aggro mobs so how do I stealth through lol
---
WE. AIN'T. GOT. NO LIFEEEEE.
---
By chance what server do you play on?
---
If they’re way below level I’ll toss a curse of tongues on them and carry on, just to let them know. Bonus points if they’re a warrior or rogue
---
Yup, bought those for my spoiled alt
---
If you have enough rage to heroic strike every main hand attack and also use your other abilities on cd, theres no reason to ever cancel heroic strike.
---
May no gnome go unpunted
---
&gt; Its really a get good kinda thing.
---
Then proceeds to tell me how killing her takes ages making killing her an absolute waste of time.
---
"bad tank" - share to explain how you gonna get enough rage to apply 4 armor sunders (2 on main target 1 on each enemy of a group) in 6 seconds? Just kick the fire mage and get an actual one would be my solution.
---
There are several big check points for an aspiring fury warrior. You need to complete these, in my opinion, to justify your raid spot because you can do them without begging your guild for help. I'll go so far as to say that I have some contempt for those warriors who have not gone through this rite of passage, because back in vanilla it was much harder to get a raid spot as dps warrior. 1. Get your devilsaur set made. 2. Get your gladiator chest from BRD. 3. Get your lionheart made. Do these three things asap and you will get some mad respect from your raid leaders.
---
They don't do it to the one you marked, you know they only ever do it to the one in the pack you havent even attack yet.
---
Stretch!
---
Get a little routine like you had at the start of gym classes, they only take 5-10 mins depending on you.
---
Not doing it for experience. I'm not in a rush to get to 60 and have multiple alts. There's a few reasons - helping out lower level friends and also getting some greens to level enchanting (I just picked it up on an alt).
---
That's my thinking. Dps is so much higher, bosses die faster etc.
---
Whatw is healer addon? Im a healer and dont use even any macros xD
---
If nothing else, thunderfury is more than enough reason for any guild to do Mc. Even if that guild is clearing naxx. Not to mention how stupidly quick it gets them all sorts of mats that can be sold for easy profit and fuel the naxx grind
---
What was the gap between original release and TBC release? 3 years? I bet we get 2 years of classic before TBC servers are made available. I’d also bet they keep enough classic servers and let us character copy/transfer to the new TBC servers.
---
If it thinks like a dick, acts like a dick, and thinks it sees dicks everywhere. It’s probably a dick.
---
I name my pets things that appear on maps, e.g I had a bear named Aleutian and a wolf named Carpathian.  I tried to name an owl Athens, it wouldn’t let me.  Go figure.
---
Sounds like a great way to get ban-hammered
---
There's also a handy spot on the IF bridge that despawns your pet. I like to jump around on it a lot, and my pet will periodically despawn while doing so.
---
Class. From DnD
---
https://giphy.com/gifs/why-not-both-dont-we-have-3ohfFhG5VDtDTzQv2o
---
More like a casual guild trying to be hardcore, real hardcore guilds don't play this shit.
---
Please let everyone in your group know this ahead of time so you can be removed
---
You wouldn't be competing with rogues, but you're more than worthy of a spot thanks to aspect of the wild, innervate and rebirth.
---
I discovered this not so long ago at like level 15 when I was going to the shaman trainer from the flight master
---
Yesh, if only none of those had no cooldown, and were available every fight.
---
Quick question how much does the Patter: Robes of the Void usually go for on the AH?
---
Couldn't afford my mount till 45 due to constantly needing to upgrade to be able to solo. #WarriorLife
---
you think im gonna shift click ur name see that ur 58 and then compare your gear to the 60 that also whispered me? most people at 60 have better gear than ppl that arent. youre strictly talking about yourself (an exception) and youre missing then point my guy.
---
People didn't have 15 years of game knowledge and were playing on dial-up.
---
That is still respec cost, and 20 point prot is bad and I didn't like it, especially without anger management.
---
I hope it happens but at the rate of everyone leveling there’ll be few lowbies- low zones will be dead zones vice death zones.
---
It’s not just wow, but a large majority of gaming communities utilize discord. Only a few niche communities use anything else.
---
Also, you can easily ignore anything else discord tries to offer besides the comma system. It doesn’t force anything on you. That’s some ultra sensitive shit you got going on.
---
I main ranked MC last night as a bear my build is identical to the one seen above.
---
I've always hated retail's "skip groups" mentality. I still remember during WoD there was this skip in Everbloom (? I think that's the name of it), and every Mythic group demanded it be skipped, but like, 50% of players couldn't get up there to skip it anYWAY so we'd spend (I SHIT YOU NOT) 20 goddamn minutes trying to skip trash that we could have killed in less than five. UGH.
---
Lorti UI
---
shop around or make your own guild
---
yes warriors are needed for raids. But feral druid tanks are pretty good and you can certainly get through MC with exactly 1 prot warrior and a few druid off tanks.
---
We probably won't be at AQ40 till 2021. Since we know well in advance what to expect, people will likely just farm DM or buy them now for cheap, especially with what seems like the current drop rate. As for greater nature protection potions, the mats are cheap, dreamfoil is freaking everywhere and elemental earth is easy to farm. I don't see those being very lucrative to buy now and hold onto for over a year.
---
Indeed haha. Plus people's computers were usually not great. Like the family computer haha. Most people had spell effects down or off so it was tough to tell what exactly was going on too
---
Mankrik
---
This is just what I was looking for, thank you.
---
I got mine today for 15g horde stalagg.
---
I had a mage going on my server and when they were the same level as the "average" bulk of players, trying to AoE grind was awful so I moved to my priest and some other alts. Now that the big bulk is higher level, the spots that were overrun are now usually not too contested. So timing can be a thing, pvp server or not can be an issue, and personal skill/gear can be an issue.  I've never done AoE Grinding prior to classic, I leveled my mage up in TBC so it was much faster than the initial vanilla grind.  So when I started at the hillsbrad fields, well, I had plenty of long runs back from the GY when I goofed up a pull, pulled too much, or a patrol respawned and aggroed while i was mid blizzard.
---
I've gotten the hang of it now, and also have some decent quest/dungeon blues, also getting cone of cold helps shore things up too.  The big thing is knowing where to go for a combination of efficiency, some decent drops to AH/vendor, and enough of them so that respawns cycle fast enough that you're not waiting around with no mobs to kill.  That being said there are a lot of guides out there for letting you know some good spots.
---
I used AAP for awhile but found it too buggy. Try out Limeguide, nice alternative.
---
One of my guild’s tanks is a bear Druid and on our onyxia split runs as long as we give him fear ward he’s a god damn threat god with his manual crowd pummelers.
---
Just discovered this a couple weeks ago, but classic actually is my vanilla so I didn't facepalm too much
---
Thanks! :D
---
Eve Online is a space MMO. Nullsec is the colloquial term for 0.0 security space, an area of the game where no rules or rule enforcing NPCs exist, so only rules that apply are those that players make themselves and are strong enough to enforce. Add to that the fact that the game's TOS are quite lenient (few things short of hacking and trafi g stuff for RL cash are disallowed) and the fact that some stuff in Eve Online tends to be very valuable (hundreds-thousands of $ if sold) and I think you can imagine the scale of griefing and betrayal that went on in there :)
---
What makes it the best?
---
Because they aren't game guides you twat they are there for technical support not answering your stupid questions
---
Eh that’s not entirely true. Overall? Maybe. Certain fights will have crushing blows after MC. And you’ll want a mitigation/stam Druid to absorb 3-4 crushing blows. Some warrior tanks can get 2-3 shot with some crushing blows. It depends on fight and gear. But there’s for sure some situations where you’ll want a Druid MT. The consistent flow of damage makes it easier on the healers to get used to how much damage the Druid tank is taking. For example if a tank pops shield wall and relieves the healers the healers could possibly still think the tank has shield wall up and thus the healers are healing less then all a sudden the tank comes off the shield wall and boom dead.. happens so much.
---
\#boycotdevilsauritems, yeah just don't buy it they will lose their profits and go away
---
No. Stealing tags and skinning someone else's mob has never been against TOS.
---
Is there a resource to tell you the average worth of any given BoE? I got a world drop yesterday that is BIS for tanks, but it doesn't seem to have been on my server's AH before. I want to price it fairly.
---
Unclear if this will be seen, but what is the UI mod that is shown at [2:35](https://youtu.be/iRcYj-w8y0k?t=155)?
---
Insert .u/Stonetear pepperidge farm meme here.
---
Problem is that both Slaghide Gauntlets and Warstrife Leggings are ridiculously good for feral tanks, so you lose a lot of mitigation, whereas Bonering is sorta meh anyway.
---
came here to ask this
---
Druids can't use Polearms yet.
---
Just like you.
---
Should I be judging mobs with SoL or SoW in dungeons? Is it even worth judging at all, or should I just focus on healing?
---
3 if you're a healer
---
hey, you could also summon corpses to the zone entrance after the inevitable wipe!
---
Post on trade chat that you’re a DPS warrior looking for a raiding guild. Don’t join the first one that messages. Keep asking every couple hours until you’ve heard from a few. Ask them all questions, like:
---
1. What is your raiding schedule? Make sure it works for you. 
---
2. What’s your roster look like? Do they need a DPS warrior? If they have 45 and want a few more backups, you won’t get a slot. If they have 10 level 60s they are pugging and will have a hard time. 
---
3. What is their style of raiding? Hardcore, pug friendly, casual/social? Get a sense of compatibility. 
---
You could do the same questions for a tank position but right now most guilds are going to have tanking slots filled.
---
Good to know, thanks
---
Haha! A friend of a friend took this, and you're right.
---
I mean as fucked as someone with ~30% passive dodge is I guess?
---
Yeah thats what its looking like
---
Get that bobber in the right spot!!
---
Could be the spellbatching
---
Or slap on int gear and decurse with 20% more int :) been main tanking a good portion of Mc (I share with warriors so we don't really have one mt) and I feel very useful on any fight where we want to pump DPS. Golemagg is a good example. Just burn him with a manual crowd pummeler and DPS doesn't wait at all.
---
That said, our warrior has much more fr so he gets the glory of mt rag haha
---
No, absolutely not. You will get more xp for killing a higher level mob. A mob with the same level will give 100% XP and a mob that is 1 level higher than you will give 104% XP. It's just smarter to kill mobs that are the same level, because the +1 level mob has more HP and more chance to resist your spells. So the extra 4% is not worth the trouble.
---
An option is to replace it with macros. I have a whole different actionbar when i press alt
---
I have been using GuideLime. You’ll need to download the addon and then specific leveling guides as well (which can be gotten from a github link in the description of the addon on curse forge). 
---
I have been specifically using Bustea’s 1-60 horde guide and I’m level 50 now. Haven’t had any issues, and the addon has an arrow up top similar to AAP.
---
The big difference is that you’ll have a quest window you can scroll through and see future steps and/or past steps you’ve completed
---
When I heal, I appreciate a tank who will tell me not to heal the dps who are being shitty. It sucks, but in the past I've had tanks yell at me for letting DPS die who pulled threat off of them on purpose/were pulling for the tank ("because it doesn't matter just do your job"), so that communication is key.
---
I'll have no issue whispering a tank to say, "Do you want me to let X die the next time they do that?" If they say no, I'll deal with it and heal the fucker, but not to the detriment of the group.
---
great reply, thanks. skinning and LW?
---
Actually they can. I have it learned on my 57 Druid.
---
That's cool! Do you know the patch? I couldn't see an upload date, but I wonder if this was after the Heroic Nerf. If not, boy were we hot garbage. Granted none of us had Kara gear at the time.
---
This is fucking golden. 
---
I absolutely love seeing poopsocks like this trying to swing their dick around only to look a fool.
---
Lol I just recently learned there is an upper level where some trainers are.
---
- former vanilla t2 priest
---
You’ve gotta be kidding or trolling my man. This is phase 1 and a shadowpriest who’s been working on his preraid gear is a very real contender for top overall dps in dungeons and raids.
---
If you’re gonna shit over shadow then aim your sights at something that’s actually true, like some choosing to carry an extra gear set with spirit heavy pieces for dungeons, or how shadow dps doesn’t scale as well as pure dps classes’ dps as everyone gets more raidgear over time.
---
But today your criticism is hilarious and wrong my man
---
Yeah I've covered this multiple times and responded to everything you've said to other people.
---
he had to come up with the perfect comeback...
---
To add on this, Blizzard about a month ago crippled these census add-ons ability to collect data so the information is wildly inaccurate and not at all reliable.
---
Druids cannot use polearms in classic. That being said, The Rockpounder from final boss in Uld is what I'm still using at 56. (2% crit chance, and like 5 strength.)
---
I wish I could be as organized as you lol, I can barely play wow being in the same spot as you, but I'm a mess hehe
---
oh thanks, wasn't aware of the +3
---
Using macros to powershift will cause you to lose LotP and Predatory strikes about every other time. Sometimes that's ok if you need an emergency healthstone to live, but if you don't keep an eye on it you'll be down ~100 ap and a crit aura for a large portion of a fight.
---
I can definitely say it's the shorter route but I'm not so sure it's the fastest considering the dismount. From a mage portal, definitely, but from the bank/inn, I'm not convinced.
---
And here I am just Ambushing Horde who are eating.
---
All kinds of stuff honestly, you need to just go look at all the recipes and things you can make with engi. there’s too many items to pick favorites. At lvl 35 you can learn artisan engi and pick goblin or Gnomish, this opens up a lot of gadgets if you go Gnomish. I would recommend going Gnomish so you can make a Death Ray and Battle Chicken, then if you want you can drop engi and relevel it as Goblin. Death Ray and Battle Chicken are the only two trinkets that are bind on pickup so you have to make them yourself. The other trinkets like mind control cap and the net can be traded.
---
I've never had success with the landing option. I just keep on flying despite swooping down past the fp in gadgetzan
---
Yeah, orbs are only 15-19g on Firemaw-EU.
---
Server must be on the lower pop side of things.
---
Literally wasn’t even talking to you, get with it.
---
Well then that's fair enough, I have misrepresented what I was asking. My bad... at least we got some brain exercises done :P
---
No

As long as someone else is bringing the pumpkin spice rage potion I’m good

Unfortunately there isn't; but you can look for another BOE BIS item and judge accordingly.
---
I ve lost songflower and ony buffs just because you slack doesnt mean the rest of us do.

17-18g.
---
Create the group yourself and don’t invite clothies.
---
More challenges pls!
---
that's a sword ;)
---
On whitemane the markup between mats cost and crafted devilsaur leggings is 60-100 gold, and 20-40 gold for gauntlets, so they are good for making gold even if you don't farm the devilsaur leather, though there is a big up front cost for each piece.  Additionally, Tribal LW can make the Hide of the Wild now that Dire Maul is out which all healers will want.  Also once you get raiding corehound boots and belt.
---
On the other hand Dragonscale has items you will use while leveling but doesn't really have great raiding items.  The 3 piece green scale set is good for mana regeneration but no + healing, and black scale set has ap and fire resist on all, hit at 2 piece, and crit at 3 piece, so you can still wear devilsaur set.  Also Black Dragonscales are likely to spike in price due to warlock epic mount quest being available now.
---
Overall I believe that you want access to Tribal LW at cost the most, either yourself or a friend/guildie.
---
Still wrong without consulting others. What right do you have to claim twice as many possible drops over other people on your group? None. Now if they wanna go with you knowing it’s a competition then that’s their choice.
---
I do. But many players don't know about it.
---
I'm not mad mate, I think you just take this game too seriously lol
---
Gotta use those vacation days somehow as the end of the year approaches. Can only roll over a week's worth.
---
Controlling a resource isn't harassment. 
---
And you can always spirit rez and hearth out. Camping to the point that a GM would step in would be if you are camping them on top of the graveyard and they can't escape, or if you're using a convoluted means to follow them from zone to zone or something. 
---
The only thing being done that's against TOS is the cross-faction collusion.
---
I mean I feel you but I think you kind of hinted at what I was getting it with your statement that 5 mans are more forgiving.  What I'm hearing is that paladins can tank 5 man because holding agro is not as important as it is in raid.  
---
I don't doubt your skills or abilities, I just think its unfortunate they didn't give pally tanks a taunt.
---
Dwarf beard #2 wasn't working out for me anymore.
---
Nopes, afraid not.
---
Dude when will you guys get it through your head that Private servers were more difficult and overturned compared to real vanilla?
---
THREE... noses!?
---
Literally every single pug I have been in when an epic drops someone (never me) says everyone need. The only people that seem to have a problem with this are silly redditors. In the actual game everyone has acted exactly as I have described.
---
Your hypothetical situation was dumb, because not all gear is BOE. If it was, the entire game would be different. 
---
But to give you an example from a game that does have every piece of loot tradeable, in end game raids in runescape if a very valuable item drops (such as tbow, worth 1 billion gold), the party sells it and splits the gold in pugs.
---
If the wow community wants to agree to that collectively, I'm fine with it, but just letting one person get one of the most valuable items in the game just because they happen to be that class is just silly in a pug.
---
You call it ethics, I call it naivete. The vast majority of the time whoever gets it "to use" is just going to sell it anyway.
---
How did they need dire maul?
---
Laughs in RP server
---
Correct!
---
Apparently someone just this week found a way around the change and is able to collect data again bit it's only a matter of time before blizz breaks this as well.

They go out of their way to keep this info private.
---

---
 where from and can they be farmed?
---
I used neutral AHs to buy a snake companion since I can't easily go to Orgrimmar as Alliance to buy it myself.
---
Otherwise there's hardly any good deals on neutral AHs since everything is marked up significantly.
---
Unless you're alliance
---
On one hand Google would absolutely have gotten this search correct.
---
On the other, props to Microsoft for finding 2 addresses for you.
---
* Avoid any loot council guild like the plague. Some of them are good. The good ones are the most competitive, and are pushing progression. They already have full groups. The LC guilds recruiting now, are just some dudes who want to get another 20-35 people together to funnel gear for themselves. Join a guild using SK, LL, DKP, EPGP, or any other system before you join a LC guild.
---
* Don't try to find a guild in game by asking in /trade or something. Ask around to other level 60's, see what guilds they are in, ask if they are recruiting, ask if they know any guilds recruiting. Build up a bit of a report and and test the waters with what guilds might be recruiting, their raid times, their loot allocation rules and see what fits you.
---
* You can also check the official forums, the classic wow discord, your server specific discord, or your server specific subreddit to see if there are any guilds recruiting
---
* Get attuned, and start joining pugs. This will get your foot in the door with a lot of guilds, and at least show that you know what you are doing. A lot of guilds running pugs are still trying to flesh out their raid teams, so if you like them, ask them if they are recruiting.
---
* Yes, people will need warriors, they are top melee dps and the only tanks in the game. Whether or not you'll even be offered a tank spot will be heavily dependent on what guild you join; there are more DPS spots available compared to tanks and main tanking raids is kind of a whole 'nother issue.
---
* Farm your BiS as soon as possible, as a tank you can basically make/join groups at your own pace so it shouldn't be *too* hard but there's a lot of pretty rare items like HoJ that you'll be expected to get so you should get on that as soon as possible.
---
The issue is it's not like MC where only the tank should be getting hit. Huhuran poisons the closest 15 players to her at 30%. Even on pservers they stacked nature resistance because it would do 1500-2500 damage every 5 seconds otherwise, and having nearly half your dps drop like flies doesn't help with dpsing her down since the tank is also taking high damage and would OOM your healers quickly.
---
yeah right :/. When phase 2 comes though.  I'm set for pvp ;)
---
I tanked a lot when I first hit 60, and of course on the way to 60, but that was a month ago. In a week I had 90% of my pre raid bis and just helped gear my guildies. I did A LOT of that, and it gets old fast. Now, I have no reason to run dungeons - i've had full pre raid bis for weeks. Other people are running dungeons to get gear, to improve themselves. I could improve myself too, by getting the gold or materials (which can be bought with gold) to get a Lionheart helmet for instance, for much better threat. Running dungeons for random pugs doesn't do that efficiently though. I can't count how many "attunement" runs I've done in BRD and helped with world dragon Ony attunement, running UBRS, etc. I've done this stuff so much that I have full bis fury gear as well as prot. At this point I'm just leveling an alt to make more gold.
---
Nothing wrong with being proud
---
Leatrix plus
---
"forever ago" okay...
---
Uldaman get [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9408/ironshod-bludgeon)
---
Yea there's that if you enjoy bad gameplay with nothing tangible on the line, that's more power to you. 
---
UO had bad gameplay, but at least you could loot the other guys corpse.
---
PS:BFA war mode is way more interesting than this.
---
I had the opposite result when I MC'd. I was in the Zanzil zombie area of ST and MC'd a player into a group of 4-5, when MC broke they all ran to me. I know MC has a lot of threat on it, not sure how that interaction works.
---
Do you happen to know how to access the settings and which setting this is?  I believe I have it installed but have no idea where that option is.
---
who still watches cable television?........
---
Not if the server has no demand for flasks, and judging by the 5g price, there isn't. That's a very bad sign for the server.
---
Might be rude but it isn't against any rules to need on any type of gear unless any rules where stated before.
---
If you Life tap in combat: I’ll heal you, but not before the tank. Be conscious of how low you tap; use bandage if applicable. 
---
If you tap out of combat: you can sit and eat like the rest of us. If I can drink, then your stupid warlock ass can eat. 
---
Because of this massive discrepancy of how healers should interact with warlock life taps and different views; I no longer group with warlocks in 5 mans.
---
I've gone through like 2 stacks of food to get mine back up to level 3... This is the only pretty I've used since level 10.
---
No addons until level 20. Just practice learning the game.
---
Then questie and vendor price and everything else you can think of.
---
Word on the Reddit street was to farm the 2h Mace from the robot boss in Gnomeregan. It has a use (5 charges) supposedly making it the BiS weapon for feral druids through MC.
---
It is not a unique item, so the claim is, you can farm several of them for boss encounters/raiding etc.
---
Truth? No idea. But reddit saidit, so it's gotta be true, right?
---
Sincerely,

A French Model.
---
Most of the LFG chat is for BRD, Ulda, and SM.
---
So you're in the zone.
---
I can tell his action bar is Bartender4 and his character portrait is ShadowUI. Not sure what his raid frames are but i use ZPerl and have aomething similar.
---
You should only need grounding totem on that fight
---
Salvation definitely helps warriors achieve higher dps but threat is still going to be a factor regardless. Good threat management is what allows you to achieve your maximum potential and warriors just do not have any tools for managing threat. 30% less threat from Salvation is definitely going to help but in the later stages of the game, AQ40 and Naxx, your potential dps vs actual dps is extremely dependent on how good your tank threat is. Rogues never have this issue and can blast from 3 sunders on and never have to look at the threat meter again.
---
Definitely find a better guild. They sound like such tools. As you mentioned, no content is hard anymore and there is no reason to be an overbearing mincromanager
---
Maybe dont play on the streamer server
---
INVITE TO ASMON LAYER!
---
Rude, extremely. It’s agreed upon that if I enter as a cloth wearing person I will not need plate that drops. But there is no “rule” that says I can’t either.
---
I love helping out people in WoW. It makes me feel good. I'll go stand in low leveled zones and trade randoms water and food. I'll help people with quests. I finish off mobs if I'm running by and see a player struggling (Horde or Alliance). I enjoy dungeons and so I'd probably tank those, too. Just for fun. To help others.
---
But there comes a point where I'd rather just 'help' in other ways, honestly. Handing out free Good Bags to lowbies is a lot less time consuming and nothing bad happens ever. Tanking? The dungeon takes ten times longer than it should; people drop group; people get pissed because they didn't win the loot; people pull for you; healer might suck; dps are assholes -- the list goes on.
---
So I feel like being charitable is fun in-game, but it's more fun when it actually feels rewarding and people appreciate you for what you're doing. I feel like tanks are oftentimes underappreciated...and feel it.
---
If our ancestors saw that we handed money to people that don't work because they would rather play video games they would stop procreating and let us die off.
---
Is there an addon which shows quests in each zone or at least rewards from it? Basiclly AtlasLoot but for quests?
---
I was reading at my level (35) soloing SFK might be a good idea.
---
I came upon a most peculiar sight as i entered Orgrimmar today
---
I’ll test when I get home.
---
I kill every warrior I see because every warrior I see that is red or ?? Immediately tries to gank me, so I'm just paying it forward.
---
I hit 40 and I haven't logged on in like 5 days.
---
Up to this point I have been following a really good guide on youtube, but with how little I get to play it is starting to be a little annoying. Some stretches in the guide require you to go an hour or two before heading back to an Inn. This sucks if I can only play for 40 mins real quick.
---
I have started thinking maybe I should forget the guide, park my toon in an inn that is close to a good grind spot so that I can get on, mindlessly kill crap until I have to log off. That way every second I am on I am gaining experience.
---
Thoughts on that?
---
When I first started to read the title, I was excited that shamans had a gold farming thread. Then I read the rest of the title... :(
---
Can you train them indefinitely?
---
I'll cut to the chase here.
---
If you want best in slot, you're going to have to farm Gnomer for the Manual Crowd Pummeler. "Serious" feral dps will spend 3-4 hours every week farming 15 of these every week in order to cheese their cat from DPS.
---
Kinda confused over how pet training works in classic, I’ve been reading guides but they tend to skip over this part.
---
From what I understand you have a limited amount of trainer points so must use them wisely and pets can only have 4 abilities.
---
Say I have a wind serpent, I should use trainer points to train 4 abilities let’s say bite, Lightning, growl, dive.
---
But some abilities I would need to tame a new pet to learn, so for example lightning rank 2, I would tame a new wind serpent, learn it then use trainer points to teach it to my original wind serpent.
---
Do I need to use trainer points for things I learn at the pet trainer like increased stamina?
---
I’m just really confused on how best to level and train pets.
---
To avoid confusion, I always specify that I'm looking for a group to do battle on the Underground Buccaneer Revenge Ship (UBRS). Those Defias boys must've really pissed people off, because I even get level 60s wanting to join!
---
I can't imagine a moonkin would have issues with mana on anything but rag, maybe majordomo? Fights last such a short amount of time
---
It is the most drama-inducing system because it is not an objective, pre-set rules driven system. That's pretty hard to argue. Drama has killed far, far more guilds than boss mechanics, loot droughts, or general apathy ever has. Therefore, LC is the worst system because it is the worst offender of the biggest guild killer.
---
You can *say* that all it takes is to trust the LC... But all it takes is one particularly egregious drop to throw the whole thing into disarray. With every single drop, and especially if a certain group is experiencing a drought, *someone* is gonna feel snubbed. If you have a loot rules system to point to, you can alleviate a lot of the blame and feelsbads.
---
Haha that ones a weirdo. I'd stay away from them.
---
"Elitist"
---
On the slow-hitting bosses where shield block is up 100% off the time, one would not encounter the unavoidably dead bear unless the healers are sleeping.   
---
There are specific bosses that are a problem, though. IIRC, tanking four horsemen was rough. A resisted taunt was awful, and druids have a long CD on their aoe taunt. We still used a couple of druids because of the sheer number of tanks required, but I recall dying there more than a few times. And, obviously, cat class call for nef was a problem.
---
100% NOT browsing Reddit in light mode!
---
I can only assume you're a child seeing as how big of a tantrum you're throwing and how upset you are, on top of the name callings. Why didn't either of those people resolve the issue with Blizzard? Instead they publicly made them look bad and Blizzard decided that they'd rather unban the people to avoid the bad look in those situations. See how that works?
---
haha lmao
---
No I don't think he's impossible. People had no clue what they were doing you can see that on naxx videos too
---
&gt;  **Basically, every 60 seconds the encounter required your raid to do roughly 230,000 damage** 
---
Raid of 25 dps with 5 unavailable, that's 20 dps needing to do 3.83k dps total meaning 191 dps, yeah that's completely mathematiclaly impossible. would love to see some of that math instead of people just saying iTS iMPOiSBBLE!!!!!
---
me, dropped after Cata, played since BC, but this is a special time for me
---
Dude you’re like 24 hours late to the party at this point.
---
Get some friends. Wow is a MMO. Either many people are outraged by the Mafia and you should have no trouble overwhelming them, or people aren't really that outraged.
---
71% armor? But I keep hearing that Druids can't mitigate\****anything\**** !!
---
Cast dots and wand until you get imp drain life and then you do that instead.
---
As a mage in classic, i also keep my hearth in Gadget, gives good fly paths all around from the bottom side of Kalimdor.
---
Good luck with that... too many 12 year olds running around who think it's fun to one or two-shot someone 15 levels below them.  I was questing in Tanaris the other night solo (level 46 Warlock) and while fighting a mob I was ganked by a group of three (?? Mage, 46 Priest and 41 Warrior).  So honorable.
---
I also can't count the number of times on a the BB to Theramore boat also that a ?? Rogue or ?? Warrior feels like it is fun to two-shot a clothie who is peacefully sitting there on their horse.  So yeah - it's great to think people are being "honorable" but reality is there are a bunch of small-minded kids/adults (sadly) running around who think that is what PVP is.
---
Yeah I've gotten it up to a base 5.8k rn, extra 500 w the int boost. And extra 150 with the food consumable
---
Starting at 40 you get Shadowform on Priest and that makes it more fun to play solo. Give that a try, you'll probably like it.
---
" Out of all the herbs I’ve sent to GL (making nothing in return) I asked  for a fire pot last night (I used 3 during the whole raid) and he told  me 2g "  
---
 This was you hint to leave the second hint was when they were so busy micromanaging a healers individual moves they forgot to do their job in regards to basic fight mechanics, these guys sound like trash players who over compensate by demanding everyone do exactly what they say 100% of the time.
---
:(
---
Could you explain this further?
---
So my current setup is somewhat archaic, but it's what I feel comfortable with:
---
I have my standard bar with hotkeys 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Q (in place of 6), E (in place of 7), MB 4 (in place of 8), and MB 5 (in place of 9). I use these hotkeys for a specific set of functions in combat.
---
When I hit Shift + 2, it goes to a fresh hotbar with different actions on it, but the same keybinds. Same with Shifts 3 and 4.
---
Essentially, I only use 9 keys four different times each, picking each page of action bars according to what I want using the Shift and 1-4 keys.
---
I'm wanting this setup with a new action bar addon (I tried this with Evil UI in retail and it wasn't defaulted to it, and I tried it with Bartender in Classic, but it wasn't defaulted to this behavior). I have very limited time to play, so spending 40 minutes trying to configure my keybinding BACK to the way I like it after downloading a new addon seems like a poor use of my time.
---
They absolutely can maintank raids, save for a specific couple of bosses.
---
I see i forgot to blank out my name in the item itself, but this is dying so it doesn't matter.
---
msg me and i'll send u grindstones.
---
Lol what realm is this?
---
Yeah you’re right, I was misremembering this https://reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b3zl5n/efficiency_of_killing_mobs_of_a_higher_level/
---
oh well.
---
Ya
---
Tell me, who is likely to be competing with me for leather tank gear? Am I stealing possible vendor money from them by needing gear no one else in the game uses? 
---
I don't take rogue / warrior leather because I'd have to respec to make use of it. It's pretty simple. 
---
The vast majority of people understand the predicament of being a druid and are just thankful for a competent tank. I have not been in a single pug that was surprised a druid tank also needs healing gear. 
---
It's not wrong; it's how we have to get by in a comically unbalanced game.
---
Yea yeah, I know what you mean, but I do not have a version without the edges/frame. i'm sorry.
---
It's only worth it if ur gonna make ur money back in respec plus
---
I have definitely seen other posts in this sub about mobs aggroing people for threat even when that threat shouldn't be transferred.  I feel like someone mentioned that threat works slightly different from how it was in vanilla because of other stuff they did when prepping classic.  No source on this unfortunately so just take it as speculation.  
---
That being said, my anecdotal experience from vanilla vs classic, I remember watching people run by with aggro, and being able to heal or buff myself without drawing aggro from the resetting mobs.  However in classic if someone runs by me with my renew ticking away, they generally come back and attack me later.  I know that if I heal the person running away I'm on their threat table, but I feel like in vanilla so long as I didn't affect the mobs or the person who was aggrod while they ran by, they would reset as normal and not try to attack me.  It has been 15 years though...
---
I got it first run, i am blessed... However i did do SM about 13 times till i got Illusionary Rod.
---
To be fair, tanking can be stressful and very unrewarding to some people.
---
Nice, you and the other guy named the same addon. Did you solely use it 1-50?
---
How often are you playing? 22 hours of rested exp is something like 10 kills at double exp. if its worth the trek back and forth to the inn then sure. If you only play every 48 hours or longer then maybe yeah park at a INN or capital city.
---
Nice. That means I can keep my WoW sub then.
---
Literally organized crime on an MMO, I love it!
---
Nah, firefin and oily blackmouth sell like crap.  5s-10s per fish, 5 max fish per pool, 30 second cast time for fishing pole, plus travel time between pools.  You're better off just farming gorillas.
---
Because: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol-SAWurTxY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol-SAWurTxY) 
---
And i was on my way to BB to get that quest reward for the plate boots.
---
Pvping through reports is just as legit and within the rules as collusion, even the slightest misstep of the tos will(and should) get people like yourself and unbind mass reported
---
You just changed your stance saying you are going in a tank. I expect a tank to take tank leathers. I’m saying you shouldn’t snipe other gear for your off spec if someone else in your group needs it and is in spec.
---
Did you miss the part about setting up camps at the spirit ressers too?
---
My rogue is currently 53. I have only ever played rogue since day 1 of wow over a decade ago. I can't play anything else.
---
I am biased, but rogue is just so much fun.
---
Someone seems to have downvoted you, but I’ve got no idea why.
---
This is a very common strategy, and many new tanks don’t realise they can/should let their dps burn down a squishy.
---
The one (small) down side is that it can contribute to the “go go go” mentality.   The dps have to have the sense not to go all-out if/when skull isn’t a squishy.
---
Is there a guide on how to Duo DM Tribute runs with Rogue / Druid?  If stealth doesn't work due to increased mob detection wouldn't the same problems exist on classic?  This was my plan with my Rogue friend but I am a little worried now.
---
Black mageweave is the correct answer
---
Can confirm. Also make sure you’re doing repeatable quests like the one in desolace for the shrimp cages. I went from 30 to 40g in about 40 minutes.
---
Questie does that and a lot more. Theres Autopilot as well. I will often go to wowhead and use the zone map to show where a lot of quest givers are and then run there to start in a new zone.
---
What professions should my rogue have? Currently have Herbalism and Alchemy- I like herbalism to be able to pick my own fadeleaf and swiftthistle. 
---
Should I switch one or both to engineering and mining?  Being able to craft bombs and some gear seems more practical and fun from an RP perspective.
---
Sadly its not against the rules anymore
---
If you cant hold aggro against a mage casting Pyroblast 6 seconds into the fight on your target then you're doing something wrong and probably not holding aggro against the other dps anyways. It's far less threat than if they cast 2 fireballs.
---
I'm at work for the next 8 hours. It's like enable portrait elite frames or some shit.
---
Wow that’s actually impressive
---
Just grab the Atlas Loot add-on and have a look.

I may not be the fastest leveler but that is due to a number of factors other than the class, but leveling as a warrior is a breeze with one simple trick.......
---
tank dungeons non stop
---
Since hitting deadmines at most I have quested for half a level, typically I only quest to get dungeon quests the first time i move up into a new dungeon.  I'm entering Mara now and rocking the best blues ZF and Ulda have to offer.  I've also made a ton of dps and healer friends along the way so I can usually fill at least 3 spots of my group with someone I know can play their role well.
---
Great advice, didn't think about the ranged weapon. Thanks man. How did you come across weapons early on? Everything is trash.
---
Access by clicking the leatrix icon on your map
---
I am using the 30/0/21 spec. It’s awesome, I can heal and dps in dungeons. I’m level 51 right now.
---
Haha, true that. Like an island all for there own to keep their shit for themselves
---
Again, this has all been covered.
---
Druids in full healing gear are actually very strong in PvP ironically.
---
it will reduce theyre experience gained i believe.
---
Y'all must have missed the couple threads over the past 3 weeks explaining why everyone needs high value BoEs.
---
It's the majority consensus on reddit for everyone to need on all high value (~25G+) items.
---
Thats why I'm asking how the gph is. if its a steady 30gph with the chance more, I could do it for a few hours and have plenty of extra gold. If it's 30gph max I'll just get a guild group and do it up.
---
Level appropriate cloth helms.
---
And explosives.  Lots and lots of explosives.
---
Fuck you and your bags what the fuck.
---
I played about 40 hours this weekend, so I don't think it's that out of the question.
---
Pop potion.
---
Enemies run.
---
Pop challenging shout. They attack for the duration of invincibility. Continue spreading threat during this time.
---
When your invincibility drops begin hammering taunts and threat building to maintain aggro.
---
Bear tanks FTW
---
Never use Viper on Warriors, it costs you mana and does nothing to them
---
Scorpid/Serpent situationally, but stings arent as straightforward against melee.
---
If you see a blue bar, Viper is rarely a bad move.
---
Also the quiver bug.
---
"LOL my quiver is a FISHING ROD!!!"
---
"Just me chillin, leveling up my quiver skill!"
---
"I saw this crazy bug that LITERALLY NO ONE has ever seen before!"
---
Like we get it, literally every hunter sees this bug like 4 times per level, it happens all the time; let's move on, it isn't funny.
---
Specifically now when people still treat the game like its retail threat. People dotting or hitting mobs when I'm trying to LOS shit behind walls before I even have a second to get rage to get a sunder off, or before I even get into melee with it, which causes me to have to burn a taunt to get it back, so I behind on the threat on the other mobs, so the healer pulls threat from the shit I haven't gotten to touch yet... I'm a good tank. I just don't have the patience for people who should know this shit by now.
---
All I said was rogues were better than ferals and the entire subreddit of delusional ferals attacked me.
---
For the love of god use screen capture!!!
---
/s
---
Confirmed by blizz to not be a bug.
---
Yellow attack hitcap is 9%.
---
White attack hitcap is 27%
---
Because you have the spell queued, it treats the offhand as a yellow hit, therefore, the 9% hitcap is used.
---
Still pretty damn good for your lock, too.  I ran ZF 15-20 times trying to get that cane as an upgrade to Staff of the Shade and it didn't drop a single time.  I'm level 54 now and I still kind of want to try again.
---
Very unrewarding?
---
 "I'll tank for first orb reserve", and "only tank for reserve on all unwanted gear" -Classic Tanks
---
My internet broke last night during ubrs and my mobil hotspot worked perfectly lol. Didnt think the game would run, but sure enough everything was smooth lol.
---
I mean the general context is still the same, either enchant will help you in some way or the other
---
Not sure who shit in all your weetabix this morning but fuck me 😂
---
I’ve been going back and forth between rogue and warrior since vanilla. A good rogue is always gonna clap them cheeks.
---
I'm playing on a 5 year old laptop that cost 500$ brand new.
---
I was so worried about buying a new laptop as well, luckily i held off.
---
 CTRL + ALT + Print  Screen = captures only the active window.  You can resize your browser window to only contain the relevant information and use that command to take a screenshot of only the now smaller window.
---
NERF!
---
I honestly feel this way too - never played WoW before this. I've been grinding hard to 60. I have about 9 days played and I'm currently at level 52. 
---
But I have been sort of dreading getting to 60 because the Endgame stuff seems intimidating. I am definitely a casual because there is just so much about the game and raiding that overwhelms me or I just don't understand and I know that raids can get intense.
---
I definitely want to give it a try eventually just to say I've done it, but I almost feel like I'd enjoy creating an Alt and starting over rather than get to 60.
---
Bing isn't a web browser, though.
---
My guild has a shadow priest in the top 5 dps, and on certain MC boss fights they top the damage meters.
---
The disdain for shadow priests comes from two things: on very long fights and speed runs they will go oom sooner than the mages (and ofc warlocks have life tap), and in later raids they aren't allowed to use SW:P so they just straight up lose 20% of their damage.
---
True. So your saying if I am nowhere near an inn, I could just log out in the middle of the area I am in and it would probably be better, right?
---
Faerlina Ally player. I constantly see people posting in trade wts both devilsaur for 350. Its usually like 15g a piece for the leather.
---
Do they have travelform/ghost wolf/aspect or something? lol
---
Haha, this is straight misplaying. You don’t need to race in order to Blizzard when they are rooted for 4 seconds anyway. If anything, you risk ooming and wiping more often, you are more prone to resists etc.   This is mage 101.
---
The xp is horrible from what I hear, that was nerfed too before 1.12
---
&gt; Rage gen isn't tied to damage.
---
LOL. What do you think it’s tied to, your spell power?
---
The number of hours needed to get the mount at this point in classic precludes any possibility of life beyond the game.
---
I will stab you in the face, with a knife
---
I made a typo there, I was
---
meant to type "raid" at the end and thats right, Ill only get items from dungs that I want on my chars and then farm some gold and wait for more content in the future.
---
These are the days I too remember
---
Back in the day, and through most of development, the dev team uses a spectator mode for GMs and they can fly around and observe players. During the beta they were keeping track of events this way and if you've played in Vanilla most people had an experience with a ghost GM here and there (they used to be way more chatty, roleplaying and everything, was so much fun).
---
Basically what he is saying is if literally 1 or 2 devs took an evening to spectate like 1 or 2 zones they would easily see the abuse happening.
---
&lt;Always Sunny in Azeroth&gt; is our guild on Kirtonos
---
Blue gear and skill. Which class, equipped with these 2 things, has the potential to do well enough against most players in wpvp through all of the content phases?
---
That guide says to just turn them in at Revered, but I'm wondering about stuff like this: https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=9142/craftsmans-writ
---
That looks like a more effective use for the tokens, but I don't really know anything about those writs, how hard those quests are to complete, whether they'll be in the game for a while before Naxx, etc.
---
Really need to do this as well -- I need the ogre's cloth belt and I know warriors need that savage chain(?).  
---
Should be win-win.
---
Addon which shows a person's guild name underneath when you click on them? Atm it just shows:
---
Xyz
---
Level 60 warlock
---
Any way to get ti show, Xyz, &lt;Abc&gt; Level 60 warlock?
---
No hahaha 
---
Its a priest in our guild she spends alot :P
---
Run scholo , strat etc and pick up your bis
---
Pretty sure Blizzard said it's not against ToS or they won't act on it either way. I think it happened on an OCE server first and they did nothing about it
---
yeah get it right :)
---
I’m a fury warrior and usually see arms warriors
---
50% - either it happens or i doesn’t
---
For weapons: 
---
I bought a cheap (vendor) gun early. And I've only upgraded it twice from what happened to drop for me. Like I said, it's only for pulling -- I don't even have to hit with it, the mob will pull regardless of no hit or little damage.
---
For my main weapon: I just used what I got from questing and dungeon runs. I have rarely bought anything at all off the AH. I had the same axe from level 25 till I actively looked for what was available on the AH at 30. Then I spotted a really good axe that effectively increased my DPS by something like 30%! (It was 4 or 5 gold!) I probably won't upgrade again until I get Whirlwind axe from the warrior questline (level 40). I've run through Razorfen Kraul twice hoping to get Corpsemaker (it didn't drop either time), and I want to try again (until I get it).
---
Assuming the OP is posting in good faith and everything here is true.
---
Why would you stay?
---
Guilds should be hungry for Locks. They are a low pop class with a lot of raid utility.
---
Just find another guild. MC and Ony aren’t hard. Get geared up before BWL and then move into a better guild if you aren’t happy.
---
Holy shock is rarely used. And incredibly inefficient. Only really used if a heal on the move is absolutely nessassary. Which 99% of the time its not
---
Thanks for the tip I will! I hope you will lay off the crack btw.
---
Seriously gratz your char looks awesome
---
Yes they have one for pretty much all classes. They are varying levels of active, for instance the warlock/duid ones are pretty active but the hunter one is mostly dead in my experience. I'd send you a link but I am not in the mage one, and I don't remember where I got the invites to the other ones.
---
There's probably links in the classic subreddit discord.
---
People were running MC with dudes in greens that weren't even level 60 on week 1.
---
But no you have to have the BEST possible equipment for fucking MC.
---
Don't care. Class specific quest item changes everything imo.
---
Yeah for sure. I use discord voice , TS, Mumble.
---
Discord voice is fine if you have like up to 10 people playing together. Then voice quality, organization, and lack of effective tools make it go to shit.
---
Teamspeak is great, in that it has a wide array of useful tools, and can easily support as many members as you need. The biggest issues are a separate program (discord for text Ts for voice) and monthly sub based on number of members you want to support.
---
Mumble has probably the best toolset for large organizations, it’s free, and once you have it set up it’s pretty easy to use. But it sounds like you are talking through a soupcan. But the hierarchical role channels it does are great.
---
This comment isn’t so much meant for you Zelden, you already know this. It’s for the smoothbrained neckbeards who struggle to focus their two active brain cells into keeping the drool inside their mouth. 
---
🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
---
Its cause everything was shiny and we were dumb, and no one knew how to perfectly min-max.
---
As a regular visitor/essentially resident of Strathroy, I can tell you it is not nice any time of the year.
---
Maybe you just don't like healing.
---
I don't. I jumped ship from disc to shadow as soon as the opportunity presented itself.
---
Can we ban all posts that are screen shots
---
Agreed. If he’s raiding he’ll need to be making them for himself anyways. Tough part is getting that  pattern for a decent price.
---
Why do you care?
---
This shit also happens on Stalagg
---
It always been easier to run (transfer) for some whiners while others take the given balance and still smash. Keep fighting, the runners would have been useless fighters anyways.
---
It's actually much better than I originally thought it would be. I have 2 PC setups (2 mice, 2 keyboards) so I don't have to switch between windows. I basically have the priests numberpad setup with macros, a heal for each party member, prayer, follow warrior, fade and assist dispels/abolishes/shackles (basically I target who I want to target and just hit the button).
---
With the second keyboard directly to the left I can basically play the priest with my left pinky finger while primarily controlling the tank and if I need any finer control both mice are right beside each other so I can just flip between priest or warrior.
---
You deserve this for using Bing.
---
I hope you find your guide with the help of a search engine that deserves the name.
---
I've just hit 40. I made my gold by buying the iron rods from BB and the putting them on again in sw made 4g a piece.
---
For all the focus on AOE lvling and frost spec, I was fire on my mage from lvl 10 all the way until an hour before my first MC run. Its really fun and the damage you do is insane.
---
Goblin/Princess runs possible in 12minutes for druid by kiting around small stone. that + either ghostmushroom or mithril gets u pretty nice gold/hour
---
Shadow has serious threat issues. Makes it difficult for them to compete.
---
Talking about it opening up in the twitch app on your computer when you visit the curse page to download it... Yes I used it exactly once
---
Fuck this guy.
---
Why people care what he thinks or says is beyond me.
---
In dungeons just heal the tank and party. Dont need to judge.
---
Brilliant this is exactly what I wanted
---
/use \[@player\] Dynamite
---
You can also use \[@cursor\] to immediately throw it to your cursor's location without the targeting reticule, as long as it's in range.
---
During a pull, that's fine....it's part of your rotation.  After a pull? That's you using the healer's water instead of yours.
---
I already knew it too. Just another game to play, but yeah I either don’t care enough or don’t have the time to do all the little meticulous things. Let alone the time or will to raid lol
---
Good question, would like to know too
---
Priest are the only healer that can 2 man jump runs. Find a warrior.
---
&gt; But no you have to have the BEST possible equipment for fucking MC.
---
says who
---
[@self] modifier would do it in retail
---
People arent entitled to anything. But who cares what Asmon has to say about this
---
they have multiple full raids of people.
---
Hope you've got your mount.
---
A class quest specific item is in no way different than a BoE you cannot personally equip.
---
Level 1-60 is often a solitary personal experience.
---
Raiding is a group activity.
---
You dont need to be top 2 dps in every raid. Your utility as a hunter will come into play on very specific fights and you'll be needed.
---
Do you want to be useful and needed? Stick with it.
---
Are you just feeling like you need to top the dps charts to feel like you're useful even though that's not true? Reroll.
---
Unless you are him I fail to understand why the fuck this matters.  He could say that puppies cause cancer and it wouldn't have any relevance to how you, I, or anyone plays with puppies.
---
If you weren't first out the gates questing was super slow because of competition. Those guides only work on dead servers or when you're in the lead. That's why dungeon grinding worked so well this time around. Didn't have to waste so much time with competition.
---
But but but... Dps numbers...
---
Seriously though, I don’t blame you... on to the next group.
---
Because you generate rage on a white hit, but Heroic Strike takes the place of that white hit ads maybe 12 damage to it, costs rage and you don't generate any. Using sunder all your white hits do more damage and generate threat. Kill times are similar anecdotally however, you tend to have rage left when the mob dies so you can charge another with extra rage.
---
Ironically I left Sulfuras early on because of the login wait time. Heartseeker was low pop when I transferred. Now we’re pretty constantly full, and the horde vs alliance imbalance feels particularly lopsided. Wish I had just stuck it out on Sulfuras.
---
Uhhh its 2019. You better accept that chicken for his species choices you bigot.
---
I’m glad you bailed. Don’t take any crap from mages.
---
I played a holy priest back in vanilla, it got to the point where I wouldn’t even attack people back in world PvP. I would just heal myself and stay alive. Most people couldn’t kill me 1 on 1, and after a couple minutes of trying to kill me they would just leave me alone and let me farm.
---
I try. If the numbers were a little closer like 40/60 then I'd be fine, it's just a little discouraging. I wouldv been 60 a while ago but when I finally get done work, playing with my kids, wife, I get on and get camped. My brother has helped me a shit ton and I'm almost there though at 57.
---
 If groups were easy to come by then I don't think it'd be so bad, but it's a combination of no groups and so many Horde that make it a bad experience. As much as u want to keep it quiet so more Ally level here, I don't want other people to be blindsided by this either.
---
Same just got it last night, I keep the crowd pummeler in bags for the str when I'm struggling with agro. The last boss drops a pretty nice crit mace too
---
It doesn't work as of this morning, even in a raid.  It will automatically promote leader to the character that is online.  Requires a second account to do it now, or a friend to do every reset.
---
Agree to disagree. You'll never change my mind.
---
Ya, this has got to be a fucking troll post... I'd imagine half the warriors would gquit if you have this to a pally these days with how insanely good it is.
---
Go to sm and use general chat to find groups
---
How much is a stack of 20 deviate fish worth?
---
I did my first Classic MC run last Sunday and it was so damn fun. I was having a blast even just killing trash. I'm sure it'll become more and more routine but for now I'm loving it!
---
Underrated comment. Tanks have their pick of healers too, and there are so many they're about as plentiful as dps it seems. :/
---
That speaks more about how fucking awesome puppies are than it does about how some streamer feels about some random topic.
---
I really like questie, not many issues and my hunters at 57 right now.
---
Sure, though Tremor Totem is generally considered the Horde equivalent.
---
People only have limited time to raid because of work and stuff, so there's nothing wrong with wanting your guild members to be decently geared so that MC takes 3 hours instead of 6+
---
That being said, there are plenty of guilds who aren't going to lose their minds if you don't have all your PreBIS. I've been running MC and Ony for 3 weeks now as a fucking Arms warrior lol
---
all right.. im just having a hard time finding groups.. its weird haha
---
I was first out of the gate, I started with a 50 hour marathon and only slept 12 hours the first week so I got a head of the pack and had every zone to myself. I had a guide I personalized and practiced for months prelaunch and was incredibly prepared. I didn't count on dungeon leveling because I wasn't expecting anybody to be able to keep up with me.
---
I joined a very competitive guild and they had 2 coordinated dungeon groups. Those dungeon groups played less than me and crushed me in leveling speed.
---
So yea, dungeon grinding is 100% the faster way to level, it has nothing to do with being stuck competing for quests. Unless of course you're a mage that can aoe grind 24/7 uncontested but unfortunately I didn't have that option.
---
Its crazy how much wow got right after learning from EQ. Its not that eq was hardcore or wow was easy mode. It was just EQ had bad game design just because they had no clue what would be best. They did a good job for what they had of the time though. I got to try out p99 and see what it was all about only got to a lvl 30 druid though. But even then to grind 30 in everquest is still something.
---
&gt;It's a nice run
---
r/outside
---
nah it still is percentage wise very high % of total damage, if not top. Not much cancelling going on there.
---
And I'm the one who sounds salty?
---
Please re-read what you just wrote and try to come up with a way to express your opinion that won't make you sound like a complete moron.
---
I'll be waiting.
---
Dudes wearing his gnomish mind control cap inside-out.
---
saw something similar the other day. good stuff.
---
People are entitled to have an enjoyable experience playing the game since we're customers.
---
If we're not entitled to anything why are we paying ?
---
Many think it was in the game back in the day but was simply never noticed.
---
I just watched like 2 hours of the fastest lv 60 mage in classic. He blinks a lot with big pulls. There's no way to get around it. You can't sustain the hit/stun/slows if you hang around. If you are doing small pulls it is probably a waste. Seems like you are in the minority with this opinion.  Big means more than 10 mobs.
---
Take offers in trade chat, your server's subreddit, your server's discord.  You don't need gold in 30seconds, get an idea over the next two days of hocking and whispering people that it would be the best item to upgrade their character.
---
Correct though, setting language to russian through the config files allows you to make many such names regardless.
---
Ok thanks guys, I'll try and get the Staff or Mass at Uldaman.
---
FYI, For now I'm mainly tanking in dungeons but I'll be respecing restoration at level 60, so the gnomeregan mass won't be worth it for me
---
Still worth it as a mage imo its a low bar for entry for how easy it is compared to zombies in zf. And if you do the demons in the back it’s that much better
---
Be me, a Warlock  
---
\&gt;What did it cost  
---
\&gt;Why, just a trip to Ratchet!
---
Quick everyone roll horde for the better racials, then camp the 5 alliance left on the horde dominated server, then make fun of them when they transfer off and pretend it’s because they lack some sort of masculinity.
---
&gt; they'll be in the game for a while before Naxx
---
no
---
Amazing list, the best list I've found so far. Have the lists been updated for Dire Maul?
---
&gt; Would KOS all Devilsaur mafia on my server
---
But then they would do the same thing, just without opposite faction involved.
---
If you can't get the manpower to fight their opposite faction allies, how would you have the manpower to fight their same faction group?
---
You're fighting the same amount of players either way.  Difference is an untargetable skinner.
---
I was very disappointed to discover "Prebisphilbin" is too long for a char name

Hey all! I have a quick question about addons and would really appreciate some help. I mostly play on a Mac laptop (I know) and I was able to download and add a couple addons, namely Questie, Bartender, and Auctioneer.  However, OmniCC, DPS bars, and Titanpanel (among others) are not being recognized once I login. They are in the correct folder and I followed the same steps as I did with the addons that work. Is there something specific in Mac's settings that could be causing this? A friend mentioned that I should download a program which stores all the addons, I think it was Curse? Would I need to delete my currently installed addons in order to do this? Thank you to anyone taking the time to read this and help out!
---
who lied to meeeeeeee
---
You need to be aggressive.
---
Spam general and lfg chat
---
If it takes longer than 5 mins.  /who warrior and spam all of them for a tank. Dps are easy to find
---
Original timeline was just a hair over 2 years, if I was a betting man I assume that's about the timeline we'll be working with, though I expect that we'll get information about the future of classic before then.
---
&gt; I’d also bet they keep enough classic servers and let us character copy/transfer to the new TBC servers. 
---
This idea has been pretty prevalent since release, and while I doubt that they will allow character copies (fingers crossed), one-way transfers seem logical.
---
I still LOVE the idea of a Classic+, but at the end of the day that would be the least cost effective thing that Blizzard could do, considering they have an exhaustive archive of content that would take very little work to deploy.
---
The question then becomes...how far does this rabbit hole go? Are we going to wind up with a community divided between 3, 4, perhaps 7 different versions of WoW? That seems unsustainable as we move forward.
---
Classic has given Blizzard the subscriber jump start that they wanted, and has revealed a lot of the shortcomings of retail. I think it's time they seriously consider starting work on a new MMO project to shift people to when classic runs it's course.
---
Just hit 44, and only have 30g. Travel form is good enough lol. Main money sink is leather working. Almost completed the wild set.
---
No, it’s because we weren’t spoiled by the instant gratification of Retail. We used to laugh at the “LF2M UBRS Rend runs (sword reserved)” people, and they never made it to raid content because they didn’t understand it wasn’t about them. Now we have streamers encouraging ninja looting.
---
Wait, druid can equip guns?
---
I'm pretty sure he means mentally, not literally rewarding in terms of money
---
TradeSkillMaster. Download the addon, open up the auction house and type "/tsm scan" and it will take a few minutes to scan the entire auction house and get a minimum buyout and market value for any item on the AH. very very useful.
---
I wantem on my Ali
---
Are you 60 yet? Anyone specced arms at 60 before the honor system is even out is just dumb. It is however on par with if not better than fury for leveling depending on level range and gear.
---
Once the honor system/BGs are out it's the best PvP option as the MS debuff is amazing and can crit for some crazy high numbers. Most warriors I'm seeing are fury or prot as there really isn't a good argument for arms right now.
---
oh i added a subject and even a note and then it popped up in the middle of my screen and said "you cant send gold to yourself".
---
What’s the max number of buffs u can have?
---
I'm fairly certain that he is not using either of those. It looks more like LortiUI with a custom font and a few other modifications.
---
See [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3tWBfLWZEM)
---
If you delete a staff that sells for at least 1g why are you even farming?
---
Nothing... it is worthless and should not be sold cooked or consumed!
---
I say this as a very rich fish monger who sells deviate fish at 2.5-4gold a stack. Prices very by time of day and day of week. I’m also horde on a pvp server. Be carful though do not flood the market as that will only drive the price down.
---
Awesome, thank you so much for your reply.
---
So for a wind serpent, I should every 10 levels spend points on lightning and something like growl/bite/claw?
---
And for levelling I shouldn’t put points into stam/armour etc?
---
And if I mess up I can just respec my pet?
---
I saw other people talking about that in the thread as well, didn't realize it was a targeted spell. How often does it occur? Man Grounding Totem is the best.
---
The LW armor doesn't work better for druids, it's just additive.
---
I played LW in vanilla, I really advise something like Herbalism. LW was very disappointing and frustrating for me.
---
There are better weapons later on for raw stats.  The reason people use the MCP is because of the effect.  More mauls per second.
---
I understand and encourage you all to stay. I will tank for you.
---
Sincerely,

---
Druids don't murder things fast, sadly. You're not going to compete with a mage for aoeing stuff down. Even for non-nature immune things, hurricane isn't on par with mage aoe tools. 
---
You're better off utilizing stealth. There's a number of things you can stealth run for relatively speedy kills/collecting. It's likely not the same pure gold as what mages and stuff are getting, but it puts different stuff into the economy, so it's not all bad.

I have a 1974 Martin D28 that was my Grandfathers and a few others the best of which is a Taylor 310. The Taylor plays best but the Martin has the nostalgia thing going. I set up a beginner recording rig last year with computer interface etc and lots of microphones. Haven’t recorded much yet. I’m more of a singer and strummer than good guitarist. I used to home brew a bunch but it’s been a few years now. I lost my beer fridge in a remodel but used to two Cornelius kegs on tap all the time. I typically go deep into a hobby and it’s hard to keep up over time as I’m interested in too many things.
---
have you done all the elite quests and others in hinterlands?  I would say do a mara orange run for quests and the staff of celebras after that.  Then you can work on searing gorge.  You can do the blasted lands turn ins and hero of the horde so you are not raiding with an argent dawn commission or carrot on a stick trinket.
---
I tell healers all the time to only heal me if everyone else in the party is good or if im in serious danger. I usually dont pull aggro cause i focus on dots and life drain to recover health. I have a macro set to rotate my spells and the last two are drain-life back to back, so healing me will actually be a waste since its inefficient to waste my mana on overhealing myself, and a waste of the healers mana since I can take care of it myself through drain health, syphon life, soulstones, and deathcoil. 
---
 Also, what kind of asshole doesn't take a moment to eat and drink when every one else does?
---
Wroonnnng
---
Prob doing them a favor tbh. No rogue wants to group with a shitty tank that will ninja all the gear and then drip when they get what they needed.
---
Great. Likewise.
---
Its more to do with crushing blows, but pure armor side they're beasts.
---
And that's where you'll find one! We all had to make the same trip to level cooking.
---
I actually already have a mount haha so that makes it easier for sure. I'm good with the gold making
---
So I'm close to level 50 on my (Alliance) Rogue and I'm getting a little bummed out about it. I feel super vulnerable in group PvP and insanely cooldown dependent in 1v1/wpvp and it's definitely getting old. Before classic launched like many others I was stuck between deciding to roll either a Rogue, Mage, or Lock for classic - I've played all these classes extensively from TBC onward and it was a tough choice. Now I'm regretting choosing a melee class in this patch/meta.
---
I'd like to swap to either a Mage or a Lock, while staying alliance. Are these classes any less cooldown reliant or more enjoyable to play in Vanilla? They seem strong from my perspective getting my ass handed to me from horde mages/locks while leveling... but I'd like to hear some views from the perspectives of Mages/Locks.
---
Can we hang out in your party mansion?
---
I did this all the time below 40 when some alliance was behind me on the same road
---
Simple. Don't heal life tapping locks outside of combat. They can sit and eat/drink with the rest of us.
---
In combat I don't mind, aslong as the pull is going to plan and don't expect to be a priority heal
---
Like the Nestlé &amp; Monsanto Mafia?
---
I think druid rogue did this back in the day. I don't see why 2 druids couldn't.
---
Worth a try at least
---
Your opinion is wrong, a healers mana pool is to make the run go as fast as possible.
---
I've done it to fuck with my friends, but you're right, that isn't a normal thing to do.
---
Make sure you get a ravager anytime your volley is on cooldown to do aoe.
---
Sage had you grind a half level to finish it off, and then 15 bars (75%) into the next level as well (iirc early 40s). Nearly every dungeon run is highlighted as "not recommended" and while that's probably true for a solo-only speedrun or on pservers with small pops, doing them once puts you at a huge advatange while leveling. 
---
 
---
Unless you're speedrunning in a controlled environment these things are worth taking with a grain of salt for later levels. For getting to 30 they're pretty decent though.
---
I had the same problem as you, the blizzard just doesn't seem to tick quick enough to get them. Can anyone who has managed this explain how you did it?
---
I have a 20 druid didn't see polearms available from SW weapons master.
---
This is great to hear as I don't mind funding my rogue if its worth it.. will this be good for pvp as well I am assuming?
---
Never downhill.  Druids out threat warriors by quite a bit and start stacking stamina for insane health.
---
I play on a mac and use most of those addons.  Where are you downloading them from?  Also make sure the addon folder name exactly matches the `.toc` file in the folder.  For example Questie folder with Questie.toc inside.
---
Steer clear of people who think you need full prebis to be able to raid, you really just need 'not hot garbage' to raid effectively.   That said prebis in a lot of cases are the items you want cus they're good.   I don't wear full by the list prebis. But that's because I don't want to sacrifice stats to have 20 more unnecessary spellpower.  I'd rather have some extra Stam and crit and fun stuff
---
Look up: Manual Crowd Pummeler
---
So with tribute, the King is running much faster than on PServers and charge is on a CD and not just the intro to combat. Unless someone finds a trick like what hunters have been doing to get around it, it’s not possible yet (Aside from Hunter solo). Plus hunters can feign and try again. Druids would either need to have one die and brez them before they themself die and wait until reset or go through the entire dungeon again each attempt.
---
That being said, it is likely that Druid/Rogue could 2 man it later Vanilla with the rogue tanking, but that’s just speculation.
---
How about world Pvp though?
---
Definitely, though I can't nolife as hard as I did in the old  days. I played from BC until the release of Cata, and since then I've never found a game that gave me the same feeling that wow did, until now. There was always something missing that I can't quite put my finger on, wow just has this magic for me.
---
Honestly, as a tank, I liked this.  I can taunt and immediately start with a chunk of threat before I've even done anything.
---
I advise not going regrowth. Just not enough mana and the overheals can be brutal.
---
I'd just go Moonglow or hotw/NS and use r4 ht for raid healing and rank 6-7 when there's actually damage going out. Hots occasionally on tanks for fights with CC
---
Yeah something other than porn
---
\*\*laughs in retail\*\*
---
You probably answered the wrong post, I never mentioned potions.
---
As for ease of healing this is mostly because people aren't geared yet, but the lack of feral tank gear in MC/BWL will eventually cause druids to fall behind warriors. While AQ40 and Naxx offer vastly better loot, it still doesn't compete with the warrior Tier set.
---
If you want some numbers check [this guys actual tests](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRVNabnxWQoq4Ya_cNDMKuZJwf9zbfzWhe3qf6d08gEk3OuJJ_z_zgERPRaDioAGux14ORx6thE6Hub/pubhtml#), which show an increasing difference in damage taken as the gear improves. I'd argue he weighs stamina too high in his BiS calculation, but overall that doesn't change much.
---
This doesn't mean you can't use druids to tank a lot of fights of course. But generally speaking, a warrior MT is the more efficient choice.
---
Nailed it!
---
Right but that's more useful for mats and other things common on the AH. In the situation in my post, when you have a rare BoE thats almost never on the AH, this add-on wouldn't be very useful, right?
---
Then do not roll greed on items and type, pass since I got a green upgrade.
---
Wrath was the most fun to me, only because of achievements.  Bored of grinding/raiding?  Let's hunt down some rare mobs, or work on a forgotten rep to get a mount I'll never use.
---
First try.
---
Can we ban the comments about banning the posts about banning posts?
---
Can you make a lot of money fishing? I have 8g on my main
---
Right I'm pvping without a weaponchain...
---
Holy shit people on this sub is fucking delusional lmao
---
So let me get this right..
---
A warlock can:
---
1. Choose never to eat/drink, and demand the healer heal him after a pull when life-tapping (costing the healer precious, finite waters and slowing the party)
---
2. Avoid life-tapping between pulls and start a fight OOM, just to life-tap mid-fight so the healer *has* to heal him (being worse at DPS in the process, literally your one job, and then causing the healer to get OOM faster &amp; potentially causing a wipe)
---
3. Life-tap mid-fight after naturally going OOM, instead of using a Mana pot (potentially the healer is also nearly OOM, and healing you forces the healer to pop his own Mana pot)
---
Any time you use life-tap and the healer heals you, you are costing the healer either time, money, both, or putting the group at risk. That can seem overly dramatic in a normal small pull, but it is what it is. I come to every dungeon with pots, food, and scrolls. I'll do my job until we wipe. But I won't risk a wipe because of a greedy GOFAST DPS, and I'll call out the BS when I see it.
---
Personal example in SM GOGOFAHST run:
---
* Lock life-tap himself to less than 10% hp after a pull. Warrior goes to grab a drink IRL
---
* I, as a holy priest, had healed everyone and just sat down to drink. I wasn't halfway through my water when...
---
* The lock got visibly impatient, and pulled a single mob. He seemed to think I would heal him if that was the case. He feared the mob and LOS'd it to me. Entire group was sitting.
---
* I didn't heal him, was gunna let him learn from his mistake.
---
* Instead of dying, he pops a health pot.. oh wow, looks like he had consumables after all
---
It shouldn't be status quo to exhaust all the consumables of the healer/tank just to benefit the DPS. I don't get stones of any kind from locks and have to beg mages for water and never get enough. I farm my resources for me, not for you.
---
Everyone on wow classic wants to shit on the tanks &amp; healers while playing CLEAVEAOEFASTGOGOGO DPS and it's tiring.
---
no u
---
We got it on our first kill a few weeks ago
---
Someone needs an ego check haha. You do you.
---
Start healing the Devilsaurs?
---
Yea the BiS shit is so annoying sometimes. If an item is your 2nd BiS, apparently people don't expect u to roll on it. It's like people expect to just wear greens until their BiS drops.
---
As a mage, I never kill warriors, I just feel so bad because they have no chance. Unless one attacks me first. Then I laugh at them and kill them
---
I meant STV. Start from the bottom of booty bay and go up to gromgol. Fish literally every node you see. Stonescale eels sell pretty well, blackscale oils are okay, firefins are trash. But really where you get your gold is from mithirl trunks
---
Right? As if utility means nothing anymore. 
---
Also, acknowledging that it's a faceroll, but yet still worried about "carrying" others? Which is it?
---
Dominos is pretty decent and covers more than just ActionBars.
---
It would be obvious within the first 60 deconds on playing it's a streamer server
---
I heard there are 16 slot bags or something?
---

---
Hello fellow Druid. What is your current spec? My suggestion would be to try heart of the wild/nature’s swiftness build. HoTW is the strongest 5 point talent in the game and it allows you to dps/heal/tank in dungeons and tank/heal in raids given that you have gear for each role (healing, int, spirit for resto, armor and stam for tanking). You can level with this spec and it’s also very strong in PvP.
---
My guild has multiple HoTW/NS druids that are both tanking and healing in molten core so it’s a very viable spec and gives you more options than if you just went straight resto or feral.
---
It's a dumb little thing that carried over from Pservers, but fortunately its not quite as rampant on official classic. People requiring and inspecting you to have full pre-BiS to join MC/ONY groups.
---
What are you gunna do if they don't say what you want them to say?
---
I thought armor damage reduction caps at 75%?
---
This is blowing my mind lol.
---
Heal-bot I believe. I just used the twitch app and searched for most popular. Works great.
---
What do you mean by can be verified by Blizzard? I wouldn't think blizzard would change anything if someone went back on their verbal agreement.
---
Is there a reliable BiS list? 
---
Was following a legit looking holy priest BiS list for the last week that had I think Mantle of Honor as best shoulders then Kentic as second best. Sorry don't have it right now so might have details a little wrong... Got the Kentic piece from BRD, ran Strat, saw the Cannon guy dropped shoulders that were WAY better than Kentic and they weren't even mentioned on this list. Now I feel like I'm missing out or wasted time? I'm thinking about just running stuff and seeing what I get. But I want to at least have decent gear. 
---
Any recommendations?
---
I am a 57 mage in Kirtonos. My friends and I put together a guild named Bacon Boiz, and we regularly go to STV to shadow our members and clap Horde cheeks. If you want in for some protection feel free to hit one of us up. Yes the balance is skewed, but that just means more Horde scum to /s on!
---
The only issue with this is guilds usually reserve stuff for their guild. If they are filling the group with PUGs, most items are rolled on. But specific items are reserved. And tank gear is more likely to be reserved than DPS or healer gear. 
---
Your best bet is to join a guild as a tank. It’s much easier to pug raids for Mc/Ony as DPS. Tanks have a easy time finding dungeon group pugs, but DPS have an easier time finding raid pug spots.
---
I have a level 50 warrior that will be my main. I'd like a farming class to help sustain my income so I created a hunter, level 8 atm. Unfortunately I'm hearing that DM solo runs arent what they used to be for gold. Is that accurate? Would leveling a hunter be a waste of time now if my only intent was to farm DM?
---
because GMs might not care, but they are not mentally retarded. They can shadow a player and watch them play.
---
Eh, mageblade is a special case since it's bis for so many classes. I'd argue MS&gt;OS in prios on that.
---
That's a solid point about the spellstone.  I actually never got hypnotic blade from SM and didn't do my lock quest because I'm a noob lmao
---
in order to get rid of the mafia you legit need to overwhelm them 24/7. sure, you can get a raid together for a couple hours and take over the crater for a bit, but as soon as you leave they will be back.
---
get good/get a raid together is a temporary (~couple hours) solution. the only true solution is to have another mafia which is exactly what people DON'T want to do because it involves cross faction collusion
---
3 hours is not a crawl for a casual guild.
---
The gap in xpoints will widen but the gap measured in xp bar bubbles will decrease. Until you’re both same level.
---
STOP BITCHING ABOUT MC LOOT AND NON META SPECS. MC is like fucking raid finder levels of face roll. Your guild isnt being held back by letting a ret paladin compete for gear that they want. Youre just bitching out of loot envy. Stop ruining other people's enjoyment of the game. You will not progress in end game without paladins, druids, priests, or shamans helping your raid, whatever their main spec might be.
---
If you have herb/alc you can make 3g off a stack of blackmouth oils. The stonescale eels sell for 5g a stack but honestly are worth hoarding for patch 3 where they’ll sell for much more. But you make a shit ton off runecloth bolts and the greens/blues
---
Thank you for the clarification. I’m level 37 with ~56g so I’ll need to grind a bit of gold for my mount. I’m currently at ~230 fishing as well, will that strategy still be efficient?
---
Are the two of you intentionally not seeing this sentence:
---
&gt;The extra rage then means that some of those heroic strikes will go through, due to having enough rage to let it do so, despite the intention being that you cancel it after your OH hit.
---
It's blowing my mind
---
Looks like lorti  + Luna
---
Yeh only BiS’s I care about are for my twinks I’m going to make. Just farmed 4 essence of air and water this morning went from 6 bars from lvl 57 to half way to 59 on my priest. Might grind elementals to 60 for gold. Seems pretty worth it.
---
Who the hell is buying Ghost Mushrooms for 8g/ea
---
Spotted the salty rogue.
---
Buddy, I didn't craft Robes of the Void because I felt I needed that extra 6 spell damage over the vastly cheaper Robes of Winter Night. I crafted it because I wanted it. I want my BiS and my Pre Raid BiS for no other reason than I think it's cool to have. I know I'll replace it soon but this is how I'm choosing to have fun.
---
Stopped reading after the dumbass dual wield argument. Can't shield block or shield wall while DW.
---
Jeez 30 is nuts! I burned out after level 10 on p99. It's so slow you can only take on 1 mob that's light blue or blue, and you have to take 5 min to regen back up for the next one. God forbid you picked a race with a xp penalty too
---
Yes please feel sorry for me.
---
Not my issue, I’m on a pve server, but at least then people will have Blizzard’s response and can decide what’s best for them.
---
&gt;This is our game, I play to get away from the worlds problems.
---
It's Blizzard's game, and by continue to pay for it, you are supporting Blizzard in the real world.  It sucks, but that's just the way it is.
---
&gt;Blizzard is not the only Corp to bend to China, they all do. Are you boycotting all of them? 
---
But Blizzard (And the NBA) are the first ones to blatantly punish people for speaking out against the CCP, and they're the ones facing the backlash.
---
&gt;Go virtue signal somewhere else, I guarantee half of the people who are “boycotting blizzard” and unsubbed were bored with the game already and are now just looking for some brownie points. You won’t get them here..
---
I don't care about upvotes or what you apologists think of me.  Really, despite what the defeatists say, if even half the people on Reddit unsubbed for a month, Blizzard would freak out and back peddle hard.  That's really all I want to happen, so I can play WoW again
---
Thank you for taking the time !
---
Probably
---
Still i want to reach cap with a single crit lol
---
Careful we are deep behind enemy lines here my friend. Boring Boomers surround us in all direction and they depise us.
---
Maybe in early vanilla, but not after the talent changes. I still have my level 60 warrior from vanilla sitting in orgrimmar wearing a bunch of hit leather.
---
That's not a ninja loot.
---
Gold serves everyone equally regardless of whether they can use the item or not. I, along with most people, am not gonna just let a pug have a 1,000 gold item just because he can use it. That item can be sold by anyone to get gold to buy an item of similar quality.
---
lol, ohh the judgement. Shit spec who out dps "good specs" Take a sarcasm post and make it seem like complaining. For someone not sits in blues with no epics and no dps trinkets I should be getting smoked. 
---
FYI: I was holy spec but the only priest who would go shadow/weaving since we carry more locks so I forgave any loot and roughly 500g in my truefaith vestments, and the hours spent farming holy gear, to help the guild out. Remember before you judge understand the scenerio.
---
Did one run in ZF on my Priest and it dropped. 
---
Sorry dude.
---
Mages and rogues.
---
My pvp policy is I'll leave you alone until you start interfering with my questing/grinding. I keep my 60 mage near my shaman I'm leveling (2 accounts) and I've only had a few alliance cheeky enough to stick around trying to tag mobs even after I /shoo them. I do have a policy that I won't use the mage if I get ganked by someone within 2-3 levels of my shaman, if you can kill me in a fair fight I'll just /clap on the mage and leave you alone. He's really only there to ward off bored high levels that get their jollies off killing lowbies, or if I get attacked by multiple people. I also use him to help any other lowbies in the area getting ganked by higher levels.
---
i have a 60 rotting on westfall pve because i realized how much of the actual game you miss out on by turning off pvp conflicts.  i'm re-rolling on a pvp server so i too can experience fun like what OP posted.
---
Use vanq, the +AP is more help than you'll get from a couple more dps or a faster weapon.
---
+50 Social Credit Score
---
I blame "meta" relevancy, and a hint of jealousy
---
Join an RP server after making a backstory, act it out, and see what happens. And see what other people are doing on that realm for inspiration. Pretty simple.
---
Idk if you are unaware but rogues has this ability called blind.
---
It’s what I did and I had 130g when I hit 40. 
---
230 fishing is def enough to fish there. Towards booty bay you’ll have to swim in the water tho to avoid the 40+ mobs.
---
Would have given an upvote if there was at least one terribly cropped lionheart helm on one of them.
---
As a ret main. I am jealous of your ret loot. Wish there wasn't so much hate for non-meta specs in this community. It's super toxic and unnecessary. Im glad you are enjoying the game. Keep having fun and hitting hard. Fuck the haters. I hope you're on a PvP server to let the horde feel the fury
---
Hey buddy, you wanna stop rubbing all that clout in our faces? We get it, you mine thorium. All jokes aside, that’s really nice to have already. I don’t have any of the preraid BiS for my mage yet
---
Yeah, you only really need 6%. Though getting overcapped is very normal.
---
what add-on is that which shows how many items each character has. altoholic?
---
Yeah I myself don't understand what macros even do. Besides maybe the one that makes your character shout now this is pod racing when you equip your mount
---
Alternating Current
---
It's hard when you down grade to a version where the only thing that's actually better are the graphics. Imagine using any product for free and when you decide to actually pay for it for once you get an inferior product.
---
There are a bunch of ways to make loot council work. Our guild runs on a rotating council. 3 Class officers are on the council for a month, and then 3 random raiders are on the council each week. It helps keep drama down to a minimum, and gets people invested.
---
Ok so I have a question. How much health/armor does a prepaid bis Druid have? How effective is that gear translate into a big scenario.
---
For a druid it really isn't hard. With some upgrades over pre-raid bis a druid can reach 75% damage reduction. At that point armor will become pointless and only dodge will help.
---
While Warriors scale much much better with every tier. Also Druids don't have serious tanking cds so Nefarian's class call will fuck them up putting them in cat form. A warrior during his class call will only take 22% more damage because he's forced in zerk stance and has 2 cds he can use if things look dire. A druid forced in cat form is prone to being 1hit by a raid boss.
---
How does using AOE make you a dick?
---
how is it not bis for warriors?
---
Lvl 40 mount is completely free, it’s a very quick class quest
---
Lol. Thanks for all the advice about fishing, Web browsers, search engines and screen shots. I'll be sure to never go to these places or to drive through America to get to them.
---
Yes, but if you are raiding you will get t1 or t2 head pretty fast for pvp
---
I got felheart horns so far, hopefully a juicy skullcap soon
---
sure they can rise up and disrupt it for a couple hours (and even that would take a ton of work/coordination). the second the raid falls apart the mafia will be back and at it again.
---
the mafia guilds only real purpose is to lock down ungoro. its hard to compete with that if you want to do anything else.
---
Or dont give advice if you don’t know what you’re talking about. Spellpower scales horribly with AoE spells.
---
You just have to kill off the other people who are trying to AoE until they leave. If they're same faction (or if you're playing PVE) aggro and drag additional minions into the back part of their first blizzard to give them additional minions they can't clump together. You can also try to frost nova half of their pack and ruin their clump. There are limited resources so you gotta fight for them
---
That's the 60 mount, 40 is free.
---
Are you a Mage? Just curious how you would choose to level if you were one.
---
Idk if your aware but any self respecting warrior who pho’s, no wait any player who pho’s knows that skull of impending doom breaks blind and would prepare before retaliating for a blind and run by using skull of impending doom. Since you seem to know everything you’d know that
---
Did you not read the article or something? The 40 mount costs the price of a normal spell
---
Yea it's just for the phase 1 shadow bolts they hit pretty hard.
---
Reading is hard
---
I’m not one to quit something I put time into to make better. I was asking a 3rd party what they thought and what they would do. Thanks for the advice bro
---
So I roll Human for alliance priest but I also do a really funky holy/disc hybrid build for tanking healing in raids. 
---
It's a really wonky build and the threads no longer exist where the ideas are laid out and explained, the only reason I brought  this whole thing up is because the 5% human spirit was one of the big things that made the build work. 
---
If you want I'll try to find some old info on it, I'll be rolling a priest at some point so I'll have to figure out myself eventually.
---
I’ve been playing since 2007, I’ve been a part of Guilds using: DKP, EPGP, Suicide Kings, Prio List and LC.
---
LC has been the most popular over the years and of all the Guilds I’ve been in, I’ve been a part of the inner clique zero times, I’ve been an officer once and I’ve been on LC twice.
---
Out of nearly 15 years I’ve never seen a corrupt LC like the ones often described.
---
I’m not saying they don’t exist but you think I’d come across one at least once. When I was on LC we always tried our best to reward good players and reward all players evenly so the entire guild was getting geared at an even rate.
---
I’ve only been the best geared twice for my role, once in H-ICC-25m and at the end of Legion in Antorus. Most of that was due to having nearly 100% attendance.
---
Private servers usually just went with 1.12 shit too.
---
I'm duo'ing a disc priest and arcane mage all the way to 60. At 56 currently. It's an incredible duo, round up as many mobs as I can and just arcane explosion/holy nova them down. Drink and repeat. It's also great to play one in a dungeon and have the other on the AH
---
Still yes.
---
I used Hakurai's Alliance 1-60. It was awesome. Hardly ever any pure grinding required and very easy!
---
Are you kidding me? We *knew* what was best for a fury warrior in Vanilla. It’s not hard. We had guides. We had videos. It all existed then. The only difference now is people like you. Why don’t you go watch Indalamar’s fury warrior video from WoW Beta. The spec was nerfed because of him. We *knew* all the things then that people like you know now. The difference is **greed**.
---
&gt;Shit spec who out dps "good specs"
---
You outdps shit players, not good specs.
---
Jesus you even had all the healing gear and refused to go shadow weaving heals. Yeah I wouldn't give loot to you either.
---
Laughes in old school runescape
---
You have a print screen key.
---
I put looks over stats, which just makes things so much easier. I've got no plan to raid (hate 20 and 40 man dungeons, they're brain rot boring for DPS classes) and I'll be happy just to world PvP and do BGs all day. Probably gonna end up in Black Dragon scale as it looks great and is fairly easy to obtain. I'd much rather look fly and do 3% less damage.
---
Also, that
---
&gt;there is no armor cap in vanilla wow.
---
you can't get higher than 75% though, so there kinda is.
---
Charger is 100%. Lock and pally get 60% mount for free.
---
he knew what he was trying to do but that doesn't mean the overall situation isn't stupid.
---
I’m a hordie that just dabbles with the other side I haven’t gotten that far into it yet.   Bustea’s on the other hand will tell you now you should do this dungeon with all of its quests or you will have to grind later.
---
Unless something has changed in the last few weeks, Kromcrush has kept a good faction ratio. It leans in Horde's favor a bit, but I'm pretty sure that's every PvP server.
---
Check out the server's Discord; it's pretty poppin'. https://discord.gg/jmkuzek
---
It’s also true for video and music in general. Google will prioritize YouTube and you may miss out on other options.
---
thats the epic mount you knob  
---
the 40 mount is free
---
Why wouldn't you just instantly kick them? I would.
---
Depends on what you need to do.
---
Flash of Light is more efficient than Holy Light for health/mana, but Holy Light is more efficient for health/time.
---
You'll need to balance both, especially once you figure in spirit, as casting holy light will be more viable when adhering to the 5 second rule.
---
You don’t need to contact ta GM. The TOS is no longer in effect, it was replaced by the EULA. The EULA has no such provision regarding cross faction collusion.
---
While this sounds dramatic in every sense, it is 100% true. Without a GM actually intervening, this exact scenario can and will happen. Thankfully behind his trollish exterior, the dudes just a regular nerd like all of us. No where near as toxic as forums pretend he is.
---
Lots of people in this very comment section have said it's not fine.
---
In all end game dungeons it's assumed that loot will be MS &gt; OS with MS being the role you are filling unless stated otherwise before the run.
---
I need my 400g truefaith vestments, and that drop might as well be my completed robes...
---
1) If you can use it... You're not stealing it.
---
2) And my point stands because you kept going when the guy said "who else is taking tank leather?"
---
You shouldn't talk down to anyone when you have shit for brains bud.
---
What about a message for when you shapeshift and have 0 Mana to go back in bear form and are stuck meeling mobs with your staff... Asking for a friend
---
You should be using a 2h for fury so the points are pretty useless
---
rogues and mages are hands down the biggest offenders. I'm glad they like to pad their meters, but I have 1 taunt on a 10 second timer and another on a 2 min timer. If they're gonna blow their entire combo a nano-second after I go in, they can get used to tanking. I'm gonna save those taunts to save the healer.
---
The money comes from selling blues and disenchanting or?
---
I agree mostly, but as A Pally who is levelling as mostly prot with some holy I just let the group know I'm rolling on healing gear and on my server tanks are in such demand I've only been told nevermind once. Going full Holy for end game content but its 10x easier to get into dungeons as the Tank so it works out. At least the group can start instead of spamming for another hour. If it isn't said ahead of time I only roll for what I came as though unless everyone greeds first then I'll ask. It's pretty simple really.
---
Fair point.
---
It is alway fun to two-shot a clothie.  Go play on a PVE server if you want to sit peacefully on a horse.  I can't stand people who ignore the other faction on PVP servers.  
---
"Let's just wave and be friends!"
---
Lets not.
---
Only 3 of the 12 has 60s tho
---
As with everything, there are tradeoffs... Obviously your sustained dps will be higher with DW spec, but PvP is all about burst. If PvP is really that important to you, MS is really where it's at and Fury has a very hard time comparing. 
---
Personally I wouldn't do anythinf other than 5/5 DW spec on any dual-wielding Fury warrior, I figure if you're going to roll that then you may as well commit.
---
Either way how you gonna counter restorative pots lol. And swiftly did pioneer many consumables and made them well known.
---
ninja plays there
---
The chances of not seeing a perdition's blade at 15 percent drop chance in 7 runs is ~32%. So about one third of guilds with 7 rag kills will have not seen a perdition's blade.
---
Because my idiot friends all play on it lmao.
---
it wasnt just impossible because of the math. the mechanics made it impossible with they didnt work properly.
---
The guy you replied to said BiS hunting ruined his experience because people are doing specific runs for specific items. 
---
You would be do the same exact thing. 
---
Maybe you poorly interpreted his comment and this entire thread and are projecting. Either way, you have a plan for your character and you want to achieve that goal. You want specific items. 
---
No one gives a shit if you roll on someone's BiS except for apparently you. Yet again, ay the game the way you want and let others do the same. 
---
I don't judge you for being weird and caring so much about having a "twink" with BiS. It's not how I enjoy the game but I won't judge you or keep you down. 
---
Same way I won't knock someone that chooses to run for specific items for their class as well. If you can use something, no one is stopping you from pressing need. Unless they switch to master looter and then that. Then you just need to find a different set of people that will play the way you want.
---
(All of this is a moot point if you run with guildies in a premade group anyway. Of course you can make an agreement with them. This thread, however, is about random people in Azeroth that are avoiding exploring or anything that doesn't lead to their BiS)
---
The division thing is something that worries me too. I don’t know that they’d go as far as Cata but who knows. I feel for the classic folks who want a permanent museum piece. I could see them dropping to a handful of classic servers and leaving them be. As long as we eventually get to Wrath and those servers stay put, they’ll have a sub or two from me for the life of that server.
---
Its amazing what 1 SP can do for Warlock dps. I wouldnt be complaining
---

This is the only rogue resource you need.

Every non-caster weapon in MC is better.

I saw multiple sell for 1500g on skeram yesterday

Badlands.
---
Just doing the quests killing mobs, skinning them, and all the trash that drops from the elementals made me the bulk of my gold for my mount.  Only problem is that killing elementals is a pain for a lot of classes - on my warrior I depend on bleeds to do a fair amount of DPS and this doesn't happen with elementals.
---
Go on. Where’s the gold coming from?
---
Then why *gasp* do you play wow? And why are you on a wow reddit?
---
.#humanfemalewarrior
---
&gt; we'll do our best across the board to own up to them when we do
---
Unfortunately that doesn’t include your upper management. Is the plaque at the statue still taped over?
---
While it is dropping, it was not always an item Rag dropped.
---
&gt;and people on your own faction to fill your bags with leather balls
---
LOL fuck
---
Rogue A crit 24 times and you only crit 23 times! Fucking dogshit at this game bro go get prebis fuckin scrub ass carry
---
Stop making tanking so unnecessarily difficult and we'll tank again. 
---
Sincerely, a fed up Tank.
---
I once allowed a warrior into my group when I was tanking. He needed on the same weapons as me because he was a fury. Vowed never again to invite a warrior into my groups
---
Even rogues has the decency not to need on your gear
---
This is complete nonsense. Fury warriors absolutely took leather.
---
You are not reading what I am typing so I’m stopping after this post. I made my statements. I made my points. You seem too dense to understand them and I pray no one takes you into a dungeon with your attitude on sniping gear for another class. Hopefully you recover from having your own head up your ass but I find that is often fatal and irreversible.
---
Heck yeah
---
In line with this question,
---
The only true "World First" I am aware of that could come out of Classic would be killing Hakkar in ZG with all of the Priests alive. Could this be done by the bleeding edge guilds of today with the additional knowledge?
---
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---
**If the High Priests around Zul'Gurub are not killed before Hakkar, then he is granted several powerful abilities which combine to make the fight near impossible. In addition, he gains approximately 50,000 health per priest that remains alive.**
---
*\* High Priestess Jeklik (Bat Aspect) - 1200-2000 AoE damage + 8s silence.*
---
*\* High Priest Venoxis (Snake Aspect) - 800 damage poison to the raid.*
---
*\* High Priestess Mar'li (Spider Aspect) - 6 second stun against current aggro holder. (Prior to patch 1.12, there was additionally a complete aggro reset).*
---
*\* High Priest Thekal (Tiger Aspect) - Frenzy, increasing attack speed by 150%.*
---
*\* High Priestess Arlokk (Panther Aspect) - 2 second gouge (aggro wipes the main tank)*
---
The closest attempt I have found was by Elitist Jerks, who were top-tier raiders, back in the day;  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJ5kag-gTcM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJ5kag-gTcM)
---
Sub 25% attempts back then makes it certainly seem doable.
---
Sadly, there did not appear to be any real benefit to doing this, no extra or additional loot drops, appears to be more of just a mechanic in place to stop people from farming Hakkar without going through the Priests and trash first.
---
Been tanking a lot as a War and I always wondered this. I never take another war, because why would I?!
---
I’ll take DPS role sometime as it’s just way easier and DPS can be done brain dead. But I yield/ask tank what gear they’re going for. 
---
Had no problems so far
---
While leveling it's not as big a deal. I didn't train ports for a while (bought my mount and those spells cost over a gold each) and then I did dungeons where we were doing quests, so we all just ran out of the dungeon together anyway (or hearthed).  At the cap though, a port is polite, unless of course you're chaining the instance for some reason!
---
The way they talked down about Blizzard over a tiny bug, that was later fixed, means their standard of "Near flawless," is tantamount to literally flawless in anyone else's eyes.
---
Shit happens, bugs go unnoticed, and are later fixed. That's literally how every single program on Earth works.
---
Can we ban the comments about the comments about banning the posts about banning posts?
---
In Dire maul north, there are two doors, one on the right where you get to the DM north instance. Where is the other door going to?
---
They never told me all the crap from the legion client that'd be left in. The pull behavior of mobs both outside and inside instances is completely broken. I have had patrol run past sheeped mobs, not giving a fuck. They also reset way too fast. All escort npcs move way too fast and sometimes ignore combat and just keep walking. Pets are completely busted both for hunters and warlocks. The list goes on and on. Meanwhile the only thing that has improved are graphics. Not to mention the ridiculous dungeon exp that created this awful cleave meta we are in. Using 1.12 talents for the early content is also pretty bad. I guess it all depends on how much you care for those "engine bugs". I find them really awful. You can't even wall jump....
---
Including the rules imo.
---
Should we just pretend that getting it the first time around wasn't a popularity contest anyway?
---
well the GM is a retard
---
Hey lets have 1 instance where we name it based off the last boos and not the instance.
---
TLDR: IDGaF, I played Vanilla.
---
im not sure the level but olympus is involved, at least from what i've gathered watching asmon's stream. unbind who used to be in vampire clan and is in olympus seems to be the one who organizes everything from the olympus side.
---
I can't tell anymore if memes like this are Thanos or Guldan memes.
---
Step 1: Take at least 1 gathering profession. (I had 2 gathering professions while leveling and for a while after I first hit 60.)
---
Step 2: Tank dungeons.
---
Step 3: Run dungeons whenever you are online. Gather on your way to dungeons.
---
Step 4: Buy your epic mount.
---
Druids are the best gatherers in the game. We also get all of the benefits of tanking without the big repair bills that Warriors have to deal with. You can't AoE grind like a Mage, but you will make gold almost as fast as they do if you're smart about it.
---
I beat the Hunters in my guild to their epic mount, and they're supposedly right up there with Mages.
---
I don’t fish and tell. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Thank you for commenting.
---
Except that video had things working on him that don't: Weapon Damage enchants and counter weights.
---
My current build is feral DPS, 14/32/5 build.
---
Thank you for your quick response! That is extremely helpful! I'll respec ASAP.
---
Ahh so people like you are why we never get responses to tickets
---
Cool thanks, one thing I did read said for wind serpent you only need growl and lightning? Because lightning has no cd, that should be your only focus dump alongside growl, so not to worry about bite.
---
Is this true?
---
&gt; I understand this mindset for cutting edge mythic raiding, not fucking Molten Core.
---
Eh, you are forgetting two big things. 
---
1) Feral druids need very very little gear from MC (considering the tier set is resto). This means that the bear tank both will have little motivation too show up to raids and may quickly get disheartened.
---
2) Long term members are ideal both for a fun guild social aspect as well as not having to continuously recruit. The prospects for a bear druid are grim at best when you start getting towards naxx. If you are looking at two possible guild recruits and one refuses to go resto and the other is already resto, there is an obvious better choice there.
---
If I was healing and the tank took an upgrade from me, I'd leave and ignore that tank. I wouldn't group with a tank taking healing gear in the first place, don't know who would. Especially when it comes to BRD where it can be 10+ runs before you see the item again.
---
Abuse your guildies if you want but try and treat pugs better. It's an mmo not a single-player game.
---
Death Bringer if Orc for the 3% hit. Bad for rage dumps though. 
---
Eskhanders right claw for the haste+threat gen+rage dumps. 
---
Alcors sun razor for rage dumps
---
QS is good for tanking if human, or if wearing edge masters.
---
Someone needs to start a devilsaur FBI tasked with bringing down the mafia.
---
I believe they said that this is how it was in vanilla and is not a bug. So it's probably here to stay.
---
First step is to make a back story, then find a guild in a guild finding thread.
---
Herd this from payo a streamer on twitch. DM is diremould idk if thats how u spell it. But its a dungeon and when running the dung a tribute rin is where you dont kill the bosses so that at the end u can loot the chest and get better loot from the chest at the end if u dont kill the bosses.
---
Just think if you had typed the title into Google, you'd have your answer by now!
---
You are confusing PvP with PvE.
---
I'm really not in touch with anything on youtube besides what pops up on my main page, so I will acknowledge that I talk about mainstream stuff too much, \*\*because I'm not aware of anyone else\*\*(edit)
---
Join an RP server, join that servers discord. Join an RP guild on said server, and participate in events. I'm on Grobbulus and this is how I do it
---
How many people do you need at minimum to start raiding molten core? I've seen people 15-20 man onyxia but haven't seen what a minimum for mc would be. Anyone trying to run with less than 40?
---
Go play in traffic kid. I don't respect you and I'm guessing most people don't.
---
You're not smart and you sound like a pretty shitty human being.
---
So sit and spin fucc boi.
---
[here you go fam](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Dire_Maul_tribute_run)
---
Dope, was inaccessible from work computer but I checked it out on my phone, will dig in a little deeper when I get home. I'm sure theres lots of info I'll find useful
---
Google
---
DM E - Only do the eastern part
---
DM N - Only do the northern part
---
DM W- Only do the western part
---
Tribute - Only kill the last boss in DM N, and then talk to the other bosses for nice buffs
---
Scarab Lord? that's so many moons in the future, chances are his whole zerg will have moved to something else by then
---
It's better tank up to 60 and then respect to pure healing build.  
---
Than playing dual specs.  
---
Pure tank with additional feral talents like x2 combo points on crit, skipping Improved Shred.  
---
With this you will have a breeze leveling and easily find group as a tank for dungeons.
---
Some rogues are also past the mara lvls. a lvl 55+ rogue doesn't want to spend an hour getting a group/running mara once when a sp can carry him through it 3/4 time in the same amount of time and guarantee he gets the ring if it drops
---
It’s Dire Maul North without killing any boss except the king at the end. There are a few things the group needs to do to accomplish this such as steal a key, set up an ice trap to freeze and bypass a boss, and disguise a group member as an ogre and talk to the guard to the last boss room, then don’t kill Cho during the final encounter. 
---
It basically awards 6-9 blue items, most of which are exclusive to a tribute run
---
Raiding is the weakest part of vanilla by far.
---
Levelling is great, you see new things and you have progression. Dungeons are awesome, you get to use the toolkit of your class.
---
Raiding sucks. It's the same stuff over and over, while you tend to your two button rotation, and wipe because of other retards.
---
All the comments were in this direction but this one convinced me. PvP was in my thoughts since I'm on a PvP realm and world PvP happens a lot. In the end I'll commit to a PvE build and PvP more casually since that is my goal. Thanks everyone for your input.
---
Besides the hit rate modifier thing, its also a really good use of rage for when bloodthirst/ww are on cooldown.  +120 damage to an auto attack after crit/modifiers is like +300 damage atleast.
---
This is pretty much exclusively for dual wield fury. 2H should use improved slam as a rage dump
---
I still think people should show up to raid in their absolute best gear they can get, seeing some people show up to raid in BOE level 40 greens ("Of the Eagle") type stuff is pretty unacceptable. But does it have to be every single piece on some random PreBIS list? No. There is a line between lazy and unlucky.
---
What personal info are you providing something like Discord? It’s not near capable of the level of invasiveness as any of the social media platforms.
---
Bite is more focus efficient, I like having it for that reason. You can weave it in between lightning breath when off cooldown. It's minor, if you don't want to worry about it then just breath is fine.
---
...You realize my post was defending casual players right? My guild is entirely casual, and in no way enforces getting all your PreBIS. I don't see why on earth you wouldn't go for those pieces on your own time though, considering you can only raid once a week. If you're so casual you raid MC in greens and don't play at all for the rest of the week, there's no chance in hell you're going to remain a core raider for a guild pursuing the harder content later on.
---
Also doubling raid time was an exaggeration, but the point is that if you're so undergeared that you're wiping, then it's going to take a lot longer and that will cause problems for people if it goes past the chosen raid time.
---
yes it was a college edition and NO ONE GOT IT. I was screaming at the TV
---
I think the problem is a lot of us are more casual than we realized and we pushed ourselves to get into raids with a group that is more hardcore-oriented than they wanted to admit. I am casual as hell, I don't care if I am never awarded the best loot in a raid... But I also am tired of being told my gear is crap when I have been trying for 3 weeks to get guild runs going and all the of the tanks are too busy or dont want to do anything with me until they need
---
me to heal them. At this point I am about to just reroll warlock or mage because all any group wants is more casters.
---
Fair points.
---
Good lord, I did this flight three times yesterday. Smoked half a joint and played with my doggo, forgot I was even playing WoW, and when I remembered, I was still only half way there :')
---
Yep people were fully aware you could wear leather to boost dps stats, shit half the fury warriors in my guild were using edgemasters.
---
The thing that was different is that those same players would hesitate to roll on said leather over a rogue, because they knew they were going to replace it with plate later.
---
People also PvPed and dueled a lot more, so it was common to prefer gear viable in PvP and raid dps over a lower class upgrade specific to dps.
---
I lose it all to Uber Eats
---
I played during real vanilla like 15 years ago or whatever and it was the exact same back then. Sure we didn't refer to it as "prebis", but people knew about boss loot tables and would still run dungeons specifically for upgrades. It's not like people were happy to run dungeons when they knew ahead of time that there were zero upgrades to be found inside. 
---
Nothing has changed besides the terminology.
---
VC was around in vanilla. Suck it.
---
But doing the private servers get the drop data from original vanilla?
---
Yeah, even if futile, it would be entertaining!
---
"But it's miiiiiiiiiiiiine" - you, probably
---
As well they should because basically every single caster class scales harder with gear than spriest
---
haha, and then the majority of the gear from MC isn't even an upgrade. Zzz.
---
No, it would say "You do not know any flight points connected to this one."
---
You shouldn't be thinking about these things until lvl 50+
---
If all you care about is getting two rolls to match, then the first roll doesnt matter. The second roll just has to be the same as the first. And since you're rolling 1-10,000 the odds of it happening are 1/10,000
---
Nothing sucks more than adults with no attention span.
---
And I didn't say slow. I said not rushed. There is a difference.
---
Wouldn't 'leveling mage starter pack' imply it was for lower levels?  Not for 50s+?
---
I don't care for weird specs raiding Mc, you're right you can just carry them. Thing is this guy masterloots all the good warrior stuff to himself and prolly bottoms dps with it. I don't particularly care either way but it's a scummy thing to do.
---
Last night, I watched the four videos he has, and I’m looking forward to his next one. I really hope he continues making them
---
apparently putting a list together takes all the joy out of getting better gear.
---
I thought it was 30?
---
I don't currently play, but because it's fun?  Beating my dick is fun, but I wouldn't say I'm proud of it is my point
---
There you go 
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/moonglade/Baranor

I'll admit I didn't. I've been under the impression that the 40 mount still needs materials, so I just cruised past looking for the list.

You will continue to gain benefit from hit until 24% as a human with swords/maces. 12% is not "too much", it's just not worth as much as the first 6%

Was suggested a video on YouTube of someone who did it. Didn't see it, though
---
Patch 1.12 makes everything way easier.
---
How are they going to ban spy without breaking a ton of other addons? Spy isnt going anywhere.
---
Fuck these runs. Honestly. Admittedly I'm bad but damn they were hard. One resist and you are fucked.
---
This makes your guild look extremely dumb. What are they called?
---
If what you're saying is true then I would love to see it done, that would be prime entertainment
---
Living essence is going to drop drastically. It was 10-12g on my server just this past weekend. Was already down to 1.5g just a few hours after DM released. Each run you’re getting like 2-3 in DM:East. The only thing keeping these above vendor price, is the new released Hide of the Wild.
---
There were so many mages trying to AoE grind that it was very coming for this tactic to be used to chase away other mages. They don't want to share respawn timers so they run a pack of full health mobs either into the mages almost dead pack, or they just run the pack over the other mage in hopes of having them attack the mage when they run out of range.
---
Yeah I'm pretty cute.
---
I mean, it is hard to have fun when everything you do in game is extremaly easy if you consider yourself by any means a competitive person.
---
Ironic since everything around Reddit is a product of capitalism. Especially our standard of living and development in technology.
---
Mage is probably better if you want to farm gold. Hunters are still good for DM tribute runs.
---
Bladefllurry, AR and hope for the best...

Have you also stopped using anything electronic since a lot of components are made in China?

Countless items in our everyday life can be traced back to China. Yet no one is boycotting Apple or any other company that has ties to China.

This whole virtue signaling thing is ridiculous. Most people here didn't do anything to support Hong Kong prior and are only now claiming to do so because hating on Blizzard is the cool thing to do now.
---
I appreciate you looking past my mistake and giving me info to get me sorted out :)
---
Try listening when they ask you to wait for threat before dpsing.
---
I am fury specced and tank any time it is needed, but the vast majority of dps are so incredibly incompetent at managing threat that I'm considering just refusing unless I know the party from here on out.
---
You are supposed to feel better about yourself, not worse! :D

---
was being facetious, just pointing out how many times i've seen it.
---
and for experience, idgaf about gold i gotta rush to 60.
---
So the really funny thing is that screenshot is taken from Taladril's treatise on druid tanking, in which he states that there is an armor cap at 75%. The tooltip is irrelevant.
---
Maybe do some actual research before telling people they are wrong.
---
There’s a couple ok pieces of loot for mages but overall I wasn’t impressed when I looked through it in atlas.
---
I'm not saying he's possible. I'm simply saying I have seen no proof what so ever of this "mathematically impossible" quote, yet everyone is just stating it as if it's facts.
---
Can confirm. Knew nothing about streamers and rolled on Faerlina. Finally left after a few weeks. Wanna go back though. Really liked my druid there.
---
Yes! That is actually a good idea. I will try to keep that in mind and look for opportunities to do that.
---
Lmao. Strategic griefing
---
I did 5 runs to get my mask, saw 1 orb drop.
---
If people actually could read sarcasm, they'd understand there was no complaining lol I push gear to others. I'll get pieces relatively quickly because of my assistance with gearing others. I passed on the ring last night to give someone else because they needed it more. I play to have fun not have the best spec/class in the game.
---
The benefit would be bragging rights, notoriety, and ad/stream revenue :P  
---
I feel like this will happen too so I'll keep a tab on it. Thanks for the info
---
DruidBar?
---
Well fuck me for playing a class I enjoy right.

I (60 warrior) have been fighting with this chinese farmer mage in my thorium spot for over a week. He's there at least 12 hours a day, non-stop. When I go through that zone and see him with /who I always stop by to pull fresh packs through his blizzards, or even better -- charge into his packs (but don't swing) and drop a fear bomb, scattering the fuckers to pull more.
---
I grief AoE mages of the same faction on sight. Go to a goddamn instance.

Only to magic, I thought.

---
&gt; And I didn't say slow. I said not rushed. There is a difference.

Please elaborate on the difference then.
---
Just watch out for the ICE patrols
---
Depends on a lot of things. Race is huge, since orcs get +axes and humans get +swords which make both those weapons better for those races.
---
Ironfoe (mace) is famously very strong, because of the extra hits=extra rage, and quel'serrar (sword) is a BiS/near BiS sword for a very long time. Axe of the deep woods is also good just because of flat high DPS, and eskandar's right claw (fist) is probably overall BiS for MC/ony because of the attack speed increase.
---
You'll probably need to level multiple weapons, and you'll get different melee weapons while leveling that can be significantly better than other weapon types for a while; so just switch as you get them and level up as many weapons as possible. It doesn't take that long to level new weapons, and you can get a lot of that out the way just while leveling to 60.
---
When I FD I wasn't able to lay a trap; I stayed in combat.
---
Anyway I try to lay a freezing trap on the ground somewhere between the tank and healer, but god knows every time the mob gets frozen (and it doesn't last very long at my current level, like 8-10 seconds I think) it's broken out by some other thoughtless DPS. :&lt;

If you can't see a distinction between taking gear that can't be utilized without a respec and taking gear that is used every day so that my groups can get shit done, there's really not a lot to discuss. As usual, this subreddit is completely detached from the reality you find in-game.

Ain't no warriors getting slagged off for tanking groups and competing for DPS gear lol.

Yeah  I'm not sure how this guy got so triggered by your comment.
---
Vape in-between quests. Barrens will do that to ya
---
I don't understand how wanting to get the best gear is anything different from wanting to get better gear.  This literally makes no sense.  
---
Are you just mad people don't want to run the same dungeons as you or something?
---
I would expect this would be a big deal on the forums, and I haven't seen anything about it.  Are you sure you put your alt's name in the recipient field rather than the toon you were logged in on?  Not saying you're wrong; I'm just skeptocle.
---
These kind of if-then arguments are good to see, they're symptoms of the hand-crafted ecological class balance approach, contrary to the metrics and DPS chart balance approach we see today.
---
There must be similar rules now. Implementation is secondary. If rules are set, they won't be broken so blatantly at least.
---
Otherwise we'll see same bullshit but worse on Kazzak for example.
---
Where are these good raiding guilds you speak of?
---
you kill the king, but nobody else and then you become the new king  (well all 5 of you, so don't think it through too much) anyway all the other ogres become friendly and you can buy some stuff, like good booze and you also can visit 3 of the ogre captains that give long buffs.   And since you are the king now, you get access to the kings treasure chest!
---
Nope, some Hong Kong-dude ive never heard about getting a 6 month-ban doesnt affect me at all.
---
Also, people shouldnt use post video game tournament interviews for political stuff not related to the game. Thats abusing Blizzard to spread propaganda. No matter the situation.
---
Can we stop posting these
---
They're called kiss my ass.
---
Aye, Fury Warrior is definitely they basic bitch spec of Classic. This is probably enlarge due to buggy (or poorly designed) mechanics such as the HS off-hand hit rate bug that makes rage generation a moot point and fury rotation essentially being faceroll, similar to ret pallies in later years. Fury is the no-skill way to top DPS charts and people will always jump on easy band wagons. I'm hoping that Blizzard attempts to address some balance issues in Classic that they never did in original Vanilla but hopes aren't high. 
---
As far as the disparity between arms and fury, later on as PvP gets launched I'm sure Arms will become more popular as it's really the only viable PvP spec for Warriors. Also, if Blizzard fixes the HS 'intended exploit', fury will drop in popularity as well. 
---
I have leveled as arms because it is the most versatile spec and allows me to tank effectively as well as solo grind and quest. Arms tanking has a much higher skill ceiling than prot or fury tank but can produce much higher results in 5 man context than the other two specs. I intend to stay 31/5/15 at 60 until I need the extra threat you can get in deep prot (raid main tanking is the only situation deep prot is useful). Less experienced warriors argue that fury/prot is better, but again it's the skill ceiling of arms/prot that creates this false sense of superiority.
---
Spy literally just parses the combat log. It's not going anywhere.
---
Yeah same with wands, I picked up thunderwood @ lvl 22 for 50s, all of the other 20-30 wants (excluding the 29 stuff obviously) where like 2-3 gold with less DPS. 
---
Even @ 29, unless you're a twink when you see starfaller on for +25 gold and a wand with 2-3 dps less going for ~50s it's hilarious.
---
For a shaman, does LW provide any decent gear for ele/resto?
---
so instead you used an extra letter and basically failed because you are now "razi" and not "raze" at all. gg
---
Yes. Oh I wasn't aware no one knew about Hong Kong. Everyone I talked to has been talking about it for a long time now. I don't think not supporting totalitarian governments is virtual signaling. I figured most people would rather not support human rights violations.
---
You can go thru the lava to skip the first pack of three elementals. When you get to the other side, use ice barrier and fire shield, frost Nova the elementals in place and just loot the core. 
---
No need to even use a single invis pot
---
Not really.  I'm sure you could do fine, but a similarly geared/ability player as combat would be significantly better.  The issue is combat doesn't have many points which aren't useful for increasing dps, but sub has very few abilities which increase damage outside of hemo/deadliness/serated/blade/opportunity.  Hemo with daggers is awful and going that far down for deadliness limits how far into combat you can go.  If you get deadliness, you can't get weapon expertise and nothing in assassination.
---
I'm sure you can do fine if you and the raid understand you aren't going to be the most productive rogue and everyone is ok with that.  Especially this early in WoW not everyone has to be pumping big dick dps to get shit done and it isn't like some terrible combat/sub spec is going to be losing to tanks.  It won't be good, but there's no reason it shouldn't be acceptable unless you are simply awful.  If that's the case it wouldn't matter what spec you are.
---
hit is a fucking meme anyways once you're hit capped crit is twice as valuable. with combat spec rogues only need 1% hit from gear.
---
those "bis" lists are wrong full stop and super misleading for the primarily ignorant player base
---
My god. You have to be trolling. Because I refuse to believe that anybody can be this stupid.
---
Dungeon leveling is pretty straightforward, you go in a dungeon for your level, kill the mobs, go out and reset and repeat. You shouldn’t need a guide to tell you how to level in a dungeon unless you want specific items. Even then you’re at the mercy of RNG. 
---
Open world leveling is different but that’s not what you were asking, for that you can see the comment where the guy posted a guide for rogues but it does not include dungeon leveling.
---
I still don’t understand why everyone wants to follow a guide like some monkeys who saw another monkey do something and they likey what other monkey do.
---
who is this? inactive? crys?
---
That has more to do with the druid class call forcing them into cat form.
---
*healer gear central.  Not much for mages.
---
ANAL [Rupture]
---
If anyone has the warrior discord link I would appreciate it.
---
It isn't "the same", I too played back then, the rule was "bring the best YOU can get", not "the best ANYONE can get". Even then people back then had almost no clue about how to itemize their toons and, for example, I would get harassed for not having 8/8 Lightforge in MC, Lightforge, as a Holy Paladin, wut.  
---
The issue also isn't people wanting to get good gear, that is a huge part of WoW's identity, the issue is in Classic, people have such narrow focus on "PreBISPreBISPreBIS" that they're missing the adventure of going through all the content and playing with "real life people" in an online game (!), you may as well be an NPC to most people. The whole rage against "LFG ruined the game! Anonymous groups are bad! People  you'll never talk to again!" but this is basically what WoW Classic has turned into once you hit around level 50 and only care about checking off boxes of your PreBISPreBISPreBIS list.
---
Yes you can.  The "attunement" is just to use the teleporter.  The original way to get in MC was to actually run your raid through BRD into MC.
---
most of the private server information, mob health / resists and loot tables were assumed and guess work done over years until the community felt it was as close as possible. No server had any official information
---
What exactly is the soft hit cap? I keep seeing different numbers thrown around. For both one hand/2hand and dual wielding
---
I agree with that too. But if said person has like 4-6 items that are pre-raid BIS or 2nd best, and then the rest are still close to being in the top 5 best items for that slot, and then maybe one or two items is a lower level item that's still really good? (like warriors or shamans wearing the Herod helmet that gives strength and crit chance, for example) that's acceptable to me. Especially since we are talking MC here. 
---
Because you still get more value out of someone being there that is dedicated to the group progressing than a random who you just invited to be a warm body. 
---
Gear doesn't equal good numbers if they are not focused and don't care.
---
Human racials suck dick for PvP.
---
Gnomes have Escape Artist and Dwarves have Stone Form.
---
That's pretty much all I do when I go to crater tbh. I don't really enjoy the farming so I come when people call for help with alli gankers. Prob why I'm still on 60% 
---
Also, collusion isn't solidly sitting there while alli kill your faction. Wouldn't be reciprocal for it to be collusion. Would have to help them by killing alliance. So yeah, still mostly pvp.
---
In BRD Lyceum, do the guys that respawn specifically go for the group from wherever they are in the room? If a group finishes a group and drops combat to stealth do they get seen?
---
General questions for a stealth run of BRD.
---
/use itemname
---
I think.
---
Yeah a few races had penalty to xp gain. I think iksar and ogre, maybe troll? Like they only got 90% as much or something like that
---
On in the middle of the day too no less.  It's total trash tv.  Love it.
---
Some of these are useless for the following reasons:
---
&gt;**This is my stance Dance Macro that equips my 2-hander, goes into battle stance, and charges** 
---
When tanking you will often use Charge. There's no reason to have a 2H equip component. Just use a separate keybind to equip 2H.
---
&gt; **This is my other stance dance macro that equips my 1-hander and shield**
---
Same logic as above. You don't always want sword+board when going defensive. For example, in PvP, you will be using Disarm against virtually all melee players. You likely don't want to have to go sword+board for that. This is another extraneous button.
---
&gt;**Whirlwind macro that gets me into Berserker stance and also puts on my weapon and autoattack** 
---
Again, just more wasted button space. Also, when tanking, depending on the damage you're taking, it's very common to switch to Zerker real fast, use Zerker Rage, then switch back to defensive. When doing this, the above macro is useless.
---
&gt;**Charge and Hamstring Macro from any stance**
---
Because pressing Charge, then Hamstring is so tough.
---
How many extraneous buttons/keybinds do you have for all these? Seems very superfluous and unnecessary.
---
Around 55 or so, you should start attunement quests. If you prefer running dungeons and farming for pre-raid BIS gear, then BRD is a good place to start for all classes. BRD/LBRS/DM are all doable before 60. Start with BRD and move to LBRS when closer to 57.
---
Well Reddit is very broken about BoEs. I agree that you should only need if you want to wear it. 
---
But Reddit seems to think you should roll need on expensive BoEs because everyone "needs" gold.
---
when talking about evil i was considering something more systemical, with a purpose that deviates practicality.
---
For example, druids going out to kill for fun can be considered evil, going out as a part of a training regimen or hunting it is not even if they enjoy the killing itself either case.
---
Chaotic has less to do about legislation and more to approach to traditions and affects, including the ones of others when extendeable to the character itself. A chaotic character might abide laws or have close friend it cares about, the chaotic part manifests on how much vaule puts in these and how much propoense might be to breaking them. Not every chaotic character is a somebody that would push a granny on the road on sight.
---
That sais, they are aligments. They are barebone, irrealistic applications used to give an idea how npcs act. In fact it's not used everywhere, and even the recent edition of dungeons and dragons almost dropped its use entirely for player characters since it's more constraining than useful.
---
&gt; For a druid it really isn't hard. 
---
Odd, I have Bis and only slightly over 11k armor.  You need stoneskin potion + inspiration buff to pull it off.   The uptime of inspiration on the alliance will be so low it's laughable.
---
They will, but not for a couple weeks as you need gear.  
---
Also, there was a long time in vanilla before a quality strategy for him emerged.
---
Go to Darkshore and take two boats to Dustwallow and then fly to Ratchet.
---
58? I stopped grinding quests at 50 then hopped in dungeons. You usually can do mara and sunken temple at 50. 52 you can do brd arena. 55 you can do all of brd. 58 you can do brs scholo strat. May aswell start getting gear early kill 3 birds with 1 stone. Pick up the dungeon quests for some extra xp.
---
Any hit after 6% (at 305 or more weapon skill) is basically a 0.5-0.6% damage increase, so crit is better.
---
There are a ton of people arguing nonsense under your comment but I agree with you. I got my hit cap from other items. My DPS is on par if not better than some of these rogues that decided to spend the gold on the set before even trying to farm items
---
I tried to tank. No guild needed prot warriors. So now i am a dps. I still tank dungeons but thats about it. Fury is so badass, i am happy with my decision.
---
I see the "give a man a fish" crowd has arrived.
---
exactly what I was pointing out, tehre's a lot of mobs that have some pretty anti paladin and anti druid tendencies especially in BWL. Gets a bit better in Naxx(there are other problems here though), AQ is a mixxed bag.
---
Hey OP, google Dunning-Kruger affect
---
I work 25 hours a day, have 3 wives with 4 kids each. I have one day off a week but I spend it volunteering at my local homeless shelter. 
---
I just hit 60 last week with epic mount bought, 1k gold to spare. Have all maxed professions and secondaries. Also have a level 50 alt and 3 level 35 x-mute alts. 
---
Thank you so much classic wow. I’ve already got my full BIS from rag/ony and I’m probably gonna take a break until P2. Maybe work on my alt. Ya he’s only level 50. I just don’t have much time.
---
It's just his guild.  Don't worry.  Shitty guilds like that usually die.
---
On the bright side of all this, you should take pleasure knowing these wankers won't amount to shit in a few years time and will likely lead miserable lives as they get older.
---
Nah I love this shit. I love drama that doesnt affect me. It's juicy
---
And yet, with any half decent tank and salvation, warriors outdamage rogues at every stage of the game, AQ and Naxx included. If you deny this you're probably a rogue who's worried that no one will take them to AQ and Naxx because there's no tier gear to funnel (spoilers: you will be taken everywhere unless you're in a super tryhard guild)
---
One button intercept, charge, disarm and overpower macros were pretty essential for me.
---
Wow, I wasn't one of those people so my comment proves nothing.  You are bored and looking for a fight on the internet.  Fuck off.
---
Hades on Herod is similar.
---
There is **one** Hades guild that Cobus runs, the one that is just "Hades". However, we get crap from people in Hades II and Hades V doing stupid shit.
---
The funniest part is when they are normal size 90% of the time, but they eat a bigman mushroom before every boss fight.
---
Keep it up dude! Keep saving
---
How do you get in? Select an RP server at login! Voila!
---
He's not stupid, he just has money IRL. He then spends 10-20 minutes composing a post on Reddit. If it had worked, and the decision had been reversed, he would have felt quite pleased with himself for having gotten away with it.
---
Yeah! The only thing they dont have yet is raid frames
---
Someone should fix that guide.
---
More like pity.
---
Good eye!  I'll give it an install after work and see how it goes.
---
Blizzard devs confirmed it was DM.  No horde EVER called it VC in Vanilla.
---
Lol I didn't know what I was looking at for a bit. Then I realized it was taking dead center
---
Thank you! I wanted to make sure. I appreciate the comment.
---
Never come across this mentality before. Also just because you are dagger spec for ambush doesn't mean you cannot macro swap in combat.
---
Don’t take it so serious.
---
I absolutely agree, they totally need to add DM as the abbreviation for Dire Maul.
---
As a mage player, mages have every right to AoE and other players have every right to fight them for the resources. It makes the game more fun.
---
For lowbies, I never got mages who would AoE at quest spots and not group with other people. When I was levelling my mage to 60 I would just invite people to group if it was for quest mobs and tell them to sit down while I finished their quest for them real quick, then buff them and send them on their way with food and water. You get less of an interruption from questers and they get what they need
---
That's more or less what I was doing as Shadow.
---
Lol are Holy damage spells really that useless?
---
Not on Deathwing or firetree.
---
There are a couple items others didn't mention that are good.  If you are horde there is Rune of the Guard Captain, a trinket with ap and hit from a hinterlands quest; Tarnished Elven Ring with agi and hit from Dire Maul Tribute (non unique so you can have 2); Impervious Giant, a 2h mace from the BRD with hit, crit, and armor; And the devilsaur leggings/gauntlet 2 piece set with ap, stam, hit, and crit.
---
I can't relax to this because I keep expecting YOU FACE JARAXXUS
---
Lol this is why nobody invites warlocks to groups.
---
If I was replying to someone that made an intelligent, well thought out comment, I would do that. But when in Rome...
---
Based on the fact that you didnt "no life" to 60 the first week, waiting a few more weeks to focus on school won't change the game for you at all.
---
I still see a ton of Alliance running around in IF. I saw more Alliance than Horde at Dire Maul yesterday.
---
We called it VC on horde on spirestone
---
I am fairly new to WoW, I played a little bit 14 years ago but never got into it. I didnt know if there was such a thing or not.
---
Or you could just drink between pulls...
---
Before Phase 2?  P2 launched yesterday.
---
Yeah, FR totem + LBRS buff. I think FR totem adds 60 and LBRS buff adds another 80 or so. Should definitely pick up the LBRS buff. We haven't gone too far out of our way to gear for FR - there are crafted pieces that aren't terribly hard to craft, like leather belt and such, that would take us even further. We've been saving onyxia head buff for rag, so we get that and then pick up LBRS buff as well to maximize our chances of doing a one shot.
---
I'm not fighting anyone.
---
Don't be, OP was a liar.
---
Had a warlock yesterday who kept dying. Then he kept complaining Icouldn't hold aggro, he does "mad deeps" etc. But he was the only one dying. Life tapping then just going ham.
---
I kept explaining. Eventually he started calling me a "dumb drood" and saying mean shit. I ignored him and finished the run.
---
But man. Some runs make you feel awesome as a tank. And others make you want to quest.
---
And I LOVE dungeon running. And I USUALLY LOVE tanking. But one bad party member is all you need to have a bad time, since you're basically the parent keeping the kids in check.
---
Torch room is fine, resists and misses on the boss is the problem. I don’t think anyone is saying a 54 DPS can’t finish BRD, it’s just not recommended and they’re going to need to be carried somewhat.
---
I see a lot of people talking about how boring the content is. Yeah, it's easy and it's been solved for more than a decade, but if you're bored in your raids it's your problem, not the game's. My raids are a blast.
---
Hilariously, the most "hardcore" minded guy in my guild, who constantly complains about how boring the encounters are, dies on every encounter to the extremely avoidable mechanics MC is known for. I see his avatar every time I read people whinging here about how boring the content is.
---
If you have 13 points in prot you can tank most dungeons.  When we are talking about holy shock vs blessing of sanctuary, it is pertinent to examine the usefulness to a tank.
---
One shotting people at half health is the definition of unfair. :D
---
Corehound belt but its boe
---
In honesty there's not an awful lot of content in phase 2 that you'd lose out on by being a few weeks behind. Also school &gt; wow.
---
The best thing about Classic is that it will always be there my friend.
---
I initially regretted going from Herod to earthfury. Server was dead as fuck and totally 1 sided. Then a couple ally guilds came over and that shit is popping. I’m loving it.
---
Also the earthfury discord pvp channel is some top level banter.
---
It's not like people spent a lot of time in Org in BC or Wrath.
---
Deadmines= DM 
---
And it will be forever!
---
Corpse run reset why? I may have heard about an mage that paid one month on a second account just to reset Mara, leveled 46 - 53 there, never gonna step on that dungeon again. :)
---
I am trying this one. So far so good.  As a hunter is there a way to have my pets happiness level shown?  I can't find it.
---
Read my prior comments. A little extra care and a little less trigger happy dps goes a long way in a pug.
---
The pre-BiS guides give me a good laugh. I have tons of other rogues asking me shit like "Why are you wearing 4 piece of shadowcraft? Why is your %hit from gear so low? Why are you using daggers?" and they can't pull above 170 DPS without popping CDs.
---
I love these posts, please don’t stop
---
highest pop, perfect faction balance, most/fastest MC clears etc etc etc. Can't think of a category where it isn't the best unless you'd rather not play with/against above average players. That's the only argument I could get behind for not wanting to play on Fae
---
Lol the fury rotation is harder than any other dps classes ive looked up. None of the dps rotations are hard.
---
Blizzard has done a lot of stupid things lately.
---
It's DM... You can stay LFM/LFG as long as you like saying VC.
---
School should always come first. Don’t choose a game over your future.
---
For melee, the important thing to have a /startattack component. When you tab to a new target, you won't always be autoattacking. This can get messy dealing with multiple mobs being aoe'd down, dying at various intervals, etc. This ensures your autoattack is on pretty much all the time.
---
Not in WoW that's for sure.
---
I'm pretty certain that the first guild to clear MC only had like 20 people at level 60, wearing mostly green items from leveling. 1.12 makes us stronger than before, and everyone knows what to do.
---
Find a guild you can have fun with. People gquit for not getting a raid spot on raid night, and they didnt know come raid night that they weren't going? That's beyond unorganized. It may as well be a pug at that rate. My guild had a roster weeks in advance.
---
Dude, back in 2004 I played a pally. Back then i thought doing anything in the game other than PvP was for carebear nerds. Including professions. So i was always broke. I always sold my off set stuff to repair the gear i was wearing. I sold so many things I would have liked to keep, including Quel'Serrar
---
I believe sixtyupgrades.com has some default templates
---
Download:
---
Atlas Loot Classic
---
It’ll almost all the items I think? And you can favourite the items and view them in a separate menu? 
---
Hope that helps somewhat
---
You can't just start a guild with a loot council though. Anyone who's doing it well started the expansion with the majority of the people they needed trying to level quickly.
---
If you do it now without that large base you have nobody's trust.
---
Nothing a pi weaving priest can’t do for a warlock. 
---
Power infusion shadow weaving spec. 
---
Basically rank 1 mindflay to get the stacks up, bubble priority (dragon breath/bombs), dispel priority healing priest. 
---
Probably the most difficult spec to manage everything, and the lowest on the healing meters typically. But imo still more useful than a full on spriest...
---
Why did you not enjoy it? 
---
* Was it the drama?
---
* Was it the lack of challenge (you 1 shot all bosses)?
---
* Was it the lack of gear upgrades?
---
You listed off a couple things, but you’re not telling us why you didn’t enjoy yourself. 
---
If it’s the drama, find a different guild. 
---
If it’s the lack of challenge, maybe wait to phase 3, or play retail? Honestly, classic content isn’t very mechanically difficult. 
---
If it’s the lack of gear, that’s just being unlucky.
---
No, it didn’t.
---
You send in your pet (with dash/dive disabled), as soon as it hits, you call it back. By doing this your pet will run on top of princess until she either throws a rock or starts farting again, and then you just repeat it.
---
I know I was asked to go shadow from holy. I told them I won't do disc weave. It was shadow so I can pvp too or holy

Man just download Questie and go where the quests are. Make the game an adventure, not a chore!
---
Looking for advice on an alt to roll. Leaning towards druid but see below questions.
---
Mostly focused on the level grind, tanking dungeons, and some BG fun once those release.
---
Druid:
---
Are they sufficient enough tanks during the 1-60 dungeons?
---
How do they compare to warriors during that range?
---
Is there a spec that facilitates both tanking and solo leveling?
---
Are they pure flag runners in BGs later or are they fun in other aspects of BGs (AV?)?
---
Yah and it's ridiculously low at 21k. In raids you're expected to be popping pots and such and with inspiration and other buffs from other classes expect to hit it very early on.
---
It says VC = Van Cleef which the dungeon Deadmines was used *interchangeably* with VC.
---
Sounds like you need a backstory.
---
well if you are in MC already as a guild, you are not exactly casual.
---
see ya.
---
Btw, you can get the ww axe at 30 if you get some help.   
---
Tusks are from lvl 33-ish mobs.  Randoms farming elementals will often allow you to group up for the elemental charms (lvl 38-ish mobs) or they’re available on the AH.   
---
And, most importantly, it’s part of the warrior code to stop and help anyone who wants to kill Cyclonian.   (You just have to pay it forward when you’re the one who is high level.).  Other bored high level players may also help.
---
Had my first Diva Tank experience since coming back to Classic yesterday.
---
Doing Sunken Temple, everything going well. Trash is dying super fast then the pulls stop. So I start going to the next pack, sap, engage, etc. We clear a couple more packs.
---
"Any chance I'm going to be allowed to pull?" The tank says. Oh boy here we go... I think. I say nothing.
---
We sit around for a few minutes idle because the tank is having his little moment. Eventually he pulls the next pack. He's using a 2 hander and can't hold threat on any target, not even the primary.
---
I decide now is the time for the dealbreaker and post one sentence in chat.
---
"Any chance you can tank?"
---
Tank ragequits. I wait a few minutes and join another group and we clear the entire dungeon in no time.
---
Exactly. At that point it’s harassment.
---
queuing heroic strike makes it so your off hand cannot miss, the DW talent is for your off hand damage, it would be dumb to play DW fury without that maxed
---
Most warriors don't go for the softcap on def either.  So, they only have a slightly higher chance to be crit.   Furthermore, their much higher Effective health mitigates the crushes and crits.
---
There is a script you can use that will recall your totems, I don't have it offhand though as I'm currently at work
---
Wonder if one of them had two heads.
---
Same with ZF gy up to 52 and LBRS. 60k/hr is kinda slow.
---
I agree as long as you’re upfront about it, don’t want to confuse people or make others angry. But you’re completely justified
---
Are you being intentionally naive or something? You aren't killing "other people", you are intentionally killing your own faction, how does that not qualify as griefing to you?
---
You say something to the group then, it really is not that hard.
---
Have you ever looked up how layering worked? That is not true... they increased the server capacity with layering.
---
It isn't like your entire server is going to see this thread. If you are worried about your rep, how does a handful of replies here help?
---
I layered my alt when I invited it not 20 minutes ago.
---
The last part about raid icons is info I’ve been looking for for a while ! How to find an NPC once targeted .... thanks.
---
I think us warriors are kind of exempt from this. We need to tank a lot even if we don't have it as our main spec. If they don't like us rolling on tank gear they can see all of us stop and enjoy the even way longer wait for a tank. For the health of the game we need that gear.
---
Now someone is finally getting it!
---
It’s /equip itemname
---
/equip itemname 
---
/wait     (Will wait for one global cooldown)
---
/shield bash
---
I’m missing a line for changing stances since I can’t remember it off the top of my head. You’ll have to look that one up, sorry!
---
Plus you will get that sweet rested experience and have a better time leveling once you're back!
---
If nothing else, post it to your server's subreddit - not the general one.

As long as you let people know ahead of time it's fine, if you just take all the dps and tank items without saying anything first that's kinda dickish.
---
If you are choosing between two weapons with the same dps the slower one is slightly better because heroic strike will crit a bit harder but when the difference in dps is 5 or more you want to take the higher dps. Especially if it has better stats too
---
The point is if you think a mage rolling on plate is the same as a druid volunteering to tank but rolling on gear for their main spec (healing) then you're pretty dumb. Don't need to get much more into than that.
---
I agree with you on the tank part but healer ? If you take truestrike healing as pala in ubrs I swear to god I'll end you
---
This right here. No, you won't be missing anything and you'll have a double exp bonus waiting for you when you return!
---
No one here has ever once said anything about you.
---
Alright kids, I know people say rep is super important, but its not that serious. Relax. Nobody on your server is going to give a shit
---
Its not too much per se, but if you can drop some hit for a decent ap and crit it would probably improve your dps. It may not be possible, though; the standard bis list has a lot if hit because stuff like truestrike and unforgiven just have lots of useful stats.
---
Is Stratholme Holy Water in the game yet?
---
There is a quest about mid way through to create an ogre suit and fool one of the guards and some other hints - this as well known
---
Thats fine but like you said Alliance doesn't have Windfury so no 2 handed weapon spec is top DPS for a super hardcore PVE guild making BRE only relevant in two ways:
---
1. PVP
---
2. Offtank weapon
---
I've seen lots of Shammys say that ele is faster than enh once you get to 43 or so.  I didnt want to level as a caster and really just overall enjoy enhance more.
---
So, I went 1-60 as enhance and  I didn't feel it ever slowed down massively, 42-47 was a bit of a slow stretch (and I'm sure ele outperforms enh from 42-50 or so) and I felt pretty under powered but once I got into Mara and got myself a new weapon + some upgrades I started smashing stuff again.  50-60 I absolutely flew through, as I got better at my DPS rotation and didnt have to drink nearly as much.

I think it's you who has to look up how layering works my friend.
---
You need to go to school to pay for WoW, so go to school.
---
Bro daggers rogue is suffering.
---
Fuckers using swords talking about how much they can't wait for Dal'Rend and what not but as soon as Felstriker drops suddenly everyones daggers specced.
---
Fair Critique lol
---
Bleh I don't run dungeons much and if I have to grind out BFD 2-4 times to get some gear I'd rather just buy the 50s one that has 95% of the DPS and be on with my day!
---
Plus getting the gravestone pre-20 is tough anyways so it was easier to just go to the AH for an upgrade.
---
Also I have a pretty casual playstyle on my warlock and I'll generally just dot up and wand-afk while watching something or browsing the internet.
---
I was so skint at vanilla, it took me ages to get a mount. Don’t know why but I’m Classic I now have 85g at level 30. Been farming like a madman rather than levelling to get the sodding mount, and in the process forgetting about actually having fun doing quests!
---
Layering also reduced the strain on the server which theoretically allowed for a higher player cap, whether or not they actually increased the cap nobody knows. These arguements are stupid because nobody truly knows the answer
---
I dare. And fight every single horde on the way
---
Those damn elemental fire / rock trash packs (usually 4 of them total) so often kill our melee or stun the tank after banish then run off and kill someone, that we didn't want to waste head buff on the easy content. We're running with 40 (not quite enough to do a 30/30 split yet) so everything is suuuper easy, except rag. I mean rag is easy to - we usually one shot him, just, it's by far the most difficult fight, so we want to make sure we get it on the first try.
---
He’s not exaggerating too much. This guy is basically a meme on Tfury, constantly spamming runs with orbs, etc. reserved and getting in fights in LFG
---
Let’s go!
---
I've read rank 4 is the sweet spot for druids. It's what I use. Now, I need to spend an hour playing with ranks to see.
---
I mean, assuming you were running MC in the early stages of Vanilla's life, +Spell damage and +healing simply didn't exist. So, ya, Lightforge was probably the best you *could* get.
---
Pleasure from raiding (for me at least) is 60% social, 30% challenge and 10% loot chance.  That’s why I find MC in a PUG utterly mind numbing.
---
So why does an Arms Warrior deserve it in PVP more than Ret Paladin?
---
It's really dumb but only works on certain FPs. If the thing Flys close enough and actually touches the FM it will let you, but 75% of the time it swoops over the FM and doesn't actually count as a land
---
I'm level 42 haven't got a mount and only got 42g I can't sell shit on the AH and I'm not wasting more fees tkewp putting stuff up,
---
Guess I'll get mine when I can loot 100g
---
But just like real life, you can make a lot of money with that
---
&gt; brand new account logged in from a VPN, bought gold and then traded it to him and then never logged in again.
---
Jeez now I know what to do if I ever want someone's account banned. Who's gonna turn down free gold?
---
As a druid I was afraid that once my HoTs start removing crusader procs raid leader starts kicking resto druids out of roster, including me. Ifc I can heal only with regrowth and healing touches, but sometimes rejuvenation is required on tanks.
---
I look forward to seeing how this changes when p2 drops.
---
Jesus man... we're answering your question. If you want to "ever changing story throughout the world and with the guild and through RP events" then you need to join an rp guild on an rp server and to do that you need to create your character's backstory. 
---
&gt; All the help I have ever received about this stuff has been very minute
---
Because that's the actual answer. Like what else do you want? We can't tell you a guild because that's dependent on your server which is dependent on your region. Pick a RP server in your region, create a backstory for your character, find a rp guild on your server, and and ask if they host the type of events and story you want to participate in. If they do then join them. That's all there is to it lol.
---
P1 yes, P5/6, probably not.
---
Sucks, but theres really no way to farm this stuff specifically. Just gotta pray to RNGesus. I only know of one item which is the Green Lens (engineering cloth hat) that can be farmed until you craft the "of shadow wrath" version.
---
Good point
---
Even in a dungeon setting where I'll have 100% backstab time? I figured daggers would be more dps than swords, but I'm new to classic
---
Hey I’m on Smolderweb! I just left a terrible guild. I need a new home.
---
If someone is competing with me for resources I'm gonna try to plank them... They're not "on my team," they have the same faction tag as me but if two mages are competing for the same AoE spot to level faster, why would they not try to kill each other and drive each other away?
---
Is it because of dire maul that qeues soared? Mograine was normally a qeue of maximum 20 mins yesterday it was about 30 mins and now its pushing an hour.
---
Fury is just better dps. Regardless of what weapon you're using. Read what flurry does, arms just can't compete. Dual wielding is better DPS at 60 especially with better gear. 2 weapons attacking crit more, more crits more flurry uptime. Bloodthirst also scales better than MS in pure damage. There's also the fact that mortal strike takes up 1 of the 16 debuff slots on raid bosses and no one wants that.
---
The only real reason to be arms at 60 is for PvP.
---
Tauren feral druids have been bigger dicks to me than undead rogues. They always jump me when I'm fighting a mob and at 50% hp. Next for underrated douches are Shadow priests. I think undead rogues only gank you if your level is greyed out or you have res sickness. Which is honestly less frustrating to die to than a feral druid who stalked you for miles just to kill you while you're fighting something else.
---
&gt; Weapons of the same type are treated as if they have the same swing speed for instant cast abilities like mortal strike.
---
Only true for calculating AP applied to the swing. The slower weapon *will* hit harder with instant attacks. This is easy to verify.
---
Are you sure you're spelling Hunter's Mark correctly?  Because /petattack doesn't interfere with spells on macros in any way, you can add it to just about any macro without a problem.
---
It should just be
---
#showtooltip
---
/cast Hunter's Mark
---
/petattack
---
Wow this is so lame. Chalk up another reason why I don't play on PvP servers. World pvp is cool but too many people ruin and exploit it to make it not fun at all.
---
Blizz won't do anything about it probably but I hope I'm wrong.
---
I've known this for a couple weeks and still take the long way for some reason. Force of habit I suppose.
---
But layering did increase the server cap and blizzard has said it will increase the server cap. They increased the server cap to prevent dead servers later on. Layering was implemented because blizzard expected a large player drop off.
---
Tanks should be able to roll on anything.  Druid tanks should be able to roll on healing gear because thats what they will do in raids.  If a warrior is tanking they should be able to roll on dps gear if that's what they are going to do.  If a dps warrior rolls on tanking that's absolute bullshit.
---
Which is quite a lot of warriors in my experience as a rogue.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/discord-servers#classic-discord-servers 
---
You can find the link there!
---
If everyone is new the the vanilla raid scene you are going to want to pick up some randoms for a full 40.
---
&gt; and certainly nowhere near enough of a difference to double a raid's DPS output.
---
You aren't in combat 24/7. Literally doubling DPS STILL wouldn't make your raid actually go twice as fast.
---
The GM of EJ is the Game Director for a reason.
---
*every phase. Fury is better DPS with any weapon in 1.12.
---
Try to Shazam the music in game lol, might work
---
&gt; Quit spewing nonsense.
---
&gt; 
---
Let's see the difference between a mage that stack as much intell as he can and the mage that stack SP, i'm sure there will be no difference at all.
---
Same for Melee and hit gear.
---
You're clueless.
---
Link can be found here: https://www.wowhead.com/discord-servers#classic-discord-servers
---
Does anyone know if you can still get into Hyjal with the old tricks? And if they have the no man's land teleport in play?
---
And also, if Blizz intends to ban people who get in, if they can?
---
Apart from one singular instance in which I said only one sentence I've never had any issue whatsoever so I doubt it.
---
Game has an ingame clock, was apparently first added in later expansions.
---
&gt; Not just one person, but an entire raid of 40 people wearing shit gear
---
Gear isn't "shit" just because it's not "preBiS".
---
You have no idea what you're talking about. The scepter is a quest reward that you get for running it once and is a huge power spike over any AH wand. Priests and Warlocks should get it ASAP in their early 20s
---
?
---
Dickish is expecting someone greeding on dps gear during lvling. No sorry its not dickish its actually beyond retarded
---
Oh like how you response to everyone who disagreed with you? k
---
Power Infusion. Some guilds will stack PI on one person to get them at the top of public logs to make them look a lot better than they actually are.
---
Honestly, anyone can do it, but he did a really poor job of making a video for the "every" class.
---
Upon entering, kill the dog, everyone can do this
---
Avoid the patrols, you can get past all of them, without blinking and without agroing. Normally I swing far left around the pack and up the wall to wait for patrols to move to where you want them. Anyone who agros that pack and doesn't have nova, sprint vanish evasion etc. Is going to eat a daze and die. Especially inexperienced players using this guide.
---
So you jump down top off before every swim, you can avoid that ele in the lava swimming to the left. Most classes will die trying to solo that especially if ungeared.
---
Top you hp off at the island, don't agro the 3, swim the rest of the way. If you suck at lava jumping to avoid damage, do yourself a favor and pack some Fire absorb pots. It will take longer because of the CD but you wont risk dying.
---
Do the 2 invis pot strat, get the core go home.
---
still don't buy it. to me a true PvP guild would never cross faction collude. against everything PvP is.
---
you're trying to frame it as were just a PvP guild trying to farm ungoro when you are an ungoro mafia guild. at the very least own it and don't try and make it seem like its just normal pvp guild stuff.
---
That's genuinely one of the most interesting posts I've ever read in this website. It's always great to see people being smart about their situation instead of just indulging in self-loathing.
---
Sure dawg. Math and shit is a lie. Fake news.
---
I gave my opinion to OP, relevant to his question.
---
I see I struck a chord with you, but I wasn't referring to anyone directly or personally, although at this point, I can guess why you felt like it was an attack against you...
---
I'm not sure what was the purpose of your comment, really. I get that you disagree with me, and that's fine, but once again, there are better ways to voice a disagreement than going full *ad hominem* on someone.
---
Again, let me know if you want to join the adults in a mature conversation, otherwise, please abstain from replying.
---
I haven't found any actual source saying it did or didn't, but if I had to guess I'd say layering did allow for a higher cap
---
anathema is one of smaller servers, being a relief server. A lot of the people in the raids still aren't level 58 yet, nevermind hitcapped.
---
He’s prob not exaggerating too much. This guy is basically a meme on Tfury, constantly spamming runs with orbs, etc. reserved and getting in fights in LFG
---
i thought y'all be clc from tichondrius, you know, from the glorious bg9 days, don't worry my dude
---
Maybe next time, Tomganks
---
Who said anything about getting geared "over" anyone else? I'm not reserving shit lol. 
---
I ask for the ability to compete for main role gear which I use every day, and in exchange I enable my group to run the instance. 
---
I haven't had a single pug reject this proposal, because I'm often raising their chances from 0 to a coin flip. 
---
And when I'm with my guild that I've played with for the better part of 15 years, we all have the same mentality about loot. If it's going to be used, it helps the collective. I guess most people don't have the luxury of playing with friends who see the big picture, and that kind of sucks.
---
Unless I'm way off base, there's no such thing as wait in a macro.
---
In fact, I am pretty sure /wait is an emote.  Will confirm when I'm home.
---
For stances its just /cast or use spellname, not sure if there's a distinction for physical skills or not.
---
The point within an example is not always there to say they're exactly the same, it is generally used to show how things are similar. I wouldn't call someone dumb because I assumed a comparison was an equivalency.
---
Yea as a healer, I'm just happy a fair amount of my BIS are items only the healer will need on.  I ain't gonna get greedy and ruin some casters 2 hour dungeon run.
---
And you should know that it was removed. What's once was isn't always what it is today
---
found the idiot
---
Ya made no sense there homie
---
or he'll do neither, which is what his comment implied moron
---
Because he licked a lot of corporate boots and drank the koolaid?
---
Yeah that’s all I want. Kill shit faster lol
---
Idk man, why couldn’t you take a screenshot without the “UI hidden” text?!
---
Which is not how layering works, a server is layered or its not layered per blizzard. A server that is not layered will never get layered anymore and a server that no longer needs layers will never get layered either.
---
Are there any cons to making my bank alt an Alchemist and sending him all the herbs from the main?
---
I'm sorry, you didn't form your answer in the form of a question...
---
Shadoweave mask is 44.
---
Quest until 55 and then spam BRD until 60.
---
You're fine.  A lot of phases are designed to actually make it easier to catch up.  The blue gear that gets released from 5 mans becomes better and better to help you get to raids quicker.
---
Species is a spectrum now. Be supportive.
---
We liked having a feral for fights that the OT was afk most of it with long bouts between needing them to tank. It was either use a feral who liked playing feral or one of the warriors. Both work, the feral wanted to do it though.  The biggest problem heading towards naxx was likely your warrior was going into the fury/prot stage with thunderfury. Threat.. started to become a lot less of an issue no matter who was tanking rofl.
---
holyshit lmao nicely done
---
I don't know if that is entirely accurate as a few functions don't work that definitely would for legion. I think it's more like they built it off the oldest surviving tech they still had available and filled in the blanks with legion.
---
Lol yes they did.
---
With layering = x layers worth of normal server populations in the world.
---
Without layering = 1 layer worth of normal server population in the world.
---
It's not rocket science. Layering increased the concurrent player cap.
---
...unless you actually believe Blizzard intended for the game to support 50k players in the world LOL (when original server sizes were 3k).
---
"I ask for the ability to compete for main role gear which I use every day, and in exchange I enable my group to run the instance." 
---
That changes everything man, you were not clear about that in this chain. 
---
"I guess most people don't have the luxury of playing with friends who see the big picture, and that kind of sucks."
---
Those are some big and quite frankly boastful assumptions lol... weird flex, most of us have friends haha... And when I tanked on a druid w/ friends (was a raid healer) I always let my healer have dibs on healing gear because ik its the right thing to do. If I want healing gear I can heal the damn dungeon latter w/o a 50% loot tax on my heals.
---
Who cares?
---
Fury Warr is the best DPS class in 1.12. You sound salty.
---
Layering is dynamic.  Log in at 9am and there are 0 servers layered.  Log in at 8pm on Friday night and see how it goes.
---
&gt; 4 spell power is not worth 130 g.
---
*Especially* when it's going to get replaced in MC, Ony, or even BWL.
---
Now if it was BIS until late Naxx or forever, then *maybe* you could argue that having that extra 4sp is justifiable.
---
Yeah. It's a dumb meme. Dire Maul was always referred to with the relevant wing that was being tackled for that run or the purpose. Tribute, Warlock quest, full clear, etc.
---
Our mistake is rising to the baiting. Trolls know Redditors are prone to argue just the "um...actually..." of it all.
---
Oh sorry, there’s recipes and other things tied behind the reputation
---
What I have found most people do (the right way) is if everyone else passes on an item or just selects "greed" the person will ask the group "Hey, do you mind if I need this for my tank/healer set?" and no one has ever had a problem with that as far as my experiences have been.
---
Truefaith is bis until aq or 8/8 t2. You also dont look like crap, totally worth.
---
Nice demonstration of how there are plenty of assholes too
---
Those 8-11% numbers are def nowhere near my experience in running for them so, but ofc it's very limited dataset (about 15 x 4 kills) - I really do feel like the drop stats are not factoring in the 50+% no drops that's been my experience with the 4 of them.
---
As a lvl 36 warlock, should I grab the Enchanted Gold Bloodrobe? I am currently wearing Necrology Robes. I am not a tailor, I am engineering and mining, so Robes of Power are not an option. The Robes of Arcana are on AH for about 1.8g.
---
Side question: should I attempt to make a Green Lens of Shadow Wrath or just look to buy one? I have the Engineering lvl required now and a guildie tells me it is pre-bis.
---
Oooooohhh! There you go. Makes perfect sense now.
---
Since right clicking is pretty easy I didn't see why this was needed, but during an AOE clusterfuck a macro must help a lot.
---
you don't have bash?? wtf..why?
---
Just look at good druid pvpers on youtube and see what they do, I would recommend Javel if you want to stick to balance/resto.
---
[Laughs in warlock]
---
Oh look personal attacks. Why am I not suprised that's immediately what someone who disagrees with another person has to resort to.
---
My point is the whole boycott Blizzard thing is idiotic and baseless.
---
If people really cared about the issues and wanted to support the citizens of Hong Kong they would be calling on their elected officials. They would stop supporting companies who actually deal with China.
---
But no I get it "boycotting" a video game company over their decision to let someone go who breached a contract clearly makes more sense.
---
They have different weapon speeds don't they?
---
Yes. 305 weap skill plus precision  means you only need 1% to hit yellow cap.
---
Extra hit helps white damage, but other stats(like ap or crit) help both white and yellow damage.
---
I'm pretty sure I did a SFK with Bonedady last night. Mage?
---
agree 100% as rogue here, lots of warriors winning my prebis but I wouldn't have cleared the dungeon without dps warriors tanking
---
I used to really enjoy eating. Loved to try every possible thing. Now I only eat stuff I can eat while playing. Hail Hot Pockets.
---
Also, how do you know how a casual guild's run time is if, according to you, no raiding guild is casual currently?
---
My PVP policy is pretty simple too. If I encounter you I ask you to call it. You have to call it. 1-50 or 51-100. Just call it. The way I see it is, if the PvP policy you followed brought you to this, of what use was the PvP policy?
---
Yea I never understood all the arguing around how to distribute loot. Rolls for each class, mandatory pass if you already have the item (unless everyone else does to). Break the rules, gkick. End of story.
---
Haha ya thats why I always kid around anytime I see it, just give everyone a hard time no matter which side they're on hahaha 
---
I'm just a troll I guess xD
---
I think OP just wants others to hand hold him to “epic” events to be a fly on the wall just so he can say “I was there when that epic thing happened!”
---
I doubt he has any real intentions to partipate in RP
---
And if you miss, you will lack all damage, and you will miss a lot.
---
You do not get more rage from a faster weapon, rage generation is normalized. So a slow weapon will get more rage per hit than a fast weapon, but the fast weapon hits more so it equals out to the same thing.
---
The items listed are different though, because they operate independently from attack speed. Extra attack speed items (iskhander) still generate the rage based on their base attack speed, so it's effectively a 30% rage generation buff while active. Ironfoe on the other hand, will give you triple rage for some attacks, and HoJ will occasionally give double, because they got an extra hit (so more rage per second than what the base weapon attacks give).
---
Pages 7 and 9 in the official World of Warcraft strategy guide, published by a Brady Games for Blizzard entertainment.  ISBN 0-7440-0405-5
---
I wasn’t paying attention to what I wrote. I meant bop
---
hit definitely isnt a meme. a large portion of a rogues damage comes from white hits, so having a higher hit will greatly increase those auto attacks landing.
---
You don't want the pet to take the hit, you want her to target you so it doesn't do anything, you're not supposed to toggle cheetah when she target you, you're supposed to outrange it.
---
I'm a tank and when I play I'm looking to relax and have fun. I understand the "Go go go" mentality that people have and I have nothing against it but I am firm on a few rules and one of them is that I do the pulling. 
---
This has nothing to do with how good at keeping threat or pulling aggro or anything like this. Honestly, it's largely due to the fact that I have no down time as a tank and I occasionally want to throw a ball for my dog, scratch their ear, or maybe jam a chip into my mouth. You would steal this moment from me and also criticize me and my tanking ability for it.
---
There’s two types of rogues. There’s your Combat Swords Blade Flurry Adrenaline Rush Cheap Shotting on the pull rogue who links damage meters on every single pull.
---
Then there’s every other rogue who never pulls threat because they’re too busy pickpocketing everything first. Because that 90c really adds up.
---
It's not illegal.
---
You can't go from "HURRR DURRR LOLZ TRYHARD FUCKS" to "Indubitably fellow sir, I dissent with your assessment"
---
I already know that you're retarded.
---
There's always grounds. Sometimes that grounds is a false positive or a connection that turned out to not be a connection, but there's always a reason. They're just not going to tell you what it was. That's the whole reason there is an appeal process: for wrongly actioned accounts.
---
Sure, except other professions have more choices and variety of profitable things to make.
---
What difference in time could another melee make in finishing a 5-man dungeon? especially with druid almost pre-bis?
---
Look at the elitist 😂
---
Cons: Loss of profit from selling the herbs.
---
You will eventually need to get to lvl 35 to get alchemy past 225.
---
Correct, only roll for items which suit your role, you may ask to role on other gear or state that you will be rolling on different gear before you start.
---
The lists are often wrong too.
---
Like they assume rogues need 9% hit.
---
It's also situational. If you really want to be truly min-max, just getting the stuff on your BiS list isn't doing it. BiS lists are designed around raid boss(single target) encounters. There are going to be many pieces that are actually better than the stuff on your BiS list, depending on what your doing. 
---
For example, BiS lists will have you getting closer to Raid Boss hit cap %, that's not needed against targets your level (aka dungeons, farming, trash) so swapping out some hit pieces for other pieces would be better there.
---
For mages, you have Frozen Wrath gear as your BiS in a many slots. These pieces have no stats other than frost damage, which is BiS in raid encounters, where you're playing with 39 other people. You're getting healed, other people are also doing damage, and the fights aren't long, so you don't need a lot of HP or Mana or Mana regen. But then take that set out into the world to farm, or on AOE pulls in dungeons and the set is actual trash.
---
BiS lists are often just good starting points for people. You can go way more in depth and a seperate set of gear for almost anything in the game. But it's all player preference, sometimes it's nice to just work for one set, then say fuck it i'm just gonna wear this for everything even when it's not optimal.
---
Show me in the TOS where it's griefing lol. Kiting obnoxious mobs to a city that interfere with its normal functions is griefing. Planking someone in the open world is good old fashioned competition. The only times I would restrain from it is if they had a guild tag I respected, if it's just a random you better believe I would just drive them off and take the spot. I don't care about being nice or making friends with randoms, I have limited time an I'm gonna get my goals
---
I thought shadow priests had some good burst potential with mind blast and flay, shadow word: pain is the highest DoT spell in vanilla right? 
---
Yeah, their mana problems is a big deal.
---
sounds like a scrub server
---
Not sure about BG's (yet) , but I leveled a warrior during Vanilla and I'm at 57 on a Druid in classic and so far it's been a bit easier to tank and level. More complex but less gear dependent with tons of options.  I'm of course not sure how 60 dungeons are going to be but so far so good.
---
Camping is not harrassment.
---
You mean LF1M HEALER BRD SPELLCLEAVE GTG
---
Except torch room rewarding xp for Spirit tap and soul drain, princess + ogre king + diremaul treants running speed, treants Giants aggro and attack range, the standing position and aggro radius of dire maul ogre bosses.
---
Unless you are a mage, then definitely no changes.
---
Thanks for the insight, I'd be more concerned about it while leveling anyways!
---
&gt;Even rogues has the decency not to need on your gear
---
If anything Warriors are rolling on more gear for other classes than Rogues. Which I don't blame them for, its circumstantial based on the shitty itemization in vanilla. Tons of warriors with leather like Eye of Rend and Truestrike Shoulders, or mail like the Glad Chest.
---
It's all good, just let me get my Rend MH and were chill :D
---
Whoa...I got downvoted like a month ago for saying you can use VC for deadmines. 
---
Besides, is there a DM that means dire maul? Don't you have to specify if you mean dire maul east or north or whatever
---
Same, we cleared MC in 2 hrs last night. So much misinformation out there
---
Yes. There are better swords almost always when levelling, and once you get to benefit from windfury totem swords are better.
---
there are even other errors or at least un-used terms in this material, ex: designated looter, as we all call it master looter,
---
So, I still want to know if shadow priests are competitive gear wise during tier 3 phase compared to locks and mages. Is there a big disparity of power or is it simply overblown?
---
The tooltips literally say 20% chance for instant and 30% for deadly.
---
Yes that is the reason. With a weapon skill of 305, your hit cap for yellow hits is 6%, and you get 5% from the combat tree. That being said, white hits take much more hit% while dual-wielding, and sword-spec rogue does a lot of damage with white hits.
---
For a shaman, Spirit is to mp5 what strength is to attack power. 
---
Spirit can scale better with buffs that increase your stats by a %. 
---
Mp5 is what it is at face value, doesn’t increase with stat % buffs. 
---
Shamans mana totem is ticks like mp5, where as priests, for example, have a lot of talents that improve thei spirit and increase spell power healing based off spirit.  Shamans have No talents that change your mana or spell power, so it’s spirit is not as attractive. It still converts to mp5 so it’s not completely useless. 
---
So if it’s on mail, spirit is ok by all means, you don’t need to avoid it. You don’t need to dip into other gear types like leather and cloth just for spirit.
---
Or don't even do anything. Have no idea how people don't have mount gold by 40 unless theyre a spendthrift, hit 40 with 120g, quested a bit and mostly dungeon farmed.
---
(Took me three whole kills.  thought it would never end.)

You can always log out and transfer to a pve server

I'm 27 and I fucking love guild drama
---
I MAAY have spent $600 on an mtg deck I never played, and over $1000 over couple years on Black Desert Online.
---
Then WoW Classic was released and I have not even touched eBay or BDO. I can't believe I'm actually saying this, but thank god for that low $15 monthly subscription. This is quite a cheap hobby to maintain. 
---
PS. FUCK BDO. Worst trash game by the worst trash devs ever. I don't understand how I didn't see this when I started, but the graphics are pretty great and active combat is nice. WoW still blows it out of the water in terms of shear fun to play as well as PvP.

Great, thanks for the input - reassures the choice!

I haven't done sneaky dagger rogue business in a long time.

Been doing 2v2 arenas in retail, AR flail spam only works on dbl. melee groups, and even then not a great success rate, but man it's fun.
---
people on pvp servers go do dungeons in enemy controlled territory all the time. i did WC, RFK, and RFD as alliance. saw a bit of pvp for sure but not exactly hell.
---
I mean it's pretty noticeable. Compare a 9% hit rogue/warrior vs someone who has no hit chance because they are just wearing w/e dropped.
---

You should repost this on r/frugal or r/personalfinance. Great story.

Thanks for sharing this vid. Totally going to try this on my sham.
---
You used a right-wing epithet to discredit a valid argument by saying “you don’t really care about the things you claim to care about.” Not a word you say after that is valid. Your opinion doesn’t matter.

Elected officials do support Hong Kong. China only responds to economic threats, and losing business from video game companies is big business in China.

Enchanted Gold Bloodrobe is nice and will probably last you until mid 40s. And it looks good. And the quest chain is worth a good amount of xp.  So yeah, do it. :)

side question - no right answer.  If you have the mats, it's a gamble, but you might win!  or end up with an 'of the wolf' :(
---
I dont have a dog in the fight, but this photo looks like a badly photoshopped/cut and paste fake note you brought in to get out of school. 0/10 would not accept as evidence.
---
The problem with Boomkins is that even with their party buff you end up doing more overall damage just replacing him with a mage instead.
---
I've tanked in many MMOs including WoW back in the day.
---
I have no issue with a slow pace. None at all. But if you're going to make the dungeon run all about you and your feelings it's not going to go well.
---
I don't have even a single moment for any Diva'ish mentality. When I tanked I never once complained about mobs running around or dpsing taking aggro, because it happens, and that's what tanks do, manage aggro. You taunt, charge, etc and keep it all in order.
---
The moment you start stopping the dungeon run because your feelings are hurt or you think everyone needs to bend to your will that's when the dungeon run is over.
---
I’m not too sure about the stats of your robes but generally you shouldn’t need to buy any gear off the ah for levelling. I’d recommend just buying it off the ah but you should check frequently before choosing a price to buy at as they can range from 3-12g depending on the time and number of undercutters
---
Still though, when I started when the gates off AQ were just starting so not sure what patch that was at.
---
Well I took the staff...guess that was a mistake on my part
---
Go DW tank. Make sure u got mostly plategear. Healer can keep you alive even if he's not specced for healing. And as far as aggro goes, just make sure the healer doesn't have aggro. This mindset has been working without wipes for my last 5 dm runs.
---
Deepfury got below 50g on my server yesterday and I finally scooped them. Yeah there are more economical choices but I felt that was what they were worth.
---
Shout out to dire maul killing the value of these. Yall can have your 6% drop rate bracers that you will replace in raid.
---
What class?
---
Thanks! yeah I think I'm going with tarnished elven ring in my threat set for sure. I'm not sure if I'll swap to devilsaur for threat. I may just get blademasters leggings from the beast and keep slaghides on
---
On Horde its stronger atm
---
Am I not remembering properly, or can you NOT fly from one continent to the other? (As Booty Bay is on the other side of the drink.)
---
If you take tank items while I’m the tank and you’re the DPS, I’m leaving. Lol who would stay for that
---
If you're not looking to join one of the top two guilds in the universe on skeram, benediction is a great place for you. The camaraderie on benediction is like nothing ive ever seen.
---
That’s fucked up and should be extremely frowned upon and pointed out in party chat by fellow group mates. I’m enhance an make absolutely sure no one else needs a piece of spell gear before rolling need. If you’re rolling for OS gear against someone’s MS need roll you need to be informed it’s a dick move.
---
He doesn't even have to convince them. &lt;clc&gt; (horde) and &lt;vampire clan&gt; (alliance) have already teamed up.
---
Vanilla= no cross faction collusion. It was stated policy at the time.
---
I mean their is nothing stopping you from hogging every camp you possibly find, go off king. But just know it'll make everyone else hate you.
---
Which is why spirit is best on priests because they have clear casting talent and can regen mana while casting right? I thought restro druids had a similar talent too.
---
Yea idk what your arguing about, I said it's assumed that loot is MS &gt; OS in end game content unless stated otherwise. You will get called a ninja and black listed for rolling on off spec shit when it's on roll. If it's on master loot people will tell you to piss off and loot the item to the MS who rolled on it.
---
 Whether or not being 'black listed' has an actual affect is another subject entirely. Do it once or twice and yea nobody will probably care and forget about it other than those who witnessed it. Consistently act like a fuck boi and people will start to remember.
---
You need to be at least friendly with the faction, it's by design
---
Good GM
---
Please explain to me how fury takes less skill than any other spec to play properly, ESPECIALLY with your implication that lots of people are abusing the HS queueing and cancelling mechanic. Is clicking frostbolt harder than that? Pressing sinister strike and every 20 seconds eviscerate or slice and dice? And fury prot is definitely better- you could not be more wrong on all counts
---
Exactly, and a Meter is a great way to tell you if you are playing correctly. It's also has multiple uses, like telling you why your group wiped, and showing you how much better an upgrade made you. It also inspires friendly/or not competition among the DPS of a group.
---
I smoke much less too, and I even tend to smoke while I am playing
---
What server
---
What if I told you that tanking allows you to get many more dungeon runs than a dps
---
Thought he was calling OP 13. I was bamboozled
---
There used to be, back in the day before the first WoW forum purge.
---
I tried looking for them once before, but couldn't find them :(
---
There were many drama posts about cross-faction collusion.
---
This is the most rational explanation.
---
DW doesn't give you higher flurry uptime. You get more crits, but you get proportionally more attacks eating up the charges. When you factor in instant attacks, slow 2H weapons benefit more from flurry. DW is still better damage but it's not because of flurry uptime.
---
A big warm cave that's hard to get into, and once you do you perform disappointingly and walk away empty-handed?

Does the Twitch app not work on Mac? I started downloading each individually then quickly realized it’s just so much easier to use the app. Especially for the updates.

Didn’t a Chinese guild beat C’Thun before it was nerfed. I remember watching a YouTube video on WoWs hardest bosses that mentioned that.
---
Quest NPC is at the Library in Dire Maul North
---
No, bad advice.
---
Those streamers are using a general pet control macro with attack/follow usually bound to mouse wheel up/down respectively and a bind for stay. 
---
Just search this sub for Hunter macros OP.
---
Read your own evidence... it says VC was used "interchangeably" in other words VC was used an EQUAL amount as DM.
---
Using it as evidence that Deadmines has to be VC is stupid as it debunks your own argument.
---
The priest will already know the DPS shammie will respect at 60 for healing.
---
james fuckin neal baby
---
yea the DM ones are nice, so are the ones from the beast in UBRS if you need an extra +hit
---
the cost of deep fury has never made any sense
---
My decurse is alt 1, same bind as in 2005. I could see that being annoying now. Maybe I'll download clique or whatever.
---
As a matter of fact it also doesn't have the letters DM standing for anything. So as with all things gaming do whatever people understand on your server.
---
I personally think you can find many benefits for having an alt to grind stuff even if it isn’t DM.  You’ll be able to kill and gather more efficiently and having a pet makes you much more versatile if you have a gathering prof.  (Pet tanks, you gather).
---
True, while leveling I've rarely encountered locks that have that enchant tho!
---
At lvl 35 I did cooking and fishing from 0-300 in one day. Took about 13 hours.
---
I heard people say it was to add the lvl 55 water into the game too.  People struggle to get the lvl 40 mount. People who actually have some disposable cash unlike when they were teenagers are going to buy gold.  Blizzard should add tokens in just like retail.
---
They knew that certain items were best in their respective slots, it wasnt a meme like it is now
---
It was gone on Incendius yesterday and if the realm list was any indication(not showing layering) gone for most others as well. I did not see any layering.
---
Just got my Norrath Faced Jerkin last night!
---
Hell, if you wanna go that route.  Never use WW for AoE threat.  Use Battle Shout in Defensive Stance.  Battle Shout produces 55 threat per target buffed, modified by 1.3 (assuming no Defiance) will net you 71 threat (79 with Defiance) per party member buffed to all mobs who are aggro'ed.  You can use it 2.5 times for the same Rage cost as WW so that means for the same Rage you get 177 (197 w/Defiance) threat per party member buffed.  So long as you have 1 more party member in range you will generate 142 threat per mob per cast.  With WW, you are generating 120-360 threat given the numbers you provided, numbers that are highly contingent on the weapon being used and that all targets get hit by WW every time because Dodges/Parries/Misses obviously never happen.  Meanwhile, party members cannot resist a buff so Battle Shout is far more reliable and predictable.  If all party members are in range, Battle Shout trumps all for AoE threat, excluding Challenging Shout.
---
So again I say, Neither TC or WW is great AoE threat.  WW should only be used to generate snap aggro at the very beginning of a fight assuming you Charge into the pack and no other party members are around and you have 4 or less targets.  Any other time, you're better off casting Battle Shout repeatedly.
---
Also, leveling as Arms is old, you need to get with DW Fury using Heroic Strike cancelling to see what leveling fast with plenty of Rage looks like.
---
Okay cool thanks
---
So spirit does or does not add mp5 while casting?
---
Im reading conflicting responses here
---
It's not a joke. OP wants to reroll for cosmetic reasons. He's asking if nogenfogger is worth the cost.
---
Its requiring absolutely everyone to conform to that list that takes the joy out of the game for people.
---
Thank you so much!
---
For real. Not sure why people would be looking for group for dire maul in West fall.
---
The faster I kill them, the faster I can get out. Leaving all the mobs for you.
---
Herod is a toxic server. The people who spend all day whining about streamers are no better than streamer fanboys.
---
Discuss beforehand, or ask at the first sign you see your Priest healer lets out a purple death ray.
---
Let's make dead threads great again! Like for real!
---
This is great while leveling but around BRD level is where it stops being acceptable imo. That’s where end game items start dropping. Rolling on healing gear as a dps is a dick move when that healer won’t replace that piece until a raid. Same for rolling on tank gear as a dps or vice versa.
---
When you close in on end game that is where you should roll as the spec you are in the group unless you clear it before hand.
---
I get that this is really complicated, so I'll make it simple for you.
---
For every person who reads or posts on boards like this, there are ten that don't. Probably more. They don't know shit about streamers or devilsaur mafias or whatever. They got the game, saw the server list, and picked the name they liked best.
---
Please follow your own advice and think before posting. &lt;3
---
Your mp5 does not increase with spirit is what i’m saying, there is 0 correlation between the 2 stats. What you see increasing is your OUT OF COMBAT regen. Mp5 continues during combat, same resource being replenished, but 2 very different ways they get restored by 2 different stats. Mp5&gt; Spirit
---
I was talking about edit 2, welcome to reddit. You got your questions answered but got downvotes. Sucks, but move on.

There isnt really a great route to do those 4 bosses, but typically people run Arena/Anger runs aswell as emperor lava runs, which would include Incendius.

Huh? Faerlina has more Alliance than Horde. Did you make it out of the Barrens?

Patch 3.1.0
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_3.1.0
---
Think of it this way. Raids in phase 1 are completely outclassed by phase 2 raids. 
---
Its why I'm not rushing to 60. I'd rather have 2 or 3 classes to 60 by phase 2 then rush 60 on one and start raiding. I not too worried about it. There will be more raids later. Plus more pvp.
---
Right now I'm levelling 3 characters and have 2 Twitter is being made for BGs.
---
If you need a break for school. This is probably the BEST time for it.
---
This, people in my raid literally won't bid any DKP on anything that's not BiS according to wowhead, meaning I get every PvP pieces for minimum bid. I'm very close to being full (pvp) MC geared right now (warlock T1). So I don't mind it too much.
---
HS is a garbage ability and should not be used much anyway, and the crit damage is not affected by this so it's completely irrelevant to bring up. In fact, if you are using HS significantly, then a faster AS weapons is better because it means you're getting fewer no-rage swings... But again you shouldn't be doing that.
---
Mortal strike is instant, and what the entire conversation is revolving around really.
---
Yeah, that’s what I did.  Skinning and herbalism.  Vendor the skins and AH the herbs.  I had 130 gold by the time I hit 40.  I’m 45 and have 119 again.
---
As a noob leveling druid, when I ran my first dungeon as a tank I wondered if I was really that bad at using the like 6 abilities I had or what
---
Now I realize what I'm really in for
---
There was layering on gehennas EU as of 1 hour ago. So yeah bullshit.
---
ez answer is to tank for only Warlock DPS. They'll start with their DOT rotation which gives you enough GCD's to hold threat
---
🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Yea, I feel like I'm a good tank but always have to use Taunt in every fight with more than 2 mobs. It's never off cooldown basically. I'm worried for the raid scene once I get higher (45 right now) and I appreciate any runs where I get to dps ha.
---
Sorry for you but hey most mage did the same x) and almost did it had i not looked at zf loots :p.
---
This guide is really good for answering all your questions.

I kinda wish we went there instead of heartseeker.
---
Well I know they’re amazing in like one on one PvP.  Are there certain classes that are best for battlegrounds?  Are hunters a lot better then rogues in that aspect?
---
I’m not gonna bother reading this but I’ll refer you to my previous comment. Please shut up.
---
Tip. 
---
Don't loop shity music throughout the guide.
---
Where to get gear good enough for raiding for a Shaman?
---
Is there a guide for what gear I should strive to get at level 60 and where to get it? I have no idea how to go about this...
---
Yellow hits are attacks from abilities If you are  using default scrolling combat text any ability will show yellow for the damage it deals. White hits are standard auto attacks. 
---
Yellow hits do not generate rage and have a different hit cap 9% (6% for human or orc using the correct weapon) and I believe suffer less from glancing blows. 
---
White hits generate rage and have a different hit cap, I don’t know the exact values but as someone said 27% for offhand weapons.
---
I mean those people are a tiny minority. Most people you probably think youre referring to take issue with min-maxers shittalking people who dont min-max or trying to force them to min-max too. Noone cares if you min-max your own character.
---
Yellow = yellow damage. So special attacks like whirlwind cleave etc.
---
White = white damage. Aka auto attacks
---
Special attacks require a lower hit cap on than auto attacks
---
i feel bad for that 60
---
If you don’t mind track toggling all the time I’d do mining. If you do mind, alchemy is usually a good call.
---
Yeah this is as bad as the person who designed the graveyard positions,  id like to know who did it , so i can shit on their chest x.x
---
Noooo
---
You get your mount for free, so you can spend your gold more liberally than other classes. I suggest getting the dreamweave set at 40, it‘s extremely cheap for how strong it is and will likely stay with you all the way to the high 50s or even 60.
---
Is it even worth leveling? Or would it be more beneficial to just sell the herbs?
---
Doesn't make a difference in the long run too it's just an extra ^^.
---
I don't even smoke.
---
No chance you write upper BlackRock spire
---
&gt; Druids much higher Effective health mitigates the crushes and crits
---
I think you need to look up the meaning of the word mitigates.  
---
Their health makes it so they don't just flat out die by getting hit for double damage repeatedly, that's more of a "soak" druids would be fantastic in some situations outside of the fact that healers don't have infinite mana and healing a druid requires a considerable greater amount of attention vs a warrior (smoother damage is better).  
---
Your "time to time" is about 1/100th the amount of times a druid is crit/crushed and ONLY if the warrior is bad, REALLY bad, like, bad enough that remembering to hit 1 button every ~6 seconds bad.
---
Yeah for real didn’t they clear naxx just this past summer? Saw them advertising progression naxx a few months ago
---
You haven't seen 1 drakestone in 90 kills... never mind of shadow wrath, of any type.
---
TBF that is a nice piece for healing offspec at that point. Still something that should be discussed in advance before blind NEED rolling though...
---
Its the same. A bunch of people with little else going on in their life gatekept and glorified it to everyone else so theyd feel superior.
---
When people get in they realize its just MC.
---
/r/ihavesex
---
How many runs did it take you to get HoJ?
---
Same as deadmines:D
---
I think it's more of an oversight they had to correct. Warlocks and Paladins couldnt get their epic mounts unless they bought it like everyone else.
---
Also, DM was released in Vanilla before anyone cleared MC. With Ragnaros being cleared before DM being open, it's not a true classic feel
---
Morbent Fel was kited through Elywnn Forest last night.
---
No. If you ever run dungeons shatter is MASSiVE increase to your aoe dps.
---
Yeah I mean, people here telling you to choose school over WoW aren’t wrong. But the real answer is self control. You’re not gonna be studying 15 hours a day. You can WoW and go to school. Just don’t play WoW and not do your school work. It’s that easy.
---
Do your HW, study, and blow off some steam with WoW. That’s what I do.

It's too hard to find a gnome group and it's such a large dungeon. Low min level high max level.
---
I'm 46 and always wanted those legs. Never found a group before I outlevelled it.
---
Thanks for the heads up! I'll skip searing gorge lol
---
10 minutes to mark mobs?
---
The game client allows you to bind target markers to the keyboard. I have them all bound to my numpad. You can press the keybind as you're pressing whatever your pull spell is at the same time, making it instantaneous. And as your focus moves around, you can also move the marker around instantly. There shouldn't be any downtime at all to mark anything.
---
Yes your time is so much more valuable than the DPS’s, who are needed as much as a tank to complete the dungeon, you should totally get tank gear AND their dps gear. Oh wait that makes no sense... And remember, with no cross realm you will be seeing the same people a lot more often than you think. Last thing you want to do is build that kind of rep, be blacklisted, and be stuck in those blues forever. Sounds like a worse option than running the dungeon until you can win the roll fairly.
---
Fuck the chinese government

Yep

If you don't have a talent for it, it doesn't.

Nobody is saying that creating your character backstory is the end result. Everybody is saying that that's step 1 to joining a RP guild which hosts those events you're seeking. If you want to participate in the events then take our advice so that you can join a guild that provides said events. If you want it spelled out and I mean this is seriously step by step what you need to do. If you follow this you will end up in a rp guild which hosts large scale events unless they don't accept you because your personality is so terrible:
---
1. Find an RP server in your region that meets your specs - pvp, pve, balance. Nobody can recommend one because you didn't specify what you're looking for or even what region you're in until your last comment.
---
2. Go to their discord or subreddit and find their guild advertisement thread.
---
3. Find an RP guild which hosts the type of events you're looking for. They'll advertise what they host. Different guilds do different things and have different requirements for their players so nobody can recommend one based on the tiny bit of info you provided.
---
4. Join the server and create a character backstory. Use an addon to show your backstory. Ask the guild you join what addon they use.
---
5. That's it. That's literally every step. You just join a guild that hosts those events. Nobody can assume what you're looking for so put in a tiny bit of effort, follow our advice to meet the minimum requirements to join a rp guild, and find one.
---
Yeah they'll be valuable but not like 100s of gold, 25g is probably a pretty fair price though.
---
Nature resist will be HUGE in AQ. That's around 9 months away though lmao
---
4% miss on equal level, 5, 6, 17 on +1, 2, and 3 respectively. Total hit is capped at 99%, so you need +16% hit to cap against +3/boss.
---
I feel like I saw something maybe 1-2 weeks ago that there is some seasonal things confirmed, though I don't have a link or perfect memory.
---
&gt;  elite basilisk in Uldaman as it does a lvl 58 banshee in EPL
---
as a warrior trying to solo elites, i was always left with the impression that they had around 4x the hp as a non-elite of the same level, and that banshee probably had some sort of shadow resist.
---
I mean, I might go like 20 mins and if I only had one I'd find something better to do. You literally claim to have received one dust every two hours and fourty minutes. 
---
Damn son.
---
This, exactly. If you are ONLY seeking a single specific set of items and manipulate dungeons and mechanics, (skipping bosses, etc) to obtain those items, it takes away from the "this is a game that I play for fun" element for a LOT of people. Some of us aren't interested in being slaves to the meta or only doing everything exactly perfectly AND THAT IS OK TOO.
---
In Eve, you can just shoot spies though.
---
Difference here is that there isnt a good way to deal with spies.
---
"Nothing tangible"

You're playing a fuckin video game.
---
The blue quote was "first patch" which is pretty ambiguous.
---
Ravager procs will do substantially more dmg that your pally dps, especially against multiple mobs
---
You'd be surprised - on low pop servers, sometimes you take whatever you can get. Did an Ulda run with 3 warriors and while I didn't win any loot, we wrecked shop ha, it was fun.
---
you roll on whatever gear you will use in raid spec. for ex. it's completely acceptable for a druid tank to roll need on healer gear
---
Not really. If anything there's more competition because it's a higher population. There are numerous bigger guilds than the ones in the devilsaur mafia
---
wowclassicbis.com  -- This is a great source to find your BiS gear and where it's from.  Also gives you an idea of how good the pieces you have and what you should prioritize for next.
---
As the poster above posted, you really want to make sure you understand your class and role in a raid.  I'd reccomend this channels videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szkScab2iOQ 
---
There are two videos on "Advanced Shaman Mechanics" as well as specific videos for whatever build you want to play.
---
Hope this helps.
---
just switched from the crescent staff to the staff of shade at lvl31, was it a good move in your opinion?
---
If you are going to roll on gear for a role different from the role you are playing in the group, let us know. 
---
I would have no issue with a tank rolling on DPS gear if the tank let’s us know at the start. I have a 49 shaman  alt (enhancement). I do not have an issue with the extra competition if you let me know in advance. 
---
The same applies with healing and damage gear. You as a healer plan to roll on DPS gear? Let the party know. Maybe the elemental shaman in the group and you can then agree to both need DPS and healing gear. 
---
But if you don’t tell people and just roll need once loot starts dropping, that is problematic. If you let the group know in advance, people can either agree to it, not group with you, or find another group themselves. And if you are a tank, most will agree to work with you anyway. 
---
The bottom line is if a tank rolls on DPS gear without letting the party know at party formation (not once everyone is in the dungeon), then the tank is basically ninja looting. If the tank let’s people know in advance, that is perfectly fine. And this same principle applies to DPS and healers. Communicate in advance if you plant to roll on gear that is different from your party role.
---
either your leadership is shit at WoW or you are, otherwise theyd let you play what you want as long as you deliver
---
Maybe I'm privileged to be in a large guild with a good community, but I experience no toxicity on Herod
---
Ive done MC a few times. (couple bosses one week, 8 the other two i think)  I think the most fun i had was joking like a bunch of 13 year olds when the Crimson Shocker dropped.
---
Overall im still having a fair amount of fun, but im in a fairly loose guild.  Last week kinda sucked because we were doing a joint run with another guild and their leadership had some....questionable....things going on that we hadnt done the previous week when we hosted, but meh.  Looking forward to getting in there tonight and just having fun with my guild.
---
I get what you're saying. I'm not trying to say "we're just a pvp guild." I'm trying to explain that mafia appeals to competitive pvpers and the motivation for mafia is that it's a way to make gold based on your ability to pvp.
---
Got plenty of people in crater that are stupid rich from playing AH etc. They're still in crater not even taking skins.
---
So you're right that it'd be unfair to frame as just normal pvp guild stuff, but if we weren't focused on pvp and competition we wouldn't be in crater.
---
As far as all the people saying "a pvp guild would kill all alliance" goes, that's just RP. At least personally I enjoy pvp from a skill vs skill player vs player perspective. Horde vs Alliance is just RP. I don't kill every alliance I see just cause I'm horde and I don't think anyone else does either.
---
Crater competition creates a ton of fun gameplay when you get two opposing mafias fighting for control. Raid vs raid both with cross faction comms duking it out. Calling for MCs from opposing faction allies to prevent a death or sheep breaks and the like. It's legit just fun gameplay and super challenging.
---
So to repeat what I said initially, the solution to mafia is to organize and beat em. I'd certainly enjoy it personally.
---
No they don't. It's usually just a handful at a time.
---
Download the atlas loot mod. It will tell you if you need to bother with tribute or not
---
It could be worse, it could be blizzard or flamestrike. Just Be happy the bad firemages only pull one add, the bad AOE mages pull all of them.
---
Are you trying to dps or heal? Because if you're healing it's real easy, just take non-mail items that are well suited for it (int/spirit/+healing). Since there's only one healer per group, no one will object when you roll on those despite the armor type.
---
If you're trying to dps, you can do basically the same thing just with the melee or caster gear (definitely recommend elemental over enhancement though). The problem is, you're going to butt heads with other people over it much more frequently. Also, it's not as well suited for PvP since such items are less frequently mail and you don't want to be running cloth/leather as a superior armor class if you don't have to. But again, that's only a concern for PvP.
---
Lol I just made this flight and was shaking my head as I was flying back past the place I had just flown not a minute earlier.
---
Try skinning,  i make about 20 to 40 gold a day just from skins alone not including the cloth i farm and sell , dungeons are great for gold ZF for mageweave sm for silk , ST for skins ... if i put about 7 or 8 hours in dungeon farming i eadily make 100 gold a day i had 200 gold almost my level 40 , just sell eveything x) undercut the AH on greens i see ppl selling blues 10g i put it 4g ,, u sell faster x) gl
---
Shadowpanther.net used to have a good guide, at 29 youll be in half boes and half quest rewards from the nesingwary questline
---
Yeah. WeakAuras is just a tool for doing things in the UI. You can basically do anything an add-on can do, but you have to tell it to do that. You can import and export WeakAuras or build your own. If you google it, there's a site that catalogues a bunch of them.
---
More normal use cases involve showing a frame on your screen or similar when something happens, but writing to a chat channel is another thing you can do.
---
Ok we got baited
---
LOL shall I explain once more than I am looking for something that is a bit deeper than sharing backstories???? Fkin idiots need me to explain AGAIN? Ok here we go.....just kidding. Jk jk. I think we are done here, obviously none of you were able to help me discover something deeper than character backstories. WAAAAIT, you did recommend I make a post else where LOL, and waaait, you did also recommended I find a group on my own....LOL.....and what else useless shit??? Y'all wouldnt even know would you cause you people literally think ur responses helped. I could be trashing on this so much right now. Y'all probably already forgot that what I have been saying is actually coming from a very advanced mind.....lol so shove ur fkin wise ass comments back inside.
---
Oh he's proud of it.
---
Nice, at least there is hope soon haha
---
Bad players will be bad players, addon or not. Wiping will teach them to utilize teamwork, the group leader can use the DPS meter to see who they attacked the most and kick as needed.
---
good song

[H'amb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6htQAxTNF0g)
---
I disagree but to each their own.
---
[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntertaininglyWrong](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntertaininglyWrong)I come to the conclusion that this is a Text Based RPG because we go by handles instead of our actual names, making a reddit account a character that I function as on the internet and we measure our character progression in Karma.
---
Since we know the statement is already wrong, the humor comes from me coming to that conclusion based on false equivalences between the two.
---
Yeah, like its getting dubious looking at the number of "arena run/strath UD only/etc" that im seeing.
---
I hope people actually want to clear content when more 60s make it. Im not interested in doing dungeons 2 bosses at a time skipping most of everything.
---
Dragon Finger of Frozen Wrath? Sure, Random Ring of the Eagle, req level 42? No ;p
---
Spirit does not affect any mana regen in combo unless you come across some set bonus that allows mana regen while casting.
---
Mp5 is king in raids but while leveling spirit is honestly decent. Auto attacking will keep you outside the 5 second rule so you will get full affects of your spirit but in a raid or dungeon setting you really dont stop casting.
---
Hey man, we have the Firewater from Winterspring...why cant they? :P
---
6 raids, no loot. yay, raiding is great -.-
---
First, good on you for being a tank! 
---
Second, I chose to go fury because I'm new to WoW in general, and I could tanking would be a highly stressful role and I didn't want to burn myself out of the game because of it. 
---
That being said, I do my absolute damnest to help the tank out in every single way I can.
---
Great stuff, thanks a lot man!
---
Honestly, I don't remember either and I don't know because I haven't even thought about trying due to utilizing boats as much as possible to save that mount money.
---
Most competitive, tons of competent guilds, biggest population and economy, tons of PvP events, best faction balance, endless world PvP.
---
Both do
---
You have an inherent chance to miss. You can get enough hit that you don't miss.
---
Yellow attack: Refers to special or modified attack. Example: Mortal strike, heroic strike, cleave.
---
White attack: Refers to an auto attack, in this case 27% is the hit cap for auto attacks while dual wielding. Meaning if you just stood an auto attacked while dual wielding you would miss 27% of you hits. 
---
When heroic strike is queued up the game says "These off hand attacks are yellow attacks" meaning they have a 9% chance to miss rather than 27%.
---
This is MASSIVE, because 1) Attacks that hit do damage, attacks that miss do not. 2) it is approximately infinitely easier to obtain 9% hit vs 27% hit, which means more attacks hit than miss, 3) your off hand attacks generate rage even while heroic strike is queued. The more they hit the more rage you have. Which means more special attacks and thus more damage.
---
The Horde: What is happening at Windshear Crag is intolerable!
---
Me: But what about our clear-cutting in Ashenvale?
---
The Horde: bUt WhAT aBoUT aShEnVaLe?
---
&gt; Your average player is mechanically less competent these days
---
Thats straight up a lie.
---
thanks for explaining my point, real casual players are between lvl 30-50 right now.
---
If u need then need if they rage and kick you who cares , find another group dont let ppl do that to u
---
What do the rules have to do with anything? You are griefing, pure and simple. Look up the definition of the word if you don't agree.
---
Rogues are hot garbage in battlegrounds. Insane solo, but in groups they suffer. They also level pretty slowly compared to hunters so I'm not sure how much you'll be able to get done in 2-3 weeks. 
---
Hunters are effective in battlegrounds if you're good but they fall off relative to other DPS classes in later stages because they don't scale as well with gear. 
---
Honestly mages are one of the best classes in the game for battlegrounds so I don't see why you would only use them to raid. I'd take one over a hunter or rogue any day. 
---
&gt; Which one would y’all suggest, and are there certain professions you’d recommend for either or? 
---
Engineering is an absolute must for anyone interested in PvP regardless of class or race. Mining is what people usually pair with it because engineering uses so many of it's mats. Can't really go wrong with that combo
---
I’m a rogue too and farmed fel cloth and rune cloth in felwood and azshara.
---
I prefer to farm in azshara because there’s lot of herbs and random treasure chests that increase your gold per hour.
---
Sell your herbs and health/mana potions (You get those from the chests) on raid nights and you’ll make a ton of money just from a couple of hours farming.
---
Check out Frostadamus' [video](https://youtu.be/qoDq2FcYXmE)
---
Fight them?
---
Blizzard doesn’t ban addon. What does that even mean...
---
You sound like a generic, salty rogue that thinks he's good or something lol
---
I guess I’m not sure. Do you use a Mac? I should find this out.
---
That’s rather impressive, but why not kill it in the middle of town where everyone can see it?
---
Okay.  So basically you have + hit chance on gear.  Melee classes want to have gear that provides + 9% in total.  This affects your characters chance to hit the boss, I.e. fewer misses, which is a damage per second increase.
---
Your off hand weapon has a 27% hit cap, which would require you to have your gear have an aggregate number of 27% chance to hit if you wanted your offhand to have he same effective hit chance as a special ability. 
---
The way it works, you press heroic strike, it queue s it up for your attack, provides your offhand with the special attack bonus, which means that your off hand hits more often.  This is a damage per second increase. Even if you’re pressing the button and canceling the heroic strike after the offhand hits, you’d be getting the bonus.  
---
Hit cap, is the amount of plus hit your character can have before getting MORE plus hit gear isn’t worth it.  
---
So I’m the examples above, if I have plus 9% hit for a yellow attack, special ability, such as heroic strike, it can only benefit from 9% hit.  If I have 12% hit on my gear and I do the same thing, I’m wasting the hit and would be better used for other gear, such as plus crit gear. 
---
So optimally you go for 9% hit, queue for heroic strike, the offhand attacks as though 9% is enough and boom, you hit more.  You can be more fancy with it like someone else mentioned where you queue it up, wait for the offhand to hit, cancel the cast. You’d do this when building rage.
---
If this is all too much, just play and have fun lol.  It’s just optimizing damage basically.
---
They won’t release the world bosses and honor system until every server is down to one layer so this has to happen.
---
Players that put more effort in game get more resources. It’s fair. If you don’t want to cooperat with other guilds it’s your problem. You are playing MMO, not bfa
---
Only way to combat this is to either promote a massive PVP world event in the area or stop buying the leathers on the AH choking off the supply.
---
You’re so edgy
---
If you're serious about tanking on ally side you mine as well just see human tbh. In classic it's kind of a game changer how much weapon skill affects your end game stats compared to private servers.
---
That is super shitty :(
---
You and everyone else on this sub, nobody catrs
---
Hmm, maybe I’ll use the mage for raids and battlegrounds and just roll a rogue for open world PvP.  Rogue just seems really fun to me.
---
Obviously not everyone there is toxic. You can find good communities on any server. The larger the server, the more likely you are to find players who are similar to you.
---
Do you play with a Mac? Perhaps Twitch is the way for me to go.
---
I’m sorry what?? Crown goes with any xmog
---
Why? Why wouldn't I call out some random internet dbag that spouts uninformed bullcrap? I have just as much as right to tell you why you're wrong as you do to say shit like "lol they should have known better lololol".
---
why would you post that
---
I’m 50/50 between a decent troll and legit mental illness. Look at his comment on the bottom of the thread.
---
Any server recommendations for someone wanting to jump into Classic after mostly avoiding the opening chaos? East Coast Alliance player mostly wanting to focus on PvP (WPvP and BGs eventually)
---
Exactly. It's simple as DM for Deadmines or DME etc for Diremaul.
---
Sheep hunter kill pet hunters panic without pets , its funny x)
---
Layering has absolutely nothing to do with server caps. Two totally different things.
---
Wow so ur in a heavy rp guild BUT YOU CANNOT RECRUIT ME!!
---
What’s sexual about the name?  Is virginity now considered vulgar?
---
So I feel like the word toxic is overused.
---
Like someone from a rural part of the country moves to New York City and calls it toxic.
---
No, it's just bigger, fast-paced and impatient about bullshit.
---
We do not know. Blizzard has commented on what the current server caps are or will be.
---
Cause people are followers. same reason people do bad things simply cause others are doing it also.
---
As a healing priest, how to I decide between a piece of gear that has +n to healing spells and something with stats like int or spirit? In what situations is one better than the other?
---
It's already included in the screenshot
---
Your call has been heard. May thee gods answer in your favor, or something. I'm not native English so idk
---
Cool story. Nobody “needs” anything but greens to clear current content. What’s your point? It’s cool looking and I want it that’s enough.
---
My logic is that the company literally said they will not release phase 2 until each server is on a single layer.
---
you are a clown.
---
Can we ban the—you know what, forget it. Let’s just shut the whole thing down.
---
i don't know how the other classes go, but the warrior mechanics threads here on reddit are insanely misinformed.
---
&gt; it's literally top 3 most important items pre 30 
---
You says this as if it actually matters.
---
I want gold.
---
Are they sewed ass to mouth or mouth to ass? 🤨
---
Well from the start I was only advocating using WW at the outset of a pull. 
---
Leveling DW fury is ridiculous. Arms is better for many reasons but im not gonna waste the time laying them out for you
---
I think it might be the people you are surrounded by. I am having just as much fun raiding today as I did in vanilla. It is so much easier this time around, but the fun is still there. There is no loot drama because all of us just want to smash the content and know loot will come. You might consider trying to find another group to roll with.
---
Yeah they will because this is the popular opinion.   Tbc was more popular than vanilla and I know a lot of my friends from tbc that haven't touched classic because they only care about arenas.
---
Following that logic everyone can roll need on every single item that drops, because everyone needs gold after all.
---
As a warlock I agree so much... I can't get soul shards from them, and either I use all my dots and overkill by a bunch (still takes ages), and waste a ton of mana, or I use little dots and lifedrain, which takes even longer and often doesn't even recuperate what I spend in mana as hp equivalence... if i had some spell dmg i could maybe shadowbolt
---
Yeah this was the rough breakdown of the census data I remember:
---
Warriors: ~15%
---
Mages: ~15%
---
everything else sans druid: ~9-12%
---
Druids: ~7%
---
Warriors kind of 1/1a with mages, everybody else kind of clumped around 9-12%, and then Druids down around 7%. So there are twice as many warriors as Druids, and like you said, no idea what the level range was of any of these.
---
I just feel like tanking is a responsibility that many people don't want to burden themselves with. Takes a certain kind of person to enjoy that role.
---
It really depends on what you enjoy doing. I would rather spam dungeons than run all over the world chasing quest objectives.
---
You wont have two layers to put people in,  so your going to have more people trying to get into one layer meaning larger queue.
---
Thanks for sharing.
---
Yeah i get that.  But surely they cant do that with 2k+ qeues still there.
---
Because each layer has basically a "server" on it.... If u make them all combine, that's more people to just get onto the one server. Layers aren't smaller.
---
1k needles harpy cave made me a solid 20g between lvls 29-32 I was just grinding xp, not even trying to farm gold. They drop a ton of Vibrant Plumes which vendor for over 6s each.
---
That would be creepy, right?
---
BTW you're out of pizza rolls.
---
What are they doing more than the dps?
---
Sorry man this was back in Vanilla. I'm not in a guild at all at this point.
---
Gravestone is particularly hard to replace for shadow priest, as the fact it does shadow type damage means it benefits from SForm and weaving.
---
For me it's less about the coins and more about finding junkboxes to level lockpicking.
---
I bring DPS warriors in my runs and I'm not worried about them rolling on my loot.  I do want them equal or lower level than me to make threat easier.  
---
I ran ZF 14 times in a row.  I have the loot I wanted from there, even seeing the plate shoulders drop and going to the dps.
---
If the dps war pulls aggro he's not dying on the first hit.
---
If the dps war pulls aggro, he's standing right next to me and I don't have to go chasing the mob.
---
The dps war can use his higher rage bar for shouts allowing me to use mine on Sunders and revenge.
---
I'm a warrior tank and I generally like having a dps warrior along for the ride.
---
Yeah I messaged some mage I saw with an epic mount. Asking him what the strategy was and he goes "stack int and Stam and solo zf gy"
---
If this is your way of agreeing dps are easily replaced, and tanks are more important. then sounds good. I’m also not saying Tanks deserve all loot, but you can’t limit them to just tank gear for rolling
---
Can druids also do coffer runs? I noticed the coffer run guide says only rogues can do it.
---
If you think "There are bis guides. These are pre bis for warriors as well." comes across as Elitist, I can only imagine how much fluffy fun you're having on your fully Int Cloth geared Warrior :D I think every player must decide what he wears =)
---
I think the guy above would honestly have an aneurysm if he saw my three characters and their professions lol. 
---
The thing is? I'm having a freaking blast, the game is rewarding, frustrating, well paced and full of content. I have more than +12 days played already on 3 characters and no level 60s. 
---
This game has always been about playing how you want to play!
---
Ill look for one hard at lvl 60 for sure
---
Does hunters mark have different ranks?
---
Totally agree but I've tanked all of our successful ony kills as a druid phase 3. However I've been trying to teach the other tanks how to pick up threat p3 because your rolling dice hard on that if you don't have fear wards/tremor up.
---
I feel your pain. Spent most of 58-60 farming Angerforge/Arena/Golem as a rogue. After going 40+ runs without seeing Hand of Justice drop, I decided to form my own groups with people who either had it or didn’t need it. On run #56 it finally dropped (yes I should have master looted, but no one needed it or I thought). Everyone says grats, until the holy pally decided to roll need. When everyone said why tf would you need on that? His reply, “It’s for off spec in case I want to play Ret”. Brings me to my next gear nightmare. 40+ runs into farming UBRS for truestrike shoulders, the prot warrior rolls an even 100 need to best my 62 roll. This time once again, “In case I want to use for off spec in the future”. Hope you guys can enjoy and learn from my pain.
---
We get redemption! Never thought I’d get the chance again
---
Agreed, that is why while I hope all illegal gold sellers go bust, wow tokens continue to be bought and sold
---
Druids can't tank nefarian or chromaggus.
---
I think they do the christmas one.
---
Why do people actually willingly roll on Faerlina? There’s so many other PvP servers where a majority of the alliance population isn’t just an Olympus circle jerk....
---
(Come to Sulfuras :))
---
&gt;~~Found~~ Caused 5 bugs while patching current bug.
---
FTFY
---
Bits of what you are saying make sense but it falls apart every time you try to normalize the collusion. I don't think convoluted cross faction communication is 'fun' or even 'gameplay'. When you are telling people to organize that is kind of ridiculous. So if someone wants to take part in Ungoro farming they need to go out of their way to befriend a random guild from the other faction? That has nothing to do with the video game itself.
---
Managing people is the worst part of it imo. If you're pulling threat constantly and trying to blame me, I'll just kick you. But managing the rest of the group sucks. 
---
No, this is an anger/arena run, we can't just swing by the grim guzzler.
---
Hunter, please turn off growl/make pet passive/ dismiss pet before jump.
---
Healer, you're 3 lvls below everyone else. Please be cautious of aggroing.
---
Mage, please don't freeze the entire pack in place while I'm trying to drag them back from inc. pat.
---
And the fucking marks. I swear if I don't mark every single pack to a T, every single dps will pick a different target. It's like they can't fathom pulling their head out of their ass long enough to look up and notice that every single one of them is beating on a different mob. 
---
Essentially, you have three people that want to follow you around and play their keyboard like a piano, while hardly ever taking into account anything that's happening on screen. But at the same time want you and the healer to be hyper cognizant of everything going on around them. 
---
Now obviously, every dps isn't like this, but these types of players are pretty common. I imagine this is why so many people refuse to tank. Lots of people just don't want to have to micromanage others.
---
I could definitely believe that
---
No dots or debuffs?  Really.....
---
Really....
---
Some warlocks know you're an idiot if they ever read this.
---
Thanks for proving me right, good luck in life dipshit.
---
LFM Detroit raid... need tanks.... a lot of tanks.
---
Just make a guild or organize a group to fuck them? This is how the game should work.
---
Yup. Cat and bear gear are entirely separate for most pieces. If you're doin' Rag, you gotta fold in fire resist somewhere. And swapping hit cap vs mitigation gear is also a thing. It isn't hard to fill them bags with gear.
---
Cool, thanks. I don't mind doing full runs, but was in one yesterday that fell apart 2 hours in. That is the annoying part when the item I want is at the end. I should probably just go for mask of the unforgiven (58 rogue).
---
Mouth to ass, more sanitary
---
I'm sure I'll be recruited at some point.
---
So this is why I couldn't find any vendors with orange dye or bleach last night.
---
Why was i downvoted lol.... Literally said the same things as others... I just didnt add the part where you kill last boss and get buffs... But cool
---
**Lying by omission**, also known as a continuing misrepresentation or quote mining, occurs when an important fact is left out in order to foster a misconception. Lying by omission includes the failure to correct pre-existing misconceptions. For example, when the seller of a car declares it has been serviced regularly, but does not mention that a fault was reported during the last service, the seller lies by omission. It may be compared to dissimulation. An omission is when a person tells most of the truth, but leaves out a few key facts that therefore, completely obscures the truth.
---
That's crazy enough to be legit.
---
&gt; Warrriors were never supposed to wear leather.
---
Source on such a claim? at least i can tag you as a salty rogue player.
---
I don't blame you, I just think it's a little bit ridiculous to do that and then complain about anyone camping Dire Maul. At least for DM everyone going there should at least be 55+ and it's contested. SM alliance is forced to run to an instance within a minute of a major city in the 30s.
---
Not looking like crap is definitely BIS
---
Census addons which are super flawed, but the best option we have until Blizz releases and armory with access to the API (if they ever do that)
---
10 and a follow from me
---
Do that thing again where you say something edgy and everyone cringes.
---
Do it.
---
Did try that, and I got [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIkZD8WpznE) as result. For real. (No it's not Rick Roll)
---
Seems like the lashers loot tables aren't as lucrative as they were on private either. So swiping them away would not only be slower, but yield less money anyway.
---
Why quest when you can tank :)
---
Generally they alter functionality to break the addon.
---
Look at Classic LFG for example.
---
how much HP do they have? How many holy nova casts do you need/your amount of mana? wondering if you can farm it for xp before 60.
---
Tbc had good raids and arenas are fun but vanilla is so far ahead of all the expansions.
---
every version of wow has had bugs galore, not sure where you think they are falling *from*
---
\&gt; Probably
---
My nose itches.
---
Well if I'm still ML when nerubian slavemaker rolls around I won't be letting no stinky melee DPS roll until the hunters are kitted. I, like everyone, have my uncrossable lines.
---
I'm sure it is nice for the melee if they can afford the hit loss though. I'm not familiar with the bis lists for those classes for naxx-tier content.
---
Tip. Watch something else instead of being a giant dick.
---
This infuriates me, when the healer is drinking and some mage runs forward and starts frost bolting mobs to pull. Makes me wish I could ban people from the game.
---
I mean toxic as in the people who obsess over shit that doesn't affect them. In the case of Herod, it was the destination for the "mUh cLaSsIc eXpErIeNcE! yOu cAnT bLaCkLiSt mE, sTrEaMeR vIrGiNs!" crowd that got old real fast.
---
Its cool. I made this post to get recruited, thats all lol. No problemo.
---
Cool go get your gold then. Like why post in a thread of people talking about an item they DO want saying you don’t want it? Even still why have your post be a random reply to someone else’s reply post and not just make your own reply? What does your reply have to do with my reply? Is it your first day on Reddit?
---
Good luck. RP can be fun. Sad that in my language there is no RP PVP Server. This is just ridiculous. Why would I want to play on Non-PVP RP Servers? It makes no sense
---
Hand of Justice apparently. i got about 60 runs under by belt. lost the roll thrice
---
Lots of zones have mountain passes you can find. That been my side hobby lately.
---
over the years they have changed the way the lua scripting works in order to break addons that they don't like.
---
Imo it goes both ways, if you are the tank and you decide that dps gear is in your purview then the dps have the same right.
---
I'd say the juice isnt worth the squeeze personally.  It's really difficult to get to, takes a long time and groups often fall apart before you get there.  I've spent a lot and I mean A LOT of time in BRD on my Shaman and I've only done the 7 maybe 4 times.  Like I say, most groups dont go this far or this route because it's essentially a full clear.
---
The happy path is when he has to go to Dire Maul and isnt safe from being attacked and able to pick his battles like he can in SM.
---
Of course, the excitement behind wiping on a boss and then figuring it out is gone and it is because the community is just full of players that are so much better at the game. I said this going into classic that content would be easy up to aq40 and even then, it would still probably be not super difficult. We have had 15 years to figure stuff out and a plethora of information at our finger tips.
---
It was a thing in vanilla but supposedly it was in an earlier version than the one we are currently in. So while it was in vanilla it was fixed in the version we started at.
---
Sweater vest season is coming.
---
Damn that’s awesome! I’m in a townhouse right now so I don’t think I’d have the space for this setup but it would be cool to do something smaller scale. And good places to go/read about getting into home brewing?
---
True lots of subjectivity. Dungeons to me are boring to run more than once unless there is gear I really need from it. Although I do enjoy dungeons much much more with daggers than swords
---
And do it before they all get to the dungeon.
---
Actually in classic wow the rogue prebis list are wrong and almost all stat priorities are wrong.
---
In classic wow you only need 6% hit for a rogue that means only 1% hit from your gear is needed because of precision.
---
The bis list is 6/8 shadowcraft 2/2 devilsaur. The rest is normal prebis. hoj, mark of fordring etc.
---
Most people don't know this yet but this information will start spreading soon, combat daggers is also higher dps than combat swords aswell.
---
That being said I played tbc as a 12-15 yo, played a classic provate once since and have never been a raider. Ill Info is hard to find, everyone is talking abiut pre raid bis and as a future warrior tank I now understand that ill need defense and hit gear until i reach my "soft cap". I understand that that is because skull level will otherwise deal me too many crushing blows or ill just miss a lot and struggle to generate rage.
---
What that soft cap is remains a bit vague, I have yet to find a guide that explains (the math behind) these mechanics properly and doesnt go straight into pre rais bis. People just wanna see pictures ot gear when browsing yt i think.
---
I thought Anger/Emp were usually done together and Arena/Incendius.
---
Sorry for your loss man. Losing animals is awful. Big up this guy though, takes a truly nice person to behave selflessly like this.
---
Right? Common fucking sense.
---
You still have failed to contribute anything relevant to OP.
---
I'm sorry if you were insulted by my comment, but I consider myself a tryhard just the same and it wasn't meant in a derogatory fashion. I also spent a fair amount of my time playing this game min/maxing, because that's what I liked to do then. Maybe that's also what OP likes to do and it seems it is definitely what you like to do. Nothing wrong with that.
---
However, in context, OP is getting fucked by his guild leaders and council members, that much is obvious, and they are the fucktards who put their own interests ahead of the rest of their guild I was referring to, not you, I don't know you and I won't pretend I do, or that I know if you're retarded or not, although I'll do claim your comments here do make you sound a tad immature.
---
Now, you decided to take my comment out of its context and go ad hominem on me. Both are pointless ways to state your opinion. If you fail to see the difference between me calling OP's leadership fucktards and you calling me retarded, that's just sad, but this being the internet, it's nothing new.
---
&gt; You've already (...) expressed that your way of just having fun doing whatever is the superior way to play.
---
I did no such thing. I never even mentioned how I played before this specific comment, neither were you bothered to ask.
---
&gt; A second option is to ignore them and continue playing the way you want to play.
---
Which is exactly what I told OP should do. It seems we've at least reached an agreement there. People should play how they want to play. However, when "how they want to play" includes fucking OP in the ass, I can't help but suggest that OP gets out of that guild. Don't you agree with that assessment?
---
&gt; You on the other hand call them try hards, are completely satisfied being mediocre, and judge their way of playing to be wrong.
---
Yes, I judge that people who run Loot Council for the benefit of only a handful of their members are doing it wrong. Do you disagree with that opinion? They're effectively making all other guilds who run Loot Council loot bad, very bad. Again, do you disagree with that opinion?
---
&gt; There's no point arguing because thats something a dumb person would say.
---
Yet we're still arguing, and it seems we agree on a lot more things than you initially assumed. But hey, knee-jerk reactions and ad hominem "arguing" sure beats taking context into consideration and posting relevant comments, amirite?
---
&gt; The bar is so very low and that is why you see elitism everywhere.
---
Again, I consider myself an elitist, I push my rather casual friends to do their best, day after day and have been doing so for over a decade, but I do it in a constructive manner and for the benefit of the entire guild. I don't believe that people who run Loot Council for their own personal benefit and who go as far as charging an Herbalist who contributed stacks after stacks of herbs to the guild bank are the kind of people anyone should want to play with. Do you?
---
&gt; Failing at something in wow does not make you bad at wow, never trying and deriding those that do succeed makes you bad at wow.
---
See, if I thought what you wrote there was remotely applicable to my situation, I might take your attempts at insulting me personally, but as I see things, you simply decided to go apeshit on a random person, like you're probably used to do regularly and I'm today's lucky winner.
---
&gt; You are bad at wow.
---
Again, that's an assumption you're making based on an impression you decided to have of me after reading a comment, taking it out of its context and deciding to be butthurt about it. I don't think I'm at fault here. If you could calm down, take a deep breath and re-consider this discussion, perhaps you'll change your mind about every assumption you've made so far, but you probably won't, so I won't push you to do something that goes against your character, because quite frankly, I simply don't care about you or what you think.
---
Unless you somehow decide to change your perspective on this "debate", I think we're done here.
---
Have a nice day.
---
I haven't seen too many magetards actually.  Mages are so OP that even going full tard means you will still be useful to the group.
---
Rogues are fine because they don't do the AOE spam as much as other classes and have threat lowering abilities.  If they grab threat its usually only 1 mob.
---
Worst by far are DPS warriors.  First red flag is why aren't they tanking themselves.  Then they rush in 0.5 sec after you and drop a Sweeping strikes whirlwind bomb.  Their epeen meter tops charts but they are usually not worth the stress and chaos.  Second worse is usually enh shaman.
---
As long as lord gigadick applies his freezes and slows to the entire pack he just pulled off of you, we can still manage it pretty good. He's gotta have a full tank of mana ready to go however, because those mobs all need to be just about dead by the time he gets tired and runs out of firepower. At least as a druid, I got a taunt, a stun, and a charge stun ready to go every 10 seconds or so to keep mobs under control until they're dead. This is kind of our AOE tanking ability in these situations, lol. This isn't too big of a deal as long as it's being executed properly.
---
I think I just dont like shaman healing lol. Going to try a ele/resto instead.
---
Feel like “Lv 60 dwarf / finally exalted with SW” is more fitting.
---
&gt; a lot of the 8.3 features are actually pretty cool, but the slow progress and stuff in classic is just so much more appealing.
---
One of the problems with Retail WoW, for me, is it's now too convenient. I know that sounds very weird, but, well, yeah.
---
Not at all champ, calm down. 
---
Just trying to show that gear isn’t everything. Skill is way more important.
---
It had a good drop rate in vanilla. I never played on private servers, but I used to farm the dust in vanilla for PvP. Felt like 30-40% back then.
---
We've already had one seasonal event.
---
You're*
---
Alright but if they wouldn’t be doing the run without that incentive then they aren’t effecting you in any way, shape or form. Would you be this angry if someone posted something in the auction house for too much? No. You would just buy a reasonably priced item. But to each their own.
---
And again, that’s just life. 
---
I think we all want that, but most of us just understand it is what it is. 
---
Hopefully you got your anguish out of your system and you can move ahead, having learned to be more careful. 
---
As much as our current generation of millennials want it to be otherwise, we are the ones that need to adapt to the world around us, not the reverse.
---
how does that make sense tho? im really confused
---
Actually Unyielding Maul is BiS currently until Phase 3, as Warden Staff cannot get Iron Counterweight put on it. Once P3 comes out we get the +15 Agi Wep enchant and Warden Staff comes out on top again (albeit barely).
---
Rogues don't need 9% hit? Not counting racials or talents ofc. 
---
Dont play rogue so I'm not familiar.
---
You are def. at a disadvantage in PVP if you don't heavily use macros and addons. I play 100% clean, myself, with pretty limited macros and I still manage to have loads of fun!
---
Im Top 3 in over half the raid bosses in MC 2 weeksin a row. I compete with 2 sword rogues. 
---
You don't know shit about rogues. I'm using a 15/31/5 Combat daggers build and have some nice pieces of gear.
---
Its amazing how many people don't understand that this kind of mentality is turning games to shit.
---
If you're not enjoying "grinding" why are even doing it?
---
Lol crying that I called you out on your bullshit makes me "a loser who doesn't have fun" really kid?
---
Or like you, showing up in every thread with pure garbage.
---
Strength adds attack power which adds to your damage. A weapons dmg is static on the item. Check your characters stat screen to see the dps after attack power calculations. 
---
Ravager’s ability is crazy tho when fighting multiple opponents either in dungeons or solo. If the dps on the items is the same you wanna use the 20 str for single target dmg
---
I mean, kinda. Queues were HUGE at launch, how did they magically go away even when the pop didn't drop? Oh yeah, THEY ADDED LAYERS. But these guys keep insisting layering doesn't affect server cap lol... Dear god
---
"stole" it's literally BiS right now for fury wars
---
I saw a Fury warrior wearing a bunch of leather gear.  Looked like a complete virgin, just shook my big plate wearing head and walked away.
---
Exactly, that’s not banning. Two completely different things
---
Literal child. Enjoy your night son.
---
Don't worry you prob got to go outside when it mattered
---
This, unfortunately.
---
Check our skarmtank on YouTube has a lot of info on fury/prot tanking
---
100% agreed. I no-life'd my way to 60 and enjoyed the hell out of it, but it's not for everyone. Play how you want, and let others play how they want. Such a simple concept that many people fail to grasp.
---
Sure unless you are taming and keeping a particular pet for looks or attack speed (broken tooth).  In those situations, you have to make sure to keep them "updated" regularly or you will have a grind ahead of you.
---
By your standard all gear is cosmetic then. Cause MC/Ony can be cleared in greens with half the raid not 60 yet. It’s more TPS and better Mitigation than Mirah’s Song which is what I have currently. How is that purely cosmetic?
---
wait what?  which two slots?
---
&gt; Gotta love reddit when people clearly half read what I say and downvote because their attention span is too short to see where I actually asked to be told if im wrong lol.
---
Just watch the video? He goes over how you can do it without killing a single mob.
---
Its just a game dude.  If you and the rogue share an upgrade of course he should roll need.
---
You'd be amazed at the shit people will let you get away for just because they're desperate to have a good tank lol
---

That's nice, still has nothing to do with what I said.
---
I guess you didn't raid during ICC huh? The addon in this video that draws the circles and arrows on the floor was completely banned by Blizzard by modifying their API. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fimaiHFp3aM
---
Top 3 in your trash guild means literally nothing. Post your logs or shut up. 
---
No one cares about your spec, it’s a cold fact that sword beats daggers until Naxx.
---
This is a complete lie.
---
Of course they do. That's why all the big servers had a big spike in queue times whenever they reduced the 'max layer' count.
---
Typical alliance tho
---
Yellow attack hits result from magical affects and skills, and white attack hits result from attack swings. Yellow attack hits also tend to be either from instant effects or casted. Briefly, yellow attack hits require less hit% to prevent Misses, while white hits require more.
---
I am human and they do stack
---
Interesting read! Smart thinking!
---
Wait did Vanilla players really thought that you could only do MC if you don't have a life? MC is piss easy lmao
---
Every drop in MC is better. You don’t need QS lol.
---
better for me, its amazing how many people think druid tanks are shit. I get whisper after almost every group to add me to their friend list.  Easier to get into groups when no one wants to tank lol.
---
The worst. Always skip him.
---
oh for fuck's sake.
---
I have yet to run into a single PvPer who holds a candle to the guys I used to regularly duel, spar with or just fight in world PvP.
---
The closest I've seen was a freaking fire mage playing oldschool style and adapting his tactics on the fly when I did things like pop a fire reflector, but he'd be above average back in the day and not a standout.
---
Helm and weapon for feral
---
Why not? Not every realm has queues. Why would they hold back content from everyone because one server is overpopulated?
---
Wow you must be totally fun at parties....
---
What I added for sure has something to do with what you were talking about.
---
&gt;Read my post properly next time. Let me reiterate  it doesn't matter what Blizzard Decides or Endorses, it is what the Player Base chooses. Since the majority of Classic Players (and those on this Subreddit) are of the Opinion that DM= Deadmines then that is what it is going to be to the majority. Once again slang changes and evolves over the years.
---
Trololololollllllll...  this post is literally about an officially published guide.  But nah let’s keep dismissing what’s been put into writing for what players “think”.  0 credibility on your opinion at this point.
---
&gt;Also just because Blizzard "endorsed" the guide doesn't mean it is 100% fact Master Looter has always been Master Looter but the guide says it is called Designated Looter. It has clearly wrong facts.
---
Technically, a Master looter IS the person designated to handle loot.  Still 0 credibility that you’re nothing more than trolling at this point.
---
&gt;Let me finish this off with a turn around. Why don't you provide evidence that Blizzard has ever said that DM= Dire Maul and nothing else?
---
I’m specifically discussing Deadmines in this post, I’ve made no claims one way or another what Dire Maul is supposed to be called.  Why are you dragging a whole different dungeon into the discussion?  If you actually have anything credible to contribute maybe I could take you’re option seriously, but at this point I see nothing but a thinly veiled attempt at trolling by making yourself look misinformed.
---
Ah, you must be a radical centrist. That explains quite a bit.
---
Okay, I get that. But if you’re looking for collusion  (which isn’t against the TS btw) you have to have the proof.
---
You can just say that because X player never kills Y player that they are colluding. There is no rule that states you have to kill every player or no players.
---
And you can’t use the screenshots of third party conversations because there’s no way to link those convos to the players.
---
&gt; Solo ~~Incendius~~? As a Warrior?  
---
Fixed
---
I loved going 4 points parry to start out, 1/3 improved rend, tactical mastery, anger management, improved overpower, finish off 3/3 rend then 3/3 deep wounds and 5/5 parry.  1/5 2h weapon spec, 1/1 sweeping strikes, 2/5 axe spec, 5/5 2h weapon spec, 3/3 imp. hamstring, 1/1 mortal strike.  
---
The reason is I like to run dungeons and arms with tactical mastery allows me to perform well questing and have rage to use as tools in dungeons to taunt and sunder to stay on top of the threat table I had lost.
---
Alliance gets roasted on Incendius
---
You have to rank up to get the PvP gear, don't assume you'll be able to get it quickly. But yeah it's pretty good.
---
It's not accurate info hut it's all we have.
---
haha do you mash that frostbolt key extra hard or what? skill caps for dps rotations in classic are super low.
---
It's simple, bring more Horde and win the tags.
---
What if my fun is accomplishment? Are all esports a joke to you?
---
I feel the same way.  Did a pug run that was like herding cats.  Did one with a few friends and with was smooth as butter.
---
The damage reduction difference for expose armor is greater against more lightly armored opponents.
---
Question to all hunters: did you buy your mount at 40? Or wait?
---
"Escord npcs move way too fast" was too clear indication of troll.
---
Yeah your right that is the correct grammar that he should have used.
---
Hey here's a message for all the tanks: 
---
Do you want to be able to pvp, do damage out in the open world, and also help your friends and others by devoting lots of effort to being in charge of a dungeon and caring about the wellbeing of the group and teaching and guiding? 
---
That sounds great. Fuck you piece of shit, you are going to have to pay a large, large amount of gold if you actually want to respec on a regular basis. Why? Because we decided to delete all of the decisions that were ever made such as allowing more than one spec. Is that a good reason? Fuck you bitch! Fuck everyone who made a spec that helps the group, fucking die responsible group members, fuck your gold, fuck yourself and uninstall. Wow: Classic!
---
Iirc blizzard said that since the game is up to patch 1.12, the holidays that were out during vanilla 1.12 are going to be in current classic.
---
Don't think he'd ever be exalted with another faction irl lol
---
Still its a risk, and the fight is very chaotic and hard as it is
---
So we choose to kill the lashers beforehand :)
---
QS is farmable drops in MC are not bro. You don’t “Need” gold either mah dude.
---
that's rude :(
---
No. It was only a thing in vanilla for a short time. DM was released in 1.3 and by 1.5 it had been nerfed. There's comments from back then with people bitching about the nerf identical to what we have now. 
---
Here's a repost of some of the comments someone posted in the thread discussing it.

although not quite as kickass anymore, less xp per kill, still though grinding them still nets a decent amount of cash (through the greys they drop) and greens.

These mobs were nerfed literally while I was pulling. I zoned in and got 225 per mob, zoned out, reset, came back in and got 65 per kill 📷 Either way I went from 52-58 in 2 days of casual play.

Credit to [Djmy](https://www.reddit.com/user/Djmy/) for finding this.
---
I play warrior. But I do agree with your statement.
---
Just because rotations are easy, doesn’t mean everyone does skillfully. I have ran with way more bad players than I have good.
---
I never ever said it's the only stat that matters. I said it matters alot though. Thats pretty obvious but thanks.
---
Yea so as a troll you will get rhok delar at a 50% drop ratw. You arent going to take the rare, BiS melee bow until AQ as a temporary upgrade when leaf is 50% drop in that dungeon, and is also a bow.
---
Also 100% hit chance during the proc.
---
Thank you, it's tough, but we're very happy with his final year.  He got to go to the beach for 10 days last month and had a blast, just like he did as a young pup.  But yeah, compassion as it was shown to me definitely makes a big difference.  I am very thankful
---
It's  not weird, it makes plenty of sense. I look at it this way:
---
Retail is all about being reactive, moving quick, and accomplishing all the things you want in a given time frame. A whole bunch of small easily attained goals are not very  satisfying.
---
Classic is all about planning and forethought. Routes, consumables, pulls, etc. The amount of work that goes into accomplishing one goal is significantly higher, and therefore more  rewarding.
---
Personally I would shoot for the PVP gear. As a shadow priest it's much harder to get raiding gear because most groups will only allow one Shadow priest if any in to MC. Plus you're going to have to go against every Mage and warlock for that gear.
---
Layering is a replacement for sharding because of the issues caused by sharding.   They serve the same purpose.
---
If you think layering is designed to increase the server capacity (it's not) why did we have queues with layering?
---
Come to Grobbulus then. Alliance side. Look up the guild &lt;Obsidian Sun Company&gt; we can see if you like the fit, if not we know what guilds would probably fit better.
---
Real story, no vid, get ganked in desolace by 10 allies, 8~ levels higher than me (50's)

They camp my body per usual. So I wait them out for a solid 2 minutes.

Then, one sees a big bear and shoots it without hesitation.

Rexxar in all his alpha male glory pulls out 2 axes and goes to work on these chumps.

They never stood a chance.

5 dead bodies lay in his wake as I res.

I run up to rexxar, walking slowly, like and champion and click.

I try not to fangirl /thank him and go on my way.

Thank you Rexxar.

Imagine being as bad as that mage

I remember seeing your initial UD warrior sketches weeks ago. Just sitting here wondering how you just hit level 40 🤷‍♂️ Regardless, gl out there!
---
If that's the case, most likely your .toc file would be named correctly, but the folder that contains it would not match.  You shouldn't have to touch the contents of the folder, just the name of the folder itself.
---
Yes I know it takes some grinding but grinding pvp can be loads of fun, doing the same dungeon for the 30th time not so much.
---
Well I mean he did add.  Your answer is also good though I feel the same even if raid weps technically are better. Fook em.   GL on your search
---
Come at me bro
---
Impressive. I mean I will agree that I was spendy. I'm betting I would have been right around 75g had I not bought stupid items which is still short. I also didn't have any standout items drop though, pretty much had 0 AH items all the way through 40. Not arguing, just putting in 2 cents.
---
That is different then a guild truly raiding MC.
---
It isn't going to be a required raid, and when you are pushing for lotheb you are looking at 20 people to clear for TF. And the will to clear for TF decreases as your tanks get them.
---
&gt;You still have failed to contribute anything relevant to OP.
---
I don't understand why you're so stuck on that, and frankly I never will for the reasons mentioned above. I was never talking to OP, I never replied to OP. I replied to you.

Some simple examples:

#showtooltip

/use [mod:shift] Immolate; Curse of Agony
---
/use [stance:1/2] Berserker Stance; Berserker Rage
---
The first one will show the tooltip of Curse of Agony, unless you press Shift. Then it will show Immolate.
---
The second one will show the tooltip of Berserker Stance if you're in Battle or Defensive Stance. If you're in Berserker Stance, it will show Berserker Rage.

I heard the stack of firefin sell for 1-2 g

It's not 'server caps', it's 'layer caps'. Each layer has a maximum number of players.

I’m not taking his side, just stating what everyone else knows who plays this game. He’s smart enough to not break TOS as his livelihood and income is based on him playing this game.

Outside of a GM intervening no one can stop a guy with X000 followers bowing to his will.

and then you wipe (up?)

Did the tiger finish him?
---
Im a boomkin and always get whispers expressing amazement but rarely any group invites for 5 mans. I just wana play :&lt;
---
&gt; Thanks for offering fuck all to the discussion though...good job.
---
Well you didn't answer the question though, why haven't you farmed the money if you want it?
---
&gt; Its amazing how many people don't understand that this kind of mentality is turning games to shit.
---
I think its doing the total opposite, actually. Are you familiar with the concept of a Skinner Box in games? 
---
Games that dont have fun core game-play will build massive Skinner boxes (like leveling up and gear acquisition) to supplement the fact that the game itself is not that fun or involved. 
---
Thats why I always appreciated games like Street Fighter. There is no gear, no levels, no artificial progression. The game has to stand entirely on its own. Either the fight holds your interest or it doesnt.
---
Glad I'm not the only one, level 33 priest , played since release.  Stupid grown up life.
---
ah ok that makes more sense. ty
---
It wasn't literally impossible. You would just have to be lucky and get the right combinations in the stomach... Everything has to go your way so with that said it's not impossible just unlikely.
---
I definitely struggled with the resist at first. It became critical for me not to blow an ice block unless absolutely necessary in those 15 minutes so that you can still have an emergency cold snap button.
---
I watched the video and tried to replicate the roundabout hill pull of four mobs and wiped twice too many times before saying fuck it I'll just pull at my own pace and find my max limit without wiping. I ended up doing the first pull, then the bottom two groups, then the one at the top of the hill, and then finishing off the back three groups with ice block and forst barrier as they gathered. The key for me was that if anything resisted with the bigger pulls, I had the cold snap oh shit as a failsafe.
---
Eventually got it to that 15k per run, 60k per hour cadence where each run clocked in at 12 mins and corpse run just about 5 mins
---
&gt; Horns or Eranikus
---
That's a mail helm...
---
ally or horde?
---
Yeah, pretty soon you'll be crushing and blowing through mobs quick with little downtime. Focus on feline swiftness for 20 when you get cat, will help immensely. Travel form at 30 is faster, but at 30% increase outdoors in dps form is amazing.
---
I'm on deviate delight. Most players dont, but if you look for it you will find it. I walk in on rp  sessions fairly often.
---
wrong race
---
APES should have played on Feralina just to outplay these fuckers!
---
Shaman: *purges harder than someone who ate an entire box of Ragna-Os*
---
Im sorry about what ever happened to you to make you so hateful. 
---
I hope you find that changing your message from one of hate to one of love and compassion is much more powerful.
---
That was probably the hardest raid encounter.
---
I wouldn't expect much out of BWL either. Guilds are still going to steamroll it.
---
Yeah wrath is where I started to fall off too. It changed too much and I lost interest there.
---
Yes you can solo open world mobs but in order to do things like solo Princess runs or solo tribute runs effectively (still remains to be seen if this is even possible) you need to be some variation of Balance/Resto. Without the proper talents, killing Princess takes like 13 minutes, making the g/hr far far less efficient.
---
Happy to be proven wrong if you provide said source
---
Dude.. If you put your time into it.. Feral dps can compete
---
It wasn't really about "skill" or "being good" it was literally impossible from a math / design standpoint.
---
I'm sorry but you need to read that again. Layering is slicing the pie, not increasing it.
---
You wanna go? I’ll make a Reddit post about you, son
---
It's not just "making a list", it's rigidly adhering to that list and not straying for anyone else. It's demanding that we skip entire swaths of content "because there's no BiS", etc
---
&gt; What if my fun is accomplishment? 
---
Dont play a video game?
---
&gt; Are all esports a joke to you?
---
Yea? I mean that depends on what you mean by joke, though. Godbless if you can play a game you love and make some money. Have at it. I just dont consider them real sports, which ya know is just my opinion.
---
Right...but the reason one is 20g and the other is 150g is because it's worth 150g.
---
So much this! It's insane to me that these people who try so hard to understand layering just simply cant understand this.
---
Some people ran it on alts, generally with 20-30 people. With a handful of mains after a specific item. But it wasn't a "guild raid" as in it wasn't a raid with an expectation of raiders being available. It was done either before/after a raid or on an off night.
---
That is significantly different then doing it on a raid night.
---
10-25 (you dont have enough spirit to make spirit stacking very useful, focus int)
---
25-40 (you have a sizable mana pool and some decent heals, focus on spirit for regen. Focus on big heals and then letting spirit regen mana)
---
40-55 (pretty all around. Solid talents, solid gear. Get a bit of everything)
---
55-60 (healing power and mp5 gear.) Ypu’ll be raiding and thats more of a “marathon” than dungeons. You want to be tossing out small heals in bulk as a triage, or throwing out big heals as the main healer. Look for addons to see what other priest/healers are casting on target to not waste mana.
---
It it more lucrative to make the pots and sell those?
---
I'm shocked buying gold is still against the tos, supporting Chinese farmers is definitely part of supporting the honor of China.
---
If your rogues aren't topping the charts then your guilds rogues should be gkicked. 
---
Second, I never said daggers beats swords. But my Combat daggers build will easily destroy a feral druid. Stop changing the subject.
---
Bro that happened to me with my rogue poison quest in westfall. That undead mob you’re supposed to pick pocket, he literally chased me all the way to sentinel hill it was ridiculous
---
At that point you should just stun lock to death 100-0
---
Maybe in AQ and Naxx. In MC? Nah, sorry man you're just incorrect.
---
Bro more like typical mage lol
---
They are. Now post your logs or shut up.
---
Fuck off dork
---
Hardly, epic mount increases your gold/hour substantially
---
LFG was pretty bad. Dungeons being a pain in the ass to find groups for certainly made people work together more and added a lot of variety. There's only so much you can do to ensure certain group compositions in dungeons in Classic when it took you a half hour to assemble a group for Mara, for example.
---
Yeah for sure vanish. I’ve pulled the boss a couple times on the last coffer. No reason you couldn’t do it without gear on. I’d suggest using an alt and doing the reset trick though as it’s slightly quicker than running back to the entrance.
---
Maybe HK
---
Lol, you know some people are independently wealthy right? Hell of an assumption that everyone who plays wow a lot are poor
---
Definitely not any contests of any sorts, that’s for sure
---
what is RMT
---
Yup it offended some SJW and now is considered offensive.
---
Wouldn’t it nearly be faster just to take the boats to Wetland ?
---
Pally one? if theres even that many people

There are dozens of us!
---
Lol that mage sucks.
---
have you tried yelling before the pull?
---
He's a big guy
---
Found the mage
---
nice to see some friendly exchanges on Reddit, good job being civil guys
---
&gt;on the streamer server
---
Sorry to derail a bit but are all the streamers on Faerelina? I'm not a big streamer guy but I occasionally see suggested videos for this Asmongold guy and a couple others. Did they all coordinate onto one server? Do they all also play Alliance?
---
I am 100% serious. They move so fast, you barely have time to heal/drink up. But I guess anyone who doesn't lick blizzards ass has to be a troll.
---
Gear guides or not looking up what the quest rewards are from dungeons is not uncommon, and that one stands out like skyscraper as to how good it is. I think as a mage I used that and the quest reward wand into my 50s.
---
Nope, just his head :) all five of them
---
Typical alliance, taking a 1v1. 
---
Unlike the overpopulated horde normies who only fight with a numbers advantage.
---
Yes, they already have
---
&gt; I replied to you.
---
Yes, you did.
---
You took my reply to OP out of its context and decided take build a "discussion" around that.
---
I'm not sure what your intent was. I'm also not surprised that's the only part of my previous comment you were bothered to reply to.
---
Did you even read the rest?
---
Yes, and I was pointing out it wasn't for very long, from March 7th to July 12th 2005 according to wowhead's archived comments.
---
&gt; Aggro that was lost because you didn't mark who you wanted to take down first!
---
Allow me to let you in on a little secret. There's such function as "assist" (default keybind - F). You tab target a random mob, press assist 2 times and you are automatically targeting the same mob as the tank. If that's not enough, get an addon that shows mob plates with debuffs on them, the one with most sunders is the one you want. 
---
And if that mob is not the healer, you can still kick/blind the healer so it doesn't heal and get back to wailing on the tank's target. 
---
And get the goddamn threat meter. 
---
&gt; not even hamstringing him
---
Hamstring doesn't work in defensive stance and while the warrior can stance dance that comes with a lot of caveats. And if you want to go down that route, I might ask where's your crippling poison? Where's your gauge? Where's your kidney shot? Where's your blind?
---
&gt; Also the boss is red leveled to MOST of us
---
You know what's worse than dead weight in the party? Whining and obnoxious dead weight. Either stop running dungeons outside of your level range or shut up and do your job is my advice to you.
---
Oh yeah I dont do weapon switch macros for disarm
---
Lvl 31 rogue
---
Lvl 21 priest
---
Played for 1.5 months, and I’ve played every expansion, I just have a lot of work lol.
---
Flight master controls the griffins, but the character is actually directing the creature, but the creature refuses to to fly over certain areas?  That’s my head cannon
---
What are your thoughts on DW fury? Did a raid with an OT recently who was DW and didn't have amazing gear and died 5-6 times on trash (no wipes).
---
Harvest festival
---
I made it as a joke, and I agree with you. I fell like a lot of potential tanks give up because people put to much pressure on then. Bugs the hell of me that you take AN HOUR to get a tank, and when you to you cant wait half a sec between pulls.
---
It certainly isn't easy ....
---
I can't really relate to what your saying, I'm a pretty hardcore player myself, got most of my prebis done before MC and then kept getting them after I started raiding. That said, I ran many times in pug with the same people because they too, were farming their pre-bis, made a bunch of friends that way.
---
Then there is the guild runs where you get to know the small subset of people whom you'll be doing most of your activities with, a community inside a community. That includes dungeons, raids, PvP (gurubashi for example). Going hard at the game doesn't mean you forego what makes it a game.
---
I don't have any problem with people taking it slow, not caring about raid or whatever, but don't assume everyone that goes hard at it isn't enjoying their experience. They just go about it in a different way.
---
I have no idea what is BiS for me and I don't care. If I see upgrade, I roll and I don't care about everyone else. I'm not stupid to play by someone's guides, I'm smart enough to make my own play style.
---
Feel BED knowms
---
no he exploded because of my amazing gamer power  
---
&gt;!I'm pretty sure that's what happened, yeah.!&lt;
---
Lvl 40 Dwarf*
---
Not 40 lvl dwarf.
---
Is that why my macro to equip my 1H and Shield (/equip Name of 1H /equip Name of Shield) only equipped my Shield and not my 1H? I switched the order (/equip Name of Shield /equip Name of 1H) and now it works fine.
---
Only on Reddit could you be downvoted for telling the literal truth
---
I wish I could draw
---
The daggers I believe but aren’t all those other weapons a bit slow for tanking?
---
My guild, like many guilds, 1 phased rag on our first attempt. 
---
The content is trivial, the man can have a BRE......I don't understand this argument against it. There is plenty of room for people to NOT play 100% meta defining builds....hell I remember back in 2005 when I first went into MC I was mace combat speccd on my rogue with Mass of McGown...
---
Druids can use guns???
---
Anyone knows the best way to self boost in this case?
---
Is “The Arcanist Cookbook” censored in China? Its a play on “The Anarcist Cookbook” which is for sure on Chinas shitlist.
---
8 agility still requires regular black diamonds but they are so easy to get i doubt black diamonds will sell at all
---
I'm a proud member of this guild on Firemaw-EU Alliance!
---
I'm the wrong person to ask since classic is my first time playing WoW.  You'll output more damage with staff of shade, but you will be squishier.  Kill a handful of camps that are your level with each and see which one feels better to you :)
---
Still waiting on that edit.
---
Some warriors don’t wanna tank every dungeon they do, but I get where you are coming from. Thing is, at least from my stand point, you should let the dps know you are adding a % tax to their roles before hand.
---
Mmm, yes. I do rather enjoy his filmography. Indubitably.
---
Truu.  Forgot about the AOE magic.
---
RIP warlocks trying to get anything over mages omega

No one has edited any comments in this chain. 
---
Man, you're having a rough day today.
---
What a weird hill to die on.
---
I wouldnt drop either. Herbalism and alch made me a killing today with frost oil alone. And one of the best selling items is Major Mana Potions, if you can get the recipe for that or flasks your set. One BiS chestpiece is not worth switching a profession over. I feel tailoring makes no money besides mooncloth and bags. Even then you can only get Mooncloth on a CD. If you do decide to switch one keep herb and just sell every herb you find. 
---
Btw the alternative to the BiS chestpiece isnt much worse and wont make a major difference in dps. Plus your gonna be out a lot of money for the recipe, mats, and skilling tailoring to 300.
---
FaceOff
---
Agreed.

Lightning MuhQueen

I won it on my first run, same for Witchblade. RNG gives and RNG takes away.
---
Oh dude, Im not going down this rabbit hole with another gamer. Been down it way too many times before. If you cant see the difference between optimizing your clicks in Star Craft and dunking a basketball there is really nothing I can say. Its great you guys love it and support it as a sport, don't let me stop you.
---
Yeah I just derp'd and didnt go for Pristine Black Diamonds when they were super cheap and was really confused why these were so cheap. Ah well shit happens.
---
China?
---
Sorry but non elite, non player enemies hardly count.

8 hours spread out of farming for this pattern... no sinew

I’m planning to do twins tanking in AQ, but I still always ask b4 I need shadow resist
---
Warkock
---
Is this a fellow Niagara College Knight??? What program you in man?
---
Druids for PvP are guerillas. They are good at infiltrating and causing havoc. You won't have some of the insanity that the other classes can get away with, but you'll be a stealth healer, dps, or tank with good escapes when needed. You have a lot of options once you're comfortable with your full kit and it's easy to catch people off guard with your versatility.
---
cooked sagefish doesn't sell at all on my server. I might as well vendor it.
---
The smallest movement will cancel/break the feign. Have to be absolutely still to pull off the combo. As you said, lag could be making it more difficult.
---
im 56 on my 2nd toon
---
Ok thanks Im new too but you reached the same conclusion so I will try it out thanks
---
Got witch blade the first time it dropped (I think 2nd run total), but still no hat ( or frost robes/gloves from ras)
---
Fish in a Bucket. He's on the bridge at Desolace. You can load up with fish from the cages, and turn them in repeatedly without needing to grab the quest first.
---
I experience input/channeling lag, which I think is the same thing.  I have a 2019 iMac vega 48.  Sometimes when casting a spell, the cast bar fails to complete and I just stand there.  Sometimes it finally casts; other times I have to re-start WoW.  I've noticed it's worse in certain zones.  Dustwallow marsh is horrible.  Fishing is damn near impossible there.  Funny thing is, when I'm in a group, it rarely happens.  Thank god because I'm the healer.
---
because as a guild tank you should focus on the progress of your raid. which includes passing in dps weapons for dps and spending your time getting QS. its a question who profits the most of it. 2people fighting over 1 item or 2 people getting each an item.
---
people always forget that raiding is a team activity. giving your team a boost is good.
---
if you are a solo player tank, disregard
---
Yes. They coordinated this publicly for a few months so fans would know and those who were not interested could avoid them. 
---
There’s a few other streamers on other servers but the big ones all went to the same server.
---
Also they are on both factions.
---
Hello again! Didnt realize its you in both threads. 
---
Umm yea I cant say Ive played any ubisoft games lately. You ever try any of the Wargamming titles? Tanks, Warships? Theyve got a pretty great model.
---
I, uh, fished up a blue staff in STV.  Can I make a post about that?
---
Good points, just gonna make sure you know both maul and swipe both earn bonus threat.
---
A nice gusset on this one.
---
Yeah.  You'd probably be ok just informing them and not even asking.  Suppose asking is a bit more polite.
---
I have a lvl 30 paladin and I'm thinking of going holy (not enjoying ret lvling and I'm gonna be holy at 60 anyway). Is that a bad idea? Is it viable to just spec healing and do 30-60 through dungeons?
---
Can i create a new char (troll) to buy and send to my main (undead)?
---
Here's a sample  build - There are some points you could move around if you wanted  to  tank more or less. For example you could pick up Primal  Fury if you wanted to tank a lot, but  this  build  is a mix of DPS talents, threat boosting talents, soloing talents (Furor for example) and the Resto talents you most need.
---

It does. Leveled as arms, tactical mastery really opened it up.
---
I think you win the casual olympics.
---
If people are willing to put that much effort into acquiring a resource then whatever value it goes for on the AH is the value of that resource. Just go farm that gold however you find most easy and farm the gold instead of the resource. Its not like you can't acquire the gear.
---
What do you want Blizzard to do? Should they have access to private Discord channels to monitor this?
---
Lol lol lol lol lol
---
Thank you, I needed a good laugh.
---
what the hell?! how
---
this is not possible unless you did farming/AHing.
---
I saw it drop once. On my first run ever of ZF. I passed on it because the other mage had a shit staff comparatively. I wish I rolled need.
---
Super high quality shit post
---
Lol both sides do that. Horde will at least move on. I got body camped by 6+ people multiple times for no reason
---
\-This is Art !
---
thanks for this masterpiece
---
The 8piece also gives your 5piece two additional chances to proc the mana refund.
---
Oh wow, these are great. I need to make a bunch of these now.
---
Its about 40s+ per flower.
---
Gloves i've basically just given up on until arcanist for the 3 piece and am rolling with my dreamweave. Robes I was able to craft my archmage a week or two ago.
---
I've only been 60 for almost 4 weeks now and only done 3 bosses in MC.  My guild currently is still waiting for everyone to level up to 60 before we get into MC, so I'm helping anyone and everyone I can with collecting Pre-BiS gear.  It's been quite enjoyable because I feel a real connection to the guild and it's members.
---
Personally, I'm not in a huge hurry to get into MC - the gear just really isnt that good.  I know there are some massive upgrades for certain classes but as a whole, the loot is pretty meh and often gear from DM/UBRS/BRD is on-par or better than MC loot.  I'm trying to find a group of guys, similar to me who enjoy the game and want to help eachother.  So, I will wait for my guild to catch up and then experience the sweet sweet Ragnaros kill with people that I actually care about.
---
Skull of impending doom and parachute cloak have been my best friends while mountain climbing. Nogginfogger gives you a crazy slow fall for 2 minutes as well
---
You get a pass today Dildozer.
---
just bought my first mount at level 41! no question just wanted to share my success :D
---
If you care about best in slot raiding gear, then you should count talents. With talents, you only need 1% hit from gear.
---
He probably has shatter which gives a 50% crit chance on frozen targets with enough talents. But it was a very very stupid opener. 
---
Looks like he rezzed (health and Mana low) and tried to kill the rogue. His mistake was the Nova putting him on threat meter and not having ice armor on (again, since he just rezzed)
---
Druid or paladin, dungeon spamming as heal or tank to get to 60, casual alt, mainly for tanking dungeons and pvp plus doing some raids here and there. I hear druids are better tanks in dungeons than paladins because of mana, but I love paladins, especially ret and holy. Should I just go paladin?
---
Isn't that what's happening in China right now?
---
&gt;Typical \[same faction players\], doing \[thing I approve of\].  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Unlike \[other faction players\], who are \[insult\] and \[do things I don't approve of\].
---
You're an idiot.
---
Ok I give this to them, + funny bros, but gnomes need to burn in endless doom.
---
The original incarnation of Hallow's End went live in October 2005. The files were included with patch 1.8.
---
LMFAO no its not, it is literally just the Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger track played at a lower BPM with his lyrics over it.
---
The next grind after I get this damn trinket.
---
the general classic rogue discord has been buzzing about hit rating requirements being totally wrong from pservers. you require a lot less hit and the prebis lists are fucked. shadowcraft set bonus is actually good.
---
It's because they removed layering. Noticed how the realm doesn't say "layered" anymore
---
3% less if you do have a racial.
---
My first time playing something else than a caster and I swear it dropped every single time.
---
Generally 10 days /played at an average pace.
---
That is sweet :)
---
A wise man once said, “Run away, little girl!”
---
LMAO thank you for the good laugh dude
---
Yes, I understand this. I am hoping to test it /wait will wait for a GCD. I have my error messages disabled already.
---
i actually like Robes of the Exalted, but, i also play a Female NE, so, that's probably part of it. it looks terrible on male characters.
---
Hello all! How come my hunter pet had negative training points after taming it?
---
How does that work? You gain much more experience from mobs and quest at higher levels. And then there's the faster movement speed from having a mount to reduce travel time too. Or does lvl 42 being the halfway point account for those things?
---
It's a public section, so what? If you found it, so may others. Second, how is that ANY different from any discussion on the internet? Third, why does it being in the past make it less likely for someone to check back? Fourth, imagine everything we'd lose if we only would read and respond to what has been written in the last 15 years. We'd have no classic, for starters...
---
You know that Vanish removes Hunters Mark?
---
Maul is super slow. Without swipe you wont be holding aggro on more than 3 mobs
---
Duskwood will always be one of my favorites. But I love all the human starting zones.
---
dude people literally unzip their pants and go hogwild anytime anyone who has ever played a private server is wrong about anything. it's fucking hilarious
---
More rage is being built up whether you cancel it or not. The canceling part has 0 to do with why heroic strike is being used now.
---
Removed from the servers that are still huge or removed from servers for got down to a manageable level once people transferred off? I’m on Whitemane and last I knew they were still available, but I haven’t seen a queue in a week or two and that’s where the option was showing up, so I’m not positive for us.
---
Soo many different opinions.....:(
---
Ok OP, you contribute first.
---
Yeah I agree with that. People hop on the bandwagon but at some point the PUGs are going to hit a wall where a more dedicated guild will be required to reliably progress. If you build a solid raid core and fill slots with PUGs then eventually you'll start recruiting your regular PUGs and fill your roster.
---
I mean, I grind a lot. It’s definitely possible. I do AH as well. I sell all of my greens that are worth a decent chunk or have low deposits.
---
I just hit 32 and been leveling with a 1H/shield and tanking dungeons. Things are going to be different when I finally get the WW axe (not anytime soon).
---
Actually, I meant that raid specced rogues only need 1% hit from gear. After that, hit is nice but not necessarily better than other stats
---
I had a guy beg me to sell him an item below value as he was so poor. Literally begging.  I caved and sold it to him. Checked AH 2 mins later and wouldn't you know he was sell it for a profit. I messaged him and he had some lame excuse and returned the item. He knew he was a scumbag at least.
---
Vanish removes Hunters mark so if you want to get the opener that helps. Also helps if you just want to run away, pick your fights. 
---
A Hunter will ALWAYS win a 1v1 if he has distance on you, so if you realize you can’t catch up to him, there’s no point in staying in the fight. As a rogue, you have the most powerful ability in the game. Stealth. Use it to your advantage
---
Druids are worse at 60 for tanking as they cant wear a shield. Also druids are hard to be good at in Classic so it would take a good time investment to play well in pvp. I would go Pally
---
It’s funny because most of the time you know when they’re going to vanish if you’re paying attention to what’s happening and you can have the flare reticule hovering over their character to drop it as soon as he vanishes
---
so slow, then ramps up every 10 levels.  currently level 40 ne druid
---
Although there is a vendor npc just slightly to northeast of sfk there iirc
---
Yep and that is fair. In my mind they were always disassociated when we did it. 
---
But to people who are on the outside looking in they would say "That guild is running MC!!"
---
But to the guild as a whole, it isn't really on their radar. It is a player initiated thing outside of true "guild" activities mostly for those that spend more time playing wow and have alts. Depending on the guild it may receive a kind of pseudo guild event status and maybe even find itself on a calendar if the guild has one, but it is just different.
---
33? Stop bragging, lol
---
Because group size, item values etc are chosen for game play reasons. Things like max HP and max buff slots etc are even bits because it's easier to handle for a computer. Could they have gone with 6 bits and get 64 slots? Sure, and they probably should have, but they probably didn't think they'd need even 32 when designing the limit.
---
Another thing not to forget, set your hearth to the inn where your quest turn ins are. If you only play for a little, instead of running back, just hearth so your in the inn then log off. Next time you log in your hearth will be available
---
Why did I laugh so hard at this ?
---
I mean, so did I. I'm saying this from experience, towards the end I figured it's just best not to shit where you eat. I think Hillsbrad was the worst, it was just me and 3-6 other mages griefing pulls for hours. At that point questing or dungeoning is faster, but no one wants to be the mage bullied off of a spot.
---
are you sure it's not someone playing on their phone?
---
Auto shot damage makes up a huge portion of your overall damage, I’d recommend upgrading arrows ASAP. Save your meat/fish drops (the ones that aren’t valuable anyway) to help with pet food costs (Cat diet).
---
Most RP happens in RP guilds and between RP guilds.
---
Whats your rotation on princess since she is immune to nature damage?
---
First of all you need to try
---
lol. This is classic. start tanking with a 2hand and die, then wonder why the healer couldnt keep you alive....its coz you were not using a shield LOLOLOLOLOL
---
Oh my goodness thats sexy.
---
Need those last 4 peices rn.
---
Hey, I am set on playing priest, but still don’t know on which faction. 
---
I currently have a lvl 20 fem dwarf and a 23 UD male but keep switching. Any advice ? I mostly play solo
---
The sub doesn't exist to increase your channel views, man.
---
the textures from older xpacs show their age way more in retail than you're saying. Have you been to Suramar or Boralus? They're maybe the most gorgeous cities in the game's history.  You can have amazing graphics and still keep a specific artistic style. It's a myth that you can't. Look at the cinematics. While not obtainable in-game graphics wise, they're so clearly WoW but still look amazing.
---
Thanks for entertaining the questions, did the top guilds also go there / are the streamer guilds the top guilds these days?
---
you get 305 weapon skill from the tree which makes the 9% needed go to 6% needed then get 5% hit on tree so you need 1 for yellow hit cap on raid bosses
---
More can be better but usually crit is better after that.
---
Your talking about bis gear. So am i.
---
These are fairly simple statistical problems.  Where it gets difficult is if you have specific requirements on order or grouping.  Still not super difficult but a lot of people have trouble wrapping their heads around it.
---
Then resolve that with Blizzard. Your very first post said to leave it to the company and yet you are perfectly fine with scumbags using the public to change bans. See how easily I pointed out a contradiction from you? Yet you still can't point out my supppsed contradiction, but you sure as shit like pretending it's happening.
---
I think the more important question you should be asking is what do you want from your guild?  Do you want to raid? PvP? Just want some friends to hang out with?
---
Where u get this info?
---
Well no it's  not. It's  a modern day high income job if you are good at it.
---
His message ends with him trying to backpedal. Ogar it is.
---
Handy considered BOEs for gloves. How much Do dream weave gloves cost? Right now I think I’m rolling with some level 58 greens with int/stam
---
Then I’d call that and extra victory if the tiger finished him.
---
Longer cast time get a larger bonus modifier from +healing gear. Rank 4 is base 3s cast, rank 5 is base 3.5s cast.
---
Rank 5 with +healing is more efficient in terms of m2h, but takes .5s longer to cast.
---
Incendius has that curse that lowers your fire resistance by 100 (stacking). You won't do enough damage to kill him before he stacks that debuff if you're wearing fire resistance gear as a Warrior.
---
Druids could probably do it easily with decurse though.
---
So at 305 and 310 skill respectively, what is the hit cap for white hits?
---
Someone asked what are some good Offhanders for a combat rogue around level 52 and I said a fast dagger to apply as much poison as possible.
---
I was repeating what so many rogues have told me, but everyone shit all over me.
---
Is there anyone with mathematical evidence that a 2.2 sword in offhand is better than a 1.5 dagger offhand? Even with sword spec?
---
I'd like to see hard numbers if they are available.
---
Hahahahaha found one of Asmons ass warts.  Honestly if you're a representative of the type of person on the server, jealous is probably the last word I would use to describe it.
---
Tbh after runnig MC and playing at 60 in general I am really hoping they release a BC server. The raiding and progression is much better executed there. It’s hard to be motivated to get my enchants and farm the absolute BiS pre-raid when I can go into MC and pull plenty of damage with sub optimal gear and kill the bosses in 1 or 2 attempts in a pug.

Classic is a lot of fun but I am worried about it’s longevity. BC has a better max level experience even if you don’t include the better pvp system. I mean, I am already raid loging on my mage after being 60 for two weeks. I didn’t even rush to 60 in terms of dungeon grinding, I did as much questing a possible.

I'm usually an advocate for any kind of dark mode, but I like to have light mode for when I'm at work. The dark window makes my slacking off a little too obvious.
---
Because it came with an ability.
---
Pets at loyalty level 1 have 0 training points.  LL2 gets 1 point per level, up to 5 points per level at LL6.  If you have an ability which costs 5 TP, then you'd be at -5 TP.
---
It doesnt at all, this is terrible advice.
---
I went in a circle and did all my quests at once. Zone by zone. that zone went by fast.
---
Difference there is that a player grinding mobs accepts the risk whereas a player in org isn't prepared for a same faction to set them up in an area that is supposed to be safe except for raids
---
I’ve found they usually stabilize around 5g per stack. Just hoard them until your servers economy catches up

Not a gun technically but rather a quest item.

No relics yet so its BiS you could say.
---
I probably won’t be using this build 100%. I’ll want to still swap stances for shield bash/interrupts. I also like to do a lot of theory crafting. Let me hit 60 and if I remember I’ll come back to this. 
---
Also what realm are you on?!
---
Sharding and layering solves the same problem, but a bit differently. Both have NOTHING to do with hardware or server cap.
---
I mean it's better than hard casting if nova/cone of cold are on CD.
---
They didn't remove it, just lowered it. And a lot of peoples recollections are from pservers where they were waaaaaay too generous.
---
This is false. The first expansion took the max level of EQ from 50 to 60 and introduced a ton of new gear. Latter expansions took the cap to 65 and further invalidated old content. 
---
Here's an old forum post talking about how the expansions have "introduced new ways to improve your power level at the cost of making old content obsolete" and pining for old content. People have been bitching about having to put away their old loot for decades.

Only on 6, haven’t seen it. Thinking about giving up if I don’t get it after 20 more runs...

Not much, you can wear them at 40 and the pattern is taught by trainers. I think the mats are probably 2-3g tops on most servers.

Yeah it must be me then lol. I was on hiatus from wow of about six months and when I heard about classic, I wanted to play again and that’s probably why it seems harder lol. I just got to get used to it again
---
It started slow for me but the last couple night it's finally taken hold and I've had a few more 3am nights than I'd like.
---
So you have those concerns (mostly unfounded btw) on the one hand. But on the other hand, the one we got, Dire Maul is basically useless outside of like 3 or 4 items and the enchants (Insightful hood for healers, hunter, hpriest, rdruid books, Quel Serrar, and dps rings). Good players have their enchant mats already prepared so as soon as they get a libram drop (or find a cheap one on the AH) they're done with that.
---
If there isn't a good gold farm in Dire Maul, nobody will be there by the time actual Phase 2 comes out. Once people get the items they need, they won't go back, kind of like LBRS.
---
AKA the least-known Alliance flight path/town of all time.
---
Yeah I had 12 saved from the last time I tried. Tried now and I could loot them. Didn't know they fixed it yet! Got me some wirings now! Thanks!
---
Feels about right tbh.
---
I’m at 82 runs for my sgc haven’t dropped yet, my GF priest healing a 4mage exp / arena  group got one on her 2nd run.
---
It's not *leveling*, it's farming. I'm talking end-game farming. I pissed off this Chinese 60 Mage at Hearthglen so bad he was cussing me out in broken english and we had each other on /follow, just standing there, for over an hour.
---
I have two accounts so I just let him steam on my second monitor while I played my alt. If he pulled, I moused back over and fucked with him. Got him killed quite a few times. He called me lots of bad names.
---
I have this guy friended and watch him. He's in the same spot 10 hours a day, just gobbling up all the mobs+ore in the area. It's an out of the way area that not many people visit so he's used to having it all to himself. And he doesn't like sharing the nodes, so I just made it my passion to grief him.
---
Never did the stacking tribute on p servers, it was just a shit ton of world buffs.
---
I am whelmed.
---
I've seen it drop twice in three runs. That's just how it is sometimes.
---
Ah, ok. What lvl you now? And - I'm on Benediction, as Horde.
---
nah mate [gnomes](https://i.imgur.com/ckHMIYB.jpg) are pretty good too you gotta make sure not to overcook them
---
That dagger/sword from SM Library is like one of the best items in the game though. The next item that is equivalent to it is dropped in BRD and even then its not actually an upgrade but a sidegrade.
---
Yes,  I don't know why.   I've had certain weapon/shield combos that wouldn't work correctly no matter what order I put them in the macro,  in the end using equipslot fixed all of the issues.
---
I want to do the same but alliance on an rppvp server
---
You just got binged bitch
---
To my understanding, he ran simulations similar to Simcraft but in a larger scale for a full raid with the best possibly comp, with everyone pulling the literal TOP dps, healing, BiS gear for every class, all possible buffs,enchants, etc. literally the top .00001% of players.  
---
And it was found to be literally impossible.
---
Don’t forget the legion guards in hilsbrad, flight masters respawning in minutes, shape shifted druids being mana burned. I mean it goes on and on how fucked this game is. It’s an absolute mess
---
I played Vanilla and I can tell you this was NEVER in consensus.  There was always a debate of VC vs  DM
---
Thalanaar in Feralas is another commonly missed connector. Probably not so much anymore now that Dire Maul is out.
---
donno, I've healed a handful of runs before and have had it drop three times in that one day.
---
We already killed thrall once in my guild for fun, we have a coordinated serverwide Tauren mill versus horde planned for Friday. Couple hundred sign ups for each side already planned.
---
This should sound obvious, but at some point your gear without a shield should be able to mitigate more damage than entry level gear with a shield. When you're there, you should, obviously, be able to take as much damage as an adequately geared tank in blues, while pumping out more damage/threat dual wielding.
---
But if you try that shit in greens, you're going to get blown up just as fast as any other dps warrior. It seems like every other warrior I encounter has heard that on private servers with naxx gear, you can bis fury, yadda yadda, and decide to try to level as a fury tank. Your mileage may vary.
---
it died because the que times skyrocketed because there were usually only 3-4 twinks on each side
---
Level to 60 first. Trust me
---
Laziness level: advanced
---
You only need 6% hit for yellows you still want hit for your off hand hits. This has always been like that.
---
Also combat daggers is only higher dps depending on race and what weapon you happen to get as a drop. Back in the day I was running daggers and it was amazing until Maladath and the sword from chromaggus.
---
There's literally no way in hell you do more dps with daggers in phase 3, you can test it, you can sim it, you can do whatever you like.
---
In phase 1 and 6 I can see daggers being good though.
---
Sorry but saying typical alliance 1v1 sounds like you’re saying alliance only engages into fair fights which this definitely wasn’t lol.

Yep, and you work with what you got or you wait another 20 minutes to find another one. 
---

---
Except the OP did listen to me. Stop promoting mediocrity as a good way to run a raiding guild. It'll work until you inevitably run into a progression wall and then you'll just end up in the cycle of constantly having to replace and regear the players who jumped ship.
---
just hit 49. So close to the BRD Grind kinda.

39 druid played since release. I'm working full time and taking a full class load at a community college (night classes), married with 4 kids, real life is awesome, but I wish I had a bit more time to play.
---
I feel like leveling arms 2h, so you’re also able to tank is the best idea. 
---
Is that wrong? Just curious. I’m level 8 on my war alt and don’t want to respec if I go wrong.
---
Just got Thermaplugg's Left Arm last night. Still haven't trained 2H axes though lol. I think WW axe is still a huge upgrade from this, but might not be once I end up getting it at high 30s.
---
11 points into Balance for Natural Weapons and Omen of Clarity. 35 in Feral, picking up all the tanking talents plus Feline Swiftness. Then 5 points in Furor. It's a full tanking build.
---
Originally I had planned to go HoTW/NS but the reality is that I'm never, and I do mean never, being asked to heal. Every group is screaming out for tanks, so I figure if all I'm doing is tanking, I may as well spec for full tanking. I'm on a PvP server so that may change come Phase 2, since the full tank build does less well in PvP.
---
We have asked and this behavior even if unacceptable to us it not bannable by Blizzards rules.
---
How can it be a range? XP per level isnt a variable amount.
---
The point is, that as you level mobs and quests give you more experience, so the halfway point of XP required is not the same as the halfway point time wise to 60.
---
It's just unfortunate, but ele shams doing bring anything additional to the raid, like the other hybrids.
---
Yes, both spelling out Deadmines, or using the abbreviation VC, are equally correct.

---
Dude, I asked one single question in the original post. What dont you get? 
---
The reason why it became as big of a deal as it did is because I was replying to the comments and because I typed a bunch of extra stuff around the original question. 
---
Honestly though, the fact that you would all tell me to create a backstory even though I had already said in the original post and within the comment section that I have had people tell me that before ect ect....is fucking rediculous. The fact that y'all kept bringing that up makes you all sound like a bunch of trolls and you know it.
---
20 people vs 1, idgaf, ive placed in top 2 percent on state wide tests and really good on military issued tests. Fyi: 2% is 1 vs 50, not 20.
---
Your anecdotal evidence  =/= to the actual truth. I'm 99.9% sure we will get a blue post once layering is gone.
---
But Reddit told me AQ40 would be ez. 25 people with gear from the last raid tier would be able to do it.
---
I was also told it was impossible to 3m DME with no tank or heals. You got this friend.
---
Thanks or the input dude :)
---
thats right!
---
You are one of the few that seem to understand this.  
---
Back when the game was released I said this a million times and 99% of the time they told me I didn't know what I was talking about.  I would get EXTREMELY frustrated that people couldn't comprehend the concept.
---
It's an example of Reddit Lemmings.  Since they were all wrong they would read post after post of wrong information which in their minds meant that I was wrong regardlessly.  
---
But yeah.  People are so mind numbingly stupid.
---
Yeah holy shit I didn't realize how good herbalism is. My lvl 15 alt has almost 4g just from selling swiftthistle/briarthorn.
---
I was on the same boat. I level as ret till 50 and i did dungeons as healer with a intelect set with ret talents. When i became 50 i changed spec to Holy and did some quest with help and a looot of dungeons.
---
This begs the real question, "if you do the work and grind of the dungeon, why do you still have to buy your items?" Nothing is more upsetting as a tank than seeing my items get rolled out because #money. I benefit from those items and make everyones job easier if i get my threat going. This mentality totally defeats the whole need greed system in place. Literally has gold next to the greed button also. Every class should be able to need on their items before anyone who is taking that shit to the ah or another guildie or an alt
---
The average mob takes me down to half health while fighting it. Now you're telling me that it's fair when you have to fight TWO plus a mage wailing on you?
---
That's not true. Dual wield miss penalty applies to both weapons.
---
i’m a 300 tailor/enchanter. imo tailoring is actually worthless once you make your bis robe. alchemy is better for the flasks and elixirs and you can farm the mats for tailoring without needing to be a tailor. the mooncloth is kind of a pain but you get more out of alchemy in the long haul
---
They don't
---
Nah im going dwarf
---
They didn't
---
For sure. And honestly it's probably not all that much slower in the grand scheme of things. Just saying, there's a good reason combat is the most popular leveling spec.
---
It is but the boss in SM is not.
---
It really wont matter as with warriors, regardless of spec, will struggle through the first 60 levels.
---
What server/faction? I can send you some if you're on Herod/Horde
---
Your pet will do random crazy shit, so you need to be on top of it and control it or you'll get the boot.
---
I see 1 horde and 1 alliance at basically the same health. 
---
Unlike the 70% population horde dominated realms where the horde exclusively fight with a numbers advantage.
---
His point flew right over your head bro. If you buy a brand new car and drive it right off the lot it's worth whatever someone will pay for it... not a difficult concept to understand.
---
Didn't want to make any asumptions. Just sharing experience in general.
---
What are the odds? 5 of our 8 mages look identical
---
Passing a weapon to a dps doesn't help the raid as much as taking the weapon yourself.
---
Lvl 60 priest here. Dont ever level to max, nothing to do here. Sitting in uc 2 hours a day aint fun.
---
So long story short, twinks are lazy bitches who just want to pwn white geared noobs without putting any effort. Thanks for your input.
---
That is the truth and exactly what people say. In that context its easy to understand their motivations and there are MMOs that do things to support these players.
---
I'm not sure why you're being spam downvoted. This is the correct explanation on why you don't want to down rank heals while leveling. Until like 50+ you don't have much +healing or mana/5 so you want to cast as infrequently as possible to trigger mana regen via spirit. Using the max rank heal is the best way to do this. It's not like you start casting the max rank heal when the tank is at 30%. You obviously get a feel for how much damage the tank is taking and time it so the heal goes off around 30%. The people downvoting you just lack experience imo. If they think getting a heal off at 30% is difficult, they would have been awful in games like Everquest with CH rotations.
---
Get at my level brah. Literally.
---
Practice bunny hopping outside of lava, only let your feet touch the ground for the next hop.
---
Even with that mentality it makes no sense. Disincentivizing your raiders from grinding outside of raid isn’t helping the raid lol
---
Polymorph for a lot of it I'm sure.
---
would that change your decision? cause yea i have this talent
---
Still using that staff. Well into raiding :|
---
All pve is just knowing your role and the fights.  If you're comfortable with the control of your character then you just need to know your role within each fight and that's somewhat up to your guild.  They should be telling you what to tank and where to tank it and any special instructions they want you to follow.  You can familiarize yourself with fights by looking them up or watching videos if you want to go deeper.
---
lol yeah i was just being silly.
---
Um, yeah i heard they had a MAC client but not sure of the stuttering issues.
---
Are all your drivers up to date? OS on the latest version?
---
Isn’t it 75% damage reduction or sth from armor
---
If you just do dungeons like I do, then going tank I'd say is hands down the better choice. Healers are much easier to come by than tanks, and groups in my experience absolutely *love* Druid tanks. I get compliments all the time about how well I can hold aggro and how little damage I take. So I spec currently 11/35/5 for the full tank build. That may change to 0/30/21 come Phase 2, depending on how much I want to PvP (given that the PvP gear is really nice for Ferals, probably a lot!)
---
If you want to raid, then consult your guild. I don't have any experience there.
---
Carry on. I get it’s not for everyone but endgame raiding is good fun and gearing up your character is very rewarding.
---
i've never seen people irritate the tank for no good reason, only the opposite the primadonna tank abusing his position to make the group GO GO GO
---
my other group was able to heal me just fine, you must just suck
---
no i literally have best in slot for the level we're at (barring AH purchasing). you're the one trying to retailpull wearing a 2 hander when i'm at 30% mana
---
so yeah, until i see someone badgering a FUNCTIONAL tank i'll have to just keep my opinion and you keep yours
---
TBC was great for me 1st time round because it really enabled Ret paladins!
---
The downside to TBC was how quickly your hard earned epics got replaced by greens and blues.
---
I think Blizzard's design philosophy was wrong, which was to rely on pre-existing game mechanics, i.e. the leveling system. 
---
The leveling system works very well for progression because at a low level you are confined to the area you can fight in. 
---
To get out, you require XP to level up and grow your stats, which means you can then push your boundaries further. 
---
At level 10, you are rewarded with choosing your path and designing your character via talents. Works well; you choose who you wanna be, NPCs start treating you more and more like a hero and eventually you reach level 60 and you've made it...you've fucking made it! You take your place amongst the hall of heroes.
---
So what next?
---
Raids! Conquer the world's mightiest villains, gain epics and hunt legendary items. Live in the world,   pursue legendary items and keep striving for improvement!
---
TBC brought more levels, increased ego boosting from NPCS and inflated the economy. 
---
Outland could've been a 40-60 area and had similar, if not slightly improved, raid progression to Vanilla. Perhaps a singular talent point could be awarded for clearing a raid, thus continuing the improvement narrative.
---
The economy could have been tempered via the control of resources and through tailoring  appropriate rarity levels for recipes. 
---
I enjoyed TBC, but I always felt we lost something that we never recovered, it's only since playing recently that I've become to realize why.
---
We progressed passed the ultimate achievement leaving the constant issue of creating more and more outlandish heroic level, both in lore and the mechanism, to beat.
---
Had the rewards been increased, in gear and talents, slowly it would have been a damn sight easier for content and balancing design without loosing the effort and feeling of achievement at reaching 60.
---
 The pace changed too rapidly from the original design and it has suffered ever since. 
---
I am unsure if I want to go through that again, I'm enjoying classic too much to lose it again.
---
Good to be home though!
---
For the horde!! (And the Alliance...)
---
Ok. How to find such a guild? Just try one of the ones that are advertising?
---
Is there a way to see all guilds on my server? If so, does it show membership?
---
It’s very average but it’s not going to make the game impossible or anything
---
2H fury is not optimal. Yes, BRE is pretty damn good, but with HS queuing dual wield should still pull ahead with current weapons (though I don't know if warriors actually simmed a perfect scenario to figure out the exact numbers). Meanwhile rets don't get a choice.
---
Besides, if you're in a guild that tries to optimize everything to 0.01%, you probably don't have a ret anyway. But if you had to work with a given composition and were trying to maximize raid DPS, it would probably have to go to a ret.
---
That guy is a GM of his guild, btw.
---
Ashbringer has like 50/50 as of the most recent data
---
I have nipples, Greg. Can you milk me?
---
You cannot tell someone what the halfway point to 60 is time-wise.  There are too many variables.  
---
Their questing route, how efficient they are at killing mobs, how often they go back for skills, how long they take on professions, etc.  There are literal days of game time between a slow leveler and someone speed running to 60.  Its a worthless question. 
---
The only meaningful way to discuss progress is by XP, which is what I did.  Feel free to make your own assumptions on how that affects your own individual leveling pace, but it would be impossible for me to do that on your behalf.
---
Combat swords gets boring, I went sub daggers and am having a blast (just hit 58) maybe that would reignite the excitement for you.
---
I played a rogue back in Vanilla. Go dagger spec, I found it to be more involving than spamming sinister. If that doesn't work for ya, try a few different classes? I'm playing a druid this time around and loving it (56).

I'm obviously talking about this phase of the game. Why would I be talking about a phase of the game that's not even released yet? Sounds like you just wanted to throw in some useless info no one asked for.
---
who pissed in your cereal mate?
---
Play around with some alts and see how you feel. Personally, I’ve only found rogue fun in PvP. It’s quite boring in pve... that said, I find all dps boring in pve.
---
Logs or it didnt happen
---
guaranteed orb drop, you say?
---
&gt; Everyone who tells you otherwise is either trying to sell u the set or is from a 1% guild that no lifes the game , meaning they min max everything and look down upon people who dont
---
This is such a garbage mentality to have, and even worse to spread. It's so bad that part of me feels like you're doing it deliberately to try to convince people to be suboptimal just so you can look down on them.
---
Considering how many people were 60 in half this time, I can't help but feel behind the curve.
---
Dunno man, most find rogue game play quite interesting, but naturally that is compared to other classes in classic.
---
This will never be the rgb pinball machine style of game play that some people prefer, classic is something much simpler and to a certain extent, less stimulation. If this doesn't suit you, then quitting is an option for sure: you should play the game because you have fun, and if you ain't then you have other options
---
I downloaded Guidelime and have been using Bustea's leveling guide. Only 14 so far, but very smooth and precise.

Is there any weapon to get as a feral druid between crescent staff and a mace from like SM, uldaman, or maraudon?
---
It’s actually pre raid bis on Shadowpanther. https://shadowpanther.net/armor-sets.htm
---
I only use daggers to tank. 1.6 speed or less and i use it. Alcors is my bis the way i see it. Excellent rage on top of good dmg and 10fr. Nothing better 1.3 speed is glorious
---
Casuals like you are ruining the game!
---
This post speaks to me.
---
Druids get naturally more base stats in Spirit and Int. It's certainly not because I'm gearing for that; not a single piece of gear I'm wearing has Spirit, and the only piece with Int are the Wildheart Bracers I'm wearing because I haven't found anything better yet. Int also gets buffed by Heart of the Wild by 20%, which applies in all forms.
---
This isn’t World PvP - you’re just a ganker attacking under geared levelers. 
---
You’d probably get smashed in a real PvP situation.
---
What do you mean proof? I have tried to get into a guild years ago that required this to make sure I have enough time. Believe or not
---
Anyone know what my next weapon upgrade is likely to be (Arms Warrior)?
---
Currently using the 2H-Sword from Ulda. I've gone through ZF/Mara without seeing an upgrade, and the loot table from ST doesn't show me anything interesting.
---
How exactly is this shitting up the sub? Your toxic attitude is shitting up this sub if anything.
---
This is pretty helpful for people looking for different farms and methods.
---
&gt; "if you do the work and grind of the dungeon, why do you still have to buy your items?"
---
Because everyone else is doing the work as well? Why should you get to roll need on money, but no one else does?
---
&gt; Literally has gold next to the greed button also. 
---
And yet, you seem to want to roll just for the gold? So how come you can't understand it?
---
Now this is very subjective. I loved leveling up and even doing quests and gearing up in dungeons. Raiding is very boring and time consuming however and its a point for me to just end it. And now, the only thing I would enjoy is PvP, which is non existent at this very moment. But it would be enjoyable in a future if I kept grinding Molten Core for a proper gear. Which is again, quite boring and at this point im just thinking to roll on a private fun server and PvP the shit out of it.
---
Fight Club discord has every bit of information you will ever need to play a dps warrior. Just don’t go in there asking questions and expect not to be lambasted. The information is there and solid. Anyone still arguing for 2h on Single target fights doesn’t want the truth.
---
And Horde do the same, it's as you say - Both sides. The only time one is worse than the other is when they are over populated.
---
Thanks for your encouraging words!
---
Maybe it is pretty pointless to compare Sunken Temple or Gnomeregan to end game dungeons or raids. The leveling dungeons just feel too easy.
---
Im legit related to the Gracies world wide martial arts champions and to people who have worked on rockets that went to the moon and people who have designed the first hydrogen fuel cell farm, work on multi million dollar boats and wait for high value deals to go through court systems

why doesnt the effect work if you dont mind me asking? lots of twink guides at 19 show this item as a BiS :)
---
I have a few pre raid BiS: one trinket, DalRend OH, blackstone ring, devilsaur legs and gloves, princess boots. And I’m a tribal leather worker. I’ve talked to a few guilds but they all have their rogue slots full.
---
While I agree it shouldn't be allowed I don't think the TOS apply to an action outside of the game, like joining a discord channel.
---
Really good? At level 54 sure.
---
That’s something you have to answer yourself mate. If you don’t enjoy PVP as a rogue then you’re probably not going to like it at all. Raiding is mostly a one button rotation for all the damage dealers. Being in a cool guild with fun and friendly people is what keeps me logging in. 
---
Maybe try a different role before you give it up entirely. I enjoy healing because I know if something goes awry and we make it out alive that I played a big role in helping us survive.
---
He gave his approval for activities in his guild to continue, it is run by a member of (I believe) Olympus 2. Unless they were lying on stream of course. 
---
Why would I want to go to that shithole? I meant the server, I love ungoro crater.
---
For real though i worry I’ll hit 60 and just be bored out of my mind.
---
They reach nowhere near 70%, that's Rogues at best. It seems like most high-performing Warriors are reaching upwards of 45% damage from AAs based on a random sample of logs.
---
druids definitely need gear just as much as any other class, they just don't need weapons as much as other classes
---
*grins sinisterly*
---
I'm in the same spot, I love the class but there's just so many of them right now. 
---
Getting into normal groups already isn't easy and raids are so much worse. Even if you get in one there's probably quite a few others so loot competition is real.
---
Does anyone know if mages/ranged will always be more in demand or will this change as phases progress?
---
&gt; There's no rewards for killing us and its this bad.
---
The problem is that you feel there needs to be a reward to PVP.  You shouldn't be on a PVP server with that mentality.
---
Reminds me of this banger from back in the day
---
https://youtu.be/s7x2U-ro8p8
---
Aggressive is great for camping a rare spawn
---
Got a good guild?
---
Did you build a community around you?
---
Did you make some close friends? 
---
Did you support an alt with your main?
---
Did you switch to engineering for pvp?
---
List goes on
---
Playing on Ashbringer since it got released. According to stats its 50/50... Some zones are full of hordes and some full of ally. I have chosen this server randomly, liked the name of server :)
---
thats what the whole convo was based on nitwit
---
Phase 3 won’t get rid of world pvp. Either transfer, reroll, suck it up, or quit. Pretty much your only options. 
---
Rattlegore is pretty even. Wpvp is balanced and I am personally really looking forward to phase 2.
---
Ty ty ty
---
Actual hit cap is unreachable. So any hit over the soft cap actually increases your dps from white hits. Painfully obvious.
---
TIL I’m a bot because I zone out and fish and watch Netflix at the same time
---
Undead manlet, when will they learn?
---
Honestly, it wouldn't even be straight wipes unless the raid is pretty meh geared or if you don't put in any legwork at all. If you look up BiS and get all your necessary buffs/consumables, and research what to do in each fight, you can do absolutely fine so long as the raid leader knows you're new. MC is really not that hard, Ony is only difficult because of the weird threat mechanics tripping people up.
---
Oh man to each their own but I don't think I could handle that. I'm constantly changing the camera
---
Grob is slightly more Alliance but overall was and still is considered one of the most balanced servers.
---
Tried your route today, didn’t have nearly as much luck. I did 3 clears before I had to take off and made about 5-7g per clear. 
---
Still not terrible I guess. So thank you for the advice on the route! :)
---
From the looks of it the easiest way is just to pull the boss into the cave as he goes below 50%, he doesn't pull the mobs after you have pulled him in a bit.
---
disappointed in the people who were responsible for educating you.
---
&gt;  Layers were literally a method of lowering the concentration of players clogging up zones so that you could actually get mob drops, boss spawns ect.
---
Yes, addressing BOTH gameplay and performance issues:
---
&gt;Just raising the realm caps without any additional tech, at some point you run into **not just client-server performance** issues but raw gameplay issues
---
.
---
 &gt;If there are 5 layers then each would only have 1000 players in each but the server still has 5000 players.
---
&gt;If they lower the layers to 2 then
---
The max server population is lowered to 2000, and the additional 3000 go into the queue.
---
That doesn't mean they can't increase the number of players per layer. They can and they have done that. But there is a limit to the number of players per layer, and if you go above that you'll either get a new layer if it's allowed, or get put into queue. This is why if you got onto a super max pop server at 3am launch week, there'd be just one layer, but later in the day there would be two then three etc.

Hello mr zero empathy
---
I play this anytime I quest out there
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAi3VTSdTxU
---
I have two level 60 Alliance toons. One on a private server. One in retail classic. Both of them have never completed a single quest in STV. When I play a Horde toon, I quest in STV but try to avoid questing if there are too many Allies at Nesingwary camp.  So my answer is to avoid STV altogether forever and go to Swamp of Sorrows instead.  To do SoS, you will need to grab the flight point in Nethergard Keep which is a level 50 zone but it's easy to avoid all mobs if you take the shortest route there. There aren't enough quests in SoS so you will have to grind.
---
oh im a mess too dont worry lol. i deal with anxiety and depression and theres def been some major anxiety and cramming on sunday nights lmao
---
Hes talking about the manual crowd pummeler. 
---
The effect on the item makes it massive for feral druids and its generally recommended people farm gnomer for it
---
I main a mage and lord I've seen some bad ones. I saw one that kept spamming arcane explosion over and over to kill a mob that was at least half heath. I see some use frostbolt, fireball and arcane missile in the same fight. I've seen a number of them that will use blizzard on one or 2 mobs, or use cone of cold against a single mob. The list goes on. I think many people went for flavor of the month and chose mage. It's really not hard to play a mage, but the awful ones give the rest of us a bad reputation.
---
Yeah it's dropped I haven't seen it yet though
---
&gt; Infact the only thing I've read that I can nod along with is the lack of tanks and why it's a thing.
---
It really is strange. Back in the day every single warrior had a shield handy and it was healers that were a pain to find. I mained as a priest and for a good portion of it I was just constantly getting tells asking if I wanted to heal. Had fun healing UBRS raids as a 53.
---
Currently leveling up a tank (oh, and a priest again), and having a bit of an issue trying to figure out where I'm supposed to go after being so used to just looking at health bars and following other people.
---
For sure. To each their own. I just usually play at maxed distance.
---
No I'm not a hunter, I have a warrior.  My bad I made a bad assumption.  In that case I'm not real sure why Dal'rends over Peacemaker.  Edit: oh like you said its the 1h agility enchant thats not available yet!  Good catch.
---
You like my title?  "Reddit Lemmings"?  Your welcome.
---
I'm horde on stalagg and hope it gets better as well. From our side of things it'll be a shame if this trend continues and there's not enough alliance to quench our thirst.
---
+5 weapon skill is great and then it drops off hard after that. Miss chance uses a different formula if your weapon skill is more than 10 below the target's defense skill which adds an extra 3% chance to miss. Bosses have 315 defense which is why getting +5 weapon skill gives such a huge benefit, it switches you to the better miss chance formula. Weapon skill beyond that has very little benefit though. The first 5 gives 3% hit chance, then you need to get to 315 to get another 1% hit chance.
---
Got the same bug.
---
LOL seek help my friend
---
Wow grats
---
Its the max dmg that counts, so if it is faster but still has higher max hit, then ofc its better :)
---
This is what I did on my hunter alt. Feels perfect.
---
Proof that Classic doesn't mean Classy.
---
What the fuck is "fun?"
---
2hand is generally better by a fair amount, but actually if you use the new heroic strike trick that removes misses (or well a lot of them), on your offhand while heroic strike is queued, it might not be that bad actually.
---
Now you can finally play the game.
---
You are reallllly taking your time! Dang
---
At the time of the census, Blaumeux on NA was 50/50 on the dot.
---
"playing" is such a strong word. More like logging on for 2 minutes to maybe kill a boar or something before logging back out for the day.
---
Yes, it is the perfect one for describing you people who deny the truth  just because it goes against your narrative.
---
I’m pretty sure casters get more in demand as raids progress. Rogues get replaced by warriors since they share a token in Naxx but I’m not exactly sure. I’m thinking I might just level a caster on the side while looking for a guild on my rogue and farming gold with brd runs.
---
Not everyone has the memory of a gold fish
---
MMOs by design are carrot and stick. That's what people look for the most. Right now it is just easy pickings and trolling as the reason to gank. One thing its 1v1, but if its a 3v1 or higher then it isn't for sport or fun. Just to be a troll. 
---
And I highly doubt reward focus players are in short supply. Hardly any alliance seem to want to PvP. My calls for help or assist are met with silence. They have been since level 20.
---
Yeah damn the more you think about it the more you can do.
---
Got all the weird engineering trinkets and items?
---
Grind rep with all the factions, specifically revered with hydraxian waterlords and exalted with argent dawn?
---
Get exalted with all the racial factions?
---
Got all the dungeon/raid keys?
---
Make twinks for the different brackets?
---
I could keep going
---
I had a week of vacation in that time that made a big difference.
---
Other than that it's just a matter of seeing how many life responsibilities I can delay to keep up with guildies.
---
Had to respec to resto for guildraids, so now i sit in the maincity all evening looking at LFG where only tanks are needed (and if a healer is needed, 10 ppl reply). Got 95% of my BiS, mount and do my weekly raids. The raids eat more money on consumeables than i can keep up with.. so i just log out after looking at LFG chat for 1 hour out of boredom. I too wish we had some battlegrounds already brother.... good way to kill time.
---
I believe /yell goes to everyone in the zone. It's like /general... but red.
---
Vanish as a rogue should work, same as feign death on a hunter
---
So with the earliest raid gear, some easy to acquire consumables, a priest, and without intentionally aiming for increased armour, you're already getting close to the armour cap....
---
Yet you're screaming that it's hard.
---
I think you're a smart person.
---
Clearly his point is: We are getting farmed this much with no pvp rewards... IMAGINE HOW IT WILL BE AFTER THEY ADD HONOR TO THE GAME. You will be farmed even when hiding in Ironforge.
---
What a pointless comment
---
Thrash Blade MH &amp; Vanq OH until Mirahs OH. 
---
Then shoot for DAL Rend MH and set. Mirah OH is better then Dal Rend OH until you have the set.
---
Lol bro I think you might actually be more mad and more toxic than the people in the group. Brilliant way to make totally baseless assumptions.
---
Please cram your fingers further into your ears and scream REEE louder. You're absolutely wasting yours and my time.
---
Already on that quest?! You shouldn’t rush the content so much. You will run out of things to do in no time. I will spend the next few weeks levelling my fishing up to 3.
---
As other said, wait for ten and then twenty. It's a different game.
---
As alliance, try to get the 2H Mace from Deadmines (Smight Might Hammer). I got mine at 18 and still have it at 30. The stats for cat form are amazing
---
The Grob Mob.
---
The stranglethorn vale is BURNING!
---
The Northrend Glacier is MELTING!
---
The murlocs are going extinct! ...on second thought...
---
Stormwind should stop having plastic for their potions but leaving Orgrimmar to dump all their trash into the sea is fine???
---
Can I suck your massive dong?
---
You are right tho.
---
Not alot of content in this game atm once you hit 60.
---
You can level an alt to 60 but i think when BG's come in with Phase 3, that's when the game will really pick up.
---
I honestly thing they should release a BG (Maybe Warsong Gulth) with phase 2 as that's when the honour system comes in.
---
Once bg's come in, the game changes completely and will have alot to do.
---
Which is exactly what I needed! A healing for dummies. Appreciate that.
---
It's a 3 use item that lasts 30 seconds per use. The vast majority of druids are never going to farm a bag full of manual crowd pummeler's to raid as feral dps which is a bottom tier spec.
---
What’s the point of rolling on a pvp server if it’s 90 to 10 and their are no alliance for you to kill
---
Inb4 banhammer
---
yeah but i hear a really popular band lives there.
---
The cave doesn't open up until like 30-40% though.
---
How? My understanding was that layering allowed more people to play on the realm at the same time. Let’s say 3 layers of 5k people, now if you go down to two layers of 5k people that’s less openings for players.
---
Rattlegore is pretty even. Maybe 45/55 alliance to horde. I don’t ever have a problem tho.
---
I just won qs. Replaced my lvl 40 ghazrilla fang for 1g 46s. Yea i made gold. 
---
You won qs. You sell on ah for 1000gold.
---
Hmmm... I guess technically youre right im making gold but jesus its lackluster when i need the item and you dont
---
Thats rough.
---
Im also an Ele Sham. Ive made a few thousand gold already inbetween herbing, grinding mobs, alch flips, and general ah flips.
---
Would be worth considering dropping skinning for herbs. Easy 50g-100g an hr when theres little competition.
---
Alternatively, I like farming the Frostmaul giants in Winterspring. The E'kos sell for 2-4g each on my server. They drop ~15 silver each and world drops. I can make 40-60g an hour if its just me over there. Especially now with the 55 mage water.
---
Is gutgore ripper playable in raids?
---
So basically what I said, most thing you do is dungeon which I hated, and you are getting gear? For what? My gear is good enough and there is nothing to get gear for because its not gonna help me level faster or anything. Professions I maxed out before 60, rep grind is pointless, getting gold is pointless, helping people is pointless, pvp is pointless until phase 2. Its pointless because your only goal in the game has been taken away.
---
Besides the fact the bracers in DM West are technically BiS.
---
The amount of item restores you are eligible for is a good example of this. You would typically hear people say it was 1 or 2, I once got all 5 T9 pieces refunded because my guild messed me about with roles and I was nice to the GM I spoke to.
---
Faerlina is actually pretty balanced, but oveepopulated.
---
&gt;MMOs by design are carrot and stick. That's what people look for the most.
---
Sandbox MMOs beg to differ. And despite being a themepark mmo, heck it basically started the genre, vanilla wow was quite sandboxy.
---
Which is why I got corpse camped by a ret paladin for 20 minutes earlier today. Because he wanted to, and found it fun. Fair enough.
---
I'll be your friend, Rudy
---
Had the same bug. It was resolved, but then a Druid won it.
---
I didn't have any luck on AH until I started getting heavy and think leather. Probably my own fault for not using an AH plugin.
---
The one trick I do remember from vanilla is to stock up my stores and not post the auctions until the weekend because that's when the most people will be on to compete with eachother.
---
I couldn't bring myself to kill a female gnome mage on my server called Cuddleme. I cuddled her instead.
---
Most of APES are people we played with on p servers.
---
Was recently banned for bad decisions for a month.  At that time I had a higher level warrior. Been experimenting with other classes and haven't been able to bring one past 12. Not sure why. 
---
Recently got the wife involved and she's very green so I'm trying to decide which class is best to assist in her learning and my enjoyment. I keep coming back to mage but I'm really just not sure.
---
Your fault for bringing a Druid.
---
Ohhh I see
---
*Just two men, sharing the night*
---
*It may seem wrong, but it's just right*
---
No I quest
---
Only when they feel the need to be total jerks and add nothing constructive to the conversation in an attempt to bait people. And then there are people like you who get turned on by jumping on that bandwagon. I am here to discuss a game issue not debate your troll nature.
---
Black mageweave probably
---
Calico will do it too
---
&gt; Our PvE arms warriors were devastated
---
Idk i think a better answer would be going into battle stance and using mocking blow.
---
Any guidance on consistently farming the two bosses? I’m pre bis, but have a75% chance of succes with Pyro and I can’t seem to figure out the vendor at the guzzler 😓
---
Thanks man! :)
---
Yeah, the extra 6 is essentially useless since it gives less than 1% of hit. It's not a huge deal but if you want to put 2 talent points somewhere else for now then you can.
---
That doesnt confirm what you said in the slightest
---
I'd watch this match between you two. The build up was just to great to end it here
---
There’s a hybrid build that lets you heal and oT raids probably works fine for 5 mans.
---
the issue you come up against is progress. warriors has the option to be much more consistent and defensiv. sure they suffer in threat by doing this but a kill is a kill. druids do not have the option when healers are super undergeared.
---
once geared even in naxx you can rock that druid for most fights.
---
Pug raids are easier in some servers than others. I usually see a few advertising in LFG and Trade every now and then. Most are guild groups looking to pug some spots. 
---
The easiest way to raid is to join a guild that raids. PUG raids were never a mainstream thing in vanilla. Some tried, but it was not mainstream. In classic, pug raids are around. But most are basically guild runs with some pugs and not fully pug runs.
---
How does one remove poisons from a weapon? Like a group change adding a shaman with WF totems and I still got 8 minutes left.
---
Lol no. A lot of pre raid bis guides are wrong. I’m not saying don’t do research, but following an internet guide exactly isn’t necessary
---
Lol wow.
---
What server are you one? If it's dominated by Horde - there's nothing you could do.
---
You could go to Wetlands, but nothing beat STV in terms of speed.  
---
Follow this [guide](http://www.wow-pro.com/leveling_guides/jame039s_alliance_leveling_guide_chapter_i_3041_old_version)
---
True that.
---
This is technically a change it seems, but honestly, it would of sucked to have tanks with hundreds of thousands of HP
---
Source?
---
Then list one.
---
Are the quests grey, and the mobs grey?
---
I don't know what you're talking about. A good Warrior trashes a good Rogue once trinkets are in play.
---
Aside from the implied snubbery in that bis-comment ( and aside from being hurtfully reminded that no such thing occured for me......). I don't see how this matters in regards to leaving a reply
---
I have been following this Russian streamer for a while now and learned a lot from watching him play. This is just an example of a mages ability to control the field.
---
Why are you using Bing?
---
They still release some of the most polished games on the market, but again, trying to draw a comparison between a game released in 1994, by a significantly smaller dev team, with far less complicated mechanics, to a game released nearly 10 years later, in a different genre, and then remade 25 years after Warcraft was released, is ridiculous. Warcraft was absolutely not without issues, and thinking otherwise is just looking at the past with rose colored glasses.
---
I've been playing since the 2nd or 3rd day after launch, and I keep rerolling... And also cannot bring myself to return to characters I left. So yeah, I'm level 5 right now. :)
---
I have alts for each class.  And I'm working on leveling all of them.
---
None are over 30.
---
Endgame is just a myth for me. Like, it might as well not even exist.
---
I probably should just pick two or three and go with it.
---
240 hours for 1500 g? unbelievably slow
---
thx
---
[Jesus Christ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYG89rB6c5k)
---
me too plz
---
SM Farm groups? I don't know Alli leveling zones &amp; ranges. Arathi? 1K Needles can be as bad as well for ganking, though not at STV level.
---
Evening time, after dinner for a few hours.  LFG slows down as it gets later and people start crashing for the night.
---
Thanks for the life lesson but my stance on the fact this addon is unfair still stands and I still will continue to argue how overpowered it is. Thread is dead though so lets agree to disagree.
---
Oh wow!
---
The Captain Grayson quests?  Because those appear as alliance when I look on wowhead, but wowhead could be wrong.
---
Bad advice.  
---
I leveled two characters on PvP servers in STV. Yes, it's hard, but still doable.  
---
Now, if Horde is dominating with like 70-30 - then yes, it's bad idea to go into STV. But in general it's bad idea to be on such server at all)
---
I don't ever deny the truth.  I am open ears.  If someone educates me then that's a benefit for the both of us.
---
Lemmings is a term I use slightly different in practice though lol.
---
It is a term for mindless followers believing what the others have told them.   I am quite the opposite.  I choose to learn which contradicts how you said it applied to me.
---
Can we be done trying to get a one up on anything the other says now.  It's really pointless banter.
---
Me: "each layer has a limit of the number of players per layer"
---
Link: "This allowed us to accommodate more players per layer"
---
You: "They said nothing about players per layer!!!!"
---
for a warrior 4 str is 8 ap so it's twice as much! Almost 1 whole dps wowie
---
there are only two species.
---
Humans and filthy non-humans!
---
Geez, I don't even see how you're level 39. That's a full plate, my man!
---
I only roll if the ilevel is higher /s
---
Try leveling up a Paladin and when you go sprinting back to your rogue it'll feel fun and interesting
---
With a guild stacked with Fury Warriors and mages with full world buffs and consumes it's probably just doable
---
Ctrl mouse wheel for camera control. You wont even tell the difference
---
Blink, or use Ice Armor's Slow and Ice Barrier to kite until you _do_ have something off CD. Cold Snap if it's _really_ that desperate. Arcane Explosion spam is still a terrible idea, there's surely something better you can use the GCD on, or save your mana for. Heck, even use Fire Blast if you need.
---
It’s actually middle of the pack in MC. Slightly below Mages and warlocks. 
---
It’s weird when people say shit like this. Warriors and rogues are the real outliers in dps at this tier, because they’re so much higher than everyone else. The gap between rogues and Warriors, the top two, is larger than between the worst dps and the 4th best. 
---
Other classes are mostly at parity. Minus shamans and Paladins.
---
Yesterday I saw a druid multiboxing 5 characters and I thought whan an absolute waste of money multiboxing a class like that.
---
Then I see this and well the druid is doing alright compared to this mofo. I don't even see what you can do with a multibox paladin except the same as going solo- pray to RNGesus for as many SoC procs as possible.
---
Who cares when you attuned? You didn't even watch the video. Get over yourself chump.
---
His DPS is fine considering the disconnects. Forgetting to loot the quest item off the boss makes you think he’s a bad player?
---
There's no way to remove poison from your weapon. You just have to wait it out, unfortunately.
---
Those are literally your only options and the only people worth having a discussion about this aren’t going to look at private servers, this thread, or any other random crap. They’re gonna look at the losses it would cause on their profits. 
---
You do have the time or you wouldn’t play at all, you just don’t want to, and that’s fine. Still got 3 other options.
---
Some of us have been playing this game for far to long to believe any of these "false positives for RMT"...
---
I understand that the assets derived from this are pretty good; the difference between second best in slot and best in slot can typically be countered by changes in gameplay.
---
Best In Slot lists and people adhering to them like they're gospel are where the problem STARTS.  Counter this, and those people become irrelevant.
---
Sure, some of the gear is irreplaceable.  I get it.  But; remember that the concept of necessity for those assets deal with a player playing at their optimum.  You don't have to be there.  You can probably take a 10% max all out DPS cut and still pull through MC and BWL, ZG, and most of AQ-20 at least.
---
It's shitty behaviour, to be sure.  But unless Blizzard takes action against it, there's not much we can do about it except make the folks doing it irrelevant.
---
What you could do is over-asshole them.  Get a group of 5-10 people to repeatedly kill Ravasaurs and don't loot them.
---
Bro truth be told every class is a couple button masher in PvE. Standard solid pve rotation is only a few skills. That being said, rogue can be super fun in pvp - you got a lot of tricks up your sleeve and can win many/most fights if you play it right
---
Ayy gj on reaching 60!
---
Can confirm as Horde on Blaumeux, it feels very balanced.  Sometimes a zone feels like all Alliance, other times Horde-dominated.  It's great.
---
Kinda what you get for using MS search
---
Fucking up Asmon and his "crew" is the same thing as beating up the retarded child in class B-3 and going around school beeing proud... in the end you're just a bully praying on the ones with special need
---
ok bud
---
Don't do more than 2, you'll regret it like me. Have a 60 and 3 40s and its hell.
---
Why not?
---
When you post a text or link with a poll included it gets auto removed and points to this post.  It looks like you help manage this.  I haven't seen surveys for classic in 2 months.  I linked to the survey I was interested in directing the community to.
---
Carrion bird isn’t that great...
---
Yeah it gets 5% extra armor.
---
# Owl gets 7% extra damage.
---
&gt; Owl:  Health - 1.00 / Armor 1.00 / Damage 1.07
---
&gt; Carrion Bird: Health 1.00 / Armor 1.05 / Damage 1.00
---
you can also get screech at lv ~20 in Westfall from Greater carrion , just swim from Grom Gol
---
**Bats** have identical stats as Owl, but don’t get claw (focus dump)
---
Owl is considered good because it is a DPS Pet with aoe threat/damage reduction debuff so it tanks like a tanky pet, and dps’s like a dps pet.
---
Nightfin soup sells for like 6g a stack and that's how I paid for my mount.
---
retail is better for you, they even clean 3 action houses of mats to get world firsts, just like you like it!
---
Meanwhile i am reporting those trying to communicate with the opposing faction.
---
That is absolutely not what i said. Only thing i said was that it doesnt affect queue times. You're putting words in my mouth. Anyway im done with you.

Ooh, tough guy are we? Here, I'll scare you.  
---
Free Action Potion. Good luck eating that Rogue now.  
---
   
---
Oh, or Shadow Priest/Warlock. Good luck doing anything against that.
---
&gt;Can we be done trying to get a one up on anything the other says now. It's really pointless banter.
---
Yes, the whole argument was tired weeks ago and was pointless from the beginning. My greatest regret of today was allowing myself to post on this post.
---
Here is one simple trick, invest in bags early, save up and buy at least rune cloth bags 4x, then just spam dungeons and vendor everything. Got 3 toons to 40+ and had for mount and skills.

Guidelime
---
No, it's layering. Sharding and layering are similar but sharding is by zone and layering is the entire world. That's why you can constantly phase in and out when zoning in retail but maintain the same phase when moving between zones in classic.
---
Warrior, rogue, and mage will be at the top of the charts for pretty much everything after MC and Ony.  For TBC every class can do pretty decent dps, even ret paladins if they're Horde.
---
You're going to change your mind about the mindless PVP grind, which honestly requires almost zero participation. A lot of people will be AFK watching Netflix. You can't easily Netflix through a dungeon. Most ride from the base to stables, "guard" the flag in WSG, pick flowers or "guard" the starting cave in AV, and most of all watch Netflix or NFL football.  The best predictor of your rank next week is how much time you AFK in BGs, not the amount you participate. Even if you join a premade to pad honor, you will spend a good deal of time AFK.
---
I agree, I'm not sure why you made it.
---
Wow thank you, pretty cool things you can do
---
I might have missed it, can you point out the place where they say that removing layers will increase queues?
---
Not ganna lie, that was rad as hell.
---
I see a gnome and all I see is red. Gomes..... Just the worst.
---
How pathetic do you have to be to be such a garbage person in a video game...
---
Also, if it continues into the early 50s, you can try to grab a [Lord Alexander's Battle Axe](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13003/lord-alexanders-battle-axe) off the AH. I grabbed it to upgrade my Rockpounder, and it's pretty nice.
---
What addon are you using to manage gear sets?
---
I doubt it. I think elite Alliance guilds will be fine in Phase 2 but they won't be able to camp. They will have to keep moving because wherever they pop up hundreds of Horde will be on the way.
---
You do get more experience from mobs and quests at higher levels, but the amount of experience *needed* to go from level to level is much higher, too. 
---
[Here's](https://i.imgur.com/rKdFS0j.jpg) a grid of xp needed per level, and xp amounts per equal-leveled mob from 1-60. Even at 59, you're only getting about 100xp more per mob than at 40. Which is a lot cumulatively, but relationally, it's only 30% more.
---
That break-even point should just be taking into account experience. So not training your professions, travel time, or anything else. It's just that your experience equalizes at 42; the amount you've already earned is equal to the amount you've yet to earn.
---
Yea, I raid in retail 3 days a week and hard to do that in classic as well.
---
How do you kill a rogue as a mage? I can only stay away for so long especially if they are a gnome and have that sprint talent. Just spam AE and hope to not die?
---
No, but tanks already get stacked with loot by virtue of defaulted tank gear + needs for hit and people that haven't been playing on private servers for the last 10 years are going to get annoyed seeing perds viskag etc go to a tank because they aren't thinking big picture or long term.
---
Yeah, but you - literally - didn't kill the final boss.
---
You  quit at the stage where you start putting together the gear, the team and the practice to kill the final boss, saying "Didn't want that boss kill anyway'.
---
You just come off as a miserable fuck. Seriously homie. Get a grip and take a deep breathe.
---
"Related" (like that means anything, even if true) to rocket scientists but needs to ask for advice on how to join a RP server in a videogame. Fucking lmao
---
People show up on PVP servers to `/wave` at the other faction, ignore them when they're questing and leveling, then they show up here and cry about it when they get killed.
---
My goal on playing on a PVP server was not to level and do quests.  It's to try to kill everyone I see.  If that's not why you are on a PVP server, you shouldn't be on one.
---
"I dont care how old he is!"
---
Can you explain? Newbie here.. Is it the gear?
---
It's actually really quite easy. You may need Cold Snap if you've been caught extremely off guard, but assuming they aren't using a Free Action Potion you just need to get _one_ slow off and then Blink. 
---
Remember, Improved Sprint and Escape Artist only remove the crowd control that's currently active on the Rogue, they don't prevent any more being applied. If they break out of your Frost Nova, Cone of Cold and Blink. 60% Slow thanks to Talents. Then your Frostbolt spam should prevent them being able to stay out of a slow using their other CC-break. At that point, you can just kite them like you would a mob, there's literally nothing they can do. If they catch up too fast somehow, Cold Snap into another Frost Nova. If they break out of _that_ early, then Cone of Cold again. He can only escape your CC so many times.  
---
Unless they're using a Free Action Potion. Then you're fucked, because they're immune to stuns and movement impairs for 30 seconds. In that case, you can try to Ice Barrier &gt; Ice Block &gt; Cold Snap &gt; Ice Block &gt; Frost Nova &gt; Blink, to buy time for the potion to wear off (30 second duration, 2 minute CD). If you're at a long range, you can also try Polymorph, they're not immune to that. In this scenario, you're _heavily_ disadvantaged, so you'll need to play very well to pull through, and it's a rare matchup so you'll have plenty of time to get used to winning against Rogues normally without fighting many Free Action Rogues.
---
I wouldn't have been nice.   
---
If they were telling me I couldn't roll on an item i actually need, I'd tell them to fuck themselves and leave right after getting the item. No use bending over backward to please people you'll only interact with maybe twice ever

Between retaliation rend demo shout and rogues popping evasion just to get overpower spammed, and plate armor...unless the warrior is really bad , the warrior wins

1. BiS lists were less of a thing in 2006, so telling a guy who posted his comment in 13 years ago that "there are BiS slot lists" isn't really helping that guy... in the past. I doubt the guy will come back and see that reply and go "Oh great, it's about time someone did that!"
---
2. The guy he is responding to (again, the guy 13 years in the past), does not appear to give a shit about BiS, so this guy is just flexing his WoW Classic knowledge on a guy who didn't care 13 years ago, probably doesn't care now, and of course most likely won't see that comment.
---
There's a lot of good places to advertise the existence of player guides and equipment rankings, but the reply section of a 13 year old comment is an odd place to go. There's a reason the old WoW forums had a rule for not necroing an old thread. If you want to revisit a topic, just make a fresh thread (a common rule for many forums). Lots of things changed since the original thread, and so it's best not to mix up new information with old information.
---
Worth is subjective.....
---
Sadly I transferred to heartseeker with some friends a few weeks ago. Now alliance is crushing it.
---
Wowhead comments are primarly an information source for people finding them later on. The conversation itself is only secondary. So replying to that old comment was just adding some extra information for people to read.
---
This is why I like the boost tokens, I hate levelling and can afford to skip it. I've always played WOW to progress my character at max level.
---
I felt no sense of acomplishment in hitting 60 in classic I just thought I'm glad that's over and nearly gave up multiple times.
---
Certain choices made available in games allow you to minimise your time doing ingame activities you dislike and maximise your time doing the ones you enjoy. This shouldn't be difficult for people to understand.
---
Different people also obviously find different things fun, I cannot understand the appeal of achievements in any game for example.
---
That 7% damage means a lot less than 5% armor. While leveling as BM, a pet with no damage bonus (ala a carrion bird) does about 40% of your damage. If you have an owl with +7% damage that only rises to doing about 43% of your damage. You'll kill things maybe half a second faster.
---
On the other hand, an extra 5% armor combined with the attack power reduction from Screech means your pet takes basically no damage from mobs and you have zero downtime. Owl is ok but an extra 5% armor is amazing. Literally any tank would be ecstatic about getting another 5% armor.
---
Download "Weakauras" and use this.

Oh of course. There's no other real options, unless you've got a Shield up and they've used their interrupt, then I'd say your normal max ranked Frostbolt is more reliable, AE's ST damage is pretty pathetic.
---
Do you think this is worth it for a priest without herb? I was previously doing Mara getting pretty much 30g an hour

I wanna get a whiff of that!
---
I think what he might mean is that there is no longer any tangible character development outside of min/maxing.
---
No new skills to learn and enjoy, no more questing around the world meeting people, ect.
---
He might need to make an alt and enjoy the growth process of another class or even another faction.
---
But typing out a list that says "grind this and grind that, while you are at it grind those" isn't helpful for someone that is tired of grinding.  He grinded his way to 60 hoping there was more activities less grindy but found more grinding.
---
I'll probably hit 60 and go play Pokemon Sword and Sheild when it's released since for me, totally subjective, the bread and butter in WOW is the leveling process.   But that's just me.
---
I'll be enjoying it alot until something comes along to snag my interest with the prospect of something new and exciting to offer.
---
What did you do with your nobel peace prize money?
---
Not to be a debby downers just not overly impressed? This is fairly standard from any mage who isnt absolute sht at their class....
---
In fact his ability to not get hit while pulling aggro is incredibly sub par to say the least. He would not be able to do this at any content at lvl 60.
---
If this impresses you, should see the crazy things mages are capable in dm and zf.....your mind will shatter.
---
Lol I like this ‘zoomer’ thing.  I hope it catches on in game.
---
Probably any level if you wait for your vanish cd
---
The stuff will still be farmed, just not controlled.
---
I don't give two shits, move along kiddo
---
Like them or not, they are the most successful guild in classic in terms of PvE and probably wpvp. For example, they were world first in downing Rag and did it within a week of Classic's release. Once phase 2 hits they will probably down more world bosses (especially for the alliance faction) than any other guild. They'll also be the first to clear BWL probably.
---
What add on is this
---
Never share account info, ever.
---
That's why so many people prefer TBC.. most people refer to classic as a PvP focused game. TBC is where raiding really stepped up became fun and rewarding for the time put in.
---
its called ItemRack, you can get the classicquickfix on wowinterface or on the curse/twitch app

---
Me am that kind of orc!
---
Its not preferential treatment. Its a system set in place by the developers. Thats why it says warriors pallys only. Same reason im not going to need on those shadowcraft boots if a rogue is with me. This game makes no sense if you play your way. Like half of the mechanics could go away. Almost all dungeons could cease to exist. Parties would be a dime a dozen at that point as everyone would just be soloing shit. The game itself would be nothing at that point other than a gambling machine. 
---
Honestly i just avoid players like you. No. I banter in world chat about how shitty it is to need on other peoples gear when you just want gold. Its greedy and take alot of the fun away from a great experience.
---
At this point im just arguing against a troll. I lost 3 posts ago but this workday is slow

I tried but like i saod he was so fast that if i dropped off a ledge, hed be in melee range before i could go the other eay and climb up

I think it depends on the region, I'm pretty sure it's an option in Asia.
---
Layering was introduced to solve both the social and technical problem of having too many players within the same zone. They've stated this before. The servers are capable of handling more total capacity than we have on classic servers from a technical perspective, but that's based on a spread out population. They have problems when most of the population is concentrated in a few zones.
---
That concentration is exactly what you get in launch scenarios, as everyone is always in the same levelling zones. This causes both performance issues on the server in addition to just a really rough experience for people competing for tags, etc. To reduce both of these things but without introducing sharding, they decided to layer instead. What this did was create a copy of the entire world so you wouldn't experience something like chasing an opposing faction into Ashenvale and having them disappear randomly into another shard.
---
At launch I'm fairly certain they set the server cap to the intended server cap for phase 2. Ergo, there would be queues if we went above it. We blew past it because to be honest, they really fucked up the original server release and a lot of people stuck it out on the most populated realm for fear of being on a dead realm. Now, the fact that they could use layers gave them the comfort to up the server cap without directly impacting the experience of everyone logged in, because they can just spin up new layers. This helps satisfy the launch peak demand and the tourists without driving people away from massive queues. The idea is after the first week and with server transfers, people will stop playing nearly 24/7 and you'd only have smaller queues during peak hours. Which is exactly what we've been seeing.
---
It's also my belief that as the population waves span out and you don't have tons of people in zones (as the wave hits 60 basically), they were able to start reducing layers. As they were reducing layers they also wanted to reduce the server caps down to the initial target for phase 2, since that's probably what they deem the best for gameplay reasons.
---
So yes, indirectly, layering is related to the server cap. But there's no hard rule that if they delete a layer, that cap is removed from the server cap. In reality, we don't know what their criteria is. But they could easily have removed layers while leaving the inflated cap, or reduced the cap while leaving the layers in place. They're not directly related.

He's playing the long game and doing this in anticipation of the wrath pre patch.

Is the staff from ZF not better? Also the staff from DM tribute?

&gt; Looking for any reliable and quick way to avoid using boats to get from one continent to the other.
---
Become a mage.
---
I agree to a certain extent.   
---
Everyone should play how they want to, but at the same time you have to realize that really smart people have ran over this entire game with a fine-toothed comb over the past 15 years and know all the ins and outs of leveling and how classes play, sometimes things are just better than others and you have to do that thing if you want to be the best you can be.   
---
Again, everyone should play how they want, but you have to realize and acknowledge that maybe some people know the game better than you do and are objectively a better player for it
---
Put your hand down my BiS, and I'll bet you'll feel BiS.

RNGesus is a capricious and terrible God.
---
Thanks!

I'm debating going mage. Could sheep things to keep cc. Useful in groups and can deal damage when needed. Good in raids later and good in PvP. Can portal us around to reduce downtime as well.

Sad that this is the real benefit, lol

He’s going to have a lot of fun looking for honor kills when they roll that out and all the alliance have left due to douche nozzles like him.
---
I wanted to make a standard guide any class can do, I know you can do lots of tricks with mage to get it easier :p
---
I went Ele around that level and never looked back. I even heal raids as Ele and the restos *love* me when i outperform them. 
---
Imagine this. Going Ele at that level increased my average dps by roughly 100%, and reduced my incoming damage by even more with the shield and the perks of being ranged.
---
I was able to kill 2 mobs in the time it took my melee spec to kill 1. Even with lucky wf procs, ele was consistently higher average damage. Drinking happens only after 4-5 mobs. Super smooth leveling experience as Ele.
---
The didn't do that though-they told the author to make changes and after it was approved.
---
Teach a man to fish, and he gains no life over several hours!
---
No that's not in line with my logic at all. Nice try?
---
You can also look at the combat log when fighting a mob to see what type of dmg is being done to you.
---
You have to bear in mind that the cthun fight was hard capped on how many people could be meleeing the boss in phase 1 (8 iirc), and the other dpsers also had to be dealing with the eyestalks.
---
Rank 1 fireball(prio) and rank 1 frostbolt are your best friends. Rogues/warriors are easy 1v1, especially if you have some stamina on your gear.
---
Looks like your digging for something that doesnt exist. Also, there is no way in hell your going to get Ateish or be able to rely on someone else using it for you.
---
Confirmed blue post "feature"
---
And it actually lasts quite late into leveling too. You can get it earlier than the ZF Staff, and it's useful to the same levels, even further thanks to the Orb's Mana on-use. You either replace the off-hand for Spirit of Aquementas, and/or your mainhand for Inventor's Focal Sword if you want a replacement before pre-raid BiS
---
Oh, okay thanks!
---
You sound like a very smart person.

That's just anti-goblin propaganda spread by those dirty gnomes.
---
So I first made a warlock that is level 18. I wanted to play a support class though at 60, so I switched to druid that is level 28. I'm really enjoying druid so far, but before I get in too deep I'm mainly curious about how they play at 60.
---
My plan at 60 is to go HotW/NS spec so that I can both tank and heal dungeons, and OT and heal raids. Is it hard for druids to find raid spots? I don't really care about topping HPS meters, but I do want to be needed at end game and be able to tank/heal effectively. Also, do druids still hold up well in the later phase raids? I'm assuming they mainly stick to healing for Phase 2-4 raiding. 
---
Once I hit 60 I definitely want to join a progression PvE raid guild to get through all of the content. Druid seemed like a good idea since I'll be able to choose to either OT or heal, and I probably won't level a second character to 60. In vanilla I only had a level 60 priest that I played, and only healing got a bit boring after a while. I'm hoping the versatility and high skill ceiling will keep me engaged and enjoying the class. 
---
What do you guys think? Does it sound like I'll enjoy the Druid life at 60 for PvE endgame? Thanks for any input!
---
Oh and one more thing, can druids farm gold effectively at 60 if I do choose to level an alt to 60? I know mage/hunter are better, but can druids farm pretty well too?
---
Yeah definitely. Having to sit there and listen to the screams from Thaddius all day every day? Hard agree.
---
Did 44 to 51 (20+ hours, 10 to 15 min runs) in ZF, and saw it once at level 50.
---
Same. I leveled to 60 in front of a dwarf priest (I’m Tauren Druid). He saw me ding and we danced off then congrats me and killed me lol!
---
Most people running Frost is due to mobs/bosses in current raid content being immune to fire. You will definitely see a change once PvP comes out and raid content progresses beyond MC/Onyxia.
---
POM/Pyro builds were quite popular in Vanilla.
---
Now maybe reddit will stop getting their panties in a bunch.
---
Oh wait, it's reddit.
---
Immersion
---
Okay, awesome. I am only half a level to 10 at this point lol
---
Phase 2 is where most of the problems occur.
---
This is why I suggest people not to fall into the "jUsT gO cOmBaT sWoRdS" trap. It's really fucking boring. Maybe it's marginally faster, but it doesn't matter if you get burned out of bashing SS at level 37.
---
NEEERF
---
Oh my god.
---
Theres not even a question about this. Why in the world would you consider sharing your Blizzard information at all with some stranger you met over the internet?
---
Not to be rude, but do you understand the concept of account safety and why every online game that requires an account to be created will explicitly warn you to never share account information, *especially* online??
---
I don't even pay attention to the BIS or Pre BIS crap. If something looks to be an upgrade, I am going to roll need unless it is reserved...and a big middle finger to the elitists who complain I shouldn't be rolling need on something that isn't my pre-BIS.
---
Paladin tanking is an absolute blast, I can't recommend it enough (as a prot paladin). Do note that you can't tank raids, but I'd argue they're the best 5man tanks as they have excellent aoe aggro and their utility is top notch.
---
Mana is an issue, but really it's just a mechanic to juggle. Rarely do I run out of Mana while tanking, but if I do, I pop a Mana potion and truck on.
---
The Mana problem is often cited because people think you should always use Seal of Righteousness. That isn't correct, Seal of Wisdom is generally better and I only use SoR when I need an absurd amount of threat quickly (such as boss fights).
---
Yeah, but most of us don't care.  Seems like their fans are pushing them the hardest just like the Asmongold posts...
---
It all seems like low key promo material.  It gets lame.
---
(And some of it *is* promo material to justify their existence)
---
Main tanking raid should be easier than dungeons once you get the boss fight mechanic right, most of the time you just stand there and grab the boss attention while the dps do their job.
---
Off tanking can be a bit more complicated, sometimes you have to gather adds, sometimes you have to taunt off the main tank due to some debuff shit. All depends on the fight mechanics.
---
I started off tanking in wotlk switching between prot and ret pally, gathering adds was easier with a pally frisbee or being able to charge and intercept in def stance for warriors. For classic, it is not that easy, but demo shout will help you get the adds' attention. Everyone has their first time, hopefully you find a guild which is willing to let you try.
---
Just to give you some context.
---
I don't give a shit how much time people put in this game, but I do have a good nose for sniffing out bullshit.
---
In my server its 2 gold a stack, but if you purchased 1000g worth of rune cloth in my server alone, you'd purchase the entire market. Which the amount available alone gives me a rough estimate on how much is really being produced. Making 1000 gold in this game isn't impossible, but it isn't easy either.
---
Well shit, the more you know
---
If you take the recommended BIS, you are not intentionally aiming for highest possible armour. The recommended BIS has less armour than you could have if you were prioritizing armour over all else.
---
God I wish that were me.
---
Right. Queuing it up is building more rage. You *don't* cancel it if the rage built is enough to justify letting it go through. This is why it's showing up more.
---
I'm running out of ways to explain this.
---
Walks in, our local Reddit Historian
---
Read mine.  You may get a laugh.   I'm bad at arguing, I have little to no facts to back up my arguments and usually I end up cornered by blood thirsty Redditors.
---
I had no idea the streamers all picked one server when I picked mine, and I am so happy I didn’t accidentally pick there’s
---
Yeah, I'm talking about the sm library staff though.  Pretty much every dungeon after library has a 2h with better dps and I've lost every roll for them, usually to people who already have solid 2h'rs.(so they're generally sidegrades)
---
And this is on my shammy, so the weapon isn't just a stat stick.
---
I thought Manual Crowd Pummeler was best for bear for both threat gen and damage?
---
It’s the same thing over here on Fairbanks, hey ganked every time I engage a quest mob. I’m disappointed they took away the transfer option. Not fun
---
Look, you'll find a lot of contention on this topic and the choices others have listed are by no means bad but personally I found for leveling that a boar is the best.
---
It eats everything, it gets charge and bite, and has high armor. So it quickly charges between mobs and since charge adds extra damage to the next attack and the boar will use bite as well you front load a ton of damage and threat so that you never pull off your pet. Boar is best for leveling honestly just because it can eat all the food.
---
I'm in the same boat. 
---
  I also rolled a resto shaman, hit 60, and suddenly found myself not having "fun".  It feels like all the people I play with are so serious and impatient.  
---
Healing is stressful because every group wants to move forward as fast as humanly possible.  I spam heals on the 3 people with aggro; hoping no one dies before the half mana bar I started with is spent, then eat 1/4 of my mana biscuit as the warrior pulls the next group... 
---
Without "fun" this game is just a treadmill of getting gear, just so you can go somewhere else and get more gear.
---
I'm a pala tank, so I'm unlikely to step foot in a raid for loot.
---
Only of my realistic BiS items is an "of the..." ring from sunken temple with defense on it.
---
post your video?
---
Congrats! I remember getting that back in Vanilla on my hunter. I was super stoked after all the hard work I put in to get it. Had to completely relearn how to play the game because up to that point I was still a clicker/keyboard turner, so it was quite a challenge for me.
---
I’ve already told this story, but a similar thing happened to me. Except that I was a paladin and just used divine shield / blessing of freedom, lol.
---
Priest is good. Also, warlock can summon and mage can port. Makes getting places very fast if you get some randos to help summon
---
Eh... To show that Druids also have like one helm, so to give another example.
---
It's called a rhetorical question
---
Smolderweb is very good
---
I play on a mid 2012 15” Pro and i haven’t had any issues outside of dropping a few frames in a couple of high particle effect areas. I’m not sure your hardware would be causing rubberbanding. Sounds more like a network issue
---
Ive leveled an alt using it to about 30 then got busy with prepping for raiding but as long as youre okay with pretty mindless leveling its totally worth it. 
---
Its 100% best to start using it with a brand new toon and not try to start AAP midway through leveling a toon
---
Many raid guilds only do one night a week (or 2 max) in Classic. This might change when new content releases, but for now raid requirements are lax.
---
exact route I flew the other day (hearth in ashenvale, but needed to go to ratchet for a quest). It took 10-15 minutes. I cooked dinner and came back and I was still over Mulgore. 
---
Good time to finish some housework.
---
What a leech lol

It's funny because living in Detroit I drive through Canada to get to New York
---
Ele is best post 40...
---
Lol okay. You think your carrion bird is gonna be sitting around with like Druid bear level of armor? (13k armor or something?)
---
No one runs Carrion bird because it sucks. Its not meta, its not faster than Owl.
---
For anyone confused, the math was done if your kill time is constant for a mob your level, regardless of what level you are.  It simply takes the # of mobs your level required to kill for that level's amount of experience.  Then, they can pick the halfway point based on the # of mobs.
---
Added to title. If you know of more let me know.

lol I'm going to avoid STV on my warrior. Don't want to get my ass constantly kicked. Might do it on my priest though.
---
Wish we’d see an add on for tanking which would let you know verbally when DPS use cooldowns. Like that old arena add on when your opponent would use CDs and you could gtfo. That way I can tab to their mob and make sure I don’t let them aggro.
---
Male gnomes KOS. Female depends on how I am feeling
---
I mean it really depends on the situation. If for instance you're a healer and you take ban'thok sash from a mage or warlock because it's "better than your green piece," it's kind of a dick move. I think the real problem is that people are AFRAID to wear greens as if they're not good. There are some great green pieces in the game.
---
If an item isnt your bis but it IS bis for someone else in your group, it's just common courtesy to pass it along to them. They literally cant get a better piece, you can. It's just being a nice person and a team player. If nobody else needs it, then sure go for it. But you really should be trying to help out your teammates when possible if something is better for them than it is for you.
---
Thank you for the comments! I appreciate that all comments were friendly and informative. Not a single "Go back to retail if you can't handle a real game" kinda stuff. Seems that Classic community really is better than retails.
---
My super intricate plan based on your comments:
---
1. Switch away from combat swords to daggers. Not decided on spec yet.
---
2. Focus more on PvP
---
3. If those fail going to roll an alt, prolly not a dps since many of you said that pve dps won't get much better.
---
4. If it still feels boring I'm just gonna quit and move on.
---
What is the energy ticking addon at the bottom you're using called?

ok zoomer
---
Sure thing buddy, whatever you say.
---
I would hardly call them “far nicer”. They are EXTREMELY close in stats. Staff has stam, combo has spirit and 1 more SD. Pick your poison!
---
You can just get on that boat you don't need to hide
---
They aren't recognizable even on Reddit.    They aren't Method.  These aren't world firsts or even new content.  Hell I didn't even know about them till some dick riders kept posting stuff.
---
You're also making my point - there's no competition here.    Who cares?  Very few tbh looking at the low likes.
---
This was hotfixed yesterday. I did it twice behind pillar then could no longer recreate after approx 11pst
---
Rogues can't lockpick that door - you have to steal the courtyard key. We can pick the door right before the final boss.
---
Source: am rogue.
---
I don't manage this, I made a comment
---
Not here for money so the first part is irrelevant.
---
Bop or not its money over gear so thats an irrelevant statement too as i see (example) a rogue rolling on needing heal gear just for money
---
Im arguing on need over greed so that doesnt make sense either.
---
Hmm. Not sure what you are getting at anymore. Simple concept really. MS over OS.
---
Yeah except no, because improved sprint and vanish both break root so in a 1v1 no mage ever beats my rogue
---
To be honest, I don’t really understand your point in digging into this. Boats and zeppelins are by far the most convenient, reliable ways to get around outside of the obvious things.
---
Oh, I thought the shaman totem was a buff and not a weapon mod.  Does windfury not stack with enchants either?
---
Maximum number of players per layer:
---
&gt;more players per layer
---
Maximum number of layers:

&gt;and we locked that in
---
Or do you find problem with the statement that the queue is made up of people who are trying to log into a full realm?
---
Well that's pretty damn crazy
---
Against tos, and why would you pay for someone else to play the game lmao?
---
Password will change, you'll try to recover, they check and you get banned.
---
If it makes you feel any better, ive been leveling on Grobbulus which is regarded as the most balanced between factions and yet I still find myself in 90% unfair match ups 2 v 1, skull vs lowbie, or getting ganked while im already at half life fighting a mob for a quest.
---
PvP on pvp servers isn't really pvp its more liek "play on this server and add in a few extra corpse runs into your leveling experience"
---
My network is completely fine, upload and download. Even had someone from my ISP come out, upgrade me to a knew modem. Nothing changed. 
---
I play other online games with zero issue. And I’ve play other much higher demanding games than WoW on this Macbook and on an even shittier laptop before my Macbook and I’ve never had any issues like this before.
---
Just based on my 15 year old memory... probably not. (But  I could be wrong.)
---
I was on the bleeding edge back then and played a little bit on pservers recently and I doubt it could be done. End raid fights like Nefarian took a couple months of wiping before we got the world first kill. However, progress yielded noticeable incremental results throughout.
---
We put the same amount of time and effort into C'thun but we did not see the same results. I don't remember exactly what our best attempt was but it was not even remotely close to sub 10%. It might not have even been sub 80%. Now, over the years I have seen people talk shit saying they had sub 10% attempts but I have never seen any evidence to back up these claims so I consider them to be bullshit. For reference, I was in Death and Taxes for AQ and we took world \~3rd on nerfed-C'thun, and I'm pretty sure we killed him first attempt. And in my mind, the nerfed-C'thun was a joke of a fight literally dying the same day it was patched. Yet that fight remains as one of the most difficult in the eyes of others. 
---
So, the mechanics weren't difficult for a top guild that spent a couple months practicing, so what you're asking is.... Would world buffs, 1.12 talents, and more finely tuned BIS gear have made the difference? Well, our gear choices weren't perfectly minmaxxed back then (and I can't be sure if people were just wearing shit for the screenshot) but you can see our C'thun gear here, it's pretty good: [https://i.imgur.com/bZXh6y5.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/bZXh6y5.jpg) 
---
World buffs and 1.12 talents certainly added a ton of dps and a good amount of HP but not enough for players to survive the portal which instantly killed you from time to time, or the tentacles that spawned in the stomach or literally inside walls, or when the eyes would spawn inside the walls and laser people regardless of their positioning. So deaths were unavoidable regardless of HP and tanks dying meant healers dying which meant more dying. There was essentially a hard capped timer on the fight and we were no where near hitting it so I doubt even tripling our raid's DPS would not have been enough to net a kill.
---
Still, a lot of this is just from my memory so I could be wrong and perhaps all it would take would be some lucky RNG regarding the amount of deaths to bugs and who dies to the bugs. Sadly we will probably never know as it was difficult for Blizz to cobble a 1.12 client together so I can't imagine they would have the data on a bugged encounter.
---
Yes they’re there but it’s nothing like setting up with lower cooldowns, prep, faster stealth, and everything else. Makes being a rogue a lot more fun to always have so many options open all the time, especially when soloing.
---
I’m playing on the Windows side of my Macbook
---
GROOOOBBBB MOBBB!!
---
I saw it drop on my 4th or 5th time in BRD. Didn't bother rolling on it though because hunter.
---
chill bro
---
So higher level areas are the same? That’s disappointing. If I can’t move servers I may quit
---
Let's counter that thought for a second.  The only reason this is against the TOS is because there is cross faction discussions on a PvP server.
---
If a guild of people want to lock down Ravasaurs in Un'Goro for two weeks to jack the price up while they dominate the market; it's going to have nearly the same effect.  
---
There are two ways to break up playstyle like this, and neither of them have anything to do with the people.
---
1. You make the asset irrelevant by opting out of needing it.  Or
---
2. You alter the ability for people to monopolize by diversifying the opportunity to obtain said item.  (Meaning you give any Raptor lvl 55 or above a chance to drop the leather with Ravasaurs having a 90% chance)
---
Against strangers, i can understand why you would roll on a second or third bis.
---
With friends or guildies.... the reason you should pass a second or third bis to someone who the item is their first bis is you will potentially be replacing it shortly down the road, so you would essentially be turning that item into vendor gold.
---
Heres an example ... third week the game is out and im in a full guild grp doing LBRS.   We kill shadow hunter and she drops blackrow.  I play a hunter, and at that time blackcrow would be a decent upgrade over my current green bow.  However, i am fully aware there are several other items that will replace this as prebis before im able to get the current bis, RhokDelar.   So i pass the bow to a rogue.
---
Two days later,  carapace spine crossbow drops from nerub boss in strath undead, and the same rogue that was in the LBRS with me was also in the strath undead.... it was a feelsgood moment to know i did the right thing by not taking an item i would potentially replace in two days.
---
I’m a 31 priest, at what level can I start doing some SM? I haven’t done any dungeons since WC. 
---
For all these aoe groups you hear about, which wing are they running, how long is it taking per run and how much exp per run are they getting?
---
how is that elitist?
---
I agree and I wasn't saying that. And no, it's not common courtesy. If my item sucks, I'm not passing on a 2nd BiS, and it isn't being rude. The only time I consider this is if an item is only a few stats better than mine but a LOT for the other guy, I give it up. Otherwise -- if it's a viable piece for me (not spell damage for a healer), then I'm rolling on it.
---
Does Incendius warrant having higher ping or is there a just as good west server?
---
Fury is really just as good as arms. Arms just benefits more from having an up-to-date 2hander.
---
Wow how was the compition?
---
Phase two is going to be a nightmare. I know people on welfare who do nothing but PvP all day every day. They aren't even looking forward to it.
---
Homeboy pretty specced out
---
Lol whatever you do don't roll on skeram, it's 80-20 horde alliance at this point
---
I was wondering that. Haven’t seen it yet, but then never made a real effort to check as I’m lazy.
---
It seems like Bing doesn't understand intent that well!
---
Imagine being the guy in question. He spends 100 of hours poopsocking a video game, probably playing 10 hours a day, while also claiming to have a job. 
---
Imagine going to work and coming straight home and spending every waking minute in a video game. If that’s not depression I don’t know what is. 
---
To top it off, his account is banned and all his wasted time on a video game is even more wasted. Dude might legit kill himself.
---
Yeah it isn’t as good as it used to be. I did 3 clears today as well made about 22. Definitely doesn’t feel like quick gold farming.
---
It sounds like the guild drama outshadowed your entire experience.
---
It's not for incendius, it's for the mobs in front of him and the fireguards.
---
It does, but save that for raids/dungeons.  I don't use the expensive stuff for solo work.
---
Misunderstood your comment "honor to serve by your side" thought you were referring the people who run the sub.  Looked like part of the sticky.  My bad.
---
Haha, i guess you had no idea wtf you were talking about
---
I've a dozen or so trolls that looked exactly like me on the way to level 40.
---
It's hilarious that people above seem to think that the wowhead comments are for conversations and not just for aggregating info over time.
---
Also wondering this
---
Me! I was just thinking to myself that it just is like it was. Getting the chills when entering brm for the first time. Getting really excited from your first epic. Making friends that you group with every night. This game is so good
---
This hands down is the best meme I have ever seen. Thank you!
---
Because they couldn’t allow servers with 100k people if they wanted to be able to remove it by P2. It’s quite simple :)
---
Now go try a Rogue or Warlock.
---
Need more rage
---
Who has the upvotes?
---
Who is posting sources to back up my claims?
---
Who is posting the equations for calculating these stats?
---
Gee I wonder who is wrong here.
---
Here let me put it this way:
---
#Carrion Bird isn’t “bad”, especially if you are horde, but its not “better” than an owl or a bat.
---
Ah yes, the lift boss many
---
oooeee! Actually would be interesting to see a pre-pre-BiS chart for a class and compare haha. Like whatever you get from 5 man instances + quests.
---
How can I delete someone else’s post?
---
Good luck with that. Mounts are level 40
---
nah i dont know. My chars are only in 20s to early 30s
---
Leveled to 60 as fire because I know i'll spend the next months as frost.
---
using rfc to ghetto hearth from org (to kargath for most) when hearth is on cooldown
---
You are conflating expected values with probabilities. It’s a very common and very annoying problem when talking about statistics. Just because something has a 10% drop rate doesn’t mean you should see 1 in 10 runs. You need to calculate the probability of it not dropping in 10 runs and take the inverse.
---
God speed!
---
They ARE recognizable, why else would there be so many mentions of them in this thread? You said it yourself. Unless you think they pay people to go into threads and name drop them, which is laughable.
---
And no its not new content - but there was still a 'race to world first' and they won.
---
virgin squad showing up to defend their brethren
---
Maybe this is your real quest
---
Hey now!
---
&gt;because after a certain point healers are just pumping out such big heals that you're instantly back to full anyway
---
Unless you get killed in under .5 seconds which there are a few instances of that in BWL. It was after BWL(where druids become more viable again btw) that we started giving no shits in vanilla. FYI this 'but on private server' stuff is hilarious because.. we knew all this in vanilla..
---
“who are you?”
---
“i’m you, but **stronger**”
---
How have either one of us been trolls? The person above gave you clear information but your too naive to accept it. I just wanted to step in because your attitude is appalling.
---
Mana on-use is *the* shit. 'specially for those sticky situations like an AoE kite gone wrong or surprise PvP when you're down on mana
---
The only fun thing about rogues is ganking, trolling and pissing people off. Go stealth into the opposing factions major city and just screw shit up or mess with people. Youll feel the fun again.
---
Dodge isnt close to the same as miss, and even by your quote it would make 305 and 310 different (6% vs 5.5%)
---
It hasn't been touched since before Classic's release, has major bugs and pathing issues with no plans to fix it according to its discord. Might as well use something else. Like a manual guide via classicwow.live on a 2nd screen or one of the other guide addons.
---
There's this free one: https://github.com/cralor/TourGuideVanilla
---
or for a bit of cash, there's Zygor which seems fairly high quality: https://www.zygorguides.com/
---
That comment is probably as old as that dude lol
---
If you do, lookup power shifting macros. At their basic level they are something like...
---
cancelform [noform:3]
---
use [noform:3] Cat Form
---
use [form:3] Prowl
---
That one will shift you to cat form and trigger prowl immediately no matter what form you are in. There are lines for dismounting and standing up too.
---
My bad, my grammars terrible I've changed it :)
---
Nah it's a mix, like we got 1.9 nerfed DM
---
Dude, the tentacles you had to kill could spawn in places like the stomach or even outside the room and kill you. They could spawn under you and punt you into the cieling and instagib you(lethal fall damage). The stomach debuff would not stop stacking after you went in and sometimes you could never get out because the pad to tele back up just didn't work fucking half hte time. It doesn't matter what knowledge you have now, you don't even have the knowledge we had back then rofl. It was bugged to shit.
---
Why not you have dots to keep up,  life tap management , potion management and life drain management, it’s a lot more than 3 buttons
---
No the guys I'm talking about were in European countries and pvpesdlike crazy. They were actually on welfare. 
---
Just talk to some old PS pvpers and you will realize there's quite a few of them.
---
"it's not because we need it, it shows you belong to the type of guild we want to be"
---
Sword of omen if you can get your guild to carry you through Cath, would for sure be worth it.
---
Should post this on /r/FaerlinaPvP too
---
Not saying you are wrong at all, but you got like any source or anything to back up your comment?
---
Im currently rolling an rogue alt, so I'm a bit curious.
---
The answer is kind of obvious isnt it? You're obviously aware that you didnt have fun because of guild drama, do you think that happens for every guild every week?
---
(My first rag kill i meant)
---
No, we could kill the tentacles sometimes and then after that we'd still be getting the debuff stack when we went up. Or you'd get stuck down there and be unable to go back up. Anyone who went down into the stomach was pretty much being sacrificed to the old gods for a chance at killing tentacles. Oh and the tentacles that spawned down there? Yah they could just randomly hit people up top after everyone down there was dead btw.

Oh, you mean the phase where DPS spends most of their time moving between tentacles and if the mages miss a counterspell, a quarter of the raid goes away?
---
Must be good to have people help you farm your gear... MT are like spoiled little princesses.Never wrong, making drama when they don't get what they want.
---
I played on it to level 34 then transferred off to earthfury. That server is nearly unplayable as alliance
---
&gt;Not here for money so the first part is irrelevant.
---
That's simply objectively not true.
---
&gt; Im arguing on need over greed so that doesnt make sense either.
---
No you're arguing for YOUR greed over everyone else's greed.
---
&gt; Bop or not its money over gear so thats an irrelevant statement too as i see (example) a rogue rolling on needing heal gear just for money
---
No, that's a very important difference, because that means if a rogue rolls on BOP healer gear, he's an asshole as he benefits less than a healer would, but if he rolls on BOE healer gear he benefits exactly as much as the healer would.
---
&gt;  Not sure what you are getting at anymore. Simple concept really. MS over OS.
---
What I'm getting at, is that getting Furor's does in no way shape or form benefit you more than anyone else in the group.
---
LFG addon isn't banned bud. I've been using it every day for weeks now.
---
iirc there were bug fixes released before he was nerfed. You didnt need to do any math to determine that someone couldnt solo a stomach tentacle.
---
did u know 1v1 isnt balanced
---
that's how it's supposed to work. When MC breaks, the priest becomes the target.
---
thats why we need more
---
Not fast but I wouldn’t say slow
---
Ring of SP is super fuckin good, gz
---
We got the recipe after two days. My mage friend took the recipe and I got the sinew. How much are they sellin for on your server?
---
Yea happend to me yesturday
---
Whoever he is he is one tough badass.
---
Nice! Does your guild do open rolls on every item? Mine has been doing loot council so it's pretty much round robin
---
I'd need a lot more info to answer this question effectively.  How bad was the ot's "not amazing" gear?  How geared were the healers trying to keep him up?  What specific pulls did he die on?  Way too many variables here to say that the fault is on the dw fury spec and not on, say, someone trying to do it that doesn't understand the mechanics.
---
Fury tanking should be solving a problem for a raid group, not causing one, and until the raid leader(s) decide(s) that including a fury tank is a net benefit to the raid group, you're probably better off relegating someone to playing deep prot to tank.
---
I don't think he's dickriding yo I think he's literally in the guild lol THEY ARE RECONGIZABLE REEEE
---
hit is more important for swords because hoj/sword spec proc mh hits.  so you need the hit for the proc and for the actual bonus attack iirc.
---
I mean I have found 0
---
uhhhhh just pop an arcane protection + fap and go to town my dude. That fight is amazing for warriors. You're ragecapped the whole fight and get to feel like a god.
---
Sword of omen beats it with raw damage and all the stats you get.
---
Bring it!
---

---
white dmg is closer to 60-70% in a raid...

I've just gone combat swords and it seems to be the problem.

Fuckin' Moobare.

What is a zoomer
---
How could this be true since each layer is an entire copy of Azeroth? And how do you explain the fact that layers do effect the server pop? From the [blue post about overcrowded servers](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/overcrowded-realm-update/255835) back at launch:
---
&gt; While we are able to fit several times more players on a single realm in 2019 than was the case in 2006, we are not going to raise that cap any further, even though we have the technical capacity to do so. Raising realm caps would simply forestall the problem, letting more players in at launch but creating an unsustainable situation down the line, with severe queues when we turn off layering permanently before Phase 2 of our content unlock plan.
---
How could queues increase when layering was turned off if layering was unrelated to the server population?
---
Gonna be funny when he uses trinket to escape cheap shot only to get kidney shot right after lol
---
I did approximately 5-8 different types of runs of BRD daily for the past 10 days, gaining levels 51 to 57. I’ve never  seen a chain,hoj or havelring once. Should i just let go?
---
It's not worth the debuff slots for your dots in raids locks tend to just shadowbolt spam
---
fly, go make some food, use bathroom, check on flight, browse web, check on flight, start a movie, afk at fp
---
So many people going the wrong way directly into the laser. Good times.
---
Also please stop talking about BIS if you arent lvl 60. I had someone in WC talking about the gear being BIS....
---
If it's a pug, you can't blame em but also it should be all need imo for pug BoEs (unless the item was stated as res'd)
---
It's silly to think randoms will give up something worth 100g, let alone the book for QS (1300g on my server rn)
---
I wouldn't expect a pug group to pass on Freezing Band if I was the only mage.
---
If it's a guild run, that's another story.
---
APES wouldn't have a chance. Being one shot by 100% unavoiablebullshit, or having untargetable mobs killing you is why it was impossible.
---
The blue post you are referring to was a difference from pservers to live and are talking about situations in which you don't have 305 weapon skill since most players believed it was 8%. 
---
And 8% would be correct!... except you also get .4% hit, .04% crit, and some parry reduction per weapon skill level (effected by diminishing returns) which gives you two hit. Making it 6%. 
---
[This](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_skill)  should have all the info you need. Feel free to read it.
---
Alliance flight points in Kalimdor are pretty wonky in general. The 3 goblin town FPs also cost singificantly more. Alliance pretty much always pass through Ratchet since Barrens is a giant horde territory sitting right in the middle of the continent, so that brings the costs up as well.
---
Rogue and mage have the best threat dumps and the best DPS in not so amazing gear, while also scaling well with gear. Warriors are as good or better if they have gear (including mail and leather) and can stay below a well geared tank on the threat meter.
---
I account share with my friend for everything. One time I logged on his account in retail and was temp banned for account sharing. Just don't do it lol.
---
The fuck is even the point? Most of the joy in classic is the levelling experience..
---
Gay
---
&gt; Blizzard should release phase 2 already because only good thing to do is pvp at this point.
---
Then PVP?
---
Then they removed that feature and republished it, *bud*.
---
Yes that one. If you have people dying because your warlocks aren't coil rotation properly it's not because the fight is mathematically impossible.. The fight is hard I agree.
---
Using trinkets on sap and polys tend to just lead to another sap or poly....
---
I'm in my 30's and still rolling 6 slotters. Kind of a pain sometimes but upgrading is expensive.
---
Incorrect, feel free to review other's vods or your own. Wing Buffet is the cast ability which reduces the threat by 25% of anyone hit. It is semantics at this point but i'd like there to be less false information going around about onyxia.
---
Isn't WC the first dungeon for Horde? Are you sure you want to sound this nerdy?
---
fyi all the people who would go down there woudl likely die down there, get stuck down there(and die) or wipe the raid by having eyes spawn near them that kill them and then kill the raid without having anything possible to be done. Even if everything went perfect their debuffs wouldn't come off correctly when they came back up(if they aren't stuck) and they would.. also die.
---
I've noticed that there's an abundance of bad mages, I guess because everyone thinks it'll be an easy ride
---
You don't have dots slots in raid, there's a 16 cap debuffs on target and warlocks just have to put the three curses, Element, Shadow and Recklessness
---
Maybe there's a few slots available for 1/2 corruptions, but it's rare, if all the warlocks put all the dots you end up cancelling more important debuffs like sunders or winter's chill
---
Depends on what else you're doing. Have you leveled any professions in that time? Got any gear from dungeons? Opened up flight paths for later use? Have you taken your time and enjoyed the quest lore or just speedrun through?
---
Not saying there's a right or wrong, just lots of factors. Some people go slow and do that stuff while leveling, some go fast and do it at 60. Whatever makes you happy, nobody is gonna care what your /played is except for you.
---
Actually, yeah, I use the Twitch app for my wow addons. It lets me know when they're out of date and updates all of my addons with a single click. Saves me a ton of time that way in regard to keeping things updated. I've got a full time job and a family, so if I've only got a few hours to play WoW I don't want to spend a quarter of it updating addons one by one.
---
Totally agree, brother. I don’t know.
---
1. Win+Shift+S for a snip of your screen that goes directly into my clipboard.

2. Win+2 to open Chrome (since it's on the 2nd spot on my taskbar).

3. Click Reddit bookmark (I have r/hearthstone and r/wowclassic bookmarked).

4. It's very likely I'm going to be posting on one of those subs, so I simply click *Submit Post*.

5. Ctrl+V to paste the image in, add the title and I'm done.

You skipped over the fact that when taking a photo with your phone you have to take you phone, unlock it, take the picture, find the subreddit you wish to post to (slower on phones), and then you can post it.
---
You can't just enumerate all the steps on one side, but not on the other.
---
The "ideal" WSG comp is generally 1 of each class except 2 mages and 2 priests
---
It really depends on the game. An issue I have with hyper realistic looking games is that because I am looking at 3D visuals on a 2D screen (monitor or TV), things can blend in too much and become hard to make out what's what. I'll take a more cartoony/stylized looking game if it means I won't have to struggle to figure out what I'm even looking at.
---
Better level your alts now, because sure enough when you get off that flight path, you are gonna have a bad timmmme
---
I'd usually say there's nothing wrong here, but it depends which item they're talking about.
---
If this is a raid item, then it should go towards whomever it is BiS for if you're in a serious raiding guild. The second guy was correct in that instance. I don't see why pointing out that it's BiS for warriors is in any way elitist. He didn't even claim no one else should roll for it.
---
If you're pugging and this is a dungeon type item, then it's fair game all around. 
---
Personally don't see why it matters that the comment is 13yrs old. People are seemingly still reading the wowhead comments for info in the present. Correcting/clarifying people seems fair game.
---
Aimed shot crit chance is spell crit chance or normal crit chance?
---
Mara slime on orange side is ez pz
---
you know people camp others for hours for no reason right? But your missing the point, like most of this sub usually does, It doesnt matter what it looks like, you and blizzard can know 100% thats the reason.... but THEY CANT PROVE IT. Blizzard will never act on it unless they do or say something in game......
---
I'm not sure why this is such a difficult concept for so many, its very very very basic logic that is going over so many.... its really sad :(
---
Not anymore. Apparently it’s 6% total. So 5% from precision and 1% from ring which makes shadowcraft potentially bis now. 
---

---
This is great, thanks a bunch!
---
And no one cares about you.
---
If you're playing fury tank and haven't resigned yourself to having armor consumables to make up for your loss of shield armor AND aren't carrying a shield for emergencies/pulls where you need one, you shouldn't be playing a fury tank anyway, imo
---
That's cool! It's fun to know the proc chances of stuff.      
---
Doesn't normalizing the weapon damage negate the speed penalty on Sinister Strike? I thought all 1-h swords are normalized to a set speed.
---
Oh were your warlocks teleporting across the room onto them?
---
He's literally the same level as most of them.
---
Either avoid pugs until you get the book or make your own pug group on master looter and let everyone know upfront the book is yours.
---
I just swapped from 2h arms to dw fury at lvl 56 for a change up for final lvls. It's going just fine. I love the flurry of attacks when I'm stance dancing for overpowers and whirlwinds and all the things. It's a bit tougher on multiple mobs mainly due to lack of SS, but it seems fine overall.
---
However, dps seems to have taken a hit on the recount meter. I haven't done any dungeons yet so I dunno how that will go. I keep my 2h on me so if I need to up the dps i can slap it on.
---
First, why so many downvotes? OP stated they're new to wow. Second, how does Arcane compare to frost for raiding now vs later?
---
Thanks for the suggestion :)
---
Warrior could be good. He can give you free food, you can hold a bunch of mobs for him to aoe down. Plus if you don’t mind tanking, finding dungeon groups would be real easy.
---
That's a possibility lol!
---
I mean, you have to spend that gold on something.
---
Now that you’ve made this comment, it’s officially a trifecta.
---
Yeah man. Elites are harder to kill than normal creatures. They're roughly balanced around group play. It's not surprising they take about as long to kill at only 10 levels lower.
---
Yeah he was greens/blues. I think he watched asmongold's video and tried to meme lol.
---
As a druid tank main, I'll say this.
---
SM Armory cleared at 35.
---
Uldaman cleared except last boss at 41.
---
Rolling for bindings... cringe...
---
There were streamers doing it on twitch last night. I would say try and find a druid or rogue streamer and see how they were doing it. I don't have any links I can share I'm afraid
---
It's been a while but I have a vague memory of Mimiron being bugged into oblivion when Ulduar first came out. Blizzard hotfixed him rather quickly but it was a wipefest galore, he slaughtered tons of raiders and was seemingly impossible to kill. After I think days of trying, though, my guild succeeded. Then we burnt out and couldn't get ourselves to kill Yoggy (our goal was to get the server first). I doubt it was as hard as C'thun or even Yoggy with 0 but I mean, even though the bug was crazy hard we still managed to do it. So who knows?
---
Granted, I never did kill C'thun in vanilla (only got to BWL) but people are disturbingly competent these days.
---
Yeah let him use your account to buy gold and then get your entire [battle.net](https://battle.net) account banned.  sounds fine.
---
Not sure if it was fixed, but at least for the first few weeks, if you opened to check what was inside, and closed the loot window, the chest despawned whether you looted or not...
---
Jaggle I can’t even get away from u on Reddit..
---
Back when I first played we would have called this a female priest!
---
So if I'm playing a human rogue and have swords I only need 1% hit from gear? What about pvp?
---
How do you deal with 6 second blink?
---
I'd pay that troll toll
---
Yes but those are the minority by far. For most people, you are not in a position where 4 strength as a rogue will make any difference at all... your money can be *much* better spent.
---
They're reading off a checklist and buying what they're told, not understanding the game.
---
Pet passive, then FD, then trap
---
I've been in raids where we stacked absolutely stupid amounts of buffs before, and at no point would I have been able to apply my full rotation *plus heroic strike every single swing* off of nothing but offhand rage gen.
---
And this was in AQ40+ gear.
---
what should I play?   
---
Druid, hunter, mage or warlock?   
---
Which faction?  
---
Which server?
---
Ok guys I’m officially declaring AI to be a hoax
---
I just don't get it. Leveling a warrior is not THAT bad. If anything warrior is probably the one class that has an easy gear progression to 60 which makes the leveling experience one of the better ones. I mean have you tried leveling a Paladin???? You think warrior leveling is slow? try that.
---
I think you can just root a mob next to them and it'll attack the closest enemy (them). Something like mage frost nova or druid entangle.
---
Hologram
---
49 and in the same boat. I’m enhancement and don’t want to be a caster or healer. Probably just pvp.
---
Thanks man! That sounds much more in line with my experience. I was noticing ever so slightly higher numbers on a slower weap, and didn't understand - assuming it was confirmation bias.
---
Eeeey what's up bud &lt;3
---
grew up in Lasalle. windsor has some of the best pizza had. shout out to bullseye pizza
---
Sm ruin at first, ds ruin after you hit a certain gear threshold, beyond bwl
---
Oh what a load of shit. Sorry but as someone who actually played vanilla this patch is *absurdly* easy compared to the vast majority of the original game.
---
You can gear up and clear MC in a week now, in a god damn *PUG*. I'd love to see most of those people clear the original UBRS or scholo, forget MC. Jesus christ.
---
"We're a family around here at this company, hope you're a *team player* too"
---
Nothing at work... boooo
---
Who dis tho
---
No, super fucking common actually
---
there's some on firemaw too.
---
devilsaur stuff is like 90% sold by alts, almost never by mains. if i shift click devilsaur sellers, it's some weirdly named person level 1 shouting it in org.  sometimes a bank alt.
---
90% of stuff is sold by mains usually, so it's kind easy to tell that something fucky is going on because almost no-one sells it on their main.
---
Well, did you do it?
---
Man... People will find a way to be confused about anything. The explanation is very clear.
---
&gt; Killing mobs is exploiting now?
---
Non elite mobs providing elite drops and XP was a bug that people exploited. Stop talking out your arse.
---
It's a hacker trying to steal your account
---
Keep trying dude, I ran it all weekend and I got it, Druid was pissed but no more green baby
---
Technically yes for your yellow hits.  That being said you'll still want to get as much hit as you can as long as you aren't gimping other stats as your white hits will still have a -24% base hit chance.
---
Do you get lots of error message spam from zperl in chat?
---
streamer servers do tend to have much worse community aspects in my personal experience, anecdotes aside though, does it not seem strange that a lot of the news and groups on those servers tend to have bad histories and news like this comes out more often?
---
Sounds like you included slam warriors in your parse.
---
I'd like to see your source, because I have a lot of experience raiding as fury at a high level and white swings were always the majority of my damage, as well as the other DW fury warriors. The spec with a huge proportion of special damage is Slam 2h fury.
---
I right-clicked it :)
---
It's a meme, leveling a warrior is actually fun, you need to take care more than any other class, Paladin is boring yes, but has self heals.
---
Right, if I was a 30-something druid in Gnomer and MCP dropped and a Warrior needed it, I might be a little upset inside but I’d get it if it was an upgrade for them. People need to chill out about that stuff, it’s just a game after all...
---
Yeah alternatively I can just not care about stupid internet points. Feel free to try.
---
I don't have hard data, but from the perspective of healing a lot of 5mans, I would wager that Earthfury bonuses are very strong for that content!
---
It's all fun and games until you face back to back 5 minute respawn timers.
---
You're ogreacting.
---
Theres really not many occasions where something is someone's BIS and it's also a very viable piece for you (i.e. not spell damage for a healer) but not also your bis. I feel like these occasions people say are always happening are pretty rare, like taking HOJ on a hunter or something.
---
paladin prebis lists completely ignore spell crit...
---
I don't :(
---
He wants to play on your account because you have a better class for farming? Does he know that there’s a button called CREATE A NEW CHARACTER?
---
You’re 100% right, don’t let him.
---
&gt; No one opens with a PoM Pyro lmao.
---
have you SEEN the people playing lately?
---
Now I feel bad for the mods.
---
Having to clear these shit quality posts every hour of the day, every day of the week.
---
Bing. Not even once.
---
This post could not be more related to me. Broke my heart to sell my whirlwind axe. May he rest in peace
---
I’m one of the higher-level officers of one of the biggest guilds on the Alliance side of the server. Bunches of level ranges. Shoot me a PM if you roll Ally.
---
I've only done skinning, also how fast is rogue compared to other classes?
---
I mean, do what makes you happy, but I don’t think this is a very good idea.  It’s like a shammy healer specing enhancement on the logic that you will need to heal less if the mobs die faster.
---
Eeey making gains :D
---
r/woosh
---
Wrong. Also "current patch"? It's not like the mechanics of swing time and instant abilities is going to change later on. The only difference between Classic now and Classic Phase 6 is available content.
---
The only "insult" is when I said that you saying 5% armor is nothing was nonsense. If 2-3% damage reduction is nothing then so is a 2-3% damage increase. You're not right, get over it.
---
relax
---
Yep :) that's why it's in the humor section. At least they did put some effort in getting similarly looking account name ;)
---
You just pull the boss back to where you killed Garr and do it there, it's super easy.
---
This depends heavily on what server you are on (time zone) and what the population/ratio is on said server.
---
I edited my initial comment, but I did find some more reliable data and it seems I was incorrected and outdated. 
---
My apologies!
---
It's going to be insane, but I don't think we will ever experience world PvP like this in WoW ever again. I'm looking forward to it, but my alts are not.
---
Earth fury 50/50
---
Very helpful if you just want to listen to podcasts/YouTube videos in the background while doing that. Very comfy tbqh.
---
Yep nobody wants to touch the crazy lawsuit happy customer. Why would you?
---
What? This doesn't make sense.
---
God I hate that fucking douchebag response.
---
Druid stance bar macro: instantly recast cat form. SWIGGITY SWOOTY
---
I guess we're all a little special, lol
---
I know the situation may suck.. But that's the cool thing about WoW : It's a world where things happen.
---
You say it yourself : it's MAFIA. Well, in the real world even the police can't do much against the mafia.
---
Either farm up some gold, pay the 3x price, and move on or do something about it: 
---
Start up a mass Guild, organse big coordinated events where you wipe out this whole bunch of scumbags and countercamp them at the spirithealer while another group farms leather.
---
Boy will you be proud when you tell the story to your grandchildren about how you stood up against the great devilsaur leather mafia!!!
---
"Are you ready for a war?"
---
means he died in warcraft 3.
---
Wicked guild name
---
Bro you can’t PvP without dungeon gear. The whole game is dungeons.
---
I typed all that out because your saying so much bullshit. You literally dont think I asked if anyone wants to recruit me as my one and only question in the initial post. You people literally told me over and over again to create a back story after I had already said I know IN THE INITIAL POST. The list of really stupid shit you and other people were saying was making it hard for me to catch all the bullshit within my comments....So ya its best I bring in the levels of our intellectual abilities. If this is going to be about what question I asked in my other post then ya I am going to bring in our intellectual abilities because you literally think I didnt ask what I had asked, its such a simple thing......and you didnt get it or still dont get it even though weve been over this numerous times. Like I said the list of the amount of bullshit is rediculous. I am telling you, with all my fkin brain power, I am 100% sure that my only question in the other post was asking if anybody wants to recruit me. 
---
Now onto the 2% thing, I was referring to the percentile thing, mentioned it multiple times, if you dont know then its just something else to add to the list of things which you are clueless about in this conversation. So that you do know, well its referring to my placement on tests issued by the state and the military.
---
Yea there's a couple that drop currently at least
---
Ouro didn't leave his room, he would just start porting people to him.

Its becomes smoother if the Warrior gets his Aggro reset, but we dont plan for it, but we should probably
---
I am Ele 31/0/20 and the warrior is Fury 17/34/0.
---
&gt;one minute
---
Maybe if you pull all three groups together and aoe them or something.
---
This has honestly killed my interest in classic. I knew it would be like this though. Old-school RuneScape is the exact same. Everyone is super elitist and min-maxes everything. If you play just to have fun you're criticized for "doing it wrong".
---
If you are softstacking they literally cannot spawn outside of range. 
---
Have you even done this boss recently?
---
Stalagg is great - its about 20%/80%
---
I'd much rather be a paladin.
---
This is amazing. Lol
---
Well so you know, it’s been almost 10 years since I tried that, so sorry for the slight misinfo, but still doesn’t change the fact, it breaks blind.
---
Can we implement some kind of system that lets user's vote the post up or down?
---
As an AOE mage levelling(currently 42), i played on OCE Yojamba, the 2nd highest pop. It was crazy packed even when layered. Some hotspots can have up to 4 mages, which makes it really
---
infuriating. Even at late nights 1am-ish there will still be mages. 
---
Made the switch to Felstriker (lowest pop, no layer) and it improved a ton. Probably at most 1 other mage during peak hours.  Improved the levelling alot.
---
Only down side is economy/lfg. Decent but not as “lively” as high pop zones.
---
If they're bugged, make sure you're out of their "range" and let them get 1 melee hit then continue running. They'll reset. Something something coding and getting a AA que'd and won't relent.
---
yeah I think my tailor alt is above 150 tailoring, but I never bother training for silk bags. Figured it wasn't worth it going from 6 to 8 slots. But 6 to 10 might be worth the jump...
---
I see the "invite to Asmon layer" even on my server which is not Faerlina so
---
Nah, according to OP only normies use mage portals.
---
&gt;Greens with +30 spell power will sell for 150g
---
Lmao what what server do you play on? That stuff is like 15g on my server.
---
I thought the windfury totem was just a regular buff though on a player and not an actual imbue like the others.  I'm obviously wrong though.
---
Most people I play with have one... You don't need to ask us for permission, go right ahead and make one
---
My 60 proest has  30s rings and still a hat and amulet from SM lol
---
It's kind of hard to get items that don't suck
---
Deadly Boss Mobs or BigWigs.
---
Never sell the whirlwind axe
---
I let mages die of they aoe to soon. I let pets die if it's taunting off of me. Sometimes even higher level rogues with high DPS I'll let them off tank. I play video games to chill not to stress over holding threat.
---
Got a rogue to 60 and realized how grueling it is to get a tank on my server so I am now leveling a tank, lol.
---
That's not a good viewpoint either. If it's a slight upgrade for you and if it's BIS for someone else, and you roll, you're an ass.
---
Now is it bugged or does someone need a lesson on aggro?
---
Symbiotic relationships... LMFAO
---
Warrior leveling gets a ton of shit because it's entirely gear dependant and unless youre doing dungeons the gear just isn't great. Also, without any form of healing it can be difficult to do some zones which is why it's suggested to always stay 1-2 levels above the zone you're in. I'm leveling mine right now and enjoying it! But it is far more difficult than other classes I've played.
---
Don't all good guilds do this? Seems like a solid plan to me and I main rogue.
---
This is how it was for competitive players, nothing much changed. Maybe those who didn't have the privilege to invest time in the game are now taking it more seriously. There were excel sheets, "pre bis" guides and tons of grinding to be geared for MC so a guild can consider you as a member for raids.
---
For me I can stop and smell the flowers sometimes while playing, but leveling to me is a grind, the items are a grind, everything is mundane until the real part of the game at 60.
---
HoJ farm is a joke compared to the Gladiator Mail Chain
---
&lt;- 300 runs, 4 HoJ, 0 Gladiator Chests
---
Yeah it could be worse. The big thing is if you end up getting a freezing band or expensive book... then the story changes.
---
Next time go to TB. Seeing that on a fucking lift.  Oh better yet, try to get it to the UC....
---
I reply in the hopes of productive discussion.
---
If you look at the other comments, you'll see that a few other commenters brought up mechanical changes between classic and vanilla. I upvoted their comments and voiced my agreement.
---
Had a dude ninja 2 chests in row the other night.. he was made to leave early.
---
Don't be a dick when the group has more than enough dps to 4 man the dungeon... He missed a hell of a drop to.
---
Dude chill. People have kids, unexpected work calls. Life happens and its usually more important than a game that is supposed to be for fun. I'm sure there are dicks out there too but you don't know whats going on behind someone else's screen.
---
thank you so much&lt;3

Respec. Adds new life to the game.

pick one
---
Really? That is interesting, do you mind sending a link?
---
Actually OP does.  He asked a question and I was first to answer him.  And even though a few others have jumped on and confirmed the 42 halfway XP mark I gave as correct, I was told that it was "terrible advice" and downvoted.
---
I don't care if others believe me, seems like a silly thing to question when its so easily verifiable - I just answered a simple question.  Seems to me everyone else responding to my comments in this way are the ones whose inputs are meaningless, not mine.  Telling a person who gives a correct answer his answer is wrong and then creating several sub-comments arguing about it gives no value to the OP.
---
Nope sorry, thanks for the offer though!
---
Also your staff skill is still 50 skill points behind.
---
I was in a Jed/Rend run group a few days ago, and the group was intending to do multiple runs. We kill Jed and one of the mages hearths out saying he "has to repair" when he hadn't died at all during the run. When questioned about the choice he responded "it's ok, I don't need anything off Rend anyways" LOL
---
He was kicked from the group after that statement.
---
But why not those sweet crafted blue items. Dreamweave i think it was called.
---
In raid yes.
---
Reading the quest log is hard...
---
50 Arcanite bars from memory.
---
You can go with your friend BUT, by joining their group thier dungeon lockout would be set to yours. Your dungeon id will have recorded what bosses you have defeated so that the next time you go into MC, you can pick up where you left off. By joining a different group, all the bosses youve already defeated will already be dead causing your new group to miss out in those bosses.
---
Because the tauren would of become extinct without the horde. Logging in a tiny portion of Ashenvale probably wouldn't break that blood pact

Jesus lord
---
ITT: People that have no clue what attrition means.
---
Blizzard having the original source code is not the "end all discussion" argument. A lot of the early development stuff was hard coded all over the place with very poor commenting - this was Blizzards own words when they explained why they couldn't increase amount of slots the standard bag holds. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the reference code is all over the place. Also remember they have the reference code but they have to build it on the updated legion engine so there's bound to be some mistakes (Hunter traps come to mind).
---
No because you replace set bonus items quickly.
---
No way in hell I'd give some random I met in game access to my account. Dudes probably playing the long game and trying to scam you. Next time he asks tell him to fuck off.
---
I'm a level 57 combat swords rogue and I'm going to stick with it till I get some gear, then respec to a pvp spec.  I don't find it to be all that boring.  Sure the rotations simple with S&amp;D and a few cooldowns, but it does well on damage meters and keeps me engaged.  It's not really only sinister strike anyways... there's riposte, garrote, blade flurry (2 min CD is quick), adrenaline rush, S&amp;D, evis, and if you're an orc like me there's blood fury.   Even for world pvp it does okay so long as you have all your cooldowns.  
---
I do agree it gets repetitive, but it's the same with most classes and looking forward to the next power spike and eventually respeccing to CB/prep or hemo build makes it fun for me.
---
Maybe it’s just nostalgia but the community for classic seems wildly different than the vanilla community to me.
---
Isn't this just any mage that runs a few dungeons during levelling?
---
I don't AOE grind dungeons cos I don't really enjoy it, but I still have 2/3 here. (not high enough for BRD yet).
---
I have no idea how you managed that.
---
Had 120g at 40 as well but like 80 of that came from the AH.
---
So as a priest you would roll against guildies for Staff of Dominance even though you'd replace it with Benediction down the line?
---
YEP!
---
bombing a military base very close to your main city which is full of active enemy soldiers and tanks. Oh the horror....
---
Truly the davinci of our time
---
If you want to have boring game it can be fairly fast, but really not that much faster
---
I'm going to start needing on anything blue and above to finance my mount. Hopefully this catches on so people will realize how shit this logic really is.
---
Thanks man! I did not find the book myself. One of my guildmates founf it in the western wing I believe. I'd recommend doing East if you wanna farm for it since that's by far the fastest one of them for getting tomes and quick bosses.
---
Feral BiS is Wolfshead, a crafted 40 blue - so if we're getting technical, "BiS logic" says Lycan should go to you.

Obviously, fuck that, roll need if you need.

my guildies play this game and only log on twice or three times a week. They olay the game but not nolifing it
---
warrior doesn't get to vanish,  therefore takes durability death one second after mage dies from tiger. Warrior is then corpse camped by the mage.
---
Depends on the time. Alliance are all over the place during prime time hours. I really only play nights and weekends and find a pretty healthy 50/50. 
---
Sometimes we’re holding down an instance entrance then enough allies show up to take over, or vice-versa. Have been having a blast here.
---
Rank 1 frostbolt is practically instant but applies the same slow effect as max rank, make sure you have it bound.  If they sprint, sheep them until it runs out, then reset.
---
Don't let your dreams be dreams. Classic is around for a while, not only do I believe you'll be epic'd out in a year, but I'm sure you'll have some sweet alts with sweet gear too.
---
Amazing
---
Yes, I should treat the people better that I was treating fine until one of them let out a string of filth 3 paragraphs long about pulling a single mob while one member of the group was still drinking. Yes. I should absolutely make a doormat of myself to appease somebody, like yourself, with absolutely no human decency. No concept that somebody isn't 100% perfect 100% of the time.
---
If you can't see your own hypocrisy in front of your face you're blind.
---
Should I also repeat the part where I myself am a Mana using main. A warlock. One that has to BOTH eat and drink between almost every pull. One that also gets annoyed when the tank doesn't let me eat or drink. 
---
You're saying I'm absolutely in the right to blast someone's ass to the Moon if they don't let me finish drinking one time? You need some serious introspection, man. I can't put it any more simply than that here, you are wrong, and at this point making a complete ass and joke out of yourself.
---
If you've been afk for a while you should have rested xp saved up. Should be able to hit 55-56 in a couple days and start BRD runs, then you'll be 58 and can start endgame.
---
That's if you're dreading questing/grinding mobs for the last 7 long levels.
---
Sure thing boss. I had no intention making friends saying what I had to say. Sorry idk what else to tell yah
---
I wonder if it occurred to him that nobody goes in to an instance unless they want something from there, or are helping friends?
---
If it's a PuG, expect someone to roll against everything you want.
---
Zoomers gonna zoom.
---
So I’ve found that if you’re two levels below the recommend level you can still heal a dungeon, as long as the group average is at least the dungeon average. 
---
For example ZF  recommended level range is 42-46. I started healing that dungeon at 40 but I made sure to group with enough people higher then me that our average level was at least 42. 
---
But from my personal experience the person who’s level is the most important is the tanks. So for ZF I probably wouldn’t join a group if the tank wasn’t at least 44.
---
That's not earth
---
Practice on your mount. You need to time your jumps while riding so that the mount makes no  noise.

Thank you for replying so swift!

Also curious about this. Related - does anyone have links to reading material on how to feral druid? I am level 43 now so starting to think towards understanding my class and spec more for endgame content :). Guides might be helpful, but something that actually explained the theory-crafting and such involved in figuring out what items are good would be better. Thanks for any help!
---
There is a level 45 priest in my guild who is still 20g gold away, it's kinda comical.. but he hit his enchanting profession hard since day one and now it's biting him in the ass.
---
I'm 41 and 11 gold away.
---
I agree that mage has an advantage over rogue in most cases, but this is some gross oversimplification. Mage vs Rogue is one of the most skill based matchups in the game, and perhaps also the most dynamic one of them all due to how many cooldowns each class has at their disposal.
---
In general, assuming skill and cooldown usage is equal, the mage has a clear advantage. The reason is that some spells, particularly Frost Nova, are so powerful against melee that they practically qualify as a cooldown in terms of impact on the fight. The rogue has to pop cooldowns to overcome the base kit of the mage, and essentially the longer the fight drags on, the worse his position gets. But at lower skill levels, rogues tend to flourish more for one, and I've seen plenty of mages lose despite no cooldown usage on the rogues part.
---
Your advice is more or less true. You need to try to re-apply slows as fast as possible. In that light, a pretty stereotypical mistake that many mages make is to go immediately Frost Nova &gt; Cone of Cold, which the rogue can just follow up with a Vanish/Improved Sprint while you have no ways to immediately slow him again. It's better to hold on to Cone of Cold until later. In general that's more or less the game you want to play. Just do whatever you can to re-slow him as fast as possible. But doing so is absolutely not straight-forward, given that both you and the rogue have so many ways to respond to any situation. I honestly question how much any textual explanation will help in this matchup, as it's heavily experience/intuition based.
---
It's waaaaaay too high
---
So if I do this on my warlock, the pots are essentially irrelevant right? Cause I could just use my VW and he could tank them and I'd run behind and grab the shard. Worse comes to worse I have to die and use ss but the mobs will path back to their original spots right?
---
How long does a run take you?
---
I made the mistake of flying to Astranaar from Winterspring... never again.
---
As a Druid, Mages are tasty treats. Can't wait for Phase 2.
---
I don’t give a fuck what you’re Bis is. Roll for it.
---
Mfw an undead warrior with skinning.
---
Thank you that makes sense, do you have any profession recommendations? Since I'm into pvp,all my characters will have engineering, and as of now, my rogue has mining, my priest has tailoring and I'm thinking of giving my paladin herbalism/engi and maybe swapping the priest to alch.
---
are you being dumb on purpose?
---
And specifically what point is that?
---
What is the script to turn off the grey death effect?
---
I’m literally watching maitoz stream it right now
---
r/iamverybadass
---
&gt;I am especially amused when folks are super hung up over BiS, but can't be bothered to enchant anything.
---
Until a couple days ago, you absolutely should not enchant most of your gear if you cared about your character being as good as you can.
---
no clue but thats wholly irrelevant to the fact that layering doesn't affect the server cap.  they've increased the server cap from vanilla either way at 1 layer or 10 (because it's the same at 1 or 10 LOL)
---
You're really shorting yourself with this technique. You would be more efficient being able to see most of your abilities and skill. Not just 4 or 5.
---
Not going to lie. I did this 😀
---
Are the bindings higher drop rate than before? I feel like I hear or see posts of them dropping more than in the past
---
No worries. Good luck in finding it! :D
---
This is how you get holy priests rolling on the +hit belt from arena over mages and warlocks.
---
This. Stacking world buffs allows warriors to push 1.5k consistent DPS by AQ. That means 20 warriors will deal 1.3 million damage in 45 seconds, making it very possible to kill the 2nd phase in only one cycle. And phase 1 wasn't a problem [even prenerf](http://www.lurkerlounge.com/forums/printthread.php?tid=4495).
---
And even if all else fails, tryhards could just cheese it with light of elune to demonstrate that it's possible.
---
Thanks! I NEED IT xD
---
Gen Z - "Zoomer" - Born in the age of the internet, where everything is instant.
---
I completely made this up, but it sounds like it fits.
---
Sorry for your loss.  WoW community works in mysterious ways.  Light be with you, friend.
---
I don't understand it either; I have been leveling my warrior and have had no more difficult of a time than I have with any other class. And I'm not even looking up talent or gear guides. 
---
I think people just like to overstate how hard some things in classic are because hard=good to them
---
I came here to reddit to find a guild, primarily. I made that clear in the first post and this post. Yes I also asked how to get in on the deeper RP action, but that was after being sucked into the comment section and MAYBE cus since my recruitment question had been evaded that it confused me or something. Anyways, from initial post there was emphasis on the guilds as you know now, specifically asking for recruitment. That is the truth ok, it was the only question I asked in the initial post and if I had deleted the post before out discussion here I swear I could screenshot it to lol. Anyways, Y'all should have also known(just cus) that I already knew how to join a server and to create a backstory.
---
 In your very first sentence you say that y'all are not on my case about whether or not I make a back story...its the wrong tense right? Y'all are NO LONGER on my case. You said "We're not...," well it's "We're NO LONGER." For what that is worth, I threw it in here lol, just straightens this little situation out that much more dont it xD
---
How to kill your own thread 101.
---
Its a joke.
---
What I'd do is talk it over in your guild.
---
Given what you've said, this is what I'd suggest.
---
Tanks sort out all tanking gear between themselves.
---
After that, it's all on /roll ... because it might not be optimal, but it's simple and it's fair.
---
Dropped 1st run for me lol
---
I don't even know how most people that spam that shit in twitch chat or wow actually function as normal human beings.
---
Every female Troll player uses the same face, the most "pretty" one
---
Haha then you'll realize how grueling being a tank is, I did, now leveling a lock.
---
I have been very lucky!
---
Raid with 30 good players from you’re guild. If you don’t really have experienced LC it can really turn away members if done incorrectly. I personally liked utilizing a decaying DKP loot style. I am not a GM just a prior raider. It just feels really bad for raiders when attending a raid when going in you know there is zero chance of even receiving loot.
---
Free transfers caused this. Nobody is likely to transfer back. Blizz fkd it up already
---
It also has less problems in certain areas. I.e. way more affordable trade goods and better availability most of the time, more consistent markets, better faction balance. It also has nice perks like more community events (i.e. PvP tournaments) and more guild options.
---
You misunderstand though. This was in response to people asking for more layers (increased server cap) to reduce queues, but Blizzard responded they didn’t want to increase the cap ”further” [than they had already done]. 
---
The Bluepost does not contradict my point, it supports it 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Protip make friends and play with them
---
That the items are worth it for those people....
---
I'm happy to get to the bottom of this with you really. Like I said probs a misunderstanding at the core. I can continue to explain myself as best I can.
---
MEthod themselves had a stream titled 'race to world first MC'. Dick riding, LMAO. I dont think i ever even mentioned apes before these comments.
---
ya - pm me your battletag
---
we only have YOUR recounting of what happened. why should we accept this at face value?
---
"i treated them like gold but they bent me over boo hoo"
---
what happens when i get the tale from the other people and they say, "we were oom every god damn pull, he refused to CC just wanted to aoe tank everything to appease his dick-meter. rushed us through the whole instance. pulled packs right as buffs fell off. pulled packs right as we rebuffed and had no mana. and then finally when we couldn't take it anymore at the boss when he charged in right as we just sat down to drink we put our foot down, fuck this guy. just because it's hard to get a tank doesn't mean we have to put up with RETAIL BULLSHIT. we'll wait for a real tank and this clown can go disappoint another group"
---
who do i believe?
---
Oh shoot I thought it was for Gen Z people who acted like Boomers, so Boomers with a Z.
---
have sex

Not really. I only have lvl 1 still and I'm lvl 51

By the time the "feral druid" is level 45 to roll on embrace of the lycan, should already be wearing for FIVE levels the  [Wolfshead Helm](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=8345/wolfshead-helm) . **Period**. 
---
Its a 3-4g mats head (way less if skinner too) that is bis from 40 to TBC \^.
---
This comes from a druid that couldnt wait reach 40 for wolfshead and 5/5 furor powershift even as tank :p.
---
What’re the perks of engineering while leveling as a Rogue? Are there any items that enhance the experience, or is it mainly just for PvP at end game?
---
You sound like a really nice person. I'm sure you have all of your own affairs in order and many are proud to call upon you for help. I'm sure you have a rewarding life and fascinating stories to tell.
---
Ambush for the opener and keep s&amp;d up
---
How to fairly distribute? ms&gt;os&gt;pvp
---
Whatever your main spec is going into the raid gets priority to roll need on any item that would be bis for that.
---
If everyone who is main spec has it offspec get a chance and everyone who is offspec, those who need to fornpvp get a chance  and the last choice would be vendor.
---
Being I'm a guide or being popular doesn't make it correct. Most guides also say Dalrends is pre-raid BiS and lots of hunters blindly follow it, doesn't mean they're right.
---
The same type of person that throws out personal insults is the same type of person that wont let facts change their bias. Goodluck with this approach to life bro, it ain't getting you anywhere.
---
when you leave the station people like to gang up on the other faction on PvP servers if theres a good gap in group size/level
---
Faerlina has the healthiest population of any US server with the best faction balance of any PvP server. The "Wah streamers" crowd just likes to bash Faerlina to feel better about their garbage server.
---
Do you know why he suggests improved eviscerate over poisons? I feel like most of the time I've got combo points in combat it's going toward kidney shot or slice and dice in pve

You can turn off chat invites in the setting so you don’t get that spam

Ah yes, that feeling when this happens and your staring at your dead party after a wipe before anyone says anything. Usually a highlight of my night.
---
Make your own blacklist and share it with people you trust. A public list would get abused. And Blizz sure as fuck isn't going to make an automated system because it's too much of a hassle for no real reason.
---
Yup. Though I still call it a ban. It is actually a suspension. But I definitely agree with making a macro to help speed things along for you.
---
I am playing now. :D
---
The idea of a devilsaur Mafia is really cool and totally above board in a game where you need to fight for limited resources. Pay up or shut up my man.
---
I’m struggling with my Warrior a bit. I’m level 43 now and love the aesthetic of plate and an armor clad melee brute, but I find some of the gameplay a little unrewarding and have been hearing about how being a warrior at 60 is sort of a nightmare.
---
I’m thinking of rerolling, and have been pondering about going Warlock. I want to be able to do damage and to be able to quest fairly easily. Is a Warlock at 60 fun? Are the early Warlock tiersets neat aesthetically, on orc dudes at least?
---
Thanks guys!
---
Yes we moved on from that to *why* so many people considered them "worth it" and how they were, largely, mistaken about that worth.
---
Just because lots of people overpay for something doesn't make it objectively worth that much in any sense other than a literal "worth what someone will pay" sense.
---
Where did I say "don't use CC"? Where did I say "let the clothies tank"? If you're not using CC and clothies are tanking and people are dying, you're pulling too much for your group to handle.
---
Drinking to full takes 10-15s max. Sit your ass down as soon as combat ends while your group is looting. If your tank has full HP as he should, he's in no danger of dying on pull. You wouldn't heal immediately on pull anyway unless you want to get swarmed.
---
My point stands; pull as much as you can with no deaths, full HP at the end of combat, and using all of your healer's mana. Anything less is inefficient gameplay for farmed content.
---
Get into sm groups and heal (even as shadow) that should get you enough gold by 40 for your mount and then some.
---
I cant imagine why would hear that so often... *shrugs*
---
Careful tho rank 1 fireball DoT only lasts for 4 seconds, so they can still vanish pretty quickly. If you can get a higher rank on them right after it's good because they can't vanish for a while and you can just easily kite and kill. 
---
Rank 1 frostbolts are great for when people try to run away. Not only do they slow but they can also proc frostbite (freeze for 3 sec), so basically rogues and warriors especially have a very hard time escaping, much less even attempting to touch you.
---
How is taking gear that's still good for you while not the best being translated into being retarded? A healer taking spell damage gear is retarded. Doesn't apply. A rogue taking a weapon with Str that isnt his BiS, but is MUCH better than his green wep, is perfectly fine.
---
I started a week late and my friend group was already playing there because one of them had aspirations of being streamer and he convinced everyone else to follow him. After about 2 weeks of queues and shitty groups with kids trying to emulate their favorite streamer we decided to reroll. Already 60 somewhere else in a great guild of people more my speed.
---
If you wanted free water you should've rolled a mage. Nothing wrong with a mage charging for their time.
---
Ahh ok I didn't know you hit 60. I've heard of aoe farming BRD, ZF, and SM cath but I usually farm gold out in the world.
---
Definitely not. If you yell at one end of the Barrens no way in hell you gonna see that. It's a limited range
---
honestly you gotta be kinda stupid if you didn't realize that it was a joke....
---
Your're
---
With good reason. What does crit do? It makes your healing spells heal for double the amount some of the times, and it regenerates your mana.
---
In the current content you never run out of mana, so that part is irrelevant. Crit heals also means you introduce RNG into your heals. You always have to assume your heal will not crit when you select a rank to heal someone with, because if you rely on critting then people will die.
---
Bonus healing on a Paladin is flat out better as its just more reliable. Pieces with crit also typically have a much lower bonus heal, which means you cannot downrank as efficiently and you dont even save that much mana in the grand scheme of things even if saving mana was necessary.
---
further than they'd already done because they increased the server cap significantly from vanilla.  not with layers in general, layers don't affect server cap.
---
Honestly dude idk what to tell you if you're still confused.  we had 20+ layers on release but still queue times lol.  20+layers would accomodate tens of thousands of players and yet blizzard is worried about 10k.  
---
You're oblivious if you can't see that at this point nothing will convince you.
---
I hear you, but I think the judgment on that guy depends on the manner in which they leave. If they leave suddenly right after they win a boss drop, then fuck them. If they are friendly throughout the run and are apologetic about having to leave, then fine, we'll manage.
---
Right?  It's up to them to decide if they want to pass because its minor to them.
---
I lost the roll on Ravager.  And the roll on the hammer in Ulda.  And every other 2h.  Including the ZF staff while I was healing ZF.
---
As far as leveling spec, enh is best until 40, then after 40 if you have caster mail ele is best because of the mana/damage efficiency.(shammys still hit things with windfury/rockbiter regardless of spec either way though - 1h weapons become a thing with ele though)  I haven't swapped my shammy to ele mostly due to not having enough decent caster mail yet.
---
Ironya's Bludgeon. From Ulda, I used till 60 lol. Maybe somebody else has a better suggestion.
---
Had to change my mentality playing now caused i'm burnt out.  
---
Instead of focusing on leveling, I focus on objectives.  
---
I want to do X number of quests.  
---
I want to do X dungeon today.  
---
I want to use up my rested bonus exp.  
---
etc  
---
Much better now. I level slower for sure, but the time not playing means rested bonus exp, so that makes leveling during my session faster.
---
Believe who you want mate. I was the one moving on to a better group.
---
Terrible item unless you are tryharding dungeon bosses which are not hard to kill anyways or you are lvl 60 and raiding.
---
Holy fuck. I just saw it. What server you on I'm switching :)
---
&gt; In your very first sentence of ur most recent comment you say that y'all are not on my case about whether or not I make a back story...its the wrong tense right? Y'all are NO LONGER on my case. &gt; You said "We're not...," well it's "We're NO LONGER." For what that is worth, I threw it in here lol, just straightens this little situation out that much more dont it xD
---
Jesus fucking christ man...
---
Ur goal was to reach 60, yeah? Nothing else interested u? OK bye, ur down with the game.
---
Can I heal SM at 30? I thought I needed to be higher for that. And do I just run and vendor or what?
---
If you’re willing to drop enchanting you may wanna consider a gathering profession (skinning,mining,herb). Make sure to only buy necessary skills. Consider fishing; while it’s boring; some fish are worth a good amount. Once you get to mid/high 30’s check out elementals in arathi, specifically the water ones near hammerfall
---
Two thumbs up
---
^ How to disband your guild in 1 night.
---
Gives me something to do in the downtime between pulls and I gotta pay for those repairs somehow.
---
I'll try this. Thanks.
---
Fem trolls only have 1 usable face so it's just a matter of the hair styles
---
So you'd rather not have tanks? I'm confused.
---
Well looks like I was wrong. Thanks for pointing that out.
---
Assuming hunter and not lock dont they have eyes of the beast or something that allows this?
---
Well with PvP you typically want large burst for classes that try to escape like mage. Sometimes you will have crippling up on the mage and his blink is down. Instead of backstabbing or wasting kidney (likely because he will just block) you throw a cold blood evis into him to apply pressure. The added evis damage provides necessary burst to force him to pop a defensive cooldown. When you are fighting a mage you always want them within 1 shot range. I'm not sure about PvE tho as his builds are entirely built around pvp. I will say that poisons are not great in PvE as most things in MC resist them anyways and you don't want to take a debuff slot up with deadly poison.
---
the other person keeps getting confused apparently. so that's what they are doing but i guess it's taking them time to explain it to the random.
---
Just some bad luck with all the steamer wannabes, tourist season is winding down and it should be better soon
---
Yea, the guy who showed it to me blew my mind.
---
what's the quest about, and what do you get?
---
I noticed this. I was making good money selling it for 4.50g but after dm I see people selling felcloth for 3g... Wtf
---
Womp womp
---
And happy cake day!
---
Welcome to the classic/vanilla experience...
---
Lol. But seriously the only reason this is still happening now is because people still have that same mind set. That's about it. Has nothing to do solely with the game. It's just people being people.
---
You basically have a threat set if gear and a mitigation set of gear and swap between them based on the content. I mostly use threat armor for tanking with mitigation trinkets. Main difference between cat and bear is the helm most of the time and the trinkets/rings.
---
I went fury around level 41 and never looked back. Despite what the theory tells me it just works better for me. It feels more engaging than waiting for an overpower proc. 
---
Now I'm 56 and with decent gear I do very well I'm dungeons regardless if I'm doing damage or tanking. 
---
I tried to go back to two handed arms when I got a nice drop but its just too boring for me.
---
I've got fishing up to 62. I guess I can keep going. Any specific fish to target? I don't want to drop enchanting because I have it at 117 already and I don't want to re level that.
---
Lol.  I hope not.  I used to play a druid back on live and tanked all the way through BC.  The tank I'm rolling is gonna be a druid so I can always tank for gear and then go cat for pvp.
---
Originally my alt was gonna be a hunter but I just can't imagine waiting for groups again at 60 when I could more or less instantly get a group on my server as a tank.  Thankfully just about anything aside from warrior is easier to level then a rogue so that is gonna be nice.
---
yeah I know that and it's basic. but since 40 people are coming, I want to take into account favoring players who have good attendance and performance during fights. People who come every single raid and help the guild the most. Shouldn't I favor them at times? roll for most things but some items I want to give them first dibs. instead of the new guildy who just joined.
---
Boar is pretty good cause of charge and eating anything.
---
But I liked Cat the best. Check petopia and get a 1.2 or lower attack speed cat. They'll have bite and claw for extra damage and the attack speed will help trigger more Frenzy for more dmg.
---
Also gets dash. Later on you'll probably want a cat for pvp vs casters anyway.
---
Only roll druid if you don't mind healing. That goes for both PvP and PvE. It's a class with an extremely high skill ceiling and isn't as bad as people say.
---
Hunter is very strong early, but you'll find that it scales poorly. If you are competitive person that might be frustrating down the road.
---
Mage is arguably the most broken class in the game. If you're into PvP it's very powerful and there's a lot to it. If you're more into raiding you might find the rotation too simple and boring.
---
Warlock will always perform a little worse than mage in raid, but it's also extremely strong in PvP in a very different way. It's much less cool down based and super strong in duels.
---
I'd say go with whichever faction you prefer, but if you choose caster go undead or gnome.
---
I'd say play whatever server you have friends on. If you have no friends playing, Faerlina will have a population long after most servers do not.
---
It’s actually r/woooosh with 4 o’s
---
i treat people as good as they deserve
---
you roll in with no proof and all of my experience tells me it's the tanks who fuck people over not the healers
---
so yeah. i'd put money on you being the offending party in this 
---
&lt;shrug&gt;
---
Lol right? Everyone tries to distance themselves from the streamer community and yet they still embody the worst parts of it.
---
I’ve had some great experiences in dungeons and group quests. Granted my highest toon is only 36 at the moment but most people have been fair and considerate.
---
fun fact im very close to cooking lake its a nice place
---
So the answer is no, then?
---
Lmao at all this text when literally all you need to do is get skinning and vendor the stuff that doesnt sell.
---
Many if not most leveling rogues are Combat without Improved Sprint, so if you slow them and kite there's basically nothing they can do.
---
After getting tired of this they go spend the money on a respec to get Improved Sprint.
---
Fully expected you to get one shot by a river croc at the end.
---
You can heal GY easy, and should be able to heal Lib if you stand back so you don't pull.
---
Boy I can’t wait for TBC.
---
"too young"
---
And interrupt bandage.
---
To healers what matters most is health pool anyway. What proportion of a health bar is got at a time is way more critical than the raw number of hp removed. Patchwerk is a great example of this.
---
He literally said in an earlier comment to use screenshots to prove collusion. The only thing the ‘mafia’ does that’s actually against TOS is communicating with the enemy faction, which cannot be proven by blizzard since it happens over discord. 
---
Again, I ask how you would prove it’s cross faction collusion and not just people pvping.
---
Are pallys viable at PvP at 60?  Im pretty sure I read quite a bit of stuff that said they're underwhelming all around at 60.  Versitile, but underwhelming
---
Go outside.
---
Cata maybe, mop there was less then wod there was none.
---
Something I’ve found this time around that’s incredibly valuable are very low level greens—like sub-level 10 greens from starting zones. Weapons can go for 1-2g a piece, while most other pieces can go for 40-50s. I’m assuming this is to power level alts with enchanting.
---
My strategy so far is to check the AH, if the piece is on there for a small amount, hold, and when you’re the only one with the item, post it for 50-60s for standard pieces or 1g for weapons. 
---
I just deleted my main and faction swapped and I’ve already got 20g on my level 12 rogue doing this.
---
On the vendor bit, unless disenchanting is more profitable. Other than that I concur.
---
He’s just messing around.  If a warrior tries this, they die instantly when then 2nd tiger merely looks at them
---

Exactly this
---
8 ticks per cast at 4% is 32, times 3 mobs is 96%
---
"how is that different" lol
---
I was once in a guild that used LC in which the GM had no say in the LC's decisions.
---
He took care of preparations and leading the raid, and gave loot headache to 3 officers instead (25man raids).
---
It worked just fine. We raided for +8 months till server felt too dead to continue.
---
Great way to get your account banned. He's got nothing to lose and you have your account to lose.
---
I do try to not go for mobs higher level than myself and I am a human using swords exclusively.
---
There is no unknown left so people see others as an ends to a means. Back in the day you never knew what you may need somebody for in the future so people stayed on best behavior. Just my 2 cents.
---
Fair enough. Most healers would be ecstatic to get free water so you're a star for doing that.
---
After reading John Staats' "Wow Diary"  the only thing I learned was:
---
**NEVER MAKE AN MMO**
---
Deviate fish from the oasis’ in the barrens, Firefin, oily blackmouth. Once you hit 205 I think you can go to feralas or Tanaris and catch Stonescale eel or winter squid. On Sulfuras NA eels are like ~13s ea and winter squid are around ~30s ea
---
It's very possible about maradaun level, get the thrash blade eand the other sword from completing mara, then get the Blackstone ring off princess and then the brd quest in the cave in burning steppes for the 2 hit leather shoulders, its a good starting point to have enough hit where its noticeable.  Also knowing the heroic strike que feature will help with your off hand miss rate.
---
I met one guy who admitted to RMT over voice channels but he explained it quite simply. He hated farming for good but loved investing in AH supply and demand, and wanted seed money. 
---
He was also loaded and unemployed for years in the 2000s. He sold a duping cheat trick to an early RMT site for Everquest for a couple million.
---
That's fine for your guild but most people reading this aren't going to be in your guild or in a real guild.
---
&gt;so Boomers with a Z.
---
Wouldn't that be Boomerz?
---
OMG this would be the perfect solution!  As my fishing toon is a druid with entangle!
---
Can't wait to try it!  &gt;:-D
---
Yeah you can milk anything with nipples. What is this? the jerusale tulip oh that’s right, you don’t know shit about flowers.

Well its one of the top 3 items for healing priests, because there arent really any belts with +healing on them available. Priests should still step the fuck off unless they're shadow, specifically because its BiS for mages and warlocks.  There are extremely few ways of getting spell hit, not because its bad for healing.

So I e been to Gan’rul blood eye. That’s the guy I’m supposed to speak to to start the quest - and he offers me nothing. Not even a chat bubble for dialogue. He just does nothing for me

Care to explain? I know all my abilities and their respective keybinds. I do have some weakauras for pot and sapper cd etc, but apart from that I have all information I need to be efficient. (99 logs on every mc boss and ony)

Well, it might be annoying a bit.

But sure like hell it is right when i think about the hunter that wanted my amulet of evasion because it had a drop of agility into it.

I think that's a good idea. I choose the LC and they decide. Genius. Thankyou, I might just do this. Need to find good LCs though. Knowledgeable and fair LCs.

This is terrible advice for any guild and wouldn’t recommend it at all.

As a healer I can understand this.  The new Walter White Water will help with that downtime ;)

Mine was layered during the day today

I can tell you right now, you will go mad if you do not have able bodied, available capable officers to assist. 
---
1. Decide the route you want to go, dip and its variants,LC rolls, etc
---
2. Assign your officers that will be assisting you with all of the info and things you want done
---
3. Raid, prosper and build a healthy community.

I did a 4 hour Mara run earlier today that had people’s AC failing, a coffee machine exploding, and someone having to leave to go to work. Despite these issues, it was one of the best runs to date. There are good people out there. Stay positive
