thats wrong. warlocks hellfire does more dps than blizzard, and its more mana efficient. Good locks sacrifice a voidwalker, wait for nova and stand just outside of melee reach and hellfire. the best aoe setup that doesnt use a tank is 3 mages, 1 priest and 1 warlock. 
---

---
That way you have portals and summon back for repair and vendoring, wipe protection, eye of kilrog for pulling and healthstones.
---
if you didnt know, warlocks can summon themselves, get ported/hs and accept the summon back.
---
---
---
I used to really enjoy Asmongold’s tutorial videos back in the day. I even went to a few of his events he did trying to help people get the moose mount etc. 
---
  
---
I see he gets a lot of hate now for being toxic. Which is a shame because he seemed to be a decent chill dude back when I followed him.
---
You mean me? I don't watch any streamers.
---
So, after going through the comments, do you even need devilsaur? I mean, if you are combat and have a wep skill of 305, the hit you need for yellow attacks not to miss is 6% because you get a technical 3% bonus chance to hit. Now, That would mean that Blackcrow and Blackstone ring would be enough to overcome the 6% cap you need. Doesn't that mean you can effectively have less hit gear and more AP/Stam gear alongside your 6 piece Shadowfang?
---
I can understand and respect that.
---
I believe the key phrase is "be the change you want to see."
---
My rotation atm is
---
Mind blast~SWPain~Mind Flay~Fear~Mind Flay~Mind Blast
---
I'll PWS if I pull more than one mob and SWP them both but carry out my normal rotation on one until dead then repeat for second more or less.
---
My mana normally sits around half while grinding. If it starts to drop too low, I'll throw a vampyirc embrace on the next couple of pulls for some hp regen while I face tank and wand the last half of HP to let mana regen.
---
Yeah I didnt get to experience vanilla when it was vanilla and started Early TBC but was very young so this time around I felt like actually experiencing the world and seeing how vanilla actually was with questing and not sitting in SM from 30-40 and then moving to the next dungeon to farm whilst skipping tons of zones for questing.
---
&gt; Quest rewards are good for leveling l. Don’t worry, I also see how that’s a catch-22 as you can say that the DPS can forgo the upgrade and use quest items.
---
Exactly. That destroys your whole argument.
---
&gt; But it becomes more of a courtesy and reward for improving their performance in the group. Which is what the point of an mmo is, right?
---
The whole point of an MMO is not for there to be a totally one-sided "courtesy" or "reward" system where only DPS toons get courtesy and rewards.
---
&gt; There can be specific group rules which is fine,but to me, in an mmorpg, people should be rewarded for their roles in the group.
---
You can think whatever you like. If your argument makes no sense though, we do not have to agree with what you think.
---
Hey man should add server name so we can ignore this piece of shit
---
lol no
---
Pro tip when getting camped, go ahead and spawn at that gy right next to bb next time and save yourself a lot of time when your only goal was to make it to bb the rez sickness worth it.
---
Great write up though.  Enjoyed the read.
---
That’s a hell of a weak reply. You’re referring to an officer in the guys’ guild ninja looting while at the same time people talk about Asmon being away at Twitchcon. I failed to see the relevance in naming him at all. Good steamer or bad streamer - that’s completely up to you. But it’s silly to objectively say he’s a failed streamer. I used to think he was a decent streamer up until a few months back, but I find him annoying mainly for the reason I mentioned when talking to the other guy. And I know you know what that reason is as you read it.  
---
Be honest, do you jack off when you read posts hating on the guy?
---
I once gave a guy 5g for repair before a mara run since he claimed to be all red with plate and couldn't afford. Idk what thst'd codt so I gave him the 5g and it was agreed he'd pass on something good.
---
Of course he ends up needing on two 4.5 vend weapons (cant recall if boe or bop) and a party member claimed his original weapon was actually better than both of the weapons he took. The first time it was really dumb because he asked if the drop was better than his existing *after* needing it.
---
Im a Mage I dont buy water. I use the shitty water I can make.
---
no, i’m a Horde Warlock. it’s just my experience. i can’t tell you with certainty that the server is even. but it’s not disproportionate to the point that it affects your ability to quest.
---
I don't really think anything before BRD hits hard enough for it to matter.
---
Correction then: I'll never understand blindly rushing to the defense of a streamer you've never watched
---
&gt;If he/anyone else doesn't want to be viewed with that kind of arm-chair psychology perhaps they shouldn't be such an obvious dick. The observation IS accurate, but no one is trying to proclaim they're a professional capable of accurately diagnosing. It's fucking Reddit. ***Woof***.
---
So are you basically telling me hyperbole does not exist on Reddit and  there is no such thing as over exaggeration because OBVIOUSLY they're don't really mean what they're saying? Also no, the observation is absolutely not accurate, I honestly have no idea how you can call a statement both "arm chair psychology" and accurate in the same comment. Lets remember for a second that sociopathy and narcissistic personality disorder are **psychiatric conditions that people actually suffer from** and extending the label and definition to literally every person you perceived to be a dick does a disservice to those with said conditions, and they're loved ones who also struggle with them.
---
 Honestly, I find it very strange that you felt the need to swoop into the defense of someone who was so obviously painfully exaggerating. The only real reason I can think of is you want to be able to refer to anyone who does something morally wrong on the internet as a sociopath to serve as a punishment for whatever they did. What you basically said is a random guy on the internet can say whatever the fuck he wants, can use a very real psychiatric condition to negatively depict someone he doesn't like, and no one can say fuck all about it because I guess we just shouldn't take what he says seriously. 
---
**WOOF**
---
Bullied, or purged from our sacred forests?

I play PVE :) couldnt be bothered with fighting people who would be better at pvp than me when I have zero interest in world pvp anyway. I'll stick to BG's when they are released.
---
Same.
---
I rolled a warrior and I'm leveling it this time as tanking only, with all my xp coming from dungeons so I learn and get better at it.I'll always have a group for dungeons if I feel like running dungeons.
---
I did VC with 2 lock, a mage, a priest, and a rogue. the mage and rogue were 26,27 so were doing tons of damage. but me and the other lock did sufficient tanking with our voidwalkers. managed to get the priest their shirt, staff, and wand all in one run so we were happy.
---
:(

This is the OP adding other toons they met on their server. You're thinking [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) friends.

rekt
---
#1 Tell your Enh Shaman to reroll resto or ele and stop earth shocking like a scrub. 
---
#2 Tell your healer to stop healing the Enh Shaman if they pull aggro by earth shock or wind fury.
---
Oh good grief, aren't you ignorant, arrogant, and to top it off, dumb.
---
1. BoP's exist so you cannot sell EVERY SINGLE PIECE of equipment to everyone, meaning, people should play the content to gear up to play content. It is how you stay in the fucking game.
---
2. BoE's exist so you can decide whether you wanna sell them or use them.
---
The fact that BoP's exist doesn't mean EVERY SINGLE BoE's that drops, is immediately for selling. If that was the case:
---
1. No one would use them, because everyone would just try to sell them for more money.
---
2. There would be no, get this, NEED or GREED rolls.
---
You are one demented dumbass.
---
Yeah exactly. It just makes the whole world feel more like a world. Unlike in retail, where most of the quests ask you to get a very specific thing and the NPC that has it is very conveniently right around the corner and the guy that you have to bring it to afterwards who is a super specialist in these kinds of things and the only person that can make sense of the item is also very conveniently just over the next hill over there.
---
well we disagree. very VERY few people level as healers or tanks exclusively. if you are in  a RANDOM pug without reserves, anyone can roll on anything they can use and is an upgrade. if the warrior threw on a shield to join a pug, telling him he can't roll on Ravager cause at that exact moment he has a shield on is ludicrous. same idea applies in every case.
---
Hunters and huntards are two very different things
---
Nothing will happen, that dude made 420 gold EZ
---
I really really want to play a hunter. But I'm also really worried that because people talk about how crap their damage is in later raids that I won't be able to find a raid spot.  Can anyone help alleviate this feeling?
---
&gt;*So are you basically telling me hyperbole does not exist on Reddit*
---
Save your breath and time. You're on Reddit. If hyperbole is something you're looking to avoid you should avoid the website entirely. Actively pointing out when people are hyperbolic is akin to actively pointing out people are posting. 
---
It's fucking Reddit.
---
Go play bfa with that mentality LOL. Why do you think people came back to calssic? To have the game changed? Gtfo kid.
---
Are you retarded? Just wondering I'd hate to offend someone with half a brain. Anyway this has nothing to do with the N word... you freaked out like a pansy cause they called you dad. I think you need to straighten your shit out when you cant figure out your own deleted posts.
---
[deleted]
---
Is there a rogue build that focuses on backstabbing. I am only going to be playing in a group with a tank, so I should always be able to backstab.
---
Nice attempt at personally blacklisting a word. I'm sure you could put a little bit more effort in to assessing someone beyond them saying buddy.
---
its funny cuz its true, this guy thinks i'm soo sensitive, ooo wait for the repplies and we'll see who's sensitive.
---
So.. classic means to be a rude person, and worse, a liar?  So like if I agree to enchant something for you and I run away with the mats that's ok right?  Welcome to classic bitch.
---
It's not even that much. I mean sure, 400g seems like a lot, but at a conservative 30g/hr, that's ~13 hours. Throwing away a long-term relationship for 13 hours of gold lol.

no i called players who  consistently have  a group of friends  your level to play with a niche part of  the community.
---
I didn’t claim to be a know it all - I even included a caveat to make clear I didn’t know it all 🤦‍♂️
---
A lower levelled character with stuff bought by the more powerful character, nothing to do with “twinks”
---
Okay. 
---
Not that it needs changing anyway, it isn’t derogatory to reference twink/bear culture? It’s not a negative reference at all.
---
The ones that made themselves guildless. Off the top of my head, log in to Ashbringer EU, horde side. Page anyone from the guild Reminiscence and ask what has happened to Blaze. Perhaps you wanna check Oguz as well while you are at it.
---
&gt;Be honest, do you jack off when you read posts hating on the guy?
---
Yes.
---
I stroke even harder when his submissives start flailing around in reddit comments to defend him.
---
I take it you donated quite a bit of gold to him. I hope he at least said your name.
---
At what point was I blindly rushing to anyones defense? Someone called a streamer "failed", it was pointed out they very much are not and are quite successful, I mentioned the usual rationale behind such comments.
---
Personally when I don't like a content creator I just don't watch their stuff, I don't see why people go on these crusades online against them. Just me though.
---
Says the dip shit willfully interacting with me
---
I’m 38, haven’t grinded, did 2 dungeons, and still haven’t been to Stranglethorn yet.
---
That is what i did and i would say what most people advise to do. I would probably do the same if i had to level a paladin again
---
Just remember you might not tank 100% mobs from start to finish, but that's fine. Low level tanking is kinda hard anyways so dont sweat it too much
---
My rotation is PWS, Holy Shock, SWP, MB, MFx2, MB and then wand the rest. Usually spend 50% of my mana but Spirit Tap gets me up to 80-90% by the time I'm casting MB the first time in the next rotation. If the mobs cast on me I don't use MF and just wand them down.
---
No, no, it's for the question you asked, he just threw in some Seal of Command stuff in there as well.
---
What he's saying is that you should never use crusader as your damage seal past like... level 18/20, and you shouldn't judge seal of the crusader on an enemy to increase your damage done to it, UNLESS that mob is going to take more than 20-30 seconds to kill, which is generally only going to be elite mobs that take that long to down.
---
So in most instances it's best to just use Seal of Righteousness as your damage seal, and in most instances its better to open with a judgement of righteousness rather than a judgement of the crusader. 
---
Again, because the DPS gain you get from having Crusader judged on an enemy is not worth the mana/downtime when you could just open with a Rightousness judgement and continue smacking the mob with Seal of Righteousness on.
---
Now, if judgement of the crusader actually worked the way it says it works (or is it Retribution Aura that doesn't work the way it says it works...) then I would say always judge crusader and always have retribution aura up, unfortunately, however, judgement of crusader does not increase the damage of retribution aura, even though it definitely seems like it should from the tooltip.
---
i cant believe i bothered to read this shit
---
Is...it any better to suggest the other warriors who were invited should be shamed into filling the role?
---
I mean, seriously. I get it. But the answer being: Not me them, and Them saying Not me them and then coming on here to complain about they said me not them is weird.
---
Nobody wins this.
---
What level do you unlock dungeon finder
---
Asmongold has said its okay to ninja from non-guildies, so unless Blizzard does something he is fine.
---
Are you... Being sensible on the internet?  Was the pitch fork store out of pitch forks?
---
Flare the group before pulling, it still applies. Flare doesnt make them run to you
---
Nah they just have a developer that actually cares about their game enough to moderate the community unlike Eve that simply panders to whales.
---
So we can expect him to kick this guy then, right?
---
&gt; Someone called a streamer "failed", it was pointed out they very much are not and are quite successful
---
Okay?  And what do you know about how successful they are if you never watch them?
---
He can have a million viewers, but if he's using all that exposure to actively make the community toxic, he'll still be a loser.
---
" Now if it was alliance farming there and another ally would show up to which the horde would only camp that new ally player then yeah, that's fucked. "
---
Pretty much the second part. Alliance A farmed and when a new Alliance B showed up the horde camped B until he left.
---
Well to be fair not bad for nightfall melee hunter for raids.
---
He was referring to Hearthstone, where swipe is a pretty effective AoE.
---
who cares what people think? 40 man raids are so lenient it's almost funny. People cleared BWL with 5 people back in actual vanilla, the raid group can afford to have a few off-meta specs for sure \[except maybe fire mages :P\] but that's not even mentioning the fact that hunters are fine in raids, and in fact needed for tranquilizer in MC iirc. \[this is just based on my metaknowledge from watching lots of videos\]. Play what you enjoy and worry about grouping later. Raid groups will always be looking for more people :)
---
Yep!
---
Yup. There's a difference between required and willful interaction
---
only pussies delete their reddit posts, like you.
---
what does ss mean? im a rogue main but am new to WoW
---
This nerd spouting about social Dynamics and he can't even go outside without having crippling anxiety
---
LOL stay mad!
---
no one said I freaked out cuz anyone called me dad? that's your own assumptions ya freak.
---
Alright then don't use those fucking words. They're real psychiatric conditions and you don't just get to throw them at people to shame them. People suffer from this shit you fucking muppet, you don't just get to label people you don't like with neurological/psychiatric disorders. It's a disservice to those who suffer from it, and it undermines your own fucking point because to say someone suffer from sociopathy and narcissistic personality disorder implies they effectively didn't have a whole lot of choice in the matter. The difference between a sociopath and an asshole is one fucking has nothing wrong with him and CHOOSES to be a dickhead. They are not interchangeable and being on the internet does excuse anyone from using a medical condition  to shit on someone.
---
Once 90% of your freinds roll greed at the behest of your very well trusted leader, I bet you'll change you're mind on hitting need
---
You think I defend him, you get hard. I talk about what stopped me watching the guy and what I don’t like, you get hard. You ignore what I said and repeat yourself because you have nothing else to say. 
---
You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it think.
---
You could say the same thing about a lot of crimes, but the majority of criminals aren't sociopaths. 
---
The world isn't split into sociopaths and good people.
---
Birds of a shitty feather
---
What? Okay you are fucking retarded. I'm going to ignore you now before your remaining half of brain caves in.
---
Ozzy stated he didn't want the helm. The other paladin was reinvited almost immediately.
---
My friend got banned for this in Wotlk.
---
He made an Icc 25 hc run and at the start said that nothings reserved, Dbw dropped and he couldnt resist.
---
He had it for like an hour before a 24 hour suspension.
---
Oh man.
---
I was in a position of power once and it really redefined my whole life.
---
how classic works when it comes to deal with toxic people hasn't really started to take affect yet. the bigger the server the longer it takes. this guy is going over time to be blocked by more and more people until he finds himself unable to form a party or raid since people will have blocked him or he will have blocked them.
---
there are a lot of toxic people right now since there is a lot of entitlement going around due to how retail has worked to shield people for so long. it will work its way out but it takes time.
---
oh man. this person must be in a lot of pain to consider a friendly remark so repulsive they responded in that way and ignored you for it. i honestly feel sorry for him.
---
imagine being so sad that friendliness has become so disgusting it repulses you. poor poor man :(
---
Frost nova is 10 yards, or 12 yards with the talent. CoC is 10 yards.
---
Melee is 6 yards.
---
TLDR: You're a dumbass.
---
&gt;You need to be out of combat to cast hearthstone, don't you?
---
I don't believe this is the case, otherwise paladins wouldn't be able to bubble+hearth.
---
&gt; That sounds very niche, or am I misunderstanding something?
---
I played a mage in vanilla, I can guarantee that Shamans who were good at fake casting or using a hearth were some of the hardest to deal with.
---
Wide quest log, but leaxtrix + also has an option for it as well.
---
Bullshit.  You would immediately put in a ticket. This isn't and has never been the culture of WoW you toxic baby.  You just want to justify your own shitty behavior.
---
I literally just got my gnome warlock out of this outfit like an hour ago
---
Same I had 1 acc with only lvl 9-29   Euro servers where to lvl 29
---
I was in Olympus II as well. I left when I was level 25-ish though as I could no longer tolerate the twitch memes.
---
That only makes him a failure in your own weird definition.
---
Stay lonely
---
like how your weak ass playdo skull would cave in when I bitch smack you, fuckin idiot lul
---
More of us would do it, but you need the right groups or the Mage &amp; his buddies will just kick you claiming its your fault.
---
it is
---
&gt; Okay? And what do you know about how successful they are if you never watch them?
---
Because success isn't opinion based? If you want to call him bad, shit, an awful person, a terrible influence on the community or whatever else you go right ahead. Personally I prefer people to source such things but you do you.
---
Objectively he's extremely successful as a streamer, that's simply not up for debate.
---
You don't in this version.
---
Warlocks are the only exception. They get a dank offhand with +shadow damage and a heal from a class quest that the dagger pairs amazingly with.
---
Is there any proof this works in Classic?  I want to try it but I'd have to level a character on another account to make it work.  I'd want to be sure.
---
Clearly a warrior weapon with all that spirit you both wrong
---
Fortunately for Locked Away, you can layer swap and fix it.
---
You could've given those bags to newbies in Goldshire or Sen'jin Village, but hey, keep dicking around toward others, sure.

Earth shock rank 1 to interrupt frost bolt, while trying to bait out Counterspell so you can freely cast lightning bolts. Also purge their shield whenever you see it up.
---
I am currently under the impression that Amsond is better than this guy and wouldnt dupe his guild into greeding so that he can straight up fool/scam them, then laugh about it.
---
I'm pretty sure everyone knows what they're getting into when they raid with Asmond, which is undeniably different, wether you like it or not.
---
Show us we’re the mage touched you
---
He was actually being completely serious. You can tell by his tone of voice there that there is no sarcasm.
---
But he did. He stated in chat that EVERYONE  is to roll for greed and like a second later he rolls for need. People have been banned for this exact behavior in the past so I don't see why it shouldn't be happening now. Most of all this would send a clear message that just because you're a streamer or affiliated to a big streamer doesn't mean you can run around and basically do whatever the hell you want just because you have some "fame".
---
EDIT: fixed some need/greed mixup on my end.
---
I do not understand why people give Asmongold the time of day.
---
Playing Vanilla and being an asshole aren't mutually exclusive
---
I like to get a 3sec cast bow and weave an aimed shot in there. It at least gives me something to do.
---
Dungeon wise tanks edge out healers. For the most part, dungeons can be tanked in a DPS spec by slapping on a shield but a lot of DPS warriors just don't enjoy tanking. A lot of hassle and responsibility. Not unheard of for tanks to get paid to run dungeons for people at 60 to help them get their pre-raid gear.
---
Raid wise healers are vastly more in demand. While you need 1 tank 1 healer for a dungeon, you need 2-3 tanks and 8 healers for a raid.
---
Meanwhile, I got killed 3 times by a 60 mage right near the STV graveyard when I went to Blasted Lands at 50. Had I tried 10 levels earlier it would have been pure misery and absolutely not worth it.
---
I’m not an anti drinker or anything  I do drink when water is available lol and that what you just describe is exactly how I play my priest
---
but not over healing is also important , the 5sec rules and having good tank all improves the speed of the party
---
If youre an easily butthurt weenie i guess.

How do I make a macro conditionally cast resurrection on dead players? I tried using [dead] and it doesn't work if they already released.

Just went into his channel, posted the pic, he gives us the "ALWAYS Ninja when you're a streamer." Dude has 9K total views. What a fucking chode.
---
Well mainly for not dying. Dam 8 that's crazy. If that even happened he would come back every phase drop for stream content. I wouldn't care about the binding not like my class would ever get it
---
I'm not allowed to get pissed when people use psychiatric disorders as insults?

Just a little tip, don't make shitty little off the cuff comments if you're not ready to defend your position with something more than a weak "u mad bro?"

Thanks I love it

I've found in most cases it's either alliance or horde.

You seem like a narcissist yourself there bud

Shouldn’t that be ”malding”? :p

GMs actually ban people for this when they lie like this.

Sounds like he wanted to stack the deck to get loot.

lvl 60, doing MC. still using the dagger
---
Imagine thinking that calling out someones wrong facts is "blindly rushing to their defense"
---
What are you even trying to argue here lol
---
If anyone says "all greed" they are trying to boom you. If they wanted an even playing field they would have said all need.
---
Sinister Strike.
---
Blizz put up classic WoW to prove a point. They never thought it would be successful, hence the gigantic queue times and overloaded servers. People were asking for it. They thought we were all just whining and had forgotten how the QOL changes had improved the game. They thought people would go back to classic, remember all these issues, then they could go "we fixed these a long time ago, check out the retail side of things". Obviously they were wrong. People love the game so far. If it holds up, they just might reconsider their path going forward. Only time will tell.
---
How do I make a macro to cast riposte as soon as it pops up?
---
Sure it's up for debate.  Not everyone defines success purely in monetary value.
---
You can be a millionaire and still be a toxic loser who makes the community worse.  That isn't success.
---
I feel like lvl 50 is the turning point.   In ZF everyone is still kinda nice, going out of their way to help each other.   Once you hit ST, everyone turns back to the edgelord they were in high school.
---
Now give us Alliance a teleporter to Wailing caverns, SFK, RFK, RFD and SM....
---
Agreed. Environment certainly plays a role in behavior, but it shouldn’t be used as an excuse to remove personal accountability.
---
Well, that's not true either is it? You gave a lengthy diatribe on what you perceived to be people not accurately stating facts about their reasoning for disliking Asmongold's behavior only to be inaccurate in said diatribe. That's why I responded and that's why I corrected you. 
---
Whether or not you claimed to be a know-it-all doesn't absolve you from trying to be one. Let's avoid that in the future, *shall we*?
---
ok buddy
---
Haha yeah that weird definition of not being a toxic shithead!
---
Haha what a strange criteria right?
---
Nothing like *crybabies* to take me back to middleschool level replies and discussion. I would try to have some other retort, but I'm sure you'd beat me with experience when it comes to behaving like an overgrown child.
---
On a pve server level 26 how do I switch to a PvP server? Wishing I started on one but don’t wanna start over
---
As someone who reserved my name  on Faerlina without knowing it was going to be the "streamer server" its not bad at all.  Granted I play Horde side but the only way at all I have been affected by streamers is people mentioning its a streamer server or things like that.   Generally its good and easy to make money on the AH.
---
you ride that bull, playboy
---
FOR THE HORDE
---
ITT: bunch of losers getting trigger over nothing
---
I mean I guess. I do my fair share. The wife likes to drive too and since we take my silverado everywhere she likes to take a turn
---
It’s like playing on a server filled with people who have larger than life egos. Let’s just hope they all stay put and don’t start rolling on other servers because they will kill the classic experience.
---
LOL says someone who’s literally using a term—ninja looter—*invented* in Vanilla. 
---
Not very smart or logical are ya?
---
Okay?  That doesn't make him any less of an asshole.
---
This \^
---
What a fucking loser why do people sub to lame asses like that
---
Thing is healers are always needed in "huge quantity" while tanks have it really hard especially late game. You have to be a really, REALLY great tank to be taken for let's say raids since you don't really need lots of them. So I can totally understand why not many people are all that hyped to play/level a tank.
---
Supply and Demand dictates markets. Unless Demand skyrockets or supply dwindles that's all it will ever be.
---
Ask an inn keeper about dungeons you can do, then go find them.
---
Hunters are needed. They have a good CC, they can dispel Enrage from mobs and bosses, and they're great at kiting and pulling. They also make use of the mail gear that drops, which almost no one else will want.
---
Memorising item names does not equal insane knowledge of the game my guy.
---
I'm not your buddy, guy!

And Loot rules were not stated in chat, so all these posts are literal crybabies LOL

How dumb are you? I played Vanilla nearly from launch, and literally this kind of thing never happened. Even whenever I joined a random MC or BWL pug, no one pulled this ninja stuff. People had etiquette and weren’t this level of stupid. And if they were, they were blasted on the forums and in game. Stop being a typical Asmon follower.
---
According to this thread, you aren't allowed to armchair psychology, bud. Maybe we can pick that back up in another thread.
---
I dont know you, but i kinda hate you
---
Don't forget the m+ meta addicts.
---
Knowing everything about a game is unrealistic but he does have pretty disgusting knowledge about items during his transmog stuff
---
Lmao enlighten me on the 'facts' here?  Someone having a high sub count doesn't preclude them from being a toxic loser who makes the community worse.
---
&gt;Speed is always a good thing for a weapon. 
---
It's not. If they have the same or similar dps, many classes benefit from weapons being slower.
---
Blacks are fatally shot at a less rate than whites in America just so you are more educated on the matter
---
Cops are also less likely to shoot a black suspect compared to a white according to numerous studies on the matter
---
You can block channel invites like guild invites or trades
---
Mass downvote every video he has.  Blizzard rules may not be broken but classic rules need a classic fix.
---
Oh please, that is not what people mean when they call someone a failed streamer.
---
For someone who doesn't understand "streamer fanboyism" you sure do seem bent on twisting things to make someone look as bad as possible. Why is it so hard to just say "I don't like him or his content" and leave it at that?
---
Similar situation here, got to 35 before touching SV.
---
I've actually got too many quests to do and keep outleveling zones/quests I want to do.
---
&gt;*Cool, so you read a sentence from my comment* 
---
Barely that, to be honest.
---
It's twitch lol. Most of his fans are like 15 years old. The whole site is like that.
---
U sure showed them
---
I have not had too big a problem with overzealous dps.  That shaman though? Dozens of times now I have had someone go do shit like AH or "just finishing a quest" when the group is formed.
---
Please don't LFG if you're not ready to go the second an invite comes your way.  Also if you want to run SM..dont be lfg in Tanaris.  Making people wait for you is rude and can be avoided 99% of the time with proper planning.
---
How is that a logical insult you turd?  Just because there is a word for something in a game doesnt make it tolerated or part of the culture.  Murder is a term there is a word for, doesnt make it ok.
---
When he says prebis and you talk about leveling gear...
---
Yea I don't understand why you'd bring this up lmao. Orc racial is a huge thing especially for PvP. I'd argue that trolls racial is more infuriating as well.
---
My wife is usually watching television right behind me, so I usually listen to a pandora channel I carefully crafted years ago to be my perfect radio station. Lots of 80’s and 90’s “alternative”.
---
If you’re talking about the helm that was not a ninja. Ozzy is an officer in his guild and rolled as a joke, asmon said at the beginning as the only warrior tank then the warrior tank helm goes to him. He rolled as a joke and Ozzy rolled too he wasn’t just gonna give he item away simply because someone rolled for an item they didn’t need. 
---
The problem then happens when people start clipping and spreading it everywhere and everyone assumes he’s ninjaing cause they have no context from the actual stream. Asmon has definitely done some shitty things but he’s been really good with being fair with loot in classic so far surprisingly
---
I hate that I love it.
---
&gt; Oh please, that is not what people mean when they call someone a failed streamer.
---
Are you the person who said it?  No?  
---
Then how do you know what they meant by it?
---
Not watching streamers makes it easier to be unbiased. You don't come in with a reason to dislike them.
---
I didn't delete it, the mods remove anything without a flair immediately. It's stupid. By the time I got the message that I needed a flair it was gone.
---
You could always [watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNidS5s4UFs) to satisfy it kinda.
---
I've heard horde can buy the chicken feed? Quest item that you need from a horde vendor not to sure tho
---
Can you please stop giving this retard exposure
---
I come here for the memes
---
Someone’s feelings are hurt.
---
You can tank all the way in UBRS as Arms warrior no problem, just swap your leather +hit gear into some valor pieces. For bosses and second part of thr dungeon use 1h and shield. Spam sunder, shield block, revenge on bosses. You will be fine. If you have 2 warriors doing this its ez.
---
This looks like it came from a flip phone, even.
---
Well aren’t we in a interesting debate here. I’d love to be able to grab those for myself but I don’t want to be a dick either. Any other opinions? Need a straw poll haha
---
I got one the other day when I was grinding them for xp, I'm still debating whether or not to save it for when the economy grows or to keep it for my own use..
---
wut
---
cause a dude is an asshole that means we didn't want vanilla?
---
are u dumb
---
Can you mention a streamer that pulls his numbers and doesn't have a single sperg in his "community"?
---
*GOOOOOD MORNING STRANGLETHORN!*
---
This place might be one of the best examples for "War, war never changes...". 15 years and still going strong!
---
The paladin is never going to kill the mage anyways. If a mage loses to a paladin on equal footing they should just delete their account.
---
How the fuck do you know what everybody wants?  News flash, you don't. Nobody does, that's why this discussion is happening in the first place.
---
My point is either sexualize everyone equally and offer the same stuff to everyone. Or don't at all.  And let players decided who and what they want to look like.
---
An armor model on a male should look pretty damn similar to one on a female and vice versa.
---
And if this bothers you, thinking about a g-string on a dude you should probably take a good long look at how it makes women feel to see nothing but tits and as on character models in a video game.

I main a warrior and alt a lock.  Got both to 60 in vanilla, took warrior to 70.  Not gonna lie I spec'd arms and got pvp gear, it is just incredibly fun.
---
I am tanking more in Classic now
---
Nah, do what asmon encourages and say fuck every other player in the game. Need everything. Make the whole experience something Asmongold would be proud of.
---
Are you delusional?  He literally does every one of these things.
---
Ha. That's a good point. Thanks.
---
Not sure what the obsession is with throwing out the term "moving the goalposts" in situations where it makes no sense.  I haven't changed my criteria with regards to anything.
---
Different people have different definitions of success.  I don't think I'm alone in saying that I don't consider you a success just because you have a high sub count if you're promoting toxicity and actively making the community worse.  Promoting ninja'ing in raid and dungeon groups makes the community worse, not better.
---
&gt; tbh it seems like you are the one obsessed with him here, you are adamantly hating on him pretty obsessively.
---
This is literally the first time I've ever posted about the guy, but sure.
---
I wouldn't put crusader on a blue much less a level 50 blue, wait until you have an epic
---
Sim city snes soundtrack for some general nostalgia feels, epic video game music playlist on YouTube (the one with Tidus in the pic), and cuts from my bands new album we’re mixing after about 5 years of writing and recording.
---
This is what the zoomers get as punishment, fuck what anyone says. If a boe epic drops you roll need, if a nighteous orb drops you RR roll need, if a flask pattern drops, you roll need. If a travelers backpack drops, you roll need, if a pristine black diamond drops, you roll need.
---
Everyone needs these and all it takes is 1 fuckwit to roll need if everyone greeds for everyone to get fucked, remove the option for them to do that.
---
This has been the meta for years on private servers.
---
Fuck this guy
---
Definitely possible, informations all over the place now days.
---
Find me the clips please.
---
&gt;The thing is, in terms of relative BiS it's worth so much more for Hunters or even DPS warriors/rogues than it is for tanks. 
---
You're just solidifying the fact that you have no idea why +1% hit is really good for prot warriors. 
---
&gt;you're kinda being a dick and prioritizing your own needs versus others.
---
Masterlooting it to myself would be a dick move. Rolling fair and square for it would not be. You're not entitled to a bow simply by being a hunter.
---
Just wanted to drop a thank you for the shaman earth shock/attack macro. It's gonna be my third macro this time around. First was for follow and the second for spamming guild name in wpvp lmao.
---
Honestly, the problem is there are *too many* clips of Asmongold.
---
You have to wade through literally thousands of Youtube videos to find the one you want.
---
Mind Control is useful for more than just throwing people into lava
---
A
---
Curious where you think a tank will be picking up an epic 1h from anytime soon.
---
@op, the bone slicing hatchet from UD strat is a great choice for orcs.
---
Is this really something you can blame the entertainer for? I agree with your points, but think blaming him for his audience is similar to saying violent video games cause violence.. 
---
At the end of the day his job is to entertain, if stupid ass kids think thats how the world works is it really Asmongold’s fault? 
---
I don’t watch twitch streams because the chats are toxic and stupid, but I think he is decent at entertaining when I come across the occasional youtube video.
---
Funny enough I am right in that demographic (22yo male) and still can’t stand twitch culture at all. I barely get meme culture.
---
Found the boomer
---
I just started a lock, thank you!
---
They said this year, not early this year.
---
I agree with you, his stream went to shit during legion. But you can't say he doesn't read chat. It's 50% of what he does during stream lol
---
It's one of the main reasons he underperforms during stream, he's never looking at the actual game he's playing. Sure, he's bad now, and he can only play wow, but I'd find it hard to believe he'd do the same if he focused on the game.
---
Thanks, I didn't buy any skills from 32 to 40 and grinded a lot of beasts with skinning for most of 35-40.  I had 95 gold by the time I hit 40 and could just barely afford it XD
---
If anyone says “all greed”, I’m not hitting greed until I see him do it first.
---
Cat does fine in MC etc. I'm feral and "pre-paid bis" for both cat and bear, and the times I don't tank I pull respectable numbers, just don't expect to be #1 overall if theres decent players with similar gear in the raid
---
Tryhard7 
---
OMEGALOL
---
Shoot me now plz..
---
I think he means in cases where you need to range pull - dps pulls, tank hasn't entered combat yet, then tank charges in safe range.
---
I play prot warrior, I know that hit% is incredibly good, it's just not as good as a bow for hunters, and if you don't realize that you're fucking stupid and bad at this game. 
---
Thunderfury is also dope for Fury Warriors, but not giving it to your tank is stupid af since it's much more important for them.
---
Sorry chief.
---
When I have used it I tend to find myself disagreeing with where to go and then go do my own thing - like running from A to B but point C nearby has a quest/objective so I'm going there first.
---
I've started leveling an alt though and decided to just follow it exactly for once. Turns out it's pretty well planned and thought out, saves time by running into nearby zones to collect flight points for later use. E.g, humans running to Sentinel Hill picking up quests and FP at level 10, and running to Lakeshire before flying back to SW when finished at the eastern end of Elwynn.
---
14y old edge Lords that think it's gonna be the next asmon. For as much as I hate asmon because of the kind of audience he has (and I mean he's a dick too) he's at least entertaining and knows a good chunk about the game, speaking for me at least.
---
This guy on the other hand is just a twat.
---
now they get free, super targeted advertising thanks to you
---
Definetly bonebiter, if you are around 44 you can try to grab The rockpounder from uldaman or an Executioner Cleaver from AH, it will last you till 52/53 where you can grab a Twig of the world tree:)
---
L
---
We’ll see when BWL gets released. They don’t call the Vaelastrasz the guild breaker for nothing. I reckon if Razorgore exploit has been fixed, he may never even reach Vaelastrasz.
---
There are so many broken things in classic that vanilla didn't have that #nochanges is just not a thing.  It's already vastly different from what it originally was.
---
I'm in Olympus level 50 and I give up raiding at level 18 or something because of this type of shit. If this was done to me I would lose the plot. Ban this cunt.
---
For the horde!
---
He's one of the 4 people when asmon hit 60 along with slowbo, paladinie, kas. Can't believe he's done this shit after Asmon gkicked so many people after they got reported via mail on stream. Chat really likes him. Sigh.
---
100% and literally what I said. No clue why that dude can’t read.
---
Be careful, i didn't do gnomer while leveling and there's a bug in game
---
If you complete the quest [STOLEN: Smithing Tuyere and Lookout's Spyglass](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=7728/stolen-smithing-tuyere-and-lookouts-spyglass)
---
Before you ever pick up Rig Wars, you will not see Chief Engineer Scooty and will be unable to get the goblin transponder
---
I've opened a ticket and the GM basically said ''we've got reports of that already, tough luck, wait for a fix''
---
Faction balance feels pretty even.
---
Boot
---
*cries in Canadian*
---
&gt;	Except that's exactly what he told his group to do.
---
And?
---
No not really for ubrs. I've tanked it many times as a dps warrior.
---
Irl I fucking hate when people my age call me buddy. Online I dont care
---
&gt;My warrior friends can't stand him though.
---
He's just not good.
---
He isn't bad either, but man, I wouldn't want to raid with him.
---
/cast Riposte
---
/cast Sinister Strike
---
You could technically macro most of your abilities this way so that if Riposte is available it will use it before defaulting to the other skill, but nothing will make it happen automatically.
---
And that makes him an asshole.
---
What part are you having trouble with?
---
Every time one of these comes out it's the day after I finished that particular quest... Stalker
---
I had three priests in my group for bfd (they were all going for the wand I think). I was tanking. 
---
Stuff drops on second to last boss, I pass one of the priests get it. Last boss I charge in start tanking. All my group start dpsing. Me on 200hp “hels pls”, no heals. I die, broken gear. Haven’t gotten a single good drop. 
---
Tank life
---
That’s kind of weird, man. I love doing armory and cath as a warrior. All my best gear is from there.
---
Wow, did you type this thinking it would help your case?
---
Olympus truly is a guild for spergs, and I've watched the streams....not seen anything impressive. Coordination and discipline is nonexistent, can't wait to see all the wipes in BWL+
---
*yes I see now it's a copypasta, point still stands
---
You are responding to every post calling out wrong facts with 'why r u such a fanboy?!?!?'
---
&gt;Different people have different definitions of success.
---
Not in this context. Don't try to be pedantic, it just makes you look dumb.
---
Same. Horrigan and anyone in &lt;The Enclave&gt; has been added to my KOS list. Sweet.
---
He is at twitch con, relax and wait till tomorrow for great content.
---
Thanks for the link to the thread. I found it to be pretty useful for finding some good comments. A few of them were difficult to wade through but the best advice seemed to come from one of the later comments with this build:
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/-30300520200551-502253100032101](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/-30300520200551-502253100032101) 
---
I don't think I would want to run any other configuration aside from maybe bumping things around to get Improved Sap. I thought Riposte would be really good but someone mentioned that most people are running with a chain in PvP so that would make sense. Also, maybe I was a bit overeager on Improved Kick. The silence doesn't seem that great for only two seconds.
---
Who the fuck are you talking about dude? The kid literally **everyone** in the thread agrees is an asshole? Why are you even commenting?
---
He just claimed on his stream:
---
"*I'm kinda enjoying that Reddit is mad at me*" while also saying "*I paid everybody in the group*" and "*they are making up lies, like this Chilldude was my childhood friend or something*"
---
What an absolute assclown.
---
That staff drops every other run
---
Asmon is still a garbage human. It's not a competition of who is more, but he still is. Although I agree he clearly is more trustworthy in terms of guild management?
---
Not sure if the same quest, but [this quest](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13107/magiskull-cuffs) and it's related item have some of the funniest wowhead comments.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;For the Solid Crystal Leg Shafts that drop off of the Glassweb Spiders,  you are going to want to try to aviod criting if at all possible, since  you will get more off of them if you don't crit.
---
&gt;if someone is having trouble gathering solid crystal leg shaft from  glassweb spiders,its not the crappy drop rate,infact its " you ".The  point is ,critical hits reduces the drop rate(1 crit = loss of one  leg),8 crits = no legs at all...
---
Not sure how people come up with that stuff, but at least it's entertaining reading through the comments.
---
I'm colorblind. Just give me number overly.
---
&gt;and if you don't realize that you're fucking stupid and bad at this game.
---
Awful lot of insults there, You feeling ok Kiddo?
---
Except on the 4 Horsemen fight in Naxx, where you need 8 tanks!
---
I finally decided to give the sub a chance, and I picked this post thinking there'd be funny comments. But all I see is irrational hate for Asmongold.
---
Can't say I didn't expect to see any, but this is kinda cringe.
---
oh no believe all women yas queen slay lgbtq+_Z131
---
Isnt whirlwind sword bettee for humans?
---
&gt; You are responding to every post calling out wrong facts with 'why r u such a fanboy?!?!?'
---
You know what makes you look really dumb?  
---
Saying shit that you literally made up.
---
&gt; Not in this context. Don't try to be pedantic, it just makes you look dumb.
---
"My definition of success is the only available one!!!!"
---
Got me at damage meter fan! lololo
---
Yea boi!
---
Honestly with rng it could be at any time, why would you think they wouldn't? Would you put crusader on a level 50 blue?
---
Yup.  I used to be on the other side of the fence, "if it's an upgrade, roll need, otherwise, roll greed."
---
Now, as I'm leveling in classic again, I remember how half the time I'm leveling in all sorts of outdated green gear.  A single blue BOE is far more effective to my overall stats to be sold, and I use the money to update all the rest of my gear to appropriate greens (usually with money left over.)
---
I still just follow suit with whatever everybody else is doing, though.  If we're doing need before greed on BOEs, I'll equip it on the spot.  If we all need, I take it back to the AH and do some research on whether or not to equip.
---
People who don't do instances much know that mobs in there don't leash back to their spawn points, but haven't fully internalised the fact.
---
So they panic and try to run because that's what works in the outside world. If you ask them why they did it, they can't explain.
---
I dont play priest but I love when people master a UI, especially one as difficult to program (well) as Grid. Nice!

My experience

I like faster 1hs when tanking so I'd say miras song
---
Im sorry to hear that. I'm sure you've heard it hundreds of times that its just in your own mind that is true. But that probably doesn't help or change anything. It wont get better either. Not by itself. I honestly hope you get yourself some professional help. You've probably heard that before too and thought "whats the point in saving me, im worthless". But please do it anyway.
---
yes
---
Yeah, they’re the PoS in this situation 110% totally agree on that one my buddiest of buddy buds
---
I’m going to have to try this out! 
---
Do I need BenikUI to copy over the string?
---
Get that hate out of you.
---
I agree as well! My least favorite thing is when tanks wait for everyone to be 100% mana and pull only 2 and demand one of them to be sheeped. It's like geez, if you let mages add CoC, hunters multishot, warlocks dot both, etc it will go faster even if I have to spend more mana on healing. Levelling dungeons are not hard lmao let's pick up the pace a little
---
This argument was the most pathetic thing I've seen in a long time. I hope for everyone around you's sake that you don't conduct yourself in real life the way you do here.
---
I'm not interesting in chasing your dumb ass around.  There is no reasoning with you so insulting you is cathartic.  Go away now.
---
Boars are super common, easy to keep they eat almost everything so good starter. You can eventually transition to a cat while in the barrens and beyond.
---
The link to him saying it's okay to ninja loot from non-guild members "because it makes the guild better" was in the original post where this guy ninjas and puts it on the AH. He absolutely said that and it's indefensible. So your whole high horse attitude is either fake or at least uninformed.
---
ehh blizz doesnt give a shit how popular someone is when it comes to banning. they are banning wf guilds mid progress if it has to be.
---
I use that staff to tank with as a feral druid.  Don't know what he was going on about.
---
Battlegrounds, when they come out in phase 3.
---
Gurubashi Arena as well, but that is few and far between those battles.
---
Looks like ole Reddit pulled a gnome on us again
---
Using a wand is still very much recommended because of wand specialization.
---
I went to a zone where I had a quest to get some dust thing from Dragonkin and these were the most appropriate for my level but I ended up going for the over leveled ones because so many people were clearing out these whelps.
---
"a ton of the quests are in tiny areas with bad respawn rates constantly fighting for tags and getting ganked for them"
---
Are there a lot of quests that match this description in any 40-60 zones? Where there's a relatively small amount of spawns like the rock elementals or troggs that a lot of people get funneled through, so it takes forever to finish
---
Rattlegore
---
LOL keep writing butthurt essays!
---
Because you supposed the people are most likely looking up guides instead of just realizing a mage needs intellect and gnome racial is boosted intellect
---
You're right, didnt see the congrats.
---
No.  It's just Tanky McTankface. Why?
---
Regular people would do this if this was their job, and I have a girlfriend who makes ads for websites. She’s still hot and a nice person, she just has a job that people don’t like. I had a job where I helped strip a mountain of all its resources and burned thousands of gallons of diesel fuel. I mean, that’s pretty shitty, but I did it for my job
---
Lmao
---
I typed, “hey bud I will pull or that will happen,” to a rogue who pulled a 4 pack and split their dps on the group while I tried to run around and get aggro, and he replied, “np bud.”
---
He then sprinted into 20 mobs and vanish trained them on us
---
I don't hate him...? I'm just genuinely curious about what's like-able about him.
---
I don't wish harm on him or think about him 24/7.
---
You are really into the nature of assuming things my guy.
---
Not even in a discount on flightpaths? Lame
---
I could give a fuck less about the ninja but, "You are benefitting from our expertise".... your entire post history is filled with noobish questions. How are you officer worthy if this guild has so much expertise?
---
Thanks for your ruling, moral arbiter of Reddit!
---
Here's a list of people who care:
---
pretty sure its either Weak Aura's or tell me when
---
Smolderweb is pretty balanced and doesn’t have that many hard core people. It lends to a newer player environment
---
The axe from strat UD is really good for orcs untill you can get the fist wep from magmadar
---
Because he’s a shitter just like majority of streamers
---
Alt-tab switches get Stitches!
---
Priest received loot [Bolt of Silk Cloth]
---
&gt; Me on 200hp “hels pls”
---
&gt;You died
---
&gt;Honestly with rng it could be at any time, why would you think they wouldn't? 
---
Imagine playing the game counting on the fact that you're gonna get a once in a lifetime drop lol.
---
Now you’ll make money even faster. Great investment.
---
Until Naxx
---
Holy shit do y'all really not know how to take a joke? Like are you actually this dense to think he's being serious?
---
Its still faster to always go all out with quests and not drink and eat until the last moment. Ganks included. A few corpse runs dont ruin your xp/h as much as being very inefficient due the snall possibility to get ganked.
---
He should have zero followers.  Idk...his actions are really bothering me.  I just feel like there should be legitimate and harsh repercussions.
---
I don't think you quite grasp how pull threat works. In general, you always want to be the first to get any threat on a target in order to make it easier to both hold aggro on and retake aggro of that target.
---
Keep talking like a fortnite kid.  Bet you call people you ninja loot 'soiboi cucks' or whatever falls out of that empty recess you call a brain.
---
What universe do you live in? Have you ever been outside? Or have you remained in your safe space since conception
---
Warlocks probably have it the best as far as solid class to needed class balance at 60.
---
LOL using a term that was literally popularized in Vanilla.
---
ope, forgot about the loot setting. That's not exactly what I'm talking about though, it has a lot of issues like not giving you a chance if you're 1 level below the requirement, or not letting paladins get a chance at healing cloth. My suggestion is that, for example, priests can't roll need on 2h axes, because they can *never* use it. Leave it open for rolling on lower-tier armor, things you can use at level 40, etc. to appease people who like the relative gear freedom in classic.
---
I would guess that bonebiter is better. Those extra stats can't be discounted.
---
Bone Slicing Hatchet....
---
When everyone is saving for their mount at 40 but you are hoping you have just enough to get your level 40 abilities. :P
---
What does your girlfriend making AD's for websites have to do with literally being one of those titty streamers who abuses twitch's TOS and just sits on the stream all day with her legs spread (which she literally does all day btw).
---
???....
---
I'm not gonna lie, I hate you more than a little for already having HoJ. All I've ever seen drop is the chest.
---
This is one of the edgiest player bases I’ve ever met. I got abused by a guy for guess what, not helping HIM win the gurubashi arena! It’s a free for all and he was just some random in there, not grouped with me. 
---
So many entitled people in the game. It’s actually much worse than retail for some reason.
---
Haha, your mom thinks you're a waste of space.  :D
---
I'm on Fairbanks, I really like it
---
LOL keep posting and then deleting responses!
---
There needs to be a separate subreddit for Staff of Jordan drops
---
I am a new player. This is a copypasta. 
---
This was originally a serious comment on a popular post a few days ago from some guild officer on Arugal in a guild called "surprise". This was his reply to being called out on ninja looting.
---
You people are extremely aggresive when defending him. It's very comical.
---
Thanks it took me about a week to make!:)
---
As a mage i used this staff untill upgrading in ZG.
---
While leveling raw stats are more valuable that a few extra points of spell dmg, especially with the aoe meta.
---
His posting price is on point.  He is also quite the murloc for doing this.
---
Ah fairbanks, glad I left that server.
---
Where did I delete anything I said to you?
---
Warriors are only good DPS once they out gear the content they are in.
---
When getting your Pre-BiS you should be tanking to keep the groups rolling.
---
UBRS especially goes much better when you have the lesser geared warriors OT on large packs, Rend, Drak etc. 
---
You are not fulfilling your class role if you dont have 1h+shield, and might as well have rolled a rogue.
---
Facts are rough
---
Because regular people don’t care what someone does for a living even if it’s ridiculous. If you can make a living entertaining, do your thing that works. I don’t care. It’s better than having a soul draining job like some that I’ve worked
---
also I hate ads and they have more of a negative effect on my life than some hussy I’ve never heard of. Do I get mad that my girl helps make them? No, cause that’s the job she fell into and she needs that money to live her life
---
I'll give you an example of him being a complete hypocrite and going back on what he said. Watch the video at this timestamp:
---
[https://youtu.be/iQO5srlsgdI?t=463](https://youtu.be/iQO5srlsgdI?t=463)
---
He says he wants to experience the true classic without any donations. I don't think I have to link to you the hundreds of clips of him accepting and begging people to give him things.
---
Oh holy shit lmao. I'm sorry I'm out of the loop here. Keep going my good man.
---
ahh cmon, a newb just needs to fish for 30 minutes in the barrens and he can buy 3 or 4 mageweave bags.
---
Thanks!
---
In addition to the other response, you can create macros to bind your autoattack into your other abilities. For instance,
---
    #showtooltip Flame Shock
---
    /startattack
---
    /cast Flame Shock
---
Will make it so that when you hover over that spot on your action bar, it shows the tooltip for the highest rank of Flame Shock, and when pressed, it will both start your auto attack and cast Flame Shock at its highest rank on your current target.
---
For BM you should be using multi shot and raptor strike as well anyway
---
Ok thanks! any news on when this will release? Can’t seem to find any
---
You god damn earned it!!  Everything counts in classic!
---
Green with frozen wrath or pure int if you go oom during boss fights after using all consumes.
---
I dont want to meme reply, but that may be retail influence.  I never experienced any of that on pservers
---
Lmao. Rinse and repeat
---
It would take a spreadsheet to check that claim, and I don't see a link to a spreadsheet in your post. All else being equal I want a tank to have more armour rather than more stamina, because it's easier to heal well-armoured tank that takes less damage than a giant tomato can that has loads of stamina but no mitigation.
---
I think you just saw stats you liked and got greedy. Warrior tanks should not be wearing leather when there is even remotely equivalent mail available.
---
only comment in this thread worth upvoting
---
This is so good
---
Get git
---
What a hilariously funny, non toxic joke from the biggest classic streamer. 
---
You can say everything is a joke, but his attitude says otherwise.
---
This is about the douchebag that said all greed and then rolled need on the boe gloves? There were other people in the party, right? Why is only one of them allowed to be angry when he ninjaed from more than one? He sent gold to one of them specifically because he's in the guild of some big streamer he respects? This guy is so pathetic he's trying to elevate himself by name dropping famous streamers even in a situation where he made himself look like a complete asshole over 500g. 
---
All that aside, seeing something like this and being motivated to post a reply is a testament to classic's ability to mold an actual community out of its players. Loot and guild drama was a constant source of entertainment in vanilla, and it looks like classic won't disappoint.
---
I got shadowfang for 80g early on. A friend got one for 25g. Insane.
---
That was my first epic I found in vanilla. Grats
---
r/iamatotalpieceofshit
---
&gt;if you don't know, "buddy" &amp; "bud" are incredibly patronizing things to call people in a lot of places, only spoken when there is intent to assert superiority (hence why you see people in this thread saying it's condescending).
---
Those must be some pretty miserable places full of miserable people.
---
Uldaman drops a couple of decent 2h weapons, I’d check their loot table.
---
Int Stam and Spirit? Pretty sweet Lock staff you got there! ;)
---
Oh no, this makes me feel terrible. I got the staff with two priests in my group. I thought it was fair game? Crap, I'm new so I just assumed I see int and stam and it was a MASSIVE upgrade for me.
---
Whatever you end up at, remember that leveling multiple characters at once is much superior to grinding them on two separate long stretches. Just park your dude in Inn or city between every session and get so much rested XP for both characters if you level them up simultaneously, switching to the other one when rested ends. It's not just leveling burn-out that you avoid, but hours of grinding too, unless you're really into that.
---
Not mad...  Just disappointed, like your mom.
---
We hope for it!
---
So many wonderful changes!
---
It depends on the zone.  If it's STV, being under 50% will just be inviting ganks.  If you get camped because your gankers decide you are an easy target, you will lose a lot more xp/hr.
---
Besides, I'm not advocating an optimal leveling strategy.  These are ways to avoid getting ganked.  If you want the most efficient and quickest leveling, you aren't doing quests in a pvp Hotspot anyways.  And if you are, claims of efficiency are hypocritical at best.
---
For Zanzil's stuff seems like everything that NPC offers can be. I dropped Dream Dust in the Swamp because I wasn't going to do it any time soon. Can't pick it up again.  
---
I am in the fix bugs like these camp.
---
No he wont. Stop spewing this «play what u want» bullshit when he said his goal is PvP.
---
Dwarfs priests are better, and if it stands between a human and a dwarf priest for premades, they will pick the dwarf first every time.
---
Seeing one post about it on reddit =/= the entire playerbase acting that way.
---
Which is exactly why the loot rules changed in normal WoW eventually. If you rolled Need on a BoE, then it became bound to you. Didn't stop enchanters from needing on things they didn't need, but at least it stopped general ninja crap like this.
---
So weird.
---
What do you mean by this exactly?
---
Here we go again
---
Fair enough, then everyone should abuse loot rules because tomorrow Blizzard might decide obeying loot rules is a bannable offense.
---
Successful streamer, failure of a human.
---
If you get a bless your heart, you've probably received the ultimate diss
---
Try it again, if it bugs out then contact Blizzard.
---
But if memory serves, after that event you had to do something like talk to that chick in Winterspring.
---
I've thought about joining that server just to be one more Horde to kos them. Then the queue hits.
---
there is literally no honor
---
Because grom is the best. Kargath hearth is for mages only.
---
they call Vaelastrasz the guild breaker because its not about being good at playing its about doing enough dps, you know, that thing all the memes keep saying doesn't matter.
---
I'm not looking to power level.  I'm wanting to enjoy myself and part of that is avoiding ganks.  Whether it has minimal impact on the long haul, isn't important.
---
Lol seriously?
---
It will let you time your Gouge or your Blind in a few situations, and it's good to have if you're playing a warrior, bu tit's not all that important. An energy timer would be better.
---
Out of curiosity, why do you hate it?
---
Obviously there are exceptions, the main one being with guildies or friends.
---
I'm leveling a warrior partly because its easier to find dungeon groups as a tank. Every day I see warrior spamming LFG chat 'LF tank then gtg'. While leveling every warrior should be ready to tank, those that refuse are being selfish to the classes that can't.
---
Toward end game the problem compounds on itself because there are less tanks they usually find more groups and get geared faster then they have no reason to run more. It becomes a vicious cycle. 
---
Bears are great tanks, even pallys if they have the right gear. There are more classes capable, even pushed into healing at end game so if you really like dungeons and want to make sure you always get into a group I can't recommend warrior enough (the only class I've played so far)
---
I only use it when the target is immune to bleeds, as the atk spd reduction helps offset the loss of rend/dw procs, or I have a bunch of melee on me, I'm at high health and I'm making my health last as long as I can.
---
Whoah, what's the source for that?
---
Yes he is, you just lack the brain capacity to realize that it's sarcasm to promote ninja looters.
---
Because they saw a video of somebody spellcleaving in SM GY and thought to themselves "that looks easy!" But then they never really understand *how* to spellcleave.
---
If that's what you got out of what I said, sure man.
---
Maybe people aren't used to what a GM is? They're used to playing in games where they can do whatever they want. Not where a little human played character comes and judges your action and has all the evidence...
---
What’s that add on that shows what dropped in a run ?
---
BiS hilarious meme spec of an opinion
---
its been &gt;1 month, people have money to spend.
---
Don't be sorry. You did what had to be done. You gave them what they deserve. Kill the noobs before they can grow up to be strong enough to hurt other innocent Ally. The only good Horde are the ones that never crawl out of their stinking holes.
---
Honor system for wpvp tho?
---
Check booty bay gazet
---
I used to wand them after DoTs too. But now I pretty much spam SB instead. The damage really adds up. I peaked DPS on a quick gnomer run and hit 100k+
---
Having canabalism, life tap, improved soul drain,  and dark pact pretty much ensures you never run out of mana.
---
I have a decent mana pool and l if I wand after placing dots I still have over 3/4’s of my mana bar and that seems like a waste to me.
---
As a tank id say big DPS is more important than not taking agro. If the pack dies fast with max DPS, ultimately in dungeons it doesnt matter who has agro. Ofcourse keep healer agro free.
---
Uh uh and you do realize hit chance is more important than either, right?
---
Do a /reload often it dumps your ram.
---
People that run groups like this are usually 14 or socially inept adults. You’re giving this dude WAY too much credit.
---
I’m not asking for 2.0. My point is that balance is achievable.
---
They suspend normal players for it. I guess we'll see what happens when it's one of these people, though. WoW GM's are regular people who likely watch streamers, too.
---
I don't believe you even believe he's joking, you're just pretending to to save face which is honestly just sad.
---
Yeah, I'm more like:
---
Oh, thank you. Thank you, asshole, for using YOUR FUCKING TURN SIGNAL!
---
No it's fine. Don't worry about it. It's not like you just illegally U-turned or anything.
---
Please don't... please don't... thanks asshat. I'm so glad you had to pull out in front of when there's literally no one else behind me. Fuck you.
---
WE WANT WORLD PVP. IMPLEMENT HONOR SYSTEM PLZ, TY.
---
Totally agree but Blizz doesn't mind that extra money. In games like Eve Online it is against the rules to use a program to clone your keys. You have to control everything separately which I think just adds to the skill level and prevents this foolishness.
---
Yeah should have called him a cunt
---
Thanks
---
Wronggggg
---
Could’ve been sarcastic ...
---
Vendor it out of spite
---
There's everything toxic about her not wanting him to enjoy his hobby
---
What? Blizzard does very little damage. If your tanks can't out-threat blizzard after 10 seconds, they're bad.
---
r/im14andthisisdeep
---
This is why blizz later made BoPs bind if you rolled need on them.
---
I wouldnt reroll until i was 60. Such a great way to end up rerolling and later regretting and rerolling again and again.
---
I made and deleted 211 characters in vanilla. It took me almost 2 years to get to 60. When i did, i was so late i barely got to raid at all.
---
Now i didn't start any alts until i got to 60 and had an epic mount. Now i can lvl alts all day when im not raiding.
---
That's what you should do, but the lead told everyone to roll greed so that he could ninja it after they all did as he said.
---
Lol
---
Of course I do. Hunters want hit too, but more importantly we will use that weapon more than you. It's great stats, but just stats for you. 
---
If you want it just tell hunters upfront. If they agree then fine but Hunters should have priority on ranged weapons.
---
That's exactly what I'm doing.
---
Absolutely nothing will happen, keep raging reddit
---
I think someone who actually watches his stream and understand his humor probably knows he's joking moreso than someone like yourself who just takes clips out of context and preaches them as law.
---
I don't see how buying his auctions is a problem. You can block trades, it's an option ingame.
---
There's also a difference between not wanting donations and actively begging people for gold while sitting in ironforge. Asmongold didn't even try for a second to deny donations which is why he's a hypocrite.
---
I’m still having troubles telling folks on my server that 1g for a mage port is not a ridiculous offer
---
Why it's no different than athlete or celebrity fan boyism.
---
It's not properly 'tanking', it's using it to pull safely. You run it in, get a bunch of mobs together chasing it, then helping the mages AOE down.
---
Its not powerleveling. But whatever makes you happy
---
I'm horde and I approve this video.
---
I've had this experience with shamans lately as a tank, they all insist on using Rockbiter Weapon and Earth Shock(at a mob I'm not targeting!!!). Dungeons with shamans has only been a pain so far, whenever there's no enhancement shaman, I actually enjoy tanking.
---
This response actually makes sense, I disagree with it and don’t think the same thing. But I 100% see where you people who hate this are coming from now. When i say “bud” or “buddy” i’m just trying to be friendly, and talking to someone as if we’re already friends to make the other person feel more comfortable. Never meant it in a “talking down” sort of way.
---
Let's say asmongold gets a twink item and puts it up for 100g on the AH. It will be bought instantly by someone because they want to get on his stream. Is this fair? Absolutely not, they're just buying it for the sake of giving him gold.
---
To quote another person:
---
*Layering wasn’t in vanilla.*
---
*Macros 2.0 weren’t in vanilla. In vanilla we had to use scripts.*
---
*Current loot systems weren’t in vanilla.*
---
*Vanilla didn’t start with patch 1.12.*
---
*You people want the real vanilla experience? With broken classes and broken content? Some of these purists are down right retarded.*
---
*We all want the classic experience, not the vanilla experience. There’s a difference.*
---
*The classic experience extends to TBC. TBC was the first major class balance pass and many core issues fixed with the game that blizzard needed to implement to classic.*
---
*Blizzard didn’t implement these fixes into vanilla, because they held them off for the expansion. Dual spec, macros 2.0, guild banks, profession bags for professions that didn’t have them, etc.*
---
Also, I bet you I got further in end game content in vanilla than you, simply because I'm not as stupid as evident from your posts.
---
Gnomes should be eradicated
---
There are a few items that classes probs shouldn't roll on relative to others. Thus is not one of those. I.e Tooth of Gnar I've seen gone to mages a shit load of times over resto shamans when it's not even remotely close to his for them.
---
He means ban the cunt.
---
You'll probably get a little bit of conflicting information regarding the best rotation and ability use as it changes throughout the leveling experience. 
---
I would recommend checking out the fight club discord for classic warriors they have fantastic research to back everything up and lots of advice.
---
The main thing I picked up from them is don't use heroic strike as it prevents you from generating rage in addition to it's rage cost. 
---
Thunderclap is just a really bad DPS ability, does very little damage even in aoe scenarios. I have only leveled the first rank for the debuff and rarely get into a situation where it is useful
---
I think anyone with a functioning brain understands that he isn't joking, you're just a sad fanboy who will claim that any clip that shows him doing the exact behaviors you claim he doesn't do is "just a joke bro."
---
Don't ask for clips if you're just going to whine and cry when they're provided.
---
That’s why you sell them in AH.
---
Healers aren't rare in classic.
---
He's acting and making bank off of it. I still think he is toxic and you tend to become how you act. The Beastie Boys had a good story about becoming how you act.
---
Horde might be willing to buy those for 40-50s per 5 due to the quest making it a net profit
---
He will have a hard time finding a tank then
---
I will forever be listening to Three Days Grace no matter what I'm doing, but for Wow I could also just be watching something on my other screen while just AA
---
0.5 is the upgraded set from quests, which aren't in the game yet. Tier 0/dungeon set pieces are also not optimized for most classes. Your best pre-raid gear will be an assortment of non-set blues for almost every class.
---
I honestly can't see tauren being "evil". They are just bipedal cows and cows are just big dogs with milk nipples.
---
You bring the fury
---
why?
---
As if I needed another reason to dot you up
---
Doesnt make you not a giant scumbag though.
---
It's just sad. Lots of people in chat really missed him after he barely show up in Asmon's stream anymore. Seemed like a cool dude back when asmon was leveling with him. Can't believe this is how his name is going to pop up on the stream again.

---
I know.  Since when did gamer culture get so bad that it's synonymous with that?  I must have really checked out for the last 10 years.
---
The guy he mentioned was McConnell, pull up any video of Asmongold talking to 1 other guy while playing and that's probably him. Dude loves to troll
---
Never played a Druid. Why only 3 bags?
---
I didn't know you meant exact melee range, no reason to be such a cocksucker
---
Keep telling yourself that. I'm sure you'll get really far hating on people and taking everything they say to heart.
---
A couple of weeks ago i was in ST with a priest that didn't buff stamina at first. I kindly asked for it and he asked us why we wanted it. I told him that all stats matter and he went on like "You're not supposed to take damage, just don't get hit".
---
I thought he was trolling at first but he was weird like that the whole run.
---
So? Literally that's what a meta is. Mose Efficient Tactic Available. Mages are the best dps and Warriors are the only tanks. That's going to happen. Doesn't stop you from playing a lock, or a shaman, or whatever you like.
---
Yeah but there is actual proof of him saying to ninja off other people yet nobody has managed to link what you are talking about. Regardless his words and the actions of an officer make it clear what his opinion is.
---
Why do people say to respec as a Shaman from enhance to elemental at a certain level?
---
This is why you never all greed on expensive boe and if someone by accident rolls greed, you make them /roll and compare it to the need rolls to be fair. 
---
But this man... it is the community's duty to render his characters unplayable. If you let this one slip for this or that reason, server is fucked up and ruined for everybody socially.
---
In the car. At night. On a bright screen. Traveling with family around family time while the wife drives.

---
I don't mean to shame the guy, but I do mean to say that his SO is a saint and deserves some level of recognition for that here.
---
The funniest part of this whole thing, aside from the “I have more upvotes than you” comment, is that I’m going to continue suggesting groups all need and people like you are going to whine about it but ultimately, none of this really matters, because at the end of the day, the moment I need is the moment that you have to accept my position, and there are PLENTY of exceptional guilds that would 100% support me in doing so.  
---
I’m not saying “lol I’m gonna ninja got’em” - it’s not ninja’ing - my point is just that what you’re advocating for isn’t practically able to be universalized.  Ninjas will exploit you, people like me just wont accept your rules and you’ll inevitably get mad about it, but that’s all you can do really.  
---
THIS is the fundamental problem with your perspective, and it’s a MUCH more serious problem than that my perspective doesn’t clearly inform us as to what we should do when an item is worth 20-50g (or some similar range).  In my “problem case”, we’re confused and might have some disagreement, but ultimately no one is going to be made substantially worse off.  In your “problem case”, you’re fucked.
---
By the way, the first three paragraphs of your post here are pure ideology.  “Equal distribution is based on what drops and who needs it”?  Uhh, what?   Why?  That’s a pretty interesting definition of “equal distribution” but you can’t just assert it like it’s some sort of fact that is universally agreed upon (it isn’t, btw, that’s why so many guilds would defend my actions as the most equitable way of doing things).  “Stealing other people’s items”? Yeah, same thing here.  I completely reject your characterization.
---
Let me know when you’ve reached consensus from everyone and your advocacy has lead to the abolition of ninja’ing, though.  Until then, I’ll keep forcing a distribution of loot that accepts the realities of the world (of Warcraft) rather than helplessly trying to advocate for a system that ultimately yields the greatest rewards to the most exploitative people.
---
Nah get it right! You’ll run to the healer and then NOVA the mob.
---
I didn't know releasing a classic version of something means you also have to replicate all the bugs too.
---
If you can link proof then just shut up. He also said it's totally fine to ninja off anyone not in guild.
---
3 Warriors and none of them will tank? Kind of stupid imo. At that point you should just roll a Rogue instead if you never want to step up.
---
UBRS and even MC off tanking are easily manageable as fury or arms. I don't think trying to shame the guy for asking a warrior to tank is justified.
---
I mailed some mats to someone in trade who was advertising a buy.  
---
We agreed on a 40s COD.
---
A few days later I got mail back from him with 80s in it.  
---
I had sent him 40s when I meant to COD.
---
I would never have noticed.
---
I have it a bit in a game with a small, dedicated community. I want to give it up. People really, *really* suck.
---
Jesus what a douche...but let’s be honest most people in his guild I want nothing to do with.
---
Honestly just need to get gud. I was pure aoe sll the way and only ever died to druids ganking me at low hp and mana. You dont need frostbite at all. Just kite and control and shatter burst. Thats all you need. And for locks and shadow priests you frost nova and blink away.
---
My mate would do this...
---
Yup, sorry ! I'm not playing in english, so every spell or item name I use is a wild guess.
---
Was running RFC and the tank asked if we should just aoe everything down. I was the only mage. Then I told him I had not trained any aoe spells. He was kinda dumbfounded at that idea.
---
At that low a level, they are kinda expensive and I don't really need them yet. I'll obviously buy them later.
---
They’re coming
---
lol truuue
---
To be fair the 27 Shaman probably was better suited to tank it, I find people are too fixated on the fear of pulling agro. In dungeons you dont actually need a tank, I tank as Arms Warrior with 2h. Its way better to tank as DPS, faster and smoother runs with good AoE threat.
---
you aren't wrong
---
Nice advertising.
---
That makes sense... I just got 40 with my priest and need some more cash for my mount. Seems like the perfect time to get some restxp and make a little cash on an alt. I started a rogue. It's probably not the best farmer, but it'll do the job.

---
Yeah things are a lot different now because we have something we didnt have when the game first came out, and that is 15 years of experience. It's pretty cool seeing people take knowledge from playing the game through all of its evolutions and using it for classic. Changed the game quite a bit.
---
That's a terrible example
---
People are ridiculously oversensitive now, wdym.
---
if you wanted to play pvp, just play on a pvp server
---
/played
---
Yea i dont really keep up with their public trolling. Thanks for correcting me.
---
They don't have to do anything they don't want to do. Some people don't tank.
---
Well, I applaud your reading comprehension skills my friend.
---
God bless.
---
just type /loot. pretty sure it's in the regular ui.

You don't really need a macro just Control+1

Theres a cool hut on the west shore of the dwarf starting area with some goblins. Saw it swimming SW to Wetlands.
---
110 runs and have not seen it yet.
---
BoEs you mean. BoP already bind on pickup
---
How'd you get it?
---
May be able to character transfer.
---
yeah and you're not a garbage human, right?
---
Despite having one of the highest server populations, herod's queue is definitely dying down/has become reasonable. If you want high pop EST it's the way to go.
---
look, im kind of retarded
---
I joined a guild sm cath run, where we already had a tank, so I was told to go dps (that warrior was protection spec).  
---
It's the only time I've been dps (even till now), but I felt like a killing machine. Things were dying left and right. Never had the chance since to dps.
---
I sincerely hope blizzard annihilates this scumbag
---
yeah, exactly. fucking haters man, jesus.
---
Can someone check if there's any Belt of the Ordained on the AH? It's supposed to be super good for paladins but I haven't seen it sold in a while so no idea what to price it at.
---
Yup, this is a good advice. Cats have the highest dps which will help immensely with keeping aggro (great for soloing), and they're not too picky.
---
ty
---
Hunters are free kills. Blink right up to them and shatter burst them. Losing half their hp really stresses them. You have 2 ice blocks to remove trap and outlast beastial wrath.
---
Never said I was perfect or implied it once.
---
I appreciate you putting words in my mouth though, thank you kind sir.
---
Fuck. I hate rebasing
---
It’s stupid now because of people like this, but I honestly never had a problem with this playing on the Aggramar server in the original game. WoW players weren’t as alt right and edgy back then, and we actually liked the people we played with most of the time.
---
What about this actually even remotely sounds serious?
---
He’d do it but wouldn’t come up on stream. Dude has already been spoon fed through classic.
---
I think so? But I'm not positive about that. I'll be on later if you want to give it a go.
---
Trolling streamers should be made an example of.

This is an addon. It is not in the regular game
---
Nothing direct will happen to him but being universally hated isn't exactly nothing.
---
LOL the word "stealing" was literally invented thousands of years ago that means it cant happen today
---
r/TheBullWins
---
That's the plan!  Thanks for your comment!
---
Hmmm I love it when a plan comes together. "Summon thy guildie"
---
The whole world is a BG.
---
Maybe a change it the later patches?
---
Uldaman's polearm (on that Trogg whose name I forgot) is pretty cool. I've been using it for about 10 levels now. As an orc you'd be better off using an axe but it's not necessary.
---
anything you can roll on? Do boes not exist did you forget about the new blazing longsword or honey mace? Stupid piece of shit
---
My friend only buffes stamina on the tank when we were dungeoining cause buffing the whole grp costed like 1,7 mana bars which takes 1min to drink lol.
---
You can PvP without Battlegrounds.
---
It's a lot more fun too.
---
Yeah you just have to add a non steam game to your steam library
---
You can’t blame people like this. The community that surrounds these guys allow it. It’s more of a cult then a community. Don’t see why people are all upset about these things. The members allow it to take place, they are ok with it because they are followers.
---
Lol, I just sent the shoes back
---
If the item is worth that much and its a fair price, it is fair. If he doesn't want to accept donations he won't put an insane ridiculous price which brings me to my last point; he didn't even try to deny donations.
---
Point is, he said A and did B. I gave you the proof and explained how he didn't even try for a second to deny donations. He's a hypocrite. I used to like the guy and watch him regularly. See it however you want to.
---
I dont keep up with their public trolling and guild drama. Thanks for correcting me i striked it.
---
Regardless it is still clear his goal is to put out an image of being a scumbag which encourages others to do so. Its his right to, and its everyone elses right to avoid him or anyone his guild.
---
They didn't say that trees are carbon neutral, they said they are oxygen neutral.
---
Yes, sorry about that.
---
Even the enemy knows your a hackzor
---
Asmongold literally, as in actually, stated in his stream that he doesn't care if his guildies ninja anything from anyone as long as it's not from other guildies. It's disgusting behavior and asmongold supports this.
---
Biggest thing is to just slow down your attacks if your getting too much threat. Aside from that you have Disengage which lowers your threat on a target and Feign Death drops all threat from everything (assuming it's not resisted).
---
The rest are filled with alternate gear sets
---
They don't sell, or reasonably shouldn't sell for any amount worth listing them for. They're only useful for librams; the desirable librams won't drop until DM is released, and you'll get about a dozen diamonds per BRD run. They drop slightly less often than cloth drops. They're vendor trash, except you can't even vendor them.
---
Netherwind is pretty good, but I’m only lvl 20, so I have no idea about much beyond what I’ve seen.
---
I say "thanks bud" to randoms all the time and I haven't had any issue (in game or irl), but holy shit with this thread I guess I'll stop. Maybe it is a southern thing but lmao at people reading such absolute malice into such benign friendly talk. I personally mean, nor were it said to me would I read, any ounce of condescension 🤷‍♂️
---
Razorgore first phase is a clusterfuck of different mechanics you need it overcome. I fully expect Razorgore and Vaelastrasz to break a lot of guilds, but it is true that if you can kill those two the rest of raid if not all raid encounter until naxx will be a doddal.
---
He’s really not that bad at WoW. I’ve never seen him play dark souls.
---
If you're rolling need because you can use it but you haven't paid for it on the AH already, then this is also greed -- and for the exact same amount as someone who would sell it.
---
&gt;Them: "Only looking for a Mage, sry."
---
Yes, people are allowed to have preferences on what classes they invite to dungeons. Form your own group if you don't want to run into picky/spell cleave groups. I regularly make groups on my priest/lock just so I can NOT invite other casters if there is something I really need in the instance. Fair is fair.
---
&gt;World first 60 is a Mage, as are most server first 60s.
---
And yes, outside of layering hunters almost always will out level any other class. But we have layering for now, so that does change it up a bit.
---
&gt;***90% of goldmaking guides:***  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;"Hey guys, you can make X gold per hour here easily......So I'm here on my Mage."
---
Are you questioning why there are other people, specifically mages (kings of farming/open world gold grinding), at your easily googled farm spots?
---
&gt;Anyone that has ever said that Rogues or Warriors are the best class in Vanilla did so with their eyes closed.
---
This is almost always referencing end game raiding DPS. For warriors it also extends to group invites (if you can tank). I don't think anyone has ever claimed that warriors or rogues are particularly fast levelers(warriors are in fact the worst), desperately needed for dungeons (besides tanking warriors), or are gold making machines.
---
All greed.
---
Question regarding hunter pets. I have an Owl pet and I wanted to teach it Screech so I tamed a Greater Fleshripper in Westfall to get Screech lvl 1. Now my Owl has screech.
---
My question is will my Owl naturally learn level 2, 3, and 4 ranks of it or will I need to either level my fleshripper or  tame another beast who has the required rank I need?
---
Shadow is pretty viable even at lower levels.
---
In Canada it’s really common to call a stranger you’re being friendly to buddy. You also call your friends buddy and even people you hate(ironically). Strange to hear that it’s so hated in other parts of the world.
---
Isn't it pronounced 'nome'? 🤔
---
Thanks for the comment!  I have to say it feels good to see results after all the effort :D
---
Ohhhhh my gosh yes, I cannot count how many times I've been running after someone like....STOP RUNNING LET ME GET AGGRO PLSSSSS come baaaaccckkkkkkk
---
what the actual fuck did i just click
---
As a mage who hit 60 last week, Im so sick of using Blizzard.  I still use it to farm now, but I do like to just hang out and single target through dungeons.
---
Seriously never would thought that... holy shit...
---
He’s gonna drink a bunch of noggenfogger elixir and start ranting about the clockwork elves that are secretly influencing the alliance.
---
Without any context of events prior...  Nice one!
---
30 hours of arena, gross
---
What a piece of shit
---
I have to imagine their example talent build was literally one point in each of 51 different talents, somehow, in order to get as many passive auras as possible.
---
I'd like to see it, regardless, because I bet it's hilariously awful.
---
I am 100% the overplanner!
---
 No1 cares.. move on with your life
---
It went over your head, that's all. You don't need to be smart to play WoW, it's okay.
---
Theres a glyph that severely limits shadowforms shadowiness for the people who still want their outfit seen
---
It hasn't been that bad lately.
---
When you have thousands of retards listening and worshiping you, don't joke about anti-social behaviors. They'll do it.
---
that makes your healer waste more mana (that he didn't needed to) and have the need to drink more. Not talking about the cleave strat thingy, but a normal run where everyone has aggro is just bad for a healer, you have to choose of either waste mana on healing dps or heal the tank, at some point if monsters keep coming there will be a wipe.
---
ITT: a bunch of NEETs getting triggered over pixels
---
Hopefully it comes before we're too much leveled, it would be sad to play only at 60
---
Why do people waste their money on tiny pets that do nothing and are barely visible anyways? I dont get it.
---
Guy runs into a bank with a gun and yells “everybody down” and one idiot stands there saying: “look everyone! He didn’t get down too!”
---
That's not an agreement LOL
---
I thought gaslighting is like, insisting that a lie is true to get people to question their judgement and sanity.
---
You'll need to tame a beast that knows Rank X of whatever skill.
---
Very well if you can keep them at a distance
---
Looks cool. Gonna try it out. Commenting to find later. :)
---
HE'S LOVELY OKAY JUST IGNORE THE ACTUAL FACTS AND HES STILL LOVELY
---
Not really. Most cloth users had no problem on me rolling on cloth as ele shaman because they had brains and realize gear itemization in vanilla doesn't work like that. Next you'll be saying dps warriors shouldn't roll on leather because ThEy WeAr PlAtE lmao
---
Been successful at selling them for few silver each. Sometimes does require more than one posting but as they have no fee it is fine.
---
No clue who is buying them and why but they must have great plans.
---
Since then he has changed his mind and has started kicking people.
---
You talking about American politics or WoW?
---
I had a guy extort me over 50s an arcane xmute. Sent a ticket it, my 50s couldn't be restored (not a big deal) but they said it was a scam and action will be taken
---
They might not use the current money to make more money
---
Very confused by this post
---
I read a book in elementary school about a kid who got called bud and it went into detail about how condescending the term was and it stuck with me. Throughout life I've noticed that it is often used in a condescending tone or manner. Of course it's often used with affection but it's always just irritated me. Doesn't seem very polite.
---
I'm a much better tank in my imagination than I am in reality......lol
---
That’s not a reach you’re just dumb. Also ninjas were scum in vanilla and they are now and they should be (and were!) punished in both instances by posts like this (the intent here is to shame this shit head not have it removed from classic) so you don’t have a point either way!
---
This is why retail is the way it is.  Blizzard is so worried about giving players negative social interactions.
---
The question is, are you going to let one bad experience ruin your game, or just find the 99% who won't do this?
---
&gt; People will still spam him trades nonstop, or send him things, or buy his auctions regardless. How is a streamer supposed to make money with no social interaction?
---
You can turn on an option that doesn't allows people to open trading windows with you in classic's default options. Just stop my dude. You can return mail. These are things he **can** control which is what the other user is pointing out.
---
Wait. You mean someone from Asmongolds group is a lier?! My life has no meaning.
---
This douche bag goes off on an acceptance speech before buying an epic mount? Wow, so glad we all avoided that dumpster fire called faerlina.
---
lmaoooo nothing is gonna happen
---
The more I play on an overcrowded server, the more cynical i get. I used to rez corpses at random. Now when those players would go onward to kill quest mobs, gather herbs, get ore, etc that I also need...? Well, I realized that a corpse run might keep them out of the way a few more minutes, so I can get things done.
---
A bit harsh but agreeable. However I don’t mean that in a diminishing way. It’s no different then a famous person living their lives doing what they love. The individual doesn’t really hold the power it’s the people that prop them up. So I don’t understand why everyone targets these types of people. You kinda just have to accept the fact that a select few accept it and embody it. Take that away and they are nothing. Which isn’t always the case or is hard to do.
---
That dude is cancer
---
I work at a school that has a decent population of wow players. It would not surprise me if  that was one of the students here
---
That’s some low life shit right there

That’s from the R Kelly interview he did on CBS about his lawsuits and criminal charges
---
&gt;  (and were!) punished in both instances by posts like this
---
LOL this zoomer thinks Reddit existed fifteen years ago LOL
---
I do it other way around. /sit then hold left click and spam right.
---
apparently because he said roll greed and then ninja'd he can be banned by blizz and have items taken. That this is going to public is gonna probably ensure blizzard will take action because ppl are gonna be mad. I dont really feel bad for them this is what you get for playing with streamers
---
I could be wrong, but I do not think one can be banned for this type of action? Does anyone have any info on this?
---
Combat Daggers is a good spec
---

The spec really shines at 60 once you have hit cap/higher crit level.
---
It’s like treating them like they’re a kid
---
Booooooooo, you suck!
---
&gt; someone like yourself who just takes clips out of context
---
What's the additional context?
---
R. Kelly got extremely emotional during an interview about his crimes.
---
assuming feign death + trap works, it's a high chance of win if you play your cards right. 
---
If it fails, hopefully you have scatter shot, and if that fails, hopefully you also have intimidation. 
---
on private servers it was really easy to kill warriors because of how quick feigh death trap worked. 
---
Max distance and kite
---
Yea apparently I live under a rock.
---
Hey, why is hypnotica blade + spell damage off hand better than Hypnotica blade + 12 int off hand. Is IT because frost mages get their crit from shatter anyway? So spell damage preferred?
---
I got mine today too.  I play a lock so it was free, but it was still challenging/exciting getting there.  39-40 felt like the longest level ever.
---
I think they said which phase I just can’t remember
---
&gt;but more importantly we will use that weapon more than you. It's great stats, but just stats for you.
---
It's "just stats" for hunters too. It's hilarious that you don't understand that. It's ridiculous to think that a tank being more likely to land his attacks/abilities is "just stats". I would argue that your tanks landing their abilities more reliably with added Hit is more important than a DPS player doing slightly more DPS. At least in a raid setting, Your tanks performing their job optimally is more important than any single DPS player. Do you understand that?
---
lol @ "just stats", As-if that doesn't apply to literally every piece of gear in the game.
---
I thought about clarifying that back then it was on realm forums but I falsely assumed you had above 14 IQ and would be able to reach that conclusion
---
I'm lvling my third character. Good to have all you want at 60 before pvp starts in p2 :P
---
All's fair in (pre-Geneva) war.
---

---
Good thing we don't need a retarded analogy because the ninja admitted he stole the item in chat and in subsequent clips.
---

---
Imagine being so retarded as to WANT to play with someone like this.
---
Ohhhh my sweet retail child.
---
Back in ~2005 when I made alts, I remember I could sell linen cloth stacks for 2g per stack. When people no longer have good ways to spend money, the leveling items will indeed raise in prices. Probably not to that extent anymore, as internet has evolved, people know the optimal farming places, farming strategies much better, so there'll be more competition for every piece of gold than in the past. But silk cloth can't really be gained from any optimal lev60 farming so I see no reason why its price would remain that low in the future. People leveling tailoring for alts, or just bandages for alts are going to buy them for at least double the vendor price sometime in the future.
---
Twinks are only relevant in phase 3, so that's definitely what you want to wait for.
---
You're definitely exhibits A, B, and C for that
---
100% agree with exactly what you said. Was nervous and asked to tank UBRS(don’t mind tanked the other dungs before) for first time. It’s really easy but those packs after Beast are real rough..
---
Do you think we can enjoy world PvP?   
---
We're pretty much casuals, I have only 2 hours at max to play per day. I've used to play WoW in my youth but just backing to it now and she never played, so she's pretty newbie. We're on a PvE because I was scared of getting ganked over and over and not enjoying the game.
---
I was wondering why I've never seen these when I play.

I've been in a guild since like, level 11. Jesus.

---
No, gaslighting means accusing people of doing something they never actually did to make them doubt their own memories and feel helpless and unreliable. Small lies over a period of time to manipulate how they view themself
---
Seen him today and reported. The do get banned as it's a new name every day but they'll just create new accounts.
---
It actually about dealing with a random unavoidable death mechanic. Mythic raiding would be a lot more entertaining if player were randomly assigned a debuff that would make all abilities free and instant cast for 10 second but then killed you and dealt heavy damage to surrounding players. How long would it take method to kill the boss knowing that from no fault of their own, the entire raid could be fucked if both tank just randomly died.
---
How to?
---
As a warrior, I currently am a blacksmith, intending on crafting the lionheart helmet. Is it worth it to keep the profession afterwards ? Can it generate a reasonable amount of money, or can it craft other good items ? Should i drop it for engineering (possibly goblin for the very useful explosives) ? This question includes future phases.
---
I was wondering the same, though sometimes druid bar interferes with the UI.
---
Well, telling your group to roll greed while you roll need and people just giving you things are really two very different things.
---
Maybe World is bugged and Local is fine? I dunno. I'm glad it's not just me.
---
Been leveling with a lock in my party its burned into my mind at this point.
---
They’ll downvote you because you spoke the truth.
---
Did you think we brought you here because of your dps? But srsly ty for the water that shits expensive.
---
The line is how much hp they should have left.
---
Did no one heal you the whole run?
---
This guy seems exactly like what I would expect from an asmongold officer
---
LOL he's still wrong, and so are you!
---
Telling everyone in a party to greed something does not mean you're going to greed it too! LOL
---
Deepdive Helmet?
---
Then they wouldn't take my advice anyways so
---
Thanks!!

thanks :)

Backpedalling so hard. Nice tactic!

The difference between Zeal + Mirahs vs Dalrends is miniscule. See, the proc procs aaaall the time even in 5men content without windfury (if you are horde) and gives a 4 DPS improvement.

As rogue, because warrior can just run UBRS and reserve one sword at a time and get it fairly quickly.

Dalrends:54 AP

1% crit

1,4DPS more on Dal'rends OH

Zeal + Mirahs:

18AP

0,9% crit

This is the breakdown of the two weapons.

Ive played with a few rogues that have opened chests for the group. Most have offered up anything that would be a 'need' roll for someone else (our healer got a nice staff this way). but by in large its a rogue only reward
---
Op used honor farming as an example by farming same ppl over and over. Im saying you can't do that cause if u kill the same person over and over each time u kill them u get less honor until u get none or little to none
---
Because 40+ elemental deals more damage and is supposedly better for questing and survivability than enhancement, both are fine though, especially melee cleaving groupings as enhance

Is it balanced? Or does that stuff not matter that much

Look at your bis list from sites and try to get those as the 0 sets are really not good for us casters

Yeah but there wouldn’t be much overlap of Blizz employees and Asmongold fans. Blizzard employees work..

i bet you didn't even take the time to fully appreciate the undead cinematic
---
I’ve seen people lose their shit multiple times over the most ridiculous things in classic. People having a meltdown whenever someone tries a little banter with them.
---
Is RP required haha
---
I tried on many occasions between 30-40 to try and find a group but no one seemed interested unless it was for farm runs or atleast 2 or 3 runs when I just wanted to do them for the experience of never running those in vanilla. 
---
Ofc some people were interested but i never managed to find a tank willing to trek to SM for a single run. Not terribly bothered as im sure i'll level an alt sooner or later and do those dungeons atleast once.
---
its funny farming zul farrak for gold at 60 and you go out to reset and you see them emergency stop casting their spells once they see the skull

I mean Twitch is basically chaturbate lite at this point.   I wouldn't count on them doing anything.

If you're on a PvP server there absolutely is no "wrong" in engaging in PvP whatsoever. Can it be scummy, annoying and really infuriating? Yes it can. But everyone knows what they sign up to when making a char on a PvP realm. It's called world of WARcraft.

Well i didn’t mean twitch...i think people should unsubscribe and maybe blizzard should give him a little punitive action.
---
That would actually help him on youtube.  Idk the rules on twitch.
---
I'm not so sure, see while the other bosses are easy and a sign of what they did in future expansions, blizzard never did revisit the mechanics from any of the bwl bosses.  Now I'm sure it will be beaten day one by the top guilds but the other guilds who has just spent four months hitting the loot filled piñata may struggle when bosses require solid tactics and team coordination.

Honestly I feel like you’d have to pick a streamer server on purpose. I just picked one at random, and I’ve never encountered a big streamer or cult

you can do it too but you gotta pay $75 a month to play wow
---
You’ll meet scores of people along the way, trust me. Just start the journey and don’t be worried
---
The issue is not so much that people are idiots and didn't roll need and trusted him because he is affiliated with a 'Influencer'.
---
The issue is that this person is clearly proud of the fact that they took advantage of all these people and shows zero remorse for their actions. He is really just proving the good ol' capitalist way, yet for some reason millions upon millions of people who live in a capitalist system seem to think is need &gt; greed IRL, but it is in fact the other way around.

Now you have idiot apologists defending this guys actions because 'capitalism'. Bitch, ain't no one arguing if it was stupid, there arguing if it was right or wrong, but no one gives a shit about morals any more it seems.
---
Ukorz is lvl 48. Good luck killing him when most of your attacks just fly by him.
---
Not talking about Antu'sul, who can be pretty challenging even to 45s, the temple event which is a survival mode and which, if failed, blocks access to the last bosses... and don't get me started on how long the tombs are gonna take with a full group of 40s.
---
No they're not lol
---
that's some strong victim blaming here
---
not if we can convince blizz to ban him.
---
I mean not to be rude, but looking at his background, he may have won the roll but he already lost at life.
---
So glad I'm running on a PVE server. Getting to SM would be a nightmare otherwise.
---
You dumb asses enable these idiots by supporting everything they do. You deserve what you get.
---
Lol warriors only tanks.... U looking down on prot paly and bear tanks. If people know how threat works, paly's are actually very good for aoe tanking
---
There is none in classic
---
You've got mail, dude.
---
Yet you posted...
---
No. A [gnome](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/gnome)  (nome) is a mythical creature. A genome (gee-nome) is a set of chromosomes.
---
See this is my problem with it.. from what I've seen of him I'm not really a fan.. but that's because I just don't find him entertaining. But all the people who say this stuff never actually show it happening.
---
I guess I just generally prefer when people want to list off how horrible a person is they back it up.
---
Same as the other guy. Was a die hard bartender user for all of vanilla and when I came back and played some legion last year but since I found dominos since classic dropped I must say it is superior.
---
LOL victims of pixel theft
---
You crying over a *videogame*. Go outside for once?
---
Is this the elemental quest in badlands? Yea this quest is shit. I had to log out and come back in the morning to grind it out.
---
there is no wrong. yeah u can be mean. sometimes you just gotta take out your anger on questing lowbies.
---
What is the font in the chat? Looks pretty good
---
A MOBO FONE?!
---
I’m in Crusade and it has been the best guild I’ve ever played with! Almost always a group of guildies for dungeons so I don’t have to worry about this ninja crap.
---
But they need the third mage so they can do it *FASTER*. Otherwise actually doing the dungeon is a waste of time.
---
Ayyy fellow whitemane ally. Bring that sexy axe to stv and lets put in work on these horde
---
Did you actually read my post? I covered that. I was just explaining things to the guy who asked the question.
---
Well that's because as horde you couldn't cheese Razorgore and so where a lot more prepared for Vaelastrasz.
---
never played retail. played vanilla when I was a kid.
---
Have gold to spend, do spend it on stupid shit.

Just trying to gain hype for his stream just like asmon

---
Mortal Strike (Rank 1) is weapon damage +85, and is reduced by enemy armor.
---
Rend (Rank 4), available at the same level, is 98 damage over its duration when not talented. 
---
Rend is 10 rage, giving it 9.8 damage per rage, or dpr. MS is 30 rage, with a dpr that scales based on your damage against the target. To tie Rend's dpr, MS will need to do at least 294 damage after armor, since Rend's damage ignores armor. The value goes up significantly when you have the talents.
---
Now, the majority of things that will take significantly less than 294 damage from MS are also immune to Rend, but that's beside the point. If you have MS, you'll notice that it's honestly only just beating that ~300 damage per cast by a small margin when you first get it. Rend is actually pretty damn rage efficient, all things considered, so long as it ticks for its full duration. It just happens that most fights past level 40 don't last the full duration, and it needs to tick for the full duration for that efficiency to kick in.
---
And not doing much from the looks of it haha
---
It can't know the last price if it's never seen it.
---
Yes there are. This is very true. However, they're stone useless when it comes to tanking bosses, which is the primary mode for a tank.
---
Hate to break it to you, but the green bug is no longer in the game, this pet lost about most of the value.
---
Yes i do.
---
Serisously read the start of the comment i was responding to. The guy was talking about str/stam leather  as BIS... which is horseshit
---
Well I wouldn’t choose any of those awful names
---
We stared for a bit and had a dance off. I let him off this time...
---
Yeah I'm working on it
---
This is very true.  However people are missing important fact.  There is a sizeable portion of the population that feels the same way and are just as sick of tanks expecting dungeons to be "cleaved" 
---
Use this to your advantage and find cool people to group with and leave the AoE grinders alone.

Mines chug water xxx chug water xxx more water mage xxx fear wipe chug water.

---
Shadoweave stuff is fantastic when you can use it. You should switch over when you can. It will last you well into your 50’s. The +shadow damage can’t be replicated by stats.
---
The only times I see people looking for healers is BRD early bosses, sometimes scholo and LBRS, neither of which have much healer drops. There's often several healers LFG strat (both live and UD) and emperor, and if some group needs a healer for those they will find one in seconds.
---
This changed a lot since vanilla, where people were much more reluctant to heal from what I remember.
---
There's the green one for the Green Dragonflight (Ysera, Emerald Dream, etc.)!
---
The red one for the Red Dragonflight (Alexstrasza, etc.)!
---
And the dark one for the Black Dragonflight (Onyxia, Deathwing, etc.)!
---
The old ways are gone. Now people are just playing classic with retail mythic retail attitudes.
---
I have a dumb question. Why does he say "more dots" during phase 2 when there's a mechanic in Classic that limits the number of debuffs on a target?
---
Yeah, I was healed through out the run. 
---
As I said I actually thought they were already casting heals on me when I was like 100hp since two out of our three priests had more then half their mana. And the third one wasn’t completely oom either. 
---
And I held agro away from them so I was the only one taking damage in our team.
---
"I'm not specced for that" is the worst excuse as a druid, considering any deep feral build can raid tank and you need very little in resto to heal effectively. Maybe if you're oomkin, but then you shouldn't be surprised about getting kicked from groups
---
I wish he didnt to be honest when he isnt doing stuff like this is pretty great like his talks with pyro and all that are much better content
---
No harm in just saying that you're new, but I wouldn't put that in your advertising message because it might deter people from picking you up. Let them know once you're in a group would be a fair balance.
---
I was in a similar position to you. I found that as a DPS, earlier dungeons are very intuitive because there aren't a lot of boss mechanics to worry about. I think these things are important to note though:
---
- Make sure you leave the mob pulls to the tank, have spatial awareness so you don't accidentally pull other mobs.
---
- Threat management can be a little confusing but as a blanket rule, leaving the tank to gain threat for a few seconds before you start to DPS should be fine. 
---
- When an item drops, only need if it's something you will use as an upgrade. Greed is if you just plan on selling it. 
---
- Tank might use raid target icons to signal what to attack first. Usually they will tag the mob you should DPS first with a skull. There is a wide variety of these symbols but for basic dungeons you won't really see more than just the skull, maybe a red cross too.
---
- There are certain abilities that can take mobs out of combat for a while, such as polymorph from mages which turns them into harmless sheep. Generally this is done so that you can focus on a more dangerous target without having to worry about the sheeped one. This is called crowd control; or shortened to CC. Don't attack a CC'd mob, because it will break the CC. Shouldn't be an issue with single target attacks but if you have AOE or multi target attacks be mindful. 
---
-It also doesn't hurt to look up a dungeon guide before you do it to see if there's any mechanics to worry about. You might get lucky with a tank that is also a good leader who will guide you the whole way.
---
Don't overthink it. Worst thing you can do is pull too many mobs for the tank which is something you should intuitively know not to do anyway.
---
You sure he's not talking about the gap between femurs, like in the crotchal region?
---
in pvp you have hks(honour kills) which are given by assisting in killing an enemy player within level range(healing those attacking, dealing dmg to target, cc/debuff), in battlegrounds it has a separate score for killing blows specifically
---
Sure, but you didn't open with your definition so the whole thing was up to debate to begin with.
---
That's the reason you're getting arguments.
---
You can't be vague as shit and then expect people to not challenge you, like come the fuck on.
---
Azshara or winter spring
---
You get online and try to piss people off in online conversations because.. what? That's what gets your off? Man that is just.. sad.
---
I honest to god pity you. Seriously, take a look at yourself mate.
---
I'm not your 'buddy'. You should reconsider how you talk to people...
---
The problem is if you say anything negative about him his army of stans come out to defend him. It's better just to let it be. The hero worship wont allow for viewing without rose colored glasses.
---
Noggenfogger is quite heavily horde dominated. Something like 2:1 at lv 60.
---
Blizzards ban hammer will say otherwise.
---
Gaston bravely risked his life to slay a terrible beast that had kidnapped and enchanted a fair maiden. He put his own body in danger while warning the townspeople not to engage with such a terrible monster. That's a true hero right there.
---
You can only go from PvP to PvE
---
Same story here my man. Left shortly after release of WOtlk. Glad you can experience classic againq
---
&gt; and your DPS is lackluster until you out gear the content.
---
just because you can't dps don't assume everyone is like you
---
Anyone that makes sweeping generalizations about the quality of a class based on the first 2% of the game did so with their eyes closed.
---
This is a channel invite, not a guild invite. I also haven’t received one of these since launch week. I believe they target specific realms and probably don’t advertise on all. After all, they probably don’t have gold farmers working for them on every single realm (was easier to cover all realms at launch due to fewer servers).
---
Says the fragile carebear. You going back to retail soon?
---
I think bag space is the bigger issue.
---
I only keep one or two pets at a time because of that.
---
Haha sure thing pal.
---
Did you really spell absolute phonetically.  Your opinion seems valuable, any more insights to share?
---
this guy is total scum.  unapologetic scum.
---
Wondered why I couldn't pick up fools stout
---
And yet I've seen the polar opposite of what you're saying. As a druid I maintain gear sets for feral dps/tanking and heals(I know you're about to say "well duh mfer you're SUPPOSED TO as a druid, are you a stupid baby or something holy shit"). If you were me, how would you have retorted to the guy who said "druids aren't people and can't dps"?
---
Or are you about to say "he's right, druids can't dps, that's why we have rogues and mages".
---
So you know what, you can say your thing about oh you *have* to maintain multiple gear sets if you're capable of hybrid roles. You say that now, and I can name a list of warriors just off the top of my head on my server who didn't even train any skill that wasn't dps, because they were saving up for their mount.
---
You might have the luxury of picking and choosing the optimal, best classes for your group - surely you already have a bustling guild comprised of top-tier players so none of this is an issue nor even something that needs to be brought up. But for the rest of us, dungeon runs will be comprised of pugs. And many a pug have never tanked as a warrior, or are so bad at it, that you'd never want them to. Or their concept of "tanking" is just doing their dps rotations with a 2H weapon that served them just fine all this time.
---
Must be nice that you'll never need to be in the position to tell all these warriors, who tanked everything in the game from RFC to BRD with a 2H weapon that suddenly nope they're expected to have a 1h+shield for UBRS. I can just see them point and laugh in unison.
---
how are they going to remove the item he ninjaed if he already spent the money on epic mount mhh
---
why do you care what he does with his time
---
Elementals are resistant
---
Didn’t have more than a 1 hour queue this weekend. Could be because of Twitchcon though.
---
Dude. Just think about it. You should pronounce it Jeeh-nome. I don't know how you guys can say it's a 'nome'. Jeeh-nome sounds way more classy and relevant, and more natural. "Hey I just got my jeeh-nome to 60", "My jeeh-nome is looking pretty cool with this new helm i found!". Just think about it.
---
Better to just reroll so you can’t tank
---
Everyone needs gold is stupid, in that case an enchanter should roll need on everything since he can de it for profit, hell roll on bops to vendor amiright?

Him violating the Agreed loot rules is a banable action if one of them sends in a complaint.
---
How do I check that?
---
Rattlegore. The factions are pretty balanced with a slight SLIGHT lean toward horde population wise but it’s never been an issue for me. 
---
No ques, high pop, balanced.
---
If they call it "spell cleave" they should already get fucked to death. How did it go from AOE to that dumb ass term?
---
I felt that way about the giant water wheel in Stonetalon Mountain.
---
That was so cool to see and very out of the way.
---
Gotta Love a trend
---
The mine in classic looks sightly different, i’m going crazy
---
Firstly, there is an implication in your bad analogy that is not present in the actual context where there is a command being given from a perceived authority.
---
A better analogy would be if the gunman said to his team, "Everybody shares the loot afterward" and then takes most of it. Here, it is obvious that he is included in the category of "everybody."
---
Secondly, the words he used were "ALL GREED" not "everybody" or "everyone," which is far less ambiguous if you are still insisting on being obtuse with the exclusivity of "everybody."
---
The ol' chestnut mare! Congrats!
---
Why were you never able to get a mount 15 years ago?
---
They’re both very important. Without a healer or tank, you can’t do “endgame” content. Warrior tanks are generally considered superior and pally (alliance) or priest (either) are considered the superior healers (healing output wise at least) so if you want to min/max and want to play a healer or tank, those are good bets. But the others bring stuff to the table as well. If you don’t want to min/max, pick a class that can tank or heal (or both) and go with it. 
---
Play what’s fun for you
---
Red=dead.
---
People misunderstand, when a higher level kills a lower level it isn't generally because they are trying to flex their pvp skills, feel like they are gods, etc; it's because it is a very effective strategy to boost your faction (the earlier after release the better). The longer enemy faction players spend corpse running( or rage quit logging out), the longer they aren't questing and killing mobs(Thus they are not leveling, acquiring items or gold, rep). They aren't collecting any gathering skills. (Thus not leveling up proffs/possibly acquiring gold. ) And on the flip side it unlocks all those resources for YOUR faction to try to monopolize.  Camping people outside an instance disrupts leveling/gearing on the opposite faction.
---
Honestly if more people saw it as the smart path (although admittedly asshole path), your given faction could dominate an entire server. I honestly don't think it would take more than a few hundred lvl 50-60 characters (not even a coordinated effort, though that would DEFINITELY maximize efficiency) trying to shut down enemy faction resource gains on sub level 40-50 zones to effectively cripple an entire faction temporarily. You could AOE mobs down to almost nothing in areas like STV, ungoro, etc (leaving mobs only to grouped allies). Grab every single gathering node in the zone. Camp outside every major quest hub for the opposite factions on stealthed classes/kill quest givers. And basically make getting into any instance a 4-5 corpse run effort. Have rogues take out AH vendors in shifts in the factions major cities.
---
Honestly it's kind of why DHKs came out in the first place because time wasting is a VERY effective way to establish faction dominance on a server.
---
Congratulations on the Barbie Hammer.

It's the reward for completing the level 20 Paladin class quest.

I read guild, my b. I'm on Atiesh and have been since the day after launch day - so I don't know whether or not there would be. Just seems weird that I've read they happen all the time to some people, and I haven't seen it once.
---
I want to feel included too dammit...
---
Lol after seeing all the memes about STV on this subreddit, I finally feel like I can relate. I abandoned all my quests and swore never to come back

Sheep the humanoids, and use whatever CC is possible with LoS

LOL. Dude says live on stream "I don't give a shit what any of you think" Then I call him out and he turns face and says "of course I care! why wouldn't I care! then bans me because he realised how much of a bipolar scumbag he is openly being. You only ban people when they call you out with valid points. Twitch 101 people.
---
You're correct my dude.
---
"I wanna thank you for your hard work, its all lead up to this moment"

LOL, What an actual dickhead

Oh dear god. It can’t be unseen!

Noticed the scorch vulnerability talent is no where near 33% chance either. Very annoying.
---
oh look, it's this post again
---
Guy rolls warrior and cries when he is asked to tank, seems legit
---
Grats on your priest?
---
Favors horde sightly but it's not crazy unbalanced
---
While I agree, when every 40 man has 8+ mages its a lot harder to get loot.
---
Show me a post where people cried about someone ninja looting from fifteen years ago on the WoW forums.
---
Damn grats dude.
---
I’m stuck on 25 with 5 alts at level 15. I think I’m doing it wrong hahaha
---
European native english speaker, noone I know would refer to their friends as 'buddies/buddys' not really that common to hear. 
---
The word can be used in more than one way and tone is hard to convey in text sometimes.
---
Big true
---
Good idea to go with pickle.... they were pretty shit
---
If you want to min/max at 60 one of your professions should be Engineering. You can keep BS as the other if you like.
---
He said but has since changed his stance on this. He said no more ninja looting.
---
Well that's for later though. Right now there's no pvp, few people are lvl 60, and not enough gold in the economy to justify dropping a couple hundred gold on BiS twink items.
---
If it's a twink item, hold out till PvP. If it's a power leveler item (0-6 range) hold out for a couple months. If it's a decent green, sell for 3x vendor price as a rule of thumb, rounded down to even 0 or 5. (Ie, vendor price 16s, auction for 45s.)
---
What a smug prick. Pretty much what I expected. I wonder if he hit his 5 sub goal.
---
May I ask where you live if you don't mind? 
---
In Canada, at least the few provinces I've been to, we say buddy to refer to friends/acquaintances etc not in a rude way. 
---
Interesting to see places where something so simple can have vastly different receptions.
---

Thanks :)
---
Does your gf know you hate women or have you manipulated her enough to make her agree
---
I was in my guild a month before the game launched. If you want to be a top guild you have to take it several orders of magnitude more seriously than this.
---
You can possibly make good money selling Lionheart helms, and in the AQ phase there will be epic pants you can craft. You'll also be able to make resistance gear in further phases which will be used to make clearing MC easier, and (in the past meta) required for AQ40 and Naxx. You can also craft Nightfall.
---
He's either RPing his character who is an asshole or he IS an asshole. never get why people act like that lol.
---
hahaha why would a mage ever get in range of a shaman windfury
---
actually the worst part of the video is casting frostbolt instead of using instant
---
I'm sorry, but "acting" isn't an excuse to be a giant fucking tool.
---
What of all the people he interacts with who have no idea who he is? Oh, but he's "acting" so it's fine, maybe they should know who literally every fucking streamer and what character they're playing at all times!
---
Not everyone watches Twitch, or Asmongold specifically, and they shouldn't have to to avoid toxic interactions with him or his shitty community.
---
The issue with Asmongold is he did and does nothing to quell his rabid fans who are willing to shit over anyone who posts any form of criticism, constructive or not. So even if Asmongold himself isn't "actually" being toxic he still promotes and fosters a community that is.
---
Nobody gives a fuck if you're playing a character, an asshole's still a fucking asshole. This is like watching prank videos and thinking "it's just a prank bro" is a legitimate excuse after you smacked some dudes phone out of their hand.
---
Any people wondered why some had issues with streamers.
---
A shaman huh. Hope you like healing, as they are the class with by far the worst dps specs in the game at 60.
---
Without knowing much pretext or your relationship with this person. It just sounds like you are being overly sensitive to their comment. But meh.
---
&gt; Blacks are fatally shot at a less rate than whites
---
isnt that just because there are way more whites than blacks?
---
I'm not exactly sure how or why I hate women, but thank you for that I guess.
---
I do dislike people who get away with breaking rules though, that seems a given.
---
I might be misunderstanding you, but agility does a lot more than adding dodge chance.
---
Game theory says “always defect” and so it shall be
---
I use addon character notes for this. It also allows you to make positive notes for when you meet someone nice. Wasn't updated for classic, but bfa version works just fine.
---
Scarlet Monastery is always a blast as Alliance, pick whatever instance portal you get feared into...
---
&gt;Firstly, there is an implication in your bad analogy that is not present in the actual context where there is a command being given from a perceived authority.
---
Stop using bad analogies. You don't have to to make up an imaginary scenario because the actual scenario doesn't fit your motive.
---
what rule are they breaking
---
If i rolled on horde I'd probably do the same thing, thankfully Alliance have the quest for the Sprite darter pet.
---
You have your answer, but I'll reiterate it. Use CC. There's no reason not to use Polymorphs or Freezing Traps.
---
Also, if you have a Priest (*especially* if you have a Shadowpriest, since they won't deal with resists), have them Mind Control the Assassins and let the other mobs obliterate said Assassins before picking up the pull.
---
The general rule is main spec before offspec. If everyone roles greed and you want it for offspec, ask if its ok to need. 99% people are fine. 
---
You should only get first dibs on items for the role youre playing in that group, unless otherwise discussed.
---
I don't understand how my 14 year old brain figured that out before grown ass adults.  There was no mod that could calculate success % back then, is there even one NOW?  Imagine the ai-level coding and algorithms it would take, and even then one misstep would throw said mod out of whack.  
---
TLDR: r/iamverysmart /s
---
im pretty sure 54 is still ahead of the curve. theres less than 100 60s on my server atm. (was made a day or 2 after launch)
---
Like, cant be too mad, his group trusted his ass
---
You're right that Bears don't get melee attack power from agility. That's a change that comes in either TBC or WotLK.
---
Also, as I recall, the armor from Agility isn't increased by Bear forms, so really, all you're getting from Agility as a Bear is the dodge and crit chance. 
---
However, Strength's attack power also does nothing for Swipe, since I believe it only scales with rank and any talents.
---

110 angerforge runs and have not seen it yet. Meanwhile 4 Guildies got it within their first 10.
---
&gt; Do you think we can enjoy world PvP? 
---
Personally I love world PvP, it's way better than battlegrounds because it offers so many possibilities, and you just don't know what will happen. 
---
But it's not for everyone.
---
&gt;We're pretty much casuals, I have only 2 hours at max to play per day. 
---
It may be hard to find world PvP with limited time, but depending on your server/population you should be fine. 
---
&gt;We're on a PvE because I was scared of getting ganked over and over and not enjoying the game.
---
I honestly don't know about this since I've always played on PvP servers, hopefully someone with more experience PvPing on PvE servers can chime in. 
---
I've recently gotten to 60 on a PvP server and I definitely didn't get ganked 'over and over' as people described, sure there were some ganks in STV or outside Scarlet Monastary, but I'd usually come back, res up behind a tree/corner, then just run off and go back to doing my own thing. If a place was too busy with horde, I'd just go to another location for a while and come back when it died down.

Yes because they go horizontal if left 1v1.   Tales of the alliance,  there was this one time I was getting my ass stomped.  I waved, i preyed to no avail and then another came to save me my walk of shame.
---
That is sad to hear man. I assume its primarily twitch followers. At least the cancer is isolated to one realm. I feel sorry for anyone rolling on that realm. The toxicity would really ruin the game for me and did back in cata. My memory of vanilla was a tight-knit, respectable and authoratative community who punished toxic behavior and adored lovable characters. I know because I was one of the toxic players (I was 12). While I had fun and friends I also had many enemies and no ability to join a raiding guild.

I got it as a hunter. Let me last a bit longer without having to drink which was nice. And my raptor strikes hit hard for a while.

Well its expected he'd make some shit up to try to defend himself and come off less like a scum bag, but that dice is already tossed.

Druids are the best leveling tanks for dungeons but warriors surpass them once they get gear.
---
Can confirm if you make an agreement in chat then go against it, taking loot it's a 3 day ban and you lose the items.
---
Who gives a shit these are degenerate people its no suprise they do this.
---
Los.. sphhh Feral charge!
---
I had it in vanilla at this level, mostly because nobody else wanted it (as mentioned it drops basically every run), and did actually use it a long time leveling as a hunter.  Finding a good stat stick is difficult and I had much higher priority things to spend gold on than hugely marked-up AH greens.
---
I don't know about BIS but it's good enough.

Bit of an exaggeration, I've done like 6 emp runs in a row and I've only seen like 3.

Bears shouldn't be getting melee attack power from Agility in Classic, that's specifically a Cat Form thing.
---
wait, only 85.7%? So what's the point of saying '+100 to your damage/healing' when the max is 85.7%?
---
If you don't know who she is, or what rules she's breaking, why are you commenting on the issue and saying I hate women.
---
Seems like you should, kind of do some research before sounding like an ass, you know?
---
But, she's broken Twitch TOS multiple times, although this was before they added the "lets chat" category, idk if she still does.
---
Now she's allowed to sit there and spread her legs to get donos from lonely strange men. Which, yeah sure "if I was a girl I'd do it too" like you all keep saying i guess? Doesn't make it any less strange or manipulative.
---
I'm so glad we're encouraging this culture.
---
Is that the name of it
---
I'm starting to report guild billboards as spam as well. It's getting difficult to read anything in General chat as it constantly gets spammed away from every person who thinks it's their duty to let you know that there family fun kinky fun guild is welcome all players.
---
Again, I think 70 was just chosen as a high enough number to be absolutely sure it would always work.  If you set it at 63 and come out with a raid with level 64 trash, it doesnt work.  Of course, it might as easily have been a fat finger by a developer or something similar innoculous. I just doubt they had full plans for BC when that ability was written, seeing as how they originally intended to have several more zones and raids that never made it into Vanilla.
---
Dem cocaine-induced errors
---
Not everyone has played alliance their whole time on wow. It was my first time and I’m glad I didn’t have it spoiled.
---
100% right.  Asshole behavior attracts views, which attracts money.  As long as this behavior results in financial gain (and there is no sign of that ever stopping) it will continue to grow and grow.
---
This is weird for me, as Roy carried me through multiple dungeons as a low level on Faerlina. I was in Olympus 2 before server swapping, I was subbed to him on twitch and everything. Really sad to see this.
---
&gt;  The main reason for weaponskill
---
Eventually, maybe, but for now, it's absolutely because it removes the need for an extra 3% hit chance from gear.
---
blame the zoomers doing the floss to the latest autotune rap
---
I took it to mean getting ripped off by streamers and their supporters is to be expected. Who knows really
---
What that one player wants has no bearing on what blizzard will do. I’d be shocked if blizz does anything about it.
---
Right ok. The gear difference between dps and healing sort of confuses me. So for example, it would be rude to roll need on crimson fel hat as a healer I guess?
---
Ravager then Gatorbite
---
ally never do
---
Implying anyone cares
---
Why's that? I come from playing mostly Warriors and I haven't had an issue so far before 60. 
---
Ya they don't have a taunt so I won't be doing raids but there's nothing dungeons or UBRS throws at you that a Pally can't handle. Same with a Druid.
---
Ironically your example works, the guy still standing is the one robbing the bank.  Because this was a robbery.
---
It worked before the patch as well. Was just iffy to get it right.
---
Exactly this
---
I just need to AoE farm so I can AoE farm better to finally AoE farm!
---
Ty :)
---
Hahahahahahahahhahahahahaha
---
Oh. Duh. Lol.
---
Found the Olympus 58 officer.
---
I feel the same way. Thanks for putting my thoughts to word.
---
Doesn’t matter. They have something like 4K players across 4 guilds on their server. Doesn’t really matter what the general community treats them like, unfortunately.
---
people get weird about the term as if it's some personal slight
---
I tell my party to need boes. Problem solved
---
faction dominance is not fun unless you are mentally ill though

Don't talk to any canadians then because it is pretty much the default greeting.

"This dream dust, now, it's all natural, straight from the Swamp of Sorrows, and it's pure. Your vitality is at stake here! You can't NOT afford to buy Infowars Dream Fighter vitalizing powder, in a Horde that has lost its damn mind!"

Scrub I got 2 gold for a single birthday lap dance as a female gnome #onthegrind
---
magisters bracers are fine
---
How is it a robbery if the person who ordered everyone else: “Everyone greed” never said “and I will greed too.”
---
Keep trying to make excuses for dumb players who don't know that **you always need on BoEs.**
---
yeah kinda, casters already regularly have competition for their loot and really dont seek one more guy on their items.
---
&gt;LOL you still believe that “ALL FOLLOW” implies I'm following... myself! LOL
---
No. Go slowly. Take your time, please. What I said was:
---
&gt;There is an implication in your bad analogy that is not present in the actual context where there is a command being given from a perceived authority.
---
Stop making the stupid cunts famous/popular. If all of you made a decision to ignore these fuckwits, they wouldn’t have an incentive to do it.
---
&gt; I have asked in a ticket and they said they haven't yet decided and waiting for community feedback
---
Alright Reddit, let's do this!
---
You can make up your own rules of engagement but don't expect others to follow them. You wanna gank some lowbies for an hour? Go for it. You wanna kill someone who's doing an escort quest? You can! You wanna kill that gnome just because he's a gnome? Good call.
---
But if you kill a chill druid with a cute/funny name you're a monster, just letting you know.
---
so what did she do to break the rules? spreading your legs while clothed isn't against the rules
---
You’re fucking screwed dude. He’s one of the best healers in the game... still healing SM of course
---
did you find a solution for this?
---
You guys do realize what Asmongold got famous for right? Ninjaing videos...Are you surprised his friends also do it?
---
He also literally, as in actually, told people to stop ninja looting because he was getting so much mail about it and started gkicking people for it
---
u r
---
WHAT I never knew this
---
And this is why people here where so adamant about avoiding to be on the same server than the streamers.
---
There are times when forcing something to be a macro just to avoid being an addon defeats the whole purpose.  This is one of them; this is better done as an addon and is easily made to be one.
---
Yeah it's awesome we are high pop almost throughout the entire day now! If I were to guess, the balance seems to be 60/40 favoring alliance. Anytime I have tried farming, there are always a few horde around that may gank me. I think some horde just got uses to be massively dominant (like 70/30).
---
And you pretty much never will.
---
The people who raid DPS as warrior either got in early or are the raid leaders. You're better off just playing a pure DPS class if you want to actually DPS.
---
Rogue is good.
---
Probably because there aren't many casuals up there in the ranks yet. Still messing with diehards and tryhards.
---
Okay, I'm level 41, grass is always greener.
---
I meant talk more one on one. Now it’s just the first thing he can see.
---
That's a good sub full of good big milk doggies. Anyone that tortures an animals deserves to die by that animal's hands... er hooves/claws/talons/feet.
---
Have you considered that perhaps these players know this and are simply doing it for ease of leveling ?
---
What a fruit cake
---
We showed you clips and you say hes joking and were just too dumb to get it.
---
Op said 2 full levels of grinding so probably 10+ hours
---
gnome mages are more intelligent than any other mage, this is backed up by facts
---
Generally would have SW:P before Smite/Mind Blast/Wand in that rotation just because you get an extra tick from SW:P. 
---
Pull aggro with nuke and DOT immediately, then wand or keep casting (depending on your mana).
---
Between 8-10 hours, had the spot mostly empty since I killed during off-peak hours.
---
Play CSGO and you'll run into it every 2 in 3 games lol
---
I jumped down one of the waterfalls in Maraudon, and used Blink to avoid fall damage.
---
I blinked through the world, fell for 10 or 15 seconds, and then died out of reach of a rez.
---
What I have realized as a tank is I need to plan ahead quickly and always make the DPS lack behind me. It really matters getting those 5 seconds alone with the mobs.
---
Were you just pretending not to understand their confusion? Swipe has been a Cat druid ability for ages on Retail, and not everyone knows every difference between Classic and Retail. I'm 100% for not doing cleave if you don't want to, nobody can tell you how to play, but there was an obvious misunderstanding going on and either you didn't realize why they though you had swipe as cat and now you now, or you should have told them instead of going into this situation knowing it would be an issue. A lot of this kind of stuff can be avoided by just communicating better.
---
No, you're the one making ridiculous arguments. You're either really bad at English or... well, terrible at english. The implication of an accord in a group is that everyone will follow it.
---
If you go as a group to a restaurant and say "we'll have fries", you're obviously speaking for everyone, you included.
---
You're just trying to defend a scammer because you think that playing nice or being a decent human being are things for fools, I guess.
---
sitting with your legs open isn't sexual and not bannable by twitch, try again
---
Lol same thing happened to a friend and me at the same time. We kept going forward and popped back into the world out the back of SM.
---
Shhhh.
---
I'm a GM and MT, and it's quite interesting at times. I tend to be pretty chill when it comes to loot (had 2 randoms in our MC run, one of em got T2 pants from rag, the other got like...ALL the hunter loot because he was the only one anyway) and while some guildies disliked the "randos getting loot", I tend to see it as it is: You'll raid a *lot* in Classic. Does it truly matter if a handful of items doesn't immediately help you, your guild or your friends?
---
In the long term, it really doesn't. People need to chill in this regard; you can quickly ruin your reputation by ninjaing, but on the flipside you can truly make someone's day by just being fair and giving people loot when they deserve it.
---
I just don't get how people can be such dicks toward each other over something as vapid as loot - Such a petty and narcicisstic thing to do.
---
Add on called handy notes will display them and other things like dungeon entrances inns etc
---
Why make a post my on this? Why not ask in game?
---
he likely did this on retail then.
---
oh shucks, you got me! Good job, sport.

Savory Deviate Delight is a pretty popular cooking dish for fun. buy [this recipe](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6661/recipe-savory-deviate-delight) from AH; then fish in barrens for the deviate fish. sells fairly decent and is fun to use yourself.
---
Skull one, let them single Target nuke while you grab aggro on the rest. If you lose aggro on one that's low, leave it and move on. They'll kill it before it does anything.
---
So, you weren't around in vanilla then? That's not exclusive to 'streamer servers'..
---
Pointing out an anti semitic dog whistle doesn't make you anti semitic.
---
What I like about the polearm is the chance on hit can crit as well, which proves vengeance too. I used it over bonebiter and was great seeing SoC and the weapon proc
---
Just a couple hours less, living the hunter life.
---
What a fucking pathetic cringelord.  This guy's a shit sipping hand jabber monkey man.
---
&gt; If you go as a group to a restaurant and say "we'll have fries", you're obviously speaking for everyone, you included.
---
LOL now you're lying about what was said in chat. See? I knew you didn't know what you were talking about.
---
Vanilla theory crafting was a strange time.
---
I've never worried about this in the past, but as someone who sometimes pulls together a couple guildies and then pugs the other slots I'll be careful to make loot rules clear in future runs. It occurs to me now it's a lot like putting any financial agreement in writing, no matter how close you are to the other person or how common sense you think the terms are. It protects everyone and can prevent a lot of unnecessary drama.
---
This is the most boomer comment I've ever seen, to the point where I can't see it as anything but satire
---
LOL ur still seething
---
Well this is like war. If u kill them while they are lvling you are sabotaging them. They get frustrated, don't lvl as fast and your faction gets an advantage.
---
Jesus it's like he personally pissed in your cheerios or something.
---
None of you would be getting so fucking e-mad at this if this person had nothing to do with Asmongler, this kind of shit happens probably every minute and life goes on.
---
Upvoted because you spelled his name right. If only I knew his wife's name.
---
Thank you, good advice :)
---
If you did a dng with a group of friends and they said let's amm greed, would you really answer "screw you guys I don't trust a single one of you", or hit greed?
---
Because this is what most people seem to be missing. These were not randoms, they knew each other.
---
you're*
---
I used crescent staff from 19 to 30. Perfect warrior weapon.
---
You're the new love of my life. Have been playing sound muted for weeks now
---
TLDR second link: 
---
It’s ok to remove or replace existing sound files within the game files, it’s _not_ ok to take files from the game and redistribute.
---
To be honest, you shouldn't be having "AOE threat" problems because there should be no threat on non-skull marked mobs (besides the healer, but if everyone is FFing correctly they should only really be healing you and tab + sunder/demo should be more than enough for healing aggro. As a healer when the tank pulls a pack of mobs I will cast healer/greater heal and cancel it over and over till tank gets to 50-75% health , depending on the situation, before I let the heal go through). If you are doing spellcleave you shouldn't really be getting hit much or worrying about aggro much at all as any attempt for you to go into melee range will be pretty much instant death.   
---
I would suggest making a mouse-over macro for taunt though and get some sort of threat meter and threat plates too. It can help.   
---
Also you can DPS tank till lower/mid 50s. You might be able to do it later with a superb group....but I wouldn't recommend.  
---
tl;dr: Mark for FF and secondary target. Mark for CC. If someone pulls off you they generally didnt follow marking order or DPSed WAY too fast. If its a healer they were probably overhealing too fast. Threat is tricky in WoW, the rules of it must be respected for group cohesion.  GET A MOUSEOVER TAUNT MACRO THOUGH AND BIND IT. Absolute life saver.
---
Got a source on the term ninja looter being invented in classic?  I remember it being used in everquest before WoW was even released.
---
Bahaha, Good Man.

i know the feeling

He's a fucking mage too... lol.

I had 700 gold by level 59... Once you hit runecloth drops and greens that are worth 1+ gold to vendor, gold is a joke to make. This guy is just shit. So he has to resort to crap like this.
---
So edgy.
---
I believe in you. It might take you a few hours, but I'm sure you can look up the definition for "everyone".
---
&gt; I remember it being used in everquest before WoW was even released.
---
Yeah right. Don't believe ya. You got a source for that?
---
holy shit the voidwalker bike I'm dying
---
Some janky tier list put together by an unknown author with barely any justification... nah wouldn't take it as gospel. PVP yeah, PVE more of a support to Warlocks.
---
I'm a PvP player so that's mostly the angle I was considering actually
---
&gt;It's nice that you think there are separate loot rules outside of the game, but there aren't. What's programmed in the game is programmed in the game. Pure and simple.
---
No. You're incorrect.
---
Chat is not outside the game.
---
There ARE separate rules other than the roll buttons when it comes to talking about loot in chat. Blizzard enforces this. If you think the greed/need buttons are all the enforceable rules of loot in a group, you would be 100% incorrect. Blizzard has removed items from ninjas and banned players for this before.
---
wait what? how do you install wow addons with twitch?
---
Scumbag
---
"You guys know you're rage starving me, right? No rage=no threat. No threat = dead dps" on my war tank.
---
On my pally tank, it's a but more simple "pallies don't have taunt. You pull it you tank it."
---
I’m happy your a troll (not an idiot), you do you man!
---
Are you high?
---
LOL can't stand the fact that I [destroyed you in this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/db0ofl/asmongolds_officer_buys_epic_mount_with_money/f1y62ki/) and showed how much of a liar you are LMAO

The declining quality of customer service is service-sector-wide, and I strongly believe it's because everyone keeps slashing payroll budgets, whether that's cutting hours, eliminating jobs, or both.

You have picked a weird hill to die on.

Dragonkin can be skinned too! Missed out on that!
---
Still makes you a scumbag. Just because you try to scramble to fix something after getting blasted on forums doesnt make you a good guy. 
---
Asmon making that statement in the first place makes him a massive scumbag.
---
Does the increased damage output really outweigh the increased taken?
---
Fire heals
---
Not true at all. Healers are far and above more in demand than dps. Even more so at 60
---
Does anyone use AbyssUI? ow do I hide the little boxes that show up on the bottom right when you mouse of a target?
---
how do you extort someone in wow? not incredulous just curious
---
Why did u make a post? Ask Google u special snowflake.
---
Can confirm, has also happened to me as a strictly DPS warr. Anyone should be able to play any spec of their class and not get shit for it. Already had a fully leveled warrior in vanilla and a death knight in retail—I’ll tank once n a while but I’m so done with tanking this time around.
---
So everything is fixed now right? Yeah. Still a scumbag.
---
Very cool man!! Can I ask why you prefer GRID over Luna?

I'll be using this, thanks  :)

Redundant Silverback Gorilla becomes redundant!

Even without context I feel like this guy comes across as a total piece of shit. Twitch persona or not, you can just tell.
---
Everything before Naxx in Vanilla is a joke compared to the difficulty levels we've been playing with since Wrath. Nothing in Classic remotely compares to current Mythic Raids or even older things like Heroic LK. Between much much better addons and players just getting way more used to complicated mechanics over the years, the level of play is vastly different than it was during actual Vanilla.
---
u/Gistradagis is so seething, they literally can't stop pasting the same comment LOL
---
We take level 56/57 priests/paladins to MC with us, don't worry you're not missing out on anything.
---
The rule for all of vanilla and bc was everyone roll need on epic boes in my memory. No reason to risk this shit. If an expensive boe drops I immediately say I’m rolling need no matter what you all should too.
---
There's a cohesive demographic of gamers that have toxic tendrils throughout the gaming world. Think, gamergate, pepe the frog, 4chan, [Steve Bannon](https://www.wired.com/story/steve-bannon-gaming-conference-saga/), etc.
---
If this is your first time playing WoW, I STRONGLY  recommend not reading any guides and to just play the game. Pick the race and the class that seems appealing to you. Nothing is worse than picking a class that has slightly more damage output but is horribly boring to play for you. Discovering how stuff works is amazing. Just explore and have fun. The information will come to you naturally and you will enjoy it much more than trying to follow a guide or min/max. As for realms, I’m on sulfuras pvp est server. It’s incredibly well balanced for horde/alliance ratio. Strongly recommend. Enjoy!
---
There is a good shield in LBRS
---
Apparently setting loot rules in chat and breaking them is a bannable/ temp ban offense. I encourage everyone on that server to report this dude. I dont really care that he stole an in game item but i want to see his reaction when bliz takes his mount and gold away
---
And they won't remove the item in this case because the person who ordered everyone else: “Everyone greed” never said “and I will greed too.”
---
Too hard on mana when questing, but Mark, sting and an aimed shit are sustainable.
---
Nice! Thank you for sharing
---
I actually made another 25g from skinning and vendoring but decided not to send all of the skins to my alt, was a nice little bonus.
---
I have two lvl 60 and my third char is lvl 29.. Help me
---
LOL you still believe that “Everyone follow!” means that I'm going to follow... *myself*! Haha learn english before getting so cocky!
---
Millions of players, naturally scumbaggery happens and gets highlighted on reddit. I haven't seen anything related to ninjas or other shitty behavior myself. Well, aside that one guy whispering my family should die in car accident because he lost a roll...
---
I have no idea where you've been looking that doesn't at least recommend Healbot or Vuhdo for heaelrs.  
---
If you get used to using those addons, but want something more lightweight, I'd recommend Clique.  
---
It's a mouse over addon that used by healers who find the bulk config unnecessary.
---
how pathetic of a life do you live that you worship some loser streamer, honestly dude lmao I can't even imagine what that is like
---
What if you're color blind?
---
&gt;but those communities are best avoided.
---
Yes this works for every dungeon. Just don't be alliance cause alliance is hard more in classic and horde is easy mode.
---
Had to google "ninja looting term" and this was the first result. 
---
 https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Loot_ninja
---
The description at the top says:
---
"A loot ninja, AKA ninja looter or simply ninja, is a player who takes loot to which he or she is not entitled. The act is referred to as ninja looting or ninjaing. **The term predates World of Warcraft and originated with the notion of looting as quickly as possible.** The common synonym for this behavior is greeder, though that term has ironically fairer play connotations specific to WoW."
---
Why are the tampons in the door? It doesn't even make sense... Shouldn't the tampons be in his vagina?
---
Perhaps bagnon then
---
As a warrior ya k who made it 30-37 so far only tanking SM... 
---
You are at the mercy of your dps actually knowing what threat is.
---
Sad thing is threat gen is a cycle, you’re screwed if you don’t initially have aggro pulling a pack.
---
My best bet is tabbing between mobs sundering, saving taunt for when a dps inevitably is blasting an unmarked target, and throwing an extra shout when I can. 
---
Mostly you just have to explain it to your dps... a few times.
---
Unless the tank is a paladin
---
Combat mace. No diminishing returns or overlaps. Stun the world, piss everyone off, be useful in group engagements. Not the best out there, but really fun to mess with.
---
Most importantly, change your spec every now and then to get a feel for more things.
---
&gt;  People give their overlord all their gold &amp; items just so he might notice them and they will be elevated to the next best Olympus guild and "climb the ranks"
---
holy shit lmfaoooo imagine being this fucking pathetic. I don't even feel bad for these people who got ninja'd from at this point, they are probably pathetic losers if they are playing on the streamer realm and actually playing with these streamers.
---
So many people who think you need to be prot to tank ubrs lol
---
That said, if you're invited as dps and don't want to tank that's completely fine
---
Ahahah please don't ever edit or delete these comments, I'm going to use them in the future to show how seething and malding you neckbeards can get!
---
Iam not saying you should be hit by a truck but if your comment rights cease to exist nobody would mind. I mean your a shit person anyway
---
Thats how you speak btw
---
Bold of you to assume I'm not mentally ill.
---
“Sub goal: 0-5” sounds about right.
---
what is the system?
---
The first few times, yeah. You get three strikes. If he continues to do this he'll move from suspensions as punishment to a full ban. It's been that way forever.
---
Like grinding 900g isn’t that insane. What a douche
---
You're thinking of doxxing.
---
By girlfriend you mean your hands controlling night elf alt?
---
Hope Blizzard nails this trash
---
Gratz on lvl 40.  Definitely a huge milestone!
---
No. Weapon speed is normalized in classic. You want the weapon with the highest top damage in your x-y damage range.
---
😂
---
Had four hours of sleep the other day cause of it... soon it'll be done.
---
Nope, he said everyone, not the group. You're simply interpreting his words as you see fit to keep up the ridiculous idea that cheap semantics are a valid excuse for ninja looting and trolling.
---
You're almost as sad as he is.
---
Yeah, 3 warriors could have easily tanked the dungeon, Deeprot spec isn't needed before MC, and still then...
---
Ahhhh
---
Why name drop asmongold tho ? He had nothing to do what this guy did
---
I got temp ban once for agreeing to pay for a mount carry then never paid the guy haha. This is kinda the same I guess?
---
This. If the healer has aggro, peel the mob off and bring to the tank. Brings back memories.
---
*insert the more you know gif here*
---
Thank you for the knowledge.
---
You watched some parts of his stream and you expect to randomly catch him talking about ninja looting? Of course he doesnt blab about it non stop but hes said in the past as long as it helps the guild his guildies can ninja loot. There's vods of it all over this thread.
---
[*Citation needed.*]
---
The no taunt is a deal breaker for me man.
---
I know I will pull Aggro off the tank at one point in the dungeon and u less they taunt I might die :(
---
The eventually increased the drop rate on the pristine. They were going for like 800g and then the next day after the announced buff they were about 50g.
---
It was against the ToS in vanilla and classic is supposed to be vanilla-like.
---
Why are you guys woofing?
---
Buddy is seen as a derogatory term to a lot of people.  Its often said by an older person to a kid, so an adult saying it to another adult may be seen as trying to assert dominance.  
---
I personally don't like it, but I'm not going to have a stick up my ass about it either.
---
Probably a feminist.
---
Did u take this pic with a toy phone?
---
Tbh there is no context here. We don't know that OP actually only said "hi buddy" because he conveniently only took the screenshot of those two lines. For all we know OP was actually being the jerk and is farming karma from it
---
If a boss tells everyone to go home early, that's doesn't mean *he's* going home early! LMAO

You should use your own advice and just *Shhhh* LOL

Homeboy has a face for radio.  I cast Chain Lightning and all three bolts hit this dude's nose.  Dude looks like Abe Vigoda fucked the talent out of Michael Phelps.

Mfw warriors arent individual players just tanks for others convenience.

What's the PPM for the polearm?

Nahhhh my actual gf lol

Learned a while back that canned bread is a real thing. Can order it off Amazon.

Damn, week 1 60 Mage that didn't have an epic mount still? No wonder he ninja'd the gloves.

You need to be a bit more progressive.

buddy was banned last September.

3 people =/= the entire Classic playerbase

Could just farm the basilisks at the southern part of shimmering flats in thousand needles.

Why is it that toxic scum like this swarm and fester around the cesspool that is popular twitch streamers? When I open reddit on my phone, I either see Trumps face or I see Asmongolds face. I'm so fucking tired of it.

He's no one's boss. Learn to read.

Our resident leatherworker is tagged with “leather fetish” in the guild. I think its a Hunter thing..
---
I even heard Rogues do it from behind.
---
Yeah I’ve been down all those roads lol and I think that’s the sad part is that I know it’s all good. I know that people around me do actually care and that therapy really does work. That people like you who reach out don’t have other motives than just being kind. Just something in my head is broken from years and years of abuse. The happy kid was killed years ago. I’m empty and sad. But for 4 people in my life I just smile and continue to try and keep the charade going for their sake. I really try to be “normal” and I always feel like I’m just nothing. But I’m not like depressed and I never think of dying or that people would be better off without me. I just suck lol but your good, stay good.
---
Hit is your best friend as an orc warrior, the tooth of eranikus has a bit lower dps but has +1% hit and is another decent option
---
Righto champ

I dunno about you, but I enjoy the RP elements of a game...

Half his fanbase are teenagers.

You're certainly a shining example of that rule

No, he and his guild got caught ninjaing big ticket items and now hes backpedaling to save face. If you are the largest classic streamer and you say it's okay for your guildies to ninja, it doesnt suddenly make it okay when he backs up and says the opposite. 
---
So hes a scumbag. Not just for that reason either.
---
Asmongold and his band of tweens are losers, this does not surprise me in the slightest.
---
Why not implement the retail system? Would it really be that bad? Needing on a BoE will make it soulbound, but greeding will keep it BoE.
---

He said he used to do that now he is kicking people for it

I’m not at the computer to mess around with this but try:

/stopmacro [pet:voidwalker]
---
/cast Summon Voidwalker
---
Dude I’m 37 lol you’re fine
---
Asmon literally told people to do this before classic came out.  He said to ninja from people to increase the power level of the guild he was going to create.
---
I posted this today - there is alot of quest bugs.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dazy46/should_blizzard_fix_bugged_quests_or_nochanges/
---
He doesn't know LOL
---
At least you're honest about it :)
---
Have my upvote!
---
That’s a giant fucking nose.
---
Agreed... I guess I'm glad I don't watch this dweeb. Typical obnoxious garbage.
---
Tell them your picking isn’t high enough, and loot the chests after the run. They are your chests. No one else can open them.
---
Frostreaver Crown is going for 3-5g on horde side of server. Y'all think that is low ?
---
It's very telling that you can't admit that **he was the leader of the group** because **they all listened and did as he said.**
---
LOL pretending like there wasn't an obvious power imbalance in the party LMAO
---
Take your own advice and *Shhhh.*
---
This is wrong, 14 ap = 1dps. So itll be 7*wpn speed so if you are using a 2.8 wep (dal rend mh) that's 20dmg added during the duration.
---
What did he do ?
---
Awwww look at him still pretending 😂
---
The perfect gnome to be a member of “rollin with my gnomies” 
---
Awesome name AND outfit, the whole fit man!
---
Hypothetically speaking, you're a dumbfuck.

The worst part is how common it is these days. Makes me disappointed in humans.

Dot forget the stam!

"I watched Asmon for 0.003 milliseconds and it was precisely at the moment he ninja'd a piece of gear".

Suuuuuure guys.

\#ROYBOYS STAND UP
---
Woooooooow
---
Wait what?
---
Suppose not. The state of the community kinda depresses me tbh.
---
lol same. someone talking about how its "talking down" to them.
---
Although i refuse to stop calling people buddy.
---
“Reconsider how you talk to people”
---
Can this PLEASE be a copy pasta for this sub lmfao
---
At least you you’re top deeps for the screenshot
---
Gnomes have micropenises, this is backed up by facts.
---
Give them the mats for the transmute, and then once the guy had the mats, they say they won't give you the transmuted bar unless you pay them extra.
---
Have to assume the debuff slots weren't all full
---
What a piece of trash
---
Excuse my language, but what a fucking cunt.
---
Lightning Bolt costs 265 mana. With both cost reduction talents, this averages out to 215 mana per cast. If you have 5k mana, that means you can cast for about 45 secs before oom.
---
This isn't really the rotation Elemental Shaman use (they don't use their procs for Lightning Bolt, for example), but it should showcase the problem.
---
Thank you for the tip &lt;3 will keep that in mind next week!
---
I’m not saying that his reaction is good, but many people, myself included, don’t like to be addresses with buddy. It feels condescending.
---
I could be wrong but I thought that video was from classic, so it is at MOST a month old.  Still hoping he sticks to his guns and kicks/blacklists this guy for his actions.
---
You stupid bitch
---
This was the biggest mistake in vanilla, people assumed sets were good. In almost all cases no set pieces are good, especially casters due to no spell power. Do some googling for warlock pre-bis.
---
Are you going to jump off the bridge later?  I heard someone told you to do so.
---
Because I can 100% have access to the chest without the group.
---
&gt;roll need
---
&gt;can't get ninjad
---
&gt;wow what a world to live in
---
Doesn’t have to affect him long term, but it could affect him in the short term for his streaming career.
---
Aimed shits can kill anything.  That, or mobs will feign death to avoid being hit with them.
---
Just watched his stream for a bit... good lord... this guy is a loser.
---
I did use it was Macroed in with arcane power and trinket.
---
So you’re watching his stream and giving him attention it would seem?
---
Incendius is an eastern server it's pretty nice imo
---
important rule in life, never interrupt a man while he's fishing
---
Can feral druid tank most things? Everything I see for tanking is warrior but I loved bear tanking in wotlk and thought I would have success. My main issue is threat at this level but I'm wondering if at higher levels it'll by my lack of block and party plus I can get crit unlike warriors at 440. If not I might just restart on my warrior cuz I love tanking. Thanks
---
Feels like more of the latter in retail, tbh
---
Hey hey ! It still takes skills to play !! I swear !
---
now add getting to the chest with the help of your party. Stop being greedy.

Ninjaing aside, this is one ugly motherfucker. I guess now he has a mount to keep his right hand company.

Gold farming isn't as hard as people used to believe.  Plenty of people who know what they're doing have large piles of dispensable cash at this phase.

Man these are so awesome!

Have you ever considered doing a Visual-Novel type of thing? I mean you couldn’t really make money off of it but fan projects are always fun

I've played a couple hours a day every day since launch. Some days I get a solid 6-8 hours if kids and wife permit. I'm level 41.
---
Bigglesworth has been good for me.
---
I'm not slow, I just avoid doing dumb stuff with a healer with 10% mana to avoid wipes.  
---
Sometimes, with run times, 1 single wipe wastes more time than a slow tank being overly cautious for an entire dungeon run.
---
Im gonna reset every dungeon after im done now
---
This isnt some spell I went to a NPC and clicked my mouse.
---
And mages can without making water if they want to, it isnt their job to provide randoms in the group with free service.
---
If you don't care about time zone Fairbanks is high pop, queues were long as shit to start like everyone else, but the queue is down to about 15 minutes during peak time. It's pacific time zone, so you'd actually log in before peak time usually, I would guess.
---
The robe is BIS until Phase 4 and even then potentially 5. It's really up to you, but it's a great piece. The question is the does the mount move the needle vs your BIS?
---
Join a guild for easier access to raids. Aside from that, someone is always going to want a shaman for raids because of windfury totem. Later game dungeons were an absolute nightmare to get into if you weren't a spellcleave class. That shit was annoying.
---
inb4 PvP happened on a PvP server
---
Yeah, that's my end goal. As with Imp Righteous Fury, I wouldn't really say it's needed unless you are finding yourself with threat issues. But Salv on the DPSers usually fixes that. Imp Retribution Aura is really nice too for holding threat. Drop down max rank consecrate on initial pull, and use lower rank consecrates after that to keep up threat while AoEing. Half of pally tanking is having a party who knows how pally tank works. If someone instantly opens up on the enemy as soon as you pull before you have a chance to build threat, you're going to have a bad time.
---
Mages charge for water...
---
and you wouldnt be able to get to it without them
---
clear the dungeon yourself next time
---
Nah, it belongs to the group. It took the group to get there.
---
Again, your example case isn’t what i’m talking about at all. I literally said i’m talking about tank and healer gear going to the tank/healer
---
Ouch...
---
You’re aware just because you click need doesn’t mean the item is yours? So if warrior needs and wins the roll against you then yes you can get ninjad
---
Does it proc on aoe like it did on private servers?
---
I'd never use it for straight DPS, but on aoe packs I'd think it's easily bis.
---
This is utterly disgusting and so badly why I wanted to avoid the streamer server. 
---
Fuck you Roysun.
---
Just be aware that BRD, LBRS, UBRS, and MC has mobs immune to fire.
---
Listen to this guy. I wish i could've gone back in completely blind. Play what you enjoy that's what matters.  Except a gnome
---
ugh attention whoring manbaby
---
That's an extremely low level recipe though and doesn't really apply to someone asking about 300 level cooking.
---
Kids a fucking loser
---
I don’t care. The people who got tricked into ‘rolling greed’ because he said so deserve what they got. 
---
This is a fifteen year old game and these ‘all roll greed’ ninja stories are very old and worn out. 
---
Survival of the fittest, people. If you’re stupid enough to roll greed because some nerd told you to, then sucks to be you. 
---
So to clarify; if some nerd arranged a group/raid and announces that we all must ‘greed’ if a specific lucrative item drops, YOU LEAVE. Or tell him to shove it up his ass.
---
Got the Dark Whelpling on the fourth kill while doing the Fiery Blaze quest. I’m going to make her watch me kill Onyxia and Nefarian.
---
"I haven't used multishot" = "I haven't used multishot in the last fight where the sheep got opened."
---
Of course you will find multishot in the overall damage. It is part of the hunter rotation, even on single target, in case you did not know. The screenshot from the current fight that proves the hunter wrong would have been nice.
---
What boots and shoulders?
---
Priests can dispel
---
Run more dungeons, look up the loot info and see which dungeons have which pieces you want.
---
Yea sorry you’re way off on your description of these terms. See my comment below. 
---
An asshole is not an asshole by choice either. A sociopath is indeed just an extreme asshole who also happens to be lazy enough to get things dishonestly. That’s all it is.
---
Elementals are immune, at least they are to Warlock's Immolate.
---
No matter how well you tank it's like you are constantly fucking up. That's why people don't like to do it.
---
funny how you claim all things things yet have 0 proof for it
---
Should be saving that money for a mount anyway
---
This was never an argument about morality or what his motivation was for saying no ninja looting. The guy above said he supports it despite the fact that he's kicking people out of the guild for it. That's the whole debate lol.
---
On a side note you can't seriously compare stealing irl to ninja looting a piece of gear in an easy ass game designed for keyboard turning clickers with shitty internet connections lmao.
---
This isnt a greed thing. What about blacksmiths that took time AND  money?
---
Youre literally saying "SHARE THE LOOT YOU GREEDY ASSHOLE!!! I WANT THE LOOT TOO!"
---
Guess who's now going to reset all instances after a full run when a rogue couldn't unlock? Me.
---
As a fellow netherwind good to know to blacklist them
---
I feel like I absolutely need to reroll on whatever server has this name left and propagate the memes
---
If they're dumb enough to go to that website then by all means go for it.
---
they have the same problem; leather int gear is geared toward resto. they have go fight in a dress if they want +dmg with epics
---
Huh???  Are you talking about Ravager?  Or are you /s
---
At which level did you start to farm pre 60?
---
What a POS
---
Wheres the line? Literally non existent.
---
It's not always automatically bad. I had this "tryhard" moment while leveling in Arathi. Elite quest in ogre tower in that fortress SW. Ogres just kept multiplying and never despawning. I think I counted 17x elite ogres who'd aggro in packs of 5 if you moved unstealthed. I wanted to believe there to be way to do the mission (looting 3 items) so I just tried pulling them stubbornly 10 times. 30 minutes of that later they all mass despawned and I could do it no problem. Smart approach would've been to abandon quest and gtfo, but sometimes you have to believe in your stubborn ways. Not a perfect comparison to this situation, but I do sometimes act on principle level too where it doesn't make perfect sense but it *feels* right.
---
I'm a Bs and I make keys for chests, I'll judge it in if the group is friendly or not, if a rogue is in the group then I'll let them sort it out, Understandably if my group are not friendly I'll tell them anyone who can open It can take the loot, then if no one opens it I'll open and loot it, had a rogue once say wait until we finish the boss b4 he would pic it , 3 mobs away!... Obviously he wanted to take it, so I just opened it and told the crew to roll, they were a good group a guys..
---
I don't think it's so much about people being mean to tanks, I think it's the fact that tanks are sort of the focal point of the group. The tank has to make decisions for the group. All eyes are on you, there's a lot of responsibility. 
---
When people are surveyed about their fears, public speaking is a more common fear and ranked more highly than death itself. I think that tanking is sort of the WoW dungeon equivalent to public speaking. DPS just need to sit back and follow the tank. Similar to the healer. There's no decisions you need to make if you don't want to. 
---
Healers have some responsibility as well, but eyes aren't on you in the same way. Healing is like the person backstage running the lights and sound effects. Very important, and if you fuck up people will know. But at least your aren't on stage. The DPS are like the audience members, just enjoying the show. 
---
So sure, getting booed for a poor performance as a tank sucks, but it's super rare. People aren't anxious about the audience throwing tomatoes, they're really just anxious about standing up there in front of all of those people.
---
If you are pugging - no. 
---
If you have a 'proper' guild - sure, I don't see it being a problem. Talk it over with your guild though.
---
If you have a 'cutting-edge, progression, world-first' guild - more no than yes.
---
Really, you need to talk to your guild leader/raid leader. I know there may be 1 or 2 fights were a warrior needs to be the MT I can't recall which ones though, due to the sheer amount of damage that comes through. But it's not that common.
---
Can asmongold shit stay on his own sub? How is his drama always on this sub? Why is it “classic wow”?
---
You know if you're moving and you junp, you can turn and use abilites while still traveling through the air and then turn before hitting the ground and keep moving?
---
I see this Asmongold name fly by when I search for wowclassic on YT. I see those titles and thumbnails and avoid those videos at all costs.
---
Why is this person popular? Is he a streamer of mainstream games or something?
---
I really can't quite comprehend why this gets so much attention. This is a loser and he'll get his ugly ass banned with 1 substantiated report. Why all the extra drama? Just avoid their content.
---
This happened to me today, dude complained when me and 2 other guildies rocked up to fight for the arena..
---
Solo lvl 43 Mage starts whining that we suck, fuck us..  funny thing was if he was half decent at the game he still would of had a chance at the chest - Alliance rocked up and we got the last one down to 5-10% without touching the Mage. Could have either gone for the kill (Paladin with no LoH or Bubble) or even attempted to Polymorph the Pally and just go for it..
---
Typical alliance, griefing in pvp because they can’t pvp fairly
---
&gt; You’re aware just because you click need doesn’t mean the item is yours?
---
Really? Then why does this thread exist. If everyone rolls need no one gets ninja'd. This isn't fucking rocket science.
---
But you can.  I run with an arms warrior all the time in UBRS.
---
I will now be forever skeptical of people saying “all greed” in parties and raids. I will speak up and say “no - if we all need, then there’s no room for fuckery” and see who tries to argue that point.
---
Yes mage bad, tank good. Jesus christ this is literally a daily post here.
---
I swear if  u message  someone you shouldn't be  able  to  ignore them  right away.  Im  so  tired  of this shit  talking  then  insta  ignoring.
---
Hey, I'm in that guild!
---
&gt; I wouldn't want to raid with him.
---
I would. I haven't had anyone to raid with since early Cata.
---
No kidding. Who shit in his cereal?
---
Situational. Nothing annoys me more than groups that refuse to single target in live strat. Mobs just heal until mage is oom and it takes three times longer.
---
Don't gotta cc everything, just attack skull. It all dies faster and there is less downtime between pulls.
---
Dungeons.
---
There are some quests that give decent rewards, but you really should be running each dungeon a couple of times.
---
You may want to install Atlas loot as that will show you what dungeons are available and their loot.
---
Doubt it will for streamers.
---
Feels clunky stretching like that. Why not just use ` 1-4 q w e r a s d f with shift and alt modifiers?
---
Took them hours to get the levels too, you can level yours from grinding or just stumbling on them. If you don't have the skill, nobody cares; if you do, then you can contribute that skill to the group. You benefit from leveling it for yourself anyways, plenty of locked boxes around I can't open. Dungeons are about working together, working for yourself just means nobody wants to party with you.
---
As the tank you are the default leader. They follow you and your rules, if they pull extra or undermine you, they can get fucked.
---
Wow, someone that actually share the same opinion lol.
---
Funny how they dont see how greedy they look when they want part of loot they had no chance of getting without me.
---
Last week I was running west in Elwynn and passed a lvl 19 hunter running in the opposite direction.  The guy’s name was Messycarl and he was playing a female character with long white hair.  (Disclosure: the “messy” part of his name was really something different, but to avoid dogging on someone it has been changed for the purposes of this post, but basically his name had a different word synonymous with “messy”
---
Anyway I pass the guy and thinking it funny that his character had nice hair despite his name signifying something of the opposite meaning, I send him a tell “You comb your hair nice” as a very lame joke and harmless banter.
---
He comes back with “I see you have your douchface on”
---
This surprised me a bit, so said “woah woah so angry”
---
He replies “Imagine hitting on someone in a video game because it’s a female character”
---
Whaaaat?  So I was like “dude, first off your name is frigging carl, and secondly you have “messy” in your name so I was just trying to make a joke.
---
Long story short, it didn’t go well or for much longer after that, but we both basically came to the agreement that he was a jackass.
---
There are some real pieces of work out there (kinda like real life).
---
Devilsaur is simply way too valuable. You shouldn’t even replace it with raid gear until you get gloves AND pants

anyone having trouble loggin in? ive been getting dc'ed all day and its not my internet

Got that deathwing look going
---
Live2win
---
Thats a pretty greedy outlook lol
---
Uldaman is often a place where you find this because of the high level range between the start and the end of the dungeon. If the tank is on the lower end of the scale, say 42, they'll have a really really tough time hitting and maintaining threat on the last half of the dungeon where the monsters are upwards of 4 levels higher than him!

Well you see,  there's an item that you can easily farm up a few of that should help with that. It's good for pulling if you find a group that will let you tank too. You just need to...

&gt;His **rare pet** died so many times. I did it deliberately to try and make it abandon him.

I'm not sure anyone ever said they were more fun. The game as a whole is far more fun. But the rotations themselves, not really. I don't think they're fun in retail either mind you, but at least you're using more spells in the actual rotation.

That's about it, only thing retail has over Classic. It's so minor though, it's just stupid.

lmao i was in this group and ended up dropping before they started UBRS because he just sort of sprung it onto us after doing Test of Skulls.

i read this exchange live to my friends in discord.
---
"Bud" is worse than buddy, IMO. I had a situation at work where I supervised someone 20 years older who flat out told me he wouldn't respect me because I was younger and earlier in my career and he outranked me, but the supervisor put me in charge of the team. 
---
I got a "hey bud" every day as low grade passive aggression. But I wouldn't take those issues out on a stranger.
---
If there were any systems in place that allowed you to communicate with the other faction in-game, and/or retaliate directly against your faction members for providing your location to the enemy, I'd be fine with it. Since the game goes to some lengths to prevent both of those things, it strikes me as being in the same category of behavior as something like bracket manipulation in fighting game tournaments - people who are entered as competitors are colluding for mutual benefit in an out-of-game way that their opponents can't  reasonably combat.
---
If you won’t pick my boxes I won’t heal you.  It took me days to level up my character and gear it to be good enough to heal a dungeon full of mongoloids so pick my boxes and I’ll head you :)
---
This has to be a publicity stunt. I sure hadn’t heard of this clown before.
---
Why crop so much and not show the rest of the rolls? I bet 100% everyone rolled need as they should. It's an epic boe, if you don't roll need you're an idiot.
---
Ah so nobody cares about a skill unless they know they can benefit from it? Thats not greedy at all!

Arguing that there’s been an increase in rude players =/= arguing that the entire playerbase is toxic

Hmm that's weird because warriors have 2 DPS specs. I'd rather people play what they enjoy; it's a game, not a job.

Coming from the guy with some salt about not being able to take all the locked loot while grouped, that's a rich statement.

He was exiled cause he freed a very honourable orc.

Did you have an addon to track the number of kills? If so, what addon is it? Would like to DL it myself. 
---
Cheers
---
Yeah I get that, and that’s cause people don’t know how tanking worked in classic. It definitely had nothing to do with 2h axes but that’s what everyone is doing, then they get mad cause they feel like that are fucking up. No one taunts, no one pulls aggro off healers, they just run in and dps. That’s not how it worked. If people would actually try to tank, they would realize how easy it is.
---
Oh, so I guess the guy will have to join one of the other 10 Olympus guilds.
---
Not like they vet applicants.
---
I didn’t even notice that, was trying to wrap my head around why I liked Classic over Retail.. I raided a bit of Mythics aswell and it’s probably one of the biggest reasons i disliked it - the game felt so stupid having a boss on farm in Normal and Heroic + having spammed LFR at some point before I even got challenged the slightest..
---
It was essentially Diablo style gameplay imo, and when you consider loot nowadays thats probably the perfect example.
---
Mythic was cool, having 4 versions of the same boss less so in a gear based game..
---
Fights: Mexx in Naxx shield wall is REQUIRED or the tank will die.
---
Failed streamer? https://www.twitchmetrics.net/channels/popularity
---
Go for it, most alliance are 12-15 so you will have your mount in no time
---
Hold your multi shot until a mage has started blizzarding/nova etc
---
As a desto warlock, I watch the tank pull and then count to 5 before I open so I dont immediately pull aggro. Usually end up pulling aggro anyway but atleast things melt ):

You wouldn't have had a chance at it either without the other 4 people in there.

Checkmate.
---
Wasn't for gold he did it for attention and he's getting it. Controversy moves the needle in 2019.
---
I have big hands and using modifiers is just an extra unneeded step.
---
So you want me to spend literal gold so that you can just take everything inside? Blacksmiths spend hundreds of gold to level as well as gold to make the key. 
---
Everyone leveled. This is like me saying i refuse to sinister strike. Stop comparing spells to literal professions that are not needed to progress though the game
---
If youre 60 I assume youre going to heal. If im 60, you dont assume i have lockpicking maxed
---
True. But you get to have the rep bar maxed out...and that does scratch the ocd itch in some people.

This guy is a piece of shit. His apologies are so shallow. What a shit bag.
---
Rogues have stealth fucking idiot
---
Deciding between this and Bigglesworth. Thank you!
---
He tricked the group into greeding so that he could take the item by needing, despite that all members of the group had an equal claim on it. The idea is that they all click green and the game decides who wins, in hindsight you would say "everyone need" so that nobody has the opportunity to screw over the other players by doing what he did..
---
Since he was in a position of trust the group did what he said and pressed greed, only to get screwed by it. By doing that he just committed an act of selfish greed at the expense of his party members, so that he could get an easy ticket to some gold.
---
Assuming he sold the gloves for 400g he owes each party member 80g, but it seems he doesn't have any respect for his party members, nor does he have any shame or remorse in screwing them, sad.
---
Everyone forgot that rogues have the stealth ability oops
---
Oh look, it’s another one of these threads. I’m all out of lotion though, if anyone has some to spare I’d really appreciate it.
---
I like the camel toe effect too! &lt;3
---
Don’t do this, do not feed mages already massive egos
---
Dismiss pet before jumping off of a ledge, don't use multishot if there are CC'd mobs near the target, leave pet on passive in dungeons and turn growl off.
---
That'll be enough to get you started!
---
They do, they use literal gold to open the chest, but hey, you want the loot for free.
---
I talked about them already, but i doubt you read the post
---
Because I have no idea what they're referring to?
---
Disenchantment bro!
---
KillTrack
---
Great for little things like this.
---
Assuming equal skill, who wins a 1v1
---
warlock vs ele shaman
---
warlock vs enhancement shaman (statistically who would be favored)
---
They can’t win, most their player base is too young and their racials are bad
---
But *why* would you watch him if that was the case?
---
&gt; Lmao I'm not hating on anybody, I'm just not a retarded fanboy
---
I always cringe on the inside whenever I see someone advertising "AOE group for ZF/Cath!  **Up to xx XP/hr!**"
---
Like, did you just directly rip that from the title of the streamer's youtube video?
---
started happening to me the last hour, Bnet DCing and kicking me from game.  Last DC is didnt boot me but everyone was running in place in Org for about 10 mins before i had to force close the client.
---
For whatever reason this also deletes like the last 30 seconds of guild chat.. really annoying when the guild is having a discussion..
---
For a mage?
---
yea, ive gotten few, now i cant at all
---
So wands are treated as a "ranged attack". And anything that modifies that will help wands. For example wands actually scale with agility, and a quiver's modifiers will actually modify a wand.
---
&gt;On a side note you can't seriously compare stealing irl to ninja looting a piece of gear in an easy ass game designed for keyboard turning clickers with shitty internet connections lmao.
---
You quite certainly can, especially given that there is a real life value to rare items and gold in any mmo. That's also before you consider that the game is a large time investment. Time = money. I don't see how the easiness of the game is at all relevant. People invest time and money into the game. If you can't see how they are the same thing then that says alot about yourself.
---
You may not have been calling anyone's morality into question but your phrasing definitely made it seem as though you were defending Asmon. Like, "it's OK because he's changed." maybe that's not what you meant, but then why would you jump to his defense like that?
---
I believe that the extra threat multiplier applies to demoralizing shout in defensive stance.  I think it is better to charge, switch to def stance, demo shout.
---
Source: straight out of my ass.
---
Just let em die - I fing hate shamans that think they should be tanking.
---
No you don't. You need if you actually need it you fucking disgrace.
---
Funny cause I have the opposite issue my man, I realllllllly want to play Tank - I hate DPS and have been a tank in WoW + every other game for over a decade now..
---
But my guild wants me to DPS most likely.
---
You trained lock picking didn't you...? It literally benefits you outside dungeons.
---
Step one:  Don't be a Mage.
---
Fuck that guy
---
It could be that on retail Trade chat is entirely full of alt-right incels.
---
I'm not surprised by any of this.
---
is there no keyring in classic?
---
Can you explain how else could you feel, I assume you are comparing it with retail which I never played.
---
Thx
---
I'm a shaman in heal specc and level 50. I want to go BRD. Is level 50 alright for a healer or will I not be able to find groups?
---
Good thing you don't need to be good to run UBRS.
---
There is no keyring.
---
Yet.
---
Its coming.
---
Soon(TM)
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=294460/keyring-coming-to-wow-classic-in-first-patch-after-launch
---
googled "asmongold ninja looting on stream". 1st three results, like 30 seconds
---
Not related to WoW, but I can't believe the amount of people who can disrespect public restrooms or even workplace restrooms.  Those same people who do shit like leave paper towels on the floor after they miss the garbage are the same people who complain about work being a dirty piece of shit.
---
Don't underestimate how many people want to be ninjas
---
Sorry this is **** I took **** Reddit account I was just joking!
---
That's some blessed RNG right there.
---
Yeah could definitely be worth an investment.
---
You're going to get people saying red=dead. Those same people will tuck their dick in between their legs and run when they see a high level player. 10 minutes later on the forums, red=dead.
---
Agreed. Take the non-greedy approach and let the rogue (or blacksmith with key) have what they worked for.
---
Facts... Nothing but facts.
---
i get that while leveling and i was the same way for the most part, my main gripe is with people who i see raid geared and 60 running away while getting ganked when others try to help them
---
No he rolls need on all gear that's an upgrade
---
I was expecting a piece of shit and i got served well.
---
Saying what? That the meme doesn't exist? Or that in the the most popular entertainment medium in the world, you can find people that will say most anything to get a rise out of strangers on the other side of a screen?
---
People invest way too much in these characters. Trolls could easily take down a realm's community. Then they move to the next realm while others dont.
---
Imo I dont know how games communities aren't already ruined by streamers and their psychophants tilting the experience on a massive scale. Only way I see being fair is just being matter of fact about it and having strict golden rule. Leaving it open to online forums just means the most dedicated players are going to go online and have discussions over this. It's much easier and worth it for blizzard to staff up on GMs as needed. 
---
And you dont fight trolls on their turf.
---
Also when classic was designed and experienced we didn't have people all over the world who were paid to troll. Not only troll but live stream video troll. So what happens when its lulls city to ninja loot or have your psychophants give away in game locations and endlessly grief.
---
This is why when I make a group my policy is everyone need on BOE blues and epics. I state it up front, it makes it impossible to ninja, and the only way someone doesn't get a fair shot is if they don't follow the rule.
---
Same. I always say my lockpick isn't high enough and I never go back for it. It's generally garbage and if it's not, I'll never know.
---
I bought a lot of stuff off the AH. Just check it frequently, and make sure you have a vendor price add-on. Lots of people sell greens just above vendor. A 1g 50s chest piece isn't bad at all if it vendors for 1g 25s when you are done with it.
---
If you don't really spam dungeons, it can be a bit tough to get full gear from them. And even then, there are some pieces that just won't drop. You will almost definitely have better gear than otherwise if you dungeon farm, but it can get a bit boring and isn't for everyone.
---
If you're pulling off the tank then you get blessing of salv. You can generate a lot of threat with Paladin and a judgement is usually enough to act as a taunt if aggro is had by a DPS.
---
Taunt isn't needed in the dungeons, I only had the odd mob lose aggro to a mage casting Blizzard and a judgement and a auto attack is usually all that's needed to gain aggro back.
---
My guess as well.
---
People who prefer alliance are usually under the age of 15
---
I wasnt added to the group to pick locks.... If I was, It would be stated before hand.
---
You wouldnt kick me for saying "sorry not high enough". Youd just go eh and move on. why? 
---
BECAUSE YOU HAD NO CHANCE IN THE FIRST PLACE. YOU DIDNT CARE UNTIL IT BENEFITED YOU.,
---
Wow, you played the game.
---
You're so dense, dude.
---
Seems like all the keen PVPers go horde.
---
I actually think you did well.
---
This other dude just salty af
---
I was tanking scholo as a warrior at 60 tonight. 2 mages and a warlock as dps. One of the mages died 7 times because he refused to not aoe every pull immediately after I pulled. (No one else but him died)
---
The hell is a horlock?
---
Given that streaming is his job, it actually may.
---
So? He is a dick but nobody ever got banned for ninjalooting. It is part of the game.
---
Absolutely no reason to go full raid spec before 60.  For leveling, nothing is more efficient than straight affliction drain tanking.  I'm really getting a kick out of everyone that only played on pservers and were posting that leveling with VW was the way to go.  VW has always been a noob trap; it holds no agro and does crap damage.  Full affliction with either succy on auto-attack to save mana for dark pact or imp on passive for stamina and mana battery has always been the best way.
---
How do u have 36g at lvl 33 lol. I feel poor with 20g at 32 now
---
Horde like you are the reason I camp yeti cave. Stupid generalizations hurt the community.
---
and classic being a full reroll only amplifies this.
---
tfw a Mage has to ninja loot a BoE epic just to get their mount.
---
If the mage charges for water during a run, find a new mage.    
---
If the rogue charges to unlock garbage during a run, find a new mage.    
---
The tank isn't charging you to keep aggro, because he farms at half your rate when solo.  You're not paying his repair bill.      
---
The healer isn't charging you for reagents for group buffs, or making you chip in for the water to heal you.  They also farm at half your rate.    
---
It's kinda your job.  Cost of doing business.  
---
Best of luck out there.
---
I dig it
---
i played horde from vanilla to MoP and am on grob aswell, but alliance side
---
the alliance are decent and there are definitely people who fight which is a good thing (probably not so good if i can remember the few by name lol), but you still see the typical alliance stereotype of them being afraid of pvp and backpedaling from any horde player
---
&gt; but then why would you jump to his defense like that?
---
Because people talk out of their ass all the time on this sub when they don't even watch the stream just because they have a hate boner for him. I don't defend him personally because I don't know him personally, I just watch the stream occasionally because I like WoW. I saw someone talking out of their ass and I responded.
---
&gt; If you can't see how they are the same thing then that says alot about yourself.
---
Stealing something involves taking something that you do not own from someone who does own it in a way that can actually harm their life in a significant manner. I've known people who were seriously fucked over by being robbed.
---
Ninja looting a virtual item involves rolling need on something THAT NOBODY OWNS. Additionally, whether you win or not, your life will not change. Maybe you don't have the item you wanted, so what? The game is so easy, you can clear the content and enjoy the game without it. It makes no significant difference in your life. If anything, people ninja looting shit in my runs has made the game more enjoyable because the rest of us in the group can bond over what an asshole that guy is and I made friends that I might not have otherwise.
---
If you really think they are at all comparable you need a reality check. You can't compare having a few hours wasted by someone ninja looting to someone stealing your car, your identity, etc. Y'all take this game way too seriously lol.
---
Oh but they plan on being the top pvp guild so it's TOTALLY special
---
They're spending 300-500g on BiS items. Gear to progress their character in this phase.
---
That's much different than spending 300-500g on a cosmetic item this early in the game.
---
I did not have to do it to level. 
---
Unlike mage water, which comes with playing the game.
---
&gt; You can only get this experience in Classic.
---
Can you though? Like do you guys actually believe this? That retail is some sort of Mad Max-esque version of the game where everyone is insane and out for your blood? 
---
Cmon.
---
So if there's an Engineer in your group who has a charge that can open the chest, everyone should roll and the engi should open it for the winner?
---
Blmao server best server
---
Not in dungeons at this point, at least on my server. Dunno if others are any different. I can post a transcript of LFG channel tomorrow (it's obviously pretty empty atm), it's always full of LF tanks/dps.
---
&gt;That isnt even a screenshot of this offense.
---
So you just...what, have no reasoning skills what so ever?
---
Ganklethorn Vale, we call it.
---
Up next, Asmongold reviews reddit hate thread.
---
-cheers
---
WOAAAAH SO FAST!
---
I jump for dramatic effect.
---
I really don't understand the entire "everyone should greed" idea. Like are people actually that retarded? If there is an item like that, which you don't want to need/greed on properly then you should tell everyone to need.
---
Yea... it kinda sucks. I mainly play alliance and you are absolutely right. Hopefully you don't get downvoted to shit lol
---
It's a utility, it's really only useful to the user except in a few cases as you can always just rest between groups. I have it and haven't leveled it because I usually have enough supplies to not need to use it.  
---
And if a rogue doesn't have it leveled that's fine, I'll just be double checking my party now to make sure everyone leaves dungeons and resetting with rogues who didn't. I hadn't realized assholes held this mindset that the loot is automatically theirs in a group environment.
---
Every post you guys make about this clown is just boosting his streams popularity. He is sitting at hundreds of viewers now compared to maybe a few dozen before. I know he's a huge piece of shit but all you're doing is literally rewarding his behavior.

---
Not saying people don't have the cash on hand. It's the fact that there's SO MUCH more after your epic mount to spend money on to progress your character vs cosmetic pets.
---
I'll pick your box if you head me baby
---
I sold a bunch of stuff on the AH for the first time. logged in the next day and was feeling super rich. Went to check how much a whelp pet was and realized how poor I was. At least i can afford all of my skills now!
---
I have read in a bunch of places that this is not correct and that wands do not scale with basically anything. Agility does increase your wand crit rate, but ranged ap and such does not increase the damage.
---
Was this on Staghelm?
---
I play a Tauren shaman on a big ol Kodo so I'm used to alliance backpedaling a bit
---
Get the twitch app and look for YouTube to show you how. It’s pretty awesome, I just found out about it
---
Buckle up friend it took me 4 days for my Dark  Whelpling but I absolutely love it.
---
Believe what?  That it's ok to be a horrible person as long as you are playing a video game?
---
I too hit 40 on my priest and went and made a rogue alt to not burn out! Enjoying it so far!
---
not like chests ever have anything good in them anyway.
---
Sounds like you're just upset they get the last word in. My advice would be to not give a shit what people say, if someone would shit talk me I'd laugh to myself and not even reply.
---
Just because you're old, doesnt mean you get to treat them like shit. Gen X dont even recognize you people as human beings, because you are too caught up talking about your glory days and what your favorite Kevin bacon movie is. 
---
You arent striking a nerve, you just get on everyone's nerves.
---
Can't reset if they don't leave. I don't believe you can reset if you're not leader.
---
Could you clear to that chest on your own?  Everyone and their brother is an engineer, I'm sure there is a seaforium charge somewhere.  You make it really hard to want to bring a rogue along at all.  What other utility do you bring other than dps?  You have unreliable cc, mostly only single target damage ..  good single target damage but still limited.  You can do one other thing and you want to charge a fee or what?  Mages cc, decurse, make your food and water,... usually will port a group for free even though the stone cost them 20s... they can aoe and single target just fine.  You should get special treatment though right?
---
What an actual piece of shit
---
Enjoy wasting your time for an arbitrary currency while the rest of us horde have fun
---
My server is opposite. 50/50 but Horde gank, like really gank...never a fair fight. Always multiple people on just 1 lowbie.
---
You know what's really sad? You spent the last 3 hours or so scrolling through this thread and talking about how "seething" people are.
---
You're pathetic.
---
Was it a chore for you then? You're describing it like you're not playing a video game by choice.
---
It's details.
---
Why is it your loot when you did nothing to get access to it and didnt care about it until it showed up? You never ask rogues for their lvl when they join.
---
Smolderthorn is great Horde-Side if you have a fetish for being ganked by a group of alliance even though you're literally helping one do a quest, evidently.
---
Heals here, I’ll make you a deal.  Now obviously I can’t open the chest and you should be paid for your services.  Now it’s only fair for me to use that same payment for services model, would you agree?  Here’s a rough draft of the menu:
---
Greater Heal: 50s
---
Renew: 10s per tick
---
Flash Heals:  100s as they are murder on the mana
---
Dispel Magic: 50s
---
Cure Disease: 50s
---
 Or both for 75s, my hot deal of the week.
---
Giving Fort to the whole team is going to set you back 2G each as the Codex took some effort and/or money to get.
---
We are currently offering package deals so be sure and hit me up before grouping and raiding.
---
You need to start over. Server transfers also only allow you to go from PvE to PvE. Or from PvP to PvE. But never from PvE to PvP.
---
Hes a big WoW streamer and a bigger dick.
---
I started using it this time around, and it's really good for cycling clustered mobs. You just have to make sure you don't accidentally target a mob that hasn't been pulled.
---
bleeding hollow represent, but not enclave gross
---
Yea, what a coward.
---
I’m certain of this too
---
Do chests ever even have anything useful? Usually vendor trash.
---
You can if you kick them first and let them teleport out. I don't think they are going to make it back to the chest.
---
Then 20 Paladins appear
---
You camp the yeti cave? Thanks for proving my point.
---
Alliance or proper pvp etiquette pick one
---
If it’s mail, it’s all yours baby.  Let’s be honest, leather spell damage gear is probably yours too.
---
If you roll on Mage/Warlock prebis, expect salt from the dps casters.  It’s a pain in the ass for us to get groups and then roll against the 100 other mages, just to have the healer roll against us, too.
---
A good suggestion would be to communicate your desire to roll on dps cloth before you start a group.  Or just make your own groups and invite tons of melee!
---
Better yet just don't invite rogues to party.  I like to tank with daggers so less roll competition also if rogues start gaining this mentality.  Costs me extra repair cost to tank those mobs in front of that chest that this rogue thinks is his.
---
Scarlet boots but it's nice regardless
---
It's a class locked gathering skill that puts out far more money than the others, people are aware so they want it rolled for because it's worth getting a shot at. If a rogue wants to take advantage of the chest optimally they have to enter and clear a dungeon with a party, then the chance they make money beyond the single chest is vastly increased.
---
If they try to keep it to themselves I'd just kick them, I can always get another dps who isn't a greedy asshole.
---
And he got an epic mount out of it. 
---
It seems to me like yall never even played any other multiplayer games but wow. 
---
Trust no one. Or get fucked. 
---
People that think that someone should get banned for literally playing a game are fucking pussies. No hacks, no exploits, just a lie. That deserves a ban?  Pfffffffft.
---
Ah roger. Seen 😅
---
Keep plugging this guy, watch how many twitch primes he ends up with. 
---
He is going to make IRL $ off your rage and he will not be banned.  LOL
---
heh, and streamers wondered why everybody wanted to stay the hell away from whatever server they were on.
---
I avoid inviting selfish dickheads.
---
Sometimes they get in via a PUG, but they aren't welcome back.
---
Don't be a selfish dickhead.
---
You injest it through the sphincter, obviously.
---
Very potent!
---
Nah.
---
Sorry but after reading a few comments here I just gotta ask, are most of you unable to read basic human social behaviours? Obviously he isn't sorry, the "sorry I ninjad ur shit" is just the extension of him trolling, don't take it so literal. 
---
And honestly, this clip blowing up is probably this dudes wetest dream come true, considering he is a streamer nobody gives a damn about. And to the "I can't believe hed destroy his reputation for a mount comments", he doesn't need to care about it, he is a higher minion in a guild run by an e- celebrity. At worst he will just team up with the several asmon viewer guilds. The best thing u can do is report him In game and ignore him otherwise.
---
Thanks, not sure why I should spend gold to open a chest for someone else to get loot.
---
This doesn’t relate and comment is  stupid
---
Man wish I could do this, I get too motion sick if I'm not starting at the road :(
---
he is not acting. watch this  and listen to his story... he ninjas his own guildbank and transfers servers. that among other asshole stories
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClWD0NPwF-s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClWD0NPwF-s)
---
Ohhhhhhh he need some milk
---
Don't need to care about them. Tanking in low level dungeons is almost impossible and frankly just stupid.
---
Also you are a tank, if there are 2 DPS who don't want to play with you, who cares? There are 2000 other dps who will jump at the opportunity.
---
You dont know that im selfish until you see a chest that YOU WANT WHATS INSIDE.
---
Goodluck avoiding selfish people LOL
---
Right, so you go to a social media platform, ask for peoples opinions and when they disagree starts bashing them.  
---
You didn’t want their opinions but rather a shoulder clap. You sought approval for your belief as it is the only true truth. Instead you could have listened to the majority of replies stating your truth false but noooo. Your truth is the only.  
---
Take it in and think about it, it might actually do you  good to listen to others from time to time.
---
&gt;As you may know, the census addons do not work since september 19th
---
10 days without updated data, this split could have easily changed.
---
What quest is this from?
---
I've been informed.
---
Any pre 60 content a bear is more than fine for, arguably better than warrior since they are less gear dependent and you dont always have great gear while leveling.
---
The only places druids strat to struggle is end game content and even then only the larger raids. Even at 60 they cam tank 5 and 10 man dungeons perfectly fine and you wouldn't have any trouble filling your parties.
---
Basically if you want to be the most minmaxed tank class obviously its warrior but druids have their own massive set of advantages.
---
Stop giving this guy publicity. This is EXACTLY what he wanted. He has gained hundred of subs today because of this drama.
---
Like I siad, youre on my post, telling me to go away?
---
If you want to avoid me, stop commenting on my post.
---
Smart tanks run off the pace of thier healer. Tanks cant do thier job if the healer isnt there
---
You miss all the shots you don't take.
---
I haven't seen this reference in a decade. Brings back memories!
---
They didn’t care about it because it wasn’t an option.  Why let it bother you if you can’t open the chest.  Now that they have a way of opening the chests, it makes sense to want it open.
---
Go solo a dungeon for the dungeon loot in the chests and get back to me why it should be rolled for as a group, the chests are worthless compared to loot potential of a full dungeon, but split it between 5 people and it makes it attractive to the whole party.  
---
There are classes with better dps and utility than rogue, if i don't have one it doesn't matter. If I do, then I want a shot at the loot that just became available.
---
The first 20-30 levels as a warrior are hard. Then it becomes a cakewalk.
---
How is it my job yet its not necessary, and its not an option...
---
They're not really expensive the first several times... he could just save his respec until phase 2/3, not like he'd have to keep swapping back and forth. His OG comment was about raiding and if he has the express goal of raiding, he would spec for that not for the other content. Besides, frost is going to be better for pvp anyway might as well take advantage of that while he can't do fire for raids.
---
reported him on twitch for telling people to harass the people he ninja'd at the beginning of his MC raid. I suggest everyone does the same if we want to impact this guys life. He probably thinks hes golden like a shower. Trying to goad reddit.
---
Unpopular opinion.
---
You just think this is wrong because he's some random. Asmon has admitted he will ninja loot something if he wants it and has done it multiple times that I've witnessed. I guess since he tries to do it in a funny way, it's A-OK though. 
---
Agreed, this is *bullshit,* but he is literally just following the formula that other successful streamers made for him.
---
an arms warrior that can't fight against a rogue, what a disgrace.
---
But then you'd be a 12 year old shit player that only ganks lowbies.
---
"Cult of personalitys" 
---
Never heard of him till yesterday.
---
Just play. You don’t even know what questions to ask before you’ve played for a month or so. Get a feel for the game. It doesn’t matter what things you pick. You’re not gonna be some no life server first player, you’re just gonna be one of thousands of regular players doing regular things same as everyone else. Go with the flow, do what you like, you’ll pick it up easy.
---
This dude is the definition of a chad to the fucking tee
---
Stop acting like you invite rogues because they can pick locks when you dont even care until a chest comes up
---
better utility? Who can open chest better than rogues?
---
Lies.
---
The Warlock doesn't drink water, we just cut ourselves for mana.
---
UNSOLICITED CHAT
---
LOCK IT DOWN
---
I hate that i don't have any buffs as a shaman... well, nothing terribly useful so i rez/heal random people i come across. I get flooded with buffs though
---
Evidently you do if people are ripping aggro and you're mad at people doing damage. Learn to be efficient 😉
---
You dont need to put Flame Shock after #showtooltip
---
It will auto-populate itself
---
Fuck man if you struggle with this legend you would hate to see some of the work put out by researchers in journal articles. Sometimes they don’t even label shit and you’ll just have 2 graphs side by side that you gotta work out for yourself. Other times the results and legend are not even in sync. This is a pretty good design imo, I don’t know how else you would make a legend with so many colour variations and numbers that you have to specify. It’s just a challenging amount of data to fit into a single legend.
---
Was listening to RUSH in darkshore yesterday on my alchemist warrior, elixired off his face and shredding through mobs. Good times.
---
*shrug*
---
Last group I ran, the rogue got a free agility to boots enchant before we even stepped in the instance.
---
Don't be a selfish dickhead. People notice it, and that makes them not want to group with you.
---
Have fun gearing as DPS at 60 when you aren't a well-liked person. PUGs are always hell, and tanks and healers have started reserving loot for their melee DPS warrior friends.
---
He's trying to justify his greedy posture. He's so obviously unaware that he hasn't looked at all the dungeon gear the "greedy" members of his party got him.
---
I really appreciate all the feedback, you guys are awesome.  I would have replied sooner with thanks but I work steady late second shift job.
---
I have rezd people out in the middle of nowhere and never once got offered a tip, sometimes not even a thanks. Leveling my alt druid I get asked if I can give them thorns and that they would tip. I didn't take it but man I could believe I got offered for a 10 min buff versus actually saving you time walking back.
---
Because it's one possible way you can make friends.
---
But really, this doesn't seem like the kind of think that you would need to ask people for advice on. You decide what your services are worth, you compare that to other people who are blacksmiths on your server, you make a choice.
---
Same goes for opening a chest. You decide. You get to craft your reputation on a server. You can literally do it however you want.
---
i dont undetstand they are essentially the same interface
---
\*As a Blood DK since Cata*
---
A-are we not supposed to?
---
&gt; making asmongold look bad 
---
Is that satire?  His stream makes him look like a gross, sad jackass that brags about ninja looting and tricking people with bogus auctions.
---
Asmongold would probably demote that guy if he *didn't* ninja loot the gauntlets.
---
obviously zero Black Drake's Heart :)
---
I think that's the worst quest item drop rate in the game
---
Yeah but are you waiting for your healer to say go? Of course not, you decide based on their resources and proceed.
---
I havent even seen how much the mount sells for because i know i cant afford it
---
sure a rogue can tank a whole group of mobs while a poor priest has to heal that shit... no thanks! I rather farm mobs or go offline before I do a dungeon like that!
---
Oh my sweet retail child. I’m on a mid pop pvp server. And nearly every other 60 I run into on both Horde and Alliance have epic mounts. 9g isn’t as much as you think...
---
He loves the attention. He does not care at all.
---
Is the Jame guide still solid? I really love the wow-pro.com addon and that guide being included is very alluring but I never used guides so I don't know the differences/cant speak for their quality.
---
Asmongold and his guild are literally cancer.
---
And you get cursed, and you get cursed, and you get cursed!
---
Who cares lmao
---
1 word. Print Screen
---
They killed Rag in 6 days, you are probably level 30.
---
Speedrunning is a thing and lots of people compete, just like they did with world first classic Rag.
---
Love the choice of name by the way.
---
You realize this notion that people playing retail are some sort of insane howler monkeys while you're the civilized and gentile classic only player is the exact same kind of elitism you allegedly oppose?
---
Now, to the degree you get compensated, I guess it depends.  I would open my friends' boxes for free, and same with guildies. Tips are just that, tips, and I NEVER ask for tips, because then it's not really a tip. I'll probably even open the locks of my party members, for boxes that drop while I'm there.  But there should definitely be a fee for random people, and the people that get all uppity about it, you don't know them anyways, so who cares?
---
Sure and when I chunk 3/4 of your hp in one stun, you ain't gonna be saying that
---
I don’t know much about Asmogold. Is he toxic or is it just the people surrounding him?
---
He will kick,  he has removed other people for less
---
Asmon is popular because if all the limp wrist neck beards hold their arms up at once then they can manage to hold ONE of their kind up, and that’s asmon. He’s a representation of their greatest wish fulfillment.
---
The dude has horrendous hygiene, lives with his mom, has never exercised, isn’t intelligent or skilled at gaming, is “dating” a bolt on titty E-Thot, and is losing his hair due to chronic malnutrition. But the cultists all aim their wallets in his direction because cults need a god that represents the “successful” version of themselves.
---
you know, i've seen questions asked like this and i know about not using HS, but no one said to use sunder. i thought it was a waste like HS as there was no need for threat when levelling.
---
will try out adding sunders when i log in next &gt;.&gt;
---
thanks!!!!
---
They don’t look very different so your response of it looking pretty awful is why you’re getting negative attention
---
Lol you're one of those.. Yeah, this is done.
---
Asmongold makes himself look bad.
---
And he then removed them from bnet and blocked them.
---
I've seen this behavior regardless of political leaning.   People are just sensitive slope-brows.
---
If you are this old and dont understand what condescension is.... then I can tell you've lived a wonderful life.
---
Yup this. I started in Tanaris, aggroing everything in sight and getting no eggs. Went to Hinterlands and was done in 20 minutes!
---
Love dominos - it’s got that perfect blend of minimalism and utility that makes it look pretty good and is just customizable enough to give you a really unique and clean looking UI without taking forever to set up like ElvUI/TukUI
---
SM/ruin most versatile spec in the game, good at raiding, instances, farming, and pvp, no contest. you can farm mara in it too. however if all you're gunna be doing is farming/grinding and doing instances then sm/ds is probably better, though its bad for raiding and pvp.
---
Can't pom pyro as frost though.
---
Did we really need a new thread
---
I don’t want to avoid you. I wrote that if you wanted a fight, a social media platform is not the place, and asked that you took for it elsewhere. If you want to discuss the matter you brought up (which, from your replies, does not seem like) please stay and discuss. Calling people idiots is not discussing.
---
Dude your fine
---
Oh yeah, although there is a slight difference between a rogue lock-picking and a blacksmith, as one needs to craft the thing they need to unlock the chest.
---
But it's still up to you and the decision you make will affect what people on the server think of you.
---
If it’s a queue, it’s bad.
---
Find a server where your character is staring back at you as soon as you click.
---
Nice
---
This dude is bordering on psychotic. 
---
Someone please check on him he shouldn't be alone right now
---
I vendor linen through silk. Even silk might make you only 5s/stack more than vendoring, and if you make bandages the difference is essentially nothing.
---
Ive noticed a lot of people in game getting mad over stupid shit like this.
---
Press the side button and volume up at the same time then release.
---
Hello, is this SlipperyJim?  
---
/r/pathofexile is leaking
---
learn to not suck or I will let u die
---
His advice wasn't even good...   Let the dps face tank the skull.  lol
---
Irony.
---
Did you invite that enchanter to the run for free enchants? Or did you not care about his profession until it benefited you? :)))))))))
---
Holy shit my high ass late at night would definitely click him lol
---
Oh my casual child.
---
Asking the real question
---
The only pvp ive seen alliance do is gank me after a 3 mob pull and im at 200 health. Real tough guys
---
And people wonder why some players were so opposed to being on the same realm as streamers.
---
Moist
---
Rogue here - I have spent a lot of time leveling my lockpicking (it's a *bit* of a PITA but not awful).  If I'm in an instance and we come across a locked chest I tell the group if I can/can't open it (with 100% honesty) and we /roll for it.  I unlock it (again if I can) and whomever won the roll gets the goodies.  
---
Why do I "freely" give away my skills, that I spent so long training?  Because there will be other chests, other /rolls, other loots, other goodies for me and for everyone else.  I find the game a LOT more fun when people are, well, cool.  
---
I'll happily unlock lockboxes too, for free as well.  Wanna tip me?  Sweet, I appreciate it!  Don't tip me?  No worries my dude, I ain't expecting you to. 
---
Anyone can get loot, anyone can get gold - don't need other players for that.  But a fun experience?  That takes cool people...and cool people make a game I want to play.
---
I'm not mad, I am laughing at your dumb ass
---
This is more about chest
---
Lol how pathetic do you have to be.
---
I like that he thanked his guildies and said sorry for ninja'ing in his little acceptance speech there.
---
Fuckem.
---
You are the hero I needed.  Crit is all we fire bros have. I bet a goddamn frosty is behind this!!
---
I do what someone else in this thread said, if I'm opening the chest I get a second roll if I need it.
---
If a BS is there they also get an extra roll, but if they win they unlock it instead of me. So far everyone's been cook about it. It seems fair enough imo
---
Suuuuure buddy ;)
---
The quest giver in Tanaris specifically refers to the Temple of Atal’Hakkar as “the Sunken Temple” when he gives you the quests to do stuff in there
---
SoupaSoka with the mod boner is at it again, folks.
---
fuckin lmao this was my first thought  
---
are you rly out here acting like its the oscars mate i had my epic mount two weeks ago this isn't an achievement for people who nolife
---
Ive been having the opposite problem, I was putting together a group and needed 1 dps, so I posted in lfg, got a whisper from a shaman asking if we had the egg for st, I said yes and invited.
---
Guy gets to the dungeon and starts trying to just heal, I was like "yo the add was for dps not healer " so he started trying to dps. He was in mostly healing gear but I figured he could do some elemental shit. Nope. He plopped down windfury totem and proceeded to auto attack and earth shock.
---
I kicked him and just got the next dps we could find.
---
I like to think he was just way too high.
---
I'm on a PvE server and I have literally never seen anyone advertise this "spellcleave", "aoe", whatever you wanna call it.
---
Is this a genuine comment? You have autism
---
THAT’S A 50 DKP MINUS
---
I was the enchanter.

Mounts? Dragons?  I can't even afford to train my skills.
---
I would hate for a server to dislike me just because I wasnt told before hand that the reason I got an invite was because of my secondary skill that is not needed to level.
---
You really think people would hate me for spending my gold and effort so someone else can benefit? I dont see enchanters handing out crusader enchants. I see tanks selling their tankyness, mages selling water, LW selling their crafting skills, Enchanters selling their chanting skills. Why am I selfish?
---
Some people ""rushed"" their way through the game back in 2005 too, the same kind of "takin it slow, smellin the roses" types were super condescending towards them back then as well. 
---
It's just a different form of elitism. People have fun in different ways, quit trying to pretend one way is more legitimate or respectable.
---
Auto attack is most of our damage. Our shots scale with weapon damage.  That's more than a stat stick. 
---
Hit is extremely important for every class but imo it's your responsibility to farm it. Hunters have demanding rotations that literally change depending on their ranged weapon. 
---
The only thing I expect priority on is ranged Weapons. 
---
Warrriors and Rogues already share a ton of itemaztion with Hunters and I'm fine with that but if you'd roll or get priority on ranged over me I wouldn't group with you.

Are you for real? Do you expect to have a "real discussion" after saying "LOL these replies. I love this. I hope he keeps doing it."?

---
But why?
---
Do you go around carrying your entire bank in your bags too ? there's no way you're going to fill 24 slots of herbs unless you never store anything in your banks.
---
As a herbalist myself I mostly carry what I pick up , I either turn it into pots for the AH or store the herbs I'm not going to use in the bank, most of the herbs I carry in bags are usually dreamfoil/silversage/plaguebloom/ bit of gromsblood and the occasional lotus if I happen to pick one up, what else do u need to carry ? 4-6 slots at most for herbs , anything that caps you store in bank unless you're going to use it immediately for crafting.
---
Whoa wait, did this guy transfer to Venture Co. From Tortheldrin? I remember the name with the same guild, who transferred because "emberstorm is trash", and the whole server hated them...
---
...Nobody said they didn't? Although not in the numbers you guys are claiming. But claiming that theyre somehow recruiting through video games is quite frankly, retarded. Although dayton was a far left nutter... and el paso. So should we be worried about the left radicalizing them? Because dayton *loved* chapo shithouse' podcast.
---
But back to the point i was making, look at yourself in the mirror and realize what you look like, this has honestly gone far beyond the satanic panic because you clowns are actually getting shit censored all while claiming others are the problem.
---
Yes. It's incredibly famous. Fuckloads of people besides just you can recall it.
---
This is a discussion not an argument, Why are you talking in all caps?
---
You were added to the group to be a rogue, picking locks is part of what they do, to not do so is outside of the norm.
---
This is greed plain and simple.
---
you shouldnt have vendored wicked claws, warriors need those for Lionheart Helm
---
I'll second the twitch app, it's really easy to use.
---
Just make sure to change from wow to wow classic when downloading.
---
Wait, hang on a second tiger.
---
I’ve seen those stats here on Reddit. I play Alliance, only lvl 29, and haven’t really noticed  any imbalance. Zones are active and getting ganked is about what one would expect. I havent encountered a login queue in quite some time. I play mostly prime time.
---
Honestly I could care less about streamers. You really don’t notice them at all unless you’re looking for it. Haven’t seen  anything particularly interesting happen or any obscene fanboying. The queue is probably the worst part because I guess there are a lot of fanboys just trying to follow them?
---
&gt;  Once you hit ST
---
I mean to be fair, if I would have to run ST more than once, I'd probably lose my mind too.
---
Can someone eli5 this to me i don’t necessarily understand the lingo. He’s telling his followers to steal from guild banks ?
---
The quality of the healing gear you’ll have while levelling makes Illumination an expensive luxury. Your spell crit chance will be too low for it to really make a difference. Divine Favor is a two minute cool down so will only get use once per fight. For dungeon healing, Divine Intellect, Spiritual Focus and Healing Light are more than enough. To reach Divine Favor, you’d need to spend another eight talent points and you will want those in retribution because, like I said, your 50’s are gonna be miserable; you’ll need all the help you can get.
---
I’m probably gonna get downvoted but everyone here making fun of him personally or calling him a piece of shit is just as bad. Yeah it was a scummy thing to do deceiving a friend like that. And if you are personal friends with him, don’t be. But he’s a streamer, involved with a bigger streamer and they do this thing called make content. He made content and you’re all falling for it and giving it the attention he wanted, all while being assholes yourselves about it. Over a video game. And all of you talking about how asmons just a piece of shit, you don’t understand him. Why does anyone take anything he says seriously? And besides obviously staged stuff, he’s streamed all his loot distribution and I’d love to see one decision he made that wasn’t fair. I’m not saying he’s god, he gets on my nerves too, but you all need to fucking relax be a VIDEO GAME.
---
He's such an idiot. 
---
If a warlock in his group was at the dungeon and this guy asked for a summon and the lock told him "oh so you're only interested in my abilities when it's of use to you" and then refused to summon him this moron would throw a fit
---
I don't think he gets that all he's doing is making an argument to never bring a rogue to a dungeon. Lockpicking is literally the only unique and useful ability rogues can bring and if they're not gonna use it to aid the group then there's no reason to ever invite one over all the other, much more useful, dps options out there.
---
If you aren't calling this guy a loser you're downvoted. 
---
mangoReddit
---
Doesn’t the little arena in Gadgetzan flag you for PvP if you walk inside as well?
---
Where do you grind these and what level are they?
---
yet the internet is full of pictures of naked women you can have for free.
---
??? Because you make literal no sense. 
---
&gt;this argument
---
&gt;This is a discussion not an argument
---
Picking locks is what I do, but you dont care about it until you see gold? That is greed
---
It's not just banter when its the entire generation saying we're stupid fucking failures left and right while also ignoring everything we say, and belittling our genuine problems.
---
They're worth 10silver on my server and we have a few guilds with recipes, just such a high supply and not many coming out of the economy.
---
Why not just tank it?
---
You can easily tank as arms, you don't even need a decent tank set to tank UBRS, your DPS gear is all Str/Stam so it'll work fine.
---
I’m sorry, you lost me.  Opening a chest isn’t a necessity but it’s nice if you have a rogue present to help out with that.  The items inside should be quickly dispersed based on need or wants.
---
You keep saying the others wouldn’t be able to open the  the chest without you but you never realize you wouldn’t have gotten to the chest without them.
---
It doesn't matter what Asmon says, it's in the games TOS that you can't agree to a set of loot rules and then not follow the rules set, and that if you do ninja loot in that manner, you should be banned.  Asmon can say whatever he wants but he can't over rule Blizzard TOS.
---
Make them roll and charge for the open.
---
Big if true
---
Get this guy banned!!
---
Yeah tbh I'm in my early-mid 20's and I fucking haaate dudes like 10-20 years older than me calling me bud or buddy. Really grinds my gears. But in this WoW context id have no problem and say the same back! Weird
---
“The chest wouldn’t be available if I wasn’t there”
---
Yeah and he wouldn’t be getting the chest if the group wasn’t there
---
Well said. Wish your attitude was more prevalent out there. Cheers dude
---
They just said that they took action against the offender and were returning the item, if I remember correctly. The guy came into the thread and admitted he got a 3day ban or something like that.
---
Plenty of MAGES have large piles of money.  I play classic to play classic, not play a retail grade character in classic.
---
Thats not how chest works. No one rolls for the chest and then shares everything inside. WHat game do you play?
---
He’s streaming right now with zero remorse. He doesn’t even understand that he did something wrong. So glad I avoided the Faerlina shitshow, these people are beyond garbage.
---
If I can't be petty and narcissistic when dressing up my electronic doll when can I be?
---
&gt; I don't think he gets that all he's doing is making an argument to never bring a rogue to a dungeon. Lockpicking is literally the only unique and useful ability rogues can bring and if they're not gonna use it to aid the group then there's no reason to ever invite one over all the other, much more useful, dps options out there.
---
Pretty much this.
---
They are level 41-43, you can find them north east in the bad lands, north of the elite drakes.
---
Think of Multi Shot as a Chain Lightning but with arrows instead of lightning. This helps visually gauge whether if the mobs are far enough from other mobs that are CC'd.
---
i think the shame delete speaks louder than words
---
Skull will blow up in seconds, it's okay if it rips aggro. Start building on the other mobs and focusing on them.
---
I just did it tonight with group of level 55 averages peeps. We did a full clear (at least every boss, we left a little trash on the Dark Iron Highway and in the 2nd golem room) and only wiped and had to run back once during the gauntlet phase. Took almost exactly 3 hours. You could probably do it in 2 if you super overgear the area but 2 hours would be tough For your typical group unless you are continuously pulling with little to no downtime and there are no bio breaks etc
---
I’d give retail the edge on raids as well. For the most part blizzard made some pretty substantial strides in making PVE content more interesting around ulduar and while the rest of the game may suck raiding is still a blast.
---
Do ppl really need a guide for everything they do..?
---
Click on the realm and you see the entire ppl in which level they are.
---
And if you’re not fine with it, go and build your own website 🙄
---
your name and race say gnome, but this post says troll...
---
truly a tragedy of a server by the looks of things
---
Here is my opinion. Its tricky at times. Where do you draw the line? I think compensation for the use of the skill can be ok. I like to do the opening of locks for free, accepting tips (it helps me skill up at times too). I find most people tip. For leather working, I let them know my fee up front. Then they can decide. When you’re in a party, including dungeons i think there is an implicit agreement to use skills beneficial for the party. For example, i don’t charge people to use my battle rez (which costs me money). I don’t charge for buffs. I don’t charge people to open the workshop in Gnomer, since i worked hard on getting the key. I think it really comes down to your personal style and how you take the game. The great part about classic is the community. You can decide to play the way you want, and people can decide if they want to pay. There are many many people playing the same classes with the same skills. They will get what they need one way or another.
---
In the end, its just a chest in the dungeon.
---
It would not cause the server to dislike you, all the players do not share one Borg Collective hive-mind, and how you respond to what happens in a dungeon with your party it's something you get to handle on a case-by-case basis. This crafts your reputation with some players and some of those players will spread those positive or negative experiences to other players.
---
You don't want to level lock-picking, don't. You want to level it and help your party unlock chests, go for it. You want to level lock-picking and hide that fact from your party, then go back later and unlock chests, you can do that as well. Same goes with blacksmithing.
---
And you can handle any positive or negative comments any of your party members spread about you afterwards.
---
I mean or you could just email Disney and ask them to loan you a Jiminy Cricket, a conscience to sit on your shoulder and tell you what is right and wrong.
---
Me tanking up to that chest obtaining the largest repair bill...I don't expect help with that either.  I expect a share after getting you there.  Show me a locked chest in a dungeon without mobs directly next to it that you can get to on your own.  You need help and you want it for free, door swings both ways.
---
A BoE is worth an equal amount of gold to everyone in the group.  Four people can sell it for gold, and one person can avoid spending that exact same amount.  A BoP rifle that a hunter needs is worth distinctly more than whatever it vendors or de's for.  It is only obtainable through a drop.
---
What I'm saying is that a BoE that is truly worth vendoring is equivalent to gold.  If everyone rolls need on boe's blue and above it would put an end to the ninja shenanigans.  I'm also saying that claiming "need" on something you could have purchased already isn't right (in my view).  If a player chooses not to buy a BoE, then they value gold over that item just the same as the rest of the group.
---
people are saying ill be blacklisted and wont be invited to anything if I dont open these things for them. I dont feel like that is fair since im not told before the run "youre being invited to open things"
---
People wouldnt even know i could open them unless i said so because it doesnt seem expected for someone to have a profession leveled all the way up.
---
I just hit 60 last week and Im going to get blacklisted for not having my professions maxed :/
---
If you say you are a troll then you are not a troll. Dam amateur pfff.
---
Can you explain this further?
---
Yes
---
&gt; Your attitude has really helped my decision to not help and open chest.   Your toxicity is really shocking. 
---
If I display more "toxicity" do you promise to just give up on inflicting groups with your presence altogether?  Don't just stop at unlocking chests, really stick it to your server pop man. Refuse to help anyone with anything. Even better, don't even give them the honor of speaking with you over any message or chat function.  Become the solo God you were meant to be.
---
You really out here saying he should turn his stream off? Like man that's like saying oh if you don't like your manager just quit.
---
There's no honor is killing someone 4 times that clearly isn't a threat.
---
&gt; So, is Asmon going to remove him from the guild?
---
He's currently hosting his stream, so probably not.
---
I don't think they actually aggro unless directly attacked? They don't function as normal guards at least from what I'm seeing.
---
Dude looks like the quintessential Asmongoloid fan/friend. This is what peak scumfuck looks like.

he's kinda hosting his stream right now tho

Afaik, I remember it coming in s4 ish arena when teams went to shaman/lock/mage. It was called spell cleave.

Horde doesn’t get blessing of Salv and I’m min maxing a troll mage.

There’s also the azure whelp or whatever the blue one was.

These are brilliant. I love the way you use icons to build characters. Give me more!
---
The El Paso guy was not far left, you're completely full of shit.  
---
He literally went there to stop a "Hispanic invasion" of Texas, which is rhetoric pulled straight out of a certain president's playbook.
---
As for the Dayton guy, as far as I know we know nothing about his motive so you're being dishonest with that as well.  But that's par for the course for guys like you.  Can't handle reality so you make up your own. 
---
Claim that white supremacy is an overblown problem and then you cry about Antifa in the same breath, a group who's literally irrelevant in 99 percent of the country.  Just a bunch of dishonest, disingenuous bullshit.
---
if they ninja the chest I'd kick them. if they refuse to open with the intention of going back and opening it later, ill kick them at the end and reset the instance
---
You can tank everything pre-AQ40 without Prot, and even if you want to go Prot it's barely worth going more than 15-17 points for Last Stand and Defiance. 
---
You only really need Prot later for progression tanking, where Imp Shield Wall is handy. 
---
What talents beyond 15prot are gonna help your healers in UBRS? There's nothing.
---
I don't even click greed when they come up, just pass. Worthless junk.
---
That's not Classic and if anything that policy being brought in late WotLK is a reason why it doesn't and shouldn't apply to Classic.  
---
Scumbags and a more gritty world where people can lie, cheat and steal is a part of Classic. If they abuse agreed upon game systems like loot master, sure, ban them. If they simply lie or trick other players then they're scumbags that should be ostracized but not banned.
---
I think within reason the mob avoidance can be kinda fun. Turns into a bit of a platformer lol
---
Git Gud
---
Literally both sides do it. Classic and retail.
---
I think it's just hardcore people that are concentrated at 60 now and from people leaving.
---
I mean, I think you're a little bit too upset and ranty in your post, but I do agree that it's odd rogues are never compensated for opening a locked chest in a dungeon, especially at higher levels. Maybe everybody forks over 50s or something if they want in one the roll. Or the one that wins it tips out a gold or two if something valuable is inside.
---
I wouldn't have a problem with this.
---
Also a note when this option is checked you will get a message in your chatbox when they try to invite you to it still but now you can right click their name and report.
---
I think I hate WoW now because of these turds.
---
4 mana pots &amp; 20 bandages. Also nice.
---
It's a dps, you're very replaceable. You just have a utility we can sometimes use. If I get a lock instead of a rogue it doesn't bother me at all, I just don't get a shot at the 1 chest you can unlock and get more buffs and utility.
---
"there are very fine people on both sides"
---
What is it?
---
black diamonds drop like candy and will never have significant value.
---
A good sensible chuckle
---
consecration is the more necessary tanking talent, holy shield is more reliable when aoe farming until you get more spell power gear
---
Yep.
---
Not everyone has gold, saying you "could" have bought it is not true for everyone, not all classes have an easy time farming gold, so no it doesnt have the same value for everyone.
---
Druids are much less gear reliant, so in pre-bis gear levels it can be better than warriors, actually. If you take your time to farm crowd pummelers, the threat is amazing too.
---
You can watch this (long) video that discusses druids in depth: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyWQlXtkuJ0
---
For tl:dr, the downsides are:
---
* No fear breaks, aside from pvp trinket.
---
* Can't use potions or consumables in bear form
---
* Can take lots of damage quickly on bosses that hit fast (Magmadarr), but your huge armor can carry you through
---
* There's almost no gear upgrades in MC so you're going to be going into BWL in blues
---
* Chromaggus and Nef are nearly impossible for druids due to fight mechanics
---
Druid ress is 30 minutes cd + reagent. I didn't even learned it until lvl 60
---
If I were playing and was grouping up for a dungeon, I would notify a person with Olympus clan tag that we cannot take an increased risk for ninja looter
---
Haha how bored are you?
---
This like the 4th troll comment I’ve seen in the last hour....what happened, you hit the early 30’s wall and pack it in?
---
We were in a group yesterday with a shadow priest that refused to use vampiric embrace because he thought it didn’t help with healing at all. We tried to explain to him that the healer saves a lot of casting time and focus time not having to top people off. It’s like, dude, it’s one of the few awesome party utilities you have, use that shit
---
We had a lvl60 hunter who started to flame poor lvl49 retry paladin for rolling that stupid ring from pruncess in Maraudon
---
Yes your endgame content is now permanent Sunken Temple until AQ so that you never have to look at BRM ever. Genius!
---
People are making it frustrating as fuck to tank.
---
Yeah the trolls.   Wonder if there’s a fast way to get to them.  May need to do some trial and error
---
He’s likely a healer, but you’ll also never see a shaman in the top 10 in raids :(
---
I was waiting for my downvotes. Probably from 12 year old shit Horde players that only gank lowbies because they suck.
---
Feral druids in classic&gt;feral druids in vanilla and yes they can tank almost everything at this point if not everything.
---
I wonder if the time its taking them to find people to do shortcut runs is offset by getting quicker groups to just do a full run.
---
It would be incredibly ironic.
---
Holy shit!
---
Thankfully they... like everyone else... seem to avoid Bloodsail.
---
This is your rogue post not your blacksmith post, it didn't cost you anything.  Keep your troll posts straight.
---
You are in much better pugs than me then.  Some mobs will also blow up the dps in seconds too.  I'll continue to do what I normally do, which is keep threat on skull without trying to overaggro, while also focusing on other mobs.
---
Don't make promises you know you can't keep on your streamer toon. Didn't say he had to never stream again, but if your going to make a commitment to the community, like he did, dont back off it 40 levels in. That's also the least egregious of all this shit so im not sure why your arguing just this one point.
---
&gt;	And if you really feel that because the epic that just *happened* to drop also just *happens* to be usable by you that you’re entitled to it simply because of that RNG and that everyone else should greed while you need then you’re a **scumbag**.
---
I emphasized the important parts for you since apparently comprehension isn’t one of your strengths.
---
Or wear a shirt.
---
Goodbye
---
BS is worthless while leveling, alchemy is very useful.
---
I thought it was against Twitch TOS to knowingly break TOS of games while streaming them, is it not?  Honestly just everyone report his Twitch,  fuck his wow account take away his stream.  A piece of shit like him doesn't deserve any platform to get any attention.
---
?... what a weirdo
---
What does this have to do with WoW?
---
You honestly give a shit about a single BS on your server that has denided opening a chest? You care that much about your world of warcraft server? Based on your comments, you seem to care more than I do about this topic.
---
You didnt care I was a BS before the run, why do you care now that you can cash in? It isnt greed is it?

go to gadgetzan, kill the beasts in the desert for vendor trash *or* go to swamp of sorrows and kill the crocs/cats for vendor trash.

For every person that cares, there are just as many people if not more that actually don't give a shit either way. Like said above, in the end you're the only one in the group with the ability so it is your choice.
---
Wait... You are "reapplying" it?   How long is it taking you to kill this mob??

Since he just bought his mount today, He should get it removed via GM and all of his gold taken away... If I were a GM i'd put him in all greys while I was at it...

He wasn’t actually apologizing he trolling even harder
---
You'll basically use it for a minimum of 14-15 levels. I got mine at 30 too and only swapped it out at 44 for Stoneslayer. The Rockpounder and Stoneslayer, both req 44 and both drop off Uldaman final boss, are pretty much the next upgrades unless you get super lucky on a BoE world drop.
---
Your not making any sense.
---
You'd be surprised
---
Being a dipshit has no age.
---
Agreed. I had a guy tell me, stop offering that green item on trade chat and vend it. I replied back... blocked. I wasn't even spamming. Lol.
---
They dont.
---
Me too, which is why i panicked at the end and bandaged lol.
---
Why can't you just do it in dungeons?
---
The overall leveling experience as an Alliance is more troublesome than horde, which contributes to Alliance being more lethargic to engage in pvp, as dying will further delay the leveling process.
---
1. Horde has a lot more quests compared to alliance, so most alliance players have to grind at some point of their leveling progress. In general when grinding for mobs or exp, i find both parties to be very peaceful. In zones with short quest objectives players of both faction will be more likely to jump on each other.
---
2. Horde have the strongest (by far) PVP racials. Will of the Forsaken is OP and Stun resistance for Orc is a heavy counter to rogues, pala and warrior. More often than not engaging in pvp may end bad for the ally player.
---
3. High populated pvp zones like STV is inconvenient for alliance, due to no middle flightpath. When you spend 10 minutes running from point A to point B, you won't want to elongate the process more by potentially dying.
---
At lvl 60, you will see a lot more Alliance engaging in world pvp, but in leveling areas, I would say as it is more tedious and a grind to level, alot of Ally players just can't be bothered to waste effort in pvping.
---
Paladins are excellent dungeon tanks and actually fit in much better with the AoE meta than Warriors. 
---
Of course, there's no saving stupid, and if a Mage or Warlock can't wait 5 seconds before blowing all their AoE, they'll probably die.
---
I just don't do zoomcleave groups. The only time this caused me issues was ZF as people do that to death, finally found a decent group, got my quests done and the pauldrons and moved on.
---
Most raids tend to have 5-8 warriors. Most bosses only require 1-2 tanks, so much of the time the non-MT warriors are dpsing. The only time warriors are often "forced" to tank is in 5-man dungeons. If you're willing to coordinate the group yourself, you can often find another player willing to tank so you can DPS, if willing to wait a bit longer for the group to form.
---
for the most part later on you won't be using your pet for damage, you will just be sticking your imp on passive and let him sit there phased out passively giving your group the stam buff.   at 60 most mobs will oneshot your imp or succy if they even breathe on it.
---
It’s STVietnam... the trees speak
---
Thunder fury? I was there

Having not played on private servers, care to shed some light on a few?

?????????? The elitist mentality has been there since 2004. I absolutely remember being an elitist fuck back in the day.
---
That's one change I don't think most people would be upset about tbh. need roll soulbinds items, but if you let them do one you open the door for a bunch of actually bad changes.
---
Spriests, hunters, warlocks all easily farm Mara for loads of cash.  So 4 out of the 9 classes can easily farms boat loads of gold.
---
Did a pally make you an ouchie?
---
"Actually, some kid's probably gonna like DDOS me"
---
Im farming Maraudon, usually if Im using my pvp set it takes 2 application of Curse of doom and then it dies to dots
---
lmao, nice try champ. I've gotten plenty from not playing with retards like you but I suppose thats because I'm not in the preteen edgelord faction.
---
Classic Alliance player
---
Of course he's not sorry. He's the first famous asshole of classic. I can almost guarantee his average viewer count skyrocketed over this - he did it for publicity and got exactly what he wanted, nothing to feel sorry about on his end.
---
Now he'll "make it up" by sending his next however much gold to those party members, his reputation will be fixed and in the meantime he'll get all these new viewers, subs, donations, etc.
---
Or you could just not be whiny about something completely inconsequential to you.
---
they're buying things with golds they earned with begging :) dont make these guys big.
---
You can argue whatever you want, but rallying a bunch of people to get someone banned is quite the definition of a witch hunt, no matter your reasons.
---
Bosses are usually a couple levels higher, as mentioned before it affects hit but also:
---
Higher level = higher armor = less crit 
---
(and overall damage, as you noticed dps is lower verses fighting non-elites)
---
Imagine people crying about losing papers with dead presidents on them too
---
that funny this is that you think i am trying to make people salty when I am not. 
---
A 12 year old uses Lmao.
---
It's currently 300g or so on my server, how much do you think it could go for?
---
I’ve been aoe farming and generally just let people go. Every once in a while another mage will just start fighting me. Typically I don’t do anything about it but if the graveyard is far enough away, I’ll kill those guys on their clears. I get he wants the spot. But expecting anything different after opening up is funny. It totally is a day by day thing. One day fighting, one day waves.
---
What if they are right? :O
---
i farmed 34-40 purely on whelps with my undead warlock for this fancy little lad... now i'm doin it on my night elf hunter! (just hit 38, still no lad)
---
you can just keep with a normal leveling spec and run with 2 mages, it works super well.  just make sure you are never standing between the mages and the enemies, and always off to the side when you hellfire so you don't get bopped by kicks or shield bashes.
---
This reads like two people who are on the edge of a potential relationship, but not quite there yet and this was a red flag.
---
The only thing I like about asmongold is the free mount runs he did. Literally the only reason I didn’t have to shell out 250k gold for the grove warden is because of him. Other than that I avoid his streams and videos like the plague. lol
---
You're right. Or they could take 2 picoseconds and use the snipping tool. Better yet, don't make garbage posts lmaooo
---
300g on the AH xD
---
I don't recall saying there was anything wrong with people playing however they like. Long as they aren't pricks about it, people can do whatever they please.
---
technically true
---
Semantics, i mentioned argument as in the case you were putting forward, the second time i used it in the sense of two people arguing, instead of having a civil discussion which is what we were doing.
---
That aside, I have nothing further to add to this discussion. Feel free to continue discussing with others.
---
My ideal rotation is mind blast, shadow word:pain, mind flay, wand... you let them hit you a few times so your actually using the full potential of your spirit tap since it’s going to regen health too. This is to save mana. I think my bubble costs +400 mana (lvl 60)
---
So if you are using your bubble it should be downranked all the way until it just protects your casts enough(mindflay) or if your losing to much health per fight. 
---
The other thing i see priests doing is not using wands enough... half health is a little too much but as long as you have enough time on your shadow word pain then it’s probably in your best bet to just wand the enemy to death.  1/3 is probably best as 1/4 health is your wasting mana on extra spells. 
---
IT seems slow wanding from half health but Pw pain is the strongest dot in game and wands are OP as hell so you can’t expect to melt the enemy’s last half of his health after doing it to his first without going OOm. 
---
So all in all for me as a lvl 60.. down ranking bubble ( 150-250 mana)and not using an extra mind blast (another 300-400 mana)  saves an extraordinary amount of mana each fight. On greens I can consistently fight for 15-20+ mobs if not more but I get bored to and use those extra spells =p
---
I know as you level it changes a lot since you get mind flay and regen works differently, etc.
---

Do you know what the word "everyone" means? In no way does it inherently exclude the speaker meaning he is subject to that rule.

I don't get why you're bending over backwards to try to justify this blatant example of ninjaing.

Oh and don't bother replying with an idiotic example of using the word "everyone" in a statement that explicitly excludes the speaker. Please use your brain first.

I understand why people don't like Asmon, but when did he ninja loot?
---
You added a comment to say you have no more comments lol

But it was a bad rule that was clearly put in place so he could ninja.  When someone is stating rules and they wall "all greed" you say "no, we will all need, that way no one can ninja"

Asmon mage main dickrider who thinks his mancrush can do no possible wrong.

tier .5 sets arent added in until way way later and with the exception of like hemo rogues,  no one even bothers going for it unless they are doing it for collector or rp value.  It's actually a pain in the butt to do the questline for the full set.

All your character specific macros are gone.  Your general macros are saved to your account and not your local file.

SO and I just hit 30, and we're playing a little every day. We're not rushing hard though. I've started to see more rude people but it's not that bad so far.
---
I don't disagree, if you're with PUGs and that situation occurs then yes.. everyone should need. If some people already hit greed and I won I'd let them roll against my winning roll.
---
Problem is that it seems these guys trusted him and he fucked them over for a BoE. Such is life.
---
But then someone buys them and mails them back to you.
---
If a boss says that everyone can go home early, it doesn't necessarily mean *he's* going home early too! 
---
If I yell “everyone down on the ground” that doesn't mean I have to hit the ground too. “Everyone listen” doesn't mean I'm going to listen too. Maybe I'm speaking.
---
LMAO talk about bending over backwards. Way to completely hollow out the meaning of the word “everything.”

The amount of racism/homophobia/sexism I’ve seen in general/trade on classic has been disappointing too. I’ve just resigned to leaving them all and keeping to myself. It’s like people just don’t know how to be decent and normal. But I guess that’s just the world we live in.

I had full rested exp 59-60, did one strath run and dinged right before the last boss

Bro have you watched an Asmon stream or are you just jumping in one the hatred circlejerk? Asmon rolls on gear even if it’s a piece he needs and gives it to the winner

He probably wants to be Asmon that badly. Thats what Asmon does when he reaches big milestones. Difference being that Asmon has a massive audience to entertain and has an established character of being ostentatious. This guy is an actual nobody.

Do not use an estus flask

Exactly. I've only had bad experience with this AoE shit. I get it, if done properly, it's way faster, but somehow it usually results in wiping or just so many mana breaks it turns out to be slower.

No one says "lf1m mage, must make us water" Or "lf1m warlock, must summon us" but mages make water and warlocks summon because it's a part of their roles. If they don't do those things they're either kicked out or aren't invited again.

Besides, no one says "LF1M, rogue" for any group. Ever.

It almost takes a genuine psychopath to openly say he ninja'd and then actually thank the guy he did it to... all while feeling nothing but proud of himself for getting the mount. What a creep.
---
Mages try to aoe everything to instant a pull starts, regardless of if it was a cleave group or not
---
Our demands are that you make an apology video, and say you're sorry in Guild chat. How dare you need on an epic BOE for gold and then distribute the proceeds to each group member. The random non-guild member getting 100g isn't good enough. We are so mad dude. Reddit mad Reddit MAD!!!!  And did you call us disrespectful names??? How disrespectful! wow I'm so mad
---
It's total 100g for training and mount, but 10% discount makes it 90g at 40
---
Proof asmongold and his trash "community" is toxic for WoW. Please ruin a different game
---
I'm all for killing horde, nice job on the 2v1, but can you really call them dishonorable? Just because, what, they started a 2v1?
---
Isnt it funny? The person that spend the last 12 months+ to shit on WoW and the path it took now actively contributes to make Classic shitty. 
---
Makes you wonder
---
You're missing the point. The point is ... if your opinion was a popular one, people would ask. And selfish rogues would often get passed up. You dont have anything unique to offer the group. Replacing you would be easy. And why wouldn't they replace you? Your attitude is obviously selfish, and other dps bring more utility.
---
This belongs in season 8 of GoT. GG khaleesi
---
How on earth did you make it to level 40 before realizing each level took longer than the one before it?
---
this aoe meta didnt start until classic beta when these R E T A I L players did it.  never once did i see this aoe shit on pservers
---
So you kick rogues that are unable to pick chest? You sound like an asshole. I have never seen anyone get mad when a rogue doesn’t have the skill to unlock a chest. This isn’t some skill you learned from clicking and npc. This is a spell I went out of my way to level up and was not invited to groups because of it.
---
But dire maul?
---
North east in the badlands, north of the elite drakes.
---
You clearly dont know anything about paladin, all specs are viable with the right builds and gear to match!
---
Just sore because we can auto attack gank you with ease
---
And oldie but a goldie
---
It's not better than spamming mc
---
I prefer just having a quest help add-on and going from there.
---
Are they on a PvP server? I’d roll horde just to be able to KoS the entire guild.
---
I mean the 24 slot soul pouch.
---
I had to run through there to get to badlands and figured he'd be friendly if i came across him... boy was i wrong
---
Thankfully some lowbie alliance players were nearby who were much more interesting than my green ass
---
Priest healer here. I've got to where all melee groups are my favorite to heal. I'm so over the mages that ice block pull without telling the group what they are doing. Or face tank the AoE pull they did. And then there are the warlocks that lifetap to 10% HP and won't eat or drain so I'm constantly topping them off.  
---
Give me warriors, rogues, and shammies all day. Love you guys.
---
Asmon sub mongs prob
---
I can just say I can’t open it. You don’t care that I can’t open it. You only care about when I can open it. You didn’t invite me to unlock chest. Otherwise you’d kick rogues all the time for not having their skill leveled up. 
---
Imagine calling a rogue selfish for not having lockpicking unlocked so others can get loot.
---
Yep, this is exactly the kind of douche I expected him to be. Seems incredibly unlikable.
---
Are you asking permission or forgiveness?
---
(Fricken english)
---
But the goblins should
---
i didn't enjoy aap classic.
---
it exists and if you've used it before, check it out.
---
I am currently trialling zygor's guide. it's paid though there is a free one for the beginner zones. 
---
It's not bad. I like it more than aap and i think it has better/more functions as well e.g. auto-equipping upgrades (although it doesn't differentiate between boes and bops) and others.
---
I'd say get the free version, fiddle around with it and see if you prefer it over aap
---
I know the proc isn’t an aoe effect. I’m asking if you can get procs off your aoe spells.
---
I stopped playing a while ago after dealing with shitbags like this one too many times
---
Mining/skinning
---
Yes, Alliance Faerlina.
---
It's great having lots of potions while leveling. You have heals on a 2 minute cooldown, it's pretty much like having a racial that heals you.
---
Madseason is the Hank Hill of streamers. A man of courage and conviction.
---
What ever happened to being a good person? Guy is borderline sociopath, kind of guy who gains pleasure killing kittens or some shit.
---
I had a tank that did that in Wailing Caverns. It costed him dearly when he was need rolling on everything in there. Was always the last one to roll too. He WAS guilded, was kicked. Nearly everyone on Atiesh server has him either blacklisted or ignored. Every once in a while I would see the name pop up with LFG for a dungeon and people just tear right into him.
---
You‘re not my buddy!

Or my dad!

Or my Boss!

I charged a mob that was inside a hill.
---
I ended up inside the hill and was immediately disconnected. When I logged back in I was in the graveyard, still alive.
---
I was gonna flame this guy and then I saw the size of his fucking nose, he's got enough to deal with.
---
v. cute dragon
---
He's a no-personality leach who is trying to get twitch money and fame...his views will spike for a week from this, then no one will watch him anymore because he has zero charisma, which is saying something because there is an audience of people who watch asmongold
---
If the above answer is correct your best bet is to make some friends to help you out.
---
Your high horse and analogy are terrible.
---
Priest heals is correlated to him getting in a dungeon. If the fucker wants to be wack and not heal he is getting booted. 
---
If you can’t open the chest it’s whoever can open it that wields all the power
---
In my experience, leveling doesn't get that much slower. The only thing you're doing wrong is avoiding STV. That area is a major questing hub. 
---
Unless you plan on living in dungeons, you best option is to just get used to PvP and go to STV.
---
Dude, who cares lol
---
Boomer move
---
I preferably skip a lot of pulls in undead stratholme. In scholo you can skip all the starting room by accurately jumping down at the start, this brings you right away to last boss basicly. UBRS you don't have super tight skips unless you are lvl59 or lower I guess. But you can skip quite some trash before and after rend.
---
If you decide to sell them in the end, be sure to reach out to me. I'm still looking to collect the older models to play KoW, T9A, and old WHFB editions with.
---
Trash people giving other trash people their money. Really don't see a problem with that tbh. They're all mental midgets.
---
I might be talking out of my ass here so please correct me if i'm wrong. But I thought unless you're hitcapped and hitting from behind, you'll never reach your stated crit anyway. I'm not sure if a glance can crit, but parry, dodge, miss and block cannot. Yet those were still attacks bringing your actual number of crits down
---
Streaming is not. Using people to gain fame and exploiting and using others for your own benefit is, especially over something as stupid as gold.
---
this. you da real mvp.
---
Ive always said this wow brings out the worst in people . ive seen it so many times i've had a family member ruin the guild i was in because of of this very reason
---
depends on class.
---
pre-raid gear for the most part is a waste of gold/time. there is no need to min/max for mc/ony when the raids can be done in green and quest blues. some specs like dps warrior can use lionheart helm for practically all of classic. 
---
most enchants are relatively cheap other than some weapon enchants and libram of voracity. all of the expensive enchants are in phase 3.
---
i don't mind that i have nothing to spend gold on right now. i know when battlegrounds are released my wallet is going to be drained stupid fast on potions :(
---
his officer ninja looted, not him, check your sources. thats kind've the whole wow drama right now
---
I mean, look at him.
---
Take care of mobs that flee at low hp. Your pet might follow and pull some more mobs.
---
Would not surprise me if it isn't principally streamer fans. I mean look at asmons like 14 guilds.
---
Play your game how you want bro. Seems like a lot of trouble just to avoid sharing. The information you requested has been delivered. No one can make you receive it.
---
What an epic piece of shit
---
yikes you really got your jimmies rustled over nothing
---
chill out, buddy
---
Heh. This is gonna be super entertaining to watch unfold no matter what way it goes.
---
I just did a meme like this and it was removed because it was low effort what the actual fuck
---
I think a witch hunt requires a lack of definitive evidence.
---
What does it matter if he kicks him or not, he's getting like a days worth of free content from him for free.
---
inbefore OP is the actual goldseller playing 5d chess on reddit, you coulda atleast blocked the site man, this was free advertisment for them
---
Asmongold has recounted ninja looting stories himself and has ninja looting guild and officer
---
It’s not that hard to see the connections
---
Might sound silly but the best method is the good old attendance list to see whos attending. As for organising not rly over here accept that addon that lets you invite all players at once by checking a box by their name.
---
The ending has kind of a twist when it comes to Japan, just when you think it's done, boom! Another bomb drops.
---
The Twitch client is really convenient for getting add-ons.
---
Because of your reply and its specific direction towards asmon and his guild, I feel obligated to inform you that my comment was copypasta.
---
The original comment comes from an officer of the guild "surprise" on the Arugal server. It came from a popular post a few days ago.
---
Farmed for crimson whelp. Took 8 hours. But less money since low level
---
I'm excited for that much use from it. Now to focus on farming gold for that sweet, sweet mount !
---
My wife still brings up I went and got a sandwich.
---
Not everyone takes that at the 45-55 respec. 
---
Wanting can still have its place but it becomes real damn hard to find a high damage shadow one post 50ish at this point in the game.
---
How in the hell does anyone get this much gold :'(
---
Snape killed Dumbledore!!!
---
Imagine being such a mentally stunted idiot that you think Antifa, a group (and I use that term loosely) whose worst offense so far is a few assaults at protests, is comparable to racist radicals who’ve killed/injured hundreds of innocent people in terrorist attacks in 2019 alone in the name of their cause.
---
I can’t even wrap my brain around anyone who can even attempt to be a centrist anymore. You’re part of the problem if you try to make excuses for the far-right, there’s no difference in my eyes than people making excuses for any other terrorists.
---
Warriors are top tier raid dps, any guild worth their salt will have numerous positions available. If you're willing to have multiple gear sets and respec to cover tanks you're among the most valuable players available.
---
You've done a great job here. Can you please post a raider one next?  Love your  work!!!
---
He just wants publicity.
---
I say buddy in arguments all the time and ppl on the other end get more mad, hmm.
---
That's not kidding, that's a dog whistle to his viewers to ninja loot while retaining plausible deniability.
---
Hey all new to wow so my question what does it mean to COD someone I see it in the ma box but don’t really understand it I sent some things through cod but don’t get it is there a chance I get scammed? Or how does it work thanks
---
Your fault for playing on a streamer server
---
Oh sorry you must know Roy way better than me.
---
All I said is that Chilldude wasn't a part of the crew back then (when we all played WoW).
---
If he was a childhood friend and a WoW player I'd probably know him. It's not too complicated.
---
He just wants attention at this point. Trying to imitate asmongolds attitude. So happy i’m not on that shitty streamer server.￼
---
This is a big issue in society today. Regardless of how toxic he is, or you claim he is, you're trying to condemn someone for something there's no evidence for just because you don't like the guy
---
I know which is worse
---
Thank you! I appreciate you saying that.
---
Ah wish I wasn't stuck in oceanic, it's a 12 hour time difference on an to realm here

Even more interesting to hear that this jackal was friends with Chilldude and then blocked him after ninja’ing.
---
If you plan on rolling alliance come to Herod
---
Nah definately an rs player though. '10 hours of x' posts are quite common in the osrs sub
---
He's not going to get fucking permabanned for tricking people, you absolute moron.
---
You're seething so hard you can't think logically.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
*Insert Terrence and Phillip Joke*
---
LOL, well you are cool for saying so.
---
At first I thought you were an honorable rogue, then I saw the second horde come in, didn't do a thing. Meanwhile you disgraced your faction and family by not allowing the 1v1 to play out.
---
Show my on the puppet where asmon and his bad friends touched you
---
This guy is scum. I hope he gets camped. Streamer trash
---
In Vanilla, the most important spec is the one you enjoy playing.  What's the point of killing stuff 30% faster if you just want to log off after a few quests?  If you're a min-maxer, check it out, but don't sweat it.
---
Not greedy, just common sense. You don't bring a 2nd Tank 'cause they wouldn't bring anything to the table worth having. Same with most Rogues if they can't lockpick.
---
When healer is oom too? Right!
---
No I was just saying how can you not choose ruin as a talent in general lol I always go ruin, never afflic demo
---
Obviously, there's lists of pvp twink items somewhere right?
---
You sir get a cookie for this one.
---
LOL stay triggered, kid!
---
Such rage. Typical warriors ;)
---
Pretty sure (as others have stated) you’re in the Quel’Thalas placeholder. If you checked your location should have even told you so. If not, then swimming further east along the coast would lead you to it.
---
Yep I'm going to start doing this too. Instantly need and have the rest do the same.
---
If anyone deems it unfair, I'll put it up for a reroll.
---
nice shot, Alt+Z should hide your interface for next time for an even better one
---
Got a new pet at level 40 (had old one since level 10), but now i have no training points to learn skills. Whats the best way to gain training points?
---
I just want to chain gank these streamers, old school style. Just grief the literal fuck out of all of them.
---
can you also buy my hyacinth macaw parrot pls thx.
---
I rarely run into toxic people. But it’s every game and most people now sadly
---
Upvoted because it’s not the usual “50k xp an hour super yeet swag mega spell cleave with3 mages” 
---
Looks like you had fun thanks for sharing.
---
Everything seems to drop a lot more move never had so many greens dropped at all in classic
---
It's whatever u want. That's point of a pvp server. You can fight fair or dirty and be a dick about it, no one's stopping you, but that doesn't mean people can't judge you / call you out.
---
That's the beauty of pvp servers: it's your choice!
---
This guy is just a huge loser. Stopped by his Twitch to confirm my suspicions. Total loser.
---
I feel it would do better on neutral AH with paladin, but more so a twink item.
---
Ghostlands is farther to the east. This area is actually still undeveloped in retail wow.
---
I've made the switch at 40. Mainly because  love healing dungeons and was tired of having to change gears.
---
I'm lvl 44 and not actually feeling that powerful as people say, I have to drink a lot still. My gear is crap, though. However, it is nice and refreshing, the playstyle completly shifts. 
---
Actually, I would recommend just doing whatever you want, if I did't heal in dungeons I would just farm SM mail gear and still play enhance, though.
---
Ironically when you ask people for evidence of how toxic Asmongold is nobody is able to find any examples. The sub is, to normal users, a lot more toxic by comparison
---
It's always something he did or said years ago which honestly isn't all that surprising lol
---
He literally has admitted as much in his streams and his guild officer got caught ninja looting. 
---
Menta gymnastics are amazing tho
---
Also, maybe do a few guild runs with a diverse make-up i.e. w/ no one that wants what you want but they want other things.
---
Help I have brain damage
---
I don’t think they care. Sodapoppin got banned for layering and he has a huge following.
---
As a mage I use arcane missiles occasionally for three reasons:
---
1) it is a decently high dps move to help finish a mob.
---
2) instant cast means it's good for finishing off a runner and is no cooldown such as Fire Blast.
---
3) it gets boring just spamming frostbolt or fireball over and over.
---
Plot twist - this guy is trolling and trying to make unsuspecting noobs hold on to worthless junk
---
FYI, Meta isn't actually an acronym. It's just a shortened prefix which refers to something 'outside' a concept or something that is self-referential.
---
Fair, just curious if it usually goes for more on ally side because or palas and how it would fair in neutral AH. For reference I just sold ankh of life for 3.20g and that item is literally trash.
---
OP, were you on Arcanite Reaper?
---
And that probably wouldn't have happened if Asmon didn't ninja Ozzy's helmet!
---
It also has a hunter trainer and you can go fishing pretty much whenever you feel like!
---
That is utill 55-60.
---
And a chode
---
Just got that staff as well!!!
---
True, but if they disagree, the Rogue can just say, "Ok then, unlock it yourselves guys."
---
This. I just want to level and not die to horde players 10-20 higher than me. Also because on my server the horde heavily outnumber the alliance doing wpvp always escalates into a circle of ganking which basically halts my questing and leveling, and since I dont have an infinite amount of time to play each day I have to spend it wisely.
---
When my warrior is lvl60 I'll be happy to crack some horde skulls.
---
You definitely do
---
3 per room is more like it.
---
So it's a witch hunt then
---
Now you know why he told them to roll greed.
---
&gt;Will I be denied groups because I’m elemental? Can I be a competitive dps in raid or am I stuck playing resto to gear my elemental shaman?
---
Probably going to be healing in PvE, though it's worth noting it's not as terrible as other shit hybrid specs (enhance, ret, balance) once you have gear from phase 4/5. Until then, it's awful though, and it's only okay after.
---
&gt;Would I have a place in premade groups later?
---
Absolutely! 30-0-21 is a must-have for your 10man WSG premades. While you always see one in a premade, more often then not, you'll actually see 2 of them. This is a super fun spec to play and is super skill intensive - you're expected to alternate between healing and doing damage, and that can often be the difference between winning and losing a teamfight. 
---
&gt;Can I duel other classes and have a good chance?
---
Yeah, though you're at your strongest right around now. Other classes sort of outscale you in the duel (in particular, they get a lot more effective HP, which can be an issue for you). 
---
Ultimately though, a lot of the FOTM casters can be a problem for you. There's basically nothing you can do against a soul-link felhunter warlock. Mages are tougher as they get more HP, but earlier on, if you avoid their CS and manage to purge their shields, you can burst down their relatively lower HP pool. Spriests are a sort of similar story - purge the shield and try to burst them. Issue is they can silence you, and chain stun you, and heal off of it. 
---
For everybody else, it's gonna depend a lot on the consumes of each side. You want to keep the melee off of you.
---
I am a 55 Troll hunter, did not grind a single lvl. It came all by quests. Didn't even grind for gold and got my mount with 41. I really don't get why it's so hard for some people, maybe it's a hunter thing.
---
I believe only Action Bar 1 changes stance states.
---
Oh i forgot! Every pieceof anecdotal evidenceis true!  My mistake, carry on friend.
---
You could also give elvui a shot - it takes a bit of getting used to and the aesthetics don't please everyone though.
---
Nice I’m gonna do this on my dual box mate team 😘
---
Exactly my experience.
---
We pronounce it like that cuz thats how grammar works bro
---
This dudes face looks like he’s not allowed within 500’ of a school.
---
Same here I'd say it depends on who they are and how they say it my little brother and I haven't said each other's actual name in years we just call each other buddy, but some dick that comes into work being a flog calling me buddy would piss me off. Just my opinion
---
We do get to treat them like shit in classic though, because they play like shit lol
---
This kind of behavior is why Dwarves are the only acceptable choice on Alliance.  
---
With love from Redistribution of Grobbulus
---
And Canada that's why I'm asking
---
Yes and no. Even McDonald's has ads, everyone knows about McDonald's but seeing the name is what can push someone to go to them over a competitor.
---
I mean, Druids are the only other viable tank, and part of the reason they are viable is because of the way that gear dropping works in WoW (and MMOs generally). If every tank is a warrior, every tank is less likely to get the gear they want, whereas Druids are getting gear from an entirely different pool. If acquiring gear was trivial in Classic, there would probably be even more Warrior tanks lol.
---
Lol he probably didn’t have the gold cuz he donated it to asmon
---
It means taking the item for yourself when the agreement was to roll on it. In this case he told everyone to roll greed on it and then he rolled need on it after the rest of the party did indeed selected greed. So it gave him the item without competition because he broke EULA by lying to his group and conned them into rolling greed.
---
Guy should be banned from blizzard and from twitch.
---
Just hit lvl 40. Got riding skill but am 12g shy of mount. So close.
---
If anything, 2004 to 2019, people have gotten far more sensitive.
---
&gt;I make sure everyone knows what a cool kid horde I am through wearing blizzards horde merchandise and trying to recruit for my faction.
---
Just because your mom might think youre cool does not mean you are.
---
On a rage roll today, aren't we sweetcheeks? Senior year that rough on you?
---
Might surprise you that people pick factions for many reasons. I did it because it is fun corpse camping the hordling ragers
---
Good for you. More relevant to the discussion at hand, you don't care about my words. 
---
Why is that? Do I frighten you with my frank discussion of the ethics of deliberately inflicting emotional distress? Is that why you try to change the subject with every reply?
---
Okay that’s a sweet bag addon what’s the name of it
---
&gt; It's "just stats" for hunters too. It's hilarious that you don't understand that.
---
Holy fuck you're retarded. What do you think Hunters do for damage? They shoot their fucking bows/crossbows. That is their main source of damage. Whereas for a warrior they shoot it once **MAYBE**. Did you forget that weapons have a damage range assigned to them?
---
Aw, I think SM is one of the best instances in the game, but do you. I see why you want to avoid boring farm groups. I'm gonna start leveling a druid instead of mage for this reason as constantly aoe farming will get old fast. Maybe just find a good leveling guild? Also no one is forcing you to farm it over and over....Just run it a few times to get your gear and quests and move on.
---
Pretty much. Sound exactly like my pvp server, but minus any queue time at all these days (despite being on of the higher-ish populations) and these hip streamers having dibs on an item. Kind of laughable if the OP thinks that server is a unique experience.
---
&gt;The only thing I expect priority on is ranged Weapons.
---
And I say that is unreasonable. Agree to disagree I guess.
---
just add 'classic' to your google search for the addon you want.
---
if you want to browse addons:
---
- The Tavern
---
- Curse
---
- Git-hub. Some addons are being held there now, which is nice
---
- Twitch app
---
I think you’re jumping the gun a bit. 
---
Right now there isn’t much reward for engaging in world PvP and a much higher downside as others have commented.  
---
If anything, I would say it’s a testament to the intelligence of alliance players in not wasting their time in activities that are potentially more detrimental than beneficial while leveling.  The only time it really is useful to wreck someone is if you’re competing for the same spawns and killing will speed up the quest progress. 
---
All that said, at higher levels, pvp for alliance and horde is rampant. I feel like Blackrock Mountain is a battle zone that’s constantly changing hands.      Both factions camp instance entrances, in some cases for hours just to PvP.   Un’goro likewise is also is a war zone where both factions compete for Devilsaur leather. 
---
Once phase 2 drops, it’s going to be a whole new ballgame.
---
np.
---
imo, herbalism/alchemy is relatively quick to lvl the skills up and it's a huge money maker. if you're lvl 40 or higher, i would say make the switch.
---
Yup.
---
On my server, I have yet to be attacked, even once, by Alliance in the same group size and/or level range as me.
---
Literally always outleveled or outnumbered by Alliance; has been good/fun practice killing higher level than me, or getting them down really far before they finally get me, etc
---
People should just start ninjaing from Asmon's guild on that server
---
&gt; I would like answers
---
good fucking lord, who the hell do you think you are? and you realize you mouth breathers wouldnt have anything to read if you "banned" any topics relating to him right? 
---
&gt;How am I being toxic
---
Because you want to force your feelings on everyone here, like i said, dont like him? dont click the fucking links.  pretty simple.
---
Haha no worries! Nature swiftness is a great ability because it works with any cast. So can nature swift + Chain lighting/lightning bolt for some burst. Instant ability is more DPS overall than the last ele talent which basically just guarantees a crit.
---
Damage meter fan got me laughing, great slapstick :D.  
---
It's just missing the mana junkie - I had people who got angry because the tank pulled the next trash mobs while they were on 50% mana and drinking, as if this puts the group at a huge risk.
---
completely missed the point
---
Brokentooth, its a cat that spawns every 7-8 hours in the badlands, I guess it was lvl 34 or something like that.
---
That's a great anecdote, but if that's how we're doing it, I haven't ever seen it happen.  You just have shitty people tanking in your guilds I guess.
---
They don’t know what they want. They want to stay in their comfort zone mindlessly speeding through quests without having to engage in gameplay. It’s sad
---
I get that Last Stand is a 1 point wonder skill (or 3 points really as I dont think the bloodrage one is best), but is a 10 minute cooldown skill really going to be the difference between a make or break build?  It doesn't even feel like its as powerful an oh shit moment as challenging shout when you lose all control and it can save the day, more like a maybe this might help out but no guarantee or anything.
---
Defiance though I can see consistently helping out and helping your DPS push higher for faster clears too.  I was thinking that Improved Shield Block alongside it might be the real 1 point wonder skill here.
---
As others have said here, sm lib is fast and that staff drops all the time. Even if you went with a group of full casters, there's a decent chance no one else would need it.
---
That said, at 39 I'm sure there's something better.
---
Make your own group. Clear Dungeon. Kick Everyone. Open the chest by yourself
---
Apparently he doesn't even know 'Dudechill' and all that stuff about them being friends for a long time is all a lie.
---
You’re a joke
---
it’s a kids game lol
---
You can turn that off in the interface.
---
Never liked asmon or any of his fan boys. Literal embodiment of toxic self centered elitist basement virgins. What shocks me the most is the fact that these dudes have been playing wow for so long but still suck at every challenging aspect and mechanics in the game. I versed asmongo a few times in arena when he would get carried to glad (cuz he sucks too much to do it himself) ... literally plays the game like a tunnel visioned moron.
---
He basically has elitist attitude because he knows he’s trash but he’s dumped his whole life for the game, he needs to justify. 
---
If you notice any wow player who is actually a good player never carries a toxic or elitist  attitude but rather a humbling one and usually eager to help and reach out to players trying to get better. 
---
Literal
---
Trash
---
Humans
---
People saying Asmongold is toxic and bad because of the stuff he did in persona a few years back are the same people that wanted James Gunn back for GotG 3
---
Yes, everyone agrees to the loot rules and they follow them.
---
Yes it is up to the leader to masterloot in case people do want to ninja the item on reserve.
---
This. 
---
In a city, charge what you will to open lock boxes just like a mage would to port people or make food. 
---
In a dungeon, fulfill the roles of your class and be a good team player. I don’t expect to tip a mage for water in a dungeon as that is one of their utilities they bring to an instance that makes it run faster/smoother.  I play a priest and my buffs cost reagents to cast, which cost money. I don’t expect players to pay me to buff them or heal them.  A rogue should open locked chests, as that is one of the utilities they bring to a dungeon run. 
---
No offense, but DPS is very easy to come by in an instance run, and if you establish yourself as a rogue that is greedy and selfish, you’ll make it even harder on yourself. As it is, with no auto-group finder, the current classic meta has made it harder for non-mage/warlock DPS to get into instances, so your mentality will only make it harder for you.
---
if this isnt a troll comment please go to therapy
---
That mf funny as hell tho
---
muh vanilla experience
---
I'm sorry
---
They dont and they are one of the best levelers because of it. They should have no downtime most of the time
---
Well then fuck em throw them to the side and burn em
---
I am not forcing anything. I am having a discussion and asking if we can ban him and his content based on ninja looting.
---
I am asking you for answers since you are coming at me sideways
---
I don’t need to read anything from some streamer streaming shit from 15 years ago brodie. 
---
Tbh never even used twitch just don’t like ninja looters
---
I have done mythic azshara, and that is a lot more difficult than anything in classic.
---
I would question the difficulty statement. Mostly because you can tell when the game wants you to die...
---
It that time when a green mob parrys 4 times dodges once and you miss... these are your last 6 attacks mob has 3% health
---
I'm a lvl 57 feral druid and I still have this staff. Am I retarded? Druid weapons are just stat sticks. And I haven't found any weapons with better stats yet xd
---
Looks hella funny
---
Yeah indeed. I have done this a lot and always I am stuck at rock or tree or something.
---
Don't project, champ.
---
I hate that reddit has shifted to this All Need mentality. So I HAVE to pay 250g for the pattern for truefath vestments just because it’s BoE. It drops from a specific dungeon. I SHOULD be able to farm it like the rest of my gear. But no. I instead have to buy it and then drop a ton of gold on materials on top of that.
---
Back in vanilla, you needed what you needed and greeded what you were going to sell.
---
This “it’s the only safe way” bullshit is idiotic. Blizzard is literally on your side against ninjas. 
---
Luckily this stupidity isn’t rampant in game. I’ve seen both the Warlock and Mage tailoring patterns drop and we let the mage need (we’d seen him making runecloth bolts all dungeon). I won the greed roll for the Warlock one. I’ve seen a few “all needs” but usually people play by the rules. Not what reddit has apparently decided on.
---
Fuck asmongold. Fucking plague cry babe that ninja loots and sets horrible examples for the whole community. Ban him.
---
Start kicking them from any PuG and group possible. Preferably waste their tioome before doing so.
---
Idgaf about anything other than ninja looting. No snowflakes here. His only crime is ninja loot
---
Lol you can jump into any pug as a feral tank and expect to do better than the warriors
---
"cutting edge" world first guilds and speed running guilds use feral tanks for efficiency
---
I dont play wow can someone explain what happened here?
---
maybe you don't know what's been going on, but the OP is not a blacksmith, he's a rogue, and has started several threads about why rogues should be entitled to locked chest in instances because they can open them. 
---
He made this thread because he's now trying to compare blacksmith keys to the rogue ability lockpick because he thinks somehow this will prove his point. 
---
My response to him has nothing to do with blacksmithng, because that's not actually the argument he's trying to make. His argument is still about rogues and their lockpicking ability.
---
Now you're all caught up.
---
Should have leveled skinning just for that occasion!
---
You can but not a single fucking rogue will craft keys over just leveling lock picking.
---
Go north to the next zone (name escapes me rn) where the yetis can be up to L34/35, and those ones have a much higher drop chance. (Difficult to solo, but with a group you can wreck them and finish the quest quite a bit faster than fighting the ones in Hillsbrad)
---
Western Plaguelands
---
Do more of these with different mobs pls, oh great one.
---
I leveld in scholo - boss - was portet and killed the 3 onehit guys... Epicness guaranteed
---
"Whoa! I'm so fast!" That out the icing on the douche cake...😧
---
I mean he sits all day playing wow, quite clear he lost at life already
---
If you have Questie addon, you can just look at the world map to find quests.  
---
If you want to do dungeons, I'd start doing Black Rock Depths.  52 you can get started on the escort, arena, and early bosses.  
---
Otherwise Western and Eastern Plaguelands
---
Are people really that mad that someone ninja looted an iterm, it happens people just move on. Or is because they are associated with amson and the sub for some reason has a hate circlejerk for the dude.
---
Dumb advice seeing how ppl have gotten banned for ninja. I mean, besides being shitlord behavior.
---
Hahaha she has the extra chromie
---
having a discussion? jesus christ, you really are clueless and to add to why youre toxic? the many posts removed from you using 2nd grade insults for one, one good thing from this is youll prolly be banned LOOOOOOOOONG before post on asmon, good riddance crybaby.
---
I love Asmongolds content.
---
Bring me more salty tears u morrons.
---
P. S u always need on epics u got played.
---
Thanks so much!
---
Just don't take mages, warlocks or hunters into your group. Some shadow priest rdps, rogue a cat or better an OOMkin and you can enjoy dungeon run at slow pace.
---
Depends. Progression raiding, for instance, can involve hours of wiping every night. People are clearing MC on Classic in less than an hour.
---
and you ofc gave her an ingame  [RING](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7337/the-rock) ?
---
soooo who's Asmongold and why does everyone hate him?
---
I believe it was more the "being racist, homophobic, and sexist is not decent or normal" attitude. One that I hope most people can agreee upon
---
This ! So much so
---
Would you let a BS keep the entire chest because he is spending his own gold?
---
what do u expect from ppl from that guild?? asmonmold is litereally taking all the best items he want right infront of all the other players without even rolling them… the fact that u ppl join their groups baffles me.. u kinda asking for it urself when u join them… but guess its cool being in group and feed items to a guy who hasnt showered since launch( i guess he might have if hes shampoo is grease) and live in a garbage pile on hes moms and dads attic lol....
---
Winterspring, Plaguelands, Tanaris, Silithus if you're desperate
---
Who the fuck cares about asmongold and his guild mates.
---
That's what greed is for.
---
Casual means less alts so play the class you love most.
---
U dodged the Snowflake good for u!
---
Time you would have been afk for anyway. So its not like it REALLY hurt you to do it. And opening free or not im sure people still give tips. Amd you sure as hell dont pay people to let you open the boxes.
---
Why am I not even surprised by this....
---
Admin and his crew are the worst bunch of scums from this community.
---
Hehe, we still super broke in classic
---
But our guild wants an in game ceremony
---
Gonna make it happen this week
---
I admire the idea, but there’s something like 8k of them. These streamers have legions of fan boys joining up. They don’t need the outside community. Unless blizzard were to decide to go after them, there’s pretty much nothing the community can do to derail them.
---
He just directly claimed to me on his stream that Dudechill is a nobody to him, and that they may have played retail together, but they're not long time friends.
---
&gt;Whats stopping me from just saying "sorry cant open"
---
Literally nothing. Just do that.
---
BGs beeing cross realm will reduce the q times massively,
---
yes, ranks are server specific
---
Feed pet, fight and level with it, hours later all g.
---
He is talking about being a human being
---
The feelgood circlejerk ruins everything it touches to be fair.
---
If its reserved and established as the loot rules, you shouldnt take it.
---
Not following established loot rules is against the ToS.
---
Hey there. I'm created a discord channel for those who love to play/ or new to wow classic. We want make friend around the world, share game strategy, caring newbie, helping up each other etc. On the otherside , we also provide a free market channel and gold selling market. We'd like to  invire you to our discord channel. There's no hurt to dropping in. 
---
https://discord.gg/jQZGXa3
---
If someone ninjas just open a ticket. The only reason people like this method is because it lets them roll against people who actually need the items so they can make some gold.
---
Are they melee or ranged? Wonder if mages can aoe them
---
Chilling might
---
So asmongold ninjalooted once too?
---
This looks great! Will give it a try.
---
Blizzard ban please, make an example
---
Yes, yall should try it. "This rogue spent hours working on this skill? he better give us access to this loot or we are gonna call him greedy and blacklist him"
---
Got a troll rogue to 44. Then decided I was dumb to make a troll due to peer pressure at launch.
---
Decided to make an Orc hunter instead of rerolling the same class. Got him to 31.
---
Now I decided I should play what I wanted to play since day 1, Undead rogue. Currently lvl 12.
---
If it's what the people want, i'm happy to oblige.
---
No.  It's amazing for leveling.
---
My original server in vanilla WoW was Bleeding Hollow, and I remember Horrigan and The Enclave very well. Can't believe they are still around !
---
How long did it take to kill 1000 of them?
---
Also how do you keep track of that?
---
I have omnicc but it only show cd on my own spells after i use them
---
Awesome ty
---
There will be the same raids in phase 2. I am 54 and dont feel behind :)
---
Ah yes the fucking "plague cry babe" that sits in his room for most of the day streaming WoW while still earning ten times much as you.
---
Unfortunately they cast fireballs.
---
all the 6 year old ince comments that were shadowbanned for one, (still show up in your profile though, maybe learn how reddit works)
---
SO yes, being a terrible troll can get you banned, but keep crying about someone that live in your head 24/7
---
It really comes off as a joke to me.
---
Imagine having everything you ever say, even jokingly, clipped and taken out of context and having everyone hate you for what is almost certainly just a joke.
---
And people think its cool to play with asmongolds lame ass and his guild of fucktards.
---
I don’t really understand the problem here, for me it doesn’t seem like the subreddit would be full of asmon related posts. 
---
Yeah one or two pops up every day or so, but you can easily ignore it, it’s not like 50% of posts are streamer related. 
---
I also don’t know what Asmon did that’s so hated. Never watched the guy, I did watch soda tho. He didn’t seem like a complete bellend. 
---
(I just don’t find wow streams entertaining to watch since there is a lot of down time where nothing happens, and even when they doing stuff the game is repetitive enough for me not to enjoy it)
---
He was recounting different stories of him ninja looting and recently his officer got caught on screenshots ninja looting.
---
It’s been a shit storm and I just think we should remove it all from the reddit.
---
Thanks for clarifying that, I was wondering how hard this dungeon can be that an arms warrior cannot tank it anymore. I really don't want to go for a tank specc in this game and give up PvP completely once the battlegrounds are open...
---
The problem is, back in the day there were pvp guilds in other games, where stuff like this wouldn't happen. 10 years ago when major FFA pvp guilds were around, this guild would be griefed off the server just for being tools. I realize the scene has changed. Now get off my lawn.
---
Do mount speed increases affect flight path "mounts"?
---
Do most tanks just suffer from crippling social anxieties or something?  I have formed the vast majority of my dungeon groups and it really isn't a problem.  As a tank I can get something going in a matter of minutes.  DPS can look for groups for hours sometimes.  DPS have NO leverage in a dungeon setting.  None.  They are a dime a dozen and if they fail at doing their job there is a quick replacement just waiting for their spot.
---
I make my expectations known from the start.  Sometimes I intentionally form a spellcleave group because they are fun as fuck and VERY fast if the group knows what to do.  Sometimes I don't want that though and go with a more traditional setup.  I make it clear before I pull even 1 mob though that if you make threat a fucking mess you will be booted early.  I don't do this silently rage and run to Reddit to vent thing.  If you love dungeons and want them to be fun then take some responsibility for how they are run.
---
Seriously once again.  DPS have NO leverage in a dungeon setting.  Stop letting shit dps ruin the game for you.  Take out the trash and enjoy yourself.  Be the leader.
---
What’s the song name
---
Of course it is pretty sad to reserve loot if it's not like bindings from MC and you got 5 guys as pug.
---
But if you join into group that has reserved loot you are aware of that. No matter do you like or not you have agreed to respect that reserved loot. Just like in real life you are not going into your work place and break rules just because "I think this rule is bad".
---
I would say needing reserved item is ninja looting. Of course there should be master loot enabled but it could be just mistake that they forgot group loot on.
---
can this be used to silence my succubus?
---
If I quest and every single quest mob is dead it's time-consuming.
---
If I do a quest where I have to collect items, most of the time it's very time-consuming.
---
If I'm doing a quest where multiple waves of enemy's spawn it's difficult. A lot of those quests I could easily solo in retail because of the massive self-heal.
---
Sometimes it's difficult because I decide to play solo. One add to much and I'm dead. That's possible in retail too. But in retail I have so much escape possibilities that it's literally impossible to die.
---
In my opinion it's not difficult.
---
If I decide to look for a group it's really easy and mostly time-consuming.
---
That said I still enjoy it alot!
---
Are we surprised that kids who idolize shitlords grow up to become shitlords?
---
Anytime, happy farming!
---
Got him
---
I once auto ran from XR to the harpy area NW on the map, got stuck on a weird edge on the side of a mountain not 5 paces from aggro range of like 3 harpies. Would have had to corpse run for sure, was so surprised I made it.
---
About a weekish after classic launch i found a disgusting oozling for 25s, insta bought that shit
---
I’ve never seen twitch let alone a streamer for wow.
---
I just think it be easier to remove him and content related to him. It is polarizing and toxic.
---
I don’t care about him being ugly or Annoying or boring or wheat ever I just don’t like ninja looters and ninja guilds and ninjas
---
It’s like people already forgot a far right protester literally drove his fucking car into a crowd of people, killing a woman on camera. 
---
Leftist protesters throw a few punches..
---
“so much for the tolerant left”.
---
Stories meaning past-tense?
---
Yeah, as a mage for many years, it’s totally our responsibility in a group to feed the people. 
---
I have no issues selling food and water in the city to kill time and make some coin, but in a dungeon, it makes things run smoother and is part of our utility. 
---
It’s amazing how many people there are out there with such shitty attitudes. What I love about Vanilla is they can’t be so anonymous about it anymore.
---
Its not that bad as people say. Yeah sometimes you see a huge mob of people.outta nowhere but the world pvp they bbring is awesome.
---
LOL 😂 just give the example retard
---
Just pull with Deathwish and Zerker stance. While dual wielding.
---
Make those slackers work.
---
Dope. Thanks. 
---
I do think rogues have the ultimate decision power to either share locked loot or not. The are other utility things that come from bringing a rogue, like doors and lock boxes, which obviously wouldn’t be tipped. 
---
The exception to this, of course, would be in a guild raid or group, where the decision power leaves the hands of the individual. In a pug though, yeah, up to the rogue. The polite thing to do would be to tell them beforehand that you don’t intend to open chests for the group.
---
Already be a successful classic streamer
---
I rarely see someone as fixated as you on hating a person on the internet who you've never met or seen in real life. Good for you bud!
---
This cockmonger can go eat shit.
---
It'll go up, but not exceptionally like BiS twink items. 19 ally warriors use a quest 2h called Glacial Stone and horde warriors use Night Reaver.
---
The events are not location specific, can work for any raid/dungeon/meetup etc
---
I'm a caster at heart. Will roll a tank when my warlock is at a nice level.
---
Not sure to go armor smith or weapon smith though.
---
Still means he is a ninja
---
I stole 
---
I raped
---
I lied
---
I cheated
---
Those are admissions of guilt and revelations of characters
---
Not to say ninja looting is the same as those , just using it to illustrate how u don’t feel he is without guilt by at least association and history
---
But i like them
---
Lmao- knockback mechanic is always solid
---
Backstab spec. Lethality, imp backstab, and opportunity
---
Huge ambush crits massive backstab crits. Maximum burstiness
---
By all means, show us
---
&gt; Classic WoW had many big problems, being deathly boring to anyone of us who didn't have nostalgia, for example
---
Dude if its boring go play BFA super simple, no one is forcing you to play a deathly boring and broken game which has no quality of life features and has many mechanics which arent making any sense whatsoever.
---
I just log on, main city is stacked with people, queues still popping up during primetime and everybody keeps playing the game and having fun. So I dont see why they would need to change it for you so you start liking it as well - they dont. Just leave the game if its "deathly boring" to you.
---
I dont understand why you still bother to play a game you describe as deathly boring and where all the broken things annoy you?
---
&gt;I disagree. I think Improved Revenge, Improved Sunder Armor, and Improved Taunt are all great talents and very helpful in Deep Prot
---
All three are absolutely garbage and I will laugh at you if you take them. 
---
You can't stun things that matter with Imp Revenge. 
---
You don't need the rage from Imp Sunder and 3 rage for 3 points is a joke.
---
And you don't need Imp Taunt for anything. 
---
Those talents are only even marginally useful for trash, and I dunno about you, but I don't want to be a trash specced Warrior.
---
&gt;as is getting the full bonus from Toughness
---
Then go 31/0/20 and max out Toughness. You're overvaluing it over Cruelty, but whatever, if you want Toughness take it.
---
&gt;It also doesn't demand you to swap between weapons, and as I said earlier, Deep Prot is a lot easier/less gear dependent
---
There's no reason to be Deep Prot for anything but 40 man raid MTing. And even then, you shouldn't be doing that till at least BWL or AQ40.
---
&gt;I don't think arms tanking is bad
---
You straight up said "These idiots really think you can just arms tank UBRS with no problem.", "Enjoy getting your shit blown in in the 2nd half of the dungeon." and " If you're Pugging UBRS and MC right now, you sure as hell are gonna have a hard time as arms."
---
All of which is completely wrong, because Deep Prot offers zero(0) mitigation skills.
---
Which video games are you talking about?
---
Most games have just one setting and that is it, especially if we are just talking about MMOs or even RPGs. 
---
Ok so I pull a mob, I cheapshot it, slice and dice, spam SS.
---
I accidently pull 3 mobs. Harder game now right? Not really. Now I just add in evasion and BF. Was pushing those 2 buttons really more difficult? Sure maybe if I was 15 years younger.
---
But this is 2019.
---
Ah okay, stories when he was 15 and njnjalooted in vanilla. Show me a clip of him ninjalooting.
---
It’s still exposure. That guy who bought his mount hit the top of the front page. He’s going to get way more viewers after that. Think about it
---
Lock Life 💀
---
That’s a stupid reason not to ban him.
---
Most people conducting witch-hunts make this argument.
---
Find an example, please
---
You don't go out of LOS on a pull. The healer has to be healing you, not running after you. This was squarely on the tank.
---
How so?
---
I guess what I was getting at is the severe underestimation of the leveling process in Classic. In retail, even without heirlooms you’d be hard pressed to run out of mana, to die to multiple mobs, or not be able to solo elites. There’s no mobs resisting your spells, no immunity to bleeds, you’re not missing your attacks, etc.
---
I do it sometimes with the main goal of upsetting the other guy and saving myself the time and nuisance of a pointless argument.
---
Which realm is this?
---
Are you people so dumb to believe that Asmongold on Twitch is "real"? It is a fucking persona and him and Mcconnell just orchestrate everything to get more clicks.
---
Go watch one of his real talks or interviews, he is a normal dude.
---
He does't ninja stuff, he is the MT and he gets tank gear 1st, other people roll and he makes fake drama so people like you and this sub click on it and give him more fame by spreading it around.
---
&gt;Deeprot spec isn't needed before MC
---
What do you mean? Like could 40 people with barely any preraid bis gear, consumables, or experience, jump into mc and clear it without the mt having deep prot?
---
Is deep prot useless for warrior tanks no matter what gear they have?
---
As if this is going to change anything. This whole "Reputation" stuff is not relevant for people who are already part of a good guild.
---
I’m sure
---
Everyone who's burned a witch thought they had all the evidence they needed.
---
Wasn't there a picture of his desk where he had pee cups and stuff? I know hes a hoarder or close to it, I remember seeing a picture and it was absolutely vile.
---
Very mature reply
---
Hydra just came out with a disc PvP build I think. witch I believe a lot of people think is better then shadow anyways since you have less mana problems.
---
Can we still ban him tho
---
Ban this idiot
---
He entertains
---
I just dont like the examples he sets. And for a huge streamer on a game that i love, he does shady and crappy stuff. It shouldn't be allowed. I watched a few minutes of him and quickly got the scent of the person he is. I dont wish him anything IRL. Im talking game-wise. Ban him, sensor, anything. Hes toxic.
---
So, bad on u bud for supporting bad behaviour which goes directly against the game rules.
---
Sure, if that's what you want to believe my man.
---
Lol Holy fuck this sub is a joke
---
yeah lets continue on with the screenshots of landscapes and "this guy messaged me asking to join his guild wtf!" and "im warrior it hard to level :(" those sure never get old. drama is entertaining
---
Very
---
How does that effect you? Lets stop and focus on that. 
---
Caring about nonimportant people is how you make them even more famous .
---
I don’t know, it took me about two hours to get the jeweled pendant from Marg Speaks. Two of my friends got it on the second muckclaw they killed though, so I don’t know. Yes, I’m still mad about that.
---
You really are
---
♥️
---
People shouldnt have to do that... Doing this should be against the rules.
---
I remember doing this back in the day . I think it cost me around 190-210gold depending on mats.
---
Can’t always master loot for reserves. For example first orb being reserved for tank in strat live is the norm but can’t be master looted.
---
Thanks well the well thought out comment. You sure did change my mind. Everyone downvote me, this guy convinced me.
---
Iv just started ignoring assholes like this.  Iv spammed lfg as a healer and got invited by so many of these guys.  Idk why people need to be so try hard when the content right now isn’t even hard at all
---
Imp Shield Block is amazing it's worth speccing just for that, Last Stand is a game-changer (both as a raid cooldown and as a general quality of life tool), Defiance makes life better and 3/5 Toughness is nice to have.
---
I'd rate all of them very highly and I think Last Stand is fantastic personally. I always cringe when I see Warriors skip it, particularly the ones who take Imp Bloodrage but skip Last Stand.
---
Challenging Shout isn't anything special, handy when tanking instances but you don't really use it on anything that matters (One AQ40 trash pull I guess?), it's nice to have but it's nowhere near the utility of Last Stand.
---
LS gets super fun when you've got a Lifegiving Gem too. Both of which are fantastic in PvP.
---
People have changed... Most of them have a stick in a but for some unknown reason.
---
Yes. I have watched his stream and videos. I liked some of them. But most are just an endless cringe compilation. I like his mount and tmog competitions. He has good knowledge on those topics for sure. And I also believe he is not nearly as bad as his fans are. They edge him on to keep being a jackass.
---
Mount money I get it
---
I've never had an issue in my runs with people greeding boes. I guess it helps to play with people you know irl or for a long time. I wouldn't trust any one who associates with streamers like that.
---
Spending almost an hour waiting to go to Uldaman, skipped a ride to duel, then this happens
---
Yikes both the asmon supporters and haters in this thread act like a bunch of kids.
---
Of course he is. Did you see that dumb ass grin at the end?
---
Funny I had a night elf hunter and a dwarven warrior gank me while questing in the Badlands. I was low mana and quarter health. I took out the hunter and got the warrior to half health, he killed me but I always have my soul stone on when questing in contested territories. I got back up, death coiled/feared him into mobs then loaded all my dots on him and danced while he died trying to get back to me.
---
Asmongold does not lead a team of competent raiders. Nor has he been doing it for years. I am in little doubt guilds like apes will clear the content with easy. But everyone else, that I am not so sure off.
---
Ditto
---
The fact there isn’t an option to auto report these people via drop down menu blows my mind.
---
Questing in ruins of anderhol in your 50s is hard. Especially if you're not a leveling spec. This game is actually hard, coming from an ex FF14 player.
---
If the looting option is set so everyone can roll, how rolling against the ToS?
---
I have to say, I wouldn't even join said group if I'd really need the item.
---
It's a huge server so it's got that going for it. There is a vocal minority of streamer fanboys that shit up chat by purely communicating through twitch emotes, but aside from that it isn't much difference than most servers. Sitting in a 3 hour queue knowing you are competing for a server slot with some geek who just wants to follow around their simulated friend to give them handouts gets kinda old though.
---
Now that’s some RP level of good lookin’!
---
Toxic this word.....
---
Back in the days ppl where toxic as fuk and ppl grew a pair and manned up took the toxic shit and threw it back at ppl.
---
Nobody gave a fk and kept playing having fun.
---
Today a smal minority cries rivers when their world view crumbles around them because they are so got damn sensitive. Grow a fking pair and don't take everything so damn serius.
---
Giving sensitive lunatics a platform is devolving our race back to the dark ages.
---
So you are advocating censorship of all content that you dont like? Even if it is shit content, you need to grow up.  No one forces you to click every post in the subreddit. smh
---
Of course he will. They always do this.
---
Do something bad. Reddit brings it up. Streamer then catches attention and covers his ass up acting like reddit is the jerks here.
---
Thanks for this post, all your doing is giving him more content for his stream.
---
Have you tried all of the raids, or just MC?  The difficulty spikes are in BWL, Naxx and AQ.
---
Most people are, but you've decided that anyone who watches Asmon, or doesn't agree with your post must be a pro-ninjalooter, which is some prime mental gymnastics
---
10$ says this is OP's alt account.
---
The 5 food and mana potion you get out of a chest is worth loads though.
---
The blank spots, W/T are strafe L/R where I keep my pinky/index finger.
---
For the pet G is passive, H is defensive, and J is attack.
---
Not only for the purpose of selling, people ninjaed plenty loot for their class too.
---
You can't tell based on armor type alone, many classes can use "inferior"gear-types too. Warriors with leather, Shamans with cloth etc. Only Tier sets are restricted by class (and a few more special items).
---
But usually there is some kind of priority when playing with a more serious group / guild. The class gaining the most of it should be considered first.
---
Did you just assume it's gender?
---
I'm farming SM GY + Cath for gold / the butcher atm and i can't tell you the number of times i zone out of a portal and someone tries to kill me because they saw a nameplate and instantly attacked.
---
I'm 60 mate, enjoy your walk.
---
I guess I should have added more detail into my post. I was just trying to address the downplaying of difficulty mobs can pose.
---
My best tip is: interface&gt;Interact with left click
---
That way you can left click mobs all day w/o attacking opposite faction. 
---
This setting is a godsend.
---
Edit:forgot the C
---
I think it’s so weird people watch other people play games. Never seen a twitch stream personally so idk I just don’t like ninja looters
---
Oh shit adibags is working with classic? I had no idea
---
Grats ya nerds
---
Honestly, that kinda seems like a joke? I'm not really sure because I've only heard of the guy from this sub, but it gives off a jokey vibe to me.
---
I saw he was live and decided to listen in.  He’s arguing with chat trying to justify his ninja while at the same time being told by his wife they “aren’t rich” so shouldn’t order milkshakes from McDonald’s. 
---
This guy is delusional, and his life seems to already be in a rough spot. He should be reported and ignored.
---
I feel where you’re coming from. I hated Asmon when I first watched his stream. But now, I love the guy. He is way funnier than other youtubers making wow content imo and I find his persona as a complete elitist neckbeard totally hilarious, he has no shame. That being said, I sure as hell would never level my main in one of his guilds but I would like to run some of the world PVP events with them
---
my details has normal, crit and defences. I've always assumed defences meant parries/dodges/blocks.
---
I mean, you got enough people priding themselves with the toxicity of the old Modern Warfare lobbies, you got people losing their shit over games including black and/or female characters, and you got people excusing PewDiePie for using the n-word because it was "just a heated gaming moment", so...
---
The pvp system in vanilla is by far the worst ever implemented in wow. The idea of HK and DK is great but the amount of time you need to spend getting to rank 14 is silly. 
---
On the other hand it is patch 1.12 so classes etc... are tuned for naxx so don’t expect a challenge until AQ/naxx PVE content. Maybe some fights in BWL pugs will struggle with but co-ordinated guilds will steam roll it again.
---
You're blood is boiling thinking of Asmongold and you're calling someone "evil" for stealing a piece of gear in a video game. You're obviously way more pissed about this than a normal person should be.
---
Not assuming that at all. All I said was my position. Idc if you are a fan or a hater of him. The problem I have with him is he is a ninja looter at worst and at best pro ninja looting
---
I am taking you for your utility. If you dont want to bring it, enjoy the kick.
---
Same thing with a healer that should heal, a mage should provide water and a warrior use its battleshout.
---
Go back to retail if that is your mindset.
---
Asmongold said a few weeks ago on stream that ninja looting is no longer allowed at all. He said it while going through mail. I'm sure there is a clip somewhere.
---
Well I don't like people who cry and want people banned when they know nothing about someone. Ban you instead.
---
Are you in a raid group? 
---
I know it shouldn't matter, but maybe/hopefully that fixes it. 
---
Also, try disabling all of your addons and zoning in. If this works, enable each addon one at a time to see which one is the culprit.
---
Yup, this. 
---
Rogues, aren’t exactly in a good place for dungeons when other more useful DPS are to be had.  Lock picking is a small benefit they bring but it doesn’t override that they would probably be skipped over for a mage or warlock in a heartbeat if they both whispered to join a group simultaneously.  
---
The OP is just making sure he doesn’t get invited to future groups, and if I were a betting man, this whole post likely came up when he tried to pull this very same shit in an instance, got shit on by the group, and came crawling here hoping for support.
---
The reason he shouldn’t use vamp embrace is because of threat. Sure it’s decent heals but unless the SPriest is awful, they will pull threat. I pull threat without VE any time I’m not just multi dotting. And multi dot with VE on a target really is negligible heals.
---
Yeah I am for sure going to try out Naxx as that one seemed to be the most interesting in terms of design and complexity. Going to probably have to wait a few months until its out (last phase I think?).
---
&gt;there's still 4K+ followers split across their guilds that actively support the behaviour because it "makes their guild better".
---
that's literally the reason something is going to happen to him. if he was some nobody who ninja looted the reports would get lost in  a sea of reports blizzard cant be bothered to address. the fact that he's bragging about this to thousands of people means hes almost certainly going to be made an example of.
---
what a freaking bastard
---
... those one's arent keybound so he has to click so it makes sense for them to be bigger
---
The world chat spam made my first message unreachable but was basically me "Hey buddy! I noticed you lack a guild, have you thought about some?"
---
That was the only and single message i sent. I understand people tend to be suspicious but i have nothing to hide. Just wanted to share that some ppl have bad days sometimes and react in funny way
---
To answer your edit: because people are fucking stupid. The people downvoting you that is.
---
Totally depends on your guild.
---
Talk to your guild/raid leader or ask in gchat to get a feel for it.
---
You cancel culture crybabies are what's truly toxic. Yeah anyone who doesn't support banning Asmon is pro ninja looting. You guys are insufferable.
---
On my feral tank I only invite melees and hunter for dungeons and all my runs where super smooth and quick. We still hit the 5dungeons per hour cap in ZF because we zerged through the XP efficient parts too quickly. If you are horde and you get a windfury resto shaman in your group, damn never ever doing dungeons with those mages or warlocks ever again, they can aoe 1 time and than have to drink for 60 seconds until they can do it again.
---
Best part is, if the rogue or dps warri has aggro the guy can just take some hits while the mage just instantly shatters and explodes.
---
Can only say at the point where I ignored any casters for my dungeon runs, my enjoyment for the game just doubled.
---
Let the mages and warlocks do their 4 mages 1 warlock groups and exclude them from party play. Best option ever.
---
I’d double check but i vividly remember farming blue whelps in winter spring or something. It I believe was the most common whelp drop.
---
cuz they don't have keybinds so he has to click are you dumb
---
Signed.
---
Start the petition. This whole sub is pretty wack anyways lol. I just don’t like ninja looting.
---
This mindset drives me crazy. "He is popular therefore he must take on the mantle of leadership and behave in a way I deem acceptable" is nonsense. Just because you become popular doesn't mean you need to change who you are as a person. Asmongold has never been a person that portrays himself as a paragon of virtue so asking him to be that is expecting him to be a person that he is not. It is a failing proposition and it would come across as very disingenuous if he was to try and act in that way. 
---
Im by no means an Asmongold apologist or think a lot of the stuff he does is okay, but he is the person that he is and the most you can do is not watch him and hope others will do the same.
---
Seen epics in it and a lot of blue boes.
---
By your own logic though, the pristine hide comes off the mob that the group killed, so it belongs to the group.
---
I come check out this sub a few times a day and 90% of the stuff I see are shitty memes and "wOW GuYS LoOk i  FiNallY GOt mY mOUnT" -type low effort crap. There's hardly anything about streamers, save for the occasional highlight. So I'm not sure what you're talking about.
---
&gt; This sub is a joke
---
I do agree with this though, but probably for a different reason than you.
---
He's online right now! RoysonTV. We should spam the shit out of him with screenshots of his ninja looting.
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
The community can get pissed off all they want, but the only way Asmon and his crew will give a fuck is if people stop following and subbing to them.  Right now, the more drama they can create, the more $ they make.  They are eating this up.
---
White leftist thoughts lmao
---
also some hunters immediately multi-shots. even if you pull them with a bow.
---
He also streams, and some people love asmongold so much they'll watch and anyone in his circle, or they'll watch anyone edgy who likes to do controversial things. This guy will be getting real money for doing it, too.
---
Curse of doom only does damage after it expires. Seems like you are clipping it and resetting the timer before expiration.
---
[LOL](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/330/819/e47.png)
---
Bad news guys! Blizzard forced a name change on that toon. It's tragic D:
---
You can report them, Blizzard doesn't allow building exploits to avoid gaurds.
---
Looks like a damn weasel
---
Both are nobodies...
---
A web comic based on wow classic is my current patreon goal.
---
You'll have way better gear by the time that set comes out.
---
Quiver doesn't affect wand speed, that was only on private servers.
---
Who's that Pokémon?
---
Just hit 40 and got my mount, as a gnome, is there anyway to not get a headache listening to this bot for more than 20 seconds? Strafing helps but it’s difficult to see where I’m going.
---
Read the convo. The worldchat made the first message literally unreachable. But it was me noticing the dude in TB and whisping: Hey buddy! I noticed you lack a guild, thought about a social one?
---
Waaaaaah
---
Asmongold has been away at TwitchCon for the weekend.
---
An officer from one of the alt Olympus guilds (Roysun is not in the main guild) steals a piece of loot and y'all want to grab your pitchforks and skewer a dude that ain't even been online for 3 days.
---
What do you all expect Asmongold to do? Leave TwitchCon and fly home just to boot the dude out of the guild? He's already sent out a notice to all his viewers to stop ninja looting. It's amazing y'all can quote him verbatim telling his viewers it's okay to ninja loot but when he tells them to stop, you all conveniently forget that.
---
You guys are shit, just as bad as he is. Half your complaints about him are just made up and now you want to hold him responsible for some dude he doesn't even know when he doesn't even have access to a computer to do anything about it.
---
he paid everyone in the group for a BoE he can't equip just so he could try to sell it?
---
yeah that makes sense.
---
This guy gets it \^
---
edit: ^ Imagine being as dumb as these two.
---
No it doesn't.
---
They are used very rarely. 
---
...you know I'm talking about the hearth, first aid, herbalism, cooking, etc buttons right?
---
Exhibit A
---
Highly doubtful that it'll be fixed. Anything that was possible in Vanilla, is going to be possible in Classic, even if it's an exploit. If Blizzard fixed this exploit, then there would be intense backlash from the "no changes" community of classic. However I believe it is against the rules to exploit to avoid the guards, so it is ground to report them.
---
I'm just sick of everyone here concerning themselves with someone they don't have too.  
---
You're all annoying.
---
I'm not attacking you. I appreciate your work.
---
Wait a minute, are you saying that Battle Shout (that increases attack power) works better for threat than sunder armor? I don't read much on forums and stuff, so this is all news to me! Can i just spam battleshout and keep aggro? How often do i spam it? Wasn't shouting spam fixed a while ago?
---
Blizzard just breeds bitches. Thought it was just Hots but fuck. Whiners everywhere.
---
Man that's like such a logical stretch it actually makes you look incredibly dishonest. Nobody is pro ninja looting except the ninja himself. Quit attacking people for having a chill attitude towards content curation/censoring on this sub.
---
As a healer, I'm stoked for healer shortage. Though I'm already making myself a name as a healer.
---
Wow two pieces of shit.
---
Its the mating call for pacifists.
---
SILVER?
---
Well he is the biggest wow streamer, so as much as it leaves a bad taste in my mouth, he does foster a lot of community for anything World of Warcraft. All that aside, his role in the community isn't really relevant as he should have the same rights and responsibilities as any other community member. This means he'd need to break one of the rules of this subreddit to justify a punishment.
---
The only rule I can see that he could be rationalized as having broken is rule 4:
---
"Do not share or encourage the use of exploits, cheats, private servers, or other illicit game behaviour"
---
Since GM's have made it clear that deceptively tricking party members into allowing you to take rewards in a dishonest way is against the games ToS, you could consider his ninja looting (and general support of it) an "illicit behavior". The problem is, he isn't really coming here and sharing it. Having some user posting evidence he's done it, or a clip from his stream where he says "Hey guys, ninja looting is cool!" isn't his violation - rather it's the violation of whatever user brings that content here because THEY are the ones who endorsed that behavior on this platform. Unless Asmongold has come here himself and made posts saying "Everyone should ninja loot - here's how and why" he hasn't really violated rule 4 and even if he has, banning him seems too harsh, since if it can happen to Asmon, it could happen to any of us. Do you want to get banned a few months from now when you endorse an in game practice that a GM decides later is againts ToS?
---
I always have a movie or tv show on my other monitor playing unless I’m doing something that requires real focus.
---
I once mistakenly sold WC blue belt from Lw for 2 silver and someone insta sniped it 1 frame after it was listed and when i wrote to him asking him kindly if i can have it back all i got was "nah".
---
Where them nice AH snipers at?
---
U know playing with friends is one way to remove ninja looting.
---
Or just roll need on Epic loot!!
---
learn and move on or learn nothing and die
---
You would then need to ban all streamers, not going to happen, ignore it an move on
---
gonna be so much schadenfreude if he gets permabanned from wow AND twitch
---
&gt; Roll for your role. What could be more fair than that?
---
That's a great way to even further reduce the amount of people willing to tank and heal your dungeons. For a class that can heal, being the healer is usually the most efficient role for that class in a dungeon, so it's better for everyone involved if that's the role they take for the sake of efficiency. That does not need to mean that in most cases literally any other time these classes will be running around in dps gear, killing stuff, just like everyone else. Why would you try to shut them down when they want to roll for their damage upgrades (assuming you're not grouping with people you will raid with).
---
What do you mean? There’s screenshots and he admitted it on livestream.
---
You can purge the sl buff from dem wl pet (but not from the wl). This should help alot.
---
I don’t understand why you started your statement off with “nah” lol, what I said was correct as someone who played OSRS for 2 years and has been playing PoE for 3
---
Alright, then I'll go to level 51 first. This should be entirely possible then. I ran ZF at level 42 as well.
---
TIL YOU DIE
---
nobody said he was a childhood friend tho, its pathetic you are tho lmao
---
I was selling savory deviate delight in trade as a level 19 a few weeks ago and someone asked me if I was a 19 twink, when I said no he said I was blacklisted and put me on ignore.  
---
I still have no idea what happened
---
How do you think I could've put that argument sentence better? I've few times been in situation where I feel like I have something to still say, but simultaneously it's not that serious discussion where sides disagree heavily, and you kinda want to say that this is the last comment without being rude. But I imagine it sounds a bit rough to talk of arguments/arguing.
---
Just to become better forum user. Generally better to minimize  chance of someone rustling their jimmies :P
---
Then it is alright.
---
Ban u/BalesBerga for being a whiny little pussy
---
I understand some people doubting the convo! But to clarify
---
1) world chat nonstop cleavespam made my first and only message unreachable
---
2) yeah i do know already you can put chats in separate window
---
3) the only message i whisped him (when i met him in thunder bluff in evening) was: Hey Buddy! I noticed you lack a guild! Have you thought about one?
---
How dare I use all tools accessible to me in game.
---
I second this, if you aren't hit capped, this is a great option.
---
Who hurt you in Fortnite?
---
Please please please
---
Recount, maybe?
---
Wrong, but draw shitty conclusions all you like
---
Nope
---
This hasn't happened to be once on my server
---
Your step mom thinks so too ;)
---
I hate questing, 40 people doing one quest on one side and 40 people on another. You just stand near 1 or 2 mobs waiting for them to respawn. And some quest are very stupidly made, you had to kill 10! of them and there are only 2 of them spawns in entire map!!! Those quest are pain in the ass to complete even if you are alone and nobody kills them except you. With other players around you had to spent 3-4 hours just for one stupid quest.
---
Damn... I hope this comment doesn't hurt his feelings.
---
Can i see the sentence you called him buddy?
---
I don't even know, man.
---
Guy's not worth getting upset over. He's absolutely pathetic.
---
Yah I know, now why don't you link the clip where he tells people to stop or he's gonna kick them, from a week ago?
---
Oh, that's right. You don't have that one.....
---
Nope, fixed track.
---
A beautiful moment before guerilla warfare begins👏
---
wau, really cant imagine anyone grouping up with this douch ever
---
Mind soothe is one under-rated spell. I hate mayself for waiting to 60 before i train it, it would have helped me alot while leveling.
---
I got both last night in less than 20 runs. Stoked tbh
---
I don't believe in potting in pvp.   All it proves is you have more gold than skill.
---
Congrats!
---
This is extremely entertaining, you put so much stock into a person you apparently hate so much. It is hilarious.
---
If loot is reserved then it’s on the group leader to switch to master looter, not doing so is on them and not anyone who rolled need.
---
Poetic justice to the douchefuckery of reserving loot and expecting pugs to do the work for them. 
---
Not a ninja, group leader stuffed up.
---
This was epic. I missed watching old style pvp vids. I love the old YouTube compilations . You certainly have that flair/playstyle.
---
Ninja looting everything
---
Yea it’s pretty lame your getting downvoted for asking about something you don’t know about.. 
---
I know for a fact you can do what your asking with mind blast and shadow word pain cause I can do it with no macros but it would be nice to have one. I thought this was the main reason for macros. Idk I don’t use them really
---
Haha, great one my man.
---
iirc they originally landed in whats now western Tirisfal - and soon departed because the people were being driven mad by 'something' (read: old god influence underground at that location, which I believe was the explanation for Xal'atath).
---
I highly doubt he is acting. He is a dickhead because he lacks emotional stability
---
They most likely didn't care, or they wouldn't be in his group? He never forced nor fooled anyone to do anything. Why can't we let people do what they want, even if what they want is boost their favourite streamer? I'm not one of them, but I don't understand the hate in this sub
---
Since peoples primary professions arent taken into account when a group is made, sure. Seems fair. But, your argument is that your profession is yours alone and you get everything. EVERY rogue gets lockpicking, its lart of that classes utility. You get that in addition to the other secondary profs and still getting two primary profs. Youll make more money over the course of your lockpickig life by opening boxes from peoe that tip you than youll lose by not winning rolls in dungeons and helping people who helped you.
---
As a rogue, yes you may not have leveled your lock picking and ok, thats one thing, but you absoloutly were invited with the thought that if there is something locked youre capable of opening it. You cant say its not fair to make that assumption since you are the only class that comes with that skill built in.
---
probably cause for years p servers were unreliable and dungeons weren't coded right and mobs would pull thru walls and shit like that.
---
If you think "so many people" will have 3k gold in their bags, I don't think you know how classic economy works
---
I just read about it on this sub and was trying to have a discussion to solve the conflict amongst the sub. 
---
Sincerely probably worded it too strongly but another user perfectly explained why I am flawed an I have conceded to them. Thank you
---
Why.
---
But I am brother and I love you
---
What reputation?
---
The light I see is that my guild for our raids has a massive healer shortage. We essentially need to double the numbers on our healers before we start raiding. Well and I already have a secure spot in the raiding team one way or the other.
---
Not a balance druid item imo
---
There was a hunter who forgot to buy ammo and was dps'ing in melee.
---
You do tho. Please link
---
Found asmongolds alt account
---
How do priests fare in world pvp and battlegrounds? Do you need to be specced in shadow to be viable?
---
Could we at least get a tag for posts about streamers so that I can hide them?
---
I'm pretty sure bonebiter is better and easy to get.
---
From what I noticed, a lot of tanks stick to healers they know. Because they like it to not wipe.
---
Isn't gouge just the best shit ever so far? Also leveling a rogue rn lol
---
THIS. Or when I’ve cleared a group of mobs guarding a chest and someone goes and loots the chest while I’m in combat
---
&gt;burning adrenaline was entirely random
---
i healed the fight when it was current, and no, its not random, your chance of getting BA is based on your threat, hence why once good dps are dead healers start to get blown. You people keep saying random like that existed in 2005 video games
---
The gold flows in once you’re in the 50’s. It’s not hard to make gold when everything you vendor or AH is worth a lot
---
r/Iamverybadass
---
Sounds pretty greedy of an assumption to make. “We assume you can unlock things but we won’t get mad when you don’t have this thing you should totally have and share with the group. But it’s ok if you don’t we understand.”
---
I don’t care lol just having a discussion
---
Part of adult life is being able to have discussions even arguments without involving your bias or feelings
---
Not talking down at you just explaining where I’m coming from
---
I play rattlegore friend and all this is a discussion
---
No.
---
See that’s productive discussion 
---
Something like that could work
---
Rexxar?
---
My Chieftain puttin them Alliance dogs in their rightful place...OFFA THUNDER BLUFF!
---
Thanks for the update
---
This is the toxiest community I have ever experienced frankly. The person in the post being a prime example. About 1/4 of the community behaves that way.
---
True. Guess I better keep on the grind. gl out there
---
Im happy they were no streamer when I played wow vanilla.
---
Why do we kill the dragons if they are good? Ive always wondered this
---
Appreciate the riveting discussion
---
Awesome. Thanks!
---
WHAT THE FUCK BLIZZARD
---
THIS DOUCHELORD IS OPENLY ADMITTING TO STEALING THIS. 
---
WE ALL KNOW YOU'VE SEEN THE SCREENSHOTS. 
---
ARE YOU GOING TO ACT OR NOT?
---
The anti asmon witch hunters are 1000x more toxic than they claim he is. You pore over thousands of hours of streams to find one clip to take completely out of context to “prove” you’re not insane. Anyone with half a brain can see through your bs. The only asmongold stuff that gets posted here are hate circle jerks like this. You want less asmongold content? Then shut the fuck up about him. That’s not going to happen though is it? You people are obsessed. It’s starting to get weird.
---
Cap of the scarlet savant... You know what diagnosis usually goes hand in hand with savant?
---
Yesterday I wanted to kill a mob with long spawn rate. Group of two was standing there waiting too. So before trying to steal it from them I wrote "inv" they ignored it, so I wrote "?" then the group leader wrote me "we ain't macro robots who invite people who just write" inv".
---
I pmed him and asked him how else I should of asked. Should I of been more polite?
---
He replied with "forget it retard, go back to retail"
---
First person I have met in a month of classic that got on my ignore list
---
Thanks mate :) she reckons you should try get outside your safe space today too
---
Gotten tons, Bloodfang eu
---
It’s a game about exploration and who deserved the gear. It’s a parallel to life. Asmongold is evil for taking someone’s treasure that could have been the peak experience in their life.
---
WoW means a lot to some of us who are not privileged high rollers with everything handed to them like Asmongold.
---
Face it Asmongold is the epitome of evil and his supporters should feel ashamed of themselves for enabling such toxicity in what is supposed to be a game about union. Then again this is the alliance we are talking about and they seem to be a breeding ground for toxicity.
---
Just today when I was looking to kill Mor'Ladim in Darkshore, a level 60 Warlock and a level 45 mage were sitting their killiing Mor'Ladim over and over before any other players could tag him. Just because. And when someone was yelling at them to cut it out, they were like "LOL I'm not doing anything wrong! LOL I'm so high right now!"
---
I told someone in my guild about it and at first they thought I was talking about Horde players camping him. NOPE! It was people on "our side" doing it.
---
It's really disheartening. The game itself is just how I remembered it back in Vanilla... The community of Classic is really shitty compared to the Vanilla days, honestly. Yes yes, Vanilla did have it's share of asshats but I feel like everywhere I go, I run into shitters.
---
&gt;He doesn't condone ninja looting and he has stated that a few times. 
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/CheerfulBreakableWrenchUncleNox
---
Yet here he is promoting ninja looting.
---
Find some other way to defend him.
---
Thank you so so much!
---
useless post
---
Still free press that drive traffic to him.
---
I wish you both the best of luck!
---
You shouldn’t use such offensive wording and microaggressions
---
Don’t say you people or assume genders man
---
!remindme 1 day
---
Rooftop camping for pvp to prevent getting guards on you is considered exploiting so if you're caught/reported doing it you risk punishment.
---
Haha another zinger, good job brother.
---
What would we talk about if we couldn't blame him for all the Ninja looting that didn't happen when the game first launched? /s
---
It's a bit different situation as it requires the somewhat rare skinning knife + the glove enchant to be able to do it as the skinning requires 315 skinning.
---
I've wondered the same few times, but on wowhead and reddit threads I've seen the similar consensus that skinners should roll for right to skin it, winner gets the pristine hide if it's there. Profession holders own some extra rights while class specific stuff like mages making water, rogues lockpicking seem like something that belong to the group.
---
But fair, I recognized while writing that this would kinda fail the logic test but didn't want to rewrite it.
---
Dungeons are a great way to get gear and xp. They are also a lot of fun!  Don’t let this out you off.  The end stuff here is referring to higher lvl dungeons.
---
Briefly:
---
In most dungeon drops, a roll occurs  on items green quality or higher. The roll is a random number 1-100 generated in game.  You need to choose if you are going to need or greed an item before these roll numbers appear. 
---
A need roll will win over any greed roll so you should only roll need on items you definite need and will equip.
---
A lot of Bind on Equip (boe) green items will drop.  Most people only roll greed on these, even if they are an upgrade.  Often people will ask if it’s okay to need on an item if they have really outdated item and it’s an upgrades 
---
Some BoE blue items are worth a lot on AH.  When battlegrounds come out, some of this gear will be highly desired by people who want to max out a characters stats at a certain level. If a blue boe drops, the group might discuss how to roll. 
---
Bosses/some named mobs drop bind on pickup (bop) items.  Only roll need if these are items you can use, they are appropriate for you class and they are upgrades.  These items cannot be traded once someone loots them. 
---
Most low lvl dungeons people don’t take the time to establish rules.  More is at stake for higher levels.
---
What do you mean? Did I miss something?
---
Lmao from the game or the sub? Like I agree with you in spirit but the way you're going about it is incredibly childish and naive
---
There is though, you right click on their in the chat box.
---
That's ridiculous lol
---
Cant be.
---
Yea predicting the game to fail or have issues with the player base in phase 5. Probably same people who get on at 330AM and ask why sever is dead? Seems like you want to play on private servers .
---
Get the add on Exorsus Raid Tools
---
This has nothing to do with classic wow, it doesn't exist in the game world yet
---
Diaaaamm gina!
---
WHAT?! LINK?!
---
You are giving him right : non exposure on the guy.
---
As a shadow priest main since 07, yessir i thought the same thing at 40 lmao
---
phew, thank the Gods!
---
Maybe it is the most optimal for them.
---
oof. pathetic.
---
No, you're playing the best pure damage DPS in raids. In dungeons you're not even close to the best. Warriors at the bottom there for many reasons.
---
It only does one tick of damage, at the end of its timer. It says so in the description.
---
A lot of people don't want that
---
It's always the alliance, or the horde.
---
that doesn't really make sense, not like the ninja comes here to brag; asmongold himself has probably never posted on this reddit. people post to call a ninja out, hopefully/potentially bringing him to justice.
---
mp5 costs 2.5 itemization points. Intellect costs 1, but returns 15 mana.
---
In a 3 minute fight, 1 mp5 would yield 36 mana. 2.5 Intellect gives you 37.5 more mana (plus a small amount of critical).
---
The macrod emotes is also petty, and shitty.
---
Apparantly he unstucks after an hour or ao. Are you sure people arent just activating it before you? He wont give you any options when you speak to him if he is already doing the spybot sequence.
---
That's what I say but majority of the internet seems to disagree.
---
Try Luna Unit Frames or Pitbull
---
Maul has a threat modifier of 1.75. That's ENORMOUS.
---
Sure, except when I queue with a tank with the same spec as you 20 minutes before and that tank is able to hold aggro and makes the run literally 3x as fast, then maybe its not the mages problem and the tanks. Two way street here. Played with a shitload of tanks who have no idea what they are doing, not a single pull route or refuse to try something new.
---
Tl;dr there is shit AOE players and shit tank players.
---
There are a lot of people who condescendingly use these sort of words.
---
&gt;I don't see any purpose in gearing up my character as none of the raids currently require it.
---
Huh? Only first "tier" of raids is out right now, they are designed to be cleared in pre-raid BiS. Tier 2 will require gear from Tier 1, and so on.
---
No you are completely correct. Someone brought this to my attention and I concede that the actual ninja is not promoting in this sub any ninja behavior it is people trying to bring the ninja to justice that bring the ninja and pro ninja stuff.
---
I concede I am wrong and thank you for having a discussion
---
I thought the "warriors and rogues are best" related to play style too, they have some of the most fleshed out rotations in the game and some interesting mechanics going on vs spam 1 or 2 spells
---
Do you understand what a role model is?
---
No you don't you. You're that guy in the guild that gets mad and leaves when a guild mate wins a roll over you. Yawn
---
1. stop spending money on shit you dont need. This includes spells you arent using.
---
2. Loot everything. You would be surprised what 10x [Tainted Bear Assholes] will sell for at a vendor.
---
3. Keep questing, not everyone gets their mount at 40 and the rewards from quests really picks up after 40
---
You think I worship him from that comment?
---
Are you any better? Insulting strangers on the internet and laughing at people with your superior god complex.
---
You’re no better than him.
---
Grow up.
---
Try using an auction house add on to help with pricing green items. I sold a green dagger with frost damage that venders for 1g or so but got 11 :).   Also doing dungeons can fetch some good gold if you do them fast enough.
---
I've most definitely have never ever had this happen to me nor have I ever logged out as a result of embarrassment of this ever not happening me.
---
That's not true, though. He's trollin' you.
---
The only way to get a level 40 mount is to either get it through a quest chain (Warlock or Pally only) or spend about 100g.
---
Is that adele?
---
It's certainly time consuming but overall when compared to modern MMO dungeon and raid designs I do think vanilla WoW is not difficult. Leveling process takes longer sure but in the end people today can easily figure out how to aggro/manage mobs properly and know how many mobs they can take on with or without cooldowns.
---
My first 60 on the original was a rogue and my second a lock. Both have relatively easy rotations and are easy solo questers too. I preferred rogue as I found it more fun to PVP with as I stealthed around AV ganking clothies ;)
---
I got the emerald (green) while doing a quest in swamp of sorrows. Was excited and used it, but later found out they were going for 300 gold....
---
Happy cake day.
---
He's messing with you
---
Yea I don’t do “dibs”I roll on things I need. Who cares if they’re there for it, so am I... get in line lol
---
Loot literally everything while questing and make sure you got enough room in your bags at all times, you get a lotta more money after 40's
---
Represent! Full time acid plant operator (~60 hours a week) with a wife, and father of 3 as well. Plus my hockey league just started up a few weeks ago. I'm just about 42. Back up to 30g after buying my mount.
---
Its always like this, whatever if its asmongold or someone else, there are people who take it too far for disliking someone. Is it hard to ignore him? No. But these people are sick, they want to delete his existence, like its their only goal in their life.
---
I stopped warching him becouse with time i saw his bad character and etc.... in fact i dont like him as a person, but no reason to witchhunt.
---
Implying a decent group wouldnt just find a competent healer. Healers are not rare lmao, ive made a shitload of groups and its harder to find the 2-3rd mage alot of times compared to a healer. Tanks are the rare class.
---
He wasn’t replying to you
---
That's not what blizzard would consider a scam, clearly. This is someone that rolled need on a need/greed loot roll when everyone else rolled greed. Verbal statements are not scams cause anyone can roll need at any time. Telling someone that if they mail you gold instead of going through the auction house and you'll send them an item and then you don't is scamming. Or insta-swapping an item while trading is scamming. Saying you're gonna greed and then not is just being a jerk but not a scam.
---
Except we are not talking about end game 25 man raids here we are talking about 5 man dungeons.
---
lmao what?
---
My loot frames no longer appear in the middle of my screen and when multiple items drop rolling on one causes the others to disappear until another item drops or I reload my ui.
---
The most basic google search would show you it's an actual issue that people have had with uninstalling xloot.  Who are you to tell me what can and can't happen?
---
Im sorry bud, that just comes with the birden of being a tank. You could try and use „Badboy“ addon and make custom filters

i was at half health doing an escort quest btw.
---
Yeh no idea what hes on about. Healers are a dime a dozen for leveling dungeons and you only need one. Probably the easiest to replace imo.
---
Gratz my man!
---
This axe is an incredible DPS boost; you are gonna be miles ahead of other players at level 30+
---
plaguelands, although eventually you will run out of non-dungeon quests, so get ready to grind
---
Y'all are buthurt as hell, never ever greed on somthing like that
---
Play stupid games win stupid prizes
---
I had the same issue a couple of days ago - I managed to finish it on the lower level ones, but goodness, there were three other people in that tiny zone even at 8am.
---
Rogue. Get to 60, gank every red name you come across with ease. Stealth around and wait for the perfect moment to kill somebody. Camp lowbie zones for the hell of it. Guildie getting camped in STV? Get over there and you can easily choose when to open a fight. You'll love it, especially once BG's are out. Just being able to stealth around and choose your fights is absolutely powerful.
---
It's like when my mom calls me honey. I'm a 32 year old man.
---
I think you have to be a complete idiot to think this is a genuine apology.
---
Totally agree and I'm doing this now.
---
All RPGs are. It's literally impossible for an RPG to be "difficult" without breaking the genre. There is no skill in rolling the dice... and you don't even roll the dice yourself in videogames
---
Yes it is lmao. Stop making up your own definitions.
---
Either you are spending money on things you don't need, you have not been using your professions, you have no used the AH to sell things you don't need or you just do not loot things you kill.
---
Yeah it is funny. The majority of Pug runs I've had were nice. I've only had a mage once who didn't know how his addon worked and then left because he was under the assumption he made no exp. (He said he has two bars left and the addon tells him that it will take another 53 minutes). He left before I could tell him that he needs to reset his XP counter session after going into the dungeon.
---
And a warlock who at GY in ZF just kinda decided "This is useless" then ninjalooted the chest and hearthstoned out. But that was it. These are all the flamers I've had in 1 month of playing and easily 30+ hours of dungeons.
---
Precast heals on your tank and cancel if they aren’t needed.  Get into habit of doing this and less likely you’ll need to shield.  Beginning a cast and then cancelling doesn’t disrupt you mp5 mana regen.  Try to burst heal then rest for that regen, it st all possible. Guard your mana as a precious resource.  If things get dicey, keep yourself and the tank alive, even if it means a dps or two die.
---
Most of those people were random nobodies though. Royson is one of the core members and an officer.
---
I got feared into a rock at BRD entrance and hordes couldn't hit me while i stood there kek
---
Shadow is very strong but they are also very prone to going OOM so you'll have to carefully manage your mana.
---
You must be on a lower pop or pve server
---
Good thing no gnomes are featured in this video, amirite?
---
You probably bought all the abilities for your class and went with a crafting profession ? 
---
I have gone with two gathering professions (mining /skinning after a brief attempt at mining/herbing) and I only take the class abilities I need. This has me at a modest 20g at level 32. 
---
I did set up a bank alt and regularly send stuff to the AH for it to sell for me. I have 16g (from nothing) on that toon. 
---
Don’t despair you can easily farm the gold you need. Crawling dungeons, mob farming or questing. 
---
I learned this the hard way when I play back in vanilla.
---
Ha, no gn-homo!
---
Oh no, a single rogue, your whole instance group is doomed!
---
I play on Pagle, dipshit. Streamers can fuck themselves, and how are *you* so dense? I'm literally saying to do the opposite of what that piece of shit did. Go read a book.
---
That's very naive of you to think people always mean what they say.
---
Hmm. I have tailoring. Have vendored everything so far. Sold nothing on AH. Got 14g at lvl 29 as a warlock.. What have you been buying? :)
---
i got to around level 30 before i got burnt out, started playing other games and told my parents to cancel the sub.. i'm glad to be able to play vanilla again, this time without so many noob problems :D
---
I love that wand!
---
plague lands
---
I mean yeah the guy is a asshole but getting paid to hang out and play video games all day doesn't seem like a loss by any means.
---
At least Ninja wasn’t doing that dumb shit while he was still streaming Classic. He actually gave the game a decent chance but ultimately quit because he made the mistake of being an inexperienced yet popular player who rolled on a PvP realm. He didn’t make it far because he got camped and griefed on and off stream.
---
it is more "difficult" than retail.
---
There's one in BFD that i miss every time.
---
In Ragnarok Online?
---
Shkreli was doing a public service if anything. Did nothing wrong.
---
Yeah, it's called a metaphor. Nobody here is accusing anyone of hunting actual witches, just of making the same mistakes from those stories in a different, less dramatic, context. You can make the argument that this isn't important enough to justify using the term witch hunt, but if that's the case then it isn't important enough to discuss OP's idea of a ban either.
---
good job.
---
1. Don't buy gear while leveling until you have your mount. This is one of the biggest mistakes new players make. The main exceptions to this are early wands for wand-using classes and bags.
---
2. Loot everything. If your bags are chronically full and you find yourself leaving loot behind, get bigger bags. The AH is a good source.
---
3. Get an auction add-on and sell stuff on the AH as you level. Some items are worth money to people trying to level up professions. Some greens, ones that are well-optimized, will sell well. 
---
4. Don't buy every single skill as you level. Consider the skills you actually use frequently. Prioritize upgrading those and let the others fall behind. Also, consider if you use an ability for the damage or the effect. For instance, earth shock is a nice ability for shamans because it interrupts enemy spellcasting. But beyond rank 1, it doesn't give you a "better" interrupt effect, just more damage in addition to the interrupt, so you can just use rank 1 forever.
---
5. Don't bother with crafting professions while leveling. You can make money while leveling with gathering professions (skinning, mining, herbalism) but crafting professions are a pure money sink.
---
Is this on kromkrush?
---
But that epic chest though.
---
Shit weeds

Is this compatible with Healcomm lib?

If this is wrong I don't want to be right

Yeah no

Cash On Delivery
---
Like others have said, LOOT EVERYTHING sell all the grays to vendor and greens at AH. When the auction fails then vendor the greens as well but I would recommend trying to auction them at least once. Stop buying gear from AH at this leveling phase since you should be getting better and better gear anyway from questing up until you get lvl 60. Get gathering professions like skinning, mining or herbalism these will start to add up money aswell while your leveling around the world. Stack of thick leather goes for like 1,2g, anything below thick leather just vendor, since AH is flooded with lower lvl skins and rarely they go for more than vendor price.
---
Obviously all of those are great (for tanking i think would prefer warden staff still over unstoppable force). Hammer of beastial fury is quite hard to get and end of dreams is from naxx, so the next upgrade after blessed hammer.
---
Seeing someone perform a career suicide of this magnitude was almost more impressive than anything he has put out.

Got 60 on my rogue yesterday. Did 4 rend runs and got both swords.

That link you are posting is not evidence. That’s just a case of him talking shit.

Thanks all for replying!!!

The video.

And you are assuming a lot
---
I said ninja looters and those that condone and promote their behavior.
---
The proof is in the links and the subs posting of his officer
---
Good day sir
---
Because there is a diffrent between a melee cleave and a spellcleave group. Melee groups need 4 warriors and a shaman while spellcleave groups uses 1 lock 1 priest and 3 mages.
---
If they would say LFM aoe groep no one knows what kind of group it is and the amound of whispers from unnneeded people is way bigger. Its the upfront clearity most people find usefull.

Did you just say wife?

He’s garbage in and garbage out. Just garbage through and through.

What the fuck?

I wish I could sit and play WoW all day, now I have a job that keeps me occupied most of the time and a house that needs attention. Oh what I’d do to be 13 and have all the free time in the world again.
---
Seems like very incomplete. Hope the development continues.
---
I think OP meant that he has a wife, is a FT nurse, and a father. 
---
Or maybe it's an asexually reproducing entity who, after impregnating itself, birthed 3 offspring and became the first alien lifeform to become an RN here on Earth.

I’m asmon and just trying to get you to view my shit bro

Also I might be kD
---
He insults people who are bad at the game and then the people that got insulted cry about it in here. Its also his stream persona, hes actually a really nice person outside the streams. He takes care of his sick mom and talks about his opinions on his more irl channel
---
why were the epaulets red in the loot window?
---
i meant him ninja looting. it's ok to ninja loot?
---
Im trying to do the same but it’s my first time playing wow so I might have picked some build for rather experienced players (other races are much more straight forward). You mind sharing your skill tree? :D
---
No. We are not. We are all calling for blizzard to ban him. He broke the rules about as brazenly as one can.
---
Thing with Mara is: the mobs start out in the first wings with levels in the range of 46-48 but later they are 49-50
---
Mob skip metas annoy the fuck out of me and they make me wish developers would patch out such exploits.
---
I remember playing RIFT a couple of years ago and entering a dungeon called Storm Breaker Protocol. After the first boss there are a few trash packs which could very easily wipe a group. They were all CC immune, did massive damage and were clustered in packs of 5 - 6 mobs. I wiped many times on that dungeon until I learned that everybody just skipped those packs by running along the seams of the zone’s cliffs to avoid the trash packs in a clearly unintended manner.
---
Warlords of Draenor had another annoying mob skip in one of its dungeons where you had to jump along a seam in  a very specific manner whilst mounted to scale a cliff and effectively skip most of the trash before the first boss.
---
Hard to empathize with some random retard who gets anxiety over being asked a simple question in a game
---
Even harder for me to care when unsolicited advice comes from another random retard like yourself lmao, but thanks for playing white knight for no reason :)
---
doesnt even make sense
---
unlike w_v who is obviously right. You can't report someone because you listened to them and didn't roll on an item lmao
---
This sub needs to grow up. It’s just a video game, why are you all taking it so seriously?
---
That was literally how it was done back in vanilla you dimwitted dolt.
---
**Patch 2.0.1** (05-Dec-2006): Threat generation changed (see above).
---
Before Patch 2.0.1, Battle Shout generated 55 threat for every party member who received the buff. This made it better than Demoralizing Shout for gathering groups of mobs for AoE. It was also used frequently in Phase 1 of the Nefarian fight in BWL.
---
Yes. Report him to Twitch.
---
I hated when I had to give up having full Defias Blackened set. Though it lasted like 13 levels. Still use the chest piece.
---
Why not?
---
It's pretty funny reading the outraged reddit comments
---
Ofc. It’s the Vanilla experience. Personally, I love it. So I’m not saying a DPS Warrior shouldn’t/ couldn’t roll on leather/mail. BiS is BiS, but that doesn’t change the fact that a Warrior can potentially loot Plate, Mail, Leather and a Cloth... while a rogue/Druid or a Shaman/Hunter are limited to Leather/Mail and below, respectively.
---
Admission of guilt. Video evidence vocal evidence. In a court of law this holds lol.
---
Yeah ok. Like I said anyone with a half a brain sees through your bs. I bet you got kicked out of his guild for being a toxic pos and are now mad because you subbed to him for 10 years with your mom’s credit card and feel like he owes you something. Go outside.
---
What a piece of garbage
---
&gt;making asmongold look bad
---
Lol, implying that they ever looked good.
---
Morally no, game mechanic wise it wasn't addressed in original wow I doubt it will be now.
---
Thank you so much for this!
---
Healers definitely aren’t rare in classic. Tanks are rare. It isn’t the group’s job to watch your mana. The tank sets the pace, and everyone else follows suit. If you’re oom, say something; otherwise, you’re the asshole. I say this as a holy spec priest, too.
---
i've never encountered this as a healer. from reading OP's comments i think the problem is he joined a cleave group expecting he could replace a warrior as a prot pally. if that's the case then it's his fault. avoid cleave groups if you want to run at a normal pace and not the "perfectly optimal method".
---
Both have their difficulties.
---
Classic is much harder leveling and the devs put more time into that, 5 mans can be harder too (although now with a large % of players knowing the content and knowing how to play better it's minimized).
---
Retail the difficulty kicks in if you are in a progressive raid guild, but if you are doing that then the time commitments become comparable to classic top raiding time commitments really. The last couple of xpacs i've only gotten a couple of characters to max level and done lfr to see the content and pugged some first tier stuff, it was faceroll easy but i still know if i wanted to do higher tier stuff i'd have a time consuming challenge.
---
You seem to know way more about warrior tanking than I do just from reading this thread. Could you recommend a talent tree or guide for a warrior that wants to tank dungeons and MC/Ony? I’m only 48 atm so just about to start working on my pre-raid tanking set.
---
You cant realistically expect someone running an AH scan sniping tool to give you an item back.
---
[Link to the addon.](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/character-notes)
---
You can roll Need on basically anything you want, champ.
---
Ettiquet, which is the point of my post, dictates you only roll Need on legitimate upgrades for your character and Greed everything you'd like to sell for a profit.
---
That's why there are two different rolls. Otherwise it'd be Need and Pass if you 'need the gold'.
---
Absolutely stellar reading comprehension, ninja.
---
I mean if you have a tank with a macro explaining how ideal tanking worked, logic dictates that it would be a tank that understands how it works, being at least moderately proficient in it.
---
Like I’d venture to say some idiot who has no idea what he’s doing Ian going to take the time to explain what and how threat works in chat if he has no idea how it works.
---
And maybe somewhere along the way one of those shit tanks learns something.
---
It's about R Kelly living under a rock for 30 years.
---
Duskwood is the GOAT.
---
Let me know what your name and server is so we can avoid ninja shits like you.
---
Both get saved to the server (and both have a local cache), I've tested. I think the confusion is because edits to the local cache cause updates to the server.
---
As I stated before, they are not suboptimal. Just check out Skarm. He literally can tell you why Druids are better tanks for some of the bosses and equal on many bosses. Of course there are bosses where druids are ineffective, but there are also bosses were warriors are inefficient.
---
There is a reason why feral druids (cat and bear) are standard in many of the pro raids on private servers. It has already been crunched by them. 
---
For example, Feral Druid is the most efficient tank to use against Patchwork.
---
It depends, I think that a lot of nice people have found their crowd/guild and just speak to each other in there.
---
One of the reasons (not the only one though) PUGs tend to be terrible is because people who are not nice don't find guilds with nice people. So those types of people tend to be able to make groups with people they had good experiences with before.
---
Forgot about the ninja looters
---
I had 75 gold at 40, after spending 20 something on tailoring for my shadoweave set. All gold i got was questing, vendoring and skinning (which i vendored all the skins)
---
Unless there was more on that post then this isn't ban worthy. That post deals with abuse of master loot.
---
No it doesn’t. It’s not evidence of a “crime”.
---
Also, it was a joke. A pretty obvious one and it tells a lot about you for not getting it.
---
I dont have this item and I have original CE. I have all the pets in my pet collection in retail aswell.
---
Well said.
---
That bag space 🤤
---
That moment when you're facing bleeding immune mobs...
---
And I'm furry specc'd I don't even use rend outside of the first charge. D:
---
But you are young, that's a difference
---
Thats pretty neat!
---
Been wondering why greens are suddenly multiple gold when they are the only entry in AH. Drops to 50 silver when 3 other entries come in, heh.
---
Get a gathering profession (Mining, Skinning, Herbalism). Then gather everything and then sell it. Either to vendor or on the AH. Make sure you don't sell it on the AH for less than you can get from a vendor, though. (i.e., unless my memory and math are wrong, if the vendor price is 1s, you should list it on the AH for no less than 1s 05c because of the AH cut. And don't forget the AH deposits that can and will eat into your gold each time you relist something.)
---
Never buy anything on the AH unless you \*NEED\* it or can make money with it. Never. (Well, almost never. I think I bought a weapon or two for like 15s back around level 18.)
---
I'm most familiar with making money on Skinning/Leatherworking. If you're a skinner, go skin mobs that drop Thick Leather. Then, sell it to Leatherworkers for at least 1.25g per stack. It's a lot of leather and it's a lot of skinning, but you'll make money.
---
If you have leatherworking, you can both skin Thick Leather yourself and buy stacks from others. Craft Nightscape Tunics by the hundreds and vendor 'em.
---
Source: Level 32 and 100+ gold.
---
gzzzzz pals
---
Very hard to find a lvl buddy in WoW.
---
You'd have to dedicate a character to only be played when both schedules align pretty much. 
---
I'm leveling a shaman with my brother only and a rogue if alone. Both are now around 35.  So not the most efficient way to level but more fun for sure.
---
"all greed" yeah no. all need.
---
I would just turn off emotes to protect my sister it's upsetting her
---
Hehe yeah but when you do get the chance to play it is really fun!
---
How would this work if he sold the gloves already? Does that person get their gold back and the item disappears?
---
As others pointed out each level needs more xp, around late 30s early 40s it may be a good idea to get in the habit of grinding now and then as well. If you find a nice spot with lots of close together easy to kill mobs spend an hour or two with the tv or youtube on just grinding them so that you will still have quests available for when you feel like doing those.
---
the screenshot literally showed the entire offense in detail as it unfolded, as well as the evidence that he posted it on AH. Look at it, just look.
---
They won't kill the same player? They will just have the player(s) they choose for "pvp" kill different players of the colab guild(including alts) while the one on the other faction does the opposite.
---
This is why you don't fucking greed a boe. All need prevents ninja looters.
---
This guy's a total piece of shit. People who "all greed" are idiots.  Half of ninja looting wouldn't happen if people thought this shit through instead of acting like "need is a button you press when you need it" like it even fucking matters.

Yeah nah mate.
---
Yea sorry man I was kidding
---
zug zug
---
He can get banned since he stated loot rules in chat before ninja looting
---
&gt;lives with his mom  
---
I don't think its fair to take a jab on the fact that he lives with his mother. She's sick and he's been taking care of her for a while, but I guess that doesn't matter since that goes against the insane hate circlejerk against asmongold.   
---
I swear to god people make it out to seem like asmon has committed genocide.
---
I mean sounds like sixnine talking about his music videos and rap stuff was a joke.
---
It’s admission of guilt. It’s literally admission to what I am asking a petition to ban for.
---
Ninja looting and condoning and promoting it.
---
Studying law. You should work on reading comprehension fam. Stop subscribing to asmold and buy some books fam
---
Good point. And at least I’m not scamming people for virtual currency.
---
What neck? His head looks like a shanty on a single stilt
---
Oh for sure you can see I have several keys that aren't bound. Only so many within reach
---
I love how you apparently know how I am. You must be some kind of prophet. I'm actually happy if other people get their items, because unlike you I don't ninja them for gold.
---
Like you guys try so hard to insult me because I don't accept your shitty ninja looting. It's really pathetic. Just let it go already ok? Continue with your ninja looting and be happy I guess.
---
I’m a penny-pincher, I’m also level 39 and I’m at 64 gold. It’s my first time playing and I unknowingly got lucky since I’ve been told paladins get a free mount. 
---
I haven’t run any dungeons though which makes me sad, the solo grind is lonely.
---
when either you or your target are moving, the melee range increases by a few yards.
---
Warlocks and mages who aoe 2 mages should die
---
Yeah I'm 43 hunter just finished up stv kinda tempted
---
Gayyy
---
ORRRR Blizzard can use pictures and video evidence to temp ban and delete the character
---
Your link is shit. The blue post is specifically referencing Master Looting and changing from rolling to Master Loot. Rolling need when everyone always has the option to roll need or greed is not a ninja loot. It's just being an asshole and that's not specifically against the EULA or CoC. Again Blizzard should dp nothing and players should just do like in the old days and need roll everything when playing with randos.
---
It was 300 when I got my drop and I'm still hoping to cash in 500 at least.
---
He deleted his ninja looting haha
---
Ah yep. I’m Horde though so don’t have access to that quest
---
This is genius!! Love it.
---
At 36 and then 40 it gets much, much easier with arms at least. Mortal strike, whirlwind. At 45 I sit at 20% crit chance, it goes so faster now, don't give up :)
---
But I do quests 2-3 levels below me, just to be safe. Works great.
---

---
In theory, the problem is not just the streamers but their hundreds of thousands of toxic(?) followers.     Like, all the people who watch this ninja looter and think that it's funny or whatever, are they gonna be good people to pug with?
---
It sounds like it's not so noticeable overall from what people on the server are saying, so that's good.
---
I always considered City raids the most difficult.
---
Come to Kromcrush, the server is almost 50/50 Alli to Horde, it's very populated and it's a east coast server.
---
Wait what the fuck
---
I already got my epic mount and my eye of shadow
---
&gt;If one faction has some people start being shitheads the other side tends to fight back and escalate...
---
That's usually when I get whispers like "Why didn't you help me??? WTF???" from the alliance players that started shit after I ran past their last stand, casually waving at hordies.
---
50-50 chance that I'll get through without any issues and won't have my questing adventures delayed. ;)
---
McConnell is a giant cry baby whenever he doesn't get things to go his way lol
---
Yup, just had this happen to me today. To top it off, they /spit on me lol...
---
Spirit is not trash at all, and actually one of the stronger stats, behind SP and stamina.
---
I'm level 46, there's 118 60's on my server. You're doing fine.
---
It's easy to get stuck in the circle jerk of streamers and people showing off hitting 60, the reality is they make up 1% of the player base.
---

---
This is my take on what an all around mage specc looks like. And no, I wouldnt go with Fire or Arcane as the main talent tree.
---
There are 2 talent points in my specc (from Ice Shards) that can be moved around. You could move those 2 talent point to Imp. Nova, Imp. Counterspell, Imp. Arcane Explosion, or even Arcane Focus.
---
This is not a raid specc, PvP specc, or AoE grind specc. It's a little-bittle-into-the-middle specc.  
---
Edit: typo
---
Nigtfin sells for 3g mac a stack atm, so its a waste of time. Currently there is no use for cooking not untill ah stabilizes
---
Or course he is. What's gonna happen to him? Some redditors will bitch about him for a week and all this will be forgotten.
---
Honestly, even if it were somehow possible to solo it, probably not worth the time it would take, very low chance to get the specific roll you need on the gloves, probably time better spent farming lbrs for the hands of power
---
Never gonna happen. He still brings new players in to game. They have mentioned many time that officers have right to Ninja roll since they put more effort organising etc...
---
Is this serious? I watched maybe 10 minutes of Asmon at total, but he seemed at least halfway reasonable.
---
While MOBA games skyrocketed esports scene they also brought in this shitty behavior I believe
---
I highly recommend this spot if you can get it free, unlikely at peak hours though. If you can play off peak hours it’s worth for sure.
---
I repory them for cheating since rmt is against the rules
---
Well you must be dying a shitload then and always be flying to your corpse... How are you going to spend that much Money by now otherwise :d
---
Noo srsly it is hard to have it by 40. Definitely possible quite easily. But hard especially the first time around.
---
Just Keep going by 43-44 you will have it!
---
Was the RL a gnome mage lol
---
He is as big a loser as Asmongold. I can't stand these guys.
---
I feel pity to the mount for having to carry that much shit around.
---
Goddammit Karen, stop complaining.
---
As a healer tho, I feel we have the most power. Enjoy that repair bill if they do stupid things
---
For pre-raid bis I’ve seen people say Inventor’s Focal Sword is better than Witchblade, how is that? I would think the 14sp + stats would be better than just 1% spell crit or is spell crit really just that good?
---
Do you have a piece of gear equipped that also gives 18 spell damage? If you do, does unequipping and re-equipping that piece not fix it?
---
I almost got kicked for the same reason as a hunter, however i was able to slow enough (trap) and do enough/more dmg than the mages with volley+multi shot in SM cath
---
makes me wish they had put in the customization dance studio thing  WotLK
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
That was fucking hilarious, how big was the ally raid group?
---
so?
---
More like “their turning the Troggs gay!”
---
You will stop that preety quico once hk and dk are back in game
---
I was in a group yesterday with 2 mages that wanted to leave after the first wipe--a wipe which they caused by not vasting front nova.  Then they actually left after the next pull in which I was asked to round up the first pull (in ZF) and they AGAIN didn't cast frost nova until one of the other party members was dead.  They literally complained about not having the nova order worked out for them.
---
How are we not addressing the monkey pet staring at us.
---
Tho i prefer classic, i 100% agree. Classic is just time consuming af. Puting 300 mobs inside a room isnt harder, its just stupid sometimes. Only makes you again lose a bunch of time looking for group to clear that room, specially as an ally in a horde full server...
---
I ran LBRS Strat live and undead three full clears with a 4 man grp last night! Did it with a priest healer and 2 mages! Didnt loose aggro once and was praised by the healer! Really felt great!!! My actually geared and confident to try and grp up for UBRS! Started onyxia attune and gota kill rend now! Very happy tank warrior here!
---
So you are using a cracked copy of windows?
---
Yeah, okay. I've misunderstood the "clicker term". It means someone clicking their main abilities, okay.
---
I have numbers up to 6 as default, but 7, 8, 9, 0, -, = binded to z, x, c, v, q, e respectively. Rebinded strafing to a and d, and no keyboard turning. But I use W and S like default.
---
&gt; undead Rogue 
---
&gt; where can I go?
---
to hell. :)
---
This was obviously very rude, but 3 warriors none of which will tank would drive me crazy. 
---
Arms is a very good dungeon tank, and it’s much more fun than dpsing because you get a ton of rage.
---
Yeeeah just got him near booty bay, only eats fruit
---
Oh boy let me tell you about hunters and the hate on them.
---
I'd just start making the grps, when people start shit just boot'em and put them on ignore posthaste, sooner or later people will either lighten up or forget about this dumb dungeon bullshit
---
Not to mention he pays for the house lol
---
I really like doing dungeons, but the conventional way. I'm not a fan of aoeing everything down for hours. I'm sure I'll do SM a few times, and if it is with groups that really have to be careful and pull back every single mob group, I'm happy.
---
Would be fun if they just transfer his char to another realm, and then mute him for eternity. And ofc compensate the others in that party.
---
What a waste of gametime.

^ Response from Asmons best friend, Mconnell. So looks like if Royson ends up dodging the supposed blizzard ban then Royson will most likely not get any form of punishment from asmons guild.
---
Whether I disagree or agree with this does not matter, just stating facts.
---
Makes me laugh, people are so pissed at what he did yet he’s gaining subs ect... 
---
Seems his tactic worked. Shame there’s so many delusional people that play this game.
---
It's unrelated, he's just surprised that a priest made it to the top of the damage charts. Not related to the roll.
---
Fuck him and fuck Olympus
---
Why lie? Nobody wondered that. I haven't seen a single person confused about why people would want to avoid streamer servers. In fact I've actually seen clips of a few big streamers acknowledging that many people wouldn't want to be on the same realm.
---
Wait, how are you hearing you're failures?  How old are the oldest zoomers?  19?
---
Spirits be with you, mon.
---
This is completely true. I found out tonight &gt;.&lt;
---
Yep that's pretty much it, Priority gets the keybinds, the stuff you use most often
---
You can't help it... We all know you will inevitably roll need all hunter gear (that is, the entire wow item database), your pet will pull adds in dungeons, you will multishot cc mobs.
---
Is that right? that FullProt is actually bad rn?
---
Not everyone wants to be a streamer. I'd rather floss my balls with razor wire
---
That’s true. I learned tonight that you have to shift click.
---
Thanks, I thought so too. I didnt get a chance to count, but it seemed like 20-30 of them.
---
Once it’s loyalty reaches level 6, and it’s the same level as the pet you had since level 10, it will have the same amount of training points
---
The Onyxia in the end xD
---
Nah I just haven't activated it yet 😁
---
Ah yes all those very fine fascists.
---
It was on master loot
---
Ah, I get it, you have to rely on green drops only (Which are rare) to get your gear?
---
YOU are absolutely ignorant AND stupid.
---
Try to level a non-cloth spellcaster/healer while only using random drops and quest rewards, enjoy wearing level 15-20 gear with level 40~45
---
Never heard of the guy.  Played wow and all I hear about.  Watched him for 2 minutes and could tell what he was about.  How are people really this blind?  How do you tell people in real life if you can even see it so obvious in a video of some guy on the internet?
---
As a general rule you do not want crusader on anything faster than 2.0 speed as a tank. Lifestealing, 15 agi, or just +5 dmg for fast weapons and crusader for 2.0 and above. This is because crusader has terrible proc rate for fast weapons. Whereas lifestealing has the same proc % regardless of speed, so the faster the better and will yield more threat generation than crusader for fast weapons.
---
Mind sending another link? Both are expired
---
My first 60 was a rogue. I would go for warlock. Warlocks can solo much better than rogues, due to having a pet, and they're more likely to get groups because they don't compete with the tank for any drops. You can also farm easier by sending your pet on any nearby mobs or fearing them off while you collect a node; the rogue has to kill nearby mobs.
---
It's mostly just elvUI that makes it look like this. You can edit everything to what you're comfortable with.
---
Hey look, there’s me up there @ Selmada 😋
---
But blizzard could suspend or ban him.
---
Yeah, my middle mouse click is self-select, though. And I instead have the 4 other party members on F1, F2, F3, F4. F5 is jumping, which sounds weird, but I have F5 bound to my mouse, mostly used for refreshing Web pages, but also used for a secondary jump button in WoW.
---
Ireland here and I find it very condescending to be called buddy. I guess it's what you're brought up with. Where I am from we call everyone 'mate', which in meaning is essentially the same, except it's accepted.
---
Ignore everyones advice on how you shouldve made 1k gold at 30, at 40-45 you get lots of gold through quests (ZulFarrak quests hello!) to buy your mount at 45 instead of 40.
---
I see people trying to make huge profits at 30-40 while the real moneygain is with grind u can do at 60.
---
Or just watch all the YouTube highlight reels like wind fury procs and one macro warriors lol. Make it seem like an often occurrence but it’s farm from it
---
I mean you can raid rather successfully only clicking skills. We had a pally back in the days who literally played clicking _all_ the skills. Right in his Spellbook.
---
How much are people spending on Lionheart on your realm? It's more than an epic mount on mine.
---
This guy looks just as retarded as I thought he would
---
So if everyone hits Greed, what happens? If two people hit Need, is it a 50/50 chance between them?
---
Thx for reply, never played wow yet
---
That UI is just i dont even know
---
Racist.
---
Damn, this changes everything! I've been sunder tapping like crazy. So should i pull mobs closer so my entire group is in range of the shout? Do all 5 need to be in range for this be effective, what if its only 3 of the group do i just spam more?
---
I used guidelime addon with Sage’s alliance guide (it’s built in). Also on twitch for free.
---
What did you do with your cash lol 
---
I never farmed anything specifically and only used ah to level cooking but I’m at almost 30 gold on level 35
---
You should have skinning and sth else skilled preferably herbalism or sth 
---
Also first aid 
---
Theses are all free money things
---
I believe you, people can train themselves to do anything almost.
---
That's totally fine, yea. Lets say the item is worth 200 gold. If 200 gold dropped would you pass on it just because I really wanted it to buy the Warden Staff off the AH? Of course not. 
---
That's the logic behind Everyone Needs BoEs. In economic terms the only difference between an item and the gold it's worth are the transaction costs.
---
It's what online gaming was 15 to 20 years ago.
---
Yeah on Warriors It's pretty important. Every one of us knows that it happens at least once a day to survive with 1 to 500 hp.
---
Top teir quality.
---
Www.sixtyupgrades.com
---
I just farm exalted with Darnassus and get a tiger instead.
---
What if your a sub rogue with ambush Crits Kappa ;) ?
---
Does droprate take into account the number of items dropped? AKA is it % of kills that dropped this item or % of drops that were this item
---
No. I'm saying that for a random player race is not remotely an indicator of skill.
---
But you clearly have your head stuck so far up your ass that you can't actually read.
---
5 Warlock in a guild is a problem. I'm supriced that they let you all join a raid. I would try to find a New guild as long as they are not IRL friends. I'm right now doing half guild and PUG runs where I only need to compete with one other Warlock.
---
The fuck
---
are you serious? the only way that makes sense is if someone gives him the gold to buy it. buying it from the auction house is not winning an item, lol.
---
and not being a arrogant prick boasting about it.
---
There is levels to these sort of things.
---
prob not, you can download windows 10 from microsoft free and use this version with the water mark. doesnt wven have annoying pops telling you to activate, but water mark always there.
---
Jesus christ dude perhaps you should seek help.
---
Hard disagree on that one. If you ban him, how can you continue to call out his behaviour?
---
Since there is only one difficulty per raid, I've always considered :
---
MC is LFR
---
BWL is NM
---
AQ is HM
---
Naxx is MM
---
But sure, PvP is the main content of Vanilla and it's worth gearing for. It feels a little like a Moba, with a lot of counterplay, builds throught talents and gear, etc.
---
But seriously, Kevin Bacon has some great movies.
---
'Cause it's Kalimdor you get the mount for.
---
in the game valueble loot drops, all players in the encounter can chose to roll a dice, the highest roll wins.  It has 2 variants.  If you don;t need it, you roll Greed, if you need it you roll Need.    This can be abused , if all  roll Greed, one guy can roll need and automatically win the item, even if he doesn't really need it and only wants it for gold.  For this reason it is safer when all players roll Need in these situations
---
Tell that to all the rogues, mages, warriors, shamans and lock bodies I leave in my wake. (Fair fights too, my level range) 
---
Only class I admit is struggle with are priests
---
Not skipping leg day I see
---
Won’t have to. Ban him and he gets removed from the sub. It won’t affect him at all or directly but it will clean up the sub and show we don’t promote ninja looter or ninja content
---
&gt; Arthur?
---
He just had to have some faith..
---
it's not gold to the person that needs the item. how dense are you? basically you're saying every single drop should be needed on as they are all worth money.
---
Google "wow professions classic". The first 2 websites will tell you which recipes to learn and level your profession.
---
However, an option would be at 39 ignore your profession and get to farming SM for silk/boe drops.
---
the only way classic can seem more difficult is for classes with shit leveling, and even then the difficulty is largely derived from how long it takes to do anything.
---
even dying from pulling too many mobs doesn't make the game difficult. it's just that your characters stats and rng rolls for cc resists and being dazed weren't sufficient for the stats of the enemies.
---
don't kid yourself.
---
I can't fathom why people watch this crap.
---
Must be a geared 60. Any alliance I see near SM just gets flattened.
---
Also, in Starcraft, clicking fast and accurately is what you do. And that's a faster pace game.
---
I mind controlled someone on the boat to booty bay and made him jump off right before the loading screen. Got disconnected when the loading screen should hit. Logged back in and I was under stonetalon mountains. Couldn’t move. Had to hearth. 
---
I called it karma.
---
He should get temporary bann or somthing
---
^ Mconnell apparently doesn’t care, aka his best friend.
---
Seems like you just rushed in too fast xD My highest Char is lvl 26 right now.
---
I got kicked from a group for needing that dagger, lol. I won it. It was a 10 dps increase. I'm not passing that up for some rando.
---
Yeah he is a fucking pig, from classic launch day there was a taco cabana cup and Dr Pepper can sitting in the exact same spot for about 2 weeks. Dude looks like he stinks too
---
If you didn't hit Need, it's because you didn't know
---
WHAT THE FUCK TO DO
---
Ur UI is 50% of the screen bro, lots of stuff doesnt even have a cooldown and is shown
---
Bubble puts you out of combat
---
on the other hand as a feral tank I really enjoy aoe groups. even if mages and locks pull with blizzard/rof, I can still tank the group. no cc, just speed. mmmm
---
Doing dungeons at low levels I'm gonna shame every "I'm dps" warrior who sits in a 4/5 party for ages and refuses to tank
---
This
---
Dots. More dots. 
---
Stop dots.
---
I am surprised blizzard is taking this long to address this. Yeah before people say it’s a streamer or w/e. Blizzard does take time to investigate sometimes and we’ve seen streamers get banned for some of the worst/pathetic reasons. So I really don’t think being a streamer/personality has something to do with it. I do think however screenshots like the one from the first post should have been submitted if they haven’t already as that was definite proof of the ninja.
---
In wotlk rolled against a guildie for gloves in naxx. First roll both 100 , second roll both 98 third roll 24, lost the glovee on 4th roll
---
He's probably a Horde player, so he's saying that normally he would root against the Alliance. It's some faction banter and a compliment.
---
Im currently a level 50 prot paladin.
---
Questing is gruellingly slow, and the only zone that's really open now is un'goro, which is slightly above my level and swamped with level 60 players looking for easy kills and devilsaurs.
---
Noone wants to run maraudon, what do I do?
---
I haven’t had that many issues in Classic, but then again I’m not at high level content yet. However for the moment at least I’m happy to have a refuge from the cesspit that is WoW retail.
---
Well that ain't going to work.
---
they're pretty decent, I've never had a problem with a bear on my hunter. Best part is they have a wide variety in diet, so you can pretty much feed them off whatever you find.
---
The idea is that some people actually need it. But in this case it's so expensive that it gets tricky.
---
Probably their little sister.
---
no. you run dungeons to get the items you need to get stronger. you farm for gold.
---
The difficulty is a real problem in my opinion.
---
Raiding is in fact on LFR level for the most parts. But it's not just due to the fact people got better it's because of the fact we are using 1.12 patch with alle the nerfs and fixes in dungeons as well as the buffs of all classes spellpower, weapon normalized etc.. especially UBRS has become super easy as an example. Rend is a complete joke.
---
Therefore BWL will be a bit harder then MC right now but still not an comparison to the original Version when it comes to the challenge. Aq40 will be the first real raiding experience and Naxx will be the real vanilla like raid since 1.11 was the scourge invasion patch and everything is tuned in this patch.
---
From a raiding perspective it's really sad to play I agree. We definitely need an HP and damage buffs on most Bosses to make it more vanilla like and less LFR like.
---
Shows game version 8.2... Does that work in classic?
---
One of what people? This dude is the definition of a nobody.
---
Whatever heathen
---
Same here, I’m going for cat dps pre raid bis and see how it works out. But I’m pretty sure that I will have to respecc at some point (don’t see myself grinding gnome everyday for the pummeler). Luckily you can use lots of items for tanking as well
---
Hitting either Need or Greed is essentially rolling a 100-sided dice. Highest number wins. If everyone Greeds, it just goes to the highest roller.  You can emulate this by typing /roll. (Doing this is also common if the party encounters a chest during a dungeon to see who gets the contents). 
---
If someone Needs while everyone else Greeds, it overrides everyone else's roll since Need takes priority over Greed, regardless of what number the Greeds rolls. If TWO people Need, it goes to the higher roller between the two and everyone else's roll is ignored. Again, this is done automatically (in most cases; memory is faulty on Raids).
---
You could during Vanilla WoW - indeed, there were addons that would dynamically adjust raid groups to optimize Prayer of Healing (when it detected a Prayer of Healing cast, it would swap 4 damage players into the group, then swap them back after it landed).
---
The whole notion of 'taint' - and the UI mod changes that created it - broke this functionality.
---
I'm not entirely sure you can't re-arrange the raid mid-fight. However, what I am sure of is that it'll probably wipe your raid because it will break the unit frames of pretty much every healer in the raid if you do.
---
join group as a dps and you don't heal.
---
I'd need it and say shit forgot.
---
If this had happened to me I’d be glad they ignored me. Don’t want that kind of negativity near my fun wow time!
---
We will take that as a compliment!❤️❤️❤️

Yeah I had someone to tell me to go to a PvE server because he kept getting killed over and over again by this Warlock while me and 4 other horde peacefully quested alongside the allys. Dude, all the rest of us are having no issues with them, you must have done something. Me being on a PvP server doesn't mean I need to protect you from the shit you brought upon yourself.
---
I agree with the mentality that it's just time consuming, I say as a level 59. 
---
Yes, because a quest that has me kill 40 of the same damn animal is soooooo hard.
---
Thanks, makes sense to me.
---
Eh more like 35% but yep, works great. You see everything
---
Chromie is best girl.
---
Why did my head read this in Pathfinder voice? (To Arnerus)
---
As a healer I really, really enjoy grouping with tanks whom I have not played with before and whenever my mana is reaching the level when I'm thinking "Yea, now that guy could start pulling.." he actually does that. Or tanks who assess mana while drinking and do a pull they can handle long enough for me to finish my drink or at least get decent enough mana level. That's just awesome wordless communication, and usually makes for a fun and smooth run followed by +Friend request on both sides. 
---
Lately I've noticed that this really is a fine balance between the tanks who will wait for full mana or a "gogo" every time and the tanks who seem to be lacking party unit frames (or ones with mana bars, at least) who just rush on ahead. Reaching BRD and higher seems to be thinning the ranks and weeding out the odd cases, though. Many DPS still seem to pick their own targets / AoE everything at will, however - not all by any means, but there's usually one or two every per run who seem to think they can nuke a target fast enough and that healers have unlimited mana.
---
Wait for Nax.
---
I used to start groups for dungeons since no one would invite rogues, and I got really good at recruiting for them. Every time I ran a dungeon with someone that stood out I'd compliment and friend list. Next time I'd ask "hey thx for bla bla bla, doing X now, wanna come?" 
---
Also when you started groups yourself you could steer away from the huntards and other rogues so you'd get your gear.
---
Oh yeah right, my bad.
---
I'm not sure the human hit cap is 6%, I accidentally went into MC with 7% hit, supposedly 1% more than I needed, and I still missed a few times. Maybe there's a flat 1% miss chance that's impossible to avoid, I dunno.
---
Also to that Vanilla wiki link, Vanilla wiki is hot garbage, don't take anything from there as truth unless you already know it to be the truth. The site has been abandoned for years and contains data that's blindly copy pasted and sometimes isn't even for Vanilla.
---
So streamers, children with no responsibility’s and then jobless for whatever reason are really special? Sadly they are the only ones likely to achieve rank 14.
---
I agree the system in BFA is the worst implementation of gear acquisition however bfa has arena which makes up for that. The arena system of TBC and wotlk however are far superior to that we have now or what was in vanilla.
---
At this point you have to be joking, coz that scruffy git can't even maintain personal hygiene. So he does this when he is on wow 15 hours a day? And you believe this?
---
The only bit that's believeable part is paying for the house. Just because he claims to do the rest doesn't mean its true, streamers will say anything to come across as decent and I don't believe that at all. His /played is the proof, you can't play games like that and care for someone that is ill. I've been there with my own dad.
---
But I digress, people can believe what they want it makes no difference. The dude needs to take more care of himself or he will have a heart attack before he's 40 and I wouldn't wish that on nobody as that is what happened to my dad.
---
I don’t assume anything. I just play the game. I vendor my lock boxes. I don’t ask for water or healthstones I just say thanks if they’re given.
---
If someone needs a tank and I feel like tanking, I just tank.
---
But I don’t party with people that charge for basic services. It rubs me the wrong way. You do you, and I’ll do me.
---
&gt; Wasn't updated for classic, but bfa version works just fine.
---
Yes, it does.
---
They’re just pets that follow you around. Most people get it just for the novelty or aesthetic. I don’t believe they do anything else besides follow you around and maybe have a few unique visual animations.
---
The narcissism is palpable.
---
Vanity items serve no purpose but run beside you
---
Was my experience as well in the first week or two of classic when I hit 40. Vendored all my greens, apart from ones I knew would sell at auction. Skinned every mob possible. Made a few bags that I sold/offered to make bags and got a few tips. Never bought a single thing. Only bought the bare essential talents. Still only ended up with ~35g at 40. Luckily I'm a Warlock and got a free mount anyway, but if I'd rolled a different class I'd have been mountless for a good long time. Not sure how people do it.
---
I also suffer from a major case of altitis.
---
I was doing pretty well levelling my warrior and got to 50 in a few weeks, then decided to roll a farming alt.
---
I fancied trying Pally AOE farming just for the meme so rushed levelled a pally to 20, bought a Green Tower in anticipation then stopped playing him and rolled a lock....then a hunter...
---
I lost a weeks play time on my warrior, I could be 60 right now.
---
What add on do you use for the damage details?
---
Today I farmed 1000 hoggers, why? BecauseIwanttoandnowImtaliingreallyfast.
---
F
---
Yeah but his class does the best dps in raids. Which has nothing to do with dungeons because dps warriors don't do much for people there. Melee and no cc.
---
Tanks are in high demand, I’m surprised you haven’t been running more dungeons. There are some groups who would even consider paying for a tank just because of how bad it is.
---
thank you very much! &lt;3
---
This is what I said about this topic to another person:       
---
        
---
As someone who got a priest to 60 this is they way I see it, if I'm there as a healer I get first dib on any healer gear, second are druids/paladins who are tanking but know they have to got resto/holy and third are druid/paladins/shaman that are going as dps.
---
If the healer is a druid/shaman/pally the get second dib on tanking gear and can roll on dps items same as the dps.
---
If the tank is a druid/pally they get second dib on healing gear and can roll on dps gear same as the dps.
---
Oh and dps warriors get second dib on tanking gear if the tank is a warrior/paladin.
---
As a 60 priest now I need to put together an int set to be able to farm (right now lvl 58 mobs are hard because healing gear is shit for farming) but I get second dib to mages/locks since we aren't leveling anymore.
---
Yes like the twitch addon, but you can also download AddOns manually, unzip them and pack them into you Wow Classic Folder -&gt; Interface -&gt; AddOns
---
Yeah, nah. Tanks are in demand at the moment primarily because most people are either fresh 60 or sub 60. Endgame content never requires more than 4 tanks at any point (out of 40 players), and only 2~ of them really have to be proper Warrior tanks. While that does mean really good tanks will be in demand, all healers with above room temperature IQ will be in higher demand.
---
In three weeks when you hit lvl 15, it'll be way easier!
---
Yes - i am this 500/2000 (1800/4000 MP) ....
---
If i have a mage in my group, then ill drink 1-2 sips / Mobgroup.. if not... i will let my spirit do the job... First of all, i have manapots if something creepy happense, 2nd dungeons are easy es fuck....
---
Just lern to downrank and stop overhealing shit... you will know how much mana you need, after the first two mobgroups... normally you have a "feel" your group.If your Tank / DPS  sux, then you will need to drink alot...if not - just chill and watch a tv show, while healing.
---
And btw. if the tank ist too slow, then the 500/2000 MP priest easy transforms to "the pusher".
---
xD
---
I think I should point out something, the thread yesterday the guys name was roysun (with a u)
---
The real royson is named Royson (with an o)
---
Am I missing something? Is it just some addon that makes all o's appear as u's or am I reading the text wrong, or is roysun his alt? I think the real royson is just memeing and claiming he actually did ninja as a joke since it really wasnt him if that's the case.
---
Edit: really downvoted with no answer? Is it actually royson that ninja looted those edgemasters yesterday or was it this roysun guy? Or is roysun just roysons alt? Because theyre different names.
---
I believe a prominent streamer said a slur on stream and dismissed it as a "heated gaming moment" and it got meme'd to hell.
---
If you know the market and how disenchant works, it makes money while leveling. You just need to know what you'll get and if It's worth more and about half the times It's the case.
---
I thought that enchanting would be a gold sink but It's been a godsend for me. I have more dificulties with it at 291 now that I gotta grind a runed arcanite rod and Crusader/Lifesteal/SP+ recipes.
---
On my server crusader click is at 20 gold though and recipe around 200 gold. It comes back pretty fast but you gotta love living on IF bridge.
---
Dont always listen to people here on reddit. Ele shammy does not have the mana issues most people peddle all the time (its considerably better than boomkin). If you take your precautions. You need to downrank spells depending on the situation. You will face issues on huhuran or similar bosses with high nature resist, but apart from that it is certainly playable.
---
There is also the possibility of playing elehancement, which is like spelladin but as a shammy. Dumb as hell but it should put out respectable numbers :)
---
He’s not your buddy, guy.
---
Good reason to go Horde.
---
This only works as long as only one person is acting up and you definitely need other people in the group backing you up. Otherwise it just becomes "you're just a shit tank" (coming from the mage that insta blizzards any pull)
---
My current goal is to obtain Impervious Giant for my feral druid tank (BRD, 7 Dwarfs). As I understand there are many different routes people take when doing BRD (arena, lava run etc..), which one should I be doing?
---
buchering a donkey?
---
&gt;ORRRR Blizzard can use pictures and video evidence to temp ban and delete the character
---
Dont think they do anything if you ninja. Just from memory they said something like the community should handle that themselves. Maybe thats the reason he did it. Knows asmonbold will bring the players to them anyways, so there is no penalty for him.
---
Get about 50g or so over the amount you need for an epic mount so you're not screwed for repairs and stuff, then just buy it.
---
Get helped by a passing player with some tough mobs cause being a low level warrior sucks.
---
"thanks bud, appreciate it"
---
"please don't patronize me"
---
Lol.
---
I'll call out OOM when necessary, but it doesn't feel like too much to glance at the unit frames inbetween pulls and check the mana levels. It just makes sense not to go rushing headlong into the fray without assessing the situation. It'll also save a lot of needless wear on my "o" and "m" buttons.
---
Actually thats only half true.
---
In my experience all 60s who I played with in the first 2 weeks were super friendly and I knew all of them by Name. Now there are so many 60s which are super toxic scrubs.
---
#nochanges
---
&gt; 2. Slow weapon speed means higher top damage on the weapon 
---
Why not look at the maximum damage number in the first place instead of weapon speed?
---
not a veteran on druid but this is my leveling spec atm [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-5041021303222151](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-5041021303222151) at lvl41 (can effectively tank 5mans without thick hide) and if you lean towards dps more then remove 2 points from primal fury then put it on improved shred.
---
I think so yeah!
---
So when I want to sell something on the AH, and use Auctioneer, it always tells me that the price is less than vendor selling price. I take a look at the min bid people are posting, it's 1c. Why is that? Should I just vendor my stuff, or bid 1c and the bids will outgrow the vendor selling price eventually?
---
Yeah, sorry for the confusion :)
---
Make a new character and check
---
What bag sorting addon is that??? My bags drive me crazy
---
I bought my mount at level 40 and I killed massive amount of tigers and vasilisks in stv and other places. They drop vendor trash that sell for 7-8 silver each and they stack up to 10. You farm these until your bag is full and go back to town. Rinse and repeat
---
love the rain
---
No it isn't.
---
Man I wish my guilds tabard looked this cool.
---
WTB guild tabard designer!
---
Why do ppl keep posting 2v1 where the 1 is always 4-5 levels higher than the 2 attackers, kills them both, and claims a gigantic victory?
---
I was thinking of the same thing!
---
If you're alive then what's the big deal? Totems cost mana. Do you want to stop after every other pull so they can drink?
---
1 more month is to less for the comunity to be mainly in the endgame (60)
---
i guese, somewhere end november or close before chrismas, it will get anouced at blizzcon for sure i think
---
Hope he gets banned :)
---
I leveled herbalism to 230 now and Im stuck on alchemy on 110 because i sold the herbs that you need to level.
---
I usually sell cloth on ah but almost never gear.
---
Same, I have 2 bags full of totems, reagents, water, potions, healing set. If I'm doing a quest with multiple questitems to collect, its a total mess.
---
By chance did you learn most if not all your skills for your class? Or have you been levelling crafting professions? If so that's where your gold has vanished, Auction House too potentially?
---
In an ideal world, only learn certain skills when levelling up that are benefiting your levelling, have skinning and either herb or mining, vendor all the skinning and depending on AH, sell or vendor the other professions items too. Doing that you should be well on your way to have a mount for 40. I have a mage at 40 that has fell 15g short of the required amount because I respecced a couple of times and levelled tailoring a bit too much. My 34 rogue on another server currently has 50g with 10g tied up on AH, easily will have a mount for 40
---
Depends on your definition of decent. I would say a group that clears the fastest is objectively the best group. If you were not running faster with AOE it was either shit Mages or you didnt know what you were doing. AOE is by far the fastest clear for most dungeons during leveling. It is not even close.
---
Well he meant that Blizz will take action. At least I hope they do. They said they would in cases like that.
---
Depends on how many consumables you're using I think. They're very close in the spreadsheets but since you can get so much spellpower from consumables the crit can become more valuable.
---
I will never join groups that have items reserved. I'm completely against the concept of pug groups with reserves. Even if it's an item I don't care about.
---
The entire concept is a declaration by the person that they don't care about any one else's time.
---
Everyone is putting in effort, everyone should be on equal ground.
---
So you went 1 at a time and still got 2 levels in 8-10 hours and made plenty of gold on top? Or can hunters take on multiple casters at once?
---
God, you sound like an asshole.
---
"The good players are long 60" - No, no they aren't. There are plenty of good/decent players that have not reached 60 yet because they are not capable of dropping +5-8 hours into this game every single day.
---
I never block someone, but I've been looking at his post history... I don't think I'll lose something of value if I do
---
*Edit: never mind, blocking is not what I thought it was on Reddit
---
You must be real fun at parties
---
Just grind... and sell stuff you find - there are tons of guides and videos out there showcasing good spots, just search a bit... it‘s not rocket science ;)
---
Faerlina could benefit from this guy being hacked/character DELETE
---
So the Shaman didnt wanna use totems, because they were too much of a hazzle?
---
There are Goblins right next to the flight Masters
---
This guy is pretty obsessed with streamers looking at his post history
---
Whatd he do?
---
Its really just asmongold's community that is so bad.
---
Atleast in TBC we would rotate shamans in and out of the melee group for heroism buff.
---
Actually the mass is still not level 60.
---
Alliance warrior level 23 And I am at a awkward point with my quests.  My question is what mob/area should I grind out to be back on par with my quests?
---
Yes, I'm quite happy to play on a server without these shenanigans and just observe them from a safe distance.
---
As someone who cared for an elderly person, you don't need to sit there holding their hand 24/7. Just being in the same house to respond to emergencies, providing medicine and running errands, and, most of all, just being there goes a long way more than being a successful clean person half a world away who only calls once a week to check up for 15 minutes.
---
I mean, I get that you can be mad at this guy, but sitting at a PC for most of the day doesn't preclude you from caring for your loved ones. It's not really that different from being at work whole day, only you're in close proximity all the time.
---
There's like 2 or 3 others on my realm that all have a variation of a guildies name, and that's the real classic experience.
---
Dude just got murdered by his own words.  Appreciate this breakdown
---
There hasn't been a single anti-semetic trope from this character. It's purely dumb memes like interdimentional alien invasions or the devil spawning into the real world through human bodies as part of the warlock class or super male vitality alchemy potions. The goblins literally have a cartel faction (which is what it's referencing to) and the "globalists" are the forsaken/scourge from the eastern continent. 
---
Alex Jones is a fucking shitbag but the quotes he says are hilarious out of context which is the purpose of this toon's roleplay.
---
Shiet cant relate at all.
---
Dont know if its easier getting gold in this version of classic but i had 140g when i dinged 40. Did not sell any epic or anything valuable. Just skins and iron bars.
---
@lvl 45 now with mount and 200g. Getting epic mount is going to be easy if the gold continues to flow in at this pace.
---
what others said and also get an addon that tells you for how much stuff vendors for. there are a shitload of quest where you have to decide between 2 or 3 rewards that you can not use but one of them sells for double the price than the other two.
---
Content is content my dude
---
Remember that we're starting at patch 1.12, which is already a mountain of difference from vanilla.
---
That said, the difficulty is relative to the time period. 15 years ago people were really bad at the game, as such the game just seemed a lot more difficult. For it's time, it was hard. It's just in modern times, with people having years of experience now under their belt, and the absolute avalanche of guides and addons, the difficulty is much reduced.
---
lmao the probability of this happening - gz! :D
---
Why do people care about lvl 35 blues that get replaced in like 2 days...
---
Shit horde players! Ha
---
Think we squeezed out a full run (minus jailbreak) on my 2nd go through there in about 3-3½ hours yesterday, was quite surprised. We had some unnecessary wipes, but very smooth on the whole. Having a good tank definitely helped a LOT - depending on the gear and knowledge level it can really be night and day. Seeing how this guy executed the pulls and how durable he was made me question the tank I was running with 2-3 days ago. 
---
But yea, BRD is one hell of a ride. I read a great, sad story (written with great comical sense) of a tank's journey through BRD [in here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d6dt6o/the_blackrock_depths_experience/) \- worth a read for sure if you have a few minutes. Laughed until I cried!
---
Guess in his hands that staff becomes a Delusionary Rod real quick.
---
I think I am the only one who thinks the epic mount is overrated and not needed... currently does not make any difference if it takes 2min more or less to reach a destination. Maybe only if you are ob a PVP server... or the earliest with Phase 2 and Battlegrounds... if you plan on doing any PVP that is.
---
Seen that exact name etc on razorgore, two or three times actually . It is a thing.
---
I've had really good experiences so far, just this WE I ran scholo with a few randoms all of them really chill, I occasionally used Power Infusion on our mage (which we joked about as it was more like Aggro Infusion), after a few runs said mage offered to help me grind that last level from 59 to 60, hope I can repay him some day.
---
wierd, maybe he didnt bother doing the quest for totems?
---
I genuinely can't even tell what class you are.
---
I just make my own group. Much less of a headache and doesn’t take long on my server to form one for dungeons throughout all levels.
---
Escape artist and blink. Rank 1 fristbolt. We have counters
---
Reckoning doesn’t store hits in this iteration of the game, it only resets the swing timer. I would honestly just go deep ret or holy shock ret if you’re really wanting to use SoC
---
What did he say before deleting it ?
---
Mages are the new huntards..
---
imagine destroying your reputation for a sum of 500 gold. 500 gold can be farmed in the span of a week.
---
Fucking trash.
---
The best spec for AOE damage is Frostfire, with extra crit on Flamestrike and Ignite. Nova, Flamestrike, CoC, AE. Spell batching allows for both CoC and Flamestrike to get the 50% extra crit from shatter because - as surprisingly many mages don't know - shatter works on any spell, not just frost. 
---
I'm comfortably doing 30% more damage than a Blizzard mage in identical gear, but one also needs to properly kite the pack. Doesn't matter what the tank does or for how long - the shattered double hit of FS and CoC instantly pulls everything aside from the tank's main target.
---
All that being said, I don't make AOE groups for two main reasons. First, it's slower than a melee comp because of the drinking downtime. Second, I like to get cloth loot when it drops. ;)
---
Orc rogue
---
I'd say have a look on character selection screen and check the class descriptions to see what you like.
---
Since warlocks and hunters use pets those might be slightly more approachable than others to a beginner, whereas warrior can be a bit difficult to level as first ever character (quite gear dependent). Mage is overly popular right now (and very powerful), but with the current meta I don't believe group play as mage to be very attractive or beginner friendly.
---
If they have no damning evidence, they can't do a single thing about it. If the players are communicating outside of battle.net, their hands are tied on the matter.
---
I would expect him to do so, if not Asmon will have another "argh drama QQ" meltdown. People in this place including Mccool underestimate the people of Faerlina, and their mail...
---
It's actually called "Details!" :)

I was hoping someone from your end would see this! I recorded a good chunk of the experience, but I enjoyed this clip the most. About how many of you showed up for this?
---
I play on a medium-high pop pve server, I don't think I've even seen a queue after the first week.
---
Wow lol
---
You will pay for this hereccy!
---
anyone purely grinded to level here? At what level is the most efficient to just grind vs just doing quests?
---
Shadow priests are no joke.
---
Go clean you're room!
---
Yes it does work and was already confirmed to not be a bug.
---
Anyone who rolls on a server with a popular streamer and his dumbfucked community, can only blame himself.
---
Soul stone is a meme in PVP I love when someone spams an emote and I pop up will 75% hp and mana and kill them
---
It's not the glory days of Maydie anymore.... Warcraftvideos.com no longer has the best content and people are not putting months and months into true Epic videos. So we have a complete change in atmosphere.... It sucks
---
why is there "total raw gold" two times?
---
Stop giving him attention
---
Wow assmongold and is dirty fiends are really showing their true side. Just stop watching their conent.
---
&gt;You wanna kill that gnome just because he's a gnome?
---
Or someone might snipe the stuff for a few coppers. I generally never do the 1c thing, but made some decent gold on it by sniping other peoples' auctions last second.
---
Delet please.
---
had my first epic world drop too ... the green tower ... too bad noone ever, who has the brain to have the money at that time, will think about buying leveling epics ..
---
at best I can sell it for around 10g which is nothing when you compare it to easier obtainable stuff which sells for more - at the same time for someone on the way to 40 10g is 1/9 of the mount so alot - still the satisfaction finding a world epic is there so gz! :)
---
Hey,
---
in addition to my other reply, think about this as a drop rate. You have a 5% 'drop rate' to die. 
---
So, use a drop rate calculator like:
---
https://en.calc-site.com/probabilities/drop_item
---
At 10 pp's, you have a 40% chance to die. 
---
Alternatively, think of it like this:
---
- Vanish CD: 180s
---
- Running Back: 180s
---
ASSUME that the next mob you pp will kill you 
---
If the time to run back = the wait time on your vanish CD, then it's always better to pp. 
---
If the time to run back is &lt; the wait time on your vanish CD, then it's always better to pp.
---
If the time to run back is &gt; the wait time on your vanish CD...well, that's when you need to weigh the risks. In this scenario, you wait. But that's probably not the case for your situation.
---
EDIT: Also, if you relax the above assumption i.e. you will die on the 2nd mob, that's when you can calculate if it's worth pping or waiting.
---
I've seen a guy like that in SM yesterday - I was lock, they were priest. Kept healing Life Tap with Flash Heal with massive overheal more often than not and freaked out in just about identical manner when I suggested using Renew instead so that I could match tapping to the amount of healing I get and drink water for the rest.
---
The asmon hate thread was 10 times bigger than this. Didn't do anything.
---
It’s a cycle. One of them was getting camped or ganked relentlessly themselves, finally got some help, and now they’re rampaging because the slightly higher level ganker always runs off like a bitch and they’re thirsty for blood now.
---
"Maisy didn't look at me today. Saw her looking at old leatherface Gumphy though. Hope the old badger beds her and she gets crabs"

---
"We found Ravager today, that old moron brought it with him and we managed to bag it. Avelyn said he wanted it. I said 'you can't even use it! You're a bloody gnome! All you do is stab people in the back!', and he says, you know what he says? He says 'I need the money, I'm getting that robot pigeon' or whatever that stupid thing they ride is called. Bloody gnomes, give them a piece of Ironforge and now they think they can swagger around being bloody useless. Bloody gnomes"
---
"Beardface McBeardface that bearded blithering idiot-"
---
"Hey you're a bloody gnome! Get lost you bloody gnome! One section of Ironforge and a lot of generosity and you all think you run the place!"
---
&gt;Why? Probably because that broken private server garbage doesn't work.
---
Because they're bad.
---
The healer had totems, but I noticed they weren't up on big pack pulls so I shot a friendly reminder - and the tank spoke for healer and said what's pictured.
---
I agree if it's an entire pug run, but there's still cases where it's completely legit. 
---
if I'm making a pug BRD emp farm group as a warrior you'll be damned sure I'm reserving Ironfoe, does that mean I'm not caring about anyone else's time? No, I'm not gonna invite any other warriors anyway so everyone else is there for different drops.
---
You guys speak like some kind of mob is going to gut him.
---
Its a game, and on big servers, literally no-one cares that you ninjaed, and if you keep spamming in trade that "X is a ninja" people will just tell you to shut up and stop spamming.
---
And anyhow, he has his big guild with people backing him up, so there is no way that he would have any troubles finding people to play with etc.
---
What do you mean with "something" is gonna happen with him by the way? Its not bannable to ninja-loot if thats what you think.
---
Okay, and for what reason? This shitbag needs to be known by everyone for being a shitbag.
---
Me as a rogue: "Fuck you, I'm not a meme! I earned this 2v1!!"

The Warlock: "I AM THE MEEEEEEEEME!!!"

Honestly hope something changes sometime for you and it ends and you get to feel happiness:) Glad to hear you have people on your life you find it worth to continue the fight for.

Don't forget to take your tampon out of the door, whatever the fuck that means lol.
---
Sell the gold for like £500 online
---
I mean where does the claim come from to be able to have one of the best weapons in the game?
---
A MMO is alive when there is a difference between players. You will only have very few players with r14 on the server anyway. Unless you can sacrifice at least 3-4 weeks you simply won't be able to get r14.
---
This is the major difference classic WoW and modern WoW.
---
Oh look a streamer pet. Nice dog, now be a good boy and simmer down.
---
Must be a bug.
---
It's easy to apologize when you already got what you wanted. But i am pretty sure this means he gets away with it despite what he did since he technically "made things right".
---
Because they were dumb enough to attack him in the first place.
---
Quests? Or just go and grind ?
---
Even if they cost mana, I don't see how it's so difficult to drop them on big pulls when they have significant benefits to the dps which results in clearing mobs faster.  I've played shaman and I always make it a priority to have totems down, but maybe that's just me.
---
Yeah, but they cant catch you after you blink.
---
Remember remeber the 5th of december  
---
The patch day treason and plot.   
---
I see no reason, for MS and Cleavin',  
---
Since Tseric wants us to spec *Prot*.   
---
\*Old poem, don't know who originally posted it.
---
What is meta? I’ve gotten a night elf hunter to level 7 so far and it’s been fun, but I don’t want it to limit what I can do later on in the game. I want to be able to take part in those battles I always see videos of and inflict lots of damage. But I do also want to play in groups like you mentioned.
---
Or it is just cringe
---
I think the largest "noob" classes are currently: Warriors who claim "Only dps"/Don't understand how to tank, and spell cleave mages.
---
Just report him, he is scamming.... that's against the term of service!
---
Can this be done as a rogue?
---
I hope not, he lied to the ppl in his group which is considered a scam, i hope blizzard does smthing about this.
---
disgusting.
---
Horde here, but have you done Searing Gorge? If not, that's a nice zone to do before Un'goro. 
---
And yes, tank more dungeons! I don't see why no one want Mara, it has lots of awesome gear. Poke around in your guild chat, /join LookingForGroup and set up a group of your own. Reserve 2-3 hours or so for a full run, it's pretty long.
---
Censoring how much of a bad guy asmongold is just hides him from the light.
---
Why do you care so much?
---
Tfw every reply says they don't notice streamers much and it turns out that Reddit blew things out of proportion. What a surprise...
---
mate it's not like he's a fucking murderer lmao
---
Hey, as I said, I don't mind the whispers so it's not that big of a deal - for me at least.
---
I'm pretty sure the chest is bis for a good while for warriors though, otherwise I agree.
---
Came here for this.
---
It's bleeding into this subreddit too. Getting more toxic every day.
---
Maybe one day I'll remember to start using subjective as part of my vocabulary and I'll think back to this moment :) Not a native speaker, many common but still slightly advanced (?) words like that escape me where they remain understandable but I never think to write them.
---
Yeah, discarding comment happens sometimes. I don't start writing a comment thinking I won't post it, but sometimes you do write 10 lines only to realize I really don't want someone to reply and argue about this anymore and then just cancel posting. Sometimes not worth the grey hair you get from that upcoming reply, even if you wouldn't respond further.
---
Thanks for the ideas!
---
I'm 60 and feel like I'm levelling slow now so I get where you're coming from.
---
"All of your hard work went into this"
---
At this point we all know that, nothing personal, let's try keep this "drama" elsewhere.
---
started my 4th char yesterday - highest is lvl 48 - i just love the journey!
---
Here’s the thing, though: if you join an aoe farm group, then you ARE NOT THE TANK. 
---
You will not have aggro from most mobs. Your job is to hold the herd together with strategic taunts and to interrupt and attack casters/range mobs who can’t be kited. 
---
Joining an aoe farm group and talking about how threat works, that just shows how ignorant you are
---
That's astronomic levels of fuck up, wow
---
Right, but this is like his thing though, right? I don't follow him, but this clip has be believing that he gets viewers by being a troll and ninja.
---
Man, I miss Dark Age of Camelot sometimes because that game didn’t take your rank away just because you didn’t log in
---
I would recommend level 55+ if you are a warrior.
---
Yeah but it's not like I was telling the healer or tank they weren't doing their job properly or they were bad - just simply pointing it out.  Totems help a lot for dps , especially warriors which I am.
---
Yea....
---
What about a mace spec rogue? Is he not equally making an attempt?
---
Didn't you know? You're not a shitty person any more, you're a *troll* and anybody who objects is to be mocked. All ironically of course.
---
that was a long fucking pause and then nothing lmao
---
And next time Im playing my mage in a pug, everyone gets to pay for food/water/portal.  
---
Greedy bitches, get greedy treatment.
---
I don't see what that has to do with preserving untouched Classic and making other servers for Classic+ etc. The gameplay can be maintained with just 5000-10000 active players. Honor rank degradation will also keep people rotating in pvp. It happened on private servers, no reason it wouldn't happen here.
---
This is why I’m not playing classic. It’s been ruined by this elitist mentality. Ninja looting is a permanent issue
---
Doing Cath in 5 pulls or ZF zombies in like 8 is always going to be substantially faster than a normal run. Mass AoE is more mana efficient than single target.
---
Ok.  But we're not talking about using the word condescendingly.  We're pretty obviously talking about using it as a friendly greeting--thus rarely a scenario where someone might take offense.
---
I'm taking a break from farming HoJ I hear Angerforge in my dreams
---
I was super helpful throughout the run, guided as much as possible and the tank for some reason was super bitter the whole time, and got super defensive when I asked the healer for totems.
---
with the big ninja loot this guy had one chance, one opportunity to make it as a streamer and in to asmon's inner circle. 
---
being an asshole can be funny, and if he would have played his cards right he could have cashed in.
---
too bad for him all he could come up with was this cringey af clip and speech . jesus christ that was bad.
---
I bought mine at 47 don't trip
---
Was this in Everbloom? I remember using the multi-passenger mounts just to get other peeps up the cliff if they couldn’t make the jump.
---
There’s an Olympus 10 at least now, maybe even 11.
---
It’s Embrace of the Lycan, drops in ZF.
---
Spellcleave is from like wotlk...
---
Well, I always had assholes in vanilla, too.
---
Most level 52 undead rogues I see are around STV or darkshire
---
Or leave a turd behind.
---
Thanks - is it just that one?
---
If this happens to me as a tank, I just let them die, they usually tend to understand quickly I'm not going to spend my time running after Mobs.
---
And what does this have to do with cultivating toxicity exactly other than you taking an 18 second clip out of context
---
You don't need to be prot spec to tank. Even at 60 you can EASILY tank with 0/31/19
---
the tryhards that only achieve mediocre results are the worst people to play with.
---
haha. i was removing buffs and spamming things to make the frames light up. so... yeah.
---
[hashtag]nochanges ;)
---
I think your way is a legitimate way to play but I personally would rather change the spot than spend enough time pvping to spend that many soul stones while my primary goal is leveling. But then again I'm on a pve server and my pvp server experience is from a pserver that was not quite as ridiculously overpopulated as most classic servers.
---
Could you also share the time it took you to kill the thousand whelps?
---
Yup, I’ll golfclap, res at the spirit healer and take a 10 minute break. And I won’t even go whine on reddit about it. Imagine that.
---
Sad af :(
---
No shit. Guy's a car wreck. A really shitty car wreck full of trash.
---
I'm realist and stubborn. I wouldn't start a farm that I didn't finish. But then again it does seem like only some classes have long farms ahead of them. As a feral druid I didn't feel like there were any important loots that had low chance of dropping. Really seems like it's mostly rogues/warriors and other specs that want the same gear, who have to farm many separate dungeons for their semi-bis gear.
---
that name too, perfect combo
---
Maybe a debate on difficulty?
---
I mean it's not like the content is objectively hard and you have daily threads about how dungeons are difficult and how you need perfect group and OP is boasting about everything is easy. Any look at this sub or lfg channel  in game shows that everybody is stomping on PvE content.
---
Now of course, the road to 60 is still very long for casual players and finding 40 players ready to cooperate and be present week after week for months is super hard but it's a different kind of hard.
---
Now we can close our eyes and pretend everything is ok and there's absolutely no problem with not having challenging content in PvE but, as you pointed, it's already a daily topic and it will only get worse: in a few months, the big chunk of player will be lvl60 with many of their max level BiS and, like OP, will consider that they completed the game.
---
Damn that's rough. How many runs did you do?
---
In the immortal words of our healer, “yeah, don’t worry man, I’ll funnel all my gold into water, so you can get drops”.
---
&gt;The entire point of your argument is that 2s is no different than 300g.
---
No, my entire point is that gold is gold, regardless of how much. Stop trying to put words into my mouth.
---
Stop replying to comments about it then. Just shut up about it. Why do these replies make you mad? It's digital words and doesn't matter. Grow the fuck up
---
I love stuff like this. I’d love to see one but for Mara farm runs or SM runs at 60. I am getting broke fast tanking MC and Ony, and now that I’m not leveling anymore I don’t have the flow of gold and stuff to sell  but I’m not sure where to go or what to farm to maximize my gold/time spent.
---
I was referring to raids only and that's if you want to MT. And another person replied stating that only 1 fight requires a war MT (mexx in Naxx)
---
Brain power!
---
Auctioneers can be killed and camped on PVE servers
---
Frankly I don't care if the guy is toxic or does anything I just want to stop fucking hearing about him. I already have to see his hideous goblin-ass face all over my youtube recommendations despite disliking and "Not Interested"-ing every single one I see.
---
***ASMONGOLD REACTS TO HIS MOM TAKING A SHIT***
---
Everyone brings something to a dungeon group or a raid.
---
What you do on your own, or while idling in a capital, is your business. But, in a dungeon or a raid youre part of a team. I play a mage. How would you like it, if I charged you for food at the start of a dungeon run, or a portal at the end of it?
---
If you're greedy or cheat (if you loot the chest for yourself after the run) it's a great way to get a bad reputation.
---
The issue is the people in that group knew the officer for a long time, and he still fucked them over
---
You rushed through and missed the actual content. You've finished the game.
---
You might as well head off now.
---
dont re-roll to a mage
---
Savory Deviate Delight is 1g/stack right now on my server, absolute waste of time.
---
I feel bad for no one if they made the decision to play on the streamer server. Everyone knew this would happen and here it is.
---
Ah yes, the weekly glaring sun screenshot we’ve definitely not seen before.
---
You still get an upvote for not using a phone though!
---
Let me know!
---
Because in TBC arena comps that stacked melees were called "Melee cleave" comps.
---
But in wrath double caster teams gained a lot of popularity and the term "wizard cleave" was born as a twist on that, then it became castercleave and then finally spellcleave.
---
Also AOE doesnt specify what classes you take since warriors can also AOE.
---
Is this a new pasta? 
---
This is a new pasta now.
---
It's actually so grating.
---
he showed his login screen, he has both Royson and Roysun. both 60
---
Shut the fuck up you whiney gamer
---
So it's not ALL Windfury here.
---
You can see the Shaman casting Purge, removing the Mage's shield.
---
Followed by a Windfury proc (1 crit, 2 hits) and then followed up with an Earth Shock.
---
Could have been even nastier if more hits critted in that WF.
---
What are some other good vendor trash farming routes? I'm 37 atm and would like some ideas on where to farm
---
Yes i know, but going there, alone, on lvl 30 is a suicide on a PVP server :D
---
Don't you guys have printscreen keys?!
---
Had this happen on 4 characters. Just figured it out though. Take flight path to camp Taurajo, take the quest enraged thunder lizard (you won't see it on your map available because it's low level now for you), complete it and the follow up really quick and AAP will begin working again and send you to Ashenvale.
---
Alternatively, you can do what the others said below, but the sequence is suppose to continue in Ashenvale.
---
Gotta admit, I walked around with my wand 24/7 in Duskwood. Such a great place!
---
I play Rogue too. At level 35 I made it a goal to train first aid to 300. Best decision I made. When ganked, I can heal to full in 1 Gouge with Heavy Runecloth Bandage.
---
You've never watched him yet you feel this strongly about him?
---
Wth? As a tank im always keeping an eye on my healers mana. I don't expect my healer to have to shout at me just so he can drink.
---
Just check mana levels every pull and wait a few secs for ppl to start drinking, usually you can pull while the healer is drinking and tank for a bit without needing heals.
---
Dunked on those noobs!
---
Asmongold seems to be the lowest of scum when it comes to WoW players and streamers
---
He does.
---
Asmongold is a true WoW addict.
---
His ego is tied so closely to WoW that it was honestly sad to watch him during the early days of BFA. He was in a deep state of depression and couldn't bring himself to stop playing WoW and move on.
---
It took him weeks of moping and complaining to finally play another game, which boomed his stream, but then he was back at WoW again just to AFK in cities and watch videos all day.
---
WoW to him is more of a home than the real world.
---
It's a difference between a BiS weapon for half the raid content and a sub-par pvp gimmick build. Everyone would condemn a rogue for taking Ironfoe from a fury warrior so making a group where it's not possible for that rogue to take it because it's reserved is perfectly justifiable imo. 
---
If he join's a group with Ironfoe reserved he's agreeing to not make an attempt and instead get loads of speedy attempts at getting a HoJ which is perfectly reasonable. I'm not expecting him or anyone else to stick around after they have the drop they need.
---
It’s not tanking but pulling and it only works with a priest who shields it. You summon it and then run through more and more enemies until the eye is dead (which is 1 hit without a shield) and then everything runs towards you. Then a real tank uses some aoe threat ability and gets their attention or a mage freezes them and you start aoe bombing
---
He purged the mage's shield, had 1 windfury proc (20% chance) and then followed up with an Earth Shock.
---
I wouldn't say "the stars align" with this one. The stars aligning is when your windfury's 3 hits all crit. This was 1 crit.
---
Pedicure is 10/10 as well.
---
i also thought this lmao
---
Do you already have the lionheart plans? If yes, keep bs for money making, since the helmet is bis forever (I think). If you don't have the plans and want to buy them, keep bs for the same reason mentioned above. If you don't have the plans, want to buy them, craft the helm and then unlearn bs, don't do it. That is a waste of money and it's way cheaper to let someone else craft the helmet for you.
---
No because of people like: 
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/db0ofl/asmongolds_officer_buys_epic_mount_with_money/
---
People ninja. It's a fact of life and you are more than happy to live in your denial, but the only way to guarantee that someone won't ninja loot, is to need it (BoEs ofc). 
---
idgaf what the group loot rules are if i'm pugging. I'll go with what they say, but if I started a group, it'd be need BoEs.
---
as a horde member I may offer you a teleport to the graveyard :)
---
Everyone knows the Olympus guilds by their reputation already.
---
They are filled with mostly bad players that don't know how to play the game and really just zerging things down is their only strength.
---
**SPOILER ALERT:** [It didn't](https://clips.twitch.tv/ClearEncouragingPlumCoolCat)
---
Well, seeing as he's riding on his back, if you nuke Gyth you kinda nuke Rend too
---
Imagine playing Lock in PvP and not being SL like a casual. Also besides either fear, Lock can use anything from  engineering, Imp. CoEx, Death Coil, Seduce (Succubus), the fears of course but WotF would break and grant a few seconds on immunity, and the possibility to stun off of RoF/HF/SF (very unlikely you see this but you never know). Plus you still have access to shit like double sac during the time you cannot cast fear.  If you are dying to a Rogue just because of Will that's a L2P issue. A good warlock should beat a good rogue 1v1 assuming the Lock is specced for it aka the best 1v1 spec in Classic. A very good rogue (top percentile) will probably beat a very good Lock though.
---
You didn't mention Dwarf at all in your post either btw you said Orc and Gnome racials are right up there, maybe you should be the one to re-read your post. 
---
Since you said Alliance Priest guess I'll die in that same scenario of it being a Rogue, They can just Stoneform all your shit off. It's pretty normal for 1v1 specced Spriests to talent into Imp. Inner Fire over points into Imp. Mind Blast due to the unreliable nature of casting it off CD and they always get Unbreakable Will. Then with PW:S, Renew, Desperate Prayer there should be no way you 100-0 them in an opener. Especially in this day and age of Spy. Meanwhile they can fish for Blackout procs for a stun on you until they can Fear you again. 
---
If you catch them out of Shadowform in a reopener you might kill them though but again that's relying on the Rogue to severely outplay the Priest here which is going to be melting your face even while stunned thanks to DoTs plus Shadow Weaving and let's be honest the vast majority of Rogues are going to be shitters
---
Every class has its use and niche. All classes are good. Hunters are quite formidable if you learn to play them well.
---
You grind mobs, you vendor everything, and you do it again.
---
I grinded 37-40 on the beasts In Des and made all 90 gold for my mount.
---
Fineman does not approve of your evil summonings
---
That’s hilarious
---
Before yesterday I had no idea that guy even existed. I would have been better off having not known.
---
Same goes for Asmongold. Never knew the guys name, never cared, still dont care really. However that guys getting talked about non stop. The only video I've seen of him, was of him watching old videos of himself being a complete dirtbag and littering outside his old home/rented house. He was still giggling over it and it was disgusting behavior. 
---
Fuck this guy and his brand, including all his fans.
---
&gt; LOL pretending like there wasn't an obvious power imbalance in the party LMAO
---
LOL pretending like being a *Party Leader* is an "obvious power imbalance" LMAO
---
That you are even trying to equate it to someone committing armed robbery is flat out hilariously stupid.
---
Not a cult
---
So are you skipping the first 5 bosses or so?
---
There's some ones BoE from lbrs/ubrs that have slightly better int/stam stats dread something(?) Can't remember the name.
---
SM Arm/Cath grind was pretty decent (even for me who did not play in Spellcleave groups) as greens and blues can sell for 1g+ each, and gold drops + silk is decent. 
---
Otherwise I'd recommend finding some (relatively empty) area with beasts one or a few levels below you and kill, kill, kill for vendor trash and occasional greens. Skinning would help here, but might not worth dropping Alch for it. 
---
I waited with training my Artisan LW/Skin until after I got mount to save 9 gold there (10 % of the mount) and I also saved gold on not buying unnecessary abilities or, at least, higher ranks of those unnecessary abilities. I recommend you do the same when saving for the epic one, depending on class and spec some abilities are pretty much useless. 
---
Get an AH addon, get an idea of the worth of items used for crafting/quests/professions, and try to buy those items under their market value and flip them for profit. If there are any particular potions people use often, buy cheap mats and brew for profit. Might not work at your level though, as quite many Alchs will be at least your level.
---
What do you mean, what did people expect? I have seen ZERO comment from anyone directly concerned about this issue.
---
400g isn't that much after 60. Could be gotten in a days worth of grinding at 60 tbh
---
Looks like someone had a few bad experiences at WC and SM
---
depending on your server, sell your services as a tank to pugs.
---
Wait, what? I literally get ganked and you say I gank people? 10/10 logic right there lol.
---
To be fair there's a video linked by the OP, and Asmongold states:
---
&gt;If you go ahead and ninja from some random nobody I'm going to go ahead and promote you, because that means you'll be better geared.
---
Which was clipped 3 months ago.
---
I'm not going to make a comment about how well-behaved this sub is in comparison to the streamers, but Asmongold seems like a class A twat.
---
I chose mining blacksmithing and I'm permanently poor from it. I'll eventually be able to make some good things but I'll lvl 55 with 270 smithing and haven't had a stack over 70g since I bought my mount
---
Oh damn, we have it tough dont we?
---
Quests. I bet you havent done them all yet. Go tank 1-2 more deadlines for exp too.
---
Any updates on this? Is it really working like a grenade stun and not an actual stun?
---
“Look at all my binds”
---
Covers 40% of the screen with buttons he has bound
---
that's quite the warped logic imo, if the need is also for gold, why does greed exist?
---
This stopped being funny literally years ago
---
I farmed BRD like crazy. did nothing but BRD for a week straight, at least 6 runs an evening, no HoJ and no glad chest yet.
---
I had around the same at your level, I've got 110g at 38 now. Definitely use the auction house to your gain.
---
But there are so many... does that really happen...
---
Playing as a rogue with error speech on seems like a really good way to drive yourself insane.
---
Spamming buttons,
---
"Not enough energy!"
---
Nice job though.
---
sorry fam #nochanges
---
Oh, it all makes sense now, thanx :)
---
This is what confuses me the most about the way people are shocked and appaled by these things. Do they not remember how things were, and really still are? Is it kids and teenagers who havent been around long enough to see how this stuff is? I really dont understand it. It seems to be this sub in particular for whatever reason, and I really dont know why
---
its my alt, i am super poor as well
---
Dumb question perhaps but is there a roll for the skin when it drops or does the skinner get it like the usual skins?
---
I rate groups by fun, not by speed. The more buttons I get to push, the more interesting the run probably is, and tbh I had a lot of "strange" group compositions lately and many of them have been great.
---
This guy looks like the ugly kid of Bill Nye. 
---
His actions made him look even uglier. I hope justice will be done for those that got robbed by this ugly as***e.
---
Recommendations for an add on like Outfitter that helps manage/swap gear sets?
---
How does it prove it?
---
My moneys on "he _doesnt_ undertand what is going on...k"
---
The example was a BRD emp farm run which isn't an entire pug run. 
---
If someone's making a UBRS run and is reserving stuff that's BiS for half the classes that's an obvious dick move, but if someone's doing one run of a particular boss and reserving 1 item that is BiS for only their class then that's another story.
---
he's been prominently featured in the largest guild structure on the entire server, and also on asmon's stream. If asmon doesn't disavow and gkick, then I would expect the entire alliance faction to blacklist his entire officer core. If this happened on horde side, nobody would hesitate. If tmugsy swiped a boe epic (any epic) from a group against his own stated loot rules, he would get mass reported by horde guilds.
---
https://youtu.be/ednAs_l4zuw
---
Yeah maybe. I hate strat live side and if I could get more than one orb I think it’s worth it. But one orb isn’t in my opinion.
---
I would recommend you to go combat due to the dps and speed you have.
---
Its cheap to lvl as combat since you dont have to buy all skills until later.
---
And you can go combat dagger but thats not the best option during leveling.
---
You can go with daggers, maces and swords just go with slow MH and fast OH and you'll be fine. But if you don't care about the optimal leveling speed and wants to pvp during your leveling go sub. Its going to be slower but if thats what you like its going to be alot more enjoyable for you.
---
Is it the word **harder** itself that is a problem for some people?  Like, you just gave a bunch of reasons why Classic leveling obviously harder than retail.  
---
Less health, less mana, more resists, more gear dependence, less power vs same level mobs, less linear layout, etc.  
---
Raiding is obviously much more sophisticated and difficult on retail, but that's raiding.  Leveling is harder in Classic--not from a mechanics standpoint so much, but from the difference in raw power between player and mob.  It's no big deal.
---
Classic.
---
It's actually hilarious. I got into an MC pug and everyone passed over a weapon that was an objective upgrade because they got tunnel visioned by the Preraid BiS race.
---
Like dawg, yeah this weapon is a little bit faster than what you can get in lbrs, but the raw damage and stats literally make up for it. The itemization isn't perfect but it beats the competition
---
And that's why you avoid streamer servers
---
How are you going to spam swipe without tanking tho?
---
I've been playing DK since Wrath and even in BfA so I think I can form my opinion about it. Yes it's fucking garbage, probably the worst class design ever, but that's just my opinion
---
I tried watching him a few months back and had no idea who he was. I hadn't heard anything negative about the guy at that point,
---
Within 10 minutes it became very obvious this guy had no real personality and his "reaction" video thumbnails which make him look like he's "turtle-heading" were enough to put me off. But what I really don't get is how there are people who support this guy - assholes attract assholes, I guess.
---
Even if his Twitch persona is fake, if you have to lower yourself to this level of douchebagery for money then, well, you're going to be a "douchebag for life".
---
Noticable. But playable.
---
Live with it, happened in vanilla and people dealt with it, snowflakes in classic that this is gamebreaking to, return to retail
---
yes please, fuck that guy
---
Skinning / mining in badlands from 35-40 left me with 140gold when i dinged 40. And now at lvl 45 im back at 200g with mount purchased.
---
Iron bars and thick leather sells super fast at AH so you dont even need to undercut.
---
Warriors are the highest *scaling* dps class. Your mishmash of greens and blues isn't exactly impressive in BRD and Strath. Wanting to DPS only is fine, but understand you're going to get way less groups than the other "dps warrior" who also realizes he can toss on a 1 hander and shield as Arms and still do fine.
---
I ran into FOUR other paladins today who didn't want to tank SFK (20 pally quest hammer) because "sorry im specced ret right now". I'm not sure where this "you need to be this spec to do this role" thing came from since it definitely wasn't a thing during retail 2005.
---
And people say Twitch streamers are toxic.
---
Way to go kiddo.
---
Those are not horde players...they are retards.
---
I'm not sure if that's already the case, but they could prevent addons from buying things without explicit user interaction.
---
However, that wouldn't stop addons from finding the right item and presenting you with a single "Buy" button. And you can't really prevent that without breaking just about every AH addon (and from there have fun browsing through pages of 1 cloth).
---
i am pretty sure you are wrong
---
Look at him. Life has punished him to be what he is already. Btw, speaks like Asmon, "All your hard work has gone into this moment, So yea, there it is"  Talk about lack of personality and being soulless.
---
Feel free to.
---
If you cleared to content already in 3-4 weeks you have a gamer life anyway. Why do you even complain? The majority of players with a job and family are not even close to lvl 60....
---
That’s for melee.
---
i'll buy it at auction house because im very lazy..
---
IMSO SUPER SHOCKED!
---
What class are you?
---
Looks good. And tbh. U dont Play classic to look good..  the chances are small and even a decent looking set like this a great. In bfa its not even fun to have a full tier set anymore because its so easy to get. :)
---
Could someone let me know how much the blue Skeletal Club is worth? I have looted one and I am not sure how much it is worth.
---
Asmongold is disgusting, not denying that at all -
---
Id rather live 20 years as I do now than 90 as him.   Just saying that an argument that he can’t be helpful at home because he is playing 15 hours daily doesn’t make any sense.
---
If you haven’t seen any other streamer talk about their personal life you are either not listening or have seen a very low amount of streamers. 
---
How did things escalate? The original discussion was if he is helping at home or not, and neither of us have proof. But it’s a fact that his presence in more cases than not will be helpful for a sick mother. At least it would for most parents.
---
So I'm following a tailoring guide I got online to level it in the most efficient way.  I'm up to lvl 230, and it says to craft the Black Mageweave Headband, as it only uses two bolts of MW, however I don't have the pattern and neither does the Artisan Trainer.  I looked on the auction house but it's not on there either.  
---
Where can I find this pattern?
---
my friend cannot sell it for 150 on shazzrah eu. I keep telling him to hold on to it for later on.

&gt;4chan
---
Not all of 4chan is /pol/
---
I don't get it either. It doesn't affect you and you're just giving them the attention they want. Why do people care? 
---
Ninja'ing is happening all the time and don't let people tell you otherwise. Don't trust anyone.
---
This guy will almost certainly not be punished, worst that happens, is he gets kicked from the guild.
---
Faerlina lol

this mage should buy blink

I dinged on my way to hand in the last quest while discovering an area in winterspring. Messed up my screenshot
---
Then why do you have those emotes?
---
My guild was server first for full clear MC and Ony.
---
We pretty much have all spots closed except for more dps warriors lol.
---
That dude is probably pretty weird irl.
---
Binding Auto Shot to a key is highly recommended. You could also weave it into some macro if you wish.
---
While that doesn't sound like much fun, Im intrigued by the prospect of stealth runs. Perhaps its efficiency and the fun of it can outweigh the leather competition?
---
I don't want to see that message either...
---
Im not your guy, buddy!

what a looser guy lol.

Wanna meet him in real-life.. he will not stand a single discussion :D what a joke guy.

Just look at OPs post history.

Facial droop? No.

Unilateral loss of motor skills? No.

Generalized weakness? No.

Confusion? Yes. 
---
Talking to some oddly triggered dude online? Yeahh
---
Assessment: no stroke. Just perplexed as to why you’re still commenting here.
---
I spent a good amount of my life together with guildies and the whole internet trying to figure out how to acquire the non corrupted version of the Ashbringer in original classic if that does count.
---
Yeah but some people like the play style and skillset of warriors as a dps type class, but don't want the responsibility if headache of tanking. 
---
I honestly like tanking because I get to control the tempo of the group and I get antsy waiting around as DPS for a slower tank with less confidence. Not everybody enjoys the role, regardless if their class "could" do it.
---
There’s absolutely loads of videos on YouTube of him sorting this sort of thing out. I understand that your bias is going to influence the evidence you provide but try to be a little more logical and less emotional.

---
You're doing something very wrong, I'm afraid.  I'm 36 and I have 30 gold--and I've spent 6 gold on respecs and probably another 10-15 on the AH for various potions.  I do nothing outside of looting everything and selling popular things on the AH for a bit of profit.  The most expensive item I've sold on the AH was a BoE blue from a chest and that was 1g 50s.  But that's really it.  Otherwise, I just sell cloth and decent BoE greens.
---
its obvious in that clip he is being facetious and saying it seriously but doesnt actually mean it. Go watch old asmongold youtube vids of how to do big dick dps, its satire of what people think people like him are like.
---
Hmm any suggestions on class? I'd assume anything fast paced like Rogue would be rough.
---
I disagree.  pvp should always be as fair as possible.
---
DK are not given for killing low level players.
---
Yeah glad to hear that there's healers like you! I used to be really nervous about pulling while a healer was drinking because it seems like everyone here was complaining about not letting healers top off before charging in, but someone told me to not worry and go when they're around 70%. As i got better, it's even easier to assess how much time I need, and it just makes the runs go so smooth and efficient.
---
Maybe he's canadian. I'm not your friend, guy! I'm not your guy, buddy!
---
Which dungeons?
---
Yup. People snipe it instantly. So If you have a life/job you need to pay the premium. The pattern is going for 50g on AH. Big profit margin for the lucky one who snipes it
---
Many people dont go hamshit over pre raid bis because they need it to clear MC, but because in many cases upgrades are rare. HoJ for example will stay bis until p5. And even then you need to get the upgrade. Most players will wear the majority of their pre raid bis gear for a half a year easily.   
---
Personally I think this is just more reason to relax and take your time - but thats just me
---
&gt;if he is reported
---
Which won't happen because most likely his guild members don't wanna lose their membership and anger their lord Asmongold.
---
Stamina and spell damage for PvP.
---
If you were not in that group you would not have access to that chest either. Clearing up to that point was a group effort, and it spawned in that group's instance. When you're in a group you're expected to use your abilities and tools to forward the progression of the group, that generally includes opening locked chests and making some water because, you know, it's part of building a community and it is nice.
---
You also say a Mage doesn't have to make water, well, stand there and wait for the healer to spirit regen before a pull and try to explain why the pulls are going so slow and see who gets shouted at.
---
And you can't even begin to compare leveling LP to leveling Blacksmithing, one of the more painful and costly professions to level with crappy payoffs until 300/300.
---
I played Rogue all through TBC and as long as I opened some locked footlockers etc when I came across them while leveling and practiced on lockboxes from Pickpocketing (which gives you potions, reagents and gold BTW) it was super easy to level. You make it sound difficult and try to use that as justification for being greedy. Whenever I grouped we did a /roll on chests regardless of them being locked or not, and also picked Lockboxes for free unless someone came to me with 5-10 of them.
---
There are plenty of Rogues out there who are not greedy and selfish, I know which ones I'd invite to my groups. Finding a dungeon group as healer is generally pretty quick, not sure how it is for DPS.
---
Except it doesn't cuz demo was nerfed to fuck.
---
Ehh..there's a bit of real him in there. The living in filth and being a generally unhealthy goblin are legit him.
---
I would even say the "Ninja loot everything to get gear" is him as he has been saying this since before he was famous.
---
But all the other shit this sub says about him is pretty much just lies yeah
---
We are not bots... we just come by from time to time and try to snatch it for 5-10 minutes before moving on our way.
---
Is it shown anywhere in Vanilla or it's something only expanded in MoP ?
---
Please don’t self promote your stream here
---
How dumb can you be, losing respect and trust from long standing friends over a 1k gold mount. You can make 50gs an hour doing solo dungeons, it’s not like it’s hard.
---
Can anyone explain to me was ninja’d loot means?
---
Tanaris! Killing snapjaw turtles at the coast! Grinded there 1 level for my mount.
---
Depends what group lead decides. In groups I was in if there was more than one that can skin it then it's a roll who does that. There were no roll on the hide. It's less sought after than the carapace from Gyth too ;)
---
This doesn’t happen on ally side, in my exp. playing both sides. Hard if u wanna roll shaman tho..
---
Well don't worry, you will be back to what you are more familiar with in about 11 years
---
Elegantly put.
---
People like you are the reason why we have the shit loot system on retail. If you know that someone is ninja looting then dont group up with them. Easy as that. Posts like this are hurting WoW more now and for the future for yeeeears and more than actually someone looting an item which you'll get on the same day again.
---
Edit: And the daily witch hunting is as toxic, keep that in mind.
---
[Aaron Smith - Dancin (KRONO Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pm_KoguqPM)
---
DW. You can read about it on Wowhead and other sites but it’s just you tanking like normal but go deep fury instead. It’s recommended that you have some decent raid gear so like MC/Ony stuff before you try it though to build up your stam and armor since you are missing a shield.
---
You havent been with a good spellcleave group. And since they are quite hard to pull off and need some team-work, most might not be that good.
---
But when they are good, then they are really fucking good, nothing comes close.
---
I had a Cath spell-cleave where we averaged 80k XP/hour over 4 hours of runs, and a ZF Gy cleave where we ended up just shy at 70k xp/hr.
---
A good group of any kind get at best half of that. Cathedral is cleared in 9 minutes with a good spellcleave group for example.
---
But as you say, bad groups are fucking awful, so the difference between a good and a bad one is insane.
---
You’re right the other comments about ‘how shit this sub is’ are productive af🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I don't fuck your motherin know, fuck your mother man. It's all fuck your mothered up.
---
You can easily have more than that before you reach 60 just by doing quests and looting mobs.
---
Im not your buddy, friend!
---
thats fair but all the hate is getting obnoxious like i didn't even know who he was just saw ppl mention his name and bitch about him all the time and its getting stupid if your not on his server or dealing with him
---
Cath is done in 3 pulls generally, but yes, nothing comes even close to a clean spellcleave.
---
How can you only have 800 karma when this comment gave 760 and your account is 2 years old? You are really contributing huh?
---
In this case im pretty sure faction does not matter...
---
Le funny :))))))))))))
---
Gonna have to change where you can't need on items you can't use. I had someone ninja a much less expensive item. Honestly pug groups are just garbage now. Often someone leaves and you get constant downtime waiting for everyone.
---
See, on my server (bloodfang-eu) medium and thick leather are not AH material, as the profit is marginal (provided it does sell on the first auction). Thing is though, you can vendor them for 1s and 1.5s respectively. Now if you farm for a while, although it's not much, it definitely compliments the rest of the loot that you'd acquire.
---
Try, Hi can I get an inv pls?
---
And then the same guy will need on banthoc sash saying its an upgrade for him.
---
If you actually use the items it’s not ninja looting, that’s need before greed.
---
Make sure to jump over any you see. I've had gnome players whisper me Thier anger about it lol
---
I (paladin) was asked to tank a "spellcleave" group for a dungeon yesterday. Politely declined and said that I don't join spellcleave groups, as I don't enjoy that playstyle. They wondered what the hell was wrong with me. \*shrug\*
---
LMAO! “It's **a fact** that party leaders don't *mean jackshit in WoW!*”
---
Damn dude, you're digging that hole deeper and deeper just to die on this hill, haha please keep telling me how bad you are at the game!
---
Why nobody mentions that any gnome engi can make you these items?
---
Just ask someone in your guild or city to make you one of these, you can still use them.
---
The only thing you cant use is the port to tanaris (correct me if im wrong on this).
---
I don't know what is with people getting obssesed and upset over any thing that Asmongold and any other streamer does, you wanted a server without streamers, you have them, you wanted classic experience, you got it, but still people find a problem that they can bitch about...Enjoy the game, if somebody ninja loots then it's bad luck and that guy will get his punishment, it's not because he is some Asmon creep waiting to ruin your life. When you stop stressing about other people, you will enjoy the experience and fun of the game even more... And it would be nice if you can stop spamming asmon rants, that would be very nice.. And btw love you asmong, hello to youtube probably :)
---
I don't condone lying to a hybrid that wanted to dps.
---
But
---
"I'm not specced for that" isn't polite. It makes you sound like you don't know your class, or how the game works.
---
Dont forget the whole girlfriend he met online that cheated on him after he did all that to move her in different country
---
Gloves &gt; style points.
---
If the game actually punished aoeing every pull, they probably wouldn't do it, but mobs do fuck all damage and mages do so much aoe that it doesn't even matter. Literally no reason to not just go ham on the pulls
---
Repeatable Crab farming quest in shadow prey village is about 11g /hr iirc not much in the way of xp though
---
What do you expect from the talent tree?
---
Deep prot is not necessary because how the damage on shields is calculated. You lose way to much raid dps on single target bosses.
---
I would recommend you to watch some videos on youtube from Skarm Tank. He explains it pretty good
---
You from the server ragnaros? I swear I saw you last night in winterspring.
---
Cancel culture, censorship, and suppression never got anyone anywhere. Stop being such a fucking baby.
---
I agree that what that officer did was a shitty move, but this type of action is stupid.
---
I find just grinding 39 to 40 on any mob like this in STV or Badlands is perfect. You not only make enough money for your mount, but you will also have an abundance of quests ready to do since you skipped a whole level of them.
---
I am sorry I really confused you with OP.
---
It’s only efficient to dungeon if you have a great team that’s not going to wipe... grinding is probably just as good as questing on your own without any plugins to play the game for you. If not better. 
---
A dense area of mobs is always going to be faster then running on foot across the map to turn in a quest or two. Obviously quests that simply tell you to kill X amount are usually the best. So unless your a seasoned  wow player and know the best quest route 1-60 then I would def grind out that level or two when you come across that area with mass amount of mobs.
---
Or u know... plug in and let an Addon play the game for you. Layer? Idk what else the toxic people do.  Seems like the first 60 was invincible in some pulls he did so cheating like that would be nice too.
---
Farming gems in lbrs,first run i didn't masterloot but did put reserve gems in the ad 
---
Another guy needs it against me, i win anyway but it did sour me a bit on keeping it on group loot so the next 6 runs or so i master looted all gem bosses that i still needed. I really do not want to run that dung more than i absolutely need to just because some guy either can't read the LFG message or is trying to pull a naive oops i just clicked it by accident bullshit. 
---
I don't really reserve regular items personally but i can completely understand why people who do put it on masterloot for those bosses, they advertised for it and if you don't like it don't join(i don't)
---
Clearly he uses a healing potion (top right), that green effect is the shamans earth shock trying to finish him off.
---
If that is what people want to see here (with upvotes) then it have all rights to stay here as it is related to classic.
---
you should probably respec to arms. but if you wanna wait till 40 to do so, that's fine too. from my experience its simply stronger and being able to save 25 rage on stance swaps is too good. warrior is really rough to play before 40 because your only good abilities are overpower, whirlwind, and execute. two of which you cant use often
---
1. rend is not really worth using unless the target will live for the full duration of it. even then it feels quite weak but pre 40 it's probably worth it (if you get the full rend off)
---
2. use demo shout if ur tanking a dungeon right after u charge into a group. it gives a bit of aoe threat before u start to actually attack
---
3. I'll only use thunderclap again while tanking, and only when it's a nasty pull and u need every bit of survivability. otherwise it's not very useful considering how much rage it costs
---
4. sunder armor is mainly for tanking. it generates a lot of threat. for pulling groups, try to get 2-3 sunders on everything. for bosses keep 5 up. it doesn't actually do any damage so I wouldn't use it for questing at all.
---
 
---
5. afaik bloodcraze and /sit does not work in this version of classic
---
6. most of the time I use battle stance. the only time I use defensive stance is when I'm tanking and things are hurting/I need to taunt or sunder things for threat. also for disarm while questing in a sticky situation.
---
the only times I use berserker stance are when I'm (A) just dpsing a dungeon  or (B) for the use of whirlwind/berserker rage (especially for a sweeping strikes whirlwind)
---
you wont really need to worry about dumping rage if you go arms as you'll rarely get over 30 anyway. also use overpower as much as possible, it's an amazing ability
---
7. there is a "slam spec" for warrior but it's only for pure dps builds. it does not work for any content where a mob is meleeing you. I would just remove it from your bars completely because even if u spec into it, it's not that strong
---
8. pretty much never use heroic strike post 40. only use it if for some reason ur about to cap on rage. since it "eats" your next auto attack, you are not only spending rage on it, u are losing the rage you would've generated from a normal auto attack. pre 40 you can use it a bit, but really overpower, whirlwind. and execute are your best friends. when you hit 40 your pretty much just using mortal strike (or bloodthirst) on CD and mixing in some overpowers and executes when they are available
---
you probably have already discovered your own tricks but one nice one for arms... if you charge into 2 enemies and activate sweeping strikes&gt;whirlwind, the whirlwind will hit each enemy once,  but your sweeping strikes will hit the second target an additional time. it's a pretty nice "burst" of damage

Now you've used the same quote with two different words (*all* and *everyone* and you still haven't given a source. I take it that it's just your own words you are trying to make out to be factual? If you disagree, feel free to disclose the source. 
---
&gt; Better luck next time. Maybe if you write a longer essay it'll make more sense!
---
Why don't you start making sense for a change?
---
TLDR (since you seem to dislike reading anything more than a couple of lines): I gave a source for my definition. You are writing random things, presenting it as a quote, while you are changing words in the quote yourself.
---
&gt;You kids
---
do you want us to type our comments in big letters so that you don't need your reading glasses for them?
---
&gt;he was getting so much mail about it and started gkicking people for it
---
&gt;a couple of mails
---
Come on. He's an insanely popular streamer. It's much more likely that his mailbox was getting spammed, which is what I took the comment I replied to to be implying.
---
It's productive because he/she suggests an actual solution. 🌠
---
The guy asked for a link...
---
you reapplied when the 1 disappeared. the 1 disappears when you have 0.9 or less time left. the addon only counts in whole seconds. there is only 0 left on the timer when the debuff falls off the target and damage is applied. this is not a bug, just wait for it to tick before reapplying. you can see clearly you are popping a new one on RIGHT as the 1 fades, so its not over.
---
People need to learn how to not watch something they don't like.  It's a talent I learned when I was 5

You guys seem to be having fun downvoting me.  I am glad I could bring some joy to you on this glorious work day.

Sorry for the crappy screenshot.
---
Everyone in this group was from different guilds. Four of us have been running a lot of stuff together though. All good peps.
---
We did lava jump EMP run to save the princess, and got everyone attuned as well.
---
    Resto Druid 56
---
    Lock 57
---
    Feral Druid tank 55
---
    Fury War 57
---
    Mage 60
---
We wiped 4 or 5 times trying different strats.
---
We settled on Feral Druid tanking princess, we did not worry about not dmging her, just focused on keeping her attention, and Lock kept her mana drained so she couldn't heal. Everyone DPSed EMP while doing stair kite.
---
that profession bar thats 300x the normal bar size
---
I can't think of a reason

Finally someone takes a screenshot and this is what we get
---
Not Asmon. This stiff who ninjaed and bought the mount. He had like 300 followers or something. Now he has a bunch more I bet.

Your comments definitely read like someone attempting to cover anger with aloofness. If you actually didn't care you wouldn't have commented.

[higher rez](https://i.imgur.com/9O2XwWL.png), not sure if it's better

Yeah a guy did this to a friend and were like 35 ppl from the same village and play both factions on a pvp server. He lost around 2h of playtime this saturday by getting ganked by us.
---
I saved her as a Bear tank at 54, so I win.
---
Happened on my server when a binding dropped in a PUG MC where bindings weren't reserved. Master looter gave it to a 58 rogue while a warrior rolled a 100. He was banned for one day and binding was given to the warrior.
---
Horde only?
---
Tbf it matters in retail too, just to a MUCH lesser extent.
---
My group did the hallway as a pull because someone was always rebuffing or conjuring water or taking a piss or something dumb and then the two courtyards as three total pull because we were real bad at handling the mages for whatever reason, but 3 seems totally doable.
---
LOL still can't admit that you're wrong about “all” not having to include the speaker. Damn, go back to school cuz english is not your strong point.
---
Post clip please.
---
I'm guessing you're still leveling up.
---
In this case, Spirit is king because it reduces downtime between fights. Then it's Intellect for the larger manapool and Stamina for larger healthpool.
---
The armor will take care of itself once you find good pieces in mail.
---
&gt;Related, what weapons should I equip? 2h staff or 1h mace with orb? 
---
In general, the Staff vs 1H+off hand debate for caster is do I want more Int/Stamina or more Spell damage.
---
Honestly it depends on what activity you're doing. Like in a dungeon you can keep what gives you more intellect for clearing and swap for spell damage for the Boss. If you're doing PvP you might want to keep something with high Stamina. I'd say just keep your options open and 2 or 3 sets of weapons that you upgrade individually.
---
[This](http://wowpop.appspot.com/) will give you a rough estimation of where you sit, you are most likely ahead of the curve.
---
Yeah same thing was done in Eye of Azshara to skip to the third boss up a cliff
---
The annoying streamers all play alliance. Faerlina's Horde is all about griefing those streamers.
---
With skinning presumably?
---
Jesus that's a lot. How many times did you lose a need roll on it? Yeh I'm the same as you. You get the omniboots?
---
hahahah my addon tells me there are 53 min left this cant be true \^\^
---
What is the name of the addon that lists the various stats at the top?
---
I got 4 belts in a row today... 3 of them were vendored
---
That made it so much worse somehow
---
I've levelled all the way as prot, currently level 50.
---
It's very viable, and in my opinion paladins make better dungeon tanks than warriors.  
---
Warriors need time to get rage to get aggro, paladins can get a lot of threat fast, including AoE.
---
The only downside is mana problems, but you should be getting int / stamina items, strength isn't required, but it does help.
---
Another tip is that spirit is your friend: Go in, judge righteousness on the skull target, drop a consecration, reseal righteousness and just auto attack for the rest of the pack allowing spirit to regenerate your mana.
---
Another strat is to judge wisdom, seal wisdom again and spam consecration, but it lacks early threat for your melee group.
---
I agree with this. People are so dedicated to getting through the dungeon as fast as possible with little to no mistakes. Of course this is the goal, and it is exciting to run a flawless dungeon, but like you said, its the crazy mistakes and total wipes that can make for the best memories. Leeroy Jenkins didn't become a thing from the raid going well but its a hilarious memory of the game that even non-players know. People need to understand that WoW Classic isn't long enough too rush through as fast as possible and sometimes messing up and laughing about it is the best part of this game.
---
Is it just me or do mages seem a bit dim

Does anyone else think mages are the new hunters

Am I the only one that doesn't like spellcleave groups?

Can we ban ts instead for this garbage fucking post?

Leffen has a lot more genuine fans on that sub, maybe back during the evidence.zip days it was comparable, but not now, at worst the sub is split 50/50 on him, and probably not even that. HBox is much more hated, but he's not saying a ton of controversial shit that people can reap karma off of.
---
Sell your boe greens on the ah. Dont vendor them unless the really wont sell

Yea, but realistically people who think being a racist/homophobic/transphobic/etc shitbag is funny probably haven't grown up much in 15 years and probably still think it's funny.

The problem isn't that they're edgy memelords. The problem is that they really do feel that way at least a bit but it's fine if they're "just joking" and YOU'RE the one with the REAL problem because you won't "lighten up". 
---
A lot of people seem shocked to find out that a lot of gamer culture \*IS\* that shitty. Pretending like it's just a few shitposting kids giving everyone a bad name are unwittingly running cover for them.

If Blizzard hasn't done anything about this guy yet, they never will. Classic is an unregulated shithole, and that's what the people wanted.

Because he's entertaining, at least to me. Same reason I watch Alex Jones and Darksysephil.

That was also probably sarcasm as the guy is sarcastic as fuck... that's what this sub also fails to realise..
---
I'm a lot like you, except I'll definitely seek revenge if killed. Can probably count on one hand how many times I've killed someone for competing for the same mobs, it depends how rushed for time I am.

Since ninja looting is against the TOS, why hasn't blizzard banned him for a period of time yet since his also admitted it wasn't a mistake?

On Lucifron (EU) people are selling alchemy 1-300 kits for 200g.
---
Just wait until he gets banned and starts crying. You will see his real personality there. Just a crier loser.
---
It also includes abilities that you ARE using if upgrading them doesn't give you much benefit. There isn't a whole lot of reason to rank up stuff like gouge or kick when all ranking up does is increase their damage by 6 or whatever.
---
Go and do it. Fire is sooo much fun
---
To be fair, Asmon seems just has much as a douche as this guy. Probably fit together perfectly.
---
Someone please hack his account, vendor everything leaving his character naked. Then pass out the gold made from all the vendored items to random players around the server like a true Robin Hood. XD
---
Oh damn, yah he wins.
---
Hos mad.
---
not really an issue if you wanted to aoe it all
---
Yeah let's make them take up 25% of the screen.
---
LOL you think party leaders shouldn't be listened to. You already excused yourself from the discussion by saying something *that* stupid.
---
Now I'm just letting you get all this anger out. You are so mad!
---
&gt; Damn dude, you're digging that hole deeper and deeper just to die on this hill, haha please keep telling me how bad you are at the game!
---
You still haven't come forth with a single argument. Quite an accomplishment actually.
---
Depends on the zone but yes many are like this. That’s why it’s actually not a bad idea to grind a few levels. Most people just don’t have the patience, resulting in hours of time wasted running around searching.
---
I am sure some have already said this, but you should never vendor 
---
Wicked Claws.
---
Also the Dark Whelplings will be worth 100g or more in a few months
---
Sunder armor is almost always in the ST leveling rotation. Your advice to not use it is wrong. Here is the leveling rotation from Fight Club, which is the most trustworthy resource for learning warrior. 
---
|   4-19  | Rend &gt; HS                     
---
|  20-21  | Rend &gt; SA until 70% HP &gt; HS   
---
|  22-25  | Rend &gt; SA until 50% HP &gt; HS   
---
|  26-35  | Rend &gt; SA until 50% HP &gt; HmS 
---
|  36-39  | SA until 85% HP &gt; WW         
---
|  40-45  | MS &gt; WW                       
---
|  46-57  | SA until 80% &gt; MS &gt; WW    
---
|  58-60  | SA until 55% &gt; MS &gt; WW       
---
If this seems unintuitive I get that, but check the DPR values in a spreadsheet and you’ll see it’s generally correct (your specific gear may change things slightly).
---
I played 1st time around and tbh, it’s no we’re near as good as bad then. The community just isn’t there anymore
---
Sorry your brainy small, look I can't stand Asmongold or any or his fans or cohorts, but a petition to ban is stupid...it is almost always stupid and works against its intention
---
Dustwallow marsh is the somewhat identical for lvl 36-40 I think. Kill the crocolisks and any beasts, vendor/skin for a few hours.
---
That's what I would do.
---
That's not what I said.
---
Chill winston. It’s there now yeeesh.
---
I saw a video of him getting completely mad at losing one of his mount offs and blaming his friends for him not having some mounts because they didn't farm with him or motivate him to farm or something but he legitimately looked mad when someone beat him.
---
Or the time he literally slammed his head into the desk when he got launched off a platform during one of the mage tower trials I think it was.
---
I see. So you’re filled with rage right now too? Because you know, otherwise you wouldn’t have commented?
---
Heh people are weird sometimes. Recently got ignored by someone who got offended by a simple suggestion, then got him in a dungeon group and didn't notice it until halfway through, was kinda awkward.
---
That is very smart idea, lets remove people just because we don't like them, because fuck them...very healthy way of thinking and living... Hahha holy shit, is this for real, you have to be Asmon fanboy, just came here to troll people
---
LOL he doesn't understand examples everyone! Poor thing. All of this is just going over your head so hard isn't it ;__;
---
That was a complaint of looting from other members of Asmon's mega-guild. He's fine with his people ninjaing others but he's not OK with anyone stealing items that belong to his people. It's not good for the cohesion of what he has going. 
---
As someone who hatewatches him, he is toxic. But he's also pretty funny and it's a game. If you are on Faerlina and you don't know what &lt;Olympus Whatever&gt; means by now, that's on you.
---
who the hell watches this guy  
---
that dumb look on his face is just unbearable  
---
no personality no wit no originality  
---
the fuck is this :D
---
Yeah. I forked over some good gold for runecloth bags in my early twenties, because those would pay back for themselves well before level 40 just in terms of how much additional loot I can bring back.
---
I have to kinda disagree with 5 as I lvled with tailoring and enchanting, I worked on enchanting a little bit not that much but tailoring works out better making the gear from the cloth/wool/silk and vendoring it for money or selling on AH than selling the raw mats on AH least that was for my server
---
“Party leaders don't mean shit in WoW” 
---
That alone ensures no one will ever take you seriously LMAO
---
Considering the mod team is also consisted of streamers, who are also friends of Asmongold, there ain't no way this would even happen in the first place.
---
Hi, Fairbanks. You're a bitch. :)
---
he also ninjad his hair and teeth back
---
&gt;Classic(all of it) is a shithole
---
Why?  Because one server has a bunch of trash people on it?  How do you insinuate everyone who plays this game is trash person and then game is trash, based off one server?
---
haha love it
---
Opposite side of this, people who aren't pulling multiple mobs and AOE'ing things down is sometimes an extremely boring and waste of an experience. 
---
I did a ZF run. everyone was atleast 48, had a 50 and a 51. Sounds great right? No, it was one of the slowest runs I've ever done. 
---
If you are much higher level then the mobs, you don't need a shield. If you didn't get lucky and get a Ravager, go grind and get a ravager. 
---
I did more damage then my entire team combined in a fight because they are using single target attacks barely even doing more damage then i did in the same single target fight.  
---
First 3 times in a dungeon, yeah its fun, explorative, funny and a good lesson to have.  If you are on your 20th run and 5 levels higher then when you started the dungeon, just murder everything.
---
Held so accountable.  You click his video, and then downvote it, thus earning him more money and notoriety.
---
&gt;This is what’s known as the retail WoW mentality.
---
Naah. People that played in private servers got used to WAY harder hitting elites, playing there for years. When classic came, we noticed that not only the instances were super easy, they gave extra XP over what we were used to.
---
Hence the cleave meta was born. It was perfected by private server players, streamed, made into you tube vids and other more progression oriented ppl picked it up. And when it was shown to everyone, ppl wanted to copy the fast and easy way of levelup.
---
I havent seen ANYONE get rejected because of gear, from anything. So thats not whats happening here.
---
Yeah thats actually how I work. I write it out with the intent to reply and then think "is this worth it", most of the time I decide its not.  
---
Goodluck in your future post/comments!
---
That depends on your server. Check comparable items and see.
---
Alright, then we should expect this officer to be dealt with in short order and other ninja looters booted as soon as there's corroborating evidence.
---
I'll eagerly await to see if that's the case.
---
For all those quick trigger moments you need to open your professions at the drop of a hat haha
---
Anybody who he ninja looted can open a ticket about it. There was a post yesterday with enough evidence to revert money and temp ban him. That's just one offense.
---
&gt; LOL still can't admit that you're wrong about “all” not having to include the speaker.
---
Feel free to believe whatever you feel like you want to believe. If you want to believe in a flying spaghetti monster I couldn't care less. 
---
But since you seem *so* determined to not provide *any* actual arguments, I'm just going to assume you realized you were making baseless accusations that you couldn't support.
---
Bottoms up.
---
I hope you're a dwarf.
---
Yes, you would have agreed to the loot rules the moment you joined the group.
---
Fuck your mother motherfucker, exactly, why do these people, fuck their mother, get offended so motherfucking easily.
---
Put them on ignore. You'll never group with them again.
---
if flame sacs are 70s, that means the small fire protection potions are ALSO much more expensive....  because those are the ONLY reason small flame sacs hold any value .  So you would sell the potions for 1g each.
---
The potions are the budget option, because the great fire protection potion is 5g on that server
---
Not enough rage.
---
I cant do that yet.
---
Took me 30 levels to turn that shit off.
---
where'd he go?
---
I see a doggo's surprise after the bed sheet trick.
---
So not shedding like on how toxic and horrible of a human him and his guild members are is now a bad thing and should be censored?
---
I am in OCE but was looking for an approx. What item would be comparable?
---
Bought it from the Auction House.. only 45 gold.. :)
---
If you have any reading ability at all I dissuade him from rolling mage in my first post, and explain why in the post you replied to and obviously did not understand.
---
Just wow.
---
META
---
&gt;I table that we ban **any content related to** or condoning ninja looting.
---
Soo if i tell the sub that you ninjalooted i get banned ?
---
Nice try asmagold
---
No one cares about these looser streamers.
---
So how exactly is having a paladin tank on alliance side a problem for your troll mage?
---
Holy crap his pc sucks.
---
that UI is eye cancer
---
For leveling, spirit by a mile. At 60, spirit is worthless (except for solo grinding if you still have spirit tap).
---
No, just a stupid looking meat man who can’t even afford a proper neck and wrists.
---
It doesn't matter for low level content. But if you want a tanky pet you're better off with Bat, Owl or Carrion Bird, since they all have screech.
---
I think he tried to imitate Asmongold who constantly goes on this "larger than life" tirades before any purchase/craft/roll, but unlike Asmongold, this guy is not a good entertainer and does not have the personality to make it somewhat funny, so it just comes out as kind of sad.
---
Level 52 and in my guild I'm 4th place. 
---
Relax &amp; enjoy.
---
I just wish we would see a hooded figure walk up from behind with a sword and slash that ugly goblin face from chin to ear. In game of course. Fuck this guy.
---
This is so sad, alexa play despacito
---
I did this yesterday and can confirm it works without any problems. To be clear, this is what I did:
---
* I was a 240 gnomish engineer, dropped engineering completely
---
* Deleted my gnomish membership card
---
* Releveled engineering to 200
---
* Went to Tanaris and read the book. The book gave me 2 options (it said something like):
---
   * "I'm 100% sure I want to become a goblin engineer"
---
   * "I'm 100% sure I want to become a gnomish engineer"
---
* I chose goblin and was then able to buy goblin recepies
---
&gt; still can't admit that you're wrong about “all” not having to include the speaker.
---
Look at Mr. Badass over here.
---
Whats even more hilarious is watching people like you cry about it. 
---
This sub is for people who enjoy pixels on a screen, those pixels on a screen require you to put a lot of time and effort into making them better pixels on a screen, when these people see other people cheat the system and act dishonestly with their pixels on a screen it upsets them... big surprise there. 
---
But hey, there are plenty of unimportant things people get upset over in the world. Hopefully we'll see you comment something similar in the sports and movies/TV subreddits ;)
---
Thrash blade and vanquisher's sword
---
Wow i didnt realise this was how hunter pet skills work, actually makes me really want to play a hunter :D
---
Never said you were "filled with rage" I said you were whiny, which you are. Whiny people don't tend to be level headed. And I commenting on this because I disagree with you and find the perception of PvP servers important. People should know it's okay to be upset when you get ganked. You aren't playing PvP wrong if you are there for the occasional PvP without wanting to spend an entire day being corpse camped. I do care, that's why I commented.
---
Your repeated and increasingly aggressive reassertions that you are not mad do lead me to believe you are likely indeed, pretty mad, however.
---
What activity are you doing? During lvl up Spirit, at max level Intellect.
---
What a terrible use of gold. A non bis item for 1k gold worth of mats that could have been sold yuck
---
&gt;Horrigan on urban dictionary
---
Are user-submitted Urban Dictionary definitions deemed "good enough" evidence to ban someone?
---
We probably will. He kicked others for ninja looting last week, so this one with video evidence I am sure will be dealt with. Also pretty sure hes at twitch con atm so that's why there has been no action as of yet..
---
Those models are awesome.
---
Was doing the UBRS key quest with two other alliance and a whole bunch of horde walked into the cave looking like that.
---
PvP ensued and the casting animations were hilarious to see
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE
---
leave it how it is. downvote if you dont like the posts.
---
It's kind of funny how that mage is so bad and still almost got you killed with just a few instant spells. :D
---
Yeah I don’t see what’s difficult here.. give every the same options, done. That’s called equality.
---
Give me my name!
---
&gt; LOL you think party leaders shouldn't be listened to.
---
That's a lie, I never wrote that. 
---
&gt; You already excused yourself from the discussion by saying something that stupid.
---
You've already excused yourself from the discussion. And now you've lied in an attempt to help your own narrative. 
---
&gt; Now I'm just letting you get all this anger out. You are so mad!
---
I assume you are speaking to your mirror here? Otherwise it doesn't make sense.
---
Oh most certainly. Think I had 500-600 or so when I dinged 60
---
Hi,
---
Talking as a hunter that had 94g when I he dinged 40.
---
I farmed stranglethorn tigress + shadowmaw panthers (they where in the same area) and skinned them. Their grey items sell for 6-7s a piece. They drop tiger meat. If you have the jungle stew recipe, you can craft 6s worth of food for 90s worth of ingredients (tiger meat + water + 2 apples). Skinning them yields heavy leather, shadowcat hide (panthers only) and thick leather (goes for 6s a piece on my server).
---
This was one method. The other is to fish in lv 35+ areas. Fish the wreckages and all schools of fish. You will find iron bound trunks and mithril bound trunks. They contain leathers, potions and cloth bolts (silk, magewave, runecloth) which vendor nicely. My preferred spot is in STV along the coast. North of GromGol you get iron trunks, while south you get mithril. There are also some spots in feralas and maybe tanaris that I can recommend.
---
Good luck!
---
He's already successful, but if people cared about his daily drama updates, they'd go to the subreddit for it
---
Ninja looting is not only when the leader changes the rules to masterloot. Ninja is also when someone rolls need on an item that he doesn't need, just to sell it or whatever. 
---
And you agree you don't like these people and you won't join them, yeah.
---
I suggest looking for your own ways to level professions instead of following guides, as they usually disregard the sale value of crafted items. Why make tons of white gear that you end up vendoring, when you can craft bags or greens that can be sold or disenchanted? I leveled tailoring crafting bags most of the way and it barely cost me anything all the way to 300.
---
I agree, this guy needs to be muted for betraying Vanilla.
---
I'm gonna have to disagree, in a PUG.. the amount of times you've run the dungeon doesn't entitle you to an item any more than anyone else... You aren't buying the item with run counts
---
They take up an inventory slot.
---
Are you using addons?
---
Yes, please. I come for classic wow content, not for streamer content or bullshit. Doesn't he have a sub? Then maybe fuck off with him there.
---
Playing Mage is exactly the same. You drink just as much as you describe, the only difference is that you create your own water.
---
Literal fucking loser
---
Ah so the mods will remove my discussion posts but this one can stay up?? Get it together r/classicwow
---
Played a mage since vanilla, got my mage to 60.
---
Now I’m levelling a warlock instead, because why even bother at this point?
---
The blisses of close mindedness.
---
He quite literally says “if you need, need. Otherwise greed or pass. It’s that simple” but fair point that is between guildies. 
---
There are however a plethora of other videos where he solves these problems with people not in his guild. Via in game mail none the less 😂
---
I guess we should operate under the guilty until proven innocent though right?
---
If you ban it, it will have even less visibility. Stuff like this should be brought to the front page for transparency.
---
Well AOE is to vague of a discription, spellcleave is nothing more than a new name for a new setup. There is nothing weird about it.
---
He cares to much about it indeed.
---
25g is really cheap, most realms they will be 60-80 already and in the future they will be much more expensive..
---
exotic pets are a great investment if you have some spare gold 
---
3 dragonlings, ooze and hyacinth macaw
---
Who cares.
---
Count me in!!
---
Then brush it off and move on, don’t cry about it. I addressed OPs question and gave an answer no one else did since most people try to min/max and use what ever Addon/ exploit they can too help them level faster. Most people refuse to just sit there and grind cause they just can’t enjoy the game like that and feel a huge need to go questing/dungeon runs. I don’t understand how this has nothing to do with information on grinding/ questing. Don’t get butt hurt cause someone called u out. (U called ur self out)
---
Hey hey hey...he lives in an attic, he still lives with his parents and is most likely a virgin...but he's not in the basement.
---
I've been feared through the walls into SM, into the instance, where I then pulled mobs, ended the fear stuck in a corner so I couldn't move at all while they killed me and my group. Warlock fear is busted.
---
You yourself said so many people are starting that asmongold is a shitty person. Go find out yourself and stop being a lazy fuck
---
Good god....
---
I did 258 lava runs for ironfoe on pserver, never seen it drop. I’m happy with it being redundant this time around
---
Yea man Seal twisting is gonna beat out some hunters, rogues, mages and warriors. Sounds like you're blissfully ignorant. That or you've got some noobs in your raid group.
---
Thank you, kind sir!
---
This helps a ton, thanks
---
Sure, have the last word buddy. I don't care as much as you think.
---
Healing priests are very easy targets in BGs and are outclassed by Paladins in about every way possible, aside from fear ward if dwarf. On horde side, they're the only ones with defensive magic dispel so they're irreplaceable.
---
Since beta in 2004?
---
I say you just get the fuck over yourself and move on with your life. What a sad person
---
In that case I apologize for judging you because you are clearly a honorable person :)
---
If they needed that dps.. that dps has equal grounds for loot, in a PUG.
---
Stop being right?
---
No thank you.
---
Honestly, they should just enable this as a baseline feature. It feels like failed game design and there is no benefit to not being able to see your mana whilst in form, *especially* as feral druid is such a mana intensive class. It feels as though it was purely a limitation of the engine at the time. Classic “purists” probably wouldn’t even notice were Activision-Blizzard to implement this change, as it seems like just flat out common sense.
---
To be honest, your mentality is what need fixing. The game has always been about more than just beating whatever raid content is there and ESPECIALLY in Classic, it's VERY Horde vs. Alliance. You grind (reps, mobs, dungeons, raids) to improve in your mission to beat the other faction. Raids and dungeons are means to an end, they need to be sort of conquerable. That's also why the main difficuly in raiding in Classic is attuning. Opening up for Naxx is harder than the raid.
---
Thank you, but please see edit 1 above. I know combat is very strong, but I’m trying to think long term, at least I hope lol
---
Tanked monestary library and weapons chamber yesterday with one such group. In the library they just constantly reminded me to pull more. At one point one asked the other how the time was and the guy replied with "22 minutes in" to which the other guy replied with: "we have to be 2 minutes faster".
---
At this point I ignored it and just went on since what I needed was weapons chamber and I did library just for them. But in weapons chamber the same thing happened some time in. Like "How's the time?", "We're fast, it's good". And that's when I asked them why the time mattered this much to them. They basically said if they are a little slower, questing and grinding outside will be more efficient for leveling. Told them I'm not up for another run since that's way too stressful for me to enjoy it. But damn this run, even though efficient, was a pain in the ass.
---
Or the mage gets bored and decides to pull the entire room rather than the two pack you pulled.  
---
They die, get upset at the tank for not tanking and the healer for not healing.  
---
Raise.   
---
Repeat.
---
I've played every day since release and just got to 37. If you've got a 60 and a 31 you're definitively on the way to being a speed leveler, relative to most players anyway.
---
Its indeed the "streamers bad, here is drama" people that upvote it. The amound of fanboys is little here.
---
People care way to much about him.
---
They should be discarded but haven’t been? Strange.
---
Thank for your service to society you may now return to your lessons for today.
---
Arenas maybe, AoE has been used to describe the actions you mentioned in PVE since vanilla up to now. So the term already exists for it.
---
And your last phrase is basically the same as mine.
---
&gt;Just accept its a term that got popular, mainly due to Twitch that basically means the same as AoE did.
---
lionheart helm is not a blue, but an epic, that is BiS for dps warrior for a loooooooooong time.  any serious raider will want it eventually
---
Makes me wanna punch him so hard. xD
---
Guess why people run spellcleaves to skip through the time you need to clear.
---
Even if its just like 10% faster (usually way more than that) you safe like half an hour or so...
---
Voidform still adds tentacles
---
Not everyone's effort is equal, nor is everyone's value to the party.
---
Why are you posting a lore video that takes place post cataclysm(and all the lore changes it brings to zones) to a subreddit where the only lore that matters is the explicit classic lore?
---
I'll fuck you up!
---
Congratulations! ... Not everyone can feel normal :p
---
400 runs for the BRD arena chest, me and my friend vendored at least 10 caster belts by now, still haven’t seen the chest though
---
Yes thats my concern even if i hit 60with my warrior whic will not happen like untill xmash cuz i like to enjoy the game at my limited time so i wonder i can just make a charater hit 39 meanwhile farm the items that i can ans just grind my main slowly to 60.  All in all its not a rush for me but personally like pvping even im not a god pvp player. I can enjoy the lower lvl pvp also 29/39😀
---
They sell for 25g+ on my server. I made around 100g on them with less than an hour farming.
---
No, I think the person who made the character, the person who keeps playing the character, is a twat. You're not absolved of responsibility just because you claim to be playing a character, although I urge you to try it out among friends and family. If your findings are good, perhaps try it out with the law.
---
Hey, any news about the Astral/Magic Essence thing?
---
Having the same problem here. Couldnt find any info about this on the web.
---
Also tried to find some info if Enchanting skill matters for the DE yields. 
---
Using DE lvl 5 alt, I haven't gotten a single Astral Essence yet.
---
Separate servers for other expansions? Don't think there's a single person out there that would say no
---
If you don't watch the streams why even argue? And even if he got A LOT of mails deleting them is easier than reading through it, and messaging the ninja looter and mail sender what exactly happened and trying to sort things out.
---
Haha, fingers crossed.
---
Well me and my GF kept being attacked by 5 levels higher warrior and shadowpriest. we were 37 they were 42. Funny thing they died every single time but made the leveling really painful as we had to watch out for them non stop.
---
This is filmed in retail. This isnt really a classic lore video.
---
You're really clinging to the kid thing. I'll do a survey of my classroom and find out how many people watch streams. I predict 100 percent, which is probably why you've got a weird complex about this.
---
Can you give examples?
---
Back in early Wrath my girlfriend farmed this little fellow and gave it to me on Valentine's day. Am I weird for thinking it's the best gift I ever got?
---
Go back to retail lol
---
What?  The bags barely sell for more than the mats vendor for.
---
1. Charge
---
2. Blood rage and battle shout (no gcd on br) 
---
3. Rend,
---
4. I like to stack rage so HS 70+ rage, else sunder till 3 stacks
---
5. Hamstring and rerend if they're runners at 20%
---
6. Exe if it's named, or you want a rage dump
---
He's also said that you should stand in the fire to up your DPS, given clear instructions on how to flex your damage meter and what excuses to use if you're not #1 and other things. All as jokes, that is.
---
Don't play with them. Problem solved.
---
Macro your first spell with /startattack
---
I do it with Hunters Mark
---
If you're wearing a shield, where does the additional threat come from? Is Bloodthirst that good?
---
This is the same attitude I’ve had over the years from raid leading and being a GM.  Refreshing to find others.
---
&gt;  Leveling to me was also a huge part of the content. Rather than doing the aoe farms I just did the dungeons normally as I hadn’t done much of them in years and years.
---
Isn't that pve?
---
Ill have you know i was raised by the Raventusks, master fishermen of the Hinterlands. I consulted with the elder and we can confirm that this is some low quality bait
---
Thought it was my warrior for a sec lol
---
And what community is that?
---
The community of which 10% if not less have set foot in a raid in vanilla, 15 years ago and have since repeated the same ignorant rethoric they've heard others say for years and years?
---
Meanwhile most, if not every single private server raid guild since 2007 have been very clear about druids and their usefulness in comparison to that of warriors'
---
I'm sorry, but I don't care about the community that is Kyle and friends, whose raid experience is limited to something they heard from someone else's friend 15 years ago
---
Yup. At this point this sub is nothing but a huge circlejerk.
---
Well right now he is proven guilty. You have yet to show otherwise. We have one of his guild admins openly ninja loot and bragging about and trying to make a twitch career off being a fuck face and we have video of asmon saying "don't do it to guildies, but do it to everyone else. In fact do it and you'll get promoted"
---
I'm not your chum, friend!
---
Just keep in mind that classic doesn't have a lot of gear catchup mechanics. If you skip BWL and AQ40 you won't be able to just jump into Naxx when it comes out. An upside to the ease of content is the prevalence of pugging. You'll be able to stay relevantly geared with just a random pug each week. BWL is harder than MC but still pretty easy, so pugs will e clearing it too, and BWL gear should get you into Naxx groups when the time comes.

What do you plan on doing? For lvl 60 dungeons people will *always* want tanks, so warrior is the obvious choice here. You can tank regardless of spec so no worries if you prefer playing arms/fury. As a healer, it's actually hard to find dungeon groups at 60, at least for dungeons that drop good healer loot (though this might vary from server to server).
---
For raids, you only need 2-3 tanks out of 40 people so tank spots are usually the first ones to fill, while healers are much more desired. Though with priests being the most popular healing class, your class pieces will be more contested, while tanks usually get geared the fastest.
---
It's called _Robe_, not _Dress_, you uncultured swine.
---
On leveling Dungeons we ninja all weapons for train weaponskill.
---
Sweet vendor money paid for mounts.
---
Something else that would be productive would be to read the room, and obviously know hes cynical most of the time, hes bullshitting in that clip. He jokes around like that pretty often. You just dislike him, so you try to find all the negative stuff about him, he doesn't promote ninja looting.
---
And don't forget: fuck everyone who dares to play mage
---
lolo and what is gonnna happen to him? he's an officer in a guild that's makes up half the Alliance. he has all the people he needs in that
---
You probably meant to hit Reply on some other comment.
---
Surely if you’re in the class it can’t be 100% 🤔
---
As someone said in another comment. We are on the 1.12 patch which is like the "catchup" patch for classic. Players have access to much better tuned gear for all classes, all the dungeon nerfs, and all the talent tree/skills buffs. Meanwhile, leveling dungeons were not re-tuned to match the original 1.0 difficulty. So most DPS can tank bosses with heal spam on them and never suffer the consequences. At 60 I too hope this changes (I remember bosses 2 shotting clothies), but its unlikely to be true.
---
I know for sure that TBC heroic dungeons, even warlocks (clothies with tons of stam) get 2-shotted by trash mobs if they get threat.
---
That’s not how I experienced it. I won the mammoth mount from open roll back in the day and the raid leader ninja looted it. Contacted a GM and they said “you didn’t use the in game loot rules correctly, too bad so sad.”
---
So quick question, if i remember correctly, back in burning crusade era WoW, anyone from any class could roll need on all loot. So why did the rule “all greed” exist when logically it’d make more sense to do “all need”? It’s the same thing except you cant get sniped.
---
4k? Definitely more than that at this point
---
Because he's a strung out, mentally ill subhuman who is carried primarily by Steven Ogg's performance?
---
I also suggest to do some of the last Loch modan Quests you can get without it being a follow quests and maybe the first few in the wetlands and then just cycle through red ridge, duskwood and wetlands again and again so the quests are never too high for you with lvl 20 and especially +lvl30 one questing area isn't enough anymore and you need to circle through 2-3 areas because they just aren't enough quests.
---
Running some Dungeons also helps a lot.
---
(((goblins)))
---
Yeah absolutely, same with any node in the open world... flowers, chests... One time I was going for a node, but a mob spawned, aggroed with 0.5s to go, start fighting it, then here comes a player of the same faction who starts to steal it, whilst I'm literally touching it with my character's model... then another mob spawns and aggroes on them, I kill my mob and take the node. 
---
Sweet justice.
---
No, you don't need a pet to do that, the rest of your compatriots do that them selves. Then blame tank healer cos their kiting skill aren't as good as they thought
---
It’s beyond me how you people care this much
---
I DON'T LIKE 'EM PUTTIN POTIONS IN THE WATER THAT TURN THE FREAKIN' TROGGS GAY
---
They have to just do battle grounds, get high levels to get the runs done early, eg level ten deadmines.
---
Now do the blue dragonkin in winterspring. I wanna see the Sinew stats, because frankly, I dont think it exists
---
That's not too bad. Each Scalding whelp earn one use of my reincarnation back.
---
I remember master looters giving out items due to fake rolls like this in vanilla. Fake rolls ended up being banned in my guils because of it.
---
Sounds like you invested time into him and he let you down, but that's subjective. 
---
Folk need to stop putting so much stock into streamers including joining any conversation about them, even after they've stated they don't like the guy... This thread being a prime example.
---
It requires more skill to pull off aoe groups than to run it normally. Besides, endgame in classic is laughably easy anyway. Odds are you just aren't on the same page.
---
There wasnt a Beta Test.
---
There was a Promotion Beta.
---
Its diffrent nowadays.
---
Mobs gets early access to BC content.

Love Duskwood, amazing concept.

Lionheart helm will never drive the price of wicked claws. Even if a thousand warrios wanted it at the same time, the arcanite and diamonds will always be the limiting supply, and the ones that drive the price of the helmet. Compared to those the wicked claws available are practically infinite, and will thus never see a significant increase in price from the demand created by the helmet alone.
---
Wow flame sacs are expensive on your server o.O only 15s on mine
---
Troll post.
---
There are actually people who go to subreddits dedicated to a fucking singular streamer.
---
To a fucking singular streamer like asmongoloid.
---
Wow. Just fucking wow.
---
The people in this thread are legitimately retarded, it's honestly fucking sad mate.
---
I commented the same thing and got 25 downvotes.
---
I made a [custom UI](https://i.imgur.com/ASnuwyT.png) for them, LOL.
---
I don't see the reason why the streamer himself is mentioned in every single thing his guildmates are doing. That's stupid.
---
Even if the guy is a douche, no need to bring him up in every single thing that is somewhat related to him. Like, he's not even involved in any part of the whole mess right here, but i see his name all the time. Bleh. Just name it after who's doing that shit and blacklist him.
---
Its a lot more work on my mana pool as a healer.
---
They sell because the recipe is used in most if not all tailoring guides. And I guess people just like making their own bags.
---
yes, the best gift is (or was)  having a girlfriend like that, are you still together?
---
&gt; You're not absolved of responsibility just because you were playing a character
---
Your not? So if any actors do anything Illegal in a movie they should be found guilty of it in real life?
---
&gt;although I urge you to try it out among friends and family. If your findings are good, perhaps try it out with the law.
---
Why would I do that? Why are you comparing someone acting as a character as a form of entertainment on a stream to making up and being a character in every day life? 
---
I thought you would maybe have had a decent discussion about this from your first post but you have went straight back to making weird reaches...?
---
No it actually is, it goes over being "scummy" , what he did was actual scamming, which is against blizz's rules, ppl have been punished for this before.
---
AoE rubs really do not take skill. As a mage you literally just need to kite and blizzard, nova when theyre too close and you always have cold snap to save you. The only different between aoe runs and normal runs is that you dobt have to deal with as many aids groups doing it normally.
---
Close to 50 right now, so levelling still is a thing. I'm guessing "more spell damage" means equipment which literally say "your spells deal more damage"? 
---
Thanks so far
---
Yes! Thick leather.   
---
Also Feralas is pretty good with those yetis.   
---
I'm a 43 hunter so I kill those troll elites outside ZF! They drop alot of green items and raw silver. Also getting 500-600 xp per mob at 43 is pretty good :)
---
He has had various mail from people outside the guild complaining about his guild members. The video I linked was barely a handful of them.
---
Do it. It will deny him most of his content
---
Same for me. Never heard of that douche but a few days ago I saw some stuff in the WoW forums and here in this sub and I just have to say: WHY? Why do people follow such idiots? I mean he is clearly an absolute fucktard so why is he popular? Why do people follow him and even agree with him?  
---
As a matter of fact I don't even understand why people follow streams and watch other people play a game but thats another matter, seems like I am really too old for this kind of thing.
---
The idle "oooh *slap*" noise? Sure can, just change the folder structure and file name to this:
---
    Sound/Creature/Succubus/SuccubusStand2A

---
&gt;how toxic Asmongold is nobody is able to find any examples.
---
Uhm, his entire stream is an example ?
---
Just start farming BRD
---
Does shadow damage from gear increase the damage of Corruption?
---
yeah questie and atas loot
---
I'm so happy to play in a server with no famous streamers
---
Mana wrning 3 times, then let em die 3 times, rinse repeat:)
---
Seriously blizzard needs to ban this tool and remove the mount, talk about pissing up people’s back and telling them it’s raining.
---
What a total c..t.
---
Those who sub to him clearly bigger!!
---
LOL are you butthurt or something? They should have easily killed him if they knew what they were doing
---
#banRoyson
---
All the times you need to quickly click on your professions in fights.
---
Just because you met some shit mages doesnt mean that AOE groups are slower. AOE groups ARE faster. That is a straight fact. There is no argument here. A good AOE group that knows what they are doing will always be dramatically faster than an equally skilled non AOE group.
---
skip skills you don't use, with 3 talent trees surely some must be less important.   At lvl 36-40   gold income will pick up expensionally.  You could just grind mobs from 38-40 like OP  and get 100g that way, it will be boring, but it will be a mount.
---
then later at lvl 42-43 you buy the skills you skipped to lvl 40
---
Thats fine, more power too you. Do what you enjoy.
---
Yep, if the guild needed that pug dps more than their dedicated member that ran hundreds of instances with them, sure.
---
Jeez, 70s for small flame sacs?? I got 45s max on raid nights less later in the week
---
signed
---
multishot is "filler" between autoshots, cast it at any time after one shot or before another; aimed shot is queued DURING your autoshot animation, which allows your aimed shot to channel without delaying your next autoshot as much.
---
Maybe he had someone at work or school making a tough life for him and called him buddy and this guy couldn't say anything back. So when you called him buddy in a good way, you triggered this emotion in him and he lashed out. He probably realized later that what he did is wrong but he said fuck it and leave it be. Or he's a piece of shit.
---
Titan Panel
---
Right about what exactly? You think his UI is dumb but that's subjective so you can't really be right or wrong about it.
---
I...don't expect anything because i'm a Hunter player who has a level 34 warrior alt?  I just figured Shield slam/sunder spam more then made up for the lack of damage prot had?
---
Stop posting shit like this.
---
1:20
---
Don't you see the slightest resemblance?
---
You got retards on both end mate :)
---
Yea, you buy it with a reservation.
---
And if you, or anybody else doesn't wanna join that group, that's fine. There's literally thousands of other dps willing to join instead.
---
Hold up, I helped someone get it and they never transformed into a dragonkin. What did I miss? Is that not the part where you have to get Emberstrife to breathe on the seal?
---
Im from EU, and i have a hard time with the word buddy. I can only really understand it as passive aggressive. 
---
It's like calling someone champ.
---
And you're going to pretend they represent the community of gamers? Seriously? Literally every single community has shitty people within it, how dishonest do you have to be to point them out as if they represent the whole.
---
Ninja looting is funny and a good meme, vanilla wow is a casual game, you will get your loot some day :D
---
Chromie's missing a chromosome.
---
I ve this too.
---
Its from a quest in Stratholm.
---
BiS till phase 5!
---
This has happened to me plenty of times in the past few weeks and I really don’t get it. We’re on the same faction, doing the same quest... what is the downside to inviting me for a 20 seconds so we can share the quest kill?? 
---
I might be in you’re damn dungeon group in the future, so doesn’t it make sense for us all to benefit?
---
Sounds like you need to get gud.
---
mods have to sleep too
---
lol keep it up
---
To add to this, some sellers place decoy items in the AH to get an edge to sell their own stuff "cheap".
---
Meaning, let's say a staff is worth 50g max, they place one in the AH for 300g and promote theirs for "only" 150g
---
The thing is, doing it as an edgy joke still promotes doing it unironically and still makes the people they make these awful jokes about feel unwelcome. It’s not as bad as being unironically alt-right but it’s still bad.
---
/leave 1
---
/leave 2
---
Or moving it to another window works fine, though.
---
My classic experience as a Tank / DPS in full pre-raid BIS has been the complete opposite of you. I'm wondering if the server you play on is playing a role in the toxicity. I imagine the big servers like Whitemane, Herod, and Fearlina would have more players like you've described.
---
I'm playing on a medium/high population server and it feels like the Vanilla experience, not some mega server that  feels nothing like Vanilla.
---
Because he doesn't want to do any of the work of managing a group but wants equal right to loot.
---
Basically, he's lazy.
---
Desolace.. It's just so boring visually imo.
---
Imagine being this much of a sad sack of shit.
---
Unfortunately that's true. And I think it's a contributing factor in the the growing snowflake antics of classic wow community... Entitlement for gear over other people who need it.
---
As a guy who mained a priest from Ulduar through to BFA just before classic and playing a priest on a vanilla private server. I can confirm without a single doubt that priest is pretty stupid. 
---
I’ve have been saved a corpse run by a freaking +5 health bracer enchant. If he thinks that 32 stamina (320 HP) won’t make a difference, then to me that is peak stupidity.
---
Heartwarming story. Sorry for your loss.
---
I dont forget, I just just dont have an interest in running sub optimal groups for leveling. If I am going to grind a dungeon for exp it means im doing the task for literally hours on end. Why would I run with a group that does 20kexp/hr when I could do one that does 60kg exp/hr. Its nothing personal and you guys are more than welcome to form your own groups, but dont hate because you feel left out. You choose a class that its great at clearing dungeons, but they are probably better at other things.
---
Yep, and Curse of Agony, and shadowbolt... basically everything except your fire spells.
---
Whats the addon to have enemy nameplates shown as class colors? Also great job with 2v1!
---
I don't like him. But banning anything because I don't like it is really fucking stupid and in my eyes: cencorship. And I don't want that.
---
So no do not ban him even if he is hell of a douchebag.
---
I've been thinking of this before, why don't we change it so that we all need on "all-greed"-items? Like boe, gems, bags, mounts, etc. If it's a dungeon we should just change the meta so that everyone needs on those items, and that would avoid situations like this, wouldn't it? Then scummy people like him wouldn't get chances to pull this shit off.
---
I think that the post implies that there is no additional context.
---
I don't think we should outright ban talking about any streamers, if it wasn't for this sub I wouldn't have realized what a piece of shit asmongold, helping me avoid him and his friends. But we should have streamer flair so people can filter it out and avoid it if they want to .
---
There’s just a lot of genuinely mentally unstable people on this game. I have learned this very quickly.
---
Irrelevant to thread but why is the set good for hemo rogues?
---
Well, in all fairness, Asmon is a millionaire. I believe the stuff he does on stream is mostly playing a character.
---
The guy is vapid and devoid of any personality, any views he gets will plummet rapidly
---
Fck... I can only imagine how hard it must be to loose your brother this young... Sorry for that. 
---
Just imagining that brings tears to my eyes. You just brought everything into perspective. I'm going to be just soo much more greatful to be able to Play with my brother this time around. I was too Young back then.
---
Much strength and success to you and thank you for posting this! :) &lt;3
---
Well at least people have another funny story to tell in the Wow world. Would be boring not to have real life experience in the game.
---
You got triggered cause I called out people who plug in and play/ exploit. End of story dude.
---
no are you butthurt or something?
---
He killed 2 players with "green levels" ...rofl. They never had a chance to kill him "easily".
---
He could even bandage and restealth on the blind but didnt. 
---
Classic wow is imbalanced, takes as much skill as a kid burning ants with a lense. They also feel godlike, but dont post it on reddit.
---
" other mage didnt give me " I wonder why
---
Whitemane?
---
They combine and there's an animation above the stone. The stick for the wand will be created and spins vertically that you need to click on to receive the item; it doesn't automatically go to your bags. :)
---
Ok first off, the amount of standarization and minmaxing  you are asking for here will not be especially aplicable in open world leveling as it's a very dynamic environment. Secondly fury scales with AP (which you have basically none of until you get proper gear). So at least go arms at 40. 
---
1. Yes up until rank 3 or 4 and until you have your lvl 40 instant attack. 
---
2. Depends on what your target(s) are and your rage availability. I would say yes.
---
3. Rarely worth using. Unless tanking or fighting loads of mobs with excess rage. 
---
4. Worth using instead of heroic strike. As each stack will increase your damage further and proc dodges for your overpower. Would not use much after level 40.
---
5. No, terrible talent. Multiply your health by 0.03 and then devide by 6 to see what this will tick for. It's super bad. 
---
6. Yes absolutely. Use this macro from berserker stance:  
---
.#showtooltip overpower  (without .)  
---
/cast battle stance  
---
/cast overpower  
---
Not worth stance swapping for revenge. It shares cd with overpower. 
---
There is no "one stance". Use all of them. 
---
7. No, this is only viable as a super late game niche build. Don't even bother learning it from the trainer.
---
8. Worth to dump rage or to get more threat. 
---
9. No there isn't and executing, while tempting, isn't always smart while leveling. Sometimes it's smart to conserve rage for the next mobs.
---
Ding ding ding
---
It's quite literally "if I don't get my way, guaranteed, and have to possibly share with other people, then Im taking my ball and going home"
---
I care enough about classic wow that I browse the subreddit while I'm browsing reddit (currently from a hotel room on my way to Florida). I care about the community for wow staying healthy and pleasant to be a part of. 
---
I don't care about selfish narcissists and their group of toxic friends/fans. I care about the rest of the respectable members of this community enough to add my "fuck those type of people" commentary.
---
A good meme? I hope you find it amusing if you spend x hours in a raid, your item finally drops, and nooope, its ninja looted.
---
Says the guy propping up the cancerous streamer....  Go click on his video some more, and show him who is boss!!!
---
I have a bit of traveling to do then 
---
Here I go for 60
---
Anyone on that server that has an issue with everything belonging to him and his guild needs to leave. Pure stupidity to stay there.
---
It’s hard to get in dungeons idk I’m new to wow and people don’t like rogues :( guess I should’ve researched more before I picked a class
---
Except this would be like actors actually commit murder for entertainment. Which is why I don't like Dr.Disrespect either, he intentionally team-killed randoms he played with, which is similar to ninja looting randoms you play with.
---
Or a screenshot with the description of: Haha I just did a PUG rfc that took us 3 hours because we all took our time and enjoyed the ride and we all bonded soo much!! Haha slow down it’s only week 4 and I’m level 16!! We’re all best friends now and this is single candidly the greatest thing ever omg love these guys we’re tackling VC next!!!!
---
Please do point me to a higher quality classic wow related subreddit
---
The top comment didn't mention anything about that stuff, so moot point. That's probably why you're being down voted.
---
Interesting that you can talk to opposing faction ;)
---
So /loling at someone committing a funny mistake is worth the ignore? That's pretty fragile to me
---
You have a 5 minutes CD with that technique, it’s better to do it with someone else
---
Safe to chalk it down to that dude being a moron. 
---
Its always made me chuckle those people parroting out the "WoW is easy" mentality. Meanwhile people are making more attempts on bosses than people do in Dark Souls which everyone holds up as the paragon of difficulty. 
---
There are lots of gamers that aren't very bright.
---
It is. You can report him. If a GM is around and paying attention, they'll tell him to move. Repeated offenses will have action taken.
---
Alright, its Monday isn't it? And I am already done with reddit for the entire week...
---
If you are a hunter , tame a bear , name it Mishra and walk around Desolace posing as Rexxar in this outfit.....   :D
---
I don't know who told you Alliance has better Racials for PvP. Some of them are really great in specific circumstances, but in general... no.
---
What the fuck are ya selling? O.o
---
tbh my friend does it and in a northern English accent it sounds incredibly patronising and i dont think he realises it.  he uses it as a term of endearment but i cringe when i hear it lol
---
can you imagine a 27 year old talking to potential employers on the phone and closing out the call with "ok thanks champ!" that's how it sounded when i heard him arranging job interviews the other day lol, so weird
---
Yes you have to reopen the vendor window as far as I'm aware.  Not that I have ever waited for a vendor refresh.  I don't have that kind of time lol
---
there is no such thing as a "viable pick pocket build", you can pick pocket just fine with combat talents.
---
Video game streamers and youtubers are generally entertainers who do entertaining things with video games. People like to watch them because they're actually adding something to the gameplay. Also, it's interesting to see how other people solve problems within video games - you can see different routes and strategies, more (or sometimes less, see Northernlion) optimized gameplay... things that may help improve your own experience within a game.
---
Now, what people find entertaining is a different matter. I have no idea how people can like watching someone trying to be the biggest douchebag possible.
---
Damn the big panel on the right, is that part of ecs?
---
I asked before if he needs a particular item and got no reply, assuming he's okay with me rolling on it.
---
I doubt it, sounds like you blow if you're complaining about pots!
---
Ah yea, fair enough :)
---
lol i used to be a high rank in his clan. Gewd times
---
Thank you, I hope you and your brother have a lot of great adventures together!
---
My brother was in his early 20s when he passed and it was the last thing anyone would have expected. I thought we'd have a lifetime of antics and adventures together. In a way we did, it just wasn't nearly a long enough lifetime.
---
he actively promotes ninja looting and doesnt care if people do it, even openly admitting to doing it himself
---
How would that be his fault? Shouldn't the mages/whatever be expected to know you need a warrior?
---
&gt;That's like saying stabbing a guy witha knife  is fair if he punches  you.
---
If you fear for your life then it absolutely is okay.

Atrazine, one of the world’s most widely used pesticides, wreaks havoc  with the sex lives of adult male frogs, emasculating three-quarters of  them and turning one in 10 into females, according to a new study by  [University of California, Berkeley](https://news.berkeley.edu/2010/03/01/frogs/), biologists.

&gt;Ohhhh my sweet retail child.
---
I have 2 Assassin's Daggers that I bought for 120g, Staff of Jordan 100g, Shadowfang 90g, and some cheaper twink gear for \~50g total. On last dungs you drop vendor trash that sells for few gold alone.
---
The effort level is around “lol look I won a tied roll for an epic”
---
It’s just shitty content
---
Please. I'm so fucking tired of hearing / seeing that soggy noodle
---
He was clearly joking when he said he would promote people in the guild for ninja looting.
---
I wouldn't say everybody has known it. There are plenty of people who are new to WoW and don't watch twitch or know about these people. If it wasn't for the last couple of days on reddit I wouldn't have a clue and to be honest if I came across someone in game I still couldn't guarantee that I'd check their guild and remember which were the asshats.
---
So 18 silver ea
---
Aoe mage.., next...
---
thats not very nice
---
After you get your key you do Warlord's command to get rend's head, turn it in and you start your attunement for onyxia
---
Counter strike is fair?????
---
Would always take a rogue...doesn't roll on my shit :D
---
And feel free to give me any form of feedback! I took the first step on this new path and I am more than willing to learn!
---
It sort of makes sense since I didn't spec Nightfall so there may just be waste of time to put ut corruption. After having put ut 3-4 dots per target for the past few weeks just spamming one button for a short while sounds kinda nice. Also not having a retarded pet that I need to dismiss every time I wanna make a shortcut jump is niiice.
---
In case you didn't realise, that was also a joke. How can you be so dense bro.
---
Happy cake day
---
Rule of thumb: if you don't know what it's worth - don't sell it. There are plenty of items in the game that have some insane niche value. Wowhead comments are usually a good indicator, but particulartly echants (which have a deposit of next to nothing) don't hurt if they are stashed away on a bank char.
---
I honestly have no idea what Asmongold's guild name is, and I have no idea who belong to said guild, since I have no interest in the person or streamers as a whole.
---
Am I stupid?
---
Very very noticeable 
---
But people beat the content without being able to see any void zones and triple your ping so you’re fine
---
You know that was how the Amsterdam fire department used to be able to drop the N bomb on minorities firemen right?  Do you want to be able to do that too?  Is that what this is about?  And you probably laugh about it...  Fucking racist piece of shit...
---
For those who don't understand Google that with NPR and Amsterdam fire department...
---
Even Asmongold himself agrees that the mods should be deleting here all threads about him
---
Wow, someone's got some problems. I bet you're one of those people that try to get tailgated to file a lawsuit.
---
Yes you are. By making a fuss about it you are promoting him, negative advertisement is a thing and it works. Welcome to the real world.
---
Can anyone give me a definite answer on whether Nightfall is already available in-game or not?
---
I mean it does but thanks for the concern and there are but ok. I think the fact you’ve resorted to insults not only undermines the point that asmon is toxic because right now you seem pretty sticky. But also the fact that you’d rather argue and insult me rather than looking for yourself. 
---
I’ve accepted that I can’t change your mind today. You should probably do the same and we call it there.
---
Just in case you fancy having a look a gold search link is below.

---
You're either ignorant or in denial. Managing Frost Nova applications across the group, setting up pulls with 3-5 times as many adds, laying out a plan for where to los, focusing and interrupting priority targets, while managing not to die whenever cc breaks, all of that requires more skill and a coordinated effort to be executed properly. In comparison, pulling one group at a time requires zero effort or coordination.
---
Obvious question first, are your drivers up to date? Is the driver for the g600 installed?
---
And no one said it was except for you. Nowhere in the response is it said that this is a "streamer only" event, he just said that it does happen from time to time and I do actually think it happens more on the streamer server than anywhere else simply because of the streamer content.
---
My approach has been to block content on reddit from any poster who positively posts about Asmongold. LPT!
---
Please ban Asmongold
---
I know NA people can't detect sarcasm, but this is ridiculous how obsessed you are because you caught him in words while he was playing persona on stream, he never ninja looted anything live. Punish his officer that did. Asmon is literally theatre online, you can't take it seriously...
---
Leveling a priest, and I also stop to rez. I've had people do it for me, and it's a great feeling when your 5 minute corpse run is interrupted.
---
Nope would not do. If its gold herb/mining all the way. Arcane crystals are worth a shit ton
---
Why does this make me so mad?
---
What can I do?
---
my pc drivers? how do i check if they are up to date? and yeah the g600 is up to date as far as software goes
---
I wish i had bought mass numbers of these, i was quite fast up to L55 so when i got there i picked up all possible recipes from winterspring. Guessing i should have camped the vendor. Or changed layers ...
---
I’ll sign anything that helps stop Asmongold from opening his earthworm-Jim looking meth mouth on social media platforms.  Guys a sitting cancer to any community; sooner he’s shut off the better.  That’s without even getting into childish ninja looting shit.
---
I suppose Faerlina is mostly morons due to so many streamers and their fanboys. Other server I'm playing on has very few morons at least from what I've seen. Not surprising.
---
I'd say if you're going to sell it and someone else would equip it, you've volunteered to have your BoPs needed on so people can vendor them. 
---
After all their entire argument was that they need the gold just as much as you need the gear which doesn't change if the item is BoP or BoE.
---
Look at all these malding boomers. It’s quite a sight indeed.
---
some references are too obscure to ever be shared in a public forum
---
Level 53 now. Not had a single Blue+ world drop. Brother 37 rogue has had 4! Must be due one soon
---
I've also noticed that these types of people have no sense of humor either. Like they genuinely do not know what a joke is. That thing with Ozzy and the T2 helmet was clearly a joke and people freaked out. Ozzy then specifically said on stream that it was a joke and people were still freaking out.
---
Asmongold saying that he would promote people for ninja looting was clearly a joke as well. Yet here we are with this massively upvoted post.
---
These people are like robots who are only programmed to get mad at everything.
---
He's definitely a POS but can we talk about how a mage wasnt able to afford an epic without ninjaing an item? I bought mine last week as a damn shaman.
---
We did it with two rogues, warlock, paladin healer and warrior tank.
---
Everyone focused on Emperor except me, the warlock.  
---
My job was to kite her. Start with a few searing pain to gain aggro, run back and up the stairs, jump down and run to other side, up the stairs and jump (rinse%repeat). Use Shadow Ward to absorb her Mind Blast damage.
---
I had plenty of time to bandage (if needed), dot emperor and keep running. I had siphon life up to gain some extra hp. :)
---
I gave up trying to work out why the game can't do it and downloaded Dominos Addon which allows you to set whatever keybind you want. It does other stuff as well with UI but the keybinding part is fantastic.
---
I remember when he ninja'd the bag off onyxia. The guy that won instantly left the raid. Felt bad for him
---
Oh it's the horde ony questline, my bad. On alliance side you only go to that cave to get UBRS key (which I still don't have despite having killed ony several times).
---
The issue is that up until a month ago, the toxic players were at r/WoWservers but with classic being released they migrated here
---
Well there's a difference between green or even blue BoE's and a purple one. It's a shit ton of gold.
---
Watch the twitch link in OPs post.
---
In Hungary we have the same saying, except it's with pigs instead of chicken.
---
https://youtu.be/kkJp_jtqsbE Skip to 14 minutes and 50 seconds. Asmongold loses a roll for loot, keeps the loot anyways. The dude who won the roll immediately logs off.
---
I think this hate crusade against Asmongold is quite over the top, why bother putting energy in it if it's not affecting you directly?
---
It's not AOE grinding that's annoying you, it's just bad mages.
---
I've been grinding SM from level 35-44 both AOE and normal runs without any issues. Record run on Armory was actually &lt;10 minutes from first pull to Herod down. 
---
I've run into some pretty bad mages, but I do this magical thing that a lot of people angry at mages never consider. I fucking coach them.  That sub 10 minute run was done with a mage who had never aoe farmed before that night and it was our 3rd run.
---
I've noticed recently that "troll" is being used as a get out of jail free card for being a massive asshole and rationalizing it for yourself or others
---
Imagine thinking someone being unaware about using a term that others percieve as racist makes them racist.
---
He is a pro Trump supporter ? What did you expect? Of course he is an a**hole!
---
I did some runs in a team and besides earth elemental, ghost mushrooms and some rare epic drops there's nothing there.
---
i already have bartender
---
Agreed. People in this subreddit do exactly what these people want. 
---
Just photoshop a ninja screenshot and there you have it.
---
It does not have the same effect if even a single person was going to equip it. 
---
Everyone rolling need instead of greed on BoPs would be the same thing. After all the recurring theme from loot ninjas in this thread is that people need gold just as much as upgrades.
---
All greed is a command he never said he'd greed just commanded others to
---
I guess you're really gonna like FAPs then.
---
I did the quest yesterday and found a Whelpling before the Quest-Item dropped.
---
All of those are ninja looting drama FROM INSIDE THE GUILD. Just fucking walk away. Let me know when you found a clip of him reprimanding someone for ninja looting against a non guildy.
---
If you need the handicap, I understand.
---
after mage die, they go straight to healer btw
---
Here's asmongold ninja'ing from his own guild after a brutal 20 man onyxia: https://youtu.be/kkJp_jtqsbE skip to 14 minutes 48 seconds
---
I agree - in a PUG. I don't mind helping someone out who is trying to get a piece of loot, but I think that should  be in the LFG message and not announced once People have waited for the Group to form and made their way to the instance. 
---
But my comment was that I have only ever seen this done in a fixed raid group, in which case, that hunter would have a claim to the bow if he had rushed home from work 4 times a week for 4 months so he could log on in time to raid. In an analogous system, he had 0 DKP.
---
Would look like spell batching. You'll see no difference
---
OP, you're pathetic. This post reeks of "I'm pissed at things others enjoy".
---
Fuck off with your attitude, you're the one toxic here. If people like Asmon, let them fucking like asmon. If you don't like it, great move on and dont open the posts about asmon.
---
You sound like a kid that is angry because you see others in a group having fun with something you hate
---
i have **RealHealthMob** and **NeatPlates** and its working as it should without changing anything.
---
just sain
---
&gt;You click his video
---
How about no.
---
Alright, ty! I'm not sure if I could do the same, caster mobs scare me. I'll try regardless, though!
---
Ashenvale i guess 
---
Just kind of a bummer overall
---
human female warlock lvl 33 3 more levels till black mageweave set 
---
had it sitting in my bag since level 30 lol
---
It’s a shame. Not sure what happens to streamers but some really crack under pressure like this and fuck their careers up. Asmongold blew up with the hype train of classic wow too fast and he gradually started getting cocky to the point where he literally is encouraging ninja looting. I’ve lost all respect for him.
---
lmao no hearth to karg. fk those kids
---
I suggest you try to get it, either by finding a tailor or buying the set off ah. Shadow dmg is very valuable, and the set will last you long enough that it is worth it imo.
---
How much gold is cheap and how much is expensive for pre-bis BoE items from AH?
---
Didn't think anyone who just won a big CS tournament would have time to play WoW
---
Playing druid with a group of friends, I had to learn a lot of spells and respec a few times. I also helped my friends get their mounts and skills/spells.
---
RemindMe! 8 hours
---
I think when you compare it to games out at the time, like EQ,  it was neither difficult nor particularly time consuming.  I can understand someone whose first MMORPG was WoW might think that but it really wasn't that intimidating on both counts IMO.
---
Compared to current retail though, it is generally more difficult and time consuming though.
---
Wipe your tears.
---
Yes, because a quest being fixed, will break their immersive vanilla experience lol.
---
I’m sorry but this is stupid, and if people leave the game because a quest gets fixed then I say good riddance.
---
I too am against some changes that would alter or change the classic experience, and I’m sorry but fixing a broken quest to me will not change the experience for me. I bet if blizzard did no one would even complain anyways.
---
no no no no sir pls no
---
Last week i had it atleast 10 times that some random guy in a dungeon group just ninja trades me and expects me to give him water or food. Whats wrong with people. If u want something from me then ask ffs. Im not your private vendor.
---
Yeah I've had the same experience. I log back into retail and the screen is just full of shit. 
---
After playing classic it made me really aware how much unnecessary bloat retail is suffering from.
---
And yet, here you are spouting off calling him a twat and feeling the need to tell us all that you probably watch 20 minutes worth of streams.
---
Which tbh, is pretty tame next to some of the other comments here and other threads but again, my point stands so it's hardly a miss.
---
It was a shitty rule to have which he later rescinded because he didn't want to deal with the drama. Not saying that makes it okay he made the rule in the first place, but I am pointing out that your clip is out of date. He may have promoted it in the past but not anymore.
---
Here's the thing about ninja looting. The classic wow devs only gave us the need/greed framework and didn't dictate to us any specific looting rules. Ninja looting is a shitty thing to do, but if you ban it entirely than you might as well bring in role specific needing or personal loot. It's up to the community to form a consensus on looting rules and to hold others accountable through naming and shaming, and other consequences. WoW is a community experience, if you allow blizzard to dictate all the rules of player interaction in the game, then there is little room to work together in meaningful ways. Players should want to help others to be nice and because they see the value of cooperation, not because they fear they will be banned if they don't.
---
Though scamming should be banned/tempbanned, yeah.
---
Makes me smile when other people finally catch on to the shite that is asmonturd and his guild.
---
apparently you haven't watched the entire video. his first roll was fake (100-100) but second was legit 100.
---
Probably not
---
You are actually faster than the average. Don't rush and enjoy the leveling process.
---
Depends on the given item's rarity
---
You are the kind of person who just accepts being bullied, having shitty content in a game, having a shitty life and not doing anything about it. Stop being so pessimistic and man up every once in a while. Pathetic
---
This was bugged on some private servers and stacked with everything, was very valuable there.
---
Useless on classic though.
---
Wasnt he in asmonbolds guild ? So everyone raiding with them is already braindead.
---
You watched all of them already? Wow that’s impressive consumption of several 20 min+ videos.
---
Or did you just read the titles? 👏
---
Happy to walk away 👍 enjoy classic
---
Haha who hurt your feelings. Doesn't matter how successful he is. He is still filthy and toxic. Just because you are a Millionare, doesn't make you a good person
---
You're an inspiration. I love rogue gameplay but I never kinda "got it", this video makes me want to learn and be able to pull this kind of things off!
---
Wow man it looks amazing!
---
Can't wait to get home and try it

I’m sorry OP but you don’t really have a leg to stand on to be honest. 
---
Your account is a month old, likely made when WoW came out. 
---
You’re pushing an agenda that doesn’t need to be pushed.
---
Personally, I don’t like Asmongold or his content but completely block/remove posts containing him? Seems a bit much.
---
You’re taking things a little out of context, so simmer down, grow up a little bit and move on. It’s not that big of a deal. Just don’t interact with them if they’re on your server.
---
Started strong, fell flat. Typical bloomer.
---
That's because a shit ton of people subbed here only in the days leading up to classic or right after classic came out. People who have been subbed here for 4+ months are a minority, and the people who subbed here at classic launch have different interests
---
what is ur comp? 1 healer 1 tank 4 dps?
---
what are the dps jobs? i see 2 rogues, idk the other 2
---
"even dying from pulling too many mobs doesn't make the game difficult"
---
Yes it does. It objectively does. I have no idea why you believe otherwise. 
---
Dying is the fail state. You are trying to avoid it. If you can end up in the fail state really easily because of a small mistake, that is objectively, categorically, difficult.
---
Please post a clip then.
---
Now i finally know what the boss looks like after 3 parties running into the last hallway and getting stuck there every time 😁
---
There is literally no downside to adding tags.
---
I guess you haven't played priest properly? Mana shortage only happens if your tank cant hokd aggro, dps are trigger happy or ninjapulling.
---
Cheers, I’ve decided to drop tailoring and level up skinning. Seems to be needed to make reasonable amounts of gold
---
I first read the name Asmongold was about half a year ago. On a youtube video suggestion "Asmongold reacts to...", with a really stupid looking guy in the thumbnail. Never heard of that guy before, didn't realize he was a WoW streamer before classic.
---
But I also don't get the idea of watching someone play WoW unless it's a WF race, or an Arena championship, I would get bored after 5 minutes.
---
Only reason I remembered his name, is because I first read it as "Assmongoloid"
---
Gratz! Lol I love the face of the orc in the corner XD
---
Well something like this but not really. He is popular because he is the stereotype of what people think when they hear gamer, people's hate boner for Asmon however prevent them from seeing that there is actually comedic value in his streams without having to be the fanboys. People that hate Asmon just because however seem to think "hur dur they all filthy neck beards hur dur". Asmon fanboys are kind of pathetic but honestly his haters are arguably even more pathetic then the fans.
---
Buy on AH. Leather gear with agility are a little expensive(those are stuff I buy cheap and sell for profit). Of Agility and Of The Monkey stuff under 30s are good prices. You will probably wear some of this till the late level 30's.
---
Projection much? :\^)
---
Yeah I agree I think it’s a good idea.
---
Imagine doing the Hinterlands elite quests and not picking up the Ancient Egg
---
lol these salty mother fuckers on here ur all pathetic if you think he should be banned because he is doing something you don't like gtfo most of you are just jealous of him because he can spend his day playing wow and getting paid a lot to do it
---
Stamina is way better for a warlock. :)
---
Deep...
---
Adds chance to give energy back.
---
Not that great with bad weapons.
---
With good weapons though might be a damage increase.
---
I like Asmongold but hate his followers. Literal garbage most of them. 
---
Man, his streams were so much better 3 years ago. The amount of dumb ass fanboys was so so small. Now I feel like 80% of his Twitch chat are complete idiots.
---
And give Pilav his money you gypsy!
---
Petition to ban u/balesberga
---
still fun to "grind out" :)
---
Not Like its bis till AQ or anything
---
By higher quality you mean more tailored to your personal preferences?
---
I've run out of monster ultras
---
There a many above. Let me know when you’ve watched them. 
---
Remember reading the titles doesn’t count 😉
---
Thats a lot of played. :) 53 holy priest here, been grinding dunegons only since level 30. I have 6 days 11 hours played. :-)
---
It's interesting how the concept of personal preference and individual need seems so difficult to grasp for you. 
---
Sure, his UI would be weird and impractical for the majority of players, but that doesn't change the fact that this is what works the best for him. UI-designers have to make something that will appeal to most players, but that doesn't make their philosophy an objective truth for everyone. If you're still confused, I'd suggest a dictionary. They explain quite well what objectivity is.
---
I know, everyone should take their own pace
---
Post the clip or fuck off.
---
More than that, they're not all full but they're up to at least 10-11 guilds here
---
Many people avoid grouping with them, I don't take them to anything, I just purposely caused one of their mages to die by shooting arrows into their sheeped target. They're like juggalos, they all play with each other but everyone on the outside hates them, even other streamer guilds
---
Seems you didn't read the post.
---
Cellular wifi hotspot
---
You could twist WF totem for 2 groups
---
also guess whats against this subs rules, witch hunts and thats what this is so infact i think you should be banned from here
---
It's his huge ego.
---
class coloured plates i believe
---
I spent 3 days doing this off and on..
---
For some reason enemy Priests decided it was fun to just sit inside the barracks and dispel anyone with an illusion.
---
i read till 23 
---
no 
---
if anything pickup skinning and leather working 
---
gear is not important 
---
feel free to look up quest weapons in either a guide or you can search on one of the item search sites 
---
its worth getting a new set of weapons from time to time but the ah is a waste of your time
---
mounts are expensive 40 silver - 1 gold here or there does not sound like much but it adds up fast
---
the other option is to just group for level appropriate dungeons 
---
go do stockades or dead mines and use whatever drops 
---
only sell on the ah till at least you have the 40 mount
---
I am near lvl35 and am hoping to have a mount by 40. I have approximately 50g so I need another 40g. I don't mind grinding a bit and skinning beasts. Where should I go to do this? STV doesn't seem like an option unless I play off peak hours. I am a rogue if that matters so I could also pickpocket for a while? What do you guys think?
---
Yeah let's get this guy and his toxicity out of our community before it spreads. Thanks.
---
classic color plates
---
The dude asked other people if they wanted it and he rolled with them. Come on now
---
My comment wasn't about cases like yours, tho. It was about groups that have a designated tank (and I thought we were talking about 60 dungeons anyways).
---
Tho, even then it is quite frustrating for a tank to have someone in your group who doesn't care for treat even slightly.
---
Oh of course the rule doesn’t actually *exist*, but it’s something a lot of guilds including mine would follow. You’d get kicked for rolling needs, i never understood it.
---
Hmm I think u forgot the clip where he says that people gets kicked from the guild if he gets complaints about it
---
At least the chest is trash anyway
---
You could end it right now. Post it for everyone to see. You could shut down this entire argument. Either your next post is the clip or its your last post in defeat. Choose wisely.
---
This is classic wow music buddy!

Consider going outside and caring about something different than a streamer who plays a videogame.

At least he provides entertainment.

I usually just did it to get access to the +12 stam/spirit-receipes. They are all equally worthwhile. Nice little boost.

Slow 2h weapon with high weapon dmg 
---
Agility or any usefull stat would be nice 
---
U don’t use melee that much but if you do slow weapons are nice
---
I got a red one :)
---
Did someone say...
---
I want to improve and do videogame comics as a hobby, feel free to feedback me! I know it's far from good but I am happy how some things turned out.
---
No, that wasn't his reasoning.
---
So what you’re saying is ... it’s productive?
---
Yeah, I remember reading that subreddit or something very similar to it 2-3 years ago and it was an absolute shitshow
---
Because you are cleaving the mobs.. with spells...? If they just type "AoE" it could mean warriors with ravager too.
---
Wrong website
---
Orcs apparently take very good care of their nails, particularly notable in official art. [Garrosh here looks like he just had his manicure done](https://s1.1zoom.ru/b5050/885/268299-blackangel_2048x1152.jpg) and here's [Saurfang in his cinematic glory](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/wowpedia/d/d9/Safe_Haven_Saurfang.jpg).
---
LOL seriously? I just make water at the start and trade it to all mana users xd its a normal thing to do.
---
We need more info for context! which realm ?
---
Ban all Asmongold content regardless of the context.  A very soft deplatform, but it’s better than nothing.
---
I sold mine for 600G 2 weeks before the drop increase. Funded my epic mount!
---
Yep, could have seen this shit coming from a mile away.  
---
So glad i'm on Incendius.
---
Why u so sure that this streamer is  older than college grad in the first place.
---
That might be one of the worst high level mage performances I've ever seen in classic. Why did he not poly your freedom? Why Did he want to fireball you so bad? Why did he not BLINK?!
---
This! Updooted for visibility.
---
You are thinking way too much in to this. It's the internet. My choice of vocabulary has nothing to do with my actual temperament in real life. I'm happy as can be. I moved on immediately after that comment I posted, to view gifrecipes about pumpkin fritters. Only returning to reply to your overly concerned responses to my original comment. 
---
Relax homie, Asmongold won't be going anywhere. You'll still have plenty of garbage streams to watch, despite my point of view.
---
Your question is far too wide and abstract to receive any form of coherent answer.
---
Your best bet is to enter some form of level interval and check some similar weapon types [in here](https://classic.wowhead.com/items), look those up on AH and try to approximate from there.
---
So they should sacrifice their own playstyle and fun to please someone else?
---
Hahaha the hunter pet is dead. Rip. 
---
What’s the guy shooting yellow supposed to be? Sham?
---
Rolled on some shitty blue pants with 12 int 20 spirit in BRD. Healer was pissed. It's not even close to pre bis, it's just as much an upgrade for me, now stfu and continue healing. Thank you.
---
You get both.
---
This is the equivalent of going into any other subreddit for a hobby and yelling WHY ARE YOU GUYS EVEN INTO THIS? And Twitch and the streamers on the platform, like most things, are relevant to certain people's interests and not their age. Celebrity culture isn't exclusive to teens. I'm no Asmon fan but I find it irritating when I see posts like yours suggesting only kids watch Twitch, like it's something you look down on.
---
The guys a literal god.. he can do whatever he likes
---
New to wow, any good guides on macros, it’s one thing that’s really slowing me down
---
I see, so if I roll with 2h, an axe should be really good. Slow atk, big dmg ✌
---
Can he at least get a shave first
---
Where you finding all that heavy runecloth at 35?
---
My god your comment is pure testosterone and literally made me came. You made me proud reading your comments, explicating what I was trying to say! Gj to you pal
---
Can you point to anything specific??
---
It's literally an act, a full blown neckbeard caricature, which many people find funny
---
On my server at least golden pearls, ironweb spider silk, felcloth, and ghost mushrooms are all going for way below what they will a few months from now. Also all twinks gear is going to skyrocket in price once battlegrounds get introduced.
---
I didn’t say it wasn’t. All I was suggesting is that OP might be a tad bias. Overall adding tags seems like a decent idea to me. 
---
I personally wouldn’t filter because I don’t like to curate my content around my beliefs and opinions. But I see no reason other people can’t.
---
Now he will use his free character transfer and he's scott free of the terror that Olympus will reign on the realm.
---
Why u believe some random that said it was his friend, any proof? Just curious.
---
If you can, hold onto the whelps a while. Their value should go up massively.
---
Everyone competes by equipping rarer and rarer mounts, if you don't have the mount everyone else has equipped in a round your out for the game. Eventually you end up with only two people and whoever has the rarest mount the other doesn't own wins.
---
Anyway to turn off mount sounds?
---
Oh was this not a petition for WoW Classic itself? Because I'd sign that as well.
---
And in even larger supply, they're very common. They will probably never get any high price.
---
Talent respec costs - I've looked in quite a few threads and all I can find is conflicting hearsay or guesswork on what the respec costs are and how they decay over time!
---
Could someone tell me confidently how the cost scales and when (if ever) that cost decays please?
---
Who did he ask? He didn't ask anyone, he was checking if the one person that could be eligble was there to get it but he wasn't.. Main tank is prio, everyone that is in that guild is very aware of that fact and so is every other guild for that matter.
---
I profoundly disagree with you. You do it if you want to and is nice. None can demand anything of you
---
Of course not, you've convinced yourself that it's real.
---
You only ever want melee weapons with stats (agi) on them. No matter their damage, more agi/hit/crit wins. You are not supposed to use them much anyways.
---
I mean people have such hate boners for the streamers and specifically Asmon that they don't care what they say are actual facts or just their imagination it must be true because they hate them. From people on both factions in Faerlina I heard that it is pretty nice to play.
---
At first I wanted to make a rogue who uses Hearthstone - but I couldn't do it, was too small. Yeah it is a shaman now (=
---
Is this not the subreddit for Classic WoW?
---
I, for one, am against collective punishment. Regular guild members should now be held accountable for their leadership mistakes. 
---
Furthermore, if a player, any player, has been in violation of blizzard's eula, they should be punished accordingly. I believe, in case of ninja looting it is not an immediate ban, which is reasonable.
---
Just stumbled in here from all. I don’t know what any of this means but it seems intense.
---
Worst things u will hear from people that don't even play on this server haha
---
No problem! [This guide ](https://www.wow-professions.com/classic/tailoring-leveling-guide-classic-wow) has more links for crafted tailoring items.
---
Then open it without the Rogue.
---
Yeah that's a scummy move, I don't condone that at all.
---
Is that all though because I've done worse things in the past, as have others. We do stupid shit sometimes, question is what do we do about it
---
Yeah he said he would also make an alt on each server to ruin it if they talked bad about him, it's all just content for viewers, after someone on his guild ninja looted he also said he was tired of all that shit and to stop it or he'll kick people out of the guilds, you don't believe he will actually get banned for saying some random crap on stream right? His officer nianja looting yeah ban that guy, he actually did it, has Asmon said anything about this?
---
I'm not sure you two talk about the same context
---
I think Asmon will probably have him removed. People on this reddit might just hate him, but he's a good guild leader who knows what is best for the guild. He was always fair with raid loot because he knew that nobody would want to raid if he funneled all the gear to himself.
---
He should be smart enough to know that nobody in the guild will feel secure doing dungeons with other guildies if members can get away with deceiving other members and stealing shit.
---
It might be tough for him though since this mage is someone he spent a lot of time leveling with in Classic.
---
Your opinion is only relevant if they reserve the entire loot table, then proceed to force you to join their group.
---
If say HoJ is reserved, no one that needs HoJ will be likely to join that group so no one is wasting anyone's time.
---
If you don't sat anything and make a group, then at the boss "x is reserved" you're a terrible person and deserve the group to wipe and disband.
---
For me it's T-Rex instead of pigs
---
I second this question, 'cus I wanna know too.
---
Grid2 and LunaUnitFrames both use Healcomm.
---
Hahahahahahhahaha
---
Hoised by my own petard

---
Hot take: they're blizzard employed actors, here to make the experience properly authentic.
---
You can have a melee weapon and also a ranged weapon, on all classes that can equip both types, at the same time (warriots/rogues/hunters etc with a gun and melee weapon, casters/healers with a staff and wand etc). Auto shot and autoattack will change intermittently depending on the distance you are from the target. Rhok'Delar is also a different item to the staff and you get both of them at the same time as a quest reward and can equip both.
---
Yeah I've been vendoring them. But it feels wrong : ' (
---
It decays by 5g per month, to a minimum of 10. Less sure on how it grows
---
On the one hand, might as well just DE it rather than give it to a paladin.  
---
On the other hand hunter can solo princess runs al day long for unlimited rings when they get  to 60 so it's not worth actually TELLING the paladin you think he's more of a mess than a sack of flaming shit OUT LOUD.
---
No, that's Details.
---
Read rules?
---
Then open it without the Rogue. Demanding the chest (and water from mages) is being entitled.
---
Can someone recap the video? Can't watch at work
---
Thats a bingo
---
😂 ok matey. Fair enough.
---
Dude it took me about 100 kills for that fucking quest! Started on whelps, then me and another dude teamed up to kill the elite dragons and then we went our separate ways and I went back to killing whelps 
---
I was overjoyed when I had the whelp drop thinking it'd pay for my level 40 mount. It appears to average 25g on my server.
---
How do I pick weapon upgrades as a warrior?
---
At the moment I use the Grimlok's Charge, which is iirc 40.9 dps, 10 str, 10 stam, 15 agi.
---
Is dps truly king? Would you swap this for the 2h from princess in maraudon for a 5dps increase?
---
Iirc that has no additional stats but an on hit proc for 130 damage.
---
Finally the epic sword, if the two halves ever drop, from ZF has 50 DPS and a proc. Is this the best I can get at level 50?
---
The only other thing to consider is that I'm arms specced for polearm proficiency. I can afford a third respec for swords or maces if it's going to take me all the way to 60.
---
If you wanna survive in the open world you should learn how to flee instead. 
---
Most people initiate when they have the drop on you. Like you fighting another mob. Fear and run! 
---
And look behind you non stop. A zone can look peaceful and empty at first glance. But you are rarely alone. You can kinda tell if someone has evil intents. If they mindlessly move from mob to mob most likely you can do the same. But if they stop and watch you, just go do the quest a little further away.
---
You sure know how to make a compelling argument.
---
So that's what a piece of shit looks like.
---
Because of his arrogant tone and assumptions it sounds like this person just wants to be told he was right and they were wrong but reality hits him in the face.
---
Yells in not enough rage
---
Are you ok?
---
Hmm yes, makes sense. Still used to Retail and Survival Hunter, so have to recalibrate ✌
---
Gotcha. I had that helm for over a year in vanilla, I rolled skinning specifically to get it again : )
---
Spells are based on a 2 roll system. When you cast a spell 2 rolls take place.
---
Roll 1 determines if the spell hits or misses. If the spell hits, then roll 2 occurs.
---
Roll 2 determines if the spell is a hit, or a crit.
---
Regardless of spell resists, all spells that land, over time, should critically strike equal to your characters crit chance.
---
Sorry, could you tell more detailed how to do so
---
In scholo you can absolutely do some risky skips. Strat less so, but in UD strat people will often leave groups alive that someone will aggro if they start walking backwards or something else like that.
---
Holy shit reddit is mad
---
Mage is the new hunter. Legit more terrible players playing mage now rather than hunters these days
---
what?
---
Can't really compare it, we don't get big streamers like that. People fanboy really hard around asmon and being an officer in his guild is like a status symbol. In any other guild he would be rejected.
---
You got me all choked up, thank you for sharing. I'm sorry for your loss.
---
40 are needed to make 1 lionheart helm, a bis dps item.
---
However, on these high populated servers, I am told that the supply of wicked claws is so large that you can vendor them as they probably won't hold a significant value.
---
Oh, really? I automatically assume all procs are bad because we don't know the % chances.
---
I'm currently trying out DW just because I got a nice reward from a mara quest, it's the 1h sword that has a proc to hit twice, 35 dps. Combined with a 1h sword with 30 DPS and about 20ap. Even with all the misses and lack of speccing for it, I seem to be doing higher dps than my Grimlok's atm. Hopefully that changes when I get my princesses 2h tonight. Already got my pre bis guard captain trinket and BlackRock ring for 2% hit and 40ap total! Good going.
---
thanks!
---
It feels like Zul'Farrak has been stealth nerfed exp wise, getting ~40k exp per hour according to my addon but we clear fast (spellcleave). Has anyone experienced the same?
---
Can I please suck your dick OP?
---
Petition to ban karma farm threads like this
---
Until you have Mortal Strike, you should only care about DPS. After you have Mortal Strike, you want to look at weapon damage, too. A low damage, high DPS 2hander is fine for 2hand Fury, as the Fury tree instant attack is based on your attack power, not your weapon damage.  
---
Your next upgrade would be the Gatorbite Axe off of the crocodile in Maraudon. You should be Axe specced if you're arms. After Gatorbite Axe, your next upgrade will be The Blackrock Slicer.
---
I cant understand why you are so upset, who cares?
---
Pretty confident, yes.
---
this one i did know about, but still :D
---
Alterac mountains you mean? - where those Ogres are as well and the Xmas even? Think they are called ice yetis or something.
---
But now he's SO FAST
---
Its a conspiracy by the Goblin Chemical Industry.
---
Spell cleave is asking for specific classes. Notably mages and warlocks. Melee cleave is primarily warriors (in the context if this expansion), and later on rogues and shamans for their WF totems. 
---
AoE would disregard rogues and shamans completely. There _is_ a difference when using the different terminology.

**&lt;Senile Chieftains&gt;** | EU Pvp Shazzrah Server, Horde | Casual pve raiding guild     
---
**Introduction**    
---
"Senile Chieftains" is made for people who would like to see all the classic raid content (again), but are not able or willing to spend 8 nights a week playing. Of our 4 raids that we will run every week, we only expect you to attend 1. There are options available for people who would like to raid multiple days.    
---
Senile Chieftains is made by ex raiders who have grown to old to raid to many evenings a week. Back in vanilla we cleared aq40 until the 'twin emperors', but because of the "tbc" release the guild disbanded.  One of our officers has all the tbc server first under his belt up to kil'jaeden. So you can expect a mature and experienced raid environment    
---
**Expectations from members**   
---
We are looking for experienced and skilled players to realize our goal of clearing all classics raid content. New players are also welcome, but keep in mind that most of our players are now 30 years and older so we will have a more mature guild environment.      
---
**Raid information**    
---
Raiding days will be Mon-Thur 20:00 - 23:00 (server time). Once available, we will run organized raids on off days for lower tier content for alts and those who want to complete their tier/bis sets. Loot will be distributed by a loot council aided by a hidden dkp system.    
---

is ninja looting forbidden by the ToS?

Only found the above, but link doesn´t seem to work anymore. 
---
I find ninja looting the same as griefing. Its part of the game
---
There are.
---
For example, if I, a raid leader, state the rules on loot, and then break them by ninja looting (master loot to myself or someone else who didn't win the roll), I would face sanctions if reported.
---
DW is not as good as 2h, but if you're positive your weapons are way better than your best 2h, go ahead. You want to be back at 2h asap tho.
---
So much projection and hypocrisy in one small post, lmao.
---
Blocked . :)
---
You don't understand what any of this means, do you?
---
You are not, but it's the same as unknown ninja looters, you always have the possibility of having one in the group. 
---
You have to get fucked once to know that he is a ninjalooter and put him on blacklist. The fact that he is supposedly known is irrelevant in your scenario.
---
Lol I haven’t watched anything. But just looking at him you can tell he’s a straight up loser. An unfuckable. A girls absolute last choice. Haha just let him keep it I mean look at him!
---
Funny how he's completely fucking wrong and BD are fucking worthless as they drop insanely often.
---
You have 1 video, where is the overwhelming?
---
There is also 1 video of him kicking loot ninjas out of his guild?
---
So that should cancel out right?
---
Reddit: NO, KILL HIM.
---
Let's just ignore the planety of times he could have master looted on things but played the /roll game like everyone else to be fair.
---
Lets focus on the negative because fuck that guy right? has a dislikable attitude so im sure he deserves it.
---
No nerf. Maybe you just didn't realize many mobs are now green for you, thus give you less exp ?
---
I hate his face
---
People like drama. Duh.
---
Personally, I won't pot in a duel, but WPvP is another story entirely. Especially against gankers.
---
Yes because calling you someone a twat never happened....... My point was you felt the need to and you still feel the need to drag this thread out.
---
rexxar?
---
Lol so stupid you only got two hands you can't use more than one bow at the same time. So stupid. Lol.
---
Rofl, what a cop out of a response.
---
Putting on your herp derp cap I guess.
---
No one likes to see the bad guys become successful while there are tons of great small time very nice streamers who get shit on.
---
That's sexist, you think any males would touch him???
---
Gave up farming, still do regular runs, still not even seen it drop. Same for hands of power.
---
I tried to go for the kirtonos belt as a replacement. 12 kills so far, dropped twice and I lost of course :D
---
..
---
I’ll get it eventually!

The turtles drop their scales also! Which sells for almost half a gold per stack (5)! And they spawn constantly.  + IF you have fishing! there is alot of pools of eels and wreckages around the cost which can give you a pretty amount of gold!

#  &lt;Peaky Grinders&gt; | Mograine | Horde | Casual /Semi-Hardcore
---
Hello everyone!
---
The **Peaky Grinders** is a guild on EU - Mograine that is open to friendly players who are casual or semi-hardcore.
---
We are getting ready to start our first Molten Core raid this Wednesday!
---
**Who are we?**
---
The Guild was founded by a few real life friends who are around their thirties who used to hardcore Vanilla WoW .
---
We now have over 150 members with a steady active core of about 70-80 people, still growing each day. You'll find a healthy mix of old vanilla players who returned, retail players, pserver veterans and some newbies!
---
Guild chat is active and always willing to help out with your questions and we also setup a discord: [https://discord.gg/RFXkxz4](https://discord.gg/RFXkxz4)
---
In spite of being founded by a group of real life friends we now have 3 officers who joined later on and will be open to others as well when time sees fit.
---
**For who?**
---
The Peaky Grinders tries to target players who also have to combine WoW with work, marriage, kids and/or social life. Active hours are therefore 5 - 11 PM CET on weekdays and pretty much the whole day during weekends.
---
All levels are welcome but we recommend being lvl30+ as you'll have a hard time finding people in the lower lvl brackets in our guild. Most of our core player base is lvl 50+.
---
For our raid roster we are currently looking for:
---
\- Druids
---
\- Mages
---
\- Resto Shamans
---
**What do we do?**
---
Daily guild dungeon runs and weekly raid/wpvp events! Last week we did a huge raid on some Alliance outposts (Menethil, Astranaar, Regufee Point,... we took it all!). You'll find screenshots and even a video of it on our discord. More WPvP events will follow and we start raiding this week!
---
**Raids?**
---
As mentioned above we are going for our first Molten Core run this Wednesday evening! We eventually plan to raid two times a week. Standard raid times will most likely be Sunday evenings and Wednesday or Thursday eveings. Final decision wil be made in the near future.
---
**Sounds like your cup of tea?**
---
If you want an invite or more info you can whisper one of our officers (preferably during our active hours ;)):
---
* Paine (Guild leader)
---
* Firelord
---
* Erner
---
* Vicus 
---
* Reubo
---
* Moof
---
* Galea
---
* Girlgonewild
---
Or: you can send me a pm here :).
---
Thought I was on the OSRS subreddit for a second.
---
I'm with you here. I've watched asmon a few times, and allright he can act like a toxic douche. But this is not all on him. Having a guild that big is gonna have some ninjalooters in there, and ninja'ing is easier for officers because they are gonna be party/raidleading. Asmon also has to keep up his neckbeard persona to keep entertaining his viewers so he's not gonna kick the guy.
---
groups are your friend 
---
there shouod be another dungeon around your level in a few levels
---
the other option could be find a priest around your level or another melee to quest with
---
2 people is slower but it feels a lot better 
---
and you should start to feel stronger 30-40
---
1-30 feels pretty bad for everyone and some gear wont help too much
---
you can check but i doubt there is even much stuff you can buy at that level and if its more than 40silver is would not consider it
---
most of the good stuff is bind on pickup in dungeons , quest gear or way too expensive on the ah
---
Please, I'm sick of hearing that stupid name. He gets mentioned in chat on my server and isn't even on it. I prefer MadSeason or Punkrat's vids anyways.
---
That would make sense, if the toxic attitudes weren't mirroring those from retail rather than those from pservers.
---
Some people play WoW 24/7 and have no lives to speak of outside of it.
---
How is he promoting ninja looting?
---
After watching the clip, the only thing i understood is that he would promote someone because he will have better gear to help the raid, even though he ninja looted someone who isn't from the guild. Maybe I misunderstood because i only watched the clip and not the entire stream. Anyway, there is no reason to crucify anyone for ninja looting because it's a feature from the game. Anyone would abuse a bug that allows them to gain an advantage, imagine abusing a feature. If you want to blame someone, you should blame Blizzard for not changing this (doubt they would change this knowing it's how classic was 15 years ago).
---
&gt; "Meme Specs" should be easy since you say your role before the dungeon even starts. Technically if you refuse to run with a non-cookie cutter spec you're already blacklisting before the run starts. Even then once they respec and gear to the "optimal" spec you'd probably invite them assuming no other factors.
---
I wouldn't care about the spec but more about the player's skill, especially in dungeons. Dungeons are a joke to think a person underperforms there is more of a reflection of their effort more than anything.
---
All of you are babies! 
---
Ah, the classic wow experience. Beautiful.
---
If you don't know them, then it's exactly the same as random people you'll group with : there's always a possibility that one is an asshole. If you get fucked once, you put on blacklist and you'll never hear from him again.
---
I'm currently pole specced since the Grimlok's charge seemed to be a significant upgrade to the ww axe. I'm arms spec level 49 so had mortal a while.
---
Based on what you've said, and the other guy saying procs are better than secondary stats, I think I'll go for gatorbite and pay for my third respec to use axe again. I wouldn't have bothered, but if BlackRock is a direct upgrade and also an axe...
---
Uh... fun is not against the rules and should never be
---
I cant imagine going on reddit to complain about a twitch streamer then defaulting to degen twitch speak when others bring up a point. This dude here.
---
I think you are the one who has trouble understanding things.
---
I looked at a guide for warrior macros and then altered them to my needs through trial and error. That way I got an idea of how these macros in general worked and soon was able to create my own
---
Mobs are green indeed, but they were also green when I was getting 80k exp per hour without rested bonus, that's why I'm wondering if it has been nerfed.
---
Thats why I use [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/quest-announce-3](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/quest-announce-3) QuestAnnounce
---
It is but doesn't proc the fury warrior talents in classic ☹️
---
on the servers I played before they would always fetch a good 50s each or so when lvl 60 warriors needed 40 for their helm.   But those were lower populated servers where not many wicked claws were entering the market.   Here the vendor  might be a good option, as if they are worth 10s  the trouble selling them is not worth the reward
---
Someone bought him a mount? Ugh...
---
Yet asmon has contributed more to the games success than pretty much everyone here.
---
We found Kevin
---
i dislike asmongold as much as the next guy but asking to ban content regarding something is retarded, if you dont like it just dont click it.
---
grow up.
---
banning doesnt help other people, a permanent debuff would be better, so other people can see the offences
---
Go to sound options and tick the loop music box
---
Why were they dishonorable if they attacked you being below your level in a world PVP server?
---
Did this last night too! Holy Pala 53(me), 58 War, 55 mage , 54 rogue and 60 Hunter. Downed first time, hunter pet tank princess and rotate interupts on princess while nuking boss. Had to keep Blessing of Sac up on War for whole fight, he hits like a truck!
---
I really like it, some small queues still (around half an hour) during some evenings and on weekends. I believe the population is pretty evenly split :)
---
I think it's not about the zone, it's about particular quests mostly. 
---
F.e. people like to slam Barrens quests and say things like "Zevra hovers never drop"(or any other item), but at least Barrens quests are  separated from each other and said Zevras can be found everywhere. But some quests not only have bad drop rates but also total number of quests mob is like 10. Those quests surely don't work well with Classic population numbers (even with layering).
---
But still there are some Zones that are clearly overloaded (Hillsbrad and Arathi). And it's not about "just" quests. Those zones provide very nice quest chains that forces you into it. If you decide to skip them you have to either grind or make some leveling in dungeons.
---
The reason you might see hunters with other melee weapons could be because the stats are so and so on the staff. Since the 25 agi enchant isn’t in yet they might have other BiS
---
Thank you. So I assume the vendor isn't selling the recipe yet?
---
Those two horde bring shame to our faction. It made me laugh when the rogue ran away though, what a pussy.
---
He is multiboxing 40 hunters... Isn't that obvious enough?
---
No, it wasn't. Keep in mind ZF stops being worth it once you're around lvl 50, eventhough you can run it til 52-53.
---
So this rotation is hardest to manage at ~1500 AP?
---
I mean that’s straight up sarcasm.
---
Get over it.
---
Drama sells. This only emboldens and drives more stream views.
---
Search in this sub here and you will find a lot of useful info
---
Alliance just get a bad rap cause back in the day alot of children played them. Those children are grown up now so outside of Faerlina where Asmon built his army I assume ages are most adult
---
Any advice on mage gear in the lvl30-40 range? Hit lvl34 on my mage and still have most of my gears from Deadmines...I know SM Library has a good staff drop (saw one in a guild run but passed it to the healer) but what other dungeon gears are worth getting for mages at this level range?
---
What do you mean? I get trolled all day every day lol. Nothing is real on the internet man, don't worry so much.
---
Z-Perl addon 
---
How do I make it so that the elite graphic and level indicator don't overlap like this: https://imgur.com/a/HtVqtFx ?
---
Aye, thanks to the other commenter my upgrade path ATM looks like gator bite axe with respec to axes, then BlackRock slicer to get me to 60.
---
I'll just use the dw to get the gatorbite.
---
Spoiled brat
---
That was the best part of the whole clip though.
---
You can't run holy shield unless you have another paladin bless you with wisdom, which pretty much means a minimum of 2 paladins in any party/group you're trying to tank for. That's really the only consideration (as to whether you have holy shield or not), whether you have enough mana to last a fight or not.
---
the viper set? just need it, I mean it gets replaced in SFK and RFK anyways.
---
as a rogue though I'd not bother buying anything. Really the only people who would at the stage are people that are feeling underpowered, but at this stage of the game its not a problem as long as everyone focuses the same mob in the dungeon.
---
“You know that was blah blah” 
---
Are you telling him it was? Because that implies that somewhere in your probably tiny, trigger happy brain you logic’d out that... no he had no idea. 
---
So what is the purpose of this rage diarrhea you assembled into a paragraph about? Because you lost me, and I think the whole sub.
---
I agree.
---
The video is from 3 months ago, and since then he has kicked people out of his guild on stream for ninja looting so he obviously wasn't being serious. So I don't know what all this is about.
---
I think y'all are being trolled.
---
It takes some time but I like it very much.  And when a quest is too hard I am asking for some help. No big deal. A holy priest is not a hunter, sometimes you need some help. Mostly you could do quests on your own. 🙂
---
No one is insulting me personally but others have been.
---
Check out this [wiki link](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Talent). Stated to increase by 5 g each time up to 50, and I also remembered that the lower cap after decays is 10g, whereas the wiki states 15g - wonder if this is a new thing or not. However low the minimum cap is, be it 10 or 15, respec cost drops with 5 g per month of not respeccing. 
---
In short, be very careful with the talents you choose. You'll not want to respec often.
---
Happened to me, was pissed as fuck. Did the grind again for the sticks. Would've been good to known in advance.
---
That's fine if you can't watch another 5 mins of loot-distribution, I did. Asmongold said he didn't need it, said he would only be holding it, and offered it up to anyone else that would want it. Don't tell me you can't watch the whole vid and then cry when I give you the greater context you're refusing to watch lmao
---
Then when it comes to the ring, other people want it and roll for it. Asmongold rolls too
---
 He loses the roll. His guildmate tells him he lost the roll. His guildmate repeatedly tells him that ring belongs to someone else in their guild. Asmongold just shrugs it off. The guy who had won the roll rage logouts. And this was all after a brutal 20 man onyxia challenge.
---
Gives me a chuckle every time I pass it hehe
---
Am I crazy or isn't anyone using poisons?
---
Does having higher engineering skill lower the chance of backfires from engineering trinkets and gear? Just curious what benefit having 315 engineering actually gives gnomes.
---
Ngl your story is a lot funnier, our guild got ninjalooted by a hunter ( ofc it had to be a hunter ) in BRD, he took the tank trinket ( Force of Will ), he said be needed it for leveling when he has to melee. He was level 56... not much leveling left and it's Pre raid BiS for tank.
---
I was lucky enough to find one off of world trash. I'm am alchemist, so it's +12g a day in passive income for me. I was very tempted to sell the recipe for the quick cash though...
---
Dude, how many classes at end game have 1 or 2 button rotations? The most intense mechanic you have to deal with in a raid for the first 2-3 raids is literally not standing in fire.
---
Leveling in Classic is the only thing in this expansion that's harder than retail. Once you get to the end game literally everything is easier, that's why pugs are clearing MC a month after launch, don't kid yourself.
---
Have you seen a lot of rogues in Dungeons? I haven't seen many rogues on Mograine EU atleast
---
You have to be pretty stupid to play in a guild with a streamer and expect him to distribute loot evenly. *Facepalm*
---
Why its even possible to message people you have ignored is beyond me.
---
Some dude got mad that an AoE pull went bad and some mobs chased him cause he was AoEing. Tried to explain we didnt mean to do that. Got incredibly angry, told me he didnt want excuses, put me on ignore and insulted me.
---
Guess who got AoE groups run across him for the next 20 minutes as he got madder and madder? He got so conditioned that he startes running when he saw me even if I had no mobs. Then I saw him today and decided to give it a couple more for good luck.
---
Childish? Yes. Funny as hell? Yes.
---
People who insult you while they have you on ignore are my least favorite people in the game. Finally got the chance to get one back.
---
I don’t know about you but I wouldn’t call my life shitty. Seek help man.
---
I don't really disagree with anything you said, I just wish it was never a thing to start with.
---
Quite frankly, most users of this subreddit and ESPECIALLY the official forums are boomers that simply cannot or willingly don't want to differentiate between sarcasm and irony used by certain streamers, therefore writing them off as toxic without ever looking past their own, ill-informed confirmation bias. I don't even get why people would want his content banned as most of the upvoted posts in this sub are either humor, artwork or low-effort content. I'd understand it if his content was featured on the front page on a frequent basis but there's not even a lot about him going on. The ninja drama doesn't even have much to do with Asmon besides the fact of the guy in question being someone Asmon played with and I'm fairly certain that he'll adress that situation on his stream soon.
---
Fuck that quest. A few days I finally had an oppurtunity to finish it in peace, which was great cause it's soloable; Fordring can pretty much solo the whole thing while you half-AFK in disguise. I like to refute this based on the fact that Fordring died during the escort to 4 elites wandering the road between Hearthglen and the tower. Finally finished the quest like 3 days ago but I'm still fecking livid
---
This touching moment is ruined by the fact your first thought was to run to Reddit and post it for sympathy and internet points.
---
Have some respect for the memory of your brother.

Devil nights
---
Holy shit this is so dumb...

Someone joins a raid with known ninja looters and get outraged when they ninja loot, this shit only happens in NA land if the free to be as dumb as possible.

---
The "player seeking" document does not contain information on what server the guilds are located or am I wrong?
---
There is no knowing about the exact time until they are released; no dates have been announced.
---
If you're leveling when the BGs (and honor system) are added you can count on being ganked a LOT more in the 40-60 bracket when leveling, hitting 60 before that should be a good reason to try and level up. At least for me it is.
---
Gold shouldn't matter more then a personal upgrade and I've never ran with anyone that's argued that. If your saying ur gunna use a purple I better see it on you though.
---
Tf is ninja looting?
---
Oh yeah, never really thought about that but I play both. Brewfest was released in TBC.
---
\[Flashbacks to game-losing hook\]
---
Lol yeah idk what the OP intended with his question. I'm sure he expected different replies. Kinda backfired on him.
---
What a dunce.
---
On keybindings there's one you can set to interact with your target.
---
Hes the biggest streamer right now, period.
---
AHAHAHAHAH OMFG, almost dislocated my spleen from laughing to hard , makes one wish that it was an actual mechanic and the result of a warrior's charge .
---
Shouldn't you be busy discovering which gender you are?
---
Hey, I'm looking for some friends to run dungeons or occasionally quest with. I play on Ashbringer EU server, usually a few hours in the morning and few hours in the evening. Feel free to message me on reddit. If you just want a buddy to talk to while playing, that's fine too!
---
It's the ideal character for someone who doesn't intend on rolling alts. So probably not really for you. ;)
---
That's pretty slow pace for a hunter just grinding with barely any competition.
---
The auction house
---
A stack of Runecloth off AH or if you have a 60 main. It’s 100% worth the uptime.
---
Nah the general consensus is to go 2H. Which sounds good to me; less competition for those.
---
Why do these go for so much? Isn't the price difference between these two essences only a few gold? Plus it eats your Arcanite transmutes which you can buy the recipe of for only 5g with no NPC camping necessary.
---
I found an Earth to Life transmute and got 50g for it. I was so confused, people are actively losing money at the moment using it. I could understand using it later, but it seems like such a weird thing to dump so much money into this early.
---
as for the lack of blink, i'd suppose the mage was a bit afraid to mess up the direction in the heath of the moment and blink outside the bridge then crash himself on the ground
---
if you can somehow get together two druids, two combat rogues and one hemo/prep rogue, you can do some incredibly fast boss only runs on instances like BRD, SM cath and scholo. You stealth past most of the mobs, the ones you can't stealth past the hemo/prep rogue aggros them so the rest can slip past then vanishes, and then you have one druid tank the bosses, and one heal them. The hemo ability makes combat rogues do a significant bit of extra damage, and for caster bosses that can be CC'd the kick rotation. Just make sure the combat rogues save blade flurries for bosses with lots of adds like angerforge and you're good.
---
Yup honor system isn't until phase 2 battle grounds is phase 3. Phase 2 is assumed to start around 3 months after launch, I'm not sure we have an accurate eta on phase 3.
---
I see plenty of people disagreeing with each other in this thread. So I don't know how you define circlejerk but our definitions must be very different then.
---
I can agree with this. I got into Retail about 6 months before Classic came out, having played on and off for over a decade, it was my first time in BFA.  
---
One of the worst thing Retail does is it doesn't really make clear what content is from what patch, you can be doing a quest line from 8.1 that really isn't that relevant and it leaves a bit of a sour taste when you finish it and it doesn't really add anything for your character.
---
I think a flare on content that's from the latest patch would be a start, I think some clear direction in the adventure guide would also help immensly. Looking online after sifting you can figure out what needs to be done to gear your character/get relevant item level for your Heart of Azeroth but it's not made clear anywhere outside online forums/videos.
---
Things I had no idea about until I did research:  
---
\- The Mythic Plus Cache, from memory it's not really detailed at all in game, maybe it is and I missed it but I'd say that's enough to say it's not clear. This should be easy info to access.
---
\- What activities are actually efficient when it comes to Azerite farming. 
---
\- Learning Tanking and Healing (really important now where in LFR, all it takes is two bad tanks for the entire group to have no chance.
---
Nice! Thank you ✌
---
Best thing at this level item wise I think is the leather set in DM
---
Upvoted for the use of  “rouge.”
---
You're just as capable of not replying as I am.
---
Besides, you're all over the place. I say that your assumption is a "miss", you tell me it wasn't a "miss" when citing some point that you mention 2 posts further down.
---
Gather yourself and start making sense, smart guy.
---
One could say it’s desolate
---
I hear the guy complain every now and then about this sub whenever he is a hot topic. I'd say Asmon would be more or less happy if people here never talk about him in any way.
---
Gee whiz, I wonder what class you're playing!
---
Ah yeah, the only reason to hate someone is you’re jealous.
---
Don't listen to this guy about not selling things on the AH. There are certain items that if you just vendor, you're going to lose out on a lot of money. Make an alt, park it at a  city mailbox, and use it as a bank/AH selling alt. You'll save time and make money.
---
Don't forget the Pusher Plus, who runs off in the middle of a fight to pull more mobs before you've actually finished dealing with the current set. Thus wiping the team and complaining about the 'shitty healer'
---
So, this dude's a dick, but get a tanking set, asap. In Classic, there is no such thing as "dps warrior" and "tank warrior", only warriors. If you can't tank an UBRS, you're gonna have a lot of trouble gearing up.
---
FYI you don't need to be specced prot to tank, you just need a full plate set and a shield and you're already doing better than half the warriors out there.
---
&gt; What are your thoughts? 
---
I think Dustwallow Marsh captures beautifully that it's a swamp, hard to traverse and basically an environmental annoyance, just as a marsh irl is. It's immersive. Not every zone needs to be efficient for traveling/questing in my opinion.
---
The one thing is, us redditors need to know about these events so we can act towards it, otherwise it will just go unnoticed and they may never get the punishment they deserve.
---
The 69 silver 69 copper makes me hate him more than anything else for whats worth.
---
I cannot stress this enough...just play a class and race that seems fun to you. Spaz and onlineuser also have similar sentiments above. Do not worry about picking a class that’s top tier. All classes can raid and do dungeons just fine. Of course some classes are better at doing certain jobs than others, but the difference is minimal. The joy you get out of playing a class outweighs that factor tremendously. This is a game where you really need to go in blind and explore. So many of us wish we could go back to the days where we were ignorant and could learn the game all over again. There will be so many times you will screw up and die and be like “OOOOOH! I had no idea that was a thing!” It’s wonderful. I understand your need for picking “the best” class as I used to be similar to you in that regard. Please don’t do that for this game. Pick something because it’s super fun to play. Once you decide what your playing, let me know. I’m curious to see your choice! Good luck!

---
Where is he acting like a piece of shit? Have you actually watched a number of streams or are you just basing it off a few people complaining about him on the General Forums.
---
Most of the complaints I see are actually untrue or people eyeing in on a couple of things he might have done (applies to most streamers, not just him).
---
It's fairly sad and the anger streamers like him cause some people is quite eye opening.
---
Whoops, yup, that was a typo!
---
Also, weird. I didn't realize that was becoming a common excuse. It was the first time I'd seen it. Usually when I see people out trolling they just come out and say, "I'm doing it because I want to and screw you!" I decided not to engage with them but one of the people who invited me to the party was freaking out on them.
---
Green quests give full XP. Do green quests.

Meanwhile when it's time to drink as a hunter I drop an immolation trap, send pet and drink.
---
Only lose about 50% dps during drinks.
---
on my guild's first MC run one of the dps asked to link the meters and another guildie linked in chat. A third guildie got mad for some reason, put the guildie that linked dps on /ignore, and left the guild without saying anything. Along the way, he gold hold of World chat and banned everyone from my guild.
---
People ARE this weird, and I feel like it's a reflect of what is going on with their lives
---
Right? Rationalizing a warrior rolling for rogue leather ... and that warrior knows what he did. I hope the rogue left the guild asap. Toxic guild.
---
And if you, as a level 29 mage don't understand the correlation of time, space, quantum aggro mechanics and hps tick uptime you're KICKED *and* on /ignore.
---
Is affliction viable in dungeons at 55+? I wanna do some dungeons at that level for pre-bis but at the same time have a good spec for questing.
---
I agree with that reserving loot part though. Everyone who thinks there is nothing wrong with that because you dont need to join the group doesnt realize it screws group compositions and eventually fucks over everyones chance to get desired loot - except for the guy who reserves his loot.
---
I contribute as much to Reddit as Royson does to rl society.
---
Probably worse, a 30+ year old edge lord
---
Nothing wrong with ninja looting it is part of the game
---
Yea but he hates on Trump so it's hard for me to hate on him.
---
He’s a piece of shite. Gets everything handed to him and pretends to work so hard for what he gets. GTFO here you poser.
---
I came here for the "traditional paladin finish".

Didn't see Bubble-Hearth out.

More of an observation than a question : am i the only ont thinking hillsbrad and alterac should have been/were intended to be one area, instead of two separated one ?
---
Half my time in Barrens some orc called mankrik ran around looking for his wife staying in character for a couple days 
---
Also another time in stv I was waiting for a rare spawn with a group and we waved and communicated through emotes with an alliance guy 
---
Fun times 
---
Until he tagged the rare and bursted him down to take it
---
I have 7 characters from level 5-60, none has it. Ill contact GM
---
This has to be on my server
---
Why did you do that? If youre gona make a comment dont make ot so they cant respond
---
Holy fuck everyone who hates asmongold obviously never watched a single stream or they would know he is being sarcastic 90% of the time. Like seriously just go watch him for an hour and you will understand.
---
That was a bald statement you made, Sir.
---
This sums up what seems like 50% of the player base... so many socially awkward weirdos that have some terrible personality issues.
---
Says a lot about his attitude. "Random unguilded nobodies". Nice guy.
---
needs to be duoed I think
---
Or just screencap of barrens chat
---
That's mostly dictated by gear and not spec. If the guy uses his leather dps set to tank, yeah, I can see your point. But a full plate gear + shield fury warrior can tank an UBRS with no issue. If all your tanks had to be prot specs, you would never be able to run a dungeon.
---
It helps a lot to be undead or druid. I got anywhere from 8 to 13 gold/hr there, but the xp as you say, is negligble. Still very chill and easy income.
---
Exactly what I did.
---
Motion seconded, send that shit to r/twitchdrama or whatever. I need my content wow related, not wow streamer drama related
---
I'm a priest noob can you explain to me how mind soothe works?
---
its hard to say cause I got few candidates for lesat favourite but Desolace is up there cause there are very few quests to do, grinding cenaurs is boring and they very rarely drop something valuable and at least for horde the flight point is in the corner of the map far away from anything fgood.
---
Also I just dislike westfall. Too many quets that make you go to other zones or just to the otherside of the map. The quest that drops from murlocs is just bullshit(I tried to get it of 2h on my rogue and didnt drop) and even when you get it tne quest itself is just running around the zone. The only saving grace is that it has a dungeon but besides that its one of my least favourite zones.
---
i wouldnt mind because you guys care way too much about him (despite none of you actually liking him, apparently). Clutters the sub with useless drama.
---
I think it's just a kid. Kids say weird shit sometimes, just because they dont know what to say and think they ought to say something or act a certain way.
---
All these guys telling you to just respec. I dont get it. But if you want to stay fury, I would recommend going duel wield. The tree is really fun after level 40 with attack speed and crits going like crazy. Going arms and being just like everybody else is boring. Dont listen to these guys
---
to be fair like 1 week ago he kept telling his guildies to not ninja shit so he wouldn't have to deal with it. And when his officer ninja looted the other day he actually set loot conditions beforehand then violated them. Hopefully it results in gkick and suspension from blizzards side.
---
People... So lovely we are.
---
Nah I agree with him. I don’t think I have a single person on ignore on retail after 15 years, on Classic I’ve already met 2 dozen people who you just feel sorry almost because they are such bad people.
---
Alliance gets bad rep because of shitters.
---
Horde gets bad rep because of shitters.
---
You see the patern here? People are shitters in the internet. That's it.
---
First tip I would guess would be that it's spelled "Rogue".
---
Did you even watch the video? That is a warrior tank weapon which Ozzy is not. He put on the shield as a joke and Asmon pretended to play dumb. The other warrior tank Courageous wasn’t there so that automatically goes to him. Ozzy is an officer in the guild and rolled as a joke he’s fury dps every week in the raid just because someone rolls when they’re not supposed to doesn’t mean they get the item
---
most sad part is that its prob ah 25 year old who acts like 12 year old kiddo
---
People's issue is that cleave means incidental splash damage at little to no single target loss (stuff like whirlwind, bladefury, multishot, cleave, standing close enough to throw a CoC on CD between your frostbolts) and not full blast AoE.
---
Starting to give up hope of hands of power/sky shroud leggings in LBRS, but i can't stop because they are the best spell power for most of the game and thats all i care about, I don't think ill replace most of the preraid bis until aq40 or so.
---
Why would you need to go uc for whirlwind?
---
This post screams snowflake :)

&gt; No the implied context seems pretty clearly to be one where they're happy people who aoe grind for hours aren't actually getting much benefit from it rep wise.

Well, that's subjective, which is what I was trying to get at. Feel free to look at it from a negative point-of-view, I'm just not doing the same in this regard.

Yes they did. En masse. All the time. Every day.

I mostly see the haters. I never see pro asmogold posts. Asmogold fans have never effected my game or the two wow subs i follow... asmon haters on the other hand...... hypocrites.
---
There are degrees, though. If you find yourself in a group with two mages and a rogue or hunter or something, you can probably AoE packs of non-elites. But you probably shouldn't try to AoE elites.

Then from wetlands you’ll have to walk the rest of the way.

Because the quest is in alterac mountains and it just seemed like the fastest way

Discussion
---
1) don't start a fight with a NPC or mob, when Alliance players are nearby and you can't take them. they can kill you in the middle of the fight, if you don't watch out. If you don't like it, start over on a pve server.
---
2) you can buy any mount for horde. the higher your reputation with a faction, the cheaper it is though. As you start out with the highest reputation with your home faction (undead), you can buy the undead-horsies cheaper from the beginning. that is why everyone starts out with the mount from their faction. but in the flow of the game, you will increase your reputation with others too and you can farm it later in the game as well, thus you will be able to buy any horde mount.
---
3) no, you can go to every land on every continent, but you can't go unpunished to every city on every continent. the cities are guarded (some borders are too) and you CAN go into the cities if you can overthrow the guards. the NPCs of Alliance will not trade and talk to you, so you can't do their quests and some recipes for are Horde only, just as some are Alliance only. As you can't do the quests everywhere, some areas, especially starting areas of alliance, are irrelevant to you for leveling. If you want to annoy the shit out of alliance players though, go to areas that are lower level, then kill them.
---
4) you find a nice atlas here:  [https://classicwow.live/atlas](https://classicwow.live/atlas) and it shows the area of level next to it
---
To be fair, in vanilla, this place looked much shittier, so yea, classic spirit is the right word.
---
* +15 skill makes it significantly cheaper to level the profession as you can skip problematic sections, i.e. you can start crafting blasting powders 15 levels earlier than others instead of making expensive mithril or w/e gadgets.
---
* Twinks can sometimes get access to gadgets not available to other races in the same BG bracket.
---
* Some creations scale with engineering skill, such as dragonling/chicken summons that spawn as lvl 60 at 300 skill and 63 at 315. Not sure if it applies to things like death ray, and highly doubt it affects backfire rate.
---
What you want to do is frontload as much damage as you can and then just wand. Not using other than wand is going to take way too much time, you need to heal yourself because you cant kill shit ...
---
But maybe its because priest bubble seems to be completely broken atm. That bubble lasts way longer than what im used to in past few years in private servers.
---
Fucking gottem wow.
---
this video is my life now
---
chances are they bought it from gold farmers.
---
I'm hoping it's not because the guide he read outlines how a *horde* warrior would get it.
---
I think it's enchantrix. Or that's the one I use atleast.
---
Just get a nice big 2hander it will make a world of difference
---
Not sure if this can considered a funny story, but it sure was satisfying for me...
---
Clearing my way towards U'cha in Un'goro, in the back of a cave filled with gorillas. Run into 4 clearly grouped guys also heading there, I ask "U'cha?" and one of them answers "You'll see", they proceed rushing through and pulling all apes.
---
I sprint, tag the mob just before them and start bursting it down, then I get the Party invite. Of course, decline. And then the whispers begin "we weren't talking to you but to each other", "we did invite you (yeah, they did after I got the tag)", "so petty" ... I mean I was petty to be sure, but it was well deserved imo.
---
I wonder: what class would want to have this dagger? The most rogues I see are playing dual swords usually...
---
Is there anyone doing these as videos on youtube? Like "A Friend" used to do on oldschool runescape.
---
Guess I'll have to try it put and see which suits my style. Thanks!
---
I assume talents that proc on kills that "grant experience or honor" still work?
---
It's not, you fly to arathi (or southshore if you have that) and walk.
---
you just say bingo
---
I LOVE living rent free in your head! LOL you truly are one mad little guy. I can feel your seething from across the Internet tonite :)
---
oof. thick and heavy leather can be crafted into greens and then vendored for much more than vendoring the leather itself
---
The point is, when WoW was released, almost everyone was 8-15, and today majority of classic players are those then kids from vanilla.
---
Man I wish I didn't skip first aid
---
This!
---
you dont need to go to undercity for ww axe as alliance
---
Had a rogue in almost every dungeon i had over the last three days. The last SM run, we had two rogues!
---
Just a small correction. it's actually his attic. His mom lives in the house that he bought.
---
That was before classic launched and he was joking. Since then he has told everyone to not ninja loot and has kicked people out of Olympus on stream for ninjaing from pugs not just guildies. You can say it’s still his fault for saying that in the first place but be honest with your criticism
---
Godammit now were all having moments.
---
because he looks like one of those people who didn't just lose at life, but actively threw the game to get pity points and play wow non-stop.
---
Yeh I nearly gave up on that one and I've never seen the hands of power. Really need that shit 😂
---
People without bag space 😾
---
Head to Northrend and speak with Arthas. He can teach you 'death' and then casts 'raise dead' on you.
---
This. Frostbite interferes with big pulls and spreads mobs out by randomly freezing them.
---
I dont care about what you think about asmon. I vote for banning his content. Is that not the point of this thread? Do it via vote.
---
Alright
---
Yeah... easiest way is to go to Southshore - to Alterac and then Swim through the lake to reach where Silverpine and Tirisfal boarder
---
Leather is fury dps gear too this phase
---
There’s routes for alliance so you don’t get ruined, your best bet would be run wetlands through arathi then to hillsbrad and up the river
---
Running past uc-silver pine and then hills Brad will be so much slower and pointless
---
That's just called being the gm
---
Maybe its the background? OP has ni background, default it's grey 50% translucent i think
---
Why hasn't he got ban yet?
---
how do i sign?
---
What would you say is the biggest oversight with whelp farming?
---
I actually do thank the tank and healer...
---
I'd say go for a 2hander, you'll enjoy the times you get a crit. You'll have plenty of ocassions to go melee, especially in dungeons. 2x1hander might be a bit better for buffing your ranged attacks though, but it's also double the farm and double the enchants.
---
Don't sweat about it too much, but try to melee enough that your weapon skill is capped or almost capped, else you might be a bit miserable..
---
In the end, have fun!
---
I actually think it's great - and humbling - that OP is sharing this story. For some this game has triggered beautiful memories. Reminds us that at the end of the day we are all human, with pains, regrets or some form of emptiness. I see no harm being done and I hope this game can offer different ways to comfort those who need it.
---
Almost like finding something entertaining is a personal opinion. Who woulda though
---
I know sarcasm is hard to detect sometimes, but he is so blatantly joking in this video that it’s kind of fucking pathetic that the “stream man bad” clowns can’t detect it. He hasn’t done anything to deserve a ban, but I can’t say I’d be sad if content related to him was banned. You kids have been screeching about him and other streamers since beta was announced.
---
Flamesack sells for 70s? In my server its 20s. Im farming the emerald whelps and have over 5000 killed. I would be so rich by now :(
---
Better than nothing :)
---
He was originally popular on YouTube for his ninja looting videos before twitch lol. What do people expect, he literally had guides and videos of him doing it... it’s where he came from
---
When I started my Warrior, I wish I had
---
1: Immediately made my macro to swap me from a 2h to a sword and shield. I waited way too long, til like level 40.
---
2: Made my startattack macros before level 18. I was in the initial rush of players but I still shouldve found time to make them, it wouldve saved me time in the longrun.
---
3: Swapped arms the second I hit 41. Mortal strike is just so good and I only used it for 5 levels.
---
4: Done more early game dubgeons. Other than one run of deadmines the first dungeon I entered was Zul'Farrak meaning I conpletely starved myself of good gear.
---
5: Had been allowed by my group to start gunning for whirlwind axe at level 30.
---
I mean would you really want to play video games all life? Sounds extremely unfufilling.
---
Man, it must be hard being this clueless.
---
All of the higher end PvPers in history have used items to their fullest. Engineering is a literal gold sink and yet the best have always relied on it. What you believe is absolutely worthless.
---
lmfao fuck that guy
---
There's a very good helmet from last boss in gnomeregan, if you don't want to wait for whitemane's chapeau. Other than that, most of your gear will come from SM graveyard/library at this point.
---
What do i do if i like asmongold
---
Ah yeh I need those two. Lost one roll on the legs but never seen HoP. I did find some spell power legs in ubrs which seem 2nd to the sky shroud so you could have a look at that too. Pretty lucky to drop though still?
---
I'm going after witchblade now, haven't seen it drop yet but that danklord gandling drops the ranged too so might be worth. I just want a weapon upgrade. Ugh.
---
I just hit 39 on my priest full disc, its super easy and not as slow as people think. I can handle 2 mobs at a time, super efficient. My rotation is bubble, holy fire, shadow word pain, wand to death. Very rarely do I go under 75% hp and I haven't had to sit down to drink during my grind at all.
---
Why should ninja looting be bannable?
---
Having rules to decide what (harmful) content isn't allowed is something entirely different than policing which kind of content you want.
---
It could be argued that even content like a screenshot of your first mount is "low effort content." You take a screen, post it with a generic title, and you get upvotes. But we accept it due to the emotional value behind it.
---
Some people put emotional value in their passion for a streamer, and I think saying that their emotional value isn't welcome here is an inherently wrong approach. It kinds of reeks of the "I *claim* that I want free speech, but I actually only want free speech for opinions I agree with" issue.
---
There's no question that if there's a video by Asmongold or a post by him that openly condones stuff like RMT, the post should be removed. And like all other users, if this happens repeatedly, he gets banned.
---
But I disagree with the notion of completely banning streamer content or Asmongold content from the subreddit.
---
I think it makes it worse he did it to long time friends and guildmates he then proceeded to remove them from his friends and block them. What a cunt.
---
The lag will be horrible. You will notice a 0.3s delay.
---
this was 3 months ago and he's reversed this because of the mailbox filling up with complaints.  he knows the shit will reach him if he doesn't walk that back

As a tank, this exactly. I get so tired of these holier-than-thou posts from people who are really just looking to smugly inform everyone that they played vanilla and they know more than you. There's at least one a day. This sub really has turned into a fucking shit show since launch and I don't know if there's anything mods can do to salvage it at this point.
---
I think you're right that dots don't trigger it, but 100% they're going to hamstring on their next global (especially if they see you activate aspect of the cheetah), which 100% does proc daze on aspect.
---
Wing Clip is a 60% slow, and Hamstring is a 50% slow, but getting dazed is a 75% slow.
---
Back in retail BC when I finally leveled up my mage I just put 1 copper into the trading window and accepted the trade.
---
Without any communication the only reason for trading me must've been their need for money... just enough to make me feel good about having helped someone :p
---
cringe
---
I have yet to share my opinion on Asmongold, but your blind lust-full love for him couldn’t be more obvious.
---
I only shared a link proving he himself is a ninja looter in response to some fan boy saying that he is against ninja looting.
---
Get a grip, watch the clip.
---
You need if you want to equip.
---
Really? If anything most kids would be attracted to the Horde's "monsters", I sure did as a kid.
---
*you are

---
What are you talking about.... this is the problem. Nothing here is made up. Read the post and you’ll see he clearly tells people to roll greed then needs it. ‘Fake news’, ‘fake news!’ Pfft....
---
If you were paying attention you would know it’s not about him being famous, its about his behavior and how people associated with him are doing messed up things and he, as the guild leader, is condoning it. It’s unhealthy for the game.
---
He’s providing an excuse to others that ninja looting is fine and you can benefit from it. Essentially, it’s okay to cheat people out of shit they worked hard for. 
---
Your opinion that because “he’s somewhat famous, therefore people must hate him” doesn’t ring true. I’m sure a small percentage does, but me personally, that doesn’t matter to me and I feel that i’m part of the majority. Using your platform/power to promote negativity and bad behavior is what bothers me and should bother you and should be dealt with.
---
If it were you or I we would be temporarily banned. He and his partner should too.
---
Who are u people that watch someone stream for 2 weeks just to shit talk them? U obvioulsy like the stream or u wouldnt watch him.
---
Ignoring them however, no matter which sub or topic, still has the effect of you seeing them in the first place.
---
A filtering system would prevent that
---
It was a fair duel. Nothing dumb about that
---
2h weapons with high damage value and slow weapon attack speed are the best for most situations
---
Imagine if Blizzard perma banned Asmongold. They'd literally be signing his death sentence. There is no way this man continues to live without WoW. He's immune to a perma ban. The bad publicity that Blizzard/Activison would get would be nowhere near the worth of them removing this wart from their game
---
OP just wanna farm some Reddit karma because a lot of people hate Asmongold because... Something, I don't know. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Luckily, yesterday i got a little dark boi (is this pc? 🤔) that's going for 300 on my server.
---
What a fucking loser... the selfishness is so cringy... it's giving me goosebumps.
---
I certainly get that feeling, obviously the level difference is there, but they blend together incredibly well. That's a sign of good design.
---
Did you increase the drop chance by using the "Airplane Mode" ?
---
No regrets.
---
Ankhtually
---
I don't see anything wrong with this.  Classic item stats are all over the place and it isn't uncommon to see warriors in leathers for example.  I'd assume the ones mad are just used to retail where items are so clear cut specific for classes
---
I will not go out of my way to proof anything to you. I saw 2 lengthy videos on YT where he ended up kicking em.
---
"Wasn't he ninjaing onyxia?" does not sound like you were sure. That is all I pointed out.
---
This would be nice but Blizzard isn't gonna do a damn thing
---
All you need is spirit tap until 40 I believe witch is the most optimal. And tbh you don’t need holy until 60? I’m a 60 priest and I honestly don’t know a class/spec slower then a holy priest? I mean it’s probably not the absolute worst but def not good by any means. 
---
I was healing dungeons 40+ with a shadow/disc spec no problem. Just a waste of money if you spec holy before 54 imo. 
---
I couldn’t even handle knowing I’m going to have to dungeon from 54-60! As a HOLY PRIEST! so I stayed shadow until 60 and it flew.
---
I wish I had started using sunder armor and not heroic strike as my default move while soloing much earlier.
---
Shimmering flats is great for skinning and is perfect for lvl35, you should have no issue killing anything so long as you go off peak times or get a quiet layer.

I'm looking for leveling groups that can increasingly do combat continuously (with no mana breaks), ideally with informative and friendly leaders. I'm looking especially for the Forte Burning Crusade diaspora, and the EoF and Zenedar vanilla diaspora. I have a level 31 character on Gehennas. a level 25 on Firemaw, and level 22s on Shazzrah and Golemagg, all EU alliance healers, all named 'Egel'.
---
I approve of this. Fuck Asmon, the guy represents the worst of the community and he doesn't belong here.
---
To find this fella entertaining, you’d require a minimum entry of being brain damaged.  The more mental issues you have, the closer the connection.
---
Ok I’ll do that next sry thanks!

'cos he's right, fun isn't against the rules.

This isn't fun, this is intentionally trying to exploit the interface to get the guards to kill someone who's just trying to interact with an NPC. The word for that is "griefing", which absolutely *is* against the rules.
---
Half of them are trolling, the other half don't realize it and are 100% serious.

We had 1 raid where randoms filled the spots. If that triggers you that much, then idk.

And yes he does, been there done that.

Just go for it. It's the best.

Or you can open the video settings and uncheck “Fullscreen Glow Effect”

I also turn off “Death Effect” as I like my corpse runs dark and gloomy.

Airplane mode was turned on with my keyboards print screen, sorry.
---
Never buy gear from the AH on your main while leveling
---
There's a 4th bracket - trust fund kids. And I might as well put retired people etc in this category as the idea is the same.
---
Your point still stands though.
---
Would love to see an arena system or even rated bg's and maybe some crazy 1v1 bosses like the inferno cape in runescape, but in wow.
---

---
Battle dinging is beautiful to be fair.
---
is this a time when its ok to "abuse" layering or is there vendor bots everywhere?
---
I don’t play WoW anymore but I’d like to poke my head in from r/All to chime in that Asmongold is an asshole. 
---
A smug, elit
---
It comes from gear, enrage, heroic strike spam and flurry 
---
Idk if you've played a hit capped fury warrior and tanked a boss type mob with healers spam healing. 
---
But you are a literal machine, you're constantly spamming bt on CD, heroic striking almost constantly and with consumables/world buffs your flurry is almost always up
---
As a long time sub to both, yeah. /r/WoW has been pretty great since Classic kicked up. Less bitching about how specs 1% damage difference is game breaking and whining. If I want streamer drama or “look what this random whispered me, what a douche” type stuff, this sub tends to have at least a few on top.
---
Boi put those toes away
---
I too would like to know this. Pretty sure Bajheera uses it and I've always wondered!
---
Nice karma farm.
---
So how did you form your opinion on them without ever watching them? From what other people say about them without watching for yourself?
---
You're either saying you've watched them and by your own words have an opinion that doesn't matter. Or you just formed an opinion from what an echo chamber told you, which is even worse.
---
Y E S  P L S!
---
55 here, very happy with my shammy - although I don't PvP unless I have to since I am resto specced and dungeon grinding atm. Good heals and amazing utility. Have not gotten any complaints except from a few suicidal AoE mages who think they can AE every single pack in BRD after tank pulls them with bow or rifle. 
---
If you want to heal, you will surely have the opportunity to do so.
---
There's enough of his followers willing to give him gold. He could just buy anything he wanted as well. Idk why he cares to ninja loot.
---
Dropped Archaic Defender Sword from a mob. How much is it worth?
---
There is currently none on the auction house. I am on Hydraxian Waterlords RP Server.
---
Everyone (you and me included) has scummy traits, why are we putting this one set on the pedestal?
---
Wtf they're actually turning the frogs gay
---
Except it isn't. Axe is best if you\`re not human. If you\`re human and want weapon spec in Arms - you go swords and take a sword. If you\`re human and don't want a weapon spec (maybe you\`re fury) - you get a hammer.
---
Oh... a mage!

you're kidding?  the people who watch that crap love this sort of behaviour.

1000 hour of jagex not responding to this post

a man needs a name
---
I have the red one too. :) And I love the chirp sound wenn you mount.

In terms of raw dps without considering mana, yes.

Ninja looting was not a bannable offense in vanilla, move along

Your vision of tanking looks really fun to play. Kite mobs away while your group do the job. Are we allowed to have fun once in a while ?

Also, do you speak free speech?

Why would it break unit frames? I personally heal via healbot so I dont really care about any unit frames. Can you explain me what you mean?

As a tank i love every druid, i can fuck up a pull and i know you are there to safe the day. If i can choose between a second mage or a feral I will always take the feral.

Funny enough they told me to discuss it on wow forums. Then I found out I have to install retail, and level to 10 to even post there.
---
Actually for it’s time wow was incredibly easy, it was viewed as a casual mmo. That’s the entire reason it got popular. Everquest lost xp on death!
---
Ok cool wondering if I should re roll the rogue again or go shadow priest?
---
Like Asmongold!
---
Yeah I know. Still put him on ignore.
---
I've never seen so many people "not care for him" while at the same time making these posts and commenting on them.

Hammer spec sucks in PvE, though. Sword spec is much better.

:D
---
Gz to the loot! Hope you earn some gold.
---
After seeing this video and reading the thread I went to find out who Chromie is and was happily reminded of your comment once I understood who she is. :)
---
You’re right!
---
150g? On my server the bag pattern goes for ~30 and the gloves ~15. I spent maybe 4 hours the other day trying to get it doing the same method as you (except not using TSM). I think it all depends on how often you're re-opening her shop and it requires a bit of luck. 
---
When I first tried I was interacting with target &gt; scrolling to page 3 &gt; spamming macro and only pressing escape to back out of I saw the 30th spot was clear. I had a pretty good rhythm with this and ended up grabbing the +100hp chest enchant and runecloth glove recipe a few times. 
---
Later on I just started spamming the 3 keys:
---
Interact with target
---
Buy item 30 macro (I would usually hit this 2-3 times just to be sure, it doesn't seem to register immediately)
---
Escape, repeat. 
---
I did this for about an hour and a half and ended up with 2 runecloth glove recipes, 2 frostsaber boot recipes (lol), and another +100 hp chest enchant recipe. Eventually I gave up and picked up the recipe in the ah when I saw it dip below 30g. Already made my money back from it.
---

Make a bank alt, and mail any green boes or mats you get to it, and sell them there. Specifically you wanna amake an alt since mailboxers are far more commonplace than auctionhouses, so it prevents bagspace being as much an issue
---
That would be kinda messed up. Just update it and ban any future exploiters.
---
I honestly don’t care what you think i like/dislike. Nor do i give a damn about what he says. It’s all sarcasm and his “persona”. 
---
If he’s serious and the allegations of him kicking ninja looters are made up. Sure, i give it to you that he’s bad, but no sane person can look at ninja looting and justify it. That’s why i think it’s one of his “jokes”. 
---
But as I said, don’t really care. I clicked here to see what got people mad this time so much they gilded this thread. But it’s just people with vendetta against him arguing over nonsense.

---
He is the MT of the raid/group he auto gets all the tank gear, and everyone in his raid knows that.

The segment where people rolled and he "stole" the loot was a joke, they all knew it was his gear. People are so easy to jebait, especially when you take clips out of context.

---
The regular ones were always very common drops in BRD. The pristine variety is much rarer. It was also rarer to do full clears of BRD, especially at the speed people run dungeons these days, so that'll make them more common in the general economy as well.
---
With warrior it kind of is, damage isn't that high while leveling, no AOE, very little cc, they're not that great in dungs unless they're tanking so I don't get mad at groups for not wanting to run dos with my warr, I just learnt to tank and no I never have a problem finding a group.
---
It sounds like you never liked him to begin with
---
This is some next level baiting. Haven't seen one this elaborate for years.
---
It's a combination of all the small things really.
---
Stop being such a retarded kid and stop asking mommy blizzard to deal with meanies everytime you get hurt. Use ignore or any of available addons to form your blacklist.
---
I thought breakdancing Thrall was good until I saw Kel'thuzad doing the thriller.
---
What about the blue one?
---
I know they didnt add the bronze one until wod, but surely the blue one was in vanilla right?
---
The alliance actually has 10 more exclusive quests than the Horde does. Agree with everything else though.
---
Why the fuck is Blizzard still not banning him and taking all gold ?
---
At least you got to enjoy the aquarium! Lol

I don’t think I’m wrong mate, I’m pretty sure I turned it off myself.
---
And raw spirit is pretty bad for Shamans and Pallys. They use mana per 5
---
So what does it mean then?
---
So far it’s been bubble, mind blast, shadow word pain and wand to dead. 
---
I maybe get hit once before I drop them and on to the next one.
---
You spammed 3 keys for 18 hours straight?
---
Is this some sort of cover post for botting?
---
How???
---
I don't know, I think a bit of world pvp is fun and part of the experience. For me, Classic isn't about speeding to 60, so I'd much rather kill some hordes and get owned by others.
---
"Ok pal"
---
How am I supposed to hit shift and s with my other hand down my pants on my winkey?
---
I've never liked Asmongold, but this is the bed you fuckers made, now you lay in it.

You can use nameplates
---
Holy shit! Why didn't we think of that!? If only they werent used for leveling tailoring in an efficient manner.
---
&gt; a quest chain (Warlock
---
No chain was involved to get the lock mount
---
Would make a great offhand for a dagger rogue. Honestly wouldn't make a bad tank weapon. Since tanking classic is more about threat, and this having high weapon speed and CoH damage it would help generate threat. This wouldn't be replaced until Alcor's Sunrazor.

But the money is also going to be worth a lot less.

If you're getting bonebiter by 36 I suppose sword can be better, otherwise you want the slowest possible weapon as arms.

This is clear proof of how mentally retarded many people (including you) on this sub are

If you already have 50g you're on great pace and just doing quests to 40 white looting mobs should give you enough.

Please post the server name and faction this happened on. Hes about to get a lot more buddies
---
Clocked in 17 days since release.
---
But I'm back in college now so now I can only play like 2 hours a day max.
---
With that being said I utilized the shit out of my time omg. I will never have to worry about grinding for gold again as long as classic exists. 
---
Let's just say I need a 2nd acc to store twink items.
---
Thank you for understanding! This was one of those things in life where one can't help but feel like the experience was worth sharing and I know my brother would understand my posting it. Sometimes something seemingly trivial can be immensely important and this was one of those times. The chance to revisit a place I thought I'd never see again, to simultaneously mourn the loss and appreciate the memories that go with it. It's huge and I know I can't be the only one who has or will experience this. 15 years, a lot of us have seen loss in that time.
---
...Which agrees with what I've said, because a 2.8 speed 45 dps weapon's damage range has 126 right in the middle of it, while a 3.8 speed 40 dps weapon's damage range has 152 right in the middle of it. Which means that the top-end of the 3.8 speed weapon is above 152, which, last I checked, is higher than 126.
---
So I don't understand the point of you telling me no?
---
PvE wise you’ll be fine. During PvP encounters you will be always one step back.
---
&gt; My scummy traits are things that are essentially harmless to other people. 
---
So are racist jokes (considering the consensus on those) but here we are.
---
Skinning and vendoring it got me my 90g by 41
---
Can someone explain what ninja’d or how to ninja or asmongold is please? I’m lost.
---
Yeah people didnt like it when I said this is how its going to be in classic. Everyone assured me it will be all kumbaya and drive by buffs and everyone grouping to do content together.
---
So far on Ally side Atiesh, I've fought and fought to get groups when quest mobs are in short supply. I give my Intel buff to everyone and rarely do I get a return buff. 
---
I started out being so ecstatic about Classic, but now I just dread logging in. That whole "alone in a crowded room" feeling has sunk in hard.
---
Ah, yes. İ didnt think that. 65g now is worth equal to maybe 250+g 3 months later.
---
The ones who have no life are the ones who give a fuck about some random person ninja looting in a game
---
It does and it doesn't. If your have auto attack going, it just resets your swing timer. But if you stop your auto attack, it will both reset your swing timer and store a second hit, stacking up to 4 extra hits.  
---
[Rextroy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_MHIkMhSfc) made a video explaining how to abuse that in classic.
---
Google brought me here. Have you managed to find anything that meets your needs? I'm looking for something similar too, just show me available quests on the mini map, nothing else.
---
Do You Like Your Mom? Her Normal Attack is Two Attacks at Full Power (or also known as Okaa-san online, yes the long title is literally the official title..)
---
&gt; talked about going back to a non toxic form of gaming.
---
Can you link the clip of this?
---
farming cath is probably going to make you the most gold unless you find a really juicy skinning spot or something. 
---
between the grays/greens/cloth you make a lot
---
All of this is true if you're raiding in a guild with mostly always the same people, because then eventually everyone else has the items you didnt get. But if you switch guilds a few times or worse: raid with pugs mostly, it becomes an issue and gets extremely demotivating if some random lvl 58-59 who did 1/3 of your dps throughout the entire raid gets all the loot while you get nothing.
---
Another example of when it can really matter when/if you're getting loot or not (even if you're only raiding as a guild without pugs) is when you play one of those classes/specs which arent really needed as much, like f.e. hunters or resto druids. 
---
If a guild starts out raiding with \~5-6+ hunters initially because they just happen to have a lot of them due to them being fast levelers, those that just got more lucky with loot are more likely to actually stay and keep their dedicated raidspot for later phases and tiers where the guild eventually might want to cut down to only 2-3 hunters and obviously keep the "best" ones, the others who werent favored by either rng or the council will be left behind (worst case get replaced by some blue prebis mages/warlocks), and be rightfully pissed about it.
---
Ooh thanks. Many others were looking around for it too. It's not very clear online.
---
You can AoE from 30 to 42 via SM.
---
30-33 at GY
---
33-35 at Library
---
35-38 at Armory 
---
36-42 at Cath
---
In my defense, I've had issues with the wrong tooltip showing with my macros that have Battle Stance in them first, so I figured /startattack would work the same way and put the auto-attack icon over it. Easily solved by swapping Flame Shock's and startattack's positions, but all it'll really do is save a few characters that don't need to be saved since the macro is so short anyway.
---
In raids most likely your pet will take too much damage for it to constantly be on the boss attacking.
---
Meaning the optimal pet for raids is actually wind serpent/wolf. Wind serpent is more dps cause it can use breath from range, wolf is good cause it can howl for party members without being in danger. 
---
If you will use a cat anyway, the dps of all cats are the same, as in if it has higher aspd it has lower damage.
---
If I were you I would funnel all my gold into whelplings if they sell for less than 10g. 
---
They will eventually be worth hundreds of gold each like let's say a year from now.
---
That's correct. Only bad players reached 60. Good players are in 30-40 range atm. Wait for december. That's when good players will start to roll over everyone.
---
after 20 leveling gets significantly slower - and getting specific gear can really help increase your clear speed.
---
What a cuck
---
Haha no worries I found it funny. Even if I got a downvote from someone not understanding the convo ;)
---
Tbh I was interested in potentially farming with holy nova.
---
I never got an epic mount 15 years ago despite being on t2 raiding gear because I never made enough money :(
---
&lt;Dwarven Overlords&gt; is like my favorite guild on Grobb
---
I always earned my epic mounts in vanilla like a real man. Skinning beasts and picking flowers
---
Don't know if I was lucky so far, or if germans just don't watch videos that much...
---
I'm leveling a warrior, my gf is doing a priest, so we always look for dd's to do dungeons.
---
So far I had one annoying mage who always insisted "pull more" (while I stated I coudn't because I was playing both characters at once, wich is a nightmare as tank+heal). He pulled more. We wiped. He pulled more. Still didn't help to clear faster, since reg-times got higher. 
---
After I kindly asked him to let me pull instead, since this would make the dungeon go at a steady pace rather than.. whatever he was doing.. it was fine tho.
---
Other than that...
---
What annoys me most as a tank:
---
1. Tabbers. Tab dot tab dot tab dot ooooh that was another group I pulled, sorry, just tabbing through mobs, didn't notice.
---
2. Bad AOE Mages. 1 enemy? BLIZZARD! Other mage sheeped? BLIZZARD. Even worse if they don't understand to let me grab aggro (for god's sake I'm working with dynamite so you can aoe without pulling aggro, just give me a sec to grab it). Then, when all the mobs are split up the mage runs away from me, so all the mobs are spread out as much as possible, ensuring no aoe would be able to hit them.
---
3. Half-Mana-Aggro: Ok, so I got it, dd's are impacient. Now, my gf (the holypriest) is always max mana / rarely needs to drink. So, while our oom dd's take a rest I go and pull the next group to build up some aggro, since my healer won't need any time (or if she will I just stun the group and put on a shield for blocks). Usually dd's get this, drink up, then kill the group. But there are those dd's that jump up the moment I pull (25% mana), put out all their burst, draw aggro, make me go bersistance=&gt;intercept=&gt;taunt aaaaaand... wand for the rest of the fight cause they are oom.
---
4. People who don't understand that skull is first target, x is second, and prefere to hit the high armor class enemies without any abilites over the low / medium class mobs that either heal their buddies or cc the tank so he looses aggro. 
---
5. Hunter &amp; Warlock pets that haven't been set to passive. My fav was a hunter pet sprinting towards a blooddrinker pat at the stairs event, pulling the entire flock in a weak-aoe group.. wipe and goblin died ...
---
One month ban and take away his mount/gold?
---
You're so confident in this thread, but you're completely wrong man. I'm pretty sure Skarm said he wasn't going to switch to fury/prot until at least bwl. 
---
Regardless, fury/prot (either DW or S+B) only works with good gear. If you're s+b, you need high crit so you can proc flurry reliably or you're not gonna out-threat deep prot. Shield slam, 1h spec, imp revenge are all solid talents that you're not gonna get with fury/prot. 
---
If you go DW right now in blues and some MC epics, your healers won't be able to keep up. There might be some exception to the rule out there in one of these world first guilds, but this will be true for 99.9% of people right now.
---
Bis can be subjective right. Like the best thing in your slot would be a sock
---
It's been a few months since the post. Have you managed to find anything to meet your needs? I'm looking for something similar. I'd just like to see available quests on the mini map, nothing more.
---
Still has it ...
---
It's the price you have to pay for being the most annoying class to fight (as a Warrior, at least). At least you're not prot pala.
---
&gt; ??? tons of elemental go in resto just to get nature swiftness. Some even opt for that over the last talent in ele.
---
I mean... all that go for it opt for nature's swiftness instead of the ele ultimate. You can't get both together :P
---
I play mage and I can 100% confirm that finding a regular group is fairly easy. I just ask "Normal run or AoE run/farm?" and wish them good luck and leave if it's a spellcleave group since I'm not interested in those runs.
---
Comment to find later
---
You couldve easily farmed the gold for the recipe from the AH in 18 hrs xD
---
You're doing almost half your normal threat in battle stance vs defensive stance, and any mildly competent dps will be able to pull agro from you. Please don't do that.
---
a while ago, think of all the bop crafting mats
---
No hydras arent a problem they die fast enough.. I was specifically talking about Princess Theradras. She farts all over the place and keeps resetting aggro.. 
---
I was hoping HS crit would be enough dmg to bring aggro back to me in those situations.
---
Same thing with final boss in Sunken Temple. After I come back from banish I become pretty much useless :(
---
Not sure if you're just trolling at this point but you're basically the kind of toxic player this post is about if not
---
He's the one who needs to grow up. And you as well for that matter. Assholes should be called out, not ignored.

Oh, i've seen this one recently.

Is it any good? Haven't started to watch it yet because i thought an isekai anime with an main character and his mom sounds lame or even worse be super weird.

Anyone has the macro in which the pet attacks the target at max distance, then follows, attacks again at max distance and so on... it’s usefull to kite mobs between difrent targets
---
You need gear to have a good chance in PVP, which you won't get for quite a while from PVP alone (the grind is *insane*, you better be wearing some good stuff in the process).
---
On top of that, there's a lot of consumables and other "toys" that can give you a very significant edge in pvp and must be farmed in the open world, which might be surprising for those used to arenas where you aren't allowed to use any of that. And to afford those consistently, you need to build up a decent bank.
---
Some ideas for even more improvement:
---
- better uptime on mana spring
---
- Always mana spring and never heling stream. Heal during Dust field
---
- open with flame shock, cast Frost shock after 6 seconds. Recast flame shock after finale tick. Repeat. You should get 1 Spirit tick between each shock. Repeat till oom.
---
- once oom stop using shocks. Only use mana spring and searing. Regen enough mana to start casting shocks again to finsh her (half your mana)?
---
They very much are not. They are the result and/or continuation of centuries of oppression, exploitation, and murder.
---
Those things are explicitly harmful and perpetuate dehumanizing abuses of vulnerable populations.
---
How many dishes I let stack up in my office (as an example of one of my scummier traits) is something that really only impacts me and isn't terribly harmful at all. The worst it does is make the room a bit stinky or the house run low on certain dishes for a bit.
---
It's a scam if they say loot rules before and fool people. If there are no said loot rules  anything goes. But if they report him, he'll get punished.
---
Yeah in MC if they are not stupid and stand behind the boss or ignoring the mechanics and spamming execute. 
---
In ony they are 4th place.
---
I personally don't care about "who does the most damage". Classic classes were more like stereotypes. You got the priest for healing, the warrior for tanking and the mage for damage. All sets were made for one spec. And this does not change until AQ40 - for a reason, it's their best spec. 
---
On every server there is a lack of tanks. And there is a fury spec which inlcudes damage and tanking. So whats the point in playing armes - which is the worst spec of all? If you want to be able to use every single possiible spec with the best gear - play retail. Classic wasn't designed with such things in mind
---
Hopefully ... Blizzard has become joke ,if they let him unpunished with all this evidence..
---
I'm OK with the break, keeping rage up for druid sucks we get enrage once on a 1min CD, not worth using when 4+ mobs around you will pretty much do the same thing. The most effectiveness comes from slapping around a single mob, then going in full rage for the next pull, you can keep your rage up when the mana drinks simply by using enrage.
---
For a druid the starting scratch is much easier too, since you have a full bar of mana that you don't use, cast regrowth then switch to bear, then reap the next 20 seconds of extra threat generation for no rage cost what so ever. This has synergies with healers drinking, since as a druid you aren't going to switch out to caster form if your rage is full and lose all that precious salty anger.
---
How about Moofasa
---
enchantrix does this i think
---
Honest question because theres probably some of you In here.
---
Are you 12?
---
Why would you watch either of these man children?
---
And even more why would you donate?
---
I understand people watching streamers / donating. But people like this? 
---
Who's watching this and thinking 'oh yeah this is a good guy I'll throw money at him'
---
I think this argument doesn't hold up in reverse. You could say every zone is "just a forrest" or "just a desert" and it should feel empty and harsh to traverse.
---
No matter what setting you picture, you could make it exciting and fun, which imo is the point of a video game.
---
If the point of blizzard was to make a boring and empty swamp simulator they did a good job, but WoW is a RPG with adventures and things to uncover, which this zone really lacks in my opinion
---
No they are talking about staying loot rules before the party and then later breaking them. This means you ate intentionally exploiting the player. 
---
Yes the article writes specifically about master loot. But nowhere says it it’s exclusively that. 
---
It’s not about what loot rules you use. It’s about intentionally scamming someone else.
---
I hit 60 roughly 3 weeks ago (maybe a little more) and didn't have a single bad grouping experience all the way to 60, many of the people i grouped with are now in the same guild as me and still haven't had a negative experience with any of them. The other tryhards are very friendly to each other in my experience, what you guys are experiencing is mid-tiers who look down upon the "casuals" who will find a problem in every group no matter what
---
2 rogues and 2 mages.. its nerfed version of ubrs or i dont know whats up with it... we remembered way harder too, but it was laughable easy
---
Thanks, I'll check out the video. I thought there would be very few changes. A lot of the differences don't seem necessary at all. They claimed that a lot of changes would happen because of the client difference etc, but a lot have nothing to do with it. Oh well.
---
Thx you for the laugh
---
Depends on if you planned and bought the blue sapphires ahead of time. They were pretty cheap on my server ~10g each before Lionheart recipe was found. Now it's up to 30g+ each. Basically the cost of an epic mount now.
---
No way I'm the Getz in that pic!
---
You almost dislocated your spleen?
---
Strange users are drawn to each other
---
Long fights = raid = one of mages needs to have it. So if you don't want to - don't run with this talent.
---
You're wrong as well because what they fixed (in 1.8, not 1.10) was that they removed the damage bonus from slow weapons (which was actually a holdover copied from EverQuest) but their high top end damage still makes them better. So slower is still better.
---
Top end damage still matters for instant attacks.
---
&gt; Neither side is going to budge no matter how persuasive or thoughtful of a thread is made.  How about we just use this to indulge in memes and shitposts about the situation?
---
ftfy
---
I have already bought everything I need for my 29 hunter, once it is levelled I will take it out to southshore and do some patrols.
---
Have fun :)
---
where can I turn that shit off?
---
At least you got in. For two days I looked for a group, needed a tank, and wound up questing past the level. Said screw it and never found a tank
---
Its a 50/50 chance about 100% of the time
---
He didn't skin them.

Levelling guide from Hydra who is a priest in Apes, the guild that got world first MC and Onyxia kills.

Of course lol
---
&gt;Never gotten this. People just want to min-max waaay too much. The same in retail.  
---
&gt;So many times, I've been doing a +16-17
---
you do +17s and dont minmax? did you mean 7s? lol
---
You’re not gonna want to hear this but i just hit 50 last night and mobs are still only giving 200-250xp
---
When he left the guild they didn’t trust me for the longest time, thinking that I was gonna follow him lol
---
Wow just wow our ta k ditched us when we got the first respawns had to clear it with a good ol mage tank
---
Thanks, I really enjoyed doing them!
---
Never meant to imply it was blue, was just saying people will probably save their money for epic mount and go after eye of rend :)
---
The moment you start farming gear people will pay attention. The simple fact people reserve loot should prove that.
---
Haha sup homie! 👋
---
You must follow yourself
---
Reserve runs were big in Vanilla, this is not new to classic.  It's always been a way for veteran runners to mingle with the rest of the PUG community.  It affords better quality runs for those who haven't run the dungeon 50+ times, and knowledge/experience.  It also gives veterans a reason to run with the PUG.
---
the only thing i use nameplates for is a big red arrow which points at the mob i target. So i can easier see what i have in target.
---
First time playing range at all in wow. And this time in classic and i have hard times seeing what enemy i have in target
---
If he is a good guy there should be plenty of examples from his streams?
---
Personally I prefer the ninja looters to be banned from the game, after providing the needed evidence of course. 
---
They damage the game and community.
---
As someone else said, 12 arcanite bars is the bottleneck in that recipe.  40 wicked claws are easy by comparison and in the time it takes to acquire 12 arcanite bars you can farm 500 wicked claws.
---
And here I hoped someone made a guild where all members can only use fist weapons.
---
This is exactly my problem as prot pala right now, cant tank last boss in ST. He starts casting his sleep ability and then the raid wipes because I cant get my aggro back.
---
Almost as if all races have a dark and a light side. Two sides of the same medal, always.
---
Absolute best is, when lock do this and you kill him again...
---
I'd guess normal playtime at 40 is around 4 days or a bit more, maybe 5.
---
Besides it being a gnome but that's not your fault
---
I hate warriors who refuse to tank. You're playing a class not a specific role, do whatever the group needs to succeed even if that means tanking for the benefit of the group.
---
reserving items isnt a "shitty thing to do"... if you want to reserve an item you can either. RESERVE it or just not invite people who would roll on it. The only people who "don't understand" are you entitled babies who think because you paid your sub you should get into any group you want
---
If I see Horde player - there's 30% chance that he will attack me.
---
If I see 2-3 Horde players - that's 90% chance that they will kill me.  
---
If they also are ~3-5 levels higher than me - it's 99% chance.  
---
Now, if it's level 60 Horde players - it's the opposite, 99.9% chance that they will ignore me. But there's also 0.1% of level 60 that go to Redrige and dot every lvl 15 player. :)
---

I have never played Fortnite in my entire life! is it any good?
---
More around 36 points to be effective.  You need improved drain life, fel concentration, dark pact, and all the additional damage talents.  +hit talents are also useful to lower resists and nightfall is nice to have if you plan on doing dungeons as well.  Once you get all that you can go into +5stam, +5int talents in demo tree, but affliction is plenty useful before that.
---
I actually enjoy watching his stream, but to actually participate on the server or in the guild? No way.
---
It usually works quite well, but in certain areas I found it a bit too much. Tanaris especially strained my eyes a lot, due to the super bright sand.
---
But even if I were the mage to run with winter's chill, 2-3 points should be enough no?
---
None of you care about anything but yourselves. You either mock something when you dont understand it, or you use condescension to "help people understand" ie mansplaying. 
---
If what I'm saying ruffles your feathers, then you really need to seek therapy you little snow flakes. Oh wait, you guys dont believe in therapy! Try uh drinking some more, or doing copious amounts of drugs... oh no wait, use religion to justify your life and tell me that's how I'm fucking up my life.

It's literal minutes after the one on the front page was locked and now we're here in a meta-thread about that thread.  Give it a rest.

Mograine seems like a shithole server from all the posts I've seen
---
Would you mind sharing it? That's a QOL macro.
---
What is amazing to me is that after hearing this claim most people just go, "oh that's crazy" instead of looking into it.  I've had this experience with so many different things people assume are wrong (and will argue about) even though they've done 0 research.  It's sad.
---
Rolling a rogue. I’m currently using a sword in main hand and dagger in off-hand. If the damage on the dagger is higher than an alternative sword, is there a good reason not to do this?
---
Just curious because I keep hearing about ‘combat swords’ and ‘combat daggers’, but no one talks about whether they’re interchangeable.
---
Shoutout to morgrine, the best EU server.
---
Dont vendor the wicked claws, put them up on AH since they are needed in crafting the lionheart helm and the BiS head for feral druids.
---
I see both sides. Makes sense. People are a lot more relentless these days. I think back then we would do one or two BRD Arena runs at most. Now people train run that for hours on end. Lol
---
Yea I’m pretty sure combat spec with sword specialization is best, but I *guess* you could swap out the offhand with a dagger, especially if you take dagger specialization.. I wouldn’t, personally, but hey. 
---
If you’re PVPing, or doing a dagger spec, it’s probably good, though, although I’m sure you can find a main hand with slower speed to increase those sweet ambushes.
---
Mines was when doing sm library on my Allience priest upon leaving there was about 10-15 with majority horde ganking anyone coming out the instance I managed to dispell this mages frost nova and run out.
---
I thought I'd get revenge I snuck back up and mind controlled the mage that attacked me earlier and staffed some of the horde there and they all killed him instantly
---
Dominos is for sure the better of the two imo also!
---
&gt;Those things are explicitly harmful and perpetuate dehumanizing abuses of vulnerable populations.
---
As do all jokes where any person is the donkey. Comedy and tragedy are inseparable. Your argument kinda screams that individuals of a minority are somehow hurt more by these jokes than individuals of a majority, this doesn't hold true.
---
&gt;  the house run low on certain dishes for a bit 
---
My subjective take on that is that if communal office never has clean coffee cups because one scumbag keeps hogging them, that hurts me more than some joke making derogatory remarks about my ethnicity/sexuality. And that's my point, we shouldn't give them the time of the day, that only provokes further confrontation.
---
These people don't feel bad when you call them out, they feel empowered and validated. Everytime someone posts how trade/world is such a horrible mess of toxicity, they thrive on that.
---
2 questions:
---
1.	I’m a level 27 warrior who mainly plays solo due to my schedule. My goal is to do BFD to 28, RFK to 30 and to get brutal armour.  Then do SM to 32-33 and get my whirlwind axe by 35. Is this a good plan or should I be questing too? If so, what zone? 
---
2.	on the note of playing solo, that’s why I’m getting upgrades later. I think I’m finally getting the hang of WoW and would like to join a guild, is there any sites where guilds do recruitment?
---
It's up to you, really. We're also still in the early days, too. And we currently lack things like BGs which could see a rise in green-buying, I think. I personally tried selling an odd few greens myself, but none sold so I decided against it. I'm not sure if its a thing yet, but disenchanting them and then selling stacks of enchant mats could see more profit, without having to gauge what to sell your greens for.
---
I’m at 48 anger kills and never even seen hoj drop, seem everything else multiple times and that damn axe about 50%+ :(
---
It.. Doesn't? You'd be more than capable of tanking after a few low level dungeons in PuGs. They're harder to tank than raids.
---
Well played fellow guildie.
---
Nice! I must try this on my Tauren
---
No flame totem from shammy ?
---
I see both sides. Makes sense. People are a lot more relentless these days. I think back then we would do one or two BRD Arena runs at most. Now people train run that for hours on end. Didn’t meant to come into the discussion seeming stand offish. 😂
---
Mats usualy go lower than the sellprice of the green item
---
Random guy in Orgrimmar: Why are you giving me 12s 39c ?
---
OP: Just fucking take it, OK?
---
Instead of being a whiny retard and trying to get people banned how about utilising that infamous CLASSIC COMMUNITY to stop them?
---
You see how a group of people work together to accomplish an impressive goal?
---
Why don't you get you &amp; the rest of the firemaw people to put them in the dirt?
---
I heard about these so-called devilsaur mafias but I figured they wouldn't exist in actual classic because the bigger populations meant there'd be a bunch of rando's not in the mafia to kill them
---
Again, you dont understand it. It is not about the impact it has on me. I am a tank. I will always get what I want for that sole reason. This is about the impact it has on the player base as a whole.
---
Best pvp healer in the game
---
No, because getting 5 stacks up after 5 casts vs 8-10 is a lot of DPS. 
---
Lets say you get 5 stacks up after 5 casts (2.5 x 5 = 12.5 sec) vs 10 casts (2.5 x 10 = 25 sec). This means that during those extra 12.5 sec, about 50 more frostbolts has hit the target, which could have critted.
---
Yea that might be tricky!  Hunter here so pretty easy for me at lvl 39 :/
---
It depends. Spelldamage is generally better for Mages for ST leveling, but for AoE farming main stats are better. But even for ST leveling spirit is arguably the most important stat for mages, so that staff is a good choice. Hypnotic blade is insane though, and a lot of Mages that can‘t get the Scholo MH use it for raiding at 60.
---
You probably have swift fingers and good reaction times, and I commend you for that. I might be a bad player (an assessment I can live with) but I still want to improve, and making stuff easier does not only benefit me, but also the ppl I play with - be it in BGs/open pvp or in instances.
---
Not sure but usually 5/5 is advised (quick ramp etc.). With less points you could be forced to use low rank frostbolts from time to time to build stacks. Blizzard can't AoE while PvP usually won't last long enough for it to matter so if you want a compromise - don't pick it. Try maybe some other talents.
---
Most fair pvp game i have played atleast
---
To be fair every class besides rogues are pretty annoying to fight as a warrior.
---
Had a good laugh seeing that guy getting punted
---
Nah, you're correct. Damage on pets has been normalised, so the only real gain is pushback on cast bars, which is mostly a PvP thing.
---
I’ve recently downloaded auctionator. An add on that scans and stores auction house prices. When I mouse over an item it shows me the vendor price, the last AH price, and the disenchant price (average you can get from disenchanting and AHing the mats). This has since influenced my vendoring, AHing, or disenchanting decisions. I keep a secondary character at the mailbox in IF to send items to for disenchanting and auction selling.
---
Something about queuing the heroic strike will eliminate dual weild miss chance penalty, so can possibly queue up HS and cancel it right before MH swing to get better hit chance while dual wielding
---
A lot if not most of the preraid gear is better than what drops in MC for many classes, in some cases they are even BiS until Aq40 or beyond. HoJ, Jed trinket or the gladiator chest are just a few examples of this. Most players actually arent that crazy about getting FULL prebis, but they are going crazy about getting certain items which will stay BiS for atleast the next \~6-12 months.
---
No, with a good group you can easily do pug 17s without doing all the hardcore strat skips (just this particular example was S2 in a SotS involving a death skip, keep in mind).
---
Sometimes you have to try it, but I prefer going safe. Most of the times, you'll do just fine
---
Meanwhile I look homeless.
---
Ultimately you can level as whatever you want. It sounds like you might enjoy leveling as hemo because you get a lot of the utility in the sub tree while still being able to use swords/non daggers. Key issue is you don’t get your main CP generator until level 30....
---
Combat is the preferred leveling spec because it makes doing damage with suboptimal gear better. You gain hit%, weapon skills, bladefurry for when you pull too many, and AR if you need to down a big nasty faster. It’s just more damage that isn’t positional. Daggers requires you to be behind your target. After ambush as opener you’ll have to use some sort of CC to get behind again which slows killing down. Combat you just spam SS in their face, keep up SnD, and eviscerate otherwise. 
---
Pickpocket may be slightly easier with stealth talents making it so if you’re too low it might not be completely terrible and also make you move faster, but you’re then sacrificing all the combat killing quality of life talents for stealth quality of life that is ultimately a smaller portion of your overall wow playtime (assuming you quest more than pickpocket). 
---
Playing with a priest you’ll be able to pull more and deal with more as combat. If you had a warrior you could be dagger easier because he’ll be able to hold aggro so you can get behind. The beauty of a priest is that you don’t have to eat after each pull. You just go, kill kill kill, they heal, move on. Combat would again be better for this.
---
Again, do what you want, there’s just a reason everyone says go combat for leveling.
---
There is unique and there is just worse:
---
Boomkins, Ret pallies etc
---
They think he's serious when he called himself "literal level 2 God" when Classic started lmao.
---
Totally worth the distance as allies
---
3 people skinning, each had about 2 stacks of light and one stack medium leather
---
Tanks for WC are overrated. You can clean it up quite easily if you have mage/hunter/ lock in your group. Last time I cleared it with 2 hunters, 1 lock and 1 priest.
---
Yup this was what i ment
---
Well it's a waste of time. Just ask your guild mate to give you ez clap.
---
Do you care to elaborate? I only tried Fortnite once and failed miserably, but for my 16-year old son building, aiming, shooting, jumping and running is like second nature. I get dizzy just be watching him play.
---
Hearing "I don't have enough energy" x100 is a feeling that every rogue knows too well. Energy regen in classic is so sloooow
---
Steam link by the looks of it.
---
What’s the proper way not to go oom? Consumables and lower ranks of lighting bolt?
---
I’ve ran arm like 25 times and haven’t seen the ravager, does it even exist?
---
Dual wield is not that good until you get some hit-gear.. respecced at 50 this time around cause i was curious, and it was nowhere as effective as 2h arms.
---
Not necessarily what happened here, but you can make a new toon that's the same faction as them and whisper them.
---
But you are entirely wrong. 
---
Assuming 1 person truly needs it, then: 
---
- If every person in party presses need, the person who will wear it have a 20% chance of getting it
---
- If every person in party presses greed (again, every person, all of them, every single member - don't know if you want a better definition), the person who might wear it still has only a 20% chance of getting it
---
Me realizing that people changed more than WoW did.
---
I want to start playing again and I mainly want to PvP (alliance), not hardcore of course cause I'm an adult now with job and all. My friends have already rolled on an Zalandar Tribe RP-PvP (EU). I haven't played an RP-PvP before so I'm a little bit worried about the casualness of the server (I don't want it to be too casual PvP wise cause I like the challenge). I'm also worried the the server will have much lower population compared to a pure PvP server when the hype phase dies down. I'm also pretty indifferent about the RP aspect, neither like or dislike. My friends will also be super casually and they all play together few times a month, so I thought I would just roll an alt there to play with them but have my main character on a pure PvP server and avoid the worries, what do you think?
---
I also plan to roll a female model (because they look better as human caster) and I don't want creepy people assume that a female IRL too. I guess that's less of an issue on a pure PvP server right?
---
Feelsbadman
---
Wow that was a very informative post thank you
---
So if you are playing a human you have increased weapon spec for swords which is a big deal
---
Furthermore you pick up talents like Sword Spec which works only for swords
---
except hunters control their pets.. so it's not low iq pets, it's low iq hunters
---
Honestly Krol blade is pretty much pre raid best in slot for rogues and warriors, so putting crusader on it wasn’t a bad idea at all.
---
&gt;they removed the damage bonus from slow weapons 
---
No. They changed the formula so that a blue lvl 30 two-handed weapon always does the same damage while wirlwinding, be it a 3.8 speed weapon, or a 2.0 weapon. The only notable exception in warrior\`s arsenal is slam. If you\`re not doing a slam-spam build - weapon speed is not that important.
---
Sold one on Skeram A for 75g a week ago. I feel like they're worth a lot less now.
---
Who needs an addon?
---
Thats fine if you don’t have the weapon spec talents then consider mace mh too
---
I do just fine with duel wield. I have no problems since I spam heroic strike and sunder. HS has a lower chance to miss so it's great to spam, especially if you get crits. Yes there are times where you can miss 5 times in a row but the crits and attack speed make up for it. At least to me they do
---
Ive killed skulls with another player. Was also ganked by people 5 levels higher and me and my GF were able to 2vs2 them. Its all doable.
---
I was on for 2 hours last night and 11 people in my guild were online the whole time. I tried to talk to them and they ignored my guild chat messages. Nobody spoke for the whole 2 hours. Except 1 troll who just logged on to ask if anyone wanted to get shrekt and then logged out.
---
I think like 7/11 of them were just sitting in 2 different discord channels doing dungeons together. Just sad how antisocial people are in game.
---
You want everything to come out of other people’s pockets, and if it doesn’t that’s them being selfish?
---
Portals and consumables aren’t free my mans.

Razorgore
---
There is no tank in spellcleave and if there is, it's because the group is shit or in lbrs.
---
&gt; as opposed to gearing up DPS who can be replaced easily.
---
That is not always so easily
---
I'm not really saying he's a "good guy". We are only human, we all make mistakes, but I think everyone, especially those against him are really obsessed and are willing to spread the "bad examples" to anyone as possible. Which is why the reason why there aren't enough good examples from his streams. Personally, I've seen good examples, such as asmon living with his mom because she was sick and to help provide money. However, I disagree going as far as banning ninja looters from the game. That's the reason why we didn't have personal loot in classic. Ninja looting is just really looked down upon and a pain in the ass.
---
Not every adventure is fun or exciting, you need a contrast to appreciate the other end. The value of roads is elevated because off-road is packed with mobs that will daze you. It gives sub-zones identity and that's what makes the world immersive.
---
I'm guessing you're not much for immersion? Some of us get the main enjoyment from the feeling that the game world exists without us in it and that we're just one adventurer in it. The swamp and quests are not there for your enjoyment, everything does not benefit you and somethings are just a bad trade for you to pursue. This is important and without it the world feels hollow and boring, a themepark you see once and then move on much like the zones we nowadays get in retail. I'm not bashing retail, it's just a preference thing retail has failed to deliver in favor of non-stop individual excitement and fun.
---
Pssst. Revantusk.
---
Woah, easy there, chief.
---
I tried tanking with my druid (so this might be the cause right here) and my experience was:
---
OMG why is the hunter pulling?!
---
OMG the mob went after the healer and now I have to drag three mobs back that way with me!
---
OMG the hunter pulled one mob and the mage pulled the boss mob (and then consequently was the only one to die)!
---
OMG these guys are so damn impatient, give the healer a chance to drink!
---
OMG I can't tell if I have enough threat on all these mobs!
---
OMG where is my damn rage?
---
OMG why is the hunter's pet tanking?
---
Admittedly I probably stress easy. That run was actually quite decent, only two deaths and one was from a failed jump from a party member who landed in the lava in RFC, and the other was the mage when he pulled the boss mob.
---
I'd imagine tanking probably requires someone who doesn't panic too easily.
---
You should try to tank. More damage taken = more ss, ww, tc and cleaves. I outdamage the dps wars easily and usually everyone when tanking.
---
There is a lack of tanks in my server and when I see warriors looking for tanks in the Lfg channel it makes me question why don’t they tank their donjon. That’s a good way to learn to play warrior.
---
green item called ravager's mantle. And i think the scarlet boots
---
Listen man, i had a whole thing typed up to make fun of you, but im just gonna let you "win" because i dont need to spend any more time explaining to a new player why reserves are okay... enjoy "tanking" ZF or whatever dungeon ur leveling in right now. Please god i hope not to see you at 60
---
Not 1, like 3. after that i used sunder armor. Hs not only costs 15 rage, it will also make your next aa not generate rage, so the real cost is waaaay to high for the little added damage.
---
At 32(?) I learned slam (which is so much stronger than hs but it seems like nobody uses it. Never upgrade it, tho), and since then i am only upgrading ms, execute and battle shout. 
---
I learned berserker rage and all those skills, ofc, but most of the new ranks are useless while leveling. For example, the last rank of hs adds 27 damage and costs like 5g? Most of the time you wont have the rage to use it anyways. 
---
To not upgrade skills like overpower should be pretty clear, 10 damage is like nothing ....
---
Ug, I just did Gnomer for the first time in classic yesterday. I forgot how much time I used to spend in dungeons. Now I'm really dreading BRD in a few levels.
---
Who even rolls alliance anyway.
---
yeah, and the dead silence in chat haha
---
If a rogue rolls on caster gear after agreeing to loot rules where only casters can roll on caster gear, does that count as ninja looting?
---
I have this annoying bug that sometimes I can't click a button and even relog doesn't help - need to completely exit the game.
---
I appreciate the effort, but it's really difficult to read.
---
It's up to you ultimately. But these are players you are likely to see again, and they may remember you. I personally would prefer the memories of me to be positive.
---
I feel you, I don't usually start convos but I always answer when I see that no one else responded to someone.
---
you mean the bridge deathskip people have been doing since the first week? that saves a great amount of time especially on fort weeks? thats the "hardcore deathskip strat" that you a player who pugs 17s... couldnt do?... oh
---
No, socks
---
I never played a war in 15years. Last week was the right moment to give it a try. Is it normal that at lvl 15 I don't do dmg and it's really difficult to keep aggro? Which are the "spammable" skills that I should use while leveling? I'm doing a duo with a priest. I try to keep up always the battle shout, then I spam 4 skills: charge, sunder armor, the one that increase your dmg on the next attack and the counter attack. I've bought all green equip for my lvl. Thank!
---
Do they know that you can't just make a portal?
---
Vendoring is pretty fine mostly.
---
Pretty much all of the zones that go between 30-40 because none of the classes I play have any mobility skills and I start getting really impatient for my mount.
---
I enjoy slowly running around the world during the early levels but it wears me down after a while.
---
HULK give appropriate incentive for mages so they port him where he can SMASH.
---
Yeah that's why I say low level dungeons are harder. People are idiots and pull for you and then you have to get 110% of their threat to rip it back (without taunt of course). If you did it with a couple of friends for the first few runs until you got the hang of it, it would make you a bit more at ease. Druid has it a lot easier in dungeons though, just spam swipe.
---
My condolences for your loss, I will go to that bar on my server, and have a drink to your brothers memory.
---
\*mind blown\*
---
you legend
---
apart from Tanaris and Shimmering flats glow is better. but that two is literally a white screen
---
Great story, and very well told. This is exactly why I play. Thanks for sharing!
---
I don't really like being addressed as "buddy". Not sure why. It seems - I don't know, inappropriate familiar and a bit belittling.
---
SOCKS?!
---
i'm a lvl 26 mage, is it too early to do Monastery Cemetery ? (atlas loot says lvl 26-36)
---
It also makes some characters more memorable, because you keep going back to them. I've been to see Apothecary Lydon in Tarren Mill in connection with quests in Hillsbrad, stonetalon and the Hinterlands. Lorewise it reinforces that he's an expert in plagues and toxins, so it's worth going out of your way to see him.
---
This is probably the most cringey "I know I am wrong but I wont admit it" post I have ever seen.
---
YES SIR.
---
Thanks for the help mate, appreciated :)
---
Just retail-bred .. doesnt know how to handle helpful other players as he never encountered them before.
---
Y'all should play on rp servers we just talk
---
Stranger: Opens trade window
---
Me: closes trade window
---
Stranger: :O
---
I've been reporting people who spam lfg in the general chat and they're the only ones speaking so it's the same message one after another in the space of several minutes.
---
"Could I please have some water"
---
Mage: "I'm not vending machine specced"
---
Well, thase list was easy to predict even before classic release. I would even predict next step: classic+/tbc or it is dead. Because people.
---
Might have done it through extended options addon or leatrix?
---
Yes I believe there is a good macro for rogues that does pickpocket then cheap shot or ambush.
---
I have a bank alt that gets sent all of my none vendor goods everytime I pass a mail box, I also vendor at every possible opportunity, I try to knock out collect 10 x,y and z quests first. I also try to save myself 10 or so minutes to log onto my bank alt who I leave by the mailbox in ironforge and AH/disenchant or bank any goods he has been sent at the end of my session.
---
Some areas though, you can't help it as every question giver what's you to collect a million different items and unless you only do one quest at a time returning after each you will have inventory issues.
---
As a side note, any peices of gear I need to perform a role other than leveling I keep in my mains bank, usually if I'm grouping up to do a dungeon I'll have time to fly to a capital and swap sets as the group is forming, /4 LFG is a channel that often seems overlooked but it allows you to form groups without being in a capital on /2
---
As a beginner it still feels like an improvement over retail.
---
Welcome, looooooots of wierdos in this game, good to be aware of so you Dont be nice and get suprised when its not recipricated.
---
You are lucky bastard, dude! GZ!
---
I've got pre raid BIS on my warrior except for those 3 Items. They just never drop. The ring dropped once and all 5 people in the group rolled for it, ofc I lost the roll :(
---
In many class discords, there are pretty decent communities that discuss many of the points you list here. They theorycraft, discuss starts/nuances for bosses, etc. and you can tell a great many know each other from having part of that community for a while.
---
Sure, there aren’t lengthy discussions had in-game, but that wasn’t particularly present except from the first few months. A large majority of heavy talking happened on out-of-game forums and websites, even from early on.
---
What about Core Felcloth bag? It requires Bloodvine from ZG
---
Pro tip: only buy the spells you use. Don't buy everything that's available.
---
No, community was lost because the game became streamlined and hardships automated.
---
Things taking time to do, being legitimately gated by difficulty and not artificially, the world having authentic rules in place, etc. all combine to create a real place where you need to work together to achieve your goals.
---
I’ve met so many people and made so many friends and acquaintances, more than cataclysm to BFA combined.
---
I’ve been living in 2006 for 15 days played time of the last month, I feel bad that you’re not having as good of an experience.
---
Eh, I didn't have anyone rolling against me for the ring. Wanna know how? I make the group and simply don't bring classes that need the gear I want.
---
Do you use orbs or a staff
---
Well, at least it's out there. But definitely won't keep posting about it. Let's just continue to shit the subreddit with repetitive memes amirite?
---
At level 36 Warriors learn 'Whirlwind'.
---
It's the first ability which applies weapon damage instantly. Up till 36 warriors only have abilities which modify their next auto-attack. (They do have Overpower, but this isn't 'on-demand' since you need to wait for a dodge).
---
Once you get access to Whirlwind (and at level 40 Mortal Strike) you want to have as slow a weapon as possible. Those abilities deal 'Weapon Damage + X' so you want that Weapon Damage to be as high as possible, which means using as slow a weapon as possible.
---
Dustwallow became way more finished in TBC with the addition of mud sprocket and actual quests.
---
Something worth pointing out that I think a lot of people overlook is that, if you're tanking as a paladin you should have blessing of salvation on your entire party.
---
Yes, the healer wants wisdom and the rogue wants might but that's too bad, you're tanking.
---
An Alliance Boomkin was doing this for one of the questgivers at the inn.
---
I did slash target (npc name) and was able to turn in without getting killed. Man i love the STV shenanigans
---
You can just have your lock void tank her on the other side of the room and it’s cake
---
Isn't axe spec simply the best out of these 3 due to deep wounds and impale interaction for leveling, where one crit speeds up your ttk dramaticaly?
---
I think they dismiss it so easily so they don't have to entertain the idea that him or others like him might be right about other things too
---
Staff but if the orb is better then I'll get it
---
&gt;Read the post again, pls.
---
Kys
---
I sure do love Germany  after ww2
---
This aoe cleave fad has ruined dungeons for me as a mage. I just want to do single target damage while in a dungeon because it’s a lot smoother on the heals and tank which makes for a better dungeon experience.  But every group I’m invited to demands I blizzard or have improved blizzard.
---
VW sac is a one trick pony.  Yeah it might buy you some time, but after that it's done.  I'd much rather have seduce on hotkey if a rogue jumps on me to let me gain distance and apply dots/fear/drain life.  And after that I can have her chase him around with a whip for even more damage.  I played wow in vanilla, which is why I say that VW is a noob trap.  It seems like it should be your best friend while leveling, but it's really just not.  
---
And I don't know what you mean by multiple mobs, but unless you're talking about specialized situations like DM lasher farming, succubus/imp with drain tanking kills multiple mobs just fine.  Dot/fear the first mob.  Dot/death coil/fear the second mob.  Dot third mob, turn around and drain soul the first mob. Dead.  Drain life/drain soul third mob. Dead.  Dot/fear fourth mob, turn around and drain soul second mob.  Dead.  
---
You're literally killing things as fast as you can cast.  The idea that succy is for pure single target is just straight up wrong.
---
It reduces the range humanoid mobs will aggro from. So you can walk past them more easily
---
Prot doesn’t take +10 defense. Not a huge difference and get your point, just saying :)
---
You don't think it's kind of interesting that many of the largest gaming related youtube channels have reactionary views or flirt with white nationalist conspiracy theories? 
---
Or that gamergate had ties to both Dennis Prager (PragerU) and the Koch Brothers (AEI).
---
Or how Steve Bannon deliberately set out to cultivate many of the reactionary values we just coincidentally see in a lot of online gaming communities, subreddits and youtubers. 
---
"Even though the business plan was a flop, Bannon became intrigued by the game's online community dynamics. In describing gamers, Bannon said, "These guys, these rootless white males, had monster power. ... It was the pre-reddit. It's the same guys on (one of a trio of online message boards owned by IGE) Thottbot who were [later] on reddit" and other online message boards where the alt-right flourished, Bannon said."
---
This has always happened. People are greedy, always have been. This has nothing to do with a current generation. Probably you are just experiencing a different immediate personal context. Read: get a nice guild :)
---
What should my stat priority be while leveling a feral druid? I've seen some guides that say Strength is best while others say agi. and even others say Stam.
---
Also what is a good talent build while leveling a druid. I'm lvl 18 right now so I don't have much.
---
Can't use anti social and discord in the same sentence sorry.
---
The staff will be better if you don't have a one hander around
---
Mage here: I'd never join a group with two other mages and a caster healer, no matter how much you'd want me to.
---
Why would I willingly join a group where the chance of me getting a caster item like *Illusionary Rod* is 25%/33% as opposed to running a group with a 50% when it's me and a caster healer with hunter/rogue/warrior DPS?
---
Yes, I save a few minutes each run, but that doesn't really help my mental stability when the item I am here for is always won by another person.
---
A 50% chance is much better than a 25% chance, so I'll take it.
---
Hey if you never get attacked by 2 dudes you can never achieve greatness and kill them both.
---
Orb is better. Pair it with hypnotic blade from SM and it should last you until the staff from ZF
---
Your action "bar" looks like hell
---
He skinned a yeti first (being open to being faerie fired by the druid first). He was out of combat sooner than that. Then moved in after making it obvious he was about to fight the druid who just sat there. The druid had ample time to react correct?
---
Lowest level a Warrior can solo Gnomer, go!
---
butthurt horde player detected
---
Never experienced this in vanilla. Guildies donated mats and what not to help with raid progression.
---
ok, ill give them a go, the enemies seemed  really buff in some of them but  with potions it could be probably done
---
I don't, I tank all the time, I'm fury
---
It's mostly a skill thing
---
I had a lvl 90 hardcore sorc named the warden and would kill everybody trying to bot to 99, the memories.  Had accounts full of ears at one point.
---
Hahahahaha you thought me something new with that one!! Hahhaa
---
Well, the best healing-build is the moonglow-spec with 24-0-27 or 25-0-26.
---
Talents that might aid your leveling are Imp-Thorns, Omen of Clarity and to some extend Nature's swiftness and Insect-Swarm.
---
But as your edit suggests: Tanks are what's difficult to find. But surprisingly enough I still went to most instances as a healer too. Simply because the level-restrictions aren't as harsh which gives you a wider window for going there. You can visit instances as a healer where as a tank or dps you wouldn't really have any business due to the level discrepancy to the mobs. But can't really miss those heals.
---
I also want to eventually spec for healing but I'm not even sure if I stay feral at 60 and heal as feral still. MC is supposedly quite easy and noone may notice my lack of healing and I can still tank all the 5 mans.
---
Yea they’re so common and worth nothing lol
---
I was hoping that pyroclasm can hold monsters decently well, but the stun chance being on the whole duration makes it super bad.
---
I'm thinking the ways locks can provide value in a spellcleave group: curse of weakness if you have a tank, eye of kilrogg for some pulls, the usual soulstone for tank or header, pulling mobs with the pet (although I have never seen this being done), and the usual aoe with rain of fire / hellfire.
---
But without good CCs for warlocks, mages are king for spellcleave
---
This group comp seems to be doing very well by running 2 locks (and using curses of weakness and elements) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7n7wYl8tn0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7n7wYl8tn0), but given how well the tank is holding aggro, I suspect it is before the demoralizing shout nerf. Post demoralizing shout, it seems it's better to hold mobs with nova.
---
Nah that is fine. i mean i know you are just trying to see a situation where this is possible and that is fine. I mean i dont accept random battlenet invites so for me its just hard to believe.
---
Eh I'd just give him a note warning people, and if there are complaints I'll handle it then.
---
&gt; Ohh he used a potion too. A dirty potter.
---
imagine being this jaded
---
It most certainly does NOT work. 'sitcrit' was a private server bug.
---
2. The official forum has a guild section, you can look for your realm there. Else, ingame recruitment is not a bad way!
---
Dustwallow just feels like they threw shit everywhere
---
That sounds like a pretty solid plan to me.  If you're having trouble with getting everything you need for WW axe, don't get too hung up on it.  Lots of people substitute the axe from RFK for it ( [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6687/corpsemaker](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6687/corpsemaker) ) since it drops frequently and doesn't require as much effort.  If you want WW axe for a status symbol, by all means knock yourself out.  Don't be afraid to bust out a level just by grinding every now and then, especially if you find that all of your quests out level you.  If you finish a quest hub, and you still have 1/3 or a level to go, its a good idea occasionally to just find some comfortable mobs to grind the rest of the level on.
---
What wrong assumptions? It's pretty clear why you are so upset at a video game. Ill break it down again.
---
Group A Reserves HoJ Because The leader only wants people who will not roll on it in his group.
---
Player Named Vandegroen sees this group LFM and decides to go make a reddit post about how unfair and shitty it is to reserve items. Self admits to it not affecting him but being outraged anyway because of how it "affects the playerbase as a whole". When called a zoomer says "lol cringe". And calls everyone else entitled.
---
Do you see the irony? like any of it?
---
You are literally outrage culture, go wipe more in zf
---
What has that to do with it? The Pattern is still available.
---
Having a bunch of shadow dmg also allows you to down rank your life tap if necessary because you're getting more mana back from it
---
Sounds like someone got ganked by a pvp ret pally.
---
Exactly, 18 hours spent on farming something else is like 500g in itself minimum.....
---
Funny, cause I see Paladins tanking everything when you move away from the “meta” about Paladins being unable to tank.  Guilds are downing raid bosses with Paladin tanks just fine, unless they’re streamer-stans who scream it isn’t possible because someone told them it couldn’t be done.
---
I would rather just ignore everything. dont comment ( oh the irony) or upvote it. until attention is given, its there
---
Lore was ruined with what they did to Kael’thas and Illidan, giving alliance shamans, adding Draenei, etc
---
Found the stereotypical neckbeard.
---
    #showtooltip
---
will make the macro show the tooltip &amp; icon of the first active skill/item etc. after that line. Alternatively you can:
---
    #showtooltip YourSkillNameHere
---
to always show the tooltip for that skill.
---
This can make a difference if you have a macro for different skills:
---
    /cast [@target,exists,nodead,harm] SpellA; SpellB
---
Here the tooltip will show SpellA if you have a hostile unit as your target, but will show SpellB otherwise.
---
Record from 1 to 60 is 4 days and 20 hours, so 116 hours.
---
Classic has been out for a month(?) Assuming you play every day and are a world record leveler you are playing at minimum 3 hours and 50 minutes a day.
---
That's 25% of your waking day playing WOW. That's... a lot.
---
Can you post the macro? The one I got online only seems to work once out of a few tries.
---
An entite generation of mages made up of people who rerolled after watching Jokerd hit 60.
---
And now fight eachother in the same spots for AoE packs
---
It's a matter of situation and preference.  For dungeons I'll use succy with just auto-attacks to conserve mana for dark pact and an occasional seduce, but will switch to imp on passive with phase shift for situations where mob aoe will occur and the succy will get two shotted.
---
For questing its even more preference.  Imp on passive with fire shield and acting as a mana battery is the easiest way to go.  Succy with auto-attacks only to conserve mana is also good, plus you have a seduce on tap in case you get jumped.  With succy you just need to remember to switch her off whatever mob you're drain soul'ing so you get the last hit for mana regen.
---
Extended Options and Leatrix aren't graphical mod specific, they just give the options which used to be in the default panel, and that can still be accesed through slash commands, an in-game UI.
---
Maybe NVidia is able to regulate these ? They are quite generic graphical rendering properties.
---
What are the forked tongue used for?
---
Imagine the total gold if you skinned them.
---
Well doing it in an efficient manner is not waiting next to NPC for several hours or buying a pattern for 60g....
---
Yeah I just don't always play with sound on for various reasons
---
Yeah i would love the option!
---
Sucks that they ruined the lore that you created then..oh wait...you didn't...dip.
---
&gt; Also how does respec cost work ?
---
1st respec 1g, 2nd 5g, 3rd 10, 4th 15, etc. up to 50g. The price gradually drops back down to 10g if you haven't respecced in a while.
---
not if they pay more accounts.
---
Desolace prob my least favorite.  I don’t ever level there and try to stay out as much as possible, everything is so far from the fp (horde) and it’s just not visually pleasing
---
Sword spec is almost as good, cause more swings means more crits. And together with human +5 sword weapon skill (reduced misses) it gives you a slight edge over axe.
---
It’s probably something like:
---
/cast [stance:1,nocombat] Charge;
---
/cast [combat] Berserker Stance;
---
/cast [stance:3] Intercept;
---
/cast [nostance:1,nocombat] Battle Stance;
---
I don’t use this myself and I’m in the bathroom at work on my phone so I might have done some errors, but it might work:)
---
Edit: the formatting on my phone is really bad
---
Charging more than the AH price just because you are in the instance is completely greed .
---
My favorite is when you wait 15 min for that one player and then when they finally get to the instance “sorry cat woke up I g2g”
---
I think the reason i would like the runecloth bag recipe is because I'm literally drowning in runecloth from so many BRD runs and i would love to start making bags for my guildies.
---
The price will go down, I'm sure.
---
the point is not doing A (as in one) full run
---
if you found a good group you spam that for hours
---
I'm so sorry for your loss. I just logged out of the game in Brill so I'll be sure to grab a drink in honor of your brother's memory!! FOR THE HORDE!
---
I was trying to figure this out last night as well and it looks like they do the same damage per second although different speeds and damage. If slower they hit harder and of faster they hit softer. 
---
It’s my understanding that people like faster as it might hold aggro better and cause pushback for casters. 
---
I got a Savannah Patriarch (1.3 speed) last night and am now curious how exactly Cower works...
---
&gt;In allowed to walk up to you in public and call you a cuckold rotten dickface. Doesnt mean it is fine
---
This is more comparable to calling someone rotten dickface in chat, not to /spit and /rude. Calling someone rotten dickface is way worse imo
---
If you cant handle a little /spit and /rude, you shouldnt be playing online games at all because thats like the least "dickish" behaviour you can encounter.
---
The claw? I love it
---
I’m not sure, currently at work as well so I can’t check for another 6Hr~ I’m sure I adjusted something in the video settings, my memory can’t be *that* bad, surely.
---
Műfaszú will work tho
---
One soon-to-be-player's (starting next week) question regarding the recent NinjaLoot drama: (plus a little thought ahead)
---
First of all, I very much adore how the community lashes out against this kind of behaviour. From what I see here and what I hear my friend tell me about his in-game experience, there seem to be plenty of nice and sensible people audible in the community. Looking foward joining!
---
**Now onto the question:**
---
Is there any difference between [Need] and [Greed] looting, in the sense if everyone does the same?
---
From what I see and understand, its identical, except need takes precedent over greed. If the desired concept in the scenario is that they want it to be fair, and eliminate the dual-layer from the equation, wouldn't it make sense for leaders to declare 'all roll need' instead, so that nobody can skip the line like in this incident? Or is there something else that would not make it work?
---
Like, I'd definitely have a lingering suspicion if they just make everyone vote the lower bracket and base it on trust, instead of just 'okay, everyone roll need so its all fair' and be done with it. Then again, I may not understand something regarding the system so that may be it...
---
4-5 days played to 60 is beyond efficient, I'd say that's "hardcore speed leveling" territory.
---
So as a Pally I should charge to buff people ? 
---
No thanks I will keep buffing anyone I can as I pass them.
---
And apologies if I miss you - it is not through lack of trying.
---
A warlock has a free shard unless it takes something else to summon people?
---
Also when did it become a bad thing for people to charge for a service?
---
Neither of those things have anything to do with anything I said lol.
---
Artificial gating is things like weekly top ilvl gear and titan residuum cache casino + artifact power farming with weekly artifact knowledge.
---
Sure mythic raids qualify as community building but literally as you just stated, 1% of people lol. And those people rarely go outside of the confines of their guild groups.
---
If you want to kill Hogger at level 9 as a non warlock, you better find 1-2 more people that need him, and then who knows, maybe you quest with that person for another 2 hours. 
---
Nothing in Retail facilitates that type of interaction as you can do everything automatically, or the click of a button groups you with some random person from some random server that you don’t think you’ll ever see again so there’s no point to invest a few lines of chat to even say hello.
---
Probably 50ish Ide say for lesser downtime between pulls? You could probably do it 40ish but it would take a while.
---
I rushed to 60 pretty quick, and I got 2 black diamonds... was curious if these had any on the AH(I know they are basically worthless)
---
Anyways it was going for 2 gold because onlyn4 were up! I jokingly put 2 up for 1 g a piece. And the SOLD. 
---
Luckiest druid on Herod
---
People like you just simply suck. You've probably never known true loss and how valuable it can be to share your loss with others and to hear their stories, sympathy, condolences, and love. Either that or you internalize your shit differently than him which is perfectly fine but no reason to tell him that's he's doing anything wrong or assume he's doing it for points.
---
I'm glad he posted this personally because it reminds me of the people and pets I've list throughout my life and puts me back in the memories of things like this story that I had with them.
---
In short, be a better person to those around you or keep your shitty opinions to yourself.
---
Even with this turned off it's too bright for me in some places like Tanaris but atleast we have the option.
---
Now if someone could help me disable the red flashing aggro effect if you aggro something on your mount or while having a map opened I would be very thankful!

---
We currently have open raid positions for  3 resto shaman, 2 rogues, 1 hunter, 1 warlock, 1 mage, and 1 resto druid.  We also have a waiting list if your desired class is full.
---
Raid Times: Wed/Thurs/Fri
---
PST 7AM-10AM
---
EST 10AM-1PM
---
Please visit our Discord server to apply.

Us horde can’t be butthurt or trolled. We have the trolls. 
---
Blizzard has been trying to troll horde since vanilla by nerfing us or messing with our lore (garrosh, sylvannas)
---
Honestly, people who start a group and try to reserve loot are annoying as fuck. If you wanna reserve loot, run it yourself
---
If you mean just questing... How many 60s do you have? There is no way to have 2k without playing the Auction House and finding a good niche in your servers economy
---
That mage is probably the worst I’ve seen.
---
Had a 60 undead rogue try to jump me on my 56 lock and Death Coiled him he ran into Overmaster Pyron aggro'ing him and yanked him into a group of Horde when he tried to run away.
---
As I understand it, for pve, attack speed is irrelevant, dps-wise. The faster pet will hit for less, and the slower pet will hit for more. Ultimately, the dps will average out to be the same. Though there is something to be said for Intimidation landing quicker, and frenzy uptime with a faster attack speed pet. 
---
For pvp, attack speed matters, when looking at pushback versus spellcasters.
---
What? I've literally seen a toon called Adobe and their pet called Photoshop. 
---
I can't recall what but I know I've seen a few odd brand names around.
---
Vendoring Wicked Claws? They don't sell on your server?
---
Clearly you were not playing optimally
---
All pets in a pet family (cats, bears, turtles, ...) Do the same damage. Faster pets do less damage per hit than slower pets, but they hit more often.
---
As a beastmaster you can skill 'Frenzy' (chance to gain 30 % attack speed after a critical hit), which gives faster pets a slight advantage.
---
But who plays beastmaster at lvl 60 anyway?
---
When the mage starts a pack by blasting AOE, I can't really get aggro if i'm not generating enough rage. And I can protect a group with a dead mage...
---
I see you assumed they are a priest because they said healer huh? Haha :D 
---
Anyway, you certainly can do that but it's harder depending on the class because you have to cut out more competing classes for similar gear. Priest has to fight all cloth wearers because they're all spell casters, and even other classes will roll on cloth items for a healing off-role. Compare that to warrior, after 40 you only compete with Paladins for plate gear. If you're a Horde warrior you are literally the only plate wearing class on your faction so you can build any group without another warrior and you're good to go.
---
Did a pally bend you over and wreck your horde bhole?
---
I recently read about "rogue tanking" back in Vanilla:
---
&gt; Rogue tanking relied on maxing out avoidance (100% avoidance) by having enough agility to get 100% dodge. Making them unhittable.  
---
&gt;This was changed in 2.3 when Blizzard hard capped it since it made tanking trivial. 
---
Is this in Classic?
---
Imagine being a healer complaining about a staff that has a huge drop rate in a dungeon that a healer can join spellcleave for and clear in &lt;20 minutes.
---
Ret paladin is the best, yes everyone calls you a meme spec and you drink lots.
---
But now I can stand proudly and say I'm the only ret paladin on my server to kill Onyxia and Ragnaros.
---
Do you think at Hunter 45 will be taken to Marauden to get this bow?
---
Not a lot of people are that high lvl yet, despite what you might think.
---
From what I've seen here and there, I'd say the average lvl for people now should be around 45, which is very far from 57.
---
I say give it a couple more weeks and you'll have no problem at all finding a guild for you. Of course this is all dependent on your server's population health.
---
Auction House isn't part of it and once layering is gone you'll see prices skyrocket.
---
&gt;You should not vendor everything. Try selling things on weekends as more people play. If it doesn’t sell in two tries just vendor it. Install a auction add on to help you
---
This so much so.  TSM or Auctioneer will help. I have set up a Bank toon with TSM and Auctioneer on it. The toon is an Enchanter so if the Green does not sell after two tries I DE it for Enchanting mats.
---
Except tanking stuff like UBRS without it being a shitshow still requires tank gear.
---
If you're a DPS warrior, you haven't put in time getting decent tank gear.
---
What faction?   Alliance, I think duskwood would be good.   Or if you haven't done it, wetlands.    Or if you are horde, probably stonetalon, barrens.....or barrens
---
I’m confused by this post.
---
It could have gained some traction before Classic but now it’s made your argument just a head scratcher. 
---
Classic ‘suffers’ from all the points you made but it’s community is FAR better than anything I found in retail or any other modern MMO for that matter.
---
1000 is far too low for jim
---
Heartbreaking and warming at the same time. So sorry for your loss mate, I'll travel there and have one too for both of you as soon as I get home although I'm alliance.
---
!RemindMe 6 Hours
---
You are running with the wrong crowd.  My guild is feeding all the mats to the professions that need them, clearing content without a hint of greed, and generally just enjoying the damn game.
---
All you people who think it is so easy to rank in arms spec must have crazy geared healers. I would rank the FIRST. Half of UBRS if we needed because I know they aren’t idiots and our healers have amazing gear. Even with those factors I take crazy damage and it usually takes all their mana to heal me. 
---
Now why would I go through that for a random pug of people I don’t know. Especially when they never asked me to in the first place until the leader decided it was suddenly my problem and not the others or his. I’m not willing to take the chance that I will just die constantly for random people. It would just be miserable for them too because if I die, they might die, and not to mention the fact the dungeon will just take longer. 
---
The game isn’t about getting forced into roles. you should be able to play any way you want to play. Not everyone is going to agree with my decision, and that is fine. However, that does not mean you get to be toxic to someone who doesn’t want to do what you wanted them to.
---
Under sounds, believe it's error speech.
---
you plan to spend 100g in ah for the gun. for 10g people will boost you through maraudon princess run.
---
Damn guys, I get bored after 10 minutes of killing quest mobs to loot quest items, I can't imagine myself killing the same mobs, in the same zone, for straight 10 hours.
---
Would you take improved flamestrike or improved fireblast btw? Or both
---
You get it .
---
I'll start charging to summon ppl to the raid .
---
It'll be a while before death knights are put in
---
A gnome telling a Horde druid in bear form to "Hug me like you love me" smack dab in the middle of shimmering flats.
---
As an enchanter... no
---
Have you tried doing “battle of darrowshire” yet lol?  Shit been bugged since vanilla
---
DAMN SON, WHERE'D YA FIND THIS?
---
Depends on your realm.  Herod has more people around our level while newer realms don't have as many that rushed to endgame.
---
I think I'm not entirely sure if we're talking about the same thing now.
---
What server?
---
Or why are you whining?
---
Same happened to me but it was 25g! I would definitely have noticed ;)
---
It's pretty complex overall. [Here are *some* formulas](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Rage)
---
I see, ok yea, I think you're right then, thanks.
---
I did the same then realized i was in the wrong cave.
---
Necrosis is good for nightfall - icon comes up that you can position wherever you want on the screen, and also writes a message to the chat
---
I’ve never played rogue.  Would you explain what you mean?
---
i'm 60 Priest, levelled to 57 as Shadow, much faster, also healed every dungeon with zero problems.
---
Deep holy now
---
uBRS is not a early game dungeon, and tactical mastery does not mean you can withstand level 60+ elites deleting you. Just being in defensive stance is not enough to mitigate that much damage. Some people do fury but that is because they have talents built to heal them. I am willing to rank for my guild in dungeons, who I know I can trust, especially my healers. How ever I am not going to “face roll” UBRS with a random pug and risk leaving with a massive repair bill and an unfinished instance. 
---
Plus consumables are expensive. If you bring a bag full of consumes to every UBRS run your either rich, or crazy.
---
Of course, may I get his character's name? Not trying to make you sad. I'd just like to do the toast properly. I understand a brother's love... if you want you can PM me his name. If you don't want it being public
---
Fuck asmon
---
He’s a paladin.
---
Try and put corruption on all targets in a dungeon for nightfall procs. CoA on targets that will live long enough (so NOT the tanks target).  Then just shadow bolt/wand main target.
---
It took me a little over 200 kills on one char, and less than 10 on my second. It's like a 2% drop rate so it evens out.
---
If a tank dies and an add is running lose, then yes I would expect the druid to jump into bearform and taunt the add if necessary.
---
Out of the 7 attempts on Ragnaros last night I think the tanks started the fight 3 times. The rest was someone aground the boss. Wiped at 5% lol and we called it a night.
---
Yeah I realize I should of cc'd and bandaged haha. Luck was on my side for the last auto Dodge.
---
Sure, in someone else's group. If you intend to reserve loot in my dungeon, then you are requesting that I permit it. As a tank, I'll hit up /4 with lf1m dps g2g.
---
&gt; sitting in 2 different discord channels doing dungeons together
---
So they are socialising, just not with you I guess?
---
I should have bandaged while he was blinded.
---
actually very low level quest when you leave the valley of trials and the orc wants you to bring food back to razor hill --- he calls you a hero right of the bat.
---
So you take down a post for having a lively debate about loot etiquette because it might violate a rule in the process, but leave a post like this up saturated in RL political debate? Ok moderators...
---
Asmon and Mconnell disagree all the time, that's pretty much their shtick- their routine. So your "fact" of likely no punishment is not as strong as you think.
---
Until I get one shot by a warrior at 60.
---
Indeed.  TLDR: Cruelti is a dumb basement dweller who starts raging the instant someone doesn't agree with him on reddit.
---
It's easier for me to click on them. That's really it haha.
---
That's just basic psychology. People are more likely to be dicks if they think they'll get away with it.
---
Except the frogs did stop producing male organs. 1 in 10 or something.
---
to be fair I have seen so much acceptance for paladin tanks recently, even in "high lvl" (+55) I am positively amazed by this
---
It works but is no longer reliable. In private servers, whenever you were sitting you were guaranteed to be crit and that crit would proc abilities.
---
Currently if you get crit while sitting no abilities will proc, but due to server lag and other things if your character is standing up when the crit registers it can proc the different abilities. IMO don't go prot unless you are tanking, reckoning is good, but not good enough at this point for leveling.
---
For dungeons, absolutely. Also SM/Ruin is the go to for end game content at the moment, simply because you are more useful outside of raids. The only thing you lose is the draining aspect.
---
No, you're just alliance and haven't spend 20 hours levelling in the Barrens.
---
Sometimes yes, I do in fact. It's good to encourage and show good morale with your comrades.
---
Get it as early as possible so it lasts a while. Toss a nice enchant on as well since you don't need mount money.
---
I also sometimes get 1g or something like that for just 20 water.
---
Normally filling it up with 120 bottles then.
---
Also EU pvp (Lucifron)
---
[https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/paladin-class-overview](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/paladin-class-overview) This is a good link also.
---
Hello there, haha.
---
In my case its not an item its basically any Item. Im running Dungeons with every Group i can get in for 2 weeks straight now. Saw 3 Items dropping so far. Baron Cape went to an Enh. Shaman, Blackcrow for the Tank (thats fine) and Dal'Rend lost the roll versus a Hunter (lmao). Very frustrating experience so far.
---
Oh go fuck yourself, dickbag.
---
Cool?
---
&gt; If tanking didn't require serious skill
---
lol
---
All i use is steam link!
---
No, the roles of the dungeon are Tank, Healer and DPS; not water boy.  You should ask nicely or bring your own food.
---
Holy crap.  The dumb is strong with Cruelti.  LOL
---
But seriously,  cruelti, time to get outside.  Breath some fresh air in, maybe look in the mirror,  brush your hair and teeth,  tell your mother that despite being 31 you promise you'll start looking for your own place soon.  And then take a dose of reality in.  YOU are not always right.  YOU can learn from others.  YOU can take a second to think about both sides of the coin (aka a debate you just had with Vandegroen).  And he certainly isn't wrong.
---
Also, the only irony I see is "you are literally outrage culture" except the only one expressing outrage here is you buddy!
---
This! This is the bread and butter of being a pally.
---
If you need to, just do groups for the different parts till they complete.
---
Youre gona be running it a lot
---
It's 25-35g hour in raw blue drops. 
---
You can also sell ring runs for 25g+ (depending on server).
---
If your herbalism, you can get a good amount of ghost mushrooms.
---
Like a lot of the other people in these comments I'm gonna make my way to gallows end when I get the chance and have a drink in his memory
---
And then if I instantly die every pull that’s more than 3 mobs is that for the good of the group? Just because tanks are hard to find doesn’t mean every warrior has to be charitable and give my time and repair bill to the community. Especially when half a DPS warriors pre raid BIS is leather gear.
---
Suck in pve, nukes in pvp
---
Skeram?
---
Yeahhh, I'm not very organized.
---
Understandable, I am certainly not new to classic wow. I just have never really healed raids before in classic.
---
I am sure he has as much respect for his brother as much as anyone who has lost a brother or a loved one.
---
You should maybe learn how to be a decent human and have empathy towards *others*.
---
I'm 56 priest and my guild took me full strat run then said if I need moon cloth just ask and they will supply mooncloth for my true faith vestments. Its defo people around you.
---
Haha, thanks mate!
---
Then get your tanking gear, what the fuck are you doing with that Plate drops from dungeons? Greed? Need and vendor? As a tank you are sole plate user in a group, gathering tanking gear is piss easy.  
---
As a Arms tank I have my main tanking eq with def and shit, also have some dps items (further from bis) - if someone want me to dps ill just swap my shit around, slap 2h or dw and go as a dps.  
---
You should do the same other way around. That's just being lazy.
---
&gt;st is a lovely server. Only met pleasant people there :P
---
dreadmist represent!
---
There is no universal value for items in wow.  The value depends completely upon what your market will pay for it.  Having said that, Archaic Defender is a 2h sword with a defensive stat, which is generally useless.  There are a lot of items like this in classic, the stats don't make sense.  If this was a staff or a mace, it would be a good feral druid weapon, but it is a sword.  The only ones who can equip it are hunters, paladins, and warriors.  Pallies and warriors can equip shields so the + defense isnt needed on a 2h weapon.  It is probably worth more to disenchant honestly.
---
I use the addon Spy to track people who have done me wrong.  Series of players who are on my Kill on Sight list that I can keep easy track of.
---
The amount of warriors that gank players after getting this weapon is so high. STV was a war zone between me and this warrior.
---
There's no difference at all, it is based on every player being honest. You roll need if you're going to immediatly equip the item, greed otherwise (2nd spec, disenchanting, AH, vendor...). All rolling need just guarantees noone steals the item.
---
Keep in mind rolling need on an unneeded item is not ninjalooting according to Blizzard's definition, and is not bannable.
---
You're 100% on the money, asking everyone to roll greed takes a good amount of trust and non-assholes to be present. If everyone needs, nobody is able to cheat the system.
---
I agree, it's very tough, but I deff had to blind the shammy.
---
Why are you entitled to other peoples time though? If you don’t agree to the terms you can just join a different group or make your own?
---
Why do I have to let a dps shaman roll on the healing gear I need? Why is he entitled to be in my group in the first place?
---
Have to ask: how exactly does someone "ninja" if group loot is turned on? And why would you run a dungeon *without* it turned on? 
---
Also, would this be a case of "LF DPS - item XYZ reserved" only for the person you ended up inviting rolling on, and winning, the item (which I think is fair, btw - they helped you get the opportunity for it to drop in the first place, so it's fair game)?
---
\#showtooltip Charge    
---
/use [stance:2/3,nocombat] Battle Stance; [stance:1,nocombat] Charge; [stance:1/2,combat] Berserker Stance; [stance:3] Intercept
---
I don't like it though. If you spam your abilities like I do, you'll end up using Charge and then immediately switch to Berserker Stance because you are now in combat.
---
I mean if you sit a chimpanzee behind the wheel of a high end sports car, not much is going to happen.
---
Retail conditioned people along with “ meta “ culture to believe the weight of someone’s capabilities is heavily tied to specific builds and classes when I reality player function has a lot do with the success of something.
---
People are so quick to chase the nice and easy they don’t ever give themselves a chance to experiment and succeed with something that they themselves put work in to, all they want is that quick hit of instant gratification ( see the explosion of mage players ).
---
Good gear does not correlate to good player in vanilla, and that’s the beautiful thing, a boosted idiot is still a boosted idiot.
---
You are safe on the roads ... right?
---
PvE servers, or roll horde on a PvP server.
---
What a fuckin goober lmao.
---
Does anyone have a quick guide/rule of thumb for what stat combos on items are useful for classes? I don't even need which are for which classes, it's just because when I get green items 'of the boar', 'of the whale' etc I never know which ones are worth selling on AH.
---
I'd guess like stamina + strength? Agility + intellect? I don't know what goes well with spirit. Stuff like that. Thanks in advance :)
---
Are you English by any chance
---
[Egan's Blaster](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13289/egans-blaster) quest item for a quest in Stratholme
---
Hahaha, so good. That reminded me of the Skyrim videos of the frost giants sending people to the moon.
---
Whoops forgot to say, Horde, I guess Stonetalon and lower Barrens? What’s my next zone? Ashenvale?
---
This is exactly why I am playing.  The best stories are the ones we create with the people around ( and sometimes against) us. That's what differentiates a game like this from other games where we are merely riding along in the story that has been written for us.
---
I'm an enchanter so I just disenchant them *unless* I know I can get a nice profit off of auctioning them.
---
Most guilds will also have tons of blue gear, full 60s, and consumables. Easily making up for any "skill."
---
50g at 35 you're sitting pretty.  Just keep doing what you're doing and you'll be fine.
---
Any good mobs in the late 20s early 30s that have decent drops I can vendor?
---
The problem is: Every warrior and most combat rogues can "cleave", but only warriors, paladins or shamans with a Ravager can do actual and consistent "aoe".
---
Thats why you shouldnt mix up the definitions of cleaving (hitting additional/nearby targets -&gt; cleave, blade flurry, sweeping strikes) with aoe (hitting potentially unlimited targets in a usually larger area -&gt; blizzard, rain of fire, consecration, ravager).
---
They could of tuned it up as a 'surprise' for those guilds racing for that MC cleared first :)
---
You truly are that dense. The person who equips it would roll need. The people who would sell it would roll greed.
---
But he's the best healer in the game?
---
Does WF heal people? I'm confused.
---
I know exactly what you mean with it being bittersweet. Every zone is full of memories.
---
In a way I think we're lucky to have this to help us remember time we spent with people we loved but it hurts so damn much at times and for me it's almost confusing because I have grieved and I have mourned but this feels fresh.
---
I hope your memories of her can bring you some of the joy you remember from those times, it's really nice that she took the time to appreciate something just because it mattered to you. That is pure love!
---
Basically just cooking yourself and guildies food buffs that are out rn, there are only so many recipes out that are worth making and won’t be better ones till later phases
---
&gt; This is one of the edgiest player bases I’ve ever met.
---
I agree to a certain point. Over the weekend I started a new Alliance char and had three incidents of outright bad behaviour in two days. And completely out of the blue things that could have been easily solved by just talking to people.
---
Once I was accused of "tag-stealing" when I simply didn't see the warrior running to the field from behind the house, once was a healer and his DPS friend digging into me for five minutes when I rolled on (and won) the "healing" Emberstone Staff without them mentioning anything about loot locks. Last time was someone calling me a "greedy bastard" for suggesting I could trade 60 food and 60 water for some of his linen or wool to level my professions.
---
I've not had so much non-RP related toxicity in two years of returning to retail than I had in two days in vanilla.
---
I love the game, but man, this game has a lot of nutjobs.
---
Nope! All into disc and it's fine! 5 into improved wand dmg
---
I've never seen that a big stick upon somone's ass.
---
Good points, someone also pointed out good guilds will just chain pull the raid. I will want mp5 to reduce my time spent drinking. Thanks for an actual answer!
---
And then everyone clapped!
---
As a warrior, seeing his desperate tries to use Frost Nova and it just won't work is a joy for salty eyes.
---
Then you are not killing mobs fast enough and not using your resources to the max.

QUESTION: Im stuck while I am dead what the fuck do i do
---
LF 10x10 printout for my office.
---
No that's the guy whose wife is missing.
---
Yep, couple of herbs that were going for single-digit silvers are now 3-4 times that amount.
---
You can even use that while leveling a warrior or rogue by sitting right before the next tick and then continue running since health regen happens every 2 seconds.
---
I tried it and it helps but is super annoying to do, but if you want to minmax leveling it is something.
---
I can’t  imagine what someone who doesn’t understand wow thinks when they hear it over and over.
---
Download a threat meter addon and incorporate FD into your rotation so you don't steal aggro from tanks.
---
Talking about your feelings is good and I appreciate you sharing the story.
---
He called himself sophisticated. Dear god if he only knew we could see all his posts xD
---
OP got that snowflake syndrome.
---
I picked Hunter because this is my first WoW character (ever) and it's simar to a class I played in a different game....3/4 of the level 60s in my guild are hunters. So much for less competition
---
Thanks, my question tho was *what level* can I obtain the quest at.
---
15 Blood petals.
---
I spent 10 hours trying to get Helcular's Rod...
---
This is still there and still unused in retail, but you can't simply swim up the coast anymore, there's invisible walls. The only way to get there (afaik) is to bug yourself into an uninstanced version of Stratholme and fall through the floor.
---
If you want to be holy for holy-nova, then don't be. :o
---
Being holy while leveling is mostly for people who want to do mostly dungeons and be a little quicker for heaving to take fewer mana-breaks.
---
The cool thing about the priests holy-tree, when compared to healing-specs of other classes is, that it can boost damage quite well with talents you take anyways for healing and have to spend basically only 2 points ontop of that for more damage.
---
Sounds like you need to find a more social guild man, its a big world of warcraft out there, and you don't always luck out on your first few tries.  Just keep looking and you'll eventually find some like minded friends.  Took me essentially the entire Legion expansion to find my current guild, and they're awesome.
---
Do I need to be prot for BRD? Currently 55
---
Twinking won’t be popular until p3+ so now is the time to stock up on twink gear as the prices are much lower than they will be once twinking is relevant
---
Has to be. Based on his posts, he got camped by an alli paladin last night for a while
---
It's sad when people cant separate the entertainer from the person.
---
Yeah Krol blade + mirahs song is the best alternative if you don’t want to farm dal rends
---
Are the babies green?
---
Nope cause we be wearing that leather blue crap till bwl rogues replace it with t1
---
RPG has become such a lose term today and essentially boils down to "has stats" or somthing vauge.
---
Its nots great descriptor imo.
---
I think if you logout for like 15 minutes it resets you to spirit healer, not sure though
---
Otherwise, ticket always an option - or see if unstuck in help does anything
---
Its early twentys I can't quite remember but it's easily found on Google

I mean technically yes, but at the same time the economy is only 1 month old so nothing is selling for what it "should", there are more mats and gold available because of layering but at the same time the mats and gold and being used for gear, pots, mounts, and skills. The availability is kind of needed to offset the fact that most people are in the same tier.
---
This early on the effects of layering are kind of negligible. Everything is underpriced and it's not because layers, it because people need gold. A couple months from now copper ore is gonna be 5 to 10 times the price it is now, not because layers are gone (hopefully) but because player income grows with the average player level.
---
Plus layer abuse is bannable so a lot of the effects of it are dimished by the bans.
---
Just googled it... I see it’s only useful for raids and such for not pulling aggro from tank. Useless for soloing quests.
---
So what you are saying - you don't know the definition of the term "all" and/or "everyone", since my point was exclusively about all needing vs all greeding.
---
I had literally just popped it too.
---
They are good but not OP, check out dueling tournies, Mages win more often
---
Essence of Water is also around 10-12g on my server and slowly getting cheaper by the day. The price difference between Undeath and Water are relatively small because everyone is farming Essences right now, and with layering, there is going to be a lot available which leads to undercutting. Glad I held off rushing to make my Archmage Robes since the total cost dropped by ~150g in the past 3 days.

OMFG HOW DID YOU UNLOCK THE SECRET WORGEN RACE???!!!
---
Dude it’s not that easy. Tanking is more then my ability to play. Shout and taunt don’t mean shit if I get one shot because my healers are Pom trying to keep my ass up. I’m not asking for sympathy, that’s the whole reason I didn’t put my name or his. 
---
I will rank dungeons for my guild and even though we get through it, it is still very rough on the healers. I really don’t know why you think I’m a moron for not wanting to rank for random people that never asked me to in the first place.
---
Str stam, int stam, agi stam, int spirit, stam spirit, str agi.

lmao exactly, I used to be one of these kids attempting to troll everyone back in the CS1.6/CSS/WoW days.
---
Warms my heart knowing things haven't changed and will never change.
---
too fucking big
---
So I hear this a lot regarding the reckoning talent for paladins...  They "fixed" /sit macros go force crits, but it's still possible.  I figured out how to reliably get a reckoning proc per mob swing and I was wondering if maybe it works for warriors too?
---
Basically you have to sit during the swing recharge and then sidestep so that you start stand right as the mob swings and you get crit and a reck proc
---
Maybe try it out?
---
You rolled 100 anyway
---
This one just drives me nuts. Does any mage respond well to this, people that do it?
---
I usually thank them at the end in a pm, and generally thank the group as well.
---
Also, I do think mages should and have the obligation to hand out water, I always ask. But people are fucking dicks about it for no reason on both the mage side and the person asking side too. I just think all around everybody could use some common courtesy, it would make things a lot better for all.
---
THANK YOU! I don't understand this either. The entitlement is strong in vanilla and idk if its from people coming off retail or just their nature in general but still...
---
2 items are plate belt and wrist.
---
Isn't this how a lot of conflict in real life tends to happen?
---
:S
---
In options, there's a "stuck" button and a "teleport to graveyard" button.
---
Best change I've done is setting the gamma to 0.9 instead of the 1.1 it defaulted to for me.
---
At 0.9 the game looks perfect imo.
---
Follow the shrooms
---
Troggs has a better ring to it though
---
Is the norm in what world?
---
This is pretty correct, yes. Hybrids are more or less forced into healing and they all need gear from the same dungeons. There is of course more dps but also 3 times the number of spots in a 5 man. I am a 60 healer and certainly don't feel in demand. It also depends on the dungeon quite a bit. I can get UBRS / LBRS quite easily, etc.. it just depends where gear drops, etc..
---
 I saw a group of people at dangeon, 4 to be precise. Asked them if they want me to summon their 5th, got invited, their leader gave me some potions as a thank you. I was glad I helped them to start the dangeon as it's  not always easy to get to places in classic. Being able to help people around priceless for me.
---
Classic+ confirmed
---
Honestly African turtle cleave has alway been more my thing., but ot each their  own.
---
Yay! Grats on your new signet! 😊✨
---
I do not apology
---
I'm sorry, and happy for you OP. Such a close loss is devastating, and life altering. People may spend their entire lives searching for splinters of themselves, to no avail. It sounds like you found a big chunk in that closure, from the way you write. Memories so vivid and treasured that it washes everything else away, giving you a chance to remember someone fondly, free of grief, even if for just a moment.
---
I got almost 25 levels of that with Shadoweave gear.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/druid-leveling-classic-wow
---
i'm using the above guide for leveling, including it's talent tree
---
People don't have a lot of excess gold to spend on frills like pets right now, and there are a lot of people leveling and getting whelpling pets from wetlands and badlands. So low gold + higher supply. 
---
Massive inflation is coming as more people level, so in a few months the whelpling will be worth a lot more gold, but relatively speaking they'll be worth around the same amount because of inflation
---
... Not even mentioning Revenge makes me go 'wtf'
---
Why reply hurry up and group up ffs
---
Agreed I'd like the reduced chance to resist. I have been healing in dungeons so i took the improved healing talents instead.
---
Yet another example of rolling greed being punished.
---
Do you have any examples to share? I haven't noticed much of an impact on end-game mats myself. Things like essences are still expensive and mining mats like thorium still hold their price. 
---
Hell, on my server, only 2 guys know how to make Lionheart helm, and only for the past week. Before that Arcane Crystals were at around 20g but since have actually nearly doubled in price. Herbs are still relatively cheap however things like Greater Arcane Elixir are still rather expensinve but mostly due to the recipe being hard to get and super expensive on AH.
---
Maybe players aren't exploiting it as much on my server? But i haven't noticed prices going down but rather going up as everyone as a whole has more gold.
---
Nah this is how you breed the yellow orcs
---
Gorishural was the name of his main.
---
It's an odd name so if anyone recognizes it and remembers him from Darkspear, I'm sorry. I quit WoW for a long time after he passed and never went back on Darkspear to let people know. I couldn't handle it.
---
or private server player who thinks he's better than the rest and players helping him is an insult to his skill and knowledge of the game.
---
How about we stop making stupid assumptions and just state the facts: Just an idiot doing what idiots do.
---
I don't know why you are downvoted - Needing on BoE items for selling is the fucking definition of greed.
---
Sorry, but you just shouldn't spout nonsense.
---
That’s a nice goal to have! It is theee most amazing shield in Vanilla imo, I just had to have it ^^
---
But, why? I know about AQ40 res gear later for the Life Essences, but if we use Undead to Water as an example right now. If you can make 8g profit on every transmute (on my server it's only 4g a day) it would take 80-90 days to even break even on the investment. And that's provided you don't miss a single day.
---
I'm just not sure if I'm missing something here. It's literally just for a daily bit of income, right?
---
Aye I believe it’s 20-22. Looking up at wowhead says it’s 22, however I’ve been told by others in game it’s 20. So I’ll just have to ding 20 and see for myself :p
---
little rule of thumb as a mage:
---
\-we are in a major city you run over to me to ask for food/water ? i expect a tip  
---
\-&gt; i go thorug downtime so you dont have to, i could make money instead of casting consumables for you and drinking back up
---
\-we are in the wild and you helped me after i fucked up my pull and almost died?   
---
\-&gt;you better have some space in yo gawd damn pockets coz even if its a 2 for 1 cast of dat good shit ill hit you   
---
   up with 2 stacks each and mb a group invite for a couple of quests
---
\-we are in a dungeon together?  
---
\-&gt; i will wafflestompf 10+ for 1 cast  shit into your inventory until you stop accepting my trades since it will increase my efficiency if you have ample supply of food/water. BUT i probably wont give you maxrank ST intbuff coz downtime is a bitch we are all here and ready to go.
---
As a mage I need me some of dat
---
TFW you wanna play a class but suddenly hear the calling of the Hunter Life....
---
9/10 that warrior tanking is a fury warrior who gets 70% of his p1 bis from dungeons, the prots are running in might already and hardly pug.
---
Unfortunately not, yea I know would have been so much better!
---
Leatrix Maps add-on shows you the level of zones when you hover over them
---
Sorry for your loss I can’t imagine the pain of loosing a close sibling.
---
All the more reason to grind the mobs there then.

---
If you write this, you deserve anything you get.
---
I know riight! Thanks :)
---
gray vendor trash
---
Put it up twice for greens, three times for blues, four times for epics. If they don't sell by those times, I vendor.
---
I'm not an enchanter, but even though I'll be rolling one of my alts as one. I'd rather have the coin now.
---
You should have done the Warrior quest for Taunt and defensive stance by now. That should help with holding aggro.
---
Twinks are the most fun
---
Thank you ma sir!

You mean, another ninja looter

When I turn in my bartender4 addon, my lorti UI (the one that darkens everything disappear. Anyone knows why?

Heal Pally &gt; anything in PVP with a Warrior. Even a shaman xD
---
I would love to see how effective a Warrior with a Shaman would be. Windfury... Not so much if the Warri can't reach his enemy xD
---
But yeah - you seem very butthurt. And isn't it that HPriests and Shamans pretty much only use 1 heal as well? The most mana efficient? Otherwise you'd be doing something wrong...
---
Nevertheless. Druids are the real MVP's here
---
If you play with a 2H, I'd suggest spamming hamstring and sunder to fish for dodge and get overpower proc.
---
Yeah idk what was up with him.  Just another instance of me never running anything with that guild again
---
Yeah, now I wasted my roll RNG for the next month.
---
price reduction happens monthly 
---
takes forever to drop from 50 to 10
---
Yeah but you can't tell them their own lore is wrong. It's their story to tell.  They provided plenty of justification as to alliance shamans and horde Paladins. You close to ignore that lore and instead pretend there was never a justification, that's your prerogative.
---
So you had assumed the other epic was yours.  Such entitlement.
---
To this day, even with Arcane Explosion being an actual good ability that you should use regularly in retail, I cannot stand pressing that button because it brings me back to the desperation AE of vanilla. The skill you mash when you know you are fucked and are just trying to do SOMETHING before you die. It makes AoEing as an Arcane Mage feel awful to me, like I'm doing something wrong even when I'm not.
---
Hey I’m in Materia!
---
Why is there a second post about that neckbeard...  
---
(p.s. Asmon is realy a horrible person)
---
They went back to retail.
---
Seconding this, it isn't fully functional, some aspects are buggy and throw errors, but it tracks attendance, handles invites, and let's you set and send notes for all to see with boss tanking/healing assignments they can reference at any time.
---
I also use oRA3 to auto promote certain people on a list there to assist during raid since ERT's autopromote feature isn't working for me, as well as mass promote and disband the group after.
---
Didn't they fix this already? There was a blue post about it.
---
Did i just read "retribution" and "raid" in 1 sentence?
---
Why does everyone end up resorting to name calling?
---
The first time I dueled someone (back when I first started in TBC) was such a confusing moment. They were jumping around and it was hard to hit them. I was like "wtf you can't do that?!" I had been fighting dummy mobs the whole time that I just assumed players would face each other and just hit each other until one died. SO dumb
---
Twinsies!
---
Disagree - just moved the community to be external to the game. People still discuss and debate those topics. Hell people still argue about certain talents under certain circumstances even if the overall builds are some what set.  
---
I do think it effects that game more than we give it credit though. I wonder if I would roll alts as often if when I was scrolling through content I was constantly bombarded with how every class is great and constantly seeing shortfalls of classes highlighted vs just playing the game but I consider that a personal issue
---
Yeah I think I have an issue with mine. On my system it's fine but on other People's its low. Will try fix for next video
---
Thanks for the kind words
---
This greed thing is a recent invention by humanity - since the release of classic wow.
---
More people are definitely raiding today than back in Vanilla but I don't buy the "people are better at games today"-argument. Sure a lot of people have better mentality than back then but better players? No. Most of it has to do with 1.12 itemization. Preraid bis players now could probably go into bwl gearwise. Our guild for example is just stacking domo and AoEing it down.
---
I have also watched streams from my guild spending an entire evening wiping on majordomo.
---
I am pretty sure that once BWL hits, players are gonna hit a wall on razorgore. Cause that is when itemization will start to normalize and its the first real skill check.
---
I am damage meter fan !! 😂😂😂
---
Would absolutely love for them to just randomly show up out of nowhere in time for Phase 2 or the BGs.
---
BRD is a huge dungeon that spans many levels, starting with ~52 and ending with last boss at 59. You might be a bit low for last boss (55 can't maintain threat on a 59 as well) but for everything else you should be good enough.
---
^ thats the right answer. I went around to get a couple engineering schematics last week and the respawn time on those was 10min tops, but i think theyre all different so YMMV
---
I wish I rolled orc.

Tanking is by far the most difficult role in dungeons.

Well if you are on Stalagg we would love to have you. Our guild is focused on being a group of nerds that love this game. We prefer guild runs of dungeons and helping eachother out much as we can to just acheive our wow goals and have fun above all else. Still growing but if people are on they be talkin
---
I did the exact same fucking thing, luckily only made the mistake on 1 of the 2 whelplings.
---
The first run of the place, right after Classic was released, took my group like 2.5 hours to complete because no one remembered the layout of the place.  And that was without wipes.
---
I recently did WC on an alt and I bet we had it whipped in half that time just because we knew which sections to skip and where the bosses were at.
---
It is part of the standard UI. Basically spilled over because Classic is run on a modern client of WoW.
---
Its just AOE group, why call it something else? Cleave is different from AOE why mix it up? Spellcleave doesnt make any sense.

**WESTFALL GUARD** | US | Alliance | Bloodsail Buccaneers | RP | 24/7 EST
---
**ABOUT US**
---
&lt;Westfall Guard&gt; is the social guild for people who don't join social guilds. It's quiet. But it's nice. We do stuff. Alone. Together. Sometimes. Or not. No biggie. Maybe later. Or now. No we're cool either way . . . unless? Join our growing list of people who haven't been seen since launch day. Because we won't judge you for giving up on life and admitting that everything you really want is right here in Azeroth. Just consider this your golden opportunity to lay low without saying a word in chat for two months, show up drunk for raid, ninja some epics, then /gquit mid-pull and throw everyone on ignore, with no regrets.
---
**HOW TO ENLIST**
---
New recruits must be at least 18 years old, have an active subscription to WoW, and have at least one Alliance character on the Bloodsail Buccaneers [RP] realm. If you would like to join the guild or have questions, you can add my BTag (Heezdedjim#1871) or drop into our discord (discord.gg/2HqQtj7), where you can read our charter and enjoy screenshots of our disastrous dungeon attempts.
---
When you die and forget to turn on your find herbs.
---
Feelsbadman.
---
&gt; offering to pay them off 
---
See, that changes the topic dramatically. If you are buying off their chance of loot instead of denying it its totally fair.
---
The only way grouping with someone low will actually help is if you run them thru a dungeon that is their level, very quickly.
---
Something like a mage arcane explosion grinding a 15-20 thru WC or VC.
---
They both had around 75-80% HP right? Are you saying in order to PVP 1 on 1 you have to wait for your enemy to get 100% HP? You're not making any sense, it's like you're make some moral PVP argument that the rogue is in wrong. And moving beyond that, there's no additional remarks on comments I made about the druid. 
---
Really this shit is just dumb. The only reason I replied to you both here is that in the last little bit playing WoW I've ran into people with the worst behaviors (stealing loot, ganking 10v1, camping lowbies, you name it). They ignore facts, and always try to justify their actions and once they are challenged on this they simply stop all comms about it. So as I'm interacting with people here and in-game it's like this really weird snapshot of 2004 interacting with teenagers online. EXCEPT this time the game is 15 years old and WoW community average age is older now in Classic (I'm assuming) but the same tropes and immaturity exists. It's amazing to see but actually sad in a way.
---
Wow cringe post ahoy
---
could just be a clique - I wouldn't call that socializing within the context of the guild if one group is just off in the corner playing by themselves lol
---
That chest is the boss's loot, it's no different then just taking a boss drop. Hes an asshole
---
Yes. You don’t want to blow your load then stand there being worthless. Downrank as necessary to ensure you keep doing damage. The extra casts gained can often be a damage gain through a fight compared to a few higher ranked spells.
---
Out of interest when did you play vanilla? Late after it had launched?  Because right now people are saving up for their epic mounts etc so they aren't at liberty to give away freebies like they'll be half a year from now.
---

---
It breaks unit frames like Healbot because they're protected functions. If you use the standard Blizzard raid frames (which most healers don't), it wouldn't be a problem.
---
Dont blame you, that is just BS. I mean same when i play my warlock i just give people healthstones. I dont charge for it xd.
---
Interesting. Could go and try it out??
---
In-game also doesnt facilitate those conversations as well as forums. Cant really scroll back too far to read and link etc.
---
Is there any setting or addon that lets me use autoshoot with right click on hunter?
---
Actual clown.
---
I like your style
---
Nice in bear
---
A new setup needs a new name. Spellcleave fits because its a full group of spellcasters.
---
Dont hate the languege because you hate the meaning.
---
How do I get infinite slot bags like these?
---
Thank you for sharing the story, the drinks will be flowing in Gallows End tonight!
---
Yeah rage potions are a good trick, waiting a few seconds is even better, but you know "damage meter" ^^
---
I have a vague idea that I read somewhere there is a way in-game to modifier-click or something on a character name in the chat window and see some more information about the character like at least their class and level. Is that just something that I imagined or is there actually a way to get a little bit of quick info about characters that post in chat by clicking or doing something else on their names?
---
to be fair, it's incredibly frustrating having multiple mages in a  party and the tank won't pull more than a 2-pack 
---
And then when I'm tanking, I realize it's impossible to pull enough mobs to satisfy mages because eventually you're going to get dazed running around trying to pull more than 4 guys. 
---
as a mage I now regularly pull a few more mobs and bring them to tank if he's good enough to handle it, because I appreciate when good mages do that when im tanking
---
That's not passive aggressive.  It's pretty direct and clear communication.
---
Thank you. Maybe I should add that I level as Arms and thus only leave Battle Stance for "oh shit" situations (Shield Wall) or when I'm chasing a suicidal mob/player (Intercept)
---
i disagree, plenty of ways to make an RPG difficult...
---
you could make every mob into a patrol of multiples, with every char having tools how to sperate them and control the pack during killing it. 
---
Give mobs abilities that have to be stopped or actively evaded, is another option that can make killing stuff challenging
---
Sorry to burst your bubble but it will only go for around 50-100g at the moment. Not bad still.
---
I’d be pleased as a peach if some mid-30s socially awkward neckbeard handed me garbage - atleast it means you got outside that day!

---
In an MMO I feel like monsters should be really tough to kill. I mean look at games like Soulsbourne series. Now completely different in everyway I got you but the underlying difficulty of not being afraid to repeatedly kill their players.........Imagine what that company would do if it knew you had parties available to help through content in terms of difficulty hahaha
---
In my experience it completely depends on the server. Yes, if you onto one of the most populated Full servers, you get all the tryhards. If you go to a Medium pop PvE realm, it's a lot more chilled. And on RP servers even more so.
---
I use something like this:
---
`#showtooltip Berserker Rage`  
---
`/cast [nostance:3] Berserker Stance`  
---
`/cast [stance:3] Berserker Rage`  
---
`/cast [stance:3, mod:shift] Battle Stance; [stance:3] Defensive Stance`
---
What it does: You always see Berserker Rage cooldown, it switches you to Berserker stance if not in Berserker stance, it casts Berserker Rage if you are currently in Berserker stance, it cast's Defensive stance if you are in Berserker stance OR if you are pressing SHIFT it will swap to Battlestance instead.
---
Be wary that stances have a slight Cooldown, so if you did no initiate this originally from Berserker stance, it will be done in 2 clicks instead of one. I did this all from head but it should work, if you experience delay on Berserker Rage, you can take the \`\[stance:3\]\` condition off, it should not actually pose any problem.
---
Honestly, Rogues can main tank dungeons until like level 45.
---
Lol.  That phrase has no relevance to me but it’s funny because this has always been my nickname as it’s part of my full name, then found out years ago that it became such a popular name because of world of tanks and people will say that to me as well.
---
Where's Rich Turpin?
---
If you haven't equipped it yet, sell it or keep it for selling later.
---
I'd not really use it for leveling, even though it's not bad dps. The weapon speed makes it bad to use with aimed shot, since you lose 1 extra attack. 
---
I'd use a 2.6+ ranged attack weapon over this. It's also an ammo gourmand.
---
I was in EPL the other day and a Horde Priest MC'd me to dispell a 30 min debuff :D
---
What class are you?  I was just thinking being a pally this would take forever
---
Look up, the Bunnings Snag. Its the most sacred of Australian cuisine!
---
Yes, this basically just means that a mob or player needs to be around your level for the ability to work correctly. Like grey mobs don't give xp, grey players don't give homor for example
---
you can always go for insta grind. no pvp, no competition for mobs
---
From what I saw it’s BiS pre raid. The medallion that is. I would imagine the signet maybe pre raid BiS for fury. Glad you had a good experience with good people and sick loot! Lok’tar!
---
level 44 mage and been whispered twice total, by people who were in the group I tried spellcleave with asking if I wanted to go again
---
I get way more guild invites and water requests
---
Based on how my parents react to... the internet I don't actually think they are. There's just far more controversial material for people to get sensitive over, but people are much thicker skinned now.
---
I've played WoW with these same salty assholes since 2004, but even the really bad ones won't yell at you and subsequently block you for saying hello to them.
---
I have no confidence that you simply said "hi buddy" to him, and that his 'reconsider how you talk to people' comment was reserved for something else you said, that was cropped out of this picture.
---
Your assumption was based around the fact that all 5 people wanted to sell it. 
---
If 4 people want to sell it and 1 wants to equip it then in your method there will always be 4 loot ninjas. 
---
Your point of view completely ignores the fact that someone might want to equip the piece that drops, in which case all needing means that there are definitely 4 loot ninjas instead of the potential for being 1.
---
What the actual fuck, I was looking at the exact spot when I wen't back to alt tabbing to the game.
---
Thank you, I will do the same

Wowhead

15 years later and Im still trying to get that flame sword
---
Take up fishing?
---
I've luckily met a lot of good guys along the way. Hit 55 last night in a BRD run where 3 people from the group were added to my Friends. We didnt finish, did about half the dungeon and spent lots of it in VC laughing our asses off. 
---
I've met some rude people, but I feel like the big trick is avoiding any group looking for "Aoe clears, *Insert Dungeon* farm, no *insert class/armor type, reserved: *tank stuff* LF Tank" etc etc
---
I went to do a world quest in retail earlier, one of those azerite caves.
---
I met a priest there and was about to say "hey, wanna group up? We can share the tag and make it smoother and quicker".  Then I remembered I'm playing retail and ain't nobody need to do that!
---
So I proceeded to pull 30+ mobs in the cave at once and we both AoE the cave down (didn't even lose 5% of my health) and then we ran our separate ways.  Without saying a word to each other.
---
THAT is why the game lost its sense of community.  Not because of wowhead and discord and YouTube.  Lol.  Those are platforms that enhance community.
---
i just pass on them
---
they are worthless
---
Best part, he thought he was getting a free kill, he got a durability hit instead.
---
I don’t attack the other faction - i’m talking about when I get attacked and people on my faction just stroll past.
---
And thats cool, I won’t message them or say anything - I just realized those are the players on my server I want nothing to do with. I don’t want to see them asking for assistance nor will I help them.
---
That's the main reason I play on a PvE server.
---
All of us are retail players now. Most private servers are asgood as dead. 
---
Of course there’s gonna be clueless players on both sides but someone who played the game in recent time, maybe leveled to 60 and did a bit of raiding is very likely going to be more used to classic mechanics and meta (and therefore have more clue) than someone coming from BFA with way outdated experience or no prior experience. 
---
The problem with BFA experience is that you think you know the game, classic, but you don’t. And then you end up buffing BoW on warlocks entirely convinced it’s the ultimate correct choice, being reluctant to advice and ultimately handycapping the group. 
---
TBH someone who played no WoW at all is more likely to take advice as he knows that he knows nothing. 
---
Another thing I noticed is that a good amount of undead players don’t use WOTF when feared, isn’t that the reason to play undead in the first place?
---
At least it’d be a crit, I guess.
---
No reason to get those tbh.  Hands of power from lbrs are full bis.  Only thing bis for us out of ST is the OH but the amount of rng it takes to get it isn’t really with it, just get the oh from the linken chain.
---
And then she ate pizza and cats and wondered what happened to that hunky guy from that 80's sitcom.
---
pugs who've all played on unnofficial servers and know exactly what's going on
---
Bloodthirst scales significantly better than shield slam so at a certain point yes, but at all gear levels a big thing is Flurry. Increasing your attack speed is not only more damage from white hits and more rage generation but it also means you can fit more heroic strikes in any given amount of time.
---
try clique
---
You don’t need to be prot specced to tank ubrs...
---
Which MH would you pair with the offhand (I assume you mean the +14 shadow damage +5 intellect orb)? The staff offers 2 less damage than the pairing I listed, but 10 stamina which is great for locks.
---
Out of curiosity how is a tank supposed to hold aggro when pulling 30 mobs if the Mages and Healers start using their skills before you've even gathered 10 of them?
---
I think it's more DPS and Healers that don't understand how aggro and threat works ITT.
---
You're making a mistake 100%.  
---
Make an alt, get it to level 5, get it to a major city so you can send mail, and also learn enchanting. Download addons that show disenchant value (the estimated value of the materials you may get when you disenchant). Also download Trade Skill Master, run a scan and that will show you what people are selling those boe greens on the auction house for (if there are any auctions). Generally, just disenchant everything, you will make more money, as well as level up enchanting on an alt, which you can also level your alt to level 35 to get 300 enchanting.  
---
Also, you can just send all BOEs and other stuff you want to auction to this alt so you dont have to go back to a major city to auction items.

I always res when traveling or when I'm not competing, but Ill dance on their grave before I res someone else farming in my area
---
Few questions about some Rogue's spells :  
---
\- Why Sap's duration seems random ? Anyone know what parameters enter in the formula ?  
---
\- Why Gouge sometimes (too often) forces the enemmy to turn and expose his back and sometimes no ? It's driving me crazy.  
---
\- I think both Gouge and Melee attack are 5 yd range, I'm I right ?  
---
\- I have a maccro that's look like something :  
---
 \#showtooltip  
---
/startattack  
---
/cast Sinister Strike   
---
Sometimes my Sinister isn't cast and an autoattack is launched, I have the back of the enemy in front of me and my energy is OK. Is it possible that is a bug due to sync between client and server energy regen ? Maybe the maccro ? I'm new to the game so I try to understand this.
---
It honestly took me a while to get used to reading chat again.
---
Finally, someone who actually plays the game not by the guide! 
---
Fun &gt; efficiency.
---
Most of the time it's not evsn mecessary though, just being polite is enough
---
Please do more, this is amazing, one of the best posts in this sub absolutely
---
Ah yes, demon armor. The perfect spell to cast during a difficult combat encounter.
---
Getting some slipperyjim vibes here for sure!
---
Throw some sunnies on like irl 😋
---
What the fuck are you talking about
---
What I did in PvP while chasing someone was spamming R1 SW:P 4 times and max rank one time to apply Shadow Weaving and occasionally proc Blackout.
---
It was meant more as a meme homie.
---
Yeah haha outside of a common hardware store (think Home Depot) they hold a fundraising sausage sizzle every time and its amazing. 
---
I swear they put crack in the snags or something!
---
Buy ASAP
---
Depends on how much coin they put in the trade window.
---
Fishing for stuns with rank one with spare global was a thing but not sure it’s that effective.
---
Definitely works.
---
Imagine being so afraid of someone that swimming through lava seems your better option.
---
&gt; I'm more happy that I finally found people that aren't on a gold frenzy.
---
He says after being in a gold frenzy :thinking:
---
I guess it could be valid if you're just running away and being chased? Obviously don't use this method if you wanna kill someone, but if fear is on CD and you don't want to stand around casting mind flay and MB till you die I don't see any reason not to spam swp1 behind you and hope you get a proc. Could save your life.
---
I'd say it's mostly about the math for me.
---
You have 3 damage-spells as shadow:
---
One has a cooldown, one is a DoT and one is channelled.
---
The only one you can always use is the channeled one. But in order to do so, you need to shield-yourself as otherwise you'll not get all of it's ticks.
---
So in order to counteract the need for using mana on being shielded all the time you better significantly outperform the alternative.
---
And without shadow-form that simply isn't the case.
---
With the increase in Crit%, Cast-time and a whooping 20% damage, Smite really isn't all that bad compared to Mind-Flay. Pushback isn't nearly as bad as getting a channel interrupted, so you don't need to constantly shield yourself.
---
And most of the time you wand once the mob reaches you anyways.
---
The greatest thing about leveling in the shadow-tree is Spirit-tap. It makes more of a difference than anything else. And it is a baseline talent, so you can get it right away.
---
So shadow without the actual shadow-form that gives you a huge damage- and survivability-boost doesn't feel appealing to me compared to the alternatives.
---
that is funny as shit
---
Probably he is using Advanced Interface Addon
---
As far as I can remember from my university course, Tit For Tat is considered the "best" strategy at least for the Prisoner's Dilemma when considering multiplayer matches. Anectodally, thats also what always worked the best for me in WoW.
---
I never really liked westfall
---
Yes it works. In vanilla I used this while chasing down people running away to stun them long enough to mind blast and flay.
---
Nah, that would be too easy to detect. They put the crack in the pigs.
---
3rd biggest EU server - pvp
---
A Peon's Burden? He says the exact same thing in classic dude
---
Nah retail are just silent unless directly spoken to.
---
I'm not your 'guy', reconsider how you talk to people
---
Well not make it so obvious he’s ganking him. And instead of casting frostbolt and it getting stopped he could’ve used frost nova/blink to get distance and then frostbolt spam/cone of cold when he gets close and Frost nova again.
---
You do realize that 90%+ of the player base doesn’t take their WoW to YouTube or Twitch, right?  I’m in a guild with 200+ and only 3-4 actually watch streamers...  Streamers create weird meta while the rest of the players just play the game and get it done without being told you “can’t” do something.
---
I think you should reroll on the same server. Go kill your old friends while you make new friends.
---
Honestly I think your tank messed up it's rotation or/and didn't have any TPS gear on.
---
We had a similar problem, our human tank with a prot-impale build didn't generate enough threat. Later on, a nelf with a similar build and gear replaced him, and he had no problem at all generating threat. So I messaged him to check out what the difference was.
---
After shield slam/revenge, He was using HS in bosses instead of spamming sunder. HS generates 145 threat and adds 138 damage to your next autoattack (283 total extra threat, as opposed to sunder's 260). It also doesn't get affected by glancing blows, and can crit for 220% damage with an impale build ( both the added HS damage and the base attack damage crit for 220%). 
---
He also had an enemy attack timer to safely switch to berserker stance, use berserker rage, and switch back. It doubles your rage generated from incoming damage, and HS is more rage-intensive than sunder.
---
He also chugged rage potions and activated berserker rage on pull to secure a fast shield slam + HS opening.
---
Honestly it surprised me how much of a difference he made. That man carried us hard.
---
Having a fury-prot MT also makes it harder to use mocking blow or stance dance, since they lose all rage when they switch stances.
---
Interdimentional goblin vampires man...
---
They're making the damn Troggs gay
---
Before the low 40's not much difference leveling shadow and holy.
---
Pretty much everyone is 5/5 wand spec, most also take Spirit tap.
---
Everything after that is nice to have.
---
Mid to late 40's is where shadow starts coming into it's own.
---
Lols
---
got mine at 45 but it was okay, i spent more time dead than running around anyway
---
Just say no!
---
I think he might be added him to bnet friends
---
yeah, but that just boils down again to: dicks will be dicks and has nothing to do with mages or tanks or anything
---
some people are incapable of being decent or only capable of being decent while everything goes well
---
You gotta keep that shit trimmed and neat, yo. Getting stabbed in the spleen? Meh; you'll heal. Pain builds character. Breaking/ripping off a nail that you let grow too long in combat? Pure agony. It'll haunt you for ages. You'll beg for death.
---
Intergluteal cleaving is my preferred method, really cracks it.
---
I dont get it.  I have been paying mages 50s per trade window of food since I was like 50.  I start every extended playing session with 120 water and 120 food, costs me 1g.  Never had a mage turn me down.
---
Yeah the skies have always been really cool in wow, the night sky in Nagrand
---
(TBC) is marvelous.
---
The potion and Rune give you +3000 mana, for 8.2k total. Add on another 1130 from Mana Tide and you're at 9330. At 247 per cast, you can cast 37.8 times or 95 secs (about a minute and a half).
---
Lightning Bolt costs 108 mana/sec compared to Chain Heal's 99 mana/sec. And Lightning Bolt is the *cheap* part of the rotation. Shocks and Chain Lightning are considerably more expensive. About all that can be said is that Fire totems are efficient - but that doesn't matter much because Fire damage isn't very useful in MC/BWL.
---
It's that BFA ?
---
It's the leather helmet cant remember the exact name
---
And? As a rogue i rolled on multiple weapons with int / spell damage while levelling. 
---
One notable example being healing mace from SM Cathedral - slow mace with 30 dps is absolutely nuts for that level.
---
The big difference is that people are looking longer term than they did.
---
Back in original vanilla, a marginal upgrade might have been the difference between getting to go to LBRS and not getting to go to LBRS. Now, people are jumping from hitting 60, to full pre-MC raid blues, to MC clear pretty quick. A fresh guild back in the day might take 6 months to do that, and it took a few months for the first few progression guilds to really get MC on farm. 
---
The standard black diamond librams aren't going to be big deals. It's BiS or nothing at this point.
---
Yeah that could work, thanks.
---
im at about 6 days 6 hours played
---
Thats a really difficult one... I'd always go for Horde with my friends. No question really.
---
I would let them know the decision I have made for them everytime I get the Chance though :D Let them suffer for it!
---
Let them die from time to time and say "If I had Lay on Hands that wouldn't have happened" :D 
---
GL with your choice!
---
Lol i dont think ive ever seen anyone say alli have better pvp racials in Vanilla
---
All CC has a chance to break early, think it's something to do with the game doing resist rolls at multiple points throughout the duration, but I'm not sure what the exact mechanics are.
---
Jumped off of a pinnacle in thousand needles because I saw iron "with my name on it." Asked the mage for slow fall, saw him cast it. Jumped off only to see: "Oh it's self cast only."
---
Even for you it is not ideal. I would die from neck pain If I had to look to the right side for extended period of the time. Do your neck a favor and center the screen.
---
How do you get camped by a paladin, just res and run theres nothing they can do.
---
The way I see it is that the 400 g you think you will get in 3-6 month will have the exact same currency value as 60g today.
---
Who dat?
---
No, I'm saying that the Blizzard interpreter does not all certain functions to be called by user functions inside combat.
---
I'd rather spend a few hours a day in SM rather than running to my corpse in STV or Desolace. From 30-40 I think mixing in some heavy SM runs while leveling is the only way for me to personally stay sane doing so.
---
Turns out you dont need the darkmoon faire cannon to see gnomes fly
---
I mean, I like pvp, just not ppppvp, should have a chance or else why bother?
---
Lolwat
---
Not that complex
---
Ive always used Healbot but what are the advantages Grid2 has over it?
---
&gt;and that he has slow fall, and I dont.
---
target something on the ground and charge/intercept
---
Tearsfall Glades.   
---
Great story, man. I've had massive waves of nostalgia where I remember old friends once I walk into a zone or dungeon, but can't imagine revisiting a memory like this. Sorry for your loss. Brotherhood is a special relationship.
---
Can't you feed him to restore happiness?
---
Yeah, generally, I try to group up. If they ignore or refuse when they definitely have room, they're being a dick, so I'm gonna be a dick back and ninja that mob tag.
---
I'll keep doing it if they are being particularly insufferable, otherwise I just get my kill and move on.
---
QUESTION: How do I let Healing Numbers show on friendly targets? Read: I've tried turning EVERYTHING on in the Combat Interface Options! It does not work.
---
320 health in the mid 40's even. I'm a pretty fucking geared raiding rogue and I have like 2.8k health
---
Thanks man! That makes a lot more sense now.
---
&gt;\- Ignoring a player now ignores not only their character, but that person's entire account. For example if you ignored a person on their main, they could create an alt and whisper you. This is no longer possible. 
---
And this is a amazing change. Because if i want to ignore someone, i want to ignore HIM/HER, not one char.
---
I'd do a single gradient bar with indicators every X levels
---
just wait till you are in EPL and auto run into that damn scarlet patrol or whatever
---
100% its so pathetic.
---
If ST makes you lose your mind, I don't want to imagine what it would be like when you have to go BRD.
---
I agree with what you said, but wand damage and spirit tap are taken on basically every single priest build from 1-59. Its the points after that which are contested imo. 
---
For me, I went holy and put the 5 in wand and 5 in spirit tap. My regen is stupid silly, and now that Im maxing out those talents jn Holy that turn spirit into +healing/damage, its a huge boon. My toon is tailoring too at 43 I have made my own Dreamweave and other pieces. I have nearly +100 healing/damage and massive amounts of spirit. Its nice :)
---
This 100%.
---
The only struggle you may have is the Everliving boss that is huge as he can hit for 300's but then it's up to your healer.
---
Tanks aren't needed for WC.
---
Keep in mind that it's also a detriment to damage since Expose Armour is more powerful than 1 sunder but not 5. So since you can't stack the sunder you have threat issues on top of lower potential damage.
---
r/niceguys
---
The real secret to blow off steam is to sit there and poly macro someone for 30 minutes until they just quit
---
Should just have sent him this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXp_jFvlfMA
---
I hope to one day live in a world where people actually ask nicely for water and/or food.
---
That way I don't have to stare at the atrocity that is Dreamweave robes.
---
I never made that assertion in the slightest that other people were entitled to be in your group
---
Phew haha yeah there is a reason it got a lot easier and tbc, and wotlk just a face roll lol
---
&gt;No. I'm saying that for a random player race is not remotely an indicator of skill.
---
&gt;And trust me, wannabe tryhards who forgot to actually use their brains are way more likely to be gnomes than the actual good mages who know about such things as using CC when appropriate and the right context in which to AoE.
---
&gt;But you clearly have your head stuck so far up your ass that you can't actually read.
---
Hmm yes interesting.
---
Yes exactly this! I got into my computer settings and make sure that it's set to like a metered line so it's not downloading software updates and it's fine.
---
Was edditing few mistakes in spelling bro \^
---
I'm not sure what the code is, but suppose the 30% attack speed increase is (attack speed)*0.7
---
Then a two second attack would get a .6 reduction and a one second attack would get a .3 reduction.  So wouldn't slower pets get the bigger advantage?
---
Or do you mean faster pets get more attacks in, therefore more crits, therefore more frenzy procs?
---
AND BALAZAMON0 IS THE EAST. OH BALAZAMON0 OH BALAZAMON0, WHERE ART THOU FAIR BALAZAMON0?
---
Have you ever felt a duskwood night?
---
Free as an abolished disease

not to mention stitchy
---
whistlin tunes that you know and love sooo
---
Vendor weapons and expensive pieces that sell for 1-5g
---
Disenchant cloth bracers and other shit that vendors don't pay for
---
That's my rough guide for disenchanting
---
Could've sold the Dark Whelplings for much more. I wouldn't have sold them for under 200g each.
---
I wish this was true, and I'm sure there's lots of nice people but I'm in that set of people who regularly seems to group with people either too young, foreign or dense to understand that talk help grup do gud.
---
I swear some of them weren't even mages!
---
I see a lot of comments stating this but I have to clarify. I always make my own groups and I always kick those who complain or pull this elitist crap.
---
I just find its a rising issue and I'm kicking more people than I usually ever would have.
---
Lol it’s actually super easy, just throw a dot on her, run her to the other side of the room, have void taunt and aoe taunt, then go back and dps the other dude
---
You don't "deserve" anything in this game
---
I can confirm because I've blown far too much on respecs already that the initial sequence is 1, 5, 10, 15. That supports the tables I have seen stating that after the first two it goes up by 5 each time to a max of 50. [Patch notes for 1.11](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.11.0) stated that decay was introducted reducing it by 5g per month to a floor of 10g. Reasonable to assume since the reference client is 1.12 that it includes that change. But I doubt that anyone in the game right now actually hit 50g respect cost soon enough after launch to have seen any decay kick in yet. So as yet it's unconfirmed.
---
Hey there. I'm created a discord channel for those who love to play/ or new to wow classic. We want make friend around the world, share game strategy, caring newbie, helping up each other etc. On the otherside , we also provide a free market channel and gold selling free market. We'd like to  invire you to join our discord channel. There's no hurt to dropping in. 
---
That would be ok with any kind of semi-hardcore guild assuming it's his actual BiS and not your BiS in the same time. I wouldn't expect a guildie to contest my bis gear unless it's their bis too.
---
Any other Medivh Bros here?
---
So what about the blue post that says if someone said the lootrules are X in chat, and then Y happened instead?
---
How does warrior aoe?
---
The horde outnumbers alliance on pretty much every PvP server since they have some pretty good racials.
---
I have ran it so often that it actually helps to say in LFG that you can be a tourguide (even a feature they implemented later in the lfg tool - you could check your role but also the leader(?) checkbox) - with many new players and the fact that most classic dungeons are labyrinths, a "tourguide" sometimes is as important as a tank :D
---
Deleted as i don't want to feed trolls.
---
I can't imagine how scarce herbs will be when layering is removed... There are sooo many people on this server. How can the original number of spawn points produce enough herbs or minerals for everyone?
---
He's BM, he won't have access to aimed shot until lvl 51. Multi-shot is too costly to use on single targets while leveling (small mana pool). With this gun at least he'll get more IAotH proccs and the 14agi is nice, too.
---
Story my Mage friend told me:
---
Stranger: “Hey man will you port me?”
---
Mage: “Sure, but it’ll cost 1 gold”
---
S: “Okay sure”
---
*S opens trade window with 50 silver*
---
M: “Price is 1 gold”
---
S: “You’re a fucking douche I’m not paying 1 gold”
---
M: “Okay then, no port”
---
*roughly a minute passes*
---
S: “I’m sorry I was rude, will you still port me?”
---
M: “Yes, price is still 1 gold”
---
Don’t worry about it. I’m level 60 and I’m having huge issues finding tanks for dungeons because there is only a handful of tank-specced warriors on the server. You should hit 60 when there is quite a few more of them, making it easier to find ppl for dungeons

---
**Introduction**  
---
Cyrus was founded over ten years ago back in early 2009, and has enjoyed success in MMO's such as Warhammer Online, Aion, Rift and World of Warcraft. Originally a PvP guild, over the years we learned to appreciate the joys and drama of raiding - and some of us have even learned to stop standing in the lava. You can read more about our history at the link below:
---
[https://www.cyrus-gaming.com/history/](https://www.cyrus-gaming.com/history/)
---
Following something of a general lull in the MMO scene over recent years, we are now beyond hyped to be turning the clocks back and recapturing our wasted youths in World of Warcraft Classic. It's not often you get a second go at things in life, so while we might not still fit into the same pair of skinny jeans we did 15 years ago, we are certainly going to take this opportunity by the horns and throw ourselves into some classic old-school guild life!
---
**Raid Schedule (UK Times)**  
---
Monday - PvP Night  
---
Sunday – 7.20pm to 11pm  
---
Wednesday - 7.20pm to 11pm  
---
Thursday – Dependant on progress
---
We will also organise Battlegrounds and World PvP nights.
---
**Member Expectations**  
---
Cyrus is a focused, progression-based guild for mature, skilled and team-orientated players. We have a long-established leadership committed to getting the most out of our members and ensuring everyone is working towards their own and the common goals of the guild.
---
Our raid schedule reflects that of a more grown up / responsible lifestyle, but we still expect members to be highly active, to participate in other guild activities and to ensure they are fully stocked and ready for when it's go time. You’ll need a thick skin, a good sense of humour, the discipline to know when to speak up, when to shut up and the dedication to constantly improve.

---
Yea I wouldn't consider dark souls a true rpg. More of an action game with rpg elements.
---
Oh, thought there was one for horde with the same rewards my bad!
---
Nice, same server and faction as me. I really like that server
---
Same with Winter's Chill, the frost mage debuff that promises +10% crit chance.
---
indubitably
---
"Yeah but we don't want to take two hours so..."
---
Wow stuff aside, putting a dog's nose in it is actually the incorrect way to teach your dog how to stop pissing in the house.  It's great for teaching them to fear you/have anxiety problems though!
---
He did he forget to mention it
---
My favourite macro for tanking dungeon runs: 
---
/tm 8
---
Literally all it does is applies the Skull icon over your target's head. Great for avoiding split-dps.
---
Not if you're relying on Execute all the time. Only good for stance-switchers
---
Bullshit! It's never fair to expect someone to reroll a different class just because they don't want to play a class the optimal way. 100% bullshit. Everyone can play their class however they want. You should'nt be expected to tank just because you are a warrior and you should'nt be expected to heal just because you are a priest.
---
what a cringe post.
---
The ooze will become super expensive once AQ is out. Great investment into the future.
---
I'm still not able to quest with them in some places.
---
My server had an 65 man raid (1.5 raid groups full) on goldshire last night. Word got out fast and the alliance started pouring down from stormwind and forming their own counter raid.
---
Every single one of us was a target. We had higher levels on mounts tailing our travel because alliance were picking off our under 40s without mounts to keep up. It was a total blood bath of a battle for Goldshire. Both sides had sub level 20s joining in to help even.
---
Idk why anyone would play PvE. Leveling your character and joining a guild, just to farm dungeons. 
---
Servers filled with PvP hungry players are where the real game is at. You cant change my mind
---
I think I’m going for this one..
---
Unless your on faerlina. Then its just asmogold and his people.
---
This man just killed our fun
---
I always start the conversation,  "can I buy some level (w.e level) water plz"
---
If it has good stats I will try to sell it in trade for like 50s over vendor price.  If it doesn't sell in like 2 or 3 advertisements I vendor
---
It was a full clear, including key run and baelgar. Everyone was also completing their quests, and we had a couple of dps leave and had to find replacements. Overall quite fun with the right people.
---
You clearly never did AQ or Naxx.
---
Hey, sorry for the late response. No, it's not really, because there are some levels when dungeons aren't really suitable (either too high or too low) and there are times when you can't find a decent group and just want to do your own thing for a bit. 
---
I'd say my 1-60 was about 50% dungeons and 50% questing. Doing dungeon quests is nutty xp.
---
Depends on the Realm.. On the new Brazilian one, my guild is actually rushing healers tru low level dungeons and BRD to get them to at least 57+ so we can do more strat/scholo/lrbs/ubrs runs to gear up while the other players slowly get to the 60's so we can start running MC.
---
That sayd, we only trully need 1 healer for URBS cus the mobs just melt now that people have better gear.
---
Nah pvp too. Retail pvp sucks hard ass. Classic pvp feels like a real battle.
---
Thanks for Sharing your/His story.  
---
First thing I'm doing after work is Having and in game drink and an Irl drink for Gorishural! Lok'tar ogar!
---
And now I'm sitting at work crying
---
Kinda reminds me dark souls speed runs, or just running to the boss you died 20 times on already :D
---
*After 3 hours of LFG*
---
Man, I can't wait til we get a 3rd mage and clear this dungeon super-fast!
---
I actually had a guy ask me how much the reagents cost so that he was tipping appropriately. Good guy. I should start keeping a list of names of people who are stand-up.
---
Yes this is confirmed and done by hydra the godly  disk/shadow priest, and for the exact reason. While running away for your life if you have the extra mana it makes sense. 
---
You can also use it during PvP so the enemy can waste a dispel on it.
---
Really depends on the friends I'd say.
---
My friend, with whom I played with, wanted to reroll when we were level 19 on our first chars and quit when we were 26 on our second chars.
---
Your friends sound more reliable than that.
---
The thought of playing the dominant faction in regards to later BG-Queues is a bit off-putting though.
---
Also I don't really get what's so great about a Paladin. What about it makes you prefer it over Priest for instance?
---
The GM isn't creating a new rule there in the forum post. He's specifying how they will apply a rule which already exists. The same rule is applied to traditional scamming.
---
Is it still spoiler when the game is 10+ years old?
---
I quit my profession and leveled another because the guild needed and an officer asked me, later I had to travel for 3 days and he kicked me for being offline too long.
---
Sometimes people just suck, just like irl.
---
Close guildie convinced a rogue in the guild and myself (a druid) to do a BFD run because "theres tons of good leather in there." 
---
\*nothing dropped.\* like, none. Zero. Zilch. NADA. HOT NOTHING. 
---
So now, when ever we go to a run SM, Gnomer, w/e -- we all in the guild always joke, "yeah I heard theres TONS of good leather in there"
---
Poor dwarf will never live it down.
---
It's the sad truth, But I'm happy to take an advantage over it. Over the past few weeks mats' i've invested in has already in some cases gone up to 300-500%
---
Morgraine EU horde side, I have had maybe 2 bad experiences with people otherwise everyone is so nice and most people will go out of their way to help you :) I'm so confused when people here say that people are toxic, these last few weeks have been the best wow experience i've had since i can remember, and I have been subbed nonstop since late vanilla :)
---
Yeah, horde doesn't have a pre-wow history of having bad leaders who hurt the horde with their own selfishness...besides Grom...and Guldan...and Blackhand...
---
Total bs lore changes I say.
---
AoE cleave bing bang boom zoomers would have a much more enjoyable time playing D3, honestly. Big pulls, big numbers, gear out the ass and endless rifts. These zoomers are craving for an ARPG, not an MMORPG!
---
Crater wpvp and mafia are 1 of the special things about classic, it gives a dose of fun for many ppl, and in pservers it helped  keeping the pvp scene alive, if u dont like it or cant get enough ppl to contest them , then stay out of it, honor point and trading honor kills is completely invalid coz of honor decay per killing same person.
---
I still always laugh when I hear that
---
I CANT IM A ROGUE ALL I KNOW IS PAIN AND MISERY
---
" charging guildies for things to help the raid progress  " What do you mean by that? Consumables? If so for sure imma Charge guildies for Greater Fire Protection potions if they are to lazy to get them in the first place. Hell there are raids where I need to hand out 40 potions and more. Im not farming 400g consumables each raid because others are to lazy to do it themselves.
---
I reported a ninja, and gm spoke to me saying you can need on what ever you can use. It was a neck with stam/spir/int and warr won it.
---
So nothing happend.
---
Wilt the stilt, man that guy is big
---
I was on my alt, 18 Warrior. Doing the barrens quest stolen silver(i know where it is thanks). 
---
I was trying to take the 17/18 raptors 1 at a time but they cluster in this small ravine. There were a few others there but not loads so i was able to get the silver easily but need some raptor horns. 
---
I started at this raptor, and must have missed my first 2 hits because a mage walks up and 'claims' it with damage. Now it was clear that i was taking this mob, but he claimed it anyway. It wasnt even slim pickings he just chose my mob. As a warrior i find that extra annoying and /s wtf. Some unpleasant words are shared, i think he said get gud, me l2p. Anyway, it was pretty short and i turn around and walked up the hill to try some more. 
---
He follows me, intending to fuck with me when i try get aggro. So rather than charge 2 and die i pull out the blunderbuss, check the chamber, load it up, aim. Before i could finish the mage insta casts to take it. Fine by me i walk at the second and go to just attack it. The mage then spams arcane explosion to tag it too! Only my attack hit first, with low aggro. It was now he taking two not me. 
---
I just watched as he struggled and died. 
---
He then /w me with some insult i said 'hahahhahaha'. But after 10 mins he said sorry and we made up.
---
Yeah, will do the same. I solved it by turning down the contrast somewhat, then turning it back up again when I was done with the zone (since it looked too dark in other zones). But the glow might just fix it.
---
Dark Pact does not scale with spell damage or shadow damage in Classic. I don’t believe it did in Vanilla either. Lifetap does scale with both since it deals shadow damage to you and then gives you an equal (or 1.2x with the talent) amount of mana.
---
Lock picking is a profession that you level, not a skill that you purchase from a vendor. Do you also force people to first aid and gather herbs for you?
---
&gt;I don't accept random battlenet invites
---
Makes sense.  I dont do this either.
---
But priest is one of the best solo leveling classes in all of classic.
---
You spec 5/5 wand damage and 5/5 spirit tap. After that I'd go full shadow but you don't have to.
---
Pre-pull shield yourself &gt; Mind Blast &gt; SW:P &gt; Maybe a Mind Flay and then wand to death. Shield won't break and since you wand for the remaining mob HP, you'll already be in full MP regen mode when the mob dies. Spirit tap will give you a big boost and you'll never have to stop pulling.
---
Pretty much the only things that are better at leveling would be hunters and then mages when they have a good AoE grind opportunity (which may not happen if your server is highly populated).
---
I've got about 5 levels to go and I'm terrified.
---
blizzard be like: 
---
plz no
---
Well the scenario in question is about a purple BoE drop. Depending on the item the group can decide to let everyone roll to sell it on the AH.
---
All good I figured 1000g was ludicrous, thanks for letting me know :D
---
It depends on the item. Some things are best sold, others vendored, others disenchanted.
---
That sucks, will this change in later phases?
---
Oh noooo! lmao 😁😁😁
---
I feel sorry for everyone that just have to have some others' factions mount :)
---
Alt right neckbeards not too happy with your comment
---
CC duration is technically fixed, but there is a chance to randomly break early based on spell rank and character levels. 
---
Melee and gouge have 5 yard range, but the range is based on hitboxes, so mobs with large hitboxes (like Onyxia) seem like they can be hit from farther away. There is also the leeway mechanic which increases the range of melee attacks by a few yards when both players are moving.
---
The best thing to do is just not respond
---
meanwhile i'm in IF offering 1G for some stacks of water and i get no whispers at all
---
You don't use shocks at all because if you use CL/LB and Shocks you will OOM in few rotations. You primary cast LB and LB R1 to fish for CC procs for CL/ES. Also you don't have mana tide as elemental spec.
---
are you me? thunderfury people are selling for a loss on the AH \*eyeroll\*
---
You have to go from 0-300 again!
---
Sorry mate :(
---
This story involves a 55 Elite Devilsaur, a foolish 55 Rogue, and a lucky 49 Druid (me) who was at the right place at the right time:  
---
So I entered Un'goro for the first time ever, even though I'm 1-2 levels too low on my Druid, for a quick fetch-quest. I am not a veteran WoW player, but I've taken my journey very seriously thus far, getting decent gear from dungeons, leveling my professions etc. I am aware that Un'goro harbors some type of strong dinosaur that is revered for their leather, which sells for a fortune on the AH.
---
As I'm done struggling with a regular mob a few lvls higher than me, I look to the side and a HUGE Devilsaur is staring right at me. A Rogue arrives and immediately starts attacking the saur. Although I'm at half life/mana, I decide to give the Rogue a few heals. Not too many, I don't want to pull aggro by accident. I understand that the Rogue is here to loot/skin the mob for its legendary leather, so I won't invite the Rogue to a party, and instead just heal him as a bystander. Because I'm a nice guy.
---
Rogue is at 40% life, I'm almost oom, but the Devilsaur is almost dead. It's going well.
---
Suddenly the Rogue gets TOSSED OUT OF THE SCREEN in a high arch, crit to death before I could blink, the Devilsaur comes running at me and I immediately receive a group invite, which I am too shocked to pay any attention to. I enter bear form, now at 0% mana and I just about manage to widdle away the last few remaining pixels left on the Devilsaur.
---
As a natural reaction I skin the dead mob and receive Devilsaur Leather. I then proceed to res the Rogue, costing me a reagent. But remember, I'm a nice guy.
---
The Rogue whispers me to give (and later sell) him the leather. He started writing even as I was STILL FIGHTING the darn thing. I replied that I'd rather hold on to the leather. After all, without my heals he would've stood no chance at all, I honestly don't know what he was thinking and how long he'd been trying to solo Devilsaurs?
---
Literally 5 seconds later a large group of horde arrive and kill us both. I assume they were there for the same goal as the Rogue.
---
The Rogue whispers "go farm your own leather :( next time" and I go offline, running late for a birthday party but now up 1 Devilsaur Leather. I felt bad and amazing at the same time.
---
He did mention the recent "Ninja Loot drama" which was about a purple BoE. For Green or even Blue BoE's I agree with you. Although I have seen parties all roll for good blues as well. Money is on everyone's mind that early into the game.
---
I'm not your friend guy :)
---
My retail experience, from vanilla through wotlk, rp pvp just means pvp with some contained rp.
---
It kinda sucks for the roleplayers, but a lot of the people on those servers are there because their friends are there, and don't care about role-playing.
---
You'll be just fine there, even if all you want is pvp.
---
From what I heard, blizzard decided on cross realm battlegrounds anyway for whatever reason.
---
why on earth do you have GIANT buttons for your professions and hearth.... 
---
Also beautiful kills. :D 10/10 would also die to you
---
I feel like they should remove the ignore system. Why give people the chance to block out bs... I understand ignoring gold sellers spamming u. But regular players... u lost the ability to learn how to defuse issues. How to meet someone half way. And the general ability to function while bullshits going down around u... But that’s just my humble opinion. Ignore who u want.  But it’s making you all soft.
---
I'm not your dad, cuz!
---
tanked that badboi with Bjarn Bite/growl. whenever my bear was hurting to bad and healer couldnt keep up i assisted with my heals. dmg was enough and he even survived once. the rest im just praying that the rng gods and imp ape apsect carried my melehunter throug. (im trying to do the  Rexxar thing btw)
---
I wonder if this affected me at all in MC. Melee cap is 9% and my weapon skill is 300+5 but higher hit chance = less misses with white attack’s which is where combat rogue damage is from.
---
Fixed it
---
Some people just don't want to tank.
---
You will notice it immediately when you pick it up, and when you dont get it.
---
Yes!! After seeing that thread, this makes me happy that you could do this!! I'll raise my tankard at Brill tonight!
---
Thanks Slippery Jim
---
That was the worst shaman I have ever seen hahaha. They stayed in ghost wolf too long probably forgetting that you can't cast out of it, delaying the totem drop time. They also spent about no time in melee and burned all of their mana trying to heal a 37 rogue vs a 41 rogue. Geez those guys need to learn.
---
To be honest I don't really see the point in full-disc either. To me it seems worse than both shadow and holy. It has some interesting talents to get for sure but going all the way down skimps the potential of the other trees.
---
My approach to evaluating talents is to look at what spells I use how frequently and then go for talents that improve them.
---
How often do I use the wand? All the time. How often do I kill mobs? All the time. How often do I cast Smite? Quite often? How often do I cast Shield? Not all that often? How often do I cast heals? All the time in Dungeons.
---
There's only one other post I've seen of someone on mograine being a dick. I've met with some chill people on there, shame really as some people seem intent on being antisocial and focusing on min-maxing.
---
Hell yeah. I'm leveling with a pure crit+damage increase of backstab/ambush focussed spec and it works amazingly.
---
Sure, I can't pull multiple mobs and blade flurry them down, but I have almost no down time (a bandage during a gouge or after 3 or so mob kills. 
---
The damage is insane. 60% crit chance on Ambush, and if it crits they're 40-60% dead. A gouge and a backstab and they're gone for sure.
---
Plus I'm actually able to gank people properly.
---
Bots get banned.
---
Which part of a word "solo" makes it so hard for you to understand then?
---
Yeah female NE is where its at. How far along are you? What lvl? Maybe it’s worth switching if you’re still set on your Druid
---
I like world pvp and high pop realms and item prices not being dictated by rp appearances idk.
---
Naxx isn't all that difficult.
---
I tried it to works great, but I‘ve read that this is against the rules, do you know how blizzard handles steam link? Do they tolerate it?
---
I always do C but I’m not really sure why.
---
I mean, if you ask someone for food or water and they ignore you, it's kind impolite to message again. If someone kept messaging me after I ignored their messaged, I'd probably put them on ignore too
---
I'm so proud of this community.
---
A Path of Exile player would of included the time invested and repair costs so that profit per hour could be calculated.
---
Yeah if the int or Stam are equal gains I’d always choose the int
---
Why don't you show us the whole thing? I'm sure there's more to it.
---
Any fight you can survive is a win. Even if it means running and leaving your friends to die.
---
You sound unpleasant. It’s just a game bro.
---
I skinned a lot and vendord pretty much everything that I could. After 40 though gold comes around much quicker so dont sweat about it.
---
What loot setting do you recomend for PUG dungeon runs? Need before greed? Group loot?
---
There's far more people on all the servers now than there were back in the day. Vanilla wasn't designed for this many people. You get a lot more bad manners, which is exasperated by the fact resources are over farmed  making everyone you play with your enemy.
---
C because of the distance
---
Go fuck yourself honestly :s
---
Well in phase 1 I want to focus on PvE tanking dungeons and eventually raids. I may respec out of prot entirely for PvP in phase 2. But if there’s an option that allows me to do both, that would be awesome.
---
Just snip it off
---
Me too lol
---
2 kills*
---
I’m straight sword spec, but even raiding I use a fast dagger in my offhand still. Poison procs end up being more dps than the 5% chance for an extra white attack imo.
---
how many people from you group lost 2hours each camping him?
---
I did see the clip of him gkicking the one guy for being a dick to randos. But officer... he might let slide.
---
Hopefully he'll get the message and get this dude blacklisted on the server.
---
Most people say the words " LFM spellcleave  Sm cath (need 2 mage 1 priest) "
---
They write it down just to be more clear. There is so much hate on the termonology.
---
And they have been using "cleave" for many things not just the mechanic of cleaving.
---
There was wizard cleave in arena, beastcleave etc..
---
You can min-max and be social lol...
---
Can confirm. Did WC twice last night because we had missed getting all the mobs for a quest. I absolutely did not have fun in WC.
---
Black mageweave pants on female human.
---
That's all I have to say.
---
Did ZF yesterday, they were advertising the need for a healer. So I whispered and got invited. As soon as I joined someone said to invite another healer that had responded.  They brought in the other healer so we had two heals. Tank decided that we would run as 3 DPs and 2 heals.
---
We ended up flying through the instance and had very little down time as the other healer and I would take turns based on mana.
---
Was definitely a different approach to a 42+ instance.
---
More like Neverwinter Nights.
---
These are the people for whom I conjure six stacks of L45 water while they wait...and put one L1 water into trade.
---
"I gib water"
---
C .. dunno why, i hate you for asking.
---
They can tag a mob, and a level 60 out of party can kill it. Then the player gets full exp.
---
Greens that vendor for 4/5 g+ i will vendor them . Anything below that i hold onto till i have a bunch and get a guild enchanter to de them so when i need chants i already have the mats and dont need to buy them off ah.
---
Gonna drive home from work, go to this inn and have both ingame and IRL a drink in your brother's name.
---
I did too! And we did take left into the alley in the last corridor thinking the dark iron boss was hiding there. Only to find out it was an exit, and the boss is a rare spawn. The tank left so the druid healer found out he would tank the last part. Without a healer we stood before the gnome version of terminator. I tried to explain that there is something you need to do and push the buttons to not be overwhelmed by bombs, right then the druid tank charged in! I as a hunter tried to franticly nuke the bombs before they nuked us, we wiped on 10% left on the boss so the druid found out he had enough and just left. I ran the walk of shame back the 6th time the last 4 hours, deleted my uncomplete quests and never looked back to the pits of hell they call Gnomer.
---
Also, about your lore diss...
---
Sure TBC brought around paladin for the horde and vice versa with shamans, but you are being quite the hypocrite if you are going to take one side in the matter. Both classes were in the lore before TBC. Does Uther Lightbringer ring a bell??
---
If you know anything about the lore, you wouldn't have this opinion. Alliance and Horde are both excellent factions. There is beauty with all the race/class combos, and to dog on one is just hypocritical. Hope you can get past this slump of yours!
---
And even boast with it on reddit :D maybe he feeds off negative karma
---
I'm sorry but Paladins are so fucking boring to watch.
---
A, it's nice and shady in that corner.
---
You can always come back when they’re released. But people here are right, leveling to 60 now is going to be considerably easier than even leveling in the next phase due to how many people are going to be farming the 50+ zones for honor and ranks
---
I used wowhead's "content phase" filter, it's possible that some items slipped through. Let me check.
---
Warlock here o/
---
Spell cleaves and occasional AoE can be kind of fun, but I hate the way some people try to optimize the shit out of it.
---
Personally no matter the group comp, I often like to first dot everything, and once they are kinda low hp... 
---
I sacrfice a voidwalker to hellfire without making the healer hate me, and making it ok for some mobs to swap targets to me before dying.
---
Then I just cannibalize heal/eat and drink, summon a new walking shield battery and we move on.
---
I like to AoE in groups that aren't 100% focused on it. I wait for the tank to get aggro, and only ignore threat if the mobs are about to die, and I have a handy 2k absorb to use.
---
(I play fel domination/master summoner since I love abusing the voidwalker sacrifice while questing, doing dungeons, or fighting off a ganker)
---
IKR, my guild was selling full MC clears where you paid for the privilege of being carried as well as for each item you wanted (we did smth like letting people pay prior to the run for 1-3 items. If it dropped, you got it, we finished the run and we said thanks and bye. If it didn't drop, you were automatically guaranteed a spot in the next raid as well. Naturally we did not sell any legendaries.)
---
Prices were fair, and there were no problems. But it existed.
---
until cat form druid life is basically drinking after each kill, even at later levels if you focus on healing
---
TBH I think everyone is here for PvP. Or at least majority. When BGS come out the game will be perfect and watching wow on twitch will be enjoyable. People are just waiting for BGS if you ask me. Twinks and everything come out then and then then market opens up and the economy thrives.
---
I actually like bonebiter on my dwarf, the whirlwind axe looked almost too big
---
Isn’t that the standard for that guild? Try to ninja what you want before Asmon takes it for himself?
---
I hope you didn't sell the pets for 25g each &lt;3
---
Wanna trade it for a stone of Jordan?
---
Is that a night elf casting demon armor? What witchcraft is this?
---
Is that Also done with a console command?
---
&gt; Ecchi
---
yeah i probably will skip this one then.
---
Yeah he's full of shit. I farmed devilsaur hard before the market on my server crashed and earned 500g doing that and I was lucky. You don't just get 2k gold from normal questing without trying. 
---
What a weird "humble brag"
---
I pity this level of cynicism.  Really sad
---
I did just get strep that put me in the er with some ivs
---
Also please acknowledge my ability to screenshot directly from the computer, avoiding photos taken by potatoes!
---
Sounds like my new character is going to be Nelfdelphine, the moonwell girl bathwater seller (Gnome female though as it's closest to elves, obviously...)
---
I just stand in theie with them pretending to be a  auctioneer.
---
I dont think you could sense my sarcasm and the not-so-subtle push to get people to go combat instead of assassinatino where they can kill me naked with a skinning knife...
---
which greens would you recommend making?
---
FINALLY A FELLOW WEIRDO
---
More demand than dps, less demand than tank
---
&gt;All these guys telling you to just respec. I dont get it.
---
Because leveling a warrior is slow enough and people have figured out an ideal build for leveling as fast and efficiently as possible.
---
&gt;Going arms and being just like everybody else is boring.
---
It's boring but it there's a reason why everyone is doing it - because it's proven to be THE most effective and least gear-dependent method to level.
---
The reason why nobody is dual wielding is because you have a higher overall chance to miss attacks, which means less rage due to missed attacks.
---
&gt;If you wanna stay 2h then you're going to have a hard time in the later levels with rage
---
No, you're not. Your swings might be slower but you generate more rage per hit than if you dual wield, especially if you land a crit.
---
You also get a lot of free damage from Deep Wounds which scales off of your weapon's average damage. The slower the weapon, the more damage it deals.
---
I'm not saying it's impossible to level as 1H Fury but unless you're finding a ton of +hit chance gear while leveling, you're missing out on a lot of free damage by dual wielding.
---
I've seen toxic behaviour of all servers. I noticed today there's been two highly upvoted posts including this one of someone being a dick. But most interactions I've had with people have been fairly friendly or atleast neutral.
---
I am a level 41 Shaman. Where should I go to grind out levels?
---
Mages on Mograine seem to be assholes. Rogues, Warlocks and Druids however seem to all be really nice people haha.
---
If anyone is ever a dick to me 75% of the time it's a mage. They really are getting a bad rep atm.
---
I don't remember which I gravitated towards on Horde. As Alliance in IF however, I always go for the gnome in the A position.
---
some people are straight up dumb man
---
This is the worst kind of argument, the people you’d be buying from are the bots camping the pattern, feeding the problem.
---
C. Because... yeah
---
Yea, I have done this quest before and even looked up again to make sure I was killing the right mob, the oracles, they spawn on both islands off the coast. I think that it was just extremely bad luck.
---
It's great damage in dungeon if you pull agro and start tanking. Setup gives you an insane amount of evises. 
---
I would go 22-24 into sub and then proceed to put 21 into combat
---
Bind it to your macro so you use it every time you come out of shapeshift :)
---
Did I just get downvoted for answering a question haha
---
Is it possible to herb with this you think? I tried doing it from my PC but the mouse is totally screwy and looks up and down and flings the camera all over the place. Haven't tried it on my phone yet.
---
I saw my guildies talk about it yesterday. They were thinking classic could go into TBC, or become something separated, on its own timeline, perhaps with more zones in azeroth being available (emerald dream?).
---
I'd say, play the game while you enjoy it, stop when you get bored, come back next phase (assuming you get bored before the next phase releases).
---
I'm level 40 for now, with over 5 days played, because I am taking my time maximising all professions. Next is getting to 60, farming gold for the epic mount, raiding MC, leveling an alt, hopefully just one. All of this will take me another 2 months at least!
---
Count me in for a Gallow's End drink! Me, my friend and my fiance aren't far, so we'll visit tonight for a toast to your bro. Maybe even drink a lot and puke in his honor (in-game.) :D
---
Kkkkkkkk what's with the guy in guild chat? Is kkkkkk like kekekek? 
---
Also how did you kill him? :D
---
neither, i use Thunder Bluff. its more quite and things seems closer for me and i dont have to "talk" to the banker first before opening my bank.
---
Paladins are considered good AoE tanks I’m pretty sure, as long as their mana holds up. This new instance meta of mass AoE might have something to do with it.
---
It does when it gets in the way of helping others out and not just leaving as soon as you get what you want from the group. Or expecting others to play as efficiently as these 200iq players.
---
That sounds about right on my server, but on some servers it can be twice cheaper so there's no right answer.
---
Obviously not. I'm complaining about the time it takes for me to serve everyone. When someone just says "40 water" and doesn't even thank me it's not very fun, and a thank you is not much to ask for when I have to deplete my whole mana twice just for you. I can't imagine complaining about it at lvl 60 when I can conjure 20 of each, when I've just gotten a new water and can conjure 2 per cast and people still expect the best water and more than one stack, say thank you, it's not unreasonable.
---
It's a 1 hour delay on the first send. If you hit return mail, then it is instantly returned to original sender.
---
Kirtonos has a good population. Medium at really off hrs, normally and at peak it’ll be high / full (longest wait I had was ~6 min). 
---
Obviously don’t know exact numbers, but horde are somewhat in higher numbers, so rolling alliance would help even the scales!
---
They have the next few phases planned out with new content which should take the game to around the 2 year mark. 
---
After that is just speculation but I would assume if it’s still popular something more will be done.
---
The amount of times i make a portal, thinking: The trade window will open soon and ill have 20s to cover my costs; only to be left with the sour taste of disbelief as my client hops into my freshly made portal and vanishes before my very eyes...
---
You can straight up play the game on your phone with steam link, there is a guide for it on reddit.
---
ignore him and move on, who cares.
---
That's barely favored, so no advantage.
---
On servers that have a heavy bias, getting to dungeons is simple.
---
For example on my server there's always a team of horde outside BRD, BRS and MC.
---
Getting those places as alliance is a few death walks away.
---
On the other hand while leveling I never even noticed the bias, and world pvp was plentiful.
---
It's as polite a response as "oh by the way you're doing x/y" deserves when you agreed to join for a different role.
---
Got the classic collectors edition... Diablo is my boy.. Its from a time people enjoyed Diablo :D
---
Make sure you also pick pocket every mob by macroing to your openers. Health pots for days.
---
You get less xp for killing mobs of lower level than you, progressively decreasing until they give no xp at all if you are high enough. Lower level players grouped with you will also recieve less xp per kill as well if you bring any along. Honestly at 36 as a druid you could probably solo sfk if you don't rush. If you have a lower level friend or two (or alts) bring em along to throw you some heals if need be and give em any gear as you shouldn't need it. Sfk is a marvelous zone with a lot of story to it and you'll enjoy it. Bfd can be disorienting and I don't think you'll be missing much if you wait and do that wayyy later.
---
Loot council in ph 1-2 = how to get 35 people to gear up 5 irl friends and somehow think it’s a great idea.
---
wait till you try combining cloth and leather for a druid healing set :D
---
This is why you gank someone who's on a mob and let the mob finish the dude off. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Haha thats hilarious. Will 100% do that when i get to Tanaris!
---
What’s sad I I SPECIFICALLY rolled a Warrior because it was “the hardest class to lvl” so I figured I’d have a nice niche to tank dungeons with.
---
Jokes on me.  Shoulda rolled a fuckin DPS...
---
Tanks aren't needed for a lot of low levels dungeons actually. Even healers. I remember some SM with 5 dps, everyone with bandages and/or self heal, it wasn't particularly slow.
---
Dinged 49 tonight, I think I have it in me
---
Yeah you were quick at leveling and are quite "spoiled" by the amazing Raids Blizzard is making in retail.
---
I also think that PVP (if you like it) could hook you back again. Because at that Point there is a reason for you to farm the gear. To be able to wreck other People a bit more :P
---
Besides that I'd say you will have to wait until we get new raid Content with P3. The raids do get harder. Especially AQ40 and Naxx. MC was just the beginner raid I mean - afterall - it was the first raid People have ever played when WOW released. I guess they went easy on the playerbase in the beginning ;)
---
You are good - just enjoy retail a Little bit while you are waiting but be sure to come back once P2/P3 is around :D
---
I paid 50s on a baby character because the initial run from ogrimmar to tbluff sucks.
---
The game basically makes you naturally interact with people because the leveling content either needs grouping up, or people can have great use of your buffs, healthstones, conjured food, etc.  
---
This makes you communicate, which forms bonds.
---
Meanwhile on Retail you do not need to communicate with anyone and with speeding through the content extremely fast you won't be talking to people. Not to mention the crossrealm mechanics, sharding and phasing cuts you off from the playerbase and make you run into people who are not even on your realm so you likely won't ever meet them again.
---
Classic also has a very chill feel and you are really in the same world as the others unlike Retail that's just a mess with it's several expansions, and everyone having their Fortress of Solitude.
---
What do you think about tauren paladins?
---
!RemindMe 8hrs
---
Green man bad
---
I love when I find the Tauren named Gnomestomp, have you seen them?
---
If you haven't already, read up on downranking.
---
The one with biggest crowd because I  always forget where they are in the building
---
Frost nova (and all slows) wouldn’t have worked because the paladin had freedom on - as it didn’t in the video.
---
Just start spamming BRD IMO. You can probably get some arena/prison runs at 50; 52 should be no problem, and full clears around 55.
---
You can get shoulders, two trinkets, gloves, weapon/offhand/staff, back; all BiS or next-best BiS. Then there's an ok~ish robe, belt, bracers, fire res gear, etc. that will make you geared enough to do MC/ony without setting foot in another dungeon.
---
At 57, if you can find a group you shouldn't have issues running Strat/scholo/LBRS/UBRS. Most of the other gear you need will be from UBRS (neck, trinket, an ok ring, random devout set pieces), with a couple from LBRS/Strat, so just jump in those whenever you can.
---
I started on grobulus. First guy I said is a level 60 night elf hunter, 
---
I say: "awesome gear"
---
NE Douche: "hows it feel being a virgin?"
---
Me: "you would know"
---
NE douche: "I would kick your head off your fucking shoulders if you werent behind a keyboard kid" *ignores me*
---
Me: "nice"
---
*NE Douche ignored you*
---
3 bars from 55, but I'm working 4 10s!
---
They go for a big diff because undeath drops in droves if you're farming scholo/strat. You get a ton of them where as the rest are pretty rare and require some heavy focus farming.
---
My server i literally funded my epic mount from 100g-900g off farming water and fire essences in felwood. It took me around 3 days of farming, pulling 200-300g a day selling what i would get in 2-3 hours farming them. I'm a hunter so it's a bit quicker and have mostly my prebis including hand cannon. I had hit an absolute perfect sweet spot where a ton of casters were hitting 60 with patterns burning a hole in their pocket. I hit a massive rush of people hungry as hell for essences. They were selling 12-18g each. Results may vary, good luck!
---
It was the heaaaaath of the moment~~
---
At least  Mik Scrolling Battle Text can do this.
---
Because its fast
---
Yep. Everyone acted ten times more entitled than these days. This community is by far better because many \*think\* this is how the community were, making people role-play into that type. That and the fact that people have grown.
---
that was tbc.
---
I usually look at the famous characters in game that are similar to the one I'm rolling to get an idea of what the name should sound/look like. Then I usually pick a letter and start testing out sounds until I find something I like. For instance: I started a druid when classic came out named Kaltheros.
---
You can change gamma in options.
---
I'm getting downvoted for saying something good about any other version of wow then calssic or something, this is the classicwow sub after all  
---
I thought it was the wotlk system that forced you to specc all the way down a tree so be able to specc another one and cata was the modern system with 1 talent every 15 lvls. But yeah the cata system sucked, easily the worst one, still with "dull" stats to get to one last talent but chance of having any fun with it
---
I'll be there tonight on Hydraxian Waterlords (EU) if anyone wants to join for a pint or six!
---
It i make the group, i make the rules, what is so hard to understand about it? You dont like it? You can find another group or make one yourself, there is bothing bad about it. Especially if i want only this one thing and pass on everything else
---
PvP servers are not fair. 
---
They are Xvs1. They are lvl 60 vs lvl 30. They are "Guy with 10% health fighting a mob" vs "Guy who has 100% health". 
---
There are no "fair" fights on PvP servers. No one likes corpse running. People will attack you if they feel they are having an advantage. No level 30 will attack a lvl 60, they hope "Pls ignore me". 
---
And even if both of you are at 100% health. One of you guys might want to kill those last 5 questmobs and hearth to an inn, because he needs to log off in 10min.
---
Why do people play on PvP servers? Because quite a number of people likes being the superior player in those scenarios. To a ton of people it's fun to gank lowbies. To play 5vs1. To kill a player at 10% health. 
---
And a large amount of players live for the turn arounds. When you are at 60% health and still kill your ganker. If you are 1vs2 and win. 
---
But never ever expect fair fights on a PvP servers. If you want fair fights /duel.
---
Looks awesome! 
---
You should level a character where you draw their evolution of appearance... Fresh level 1, level 10, 20 etc, all the way up to clearing each raid for the first time! :p
---
That mofo got the jump on me other day. The moment it is in melee range you are toast if you don't have mobility. If it hit you from behind you are probably dazed so you are toast anyway.
---
The most ridiculous thing is I never seen him again. XD
---
It’s a problem in terms of whether or not I consider paladins good tanks.
---
Nice one captain obvious 👍🏼
---
The paid stuff from taverns is waaay more expensive.
---
RPG was always a lose term, since Role Playing covers a very broad spectrum.
---
No, you don't even need any kind of stats to have an RPG. All it would need would be the ability to play a charachter role as you want. So it is about choices, story telling,  customization and self immersion.
---
Dark Souls fits all of this, you pick your own charachter, you make the choices for it. Yes there is a somewhat given path to do, but nobody stops you from murdering everyone else or to help them instead.
---
It's a *kilt*, a *kilt*, ye ninny!
---
Most comes from BRD and later so i didnt start until 54 to get it.
---
Me and my buddies looking for the Serpentblooms.
---
You don't need to be prot spec to wear plate
---
Ah, sorry. Too many pedantic arguers here and I'm getting warped.
---
So far I've seen a lot of tanks not actually tankning. They just DPS and it works wonders.
---
Stance dancing without Arms tree is a mess. You need  Tactical Mastery from talents to do that
---
And that's what you see happening here? Show me on the doll where the "minmaxer" hurt you...
---
Kudos to the rogue but it could have gotten a lot better.
---
If you really want to get good at rogue and learn it. Practice killing people while naked and using skinning daggers as sub.
---
Once you get through that, practice doing it without losing any or losing very little health.(100 - 0% stunlock using cds).
---
After that, most 1v3 situations are trivial if they jump you unless they DOT you.
---
GL!
---
Also gj on the clutch 1v2 kill.
---
I mean I'm a priest,  it's just frustrating seeing people try to defend specs that are obviously not properly balanced lmao. Whatever direction blizzard wants to take after naxx if enough stupid people believe these scuffed ass threads talking up garbage it's less likely to get considered to be made functional

**About us**
---
We are a group of foreigners living in Korea and are looking to find a fun group of players from either abroad or Korea. We allow both English and Korean in our guild chat. While most of our Korean members do have some some level of English we want them to be comfortable to speak their native language too. We like everything that WoW classic has to offer: dungeons, raids and PvP. We are still levelling and we want a community that helps each other to reach the endgame together.
---
If you would like to join our guild, have any questions, or would just like to have a chat please do contact me on Discord @Kaiwa#8568 or in-game whenever I'm online on 카이와.
---
Thank you!
---
That guide IMO is super meh, there's a few items that aren't even BiS and it doesn't show any replacements for next-best; meaning it expects you to shell out like 1k on world BoEs.
---
https://classicwow.live/guides/31/pre-raid-bis-for-holy-disc-priest-in-phase-1-pre-dm-patch-of-classic
---
Whoever compiled this list did a much better job for priests.
---
As I said, no need to thank me for my int buff. There's a huge difference between one cast and spending 2 minutes on conjuring items. Spending that much time so other's doesn't have to spend their money deserves a simple "thx". If you're to lazy for it just do a macro once "Thank you!" and press it when you get water and you'll never have to write it again.
---
Easy to get to as an undead character, though the last few steps towards Brill might be a little hairy if you're still level 1. Brill is a little settlement directly North of the Undercity, you can't miss it if you follow the road.
---
Will be at Gallows End tonight at 8pmEST on Skeram having a drink for your brother.  Hopefully you will find that he will always be with you in your memories, and sometimes that is all we need.  I miss my brother and I fear approaching it, I am happy you took your steps.
---
I use rank 1 swp for a dummy dispell, or to keep them in combat as well.
---
I swear 80% horde on my server are dipshits. Only attack you if you have mobs on you or if they are levelling with a friend
---
mine is not funny but still was quite satisfying .. 
---
was in WC with a grp me playing my tank and leading the group through the WC labyrinth - the rogue in our group was obviously not too experienced but yet thought its a good idea to go all out on the targets as soon as I charged not caring about where he popped out of stealth - 1 out of 2 pulls he managed to bodypull the next pack or pat too resulting in chaotic fights a few deaths but no entire wipe ... so after the 5th bodypull he did, I asked him if he could wait a bit for me to pull the packs back - his response: he called me an "elitist prick" and ranted some more - I just ignored him from that point and just went on ..
---
now here comes the good part: rogue on our way up to Verdan pulls a patrol - 3 people of our grp die - healer and me still fighting managing to win the fight after what felt 10 minutes ... NOW the only one who didnt wait to see if we win the fight was the rogue - HE HAD RELEASED - so while we went on as 4 after rezzing, the rogue now at the entrance of WC got lost and wandered around till we picked him up at the entrance - he even said something in grp chat like "alright I learned my lesson ... just tell me where to go" - this was actually priceless the priest and I had a good time laughing our asses of ... 
---
TLDR; Karma can be a bitch.
---
What country do you live in that hospital mash potatoes are viewed as being something that are worth getting excited about?!
---
I hope your Guild Name is “R.E.M. Monster”
---
Lol people put way to much stock into racials.
---
Enhance for sure. Less downtime. If you aren't min/maxing, literally everything is viable. Some specs might take a bit longer, but will get there just fine.
---
This is a reference to something and I don't know what it is and I really want to know
---
Well, I went home and got these things. I'm in california
---
but prep made you....prepared.
---
Wont switch, lv45 with mount so too invested already.
---
132 is pathetic for a ret pally with good gear. Something else is going on there. I can hit 250-300 in my gear. But even that much is barely better than the main tank in a raid. I totally feel carried as a ret paladin in raids.
---
I mean, taking a break for weed is not that different from grabbing a drink or a smoke or a bio break.
---
Talking about it as if it defines you is pretty telling, however.
---
Heroic Strike is a trap. It looks reasonably cheap for some good damage, but it completely kills your rage flow for minimal damage increase. Its rage costs are very deceptive. It says 15, but really is 15 plus whatever your next normal attack would have generated, which ends up at more like 25-30. Only ever use it when
---
- you're about to rage cap (=hit 100 rage)
---
- it's the last mob before you have to regen/move, and you would lose the rage anyways
---
- You're fighting a higher level mob that is orange or even red (because it removes glancing blows, which significantly reduces your damage). 
---
Your most spammed skill early on should be sunder armor. The guide posted by someone else in a comment seems very accurate regarding a leveling rotation. Follow that one. 
---
Very specifically regarding leveling with a priest: A priest gets mind blast at level 10, which does good burst damage and increased threat. If your priest uses that on a mob, you can fully expect that mob to run to the priest immediately, no matter what you do. Either you taunt it back, or you let it run. Generally, your leveling should be more effective if the priest focusses on healing you, maybe dotting enemies that live longer and wanding instead of casting offensive spells. With that both of you should rarely have to drink or eat, so while mobs die a bit slower you move at a very steady pace.
---
Man, I MT'd in vanilla, tbc and wrath. I played DK in Legion and BfA. If I wanna DPS it's because I'm fucking sick of tanking. And it's my choice, not yours.
---
caster mobs are much less scary if u make sure you use dampen magic, and the correct elemental shield. Between Ice Block and Fire/ice Shield you should easily be able to kill a caster at your level without taking a single hit. For tankier/higher level casters than you I'd reccomend tanking ranged until your shield breaks then counterspell them just before their next cast gets off. You should be able to easily kill them before/just after the counterspell wears off
---
Ignorant question.. but how does he look like a dog?
---
Insane how much better the world looks when it's not glowing with radiation
---
Dude it's arguably scarier when you see him, and you're like "aight I'll steer clear of over there".. then next time you look back and he's gone X.X
---
You should beat everyone at 60. Against wars bleed them and kite them in between charge range and out of melee range using crippling.
---
We have the best slow in the game.
---
I actually like BRD better, you're *rarely* doing all of it. Usually, you're either doing an Emperor run, Jailbreak, or farming the Arena. 
---
I mean, sure, if you're like in a full group of level 55s and you want to do every single quest, you'll be in there for 6 hours, but, that's not what usually happens. 
---
Meanwhile about 70% of ST is going around two circular hallways clearing trash and stopping every now and then to kill those stupid undead trolls. It feels endlessly more repetitive than BRD does which actually has a good bit of variety. 
---
On top of that, BRD contains numerous pre-raid bis pieces, so you feel like you have a good reason to go there. 
---
Mercifully, you can get away with doing ST only once with all the quests, or you can skip it and just grind some more.
---
And on Blameux, my guess is there's lots of people doing it.
---
I should have brought the old bastard to life for the full experience! Not the same feeling when i don't lagg my ass of in Orgimmar. Probably Id need a new table though, if my screen really is as large as i remember.

It’s my man Wabash or it’s nobody. He’s taken care of me for years.
---
None, I’m Alliance. Horde scum!
---
You eat with goofballs in your throat lmao... they have gone down, but it was very awkward
---
Yeah don’t underestimate the cost of ammo, or speed at which you’ll tear through it. Nothing worst than having to hearth out JUST because of ammo
---
Arms tanking dungeons leveling is viable. But if you are strictly going to do dungeons then prot would be the way to go. 
---
Most players don't do this so specn prot is very inhibitory to speed of questing in the open world.
---
Coz it takes a lot of time and mana to make water of decent level. And time is gold/xp. Sorry we don't have a lifetap.
---
I consider your inventory and wallet my final boss. Game over, you won
---
I'm kind of late to this discussion, but I was wondering how viable the Felheart Robes are due to the +1 chance to hit with spells? I suspect that could rival Robe of the Void, but looking for confirmation.
---
Right, that's what I was saying about the maximum damage being important. I know that affects special abilities, but I'm unsure if that affects the total dps calculation seen when looking at attack power
---
A. have no clue... Now I'm asking myself that question
---
I think he means since execute uses all your rage Anger Management might not be worth it.
---
If I joined a group as DPS I sure as hell wouldn't accept anything else. Why should I accept that this idiot can't find a tank?
---
Well if he dosen't respond he might have missed your messege. It's kinda rude to ignore people. (I'm a mage and get several whispers every time i'm in a capital respond yes or no to everyone)
---
Nice.
---
A because that's where the cool kids go *dab*
---
Guy was rude to you for sure.
---
You can tank almost everything in this game as any spec, if you are a Warrior.
---
Try and not stress those peeps.
---
On the topic of tanking, Classic may not be as fun as it could if you don't tank ever. Missed opportunities if you will.
---
Take care out there!
---
I ran through SM LIB by myself for like 6 straight hours.  Ended up with about 65 green BOEs from the two chests.  I now own a mount.
---
I had to check which sub I was on
---
McConnell is also a toxic manchild. Dude throws hissy fits and begs for shit all the time.
---
I feel ya.. sorry to hear that but you’ll be looking at that male for a long time then
---
Approrpiate Lenny Face
---
Pure chance. Got a /tar macro for all of them to make sure you're missing them?
---
I think Horde is actually more like 60% of the playerbase or higher.
---
It's one of my favourite dungeon.
---
The lore, the atmosphere, the maze that is is, the cool bosses.
---
I just can't wait to do it again.
---
It's not the most time efficient one though, but it's a blast
---
How
---
But these are high level characters and it's a skull mob D:
---
IIRC the jump used to be much harder and then was nerfed? The current one you can just walk off and land on the other side, I believe.
---
In MC, BM you do more damage than MM, but MM gives TS aura to your group. But your personal damage as BM is quite a bit better, beastial wrath is OP man. With such a low CD you have it up for every boss fight.
---
My guild has 2 hunters and we let them go BM because there is no room for them in our melee groups anyway, getting shammys in the melee groups for WF was more of a priority hence letting the hunters go BM.
---
And here i am riding on a completely silent Kodo and it is creeping me out.
---
Now that's just funny
---
It's the people around you. The people I have been running with are all fun to be around and helpful, we send below market price items to one another (a guild mate of mine sold me a Wardens Staff, a 300g+ item that is Bis for 100g in an extreme example), we help each other complete quests and grinds, once we have a couple items in a run we pass to spread the love etc.
---
I've met a few assholes, I make a note in my add on and avoid them moving forward
---
The price sounds somewhat reasonable and if it is around material cost, that sounds like you got a good deal.
---
Ive gotten 1 sold lmao, gonna save em for now and comeback in the weekend to try then
---
We've not a raiding roster yet. I'd like to use ep/gp really, it worked nicely on my private server. Its disadvantage is that if you go afk for a long time and come back, you can get a very good ratio fast
---
Sometimes I just wonder why people don't use /roll. I guess its main disadvantage is that it does not care for your seniority in the guild..
---
You need to make a youtube video with a 1,000,000G per hour average title
---
I think he's making a joke lol
---
Depends.  I was level 60 early in week 2, one of the first 60s on my server.  At that time it was fantastic to be a 60, the community was tiny and all of us at 60 knew each other and were friendly.  I met some people I still talk to regularly and we all put in overtime to help each other get geared.  I haven't experienced anything like it.
---
Starting the end of week 3 though, and into week 4.. the quality of player at 60 has declined massively.  You can no longer depend on dungeon groups to be patient and competent, far more asswipes running around, far more entitlement and selfishness.
---
I'll be honest, I always found ST to be a depressing setting &amp; can drag on with a bad party (but so do most classic dungeons)
---
Has decent drops (aside from the class quests) so it's worth running at least once, for the sake of doing it + gear.
---
A bad green would be something like mail with only +shadow damage. Nobody would use it. Or cloth with, I think tiger is +str and +agility. You need an idea of what the different classes care about statwise.
---
Every time you participate in a raid or kill a boss you earn some number of Dragon Kill Points which can then be spent on gear when it drops in your raids. Usually you are simply allowed to bid on items. So say there's 2 rogues and a perdition's blade drops. One rogue has 1000 dkp and he bids 500. Other rogue has 750 dkp but he bids all 750. The other rogue can choose to bid more, or let the other rogue have it. 
---
It basically just means you will eventually get gear by participating alot.
---
I heard there was a way to "force spawn" them. The rares spawn where the zombies walking around by themselves are in the courtyard so if you kill those solo zombies and wait for a respawn the respawn could be a rare.
---
Where can I found out more info bout this
---
Layers are dynamic. On a low pop server, there is typically only one layer except during prime time. I’m on a high pop server and if I get on at 6am on a weekday morning there is typically 1 layer but when I check at other times there’s always at least 2, sometimes more. I do this by having different guild members invite me, and if I have 10-12 different people invite me and I never get a layer switch, I’m assuming there is only 1.
---
The big issue is going to be the handful of mega populated servers that have multiple layers 24/7 and will still have nearly as many people by the time phase 2 rolls out. They probably have 10-12k or more concurrent players now and the vanilla world really can’t handle that many people gracefully, as Nostalrius found out.
---
Completely agree here, unless the group all agrees to actually give it to someone in the group, any BoE epic, especially BiS ones are 100% NEED i don't trust anyone.
---
Cycle of meme rolls on. By next week people who hate on mages will be declared idiots who just don’t get how good the reduced threat talent is.
---
That Mark Jacob's segment was hard for me to listen to just because of how much nostalgia I have for WaR.
---
I was like 16 when it came out and I totally bought into the hype. The uniqueness of the order vs destruction was amazing and has never been recreated for me. 
---
I had totally forgot about the Tome of Knowledge and how innovative it was to MMOs. I remember relentlessly pursuing so many tome entries because they had cool rewards like in game name titles.
---
I was not ready for the nostalgia hit this morning.
---
This is funny because not only are feral tanks just as able to stay alive as warrior tanks, even more so before the warriors get BiS gear, they do higher DPS. So you actually kill faster with a Druid tank.
---
Because at heart everyone wants to be a warrior.
---
Soul Pouch. You can craft it or buy at AH.
---
What's epgp?
---
Can you hear ingame sound or just be with attention to the bubble pop?
---
To be fair, a warrior DPS is better than many shitty DPS probably invited to that party. Just because you can tank as warrior doesn't mean you have to. Especially not after being invited under the impression that he is a DPS.
---
It is a special kind of dungeon, murky and, at least the first time, quite mazy and confusing. Pretty cool from lore PoV, but then again, you are high enough to do (parts of) BRD which will probably net your better gear. Coincidentally, that place can also be maze-like and confusing!
---
OMW to Gallows End right now. May your brother rest in peace.
---
[Can someone explain to me how this player is a human and a horde?](https://imgur.com/a/HsCbK94)
---
It’s a leather helmet that drops in Zul’Farrak called Embrace of the Lycan. Actually there are a few of them with this skin, druids also have one called Wolfshead Helm.
---
I just play on &lt;DND&gt; and have Add-ons block everything 😏 got to love quiet and relaxing leveling.
---
There’s been a rogue in every single dungeon I’ve run since launch.
---
It was me. I’m a rogue.
---
Yep, and we even tired getting a rouge to check ahead and see if they spawned, if not we would reset and wait the hour after doing it 5 times.
---
That's a shitty and very toxic way to look at things, bro. If someone owns up to being wrong, they're brave, not hypocrites. Such a bullshit thing to say and believe. But like you said; cool, do you. 
---
Take care
---
I wonder if every shaman has his totems in slots 1-4. I know I do.
---
Another tip is = set camera to first person, walk inside character, and THEN - tap to NPC.
---
Economy is fine and honestly it helps people doing peofessions because the amount of people farming mats the more supply the less cost per unit.
---
Then maybe don't spend your time on a discussion forum where people share their experience from a 15+ year old game.
---
Only good for heal druids, but I mean when you are shapeshifting you can see your character model anyway...
---
I'm taking my time enjoying questing but I have this...issue...of helping others around me. I spent 2hrs helping this random complete that escorting quest in The Barrens (that shredder thing with the goblin) after he missed out since he didn't the hand in the first part fast enough before our group activated the escort, so I waited again just to help him out lmao. I can't help it :/
---
I too had this genius idea.  The input lag made it so that I couldn't click the bobber in time.
---
I used to like him before he sold out.
---
The welps in the bottom left corner in front of the cave with the blood elf inside. I had a quest to collect dream dust and it took awhile because there were always other people or I was getting ganked. Right as I got the last dream dust I needed, I accidentally aggro'd another one and it dropped the emerald welp.
---
Am I the only one who loves huge, sprawling dungeons that have no mercy on you? These are not the bite sized, linear loot corridors of retail, but places that feel like real locations that you are invading. Maybe WC is a bit early to have such a design but by the time you hit ST or BRD you should be prepared.
---
They might be listed, but that doesn't mean that they are selling
---
Don't listen to those who "done it"
---
It's all about us healer, and I fucking urge you, put on a fucking shield for the love of God.
---
There's also a fear that in a month or two it will be significantly harder to find people on the server to complete your groups.  Nobody wants to be spamming LF1M tank once all of the tanks have geared up and are no longer interested in dungeons.
---
I made a mage 40% so I could make people water.  It's a running joke in guild that I have an addiction because in between pulls, when I get a new teir and can only make 2 or 4 at a time, I'll be making water so I always have multiple stacks to give out. 
---
Someone in discord mentioned they left town without enough water and were questing in a zone way higher level than me.  I found the area they were farming, got up on a mountain, slow fell across half the zone like a god damn paratrooper, gave then 4 stacks of water, and mage ported out.  Special Ops Water Squad.
---
God I love classic.
---
Oh well certainly the end game content is more difficult in retail. I’m talking about leveling. Leveling in retail is a fucking joke. You don’t have to worry about mob pulling and resources or mana. When I’m solo leveling my mags, I NEED to group up with people in classic. I can’t solo tank elite mobs to get quests done. You actually have to group up with people
---
Primal Fury (Swipe itself can refund up to 15 rage per hit) + Enrage. At lower levels you won't have that, so you might need to take damage to get rage... but if you're using Swipe that often you're going to pull threat on at least one or two mobs anyway.
---
As a mage on Mograine I promise I try to make up for the rest.
---
Always handing out water/food (mostly free, except that one time I only made 2 at a time). always portals when people ask.
---
This is only on Horde side of course, but it's probably rather evenly split on both factions with mage douchebags
---
Yea I think it’s like a 15 min respawn which could also just respawn the elites.
---
The conjured food disappears after 15 mins after logging out. Bought food doesn't. I think I would just fork over these 2g.
---
I was in desolace trying to kill a named centaur that was my level who has 2 adds.  As a Priest.  
---
So what does every class do when there are too many adds?  CC one!  Well the only CC I have is Mind Control so I procede to Mind Control one of the adds.  While I am mindcontrolling I get a random invite that I decline.  MC'd add dies and I kill the named with a mind blast and mindflay.  Then I notice the guy who sent me an invite has started whispering me that I am the biggest POS for not accepting his invite.  I explained that I don't accept random invites and offered to wait and help him kill the centaur since he was 3 levels lower than the mobs.  He starts cussing me out and telling me how horrible I am.  Literally all the way back to shadowprey he was whispering me and then said he was going to report me for griefing.  
---
I just gave him &lt;3  and /ignore after I was sure he wasn't going to stop
---
If there was yelling on a Friday, it was us.
---
Do you want more videos of noobs trying to gank a higher level and just dying?  I have one of a rogue chasing my priest as I ran through darkshire.  Shadow Word Pain and Devouring Plague just about killed him by themselves.  Never even turned to wand him.
---
What is a jump?
---
Problem is pet stay is bugged right now. I stopped using eyes of the beast, becausebI would cancel it, then my pet would attempt to run back. Canbjust put it on stay as i hurridly jump down, but better to be safe about it
---
What a fucking ultra-shit argument. You go back to retail, fucking idiot.
---
Some bugs in vanilla also got fixed. The ones that happened to be unfixed at the very end shouldn't be immortalised.
---
It’s chill just watching a movie or some TV while fishing. I’ve made macros to equip my rod and cast and then equip my weapons when I press my main attack. Great for bouncing around with friends then whenever they pause or sneak off to mine, herb or skin I can whip out the rod and fish with one button then be back to the task with another.
---
It stands for Effort Points/Gear Points:
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/EPGP
---
That depends on the server. Im on Morgraine EU and here its the alliance that avoid pvp ofc unless theyre 3v1
---
Interesting. Thanks for the info
---
This. Frenzy is the only thing that will affect the damage output of faster attack speed pets, but the difference between a 1.0 brokentooth and a 2.0 pet is a huge amount of frenzy uptime.
---
However, there's the side-benefits of faster attack speed, like more consistent threat generation, faster pushback, faster responsiveness to intimidate, etc.
---
Less about 60 though; it's great for leveling and you get full frenzy at 39 so it's before you're even halfway to 60.
---
Yes! Was flying over and was checking general chat. I miss Barrens chat!
---
Communities that oppose alt-leftist socio-political cancer that is a trend in the current year and which literally promotes white genocide (thousands of blue checkmarks on twitter) is bad, I got you. 
---
Everyone should bow to the alt-leftist ideology and accept it, or else get ready to be silcenced, censored, publicly shamed and, when the alt-leftists finally take the full power, executed.
---
I had 50g at level 40. A friend lend me 40g, which I could easily pay back 2 days later at level 43. I didn't farm for that gold. He was away for a week anyway so I would have had a week to get the 40g.   
---
You'll get that gold pretty fast by just questing and maybe running a dungeon occasionally.
---
Not at all. I'm upset that the DPS and Healers have no concept of aggro or threat, think every tank in a PuG can do what BiS tanks on YouTube Videos can do and get salty if you don't pull a full room because you'd die before getting into LoS position.
---
B. Always. Not sure why.
---
Only stops movement impairing effects for 10 seconds. Which gives the mage time to create distance
---
Yes! I miss Barrens chat.
---
There's quite a few quests throughout Classic where the Horde is trying to impress the Alliance or doing favors for the Alliance to bring the two factions closer together, usually where Thrall gets namedropped by NPCs in the matter. Thrall's personally stated goal in saving the Bronzebeard princess is to get on Magni's good side.
---
I legit want those balloons in game now.
---
I am constantly swamped with whispers asking me for food and water, ports, and dungeon runs, and I ignore them all. If I took the time to reply to all the whispers—never mind actually doing what is asked of me—I'd have no time for anything else.
---
I don't remember the nonstop messaging being part of my original vanilla experience on my mage. Just the way information is disseminated now about the game and mages in particular has resulted in the class being viewed and played differently than it originally was.
---
So I hit 60 on my mage and binned him. I don't want to be seen in the same light as the masses who are currently playing the class. I'm now leveling a feral druid; that'll definitely cut down on the unsolicited whisper spam.
---
A shaman is really a must have in WC, it just clears alot faster when nobody can fall asleep 🤗

Mara is going to blow your eyebrows off

I'm not a PvP rogue, but as a fellow rogue, you do the SI:7 proud!

Are you on a RP server?
---
Its like 2005 is back
---
I got kicked from a SM Library group, right before the boss, because we had just wiped and the group leader never released. After we all ran back, I typed into chat that the graveyard was right outside so they can run back like we did. Didn't even say it to be a dick, just to be informative. Then they kicked me.
---
Ooooph.
---
Attention.
---
B
---
At 34 you can probably get started in Stranglethorn Vale. But note that the zone is very crowded and there’s constant PvP going on. Also the quest levels go up to late 40s, you will probably need to switch to other areas then come back in a few levels time.
---
Other areas appropriate for a lvl 34 are Arathi Highlands or Desolace, later Duskwallow Marsh and Swamp of Sorrows in the late 30s.
---
Personally, I like to switch a lot between zones, with the exception of Teldassil and Darkshore  I’ve done every zone in the game.
---
For cat go strength over literally everything even if it's cloth
---
. It gives 2 atk power per point. Agility is a close second. For bear, use agility leather with the highest stam.
---
Sorry for you loss, man. This has me choking up.
---
Yeah, honestly I'm surprised how often I see "MH reserved" advertised.
---
dat food buff tho
---
Did you.. lick your son?
---
To be honest with you you are in a bad level range. Around 40lvl, I gave up world quest because most place you can at that range are known PvP hot zone. If I am you, I will do an sm cathedral for exp or time to time RFD for okay exp until 44-45 range.
---
If you head north from Tarren Mill you run into the ogres, hang a left as soon as you can and you run into Yetis that are higher level.
---
You can also head north from the area around the cave where the yetis spawn in Hillsbrad, and when you cross into Alterac you'll start running into the higher level yetis.
---
There's even a named one up there.
---
At first sight he looks like a dog in armor.  
---
Which race is dogs in armor? ;P
---
I'm not sure you're getting the point.
---
They weren't trying to quest and just *happened* to be tagging mobs before I could. They were actively stopping me from gaining xp because they were mad I tagged a quest mob that they also needed.
---
That's griefing.
---
26 actually
---
Every MT in vanilla want's def, nasty back to back crits are one of the worst ways to wipe a raid.
---
Yeah, anyone who's cool I friend. Also there are some note add-ons that I hear are pretty good.
---
Had to check lol. It's just shorts/pants not hot stuff.
---
I never played retail after wotlk, so I wouldnt know.
---
I thank them when they know what threat is. At least two times so far!
---
Pretty much my story too except I have it up for 65g.  If it doesn't sell I'll just hold onto it.
---
I don’t feel like the reaction they’re trying to get is some rando they don’t know exists ignoring them entirely. I don’t take it seriously in the sense that I won’t sit there and argue with them, but I also just don’t care to see it so I leave the channels. I feel like that’s the best solution because it *doesn’t* give them what they want which is validation that they’re getting a rise out of someone.
---
Alliance side not surprised
---
Exactly
---
At this point, I just prepare to trade the person who won the roll.  Even when I turn auto loot off, I've found it doesnt even register half the time.  Luckily everything is tradeable and the loot appears in the feed, so I can be sure to give everything in full to the winner.
---
You technically can't use real people or famous fictional characters' names. In 2005 my good buddy had to rename his mage away from Billbrasky. /sad
---
There are two jumps. The other one has you jump to a platform first.
---
I mean I hate meter spam in chat but that's a bit much.
---
Imo if you wanna see your ranking on a meter, download a meter.
---
Your Lua can be shortened to:
---
    /run a,b=PickupInventoryItem,PutItemInBackpack a(3)b()a(10)b()a(7)b()a(8)b()(12)b()
---
If you’re not using aimed shot — it’s fine. Don’t listen to the bullshit below. The only benefit from a slower weapon is bigger aimed and multi shots and less clipping of auto shots. If you’re just yoloing with serpent though? Probably fine. 
---
(Verdant keeper’s IS better though, and free.)
---
For sure. Was in an LBRS with a mage that insisted we didn't need CC and we could just AOE everything. The other DPS were a hunter and a rogue, those caster mobs hit like trucks. It was an interesting experience.
---
I wouldn't consider a run that is 30/10 guild/pug a PUG, though. I healed Onyxia yesterday with another guild and both T2 helms were given straight to guild members, without any roll.
---
They never mentioned anything being reserved, but it's to be expected, this early after release that a guild would want to gear their core members first.
---
If it was a straight-up "Trade Channel PUG" I'd agree that reserved items would make no sense, especially in a short Onyxia run.
---
First off, are you on a RP server? Can’t name your character after real life people and (at least on RP server) can’t have multiple words in a name, that is part of the naming policy. Usually the policy is only enforced if someone reports it. I had the name moonfirebear for around 10 years and finally had to rename my druid because it broke the policy and I made someone mad so they reported me. My friend then named his druid moonfirebear and hasn’t had to change it yet.
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
---
Could you tell me how to set up Luna Unit Frames? I load it up and it is in config mode where everything is open and then I can't get out of that mode. There is no mini map button, it isn't in interface, and /luna menu isn't working.
---
Why did you put ONLY in all caps. Never heard of dragon breath chili?
---
It’s not part of your opener though. People often use games as an escape. Don’t immediately dredge that up as soon as you meet someone. At least get to know someone first, don’t be an awkward fuck then complain you put people off.
---
OR GET RICH TRYING
---
Pretty sure their guide is about efficient use of gold mainly right? You likely have no idea what it cost you to get to 300 tailoring. Perhaps it wasn't the most efficient method. 
---
However, like you suggest, sometimes efficiency means time. If you can earn gold doing other things, then are you really saving gold by taking more time to level tailoring?
---
This is how I look at it:  Have more than a few hours a week and prefer your time spent in game to feel rewarding?  Play World of Warcraft: Classic
---
Have less than a few hours a week to play and want to still accomplish the same amount as anyone who spends 80 hours a week playing?  Play World of Chorecraft.
---
I do this on the flight master @ Ratchet.
---
I dinged 40 yesterday and after buying my mount and riding skill I had 18g left. 
---
* I only bought the really necessary skills throughout leveling 
---
* Swamp of Sorrows: grinding mobs (high value gray items) and herbing Blindweed (these went for 1-2g per stack on my realm)
---
* Stranglethorn Vale: fishing for Mithril Bound Trunk. This was my greatest source of income, but it yields no xp for the time being
---
So yeah, I could comfortably afford my mount once I dinged level 40, but due to several hours of fishing I reached level 40 very slow
---
Ahh yes. We weren't too hot on the spelling part.
---
Legit gives me a headache. In 2004 I got wow on christmas to try and I played it for a week and had to quit from the headaches it would give me, I figured id try again this time around and just bought a sub and still getting headaches but hopefully this fixes it.
---
Duskwood is my favorite. I'm almost tempted to start an alt to hang out there around Halloween time.
---
Expect roughly 200 hours to reach 60. Take it one level at a time
---
Just farm some gold and buy a Krol Blade + Mirah's Song. Takes less time unless you get super lucky in UBRS
---
2) is kinda meh. Yes UD and Orcs are strong at PvP. But so are gnomes and dwarves who both have strong AF racials.
---
I do agree that humans to some extent are weaker, and Night Elves have 0 useful PvP racials at all.
---
&gt; I never charge for food or water, either.
---
This. And I also don't accept tips either case. I yell to everyone, "DON'T PAY FOR SIMPLE CLICKS". I mean, paying an enchanter, I get it, he invested time and effort. But paying for water is paying e.g. for Fortitude or Spirit buff.
---
Also also, what's wrong with people and they don't like lottery portals.
---
So we humans are in fact dragons?
---
Hi, /u/Pullovermatthias

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dbc0pp/why_do_npcs_stack_up_auto_attacks_if_you_kite_or/). 
---
It’s more about managing it all. The tanking itself is not hard per se, but the constant attention to everything is a stress.
---
Hey just a heads-up: it's 'per se' and not 'per say'.
---
Agreed with the comment!
---
You just need more big dick energy my man
---
You know... not all his viewers are on that server.
---
I know this is the truth because it hurts.
---
You didn't think of anything. Sounds like you are using a guide.
---
When utilized properly it's basically just currency for showing up to raids used to purchase raid gear; but it runs into a lot of problems that a benevolent loot council can solve dynamically.  
---
Examples issues from my time in the game include:  
---
Resto Shaman outbids for the token from AQ40 and buys a 1h enhancement weapon because in 4 months time enhancement can dual wield in BC.
---
Holy paladin outbids the main tank for a major shield upgrade because he thinks it looks cool.
---
Rogue outbids hunter for legendary bow.
---
No decay leading to someone that raided in Naxx and accumulated points coming back in Serpentshrine Cavern and taking a bunch of gear to then go play arena and stop raiding.
---
These types of things over years tend to lead to longstanding guilds moving to loot councils.  The more cutting edge your raid, the less important gearing your character becomes to you; because gear will flow to you whether you're going after it or not and you would rather down a new boss because gear went to the right raidspot than be a boss behind and bumped your gearscore.
---
Glad it only took mass attention on reddit for something to be done.
---
I don't understand why some people decline the invite. You're clearly doing the same quest I am, but if I'm killing mobs and you're killing mobs when its a Kill X #, you just halved the mobs there are around you to kill.
---
(don't get me wrong, there's also been really nice groups too, that stick around until everyone is finished, at least that balances out the others)
---
BRD is a whole evening project. You can easily spent several hours in there. Special if you go for a full all bosses, quest, and events. It’s awesome, don’t get me wrong. But damn a marathon, special if it aren’t a solid group.
---
If you go the correct route the only "jump" is on the way up to Verdan the everliving. They nerfed the distance some time in vanilla and that is the version we have today. No jumping needed.
---
I just say I never learned them, am too poor.
---
Saetric is ignoring you.
---
Right, he said, "So I don't say anything and just move down shore a bit..." and goes on to go on the offensive about being followed. I'm saying that you must be the one with the issue if you can't start the conversation with something pleasant from the start. 
---
This is Classic WoW, we've been lauding the community aspect of the game for years and saying that's what WoW has been missing for years. Then we have cases like this where people are complaining about someone just trying to hang out and be friendly and talk.
---
Upvote. Once because Chartreuse is my favorite herbal liquor. Second because I faced the same issue :D
---
Played with a rogue doing SM other night. His lock pick skill was like 35 at lvl 40 and he said he barely pick pockets anything. I was like, that's the least rogue thing you can say
---
If you download questie addon you can just open your map and look around at zones to see how many quests you have available in each zone and what level the quests are. Will help you out alot on where to go.
---
Guild spam is annoying
---
You deserved it tbh
---
you could turn the brightness down on your monitor?
---
Got it after two kills. 😶
---
Is there a way (or addon) to differentiate my DOTs from the DOTs of other warlocks in the group?
---
I got it at 39 gold yesterday at the AH. Literally had an orgasm.
---
I'm on Firemaw and the issue is running cencus is all fair and good but these servers are notorious for queues, which imo just skews this data even further
---
52 here, but it take my two days to take one level during the week, on other hand I take 2 to 3 level a day on week ends, can’t wait to farm my BIS
---
Makes me wonder why those in Brill can keep the buildings clean and those in Tarren Mill won’t. I know the second floor is used as a jail but most of them still live on the first floor.
---
Every number helps, had a Shammy on the boat to BB try and 1v2 60’s. I was lvl 42 so popped some cooldowns and jumped into the fray.
---
He reincarnated and we killed them pretty easily. I think they were super salty cause I got chased around the zone and camped by them afterwards but like I said to the Shammy “it doesn’t feel as bad getting killed by 2 60’s as it would them getting killed by a lvl 42..”
---
Pretty sure they hated Jesus because he was telling people to just be nice to each other and that they didn't have to kiss the Pharisee's ass or sacrifice chickens anymore.
---
It's from the manga jojo's bizarre adventure, where many characters have powers named " Stand ", making them Stand Users.
---
And as one of the main character say in the most iconic part of the serie " Stand Users are drawn to each other "
---
Keep a stack of Coarse Gorilla Hair on standby
---
Bless people like you. Last time i was giving free water was for hunter, he asked for 3 stacks when i was doing 4 bottles a cast. Then he killed 7 mobs and logged off right in front of me. 
---
Ever since then, when i get ask for water or food, i ask back how much they pay for stack. 90% of the time they won't even respond me back.
---
The hardest part about raid tanking is getting the spot.
---
The only reason people suggest playing arms/fury is because solo grinding/questing with protection spec is much slower. If you are just tanking dungeons then protection spec is fine.
---
Well I farmed solo and sold every single item to vendors except for rugged leather, runecloth, and a few others I use. 
---
I didn't spend time fucking around with the AH on bullshit greens. The only AH I did was selling devilsaur leather at later levels. 
---
I also bought bags asap while leveling to collect more loot to sell to vendors.
---
Yep, mages are the new huntards. I'd hear the argument for warriors too, but it's mages. Through and through. The sheer overwhelming amount of people playing mages that just AOE everything regardless of how many mobs there are or how much threat the tank has is staggering. 
---
Conversely hardly anyone's playing a hunter because of the amount of upkeep and because they know they won't do big boi deeps in AQ/Naxx.
---
Are you on Kirtonos?
---
To add to classes that could do it as fast.
---
Feral druids can do the same single target exp/hr (some faster some slower). 
---
Mages are either way faster if not casters or slowly behind (dont remember if these welps are casters)
---
Locks are either faster or slower depending on player and spec.
---
I will say the nice part about the hunter is you dont need to pay attention.
---
Looks like ur ally on mograine. Feel free to supply name and horde will camp his arse. Much love undead priest
---
Don't you ever question me and my son's relationship ever again
---
I disagree. Even if you are tanking dungeons exclusively, Arms is superior Prot while leveling.
---
The speed factor is less of an inhibitor than not having Tactical Mastery and Anger Management
---
And being prot and trying to generate enough rage and  hold threat with a sword in board is a uphill battle, considering how impatient DPS are, and everyone wanting to just AoE down every pull.
---
Eh it's no different from a dps being actually decent in a group tbf. If you're decent you'll be paying attention to everything just as you should when tanking and help the tank pick mobs up properly for example.
---
Imagine being the type of person who takes an entertainer seriously.
---
I thought they fixed that?
---
orc hunter
---
As a rogue, yeah people would rather bring a mage.
---
Stick with it, it will be worth later
---
You can literally see in the picture how B is the furthest away.
---
idk I just consider it dungeon prep as a mage.   
---
My alchemist makes potions for people that I trade (+str +stam +2hp regen +defense, what ever I got on hand). My enchanter will offer low level enchants if people want. Low level ill offer the caster a wand on the cheap. Mage (hes low rn) will pre-summon water and food before entering LFG or while in the process of LFG.   
---
Its not rocket science.
---
I have yet to see a good warrior. And i'm not just talking threat generation. The average warrior I see takes like 3 seconds to switch stances and intercept. And dont get me started on warriors initiating a fight with taunt. Feels like every warrior is a clicker.
---
Turn off the damn error speech .. nice 2v1 tho .. sincerely , rogue
---
I will stop by tonight and toast as well.. Gallows End will have a party tonight on Skeram, in memory of Gorishural. May his spirit live with Saurfang and the Horde.
---
Yeah my point I'd like to see more info on this but it looks bad
---
My guild leader said he's done 156 UBRS run for the MH...
---
Rebind that to V asap.
---
Miss old A Friend, the inspiration to do this in the first place!
---
For some instances it's incredibly far. Rfd/rfk or SM as alliance are brutal
---
You tip? If I even remotely touch the subject of a tip people get very angry with me.
---
Healing Rain turns Rain of Toads gay.
---
You can't use a mount or fly with noggenfogger too.
---
Considering you're the one mistaken I guess you're correct.
---
Probably since the internal alpha even earlier...
---
I'll have to try this, thanks!
---
I think the point is that you can get away with not paying attention all the time as dps and still not wipe the group. If a tank does it it’s another story.  I am mainly a dps warrior and I tank from time to time. And it’s a lot of added stress as a tank. You somehow feels responsible. As you should ofc. Pick the mobs to pull, decide where to go next, watch out for your healer, try to keep aggro on as many mobs as possible rotating sunder on different mobs etc. As dps its more chill. Just make sure you dps the mob the tank is fighting. Maybe you have to catch some adds etc. You don’t have to watch the healer. And you basically just waiting for the tank to make the decisions etc.
---
No farming required for me, just grabbed skinning at lvl 1 and vendored all the leather along the way. Highly recommend it.
---
I love how vibrant it looks. Blasted Lands and Durotar get that extra reddish colour that just looks amazing.
---
Sunder is almost always better to use than heroic strike.
---
How do I move around where the plates are located?
---
What is your macro?
---
Enchanters seem to get angry at this but at the end of the day, even a smooth run has repair bills. Typically you get 1-2 things to vend a run which covers it with a little extra on top.
---
Thx I’m crying 😭
---
Right but I'd like to see more info on this, the post looks ambiguous
---
What macro are you using?
---
I am a level 41 shaman. Where can I grind to get good XP and drops to sell?
---
Its deadmines, you can 2h tank that fine. Actually preferred by most so you can actually hold threat
---
Oi, 43 hunter with a unpopular opinion here who's about to buy it as well!
---
My theorie is as follows. With the fast attack speed of 1.5, my Improved Aspect of the Hawk will proc more often. Thus increasing DPS even more since I kill mostly with 'white' damage.
---
I save a lot of my mana during questing, and save the mana for utility or for when I suddenly get attacked by players of the opposite faction.
---
Also, I really want an epic weapon. This will imcrease my DPS no matter what. Besides, if you can miss the gold (and I know you can), go for it!
---
It does chew a lot of bullets, but for me that's worth it.
---
I know I am set for it. But you decide for yourself. You'll get a better weapon at 60 anyways. And yes, slower IS better for PVP. But for questing this is totally cool.
---
I'm not sure what your comment is implying, but I ran Onyxia yesterday as a level 58, in leveling gear and definitely pulled my weight.
---
See my other comment above for an explanation of how over half a healing Priest's talent points are pretty much irrelevant to his performance.
---
B  
---
Because if someone ganks B and another Auctioneer, it's a similar distance to A or C.  
---
If I went to A and someone ganked A and B, I would have to walk all the way over to C pretending like I didn't see anything.

***&lt;Hope Rises&gt; | Casual-friendly “mediumcore” | Raids once per week for the life of Classic | Horde PvP | Herod***
---
Founded back in 2014 on the principles of positivity, loyalty, and freedom, &lt;HR&gt; has gotten a rez for Classic.
---
• Though some of us will be putting hardcore hours into Classic, **we will “officially” raid just once per week on Tuesdays (+50 wife points) starting in January 2020 so you can level enjoy the leveling process! (We are going to be leading PUG raids in the interim)**
---
• 8 PM Central start time for raids; raids will last 3-4 hours as needed (we will "officially" begin raiding in January 2020, with unofficial PUGs filling in the time until then)
---
• Optional Saturday raids at roughly the same times
---
• Freedom to spec how you want (particularly early on in MC and BWL) so long as you are also willing to change to a more meta role when asked (probably way down the line — like AQ-40 to Naxx).
---
• Active round-the-clock guild with numerous casual members so there should always be guildies to level with at your own pace.
---
Though many of us have raided Mythics in retail, we are committed to enjoying each other’s company and the mostly laid-back nature of Vanilla endgame. If you are impatient, easily frustrated, or are seeking a “world-first” (lol), cutting-edge, every-world-buff-is-mandatory hardcore raiding experience, then our guild is not for you. If, however, you jive with our vision of Classic and would like to join the family, or would simply like more information, feel free to comment here, DM me on Discord (Oleon#2355), or pop by the guild Discord and introduce yourself in #General chat here: [https://discord.gg/HkDRhXY](https://discord.gg/HkDRhXY)
---
Thanks, everybody! Hope to see y’all in Azeroth! \~ Oleon
---
Really? I played with a paladin named Billbrasky for all of vanilla, TBC, and Wrath without issue. I also never realized it was a real person.
---
This is why I posted the kills and not the time, took somewhere between 8-10 hours.
---
Doing this gives people an average on gold per hour for themselves and is much more intuitive imo.
---
This man will never get food or drink. Time is not free, nor is our mama pool. Quit bitching , or go buy stuff for the vendor.
---
I expected that to happen, and my jaw still dropped lol...
---
And you could have made much more by AHing stuff.
---
'Tis
---
Yupppp
---
Mages be like "you want water? I require gold to spend my mana" 
---
Every other class be like "free buffs for everyone!"
---
  Then they wonder why everyone hates on mages
---
SPACEWOLF???
---
Lmfao that dead ass racoon is my fav meme
---
I've ran into a bunch of douchey mages when I ask them for water.
---
THE BONE BROTH
---
Even the best guilds on my server mostly run SM/Ruin.
---
DS/Ruin does *slightly* more damage. The main difference being Shadow Mastery is 10% damage, Demonic Sacrifice is 15%.
---
SM/Ruin gives you Imp Blood Pact though, which more than makes up for it, while also giving you a lot more solo ability.
---
This isn’t Olympus guild chat we don’t care
---
After completing ZF we were taking a break, this UD mage takes off his clothes saying they can't get wet and go "swiming" on Gahz'rilla pool. After a while he says his bones are dense, sinks, and just dies there. 
---
It was funny.
---
Gnomer is great with a good group.  The random assortment of people that haven't a clue what they are doing that early in the game always makes for chaos, however.  I did it once for the quests and never went back with a reminder on why I hated gnomer to begin with.
---
I farmed the Pattern: Robes of Arcana in Darkshore.  
---
Did the math, you have around a 98% chance to have the drop by 300 kills, I got the drop around 290. I was getting pretty frustrated around 250.
---
&gt;Seems like a bunch of confirmation bias
---
This *is* the internet after all. :)
---
Desolace, hillsbrad foothills, Arathi highlands, strangethorn vale, thousand needles.
---
None of these zones are exclusively for your level but a selection of the quests will be
---
Yes. You need a 2nd account in the party that is outside of the instance. I use a bank alt on another account to do it, but you can have a friend do it as well.  
---
You promote them to leader. You kill your bosses (Tinkerer, Rot, then Princess). Logout (everyone in instance). Have the party-leader "reset instances" when everyone is logged out. You will be back at the place you teleported in with a fresh new dungeon.  
---
You can only reset 5 times per hour, so if you are only running 1-2 bosses you can easily hit this cap and accidently get teleported to your hearth location.
---
Pallies and Shamans have roughly the same type of healing. Shamans do have chain heals, and I don't know if Pallies have an AOE heal, but otherwise, they both have the single long cast time heal and the single short cast time heal. And Retro shamans (the equivalent of Holy Paladins) heal quite well in instances if appropriately geared. And it's not just a question of level as Paladins are known as the best healers in 40 man raids.
---
Note: I am talking specifically about healing instances. Obviously, when questing, even in a group, no one expects you to be decked out primarily in Int/Spi gear.
---
Just keep questing away and vendor all the trash from mobs. You might jot get it the second you hit 40 but should be good to go before you hit 41
---
so when you duel a warrior and he charges what are you supposed to do besides los-ing and running before the duel starts?
---
Wow a pet with 2 swords. Nice
---
Healbot. And that functionality has been and still. Is broken. No add on should play the game for you.
---
It’s always the healer
---
There is way more supply than demand of wicked claws. And the bag space they cost is not worth the potential markup if they should rise by 4x the current value, for me atleast.
---
Ally or horde?
---
For portals i always get money (atleast 30s) without saying a single word. Normally 50s / 1g.
---
Food usually about 20 - 50s
---
i never said you couldnt take them, i just wish people would be more up front about the fact that they only exist as an excuse to not shard spell damage plate. if you really wanna go for it, go for it, but a couple of classic devs had a 14" hate rager for hybrid specs so dont try to tell me you're just as good as a rogue lol
---
In Retail, no reagent neccessary.
---
Kui nameplates/icehud have options to list only your dots. This isn’t on the frame though
---
And then go into naxx with half T1 gear?
---
Thank God! Yes it'll be fine. Just a bit harder for aggro. Hope your groups follows marks
---
There's a guild on Kromcrush named Infowars. I wonder if they have roles based on people actually in Infowars i.e. guild leader is Alex Jones, officers are Paul Joseph Watson, etc.
---
Found Tom Brady
---
Ninja quit because he wasn’t good and had never played the game. It’s his job to be good at games. He made a business decision, asmon didn’t make him quit . It sucks that me and you have the same voting rights :\
---
Good morning Stormwind-Cho!
---
Get a low level hunter to kite it from alterac mountains, hope he doesn't aggro anything at all through the entire continent? Idk, blizzard work in mysterious ways.
---
Most of what Alex Jones talks about is technically true, but he puts a demonic/alien/New-World-Order spin on it to sell it to tin-foil hat conservatives who otherwise wouldn't care that rich people do evil shit. 
---
Nobody cares about the frogs turning gay unless it's part of an intentional conspiracy by ~~the Shadow Council~~ the Cabal.
---
Sadly, he will at some point be forced to change his name. At launch, me and my buddies joined a guild &lt;INFOWARSDOTCOM&gt; which was forced rename only after a week and a half. It wasn't because of the "DOTCOM", it was because people had reported the name and Blizzard found it unacceptable.
---
Pretty lame.
---
Thanks. I was in Thousand Needles yesterday and thought I needed sunglasses.
---
Since you're a mage you need to find an aoe grind spot that drops ah high value items
---
?? You legit asked what he could've done differently, and that was one of the biggest problems here.
---
My guild never reserves... We just got it last night and we had group loot on.
---
We only run with guildies and 1-2 pugs tho.
---
First thing I‘m going to do tonight is drink one in Gallows End for your brother! Thanks for sharing this story with us and all the best for you and your family!
---
hey man if they brought you along coolio not like it takes 30 mages to clear mc lol
---
Uh.. yeah save the tips until after you get the mount. It’s nice and all but until you get the mount you should only tip Rune costs or you Will never get that mount
---
I’m a C sucker
---
What do you mean by most appropriate heal? Healbot will automatically select the highest rank of the spell if you map the name of the spell to a click. You can also make it automatically dispel debuffs with any click if someone is afflicted with a particular type of debuff. But no addon is going to pick what spell to cast for you based on missing health or whatever condition. I do vaguely remember an addon functioning in that way but since it’s basically making decisions for you I imagine it was banned.
---
Make healer friends that are like minded and find your dps for the run.  If the healer and tank are on the same page you can easily replace dps or let them die if they do stupid shit.  They’ll either leave or learn or get kicked.
---
As the tank you have the most leverage in the group.
---
The post reads as if he basically asked everyone to give him the item, in a weird way.
---
They did it for the challenge.
---
Yea I healed an SM Cath aoe farm group. Me, three mages, and a lock.  Full clears took about 20 mins.  Did 3 runs in an hour and a half with bio breaks.
---
I just do 1g cause it’s easier makes someone else’s day and made your life easier plus at lvl 45 you can make a g in 5 min
---
yea same. I was very pacifist in the beginning but it just ended up with me dead and frustrated all the time. Some will say don't stoop to their level but I don't know how else to enjoy a pvp server if I'm not doing some of the killing as well too offset when I get killed. Then at least when they get me, I feel like I deserve it and it's less rage inducing.
---
or they were sending me abusive PMs and moonfiring mobs they saw me walking towards, but hey, you can go ahead and be wrong in your life.
---
Classic worgen 10 times better than cata worgen.
---
jesus this reddit is full of 30 year old man children idiots who cant take jokes.
---
I had assumed they were dynamic, what I meant was they are lowering the layer cap by server to fit the population there as it declines until it's fully stable.
---
The plan is to remove it all together but clearly that's not happening across the board unless Blizzard rolls out a ton of brand new servers with free xfers when P2 goes live, which I also don't see happening lol
---
I feel layers are here to stay and server economies will wholly be based around the heightened resources until populations drop to more vanilla-like levels, which won't happen for some servers. I never got to play on Nost, but did get pretty far on Lightshope until a server merge happened and we were forced onto a server with like 9k+ population. That was a nightmare and I hope Blizzard won't simply allow for megaservers just to avoid layering lol
---
When I try to pase this in the "import profile" box, I get an error: "Invalid AceSerializer table format (no table end marker)"
---
I figured it offers for more everyone if I excluded skinning, since not everyone is a skinner.
---
When I try to paste this in the "import profile" box, I get an error: "Invalid AceSerializer table format (no table end marker)"
---
I love how they have all the staff to ban people for names but do nothing against gold sellers and exploiters. Bravo ActiBlizz! I wouldn't expect less from you.
---
I'm a simple man
---
I see asmongold, I downvote
---
RuneScape?
---
I love it. Let’s get a Mr. No Sleep but for WoW
---
I second this! Though this barber should be able to perform plastic surgery as well :D
---
"Well met!"
---
As a druid i'll never forget the group that said to me "druids aren't people and can't dps". Now I realize that was obviously a spellcleave group and better off for me that I didn't join them.
---
Damn that's high on your server! I was one of the first high levels in the zone and knew about those patterns. I waltzed up to her and bought both I think 3x while leveling. I couldn't get 5g for either on auction after multiple postings. I waited a week and pretty much broke even from what I bought them for and what they finally sold for. Sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you get screwed lol.
---
There's a rare spawn shadow caster in the shed by the farm in North East arathi.
---
You made me think there was a holiday coming up...
---
I got what you NEED!
---
“Wait, how is he playing a worgen in Classic?”
---
who joins a pvp server and then throws a fit when someone pvps
---
Lowest buyout on auction house on my realm is 90g for about 2 weeks now. It's always the same guy trying to sell it, with no luck. The prices for SoJ are seriously fucked up right now.
---
Imagine being so stupid that you greed roll bis boe epic
---
Now being on an RP server I wanna do this. this is wholesome af.
---
I was questing in Barrens the other day and a group of Tauren were passing by saying “Mages suck ass!” 
---
I know mages get a lot of shit now but damn that was unnecessary and rude!
---
To be fair normal retail raids are harder than vanilla raids. 
---
I really wish they would have buffed MC and Onyxia. It's really sad how much of a pushover they are.
---
in both org, SW, and IF i always go to the left-most one.  no-brainer in SW but apart from that i think it's just habit of a western person to go from left to right (as with how we read)
---
2-3 stacks for 50s!?!? It's literally free and takes you seconds to make lol.  I wonder how many people have you on their ignore list
---
Different ways to play, doesn't necessarily mean one is better than the other.
---
If you main a 60 and alt to 35 in this time you have other problems....
---
Eh. I have to pay for the upgrade cost to get higher level food/water. It also costs me my time and my mana. Plus a few silver tip is WAY cheaper then what people would pay at a vendor for similar food.
---
I mean... I don't think it's quite that we're shocked, just more frustrated that it's followed us into adulthood. The people saying this shit are late 20s, early 30s. Just because something used to be pretty common doesn't mean you're not able to be frustrated by it. Imagine someone calling your gay friend a F\*g and telling them they should kill themselves. I think you'd be pretty pissed at them.
---
Agreed, it impacts raid group composition and is not really RP/Lore friendly.
---
I miss smoking weed and playing at night :(
---
FWIW I am Canadian, but from the French province, Québec. Whenever I leave the province and find myself surrounded by English speakers, I absolutely love being randomly called 'buddy' by strangers. It's kind of heartwarming, Idk. Even in Toronto, someone would bump into me let's say, and then apologize, "Sorry buddy!".
---
Dismiss the pet hunter...
---
DISMISS THE FUCKING PET HUNTER!!
---
*makes the jump and pulls half of the instance*
---
OMFG JEFF! THAT’S IT, I’M KILLING YOUR CAT!!
---
If you're at a point in your gear where it's worth going DS/Ruin you don't need the utility of having a pet out to clear 5 mans. At this point we're running tanks with 2 handers. 15% extra damage is worth infinitely more than 420hp on a tank who isn't dying either way.
---
I'm betting you aren't 60 and definitely don't have an epic mount. Why are you trying to tell me how I could have done anything faster?
---
You just want to bitch and pretend to be better than people while having no way to prove it.
---
The people saying you're an asshole for saying noob lol are the type who like to exaggerate everything in their minds to make themselves out to be the victim.
---
Yeah. I agree with this.
---
I’m a mage doing ubrs yesterday. Our tank decided to pull mobs down to the ledge on top of the dragon eggs etc, which i thought means trouble. Usually you stay on the side of the ramp so you don’t get kicked. So ofc I het kicked down, but I manage to kill all the spawning whelpling by myself and ran back up informing that I’m bringing one mob with me. Other mage goes ”there’s always one guy...”
---
Briarwood Reed drops, 6 needing and I get it. Justice!
---
Problem is, so many don't know how to play the spec, they think they can just go about the normal rotation. If you play around the locks' improved shadowbolt, then you're hitting 20% harder and it can really make a big difference if you time things bassed on that debuff. People tend to think that debuff only affects single target spells that use a charge, (5 charges) this is not the case, and DoTs and Drains (like mind flay, drain soul, drain life, etc) are affected by the debuff and do not use a charge.
---
Keep this up! We need it. &lt;3
---
Yeah I think there was a little island platform you jumped onto first, then jumped again. So it was a total of two jumps.
---
kinda shitty - my chat goes by super fast an I miss PMs often. dont mind the 2nd PM. You might have been AFK or not seen it.   
---
if you say "no, sry" and they msg you thats something. But you can't blame a person for not understanding what silence means because you could be afk or not looking at chat.  
---
If you walked up to someone and said "Hello" and they had no reaction would you just immediately think they want you to fuck off or might perhaps think they didn't hear you?
---
I had the same irritation, turns out they changed the 'highlight on mouseover function' to 'highlight on portrait mouseover'. shame.. #nochanges
---
Horde-Mograine here - most interactions I’ve had have been great. I think the pool of people that are goong at your pace and you interact with most regularly tends to match up with your own situation; I’m an adult with a 9-5 playing on weekends and evenings, and I get the impression that most people in my dungeon groups and questing zones are in more or less the same situation. My experience is that this demographic is on average more pleasant than the stream-monster type who’s grinding it 18 hours a day and has forgotten how reasonable humans interact in the real world.
---
Don’t allow achievements to be linked in chat.
---
Reminds me of the warrior on my server named Infowarrior
---
Maybe a dumb question but do different vendors buy items for different amounts? Eg should I sell leather to leather vendors and not other random vendors?
---
I always make a point to loot dew &amp; mana pots from strat boxes. Always carry ~120 on me in case there are no mages in party and potions are useful in raids because I'm too cheap to use major ones.
---
What's the addon that tracks Blind (CCs) like a bar?
---
You are extremely talented
---
We were not a private server guild, most of us came from retail and played back in vanilla. MC is a joke now when everyone knows whats going on. We already have cleared mc for 3 weeks now, and like 4-5 ony kills.
---
This one hurts. They were going to be in vanilla, which is why the stones are there, but at the time, they didn't put the summoning action in until BC. Now, 13 years later, we all get to stare at useless summoning stones in a museum version of vanilla.
---
If the shoe fits :/
---
I alway /y to see if any mage is making some in city when I login, and always tip 1g of course. Doesn't cost the mage anything but afew seconds to make and saves me gold.
---
&gt; Many zones have local quests that require groups and only wish to find people nearby without spamming lfg channel.
---
I've never said they can't say LFG. Either you're okay with spam or you aren't capable of reading properly.
---
Got mine for free from a guildie. But your AH price wasn't bad
---
Grind Jungle Thunderers in STV for 38-40. Should net you like \~40g or so.
---
420 /69 /69
---
It's usually people who just don't respect common courtesy when out and about. 
---
I was wrapping up my grind in the shimmering flats when I came upon a horde warlock while killing gazers. I give them a /wave, not wanting them to alert everyone in the zone to some dickhead rogue ganking before I'm done with that godawful place. This idiot sends their blueberry after me and I'm able to get a stealth off before they land dots. One chain CC'd moron later and I'm back to killing gazers.  
---
Soon after a group of 3 horde arrive and start aoe grinding gazers, bit off more than they can chew and I rush in to help save them. They didn't have a skinner and from then on made sure to loot all the corpses and /beckon me over to skin em. Easiest stacks of hide I've ever gotten. 
---
When I returned to hand in my last quest an equal leveled rogue decided to stealth right in front of me. I play a human, and perception is *strong*. Another body later and Im on my way, but not before we landed kidney shots on each other at the exact same time. 
---
I'm still stuck in STV because the pvp opportunities just keep falling into my lap. This place was like vietnam for my mage back in vanilla, but as a rogue I'm a kid in a candy shop. Sure, I die plenty, but it's given lots of memorable experiences and Im grateful for it.
---
No changes
---
And here. we. go.
---
A hunter won the MH rend weapon off me (I’m a Rogue). He then replaced it the next day. I was fucking pissed.
---
I can make a group, reserve what I want and still get a group faster than a dps.
---
Asmongold is a sick change my mind
---
Now Timmy, did you remember your P O S?
---
Looooong story short: It depends. It's impossible to generalize this way. But here's the easy answer: Sure, whatever works for you :)
---
Hmm I went back the next day and Jaina &amp; co were still there.
---
Yeah I never snapped at him. After moving a bunch I asked him why he was following, then told him why I want to be alone.
---
The calculations are totally confusing. Total Raw Gold is there twice, and the number is different... and in writing this comment I realized that "Total Loot" is referring to his total gold earned.
---
&gt; Raw Gold: 16g 89s 00c
---
&gt; Raw Gold: 31g 99s 51c
---
&gt; Sold Loot: 149g 56s 00c
---
&gt; Total Loot: 181g 55s 51c
---
That’s the top 1% at best though.
---
DONT DO IT ANAKIN
---
also desolace
---
You are not the first one writing about this (beyond retarded) dick move and Asmons defence. It's not understandable how a big wow streamer defends ninja-ing. His arguments are thinner than water. But hell.. I've seen like 1-3 hrs of his streams and even then it was quite obvious he's someone that definitely can't handle fame.
---
This guy should not be that popular but he is. Glad he's on Faerlina. Porb the most F-ed up classic server at this moment.
---
Warriors first then hunters second still for me. Most mages I group with know what they are doing.
---
We were trying avoid damaging her like it says in the quest description. The comments online are mixed regarding if the quest can be completed if she is damaged. We stopped worrying about that on the last two attempts.
---
You should have fucking exposed them
---
You realize that about half of a Priest's talent points have no impact on their healing efficiency whatsoever, right? Obviously, I'll pick up every single talent relevant to my spec that does affect my throughput and my mana longevity, how much of a moron are you to assume otherwise?
---
It totally, definitely has to be bots. There's surely no way it could simply be other people doing the same thing you were...
---
Exactly lol, this kind of ninja looting is a “stupid tax” in my opinion
---
Some folks have their identity so locked up in classic wow they can’t handle the thought of some type of change like this that isn’t really that big of a deal.
---
Could also be potentially your display depending on which colors are being rendered in that area.
---
Glyphs, gems , whole JC and Inscription, achievements and more mailboxes in towns
---
At 1g you are starting to get to the point where it is more economically feasible to buy from vendors.
---
Cries in holy paladin.
---
Solution: No plain instance kill achievements.
---
Its called confirmation bias
---
streamers bad
---
Yeh I thought about that too, I think you’re right.
---
"Imagine being so stupid and following agreed upon loot rules"
---
You just hate on Asmon, instead of clipping the entire thing he was saying, you only clipped that part and to make him look bad. Idk how are you not ashamed.
---
"LF1M Tank Strat Live"
---
When you see it once, you'll see again every few minutes for the next hour. Then, a whole other group of players spams the same message before the 1st group even finds a tank.
---
Any amount is too much. I haven't charged for a Portal since I got my mount at 42.
---
I don't know about food but I throw PW:F to everyone I see and it's so rare that I get AI back.
---
One thing I've liked about Classic is that not everyone knows the dungeons, so it's nice to explore them. Finally found that Wailing Caverns jump that everyone dreads by going the wrong way, since normally everyone goes the safe route with the easy jump.
---
Yeah the ZF zombie farm is definitely exaggerated. Or it's an absolute best case scenario thing. 
---
He quotes 50g+ per hour but that's if you get like 8-10 greens per run at least. 
---
In practice, it's about 25-35g per hour which isn't horrid but not quite what was quoted.
---
Because he likes being pigeonholed into one spec/role or paying a 100g fee every single time he wants to do something else.
---
Or idiocy. Both?
---
Those are wings :)
---
Isn’t that next Monday, not today?
---
How do enh/ele shamans fair in dungeons?
---
/run BuyMerchantItem(30,1)
---
Then you do 2x or x3 their dps in the boss fight but they say nothing.
---
Everyone who said they were playing warrior before launch is now playing a rogue.
---
I was running through wetlands headed to badlands when a lvl around 18 attacked me. I /ponder’d him and he continued to attack me so I bit him in travel form and killed him. 
---
So some people really believe red = dead, but in most cases it people only pvp if at a real advantage.
---
Take my upvote
---
But is he friendly from a Horde perspective? He was talking in Orcish so I assume he was
---
I get it too.... Not that he doesn't want to do it with People below 60.
---
It would just be so much more hearthbreaking to see a 56 win it while he has run enough BRD to get from 50-60 twice just to get it xD 
---
then a 56 Comes along and gets it first run.
---
I think I would quit the game xD It is not because he doesn't want to - I think it is for his own safety. Otherwise he couldn't guarantee that his Keyboard makes it out alive
---
&gt; It’s just puzzling that a singular class-race combo is by far most notorious for behaving as described in OP.
---
they're not
---
Not many other fights from memory, BWL Nef fight is risky for a druid because he forces druids into cat form and cannot shift out for the duration so you can get squashed.
---
Thanks for the answers. While i know about the spirit tap and wand specialization spec. i have always struggled to see Why spirit would be good in a raid setting, since you always are in combat when you are healing? Apart from 3/3 in meditation for that 15% regen, how is spirit Any good? Guess i should’ve framed the question better
---
Dude....I'm not in this guild... look at my post history. I'm literally a new player, playing on a completely different server (kromcrush).
---
I've never seen someone react so strongly to finding out they replied to a copypasta before. I think if anything is a sign of being "miserable" it's how worked up you are over all this.
---
I'm 57 so I am right there with you.
---
It's not worded very well at all, but the sentiment is understandable.
---
Yesterday I was doing a run with a warrior almost infamous for his HoJ runs. Fully 60, great pre-raid gear, but no HoJ and he'd been running it for a week or something. Kicker, he'd never even seen it drop for 50 runs. 0.96^50 = 12.9% chance to not see it drop once during that time so it's perfectly plausible.
---
We got the drop and a rogue doing BRD for the first time was with us. We all offered to pay him to let the warrior (who I'd never met before) get his HoJ but he refused our money and passed the roll anyway.
---
So yeah I can understand someone a week deep into HoJ grind not wanting other players in the group rolling on it, nor do they really want to see people running it for the first couple times win the roll. 100% from a sanity/moral standpoint.
---
Guy's still kind of a dick.
---
How important is larger shoulder armor to you?
---
My buddies that I played from vanilla to Wrath with just hit WC. We have a warrior, priest, rogue, and I’m a lock...we four maned that place quickly. So much better when you have 4 people on headset on our discord who are mostly not retarded.
---
Gooooooooood gooooooooood. Kill him. Kill him now.
---
There are no +nature spellpower pieces beyond phase 1. That means Elemental Shaman are paying twice the itemization budget of Mages/Warlocks in many slots.
---
There's only a single explicitly Elemental set bonuses (on AQ40 3-piece), with the rest being aimed at Resto and - at best - being vaguely useful (but far from optimal) for Elemental.
---
Basically what you're arguing is that if you manage to grab enough caster gear in the non-mail slots, the huge shortfall you suffer in armor slots compared to Mages/Warlocks won't be a big deal. This is not the case.

Famous fictional person XD Nobody's testicles have an IQ of 91 brother!

If you're not playing for PvP you're not really playing

---
Now that Classic has been live for more than a month, which classes do you think are under-represented?
---
then why is OP claiming it to be an issue on low pop compared to full-pop?
---
Frost res aura doesn't really help vs. polymorph tho, so even if the mages goes oom several times they can just drink up again until the pala is out of cooldowns and mana.
---
Fun fact: dual spec still doesn’t make you be able to do everything.
---
50g to respec adds up quick. If you want to tank and occasionally dps or pvp, you’re talking about respeccing all the time.
---
Your character isn’t more specialized just because you have to pay to swap rolls vs having one possible alternative spec. If you can’t have a character identity beyond your immediate set of talents, you’re just being ignorant.
---
Took me maybe an hour to get the drop. Not time wasted since I got around a quarter of a level.
---
Don’t ask for a tip then, give them a price
---
Seriously, Two entrances, connected on the inside of the dungeon, zig-zag twisting like the right side of WC but worse. I really need to download that dungeon map add-on
---
Interrupt their fear. If that fails, press release spirit and try again.
---
I've given water, food and portals to loads of people. Haven't gotten a tip **one single time** (am lvl 60 on Mograine). Not bothered but quite peculiar.
---
Often times people will just open trade window without even a /w. Or when I'm in a dungeon say something like "water mage". Is it that much effort to use my name and formulate a sentence?
---
If you follow the rule of three, then yes. The rule of three being "no lower than 3 levels below the final boss". The final boss is 51.
---
Real Pro Tip: Calibrate your monitor
---
I play a very old (~1994) game online, and off and on one of the admins talks about finally shutting it down. He thinks I'm strange for saying it's more than just a game, it's a place people like to come back to and visit where they have so many good memories, so we should try to leave it up as long as possible. This is a pretty good example of that.
---
Honestly as someone who took 60 runs to get a HoJ, I don't blame him. It just stopped being fun and I was extremely grateful that I made friends with a bunch of people who didn't mind doing him alongside arena for hours on end.
---
I'm playing a 33 rogue atm, with daggers (because I love the backstab crits). Currently I'm opening with Cheap Shot -&gt; Backstab, then SS until 4-5 for either Kidney or Eviscerate (depending on how dangerous my enemy is).
---
However, I read everywhere that CS is a PvP opener. My ambush damage seems surprisingly low (maybe 20% of a mobs health), while a CS -&gt; BS, often a crit, can get an enemy down to 50%.
---
Dear rogues with daggers, what is a good opener? How do you use your skills while questing?
---
Ye but that's you. Generally people think " water is free give good water wtf man" and they don't fking realise that you craft like 2 bottles of high level water each time and it costs like your whole mana.
---
All good. Just posting for the memes
---
What kind of madman would recommend STV as a place to avoid pvp?

I'd like to mute the footsteps from my human mount and found this list on wowhead classic:  
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/footstep-sounds](https://classic.wowhead.com/footstep-sounds)
---
Would the path + filename Sound/Creature/Horse/FootstepHorseStone work?
---
I'd create more emtpy files in the same directory with FootstepHorseGrass and so on.
---
???
---
Whichever has the shortest line. So that's almost always B.
---
I got several mobs stuck into texture.
---
Agreed. I like the idea of playing a role in a role playing game. I like the specialisation.
---
The agreement before the run, the only information is what he says when the item drops.  If an item drops and I say everyone greed, that can be construed as I just want the item.  If everyone did greed I would probly say "can I need" because I'm not a scammer, or I would just greed.
---
It's a great guild! I have had so much fun with everyone here. Very collaborative and just down-to-earth people.
---
I think they had a few more than just one =D
---
Idk why you would even consider joining any sort of streamer guild. Ofc they are going to get all the loot
---
Will it though? 
---
If there's no achievement rewards we won't have to worry about achievement runs too much... Also, what's wrong with achievement runs? It gets people to go out and do more stuff. 
---
Link achievement won't work in vanilla, it all depends on the gear you have. 
---
1. PvP - you're gear shows what ranks you've been, and in the honor system it says your highest rank. 
---
2. Raids - nobody will take you anyways if your gear sucks.
---
i guess raw gold1 is dropped cash
---
raw gold2 is dropped cash + greyloot vendor-money
---
and then total loot is "raw gold2" + "sold loot"
---
So if you sit next to someone you have never met on a public bench and they move, you're going to intentionally follow them instead?

---
There are definitely moments in the game that remind me of old, gone friendships, and I really appreciate this post.
---
I rolled a rogue as well and am grateful for it - never gotten kicked, no one's said anything about specs (Im non-riposte combat admittedly), and being able to pickpocket while the tank sets up threat is fantastic. I dont have to worry about aoe groups since Ill never be invited to one anyways.  
---
Maybe it's just my server though? Deviant Delight has been alarmingly friendly.

As I slowly level my 35 main, almost all the dungeon groups I get before prime time (5pm), are full of people leveling alts that have a 60. It amazes me.
---
I’ve met a couple healers with this god complex. It’s gonna be a rough awakening when they find out that tanks run the show.
---
Imagine watching someone you hate all day then talking shit about them online all night.  Fucking hell.
---
Easy to say on Reddit until you join a group, have a BoE purple world drop show up. You wouldnt pass roll and you know it.
---
I’m surprised this hasn’t happened to me. I have been going back and forth to EU a lot. Maybe it’s a change in status quo that causes this?
---
Not only are buffs instant cast. We cast buffs as well. Take as many as you can handle friend. Plus i would argue there is a big difference between food and water which is a convenience and buffs which have tangible in combat effects
---
In general. DPS is a Druids worst role. They can Tank just fine, even in 40-man raids. Feral DPS isn't that great, even when going balls to the wall with Power Shifting, Consumes and MCPs.
---
A Druid has to put in 3x the work to even try to be competitive at all.

Ummm this concerns me as I accidentally logged in the other day with my vpn on. Should I be worried?

obviously B is most correct because it's in Line of sight when auto running from outside

---
Ha, no. They will just rationalize it to themselves in some way. You think people like that actually care they are doing something wrong? They do it willfully, not out of ignorance.
---
47 is the minimum, I bet you could swindle your way into a group if you worked at it.  You'll have better luck with a couple more levels though.
---
Last night I was waiting for the dark iron elite in searing gorge to respawn for a quest when 3 alliance come into the same room.  I bail out and hide behind some boxes, but am quickly found, so I hop out and greet them all, /point at the elite mob (which they were also going to kill for their quest), and point to them and then nod, trying to communicate that they can have him and I’ll sit and watch and wait.  2 of the alliance /cheer for me while the high level gnome warrior absolutely wrecks me.  Had my Soulstone on, but they knew what I was planning so they waited me out the full 6 minutes.  Get kicked back to the graveyard and I hightail it to my body and rez right when they’re in the middle of the fight, burn the gnome warrior down, and then help the other alliance kill the elite.  We all proceeded to point and laugh at the dead gnome warrior, until another group of alliance came in and melted my face off before I could even /golfclap.
---
You are on end game now man.
---
Yeah, guess so. Not a big fan thought, just like his stream.
---
Yes I have that too if I open the spellbook first and char screen second. Doesn’t happen if I open char sceeen fies
---
2.0 was when dark pact got spell damage. so, no, won't happen in classic  
---
I use it for leveling, but thats it. takes a lot of GCDs to get mana back up, but I don't have to sit/eat/drink, so I can save some bag slots. thats the main benefit.
---

Just repeat dungeons, I did sm grinding from lvl 29-40 and was able to buy my mount by lvl 36, it only gets easier from there too as the higher lvl dungeons is a massive increase of income, zf for example nets me around 10g per completion with average luck at best
---
So this one time, Pewdiepie dropped a hard R N-Slur.
---
And one of the "defenses" for this was "he said a gamer word" as if it were a core part of gaming culture.
---
Other streamers have said that homophobic slurs, quote, "Got them through some hard times".
---
And people defended this, as if it were a core part of gaming culture.
---
This has become a meme, and includes things like "heated gamer moment".
---
Frankly, when the joke is that gamers are very racist, homophobic, and toxic, you have fucked up somewhere along the line. But people eat this shit up like it's cool and fun.
---
Send help.
---
You are kind of right. The kelp drops from the murloc oracles. There are more murloc oracles on the east island, but that doesnt mean the droprate is better. Its the same type of murlocs on both islands. You just got lucky, while I got unlucky :D
---
Witchcraft, I say! 
---
(Thanks for the tip, playing this game since EU release in 2005 and had no idea. Oops!)
---
Its a greed, but always ask the person that gets it to let you pick the lock for the skill up.
---
"What's good for the guild as a whole" is really just having 40 decently geared people willing to show up to raids. DKP addresses the "decently geared" and "shows up to raids" parts pretty well. Is it optimal loot distribution? No. Is it relatively even loot distribution? Yes.
---
As long as people are getting *some* loot, and there's a pretty clear metric of how they get it, it's gonna dampen out most drama. If you think DKP is going to generate more drama than LC, then you've never seen what one bad LC decision can do lol.
---
&gt; Yes, they are mana inefficient but rarely go OOM if played properly (that is an important distinction)
---
No one goes OOM if they're not casting high impact spells.
---
When the Mage in your raid group is able to nuke full force for the duration of the fight but the Elemental Shaman is tickling the mob with half-power spells to avoid going oom, that's a pretty serious mana efficiency problem.
---
Then let them rot in their own dead server quietly where people stop playing with them until nobody is left :] plus if they never realize it it just makes them less likely to transfer
---
You can also just zoom camera all the way in and walk next to the npc. Bunch of neckbeards with no lives do this shit all the time in Gadgetzan

---
Shadowcleave was SP/Affliction/Shaman and you just BL and dot everything for massive DPS.
---
so it was 2 reasons, the main reason was the damage refund for 35 energy on hemo, making you able to spam hemos, but another significant reason was in naxx you couldnt get any tier pieces as a rogue since rogues and warriors shared tier tokens and as most people know, you needed 8 warriors with 4 pieces of t3 set gear to be able to do 4 horsemen, so basically most rogues just didnt get any tier gear for a long long time.
---
haha yea ive been looking around trying to find em, but couldn't.
---
I gave up on dungeons on my rogue and just solo quested because it was simpler. But now I'm level 48 and don't really know how to use my class in dungeons, and all the weapon upgrades are in them... Should have just pushed through the lower level stuff anyway.

Strong words there man. APES cleared MC/Ony week one and I'll bet you an epic mount the MT wasn't ever remotely close to the def cap.

The whole reason warriors are the best MTs is because shield block pushes crushing blows off the table with very little def.
---
Lol allies are awful people
---
100% disagree.  I wouldnt want to run with folk reserving loot anyway. Its a dick move in my opinion,
---
I ran ubrs for the first time last night. It dropped and I rolled vs 4 mages and 2 priests. I won.

Maybe tell them your costs before assuming people can read minds or will just give coin without prompting. Most people are selfish and will get away with being as stingy as possible.
---
Conversely, stubbornly trying to sell the same green on the AH is another money losing mistake people make. 
---
Once you've failed to sell it once, you're now out the ridiculous listing fee for the item. Even if you successfully auction it after it fails once, you still need to sell it for more than the listing fee plus vendor price in order to actually turn a profit on that second listing, because you only get the fee back for the time it sold, not for all the times it didn't.
---
Based on prices I'm seeing, for more than half the greens I'm picking up, I *might* see 10% profit if I sell it on the AH after the second attempt. I'd rather not deal with it most of the time and just vendor the low-demand affixes than try to find a price that makes it feel worth my while to list it and still guarantees a sale.
---
Me and my friends tried to make it over. Required a lot of /wave-ing to let the horde players know that we were friendly. That as well as hiding in a bush. Stealth 100 right there baby.

It can’t be construed as anything other than “all greed.” “All” means all. Not “all except for me.”  The screenshot is there. No need to defend scammers and their behavior.

ITT: lols I got it in 3 kills!!?? DAE is that lucky????

I am personally a fan of the system Venruki's guild is using. It's a modified roll system where you get X number of points for a boss kill with a max of 30pts. When you /roll you add the points onto your roll and then it resets. You can get a max of 2 items per night.
---
I could go for both!

It's largely about speed actually. If you pull it properly and are well geared (need full necropile set at least, I use necropile + magister with blood etched and penelope rose for stamina) you can clear all the graves in around 10-15 minutes. Running through the place 4-5 an hr I get a minimum of 30g an hour and that's if I'm really unlucky and only get a few greens.

We have a ret paladin in our raids....he has pre raid bis and does barely more damage than the tanks and does no raid support....been trying my best to get his ass benched for the past 3 weeks...if you're ganna play a meme spec at least be the supporter class you're supposed to be.  A lot of these ret paladins just sit and auto attack instead of offhealing when needed.  It's frustrating!

We are a pretty small guild right now, that is trying to recruit some more players! Most of us have real life responsibilities during the day, so you'll find a lot of us on in the evenings and weekends. We have a very small core group of guys that we are trying to expand upon. We got some good dungeon runs in this past weekend and would like to get some more players in the guild so we can get more groups going!
---
Our main goal right now is to help each other level up, run dungeons, work on professions, etc. We want to get into raiding and more organized PvP eventually, but none of us are in a major rush. If you are looking for some laid back people to play with and enjoy helping other players, then come give us a shot.  If you are completely new to WoW, come join us! We have members that are always willing to help!

They must’ve nerfed that jump pretty early on since I thought Classic WoW was supposed to be pulled from a really early version of WoW with some bug fixes.
---
A lot of people don't understand why us players sacrifice so much time for a silly game.
---
They don't realize it isn't a sacrifice and the game is a path for forging unbreakable friendships and familial bonds the likes of which can only be forged through the sweat of the Deadmines, the cobwebs of SFK, and the blood of BRD.
---
I'm glad you had your classic WoW moment. Keep doing what you love, no matter what.

No, Blinking out of it, as in, you can use Blink to cleanse stuns. Bait the Paladin's Hammer of Justice, then Blink to cleanse it and laugh all the way to the bank.

No, they were still Pugging it. If you want to pick &amp; choose loot, run with friends.

What class do you play? I’m a rogue, have done  this and more, but only have 42g. I pick pocket everything too.

The staff is really bad, and the only reason why people would use it is for pvp as it is it a great melee weapon, its just a shit stat stick. And when 25 agi is in the game theres a lot of much better weapons than lokdelar

I'm on Zandalar Tribe EU and Horde
---
Since it's an RP server, naturally it's slightly Alliance leaning. So why is it whenever I enter any contested Zone it's 80% Horde? Where are all the Ally at?
---
Just to add a little more lets add some numbers to explain it.
---
Lets say layers are 5k and we currently have 6k players. When we pass that threshold we are now split into 2 layers with 3k players each.
---
High pop server currently has 21k players. They are also 1k players over for 4 layers and will be split among 5 layers. Their 5 layers have 4.2k players each.
---
The higher population you have the more full each layer will be.
---
Pretty fucking stupid, to be honest.

People in this game are weird.  I was in VC last week and we rolled on a chest. only 3/5 of us rolled.  (One guy passed, other guy didnt respond after a good while) and I won, I went to loot it and one of the rollers asked me why I was looting it when only 3 rolled. I told him i was the high roller and he just responded with "so that makes you think you won?" I really think english wasn't his first language but damn his logic was flawed.
---
Do you have improved ambush for +45% crit? Ambush should always hit harder than backstab because of the multiplier on weapon damage. Cheap shot to backstab would be a waste of energy in PvE
---
Defense isn't great. You can get much higher quality items if you don't focus solely on stacking 440 defense.

As a Druid it’s hard to choose a spec to focus on. If Classic goes the distance and we see Classic+ at some point, I would prob roll another Druid. Druid was always my main, first class I ever played, and I would be down to level through Classic a second time in a different spec. I’ve been playing mostly feral atm to tank while leveling but I will most like respec to healer/hybrid for end game PvP, but parts of me wants to have a dedicated off tank to raid too, so having a second Druid character may not be such a bad thing. I did something similar in retail in MoP when dual spec was still around after they gave Druids a 4th spec (guardian). I had my Tauren main that was Resto/Boomy and leveled a Troll Druid to Feral/Guardian.
---
Just make your own group and reserve it 4Head
---
Anybody have issues with the game looking dark sometimes? Like not even during night time. It looks like the image looks too soft and I have a hard time seeing mobs far away cus they blend with the landscape.
---
That level of nerdery really hasn't aged well. Find a 2004 sub please.
---
for Shamans, yes they do. Shaman Resto tree has % reduction in threat for healing spells.

Why would twitch ban Asmon for something another player did in WoW that has nothing to do with twitch ToS?

Where do you think WoW dwarfs came from?

Seriously, Blizzard asked Warhammer if they could make a game about the franchise.  Was told 'No' and made Warcraft.  One of the worst financial decisions of the 90s.
---
My Rogue currently has a main hand sword and a one handed dagger.
---
I tried writing a macro to equip my dagger in my main hand but i get the error that i cannot equip my main hand sword in my off hand because the game tries to just swap the weapons.
---
Is there a way to unequip my sword with a macro command?

I like knowing im not the only person with an end of session routine. I always go to sleep in an inn every night.

I'd do it for just the rune if you provided it. Saves me a detour to the vendor.
---
Replying to your edit OP:
---
It definitely used to be a thing. You can google and see people talking about having to change names away from famous people or fictional characters etc.
---
I'm looking now and don't see anything in TOS but at work so kinda half assed research.
---
I suspect that Blizz relaxed this rule and ultimately did away with it over the expansions because they got tired of getting huntards to change their name away from Legolas. Maybe there are just some GMs acting on their own (or with a nod from Blizz) to enforce those old rules to make it more vanilla like?
---
Ofc, but all I can do is speak to my own experience. 
---
Personally I havn't been attacked by anyone unless i've: been in combat, way under level of the target or they're 2-3v1'ing.
---
Is embarrassing thst you didnt rearrange those two items in your bags so the bandages were the 20 to that stack of 4...
---
What a dick
---
It's a terrible talent and it competes with Improved Shield Block. Warriors should only tank it if they absolutely need it to stay alive in raids and never before MC. Even then, I'd say it's unnecessary.
---
Not sure about fog but changing the particle density drastically changes the amount of rain.
---
You’re awesome! It’s in Alterac mountains, go up the river from hillsbrad and the quest giver is on the right. If you just hang there I’m sure you’ll see some warriors who need help
---
And that's what I appreciates about you.
---
&gt;In instances most of the time I'm the first to open the trade window and place 120 bottles in there
---
Yeah this is a good habit to have! I do the same.
---
And yeah seriously, not one single time. Lol. Might have to do with the negative stigma mages have now.
---
If you want to see a female, just make a female... If I were rolling alliance hunter, I'd probably role female NE myself, only because I don't like some of the male idle/mounted animations.
---
1 copy of the item. For example (30,5) would buy 5 of them.

It's not me who forgets the jump, it's my pet...
---
1. BoE items are worth more to someone who will put it on. This is evident by the fact that when they put it on they can no longer sell it for its AH value. 
---
2. In your logic, what does greed even exist for?
---
They deserved it. If youre a shaman and go “ooh a priest; me kill” and dont put down a tremor tot, thats well deserved death
---
Then you aren’t reading any of the posts about 2h tanking, lol. Just because some people don’t do it right doesn’t mean it’s wrong
---
Yeah it's not a bug, they did always respawn like that, with the exception of raids, which saved at each boss completed.
---
The respawn is still fairly long.  Must have been quite a long run though?  I only experienced this a couple of times in Vanilla to be fair.  Once on a SM run like you, and once in Scholo.  Both times horrible groups and lots of wipes.
---
The others just might not have seen it yet... You might have been premature there.
---
I just logged in from Taiwan, but I live in Canada. FUCK
---
!remind me 8hrs
---
You can and Blizzard will enforce player-determined loot rules such as "All Greed" prior to rolling. 3 day temp ban, item is removed or sent to reporter if they need rolled/gold is deleted if sold on AH.
---
You can go for a hybrid resto/feral build. It's even somewhat viable in endgame raids - you can just switch gear and go from healing a boss to tanking a boss.
---
I hate that so much.
---
Yeah, but then you get to ninja loot a Painweaver Band from the only rogue in UBRS when you can't do more damage than a conflagged tank as a Shockadin!
---
/notbitter
---
rp-ing in goldshire
---
That's through the mind of a DPS who's only half-arsing it though. For example, if you apply the mentality from other roles to the role you are doing your entire group's life is noticeably easier and you'll get recognised and invited even more so. As a DPS you can be watching what the rest of your group is doing (including their health for off heals/bandages) like a Healer would and this keeps everyone safer, it keeps an eye on who's likely to pull extra. Same from the Tank PoV, you watch who's either going to pull or get aggro, you do what you can to CC it in the Tank's range and they are far more likely to pick it up and save a wipe, or just CC it until the Tank can get it later to save it smacking the healer about. 
---
If you're a Tank you should be doing the same from dps/healer PoV, e.g. Making sure mobs are stacked up or in an optimal place for dps to do what they need to without pulling more, being able to get behind mobs/not get cleaved etc.
---
*That* would be *stealing.*

I didn't know there were turtles down there.  (Knew about the ones in Northern Tanaris, not the ones down south).  I'll check them out.
---
If youre trying to be a nice rogue - imo lockpick should be treated like any other profession: Greed for skill ups, Need for recipe (which I dont think exists in any form so it would just be greed always).
---
Need should be reserved for gear upgrades. Id even go so far as to say a "non-trivial" upgrade. Ill greed on something with a few more armor or +1 of that stat for example if I know it would be significantly more of a boost to others who need it.   
---
Class Fantasy though I ahve seen rogues not unlock dungeon chests because people wanted to roll for it. Like "Ok you won go open it"  "I cant open it" "well shit guess you can't win it can ya" sort of deal.
---
Townsfolk Tracker works really well for flightpaths, mail and all the rest of it - profession trainers, banker, auction, etc.
---
i main tanked from mc to nax doing server 1st-3rd progression as 5/31/15
---
being able to have your raid worry that much less about threat was more important to us than the crap you got on prot in vanilla.
---
I was doing a quest in I believe swamp of sorrows? Could be wrong. Anyways, had to kill whelpings, and 2nd kill got a “tiny emerald whelping” sold for 35g. Never been so lucky! Helped out greatly for my mount gold
---
When I'm playing priest and my group doesn't have a mage, this is how I usually ask mages for water:  "Great Wizard, may I purchase some water?"
---
And then I tip some silver.
---
It's worked pretty great.  =)
---
Fort buffs in a dungeon are five casts, not one. Making food/water is part of your class, everyone does things for each other (tanks have higher repair costs, priests heal/buff/save your ass, warlocks summon/healthstone/soulstone, etc). Withholding part of your kit unless someone gives you appropriate gratitude makes you not worth having in dungeons tbh. You're making extra fuss and rolling on the same gear as the healer a lot of the time, I'd rather have a less fussy mage or not share my gear with another clothie, but you do you.
---
Geesh, the retail kids really act bad. That kinds shite rarely happened in the real Vanilla. Just rest assured that when they finally get to places like searing gorge that they will have alienated the entire player base , and no one will help them.
---
Yeah, when that thing works it’s great. What level do they get that? This was low 30s
---
Sinister strike on f.  Eviscerate shift f. Stealth on a side mouse button down. Distract on side mouse button up. Ranged attack on a side mouse button+shift up.  While stealthed change your opener to the f slot if you prefer cheap shot/garrote.
---
You are now a three button rogue with no strain
---
I'll trust your experience on this subject. ;)
---
Played hunter in Vanilla and BC, I was going to roll hunter again but didn’t want everyone to hate me off the bat.  Now I feel like the bad luck Brian of wow.

Not wanting to go and roll against *other people* is fine, that's your decision. The non-60 thing is just bullshit, those people will hit 60 soon and need HoJ just as much. Not buying it. A guy in my guild has been leveling 53-60 exclusively through Angerforge runs to get it for that very reason.
---
RemindME! 8 hours "check this out!"

Today I learned that any guild that hasn't cleared MC yet is irrelevent and nobody else will ever clear MC again.

So when you say scan, the charcter needs to physically visit the AH? Can I do it with my alt instead?

TBH i have never even asked for a health stone or soul shards because of that reason, that it requires a soul shard. But if u had, i would offer a food and water for hs and not just want it for free.

---
I genuinely don't get why so many people in this sub treat the glow as some new thing. It was added in the Dire Maul patch. It's extremely Vanilla.
---
Only explanations I can think of are:
---
1. Back in 2005 they had a shit computer that couldn't do the glow
---
2. They didn't like it when it was added way back when and turned it off immediately then forgot about it.
---
3. One of the most widely distributed zips of the 1.12 client for private servers must have had it turned off in its default settings, so private server players are used to it being off.
---
4. When private server players run the 1.12 client, because it can't detect their video card because the card is too modern, it defaults to disabling it, so, again, most private server players are used to it being off.
---
I have made zero attempt to test my theories for #3 and #4, for the record.
---
I disagree but you do you
---
I definitely still give them the buff, that was kinda my point. Sometimes you don't get politeness and gratitude for whatever reason (people are busy/bad day/not thinking) and it's dumb to deny your group a vital part of your class kit based on whether they were appropriately thankful or not.

If you do shit and just get the best you can, you should remain geared enough to complete the content. Find likeminded people, and you never need "keyboard destroying" rage from not getting these perfect gear drops.

I plan to make getting T0 an endgame, where I just casually do dungeons and slowly work toward getting a set. I plan on completing the T0.5 sets for all characters.

If I can get my priest to full T0.5 with Benediction, I will be plenty happy.
---
Screw that quest lol
---
?  I don't see the issue here...seems like he's asking a question as polite as he can.. then you say "would love to"(granted you also said you needed a break, but that's probably why he wanted to summon so you could help like you'd "love to").. Next time just say nty or something
---
Look everyone, this is why you never use memes as an argument, it makes you look like a moron.
---
Tactical Mastery is always worth it. You will be swapping stances at some point for something, no matter what your playstyle happens to be.
---
Anger Management is always worth it, because it generates more rage for you in combat. There is no argument to be made that that is a bad use of a talent point.
---
What is the best possible gear for a rogue if I never get raiding? I don't know if I'll have the time for it.
---
As I'm not completely certain if I'll end up using only daggers or only swords, or both, I appreciate info on both :)
---
I think we will get a server for BC and WotLK at some point, maybe even Cataclysm.
---
You’re listing things that aren’t group content and saying having spec flexibility will affect people grouping up for them, that doesn’t make sense
---
no he did fucjing send the money my brother was the one who was in the group and he said royson sent him 200g to say sorry so think twice u stupid fucking gnome
---
I really like the game as it is, so maybe something subtle.  
---
Perhaps a key ring - I feel like irl, the same amount or keys would take up less space than they do in wow. I know this logic would get you into tricky places fast, but how is one key the same space as 20 iron bars? :D. 
---
In reality, I don’t care about key space too much. I think I just can’t think of anything I’d want to change too much!
---
He clearly skipped the rogue quest that has you pick chests in rapid succession. You can get to 80-90 LP in just a few minutes of clicking. Its a little rough between 90ish and being able to unlock the level 30+ junkbox type but after that you’ll pretty much stay at max skill for your level forever.
---
Just dont group with those people.

That's fundamentally different from retail pvp because it has a real ratings system. To be the top 0. 1% in retail, generally you have to be among the best.

Im horde, in Badlands at 39, killing the 40-41 wolves and cats. Pull one too many and have a sliver of health left, I get targeted so I pan my camera to see an alliance mage halfway through a cast of Polymorph.

https://old.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/czterb/i_was_wrongfully_banned_from_world_of_warcraft/ez1kdlr/
---
Digging the username buddy.
---
Also: pitter patter!
---
There is just too much to write without creating a wall of text. But I'll try giving a rough overview.
---
1. You'll almost never see your equipment. If you want cool looking swords/helmets/armor you're out of luck. You might not think this is a big deal but when you're running dungeons the biggest joy is getting something new and shiny, Druids do not take part in this joy. So if you enjoy getting new gear that looks awesome, don't pick Druid. 
---
2. You have two talent trees. The balance tree is totally useless until you hit level 50+. You are shoehorned into Feral until like level 60, unless you want to heal. But if you grab healing talents your questing experience will not be fun.
---
3. If you want to play at high potential you will be pressing a lot of buttons, a lot. You will be switching from human to bear to human to bear to human to cat to human to bear to human to cat. All while casting spells between those switches. Meanwhile your teammates will be pressing 75% less buttons while being 110% as effective as you. This also means you will have to pay attention to your mana bar and your rage/energy bar, so now you get to keep track of extra information while other classes don't have to.
---
4. Tanking is a thankless job, this is especially so for a Druid. It will wittle you down to a point where you'll want to quest instead of running dungeons because the gear that drops just isn't as exciting as for other classes. And even if something good drops you'll be competing with at least 2 group members for it every time. 
---
I'm just speaking from my own personal experience. I guarantee that anyone will have at least twice as much fun picking any other class than Druid.
---
I'm not saying Druid is a bad class, hell I'm a main Druid. Just saying you'll have more fun playing anything else.
---
No, you shouldn’t follow rules that are suggested that are obviously intended to scam you. 
---
There is a general rule that everyone needs on epics.  If one drops and someone tells you otherwise, you should say “no, we should use a different rule”
---
Vanilla **was** more difficult in the past, lack of experience (compared to 15 years of running the same shit over and over again), limitations of hardware, lack of add-ons, naivety, and bugs (so many bugs) all were major factors in making it difficult, but as each patch was released, things were re-balanced, gear was changed, added and itemized better, bugs were fixed, people got better. 
---
Classic is incredibly easy by comparison since the add-ons are there and have had 15 years of development, hardware has gotten better so things are smoother with less lag, and most bugs are fixed (they still exist but the bigger game breaking ones don't exist anymore). People often don't realize that there is a major difference between 1.1 and 1.12. All the small changes over time adds up. If people really want an idea of what's changed, I suggest go through the major patch notes to get a better idea of the changes that occurred.

---
Imagine actually thinking the other guy was the dick on this exchange?
---
If you're forced to stay in a tank or heal or very squishy dps spec you wouldnt grab a friend to do it with you? Why not?
---
Take about 10% off there bud.
---
This needs way more visibility. Is Blizz even aware of it yet? Has someone posted it on the Blizz forums?
---
I have no idea if this is actually the case, but looking at your details windows:
---
Your max normal hit of Fireball is 464, with your average being 189. No min (probably due to multiple different fights, same with casts).
---
This leads me to believe that details is combining the Fireball dot and Impact damage into one column, drastically reducing both the average damage of your Fireball, and crit chance due to the dot not being able to crit.
---
Edit:
---
I've tested it on a few mobs because I'm using details as well, [this](https://i.imgur.com/RS8OnIW.png) is for one fight (2 casts, 1 crit, 1 normal, 4 DoT ticks) and [this](https://i.imgur.com/2OgQml0.png) is 3 fights, including the fight in the first picture (7 casts, 2 crit, 5 normal, 12 DoT ticks).
---
If you look at the 2nd picture, I should have a 28.5% cit chance on my Fireball (2/7), but since it includes the 12 DoT ticks, it comes down to 10.5% (2/19).
---
Since your overall amount of Fireball / Pyroblast casts is missing (for whatever reasons, probably just details being details), I can't check for sure if that's whats happening here. I played around with Fire spec at 60 a few days ago, and I definitely did see an increase of impact crits compared to my old frost spec (no shatter), with barely any change in gear (I probably lost %crit on gear due to lower int for higher firedamage on ring &amp; boots).
---
As I said, not sure if it's actually bugged for you or not, but I hope this helps your perspective. I'm 80% confident it's just details.
---
However, I've noticed that some of the set boni are sometimes not working until you relog, so chances are talent's could be bugged as well (like so many things are bugged right now in classic, it's actually disgusting)
---
I'll head there and raise a pint to his name

You can level a rogue and level lock picking if you'd want, I main a rogue and it's a p.i.t.a. to level lp. I still greed them though but I can see where they are coming from in their reasoning.

It could be seen as morally cheating. Just because they don't ban you for it doesn't change this. 
---
Anyway, this is irrelevant. The game was not designed with those addons in mind, just because they've decided they are ok with third party addons that you *choose* to install, doesn't magically make the game itself easier. You are making it easier yourself. You don't have to. Football does not become easy because I personally choose to compete with a bunch of 10 year olds. 
---
Of course then you pull out the "strawman" attempt at discrediting me, a sure sign you don't have an actual argument so I will be done here. Stop using that stupid fucking buzzword.
---
I didnt realize Atlas was an add on for classic until after my WC leveling days were over. Lets just say I did not lead the way in WC while dungeoning there.
---
Thinking that someone could get upset about reddit comments, says a lot about you.

I wouldn't really recommend spending 10g that you don't need to at level 35. Reconsider it once you have the 90g for your mount, but not before then.
---
Honestly didn’t know he did that. Last I killed him for the black bear mount years ago, we rolled in with like 50 guys and fought in his tent.
---
This was beautiful. Thank you. I'm so sorry for your loss.
---
Great job. Loving it. Thank you
---
Eh, some of the worst examples are the age you were in 2004.
---
OP also conveniently left out whatever he said to the guy so even money he was antagonizing the dude and using 'buddy' condescendingly.
---
Just out for a rip are ya bud?
---
I'm that guy... I hate that dungeon with every fiber of my being
---
I think you just got unlucky man
---
Yeah this is some kind of publicity stunt.  I've certainly never heard of him before this.  People who don't talk or care about the big streamer are.  Don't feed the troll, don't give attention to the streamer.

Spend a few hundred bucks or several thousand if it goes to court to get your 15 bucks of sub back.
---
Now this is a 200 IQ move.
---
sadly nothing too funny has happened since classic launch to me but back when i played back in vanilla i played a mage and a friend of my was my little pocket tank that i run dungeons with and a group of us all run together to do out 0.5 upgrade quests and the such.
---
one day me and my other half, moonkin druid, where sat at our computers chatting to out tank friend on skype, yep that's what we used for voice chat when we weren't raiding, and ask if he wants to do a dungeon. his response was that he can do he just needed to farm another 10-20 coal to level his blacksmith skill first, a little confused i asked him why he was farming it and not just buying it from the vendor? Skype goes quiet. finally he responds with "what do you mean buying it?" me and the other half start to laugh and he asks whats so funny? we tell him to go to a blacksmith vendor and look. about 5min later he starts laughing and tells us he had been farming coal all day thinking it only dropped from mining and that he's been running round searing gorge mining it without realising he could just buy it from a vendor.
---
since then on his birthday we would send him coal to remind him of that day.
---
I LFG as a healing pally and I can't tell you how often I'm invited to a group that tells me I'm now the tank. I don't have a shield and I wear partially cloth healing gear (since it's often much better than the poorly itemized mail gear). I tell them so and I get kicked. I'm a great healer and a very poor tank with my current gear and I have no money for a second set. If this was an alt my main could fund it, but this isn't 2005 anymore when I had multiple 60s.
---
There's gonna be a drunk Bear in Gallows End tonight.
---
Pro tip!
---
I have leveled from 1-50 as arms and just used a 1h and shield to tank when I want to do dungeons and I’ve had 0 problems.
---
It also causes prostate and testicular cancer in humans.... And guess which company makes the most widely used chemo treatment for prostate cancer.... The same one that makes  Atrazine.

Damn you are struggling here. I’m suggesting a mod is going to delete it because you’re in such a rage you can’t stop breaking sub rules.
---
How exactly am I going to get banned? Lmao, what a troll.
---
I remember that (contrary to the comment) Araxom confirmed and upheld or overturned a few actions in the past. Especially when CS was - despite evidence- unwilling to take another look at a case.
---
But I am not Araxom and don't know his job description, so I will take his word for it.
---
As I said, the only things you can do is:
---
1. Try to escalate the issue to a higher support level and start a live chat, and then say that you have the passport stamps, plane tickets and evidence to prove this was you.
---
2. Post the evidence to /r/wow and be polite, then hope it gains enough traction for Blizzard to take a look.
---
3. Wait out the ban.
---
Trust me, I know what a hassle big companies and their algorithms are. Someone recently bought an accounting software over my PayPal account for £70. PayPal declined my appeal for unauthorized access based on location tracking (it was from the UK). Problem is that I was in Germany on a Live Roleplay event from Monday to Sunday. The software was bought on Wednesday.
---
I sent them plane tickets, event tickets, and train tickets. All containing my name, address, location and date. Yet PayPal still wouldn't budge. The support worker was so adamant that their algorithm was perfect that it's apparently more likely I spent a total of £320 on travel prices to fake a £70 purchase of accounting software I don't need. I charged back with my CC company, obviously, but PayPal is obviously saying that my account might be closed.
---
It's annoying, really. It's also why chargebacks are the last nuke option, and you shouldn't do it if you want to keep your account.
---
Game could've done with a gear rebalance to make last boss in dungeons have better loot distribution for different classes but #nochanges.

I ditched the aoe build around your level as well. Went with a single target PvP shatter build. Great for wpvp, I kill mobs extremely fast. When I need to aoe, I generally group them all up, nova &gt; flamestrike &gt; CoC (both hit at the exact same time and generally crit like crazy), and then kite with AE. It does significantly more damage than blizzard, and it’s way more dangerous. Works a charm ;)
---
Looking at your talents, I’d ditch the arctic reach in favor of ice block and arctic reach. Then you can decide if you want imp CoC(which is what I like), or frost channeling.
---
Try putting them on blast on their Twitter too.

Elvui + Weak Auras. Also using OmniCC to check CDs. You can get this profile from waigo. Check warrior classic WA

I played druid and paladin both to max level in classic, I know the drill :P
---
You seem too emotionally invested in what other people type on the internet. 
---
Maybe just take a step back, my man.
---
You can level as any spec and still be a viable tank all the way to 60. I leveled arms and kept an up to date 1h and shield. No issues. If I had a decent group I could even stay 2h and tank without issues.
---
well, you dont need to. I see you comment on a lot of asmongold topics, you probably watch him a lot, you should have all the experience you need ;)
---
Instead of shaming why don't you tank it yourself?
---
If you were just sitting and white hitting a mob, then yes, 2.9 speed 39 DPS would be better than 3.7 speed 37 DPS.  But the important thing is that your special skills (overpower, mortal strike, heroic strike) are based on Weapon Damage.  So your instant attacks do significantly less with a faster weapon.  There's definitely a tipping-point where at some point the faster, higher DPS weapon is better.  But for your example, the 2H Axe is still going to be better for you.
---
Love the old time bosses who actually have oomph. Watched an alliance raid try to get the dark Lady recently. Half wiped in the hallway down to the royal chamber. The other half got it with the sylvanas volley as they entered the chamber. Because the dummies aggro'd the AV battle master. Who shouted and woke her out of her usual stupor. City bosses are awesome again.

Yep, many priests do this.
---
Go Arms and you can tank all the way to 60 easy.
---
Not yet!
---
Bind it to your jump button and just press it as you run around.
---
Not at all, its really easy if you have the time to level.
---
Yeah noticing that isn't the problem. It's polite to ask first.
---
You know how easy it is now to put together a group with Feral Druids, Ret Paladins, Hunters, Rogues. It is amazing. Want to thank all them leet meta players shunning huge swaths of the player base who just need to see someone welcome them.
---
Thanks, the money is a concern, but I'm thinking that missing 10g doesn't take long to earn back by selling portals in Org while fishing for cooking food.
---
The only streamer people post about is asmon because of the volatility or for karma. Majority of the top streamers, and in general, are horde.

Not that much more gold, considering if your item doesn't sell, you've got to eat up deposit costs which are insanely high. So unless you're selling without the ah or somehow manage to always sell what you list, there will also be some loss. If you play during off-peak or are unlucky/unexperienced enough to sell very few items, you can actually lose gold. So I'd say it depends. Also the time you spend thinking about what price to put, collecting mail and re-listing could be spent leveling and getting more items, so it's not that bad. The exception is if you vendor any and all items including some that can be very expensive, so I'd say always try and check the price of an item on the ah, but it's also sometimes a matter of knowledge, because sometimes, some items show up as expensive not because they actually sell for a lot but actually because they're overpriced or because there's no demand at all.

https://www.wowhead.com/news=295205/wow-classic-feign-death-bug-report-investigation
---
&gt;Hey everybody, I wanted to take a minute to talk about Feign Death. Hunters are understandably very concerned about the behavior of such an iconic ability, with a variety of important uses, and I want to assure you that we’re aware of your reports and we’re investigating. This one isn’t easy at all. In our reference builds, many of the same behaviors that players are reporting do occur, but sometimes with slight differences in timing or consistency, which makes it really difficult to even identify a clear bug in the first place. However, despite this difficulty we have made some progress here.
---
&gt;The first issue is that Feign Death cancels when you move, including if you turn, and very often high-skill hunters are running from an opponent, turning to shoot behind them, and then Feign Death to drop a trap. It some of these cases, Feign Death is failing because the spell-cancel on turning is more sensitive in WoW Classic than it was in 1.12. We’ve tracked down why it’s more sensitive, and we’re testing a change now that relaxes the spell cancellation to make it less likely that you’ll inadvertently trigger this if you’re trying to stop turning to cast Feign Death. That said, if you continue turning after the cast, or keep turning during the cast, you can still cause Feign Death to be cancelled. This fix will go out soon as a hotfix.
---
&gt;There are other reports about it taking too long to drop combat, or having combat re-activated because your pet is getting attacked, and we’re still looking at those issues. We’re tracking a couple of leads there, but we haven’t got this bug in our sights yet, so it may take a bit more time to figure out what’s really going on here.
---
&gt;I’m sorry it’s not a silver bullet, but hopefully it gives you some peace of mind to know we’re listening, and still investigating the issues.
---
Google is your friend
---
I've seen so many mages with the Elemental Mage Staff, but have never seen it on the ah. I guess its bought fast. Anyway, what should I expect to pay for it?
---
u/johslol
---
Interesting, can you share the build you used at the time?
---
Pretty sure puss SJWs like you are ruining many more communities than this guy is.  
---
Seething.  Can't stand a meme name.  Calls people cancer.  Deserves it instead.
---
Then you're paying them for your service. It's like being in a supermarket and the cashier will pay for the costumers milk, it makes 0 sense.
---
We have a solid group... but we totally weren't expecting and just got in over our heads. Duly noted, we'll move faster from now on!
---
ah! that makes sense! \^\^

my horde knowledge is weak &gt;.&lt;

Count me in for the drinking club. Having a brew in Gallows End tonight as soon as I log on in honor. Lok'tar Ogar my friend.
---
I've rolled Alliance for classic, but I made a mage on Horde first when classic launched.  He is level 15 and currently in the Brill Inn. I will log onto that mage one last time, put him in Gallows Tavern, get him as drunk as the money that character has and log him out.  He will remain in the Tavern until the Wow classic servers go offline.  Cheers to your brother, may he rest in peace, and cheers to you, brother!
---
Lol, this is me. And that fucking jump. Fuck off!
---
Not saying anything about the race, but it is very disingenuous to ~~have~~ sell this guide for fast leveling, advertising your low /played time, but actually leveling with well above average amounts of rested exp.
---
I have two...
---
First one happened last night, was running ZF and everything was going pretty smoothly until we got to the ‘stair encounter’... We cleared everything around the base of the pyramid, ran up and killed the executioner. As soon as we released the prisoners the encounter glitches and every trash mob runs up the stairs. We didn’t even have time to prepare as most of us were eating/drinking and re-setting buffs. One minute we are fine and next minute 20-30 trolls bum rush us at the top. I had time to get 1-2 heals off before they decided I was fair game. Our tank couldn’t build enough rage to gain aggro, and all our lock could do was get a fear off. Sheer pandemonium for a brief 1-2 minutes and then we got to sit and watch the event npcs die to the angry mob. 
---
Second happened in WC. We were clearing things at a good rate when we got to the last pull before the thunder lizard boss (can’t remember name), and one of the npc druids decided to just up and take off. He ran straight for the boss. We figured that the boss would aggro and we would be looking at a nice long walk back to the dungeon. Low and behold, that doesn’t happen, so we proceed to down the boss with the stray mob running headfirst into the cavern wall. After the boss is downed, the NPC then nopes it around the corner when we go to kill him and proceeds to run to a waterfall. For the next 20 minutes, this lone npc keeps running away as we try to kill him. He doesnt aggro anything, but because he is living we are constantly stuck in combat. We couldn’t stop laughing on discord.
---
&gt; there isn't a tank spec for shamans.
---
You mean Rockbiter weapon and using Earth Shock as a soft-taunt isn't a tanking spec?
---
It has never been that way in the past. I travelled like OP and logged into my WoW adc just fine.
---
Funny, I got downvoted a bunch for trying to advise mages about this a month ago.

Well,

He did have the high ground.
---
Again these situations of “family guild” are only apparent in smaller size guilds... with maybe less than 40-50 members. This would not work when you have guilds with 100+ people.
---
I didn't know the correct spelling of this sub was /r/asmongold, huh, that's weird. Could've sworn it was /r/classicwow
---
Damn now I'm even more lost than before...
---
he was needed  healer
---
Depends on what you value more (Health vs. damage) but people generally recommend the shadoweave set.
---
The shoulders specifically are one of the best pieces since it gives stam + spell power
---
My guild mates and I shall toast as well, on bloodsail buccaneers.
---
I'm right there with you. We both have to kill 24 mobs. Why not help each other so we're both just taking out 12?
---
Make sure that your VW's taunts are turned on.  At level 16 you shouldn't be having that problem unless you are totally stacked up on +shadow damage gear.  My normal rotation at that level was CoA &gt; immolate &gt; corruption &gt; wand.  CoA deals most of its damage in the last 3rd of its ticks, so it produces less threat initially.  Also make sure you keep Demon Armor/Skin up.  You really shouldn't die often as a lock, so I'm guessing there's something weird going on (like accidentally having turned off your VW's taunt).
---
Hey I could tell when you called out the devilsaur set.
---
Uhhh ... You realize that the occurence rate of prostate cancer in men is almost 100% even with no other influences right? Just 99% of prostate cancer will never metastasis and therefore never be an issue. Not only that but the fastest and most recommended treatment of said prostate cancer is simply to remove it surgically or to simply leave it since it doesn't typically manifest in men till 50+ and will likely not pose any real problems to them other than some difficulty urinating. Hell most men that have it may not even know that they have it since it's ability to influence the body is so small without metastasizing unless the tumor grows at an insane rate. Not to mention it has a "correlation" with testicular cancer, not a direct "causation". Theirs also a reason that any kind of pest/herbicide always has a health risk label on them.
---
Druid ;)
---
Let me put it this way. I've only ever had one friend who was a borderline sociopath and a full on narcissist. And that guy is the only person I know who called people "buddy" his age. So if that is the kind of person you want people to imagine while you talk to them in game chat go ahead.
---
There aren't that many money sinks in Classic.  Epic mount, respecs, repair bills, and professions are the main ones.  Personally, I find 1k+ with epic mount is pretty rich in Classic.
---
Which addon tracks group damage?
---
That's not true just relog to fix it
---
That's not what I'm saying or even implying. They're in the wrong for misleading people, they're assholes for trying to defend it. That in no way invalidates the statement that rolling need on high level rare/Epic BoE's is normal and literally the only protection you have from getting screwed over.
---
I'm saying to use this as an object lesson - not everyone is well meaning.
---
Everyone should roll need on expensive BoE items
---
I would consider myself rich when I can do whatever I want in this game by paying for gold.
---
Thinking a lvl 19? No problem
---
Raid consumables for the entire raid? Easy
---
Will I attain that? No probably not.
---
That is literally what I am saying
---
I’m not saying bg’s ruin the game, but I’ve never told a great story involving them.
---
Gnomes can’t roll priest in Classic. Are you sure you’re in the right sub?
---
Whats priestly about it...
---
It depends on the guild’s structure and how they operate. An LC has a higher potential to screw people hard, but DKP is a system with values, that people can call others out on. Both flawed systems, but an LC has potential to be way more devious
---
I don't disagree at all. I do understand why Blizzard chose not to, but I wish they had.
---
So they actually tried to fight him in there, but I'm guessing the dude went tryhard mode and chased the ones who tried to flee.
---
Well maybe if you did not leave like a butthurt child right after the roll, and instead did what the guy asked and rolled, you could have won it.
---
I don't get all the gnomer hate.
---
It isn't that bad imo.
---
Using the phone app. I looked it up but thanks.
---
Pretty much anything with spell damage is better than int/stam/spirit. Your tankiness/sustain isn't from raw health, but the damage you do, so doing more damage kills stuff faster *and* keeps you healthier with more mana. It's better for both leveling and dungeons, imo.
---
Nice work.
---
Your comment is the reason why I advise anyone to play Druid.
---
Everyone enjoys having a Druid tank in their group, just not actually PLAYING the Druid tank.
---
The best in slot items comment is okay but kind of moot. You won't be worried about best in slot items until level 50ish, so for the 6+ days of in-game time you will be competing against a minimum of 2 other players every time. Sometimes against 3 others. As a Druid running dungeons since Classic started, you will ALWAYS be fighting for gear. 
---
The Rogue might not ALWAYS be fighting for gear, but the Druid will be.
---
You say Druid tanks will be the off tank. So that means you will be getting geared AFTER the main tanks, nice. Extra thankless. So in addition to not getting the spotlight, you won't be getting the loot either. /clap 
---
I'm not arguing with you, just giving my point of view. I do appreciate your comment, TY!
---
If you're thinking about playing a Druid, do what the guy above me did and pick Rogue instead. You will enjoy playing alongside a Druid and you'll have MUCH more fun as a Rogue (or any other class).
---
The point is, when you have the "Kill (last boss name) achievement" in the game, people ask for you to link your achievement before they will let you in their group.
---
"Achievement run" isn't saying a run where you go and do the achievements in this context. Its saying a run where everybody already completed the dungeon. 
---
Similar to groups in retail asking for ilvl higher than what the dungeon drops, it creates this weird situation where you need to have already cleared the place before you are allowed into groups, so if you haven't cleared it, how do you find a group to do so? 
---
Its an attitude that has become more and more pervasive in retal, it sucks, and they should do everything possible to stop it.
---
As a fellow mage, I can also attest to the fact that we cannot use maces
---
He's playing Classic not retail... That's why lol 😁.
---
This is wrong
---
the situation could have been avoid that way but at the same time if you are friends with the guy it is an uber douchbag move to toss your friendship away for some gold. i know i would never want to play with that guy. i hope the group he raid leads with refuses to play with him inside the guild.
---
What? They paid 72s for the hat. How is 72c worse?
---
I've never tried it, but I can see it potentially being useful for Geddon's bomb, Onyxia's phase 2 fireballs, or Onyxia's deep breath. It'd definitely just be a mitigation thing though - those bosses are immune to fire.
---
I'll answer that: Yes. Very. Gearing up through pvp takes ages no matter how dedicated you are. There is a cap on weekly rank progression, and you can't break it. Hitting the cap after rank 8/9 is akin to forfeiting all life outside the game. You CAN do it, but expect a 12+ week nolifing journey at least, if you start a few weeks before p3 getting the first two ranks or so through wpvp.
---
Also, your gear will be inferior for raiding in a good few slots compared to p2 bis, but it won't be bad.
---
Not sure exactly what he did, but going by the comments he needed on a blue BoE in a dungeon. If so, the standard is, or should be, to need on all BoEs in pugs unless determined otherwise in order to prevent ninjaing. If everybody needs, it's impossible to ninja. Obviously if someone actually needs it, it'd be nice to have everyone else greed, but odds are they're just gonna AH it.
---
edit: yea hes an asshole
---
r/oddlysatisfying
---
I did something similar... This dwarf hunter was killing and elite and his pet died... So i jumped in, stunlocked the damn elite and /waved him.
---
He proceeded to revive his pet, heal up, mark and attack me....
---
I proceeded to camp his corpse untill he ressed at the GY.
---
Hopefully the dude and his wife’s name and his wife’s business name get leaked. It’d be hilarious watching this guy get doxxed.
---
Yes we do.
---
No, you don’t roll on epics based on gear upgrades.  Everyone needs. 
---
If it’s an important upgrade for someone, they can buy it on the AH.
---
either a kid with a nagging mom or a dad with a nagging wife and kids
---
People who complain about streamers are seriously worse than the actual streamers. These threads are hilarious
---
i did get my boots of avoidance from zf with a nice group who didn't all need on it. it's truly a blessing when people don't get consumed by the everlasting greed for gold. even though, it's totally understandable. i'd suggest getting into a guild/running dungeons with oeople you know to avoid the "all need" rolls on epics you or them would want to use.

Hunter's fall off once AQ40 is on farm, progressing into Naxx. Or in otherwords, once people *have* AQ40 gear or better, hunters start to fall off damage meters. Before then, they are very strong.
---
Remember AQ40 releases in stage 5 and Naxx stage 6, so hunters will really only 'fall off' for late phase 5 / phase 6. So the majority of your vanilla time, hunters will be strong.
---
They are fine in PvP but may feel struggle vs Naxx geared opponents, however remember in Vanilla not everyone is running around in T3. You'll still be plenty fine.
---
It's an old term referring to [blowing a raspberry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowing_a_raspberry). It's when you place your tongue between your lips and blow :p
---
We should have a separate subreddit for streamer drama, because I could care less. Don't play on a server with a big streamer unless you are on the opposite side and want to gank them all day.
---
I opened a Blood of Heroes near a questgiver, died (which I knew would happen), then watched a ton of level 55-ish toons get completely wrecked.  This whole alliance party rolls up and tries to take them on. They got destroyed.
---
Later on, I’m in a party with someone and they asked “what is this blood of heroes thing?”  I told him to pick it up for a quest. He gets insta-destroyed.
---
Look for a good guild, it'll make all the difference.

If you're alliance on pagle look for grievance. Good group of people.

I found the exact same piece of shit floating in my toilet this morning.
---
Dude, it is totally something. Not everyone has the tenacity or Mage AOE uber grinding-ness to just shiyte out their 100g like its nothing. 
---
Even as a OG ol' man vanilla WoW player getting your first 60% ground mount is a HUGE milestone. Hell even in classic I've gotten the almost same level euphoric excitement as I ran back to SW via FP then ran through Elwynn forest getting to my mount Trainer/Mount vendor and happily buying all that awesome stuff.
---
You have earned the right to be excited about one of if not the first big accomplishment on your toon. IMO nothing compares to the first time you get that first mount.
---
2.5 hours, that's really good hehe. My last group was in there 3.5 hours and the bar got bugged. We died a few times trying to get by it, but couldn't. An elemental with 4 elite guards by the door that chain agro the whole bar when we pull them. ... good times. :)
---
We ended up lava hopping to get someone's MC attunement done, but died a  few times there because no one remembered exactly how to do it. Personally I forgot you had to keep jumping so I wasn't making it very far lol.
---
Whatever you enjoy, there's no point rolling something you'll hate. I'm making rogue and it's good fun having some decent survivability while levelling
---
It's called CharacterStatsClassic
---
madseason?
---
Yes one can do that as a dps’er but as long as it’s not necessary most ppl will not. Myself included. I relax as dps. But you can’t relax as a tank obviously. Different roles comes with different responsibilities that’s just the way it is. And that is true for all except the most hardcore progression content ofc. I think the main point is: one can play half arsed as a dps and be successful, not so as a tank.
---
1000 is something you can make in a week of spamming dungeons, not really a huge sum. 10k is a lot more respectable and very few people have that much. Once the economy settles down a little I'd be interested to see if GDKP pugs start to pick up and what kind of prices items would go for.

Ice barrier is the single most important part for aoe farming imo. Gives so much room for error.
---
I've been 60 since the second week. Still have rank 1 kick and gouge, never learned expose armor, only poisons I have are crippling II and instant VI.
---
Recount, Details!, etc.
---
I play a shaman and I try to rez every corpse I see as well! I've had a lot of nice people early on help me out with stuff so I like to pay it forward.
---
So they said change your name and you didn't, now you're banned?
---
Jesus christ OP
---
For 2.) If you are having trouble finding which target to attack and your tank isn't marking (skull, X) you can click on your tank and press 'F' to switch to the target-of-your-target.
---
You have to be somewhat careful with this however as tanks will be bouncing around to multiple enemies to keep aggro on everything.
---
How are you... oh... hunter... nvm.
---
E
---
Guildmate have +230 runs for SGC.
---
He starts to get mentally instable.
---
Oh, I am dumb, I thought this guy accidentally listed it for 72s instead of 72g...
---
A few bad players doesn’t mean the whole guild is sour.  Place blame where it is due instead of casting a wide net with a sensationalist headline
---
Cringe. As a mage, this embarrasses me.
---
As a tank, the only way I'd run strat live with a pug would be if I got all the orbs (or, alternatively, all the greens and blues the group doesn't need). 
---
I can get over 30g/hr farming azshara satyr or sm armory without having to deal with pugs. I prefer that over *maybe* getting one orb in a run that likely takes an hour plus the time it takes for people to get there (and the time to get back if there's no mage).
---
Druids are the tambourine players in the band.
---
Not really enough information here to help. Depends what you want from a class or what you find fun. I'd say rogues are a nice change from hunter, but again, just depends if you wanna play another strictly DPS class.
---
&gt; You'll just pull aggro and die a lot, there's a reason why aoeing as a mage is more effective as frost: tanks can't hold aggro on everything. 
---
If you are running spell cleave, you are frost.  If you are not running spell cleave, then it doesn't matter what spec you are.  If you AoE when you are not supposed to, you'll pull aggro.  Just because your blizzard slows or your AoEs have more slow components aren't changing the fact that you are fucking up by throwing AoEs out when you should just be casting Frostbolt or Fireball instead.
---
But hey, you do you.  If you think that AE and Blizzard are always necessary, stay frost, so the tank has a prayer of being able to pick up the mobs after you ice block and they are now all on the healer.
---
Reading comprehension. Go read the original post. Now read my reply.
---
Now repeat until you understand this:
---
Between option A and option B, A is better at PvP.
---
Anyway, I've seen people try to save face like you before by pretending not to know wtf is going on and sidestepping. Honestly don't have time for this.
---
Once again, ironically, get on the same page as the rest of us.
---
Once again, everyone knows MM Surv is better for PvP, you are NOT special, just deficient at reading and possessed of too big an ego to admit you were off tangent on this thread. 
---
That is all.
---
It was an epic BOE drop. He told everyone to greed it, then rolled need as the last person. Then posted it on the AH
---
Kick and gouge are questionable, but expose armor is great against bosses with a druid or paladin tank. Boosts their threat and both of your damage. And mind-numbing poison is excellent for pvp.
---
Them: I’m done with this insect. Boom roasted. 
---
Everyone else: Jesus, what an insecure lunatic.
---
/w Morgraine-Morgraine Hey Morgraine
---
This was my grinding spot for a while as well and had been considering headed back there after I hit 60.  I didn't bother keeping hard numbers like this, I just knew I was making lots more than I was other places.  Thanks for sharing the data!
---
Ugh,  somebody said pl0x in my group yesterday and I wanted to kick them before the run even started.
---
Thanks again yes I was just wondering because the Undead area is visually appealing to me. Thank you for taking the time
---
Jandice Barov, the Blood Steward and the Theoden Kratinov all normallly drop it. Might not be 100% but it's fairly common.
---
Obviously it doesn't drop for players who haven't completed the quest yet.
---
Gallows End is fantastic, with an awesome musical score that makes it even better.  I think I'll head back there tonight for a toast
---
Around 205 to stand a chance of catching fish, but 305 effective if you don't want to miss any (so 225 skill + 5 from pole + 75 from lure).
---
With something like this. [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/023050213420105021-05500104005](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/023050213420105021-05500104005)

He took a tanking helm from a dps warrior lol
---
I've run into them on Blaumeux before, yeah. 10/10 would buy their bathwater again.
---
This was a cute little slap fight
---
SJWs wouldnt use the word "retarded".  Imagine being so obsessed with SJWs that you think someone calling out a bad troll is just someone being an SJW.  You need to take a break from your hatred bud.  Go on a vacation, clear your mind.
---
I hope your healer sends you a medical bill
---
I traveled to Amsterdam recently and had no issue
---
I'm still like this with retail wailing caverns.
---
I'll assume the guy your responding too asked why my other comment is being downvoted.
---
The truth is its downvoted because of the toxic trash here. It was a simple question. And it got plenty of great answers that had actual math. Which none of the 3 rogues explained to me. 
---
And your wrong, I don't want to be told "im right". I wanted my question to be answered. Which is why I asked it. Duh.
---
Also from sunken temple bosses tend to have aggro reset abilities which affects the tank. Without a taunt, unless your dpses are only hunters / rogues, a pala tank is just a shitty dps, upon the first aggro reset
---
Stand at a distance and use a low damage ranged attack like throw or shoot. Sit stand repeatedly with X. /flex on em.
---
Questie is a good psuedo alternative to the Retail quest map. It at least gets you in the right direction/location. 
---
STV is great bc there are a million quests and skins (if your a Druid skinner like me) but man, at night, it can become an absolute warzone. IF you can quest during the day, def check out STV, if you play only at night -- you might have to go elsewhere. Southshore has good quests, but again -- there is a massive Horde issue.
---
I am a level 41 Shaman. Am I high enough lvl to do this? If so, is it easy for horde?
---
make a macro to target him and be patient
---
My warrior is logged in Undercity. I’ll make sure she takes a detour tonight to head to the tavern and raise a glass in his honor. So terribly sorry for your loss. ❤️
---
I'm actually tempted to delete my alliance characters just to do this now.
---
No, those are Moonkin Druids.
---
The fighting over devilsaur leather is intense. Worth a lot of gold.
---
I leave those groups out of pure principle tbh.

Haha, thanks man!

Despite all my rage I am still just a kaldorei mage....
---
Yup. I've had peeps getting way shitty at me for not providing said food fast enough 🤔
---
I don't want your sympathy, and I don't really care if you think I'm lying. It's not like you have the ability to overturn my suspension.
---
But if I can keep other people from dealing with this bullshit, posting this was worthwhile.
---
Use /chicken
---
I was full arms with a little bit of prot back during vanilla, was able to get to rank 11 in PvP while tanking up to the first boss in Naxx. [This](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LMGxdNio0zcZxfzox) is my spec here, you don't need the lower half of the prot tree to tank effectively.
---
Make friends, it's easier to aquire upgrades when everyone knows eachother.
---
Like the naxx slimes after patch
---
Maybe he just really hates fratinizing with the other faction? Who knows. 
---
I will attack people who /flex
---
Use retaliation.
---
If you need it that bad, buy it.
---
hah, I'm glad someone else recognized it!
---
I used /roar and /ready
---
i guess being ninja'd is your take on enjoying the game
---
i've been going back and forth from the EU the last couple months, even played on airplane wifi for 6 hours one day. 
---
no problems here. dont panic your life over 1 dude on the internet, who may not have given the full story.
---
Not really looking for a specific thing tbh, just polling the community for what they find fun and enjoyable. My only real constraint is I'd rather not play an oversaturated class like mages, and to a lesser extent priest.
---
Roleplaying
---
Do you have first aid?  Potions?  
---
When your damage stinks, you want to try and outlast him.  Overpower is your best friend.  You take a big chunk of damage early in the fight, so I first try to build up rage to intimidating shout-&gt; bandage.  Take note that the rogue will have to have ZERO bleeds on him as any single point of damage breaks intimidating shout.   But if you can get off a full bandage you'll be in great shape. 
---
At that point, I would get a 1h/shield and go defensive and try to get a disarm off.  Once you disarm the rogue does jack doo doo for 10 seconds, switch back to your 2h and hopefully get him into execute range. 
---
But you are at a disadvantage.  Maximum DPS prior to level 30 is rough, you might be best off spamming hamstring to try and get crits (for deep wounds) or overpower procs.  Warrior PVP life is ROUGH until you get close to level 40.
---
I'd definitely prefer to just quest all the way to 60, but I've almost run out of yellow quests at 45. I wish I had ran more dungeons so I wasn't in this position. Gonna try to run ZF until the orange quests are yellow.
---
were you arms or fury?
---
He’s there with you right now , in your heart just because you don’t see him doesn’t mean he isn’t there.
---
It's honestly better to just run imp until you get succi at level 20. VW in classic is garbage. Doesn't do any damage and it has lots of issues holding aggro. Keep up demon armor.
---
First time playing non pserv  WOW, and Thursday before going into my first MC with my guild we popped ony buff and got ambush by 3 raids of allys. It’s sucks that we lost our buffs but that experience of turning your camera to see 40 gnomes and other enemies storming at you in Kargath was such a funny experience to me because that’s what pvp servers are about
---
Probably the worst thing that could be added. Group finder was the beginning of the end of retail.
---
Should we know who these people are? If you want to spread word about a guild maybe include the server in your post.
---
This is why I use questie and zygors lol
---
I got "why do we have a cat.dps?" yet if it wasn't for me popping out of.form to help heal on Herod, we would have wiped. These people aren't worth the stress.
---
I am away from home 75% of the time for work, and I play on my laptop. I’m currently in Colombia, but I live in the US. I hope this issue doesn’t effect me. I can’t believe they won’t look at the proof. This is ridiculous blizzard. People need to get their gains while they travel.
---
Always makes me laugh when people act like one faction is a different irl species than the other.
---
My favorite is a rogue the other day. Attacks me with multiple others a couple of times and emote spams me. Low and behold, I run into the same rogue solo, who I kill multiple times. Then I get spammed with angry nessages on discord about how I only pick unfair fights which is all the horde can do... from an ally rogue who had attacked me first with multiple people.
---
Some people who play this game really puzzle me at times. Also makes me laugh when I see people bitching in general chat about how alliance can only gank and have no honor... while Im running around ganking people.
---
Why do you even roll on a PVP server? I just don't get it.
---
Considering he replied "Just having a moment" to his wife instead of talking to her about it, but talking to reddit about if in detail... yeah, this is free back rubs.  
---
Talk to the family, visit the graveyard, there are countless ways of honoring a dead family member. Writing a sob story on reddit that you can relate to WoW for strangers you have never met and will never meet is just about yourself.
---
How exactly am I the only person in this thread not allowed to have an opinion on this?
---
At this point I realize that you just messed up your original statement, but it seems you're just digging deeper and deeper, by only going for my person with no attempt at defending or explaining your statement.
---
yeah, except there really is such a thing as bad publicity
---
I loved Duskwood, the mood is spot on.
---
Wow I didn’t know I needed this until now
---
Nope, just my toon!
---
Generally speaking, anyone who was in the military and claims to be a badass killer mother fucker is 95% lying.  My boy served in the reserves in Kuwait.  The most dangerous thing he did was go through customs on his way home.  Better believe he's pussy ass wears a ton of "tough guy" vet shirts and hats.
---
Don't forget the mobs with 30 minute debuffs, super wide area in which mobs call friends, and the tightly packed nature of many of the mobs. It's a horrible zone for horrible people, I skip it like the plague it is.
---
/taunt 
---
It literally says "bring it on!'
---
Christ, I started crying man. I am really happy you had your moment brother, and Ill be having a brew Gallows End Tavern
---
lol, what an absolute scumbag.
---
There’s no way anyone bought that for 300g. Lower level players don’t have that kinda money, and higher level players who do know that it’s not worth that much.
---
It was the dude who kept warning us about THE jump that fell last time I went.
---
I’m 43 and am so glad to find out I can turn them off
---
I mean even so most of the fights are mechanically a joke and all of the classes are really easy to play.
---
Like, it's not hard to do good damage as a rogue warrior or mage, and the most complexity you'll see in a fight is to move out of your group when you get a debuff or move out of deep breath.
---
BFA trash mobs in uldir have more mechanics than vanilla bosses.
---
If I remember correctly the lava still does damage (thus canceling the Water Walking) but you can still take fall damage similar to people jumping onto the water with Water Walking.
---
Is this true? I’ve done WC so many times now in classic I can do it blindfolded but I’ll be eating my hat if this trick is true !
---
Awesome, tyvm! I'll have to look into it, later, but this will save me some time and give me a starting point on things for what I'm looking for. Thanks, again!
---
&gt;Your argument kinda screams that individuals of a minority are somehow hurt more by these jokes than individuals of a majority, this doesn't hold true.
---
Bullshit. Comedy doesn't have to be that way. It's possible to be hilarious, even when talking about and dealing with things like racial issues, without punching down.
---
The best comedy punches up. It doesn't have to be at the expense of people already getting fucked.
---
&gt;My subjective take on that is that if communal office never has clean coffee cups because one scumbag keeps hogging them, that hurts me more than some joke making derogatory remarks about my ethnicity/sexuality
---
There's a reason I said "house" and "running low". I work from home, and things don't run out.
---
I, and I think icyveins as well iirc, go 3/5 2h spec to max hamstring
---
just my luck ret has literally been on cd everytime i get ganked lol but yea u right
---
Or Uldaman..
---
yikes
---
i'm guilty of this as well. for example helped a dwarf hunter do an elite quest, after he had looted the item i killed him. find it funny to be chaotic neutral sometimes, ganking or helping or just sapping people and running away depending on how i feel at the moment. my original plan was to help him kill the waves of mobs then bring the boss elite down to 1/4 health then kill him but that seemed a little too evil.
---
Over: Warrior, Warlock, Priest, Mage
---
Neutral: Hunter, Rogue, Shaman
---
Under: Druid
---
This is on a PvE server.
---
Yes! WC, ST, DM, Mara, BRD, exactly what makes classic so great!
---
That one jump, where you can actually just autorun and make it... At least as a human rogue. :)
---
Charge, and no not /charge, but /cast charge
---
Nope. 
---
When you play a tank and a chest piece drops that you and two other DPS party members roll on as well, you are officially the tambourine player. 
---
But continue letting people know how they should feel playing a Druid from the perspective of a Rogue main.
---
If you really want to prot level I would say don't do it until level 40.  Before level 40 you have VERY little talents boosting your damage in the prot tree.  At least after 40 you can get shield slam to do some respectable damage.
---
man i am loving this new era of "gif ganks"
---
The bright future of algorithms!
---
The problem here is a self esteem from developers and support that is far to high.
---
Those algorithms won't work well today and they will not for a long long time.
---
Look at it this way: in the future everything you do is checked by similar algorithms.
---
Everything. And if you do anything that leads to a false positive it may lead to harsh consequences for you, your family, your life and the life of your beloved ones.
---
It is not a big thing on an WOW account... but imagine the same thing for your bank account... for your work, for your internet access at home.
---
Politicians do not understand this problem and they listen to experts that programm those algorithms.
---
The first thing everybody has to understand is that no system is working perfect. To keep a community stable you have to take care of those who have some bad luck.
---
The illusion is that those are to few to matter but that turned out wrong in the past. There were single human beings that changed history and those changes never were nice times.
---
Therefor your posting here is very important as it may convince at last some people that algorithms are not perfect and never will be.
---
This is the first and most important rule if you use algorithms for measurement of human beings!
---
You cant rly get people to do more dps through "encouragment" unless they were straight not trying and trying to coast off the others.
---
Aside from providing proof to such assholes that they need to work or leave, linking meters in chat usually just serves for people with good gear to feel good and people without to feel shitty. It also often facilitates shitting on undergeared players, which is dumb because clearly they are in your dg/raid group to improve that
---
Dance studio when, Jeff?
---
52 here but on 4 long days in a row then away for the weekend.
---
I can feel it edging closer and closer but this weeks ground to a halt. Rip.
---
Check the auction house and classicdb if you are looking for specific recipes
---
I think it is also server choice. I chose a server that was low pop because the first day I tried to login to a server and it was laggy and got booted. The next day I logged in to a queue so I joined the lowest pop server and I haven’t had any issues with anything since then. Seems like all the ragers are on the high pop super competitive servers.
---
To me, any offer is fine so long as it's stated upfront. I just don't want to spend time constantly negotiating with random people who open up with vague requests. With how many messages mages tend to get, I'm sure most mages feel the same way.
---
Bosses don't live long enough for expose armor to matter, and I run double crip in pvp mostly. I'll get em all eventually, it just wasn't worth dropping 20g into skills I basically never use when I still haveany useful things to spend gold on.
---
I don't think refusing the second time is making the world a better place.
---
I think it will make them spiteful, if anything.
---
How does OPs post change the context? OP didn't mention pvp. Only you did. 
---
I'm only responding to your claim that BM is better for pvp. No, it isn't better.
---
It's that simple. 
---
Please dance around how wrong you are some more, it's mildly entertaining.
---
At least you learned something today.
---
Lmao.
---
Dont worry man. I rolled need on a neckpiece in UBRS the other day and beat a priest for it and he told me to go die IRL.
---
Just because the speed is slower, does not mean the top end damage will be higher.
---
130-174 has 152 in the middle of it
---
70-182 has 126 in the middle of it
---
Which has the higher top end damage? Throwing dps, weapon speed, avg damage, etc into everything is going to confuse people who are trying to learn when they have to look through 8 different numbers.
---
Don’t attack any yellow mobs and when the mage gets aggrod upstairs the whole bar becomes aggressive
---
Legit question - I normally politely whisper folks asking for water at the beginning of a long questing session, but I'm a poor-ass level 20 priest. How much should I be  tipping?
---
Mechanostriders are pretty fucking terrible
---
Then you need the original green-screen footage or software capable of smart-cropping, I really don't think a classic-shitpost needs at least a week of work to be deemed "correct", it's all just good fun

How do you get skills 1+8 on the side? My controls don't do that, it forces me to use mb 1, 2, and that's it...

---
Most use Volvo or DD engines. No?
---
I don't think thats true. I'm 28 and have no troubles with world PvP. Actually i feel like priest is very (very) strong if played right. Conserve your mana a bit and slowly watch your opponents die from your wand and debuffs. Everytime you get in low HP you can heal fully up with one shield. Untop of that we have great amounts of HP and armor because of our buffs. Our armor buff procs with our shield and If you happen to play undead that survivability is even better because of the racial debuff lowering all melee dmg and if you have thoose two up while shielding I don't even see the enemy removing it before the 15 second cooldown timer for a new shield is up. And If things do get dicey, just use your instant cast fear, will have them pulling mobs all whilst you get to full health in no time.
---
Point is, don't play them as a dps class and burn your mana. Play them defensive as healers. You will be undefeatable in world PvP even before 40.
---
IIRC both caves have Yetis that drop the Rod, but in one cave it's a 1/200 and in the other a 1/1000 chance

Do dynamic spawn rates affect instances? I know a bunch of instances have had respawn times nerfed from 30 min to 2 hours over the course of a few patches. I wonder if some still have the 30 min timers.

I see, ty

Yeah no, scarlet kris.

Fair enough!

I had a guy named manbat run up to me and give me a potion and then run away saying "so long citizen"

Just stand close-ish to it and it’ll display that it’s trapped in the tooltip in the bottom right.
---
Time ≠ Difficulty
---
This. If someone asks me and I am on and available I will do it for them. If they don't tip they get added to ignore. It just takes too much time to get food/water made to not get something out of the transaction.

You and your friend clearing out that gnoll camp while some dude casually strides up and takes that chest you're fighting tooth and nail for?

There's an emote for that.

That is not a priest weapon to begin with. You should not be up front meleeing things

I think people like #nochanges for dual specialization is because of the lack of pressure to choose a role. It certainly makes the game easier and you don’t have to worry about spending tons of gold on respeccing allowing you to not commit to healer or dps or tank. There should be a price to pay for not wanting to commit to a spec and that’s reflected in the gold price as it doubles. Dual spec simply is for casuals and retail.
---
There are really cheap rage pots you can get that are great for pvp. The recipe is at a secret vendor I cant remember where should be easy to find.
---
You mean his previous world record? It was recently shattered by Jokerd. Even if you added time to account for using layering resets for the last 2 levels, this record was smashed out of the park.

Did Blizz removed that from Classic only? Or also from Retail? Why just now?

I can second this. I tanked BRD up to incendius as arms, lvl 55

That's how most of the instances are once you hit around 40. Uldaman has like a ten level range.

Absolutely. I’ve been dungeon running with my discord. We have all known each other 10 years and it is really nice knowing no one is going to ninja.

Nope. Never. AoEing is too fun.

I'm surprised if many are popping flasks for MC/Ony. Maybe the hp/fireres ones for tanks (?), but flasks are super unnecessary for dps/healers. I've sold dreamfoil and mountain silversage stacks on various days and haven't noticed big changes in prices.
---
IKR! Dang Thrall Got some sick game. Would've loved to see crazy intricate dances like these back in the day. Too bad they scraped it cause this vid kind of makes me realize the real potential it has.
---
Oh, that's handy. Had no idea that option existed.
---
And no cloak or helm
---
If this ain't the truest shit I've ever read
---
Imagine being over the age of 16 and saying "red pill" unironically.
---
I recently gave up on VuhDo because it doesn't support healing predictions, and a couple other minor issues. Get LunaUnitFrames instead (not available through Curse/Twitch, you have to download it from github instead), it replaces both your standard player/target frames and raid/party. And try to spread the word, because for healing predictions to work everyone in the raid needs to be using it or another LibHealComms compatible addon.
---
I find its configurations to be more intuitive as well. After a bit of tweaking I got it to look just the way I want it to, though I'd still like to see renew indicators in raid frames (kinda like Grid did with its dots). It doesn't have click casting so you need to set up Clique for that, or macro all your spells to work on mouseover.
---
What evidence do you have that they're clearly new? I regularly play with a handful of experienced hunters who simply forget, and yes, I've called them noobs. You're assuming that the hunter is new because you seem to want to think the chain OP is an asshole. He didn't say anything about him being a new player.
---
Regardless, it's a totally benign comment. The backlash to such a simple thing is really reinforcing that people playing classic really are an overly sensitive bunch. Sometimes people pull a noob move. Who cares? The response from the hunter didn't show someone totally discouraged but someone looking to get angry over little shit. If you get butthurt everytime someone makes even the slightest negative comment about your gameplay ability you're going to have a bad time, and new players need not just be shielded forever from this.
---
Congratulations!
---
And I thought I was lucky with 20 minuts drop tiny red whelp
---
Usually for me it's a live and let live. Every now and then tho I'll (try to)kill 1st one I see and move on with my day just cos sometimes I feel like a good fight. Never camping (waste of my and their time) never laughing at corps(feels like a Dick move) sometimes I'll help em when they are struggling with a mob. Kinda all depends on how I feel, mostly live and let live tho
---
Any help turning off smoke/gas effects? They tank my fps.
---
Implying someone is not friendly because you react with hostility to friendly greetings, actually. You getting offended by people being friendly to you is a you problem, not a them problem.
---
with mount hyjal and now CoT being seemingly fully developed visual wise, it seems quite obvious we can expect some classic+ stuff in 2 years
---
If you do nothing but kill a same level creature every 30 seconds, you'll go from 20-40 in 32.5 hours.
---
I'm with you. Stonetalon is ass for questing and soo time consuming.
---
Running into a mage in the open world and asking for food and water is different to consenting to being the healer in the group, the mage gets nothing out of it whilst in a group you're getting xp/gold/items.
---
A, because I come from the bank usually and it just maintains the angle I come in at, less turning.
---
Thanks so much for the info man this is great. I think I’ll opt for the jack of all trades build and see how that goes for me.
---
Proud of that man. Worked to get my lw up and be able to craft that set.
---
LF1M Tank Strat LIVE - 1st orb reserved to the tank
---
Now go look at the dungeons that followed in later xpacs and you dont have anything nearly as intricate. I suspect they wanted karazhan in classic. SFK, WC, BRD actually felt like environments that were used. Arcatraz is a glorified hallway.
---
use google
---
Not yet lol
---
Other than being a sick fire resistance trinket no it's too situational to actually get good use out of.
---
you know the answer to this.  Either he needs to be out of guild or you should find a different one if leadership supports him.
---
Or priest =D
---
Bias exists every in everyday experiences regardless of data.  Someone could perceive this data as not being an asshole done the number of occurrences go down... My original statement was an opinion anyways and by the number of people upvoting it, may be a popular one.  People suck
---
No :/ it's been like that as long as I can remember, as early as level 10, maybe even before that. I don't have any - stamina gear.
---
No they can take it for free when it dropped.
---
I deleted it 10 minutes after I posted it since I thought I was going to turn it into a gif, turns out I'd rather just play the game then do that.
---
I'm new to the game so can anyone tell me how hard it would be for a level 27 dwarf hunter to make it to this tavern? I will also go there and drink until I puke in honor of OP's brother.
---
One thing that bothered me is my nightelf tiger mount doesn't roar when I press the space bar or growl when it yawns, is that an epic mount thing because I distinctly remember this in vanilla
---
I don't understand why they have the landscape glow...it's ugly, it's too bright, everything is orange and ugly.
---
I didn't mind the bright sand in Tanaris, it made me feel a bit more like I was actually in a desert with the sun glaring in my eyes.
---
I'm amazed that OP was able to farm that many Whelps considering the number of players who seem to always be right there with you trying to kill the same mobs as you are....then they are  done and move on.....only to be replaced by another group.
---
No /lick?
---
When in doubt, go left. Always go left.
---
Like a rat in trap.
---
Bye bud :)
---
The dwarves are the ultimate good guys
---
Again, he said he was confident he will eventually be paid back and currently WoW is in BFA. I know what TBC is, and the joke is that hes still "expecting" to be paid back today while we are in BFA where gold is easy to get. Its impossible for him to expect to get it currently in TBC because its impossible to have a TBC only client through Blizzard right now.
---
Are you really that dense or just trolling?
---
I've got a bottle of Cuergo's Gold sitting in my bank. Think I might just drop by Bril this evening. Seems a good a chance as any to toast.
---
I'll definitely have a drink tonight when I log in, for your brother.
---
Though the hurt remains, rejoice in the voices of the many who cry out his name in honor.
---
 Aka'Magosh.
---
Completely wrong, you don't need to have a separate account. You need a separate subscription (if you want both EU and NA, or only one if you want either), on the same account, and you can manage them [here](https://account.blizzard.com/games#game-accounts)
---
It happens, no biggie.
---
I have a little blue whelp I farmed back in Vanilla and I named it Awbee after the UBRS whelp. I farmed for that drop for weeks. But I got it. 
---
When we were able to get blue dragon flying mounts, in my head canon, my blue dragon is just my whelp all grown up and we’ve just had a ton of crazy adventures together for 15+ years.
---

Ok. Now youre just making me want to replace sound files with silly and goofy alternatives. I want hamstring to sound like im squeezing a rubber ducky.
---
Yeah BoP is exactly the same as BoE.
---
Also 2g is the same as 100g.
---
You got me there.
---
Summoning stones
---
Dexterbravo was able to pull 500+ DPS with a spell power build with consumables(no raid buffs). I think ret would be okay(i.e. not bottom 2 dps) if people stopped building them like a warrior.
---
Some people claim to warlock tank dungeons fairly regularly/easily (pending on the dungeon) 
---
Like staysafe TV: 
---
https://youtu.be/Jh1dGAEbdIs
---
No this only works if you have a quality stream or some kinda pull for an audience.
---
Why do that at all? The leveling in classic is engaging, there's a real risk of death and you need to consider carefully how you approach a situation(at least for me as a warrior). 
---
That's way more enjoyable then the AoE zergfest that is retail leveling.
---
Ratchet is like the Jersey shore, Booty Bay is like Florida.
---
Thanks for the nice comment!
---
Sad to hear such a loss. I hope you can find some peace in this game and hope it brought back some of the good memories too.
---
Everybody, let's fill Gallows' to the bar!!! Let's have one last hooray for our missing fellow.
---
Cheers!
---
Various nukes use them end game, you go through candy and summons like crazy.
---
Wait...let me check myself.
---
Are you saying that in his more recent streams he has admitted that he was wrong before or been anti-ninja looting?  Because legit...I'll drop all criticism if he's had a change of heart.
---
My experience with him was an unapologetic articulation that basically said when it comes to loot, he will ninja loot things and he liked that in vanilla.
---
Look...I don't care that he gets given things or that he's kind of a troll, I'm not bored enough to waste my time caring about every little thing he does.  I'm mostly concerned with the meta-battle over loot thinking that consumes the community and how he affects it.  If he's been wholesome on that issue of late...I take no issue with him.
---
Never? Have you ran 1 or 2 dungeons total? 
---
Not trying to sound like a dick, but holy shit this happens allllll the time.
---
&gt;The greed button is for when you don't care about what happens to the gold, but still want a chance if nobody else needs it.
---
They are both for gold because that is all a boe is. Gold.
---
I think I’ve done about 20 runs
---
Got 1 savage gladiator, 1 second wind, 1 banthok, 0 hoj.
---
STOP! Mods delete this cancer already
---
The completely needless and senseless use of "honestly" is what actually pissed me off more than anything.
---
I agree multiboxers are the true enemies
---
You got 2 pets in 8-10h???
---
I camped that spot for ages and got jack
---
cmon nerds, DDOS him right now.
---
New raids that’s introduce gear to make other specs viable of similar / low tier would be amazing though. It feels bad telling a new friend that if he wants to play shaman he has to play healer basically late game
---

---
Tanked lbrs recently as arms with a priest as healer that is not specced heal. It went very smooth, I was 56
---
Alliance are the bad guys so this is pretty fitting.
---
I didn’t spend four hours there, but I did have a frustrating run. I needed the dungeon, so when I saw an LFG message, I joined. 
---
Warrior, Rogue, and Healer are already there outside the entrance, frenziedly slaughtering troggs and leper gnomes. I join in. It takes the ret paladin 20 minutes to get there. When he arrives, we take down Techbot. Paladin angrily yells “THANKS FOR WAITING” and ditches; it seems that he wasn’t QUITE there yet (we thought he was) and didn’t get the quest item. We keep slaughtering troggs and gnomes to get the punchcard and find a mage (?) to replace. She arrives and suddenly the healer and rogue are gone. Still in the tunnel killing things, just not in group.
---
So the mage sends out the call to her guild and eventually gets replacements for our missing teammates. We’ve been at this for the better part of 45 minutes and haven’t even entered the instance.
---
Finally everyone gets their punchcards and we roll in. Do the Grubbis event, Warrior gets Grubbis paws, keep clearing trash, make it to the Clean Room. Everyone splits up to play the slots machines for ten minutes (I vendored the grimy junk because fuck that). We start forming up to keep going aaaaand...
---
The warrior DC’s. Hard. We wait another ten minutes four-manning the trash (luckily, War wasn’t tanking for us; think we had a bear at this point) before we decide to kick and replace. Mage gets a 43 warlock from her guild. So at this point, I am the only person from the original party still left following along behind what is essentially a guild carry for the mage. At this point, we’ve been at this for an hour and a half and just got up to Viscous Fallout.
---
I will say this, the run was pretty smooth at this point. The only downside was grabbing Essential Artificials, because these guys were all over those Gnomeregan refrigerators. I managed to get 8, total.
---
Did I say mostly smooth? That’s until we hit The Hallway. Weren’t those landmines supposed to have a 5-second arming period? Or at least not blow unless someone stepped on them? Well, neither was the case; they might as well have been Dark Iron Bombs; they went off IMMEDIATELY. And we wiped. At least twice, maybe three times. Even with Sheeps, kicks, stuns, whatever, we got blown to hell. I managed to Vanish out of one and save a death run with my Jumper cables, but still. I started running away when I saw a “dark iron landmine” cast and STILL got blown up.
---
Thermaplugg was almost anticlimactic after that. We killed him, loot happened, we left, I got quest pants. Then snuck in the back door three levels later to raid the fridges for Artificial Munchies.
---
False. Cleave and AOE.
---
Wow, it will display that for all classes? I don’t recall seeing that when I stood close and then it broke open.
---
Darnsassus is trees, rain, and hippies.
---
So Portland or Seattle, take your pick.
---
We ran a similar system - except that we ran our own system which aggregated data and reduced management to nearly 0.
---
Which was used as a foundation for decision making.
---
But yea, if there's no transparency then it pretty much fails there.
---
No system is perfect, but LC can be near perfection if done right - unlike other system which always has a certain detail or flaw and it's a matter of choosing a system where the flaw is acceptable.
---
That's pretty sad man
---
Madlad still has autoattack bound to 1
---
It's really all about getting a few vitals to match. Cloak, shoulders, tabard, gloves. Everything else, as long as it doesn't clash horribly, can work. Shirts do a lot to help.
---
no prot is not really viable, even in dungeons. you lack threat and crucial talents from the arms tree. prot is a raid only spec.
---
I recently gave a big wallotext advice to a lock, check my post history for it.
---
That’s all well and good, but once again I wasn’t advocating for the change. If any of you had read what I said, never once did I say “I think they should do this.” Multiple times I said “I’m fine with how things are, nothing needs to change.” I fully comprehend how player spec is a choice and adds identity and blah blah all that stuff, I know that and get it. It’s fine, I like it. I don’t need vanilla design to be explained to me, I’ve played it plenty.
---
Now that I’ve made that abundantly clear again, let’s move on to hypotheticals.
---
Discussing dual spec and lumping every other change into it is just completely missing the point. Even assuming they did add dual spec, there’s no requirement that says everything else goes with it. Yeah yeah “it’s a slippery slope,” but that’s just an assumption on your part. It could easily be just that and nothing else.
---
All I said that pushed this guy into a fit is that this one singular change wouldn’t break the game, quitting over it would be stupid. I suggested that some people are so obsessed with “no changes” they don’t even respond rationally, because we’ve already gotten a game with some changes and yet this inevitable landslide of slippery slope arguments have not given us retail in classic like people predicted.
---
I just got Aimed Shot and wanted to test it out on an unsuspecting Horde. Found a Warlock fighting something in Un'Goro and it finished off what was left of his health. I moved on not wanting to camp or anything since I was already kinda rude. Saw him later and /waved at him. He immediately started throwing up a bunch of DoTs. Managed to kill him, but then he Soul Stoned. Killed him again. I did have to take a health pot to not die to the DoTs though. Saw him a few more times around that evening. He didn't start anything though...
---
Starcraft takes the cake for most fair pvp game imo. There is no one but yourself to blame there.
---
CS is pretty good but you still have teammates.
---
If 4 people hit greed then 1 person can ninja the item by needing.
---
Having everyone need allows for everyone to have an equal shot at getting the item. 
---
Yes, in a perfect would we should all be able to hit greed and if someone actually wanted the item to wear they hit need. 
---
But over time ninjas made that an impossible practice. So in the early days of Vanilla is slowly became common and acceptable for everyone to need on BOE epics.
---
You'd be amazed at the number of people who can learn and execute some weird kiting/LoS/whatever strat, but can't wrap their minds around just using a kick/pummel/counterspell on a heal instead.
---
The authenticator might have saved me, I've since added it to my account.
---
Now you can farm bats for 25 hours for 1k gold. Have fun!
---
Kirtonos must have all the nice mages. Can’t say I’ve had a single complaint so far (other than being annoyed at mages aoe farming all the quest mobs while im stuck trying to go 1 by 1).
---
It’s the warriors that have been mega-douches in my experience.
---
It's funny watching you lunatics stumble over each other the find the right clips to farm drama-karma with.
---
Oof
---
good luck!
---
There is nothing friendly about calling an unknown person your friend or brother?
---
I don't see what is wrong with it
---
Thanks! Everyone’s racing to 60 and it felt like an odyssey to reach 44 haha
---
I play a tank - It can actually be done without feeling entitled.
---
99% off
---
Just so you know, druids are actually amazing tanks for aoe farming. There are some misconceptions that tanks need to hold threat but that's not true. Tanks pull and group then get out of melee range. Once this is done, your only responsibility is to grab stragglers that manage to escape slows and try to fix bad pulls. It's actually really nice to have a druid tank because they can hurricane or heal when they aren't needed instead of just standing away from mobs.
---
I've been leveling as fury and completely shaming the dps of arms warriors I group with - hit and crit gear absolutely magnify fury's effectiveness but around lvl 35-40 arms is very subpar for any sort of dps except aoe.
---
Download Healbot or VuhDo. It puts up a frame where you can click the frames to heal people instead of switching targets all the time. 5x easier and faster.
---
I didnt even get it lel
---
Thanks, I might just copy that. However, I thought Offhand Specialization was a really important talent with 50% extra dmg from offhand, would you argue this is not the case? I would think it's for example more important than Remorseless Attacks, which is really dependent on getting a kill within the past 30 seconds
---
I have only ever played Alliance but I found this post very moving. I would like to go to this inn tonight after work to make a toast &amp; have a drink. What area will I find the inn? What level would I need to be, if anything is required? What race starts out the closest?
---
Probably Friendly Nameplates (shift-v to hide/show). You can probably turn it off with the "show nameplates" setting for friendly pets/minions.
---
It's all rouges and mages that think like this. Its cus they dont want healers rolling on gear. It sucks doing anything but partying heal specd. Good thing us healers deal with it tho. Who would keep the dps up when they always take aggro.
---
I don't even watch the guy it just happen to be on the top of twitch so I popped in to check it out and couldn't believe how these guys talk
---
My wife from Australia is in Vietnam at the moment same situation nothing bad happened to her account yet.

Press V to toggle?

What a new and original opinion! I certainly haven't seen this sentiment before on this subreddit.
---
Yes, you’re right, I confused two words and am therefore completely wrong
---
/s
---
Run the numbers! Do a theoretical encounter in excel. Could get some interesting results.
---
/duel not work?
---
There's a callback feature. If after a final appeal the decision is still upheld then there's really nothing left to do. Blizz must believe you paid someone to level for you or Blizz is really wrong with their conclusion.
---
No, that's a terrible waste of gold for such a fast weapon, how often do you want to be restocking on ammo?
---
Do you take commissions?
---
Probably not I live in america and I play with some guy who lives in Belgium.
---
A few friends and I were going to turn in some Hydraxis quests.  I get to the island first and there are 4 Alliance there, but they're not hostile so we just start chilling.  My warrior friend shows up, their warrior shoots him with a bow.  My warrior shoots back.  The duel begins, two tanks just shooting bows at each other, complete with stance dancing between shots for extra/mitigated damage, shield blocks, etc.  Their warrior is losing and mine gets ready, suspecting they'll try something. He gets to 5% and their priest starts a heal, but it's a slow one and their warrior dies to a thorium grenade.  We all have a good laugh, then our mage shows up and immediately goes nuts so they kill us.
---
Meeeeeeee lol every dang time. It's my short gnomish legs.
---
and get like 2.5 bars from the 5 quests you turn in.
---
Definitely not the same race/spec on a new server. No thanks. It's been quite enjoyable leveling up a warrior by feeding him gear, though.
---
Males are the traditional druid anyway, female night elf druids were retconned into the lore for gameplay reasons, and it's tacky as hell. I always prefer to play the race and gender that "makes sense" (male warrior, female rogue, etc).  
---
Male night elf druids don't even look half bad, I think they look pretty bad ass.
---
Main Char: Mage with Tailoring and Mining.
---
Which profession should I drop to get Engineering at 60?

Alt Char: Also a Mage. I'm helping a friend level his Druid.

Which professions should I roll with my alt?

BRD is the crowning achievement of the blizzard design team. It's not a dungeon, it's a CITY.
---
It's crazy to me how many "adults" act like they did 15 years ago when they played.
---
Yeah, I would much rather we got more false negatives than positives. Sure, we all like to see cheaters punished, but it is better for a hundred cheaters to go free than for one innocent player to get banned.
---
Plus, I mean, it is also totally illegal for Blizz to ban you when you haven't violated the ToS. Like, 100% illegal. They can't do that. But it's not like ActiBlizzion ever actually cared about consumer rights or the law.
---
not for selling, leveling up LW, greens get DE
---
Pretty sure i only know that because of reading Harry Potter.
---
I am usually running from the bank/mailbox to AH, i go to A because it is the "straight line" from the angle i come through the door
---
You still regen mana in combat. When a talent says "allows 15% regen in combat," it is referring to the "5 second rule."
---
After you cast a spell, all your Spirit based mana regen stops for 5 seconds.
---
Meditation allows 15% of your Spirit regen to continue during this 5 second period. The wording is confusing.
---
This is why fewer, larger heals are more mana efficient, and why you shouldn't start healing a tank until he has taken a good amount of damage. The big heals with more time in-between casts allow you to regen mana outside of the 5 second rule.
---
Na. You just need to have a plan. You complete the whole zone in 4 trips from Darkshore to questing areas. Its actually the fastest 10-20ish zone in the game if you know what you’re doing. Its just...meh if you don’t know wht to do
---
No you're the only one in the world
---
The problem i'm having as a warrior is people spam whispering me to join their dungeons then getting mad if i don't respond (because i'm afk/ busy), literally take 2 minutes to reply, or getting mad if i say no thanks. Have had 2 people call me bad at the game because i like questing....
---
The retail ui on the char screen. No need to make casters manually add their sp stats ect just cos they don't do melle or ranged physical damage.
---
Summon stones not meeting stones at instances.
---
Longer name plate distance.
---
Guildbanks.
---
Dual spec.
---
I was more BC than vanilla tho
---
If you're interested, check out Kevin Jordan.  He's great and a former classic wow developer.  He's not a typical streamer though, and levels very casually.  Most of his streams he's grouped up aimlessly killing things / farming nodes / engaging in world PvP.  I find his streams informative and relaxing.  Also, plays an orc shammy
---
 [https://www.twitch.tv/kevinjordan/](https://www.twitch.tv/kevinjordan/)
---
I love seeing all these idiots trying to justify 2 for 1 when blizz sales are up 223% only from people who give a shit about classic. Because the current version of WoW is shite
---
I'm fairly certain (like 99.9%) that this is the default setting in Classic. I have no add-ons to change my bars/UI, and I have a different bar with different skills for each of the three stances. I did the same thing you're talking about too, put all 3 skills on number 4, but I can only see one at a time based on what stance I'm in.
---
I know where I am headed in 7 or so hours after I get off work, to have a toast to your brother, on us-ashkandi of anyone wants to join, arez the dwarf hunter.
---
By literally, I meant figuratively.
---
/Spit /fart and /golfclap
---
I like both. Part of the fun of leveling a new character is being able to seriously pimp them out with your main - while also leveling yourself a nice tradeskill alternate. It's great being able to mine up your own Arcane Crystals and xmute your own Arcanite &amp; also have another char to farm your main up some elixirs for raids.
---
Dude!
---
Don't start casting the portal spell until you have your silver.
---
Fare is fair.
---
How the fuck did you get rid of all that other Garbage it puts on your items? This shit is clean af
---
It was always like this.
---
Oh Mograine is it? Which side is he on so I can add him to my kill on sight list?
---
Yes to both, I believe in patch 1.4 they put all fears and seduce on the same DR or else locks could 1v1 just about anyone. Death coil isn’t on the same timer.
---
I love and hate you at the same time.  I know what I'm doing 55-60, and I will have skinning until devilsaur gear and my epic mount.  ♡
---
You are the absolute man!
---
I mean, go ahead and PM him the MM/Surv guide with all the surv talents he'll be using in BRD and late game dungeons! That would really answer his question on which of the two builds he listed out in his question - a third option unrelated to his dungeon performance!
---
Aww, bud. I appreciate the attempt at a jibe, but no one reading this right now is going to think I'm less competent than you in any aspect, not after those mess of comments you made. But what matters is what's in your own head, so go ahead and send it, okay? I don't mind helping someone else feel better about themselves.
---
Yeah I hit 60 and I was like k now what...?
---
you bad bad boy are you going to do some ganking? :D
---
I mean, tanks *are* special.
---
They are more rare and have to carry the group when the dps don't play well.
---
They have the most difficult job most of the time.
---
I have not been able to find a phone number for blizzard customer support, do you have one?
---
Most people are still leveling.
---
No, get in there
---
Check the server populations and get on an even one 👍🏼
---
Lots leveling still.
---
I had this philosophy for a month.  I began filling my bank with light leather and copy ore for those who wanted to skip the first 125 levels and get a good start - or for those wanting to increase another profession like blacksmithing and leatherworking.  My theory was when the economy strengthens, the AH will increase, and I will begin selling things for reasonable amounts.
---
I just don't know if it will before I stop playing WoW.  There's no telling how long it'll take before the AH is higher markings.  The more 60s become apparently in the game, the more cashflow will be going through the economy, players will start transferring gold to their Level 1s.
---
Then Battlegrounds will start, which is when I suspect the AH to boom because Tweaks will begin to show up.
---
Only ones I have heard of is, multi boxing, to keep all the Auction House Dudes dead.
---
But I'm sure there was more to the story.
---
From what I've seen, there's an overabundance of priests for raiding content. I think this is because they're the obvious choice for a healing class and pretty quick at leveling. I've seen a lot of guilds looking for holy paladins, though.
---
r/whooooosh
---
Got it first try, with a 100 roll.  Spent all my rng already.
---
If youre playing with one of your friends and he forgets to switch aspects and you go "lol noob" thats fine. Youre being Ironic, and the person knows that.
---
I agree that youre going to have a bad time if you get butthurt every time someone says anything about your playing ability, but that doesnt mean "lol noob" isnt an asshole way to point out someone could do something better. 
---
OC had no idea if the hunter in question was new or not, and with the age of this release/the fact that subs havent expired for people who didnt sub before release to reserve names its very likely we have a good bulk of players who have never played wow before classic still. Many of them, like my 3-4 noob friends are still switching between classes to find one they like. If the first thing someone said to them was "noob lol" before they started giving advice my friends would tell them to fuck off, and rightfully so. You can give advice without stroking your ego first. Ego stroking onto someone will never result in a positive response from them, and if youre surprised by that i think you lack basic empathy. If you acted like that irl people would think youre a conceited twat.
---
oh wow, thanks!
---
He does have way better healing skills in his arsenal. I’d be pretty annoyed if a group started asking me to play an inefficient spell.
---
None.  Just as long as you are doing it legitimately and not in spots where NPCs or others can’t reach you.  
---
Some of the most fun times I’ve had is being corpse camped and figuring out and executing a plan to escape or fight back
---
Reputation never mattered unless you're infamous. For everyone else they can ninja loot, log off for a snack, come back, and everyone will have forgotten their names.
---
This guy min/maxes
---
Many are still levelling.
---
Lmao that’s hilarious!!! Happy cake day!!
---
You could take any small enough addon and just split the code into macros like that. But why wouldn't you just put it in a .lua file? You could then also build in a /whatever toggle to show/hide it.
---
Not too late at all.
---
Tons of people still leveling. Not even phase 2 yet.
---
Spend the whole 1-60 being a nub.. or easily go farm 100g in two/three hours once your 60..🧐
---
they don't get paid minimum wage. I used to work in Account Admin at Blizzard many years ago. I wasn't making amazing money, but it was nearly double minimum wage at the time. 
---
And OP's story doesn't check out for a lot of reasons. Power leveling appeals and investigations were some of the biggest and most frequent investigations performed in that department. Back in the day, with 10 million subscribers, how frequently do you think people went on vacation and played WoW? It was VERY frequently. Some folks would even go to China and play from there, but they would rarely get banned. Why? Because they look for details other than logging in from another country. For example, if you log into your account in the US, then 15 minutes later log in from China, it's a pretty good bet you wouldn't actually be able to fly from the US to China in 15 minutes. But that isn't all they look for. Stuff like an abnormal amount of mobs killed with maybe 3 quests completed to reach level 50, not saying a single word the entire time, logged in for huge chunks of time with no breaks (like 30 straight hours), sending gold gains to level 1 accounts tied to gold selling, etc. All usually while on an IP location dramatically different from the one the person usually plays from. There's more, and I'm sure in the many years since I've departed the company they have even better methods of detecting this kind of stuff, but this just gives you somewhat of an idea in how they can tell player habits that are far different from normal players to verify power leveling. And most investigations would take maybe 15 minutes to verify, maybe an hour for unclear cases, because Blizzard logs all sorts of information in a quite useful way.
---
It's super convenient that he has a passport photo, and perhaps an appeal will determine he was fine and clear... but I seriously doubt it based on what I've read and am super surprised so many people are eating it up.
---
Different goals I guess. I do dungeons for fun, and more bosses means more diversity and less repetition. If I get loot, that's nice of course, but it's not the only or main reason a lot of the time. And the more bosses you kill, the more gold you make (via shards or selling drops) in one dungeon, which is always a plus.
---
As far as I know there is nothing prohibiting it in the ToS. Killing quest NPC's will have penalties with phase 2 since you get dishonorable kills if you do that, which can lower your pvp rank. That's mostly for quest NPC's though. Guards are not affected and killing faction bosses even rewards you with honor points.
---
It sucks mages got that stigma. I am playing a mage because i was a holy priest in vanilla and I always had class regret and wished i had been a mage but never took the time to level one. I'm so happy I am a mage now. 
---
Honestly my favorite thing to do is to walk up to randoms and make them a few stacks of food and water and give them the int buff. It really seems to make people happy. I know food is expensive.
---
Same thing happens to me an I’m sure a lot of warriors. People will /who and just whisper out of the blue and often will get quite upset if your not eager to respond.
---
Definitely not!
---
His name looks like he was dedicaced to a long con since the beginning
---
Oof, I even felt that in my wallet
---
Leave your mom's basement, get a flight to Europe, try logging-in to your WoW accout to test these theories
---
So you guys 3 manned it. Nice.
---
The Dreadmist gang is real.
---
My experience has been almost universally positive on Dreadmist
---
Most streamers are. 99% of them give zero fucks about anyone except their ratings. Theyll fuck over anyone they can to get ahead. I still dont understand why people give real money to these people.
---
They're taking Pascal's wager while leveling in Azeroth lmao
---
It's never too late. The majority of players aren't even 60 yet. The economies are set yet. Epic mounts are super common yet.
---
Warlock still pwns you unfortunately - they've got a lot of HP later on even not counting the pet. And the felhunter can countspell your nature spells which is also a big problem. Meanwhile, the warlock puts his dots on you, and then just casts fear in your face until it goes off (even if you manage to earthshock the first one, the warlock can cast a new fear before you can earthshock again). And as a pet class, it can deal with grounding totem very easily.
---
Well cause mages and warlocks are super popular caster dps and priests are probably still the most common healer, and none of those guys want anything to do with anything phys classes can use.
---
WC - always go left. So long as you can think outside that long enough to navigate the first big fork and the jump from Verdan, you'll never be lost.
---
I was set in not playing until at least next phase when the playtime ended. 24hrs later felt like grinding a bit though... will see what's what again in 28 days.
---
Must beware is dishonorable kills when pvp phase hits
---
Keeping up your first aid is incredibly helpful on a drain tank build. If you manage it right and fight level appropriate mobs you should never have to eat/drink, just bandage every minute or so.
---
So did everyone else. It's an epic mount.
---
FYI Pallys can dispel mage snares also. Can drain mana pretty quick if you abuse it but there’s more in the cards than just BoF to close the gap
---
This thing is such a pain in the ass to get, but the best alternative (as a healer) is Burst of Power which is probably just as bad. I see so few BRD groups doing Flamelash.
---
Resistances are completely irrelevant, especially during leveling.
---
There are only hand full of boss encounters which require the tank or the whole raid to have resistance gear. Those raids aren't even live, yet.
---
!remindme 8 hours
---
I agree.  My guild is rushing the prebis grind and MC and there's already been a couple loot dramas.  There is also a logjam of people wanting to raid right now as we are a large guild that intends to have 2 raid teams eventually,  but are only running one right now.  Lots of people getting pissed and threatening quits about being benched for one week even after receiving bis loot last week.  It just doesnt make sense to me, especially when much of the current bis/prebis is going to be replaced by dire maul blues in p2 anyway.
---
Meanwhile, I'm in no rush to start raiding or gearing up.  The timeline is going to be about twice as long as most private server players are used to and there is going to be a lot of time between content releases compared to the compressed pserver timelines.  Instead my priority is getting 3 characters to 60 with their epic mounts before p2 hits and leveling/farming in 50-60 zones becomes impossible.  I'll start worrying about gearing them out in p2.
---
Theres another one wandering around east of the temple I just saw yesterday.
---
Do it for nostalgia!
---
That's why I'm taking it slower. I don't want to need to have to take a break. Well done though.
---
Perfect comment haha
---
120 horde is like 60 alliance.
---
I gotta leave this post I'm about to start crying and I dont even know why. RIP to your brother mate. For the Horde!
---
Hence my upcoming statement. I don't really believe him
---
Ive run WC probably 5-6 times now and I still have no idea how to navigate that place
---
Excessive corpse camping does fall under the act of griefing which is against the TOS.  Beyond that I’m not sure what qualifies you for “excessive”.  Overall thou, it’s safe to say if you know you’re just being a dick at that point, it’s probably time to pack up and go do something else.
---
Since streamers rarely if ever play outside of instances, there's no one to gank.
---
Jesus why do we keep having this question come up?
---
Everyone greeds. Its the same as a locked chest.
---
It has NEVER been different than that.
---
Oh shit that’s real dirty.
---
Yeah Naxx is super easy.  So is C'thun.  The reason so few people cleared these back in the day was because of how easy they were.
---
whats the addon that says hes leaving combat, id like that as a rogue.
---
First thing when I log on. Ask in trade for mage to conjure me full trade window of water, tip 1g. Both sides happy.
---
Uhhh, alts alts alts! Its part of the fun of the game.
---
I agree 100% that OP story does not add up at all. I would like to see the email between him and support
---
In fairness, it far too often occurs that the person is guilty and just trying to weave a sob story on reddit. Look at subreddits like runescape or Dota2 where people make posts hourly about "banned for botting but it was my little brother playing on my phone" or "banned for smurfing but this is my for fun account, im not even that toxic my behaviour score is 500 i promise" -- shitty people just want validation to try and get enough public backlash to have a CS miracle occur.
---
2-3 months isn't a long time at all. Takes years to max on OSRS
---
\* affect
---
Is that Un’goro crater? Don’t lie to us, you just wanted to mission impossible it off the cliff.
---
Big fear of mine.
---
You leveled a Priest healer, like most people who wanted to level a heal maybe because you heard they were the best or had easy access to some BiS's - but that led to a shortage of Shammy / Pally and esp Druids (overall).
---
I mean did  you not make any friends or regular groups while you were leveling up? Any groups you worked well with and enjoyed running with, you should try join up with them.
---
Not stupid at all! You can /click any button bound to a macro. For example, if you put "ManaBar" on MultiBarBottomLeftButton1", you could do: `/click MultiBarBottomLeftButton1` Or you can go crazy and check out the beginning of the "ManaBar" macro to see how I create secure buttons for the other macro's to bind to.
---
That said, its not really designed for it. I have a version of zm3 that shows/hides the bar based off your current form, but I stripped it because it felt confusing as a macro. A button you have to click each login to set a persistent UI state seems clunky, whereas the toggle feels natural as a macro... if that makes sense. You think you do, but you don't. ;) PM me and I could dig it up for ya
---
Woops, didn't see vocal in the title.
---
Right? He literally wrote about the PvP experience, which sounds way more exciting than anything I've seen on my PvP server.
---
While I enjoy leveling no way I'm doing alts till I'm at least dungeon geared.
---
&gt; so my card identified that as suspicious activity and denied me.
---
How the fuck is this acceptable, that you are doing something normal and they then denied you?
---
According to my brother, on Kromcrush Swifthistle was selling for like 16-30 Silver per piece a week or so ago. Before I transfered off of his server I sent him like 2 and a half stacks. He's been able to avoid buying any for himself as of yet.
---
Lol I was exhausted when I replied here not sure what was going on
---
What dungeons?
---
How is this in any way relevant to this discussion?
---
Its more than math, i duo oevel with my friend warrior meaning shadow is no good for both of us because if i shield my friend he gets rage starved , that means i jave to go out of shadowform to heal him, wich leads to shadowform beeing kinda useless at that point. But going spirt tap, inner focus and combat regen in disc and rest in holy makes us god tier combo both in pve , pvp and dungeons. Pve - i get  last hit for spirit tap and we have no downtime , pvp - warrior with pocket healer that can dispell magic and warr is 90% unstopable. Dungeons - lf3m dps for xyz and you can cherry pick the combo you want for specific dungeon.
---
E: if i was playing solo im 99% surr i would respec to shadow
---
Anyone who finds this or Asmon funny or entertaining... I would never want to associate with you in any aspect of life and I hope you’d feel the same about me
---
Drama is entertainment. This sub says they hate it, but it gets the upvotes!

&lt;Centrally Planned&gt; | Horde | Thalnos | 9:30-12:30 EST/6:30-9:30 PST (Tues/Thurs) | Semi-hardcore
---
Introduction: &lt;Centrally Planned&gt; was formed by a group of folks who met playing modern wow, enjoyed each other’s company, and found communist memes amusing (For real though we have a lot of liberals/leftists. You for sure don't have to be. But if you get triggered by the existence of the left, that might be an issue).
---
Raid Schedule: We will be raiding two nights a week 9:30-12:30 pm EST/6:30-9:30 pm PST on Tues and Thurs. Haven't fully decided between loot council and hybrid LC/DKP either way with focus on gearing tanks first.
---
Player Expectations: We are listed as semi-hardcore because we all have lives and know some accommodations must be made for that. The officer core is made up of people who are neither in high school nor unemployed with the ability to no-life and play 24/7. That said, we expect people to come prepared with consumables, arrive on time, and aim for 80%+ attendance.
---
The guild will be focused on the PvE content of the game but we are intentionally rolling on a PvP server as it is a pretty fun aspect of the game.
---
&gt;Recruiting:
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Hunters
---
&gt;Mages
---
&gt;Most things(DPS&gt;&gt;healers). Looking to round out the raid team. Could likely accommodate whatever (except we are flush with druids and tanks)
---
On Culture: &lt;Centrally Planned&gt; is centered around establishing a healthy and comical environment for those looking to progress through classic content with a semi-hardcore attitude focused on personal responsibility. We look to provide an inclusive atmosphere where homophobia, sexism, racism, and the like aren’t tolerated. You don’t need to have a bleeding heart, but if you can’t keep casual bigotry out of guild dealings, somewhere else would be a better fit.
---
If this sounds like a good fit, come say hey on our discord channel  https://discord.gg/vmC5sMb
---
Why the fuck is everyone on this website so passive aggressive? Just play what you want. You clearly aren't enjoying playing Druid so just switch. I love playing Druid and disagree with a lot of your points. Guess what? Taste is subjective!
---
"Food."
---
"How much are you gonna pay me for it?"
---
"WTF NO, just GIEF!"
---
"Then, I won't give you any"
---
"screw you!"
---
"Water you gonna do about it, huh?"
---
Yes, I just made up this strawmen situation just to make a pun.
---
"Man this guy's taking a wholloping."  
---
"Wait that's me."  
---
"Wait what's this circle I'm in?"  
---
\- Me whenever healing
---
I think my point was compromsing between both your positions. 1g is a bit steep to be honest, ill pay it, but ill also feel like the mage isnt really earning that extra 82s.
---
Which is why I look at it on averages, and why I allow a mage to be generous rather than just assuming they won't be, over the course of classic, i'll save a lot of gold.
---
I get the mentality, but im not going to charge people to open lockboxes, it just feels like a rip off, and when I played a mage, i'd port people for 30s.
---
The fact that you have to run the place at least 2 times to complete all the quests really irritates me.
---
there was a time when twitch wasn't as dogshit as youtube but that time passed a long time ago.  the biggest channels are supported by children and therefor cater to children
---
rofl
---
I have an addon that does /played and takes a screenshot every ding, along with one that removes the yellow messages Screen Captured and UI Hidden. Press Alt-Z again.
---
I'll link you them tonight
---
That's probably why, thanks.
---
WhT exactly makes this bow so good? The extra procs damage is hilariously low for me to even notice a difference
---
Undead start the closest to Brill. It's just north of the Undercity in Tirisfal Glades. One if the first bigger towns you go to as an undead.
---
It hurts because i have fallen there twice in a row accidentally 
---
Thankfully a warlock ported me back

I've always made it by just running.  Countless times... I swear I'm just going to post a video on here and ask where are the upvotes?
---
I think by stopping and looking you make it into a difficult thing.
---
Man, fuck ALL of these people. Fuck asmon, fuck his buddies, and fuck these derps that enable him.
---
Swords are 100% better until naxx. Brutality blade and viskag will out DPS any dagger rogue. I do agree that they are hard af to get tho.
---
G600 is larger than the Naga I believe. I use it because I have big hands and pianist fingers so it’s easier than having my fingers curled up like a claw half the time.
---
listening to the asmon stream right now, Asmon straight up defending this behavior.
---
This is such scummy piece of shit behavior. Fuck all of these guys.
---
If I'm in a group, I provide food/water when asked. If someone randomly in the world interrupts me for food/water, I charge them. Sure, the conjure food is free to make, but it's annoying to be in the middle of doing something to get asked if they could get food/water, especially when they open trade window like that is a failproof method of getting what they want lol.
---
They... screwed really hard up. I mean they went oom through spamming some **chain lightning** against a single target and went oom so they could heal eachother...
---
If I think about that: the mage in OP's post is maybe only the 3rd worst player I've ever seen...
---
Wow, alright ya.  That decides it for sure, 2-3 hours grinding for 2-6 of them.  Nope gold is much faster ty!
---
90% of greens are junk, 9% are actually good for someone and can be sold at a premium, but it takes a seller willing to spend the time in trade to do so and a buyer actually seeing the item and needing it at that moment.
---
1% of greens are BiS for a given level range but most likely will get vendored with other greens before they get treasured by someone.
---
You could easily make a BRD group and just not invite people who need the item you want, but that’s way more clumsy and disingenuous than just saying “HoJ is reserved”.
---
At least then, if you’re a warrior who has the item, or still want to come for other loot, you can still get the memo that there’s a spot for you in the group.
---
It’s a little ridiculous when people reserve practically everything on their BiS list, but an item that has a low drop rate is sensible to me at least.
---
Try VNC viewer
---
I have a lvl 19 toon that i play when i want to chill, this has nothing to do with classic.   
---
It's called proper human behavior and it's universal to all games and life.

#SHOCKING
---
Quin69, Twitch streamer and member of the party that was ninja looted, refuses Royson's apology and demands justice for *le Reddit!* 
---
He calls apology video **FAKE NEWS** and calls for Royson to be kicked *from all Olympus guilds on Faerlina!*
---
/shoo is my goto emote when I accidentally agro something
---
guess, that's another way to look at it :) we agree then
---
Not really. Stuff like this gets posted all the time to the front page of /r/wow and /r/classicwow has plenty of examples of in-game toxicity.
---
Nope, just don’t want to waste time if I don’t have to
---
Unfortunately, PvP servers have quite a few people that consider killing people who essentially can't fight back fun.  The best you can do is avoid the popular zones (like STV) and/or play as far away from prime time as possible, because ganking 60s don't want to wander around half a zone just to find one person to kill.  Other options are basically to farm dungeons or finding a small, out of the way place and just grinding.  That's just the unfortunate reality of being Alliance on most PvP servers.
---
Yeah, I can't really understand why Blizz is still letting the free transfers continue completely unrestricted. The Alliance's Trail of Tears off of Stalagg and Kirntonos is completely out of control. A shame Blizz has basically ruined most of the PVP servers already through just miserable population management.
---
Been having a blast playing a shaman, done a lot of dungeons but kind of feeling dungeoned out after running SM gy and lib probably 10x each. Where's a good place to grind a few quests and a level or 2?
---
I'm level 35 now, want to hit 37 and come back to armory and cath.
---
No, /u/PupperDogoDogoPupper, his message was still a no regardless of the preface to the overall statement.
---
What a fucking loser hahahaha
---
I appreciate players like you!! Always communicate
---
Somebody gave me 30g to unlock a lockbox. I'm guessing it was meant to be silver. Nice Tip!
---
&gt; This leads to the question: why was there never ever anything like BRD again?
---
Because although lots of players say they love the dungeon, tons of people hate running it.  Do I enjoy the idea, in theory, of this big massive sprawling dungeon with tons of ways you can explore it?  Yeah, probably.  But in practice?  Fuck that noise, man.  It takes forever.  I'm not looking to blitz a dungeon in 20 minutes.  But there's a happy medium there.  I hate BRD.
---
Yah not until naxx
---
I'm currently away from my computer so I can't be specific and it will also vary depending on the monitor too but I believe I'm running a *DETAILS* and *COLORS* filters and just play around with the sliders for Color, Sharpen, Clarity, HDR Toning, Exposure, and Bloom.  
---
I'm almost positive my settings are pretty mild for them all but it absolutely makes a huge difference. It removes the overall haziness/fogginess effect and makes the colors much more vibrant, along with just sharpening up everything. It also darkens up the blacks so super dark areas are harder to see but I actually really enjoy it. I find myself dropping searing totem sometimes just for it's lighting affect, it increases immersion a bit and I enjoy that.
---
&gt;The changes that got us to retail from classic took years. It was many small changes that eventually ruined the game for people who were begging for classic for years. Telling those passionate people to ignore proposed changes when they come up as they dont matter as individual changes is disingenious.
---
Ok between anyone who can open it, but in general engineers with explosive charge or a blacksmiths with an Arcanite Skeleton Key is very rare so for the sake of argument let's say there isn't one in the group.
---
Yep my group got him yesterday too
---
I meant until* MC, my bad.
---
Fury Prot Tanks are good MT2 or even MT1 when everyone is overstuff and you are rushing the raid.
---
I'm an Alliance warrior, and a couple weeks ago I was level 32, collecting tusks in STV to trade for the Whirlwind axe.  I was underleveled for the area, so I latched on to anyone LFG in chat.  When I was only a couple tusks away from finishing, a level ?? troll hunter starts throwing his pet (a cat, with the genius name of Cat) at our 5-man group after we finish a pull.  Occasionally, it would kill one of us, but most of the time we'd manage to kill Cat without losing anything but the food we weren't finished eating.  One time, when I was only one tusk away from getting out of the godforsaken jungle, we killed it with enough health to turn on the hunter, and we sent him on a corpse run.    
---
As far as the previously-neutral horde players in the area were concerned, peace was broken.  They killed us all.  The hunter respawned, and turned on the built-in griefing cheatcode known as Track Humanoids.  We couldn't spawn and escape, as the moment we spawned off the road, the NPCs would kill our underleveled selves.  Most of my group grew tired of this quickly, took the resurrection sickness, and chose to come back some other time.  Myself and one other warrior stuck around, as we were so close to finishing that one more troll could mean we're done.   
---
He never stopped.  We died over and over.  All we could do is try to spawn a little further away, but far enough from mobs that we wouldn't take durability damage on death.  I was about ready to log off, I was getting so mad, but through luck and persistence, I got the last troll tusk just before the hunter killed me yet another time.  I took the resurrection sickness and hearthed back to Stormwind.  I apologized to the other warrior, who was also just one tusk from completion, and explained I was on the brink of psychotic break.  He understood, and had a lucky stroke of his own as I was on my flight path to South Shore.  He whispered me, and we agreed to regroup at Cyclonian.  
---
I start running, planning on looking for more in Alterac while he does the same in South Shore.  When I arrive at the hermit, standing next to him is a cat, and a familiar level ?? troll hunter. I'm almost too impressed by his vendetta to be angry.  I tell my groupmate about it, and he tells the general chat about it, and a level 60 paladin parties up with us and melts the hunter for us, helps us both with Cyclonian, and melts the hunter again.  It was a good day.  
---
Gyyrados of the Tauren Tippers, thank you.  You are my hero.  Sorry for botching your name.

Let people play the game however they want. Everyone has their preference, limited time to play, objectives, etc.

Don't be such an entitled little kid. No one owes you anything. Now go cry to mommy. Tell on us for not "helping" you

my friends and guildies tip tho

but after the end of a good group ill throw down a free portal to org for any who wants

Just use Feign Death if you pull, problem solved.

I keep trying to do this but it resets and deletes my preset every time I load up WoW ☹️

thanks! super helpful

Well that went a totally different way.
---
I was camped by a UD Rogue, who I think was angry at life, either that or he was mad I was killing the skinable mobs in Un' Goro for a quest. Dude legit camped me all the way to the FP for Un Goro. The sad thing is as a 51 Warr I almost killed him everytime. Damn Riposte.

Wailing Caverns was, and still is, one of my favorite dungeons.

---
Word word I read it to fast and skipped over that gnome part. My bad lol... yeah now that’s completely understandable.. I have a group of friends all scattered over multiple servers and I told them if we all wanted to play together than we should just roll on a normal alliance server to do so because I’m by starting another horde anywhere
---
Thats my favourite soap opera.
---
Doesn't matter on the jump before Verdan.
---
The area is 100% cut off from the rest of WC so the pet cannot path anywhere. If you're out of combat it will simply clip to your position instantly, if you're in combat it will stand locked at the other end.
---
The jump down from Serpentis however does have a path, but there's no mobs there for the pet to pull (and it dismisses about halfway around) since you have to kill everything.
---
All in all, pet pulls aren't a big worry in WC. Thankfully.
---
Thanks I'll have to get details back up and running!
---
Damn im a new wow players and hell il try to find that place soon enough. Il also have a drink for the sake of it

Nah that rick and Morty meme, itll be a quick in and out.

I know where to go as well, but if you take a look at the top its actually a pretty tight area you need to land on. Jumping gives you a bit more distance so you can be a bit off, to run off the edge and land you need to be very precise. For people that only played in retail or just haven't done the jump much they should really stop and take a look. Seeing 4 other people just go for it, like us that just know where it is might make them think its an easy jump and not pay any attention.

Dont wanna do the famous wetlands run and be killed by alligators for 1 hour. Lazy bum. It's one of the most bonding experiences you can get, if you find a fellow to run with you xD

Right? What idiot is standing in the green stu-- oh.

Just a tip, if you follow the mushrooms they lead the way on where to go.

I hold duel tourneys there haha it's fantastic!

No, they clarified it was for being involved, whether *directly or indirectly* in a RMT. This can also mean that Blizzard suspects he bought a leveling service online and someone in an eastern European country leveled his character. 
---
He has freely suggested a CS rep can go nuts and come in here to expose his money laundering schemes, so go nuts.
---
No actual PvE rogue does this. And if you are pvping as a dagger rogue you don't even touch ambush. Not worth it in any way.
---
I did not mean to reply to you, sorry for that. I (tried) to reply to somebody else in the thread, I made a mistake. I thought somebody in the thread claiming that it was against the TOS without giving any evidence.
---
Buying every skill is the dumbest thing you can do while leveling.

Also waiting to fight those evil red dragons in stranglethorn with my demon hunter.

The entire game of WoW is a waste of time. Stop pretending like anything you're doing in it is of any importance to anyone.

Yeah theres like a shitton and most ppl dont know about it if you havent researched the spot or did the quest "Cuergo's Gold".

In all fairness you can walk off if you’re in the right spot of the jump. Granted, you’re like half a pixel from falling, but you can do it.

I don't necessarily want a mage, just anything but a rogue.

Start with sunken temple. 
---
The troll priests have a low drop rate on a really good healing piece. 
---
The drakes can also drop an amazing offhand, but it is a random stat piece.  If it rolls drakestone of healing, it’s like +40 healing, albeit no stats. 
---
You should also be looking for Stam gear (necropile) if you are on a pvp server. Preraid BIS gear is typically glass cannon gear that puts the majority of its item budget into Intel, spirit, and healing/spell power and lacks stam. 
---
You definitely want to be in BRD ASAP as a large portion of your BIS gear is there...
---
The hammer off the 7 dwarves (which can also drop off the relic coffee key chest mind you) combined with either a drakestone or the offhand off princess will work u til you get benediction.

I'm not saying I enjoy him one way or another I'm just saying it's ironic and incredibly hypocritical that in this thread people are simultaneously shitting on asmo for being too toxic while also out of nowhere calling him bad at dark souls.

Are you saying that to be a raidleader in WoW you have to be good at dark souls?  What does his Dark Souls ability have to do with anything?

Huh, interesting. Do you have nVidia overlay to automatically launch on game start up?

I have yet to run into an issue with my filters loading, when I first start up WoW it usually applies right at the login screen as I can see the filter be applied within a few seconds after launch.

To add on to this- I played a priest and couldn’t stand grouping while leveling. Spirit tap requires the last hit of the mob. I’d imagine if you’re able to burst down mobs hold your taunt for when your buddy mind blasts, let it run toward the priest and then taunt last second and drag it away. Taunt will end and the mob will go back to the priest, at this point it should be low hp. Let the priest boy wand it down while you go pull the next mob.  Just my 2 cents

Yup downranking to SWP R1 is GREAT for:

1. fishing for Blockout procs,

It's amazing the things that develop into such emotional memories. I'm sorry for your loss. Although I'm glad to hear you have this beautiful memory.
---
 I too am thankful. My grandfather was nearing the end of his life when I taught him how to control a computer, just well enough to start fishing in wow.(fishing was his favorite past time in life. He found fishing in game to be very enjoyable.) Honestly I think WoW extended his life out for quite a while because as he became more comfortable with moving around in the virtual world, he found new energy and happiness! Every day I'd come home from school, he would want to share everything he learned and saw. Haha he single handedly fished everything out the Great Sea and even leveled a character to 100 on his own.(on a pvp server no less) LOL I remember he would always search frantically for the  /wave button I made him, to everyone he met.. even NPCs he confused for players &lt;3). While I miss him so very much... Every time I'm cast a line out I think about him and I'm very thankful for those memories.

a lot of the unreleased areas are mostly graphically complete, which is the more difficult part of creating content. why was that hard to understand?

am not surprised

I'll have to check when I'm home, but I think it does. It does for every other game at least. It's weird because I made Nvidia presets for vanilla WoW servers back a year ago, and I never had an issue with deleting back then.
---
Most of the time your healer will be a priest, so all leather/mail/plate with int is yours. Soon enough you'd be able to heal properly yourself and start getting the cloth drops as well.

So I've been having a hard time moving away from Vuhdo because I really like the inbuilt clicking macros and color changing bars for dispels/disease. Additional, I really like that vuhdo has varying colors for health bars based on their HP as well as inbuilt buff indicators for renew and PW:S with a timer for weakened soul if PW:S is popped. Does Luna support most of these functions other than the click macros you mentioned? I do really want heal predictions.

You're failing to understand why we aren't talking about the damage in any of these comments.

Whirlwind Axe doesn't do whirlwind. Ravager does whirlwind and it's a chance on hit.

The catch up gear is not in the game yet.

Holy shiiiiit I completely forgot "Woot" was a thing back then.
---
./welcome seems more like welcoming a person into the area or party or whatever causes it’s phrased “Blahblah welcomes Blahblah.”
---
You are probably thinking of the Ravager axe that drops in SM armory. That has a "Chance on Hit" effect that will spin your character in a whirlwind. The Whirlwind axe has no such effect.

Was there a nearby vendor/mailbox you ran to when your bags were full, or did you just delete random greys until you were full on specific valuable stuff? I've been massacring Quillboar to try to get the Deviate Delight recipe, and wish Ratchet was a little closer.

None of these, because I don’t trust banks that auctions that operate out of primitive mud huts.
---
For the Alliance!
---
&gt; which is only due to the fact that you have likely yet to do 50 runs to not see this item drop haha 
---
Thats where you and everyone else seems to be assuming a lot here. I'm lvl 59, and I've done BRD since 52, now I haven't kept track of how many runs I've done, but considering its all I've done to level from that point trying to get BIS gear, it's a heck of a lot. So I understand, as I'm still trying for Second Wind currently. The difference is I don't think of myself as more or less deserving of a drop just because I'm a higher level.
---
A because it's a straight line from the mailbox.

Imagine playing on faerlina, I never hated streamers, but they sure are making classic a lot more toxic then it was.

Impeach Thrall.  That guy’s a sissy and he takes yellow showers.

Except it's not.  There was a near riot among many classic players over the ClassicLFG addon.

Cross realm makes LFD significantly better, especially for lower pop servers.   It also significantly helps content not get get gated via the community like needless gear checks (this was absolute cancer in wrath, everyone wanted you to overgear everything), new players that don't know anyone yet, etc.   Running to the dungeon is just a waste of time.   If the world doesn't feel real, well that completely on you because you're sitting in cities not doing any questing/gathering/wpvp/etc at all.  I spent the time waiting in queue out in the world. All the instant teleport did was make it like every group had a lock.

In the larger section of the dungeon, just keep hanging to the left passage ways and you'll hit all the bosses.

Priest lvling with a friend who is warrior...  We are having a surprising amount of trouble filling DPS as of BFD and lower.  I hope it gets better later on.  Finding a heal/tank on my lock always took forever, and I was kind of hoping to have an easy go of it now that all I need is dps...

Simply because fights last longer after MC, you can only use so many mana pots lol

Just curious, is it mandatory we censor the offender’s name? Or is it ok to post with name on reddit?
---
Classic is built around the limitations it puts on characters. Finding what you can't do, and working around it, is a huge part of the game IMO. It makes classes feel unique, it makes specs feel unique. When you spec for power infusion, it makes your disc priest feel awesome. When you get shadowform, it feels like a huge part of your character. It means you have to put serious thought into how you spec out your character, because the alternative is spamming 50g respec fees.
---
Adding dual spec wouldn't ruin the game, but it's the absolute antithesis of why I like classic over retail. If they add it, then that's the biggest red flag they could throw up to me.
---
They all are coming to heartseeker to ruin it now. Heartseeker is now high pop, with a huge divide between horde &amp; alliance.
---
Or maybe he used a power levelling service. That actually is more likely, considering you had no problems.
---
Some internet camgirl started selling out her bathwater to horny teenagers. Turns out the water was tested and there isn't a single skin cell in it, too, so she just put soap in water in a jar and sold it. Whole story blew up because it was absurdly stupid on so many levels... That's it
---
I used to have an addon in vanilla that constantly updated a list of the health bars of the people in a raid and ordered them by least amount of health to most. You could click on that list and it would automatically heal that person with the best heal so as to not over heal. I used to lead the the healing meters by always clicking on the second person on the list, because I knew everyone else would be healing the first person on the list, so it was less likely for me to overheal.
---
There was even a one button decurse addon. You would just need to click one button and it would automatically dispel anyone in the raid that needed it.
---
But as others have said, these kinds of addons are no longer possible. They actually broke them sometime during vanilla. I remember a lot of guilds had a hard time clearing content they had on farm directly after the change.

I'd suggesting going for robes of the archmage. It's a BiS chest piece until phase 4. Epic mount is nice, but not really needed till phase 2 drops.

Those really are some op threads at lvl 32

yeah me too, but people give limited  bag space as a reason to not bother and I kinda agree. even with a bunch of bank alts, there is only so much free bag space and lots of more important things to stockpile.
---
the problem is these claws only stack 5
---
This is the best advice I’ve seen, as someone who plays a rogue. Against warriors i only really have trouble when they get a few big hits on me quickly or I don’t cc them for long enough. In this case hamstrings and bleeds are crucial to keep me in range and out of stealth. I think it’s a race that the warrior has to try to win with big damage and then countermeasures against escape.
---
Your third tip is good.  I don't believe that trying to maximize your use of vendor discounts is going to matter at all.  In the time it takes you to travel to a vendor that gives you a discount you could just grind out vendor trash equal to the discount.
---
The real tips are:
---
1. Get Vendor price and use it to pick the most valuable reward from quests that don't give you a gear upgrade.
---
2. Use Vendor price when you're out of bagspace to delete those items that are worth the least.
---
3. Starting at level 36, only buy skills that you use to save money.
---
4. Kill cats/wolves excessively in STV and Badlands for their great vendor trash.
---
5. Don't specifically grind for your mount, you'll make more than enough via normal questing and should have it at 43 or so.
---
It's been known to happen.
---
WW axe is the name of it, it doesnt have any sort of proc or special ability. It is just a big axe.
---
Its a precedent thats been set before by multiple other high end MMOs, and i thought ive heard of it occuring before on retail. For example, i know on GW2 if you buy something off the auction house with RMT gold and your account gets flagged, they take the gold from whoever you purchased from and depending on how much gold it is (if substantial enough) will potentially ban whoever you bought from as well for "circulating RMT gold"
---
Even rolling items?
---
Need to look up this addon later for me
---
PS. Who won the swords
---
Force of habit means I go to the one with the smallest crowd. Not only does it give the other riff raff a chance of viewing my dapper auctioneer outfit but it also makes it less likely there'll be an infernal summoned right next to me.
---
I'm no mage, but here is some advice:
---
If you pull mobs on accident it could be you got too close to their aggro range. Happens all the time. Any case you run straight to the tank, use your aoe snares so they stop chasing and refocus your attacks onto a target attacking the tank. Best practice is to always wait for tank to get some aggro first then start dps. Avoid aoe unless you see tank use thunderclap.
---
Another useful mage tool is polymorph. Discuss with your group early on to state you will poly a target if needed and get the tank to mark desired poly mob. That way damage is avoided on that target.
---
Also, if you need something, need on it. Just because you scuffed a few pulls and they got mad is no reason for you to miss out on gear.
---
Hopefully this helps and don't let this experience keep you from dungeons. Practice makes perfect!
---
*tink....tink*
---
You could make more by skipping those bosses and doing the run 2x so people can get gear, most people go to dungeons for gear or money.
---
Not while playing WoW, I have to VPN into some networks to access HPC. I only do that from Ubuntu, and WoW is on my Windows drive.
---
I will drink there tonight on deviate d as well 🤙🏻
---
It's not a fallacy when you have a literal direct comparison you can make, like retail. Listening to people who whined and wanted QoL improvements was how we got flying mounts in every zone, dungeon finder, raid finder, talent trees removed, and dual spec. We're against adding those things because once you open up that *some* QoL features can be added, then there's no restriction on what other ones can be added.
---
&gt;To not be pigeonholed into a specific role and being massively gimped to do anything else is a poor excuse for a good sink
---
That's literally what gold sinks are for, what are you talking about? What do you think flight masters, consumables, class trainers are? You can't play the game *at all* if you don's use those, respeccing in comparison is extremely optional.
---
Get a good wand, it makes a big difference. You can use a 17dps wand at 13 from memory. Try running RFC to pick up some more gear as well, if you have a main that can help with finding buying some gear off AH can make a difference too.
---
I dont think i took the stealth talent, so its at least nice to have the +1 from being a nelf.
---
It did kind of seem like things were better than on my non-nelf rogue, but ive also been questing more in areas with mobs a level or two below me (if not more), so maybe thats why things have been better.
---
Most people ive found seemed to agree it was common courtesy for the group to finish together, not to have people drop in and out as they see fit. If im just making things easier for you and youre not willing to help me too, why do i group with you at all?
---
I dont think those people are assholes i just think its a shitty mentality to play the game under and it spits in the face of this "community" so many profess to love
---
Honestly, doing dungeons with my guild and we accidentally pull one or two many packs by accident, living to tell the tale. I'm looking at you Scholo and Strat UD...
---
Mission succeeded failfully?
---
I think the only thing that wasn't named Xcleave was Shadowmourne.
---
Oh, wait, the proc is a huge buff that eventually maxes out and sets off a massive AoE.
---
I usually started a fight with Mind Blast, would immediately drop SW:P on them, then maybe a Smite before I pop bubble and wand them to death. Sometimes a second Mind Blast if the mob still has a good amount of HP left. Especially earlier on it's important to only pull one mob, but by 20 it should be significantly easier since you'll have 5 points into the wand talent and 5 into spirit tap. 10-20 is probably the most annoying part of the grind.
---
I tuned into his stream last night after watching the clip. He had like 100 viewers and about 80 of them there just harassing him

Could have just said "I'd rather increase my chances of getting it and not roll against anyone" which is unrealistic as a rogue but whatever. It's really not that hard to be a decent person.

I was idling in Gadgetzan while looking for a ZF group, but there wasn't much going on at the time. It is at this point that I'm ganked by a hunter 3 levels my senior and his priest friend who are apparently camping the arena rooftop, out of reach of the guards. I report them for the exploit, but that shit's annoying and I've got time to kill.
---
Following a Rogue who's been trying to reach them (and falling into freezing traps the hunter had left in the path), I climb up, fearbomb them, and MC both of them off the roof and into the awaiting guards. 
---
Turns out the hunter didn't like that, cause he attempted to gank me no less than six more times only to find that he couldn't beat PWS before I got my cast off. Meanwhile, my rooftop was accumulating an ever-fluctuating compliment of rogues who swarmed about me like invisible sharks.
---
The pair eventually returned to their bannable perch after I and my new rogue friends went our separate ways, but visualizing his reaction as he was helplessly shooed off the roof in such a passive-aggressive way continues to delight me.
---
Adding a modifier to to the berserker stance part will make it so it won't go off automatically, but still be easy to activate.
---
For example:
---
\#showtooltip Charge   
---
/use [mod:ctrl]Defensive Stance;[mod:shift]Berserker Stance;Battle Stance;[stance:1,nocombat]Charge;[stance:3,combat]Intercept
---
Added a modifier for defensive stance just to be efficient. Moved around some of the combat flags. Battle stance will only activate with no modifier. Making it useful in combat as well as out of combat.

It may be 2005 WoW, but it's still 2019 Blizzard CS.

&gt;Pretty sure thats actually not illegal, at least in most places. Consumer right is that you have access to the game files, which you still do -- paying the subscription is simply renting access to the live servers. Similar to a gym membership, if you break the rulee they can ban you from the premisis whenever they see fit.
---
It's illegal because, illegal essentially means against the law. So when the TOS is against the law, it is illegal. And I would say so that they can terminate your contract, depends of course which rules and circumstances, but if they wrongfully did so you can be compensated for that.
---
I ran my mage in MC as a frost glass cannon. It's difficult to remember the specific numbers, but I recall another mage having something like 11k mana and I was down at maybe 5k. I would go oom several times in a boss fight. 2 pots, a demon rune, Mana crystal, evoke, and plenty of wanding were the norm.
---
Any Mana you have left after a fight is damage that you didn't do.
---
This time around everyone wants to AOE instance, Melee or spellcleave groups are thing and IMO they are a complete Joke. Warriors and Mages are the new huntards. Mages just wanna AOE and Tanks really don't know how to tank and wanna do it with a 2H over sword and shield... lol If you are new thats okay too :) everyone needs to start somewhere right?
---
My tip. Wait a few seconds for tanks to get aggro. Tanking is not an easy thing to do. So wait, Give him time to get rage and a fe sunders on then go nuts. AOE is never really ideal in instances. Because well back then AOE tanking didn't really exist  It was all CC (Sheep, Sap, Trap ETC) and groups were built around CC not this AOE garbage people are doing today.. So unless its a SpellCleave group you are part of just slow down on the DPS and stay in the back. you are a caster after all. Fuck what other people are saying lol if you do somehow manage to pull aggro Frost nova and blink. If you are almost gunna die? Just ice Block. Not a whole lot to it.
---
Tanks should have the aggro and To me it seems the healer wasn't the best either if he can't heal through an accidental pull of another group or letting you die if you pull'd a silly 2 extra mobs lol. 
---
I wouldn't put all this blame on you. It happens.
---
This guy looks like the Wal-Mart version of Dr. Disrespect.
---
he would pull a big pack and run to the one specific spot on the boat that would make all mobs run down and unable to attack
---
There are mages that respond to requests with "Just open trade if you need, like always"
---
Like...no, not like always.  It's okay to use words to not create weird expectations that a lot of the playerbase won't know about.
---
Those mages are trolling the rest of you.
---
Really nice in WPL too.
---
People need to be spoonfed content nowadays. So sad to see.

Definitely seen a bit of both.  Was doing the Maw Panthers in STV with a guy when a third alliance person showed up seemingly interested in doing them too, so we invited.  They joined and ran around for a minute before saying they needed the named panther boss, not the maw panthers.  We said we're on the step before the boss but were happy to show her the correct area for the boss and help kill it.  So we went over, killed it for her then went back to finishing our panthers.  She said she wanted to kill the raptor boss now - we said we weren't ready for it - still on the previous step in that quest, and obviously we're still killing panthers for the other quest we interrupted to help her with the panther boss.  She said OK she's going to do the raptor boss, and disbands.  Not so much as a thank you from her.  Whatever - no biggy.  We finish up the panthers after another 10 minutes and she proceeds to begin whispering both of us asking if we're ready to kill the raptor boss yet, and to not forget to invite her when we're ready because she needs to finish the quest...
---
when did you work there? i ask because i'm wondering if it was before or after activision buying them out. i've found CS (as with a lot of things) has been going downhill since then and wondering if maybe things have changed since you worked there?

Are you insane?  250-300 on Mooncloth would take 200 days.  I know most of us would like to make our robes and whatnot BEFORE they're obsolete.
---
In general: 
---
Dismiss your pet before jumping off of something to get to a lower level of the
---
Give the tank a few seconds to build aggro before you attack. This is something you may have a feel for already from having your pet tank quest mobs in the world. If you pull threat, feign death. 
---
Be aware of your surroundings. Some mobs in dungeons patrol around, and if you aren’t paying attention, you could accidentally pull them and wipe your group.

Ooh it does?...did not know that.
---
How does that work exactly? how does a trade window being open prevent the other guy from needing it?
---
so they suck at rp? trolls have a deep hatred for all other races, why would they be friendly?
---
I'd rather do 10 different bosses then do the same 5 bosses 2 times or worse skip everything but 2 bosses and repeat that 5 times. Constant repetition makes stuff boring, variety is more fun.
---
Unless they ask specifically for 35 water and I just dinged 40. I don't mind making it, but I am hoping for a tip and will accept it if I get one. If I don't well... that's life, I aint mad. But definitely think its nicer to tip when someone spent the time to make the water.
---
And the rest aren't eh? Everyone's pinging!
---
How dare somebody engage with a hypothetical when it comes up in a way that's not agreement.
---
Yes, it's just trolling.
---
And I do get it.  The guy is just expressing he'd like to have that.  Not he thinks it should be in the game necessarily.  But there are plenty of people who are wondering "Well why not."  So delving into those reasons is important.  And this thread of hypotheticals on an online forum meant to foster discussion, is a perfect place to get into that.
---
Thats where I disagree with you.  You seem to want these people to not bother bringing it up or commenting when it's something they are passionate about.  Because hey it's not a real proposal, it's just a 4 fun discussion.
---
I do agree they may have made the point in ineffective or caustic ways.  But whatever, just ignore them and move on.
---
Shoulda taken my own advice.
---
So probably I was feared then coiled? It seemed forever, actually pretty ridiculous amount of time haha
---
If you're looking for serious raiding, you will need Luna unit frames because it communicates incoming heals to other raid members using the same (or compatible) addon, which helps minimize overhealing.
---
Otherwise any raid frames addon will do. Default ones are perfectly usable in retail but in classic you can have up to 8 groups which makes the frame far too wide as there doesn't seem to be an option to wrap into a second row.
---
You can use Clique in combination with any frames addon if you prefer click casting (Vuhdo has that built in), or set up mouseover macros for every ability if you prefer having the same keybinds for solo play. I have a lot of macros like these:
---
    /cast [@player,mod:alt][@mouseover,help][] Renew
---
You could have finished him, he was half health or less
---
You would do it for yourself because at a certain point you are a useless piece of cloth without mana. So you would upgrade the waters like you would upgrade your main school damage spell. Your argument is moot.
---
Killing him sure would make it hard to cheat.
---
Please delete /train
---
Loot rules can be set up so that everyone in the group is there for something they need. I'm not sure how you find it irrelevant.
---
You're being deliberately obtuse about the matter.
---
You either A.) have a choice to have a tank at that moment or B.) no tank
---
You don't lose anything in either scenario, yet you claim "The entire concept is a declaration by the person that they don't care about any one else's time."
---
It's also silly to pretend that the 50 rogue who stepped into BRD for the first time should be on equal ground with a 60 tank who's only there for that item and is making it quicker and easier for the rest.
---
Bruh we got so much utility it's crazy so always try to make the most out of it. Having Rank 1 Frostbolt is really good for a quick slow it's the same at all levels. If you want to learn more about mage PVP I suggest watching Xaryu on YT guy is an amazing mage PVPer.
---
It actually makes sense being so close to zeppelins and undercity... I was a fool all this time..
---
I did this as a Horde priest to two Alliance players when I was questing in the yeti caves in Hillsbrad. 
---
I emoted /wait to the level 30 (I forget what class) and to my surprise they did (most people don't and just flee or start attacking lol) so I MC'd and buffed them. 
---
The level ?? rogue they were with then went /gasp and /pointed at me and sat down next to me but they were too high level for me to MC, so I stood in front of them, showed them my failed cast and /cried. It was a surprisingly wholesome interaction in an area which is usually gank city.
---
A few things:
---
Warrior and druid tanks both start the fight with empty resource bars. They need a moment to get rage to work with. So you always need to wait some seconds before you start dealing damage, otherwise your tank hasn't had a chance to build any threat.
---
Some tanks will mark a skull on the first target every pull, but not all. An option is to use "Target of target" to attack the mob your tank is focusing on. You can either enable target of target for your unitframes (it's available in the standard UI), or set a hotkey to do it.
---
So at the start of the pull: get the right target (the one tank focuses on), wait 3\~5 seconds, then load in with single target damage.
---
That's the safe approach.
---
Next: about pulling stuff.  
---
Be mindful of your level. Lower levels aggro mobs from further away.  
---
Don't use &lt;tab&gt; to target in dungeons, click them manually.
---
About AOE ... if it's a dedicated AOE group (warlock + 3 mages or such), then it's a good idea. If not, you're just making it take longer to reduce the number of active mobs. There will be packs of non-elites now and then, those are typically fine to AOE.
---
Huh, I've been playing on the EU servers from NA for years with no issues (friend in the EU that plays).
---
I have jump bound to space as well!
---
That seems like a reasonable response. It's not like horde players and alliance players are that different.
---
I've seen it way too many times on /r/2007scape to not believe it here.
---
Your delusional assumption is not reflective of reality.  There is no difference between the horde and ally for this purpose.  Whatever events led you to saying this would have probably brought you to the same conclusion vice versa.
---
It's sad that people consider the shitty attitude and persona he puts on as entertainment.
---
I expected the numbers to be impressive, but never expected 4.5mil. We're most likely bigger than retail by far now :D
---
I was just going to say that’s the closest thing to get that isn’t dependent on RNG lol.
---
This is why they moved to the mote/primal system for crafting reagents in TBC/Wrath.
---
Count yourself lucky. I ended up getting multiple Formula: Enchant Herbalisms but would have gladly traded that for that stupid missive.
---
I also think they are in higher demand, the epic mage robe needs 10 of each if I am not mistaken and lots more people want to make that compared to 2005.  In general people minmax more, so everything at the 'max' range will spike in price.

Epic mount is good for world PvP. You have a massive advantage over anyone with a 60% speed mount.
---
I like when  im told  to fuck off and get ignored when  i offer 50s for 6 stacks of water. Then the  next mage gives me 10 for free  with a  portasl and a foot massage.
---
But if you breach your contract and the guidelines laid out by the service provider, akin to a ToS/EULA, any service provider can rightfully hold the right to terminate access to a service if you dont follow their guidelines. It may not be MORALLY right, but its certainly not illegal for a service provider to terminate said service if you breach their terms.

yes, its a whole addon pack.. like everything in it. we rogues had the swords already, so the warrior got them :P

https://www.wowclassiccountdown.com/content_plan_pve_and_pvp/

That's the content plan, basically if you are on a pvp server, phase 2 is where world pvp becomes a lot more intense. If you are on a PVE server, nto really needed until phase 3 if you are interested in doing battlegrounds.
---
Gearing is more important right now, and mount can wait. Most people won't have their mounts for a very long time.
---
The anti decay is the plus 1 in rage. I know what the talent does. Were talking about it not mattering as much if you execute a lot. Thats it. If you execute a lot the only thing the talent would do is provide the plus 1 in rage while in combat which is still nice.

Seriously, everyone ITT is illiterate apparantely.

Their phone number is no longer listed on the website, so I called the old 1-800 number that was printed in the paper wow manual that came with the original game. It just plays a recording that tells you to get support through the website then hangs up. OP will have to keep submitting tickets.

why is this deleted?
---
My best friend practically begged me to play vanilla WoW.  I resisted him for about a month and finally caved.  We originally rolled Alliance to level 15 but ended up rerolling Horde on Frostmane.
---
We lived in opposite corners of the country.  Me in Seattle and him in Orlando.  We would stay up on weekends until the wee hours of the next morning talking in Ventrilo. We would do dungeons and quests all the while talking shit to each othet and drinking beers.  Eventually more friends would join us. 
---
My first true introduction to PvP was with him in Darkshire.  A lot of my WoW firsts was with him.  By the time Burning Crusade, his play time started falling off and eventually quit the game altogether before WotLK.
---
I kept playing until Warlords.  Everyone I knew in game had quit playing by then and I just found WoW boring by then.
---
My buddy eventually ended up being diagnosed with stage 4 glioblastoma in 2015.  Brain cancer.  He passed away a year later.
---
I still think of him a lot.  I started playing Classic Wow and a lot of my memories of him came flooding back.  It is both happy and sad.  Hearing the music in particular zones or starting particular quests.  I miss him.
---
Ancestors watch over you.
---
We shall meet again.
---
And my time? Guess you did read all of my argument lol. I give water and food to group people for free, but random people that open up trade with me, I ask for a tip :) 25s or something.
---
Breaking the Beer casks in the storage rooms.
---
Anticipation is 100% worthless in pvp.
---
It sucks when it happens, I've been on ends of the spectrum. just think you made someone happy and consider it your good deed for the day.
---
At the end of the day, it's just a game, don't take it too seriously :)
---
You are in the minority, I have fun in dungeons and like doing bosses I guess, most are just a reskinned normal mob, but I for one aint seeing tanks and healers lining up to do dungeons for "fun."
---
&gt;I don't even think it's possible to hold threat as full prot against the current meta to wait for you to charge in before they dps.
---
That was kind of what raids had to do in vanillla. Had to wait like 10ish seconds for the warrior to build aggro before everyone else started to dps.
---
Yes in phase 2. They specifically stated that they won't move to phase 2 until they removed layering
---
ho i know i wasnt knocking it, just that i would really like to see it done perfectly.
---
Stranglethorn Vale or Arathi Highlands or Dustwallow Marsh should get you there. Also Shimmering Flats in southern Thousand Needles (Mirage Raceway). 
---
I recommend questing STV and/or Shimmering Flats during off hours, though.
---
&gt;In most situations though, where a PvP solution does exist, we generally do not become involved.
---
Again, this is the lawyer words right here, this is how the get away with doing nothing as there is always a pvp solution, kill them
---
He doesnt. That mindsets rly toxic. Enhance shaman is fine in raids and ele is fantastic in pvp. If you dont want to heal on your shaman dont join a guild that requires you to max min your characters in pve and actually enjoy the game.
---
Meme specs can still finish all content. Its just elitists wont let you into "top" guilds
---
This wannabe bro turd is why I always wait for everyone else to roll or just roll need
---
They're bis for warlocks during the first two phases.
---
Is that because half of the alliance don't pvp?
---
I completely misunderstood you then haha, sorry mate
---
imagine sending death threats and telling someone their a waste of oxygen over some shitty ass boe. You retards are just as bad as royson.
---
Because he is demanding way more than he should, not to mention he just admitted to trying to exploit them later on. He can't hold himself "we want him kicked or we go to war", it's really childish.
---
Lol u pay them like 12 Euros per month and they still dare to piss u off I hate this company tbh
---
I got it on my second kill and wondered why it said "Elite."

By the next quest I learned lol

This is the worst dungeon I have ever had in my life, oh god I loathed for this thing to get completed and the quests be done.

This dungeon is still fearful for me.

Not really, it won’t be replaced until Cath
---
YOU JUST SAID YOU UNDERSTOOD THE TALENT. IT DOES THE SAME THING, ALL THE TIME.
---
It gives you 1 rage every 3 seconds.
---
In combat.
---
Out of combat.
---
Around combat.
---
NO MATTER WHAT IT DOES THE SAME THING ALL THE TIME.
---
&gt;meme spec
---
More specifically, this stems from most people's experience in Vanilla and even carried over into early BC - early on certain specs just didn't 'work' their tier sets didn't fit the roles, and they generally were MUCH worse than any pure class of that role and gearing them wasn't as clearcut (stacking +hit and +crit doesn't work for SPrs for example). I saw this a lot when I rolled a S.Prs to raid in launch of BC with my friends, the ones in end game progression at the time gave me the same shit just due to their experience with the offspec class at the time.
---
That being said, there's been very dedicated players playing these specialize class role over the years trying to maximize the class either through gearing, playstyle, or consumables. So a bad player not knowing how to gear properly or unwilling to use the right consumables will do horridly when compared to other 'pure' classes.
---
Like for example OOMkins is called that for a reason, SPriests also shine in P1 since he fights are so much shorter along with gear scaling not working in our class' favor (more +hit, +crit generally doesn't boost our damage that much.) Don't worry, later on, esp by end of BWL or Naxx, S.Prs will off he DPS rankings.
---
the defending horde could have popped their light of elune. the playing field was equal.
---
Yeah if I can make like half a g off an item at ah it’s really not worth after the ah fee

That was epic thx for sharing the link

hey you found a devilsaur, i've been riding around un'goro for days and yet to see one. God damned Fairbanks farmed to shit
---
Nah, I'll keep it for phase2-3, will def. sell for more than 70s though haha
---
Still not agreeing. If you're not dungeon farming, you cut down 1/6 of your leveling time. A simplified calculation: If your time from 40 to mount obtained is 12 hours played, anything short of 4 hrs invested time in getting your mount is time well invested. Druids and hunters excluded.
---
&gt;  It's usually patterns like logging in from the US, then a login in Europe minutes later (something that would be impossible to accomplish from simple travel).
---
Anyone can accomplish this without leaving their 399$ chair. Just use a VPN.
---
The market is flooded right now, you're better off hanging on to a lot of things like herbs for a couple months when people alt out and need to re-do professions or just get lazier.
---
“I’m having a moment” did you really say that to your wife lol.

Lucky lucky woman

I don't see any great leadership showcased here.

just a bunch of random clips, with 1 pvp battle in BRM where almost no leading is shown.  
---
you can do better Grizzly, at least in the video editing.......
---
Yeah... now to farm it back lol
---
AoE meta is not raising the skill cap, but the skill floor.
---
It makes it harder for the tank do his job, not allows the tank to do his job better with more skill.
---
Idk 300g for a trinket you’ll never use. Just not worth it

Oh shit, I did this on beta and forgot to on release...

Take control of your pet as hunter and run around using /bark at people :)

Aaaaaah math... 2 hours
---
Yeah.. I don’t really care for the fire protect pots; with aura sittin at a fat 195 resist. Those Oil of Immolation  and Chili combo however.. mmmmh, I’ll buy those alll day long
---
I've thought of that. But they usually run up and summon it right away. They usually dont stick around either so I dont think it's to push me off the mobs. But I've recorded how many whelps I can kill and hour- 214- and I've recorded my sessions, always farm for 2 hours at a time cause I get burnt out. I've done 8 sessions so that comes out to be over 3200 whelps and the drop rate is supposed to be 1 in a 1000.
---
Also only post on weeknights and weekends for your most profit. During the day shit just sits
---
So he's got 4x the viewership he would have otherwise, assuming the people not ragging on him were with the stream before his ninja episode.  With as short and selective as our memories are in a couple weeks those views could turn into legit fans.  I think the more stink we raise about this the more popular he's going to be.  Remember that live stream guy a year or so ago who was just a total asshole and people would watch him because of that?
---
I went 20 levels without stealth lol. Its just not worth it until cheap shot IMO. Also moves way too slow.
---
Is it common for enchanters to provide the mats themselves and then look at AH to see what to charge (or even knowing how much something would approx cost)? 
---
Or is it more common that you just ask to provide the mats?
---
It also depends on your role. Healers can heal well above their level.
---
&gt;  The Alliance's Trail of Tears off of Stalagg and Kirntonos

lmfao
---
At 36 I didnt buy an new spells.  I didnt have professions.  Quested using guidelime.  Didnt spend alot of time grinding.  Vendored all items but cloth and food.  Chose the best item from rewards to vendor.
---
I did spend 2 gold for whirlwind axe mats.
---
I hit 90g at level39, almost 40.
---
I'm a firm believer in only having one main at 60. I'd rather grind Timbermaw rep than start a second character.
---
The text in game has a bit of a nod and wink to it, but Zug zug.
---
We're in an awkward phase where most people have outleveled the lower-mid dungeons, but most people still aren't 60, so most alts, if they exist, are gonna be on the low end, maybe being able to do DM/Stock or WC/SFK but not much more.
---
Wait until you get to BRD, theres some confusing pathways alright
---
Simple explanation is that every 1.5 seconds (it's less because of your quiver attack speed bonus) you'll fire off one autoshot. If you cast aimed shot between those, you'll have fired less autoshots in total due to that cast time. If your weapon was a 3.0 speed for example, you'll miss out on less.
---
That's really it. Even if you're not using aimed shot, firing off any instant global will delay the autoshot animation if you clip it too close to the end. It's just harder to be precise with those shots in order not to screw it up from time to time.
---
If you're only autoattacking, and at 38, you're probably BM and might not even have aimed shot yet, you'll notice an overall kill speed increase, but with that fast of an attack speed, you'll be buying ammo more often too.
---
I don't plan on doing organized pvp until I am lvl 60 and then I will immediately buy the epic mount
---
Nice! Thanks!
---
Statistically, that still has to be a few hundred thousand people every year. I've been in Switzerland for the last few weeks and haven't had any problems.
---
How do you see the players level/race/class?
---
Dying in the lava is the funniest and worst in particular when you rez and range can still hit you. But it makes for great memories!
---
Don’t remember if whistles and choo-choos are audible or not, but the emote certainly shows up in chat log. Flash back to myself as a lv52 lock solo grinding azshara and seeing a human rogue /grin at me. Then he opened and tried to stun lock but my succ held him down and I nuked him with 2 shadow bolt and shadow burn crits. I made sure to /grin before the last sb hit. This happened 3x in a row.
---
Incorrect, as a tank, speed running UBRS with guild, I’ll chug 2-3 stacks a day
---
In mc all your going to be casting is frost spells most mobs are immune to fire
---
Honestly unless it has an on-use effect, very very few people would be interested in this item. Transmog isn't popular in classic.
---
Swamp of sorrows Jaguars, grey loot and skinning to vendor, leveled 37-40 doing this and got my mount.  Started with maybe 20g.
---
I don't agree, but I understand where you're coming from. Throwing it into an already existing platform with zero thought to it would be nonsense.
---
But If I were to design an mmo I would do it from the ground up with a plan like that in place where everyone playing knew from the start that would be the case and it would rely on a couple of systems. One hand you need a grandfathering system that allowed your past achivements to be visible or even impactful in the next season, and you'd need the seasonal updates to be refreshing enough that people would be interested in what's changed.
---
It would be great from my perspective, an amazing time for new players to start playing, Instead of everyone being stacked at level 60 with no one to play with while leveling. Plus the absolute pinnacle of the WoW experience is the open world leveling experience during the early months of release.
---
But different strokes, absolutely.
---
It is your responsibility. The same way warlocks must always have at least a bag filled with shards for impromptu TPs. Its what you bring to the game. You are a mage. You are the logistics. That's the very definition of the class as is modeled in WoW.
---
What? I'm not sure what you're referring to with your vague passive-aggressive reply, but as a mage, I always prepare water for group members in dungeons. I'm even willing to give it to them for free without needing a written invitation first! Are you saying that isn't standard?
---
Edit: Judging by your recent posts, every single one of them is a curt passive-aggressive reply mocking somebody. You honestly seem like the worst kind of person.
---
It is personal. To me it looks better on 3
---
Solid rule of thumb while learning instances - stick next to your healer. If you follow too closely to the tanks you can face pull and cause chaos.
---
If you see a marked target it's usually skull is kill first, X second with moon being polymorph and square being hunter trap.
---
Just take it slow and disregard anyone harassing you, have fun!
---
Sunken Temple, and a full BRD run
---
Sounds like someone was trying to buy something on the cheap and was using multiboxing to make sure no-one could out-bid them and the seller couldn't pull the item from auction.
---
Punching down is no fun.
---
I know what it does. But while out of combat you lose 2 instead of 3 rage every couple seconds. That wouldn't matter if you execute. A lot.

what does a baller fury spec look like?
---
Yes, it was. But for questing 5 days is a decent time, especially considering people going in blind is taking anything between 8-14 days /played.
---
Just because a world record is beaten doesn't make the old record shit like you're suggesting. Using rested as a reason why it's not viable is strange considering it wasn't used. You can't compare AoE farming with questing. I don't understand why you're attacking Joana, I suppose you got offended that he started charging money for it, but whatever you say it's a great guide, increases your leveling speed by days.
---
As a holy pally who groups with 2 rogues and a warrior (we 4 man almost everything), I have the best loot table. I need on any cloth leather mail and plate with int or +heals or both and there is a lot of it. I’m our most geared team member by far. BRD has been heaven.
---
Its the ignore thing that gets me. I just don't understand it. I've been ignored 5 or 6 times so far in classic, was never ignored back in Vanilla. And I've honestly mellowed out as a person. The stuff people ignore you for these days are retarded.
---
The extra reck swings will each do SoR dmg

The first of the reck swings will do SoC dmg

Therefore SoR is better when you have a few swings saved up

I can't wait till this trend of "ironically" liking terrible people ends.

If you don't mind me asking why would Anticipation be worthless?

Yes buddy. Very smart understanding that part. There's another part about all those complete areas being there 15 years ago and not ever being a clue to classic+. 
---
We'll all wait for you to get that part while you're being fucking condescending in the corner.
---
yep. undead priest named knups
---
Ooo the Mrnosleep of wow. Id watch the shit outta that!
---
Yay more drama.
---
I just can't farm the same place for hours. Die of boredom
---
Yes why didn't you say that earlier. This personal anecdote changes everything. 
---
I'm sure it has absolutely nothing to do with you browsing subs that constantly push this narrative. Completely unrelated. 
---
Also, by any chance are you fan of rap?
---
I legitimately didn't know this. How much does the whatever thing cost?
---
I wish the legs were 200g. They are 300+ on Herod alliance. That faction balance tho.

People are quick to say ignore you after saying something nasty.
---
I got kicked from a group because they wanted to plug a guildie. I whispered the PL saying he should've just told me they wanted to bring a guildie (I was the 5th wheel). 
---
I may have called him a coward for not being upfront about it. Then he said I am lucky he spent the time responding to me then ignored me, which seems pretty cowardly.
---
I think you can only get banned for killing quest giving NPCs as that disrupts gameplay.
---
It's okay for people to say they dislike BRD without you having to impose some condescending inferiority on them.
---
I’m mostly speaking from questing perspective here... it’s for sure worth it. Especially with remorseless attacks. Open with an ambush crit and mobs are damn near half HP right out the gate. Sure at 60 with really good swords it might not be worth it, can’t really say as I’m not there yet. While leveling up tho, especially while questing, ambush hits so hard it’s definitely worth making the macro. Hell even doing low level dgs while leveling my dmg is noticeably higher on pulls that I can get an ambush opener on than those where I get knocked out or something and have to open with a SS. 
---
Why would it not be worth it? It only costs 25% more energy than SS and does WAY more than 25% more damage. At low levels anyway.
---
Maybe keep them burning hooves off the HAY.
---
Rogue is tough, pet classes are tough, shaman are tough, mages can sheep you indefinitely....ok I can beat warriors sometimes. Priest is pretty squishy until shadow form IMHO, but they are a great class.
---
Take what I say with a grain of salt though, I’m not a priest I just play one on a TV-like monitor.  :)
---
What the actual fuck is wrong with this guy?
---
Even now on Asmon's stream they are discussing how to redistribute the item rather than getting to the actual core of the problem.
---
How do you justify using a position of authority to steal from other players and act like this while doing it? 
---
Before anyone even tries to deconstruct that - the person in question, Royson is an officer and raid leader in one of the biggest guilds on the server.  If the person HADN'T listened to him, there is a solid chance this blows up on him instead. It's a catch 22, he loses no matter what he does.
---
That's weird. I have a NA account and 2 weeks ago I logged in from china (the most suspicious country probably) and random VPNs of taiwan/hong kong while also in china. I got lots of emails of "logged in from suspicious place please verify your account with this code in battle net" but never got banned.
---
This is on an EU server
---
&gt;anyone else enjoy the leveling grind more than end game content...?
---
no lol
---
Ninjaing items doesn't hurt anyone. Got it.
---
LMAO he did this on stream? what a piece of garbage. God that dance honeslty was the most triggering part of the whole ordeal.
---
Would this be the side that's incredibly incompetent, filled with loud, histrionic crybabies who couldn't function outside of their SJW hugspaces, while simultaneously being the greatest, most dire threat to the American way of life?
---
Any ideology that requires enemies--and for everyone who disagrees with you to be pegged as an enemy--is not a healthy one. Ascribing my opinion to necessarily belong to a 'side' should be alarming to you, especially if that was an automatic assumption.
---
Nymph had one goal and one goal only to be The Leatherworker from day 1 and gosh dang if they didn’t pull it off in record time.
---
/salute is another versatile one. Yesterday horde came to help my alliance ass while I was fighting 5 mobs at once. That was a legit time to salute someone. It can also be used sarcastically, for example when you kill someone who tried to gank you.
---
Always seems to be alliance guilds. Hmmm...
---
Mildly disappointing you're not named Setz.
---
Azshara in general is starving for content
---
Yeah, I guess when I get aimed shot I'll look at it, but without it, playing BM it seems it's just a trade off of more ammo vs more water.
---
Lol, and he calls you a noob.
---
I mean if you put up a fresh spring water on the auction house for 40G and an RMTer buys it; that looks an awful lot like you bought 40G. 1 copper ore for 4G, still looking pretty suspicious. 1 light leather for 40s, maybe you just made that buyout as a longshot and somebody took you up on it, but it looks a lot worse knowing the other person is an RMTer. 
---
Naturally RMTers are going to actively look for ways to brake the terms of service in the least suspicious ways. At the same way, interactions with known RMTers are going to come under increased scrutiny. Inevitably there is going to be some grey zone of actions which seem to be in good faith if done by regular people but which cross the threshold when done by/with known RMTers. Giving everyone the benefit of the doubt gives the RMTers free reign to operate in this grey zone, so you need to have false positives.
---
That doesn't excuse a CS system that can't handle false positives though.
---
The guard is a bit south of the flight master and won't aggro unless you run in that direction. Which is why I just kill them myself after they attack me.
---
Weird.
---
Here's how to handle it:
---
Don't join a group that reserves loot.
---
The end.
---
They were already here, you just couldn't see them.
---
*L A Y E R I N G*
---
B because I hate other people.
---
Holy fuck chapocels are so fucking dumb.
---
You say there is no acceptable context to dehumanize others, then you go on your quarantined shithole and dehumanize liberals and anyone to the right of them. But yes keep calling people you disagree with chuds, you'll advance a lot as a human being that way. Disgusting little hypocrite.
---
who decides the cut-off? I can use that logic to need on everything
---
"sry, dickpic"
---
He's been fabricating drama for years now, that's nothing new and not a conspiracy. And hes not the only streamer to do that, people love to get baited and it gives streamers more exposure and money.
---
Tbh, that's nothing new in entertainment as a whole either. Reality shows on television are scripted too.
---
In Vanilla it was a dps job to manage their threat meter to not overtake the tanks. Omen threat meter was standard for a reason.
---
Mages/Warriors are the new Huntards, but Hunters are also still huntards. In my experience I've seen more shitty warriors than mages on my server, but there's a ton of idiots playing this game these days of all classes and they are all in a rush it seems, but esp the Warriors cause rage. 
---
I think half the issue comes from people having never played Vanilla and only playing later retail releases, there's huge differences between Vanilla and anything post 2.0/TBC esp after Cata which saw the world completely redone. 
---
I've seen a lot of people go absolute apeshit and rage quit over newbies accidentally starting events while turning in quests (like the ZF one after the pyramid). Honest mistakes but people aren't allowed to make mistakes anymore. 
---
I think the biggest thing I've seen is entitlement for certain classes, Warriors/Priests esp think they should have dibs on everything it seems. I've seen more reserved loot groups and piss poor attitudes from those classes than any others.
---
Saw that he was live and checked out his stream and he is literally curling 20lb dumbbells and grunting like he's in the world strongest man competition.  What a douche.
---
As a WoW classic player I qualify leaving my home city as International Travel fwiw
---
Vets who deploy take it as a deep part of their personality....
---
Like vegans or people who crossfit
---
I'll admit I don't know anything about paladins or their talents, but if you're playing a spec that does that bad of damage I dont know how you can expect to get gear before someone else. You're literally hindering the team more than helping on fights with aoe dmg where healers need to waste mana on  the ret pally. To each their own, maybe ours just doesnt know what jesus doing which could likely be the issue.
---
What the hell are you talking about?
---
Blizzard isn't going to take action against players without explicit evidence of co-conspiracy between factions. If the two players from opposite factions did not communicate in b.net servers, there is no explicit evidence of co-conspiracy. End of story.
---
If you don't like that, then that's too bad I suppose? But you're free to start a career in the user relations field, work your way up to a suitable position at Blizzard customer support, and change the system from the inside I guess.
---
It would be nice if all cases of people being assholes resulted in actions being taken against their account. But unfortunately that isn't how this things works, or has ever worked in the industry as a whole. Some pills you just gotta suck up and swallow no matter how much it hurts you to do so my friend.
---
Just hit lvl 38 with warrior and I wanted to grind the next 2 lvls to make gold for my mount. Currently at 30g. Where should I farm for 2 lvls straight?
---
Bruh just fly to the Sepulchre and run to Lordamere lake, follow the shore until you get to the dalaran bubble and farm the turtles there. Easy peasy and you can fish greater sagefish.
---
In other words, never log in anywhere other than your home IP address or Blizzard will think you’re account sharing. It’s BS that they won’t even bother looking at the proof you provided.
---
The guy posted a pic of his passport with the date stamps on there. His story checks out.
---
This is always how I handled it. I remember when I played a healer priest with dreams of converting to shadow, I always pushed to form groups without a warlock so I could roll on dreadmist. Loved having them all the rest of the time though.
---
Okay then. Clearly you have made your mind up about this and nothing I say will convince you otherwise. Have fun being trolled.
---
Every bit helps. Survivability is the main concern. It's not like it competes with +40% dodge talent. You take every talent to survive, then you take talents to improve threat, then you take PvP or whatever you want talents.
---
Nice! What nameplate addon are you using btw? I haven't found any that work yet myself.
---
I get that from alt-v. Text over players disappears but remains on my totems.
---
There are plenty of fire mages now, and well before AQ. I would learn it and sell the gloves because long term profit is better than short term IMO.
---
I guess you could try putting it up for 1000g (lol) and if they never sell, then learn it.
---
The new worgen models are looking good ... oh wait
---
So youre ok with people stealing gear for the benefit of them selves, ignoring any common courtesy? Youll fit right in at Olympus.
---
&gt;This subreddit has such a hate boner for Asmongold it's insane. It wouldn't surprise me if this whole thing was scripted drama to rile everyone up like before with Ozzy and the stupid Onyxia helm.  
---
&gt;Reply
---
Asmongold in fact stated this was scripted.  Like it or not, the dude is a master content creator and event orchestrator.
---
Just adding a little more information-
---
The reagent is naturally 20s, but can be reduced through reputation. Each rep rank grants an additional 5% discount (so 1s off the original 20s, down to a minimum of 16s for exalted).
---
One of the things that I was happy to return to is working in synergy as a group and managing aggro and doing crowd control and not just burning everything down with AoE.
---
Lol WoW and video games have always been like this. It's just trumpets everywhere who get to virtually come out of their basements again
---
They flag it as account sharing.
---
Whichever one has the least people around. I don’t need people looking over my shoulder as I place auctions.

So many lvl 60 are farming the fire elementals thou

I like Vuhdo for a few reasons. I like the aesthetics of the party panel, as well as the configuration interface. The configuration interface is pretty intuitive, and allows total customization. I like that it automatically changes based on party size, in accordance with the preferences you’ve set. I find it easy to setup my clicks (mouse wheel scroll down for renew, left click lesser heal, right click heal, control left click flash heal, alt left click cure disease, etc.). 
---
I played Vanilla through MoP, healing as a Druid and Shaman, and now Classic as a Priest. I know I used Healbot early on, and occasionally Grid until I found Vuhdo. I can’t say that Vuhdo does things that the other addons *don’t* do, however. I just stick with what I know and like. I don’t know if that helps, but hey, won’t hurt to try VD or any other of the other addons mentioned. Gotta find what works for you.
---
MFW I make The Jump safely ... then realize I forgot to dismiss my pet first.
---
I like the guys that sit on top of Qia, rapidly moving back and forth hoping someone accidentally clicks them.  One got me once when I had AFK'd and returned without paying enough attention.  The guards started hitting me, so I figured I'd get my money's worth.  I killed the guy.  We both ran back and he did the same thing again, so I killed him again.  After the 3rd time he moved over enough so that others could spin the Qia roulette.
---
No cross faction collusion.
---
I don't even know what this is but I know it's cancer
---
I heard the goblin voice.
---
This is exactly how I feel!
---
For the same reason stores usually set up with people walking to the right as they enter, it's a natural instinct due to the majority being right handed. Places that have you go left at first really mess with my head and I lose focus. The theory for THAT is you will be more taken in by subtle marketing techniques if you're off guard.
---
But back to your original question, yeah its nothing more than because you're right handed (probably).
---
You are free to not join their group, but what is the problem with 5 people agreeing on their own loot rules.

    #showtooltip Berserker Rage
---
    /cast [stance:1/2] Berserker Stance; [stance:3] Berserker Rage

Similar to the top comment right now, but a little simpler. I use the same concept as Prot for charge.

    #showtooltip Charge

    /cast [stance:2/3] Battle Stance; [stance:1] Charge

Holy crap! They took brill out? Wtf

Oh zug you defenitely vendored 70g+ in mats if you skinned 1000. You could have made a ton more money really quickly by refining or auctioning.

I walk by a dwarf (I am horde)  
---
As a greeting I gouge him and walk towards my quest  
---
He turns around and runs to me  
---
I stand still, wait for what he is gonna do  
---
He stands in front of me, silent, doing nothing, stares at me for a good 5sec  
---
He blinds me and runs towards his quest.  
---
Rogue on Rogue factioncross greeting sucessful. I chuckled at it for a little while.
---
&gt; If TB had a zep it would be my hearth
---
Even when TB did have a zep (Cataclysm), it only went to Orgrimmar not to Tristfal Glades or Zom'grol Basecamp. It was actually slower than taking the FP to Orgrimmar for 50c.
---
But if you have extra mana regen you can afford to use more spells without having a mana deficit, which means higher DPS...
---
I’ve got a Warrior main and plan on making a 49 Priest Twink. 49 for Shadowform and great pvp experience, and staying at 49 because Shadow isn’t great for pve at 60, and you need to pve to get half your pvp gear.
---
During my time leveling my warrior I grouped with a priest for ZF and Maraudon who was a couple of levels lower and shadow but healed because well - we weren’t getting a second priest and Druid/Shaman healers are rare pre 50s. Anyway I’m now doing BRD runs and had him sub in to heal. He went oom loads and I died a few times on trash mobs. This hasn’t happened with other healers - I’m using a great shield, epic  axe with crusader and most my gear is high level (From Mara, ST or BRD) and has Stam and defence rating. We were on discord and he told me he plans on staying shadow through to 60 despite being needing to run all endgame dungeons for BiS. I won’t be inviting him if I need a healer anymore (which is 90% the 5th member of the group), but I will invite him if I get a Druid healer because his dps is still good for BRD runs and Rez is a thing. Long run though, soon as I start doing Scholomance I probably won’t see him much. Shadow is just isn’t ideal for endgame pve and when you’re entry level geared for content you’re putting more weight on others’ shoulders.
---
That's where your wrong kiddo
---
Sounds good! Im not someone who gets buthurt im just trying to have fun! You know what i will join olympus
---
I just finished shimmering, it was a lot of fun because if you just kill everything, mob loot counts towards at least one of the quests there.
---
If DPS pulls threat from you it is their fault most likely.  Had to add the most likely because I have had runs where I had to give the tank more of a head start than my pet when playing my hunter.  Where I was tanking quite a few mobs while healing on my shaman.  This when I don’t heal right away.  So there are bad tanks out there.  That maybe a relief though since maybe your impression is that nothing goes wrong for them.
---
Heck I had a tank go afk in BFD for basically all of the trash because whatever delivery service had dropped off his McDonalds. He could still loot though.  I was speechless.
---
Honestly I think the best thing blizzard could do with classic+ is upgrade the talent trees for each spec from 3 wide to 4. Give more variety and combinations for every class/spec to pick from without removing anything. Give more powerful options to the weaker specs, and more flavour/oddities to current top tiers.
---
So you are giving all this advice from a place of not having to follow it yourself? Interesting
---
If the authenticator is anything like it was back in MoP you don’t have to turn anything off. Bunch of us used to share accounts even with some using authenticators.
---
Rogues, warriors etc. crit a lot in PvP, so redoubt + shield spec is pretty good value.
---
I think it's weird they suspend for a few days when someone exploits a bug, but they suspend you for a month for playing the game from eastern Europe? 
---
Weird that when I played from Russia in 2012 and 2016 they never cared, even though I was on a North American server with my friends and was using a North American billing address.
---
Barrens chat is the best chat tho
---
That's hilarious. Reminds me of calling dibs on the front seat of the car. Like dibs is even a thing...
---
Glad I chose Hunter over Mage.  Nobody bothers me, unless I need roll on something.  Then it's time to get a lawyer.
---
What the fuck lmao
---
Yup. I played a rogue back in vanilla and used to load up my UBRS groups with casters to maximize my chances of getting Dal'rends.
---
&gt; obvious clue that the author needed to rush the ending so it doesn't overstay its welcome
---
D&amp;D wrote WW2 confirmed?

Be like the rogues that start a UBRS and bring 6 clothies 3 plates.

Always use steam link, fuck Chrome Remote Desktop!

Unless you're a fatso, yes I would bet most women who have worn hot pants in the sun to have been hit on, which is the point of the joke.
---
I believe it decays, but does not reset, by 5g every month, down to 10 gold
---
Ban ban him
---
I enjoy the downtime that WoW allows you to have.  Being able to watch a football game, and mindlessly craft, or fly to hand in quests or whatever it is, is something I like about mmorpg's in general.
---
I had a tank leave mid group and ignore specifically me, because 3 of us were talking in party (all strangers)... What fucked me up was one of the three was super fucking weird, and my answers were just super generic things because people were asking me things because i had mentioned I was on an alt..
---
My beat guess is he didnt like someone else being thought as the guide more than he was because he said something that was wrong and I had corrected him (in much more polite way than I would have been back in vanilla)
---
Still baffles me..
---
And he’s 80 pounds soaking wet lmao
---
Just an FYI, if you backpack is full, this macro will not work, even if you have space in your other bags
---
Yeah when a boe epic falls in the group better need it
---
Yeah, same here. I literally couldn't connect the dots about "Buddy" until yuimiop said something about it.
---
/salute is probably my most used one. Surprised it's not on there
---
/point   Directional communication, I like to use this for various interactions with opposing faction, like resource nodes.
---
Seems good to me, I rolled a mage alt to break up the rogue grind because mage is a fun class to play
---
Lol look at who is the US president and you will have your answer
---
"plx" "pl0x" and whatever other variation of those get an instant deny.
---
pretty slick
---
I discovered a rare Worgen in Duskwood in the Vile Fang cave that I never knew about.
---
Long time twink enthusiast in the 19 bracket.
---
Rogues and hunters are the staple DPS choices. 
---
Druids are the best flag carriers by far because they're almost immune to CC as long as they have enough mana and have nature's grasp. They kinda suck for much else though in classic. Their DPS is pitiful and their healing C tier. Definitely fun to play, my main twink was druid for about 4 expansions. 
---
Priests are the best healers. 
---
Mages have a niche as CC god's with level 1 frostbolt spam and frost nova. 
---
Warriors, shaman, paladin and warlocks are all viable but struggle to find a niche where they shine over another class.
---
B! Just walk straight in. Who cares about a couple extra steps. I’m selling a Warden Staff I just got for 350g, bitches.
---
I based it on estimates and math, a place I like. And by this point, you're just trolling, so save us a reply, this is my last.
---
So, yes, feign death is a great tool for lowering threat, we don't get it until around lvl 30. Until then, you're going to be pulling stuff off the tank and all you can do is try to kite it. Try not to put extra stress on the healer by not taking damage when you do pull a mob.
---
Also, make sure you have an assist macro or at least key bind. Since there's no 'focus' target in classic, you'll have to update your macro every run, unless somebody has a better way. Just be careful because warrior tanks will change targets through each pull to put sunder on all targets, and you don't want to unload on something he just put enough threat on to keep it off the healer. I generally go for the lowest HP target since that's what everyone else (probably) is attacking. Generally go for healers first, but not everybody bothers with that.
---
Maybe he posted this since this chain went up but op has specifically said what he’s accused of fwiw
---
&gt;All in all, pet pulls aren't a big worry in WC. Thankfully.
---
Meanwhile in BRD someone's forgetting to dismiss before jumping down to fight Incendius.
---
Temp? Fuck that, set an example.
---
Bless you &lt;3
---
I'm leveling my priest exclusively in dungeons, and it sucks whenever we don't have a mage.   I'll often lose money on the run if I can't get mage water.  :.(...
---
This guy is a dick, no question. You posted DPS before you joined. I understand there are some days when I don't feel like tanking either.
---
But for your sake I would recommend building up the gear set and conference in tanking. It will greatly speed up getting groups formed, and double your shot at getting the gear you need.
---
Additionally, it opens up a new part of the game, which, with a couple smooth runs, may boots your confidence and be a fun new experience. 
---
Unless you are bleeding edge progression in RAIDs, any spec can tank the 5-15 man dungeons, and you can even OT in RAIDs.
---
Or just dont give these lowlifes more views. Yeah, I'm gonna go with that option.
---
!remindme 4 hours
---
Most enjoyable rant I’ve read in awhile, take my upvote.
---
Idk why you're getting so many downvotes. As a mage I'd much rather people just open trade.
---
I would bet you have zero idea what it’s like to work in customer service and no one in this thread has any idea what they make or their benefits.
---
I had the most trouble with BFD, but sfk and WC were not far behind in difficulty.  I hope it picks up.
---
Uhm. New players = Future Content. Quit your bitching.
---
Classic is a fan service and a great way to pad retail downtime and retain or pull in subscribers.  Its not intended to eventually replace retail (unless it's hyper hyper successful which time will tell)
---
I played on my laptop while on vacation in Edinburgh too. Got suspended, somehow it got removed when I changed my password
---
I don't know where this delusional mindset came from. You ALWAYS need high value BOE's in a pug group. Its not that I can't trust a player its that I can't trust 4 other random people in my group. Why everyone greed when its agreed upon that everyone is greeding, what is the difference from everyone needing in this instance? That just opens up the possibility of this happening.
---
Only time I don't need is on something like tailoring patterns when someone mentioned before group they have 300.
---
I agree, but at the same time people who refuse to ever cast a heal on a class like a Shaman are just as toxic as the people who insist that they're only healers.
---
It's a hybrid class. You have to use your heals to be useful, even if you play a build that also allows you to do some damage on the side.
---
That's a bingo.
---
I mean, it's a PVP server. If you pick a PVP server and don't want the overall theme of possibly killing or getting killed by the opposing faction then I would say roll a PVE server. 
---
I'm not mad at the game for being ganked. And playing *as the server is intended to be played* shouldn't make you say "ugh". Killing those randoms opens up that area for the horde to farm as opposed to the alliance. So it isn't just wasteful PVP. I'm doing something productive for my faction.
---
BRD is like the death watch bunker on Endor in SWG: change my mind
---
Yeah those examples are rude. But I've been put on ignore for asking politely. More recently I've just been offering 20s right away that gets the job done.
---
Zoomable mini map makes navigation simple
---
Whenever I run a dungeon I have a few stacks ready for the group ahead of time. Give them out by the meeting stone. People helping people is one of the things I really miss about the game today. Its been a great experience going back.
---
It's like the pic/ss was taken in 2004
---
Thought I was on Blind for a sec haha
---
Going through your activity you don't actually seem to have anything to say that even suggests slight intelligence. Seems to be your forté. Wonder what kind of life someone such as you leads, probably one with zero sex and neck beards I imagine
---
The plan was to ninja no matter what the loot was. 
---
Create drama.  Drama creates content. Content + Drama = Views.
---
And what if they’re an herbalist+alchemist who makes health pots from herbs they ran across while leveling?
---
That was more funny than I was expecting.
---
The whole thing is clearly a setup by Quin to get free shit and attention, Asmon &amp; co are rolling with it and getting free content.
---
Edit, [clip of Quin that was linked to Asmon, after Quin won the duels and got his gloves](https://clips.twitch.tv/HorribleShortGrouseTwitchRaid)

Yes. Asmon said if guild gets it, its win.

How do you know who is racist and homophobic. Wow dude you are completely brainwashed... have fun living your life thinking like this.
---
Yeah it's not like theres a thing called comedy and teens discover it and like saying fucked up shit for fun. Everyone does it. YOU TOO. Just depends to what extent. But when it reaches your limit it's a problem and we must now censor what you don't like lol???
---
Here's an idea little buddy, get off the internet because you're not mature enough for it. Try growing up and come back one day.
---
Source?
---
If you're in a PUG need if need no matter what IMO.
---
If you wanna funnel gear to a certain class that's what guilds are for.
---
That goes for pretty much all hybrid non healing specs until TBC.  Even then druid healing was pretty meh.
---
Can't wait for a TBC server re-release
---
I typically DE those as that 1g is negligible especially at 40, at this point the mats are worth slightly more and increase when getting closer to endgame.
---
So at first I didnt want to roll a mage because its just so fucking popular ehhhh even though it was my first toon in Wow.  
---
So I did druid -- it was fun but not for me so now im trying Shaman. Shaman super fun but now that I see all these mages are apparently shit it makes me want to go be a good mage X\_\_x.   
---
had a mage in SFK yesterday didn't stick with group near stairs when we LOS pulled Arugal ---- hes just up on the ledge  like a whacky inflatable arm man and gets 2 hit by Arugal then gets mad that he "stole aggro off tank".   
---
Holy sweet jesus.
---
Yeah problem is I don't see it as a flaw at all. First of all, it's 50g at max; which decays: not 100g. Second, you're not supposed to be respeccing every few hours? That's literally the point.
---
&gt;You are trying to directly connect specific changes that directly lead to other changes and so forth. It just doesn’t work like that, and to assume as much (like many incorrectly do on this sub) is doing so out of ignorance.
---
The fallacy part of the slippery slope fallacy is when you argue that allowing/doing one thing will lead to people doing a technically unrelated other thing. Here, we're arguing that any implementation  of retail mechanics means there's no reason that they can't or won't implement the rest of them. That's not a fallacy, that's just a factual statement. The reason they haven't yet is because classic is supposed to be as close to an accurate remake of the 1.12 client as they could make, which goes out the window if they start adding things like dual spec.
---
Saving this, thank you.
---
Dude. Your post was deleted. You have nothing to say that matters. Like I said. No one cares.
---
Quin Won! Fuck Royson.
---
😂😂😂😂😂 I've never met a mage like that, bit I'll keep a lookout for them
---
I see asmidwhatevergold, I downvote. Bye.
---
Retail xpacs are not resets because my level stats the same. It takes a long time to get to 60 for people who arent super efficient or dont have a ton of time on their hands every day of every week.
---
If you seal our characters in a vault after a year and a half youd see a ton of players quit imo. Only people who are already 60 or close to it in classic rn would consider staying i would think
---
One thing is being spoonfed.
---
One thing is to realize that asking for dedication for a 2+ hour run ( and i am being extremely generous here) without being able to take long breaks like you can do in a raid it's quite not the best way to handle a dungeon in a MMO, other than being punsihing if one player leaves/has some kinds of problems, and while it has its goods it tends to be far too much niche.
---
Oh please, enlighten me oh [stupid one](https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/d5fngt/z/f0m6tpb).
---
if we don't get slip n slides instead of slow ass lifts in tb and 1kn im going to be very angry.
---
Yeah man, I’ve really struggled to find groups to the point that I report players who kill quest mobs and won’t party up with me. Oh wait! That’s you.
---
&gt;I roll fire. always fire. but I keep my frost bolt and arcane up to date, because not all battles are equal.
---
+1 for another fire mage
---
All the bad mages are frost. The good mages prefer the hotness.
---
48 Mage. Should I bother doing Mara or just focus on questing?
---
If I ask my mage friend to open a portal just for me, I throw in 25s everytime.
---
Nothing at all please.
---
Imagine telling people to stop hating mages while at the same time putting down hunters.
---
Yeah i actually wouldn't get a laugh out of that.

Coords to Strath? The story from the others in the party is that they were waiting for him 10 minutes while they were in Strath ready to start, he got removed, then he started calling the tank "A racist and a ninja" in world chat which is totally false. The guy is a prick
---
And let it be clear I whispered him to find our why Mursten was a ninja and a racist - not to bash him. That came later when he admitted to being a lying, slanderous scumbag
---
im just saying those parts are mostly developed and could be released for classic in the future. whys everyone in this sub so hostile lol
---
Agreed. I've seen way more whiny and toxic weirdos on r/classicwow than ingame for some reason. Probably because players I encountered ingame were all just trying to play the actual game instead of venting whatever frustrations they have.
---
Until Black Morass came along.
---
Spell penetration is a thing. Use frostbolt on 2 bosses and some trash. Fire on everything else.
---
Really wish i had saved screenshots of topping damage in MC as fire so these silly myths can stop.
---
No but when we reach his limit we must censor. As long as hes upset it's a problem... these guys are brainwashed beyond any help.. just let them be miserable in their crappy lives
---
Level arms or fury, don't level prot.
---
awesome, thank you
---
I think Strat Live and LBRS are doable at 58.  Strat UD and scholo you need 60 but can maybe get away with 59 if your group is patient with you.  UBRS you need 60 and probably some decent gear at least a few pieces from brd/other end dungeons and quests.
---
Gearing a fury warrior for pre-bis is tough because you have a lot of competition for loot.  I think it's efficient to do dungeons before hitting 60, especially Brd arena+angerforge to try to get your savage gladiator chain and HOJ.  Other than that you wanna do strat live for your mask of the unforgiven asap and once you have that you can basically start focusing on other dungeons.
---
As a rogue, I refuse to use swords.  If I wanted to play as a fury warrior, I'd be a fury warrior.  It's daggers or nothing.
---
&gt; bigger than retail
---
Tf?
---
I play healer and this is my experience. Too much for party 5 man shit, but not enough to fill out raids. 
---
It's the role that is more popular than tank, yet you still need only one of. Then raiding hits and that ratio pretty much stays the same for tanks (dps warriors OT) but the healers needed multiplies by 8-12 times as much.
---
On incendius it's actually harder to get a group as a healer than a dps sometimes.
---
I am sorry very sorry for your loss. This was incredibly heart breaking to read, my partner and I can feel your pain and we wish we could take it away.
---
Nice idea and execution, pal!
---
This is why y'all need to stop feeling into stupid mob mentality drama. 
---
Stop posting "black listing" posts
---
Stop posting ninjas. 
---
Stop posting dick heads. 
---
Handle your shit in game, not on here. These retards need less publicity
---
i know that. hows that stop the fact itd be easy to implement into classic in the future?
---
Imagine not playing wow befor Cata.
---
It is kind of hard to maintain a good balance of leveling/grouping and good social standing if you're just RPing as a jerk all the time. Being friendly is a positive aspect to playing an MMO. It benefits everyone.
---
lol yeah, not spending 10 minutes making 200 water at 2 per cast. Especially not when I might not use it all. If you want to spend time doing that then power to you. I'll spend 5-10 seconds when I need it to create a few bottles for myself. If someone wants the water they can tip me for my time and wait. But don't act like making 200 bottles of water when you log on is the "right way" to play.
---
down-voted twice already - how about explaining why you want it so i can understand?

The character screen is open tho, they literally don't have them equipped

---

---
nah dude, I feel you very much. My good warrior friend lost HoJ to a hunter because apparently, some BiS lists have HoJ as their 2nd trinket slot. The worst part about this: we're Horde, so the dude could easily have gotten a much better trinket via Quest.
---
Two days in a row in badlands, horde were running from mobs at low health and were gonna make it and get away. So I mc’ed them so the mobs could catch up
---
I disagree that you have to use your heals to be useful on enhance shaman. Ele for sure(if youre pve), but i agree with what youre saying in general. People who force others to play the game the way they want them to are just as toxic as players who dont play well but demand to be carried.
---
Blizzard reserves the right to ban players from their service at their discretion. OP isn't the one on trial here, Blizz customer service is and it's OP's responsibility to prove they've behaved poorly and he hasn't provided evidence for that.
---
I was curious about both, thanks for the answer!
---
Yawn I’ll do what I want kthx. All I said was I’m glad I didn’t have it spoiled. Holyyyyy shit lmao some people
---
I haven't played retail in a long time so I don't know if its true or not, just his excuse.
---
the albino right?  just found him for the first time.
---
dropped a cool shield.
---
I really wish Stalagg had a better balance.
---
Well, not really. Both hit (until cap) and crit are far more important for hunters than agility.
---
I think the main problem with all of your ideas of why slow is better is that every one of those things is burning mana which means you're sitting there drinking more and not killing stuff.  For killing things fast then sitting down and drinking I'd guess sure slow is better, but for conserving mana so you can throw a pet mend out then continue to kill, the only ability I typically throw out is serpent sting until I get a few unintended adds, then I have the mana to handle them.
---
Wait what.. I’ve been using my NA account in Australia, Asia, and Europe without any issues.. Literally just came back to NA and have had no issues at all. What did you do?
---
All mages are just vending machines for their warlocks
---
It's a simple case of Blizzard not wanting to pay people a full-time wage to sift through the dragnet and find the few turtles among the fishes. It's because they're cheap. Case closed.
---
No, but... A clothie can roll on cloth... A pally can roll on cloth, leather, mail, and plate.
---
I'm pretty noob at this. What exactly is mouseover macro and how it differs from the addons that other people here recommended to me?
---
Farm it at 60 with a healer, easiest way because you can skip most of the dungeon.
---
No, however there will be plenty of ganking at flightmasters
---
Use more full stops for dramatic effect, or is it "periods" where you are from?
---
I agree, an upgrade is an upgrade.
---

so are you saying Africans have short attention span?  Why Africans?

What's really great when using ravager against a pack is every mob is hit once every 3 seconds for 9 seconds.  Any single one of those hits can proc the axe again so it's possible to have it go off for a lot more than 9 seconds.
---
I use ravager in battle/zerk stance and swap to 1h+sheild in defense.  I tell my AOE dps they are free to go ham if they see me figure skating, if not they should single target skull :)

---
Where? Still don't see it in the original post, copied below.
---
&gt;I recently went on a trip to Eastern Europe, as part of my job, and during my time there I logged in and played classic wow from the hotels I stayed at. About a week after returning from the trip, I came home from work to find that my account had been suspended for a month. I of course appealed the suspension and offered to provide flight itineraries, passport entry and exit stamps, photos with metadata from the trip. The CS rep at Blizzard wasn't interested in any evidence I had and sent me another form email essentially saying "tough luck, don't bother contacting us again".
---
&gt;Looking briefly through /r/WoW and /r/ClassicWoW it appears that I'm not the only one in this situation. /u/Djibrilsise and /u/Math_Theory have reported eerily similar stories here and here. I obviously can't vouch for the veracity of their story, but I can provide evidence of mine.
---
&gt;Here is a photo of a few of the passport entry and exit stamps on my passport.
---
&gt;I'm not upset that I got suspended, false positives are a reality when they're aggressively monitoring for cheaters and that's an important aspect of maintaining the integrity of the game. What is infuriating is that they make seemingly no effort to identify those false positives and rectify incorrectly applied suspensions. My goal here isn't to get my suspension overturned, I know that none of you have that power. However if I had known what would result from playing while I was in Europe, I would have waited until I returned. My hope with this post is that I can prevent someone else from having to deal with this same ridiculous bullshit.    
---
Oh, found it. It isn't in the original post but in a comment reply:

Dude it's much easier for someone to be a piece of shit over an email. If you get someone on the phone there is no way they will refuse to help, and if by chance they did its way easier to insist on talk to a manager. Definitely call them dude, I'm sure they will fix it asap.

Wait where do I type this in?

Going down to Winter's Chill already irreparably gimps your dps so you might as well max to give the actual DPS mages the most benefit

WowBIS is probably weighing int a bit too high, or they're somehow treating it as a set where they need more INT. Lost hope is clearly better.

If anyone is having an unreasonable response, it would be you right now.

Is that Bongos or Dominos to put your trinkets above your bars?

Cheap compared to what? The boonies in Alabama? Sure

But Blizzard isn't in Alabama so that doesn't matter.

I mean if you insist that an area thats an hours drive away from the LA county line isn't LA thats on you. There's a reason the OC isn't part of LA county lol.

If I can farm it alone I never give up. If it's something I have to farm in a group I give up faster than spelling out the name of the item.

It breaks easily from big hits, while dots almost never break it. Not sure how it interacts with lava damage.

So what you're saying is it increases my killing power?

As soon as you connect with an unknown IP you are prompted to re-enter a code. The only way that it wouldn’t require removal is if you are communicating the Authenticator code in real time, which is nothing short of impractical when you’re paying someone many timezones away to boost you.
---
The customer supprt has really not been the same.  Its cold and unrepresentative of what it was in original classic WoW.  
---
I feel like my money is just going into the share holders pocket.
---
&gt; Mara is a really long instance and in my experience is prone to wipes.
---
Yeah im worried about the length. For some reason the dwarf/titan themed instances (mara/ulda) seem to take forever. What level would you recommend mara if im low? 49/50?
---
Also where do you pick up the quests? Desolace?
---
MC was simply just a raid within a raid.
---
I personally like 2h. There's gonna be more downtime for sure since you're taking more damage, but it does offer quite a bit of DPS, more so than a 1h. I guess it just depends on what you have at the time. If I find a really good 1h out of a dungeon or something, I'll use it for a while until I find a better 2h.
---
In BC I ran heroic Magister's terrace around 30 times before I finally got my expertise trinket. In BC, you could only run heroics once a day and there was no work around with random dungeon finder, so it took 30 days of running every single day. I formed the groups and only invited cloth dps and heals, and a tank who already had it.  After 30x, I'm not taking risks by inviting someone who would roll against me.
---
worked retail for 8 years so fully understand stonewalling to stop scammers but you still allow proof to show they are not a scammer, which is what the problem is here, the CS he spoke to refusing the proof

Diablo yeet

Do you have the timer taking into account how many combo points are being spent on the SnD?

Thanks for the tip!

You know they're endangered species, right?
---
So fabricated lmao
---
This has to be my favorite piece of fan art yet. Something about the reactions of all the players had me laughing my ass off.
---
Lol you we’re both true to your names!
---
You nailed it. Tank quality is the biggest factor by far in the efficiency of a dungeon run. A quality tank can carry a group through a dungeon in half the time a bad tank will. I have no problem with "paying" a very good tank with gear/first orb etc to avoid the absolute hell that is some dungeon groups.
---
I think I have my Undead Mage logged out there right now. Definitely going to buy a mug for your brother.
---
My account was actually compromised from Taiwan about a year ago (even with mobile authenticator odd) and it triggered this.
---
Weird that you got a month ban instead of the account just being locked? And the 'login from different location' is usually instant upon the attempted login and you played throughout the week.
---
Mine was resolved very simply and easily with just a picture of my ID along with the ticket, nothing else was required and that's that.
---
Something's phishy here because:
---
1. You somehow didn't trigger the instant account lock by logging in from abroad.
---
2. You played assumably on/off for the week and got a ban when going home.
---
3. The CS rep was bad like they usually are now.
---
So either everything went wrong at once or we're not getting all the info.
---
Honorable fair open world PVP simply does not exist on PVP servers which should in fact be rebranded to Newbie Ganking Servers. If you join one of those, you're essentially signing your name to an agreement that states that you will endure being randomly attacked in hopeless no win situations ... and this often.
---
I prefer the cold war tension of PVE servers. Most people are civil to the other faction, but there's always those few guys who turn their PVP flag on and welcome attacks knowing it could massively escalate.
---
Would flattery work?
---
"hail, oh mighty mage. Listen, I just started out and I don't have much on me but would you be so kind to port me over to X capital city?"
---
Dudette, there's nothing wrong with expecting players who want to complete content to be prepared for that content. You're making this a problem for yourself, I'm just responding. OP's original post is about players not knowing how to navigate the dungeon. Do you release where you are you obese basement dwelling 14 year old? Oh mb i thought we were reduced to name calling over the internet. P.s i shave on a bi daily basis, so my neck has no beard, but I'm glad you have enough insight to use blanket statements and try to put people in your imaginary boxes so neatly ordered within disillusioned perspective.
---
this post should be nuked
---
Playing on a Laptop you own and used for WoW, this does not happen. I've been to Italy, Ireland, played and came home with no problem. There is something you're not telling us or it was flagged for something else entirely.
---
Love that feel
---
No need for any of that. As long as you maintain a plate set with stam on in you'll be fine.
---
No need for consumables in dungeons either.
---
90% of the tanking comes from the base warrior kit, and if you SPLIT the tanking between all 3 warriors I think you would have been fine.
---
The fact that there was no conversation, and even though you expressed being DPS before you joined is just a jerk move on the leaders part.
---
Believe this happened to a streamer or high end arena player at one point. Was traveling, basically same situation.
---
They didn't do shit about that situation either. Blizzard doesn't care and they basically threaten you to not contact again in these cases.
---
Are you blind or deaf because even 5 years ago is literally a different world what... 5 years ago mainstream media would make a joke that would destroy your life today.

better way to measure kills per hour is to go 5 minutes or 10+ minutes even and get your kills/hr then. 10 kills you might only have to drink/eat once or something, will need to get a metric including waiting on spawns potentially and downtime of food and drink (for most classes)

Not if you want the icon to be meaningful

Basalisks in thousand needles by entrance to tanaris will net similar returns and be a tad easier 37-39. Also if you're on a Pvp server, the other players in the area aren't going to be 40+ like they are in swamp.

PSA: SKIP THIS QUEST or do it at a dead time on your realm.
---
If you are the one reserving loot the way it goes is:  
---
1. Don't invite people that will roll for it
---
2. Talk to your guild
---
3. Make it clear before you inv people
---
and enjoy your questing.   
---
If someone trying to do it when you join a group the process is:  
---
1. /leave  
---
2. LFG again  
---
Reserving is shit - you roll for loot thats why its there. If you need to get geared for your guilds raid have them run you through it to get the gear. If you ahve no guild and just want the piece - take a number like everyone else.
---
Kinda disagree with openfire. A lot of times I will ask an enemy player to /wait then /point at the idiot who just ninjas a chest or node or quest item then /openfire on the enemy player trying to instruct him to kill said individual
---
Something that hasn't been mentioned, be very careful if you're using tab to Target. I'm assuming you might be if you're new to dungeons. It has a larger range than you think and mobs are cramped in instances. It isn't always easy to see which mob you're focused on with the red carpets in sm.
---
As for aoe vs single Target, you have to get a feel for the group. A shitty tank will always always always blame dps for losing agro. Regardless if that's what happened or not. If your group is struggling, underleveled, or if you're the only aoe class there go single Target. If you do aoe, give the tank time to build threat on all the mobs. If you don't see him switching targets be wary. If you do pull, which will happen, be ready with a Nova or a coc slow until the tank gets them back and then ease back into it. And don't just turn and run away. Try to bring the mob back to the tank. Also, doing a direct damage like fireblast and then aoe could cause your threat to spike on that one mob. It's usually better to just aoe if you're going to aoe. The one exception is if there is a particularly dangerous npc that needs to be burned down first.
---
If you're ever unsure... Just ask. The number of people that I've run into in pugs that would be an asshole to someone for just asking, is small enough that you can just ignore them and not impact your experience. 
---
Lastly, don't be shy about getting in another group. The only way to figure everything out is just to do it over and over and over. If you're 34 you'll be in sm for a while so may as well get good at it.
---
I don't even mind the red flash when I have my map open. I just wish it would *stop flashing* when I close my map. Instead, it keeps flashing until I drop combat, which is super annoying.
---
A lot of powerleveling services and gold purchasing services are provided by people in Ukraine/Bosnia/other European areas, and the assumption was all leveling/illegal services was done in China/other areas.  Essentially Blizzards Warden service picked up an IP address that wasn't of his typical location, so they did the 1 month ban.  Blizzard is on the hunt for IP's that typically log in in the US and then there is an IP in Europe.  I don't believe the suspension is done by a human but more so a monitoring service that provides a report to the higher level CSR's.
---
It is however expected of you to contribute to the group with the skills your class offers. Doesn't mean you can't withhold that if somebody is being an ass, but be aware that you're still hurting the group by doing so. Just because it's expected to contribute in what ever way your class can, doesn't mean it's not also expected to be a nice human being in return
---
Usually that is the sign of a good mage. If you need to ask them for water chances are they are gonna suck
---
I go to the one in IF with the other 3 alliance in my server :,)

This sub is a perfect representation of the classic community.

I have been told there is one and i have also been told that it is not against the tos.
---
Quin absolutely fucking wrecked him. Delete the mage immediately.
---
I think I got the WC quest sword at 17 on my rogue.  So get that ASAP.  Look for cheap pieces that LWs are selling on the AH for gear.  Prices on my server are just over what they would get for vendoring them.  Assuming prices are that low where you are it is probably easier doing that than leveling up LW to make your own.
---
How is that dull? Seeing new lands! Exploring the unknown! You’re on an adventure! Your experience yields rewards. Excelsior!
---
Thanks, I ended up mostly leveling and had enough to buy at 40.
---
Is 100g worth more now or when gold is worth less? I keep seeing people saying "hold it" but may as well use it or sell it whenever. No sense in waiting for inflation imo.
---
I joined a group for strat ud today.  Got a whisper from the hunter who asked if i was rolling on cape of the black baron . I said yes for my main spec (fury warrior, joined as tank).  He offered me 50g to pass on it if it dropped.  I thought about it a bit and agreed.  I thought about replying to him that I would take 10g upfront and 50g IF it dropped but I ultimately decided to agree with his transaction as stated.
---
I think this was a respectful move and a fine way to handle it.
---
I also think reserving items when advertising in the chat is perfectly fine and it DID happen back in vanilla.
---
Is that run not the whole point of the NE wisp racial?
---
like most of the posts on this sub, i dont get it

subreddit re-origination
---
Literally everyone is reserving loot, they are just doing it in different ways.

I'd rather someone just reserve dalrends and master loot it, but also bring along some rogues or warriors or hunters instead of just not bringing any of those classes in the first place.

The wowhead guide has a [deep prot build](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/warrior-tank-talents-builds-classic-wow).  Is that something worth building towards after respecing at 40 plus and spamming dunegons?
---
You keep saying leather leather leather. You just need to keep the random greens "of the bear" or "of stam" and you have a tank set.
---
Also, because it is a 10 man, you are expected on some pulls to have multiple tanks.
---
This is the same for PvP, you aren't going to run truestrike and devilsaur in PvP either.

I don’t remember guild houses, but I do think before the game came out they wanted to have individual housing for players. Always thought that would’ve been so awesome!

ok cool

That’s the one dungeon I said no to. F gnomer no thanks.
---
i never understood why anyone would raid ffa
---
They don't need it to be useful,  but to be optimal, yes.  Like any other consumable,  you'll need a lot more early on when people aren't as geared and are still learning content.  Once you get some raids on "farm" and run with geared players, it becomes less essential.  Same way you won't see people in full tier gear still popping flasks and gaming world buffs to do low level raids
---
10/16 pre raid bis pieces for shadow are also phase 1 raid bis. Shadow just doesn’t  scale with anything but spell power.

Your friends are very stupid then. Anything that you pay money to monthly, you should have 2FA on. In fact just anything where a credit card is involved at all.

I wouldn’t trust anyone to tell me to not roll need on high valued items. That’s how you get ninjas.

Feels man. As for me, I miss cata because I played with my older brother who passed away
---
Best way to level up ranged weapons? 52 warrior here.
---
Keep it equipped at all times, and click it again to use it once it is equipped. Or atleast equip it before going into contested zones and areas where you believe you will be facing PvP.
---
Hey folks, you know why people make threats?  Because they got mad.  Sane or not, that is how the human mind works.
---
You know what is karma?  Manufacturing drama then getting 'surprised' by threats.
---
You mean Garrisons :D
---
But yea despite your hate for two of the best versions of wow 
---
Player housing is cool, and I'd like to see it.
---
I was so happy when that warrior rekt you.
---
You care about scripted drama? You got played.
---
Proceed to make 30 macros for emotes.
---
Are hunters that bad later? I loved my hunter 12 years ago, but I don’t want to play a class that suck a lot end game. I know that hunters are used mainly for utility in the later raids, how much it is a big deal? I like both pvp and pve, will I regret spending so much time leveling a hunter?
---
Who now?
---
Do you just track your buff time with it or are you trying to do something fancy and hard-to-do? 
---
Tracking buff uptimes always worked great for me. How exactly have you tried setting this up?
---
Poland is part of Central Europe.
---
Even lava damage won't break fear
---
Right? I'm fury/prot and have no problems tanking at all. I'm geared as a tank and specced as a dps so I do assloads of damage and threat and have reasonable mitigation. Sometimes I have to pull the shield out if the healer is going oom in fights but it's not hard.
---
You never really leave the Barrens.  Anywhere you go, somebody wants you to go speak some schmuck in the Barrens.
---
Why do you care if other people reserve items in their groups?
---
You might be living in fairy land if you think BoE won't end up in the AH.
---
There is something very wrong about giving a Felstriker to a Hunter...
---
Can you post your UI please I like your action bar setup
---
Any links to a blue post?
---
Makes me doubly thankful to be playing the shaman with an autorez to help us get around that.
---
Note the "meant" and "should be". How long did it take to get cleared the first time the game was released? Was it a week? Doubtful.
---
This but unironically
---
Calling a reservation in itself is bad etiquette, you can say what your hoping for but really should expect competition if a class that can compete or has it as their bis item is in your group.
---
When leveling, and undergeared, yes prot is superior. Once a fury/prot tank has 9 hit (or 6 hit at 305 weapon skill), it easily surpasses prot in threat generation.
---
Prot works just fine, but it's oldschool. Threat is the name of the game, and fury/prot is king for threat generation.
---
&gt;Jagex support
---
What support?
---
Honestly Classic Barrens chat has been disappointing lol. Super lacking on the Chuck Norris jokes. I brought it up once and everyone said it's about Keanu now lmao.
---
Excuse me, it wasn’t literally you who said it. But the original guy I responded to (whose mantle you took up) said that giving people this small convenience will lead to another and another and another. Stating that it’s what lead to retail. I’m not saying “he meant this”, he literally said it.
---
Just because a mechanic is intentionally in a game doesn’t mean it’s not flawed. Same with the atm. Even if the dick kicking is intentional, it doesn’t mean it’s not a flaw.
---
I'm a mage and I AOE constantly in instances. I drink while the tank builds threat tho. Then come in at 70% mob health and do a bit o the ol' damaj 
---
If there's 1-3 mobs I don't bother with the AOE tho.
---
Not sure what all you should ignore, but it might be good to keep up with either scorch or fireball. I (warlock) level with my brother (mage) and he’s pretty much useless if we run into mobs that have frost immunities. Elementals, oozes, etc. Definitely niche but something to consider
---
Morhaime was in charge from the start of Blizzard to like a year ago, I doubt he was the metaphorical gandalf holding back bad customer service lol
---
You were obviously antagonizing him. I don't care I'm just pointing out the obvious.
---
Man garrisons were garbage, I seriously hated that mechanic.
---
I'll do it once when the group is full. No big deal is it?
---
IK hunter is top tier at solo farming, thats why its kinda balanced. Warriors can't do much alone but they can easily find parties
---
Oh nice, I didn't know it passively generated rage.  That's definitely something worth spending points on.  I don't really see the appeal of tactical mastery since I never want to be out of defensive stance when tanking (extra threat generation when in defensive stance and less damage taken).  It kinda seems like a lot of points just to get passive rage generation when I could alternately get + threat % and + 1h damage to get better threat.
---
Do you think one weapon would be bugged and another wouldn't?
---
Woah there, space cowboy. HoTS was great, then Blizzard killed it. Classic is about the only thing Blizzard has done right in the past 3 years.
---
The main flaw to that slow defensive play being CC, burst, or a combination of the two. 
---
A priest that is stun-locked or counterspelled is going to have a bad time and big damage crits can chew through HP faster than low-level healing. 
---
I still think priest, especially after 40, is one of the best 1v1 dueling classes in PvP but they have weaknesses.
---
The difference is that you could call and reverse it.  What Blizzard is doing here is they are just saying tough luck and not fixing it.
---
BuT iTs FaStEr To UpLoAd.....
---
*Per se* *
---
It's latin.
---
Why? It just advertises  “I am salty, please corpse camp me”
---
You're awfully confident for someone that has only ducked requests at explaining the inconsistencies in your position.
---
I'll chalk it up to you being too proud and dumb to admit you're wrong.
---
Blizzard has always been pretty good at this, atleast compared to other companies like Valve and stuff.
---
Jesus. That's the most hi-res photo of a screen i've ever seen. I ain't even mad that it's not a screenshot. That's amazing.
---
Not a big deal big enough to make a macro so you can post it in every group?
---
You even made a reddit post on how to do it. 
---
But no big deal right?
---
Many do, as well as a billion other things that were rumored, promised, or even made it to box art like the dance studio in Wrath of the Lich King that never actually saw fruition.
---
But unlike those things that don't exist and never existed and thus will never be added to Classic (because that defeats the purpose of Classic, even though it would be cool nonetheless), BC and Wrath versions of Classic are something that I'd expect are fairly certain. Eventually. We're talking at least a couple years down the road, for certain. Lots of people still prefer those expansions over others, when there were a *few* quality-of-life changes, as well as a few balancing updates and reworks (like paladins having a taunt, or shamans having a crowd control ability) without it being the bland, grindy, task-based "knock out your daily list of chores" style that retail currently is.
---
Maybe they'll eventually add player housing or guild housing to retail, but I really honestly hope that they either keep Classic... er, Classic, perhaps with the added options to port your character to BC or Wrath servers when and if those come along.
---
That would be the Orc poop.
---
Ok, maybe it was a dumb comment, but by my understanding... generating money through vendors and quest rewards puts more money into the world economy, which translates to more spending $ for AH gear
---
I've never played WoW, so I dont have experience with how bad inflation gets.
---
I like this answer best, so let me add my two cents from a tank’s perspective. To preface I mark pulls religiously. Skull-focus, X-second, Moon-sheep.
---
*There is nothing wrong with single target frostbolting.* I had a mage with me that didn’t AoE and it was fantastic! Look for where utility spell can help and use them. Use Sheep, Counterspell and decurse! No caster mobs in the dungeon? Give the tank amplify magic for better heals.
---
This mage pointed out that we had cleared the dungeon faster than his AoE farming group ( he had a timer) due to 1. the focus on single mobs yielding increased up-time on caster mana, 2. my chain pulling group to group for minimal down time, and 3. CCing the hardest hitting adds reducing the strain on the healer’s mana.
---
If your tank isn’t marking, check the pulled mobs for stacks of the Sunder Armor debuff and Frostbolt-focus down the one with the most stacks. Hopefully this is also the one with the least health, but some groups focus badly.
---
If there’s a third mob using ranged attacks like a bow or casting spells, sheep it. If it’s just a second caster-mob, use Counterspell to interrupt casting. This will likely give you aggro, so run to the tank. You can frost nova the mob in range of the tank for them to taunt when they can.
---
There’s no reason the aoe unless there’s a seriously screwed up pull with 5+ mobs and the tank couldn’t hope to hold threat against all of them. Go ham, you’re likely to wipe anyway. Might as well thin the pull for the next attempt.
---
The short story: Mages have tons of utility. Read through your spellbook and learn what you can do then think about where it might be useful.
---
oh man well I hope you get it eventually.
---
Holy special fucking snowflake man.
---
Will do for sure!
---
To gain experience. In Classic WoW pretty much you need to kill on your way to and from every quest and town in order to keep up in experience. There are looters and pillagers at another farm north of Moonbrook, btw.
---
Exploring the world is definitely the pro here.  Seems far more alive then retail due to them making all previous negligible when bew content comes out.
---
What level would I be able to solo all of this?
---
Sure, call us stupid. That doesn't change the fact that we don't use 2FA for video game accounts.
---
I don't use my debit card for anything anyways, only credit, so the charges are easy to contest. Not that I've had to, because I have a strong password.
---
XP and loot...
---
You lost motivation to play that easily? Like must be really difficult for you.
---
2H
---
2hander
---
Grilled Squid been solid for me, Ive been buying the raw squid and reselling the grilled squid stacks for a bit extra.
---
I see chat is really important to you
---
Well top speed leveller was like 3 days played, thats speed levelling. Very efficient is like 5 days, medium is like 8 probps
---
Tell me how we can kill onyxia with 20 people and not allow a couple people to play the spec they want..  as for my molten core reference,  that guild was pro.  We're all much more geared now... we can accommodate a couple non elite specs. Raiding has proved to be a lot less demanding than it was in classic.
---
You are likely going to face much more adversity as you progress, if something as relatively innocuous as this causes you to lose the will to play, you may want to rethink whether or not this game is for you.
---
No, I just know how hunters work.
---
Makes sense, considering the condition of Strahnbrad, which has been deserted since the beginning of the Third War.
---
You must not be looking very hard then. 
---
I see it all the time, and me and my friends say it.
---
What's this macro you made? Can I see? :D
---
2 hander
---
you can keep a sword and shield handy in case you end up needing it for a dungeon, but you don't always need a shield to tank a dungeon.
---
I honestly wouldn't look for a replacement; alternatives are so much weaker it's not even funny.
---
But you could get Gargoyle Slashers from Kirtonos in Scholo, then whatever gives good chunks of stats for legs. Cloudkeeper Legplates is the best choice, but even more pricy. Legplates of Valor from Rivendare is probably your best bet.
---
Again though, there's really no reason to not get Devilsaur.
---
i didn't say layering was added just to be creative, but it was an example of blizzard being creative, and it didn't pan out.
---
and no, it was not added to deal with overcrowded zones, it was added to ensure that servers had long term healthy populations. per blizzard themselves.
---
and you want the community to vote on changes? the same community clamoring for LFG, Transmog, Dual Spec, etc?
---
might as well not call it **classic** \+ at that point, it's now wow 2.0.
---
Did you leave the dungeon before getting the loot? If so, you become ineligible to receive it, so it probably stayed on the corpse where the shaman picked it up, or it counted all you as non-eligible and he auto won.
---
Don't leave dungeons before getting loot, you won't get it.
---
Sorry I couldn’t remember his name but managed to look it up eventually. I was talking about Iceposiden.
---
maybe i go left because i use my left hand to steer my guy haha
---
&gt; So you do not know what the gear gap looks like for those raids, yet you think the numbers are meaningful? Got it.
---
You're free to fickle with the "ilvl" selection at the top.
---
Warriors stay competitive even at the lowest ilvl available (50-52).
---
And it's not "a few raids". It's the grand total of every raid who actually bothered to upload their logs.
---
And it shows that a warrior who knows how to play will sit on top of dps charts.
---
But, feel free to substantiate your claims, which you haven't so far.
---
One of the best dungeon designs ever, so many paths to take
---
i dunno the 70k viewers really seem like nothing aye
---
LMAO.
---
Is English not your first language or something? I'm being exceedingly clear.
---
Yeah I expected it to look better. Green helm in RFK off a boss is an upgrade and looks better.
---
If you don't need it anymore because your teammates get better geared, it sounds like you don't need to be there at all
---
I'm not here out of anger. Our interactions continue to move the post up the ladder. How mad are you right now?
---
I mix it up in that order: A.C.A.B.
---
not really, the staff while not BIS has stats that i can use and was a huge dps upgrade. before i had loki's training stick or whatever. and the shoulder is the first piece of mail that i just happened to already have lol
---
As long as you don't try and solo tank without CC you shouldn't have any issue.
---
Spec doesn't really matter, and Arms is also one of the better specs for dungeon tanking.
---
I tried this and couldn't notice a difference.
---
I don't think there.is an add-on that does it
---
 I think he's guildmate was wrong
---
While I like that one--and agree that on reddit who gaf--I'd like to think it might matter in the future for this person, like in a professional scenario maybe and I've helped them avoid the typo.
---
you can prevent the "extra loot bag" by standing still when you hit the macro. Not always feasible, but its something to keep in mind
---
There are probobably a bunch of metrics they use, not just ip. If you just connect over a vpn they will know it's you because it's running on the same computer. 
---
Try a different computer on a  vpn that you haven't used before during a possibly unusual time for your region, that might do it.
---
Don't forget /pick
---
UK tbh.
---
It looks like it's just ElvUI.
---
Thats what I dont get, They literally admitted to playing their viewers and reddit. Asmon does it all the time
---
Mt. Hyjal would also be great.  There is an instance portal hidden behind a locked gate in the southern area of Winterspring with all the demons.
---
Theres a mage named Jimmyneutron that behaves like that. He got to 60 relatively quickly but 5 mins watching him play you know he has no idea what he\`s doing. Usually in vanilla hunters were the worst average players, pulling stuff with their pet all the time and not knowing really how to play because they are carried by their pet most of the time. But in classic I find its mages. They keep facepulling. Blizzard before tank charge is over. Complain that they always die and dont get healed after they pull massive aoe threat lmao
---
Also not counting the synergy &amp; mana/conservation from things like Clearcasting, Arcane Meditation, or Arcane Mind.
---
Or the +3% base &amp; +3% crit from Arcane Instability.
---
And also AP as you said.
---
Central and Eastern Europe are not mutually exclusive definitions, mr. Pedantic Wikipedia Geographer.

---
For Warrior, it's better to kill things slightly lower level (green).
---
Your time to kill is significantly better, you won't miss or be parried as much. You also won't take as much damage, so you will spend less time eating/ bandaging.
---
The warriors in that UBRS run had already won the carapace roll of Quin. One of them had already had 2 carapaces and Quin had said at the start of the run that he will reserve the item if it drops.. It's just a meme for Quin's guild to "torture" him whenever an item that he wants drops by not pressing pass right away.
---
There’s been a LOT of deaths since Vanilla.
---
The correct answer is it depends...
---
Tanks don't need to be constantly using them, you use 1, maybe 2, to build a high threat ceiling and that's it.
---
DPS...I would suspect you get more benefit from full uptime, but you should probably check out ShedoTheDruid on Youtube to see what his advice is on DPS gear/MCP.
---
Yep, replace garrote with any opener. As combat, i have it macro'd to sinister strike
---
Why is this a bannable offense? Server overload?
---
Ah, crap. Looks like it may have already ended. For a time, you could transfer from a high pop to a lower pop server. Not sure if it was possible to switch between PVE and PVP though.
---

---
Mmm gotcha. I bet that’s what happened. Dang. Lesson learned. Thank you!! :)
---
got it, thanks!
---
Don’t forget Cleanse. Low mana spell without a cooldown that eliminates magic debuts.
---
&gt;and I didn't want to stay in the barrens for 20 levels
---
If you get there at level 12 there's such an overabundance of quests between crossroads, ratchet, taurajo that if you complete all the beast/raptor/quilboar/harpy/centaur/oasis ones and ignore the handful of ventureco ones it'll rocket you to level 20~21 in a few hours (we're talking, like 5~10 hours depending on luck and personal focus)
---
From there you go to stonetalon and complete all the quests and it should bring you to about level 23~24 and you head to zoram'gar which will bring you to about 25~26, then you go to splintertree do all quests but satyr horns and papers and you'll be level 27~28
---
From there you go back to southern barrens briefly to complete the dwarf quests along the way to your real goal: Thousand needles
---
In thousand needles you do the centaur quest, egg quest, grimtotem spying, arnak grimtotem, grimtotem escort (only if it's up, don't wait around), test of faith, test of endurance (only if you quickly find a group) hypercapacitor dynamo (same as before) test of strength (again, only if you quickly find a group) and you should be about level 30~31.
---
Bam 20 levels where you're only in barrens for a very quick 8~10 and while on your way to the other zones it connects.
---
And from there you go to hillsbrad then shimmering flats then desolace then upper/central STV then arathi into badlands into feralas.
---
Of course, doing dungeons like RFC, SFK, BFD, and SM for their associated quests will pad this out even further.
---
I'd take it a step further, with rolling level caps. Start with a level cap of 20, then 30, then every 5 levels after that for like a month each. Season first clears of dungeon instances would be a pretty cool metric. Clear BFD with a group of 20s? Scarlet Monastery at 30? That would be pretty impressive stuff. Twinking without a daddy character. And the world PVP would be magnificent.
---
I think something like this could work with the right incentive, but I haven't figured that part out yet. Maybe some kind of meta-currency you farm from PVP and/or in lieu of xp when you are level-capped.
---
I hope I get this kind of luck!!! What did the charms run you on AH?
---
You should have seen rolls go out if the timer expired. If you were outside when it happened he may have rolled and won, or it might have defaulted to lootable on the body because you weren't there.
---
It’s because we all watched a video that said “fire mages are the best dps in the game”
---
If you liked the pet aspect then warlock is a lot of fun and has a ton of party utility. But like hunter before you get your pet, levels 1-10 are pure suffer with only imp available to you. Once you get Voidwalker your downtime evaporates.
---
Reminder for later
---
That's not true at all, ive gotten groups almost instantly for every instance past SM. In fact, I have people Psting me asking me to join their runs - yes, as a warrior.
---
anything's possible.  but if your character sheet is showing the exact same dps as the weapon is its clearly incorrect as there's zero chance you have 0 attack power
---
Some people don't know, and some people don't care.  When you are trying to get all those people together, at some point good enough is where you gotta call it.
---
Appreciate the concern my man. I'm doing good.
---
Dang, Royson is worse at the game than he is ugly.
---
Dont release if you die on a boss
---
How do I configure Details to tell me what my most efficient and high DPS spells are? I switched to the "My Spells" setting, but am wondering how to filter it properly.
---
Wow more streamer clickbait, can asmon fans stop fucking spamming the sub?
---
No one gives a shit about this scripted "drama" other than his fans and haters. Go back to /r/asmongold and leave us alone for god's sake.
---
Didn’t happen to me. Friend was using my battle.net for Overwatch, literally dcing me mid-dungeon.. 
---
Connection would have shown: Australia (DC) France (DC) Australia and nothing at all, happened a few times.
---
Can’t impact the economy in any way so yep
---
Check the classic wowhead for the full list. In my experience it is a good list for most dungeons. Almost all of the quests for alliance were in desolace. 49/50 is fine, since Princess (last boss) is 51. I personally prefer to be well into the yellow for dungeon bosses for dungeons I do, I don't like to get carried as I feel it will then be less likely to fail as I have to rely on others less.
---
I'm just leveling but yea so far I've been told to use a 2 hander. When I was using sword and shield I was killing mobs alot faster.
---
Post it on the realm discord and sub. We do not need a thread every single time asmon has a thought.
---
This shit is ruining my rep as a mage. Tom Selleck will not stand for this.
---
Free water and food for all. I no longer will take tips. I will no longer take more than 18s for a port, if any at all.
---
I'm a mage veteran, I never leveled AOE. Single target crit always. Yesterday I played with another WoW vet who was tanking, he said I had the highest DPS of any mage he has played with period. I'm was not spec'd for AOE.
---
FUCKING TIRED OF THEM SHAMING MY MAGE CLASS.
---
i've had a rough day too myself. Saw some clothie casting spells and aoe farming mobs. I also needed the mobs but there were other spawns so I just pm'ed him, saying something like can you gib food please, I'll leave the spot to you.
---
He replied: "wut"
---
The conversation was.. weird. I play on an EU sever and I couldn't understand anything he was trying to say since his English was so bad. After like 5 minutes he finally said: "priest no mag" and I realised it. I've been talking to a fucking pries the whole time.
---
Ah yes.. BEWEGLICHKEIT
---
I dinged 60 by accidentally disconcerting one of the farmsteads in wpl when i was actually trying to go ding 60 by discovering Ironforge.
---
Still don’t give a fuck.
---
Sure they could, but when it was there in actual Vanilla many, many years ago, it is obviously not a clue to any Classic+ content.
---
Imagine adding a winky face to the end of a sentence thinking you "gott'em", but you just look ignorant of how these things work.
---
I know as a priest,  lasher farming in DME becomes feasible around lvl 55-56 provided you have a decent +int set and spec deep into disc.  A mage could probably do it a few levels earlier.
---
But yeah,  DM is still a few months from.being implemented.
---
Warlock also has the appeal of being the other big AoE class aside from mages.
---
Eh, for the most part it’s a sarcastic reply that’s honest.  
---
It’s ok to tell someone that ganking lowbies is unimpressive.
---
Tits. Learning experiences. Gotta have at least one good Classic Noob experience. Thank you!!
---
I mean, revenge is on a 5 second CD, so much of tanking trash as arms is just spamming Sunder and tab targeting. 
---
He didn't include stance dancing to intercept and taunt adds/broken CC either.
---
He is 90% correct.
---
That is not how post move up the ladder.
---
Thank you very much. Yeti hide cave is finally bareable.
---
I could wait a full minute and I am still yanking aggro off these shit tanks in one global.
---
Not all mages are that bad....
---
App as being going a few weeks, and have had loads of downloads and great feedback from the app store. I have now released it on Android too, with some new features. All comments are welcome!
---
Even with arrows, the top end of the 10dps weapon would still be falling just short of the boomstick, I believe. Considering, you know, bullets. And white DPS is still vastly higher with boomstick, obv.
---
Melee weaving is a whole different conversation, and I mean, if you're going to melee weave for your entire leveling process more power to you man, but I don't have that kind of attention to dedicate to leveling.
---
Not trying to argue Boomstick is a good hunter weapon, but you're being severely hyperbolic.
---
Meet dwarfletics, my battle stance locked warrior.

That's why i just stick to guild runs.

Partially made up for with master of elements, but there are plenty of ways to manage mana to not need them. Dont forget that Evocation wasn't a core ability until late Vanilla. Arcane mind is also overrated af, its benefit is gone in ~10 seconds.

&gt;Or the +3% base &amp; +3% crit from Arcane Instability.

Which is where the 5% comes from.

Yikes

Respec to shadow form IMO, it's great for solo. If you have a consistent group and plan on doing dungeons almost exclusively, then consider holy. If you are doing any significant amount of solo content, shadow is just going to be a ton faster.
---
You can heal most dungeons up to ~60 in shadow; although it isn't optimal. Around 56-57 you can just respec to your raid heal spec, since you'll be able to do 60 dungeons and start farming pre-BiS, so you might as well start doing that as soon as possible and get some XP.

No, because it's your computer and they know it. The traffic is going over vpn but the information (including details about the computer battle.net is running on) is the same

Without blizz chipping in we only have OP's side and going by previous experience, I'd say he's omitting some details.
---
Why reply when you dont even understand what the post is about?
---
That's me in Uldaman
---
Type "/roll" into the chat, it will roll a number between 1 and 100.
---
Does this one still work? Last I checked there was no way to set focus target in vanilla.
---
How are you finding guilds?
---
All I can say is if you see a guild with like 10-15 warriors and 10-15 mages raiding stay away as those guilds will collapse quick.
---
 Ask "what's your ideal class distribution?"
---
If it's a nice mix then you're in good shape.
---
Is there a list of spells that are not learned from trainers, but rather items drops? i.e. Prayer of Fortitude
---
It's still manageable for anyone 12 and up. With hunters you track beasst and just try to always stay away of them on the minimap by hugging the side of the road accordingly. With a mage you freeze them and continue to run. Most classes have a way to help survive the run.
---
Zero warrior tank look in living. You might find someone to tank it now if you're lucky but the ones who don't already know will realize soon there ain't shit in there.... You gotta give them a reason to come.
---
I wouldn't even consider tanking it for 1 orb personally. Not worth the hassle.
---
Benediction
---
I can't believe Keanu is going back to Bill and Ted's adventures. That's why I have trouble taking him seriously as a tough guy. He wasn't even Bill. He was the sidekick.
---
Miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, dodge, miss. 
---
Your cat is a level 11 rogue.
---
Yeah I was the only warrior in that group that needs carapace but I let him have it.
---
Yes, the fact that people keep saying "THE POST HAD 15K UPVOTES CLEARLY WE CARE!!" shows that people took it seriously.
---
The fact that people still want Royce Gkicked for ninjalooting nothing.
---
People want Quin banned for going back on his side of the agreement of the ninajlooting that was staged.
---
Stop acting like you knew the whole time this was fake.
---
Bear tanks are fine. The only issue is the gear drought in MC and so they can have a hard time tanking later on, until you again find bear tank loot in AQ40(?)
---
But with gear they're very viable tanks.
---
I can't be the only one that has to do a full ring around the room to find it every time.
---
You should look up some suggested weapons in warrior guides because you should make sure to get a good weapon (rare) atleast every 5 level if you do not want to hit like a wet noodle
---
I have noticed FAR more healers this time around. Tanks are what are incredibly scarce right now.
---
Was trying to level my GF's holy pally to catch up to me, everytime I log on it groups are only looking for tanks, heal spots fill quick, or you see a decent few "Healer LFG post" in chat
---
The Giant Panda is seen as so valuable that the Chinese government has used them as gifts to other countries!
---
I haven't had it done to me personally, but I'd close it and continue on my way.
---
That was my reaction too. Endless vista of mushrooms. Follow which ones? I think it's a joke of some sort.
---
Undead here, gonna poor some for the homies who ain't here at Gallow's End.  Cheers bro!
---
Stay holy/disc and crush dungeons till 60 and continue to grind dungeons. 
---
Shadow spec is viable till endgame, even to heal dungeons. (Which is what I do)
---
I have yet to lose a tag on my druid with spamming a macro /tar (name of mob) /cast Moonfire. It's so satisfying getting the tag when there's a group there (with space) who refused to invite you.
---
such a heart warming post
---
I want to know how often you use the word "longsword" to make autocorrect sub that in for "long as".
---
I only wish that were true.
---
Imagine having 2 daughters, telling the internet about it, and then jerking off to asmongold drama lol.
---
Yeah this happened in BFA. My friends got AOTC literally week one of raiding and quit. 
---
This time I'm going at my own pace. Might have to find new gaming friends as this has become the usual now.
---
Yes, everbody should get a shot at that gold so that would be actually fair. There is no guarantee the pattern will be used and could very well end up on the ah. It's just ninja prevention.
---
You didn't answer the question, where's the insinuation that their times is more valuable than than other's?
---
I'm on my 3rd &amp; 4th 60 and the husband is on his 6th 60. We do 5 box though so there's that. Basically our 2nd run of leveling up characters.
---
Don't judge us. :(
---
ST is my all time favorite dungeon. Still remember the way 14 years later.
---
Even before group-cast, fort buffs suck up like 1/3 of your mana each, so a group rebuff is 2 drink cycles.  
---
Not really arguing with anything, just saying.
---
So I want to ask this.. because I’m curious. 
---
Another mage revealed that it’s like 9s for the reagent yo do a portal. Soooo why are you guys doing a 91s markup?
---
Well I guess I'd still be interested in seeing these DPS charts where elemental mages place #1 if you can find them because I've never seen anyone recommend or use that as a raiding spec.
---
I think you're kind of downplaying how important mana conservation is, and seems like you're spending 31 points for more PvP viability, but you don't even have shatter or Ice block to actually get the benefits.
---
&gt; Is every post in any subreddit you’re subscribed to “targeted” to you?
---
Yep, every single one. I like how personally you have taken a simple question of who they are and why it is relevant to the sub. You still haven't even answered who they are.
---
That's a really good idea actually, probably going to do that when entering STV or similar places, thanks for the help
---
Thanks! Some of these I never heard before, and I played vanilla through WotLK.
---
I may get gkicked on our next raid, but it will be totally worth it.
---
Git Gud Soon 
---
FTFY :)
---
Only level 41... I’m happy with where I am atm. Even got some alts at different levels. You only get to level your first 1-60 once, why not savor it, instead of viewing it like a chore that should be done by now, based on how others play?
---
Yes, every class have boe bis items, and every class needs money to buy those boes. If you win a roll on your bis, item, congrats, you just saved a lot of money! If you win a valuable boe you don't need, congrats, you just funded your purchase of the one you do!
---
The resale value of boes mean they have exactly the same value/utility for everyone.
---
The key is to put on a shield, you'll get invites from almost anyone. You can throw your 2her back on once you're in the dungeon.
---
Am I the only one who enjoys the dark landscape?
---
Yup. Got my 31 priest, 28 Druid, and 14 warrior.
---
Molten lava and all.
---
Look up the osrs system and tell me how that would not work for classic
---
Different game, same terrible initial level of CS. 
---
This week I opened a ticket for a name change, despite my name not being against the TOS, for harassment because it was close to another word that I didn't realize when I first started, but clearly someone in The Barrens pointed out to me and I haven't stopped hearing it for 40 levels. 
---
They refused to change the name because it wasn't against the TOs which I completely understand however the first level of Cs said that they would love to bring about Peyton in changes and that I should go to the forums and start a petition to bring paid character services to wow classic so that I could change my name.
---
How insanely out of touch can a customer service rep be to not understand the game that they are customer service for.
---
That makes sense. I guess I would do it just for the personal experience of it. (Not xp). Since I barely played vanilla I wanted to experience everything this go around. Looking at the drops I have better gear than anything I could get so maybe I can convince people by saying I’ll pass on all of it
---
Yea thats some dumb loot rules.
---
"Need on it if its an upgrade, unless I can sell it, then let me also roll need on it"
---
This is why I will avoid groups that make their own loot rules.
---
Is this still necessary? I haven't tried yet but as I recall there was an option to reset dungeons if you right click your portrait as group leader. Was that added after vanilla?
---
It literally is healing BiS and it goes for like 5-10x that.
---
In walks an undead toon with WotF
---
Fleshrippers don't have a chance.
---
I mean, it is his game experience.
---
To prove it is your account???
---
It's something between this and the angle I run in.
---
At lvl 38,39 you will be able to solo the first part, collecting things. For Cyclonian you will need help
---
Thank you
---
Are you not interested in end game much?
---
Mhm. I've done the run about 40 times since vanilla. All from lvl 1 runs, to wisp runs, to speed runs. I was just using the "Infamous meme" explanation of it.
---
There might a problem with your monitor, I'd check the settings and try to revert them to default.
---
Yeah what is this amazing technology you used? My laptop has a print screen button but I never touch it because if I print my whole screen I'll just have a piece of paper I can't play WoW on and no computer screen...
---
I hadn't. I went herb / skin to build up some gold with the idea of eventually switching to alchemy. I'll try and lean on my guildmates for mats to help our lowbies  until I can make potions more appropriate to my level
---
Actually 9x for EU atm
---
or I can just comment to remind myself because it doesn’t matter
---
What kind of monster doesn't have his soul bag as last bag?
---
It's probably more that he's usually logging into his account from NA but suddenly he's logging into it from Eastern Europe. For his account that's unusual activity that probably got picked up by Blizzard's algorithm as a sign that the account got hijacked.
---
However false positives are a thing and unfortunately like many big companies, Blizzard's customer service team probably don't have a proper channel for escalating false positive cases to be reviewed so that suspensions can be overturned. So unless OP gets on Twitter I don't think he'll get his suspension overturned. Companies only really start to act once you start using Twitter, annoyingly enough.
---
Which ones? There are endless mushrooms in all directions.
---
Always and every rpg...
---
As a mage, I am very familiar with the 1g reagent cost. 
---
*shifty eyes*
---
Those are the best kinds! That's another thing not being mentioned in here. YOU know YOUR cats and how they act way better than we ever will 😊
---
No, it was completely broken.
---
He built up combo points with shred and went for ferocious bite. Nothing unusual, standard rotation.
---
Gnomes are inferior. Otherwise they wouldn’t have been hated so much.
---
Idk never used those add-ons. I use clique, which will create those mouseover macros for you. The big difference is that you don't need to click on the frame to target them. It's exactly the same as what you've been doing, just without clicking your mouse. That little change makes a huge difference in quality of life as a healer.
---
Using clique is simple too, you just click on the clique tab in your spellbook, mouse over a spell and press whatever key you want to bind it to. Then you're done.
---
Yeah, the lighting and visual improvements (especially the water) are great! I love running around with my wand out.
---
Man, I wish someone had said this to me early on.
---
It really depends what's most important to you.  What is your end game?  Is it exclusively AQ40 and Naxx?  If it is, do you have a deep-seated need to top meters?  If you do, do you like tediously chasing stuff around, and relying on your baby sitters to keep you alive?
---
Personally, I just don't believe that most people are going to even play at the level where the hunter DPS drop off (which is real, but exaggerated) is relevant.  There's going to be a spot for you if you: 
---
1. Optimize your gear choices.  
---
2. Don't play like a jabroni.  
---
3. Show up for raids.  
---
 And that's really just PvE.  Hunter PvP in classic is just too good to pass up.
---
I had a guy message me "Suck my fucking dick" because I tagged a mob he was running to, before he could. He thought I did it maliciously to keep him from getting the mob. I explained myself and it terns out I was actually on the quest while he was just getting leather. He actually ended up apologizing to me and then explained how this OTHER character was doing it "on purpose". People are so weird.
---
BYO mats is common for expensive enchants - I got my crusader with my own mats because I farmed half of them (enchanter too).
---
I paid 9g and the guy I bought it from was the only one who messaged me willing to compromise when my trade message was “WTB Crusader enchant my mats 5g tip will come to you” and I was only level 52. The rest rest said “gl its worth more” and apparently there’s a bit of a cartel on my server with enchanters not undercutting an agreed price. The guy I bought it from then made me promise not to tell anyone else he did it for me for that price haha.
---
Truely, just charge AH prices if they are good for you (high) on the day. Or on a bad day (prices low) say BYO mats and tip.
---
!remindme 7 days
---
You should have seen my face when I got “chips” in a bar expecting fries.. all I could think was “cmon mate if I wanted this shit I would have stopped by walmart not a damn restaurant” 
---
Still laugh about that one.
---
Yeah, i understand that, just airing my general frustration about how this thread started.
---
I was worried because I used to put my birth year earlier than it was, because I was underage when I first started playing.  They didn't care at all.
---
Hey my nib, nothing personal taken. If you genuinely care, it’d take you mere seconds to figure any of this out with a simple search of the subreddit. If it’s nothing within your spectrum of ‘care’, the next post awaits you
---
It’s hard solo questing as holy. You’re probably going to be in a situation at some point where you can’t find a group and are going to have to fill time grinding/questing.
---
No they don’t.
---
Be careful not to cut yourself on all that edge
---
I answered it a little bit above but I'm basically just trying to get all my leveling out of the way before honor and BG's are released. My warrior is currently pre-raid BIS, but no epic mounts sadly. This is my last 60 for a while though.
---
add /hungry
---
that shits terrifying when your level 32 and see a skull undead stop and /hungry next to you.
---
oops i should probably have any idea of what is going on in the game lore before i try to assume what people are talking about
---
I wonder if using a VPN would also trigger this ban?
---
Ah, thanks! Found the shell of a UI online and tweaked the hell out of it. The addon is called Elvui, and if you'd like, I could message you a copy of my rogue's profile script for you to import. Since I switch between all classes and roles constantly, I wanted something that's a good general fit for all of them.
---
It was one of the few things I genuinely enjoyed back in retail, taking my Tauren Paladin /sigh, gathering a group in Org for "VANILLA BRD RUN, old fashioned way, every boss" - I'd get takers every time.  By that time Paladin was such a snooze as a tank I could tank, tourguide, and nearly heal myself through instance content (let's just say I needed a healer, but they didn't need to be any good).
---
So one BRD group we're in there, did the cell block and the Ring of Law and the rogue's like "are we almost done?  How many more boss fights".  Son, you may want to sit down...something like 20 more.  He bailed...but we found a replacement and finished.  I don't think I had a single group that didn't go into the Lyceum and apparently no matter what I said, naturally quickly ramp up to overconfidence, only to be despairing by the end of that room.
---
Good thing asmon has a 20 minute guide on how to ninja loot on his youtube channel
---
The fact that he added that pretty much means *he* knows mages are the new hunters.
---
The era of magetards.
---
I'm a nerd too, but missing a raid because of a suspension is just such a non-issue.
---
Being the type of person to throw a fit because an external force had them miss a raid, is an issue.
---
If you buy the charms on AH, you don't need much help to do the rest. Get an RFK run, and get some quick help to kill the Winy boi.
---
It’s like a right of passage everyone must go through.....basically equivalent to the “puberty years” one goes through in life
---
Nice to meet a fellow helpful mage :)
---
Swamp of sorrows, behind stonard
---
I don't think they're putting down hunters, but more making the point that there is a pattern of hunters rolling against pure casters on pure caster designed gear.
---
&gt;Mages roll Int cloth - Priests roll Spirit - and Hunters...well - they roll Everything. Stop it - it's not cool.
---
I mean...i got into an argument yesterday and got downvoted by hunters because I was arguing that cloth gear focused on int/spirit should be prioritized for pure casters.
---
The hunter logic was "i cast spells too"...ignoring that they're not pure casters and should be looking for agility over int and leather/mail over cloth.
---
I've seen hunters roll on virtually *everything* because they think everything is an upgrade.
---
do people actually press the buttons? everytime I've been in recently we just kills the bombs before they get to the group.
---
Yeah so many people in this thread are acting like DKP is this incredible system immune from corruption. It can be fucked up just as much as loot council
---
My Classic install is only 5.11GB
---
Saving this bc I’m new and it seems like you know what you’re talking about. I’m around lvl 25 rn
---
Functional hunter class? What was different?
---
That wasn't a suspension. That was a security check done via a pw reset, due to change in login location. It happens all the time.
---
Quality Shit-Posting is no longer an oxymoron.
---
&gt; just like res sickeness lasts longer and longer the more times you use a spirit healer to resurrect.
---
&gt;chat
---
I was just about to make the same comment xD
---
This is high effort? You're standards are more trash then this video. The editing shows no leadership and the music is terrible but does go along well with the choppy editing.
---
Just copy your interface and wtf folders from classic and do a full wipe and reinstall of classic only.  Replace the interface and wtf folders and back in business.  Should be under 7gb all said and done.
---
Nah
---
Uninstalled through bnet as well, pretty ridiculous it doesn't say anything like. Would you like to remove the application and all it's data or just the application.
---
LeatrixPlus. Addon with tons of quality of life improvements. One of them is automatically skipping the gossip option for bankers, vendors, flight masters, etc.
---
There is a lua command named /in x but wow disabled it.
---
Best source of essence of water is from getting ur fishing to 300. There are 6 pools in azshara on 1ish hour respawn. He cast has a 30% chance to get an essence so after a round I generally come out with 3-4. 
---
What I do is get the timers then log out by them and level an alt or manage my banks etc.
---
You don't neccessarily need new gear that is nothing more than just 'more stats.'  Blizz could have created gear that opens up new ways to place a class, or offer new strengths while introducing weaknesses.
---
Leveling as ele shaman but I've had a lot of ppl tell me enhancement is better to level with, but then you want to switch to elemental at lvl 40... I'm level 22 right now, is it worth it for me to swap to enhance just for 18 levels?  Or maybe better to just keep on with elemental the whole way?
---
Yeah that's a lot of gaming, damn..
---
This is So untrue
---
Yes, people falsely claim they were raped all the time too, far more common than the real thing, does it mean we should ignore those reports and assume they are always lying?
---
&gt;&gt; just like res sickeness lasts longer and longer the more times you use a spirit healer to resurrect.
---
&gt; wut
---
The first time in use the spirit healer to res, it's 2mins and goes up by 2mins each time until 10mins.
---
*Oh the ~~places you'll go~~ several different ways you can miss a target completely with a melee weapon*
---

\-.-
---
Ah okay
---
I was in Italy for a week and played WOW with no problems. I got back last night. and continued to play in Texas.
---
Non-vocal emote but I've had a few people stop mid-gank with a good ol /shoo
---
Yeah but you need decent dps and group awareness for that. As the healer I was put in charge of it all lol what happened was I aggroed and died first then everyone else eventually and ya group disbanded lol but I got my acidic walkers so I was happy lol
---
Thought so, this seemed abnormal
---
Nothing reserved means you can't need? I thought reserved meant party leader set it to master loot, looted his item and made everyone roll for the rest.
---
Thank you! Totally downloading this as soon as I get home from work.
---
&lt;3
---
They mostly just need more areas, and players need to opt to spread out.
---
The issue isn't always that there isn't enough area, it's that all the players are trying to do the most obvious content rather than going to one of the other 3-5 areas available.
---
Does minor speed increase enchant for boots stack with aspect of the cheetah?
---
Does minor beastslayer enchantment on a 2H axe apply to ranged abilities also?
---
I purchased more time 4 days before being banned, and was told I was getting a refund for my time. It has been 5 business days now and the charge is still there.
---
Ya gotta find you a mage friend!! If you were ally-grobbulus I’d have your back! 😁
---
&gt; But with lower paid and inexperienced employees.
---
Which would in part explain the response OP got to his ticket. This is some Walmart tier hiring practices going on with Blizzard. Fire the experienced, replace with part time interns. Sad reality.
---
You never owe anyone anything really. Not doing some things still makes you an asshole though. The 2 are in no way mutually exclusive,
---
I've been using VuhDo since WotLK.  It's been my favorite of the healing addons.
---
Haven't leveled a healer yet so I can't confirm, but it's been good to me over the years.
---
Take a break dude.
---
I'm so sorry someone's supportive post upset your fragile little equilibrium. 
---
/violin
---
Ye, i do a full wipe and i can't lose anything but settings in the game right? including addons
---
You’re so dumb that you have to cry to blizzard because someone else was killing quest mobs xD sorry you suck at the game
---
Same man, too many kiddies following their streamers around, and then the toxic pserver people looking to gank then.
---
Also, it's the only server with queues starting at 3pm EST when the kiddies get out of school. Even Herod has 4-5k less people in queue at primetime.

I have been playing with these guys for YEARS. But like man the pressure seems on... I just moved into a new place over the weekend, haven't finished unpacking all my stuff, and work a full time job.
---
Oh I didn't even notice I got 2 comments on the UI lol, my bad. The UI has been tweaked with an addon called ELVUI. By itself, the addon allows you to move just about anything anywhere, change their sizes, combines your bags into one, etc. I have other addons running of course, but that's the big one. With that addon, you can tweak things one by one on your own, download preset profiles, or download a profile then make your adjustments from there. When you have the program and find a preset you want to copy, you just copy/paste the info and your UI will change to it in an instant. If you'd like a copy of mine, let me know and I can message you the input string too, or if you'd like some info on how/where to get the addon let me know.
---
I hear a hello...  Am I taking crazy pills?
---
Just /1 and /4, got important stuff in another window
---
Don't be. Already established in thread OP was buying gold. You don't get suspended for logging in from a different location. You get suspended for breaking the rules.
---
haha! As a Pala healer no one asks me to attack things. :(
---
&gt;Whatever symbol everyone agrees on is sheep.
---
Sure, but the universally understood meaning is moon = sheep.  Bc moon = night = sleep = sheep counting = sheep.
---
That's very interesting,  thank you pal
---
he literally has a 20 minute vid on his defunct youtube on how to ninjaloot
---
I'm a 45 enhance shaman ready to regear and respec for casting, but I don't have any appropriate weapons/off-hand.  Is my best bet to just carry some SM library runs?  Or could I solo it since I'm ~10 levels over the dungeon?
---
Just downloaded it. Looks cool and I like that I can save builds.
---
Just curious...what exactly are those things in the icon?
---
Got 60 on my hunter and now in leveling a warrior that's currently lvl 19.
---
Reminds me of going to plaguelands in classic. The first day my group of friends went there for quests two of us got sick af. Creepy.
---
Its more along the lines that hes still live streaming online and nothing is being done. Further proof provided for you in OP.
---
It takes time to build relationships and form a tight community.  Classic has been out for 5 weeks.  Give it more time and put some real effort into working with your new guildmates.
---
There is autowalk?!
---
Shouldn't have hidden the character - NAME AND SHAME!
---
Lower your graphics settings.
---
The trick is not to jump.  If you do, you jump early and miss.  You can just run off and make the gap.  (obviously, at the narrowest point)
---
What do you need to do RFK for? part of quest?
---
I had him spawn right next to me like a week ago when I was fishing there. Didn't really drop anything good though.
---
I can't believe I had to scroll this far to see Gnomer.  I remember people hating that dungeon so bad.
---
Seriously. I’m leveling a pally healer alt through dungeons and I always have to practically beg for water to get it. 😟
---
Yea. That’s why you backup those 2 folders, it saves your settings and addons data.
---
But I play a rogue. I have to jump every time I do anything.
---
Then stop paying sub, and quit the game.
---
My only issue with instances is that I don't have a set group or anything and looking for pubs always ends up taking long cus of waiting for people to travel to the instance Everytime a group is made.
---
Smh, the time spent organizing my bags...
---
Yeah a lot of people see "reserve" as a red flag.
---
The exception being when you see someone in the high end for a dungeon and there's a key drop you know of.
---
/golfclap
---
I had a level 34 rogue put me on ignore because I told him he was too low level for our RFD group... Good riddance.
---
If you copy over the interface and WTF folders I think those settings should be preserved, at least for the most part.
---
Food for thought: if the best way to level is to stab yourself in the eyes, that's not very fun and you probably won't do it. Furthermore, if the best way is 100% efficient and the second best way is 90% efficient, is that really such a big deal?
---
Those numbers are not based on reality, but if you are not having any struggles leveling and enjoy yourself I say keep on doing your thing. Staying elemental means only one set of gear for ranged DPS and healing for instances. If you want to min max it may be worth spending the gold to re spec if you have a set of melee gear.
---
Deflect if you want. It's stupid not to use 2FA when it's offered
---
Guess people downvoted you because the truth hurt their feelings?
---
No harm in offering advise
---
Atlas loot phase specific loot does have some errors do I'd take it with a grain of salt. Bosses that are only summoned by the tier 0 upgrade questline and shown in the game and they are apart of the naxx pre patch etc.
---
Like in MC a lot of the good loot isn't supposed to be out yet like onslaught girdle and plenty of caster gear but they mentioned it would be too "confusing" to release loot in raids already out by tiers so it's just all out in one go.
---
Turns out Monopoly is the one who bought it...
---
Well Sh!t...lol
---
The funny thing is you don't even need to jump. If you run at the right spot you can literally just run off the edge and be fine.
---
You need to both not jump and do it in the wrong place to fall.
---
Okay cheers mate. Much appreciated

---
About Us: The Black Company was founded by a group of friends that first played together during Wrath of the Lich King. Our goal, is to form a tight-knit and friendly community and experience every aspect of WoW Classic.
---
What We Aren’t: A min-max guild. We won’t force anyone to spec a certain way, take certain professions, farm specific consumables etc.
---
We intend to give the most complete experience this game has to offer to everyone in our guild. Whether you enjoy leveling, dugeon crawls, pvp, or raids… you can expect to accomplish all of your goals here. We may take a more relaxed approach to raiding, but rest assured, our core members have completed all of the raid content in the past, and you can expect to do the same! Some things you can look forward to:
---
*Optional light RP to help with lore immersion
---
*Flexible raid schedule to experience end game content
---
*An active community
---
*An optional, monthly pvp event as part of an ongoing story
---
*Monthly guild events with prizes
---
Whether you’re an old vanilla player who missed out certain aspects the first time, or a brand new player seeing the game for the first time, is here to help everyone get the full World of Warcraft experience!
---
If interested in joining, go to the Information channel in our discord to read more about us and file out a quick application to help us understand who you are and what you hope to enjoy in WoW Classic. We look forward to meeting you!

Dkp and loot councils both have their good and bad side (tbh I think both suck and some versions of SK are way better)
---
Olm the Wise. Although, it's the same model as Winterspring owls but still, was happy to actually have caught a rare one. Comes with Dive and Claw and learnable Screech if you have previously had an owl that learned how to use that ability.
---
I’ve gone back and forth with no issues ....but not Eastern Europe
---
The other night in a pug MC we had about 35 people in a discord and one of them had their mic open and was making some small amount of noise.  I don't even remember what it was, it was very minor and unabrasive compared to most ear-aids you get when someone has their mic open.  After roughly 3 seconds of this, some random dude in the group pipes up and says "if somebody doesn't mute that fucking microphone I am going to fucking shove it down their throat".  And it's a good thing my mic was muted at the time since I burst out laughing at him about halfway through, because he sounded like every exaggerated cartoon nerd character ever.  Dude sounded like Milhouse from the Simpsons or something.
---
not sure what a sedona is
---
Does it interact with nameplates or anything?
---
Its extremely cringe inducing like 95% of chats lol
---
On my phone it’s just T-Mobile network connection at like 15-30mbps
---
On my pc it’s up to 400mbps but usually around 50-100
---
I really don't get the tank reserving HoJ... Those runs are so fast and even if you have to remake the group every run (which you probably won't) being a tank means you instantly find another... Reserving first Righteous Orb is fine imo, although I've seen advertising for reserving all which to me feels over the line... Wanting 20g (what they'd going for on my server) extra for tanking is okay ish, more than that feels meh.
---
Wait do you actually not know why people would lie about why they got banned? Most players of games with cheats or RMT are familiar with the "hey I was unfairly banned" posts followed by a smackdown. It's a running joke in some came communities. People lie to save face.
---
It keeps ya head warm my dude
---
In their 30's. You know, the average WoW Classic demographic.
---
Less sound effects, please.
---
Just depends on which ones higher then
---
Yeah, I realize that, I was referring to elemental builds in general. 
---
I have similarly never seen anyone advocating for an elemental PvE spec.
---
Yes it's a huge benefit of parry.  If you parry, the time to your next swing is reduced by half.  Occasionally it will mean you attack immediately so generally the bigger/slower the weapon the better parry is for offense!
---
Important tip for PVP as if you aren't facing someone you can't parry them.
---
I’ve been traveling all over Europe since classic launch playing on oceanic servers (NA). Have not had this issue yet but now I’m terrified of losing all of my progress.
---
Kinda did.
---
Yup you just get a longer ban for this. Right or wrong have to sit out a month.
---
Yeah it's been edited abit.Like those blurs and some color grading.

Deviate Delight Ally has 1 zerg guild and the rest are pretty tight knit. The server is progressing much slower than the others, too so people are just generally more focused on the community interactions. For example, our server first onyxia was a few days ago and it was a PUG. Deviate Delight. Chill Dad Server.
---
If other tabs are fine per the OP, it cant be bad pixels.
---
Hi, /u/Blekota
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dbh0nv/crossrelam_gold_trade_eu_ten_storms_h_eu_golemagg/).
---
Reddit has a rudimentary voting system in a way. When was the last time you saw a post about LFG, Transmog, Dual Spec on the front page of the Classic WoW Subreddit because people were vying for that to be added to the game?
---
Well obviously, it’s just that if you’re a rogue trying to sneak past don’t try unless that level range
---
Happened to me back in wotlk. I finally farmed all the mats to build a chopper. To sell it of course. Instead of 28k I sold it for 2,8k. I was so used to single digit thousands that I kinda sold it on autopilot. Was of course sold in seconds and I was devastated.
---
Wand Spec and Spirit Tap.  After that, it's up to you.  Personally, I'm going Disc from 10-60.  Good heals, good in PvP, good for leveling.  Just know you take longer to kill things in exchange for 0 downtime.
---
This seems super strange, a few years back (in WOD) I played American servers from EU for several months to play with some friends and never ran into an issue. Seems strange that they’d implement something like this, hope you get this resolved!
---
I know right? Not a week ago I swear I was seeing top posts left and right complaining about the addons that automatically send whispers and guild invitations. Now, OP personally asks people if they want to join and he gets downvoted.
---
The only issue I would have is that OP called him buddy again after he clearly told him not to.
---
I dont understand what the difference is between openly advertising that an item is on reserve and giving players the option of joining the group with that knowledge vs just starting your own and excluding classes that would roll against you. Its, in effect, the same thing.
---
What makes saying "X item on reserve" more douchey?
---
I will now change into berserker stance before making that jump haha.
---
Now this is a change I could get behind,  you should have multiple dances per race/gender.
---
it took me a while but here it is
---
Now that’s what I call insecurity!
---
I'm on my Warlock in desolace swimming. Another Warlock swims up to me, gives me unending breath (which I already had) and then is like "yo, could i get some water?"..
---
"Uhh im not a mage"
---
"Oh, lmao".
---
Succubus swimming right next to me same as him..
---
No I understand that. I don’t understand other people coming in to corroborate a story with similar ones when they have no gain.
---
Sometimes a thing is a thing.  The name of the plant (in game) used to brew the tea is Swiftthistle.  Beyond that connection, I don't know of one.
---
Hey there - today apparently
---
You usually need the entire group within range to make it worthwhile. You'll still end up using tab-sunder too, it really just depends on the situation, but it's a great way to make sure you have the initial threat on everything to give you time to build threat on everything.
---
That's true, that's the dilemma I have on my priest alt as well. I ended up deciding to satisfy my PvP desires on my hunter main and then heal raids, which is kinda the opposite of your goal, haha.
---
What do you expect people to do when their kids are in bed?
---
That's why I love gambling in this game. Very VERY quickly can it show you someones character.
---
As a tank, nothing triggers me more than a mage who doesn't start drinking the second they are out of combat.
---
I’m assuming this is for end game loot, because for 5 mans, if someone ‘reserves’ loot, I say fuck em. Which isn’t really a good outlook. But hear me out, I really think that if it’s an upgrade, you roll need. Otherwise, roll greed or pass. To me, that’s the way it always was (not to sound like an old timer harkening back to vanilla) but that was the common group courtesy. 
---
Now if two group members want the same item and one reserves it, I would just approach it like a normal person and talk it out. If you’re gonna get flamed for needing an upgrade that someone ‘reserved’ then I wouldn’t join that group. 
---
In all honesty, after writing this I’ve come to the conclusion that reservations should really be made in groups of friends or where there’s a definite understanding that no one else would need said loot.
---
A but I don't know why.
---
Petition to change Wetlands to Moist Barrens, sign below.
---
Made me laugh hard . Well done.
---
that dude is extremely high strung.
---
EVERYONE GET IN HERE
---
Everywhere
---
That's excellent advice maybe I should get back to grinding mount money on my warrior. I've had a lot of positive experiences and messages to run more dungeons with people due to my tanking.
---
Those two cows on the border of barrens/stonetalon multiple times and the troll quest just a tad north. Uhhgggg.
---
WAASUP?!
---
BRD is the perfect dungeon. The level of detail and amount of content is insane. It also has a bypass mechanic (Shadowforge Key/ lockpick) and many optional bosses.
---
Yeah, sorry I got so emotional...
---
CHEERS
---
Can do silverpine/hillsbrad, stonetalon, ashenvale etc. in to thousand needles/arathi.
---
On most of my characters I run WC once and stick to the other areas anyway.
---
Yeah its easy, just leave this subreddit
---
Shame we didn't get competent and intelligent CS like we had in original release.
---
Did you use an authenticator?
---
I live in Europe and play everyday on my NA account. Have been doing this for years, never had any trouble.
---
I'm even in a guild with people from the UK (all playing in NA), no one ever had any problems either
---
/spit does not make any vocal nor audible sounds :)
---
Well with backstap it's based off the % of your weapon damage. So +7 to your main hand would make your backstab hit harder.
---
Putting them in before actual BGs would be a mistake. You'd just get people heavily concentrating their honor farming in a few places in EPL and doing sandlol in Silithus. It'd be kind of cool for a bit but like BGs it'd ruin all of the world PvP elsewhere, though unlike BGs it'd be a server-destroying 24/7 lagfest.
---
"The name is pretty intuitive. It means that when you hover over the macro icon on your actionbar, it will show the tooltip (the spell data popup in the bottom right corner of the screen) for the spell being cast.
---
If you don't add #showtooltip then the tooltip will only show the name of the macro rather than information about the spell. It is, however, not mandatory. Your macro will function identically with or without it."
---
Excuse me, Cookies Cavern has a better ring to it.
---
THAT WOULD BE STEALING
---
Yup, it's not, lol
---
&gt; I have similarly never seen anyone advocating for an elemental PvE spec.
---
Most players are dumb. It is what it is.
---
The fact we get a version of the game where rolling ignites are thing again is going disturbingly under the radar. Rolling ignites are broken.
---
Kids like you are always incapable of looking at their own faults in things. Its his fault.
---
I gotta do my MC attunement cause I already did the Onixya one xD
---
Maybe even kill a few gnomes with him.
---
You’re already behind partner
---
Yeah, no this is stupid. That's how you get people ninja looting. If it's BOE, everybody needs.
---
Was gonna say this. Spent a lot of time in Jamaica and I can confirm, calling someone a buddy is derogatory in multiple ways. It's like calling someone a cock, or a dick in some areas, other's areas it's a lack of respect (which you need to show respect to get respect).
---
Hasn't happened to me, I logged in from Japan during my vacation a couple weeks back.

&lt;The Incredibles&gt;
---
INTRO:
---
This is the classic guild for the 2004 Boulderfist alliance guild The Incredibles. We are a strong community of gamers that still clear heroic raids in BFA. We also had a large SWTOR guild, a LOTRO guild, clans in Starcraft, Diablo, Steam, League of Legends, etc.
---
GOAL:
---
Make new friends.
---
Clear classic raids (just like we did in Vanilla)
---
Currently everyone is enjoying leveling, several of us are approaching 60, but all levels are welcome, over 60 people on during peak hours and 300+ accounts active in the guild.
---
EXPECTATIONS:
---
If we grow enough multiple raid teams might be a thing to allow those who wish to aim for server firsts to do so. That being said we aim for low drama with mature players. Websites:
---
https://discord.gg/ZSmGh4y
---

---
When you're rolling against 4 other ret pallies and 3 warriors for loot.
---
Am noob. Were those just a shitload of engi bombs and other various AOE spells? 
---
Also, how do you guys decide who gets the chest? Or do you just murder each other fair and square until there's only one left?
---
But it's still well enough designed to the point where its worthwhile to do this area at least once so that (1) you can get quests done and (2) you can get the key to unlock the efficient routes to the other areas.
---
Start running with specific players.  Ask in guild chat who wants to run X and if anyone is fun to play with them ask them more directly first.  Even back in my wow prime (read BC) even though my guild had 30-40 members and I was close with about 6-7 of them.  Its nice to put it all on what the guild does but you as an individual to establish bonds within it.  Part of why guilds are mass inviting 60's is because they need a bunch of people to make it work and then they wait and see who stands out.  But its sort of on you to stand out and find bonds within the guild.  Decide what role you want within the guild (more than just tank/heal/DPS, but that is a part of it).  Its possible its a guild thing, but these MC guilds need 40+ max level players they're not going to know everyone individually.
---
As far as choosing a guild at cap see who you end up running with end game and keep note of what guilds they are in.
---
Welp I pray you're not on the receiving end of of a ninjalooter. Unless you find it fun to spend a ton of time in a dungeon hoping to get single item drop, then finally seeing it, and it get stolen in front of you. Have fun!
---
There is a tooltip feature for the KoS and notifications if you see the guy (which can be deactivated or not), but I can't say i saw nameplates options
---
B because autowalk.
---
You're a genuine person :)
---
You don't get chips until you pay the man running the table...
---
!Remindme 14 seconds
---
I’m doing my best to break the “mage dumb as fuck” stereotype. I don’t AoE unless the tank has enough threat and it’s a ton of mobs, I make food and water and buff people/offer ports, etc. Sorry to all the vanilla hunters who had to go through this originally, but it fucking sucks to be looked down on. mages who watch streamers because they’re good are the fucking worst. I decided on mage half a year ago after a ton of research and never even intended on AoE grinding except at max level. I hate the stereotype.
---
Not sure what "countless people" you're referring to. I saw 1 dude say his account got temp suspended because he was mixing up his regions and it got overturned. There are certainly not a lot of people saying they got banned for RMT because they logged in from Europe.
---
I just use guilds to find players to group with faster. Sometimes they have mats I need and sell them to me for cheaper, and vice versa.  My guild just accepts everyone so the quality of skill can vary greatly. I'm definitely gonna leave this guild when I get higher level for a better skilled guild. I'm only 39.
---
Going out on a limb here, but thought why not? Mental gymnastics/devils advocate stuff is fun. So here goes.
---
I think it's something to do with the fact that if an item is reserved, then the person reserving it get it's at first drop, and everyone else (in other groups or w/e) get it if it drops AND they win the roll. The end result of this is that the person reserving the item will probably spend less time farming it as compared to the average player not reserving it. It's as if to say that my time is more important than yours so I should spend less time farming this item.
---
By all means, correct me if I'm wrong.
---
37 Mage, 35 Warrior, 33 Warlock.
---
ooo missed that one! will add to next version. Thanks!
---
As a guildless priest I get whispered all the time to heal. Most of the time if a tank stands out I add them to friends list. Heck if the run went great and was mostly because of you as a tank / leader id be inclined to join. BUT careful about who you invite. Just cause someone wants to join doesn't mean they should. In turn they represent your guild on your server. Who you don't invite matters just as much as who you do. GL!
---
I believe Tale does the same thing.
---
I start fights with warlocks every chance I get. 
---
Charge/intercept, hamstring, pop berserker rage, and park my fat warrior booty right on em.
---
Frost mages are the ones I cross to the other side of the street to avoid.
---
Blizzard CS has completely given up, It's clear that the minds that gave them their reputation as one of the greatest Customer Service teams in the world have departed long ago.
---
I also got banned for the same reason and the fact you cannot appeal whatsoever is infuriating.
---
Just get your guild to spam report your name, if enough do it then you'll get auto flagged and forced to change
---
ohh shit ok cool. so like right now i have that same SS macro without the showtool tip, but with this it will show the spell like it wasn't a macro so i can see the normal spellcast/damage info and stuff?
---
nice very useful thankyou
---
I just checked out a YouTube video on that and it looks exactly like what I need. Thanks!
---
&gt; Unrelated but how do you get your UI to look like that?
---
like a disaster?
---
not a vocal emote :) that one is just text-based.
---
Can you just specifically say how to config the layout pretty please?
---
This is really not hard to understand, I don’t see why people struggle with it. This is basic human behavior. Without external factors in play, people will pretty much always take the path of least resistance. So all you have to be is just a LITTLE bit worse than others, and you won’t qualify for that path. It doesn’t matter if shit specs CAN clear the content in a 40 man raid. It only matters that they aren’t the path of least resistance.
---
My hearth is set there for SM farming. Thanks for giving significance to an otherwise insignificant inn. Next round is for you and your brother.
---
How can she slap?!
---
thanks!  i had gotten it setup but couldn't figure out changing the button layout and anything so ill watch these tonight.  i really want to be able to fish while at my couch.  ive been having to watch tv on my second monitor instead of my 77" tv which has only been used once since wow came out...im not addicted i swear
---
I share this. And also eat fury warriors and undead rogues for breakfast. Seduce is great. 😎

\[H\] Fairbanks &lt;Serenity&gt; - raiding semi hardcore (tues/wed 7:00-10:00pm pst) - pvp
---
\[Fairbanks\] Serenity, is recruiting raiders. We are accepting all levels currently, understanding the game just released, that said we are looking for players who are going to be reaching 60 soon so they can participate.
---
**RAID TIMES TUE/WED 7PM PST**
---
**CLASSES IN NEED (classes in order of need)**
---
DPS – Mage, Rogue, War, Hunter, Lock
---
Healer – Priest, shaman, druid
---
Tank – 1 more off tank
---
Of course we are always looking for exceptional players to improve our roster. Please apply if you feel that you will bring something to our group beyond what we are currently seeking.
---
We are currently open to recruiting all levels, we understand there is an importance in life balance, and sometimes that means not everyone can attain level 60 within weeks of the game re-release.
---
**SERENITY**
---
Serenity is primarily raiding guild on the US Classic server Fairbanks. Our guild has a long history with our core membership dating back to before wow. Many of us played in and lead raids in top end guilds across both Frostwolf and Gurubashi servers. During this time and the previous raiding history we were successful in downing and subsequently farming content. Many of our members have also had quite a bit of success in the honor system and later in the arena system. Our primary goal as we return classic wow is to be focused on raiding with a secondary focus on PVP when the honor system hits.
---
We have had the fortune to bring many of our original core raiders and leadership with us. While our core is a dedicated group, we are always hunting for new talent as well as creating similar bonds that we have all made in the past years. Think you have undiscovered talent? We are willing to see what you can bring to the table. Don’t hesitate to apply just because you were not part of the original classic experience or are hesitant to join a “raiding guild”.
---
Our guild will be using a modified DKP system that includes decay and gear weight in order to promote awarding players with high attendance while still offering a mechanism for new players who join a way to get their hands on loot, avoiding the sense of “well I’ll never get anything as I joined too late”. We feel that raiders are a must, and will be treated with respect they deserve. If you have other questions related to our loot system, feel free to ask.
---
**OUR EXPECTATIONS**
---
In Serenity, we enjoy having a friendly and social atmosphere, while maintaining a goal-oriented raiding environment. Once raid begins, we expect raiders to be focused and prepared; this includes preparing for boss fights and bringing plenty of consumables (in times of abundance, will be provided via a very transparent guild bank). We value skill, dedication, discipline and in an effort to maintain raid cohesion and keep turnover to a minimum, we are looking for mature long-term players.
---
**REQUIREMENTS**
---
Discord voice chat client installed.
---
Experience with addons such as Deadly Boss Mods (other class-specific addons may also be required).
---
Be a team player, this means having the ability to follow instructions and handle constructive criticism.
---
**RAID SCHEDULE**
---
Serenity will be raiding two (2) days a week, from 7:00 to 10:00pm PST on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Raiders are expected to have consistent attendance, while our DKP system will allow for some flexibility in that, we want to have members who join play with us, that is the point. We also understand real life happens, our philosophy has always been RL &gt; WoW. We, therefore, do not have a defined attendance cut-off. More raiding = more loot. Long term absences result in greater DKP decay.
---
**APPLICATIONS**
---
Please contact Enot (Enot#1820), Kalik (Jirad#1207), Banditkid (Slinker#1101) or Azuir (Azuir#1239) in game. You may also reach us in discord (Enot) Outzbad#9404, (Kalik) Crena#3072, (Banditkid) Bandit#3263 or Azuir (Azuir#3749)
---
Got ignored because i refused to join a ZF spellcleave. This is ridiculous
---
No, it's because this type of activity triggers their account sharing detection.
---
/console screenEdgeFlash 0
---
This man just completely annihilated mages. You didn’t have to do em like that bro.
---
That one jump that you actually don't even need to jump for.. you can auto run right across it and be fine. Or maybe it's just because I'm a tauren?
---
Most dedicated players have already joined guilds unfortunately. Your recruitment drive will be an extremely tough process.
---
Doesn't look like he has a soul bag at all
---
This is what I feel like a lot of people don't understand. I think BRD is cool, but it's damn near impossible to find the time to dedicate to it. I'm an adult with a full time job, as well as a wife and kid. It's really hard for me to commit to something that takes that much time and effort.
---
It's really irritating to see people with infinite free time(I assume) talk about "spoon feeding," because others would like to be able to occasionally run a dungeon that doesn't take half a day.
---
I've been xmuting undeath to water every day since I got the pattern to drop. It turns 80S into 14G every day. I literally print money.
---
Yeah that's what it seems like I actually haven't used macros for abilities.
---
You need to occasionally tame other pets and keep them for a bit to gain higher skill levels of pet abilities like claw and bite.
---
cringe alert!!!!
---
I use the:
---
    #showtooltip Cheap Shot
---
    /cast Pick Pocket
---
    /cast Cheap Shot    
---
And if i try to do that on a target without pockets it just won't cast Cheap Shot, is there another way of doing it? Just thinking that it must be annoying AF if you have it on all your openers.
---
I switch to ele at 30. I wanted to blast people with lightning bolts and carry around 1 set of gear. I wish I would have done it sooner. You have to drink more but it’s not bad if you’re smart about it and use the 5 second rule add on to help manage your mana regen.  Just make sure to get the improved stoneclaw totem talent - it’s a lifesaver. Dungeon dps is pretty great as well even though I prefer healing. World pvp survivability is amazing - I literally cannot die 1v1 to mages, locks and warriors (warriors have to be red or skull level to kill me) unless something goes really wrong. Rogues don’t bother trying to gank me.
---
You’ll also appreciate finally getting elemental mastery more. Man that talent is so much fun.
---
I've leveled both a Shaman and Warlock to the 20's and need to commit to one. My main sticking point is end-game gear dependence. So far, I enjoy Warlock more but from what I understand Shaman will be much more comfortable at 60- not as gear dependent and less competitive for gear during raids. I'm mostly interested in PvP and want to raid to support that.
---
Imagine naming your guy for the explicit purpose of booty bay shenanigans. Admirable.
---
Dunno if Blizz will do anything about it. The guild seems to get away with a lot as it is. Unfortunately rigging the economy isnt against rules, as far as I'm aware. As long as rules aren't broken obtaining the items.
---
You are a worthy adversary! I hope to see you on the field!
---
Lok'tar O'gar!
---
I'll take that into account funnily enough I've only had healers ninja loot so far from my experience.
---
Not a vocal emote :( In hindsight this should've been an "audible" emote list so /clap could be included.
---
InfoWars is nothing but a conspiracy website. Spinning facts and things that are technically true like this as part of some whacko conspiracy is the oldest trick in the book and not InfoWars being 'right'.
---
not a vocal emote :)
---
Those sweet sweet triprunner dungarees! BiS until /6  days played
---
I was counting the one that is supposed to be healing.
---
I've boon looking for a tutorial on this, thanks!
---
How much mobile data it consume per hour? I try this (worked for me) but consuption was 1gb - idk why thst much expecting around 50mb max/hour.
---
my guild has been recruiting people that join our 5 mans and 10 mans that do well.  if anyone does anything shady they get the boot instantly and anyone who joined with them. we gotta keep our guilds rep up.
---
the key to enjoying the guild you are in is making friends with the tanks and healers, if they invited you that's the best way.  you want to be on the list of people that get asked to go into groups and not just a random person in the guild.  especially if you are a rogue or mage because there are just so many
---
God damn dude I’m not your fucking ask Jeeves. 2 people posted here that it happened to them and a few others said things similar happened. Additionally, people posted in the other threads mentioning similar experiences. It’s pretty clear the first dude straight up paid for leveling. The other dude didn’t seem as likely. But nah, you’re right, this literally never happens to anyone ever and OP is clearly lying.
---
I’ve had my account locked immediately after unlocking it and had to talk to CS to get my account unlocked when I travelled to Korea. I’ve never been banned but I don’t have to have a child’s imagination to understand it COULD happen.
---
You don’t have to (and aren’t meant to) clear all of BRD every time you run it.  They even give you a key specially for skipping part of the dungeon.
---
Even if you need the last boss, doing Incendius -&gt; lava hop -&gt; Lyceum -&gt; Emperor is definitely under an hour.
---
All the other bosses are quicker to access than that.
---
I would share that with you gladly but unfortunately my game time ran out and I've no money to buy it at the moment. But I will within the next 2 days so maybe then :)
---
Orrr you could google it yourself.
---
Edit: I googled it and you cannot do this without an addon. I completely forgot you need an addon that lets you do this. Anyway it's called RandomSay. :)
---
Unless I'm mistaken the place is no different in retail than it is in Clsssic.
---
I don't *think* that place has changed in 15 years.
---
That’s also how people who need to equip the item get it.  You don’t need a bit of gold.  Stats matter much more for that person.  Have some decency.
---
Yeah you’ve got to hit it twice. I’ve noticed this as well. 
---
What I usually do is go ahead and press the macro as I’m approaching the mob I plan to ambush, so the dagger is in MH ready to roll once  in range behind them. Often I’ll go ahead and get the dagger ready to go as soon as I restealth after killing a mob, or after a pull in a dg. Makes kind of extra mini game you play with yourself, try to plan your openers ahead and have the right weapon equipped before you’re in position. 
---
As far as the SS sword macro, thats a button I’m spamming usually right after the opener anyway and since weapon swap isn’t on the global it swaps it as fast as you can press the button, so the sword is always swapped back in by the time global is off and SS is usable. So that one just kind of naturally happens. 
---
My macro is: 
---
.#showtooltip ambush 
---
/equipslot 16 DaggerName
---
/cast pickpocket 
---
/cast ambush
---
Remove the . in the tooltip line, the pound symbol fucks with the formatting on Reddit lol.

Imagine hundreds of fully grown adults actually caring about what some random streamers and their friends do in a 15 year old video game to the extent that it seriously bothers them and they spend hours fuming about it. 
---
Just imagine it. A full grown MAN reacting like this to something someone playing a videogame did. 
---
Truly embarrassing.
---
There may be players that would rather join a group and accept they dont get to roll on one of the items they need (or maybe they already have it) vs not even be invited to a group at all. At least the option exists
---
You are especially dumb aren't you? Don't whine to anybody when you roll greed on something and the person who won while rolling need posts it to the ah.
---
Damn. Well thanks for the answer and sick name btw
---
Rent free
---
I wish I was Tom Bradys kid.. Not because of the money, but the make out sessions
---
A) that's a great druid staff for cat form.  
---
B) personally, I put everything I find thats BoE, on the AH, for vendor price +1/2 (or comparable to other postings of same item, if there are any.)  if it sells, cool.  if it doesnt, then i vendor it.  Blues I do the same thing, but at Vendor Price x2, minimum. if i get it back, i ask around in trade trade chat first, then vendor it if there's no takers.

As a cloth wearer who pvps I hate everything about this story.

When I do one that's not just vocal emotes I shall add it in :) I always forget about that one when I RP
---
Got a free membership, saw her in recommended, looked at her stuff, all of it is troll videos
---
It's a trap.
---
Yeah I know! I wish we could name them but I'm content with the exclusivity of generated names.
---
I went there for the Tarren Mill turtle soup quest and still had to kill about 50 turtles to get 10 turtle meat. Definitely buying it on every alt I create.
---
Shadow is fine till endgame, you can easily heal any 5 man instance as shadow as long as you are aren't underleveled.
---
Just go around and do quests until like 52~ then you can hit BRD and get some pre-raid BiS gear.
---
They use mana for it. It takes a chunk of mana to make. If it's the best food he can make and he's around that level, it probably took about 30 seconds to make each stack. It's not a huge inconvenience to make food/water, but it does take some time, especially multiple stacks.
---
It's nice to tip but not expected. 5s for a stack of the best food at 60 is also acceptable, so don't think you didn't tip enough. Most people don't tip at all.
---
Lots of mages just give out their stacks to the nearest person before logging off. Don't s stress over mage food.
---
Wtf is this post.
---
This is a list of Vocal emotes only :)

Tell me how you feel after 50+ runs and no HoJ drop.

I label them as a ninja and move on.
---
Why do you have to insult me? This is just a video game. Stop focusing on pixels so much and enjoy the game. Dont whine when someone needs on an upgrade you want because they want to sell it.
---
Both are pretty gear dependent honestly. I most play lock (49) and shaman (27). Myself and my friend who is a mage have had a pretty easy time getting a few pre raid BiS for cloth. Really depends on your play style. Shamans will be in higher demand for endgame raiding I believe.
---
Someone pry knows a lot more than I do but from what I have read, PvP gear for warlocks is quite uncontested. Like the dungeon tier set (that looks awesome and has neat effects) is not great for raiding or PvE but amazing for PvP because of the stamina and defenses. 
---
I chose warlock personally because the leveling is smooth and gets really fun at lvl 38 drain tanking. Can take on 5 mobs my level and it’s really fun! I’m not good at it but makes for a good experience.
---
I do not have this issue. Found a great guild. Maybe you aren't giving them a fair shake? Or your expectations have created a situation in which you dont see the good. Also, check out official Discord and forums for guilds... There are a lot of serious raiders out there "bis"-ing it up.
---
Gotcha, missed that
---
Yea i'll double down and say the same thing. That was my build as an Offtank for a Naxx guild.
---
seriously what the fuck is this post. why do people post this kind of shit?
---
What’s that buff timer add-on to the right of your character? Pretty sweet it shows when your blind is going to end too without having to target them.
---
I don't unfortunately but that's awesome enjoy the ride man, congrats
---
I am literally crying right now...
---
If learn how to use excel's "Solver" add-in it will tell you the best items to equip from a given list
---
This seems like something that I need to start doing...
---
You need to look up spell coefficients, it is based on cast time, area of effect vs. single target, hybrid damage, etc.
---
It is a flat bonus with linear scaling, so if you have a 50% coeff on a spell and +100 spell damage, it would be a flat 50 bonus to the damage; and +200 spell damage would be a bonus of 100 damage.

Traveled to lochmodan and then wetlands. I am now 24 from making it too Menethil harbour and the large amount of glow quests in wetlands has me keen for some solid questing !
---
The red flashing is a built in option that I think certain addons mess with. Turning the option off helped when I was running a certain addon on retail so maybe it will help here. I forget where in the options it is but I think I saw it under interface -&gt; Combat maybe?
---
google classic wow spell coefficients
---
You look great though
---
If it's not important at all why do you care about this situation? That's a pretty obvious contradiction. It's 15 year old pixels, so who cares who got the item, right?
---
LMAO this guy isn’t the brightest, is he? The cat literally chomped at the screen at one point. And just because he isn’t using his claws doesn’t mean he can’t damage the monitor. LUL.
---
I'm totally for that as well. Hell even something like 10g cap would be tolerable as that's not too hard to farm up quickly. 2 respecs a week at 20g is a helluva lot more tolerable than 100g.
---
So what? It's still evidence of warriors doing competitive dps if not top.
---
In gear way below what you think necessary.
---
So, if some warrior can it mean that it's a matter of skill.
---
&gt; Your link also shows the top ranked rank as a druid. That doesn’t magically make druids better end game tanks than warriors.
---
Yes it does. At MC level druids are very competitive tanks.
---
lvl 50 (51?) and up will be "green" for 60's and basically free honor. That's what he's referring to.
---
I agree I hate mages with a passion.
---
That guy was an asshole too though lol.
---
I've only ever lived in southern states (Louisiana &amp; Florida) and pretty much never hear anyone use it.
---
I mean why is it so hard to hit spacebar before you walk off the edge? All these people here jump challenged kn WC but like...its not a hard jump.  You have to literally try to fall
---
woooow that's seriously fucked up ! I really really hope OP just had bad luck with the blizzard guy who treated his request, and someone else will unlock him .... this DEFINITELY does not deserve a ban, no discussion here
---
Got it, thanks bud!
---
Priest is like the 3rd most popular class right now, especially on alliance it seems. Easy to level, very versatile. I expect we'll see a lot of this problem, but a lot of people will get to 60 and realize they can't just swap between shadow and holy easily, and that shadow will really never be a raid spec. We'll see how that plays out.
---
Uncle  **Hamuul**  wants You!
---
Sure dude. Whatever helps your argument. Edits are shown on reddit. Prove where I edited a comment
---
The way I understood your comment, based on context, seemed like you were saying that it is widespread and prevalent, and that justifies the automatic victim-blaming. Please don't be so intellectually dishonest as to act like that is not a legitimate reading of what you said or that you did not already know that.
---
“I blame other people for my inability to realize offense is a personal response, rather than a collective agreement.”
---
Haha dunno why this gets funnier the more I look at it xD
---
The only difference is that the new pet will be at Loyalty Level 1, and need to level up to Best Friend again.  Once it is leveled to Best Friend, it will be the same.
---
(The caveat here is specific pets with different attack speeds or "caster stats".  For more info on these, Google "petopia classic").
---
How are u turning your screen so fast.
---
Awesome, thank you for the info.  I'm going to roll 100% with bear.  It's just always been my favorite spec in wow, as long as I can tank dungeons and not bring my group down I'll be happy.
---
Fuck I've been trying to figure out how to change it forever
---
Whenever I'm in a boat it's dark as shit
---
Everything about WoW has always been spoonfed to the players lol. That's what distinguished it from the old school MMOs.
---
That's assuming that's what the OP needs, i.e. an extremely situational and honestly weird edge case. The drop in armor isn't exactly meaningful either to warrant a replacement piece.
---
Devilsaur is still the best gear you can get as a fury warrior by a landslide.
---
Because the honor system and rewards will be implemented in p2,  but battlegrounds not until p3.  What this means is that the biggest pvp nolifers are going to be living in the lvl 50+ zones for 12+ hours a day for months killing any enemy they see as they grind out their PVP ranks because it will be pretty much their only available option to farm honor.
---
Must be your server, because it was still 2004 in the Barrens last night.
---
Hate to break it to you bud, Everyone needing on expensive BoE is pretty standard.
---
I don't understand. There's nothing wrong with having two WoW accounts, one EU and one NA, on one Blizzard Account. That is what they encourage you to do.
---
And now I have to explain to my coworker why I just broke 2 hours of silence by laughing like an id10t
---
That's true!
---
No /clap or /golfclap?
---
I guess it's not vocal, but it does have sound.
---
This is when you start a fight while kiting a mob with 1/4 xp
---
They haven't said anything to indicate that they will, and the general consensus is that they won't.
---
They want to keep Classic as close to the Vanilla experience as possible.
---
Don't forget blink
---
All melee items lol
---
its in the north west, its rainy, tree lovers and everyone always forgets about it
---
its the PNW baybay
---
Mages AoE farming continue to be the premier gold farming setup.
---
I love to do something similar against mages - Lil' bishes thinking they are  invincible and have all the tools in the world.
---
Until you stun their sorry asses when they are AoE farming 10+ mobs and they blink when facing the hoard of mobs to get out of the stun.
---
Only to get erased by all the mobs in 0,1 second and lie there in their corpse wondering what happened.
---
Something something \[Dwarven Tinder\]
---
Man I love the Design of Skeram!
---
I think you might have downloaded bfa I did same by mistake trough battle net launcher
---
Nefarious Buckler, yep.   Mailed it to my tank alt, lol.
---
You're not a warlock!
---
You'll get instant queues for whatever battleground you want as the smaller faction, which will allow you to manipulate the pvp rank system.
---
I remember back in the day only being able to play AV maybe once a month, sometimes not even that, because the Alliance were coordinated and small enough to  boycott the whole thing. The Alliance pvp guild also mostly dictated whether you could play AB or WSG that day; either play THEIR battleground against their premades, or wait ~1 hour for the alliance PUG queue to fill.
---
Told myself I was going to sleep after a BRD run cause I was exhausted but I was 130xp from getting 56 at the time so I killed a single zombie in Western Plaguelands (where I was questing after) and was like time to pass out.
---
Find me a weapon that has a damage range that looks like your second example. You can't, because it literally doesn't exist in the game.
---
It would be an interesting thought experiment, but it falls flat because it doesn't exist in reality. It's a little ridiculous that you would even pretend this is a situation that could happen in the game.
---
Number 1, I feel is a wash since forms let you ignore mismatched clownsuit armor, too.  And I do see my gear around town a lot.
---
Number 2, yeah...  Balance needed the rework it got in TBC
---
Number 3 is a feature, for some.  I get satisfaction out of using a large toolkit in creative ways.  Custom macros help, a lot, as does Druid Mana Bar.
---
Number 4... I think maybe tanking isn't your calling, and that's okay.  But more loot competition is balanced out by the fact that you can run an instance twice in the time it takes a DPS to find a group and run once.  And if you're good at pulling, wipes are super rare.
---
Mine is red with a white cross, actually cool.
---
Not bad for a bunch of portuguese monkeys.
---
Olympia
---
Pet pulls arent a big worry anywhere. I'm just helping the mages be more efficient with their blizzards.
---
Will my cat ever learn any new abilities? Right now all he does is growl.
---
Bear is fine, if not good. It’ll out threat warriors with early gear levels but you’ll start getting smoked by warriors once they start getting MC gear all the way until some good gear starts dropping again in AQ.
---
It’s extra work for sure, and there’s some fights that you’ll have to let a warrior tank because of shield block (you’ll be fine in every dungeon), but you have some flexibility and can always do some reasonable damage in cat when there’s nothing to actively tank.
---
C, because i keep to the right for some reason :P.
---
I don't believe they plan to do balance passes or change the R14 grind.
---
TBC was sort of the next balance pass for Vanilla.  I expect if there is a balance pass, it will either be TBC, or else it will be during new content.
---
way she goes
---
Standard? Then why is asmonguild getting thousands of dollars off one of his guildies rolling need on an expensive boe? Why are people calling him a ninja when it’s pretty standard? Lololol
---
What about /roar or /cluck?
---
Wot reference?
---
You can still throw out an aimed or multi for damage? Don't have to run yourself oom.
---
hmmm :/ just tested, /hi &amp; /hello have vocals but /greet and /greetings does not. (tested on female and male orc)
---
Eh, threat is such a pain and people ignore marks anyways. As a tank I usually just mark skull and hope people figure it out.
---
Also, don't be afraid to mark moon yourself...tank is probably the only person that'll respect the mark but he'll appreciate the effort.

My favorite dungeon run was with 2 undead in SFK rallying before boss fights with /train.

This is actually the problem, people think it is a super easy jump and just go for it, but the landing zone is shaped like a V, if you are a bit to the left or right then you miss. If you take a moment to turn your camera before you jump then you should never miss.
---
Yea thats the downside of people who wanna take their time and stuff. Respawns are terrible.
---
&gt;Guy is setting up his own loot rules so he can benefit from it.
---
I mean...he's suggesting a set of rules so it's clear.  I don't agree with "need on BoE" and not being able to ever roll for off-spec, but at least it's clear.
---
&gt; Wants others to only need on upgrades but then also wants to needs on things others can use? 
---
What?  No...he said everyone needs on BoE and only need on BoP if you can use it for main spec.  Those aren't conflicting rules, nor are they selfish rules.  
---
I disagree, but they're not selfish.
---
I literally have no idea what you're going on about...i'm saying that a macro to announce loot rules isn't inherently a bad idea, because different people have different approaches.
---
Aww &lt;3 You're not the problem bud. It's the ones that lifetap down and sit a breath away from dying that are. Appreciate you!!!
---
Mobile lol, ty
---
Yea that’s basically what I have too except I have the swap back to my MH sword in the Ambush macro. I think your method is probably better in case it fails.
---
Amen to that. I had the same problem. I also spent so much time exploring, and I never looked things up online. Everything was trial and error or learning from new friends. Nowadays I have a better grasp on the game and tools available. This time around I am more interested in PVP at 60 than in real vanilla, and since we are waiting on phase 2, I don’t feel rushed. I cant decide what class I want to play most, so I’m going to take some of these alts to 40, and decide from there. 
---
I also have a healthy roster of professions going. 
---
The hunter is a gatherer. Herb/Skinning maxed. 
---
warrior is bs/mining 
---
Priest is tailor/enchanter
---
Lock is herb/alchemy (I’ll drop herb for engineering later probably)
---
Shaman is going to be skin/lw and also drop skinning for engineering eventually. 
---
Not sure about the rest yet. Still working on it. 
---
There’s just so much to do! Gotta love it.
---
If you honestly think 1 talent point to give you extra rage isn't worth it in every build, I think you're playing the wrong class. It's the best of the two rage generation talents in the Warrior trees, and generating more resource to consume is the best possible talent point for literally any purpose you can think of for a Warrior.
---
More rage means more damage, and it also means more shield blocks, so it increases all of dps, threat, and survivability. There is no single other talent point you can spend that does that.
---
The fact that he's drunk is kind of a an "excuse" to ramble random stuff, you know, like a real drunk guy would be x)
---
Yeah it’s got like 85 cause all I did was stamina, armor, claw, bite, prowl, growl, figuring I’d get resistances later once I figured out optimal raid spec and get my mount money in order before then.
---
But your name is Dagr!
---
you done goofed specking holy that early
---
Guilds already exist in four forms. Hardcore ones where they had a history together, and now have 50+ level 60s and can clear MC &lt; 3 hours, ones that are friendly and invite everyone and have 280+ people, about 30+ level 60s, and because of the number game will succeed,  and then you have the guide that are  just a bunch of friends hanging out and don’t invite anyone mostly and hover around 20-60 people of relatively high level. Finally you have the ones like you doing which will fail: selective, late to the game, not open, too cautious. These are let by a personality type who wants to lead at all costs and can’t realize he is behind the curve.
---
Lol seriously. Its funny to see some posting that the WoW community created the term twink and thats the origin.
---
whichever one has less  because i feel bad for them.
---
You're all good :) still a solid emote.
---
I got a forced name change back in retail vanilla for a priest named Medicare. Was lame.
---
There are mobs in Blasted Lands that go invincible and stop attacking when low health. Knock one low, then start shooting.
---
Get that 55 out of here.

And it's their right to do so. Look, I'm sorry you are upset that some people don't believe everything they see on the internet.
---
Is that rogue wearing whitemanes chapeau?
---
Windows Snipping tool quality is pure ass. It's all about that Greenshot!
---
No Earthshock though? It's been my go to/spam spell so far. Even using a macro now that transforms back from ghost wolf and casts Earthshock...
---
40+ most likely. You won't get much more damage from skills and the lack of quests will likely force you to go after barely yellow quests that will make it hard for you SoCommand to do damage due to frequent parry/dodge/misses. Also weapon updates from quests become harder after SM.

The mages that know what they are doing will quickly get sorted out of the flavor of the month aoe grinders. After they realize they have no idea how to mage, they'll drop it to roll rogues for ganking and you'll be able to raid in peace.

This and I just want dual spec. I would play my Druid again
---
So either two spec or a PvE/PvP spec. It makes the game a lot more fun
---
Why do you even roll on a PvE server? I just don’t get it.
---
Only hat I’ve had drop thus far lol
---
when, not how much.   I can plainly see how much.  There is something driving that economy on your server that's not on another server, and it's not the spicy chilly.
---
ZG has some decent bear tank stuff.  Hell even a ton of mc nonset learther is decent tanking gear.  Problem is DPS want that as well.
---
Today I learned: people take Alex Jones seriously.
---
Moonglade. That one quest up there looks spicy.
---
Problem is, first you need to find the people then run back at it. It's different froms traight up skipping a saved part.
---
Also, we are talking about full run dungeons here ( since we are all talking about sprawling dungeons and so on). Multi-wing based dungeons exist also in forms of Scarlet Monastery as well other later dungeons, like Dire Maul, Tempest Keep, The Icecrown Halls, The end of Time to name a few from newer expansions as well.
---
Without even mentioning people that don't want to skip bosses
---
Phase 2 adds honor points for PVP, but no PVP battlegrounds. So imagine all the times you've been killed by the other faction today, and then realize that they were killing you for funsies. There is no reward for killing people out in the world right now. As soon as phase 2 drops you become a walking honor point target and opposing players are going to be practically fighting each other off to kill you first. This will be less of an issue when the battlegrounds open in Phase 3, since honor grinding will become more efficient in battlegrounds. But for the entirety of phase 2 you're a walking honor point vending machine.
---
Hunters are fine, especially if you min-max trinkets with feign death, which a lot of people don't. There's an exceptionally high skill ceiling.
---
They're also very buggy, which is a bummer. They seem to be a minority class right now, which is a good thing.
---
I wouldn't say they are bad players they are just limiting their options and making grouping harder.  If I see a warrior in lfg looking for a tank I never reply because yes, he can go tank his own run.  Why would I want to roll against another warrior for loot when we can all go tank a group separately?  Not saying I never run with a warrior dps, it happens but I'll avoid it if I can still.
---
I mean I’m picking up on you sarcasm but I really just forgot to shut it off after using Netflix haha. Not even sure how it could be used to cheat
---
I don't see any value in anger management and 5% crit is DPS increase and tank should survive, DPS is for other specs.
---
Ah okay. Yeah I am Old Blanchy - Horde. Let me know if you ever get bored and want to start fresh.
---
Travel form is 30 but you can have 30% boost on cat form by lvl 21 if you prioritize the talent
---
Statistically if you have the funds to double it up each time you'll eventually make some money. I remember looking into it after a CSI:Miami or Vegas episode. Dude lost a fortune because he just kept losing til this funds were tapped out and couldn't keep going.
---
It adds up quickly.
---
I really hope you're joking!
---
Earthshock is great for interrupting casters, but it does that at rank 1.  Frost Shock does slightly less damage, but doesn't cause as much threat (still causes a fair amount) and slows an enemy.  It is much more useful at higher ranks.  There are a crap ton of things to train as shaman, and the majority of them are useful (remove poison, remove disease, strength of earth, etc.)  Just prioritize the ones that fit your play style.  Eventually you can afford them all.
---
I'm more of a participation kind of guy, but if those people enjoy watching more than doing, who am I to judge.
---
There's few classes that can 1on1 with warlocks. The usually just fear and DoT you to hell.
---
Dumbest class in the game in my opinion.
---

You can play the class however you like. It's OK. I don't disagree
---
would be amazing if those massive PVP fight weren't just a bunch of mage VS another bunch of mage, with cheerleader witnessing them.
---
Not flat or ugly enough.
---
Or wait until they’re pulling a large pack to AoE farm and Mind Control and hold their character in the middle of the mob pack until they die.
---
Old content that’s been forgotten/unreleased, Karazhan Crypts would be amazing.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwowplus/
---
That is a horrible spec and it's clear you have no idea how a shaman works at all. Multiple talents that do absolutely nothing so you can rub your dps epeen  a little harder?
---
Go back to retail, you do not belong in classic.
---
4) in phase 1 as far as I know you only get portals to the major cities. So horde would be Undercity Orgrimmar and Thunder Bluff. 
---
5)Orgrimmar is the horde capital

Ah you mean exploiting

nice!

Links?
---
Its funny because I'll start replying to someone, then go back and read, see I'm wrong, and just delete the message.
---
But you gain 2.5k + health with 0 pushback after a couple of seconds without spending mana.
---
Holy shield is an indirect way to mitigate damage by having an increased chance to block 4 times. I think on this level with average gear your block value will be around 60. So that is 240 damage prevented per use. I think this is mediocre in dungeon tanking, unless you plan on raid tanking, where the extra blocks is basically mandatory for you to stay alive and hold aggro.
---
infowars is trash propaganda so good riddance
---
Yeah, it did honestly lol. But I was so excited and I needed to send the pic to my wife. She knows I've been camping this for like a week. So I sent her a text with the picture. That was my first though.
---
GMs for Classic WoW are actually dog shit and if you're reading this as a GM try do change that if you're offended by it.
---
I can't watch 26 *seconds* of Ass-mongoloid let alone 26 minutes.

Anyone want to summarize?

Drag the buttons where you want them to be? The videos I linked explains everything

Rant time:
---
Blizzard's ban review system died somewhere around MoP-WoD. You used to be able to appeal it, now they outright tell you that if you attempt to appeal, you may get your ban extended.
---
This goes for all forms of bans, even automated ones, across all their games.
---
I played online games for 15+ years without getting a single suspension or warning or ban. In Overwatch, i was reported by a guy who was using racial slurs to the entire party and ended the game by saying "fuck you all, reporting all bye." Moments later i was suspended for 72 hours. Reason? 'disruptive gameplay', which, by the way, isn't even a possible reason to report people from the list in game.
---
And of course everyones immediate reply is "i bet you were a torb one trick or sym one trick!" No, i wasn't. Not that either of those are banworthy. I was playing winston and mccree and it was in quickplay.
---
Of course i went immediately to appeal, but noticed there was no way to appeal. So i sent in a regular ticket. Got an automated response back. Sent in another one. This time with all of the vods of the 4 games i had played that day (which was also my first time playing in a week or two.) This time my response was automated, with an additional paragraph saying that if i sent in another ticket, my ban would be extended.
---
I just stopped playing Overwatch. Honestly, if my WoW account wasn't connected to my Overwatch account, i would've just contacted my bank and asked them to charge back the purchase i made for the Overwatch game. Unfortunately that would lock my entire account.
---
Blizzard CS is extremely automated now. Have a few WoW GMs in my guild and both of them say that over the years the job has gotten a lot more stressful. We all know about in the past they were allowed to appear and interact with the customers and have some fun. Thats now seen as time wasting and invasive. You literally get your boss hounding you if you turn your character visible to players while in game even for a second.
---
On top of that, they're now required to be speaking to multiple people at once. The figures i was told were 5+ at once. This is why the standards across the board have dropped. English is broken and often incoherent. Replies are often literally just linking you a pasted WoWhead comment that doesn't even apply to what you were talking about, and of course, the worst one - the automation. 
---
Every GM essentially has a giant list of paragraphs they can paste to people. They're trained to scan through text, quickly identify a keyword and just throw you the paragraph as in many cases it may apply. 
---
Its honestly just straight up pathetic. There is absolutely zero reason a billion dollar company like Acti-Blizz can't afford to hire more customer support agents. But we're in late stage capitalism now boys - build your empire off the backs of great people, fire them then hire people with none of the passion and a quarter of the skills, for half the pay.
---
Let the customer deal with it. I'm sure you feel very valued, being locked out of your account because of sheer greed on Blizzard's part.
---
Running with a dps warrior is absolutely fine. But if your guild is lacking a tank for a 5 man, or the tanks die and you need one to take over during an encounter - you should put on the shield and taunt.
---
&gt;did nothing to counter the faulty information from census add-ons.
---
Except for disable them
---
Depends,
---
If you are elemental there are some spells you absolutely want to keep up to date that to be honest are kinda irrelevant or just bad when you are specc'd enhance.  Like Lightning Bolt.  Its not effective unless you are specc'd into it.
---
Are you trying 31/20/0 Elemental devastation/fury with Flurry?  Just grab everything but the utlity totems you don't end up using.
---
/ignore
---
Seriously? I feel like it would add some fun to it.
---
Agreed those parts are very easy as a Hunter, but I love the social aspects of gathering a group and tackling something together.
---
And I keep running into groups that demand AOE at the wrong times and places pulling too much thinking AOE is some wipe proof cure all for mobs. I don't bother sheeping at all because someone will just poke it. No tanks marking anything. Pulling while the healer is OOM because AOE can kill them all....
---
Reading this sub I keep wondering if I am the only mage that knows how to use counterspell, gives water for free all the time to strangers happily, can both AOE and single target, and doesn't pull in dungeons. What mage pulls unless it is a sheep pull?
---
Is it really this bad or is this mage hate being exaggerated a bit?
---
Dude looks like a douche..  i'm not gonna fume over ninja looting shit happens, upvote and learn to not raid/dungeon with him.
---
I was scilla-horde from vanilla to WoD so I'm probably the opposite of what you're looking for haha.
---
Mitigation is the only issue real tank should care about. Dual wield is not a tank, it's a nonsense. Threat is not an issue, because DPS can just stop smashing their buttons or die if they are stupid and pull aggro and fight continues. But dead tank is end of story.
---
Dude if you were being strict enough to pay up front for chips then it ain't casual
---
/moo
---
This sounds fun, it's like "/roll russian roulette". Who gets the 1 first.
---
Did you add the key and string to your Lutris client for the wow system settings and verify that these settings saved?
---
"LD_PRELOAD"
---
"path/to/file/libgamemodeauto.so" 
---
Double check those and make sure they are there, you can use the search feature I posted to get the exact file path.
---
totally understandable haha. enjoy it
---
Sure. But facts dont care.
---
Yeah this is the thing people often forgot about old school WoW. Guilds were generally way less personal because of the sheer amount of people needed to do stuff.
---
But that also means most Guilds are just 50+ random people who only talk when it's time to do a dungeon or when they want to jump layers
---
Thanks for feedback. Will look again at the advertising. Was thinking of adding a paid option to remove. What do you think?

Don't worry, my co-worker has two level 60s.

He took three weeks off work, told his GF he was away for work and just played Wow.

What did you do to make the image look this bad?
---
When you pay my subscription fee you can tell me how to play my character. Until than, if I want to play a Tank Priest that’s my choice.
---
I am broke too. But that's because I took the two most money sapping (at least early on) professions (Enchanting and Tailoring). 
---
I probably wont have a mount until 47. &gt;.&gt;

could have cut the first 15 seconds bro
---
If someone builds up a company, manages it, innovates and manages teams of people to revolutionize an entire industry then yes, they (and by they I mean the company) deserve billions.
---
They earned it, does Apple not deserve billions for changing the game up with the first Mac's? Or Bill Gates for the PC?
---
Again, these people aren't swimming in gold coins, they don't have billions in their chequing accounts, they have a NET WORTH of billions from money they use to invest in your aunt's revolutionary all natural organic line of toilet bowl cleaner etc etc.

I remember when I used to spout the same crap without understanding how economics and businesses really operate. It's easy to point at successful people and say "Eat the rich" out of envy and naivety.

It uses alot. Average 15mbps which is like 6.8 GB per hour

---
Thank you shaidyn, very cool!
---
This doesn’t seem super efficient, but I like the “I did it because I can” spirit. Take my upvote.
---
That's what I thought! And furthermore when they changed how the accounts worked, my gm and her husband had both their wow accounts on the same blizz account and shared all the mounts and achievements and stuff.
---
Well, not anymore I guess, and blizz support said specifically that it's not intended to be used that way, and doing what I wanted to do is breaking their rules. They split up the two accounts to two blizz accounts so we could play, but we had to pretend to be a married couple separated by an ocean. Haha
---
Thanks! .. the icons are supposed to be trees :) ... think i might have to change that graphic!
---
Well, Asmon gets the last laugh, earning something like 80 grand a month playing a video game while these people screech in rage. The general Reddit response to Asmongold reminds me so much of the "nice guy" who wants a girlfriend. The latter believes that you input "niceness" into women and should, thus, receive sex, and can't understand how guys who don't act fawning and "nice" (in reality these are not nice people) are still able to succeed at dating/relationships, while the former believes you input some sort of "respectability" and "constructiveness" into your stream and should, thus, receive viewers and popularity. It's fucking stupid, lol. Entertaining is a subjective metric, but it's entertainment that draws viewers. 
---
Reddit talks a lot about the level of maturity of Asmon and his audience, but I don't know too many self-possessed and strong adult men who spend hours a day whining about what mean people do in a video game. Remember guys, this is Asmon's job; it's your hobby and passion, apparently.
---
Nothing makes you look more like a little bitch when you talk shit and ignore before they can reply.
---
would be amazing if there wasn't a 5 second serverlag doing those massive pvp fights.
---
I got bad news for you
---
Blizz always does troll stuff so well, even in vanilla!
---
I find the opposite to be true. Revenge procs all the time, costs less rage, and is higher threat than Sunder Armor. It's easier to maintain aggro w/ 1H+shield.
---
I'm lvling my third char. Just raid logging on my rogue so :P
---
I'm a 60 mage and I'm quite anxious about respeccing all the time between pvp/pve talents. I really dont want to spend 50g (once I hit cap) every time I have to either pvp/pve. I've looked for hybrid builds but am struggling to find much. Any help would be appreciated
---
"Eventual" lol
---
Everyone: "haha mages are so dumb, cant do a dungeon without aoe, pull agro all the time, hurhur magetards"
---
also everyone: "yo can I get some food and water? What do you mean I need to tip for a port? fkn gay ass mages"
---
Paladins are fucking unkillable for any anyone at similar level, in questing gear. It's so freaking irritating. Most paladins at or above level I see come strait at me trying to kill me. 
---
I had a paladin almost 10 levels below me attack me on the way through STV and go running for help when I fought back. I kill every paladin on sight now. I don't give a shit what level they are or if they sit and wave to try and make me feel bad. They're gunna die or bubble hearth.
---
Sure. I don't disagree. There's nothing wrong with being bad at the game. Read the first sentence
---
Do you understand the definition of the word "counter"?
---
Once the information is out there it's too late to just disable them. That does nothing to repair the damage.
---
That's very true. I've met some really awesome people in dungeon runs, and I'm looking forward to hitting the 50s when I can start running content with my friends again (they're way ahead because I started priest and rerolled hunter at level 36).
---
Calling it being bad is just wrong. If they're a good dps than they're not bad, you need a different narrative to push your agenda.
---
The obvious answer is to start small, see if they sell, then ramp up production to meet demand.
---
You are absolutely right in that the market will grow with PvP phases, add-ons like Auctioneer will make your life much easier by collecting market information.
---
Hello unknown guildie!
---
Looks like Dominos and Shadowed Unit Frames.  Bagnon for the bag addon.
---
Just go to the blizzard forums and search classic+. Im at work and cant link. You'll find everything under the sun has been asked for, from aoe looting and the barbershop to LFD and wow token
---
My thoughts hahaha
---
I was def lost as fuck the first time i ran ST, even WITH the online guide. But by the 2nd run, I had it down again
---
Shockwave and devistate would be nice additions to my tanking tool kit.
---
I'll say this again, tanks are not a requirement in classic! They are great when they can actually manage their threat (at later levels) but in most 5 man's are not going to make or break your group. Grab an extra mage and play smart!
---
Smalls here 🙋‍♂️
---
Yes, when aimed shot can come off a split second before autoshot, yes yes.
---
I understand what clipping is.  And unless I'm Marksman, while I level as a BM, clipping really has no point.  It doesn't matter because my skills can be shot between any auto shot.  Multishot is the only one with a slight cast time but it's easily done between my autoshots.
---
Well it's not the only swamp in Classic though. We also have Wetlands and the Swamp of Sorrows.
---
Yes the journey is fun. But getting camped by an opposite faction level 60 when I’m level 51 drives me insane. Making me want to grind so I can get my revenge and grief lower levels for hours as revenge.
---
I recommend 'The Egg' by Andy Weir.
---
I'm looking forward to 55-60 mostly.  I bought into WoW after TBC released, so I never got to experience the real end game and once I hit 58 I was focused on getting to Outland.  Heck, once I got to about 55, I was purely focused on leveling to 58.  So I never ran any dungeons or raids in vanilla after Sunken Temple...I can't wait to experience the original endgame content.
---
It’s amazing. I went from 160-300 Herbalism in SoS.
---
Taking your advice
---
Wow, that's a helluva story. I admit, I didn't know HOW rare he was to spawn. The first day I tried to go get him, I saw another Hunter there (night elf). And he was waiting for about 10 minutes before me. We sat and waited for an hour and he spawned. So I decided to help him by laying the trap for him (since he forgot to) and Humar was on his way to stop the taming. The Night Elf tamed him, then thanked me profusely. He asked will I be ok, and I said yes. So I waited 6 hours before I looked up his respawn timer online. I got so bummed out and realized I was wasting time. So I kept jumping back on for the last 6 days for 2-3 hours at a time, multiple times per day. Finally, my time has come and Humar is mine.
---
Return of Kara is probably my favorite 5-man of all-time. What an amazing gem. Haven't played BFA either so I haven't tried Mechagon.
---
I half agree with your overall sentiment, and half disagree. I believe you are mostly referring to warriors who are exclusively dps warriors, and legitimately don't even possess tanking gear. The warrior class is not 1 dimensional (i.e. DPS only, or tank only), but a sexy hybrid of dps machine, tanking gods, and PvP master (with a healer). Resorting to only one of these things just limits the potential. A dps warrior does not have to tank instances if they don't want to, but should be able to tank if the situation necessitates it. The problem is a lot of dps warriors are just awful at it because it's a lot easier to DPS  and face smash buttons than to properly tank.  I've been in many situations where dps warriors pull agro, don't switch to shield and 1h and just die. Their logic is always well I was doing a lot of damage .. I guess.. Enjoy those repair bills?.  However, I'm not bothered by people playing 1 dimensional. There are many bad players in every game, and WoW is no different. It's your money, use it as you please, and do whatever makes you have fun. At the end of the day that's what matters.
---
Shout out to Critter.
---
It’s my first time playing WoW of any kind and I rolled shammy and I feel like a god now that I’ve gotten this totem. I’ve even seen people in chat say “Shaman w/ wind fury LFG for ___”
---
Yeah, I was thinking about it for a bit and I think a 2/32/17 build would be optimal. The main difference being that tactical mastery would be dropped entirely and instead I'd get 5/5 in Defiance for the threat gen. I understand what you mean though by putting the raid's needs first, but it is something I'd like to try out eventually.
---
Which auctioneers getting the best head?
---
Never understood why people did this ina game.
---
Hes got +Dodge doesn't need a shield. 😭
---
Are you sure he doesnt go for your mouse pointer? mine follows it all over the screen
---
Start paying their monthly subscription and then you can start telling people how to play their class and how to spend their time in-game.
---
If you are not paying for it than STFU and let people use their class how they see fit.
---
My list of emotes.
---
Friendly: /wave  
---
Pissed off: /spit
---
I feel useless running as Enhance in dungeons but maybe that's because I'm used to being the healer and having a much more obvious role in the success of the group.
---
People might be posting grenades to the AH, but I doubt many are selling.
---
They require Engineering to even use them, so most people who want them can craft them with those same cheap materials.
---
It's ok if you don't know for sure to say so, or say "probably not" but if you're going to speak in definitives such as "Nope" I'd appreciate a link for reference and confirmation.
---
Not where I lived they weren't. There were only like 2 other people in my apartment complex who had internet. Most people just went to the library to check their emails
---
It's different because with the second option, you aren't asking anyone to work for free. The first option, you are asking other people to pass on gear they need to accommodate your own selfishness.
---
I just started my alt couple days back after getting my first 60.
---
Really helps to have someone to bank-roll :p
---
That's my point. I can't see how from Blizzard's point of view they could tell you were using steam link or other programs like that. But, I wouldn't say for sure until someone more qualified than I says so.

[Moved from Herod to Heartseeker]
---
&lt;Rainfall&gt; [A] | NA-Heartseeker PvP | Tues / Wed 8-11pm EST | Semi-HC | Predetermined Loot Council
---
Raid Schedule: 
---
Raid times are Tuesday &amp; Wednesday @ 8:00 PM – 11:00 PM ET. Monday will be our optional clean-up day when necessary.
---
About Us:
---
&lt;Rainfall&gt; is a semi-hardcore raiding guild looking for mature players for the upcoming classic PvE content. We are currently recruiting all classes with a focus on players motivated to make sufficient preparations before raids. Our goal is to do clear all PvE content efficiently without forcing our players to play more than their schedules allow.
---
Member Expectations:
---
Members are expected to contribute to raids as much as they can. Raiders who want to stand out should come prepared and on time with consumables, buffs, enchants, etc. Exceptional quality raiders will be given preference for invites and gear during progression. 
---
Loot Distribution:
---
Since all loot in classic is already known, we will be using a predetermined loot council with priority of each item based on role and class. This way there is less bias towards specific members and each item can be given to those who benefit the raid the most. Any suggestions and concerns are open for discussion before raiding begins. 
---
Available Roles:
---
* Healer Druid
---
* Balance Druid
---
* Hunter
---
* Mage
---
* Healer Paladin
---
* Healer Priest
---
* Shadow Priest
---
* Dagger Rogue
---
* Warlock
---
* Fury Warrior
---
* Tank Warrior
---
For any inquiries, PM nubb#8668 or drop by our discord.
---
&lt;https://discord.gg/zGDS5KS&gt;
---
It depends on your spec, a LOT.
---
There are some that can be skipped regardless, mostly non-combat spells like Sentry Totem.  It will have minor uses in pvp but that's about it, imo.
---
If you're not relying on lightning for damage then don't go further than rank 1. I only use it to pull from range and rely mostly on shocks and melee for damage. 
---
Unless you're going to tank then Earth Shock can be left at rank 1 for the interrupt utility.
---
All of the resist totems and weapon enhancement totems (except windfury) can be ignored until much later when you have gold to throw around.
---
If you're looking for in-depth info maybe check out Melderon's Shaman guides.
---
30???? How and why! I love lots of characters but what’s the advantage there lol
---
Just like how BWL entrance used to be in UBRS
---
Gullem? I always auction with him because of that.

You know there is a reason all of these posts are getting deleted right. Because no one here wants to see them.
---
I will fight you!
---
No I’m not. Look I’m not going to get into the million things someone can do in an MMO go make them a crappy player, this topic is on one thing and fact is that one thing is opinion and a bad one based on comments here so that isn’t what makes a bad player which is all we are talking about in this thread.
---
Read the first sentence please.
---
I guess I'm just worried it's already overpriced, and it's high enough a price for the deposit to be a little too much to risk.
---
Note: Torch runs no longer exist
---
Yup this. I mained a healer for years. 
---
I'd love to start tanking...but...uh, I don't know my way around anywhere except Deadmines, SM and UBRS.
---
Yeah Blizzard used to have the best customer service around as far as video games go, shame to hear that they're faltering
---
This doesn’t make sense
---
&gt;+ Develop the talent trees up to WotLK;
---
&gt;+ Allow some kind of mount for levels 10-39;
---
&gt;+ Allow use of the improved 3D models;
---
&gt;+ Create new areas in the existing continents;
---
Maybe, but probably not because Blizzard likes to destroy lore. As others have said, only cut content from original Vanilla would be welcomed by the masses, most likely.
---
&gt;+ Add some form of dungeon finder (maybe);
---
NO. Out of all of these things, this is the worst. Community dies when automation is implemented. Stop asking for it.
---
I’m new and generally suck at the game.
---
I made a priest took hours to get it to level 10 and deleted it.
---
I’m now playing a paladin, much more fun.
---
Is there a series or compressive guide for new players? 
---
Like what all the acronyms mean? How to get into dungeons? How to play my role? What the professions are and why they matter?
---
Like I’m legit bottom of the barrel dumb
---
People's time.
---
And that mage might need to port back.
---
I have no interest in playing that, but thanks for the kind suggestion.
---
I think its still an option in classic somewhere in the settings. Might have to edit an INI file or something
---
try /console ActionButtonUseKeyDown 1
---
Hey my main is Incendius
---
Cairne my boy!Always badass punting alliance with his totem .Hes stongest Horde character ever in terms of physical strength
---
Defending someone who says all greed then they need, smh.
---
It depends the class. I did my first 60 at 6 days 1 hour played without a guide of grinding. But I did plan my route  as I went (aka if I was on a flight path, I had wowhead open with all available quests.) I only did zones with yellow and orange but effeciently choose quests I knew would send me to other zones. (Aka, Id build up quests that sent me to ungoro)
---
It really depends on the class though.
---
Not vocal.
---
Tried hitting up a mage offering portal service on my server. We were in Org and I wanted to go to UC. “How much?” I said. “You tell me.” He replied. “Mats +30s?” I said naively, at level 33. His response? “2g minimum”. 
---
I said I’ll swim.
---
Quick question about the totem vs. the weapon enhancement. Do you use the weapon enhancement over the totem? Or do you buff weapon with fire/frost/strength and then throw totem down and hope for proc? I don’t think the windfury totem and weapon enhancement stack do they?
---
Remember Thottbot?
---
These are the best leveling experiences other than dinging 40 and finally 60.
---
On top of what everyone else has said,   it's really easy to find a group to help you finish this quest off.   Tarren Mill and STV are both really populated.     I finished the quest at 34 by grouping.
---
Ya its a bug
---
People who aren't jealous don't care what other people do with their free time. You are very obviously jealous.
---
You’re not talking about difficulty but ´boring’
---
Getting the mere 100-200 gold (roughly) in phase 6 to buy arcane crystals if you really don’t want to mine them or get help from the miners of your guild are nothing in a game where almost every player manage to get 90 gold at level 40. 
---
So no getting attuned for Naxx isn’t harder than the instance and it’s really ridiculous to say that
---
The math you're basing this off of is wrong. It's been discovered in classic that every time WF procs, the person retains the attack power bonus for up to 1.5s afterward, which can boost not only the WF proc damage but also potentially a white hit and special attack.
---
On the flip side, Purification (+10% healing) only increases base healing and does not scale with your +healing at all. And in MC/BWL, a lot of the time you are better off dropping Fire Resist Totem for the melee group you are in instead of Mana Spring. But if you're always in a caster group, by all means drop spring and be Mana Tide spec.
---
Personally I think Mana Tide spec is only worthwhile if you're undergeared or swapping the Shaman into the Priest or Mage group right before they drop tide- which most raids don't do.
---
&gt; If you’re AOE spec though, blizzard is kind of a break even option with 2 mobs
---
I have no idea what the fuck this means. There's no "AOE spec" involving blizzard except for the singular talent that adds a snare, and that has nothing to do with how horribly inefficient it still is on two targets. AoE isn't DPME viable until 4 targets. if it's three or fewer and you don't have to kill immediately, you press frostbolt.
---
Why would you watch his stream and help him make money, not to mention make publicity for him, if you think he's absolute filth?
---
Leveling Holy, been fine for the most part, a bit of a lull but has more to do with having a job I need to be awake for.
---
that would have been dope
---
In classic it's very likely you'll meet someone again whereas in retail you'll more likely see them vanish into the void the second they phase
---
Down you goooooo ;)

George Bush don't care about the Black Dragonflight
---
I've had good luck grinding the duskwallow marsh turtles (35-38). They regularly drop greys that sell for 9s each (45s per 5 stack) and you can get turtle scales from skinning that sell for 2g per stack. I made probably around 8g per hour farming them. Currently level 39 with 110 gold. You can also swim out to the islands and face less farming competition. Sometimes chests spawn among the murlocks as well.
---
Blame all the idiots on YouTube and twitch who put out a million guides saying “how to get to 60 in 1 day” “how to make 40000g/hour with blizzard!”
---
Depends if you like rap or mounts you can grind troll rep for that. If you like wolves Orgrimmar there’s not many grindabke mounts for horde. Alliance is the only one I know of.
---
I only had to kill 10 didn't know it was that hard to get, ouch
---
Can we agree that Auctioneer Epitwee (UC) has the weirdest Olde English name of any Forsaken?
---
OP poopsocks.
---
WoW drama is hilarious
---
Every level after 10 it goes up by 1 minute with a cap of 10 minutes.
---
Did they log back on within 15min? Might have been swapping chars for a quick craft or something.
---
Just coordinate well with your friends because there won't be any notice in advance when they end and you may risk of splitting your group between servers if you don't do it at the same time.
---
There's no going back from a free transfer.
---
&gt;If you NEVER EVER put on a shield, that makes you a bad player.
---
Sure, dps warriors should be prepared to throw on a shield and taunt if the tank dies. It's also helpful to have a macro to switch to a shield when you get attacked by a physical damage class.
---
&gt;but refusing to put on a tank and shield when tur group need you too because it's boring means you're a bad player.
---
Or, you know, it means you don't like tanking. You do realize that it's a game and that people play to have fun, right? If tanking is unfun to somebody then they shouldn't do it. Why would you expect someone else to prioritize your fun over their own? That's just selfish on your part.
---
Tell you what, let's add death knights and make paladins and shamans viable tanks and I'll do it, I've only ever enjoyed DK tanking.
---
Just from the first 15 minutes.
---
Ass-mon decides that people don't want justice, they want "retribution" - Toys with the idea (from McConnell) to offer Roysun the option of providing justice by paying out the gold from the auction to each of the group members during the drop, but  ultimately ends with the decision to handle it by sitting down and conversing with Roysun.
---
He can't justify outright kicking Roysun from the guild since he's done a lot for the guild and he is an officer.
---
He goes on to talk about good things Roysun has done.
---
I listened to this. Regretted it. Would like my 15 minutes back. No I didn't listen to the whole thing.
---
lore wise it makes more sense in vanilla
---
Most video game customer service is trash.. Get this. Mutes are based off how many times other players have reported you.. You can literally get a group of people and report someone for spamming and they'll get muted automatically after a certain number of people have reported them.
---
If you would like a TLDR on the comments on this thread
---
40% Yeah FK mages!
---
10% Im not a bad mage!
---
40% holy hell you have 3 60!?!?!?!?!?!
---
its always druids that are weird. 
---
every druid i've met has been really fucking weird or a ninja looter.
---
Using mouse buttons helps a bunch too.  SHIFT and Scroll Wheel on mine is my mount, and the thumb buttons on my mouse do 0 - and =.  Really convenient that way
---
I mean you don't go into the Naralex room until the escort
---
Wowhead and icyveins have good Guides for every class.
---
MAGES USING BLIZZARD!!! REEEEEEEEEE!!!!!
---
I think you need someone else to buff them - so it's actually 2+ people involved. The priest mind controls, and his friend(s) cast the buffs :)
---
I don't expect to hear a million things I'd just like some examples.
---
It's one thing to drop the odd heal, it's another to pretty much say "I want you to fill this role for me, even though you hate it, so I can continue to enjoy myself"...
---
I only just got to level 30 on my druid yesterday, a maybe 4 other toons none past 8 or 9. I feel your pain.
---
Anyone else feel like they don't give a shit unless blizzard actually does something?
---
One time my friends and I were chasing down a horde player in Hillsbrad Foothills. He was booking it North and he got to maybe 10% health. He dinged from discovering Alterac and it was super funny before we killed him. Never seen it before, just remember it could be worse!
---
"must have targeted them somehow"
---
I'm sorry, but I laughed extra heartily at that.
---
Badger....?
---
I never said I played in a group. I leveled both solo. What on earth made you read it like they were grouped?
---
okay
---
Works like a charm! I've scaled it down from 150% to 120% and it still works well
---
Honestly, I predominately levelled with a priest healer (buddy of mine). He actually went full healing spec early 50s. I have pretty much 2H tanked (MS-PvP Spec) every dungeon including decent portions of UBRS. Obviously you should be able to quickly switch to 1H and shield at a moments notice when incoming damage is too high, but that takes a lot of experience and time to understand how to juggle it. (I might be requested to spec prot for MC tho). 2H tanking dungeons is a lot more enjoyable to me. It provides more rage which in return means more damage which also means more agro, but I also take more damage which then drains healer mana. But with a decent healer who conserves mana, I can clear top end dungeons (Strat, scholo, etc.) in under an hour. Fastest has been about 45 mins so far.
---
I thought that was really funny, she put way more effort into it than she needed to.
---
What's a good place to farm gold solo for a level 39?
---
I am waiting on some friends to catch up so we can group.  I'm only around 45g and don't want to get too much EXP from it so like level 35s would be nice.
---
I have no plans to buy my 40 mount until level 50+ but would like to stockpile some riches while I can since I'm not interested in playing one of my alts.
---
I have skinning at 250 so I am making decent cash off that on the AH and vendoring trash.. but I haven't really found a peak spot.  I have herbalism 215ish but am banking all my herbs as I plan to hit Alchemy upon reaching level 60.  I have an alt tailor that can make silk bags but I make more from AHing the mats than I do selling the bags (shes only level 10 so I can't train further).
---
I tried to hit Swamp of Sorrows for the whelps since skinning their scales is a nice load (and of course the pet drop chance) but it's always so camped.  And if I try to farm the jaguars there I just get ganked by a passing 60 rogue every 20 minutes.
---
I've run SM like 30 times but I never make any real cash from it and just get a load of EXP.  I made a lot my first handful of runs but after that it has been a constant bust.
---
fucking hell, third 60lvl? and im here just took my 52 lvl today with /played 16 days pure time :( ehhh. I know “dont hurry u will miss noting” but i will miss slots in raids and some money making farmes while economy is fresh...eh.
---
Get outta here if your gunna hate on the excellent adventure dude
---
You could under cut it by 50g if you wanted and still be making a good amount
---
Jebus, am I the only one who when I see a lone quester I go out of my way to buff him and give him food and water? oO
---
Play what you want. Don't worry about optimal race/class optimizations. Doesn't matter unless you are in the top% of players looking for any little edge.
---
1000000x agree.
---
Wait, why? As of like a week or so ago I saw people advertising it in /lookingforgroup, what happened? Did they nerf xp?
---
gawd that goblin content over there is so awful. It's like everything wrong with modern wow wrapped up in one penthouse.
---
When I leveled my mage I would just laugh at all the mage leveling AoE spots.. 3-4 mages tryna do hillsbrad 3-4 mages tryna do the murlocs in Dustwallow.. yea mage AoE leveling only works if you're the ONLY mage and it's a fresh server, after a week that shit doesn't work..sometimes I would see 2 mages group and do it which is not even slightly worth the exp.
---
&gt;Meme specs can still finish all content.
---
while this is true, the real meaning is "meme specs can be carried through all content"
---
Watching this is painful, would never let my cat do that to my monitor, I would fear the cat would scratch it.
---
Thank you :) yeah I thought about this last night questing in Stonetalon. I had just killed enough Venture Co guys to fill a quest requirement and ghosted it back to turn in the quest. Along the way I passed a LOT of enemies. I loved the speed but did wonder how much exp I just passed up.

**&lt;Primordial&gt;** [Eng] Progression PVE/WPVP - Tue/Thu/Sun 6:30-9:30 PM PST 
---
Primordial is a progression raiding and world PVP guild. The core team team is a bunch of WoW vets who have been playing this game for too damn long. We've run successful raiding guilds throughout every expansion. Most of us are in our 30s. Our goal as a guild is to clear all the raid content as it unlocks and murder KT, all while killing alliance in the world and in BGs.
---
**Who are we looking for?**
---
We're looking for mature raiders who want to kick ass while being social and having fun. We're usually sharing stories over coms and having drinks while we play.
---
Need white DPS, cloth dps and healers. Backups also welcome!
---
**Raiding Schedule**
---
**Tuesdays, Thursdays, Sundays 6:30 PM PST - 9:30 PM PST**
---
This is our planned raiding schedule. It's subject to a little wiggle room depending on majority of players schedules. Ideally we clear by the end of Thursday, but we've got Sunday for clean up or other activities.
---
**Loot Policy**
---
Our aim with the raiding loot policy is to always be fair, and to improve the overall raid and guild. By using loot council, we will ensure that given gear has the largest impact the on the success of raid and guild. The loot council bases the decisions on factors like: individual contribution, largest upgrade, role priority and attendance.
---
Loot council is a tried and true loot policy that works best for progression raiding guilds, as we've successfully used it before in cutting edge content.

Also, it hurts me to read that you deleted a level 10 toon. Never delete your alts. Never know when you'll get the itch to play Priest again and now you've set yourself back 10 levels which probably took you 4 or 5 hours to do. Priest level much faster than Pallys, too.
---
I like /mourn for these occasions
---
Was he not trading him the gold after each roll? I was thinking he was 3g in the hole after the first 2 rolls so we was trying to make his money back with the last one.

---
EDIT: classic version
---
Thanks! I really appreciate the advice, especially the heads up about the vanilla quest levelling
---
C is closest to door
---
Oof, I'm Horde as you can see so it'll be quite some time until I have data on the Black Menace. I do know an Ally on another server who's about to hit SM though, maybe I could convince him to do some testing...
---
my other question is if it could proc more than once every 30 seconds did you notice if it could?
---
You get that from Jintha’Alor in Hinterlands right? That’s called a micro dungeon! They’re open world elite areas that were slowly removed over the years in retail. Stromgarde, Grim Batol, Tainted Scar, Tyr’s Hand, Darkwhisper Gorge, the four green dragons, etc.
---
I've only heard horror stories about STV!  Do you think it's worth it?
---
&gt; I’d start with people that push their ways on others. Take a guy who thinks he has the only way to play and tells everyone else that’s the only way an MMO can be played, that’s a bad player.
---
Refusing to taunt when the tank is dead is pushing your way onto other players. 39 people died while you could have shield walled and held the boss for 20 seconds.
---
&gt;I've seen hunters roll on virtually everything because they think everything is an upgrade. 
---
Hey maybe stop generalizing everyone who plays Hunters. That's very not cool, thanks.
---
I bet you don't remember every time you had a Hunter roll/pass on gear correctly. Instead you remember every bad instance and generalize everyone. That's pretty lame of you.
---
Lol there are people who work 3 jobs and raise families. You're just falling into the classic classist capitalist trope that more money = equals working harder. Sure a billionaire start up works hard, but how do you measure something like worth ethic compared to someone who does 60 hrs a week as well at their salaried job.
---
At maximum range you are out of range of frostbolt, escape artist is quite nice in that matchup, but not everyone plays gnome
---
Question about [nostance:1] - is 1 battle, 2 defensive, and 3 berserker?
---
When mine dropped a few weeks ago people were saying it’s worth about 75g (horde on skeram). Price on ah was 30g by the next day and I sold mine for 20g in the end.
---
There were lots on ah recently so don’t think that price will be realistic
---
Well BRD is kinda... "convoluted". But it goes out of its way to give great hints at the greater shit that awaits the adventurers in BRS and ofc ol' pal' Raggy.
---
Have I not?
---
Nope. Steam link app
---
It's not that hard, it drops from the first boss in undead Strat.
---
Not just a bigger hitbox but can also shoot slightly further too. The deadzone is also further out than other races. Can actually help in pvp if people aren't used to finding it on taurens.
---
Not the same. BRD feels like you are in a legit city. Hell there is a bar and a bank! Its great.
---
If you want to be able to casually log in and quest for 30 minutes to hour, you are going to want to focus on green quests/mobs. You can kill yellow mobs and quests as a solo warrior, but it is not all that efficient. So if your goal is to be able to log in and get right into efficient leveling, warriors are a bit tougher then other classes. 
---
On the other side, if you don't mind being less efficient, needing to group up for yellow quests, or you don't mind grinding out dungeons for a few levels at a time, then it is not that bad.
---
For me I really like my warrior, I like tanking (most of the time...), and I find that if I am grinding mobs 3-4 levels below me then I can constantly pull with a bandage every 3-4 kills.
---
Personally, I kind of wish my main and highest character was not a warrior. The reason is because I have come to discover that my favorite part of the game is exploring the world, doing quests, and engaging in world PvP. While my warrior can do all of those things, it is undeniably slower and harder then doing it with a more solo oriented class. 
---
Honestly at this point I would rather just play my druid alt, but I hate the name I chose for druid and love the name I chose for warrior. Sounds silly I know, but it's the truth.
---
C because of everybody saying they go to A or B
---
&gt;Add lfd. Add transmog. Add dual spec.
---
There is absolutely no way those are general opinions, though, at least not on Reddit because I admittedly don't visit the official forums at all.
---
haha
---
duchemages are the new huntards tho
---
Anyone dumb enough to roll Greed on items like that deserves to have this happen.
---
Always roll Need lads.
---
That's bullshit. Did you ever play bc arena? That was the peak. Shit was still killable.
---
Yea, that I get, however it's missing the very important detail that it causes everyone to get their item faster by essentially dividing groups based on what items people need from the instance.
---
So while it does imply the persons time is valuable, it does in no way imply anything about other peoples time.
---
Hmm, just got back to the states from a trip to Austria last weekend. No troubles yet but now I’m worried I’ll be facing a suspended account when I get home tonight
---
icc was just as open as ulduar path-wise, if not more - it had an antechamber, and then three wings that could be completed in any order (similar to naxx), and then the boss's lair
---
i don't know why people hate on it. maybe they thought lk25h was anticlimactic as an expansion end boss or whatever
---
but icc was a *good* raid. it was big, it took a huge chunk of time to full clear, it was stylistically distinct and beautiful, and it had a lot of set-piece fights that felt visceral and desperate due to tough mechanics and hard gear checks, like saurfang and sindragosa
---
not to mention professor putricide, department chair of pug-killing
---
RNG....I killed 5 to get this part, the other part (lookout glass) I killed about 30...
---
For those farming, the lookouts are at every tower, go to the tower with a bridge, there are 4 and not much competition for them.
---
Entirely fictitious post made to farm Karma? Downvote.
---
Wasting his time. Did he even manage to steal a single one from you guys during your session?
---
Questing is and has always been mostly garbage.  I instance grind all my characters up and that's the way I like it.
---
&gt; If you want to be a good warrior player, you should be able to play both roles at a moments notice. Good guilds need tanks for 5 mans and the 3-4 Guild Tanks can't do dungeons with absolutely everyone.
---
&gt;If you want to be a good player &amp; expect other players to perform you can't be a DPS warrior.
---
Right there in your OP.
---
🤞
---
Are you gonna report me?
---
You can’t report all of us!!
---
To be honest, levelling with aoe is by far the most efficent for a mage. But they should also switch things up near end game... you use aoe because it solo levels (or group dungeons) the fastest, it isn't at all the most efficient at end game.
---
ALT + Z xD
---
This is how i paid for my mount at 40. A stack goes for about 7g
---
And what's even more fun with Ravager procs, horde side only, is with windfury as all the windfury procs stack up and get u leashed at the end of spin on your target. 
---
Can make some crazy dmg.
---
This is bannable. This was added to Blizzards Eula.

Thank activision
---
1) Not many people have 300G to splash out on a pattern.
---
2) Until BGs are released, being disarmed isn't a concern for many people.

My advice is to level a blacksmith, learn it, and earn a fortune attaching them later on.

---
You definitely aren't the only one. I've given and received a ton of help in Classic. It's one of my favorite things about Classic, actually.
---
currently playing frost mage.
---
was active in retail before classic - also on mage.
---
love a good pure mage aoe group because it's fun, but the group comp needs to support aoe. it's mana inefficient for quests or a non aoe comp in instance.
---
frostbolt/firebolt is your friend. also - we have cc and interrupts, they are important.
---
I wish I knew about this 2 days ago before I accidentally clicked a stealthed druid sitting on the Gadgetzan FP. The guards were not happy about that :(
---
No they fired a ton of CS staff to increase their bottom line,  we should hold them accountable
---
&gt; you should be able to play both roles at a moments notice
---
Sounds pretty emergency to me.
---
Was running my first ZF run since Cata and decided to gather the group myself. Needless to say, I had forgotten enough about the instance that some things didn’t ring any bells. First LFG post, two people message me. The first asks if I have mallet. I ask him who’s mallet and pick up the second guy. Second LFG post gets another two responses, first from a ret pally who I picked up after messaging the second guy. That second PM was from another player asking if we have mallet. I respond to the second msg saying I haven’t invited him yet and why he’s asking if I did. “Should I not? What did he do?” Etc etc.
---
Eventually I fill the group up with another few players and ask the group why so many people are asking about Mallet. No one had a clue and seemed just as surprised as I did but laughed that it was happening. It wasn’t until three or four PMs about mallet later, someone finally explains they mean the mallet for ZF to summon Ghaz’rilla. Just so happened I ended up getting messaged by and picking up a ret pally by the name of.. you guessed it. Mallet.
---
If you had worded your post around that, being able to flip into def stance and pop some macro’d CDs while the MT got rebirthed and some threat, then I’m 100% with you. Unfortunately you muddied that up by adding in the part where you flat out said you cant be a DPS warrior and also mentioning the lack of guild dungeon tanks.
---
(Also you can only get last stand in classic/BC if you are an off tank spec or full tank spec.)
---
But my karma!
---
You're talking about a change of role, I'm not. The odd heal *spell*, not the odd healer role.
---
Hard to say what the price will be in a stable economy, but it's more valuable on PvP servers and in phases 2/3. Without PvP, it's not a very highly valued item; but with PvP, it's much more useful.
---
If it's you or nothing, I'd probably pick you.
---
Hey, what server are you on?
---
Yea not planning to spend the amount of time needed to get that hammer.. Got a 60 hunter which is semifun in pvp and hella boring in pve so I plan to log on it 1-2 times a week for raids and cut down on the playtime now when the hype has cooled down a bit so a new alt to level, which I enjoy to do seems like a good Idea.
---
The obvious choice here is a rogue but I never tried paladin whatsoever and the fact that the class/spec is so rare kinda draws me to it even more.
---
Do u really think it will be years before tbc shows up? More than 3?
---
I think bartender has this option somethere
---
Azureal! It's Agos. Playing with a bunch of people on Fairbanks. Where's Manik?
---
STV is all part of the classic experience. Not going to STV would be like buying a cake, and scraping all the frosting into the trash.
---
Just have fun. Don't worry about it.
---
 For Gnomeregan!
---
Think of it like this... you run to a quest spot, kill some mobs, and then turn it in. Maybe you kill 20 mobs for 150xp each. 3K XP. And the quest gives you 3K. But you had to run there and back, doing nothing but sneaking. Instead you could murder another 20 mobs and make it a 9K XP instead of 6. And also factor in the gold and potentially good loot.
---
just curious why you want to wait that long to get your mount?
---
I don't think they can, I think someone else has to cast the buff as the MC breaks otherwise.
---
Had a blast with priests though MC low level mobs with my thorns and amor lol.  So funny to watch newbies die to level 1-5 enemies
---
39 rogue, 23 priest, 21 warrior
---
They literally never worked for me.
---
Greed the lockboxes, they can tip a rogue to open them later.
---
From the bright side you'll be more unique. :)
---
Ah the classic, "econ 101 I know what assets and holdings are, therefore youe argument is invalid." You're just a simple bootlicker, mate, using every single recycled talking point. You're not an economics whiz for knowing that the wealthy elite don't haul giant sacks of gold with them everywhere.
---
Yes. Grey = 0 xp
---
Most people consider Slavic regions eastern
---
So you're going to ignore the other 90% of what you said? Like, 
---
&gt;Good guilds need tanks for 5 mans and the 3-4 Guild Tanks can't do dungeons with absolutely everyone.
---
isn't you telling people that you expect them to tank whether they enjoy it or not?
---
There's a reason each and every guide written by anyone with any bit of experience recommends a slow weapon. Unless you know something the folks that have been playing WoW on private servers and the like haven't known for the past decade , you're just spouting nonsense.
---
Telling a hunter to use a fast bow is telling a warrior or sword rogue to use a put a 1.3 dagger in their mainhand. It's just bad.
---
Strat live and undead feel the same however we just never run them as a long mega dungeon. I did though doing strat live then dead right after dinging 59. Got 140k exp from that one adventure.
---
lol \^\^
---
it is not possible because there is lack of any taunt ability. No way your abilities are gonna sustain threat of a whole group. But good question, it is indeed a promising concept but with what little we have here, there is no way right now.
---
I definitely advertise myself as a Windfury Totem Dispenser when lfg.
---
Eh, no. That hasn't been a thing till a few years ago, actually.
---
this thread completely forgets how difficult brd is to navigate if you don't know 100% where you're going, even with wowhead, even with maps, even with youtube, it is still possible to get lost, flip the wrong lever, and ruin your fucking run that you just spent 2 hours on by closing the gate you needed to go through
---
dungeons got more linear after classic because pugs can't be trusted to know the way, and after classic is when blizz started catering to casual pug players. though they did wait until about halfway through wotlk to start being really obvious about it
---
Saw the post of how to kill with power word fort, it's an addiction. The flight to UC, the drop does 90% of max health, if you fort them you buff their health but not their max health, and they die.
---
I'm rezzing and paying repair bills, but if we're both flying to UC, I'ma try to kill you with PW:F.
---
Have you ever thought that maybe the main draw of the off pvp realm isn't that you have to pvp but rather that you are flagged so the possibility is there, but the players don't have to act on that possibility. It's interesting in itself that despite that ruleset players still have the choice to have these interactions. And that's what makes pvp great, it could go either way at a moment's notice. With pve it's not even wholesome because everyone is forced in that state anyway. Someone didn't choose to go against the grain like the pvp players do when they choose not to pvp.
---
ha
---
This is off-topic but I couldn't help but think this is the perfect example of why leveling guides are so op.
---
I remember doing that quest on a pserver about a year ago and after an hour I gave up and just bought the turtle meat from the AH.
---
This time through I figured I'd try a guide and I already had the meat in my bags from the shimmering flats quests, the guides just remind you to keep enough for the Turtle Bisque quest later.
---
Believe it or not in HEALTHY relationships sex isnt some reward exchanged for good deeds for one another. What the fuck?
---
The hard truth those mages are going to face is that they are gonna die horrible deaths in BG's because AOE ain't shit in pvp. I too blame the meta pointing mages to AOE as the way to go.
---
First character I ever played was a mage. I still remember the LK arena's. I had soooo much fun pvping. 
---
Think of it this way, a blizzard can kill lots of enemies over time. But if you spec that AOE into single target damage and resistance instead. You become a single target death dealer that can crowd control as they please when needed and destroy their buddy before the sheep even breaks once.
---
Okay
---
The mongoloids that take pictures of their monitor with their phones are probably the same people with alt codes in their names.
---
You missed the most important emote of all.
---
/yay
---
If a dude called me a 'homo' after camping him I'd make sure to keep him camped till I see a hearth or a log off.
---
It's been 15+ years and people still haven't realized that you can't complain about getting ganked if u roll on a PvP server.
---
Which won’t help unless they get the old people back.
---
I used to train level 1 support - it takes months before they become actually useful for anything but the basics and your level 2 and up staff just get more slammed.
---
I mean it’s still the long term answer, it just won’t show any real benefit for a while. Major mistake getting rid of reps right before a new product launches IMO for exactly this reason.
---
Wrong neighborhood lol
---
Your nova is not on cooldown, are you even trying?
---
Yep, it was amazing field day for white knights at HOTS subredit. Ofc until day came and HOTS was sorta killed. :D
---
People in general still want to view Blizzard as company they used to be.
---
I use Bartender.
---
Raid or party?
---
Popping a defensive cooldown and slapping a shield on during a raid as a dps warrior is a 100% fail.  BiS gear for DPS warriors is a mix of leather/mail/plate with things like +hit and +crit.  No dodge, health, armor, etc.  A fucking rogue can tank better than a dps warrior suddenly told to taunt Golemagg.
---
And if you are referring to UBRS, lol.  People regularly five man all the level 60 dungeons.  A warrior slapping a shield on to save the raid means a whole hell of a lot has gone wrong already.
---
buttons messed up on my old laptop :( new one coming in soon :)

okay well it's a feature that a good portion of the player base didn't appreciate because they couldn't figure out how to explore
---
believe it or not, "the lowest common denominator" make up the majority of wow's subscribers so blizz wasn't entirely wrong to pander to them and remove that kind of content from the game going forward
---
The impossible dream for Ret Paladins
---
I'm level 44 shadow preist but when I run dungeons I always heal just faster to get in a group and you can still heal just fine being shadow.
---
It's only better than everything else if you have enough to keep using the on use effect. Otherwise it's a statstick. If you aren't going to use the effect, use a different stat stick.
---
Question: Have you been sleeping?
---
Doesn’t make you a bad PLAYER though. How’s this, I’m done because you are simply a bad PERSON and I’m an idiot for having talked to you this long.
---
[seems ok to me](https://i.imgur.com/fCIzE2B.png)
---
probably fine with some int gear
---
Man that dungeon defined my Legion experience. I didn’t play much later in the expac but I remember having no classes and no assignments due on the day Return to Kara was launched. Sat down and made a few friends that day by grinding out the whole instance. It was somewhat difficult right on release and we had a really fun time with it.
---
Dude it's BiS for the entire game for feral dps. You can get your endgame weapon at lvl 30. Even for tanking the warden staff is lvl 43. While everyone else has to get to endgame for upgrades, you can start collecting yours now.
---
(((Oy Gevallts, hes gonna shoah me)))
---
This is awesome!
---
Healing power won’t matter for a long time.

Just got home, I run a *DETAILS* filter along with a *SHARPEN* filter.  
---
**DETAILS**  
---
Sharpen = 0%
---
Clarity = 50%  
---
HDR Toning = 10%  
---
Bloom = 10%  
---
**SHARPEN**  
---
Sharpen = 50%  
---
Ignore Film Grain = 15%  
---
Remember, these settings aren't universal and your monitor plays a heavy role.
---
Yes but a rogue can't taunt.
---
Wait, retail is slang for wow? Returning player here
---
There is no way to know when or even if TBC will show up. We do have 6(?) content phases planned for Classic, with ~3-4 months in between, so 2 years or so is my best guess.
---
You can play Ret Pally, and you might enjoy it. You can run 5 mans and pre-raid dungeons like UBRS and get decent gear. You will have to convince the Warriors you'll be running with to let you roll on the gear you'll need, but it can be done. Or you can find the very rare guild that will allow you to Raid as Ret.
---
The problem is, you don't bring any utility to a Raid that a Holy Paladin can't, and you won't come close to the DPS of Warriors or Rogues. Also, the tier 1 and 2 Paladin sets that drop in Raids are geared towards Holy Paladins.
---
It's just an uphill battle that takes a lot of time and effort on your part.
---
Bottom line is that there is a reason the class is so rare, even though the concept is very appealing. It's similar to Balance Druid. Cool concept, not really supported by current builds or itemization.
---
Rogues on the other hand can be effective in PvP or raids with less gear. They have one job and they do it well. Stabbing shit.
---
If you'd like to try something other than pure DPS to switch things up from Hunter, I'd suggest Druid. They are the least played class in the game, but Feral spec allows you to switch between tank, dps and healer pretty effortlessly, and they can find spots in Raids much easier than a Ret pally.
---
It's a shame. My main was a Ret Pally for a long time in TBC and Wrath, so I wish it was more viable too. Thems the breaks, though.
---
2 levels per day? You get like 10 levels within the first 2 hours.
---
Majority of players are not 60 yet. I would say they are high 40s-50s
---
You have your answer.
---
Yeah it was really annoying, especially when other guild members kinda sided with him when he obviously was in the wrong. Oh well, they sucked as people and at the game, and when i left later it made the raid team fall apart so that felt pretty nice.
---
I’m terms of pure mitigation it is tops. The AQ hammer tends to be the best overall since it’s great for threat and still has solid defensive stats though.
---
rofl imagine thinking you're some moral superiority because you picked one of two factions. news flash, both factions behave exactly the same.
---
Protecting the herd?
---
It's amazing how many of us have stories like this. Guess it's just loss being a universal experience, but it's nice to be able to connect with people in similar situations.
---
My mom and I used to share our account. I was always too busy leveling alts to hit 60 but I got to backseat drive during raids and such. I never did them myself back then so doing them now is much more of an emotional experience than I expected. After she passed our sub ran out 6 months or so later and I hadn't touched the game since.
---
Probably 2-4g an hours worth came from skinning.  Not sure about silk cloth mobs.
---
How do you feel about Earthfury now?
---
Tell me why all the alliance are running around with lvl 60s like some pussies. Soon as I gank one of you, you call your lvl 60 dad to come help. I’m still gonna get you and once I hit 60 I’m gonna get your dad too. I’m glad I picked horde this time around because the alliance is straight up sorry these days. Bots who don’t even know how to play the game.
---
Why the lol@frostsaber boots? Im OOTL
---
Was in a ZF run the other day, got to the duel boss at the end temple. Had a shaman healer who put down windfury. I was wielding ravager, and I swear, every whirlwind would proc the “spin mode” chance on hit. Felt real good.
---
That's good to know :) I'll hop back in and check it out. I assumed since they sliced and diced the development team, the updates and player base would dwindle.
---
Pleasantly surprised that's not the case.

I went to hillsbrad purely because its so much smaller than stonetalon and ashenvale

Also thinking of making a rogue.

I have max skinning and almost max enchanting on the druid. And closing in on the upper ranks of LW on the twink.
---
I dont have a mount. Wanna guess where my funds go? XD
---
quests give full xp as long as your level is within 5 levels of the quest's level.  so a level 40 quest gives full xp as long as you're 45 or below.  once you hit 46 it will give you less xp for 5 successive levels until it hits the minimum.  
---
1st level - 80% of total xp
---
2nd level - 60% of total xp
---
3rd level - 40% of total xp
---
4th level - 20% of total xp
---
5th level - 10% of total xp
---
actual quest color is irrelevant since all of this is determined on a static +5 scale whereas mob/quest color scales based on level.   the hogger quest turns grey at 17 (17-11 = 6 levels before grey) whereas target: felstone field turns grey at 64 (64-53 = 11 levels before grey)
---
Lot of hardcore players took time off work to grind out the first week or 2. And the raids aren't exactly difficult so those same hardcore players probably cleared first try.
---
I don't actually know, by retail I mean the game with all the expansions, and by classic I mean the thing released recently
---
Fuck.
---
I need to get the fuck out of STV ASAP
---
&gt; Feral Druids, Ret Paladins, Hunters, Rogues
---
Its gonna be hilarious when bg's hit and all those mages get eaten alive by the meme team.
---
I don't understand what this mage did wrong except for making a common mistake all mages make when learning how to aoe.
---
Pservers have been around forever. Glad you're touched though.
---
Upvoted for using a phone pic. also gz
---
Why you heff to be med, is only game?
---
Threads like these makes me want to go and slay gnomes in STV.
---
My guild ran into a similar issue this weekend because  they filled the UBRS run with non-60's and then told  the fillers that they can't roll on loot unless a 60 doesn't need it. Needless to say those under 60 left the group. HoJ is BiS for every Melee DPS until AQ40. You're grasping at straws when you say "Sorry this BiS trinket that you can equip at 54, no I deserve it more because I'm 6 levels higher than you". You have every right to not go with that run because you want to increase your chances, you don't have to be an elitist about levels of all things to communicate that sentiment.
---
Haha I know right? People are looking at this with some serious rose coloured glasses. You’d log a ticket and maybe get a reply in 2-3 days and it was often “figure it out yourself”.
---
It’s no excuse for bad support now but it was pretty bad back then.
---
I never implied it was a reward, sick fuck. Believe it not, in a healthy relationship something cute/nice/fun can easily lead to sex.
---
Guild banks
---
Updated talent trees are fine as long as they are still talent trees. 
---
Expanded content . Lots of zones not in use in classic.. they could be leveling zones or end game zones. 
---
More dungeons and raids as long as they don't invalidate any content.  Leave that content model in retail.
---
Better loot.  They can round out the loot tables better.  Better gear for off specs.
---
Graphic updates.
---
Some change or new content will have to come at some point or people will stop playing. We are probably a long time off from completing all the current phases but they do need some sort of plan in place for when that happens.
---
I don't really want classic to just be vanilla wow forever. I want it to take what vanilla wow is and build on that in a good way.  
---
I do hope they go the classic+ route
---
Okay, you don't think being new at something most probably makes you bad at it.
---
That is literally what this post is.  You are saying that warriors who don't play the way you expect are bad.
---
That isn't "I don't disagree"
---
It's, "Y U NO TANK? L2P NOOB!"
---
never thought of it that way, ill give that a go, i was trying to spam it to regain agro after taunting the mobs off the healer, guess to ease my troubles i need to reign in the dps a bit better rather than letting them go buck wild 
---
i was always worried about kicking dps since it stops the flow and we have to find a new member from left field, i guess being more assertive when it comes to getting things done will make it faster than just trying to personally adjust to the chaos 
---
thank you for the tip!
---
I was under the impression that it was a stun and as such it would NOT be interrupted by damage. Did you get any more info on this /u/knots- ?
---
Also depends on your outlook. Getting ganked and having to ghost walk 5 mins? That's just part of the game for me. I enjoy the leveling process, all the bad that comes with it. Some people can't take it and want to be on the grind constantly but I don't really care how long it takes me to level, if I want to go do some random thing that would be considered a waste of time I'll do it anyway.
---
Similar bug just happened in Badlands. Can't figure out how to fix it.
---
Considering the first 25-30 levels can be done in a couple days, it would only be 1 level a day. There are plenty of people still in the 40's right now. Why would it take as long now as it did then when we know where everything is this time?
---
On lower levels you can hold aggro pretty well on 1-2 mobs with roclbiter / ES, but you will OOM at some point and your mitigation is subpar. I think some shammy in vanilla tanked ony, but you need a raid to support you for that. It's not really a done or recommended thing to try.
---
No need to open so aggressive, fella! I guess rumors of its demise have been greatly exaggerated.
---
I used to play all the time, and lost interest when they announced they were cutting up the development team. I assumed that to mean updates would crawl to a standstill and the playerbase would dry up. Glad that's not the case.
---
Well it actually functioned this way during retail Vanilla and TBC as far as we know. Does it make the spec better than Mana Tide if you are rotating the Shaman into a caster group for Tide? I honestly dont know and am not sure we will be able to tell without a sim. Here is some early documentation on it:

*WFT's AP boost is almost certainly implemented as a modification to the player's AP for enough time for a swing. I've never seen any specific testing on it, but on a laggy server you can easily get multiple instants per fight that are about 445 AP (or 578.5) above where they should be that happen to be very close to WF procs. This is true for that WWS, too:*

*The "Duration	1.5 seconds" field seems relevant here. Clearly it isn't always lasting 1.5 seconds, but there's probably a reason why it's so long. In this log, there's a lot of cases where there's gaps of up to .5 seconds between the WF proc appearing and the hit appearing, and this is on a stable server (I assume). Given that, 1.5 seconds seems like a reasonable length to ensure that unless the server is dying the WF proc will consume the buff, but without letting the buff sit around forever. However, the buff sitting around forever is only a problem if it actually does something to non-WF swings.*
---
*None of this applies to the self-enchant, which is implemented as a server-side dummy effect. It's somewhat strange how different they are -- surely it would have been easier to just make the WFW effect generate rage as an additional effect rather than have two completly different implementations of the same spell.*
---
I feel the same. I play daily maybe like 5 to 8 hours(depending on my homework) and im only 46. I really wanna be doing MC and ony but im just too slow i guess. Dont worry tho im sure by the time we get 60 they'll still be plenty of people wanting to do raids. Im just reminding myself to enjoy the journey :D
---
Maybe, but battle.net has been plagued with issues across Southeast Asia and Mexico since the launch of classic if you search the forums. And they're not morons like me who chose a whole other continent to play on, they stuck with their own regions and are still suffering the same problems.
---
You can always go back and pick up the quests you missed.  Plus, there is also a cloth quartermaster that you can turn in cloth for rep
---
&gt; It's, "Y U NO TANK? L2P NOOB!"
---
Where do you see this
---
If you're Deep Prot spec: Revenge -&gt; Shield Slam -&gt; Sunder Armor -&gt; Heroic Strike/Cleave.  Threat/Rage usage. Do not over threat on things that are on you. This is the quickest way to get rage starved and have a pull fall away from you. Skull mark the first thing before you charge in and Shield Slam it when you get in and then try to get some hate on the others. Don't use threat moves on very low HP mobs, you can honestly taunt them back to you if you know they're going to do in a couple seconds. As you go through an instance with a group you'll be able to gauge how much you need per mobs generally. It's just something you gotta feel and get used to.
---
If you do things right then you can go into the next fight with a decent amount of Rage left over. Use Bloodrage to keep your Rage up if you have a wait a little for the healer to mana up. Deep Prot gives you Anger Management as well which is super helpful for dungeons.
---
But if you take one thing out of this. DO NOT OVER THREAT.
---
Edit - AoE threat in general just sucks. Tab target and try to throw out hard hitting things like Shield Slam AFTER you've taunted if something does get away from you. Throwing out threat moves before a taunt can't put you at a huge negative and sometimes won't even let you get ahead. Taunt will put you at the top and if the DPS manages to catch up you'll stay above and will be able to still push more threat and be on top.
---
True, I did get triggered by the narcicism of the post and the spec they just expect me to deal with.
---
I resorted to insulting/name calling instead of a legitimate argument and for that I appologise u/smokecocks
---
Jesus that really is your reddit name...
---
That spec is bad for multiple reasons. Armor and dodge do nothing for a healer in a raid enviorment and shouldnt be doing anything for a healer in a 5 man enviorment either. You are not utilizing the 5% heal crit or the 10% bonus healing which are extremely important. You also cannot take mana tide with that spec which means you will be severely under mana for every fight.
---
That spec may give you a 1 to 2 % dps increase for a single group but at the cost of nerfing your healer so hard they might as well not be there. Your dps is the least important part of a boss fight after tank survivability and healers ability to maintain over extended periods of time.
---
That spec comes no where near being viable and I suggest you learn a little more about how your healers operate and what their roles are within the raid. We are not your personal buff machines, we exist to keep the raid up as long as possible and buff where we can.
---
I'll be honest, if the fight is going longer than four minutes theres a chance I wont redrop WF for a third time due to mana constraints. Healing has priority, always.
---
I just learned that mistake myself. I did no sleeping yesterday and dinged like 7 times... my everything hurts... im too old for this.
---
We used to do this in my guild. Somebody would say something like "bet 5k" and would then /roll. If someone wanted to take the bet, they would do the next /roll XX until someone hit 1.
---
Rumbling Exiles in Arathi Highlands are good to grind for their vendor trash and Elemental Earth sells fairly well. The spot is often pretty quiet as few people need the elementals for quests, although people come to activate the altar in the middle of the spot every now and again
---
I think I did a whole level there. You could also consider the silithid spot in Shimmering Flats, is dead quiet and they're very easy kills with decent vendor trash (and there are 3 spots for a chest that can supplement earnings if you watch them hawkishly and get lucky with greens)
---
I feel bad for the people who have nothing better to do than play wow like that, not for the ones who can't play as much as they'd like.
---
Lvl 36 priest, leveling holy.  
---
I’ve been very loosely following Warcraft Tavern leveling guide BUT I follow 1-3 levels behind.  I get the extra levels via dungeons.  
---
Questing I also try to find someone to group up with, especially right when I get to a new zone.  STV has been great!  Lots of people eager to group up.   Often find warriors who are happy to group—we have good survivability and low down time.
---
Turn in cloth for rep in the NE capital city.
---
dude. I used be a huntard that rolled on everything. Now I'm older and wiser and you are 100% right. I'm level 39 and don't think I've rolled on a single blue item in a dungeon cause really non of it is hunter gear.
---
STV is definitely the Jacksonville of Azeroth.
---
What’s even worse is it’s not just a ninja looter the dude did it to guildies. This guy wants to join that guild... whatever to each their own but that’s just weird.
---
/fart
---
LADY PRESTOR SMELLS LIKE SULFUR, IM TELLING YOU.
---
Was this in Hinterlands yesterday?
---
Just my opinion...being able to funnel resources into your alt from your 60 would make life so much more chill.
---
Unless you really just want that 0-60 raw dog experience again...or if alliance cities really matter that much.
---
Personally, I love being able to send bags, money, and gear to my alt.
---
Unless it changed, the most straightforward or obvious way is probably to get max reputation with Darnassus. There is probably a much quicker way to do it but I haven't played Alliance in almost a decade so if I ever knew it, I don't anymore.
---
&gt;  Develop the talent trees up to WotLK;
---
While I would like to see maybe some talent reshuffling, this is a REALLY bad idea. I got hit with some nostalgia and tried to do some talent build on old tbc and wotlk calculators. 
---
You know what I realised?
---
You're basically forced to go fully into one tree and pick up some very underwhelming utility from other trees. There's no true hybrid builds like in vanilla and that's a bad thing.
---
&gt; + Allow some kind of mount for levels 10-39;
---
Why?
---
&gt;  Add some form of dungeon finder (maybe);
---
Hell no
---
I'm sure there are addons that color code nameplates.
---
It'll come with experience, though. You'll pick up on things like Warlocks have demon pets following them around and Priests have bubbles around them. Knowing which races can be which classes helps a lot, too. If you see an Undead running around with 2 swords or daggers and he isn't wearing Plate armor, you know it's a Rogue because Undead can't be Hunters. Stuff like that.
---
I'm looking for a replacement for Thrash blade now that I'm 60, as a DPS Warrior. I see the pre-raid BiS lists Ironfoe and Dalrend's MH sword as top picks. But I really doubt I'll ever get either of them with the drop rates being so low and the high competition for them.
---
What other MH swords are still an upgrade that are more reasonable to get? I've gotten Mirah's Song but I assume that's a OH only weapon for Fury. I'm eyeing that Baron Rivendare's 1h Sword with a proc effect. I don't know if that's a any good or not.
---
I have a ton of nostalgia for WC and roll Horde but goddamn is the layout whack. I don't mind winding paths and labyrinthine layouts, it just doesn't make any sense.
---
Deadmines is a much better similar level dungeon.
---
That's what me and my friends did. Our first full-guild MC was last night, after having to PUG half of it the week before.
---
I met my late husband in WoW in 2010. We had a special Iceberg during Wrath we used to sit on and fish for hours. He passed away in 2017. My eyes are welling up thinking of your special memories with your brother. It is amazing this game has touched so many of us and left dear memories. Thank you for sharing.
---
Tabing around and tapping every thing you want to stick to you is pretty much what you have to do. Also if you have strong DPS that will not focus your skull you may have to reverse target tank. 
---
IE. Identify who in your DPS is hitting the hardest and then target their target to hold agro against their damage.  It's allways going to be a challange  but yea like Yadilie says if you don't spend your rage on things you don't need too you will do much better overall.
---
Also, before taming he shows as belonging to the Cenrarion Circle, the only beast in the game with a faction, iirc.
---
People are getting grumpy. I got put on ignore today because I didn't feel like joining a random group invitation for a quest I was on.
---
This is what I tell every tank: Pull while I'm drinking so you can build threat on every mob.
---
That's definitely a fair point.  I think Classic+ obviously has the most potential for longevity (like OSRS), but naturally you run the risk of those updates immediately screwing up the game and essentially killing it.  At least with BC and WotLK, we would be pretty much guaranteed to get ~6 solid years of WoW out of it.  Probably the last 6 before hanging it up, since retail will presumably be completely rotted away by then.
---
This. I have both details and tinythreat because not everyone uses the same thing.
---
All together it was about 6-7g
---
Sense the sarcasm young one
---
tanaris is great as solo shadow with sometimes random grouping on quests. Then feralas
---
And welcome first poster. At least you didn't accidentally get shadow banned and no one tell you for 4 to 5 months of you posting things and randomly one day a mod of a sub Reddit tells you they think your shadow banned. Even though it got overturned as I was "accidentally" shadow banned I still just made a new account and kept on trucking on as it didn't get overturned for like 3 more weeks.
---
Honey, that looks nothing like Florida. Try STV, or Dustwallow Marsh.
---
Fair point. I’ve yet to try Mara solos so I’m not entirely sure on that one but that’s what my Druid/hunter buddies were sayin.  since I’m a mage I don’t have to deal with any of that  and I can just aoe farm ZF.
---
Call it AltAnon
---
He's saying you should watch the full clip before commenting. The comment you replied to says to imagine being so **afraid** of someone that you would rather swim through lava. The warlock cast fear on him. Get it now?
---
I was going through WC the other day and a level 25 just went MIA and I was like "you okay buddy" and he fell and pulled a shitton of mobs. I don't know how you manage to do that.
---
Great recommendation.  Head on over to a dead sub.   Or.. perhaps you are using a dead sub as a demonstration of how unpopular classic+ really is?
---
🤔
---
I think the thing Blizzard did really well in Classic was giving classes/professions a lot of restrictions that require another class/profession to work with in order to succeed.
---
Engineers need blacksmiths for certain parts, tailors need alchemists for transmutes, alchemists need blacksmiths for rods, leatherworkers need engineers for salt shakers etc. This encourages player interaction (unless you just AH it all for ridiculous markups), so you end up chatting to someone, potentially farming up the mats and getting a cool item created.
---
It's really similar to the classes, there's no one class that can do everything so you will always need to interact with other players in order to accomplish the really difficult tasks. This creates new friends, enemies and alliances with the opposing faction that make the world feel real. 
---
I also think the Alliance/Horde dynamic is great, it gives a font for hate towards something and since there's no interaction between the two, there's none of that bitching/whining if you kill someone from the other faction.
---
NA, Horde on Grobbulus or willing to make a character of any faction on Deviate. Looking for an RP guild on a RP-PVP server, and preferably one that takes part in PVP.
---
Recently I saw my first RP event, players were arranged in a circle and some would come to the center and emote occasionally, but nothing was being said supposedly because they were a guild talking in guild/raid chat. I want to get in on something like that.
---
I think a tooltip would be good - just something to make it a bit easier as I learn who is who. 
---
I'll look for some add-ons.  I need training wheels lol
---
Frost Mage or Resto Druid.
---
"Carried" implies the content cannot be completed without the non meme specs. You can do entire runs of meme specs just fine. It just takes a little coordination
---
lellel yeet
---
I like that in WoW Classic you're not flooded with loot. It makes it to where upgrades are more noticeable and enjoyable.
---
Are you a super hardcore pvper? If not then you're fine
---
Purging shields and combat buffs can really fuck you leveling, especially clothies.
---
You can most definitely go for Dalrends. I see tons of people with them and have seen them drop fairly often myself.
---
Imagine being did secure that you don't care what other randoms think on the internet.
---
Always put a raid marker on this guy. Always.
---
Tell me your secrets!
---
What do you recommend as a good starting farming for someone working towards their epic mount?
---
Horde still have like double the dungeons in their territory than Alliance has in their territory.
---
Go ahead and give all your loot to the MT then. 
---
But don't come crying to me when he gets burned out of spending months running an instance he's "finished" and either quits or changes guild.
---
Elvui
---
&gt;  leather blue pieces pre 40 and even mail pre BiS without strength is STAGGERINGLY rare.
---
As a feral druid, I can say the same about gear lacking strength.
---
Yes changez
---
I think you should play the class you enjoy more. Gearing may be competitive, sure, but you should still get raid slots.
---
I used to have a vanish and remove all items that can take durability hit macro. Saved me a ton of money back in the day. Did get some... dude why are you naked questions tho.
---
I love the kills that are just so simple and subtle like that. A well placed silence or root is all it takes.

It was a haste-y decision. I realized it about 15 minutes after taming him, but at this point I was heading to the store. And I wanted to post him as soon as I grabbed him from the tree. Like I said, sorry lol
---
Do you not understand that saying someone is bad at a game is an insult?
---
They are not playing their class to their ultimate potential but to say they are bad is far reaching and excessive.
---
I just set up macros for all my heals that let me just mouse over their names instead of targeting them. Usually I'll leave the tank targeted, and just mouseover their party icons for a quick heal...but sometimes I guess I forget I have it on and target who I want and leave my cursor just in the middle of my screen somewhere and someone random gets overhealed instead of whoever actually needed it. But I'm learning.

Lava runs take 15-20 minutes

hey, sorry i stepped on your toes. i actually didn't mean to hurt you, i meant it in a humorous manner.

Lol thank you very much.

Biggest advice - Slow things down! 
---
You can be successful without instant gratification.
---
&gt; Warlocks have demon pets following them around and Priests have bubbles around them. 
---
This right here - that's what I'm after haha.  I suppose experience will be the ultimate teacher, but these little things to look out for will help immensely.  
---
I also wanted to ask what a 'twink' was but I don't want to google that word on my work computer haha ... I'm aware of what it is in the context of adult cinema...
---
this quest is stupid.  6 mobs with a low drop rate, in one of the most populated zones in the game
---
Hi, welcome to Vanilla. Vanish doesnt work too as well. You'll learn it eventually. Gg.
---
pretty.
---
Rogues vanish, don't feel bad about playing dead.
---
You can (and should) farm MCPs for main tanking anyway. Warden staff is good but unnecessary, the extra threat is way more useful to your raid.
---
PILE ON
---
It's worse than that.
---
He's in STV with his third character, which indicates at or near mid 40's.  So we can give him the benefit of the doubt, and say that at 6 days /played per lvl 60, he's at right about 15 days total /played time.
---
He would have to be playing for about 11-12 hours per day since launch to get where he's at right now.
---
I would not want to be that mans unlucky sock.
---
Make dps warriors shit or make other hybrids do good dps. Im fine with there being a hybrid tax but then at least make it apply to all hybrids
---
Like fuck you just answer the question or shut up.
---
I'd wear that with pride. I can't bring myself to waste the gold on ours
---
Still applies to literally every shot, mang. Every instant you cast during your auto-shot cast time is a clipped auto. It adds up really, really fast. Especially for weapons with high attack speeds.
---
You're arguing well-known math and mechanics that have existed for almost 15 years. It's no secret. It doesn't matter if the OP is BM, Marx, or Surv, these mechanics still matter and affect his damage and saying otherwise is simply incorrect. 
---
It's one thing to say that you don't care about the clipping(I agree here. BM is shit for endgame but even so there are still people who min/max it), but saying there is no point to manage clipping is teaching him to shoot himself in the foot when it comes to dealing damage. It's bad practice and, what's worse, it's misinformation.
---
Not just Europe, my friend has a crap laptop and wanted to look at his toons on my gaming pc so he logged into his account and instantly got suspended. We live less than three miles apart. No VPNs or anything like that, just different IPs and ISPs.

He called Blizz and they removed the suspension quickly, but still.

You know you have a post where you claim you never party and avoid doing dungeons at all costs, right?
---
Do you just make a lot of stuff up or?
---
Yeah, the layout is better than OG for many classes and if you're not questing in the Eastern Kingdoms, it has the better flight paths for horde.
---
Currently playing with my younger brother, who was too young to fully grasp the game when it was first released in 2004, so this is his first real play through.  Little does he know I will be dragging him to Gallows End Tavern for a drink before logging tonight.
---
I gave up after 30m of that. Abandoned, and never looking back.

Why would you have any interest in something you hate?

NugRunning, WeakAuras2, etc.

If they have to go to these extremes to stop gold farmers, I'm OK with it.

Or you could just /ignore asshats, that way if someone actually needs help in chat you may still be able to see it and help.

Was waiting for the zep UC to ORG. Jump on. Notice as we are heading off there is a level 19 dude standing on the outside edge. Couldnt get onto the zep in time, so just ran at the side (I assume). As soon as we loaded through to ORG side, he fell off. Right out int he middle of the water. Thats a long ass swim. I was cracking up for about 10 mins at the unfortunate-ness of the scenario. He seemed to find it pretty funny when I messaged him about it. I sent him 2G for the laugh
---
Well, you're certainly trying to prove your point.
---
As long as people are upfront and clear about requirements and rules I do not see any problem with reserving anything.  Sure if you spam "Lf4M angerforge spam hoj on reserve" in world chat you're gonna get laughed at but if you can somehow put together a group for that with people who agree to those terms, good for you.
---
Sounds just like activision customer support alright. Not giving a shit.
---
I can understand that people would be insulted by it but I don't think it's something that should be insulting. Do you think bad team player makes it incorrect?
---
You're a good person for helping the NE get it and respecting that he was there first ❤ Very wholesome story

u need 1 tank 2 healers, a hunter to kite drakki and maybe 3-4 other dps and it doesn't really matter what they are

2 60s and 3 35s, dungeon leveling is op.

No changes, once you give the alliance barbers, they will demand to nerf horde racials, pay to win level boosts, and wowtokens
---
Still think it would be funny if his stomp gibbed gnomes and dwarves instantly.
---
Well it hasnt been easy to get to 51 i tell you.  i have about 5 days played total and i dont normally just stand around, if i am waiting for a dungeon group i am grinding, never spend any real time in major cities, 
---
I get about 2 to 3 hours per night after work and i play about 5 to 6 hours saturday then the same again on sunday.
---
It is no way near as a grind as it was back in the day, i think its because we are on the TBC pre patch or whatever xp is nerfed i feel because i remember it took me 2 months from 50 to 60 and back then i was not working so i was playing alot.
---
I agree with the feign death, however the pet movement issues were introduced in one of the latter patches in Vanilla.  It might even have been 1.12 actually.  I even made a video on it back in the day to share with a GM.   IDK what pet you're using but I was using one of the snakes from ST for the poison spit.   Those things were utterly broken by that patch - they would move forward a few yards, pause for a split second, a few more yards, and so on.
---
Yo, those are 3s 75c each!

I didn't appreciate getting an upgrade to Spinal Reaper 20 minutes after entering the zone.

oops ran wine with sudo and now ive got a flying mount

Scenario 1: You download some game from Steam. It has a bug that has 1/100000 chance of reproducing and it does on your machine where it deletes root of your C:\\ drive. Without UAC dialog, it will happily destroy all your files. With UAC, you can say 'No, I don't want this program have admin rights'.
---
Scenario 2: There's a 0-day browser export and you happen to be googling something. You visit a website and it causes code to be executed on your machine. With UAC dialog, it will limit what damage it can do. Without it, you're done.
---
It's not about common sense. It's about limiting your exposure because *shit happens*.
---
I once got declined trying to buy something from my work that cost 2 bucks, when I've had direct deposit for over a year. Banks do fuck up on occasion hahah. They even called me on my work phone to confirm the purchase, I was like "yes, and also, don't ever call here again wtf. Use my personal number".
---
Yeah that’s the exact system. Lots of potential loss for minor rewards
---
In fairness, he could have been trying to help you on that first Raptor. If you missed a few times, maybe he was casting a spell, or doing a driveby instant to try to help your kill speed.    
---
I know that's happened to me as a Warrior charging at a mob just for movement and rage, but actually ended up getting the first hit when a rogue missed 5 times.
---
Buuuuut the other behavior makes me think this isn't the case.
---
Everything goes with you (except guild and friendslist)
---
Classic is all that matters, loving it!
---
Hence why BC was ultimately the best and worst expansion for WoW. It built off of Classic and revamped a lot of things and at the same time it built off of classic and revamped a lot of things for the worse.
---
A if autorunning since you can just tab out and let your bankchar run into the wall at A from the mailbox at the bank

The drama is solved, the debt is paid, everyone had a laugh. At the end, the other GM said it's all been scripted and, "fuck reddit" followed by a clip of him doing the same thing.
---
Fucking trolled.
---
Depends on your goals, having a warrior to tank/ dps is great in combo with something like a mage or druid that  can world farm quickly
---
Woops, somehow glanced right past that
---
I am not sure if this has been asked already, however do you happen to have an Authenticator on your account?
---
The also kicked people who weren’t on the roofs. There was a post about that here as well and that player echoed the same thing. Contacted CS explained he never was on the roof and they said kick rocks. He pushed it to a manager and they were oops yeah you weren’t on the roof you just happened to be near by. So OP might want to push this to a manager as they seem to actually care.
---

---
Not a bad Xmog XD
---
Absolutely. I started my original account just before BC dropped, so I never got too far before the new expansion. I played on and off, never getting far at all because i had no idea what i was doing as a kid. Never really got into the swing of things until Cata, so being able to have a nostalgic but fresh and new experience has made me love Classic so much
---
enchanted mageweave pouch is for enchanting items only. You must disenchant an item and the materials can be moved into it.
---
It will only hold enchanting mats
---
Prioritize highest dps wand. Keep another wand in case you cross an immunity. Example: water elementals will be immune to frost damage wands which will make it hard to kill them absent spamming your shadow or holy spells.
---
Only enchanting items can go in the container. Items like dream dust, vision dust, etc. It doesn't hold any other type of items.
---
Just did all the quests in shimmering flats—a skinner’s DREAM. Ended with 7 stacks of medium leather &amp; four stacks of heavy.
---
AOE LOOTING
---
i would like to see the areas of the current classic map filled in and story for those areas added.  I would maybe, possibly, i am not even sure but the quest lines streamlined to make them more linear and able to flow from zone to zone easily.  
---
Other than that nothing really
---
Not by default, that is for low health only.
---
Seriously, 95% of the time it just seems to be some guys trying to make the Barrens Chat meme happen and then some dude going "man I love barrens chat" because someone told a joke as if it was the most amazing thing to happen that would never be done in a different zone.
---
im playing a mage, i've been aoe farming for weeks, 18days played, 0 epics found
---
Burning Crusade.
---
so its not bannable or it is?:( Really want to mute footsteps of ram
---
This REALLY needs more upvotes.  More people should know/use this.
---
Especially if someone drops group halfway through the run.  No need to send someone back to city to spam or disband your group.  Just /join LookingForGroup and find people in seconds.
---
Krol Blade/Mirah's Song. Not even that expensive at this point.
---
Mage is the new hunter
---
&gt;That spec may give you a 1 to 2 % dps increase for a single group but at the cost of nerfing your healer so hard they might as well not be there.
---
Like i said in op, you have an arguement for shazz currently. But a 2% dps for 15 people is enough to make raid encounters shorter thus needing less mana.
---
But 94 ap is currently more than 10%, more ap than most melee users have at the moment, it is very noticeable when shamans are using this talent and when they're not.
---
I originally rolled a Draenei Shaman back in the day and grew really attached to both the Alliance and the class. Choosing between a Shaman and the Alliance really tore me apart this time around.
---
Very constructive
---
Same. Ive been trying to break the stereotypes. Though the tank I run with is an IRL buddy so sometimes ill blizzard a single mob just to fuck with him and it SETS off the others in the group.
---
Wait are you trying to put non-enchant related Mats into it?
---
No problem! Improved Charge increases the rage generated by charge, at max rank it'll generate 21 total rage so you can Thunderclap as soon as you reach the group. Thunderclap is mainly for grabbing some aoe threat, for single target a lead off with shieldslam personally. 
---
I'm Prot/Arms  for stance dancing so improved charge was pretty easy to reach. Another talent I recently spec'd into (and recommend) is Improved Revenge to give it a 45% chance to stun, not too useful in raids but it made tanking dungeons so much easier!
---
I was concerned I sucked as a tank, those two talents made a huge difference for me. Once you have the gear you can always spec out of revenge and/or charge.
---
Edit: also try using a weapon other than a dagger if that's what you're using, for some reason I couldn't hold anything with one, not sure why lol
---
Its an enchanting bag, not a normal bag.
---
This is what I really had a problem with
---
Seems to generalize awfully hard to me.
---
Only annectdotal too.
---
I don't think your shadow talents help with wand damage... I always like getting high max damage wands.
---
It's a strategy that gives you a high probability to make a small amount of money and a small probability to have a catastrophic loss. The expected value is still even. If you play 4 times starting with $1 you have a 93.75% chance to win $1 and you have a 6.25% chance to lose $15. That means  your expected winnings is $.9375 and your expected losings is $15*6.25% which is $.9375. That's an expected outcome of $0. Which is the exact same thing as any single 50/50 probability event.
---
That's exactly what you are doing by saying fire will die faster.
---
You understand the issue of poor aoe threat and decided that you can make up for it with talents instead of realizing that you should adjust your tactics instead. 
---
A pack of 4+ elite mobs doesn't scream aoe to me.  It says I need to make sure I have good cc and burn mobs down fast.  If threat is split between you and the tank, I'm healing the tank, not ressing you, and finding a mage who understands there are spells other than Blizzard during trash.
---
Your whole attitude towards using Aoe when there are 2 mobs on the tank are why mages are the most hated class in Classic right now.  It used to be hunters who multi shot and broke cc or had growl on.  Now, because you think aoe = normal, mages are a liability and I'd gladly pass on one for more melee dps or a elemental shaman.  They know how to manage aggro and won't wipe the group because "that's how everyone else plays"
---
To Gorishurai, hear hear!
---
But now i have my 60 on follow when i lvl alts. Works great
---
The point is it's not his guild or his raid.

I enjoyed this exchange.
---
~~Oh, well then it's being caused by an add-on, because I don't use any add-ons and I don't get the screen flash on aggro.~~  (Referencing u/GloomyBison).
---
This is incorrect.  You have to type "/console screenedgeflash 0" without quotes in game to fix this issue.
---
Never replace spin axe

But if stock prices go up due to showing increased profit its basically just putting the money into the stockholders pockets.

which ones do you want to know? I have quite a few.

* Unit Frames: Shadowed Unit Frames

* Chat: Prat 3.0
---
* Top Bar: Titan Panel
---
* Minimap: Sexymap
---
* Buffs/Debuffs: Raven
---
font is century gothic bold

that's what you can see on screen :)

Fuck those slimes. They never synced with my computer and made me look like an idiot when I died THREE times. REEEE
---
Just wondering, whats the use of double crip? Isn't OH crip enough?
---
Yeah pretty sure that's fine but this guy was there for around 3 days same thing. He was just farming gold and the area has a drop rate for the fires and also has a quest item in the middle.
---
I'm glad to see this. Soon I'll be traveling abroad for a week vacation and thought about bringing my laptop with me. Not anymore.
---
As a side note. A few years ago I was working abroad and a new expansion came out for Star Craft 2. My account was suspended but I managed to resolve the issue. Clearly, Blizzard's customer support lowered their standards.

Gnome is the best Warlock race. There is nothing like dotting the shit out of someone, fearing them and draining their soul while spamming laugh during the whole thing.

John Staats, vanilla dungeon designer, talks about how Blizzards original concept for dungeons came from other games where dungeons were not instanced and instead a part of the open world. They thought at first maybe it would just be a tough place in the open world that anyone and everyone could go to at any time, in different groups even, since it was not instanced.
---
When John originally designed a number of dungeons blizzard had no idea how they were even going to use them. 5 man? 10 man? Instanced or part of the open world? Bigger or smaller? One boss, or multiple bosses?
---
John didnt even know where the portal for entering wailing caverns would start. The cave that you walk through first just to get to the wailing caverns portal was originally the actual dungeon itself until another designer said "okay, so the dungeon will start in the back of the cave you made." John said that he originally designed the big room before the portal to be the boss room, and thought the entrance of the dungeon would be at the mouth of the cave. He was then told to keep going. And going. And going.
---
Their concept was to seamlessly blend the dungeon and the real world together, and to do this there was no idea or blueprint beforehand. He was simply told "we need a space for a dungeon, it's a cave, and there are dinosaurs in it." This is all of what John said he was told before going off and making wailing caverns.
---
The same applies for many many dungeons in vanilla where there was no idea of what the dungeon would behold. They simply created for the sake of creating, and filled in ideas as they went.
---
Do you just openly constantly tall about being a part of the LGBTQ community because maybe uts just me on benediction but we have multiple people who are in gay relationships in my guild and it's not even a thing...sorry to hear the ridicule u have been getting
---
Bad = insult.  Period.  Whether you can accept that idiom of the English language or not is up to you. 
---
You'd get more productive conversations if you flip it around and cheer on the people who do pick up a shield and tank instead of calling out those who don't.
---
I've had normal items in it for like the past week though
---
My first thought as well
---
&gt; There is no way to know when or even if TBC will show up. We do have 6(?) content phases planned for Classic, with ~3-4 months in between, so 2 years or so is my best guess.
---
I honestly believe it is more "when" than "if".  There are too many iconic experiences from the early game to be missed.
---
What I do hope is that WHEN they do it, they learn their lesson on not bringing back any features that would once again push people away from the community that has reformed in Classic.
---
I have never played classic wow, but a year ago when my Blizz account got hacked I talked to the absolute best CS rep I've EVER talked to in my life. He was so kind and helpful. This story really is upsetting to hear. I hope Blizz CS hasn't gone to shit ☹️
---
Yeah not gonna lie, the first thing I thought was "wow that's sad" and I am certainly not jealous of the "achievement" since I have straight up zero desire to have an alt. I don't even have an alt on retail (where it's been extremely easy to level and maintain an alt for many years now).  It just IS sad, nothing to do with me or where I'm at.
---
I always /flop at people. If there’s a lot of smiley faces being used in chat I usually say, “d:-)..... he’s wearing a hat!”

You did nice. Maybe he'll less of a douchebag IRL after that.
---
I had a lvl 56 warrior DPS in Sunken Temple who ONLY used charge and heroic strike                   ????
---
Are those the same or different things?
---
If different, what are the differences?
---
You can also make this jump just by running off, you can really *only* fuck this up by jumping lol.
---
I got my gnome there at level 2 and have been doing almost all darnusses rep quests. Level 20 now, and about 15% into honored. I know I'll have to do the runecloth grind at the end anyways, but it's nowhere near as bad as for you :)
---
Resell for profit. Would never use on a warr.
---
Hits like a wet noodle in PvP compared to the 3.6s+ 2hers. Too fast of a swing to properly work with a 2H slam build or mortal strike.
---
And the strength/sword spec procs does not have nearly enough uptime to make up for those two shortcomings.
---
This sword along with the really cool ZF one (Sul'Thraze) are basically just vanity items at best. It's sad that whirlwind axe still manages to outshine two epics in the low 50s... but that's classic itemization for you.
---
If you spec into improved charge it should give you enough rage to basically immediately use thunderclap after you’ve charged
---
Yeah, Warrior Tank, Rogue, Shaman, Mage, Priest heals, feels like we can 5 man the universe.
---
Keep in mind that if you're a shammy looking for end-game, you're probs going to be relegated to resto. And almost all raid tier gear is either going to be resto or have lots of competition with other classes.
---
I'd be keen for FP at the top of STV :p
---
Am I the only one who remember some quest items dropping from skinning a mob? Like the whelps in Redridge dropping scales or the beasts in wailing caverns dropping deviate hides.
---
Haha yup. This is Son of Arigal for Forsaken.  Bastard comes from nowhere.
---
The default tooltip should show say something like "Level 25 Tauren Warrior" in the bottom right of your screen. ...I think.  Now I'm starting to doubt myself.  But yeah don't sweat it, a lot of it just comes with experience seeing other players, and I still occasionally do the whole "oh, I thought that warlock was a mage" thing.
---
I'm torn between leveling another character or not. On one hand it's handy to have an alt for various reasons, on the other hand it's a slippery slope to not having any free time left. With one char you will eventually only log for raids and whatever farming you need to do (plus pvp when feeling like it), with more.. yeah.
---
I’m a priest and got ignored because I didn’t give someone water lol
---
Is this supposed to offend me?
---
yeah Overall DPS &gt; The Shaman's precious ego
---
I did the same thing actually! I switched back to Shadow at 42.
---
TIL that taking on someone higher level than you is a dishonorable action. Clearly for it to be honorable they needed to be skull marked for you.
---
Seriously, I have a macro that is just /moo that I keep on a bar. When I'm waiting on ships I trade 1 ice cold milk to my neighbors and spam moo at them.
---
You should be able to vendor them to decent profits. Few people are going to buy them, since whoever can use them could also craft them themselves.
---
A macro is not an addon, it's a command in text form telling the game what you want to do.
---
If you write /target Leeroy in the chat line the game will try to target any creature whose name starts with Leeroy. A macro is simply saving such a command with the ability to place it on your action bar like any other spell or ability. You can make them by pressing "New" in the macro menu of the game.
---
An example:
---
/cast \[@mouseover, help, nodead\] Flash Heal
---
Making a macro with this text will create a button that casts Flash Heal if 1. you are mousing over a target, 2. it's friendly to you and 3. it's NOT dead.
---
Macros can have more or less conditionals (the ones in brackets) and several spells and modifiers. They are very powerful tools, and can make you much more effective at any class.
---
Here is a guide for priests:
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/priest-healing-macros-classic-wow](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/priest-healing-macros-classic-wow)
---
Hope this helps
---
E: Remember that "mousing over" is hovering your mouse over either a player model OR a player frame. So when I play healer more or less all my helpful spells are macros with some kind of mouseover, so all I have to do is hover over the raid or party frame and push the button. Never have to change target.
---
I've tanked... a lot.  Also, a general rule... if I die, it's the healers fault.  If the healer dies, it's my fault.  If DPS dies, it's their fault.
---
If a hunter manages to get the drop on me, its my own fault. Ive not lost to a hunter in a fair 1v1 yet.
---
If he gets the drop on me at max range ill blink away, sheep pet and run. Mount up and run into him. Hunters do not have the advantage. Its a very onesided matchup favoring the mage.
---
I looked at the drop rates and saw the MH was 4% chance to drop. That sounds awfully rare. Are you sure it's not the offhand that's common?
---
I'm in the perfect camp of playing guild wars 2 ( a blatant crap rip off of vanilla wow sorry lot sorry) and old school runescape( perfect blend of nostalgia and community) so finding wow classic and joining the hype train just to find out why world.of warcraft has been the GOLD standard for mmo's since it release. It truly is amazing how impressive it feels to clear a dungeon or get a good drop and even though there are some assholes out there, mostly the community has been nothing but helpful and amazing! Lvl 53 enhance shaman benediction server!
---
Some of the CS employees were probably part of that big layoff earlier in the year.
---
Good luck with that. It's just bots that buy anything valuable under a certain value the second it's posted.
---
Sorry, dont have time the teach you Etiquette anymore. Have fun stealing.
---
I think that if something is possibly in-game it's the dev's job to make it impossible if it is against the rules. Anyone who got banned/warned for sitting on a roof and casting on people should be allowed to unless it requires external software to do.
---
Uhh guess they just missed some of the drops. I'll have to keep an eye out for that when I get there.
---
Demo is ok for getting initial threat but not holding it.
---
On pulls of 3 or more:
---
Charge, thunderclap, demo...
---
Sunder#1 on **Skull**...
---
Revenge#1 on **X**...
---
Sunder#2 on **Skull**
---
Tab target/manual switch and sunder/revenge/melee as necessary between whatever is being focused by group and another mob in the pull.
---
But all this cannot happen if your group doesn't respect the first sunder on skull, or start spamming aoe before you get some swings/revenges on the off targets. Make sure they understand this!
---
Shield spikes also help a buttload (also druid thorns and imp's fireshield so definitely keep those up 100%)
---

Enough gold that the person could basically trade it in for another BoE he CAN use. That makes basic sense. Hell he could even offer to trade it to someone in the party for another item or gold and so on.
---
You have the ability to kill mobs rather quick with your pets and high damaging spells. You might be able to even just do some low level dungeon farming and make gold that way.
---
I checked OP's post history and they have 4 posts in the last 3 months. I'm guessing it's a really sad troll account bought for free advertisement.

The Griffin looks like a bird from that point of view. And guess what cats like to eat?

Correct.

Basically the same issues as pally tanks. Limited by Mana and don’t have that sweet Taunt.
---
Use a VPN
---
Not every player is mentally capable of being that flexible though. Unless they're playing in some cutting edge guild that needs everyone to be able to master every spec and every setup, I really don't see what the fuss is about.
---
Tbh its almost never 'broken'.
---
However Almost every time you refill it , it goes out of temp, and will either enter heat or freeze mode, in which the quality of the ice-cream is so bad we just take it off the menu rather than have customers complain.
---
edit: i work at Mcd and refilling that machine is one of my jobs.
---
In classic?  I thought that was something that got changed later on
---
In some ways I prefer World PvP without the honor system. It feels more honest in a way. That guy isn’t grinding honor. He was just in a warpath and I crossed it
---
lol I remember this, BC rage nerf was rough at first
---
For the level it is great as a stat stick.  But green BoE items of the Monkey/Tiger/Bear are better and you can get easier imo.
---
You don't have access to enough inventory slots to seriously impact a realm economy, and the relatively slight profit margin you might eke out due to price differences is not much of a concern. Especially balanced against the fact you're at least semi-permanently transferring your character to a new realm.
---
Cath runs. There’s 3 different blues that sell for a decent amount and if you’re quick you can do about 2 runs an hour. That plus turning the cloth drops into bandages and vendoring them is how I made my mount money.
---
&gt; You can talk to Lokhtos if you need to turn in anything for TB rep, or buy any TB rewards (or just vendor your trash).
---
Thorium Brotherhood, not Thunder Bluff, for anyone else momentarily confused
---
Oh crap, I forgot about that. That's so incredibly sad. They used to be amazing.
---
You'll be able to still heal dungeons as shadow.
---
I leveled as disc/shadow and will be respeccing shadow at 40.  Also still going to be healing dungeons on the way
---
You forgot the most powerful one. /e

I've always found it funny that the undead version of the thanks emote is "Gee, thanks" in the most sarcastic tone imaginable. I don't have any way to be sincere!

That dumb logic applies to you and your posts too, ya genius.

Have about 60 rend kills can't get Dal'rends mainhand. I'm just gonna use thrashblade forever.

---
Yikes...
---
Man, gold is really expensive now through the normal channels I use. I make a really good living and have no issues buying gold whenever i feel like it typically.
---
But $2 for 1g ? $1 for 1g if you're lucky? fuck that.
---
~~what add-on gives you all that additional info?  (Suggestion: disenchant, etc)?~~
---
~~If you don't mind sharing, of course :P~~
---
Nevermind saw you answered this already
---
Only if they are neutral to you. (You can duel a horde in the barrens as alliance but you cannot duel a horde in STV)
---
Sounds like an auction house bot name.
---
You basically just rephrased my question into an answer without actually answering it. Looking for specific places or enemies.
---
Sure
---
&gt; so I don’t have to have a macro filled hot bar for my emote addiction
---
I think you missed this enormous chunk of his sentence.
---
My original point got diverted by the idiot upstairs talking about autoshot clipping which had nothing to do with what I was talking about pertaining to beastmaster training and fast or slow weapons. Yes clipping can be used in any case, but my point originally was that unless you have aimed shot it doesn't matter what weapon you have. Slower weapon or faster weapon makes no different unless you have a man shot because you can shoot multi shot or any other shot in between any bow, gun, or crossbow.
---
Not everyone likes the sound of loud metal chickens.
---
Two hours and you guys only downed three bosses? Tbf I would have left as well. There is other stuff I have to do and spending 3-4 hours on a LBRS run isn't fun for anybody.
---
Holy fuck lmao go outside.
---
Mages in Classic are the Hunters of Vanilla, but worse.
---
47 shaman, 29 mage and 21 paladin. All on different servers of course.
---
You dont need to jump, boosted myself in wc a couple of days ago and had on follow. Worked like a charm
---
Actually with the gating system and the ability to skip stuff if you learn it it's not too bad.
---
The biggest problem is the torch room. Almost every group fails there because coordination is stupidly awful with most groups. Tanks who overpull, ignore marks that dps put up, pull groups they don't need to etc.  
---
The game has a really good built in voice chat client now, and I have had 2 groups use it total. As a healer by the time I give an update in text it's too late, so there is no point trying to point out a mistake someone is making. I have seem full clears of BRD in under 90 minutes with a fully coordinated group pulling single groups and just never wasting resources. I have seen three hour runs with half clears that fall apart because people are wanting to rush but not communicate...
---
This instance is the epitome of people wanting to go fast, and doing everything they can do make it slow.
---
It blows my mind that an adult is actually this confused that other people play videos games this much. Mages can hit 60 is ~4 days played if they try hard ~10 is average for someone who isn’t stupid. The game has been out for a month, I know people who have been logged in for over 50% of that time.
---
I think this visual emote was added in WotLK, not completely sure.
---
The best source for coefficients is wowhead since it gets the numbers directly from the client spell data, for example for Shadow Bolt:
---
&gt;SP mod: 0.857  
---

---
Lol, only for things I don't need to have at the ready. I've just been too lazy to organize and rebind everything.
---
Playing horde with some friends who plan on doing mostly PVP. I would like to try raiding since I have never done it but of course would like the luxury of switching to a PVP spec when possible so I can play with friends. Can you reccomend a Class &amp; Spec that does not require a respec to switch between raiding and PVP? And of those, are there any that can use the same gear on both?
---
I have tried to research this and have seen: If your class can heal then you are expected to heal in raids and that's all youll get gear for as well unless every other DPS that wants it has their fill already. So if that is the case, you can't gear up a Priest, Shaman, or Druid for a PVP spec through just raiding, right? If those are ruled out, what about Warlock, Hunter, and Rogue? Any of those where you can share a spec, AND gear, AND get the gear from raids to use for both PVP and PVE?
---
Lots of people have the razer naga or logitech mouse equivalent where buttons are in a 3x4 formation. You just press shift with one hand and choose one of the 12 buttons on your mouse. With all the modifiers, you really have virtually unlimited hotkeys.
---
K, so in your opinion, where should I (Horde Warrior) be leveling 40-42? I'm currently on my next wave of quests in STV after Desolace and Badlands.
---
Which would make perfect sense if it was an occupied settlement like they said
---
I used to raid with a woman from Australia and when we did AB she'd always talk about capping the "race horses"
---
it was a meme before memes
---
How so? Pretty sure that last I checked I am not judging people for what they spend their free time doing and other things that have no impact whatsoever on me. I have a feeling you didn’t actually think your comment through very well.
---
Probably using a naga or some other mmo mouse with a 12 button keypad.
---
Majority of my talents are in Affliction with 3-4 points in Destruction. I'd rather focus on something that will get me to level faster.
---
I love handing out water and food personally, even if the approach leaves a bit to be desired.  
---
Over the weekend I started leveling tailoring and gave out a ton of 6 slot bags in the newbie towns. I had a blast with all the Thank You's and seeing the chatter in general about the mage hooking people up with free bags in town. 
---
Ports I have to charge for considering there's a reagent cost involved unless Im headed that way already, then I just announce a free port opening in 5 min and to pst for invite.
---
Gz! But what the heck is that skillorder on your skill bar 😁😁😁
---
You may be able to farm SM gy at that level

A friend of mine bought Overwatch around the time it came out and we played for about 2 hours. The next day, Blizzard had banned his account because they said they detected "cheating software" on his computer. That's great that they are scanning for cheaters and all but... we were both new to the game and he wasn't cheating.
---
He tried emailing them several times and they always sent the same canned response, never allowing him to get past the almost robotic sounding rep. Anyway, he reported them to the BBB and that's that. He had to buy Overwatch again to play it. Pretty scummy.
---
&gt; A.) 99% of groups do not spam aoes. Ones who think they are Jokerd and are on twich do.
---
Every group I've ever been in with a mage or warlock they will use aoes on packs. Some are good at it and wait a little so they get minimal aggro, some are bad and just start with it and die.
---
&gt; B.) what strawman arguments? I'm stating my preference as a healer. Mages that spam aoe get tons of aggro and drain my mana.
---
&gt; Your whole attitude towards using Aoe when there are 2 mobs on the tank 
---
Sure where did I state this
---
&gt; C.) Mages aren't surviving in under lvl 40 dungeons with random aoe, what makes you think that it will change at higher levels?
---
Yes I said random aoe didn't i
---
Making me do 1 thing 1000 times isnt as fun as doing 1000 things once. Stop thinking about replayability and focus on the base game. People wont have to replay the game if they are given enough things to keep their attention.
---
I love when I see a post on here outlining something I’ve been doing. I don’t feel so extra for doing it. Then I start to fear it will mean more people will do it and my competition will cut my profits. 
---
In all seriousness thank you for sharing as this is such a great way to make money when you can’t be at the computer!
---
There are a few common 'schools of thought'- these are my 2 cents. 
---
As a fresh 60 or when you don't have many epics, this build provides great survivability while also buffing your pet to help supplement your less than stellar damage.  This build is best at staying out of dangerous situations and being in control of the fight.  Ironically there are basically no points in survival either:  You rely on rotating cooldowns of intimidation, feign death, scatter shot, and conc shot to stay out of harms way. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cx0GzxgoZtVohthZc
---
Once you get some gear, IMO this is the ideal hunter spec.  You still get 21 in Marks for scatter shot, and pump points into survival for the agility scaling buff.  This helps you really push your crit% very high and allow for big combos, while using the survival talents to provide that extra CC.  Now you don't have intimidation, but you have deterrence/counterattack (not quite as good as intimidation IMO) and some extra resistance to movement-impairing stuff, and some points in improved wing clip depending on preference.  I prefer to put those points into entrapment instead for those sweet frost traps on choke points in places like AV or Warsong. 
---

Like all things hunter, it's easy to learn but hard to master.  good luck!
---
Not to mention there are programs that make print screening and uploading to a site like imgur easy as could be. ShareX for those who are wondering is a great program and easy to use.
---
Mages are the new Huntards in Classic, it’s true. Most hunters I play with are very good now.
---
“Detracts from the integrity of the game” unless they’re the ones selling the gold, à la WoW tokens
---
Oh I forgot to mention in my post I was also playing Destiny 2 in the ground while auto running and flying in classic. Lol
---
Death rolls are best for two players as Spider mentioned already but for groups get the add on CrossGambling. Handles everything for you and you can even ban people who don’t play from every gambling again. With CG the lowest roll pays the highest roll the difference. 
---
What we’ve been doing in Classic is doing 1000 =10g to make the rolls feel more exciting so after the roll just move the decimal two places.
---
You should try actually comprehending the comment before responding. Do you need me to explain to you what “wait to upload” means?
---
Yeah not like you are over 20 with 0 binds
---
Damn, Blizz really had to add the "!" at the end..
---
Complaining about virtue signaling is virtue signaling you troglodyte. Mounts are too pricey for you to just hang out on your high horse man, chill.
---
I wish I had an emote wheel
---
Got so lost
---
I don’t know if this is original or not, but it’s hilarious. Have an upvote.
---
Ditto.  Max settings and thoroughly loved my time in the barrens
---
I mean, two hours and still not finishing LBRS with a bunch of 60's doesn't sound fun. They should have left earlier tbh.
---
The drain tanking build for locks is pretty popular. Usually they run maraudon, skip past the mobs at 60 and then kill the princess, pretty solid gold giver
---
I came for the memes
---
I know I'm sacrificing 2 - 4 hours of sleep every day since I joined sept 10 just so I can play the game lol. I'm almost level 35 now. 
---
Typical gaming time I have while on shift is 20min to 1 hour a day but I'm staying up later so it's a 1.5-3 hours instead. Then on my days off I stay up untill 2-3 am so I can game for 4-6 hours but I got to get up with my kid around 7:30 lol. 
---
 I feel like I'm no lifing the game and I am literally months behind some people. Shit man I only got 13 gold rn lmao.
---
 I’m glad I came to the comments to see the exact same text I just read in the comments. That’s great.
---
Is that a Stan Getz reference?
---
Yep. [stance:1] will check if you're in Battle Stance before trying to cast the ability, while [nostance:1] will check if you're not in it. 
---
I'm not sure what'll happen if you don't have that there, but I imagine that, at worst, it'd recast Battle Stance and put all your stances on cooldown.
---
No I just like numbers man. My favorite is 1,312.
---
Imagine only having to press 1 button for top dps
---
This thread is hilarious! People here obsess over Asmongold like the Kardashians and its pathetic. You're all here acting like a ninja'd glove piece is the end of the world, but this is just another excuse to hate on Asmongold. There was ninja-ing in Vanilla there will be ninja-ing in Classic, you're all hypocrites. #NoChanges
---
You can solo parts of Mara, most notably Princess runs. You can sometimes sell runs to melee dps that want a ring she drops or just sell the drops for solid gold/hour.
---
What 15 people are we talking about here? Totems apply to YOUR GROUP only, not the raid.
---
Also, that build you posted is trash.
---
50/50
---
Even if you plan on playing very seriously you will be fine. Tauren's are one of the best races in the game, except when they sit on the Booty Bay flight master... Then I dislike them.  Yeah trolls get a bow bonus and orcs get a pet damage buff you will still be viable. No one in looking for groups says Orc Hunter LFG, it is just Hunter LFG. The gear looks so good on them!
---
700 on my server...
---
Darnassus auctioneers is one of the cushiest government jobs you could land. If you're on the ground floor you only have to deal with one actual person a week, the rest are lost newbies mistakenly asking for directions. 
---
The auctioneers upstairs supposedly have a sweet campaign of Bosses and Beurocrats that's been running for over a decade. Last I stopped by they were in the middle of a pretty gnarly restructuring encounter, yet hadn't seen their actual boss in over a decade. I tried to join, but one does not simply walk into a B&amp;B game.  
---
They might not do much, but it's still honest work.
---
No you dont lol I have a 1 year old and only work 4 days a week and spend every spare moment I have on this game and am only level 35.  Your gf or wife is being very very nice about letting you game and your kid must sleep alot.
---
It's amazing to me after 15 years they really have only made a few dungeons or raids that come close to BRD. Karazhan and Ulduar come to mind.
---
VPN
---
You’re trash.
---
You can go for the 1% crit sword from Mara but that's really a sidegrade from the hypnotic blade. Witchblade from school is what you're after.
---
I'm not insisting anything. You can play how you like.
---
Also level 38.  pacing bro!
---
Darkspear horde, /salute.
---
I'll pour one out for you both.
---
This really depends on the day. I've had days where it's been super competitive for quests that are shared between horde and alliance, but there's been no PVP. Some days there is a lot.
---
Yeah jesus christ. Maybe open a window or something
---
Just playing 6-8 hours a day got me 60, it helps having a plan of what you're going to do each day when you log on and not getting lost shipping continent to continent.
---
Understanding when its not worth questing and grinding out 2-3 levels, grinding out 2-3 levels in dungeons to go above the quests so you can bang them out easier.
---
There's a lot of planning that goes into it.
---
also, once you hit 50 and can start doing dungeons all day the levels fly by
---
It's the same route as retail
---
Man i waited 6 hours in Q just to play bejewled.
---
I will bite the bullet and argue that "artificial difficulty is not difficulty". From a game design perspective, artificial difficulty only alienates your player base and makes the game boring and not fun. 
---
Classic is  abundant in mechanics that add artificial difficulty. It also must be noted that classic also is abundant in mechanics that encourage player interaction in order to overpass artificial difficulty barriers. "Difficulty spikes" have a place in MMO's but they should never challenge the player but the community as a whole. 
---
The problem really lies in most MMO's (including classic) in the difficulty vs reward curve. On retail, this is almost a flat line on your journey towards and spikes terribly with M/M+ content.  Classic  success is the only result of having a better curve in this regard. But not even this curve can't hide forever the drawbacks and design error in Classic.
---
God forbid you spend 3.5 seconds casting a spell to help a player out while you are jerking off in ironforge
---
I'm in the same boat. I was in middle school during vanilla and played very casually. I didn't end up hitting max level until BC had already been released, so I missed all the endgame content.
---
I'm level 57 now, and I've been having a blast learning BRD, LBRS, etc. It's been a great mixture of nostalgia and having new experiences. I can't wait to get raiding!
---
Check out the shadow priest guides by Kala on YouTube and twitch. He covers this topic on one of his vids.  You can put the plus wand damage from discipline if you want but he recommends putting all talents into shadow from the beginning so you can get the spirit regen to help with mana.  He basically explains a five second rule where you hard cast twice, dot, then wand the mob to death.  It’s really helped my mana management.
---
It's him canceling out of ghost wolf to use earth shock not the other way around
---
Screw them for wanting to play on pvp servers without having more time /played running as a ghost.  Blame the people that camped and made the game unplayable for them.
---
Are you implying that it isn't normal to text people by writing my messages in notepad and sending a picture of my screen?
---
At that time not too bad but in classic that’s a big ouchy
---
The money doesn't hurt either.
---
I'm actually playing alliance now. My friend group wanted to do something different since we all played horde the first time around.
---
Why do Americans say something is ‘addicting’ rather than ‘addictive’?
---
never once did I make it sound like more work. It’s just as easy to do it either way. This is just something for me to do while I’m on the bus, once I’m off you won’t hear from me again.
---
Ditto. Most of my negative experiences are due to mages.
---
I think it's the whole AoE meta that's to blame. A lot of people have rerolled mage, glaringly obvious by the never-ending stream of mages everywhere. Way higher than it was ever in Vanilla, despite being an overall popular class.
---
I guess it's often a certain type of person who would reroll for that.
---
Isn’t the full necropile set better?
---
On Hordeside the week the /who broke the middle 'hump' of player levels was 28 to 35 ( coincidentally also for Thunderfury) - this was almost 2 weeks ago - this was from my CensusPlus scans - now it seems (from LFG) that most are ending their SM farming and moving onto ZF so I'd guess the bulk are 42-46 now.
---
Note that this was a Day 2 server, but we rarely had any queues.
---
[Does spit seeds too?](https://youtu.be/WgxfAdU_Ngs)

it does say who it drops from, the rest sadly not. The rest sadly not because the images are straight off classic.wowhead and thats how they are simply.
---
I know right? Nobody actually calibrates their monitor and it drives me insane. You can do an OK job by eye with various websites and such, but honestly a calibrator isn't that expensive and if you're going to buy an expensive monitor it's *absolutely* worth getting one as well.
---
Properly calibrated monitors make everything look so much nicer.
---
Dang. I played the BFA mission table while on a trip to Europe for a month on my phone for most of the duration. Didn't have any issues when I returned to North America.
---
There is most certainly an AOE spec. Also why are you so angry? 3/3 imp blizz and full permafrost is certainly a way to make your frost aoe better. Otherwise your better off in other talents for single target damage. 3 targets = aoe if they are cc’d properly.
---
As others have said in this thread, it's there even without addons on.
---
The first 60 in my guild was on 11 days /played 15 days after the game came out. Absolutely insane
---
Completely wrong. Try again. Not sure why people feel the need to push this sort of incorrect narrative. 
---
The point isn't about rolling 1-5 being difficult. The point is that its a possibility that you need to prepare for or fail. I.e. Difficulty. Just because you don't understand RNG properly does not mean it's out of your control.
---
There’s way too much going on in this
---
If you have herbalism farm Mara princess runs. You can get the ghost mushrooms for the +shadow dmg potions which usually spike for a ton of gold on raid nights. Warlocks are best at handling the multi mob pack because they can banish demons.
---
This is true. I've never heard the term 'Central Europe' before today and could only guess as to what it would include.
---
You can solo Mara at 60, and sell princess runs to players for black stone ring for 25-40g per ring.
---
Hey man whether I work at KFC or lick gravy off the floor of Popeyes chicken, doesn't change the fact that you went out of your way to attack someone for simply the way they play the game, you must be such a little bitch irl lol wonder what your mom thinks of her big succesful boy.
---
This is huge for getting good at the game. I use scroll wheel for kick and vanish to be extra quick with them, gouge is usually 1 for me as well again for the quickness of it.
---
That sounds pretty funny though, not gonna lie.
---
Are these phone pics just trolls now?   
---
people can't be this lazy can they?
---
Lol, I 5 manned that last night with a druid who wouldnt remove the mothers milk poison debuff. Most annoying shit ever
---
Marksman Hunter or Frost Mage. There are a couple talents that are optimal for PvE or PvP, but you can get by without respeccing.
---
Destro Warlock is standard for PvE and decent in PvP because you just need Succubus Seduce and Fear to set up your nukes.
---
What I wish new MMO would take into account is Ghe value of effort. Not in the form of dailies and time filling shit but content that compels the player to play because it is fun, not because it was obviously crafted to elicit our FOMO or OCD.
---
Classic is weird in that even with bugs and clunky bits of UI,  it is still compelling.
---
I have done all of this before and for whatever reason, am willing and enthusiastic to do it again. 
---
Only real drawback for me is hot having all my old fun guildies back in it.
---
LOTRO, before F2P transition, was probably my favorite PvE MMO after the dominance of WoW. Crafting had weight and questing and dungeons had a cohesive narrative that made me want to play through all of the content.
---
Why thank ya lad! Now go take a few breaths of fresh air.
---
RIP Daisy’s Dukes.
---
Jesus Christ take a break and make some friends or feel some boobs.
---
That's awesome to hear, thank you !
---
The Wetlands is the Florida of WoW.
---
You ever try doing a lava run? Takes like 30 minutes with a good group.
---
But rolling first gets you the win if there is a tie.
---
More like you need to get the fuck to 60, ASAP. 
---
STV won't be shit when P2 rolls around. You'll be getting farmed in Searing Gorge 24/7 while trying to run to Blackrock.
---
Remember, you only get honor if you get XP for killing the target. So randoms in the 30-late 40's range aren't going to be targets for max players, but rather people in the 49-58 range who can get absolutely gutted by a few spells/attacks.
---
It’s an hour I think
---
Dont forget dying in the area with the harpies and having to walk all the way around to get back to your corpse
---
One hour. Instant mail came when guild perks came.
---
Believe it or not, people lie on the internet.

Sweet summer child
---
Most people are not 60 yet..

You can easily tank ubrs in whatever plate gear you have as whatever spec like others have said. You cannot realistically solo tank as non prot after rend unless you're very geared or coordinated.
---
Reported your last few comments for being uncivil, have fun, blocked.
---
Why does farming dark whelping help?
---
I agree with the topic creator and am sort of surprised at all the unjustified hate. 
---
I'm the biggest supporter of playing the spec that you like regardless of what is expected of your class. Fuck anyone who pressures you to tank for the group when you are only interested in DPS. The OP is not saying otherwise. 
---
He is saying that you can still considered a poor player if you refuse to play a role not part of your intended specific spec when the situation calls for it. Is this okay? Sure. But are you less adept than a player who can switch roles at a moment's notice? Yes.

---
Anywhere in a hour, welcome to classic where even the couriers have non epic mounts.
---
That's probably because it's both higher dps and slightly better mana efficiency than frostbolt. Granted I'm looking at my level 31 mage right now, but for me blizzard on 2 targets is almost double the dps and about 2% more damage/mana. Most mages aren't specced for frostbolt right now.
---
I main a warrior so I get tilted by bad mages just as much as the next guy, but if you were sitting there trying to tell them how to play their class, you were probably wrong. And I have no problem as a tank holding threat on just 2 guys, so that's not an issue either.
---
You’re breath taking.
---
No man, maybe that's your experience but certainly not mine. Having chips makes betting more meaningful. Like if you have demoninations of chips for your 20 bucks for poker night and it's two of your lowest denomination of chip to play the game you're gonna be able to have a more enjoyable experience than if you all just put down 20 bucks and play one hand or whatever. 
---
I get that that might not be your experience, maybe different countries are different. Here in Canada though it's absolutely standard. (Interestingly, this may actually be more of a Canadian thing as poker became a lot more popular during the hockey lockout in 2006 or whenever it was around then).  
---
But yeah, it's no more "strict" than it is to play chess with a real chess set rather than a checkers board and home-made pieces.
---
But factoring time is hard, some of us need 10 hours, some want 8 (Normal) and others can do 4 hours, I personally have around 4-5 hours sleep.
---
Hell, if I wasn't on a week off from work, I would likely go to sleep now only to wake for 4-5 to then start work at 6am.

Appreciate the info. I'm not quite sure what you mean by multi mon perks though.

&lt;SSQRL&gt; Super Squirrel Squad | Alliance (PvP) | Blaumeux | Casual Raiding
---
Who we are: We are a group of friends and ever expanding gaming community that came together in 2015 with a goal in mind, to help raise money through extra life for our local children’s hospital (Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia). Although we have busy lives, a bunch if us took the plunge into WoW classic. Some of us are veterans that raided Naxx in vanilla, others are new and experiencing classic for the first time, and everything else in between.
---
What we want to accomplish: We want to group together with mature players that want to experience content at a more casual pace, but more importantly we want to get chill people to join us and our community. We plan on leveling up and doing some raids, with some PvP mixed in here and there. Discord is up and website is still pending.
---
Raid times: TBD. We have alot of people from varying walks of life (some with kids etc.) We’re still figuring out our raid times, but most likely towards the weekend (Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays)
---
Raid Loot Rules: For now, i think we can /roll on items and be fair about it. In a full guild run my preferred style is loot council.
---
Recruiting Needs: Right now, we still have a number of folks leveling. We need all classes 45+. I will also be in the hunt for some class officers to help with loot council and raid control.
---
Up front rules: Dont be a jerk (unless its to the horde). If I need to say more than this, it probably isn’t the guild for you.
---
How to get in touch: Message me on Bootaylight (Paladin) either in game or through mail, and we can chat.
---
Discord: https://discord.gg/YgTR9DC
---
Why don’t paladins just use /taunt when they tank?
---
It gets hot in that desert man.
---
Exactly.
---
Move along white knight
---
I feel cooler for knowing where this is from, lol.
---
I always thought it was more Swamp of Sorrows
---
Guess i never really had much problem with that, when i farmed murlocs in azshara from 54-56 i basically stayed in cat the whole time except for popping out for a heal every few pulls and never had mana issues.
---
 I could see the int/spi being a bigger deal in more contested pvp areas though
---
HAIL HYDRA!

Damn that’s awful. I just spent 9 days logging in from Japan and haven’t been banned ...

---
My mistake for crediting the wrong person.
---
What gets me is that if you are on your computer, it takes LONGER to snap a pic and upload than it does to print screen and upload.
---
I dunno about challenges. To me classic is a game that’s very easy to enjoy without wanting any challenge at all. It’s all about progression at baby steps. Sort of like we do in real life. Most of us:)
---
I find retail more frustrating hard so hard that you can’t progress unless you beat it.
---
I think there needs to be a clear distinction between someone putting in massive effort to learn the game, and someone who has spent 15 years perfecting his wow experience on private servers. Both I would consider hardcore, but will reflect very differently on the metrics posted above.

I wasn't criticizing you. I was talking about people on the other side of the coin. Easy there.

Interestingly enough, I spent 3 weeks in Europe recently in different countries and logged in everyday without issue upon return to the US. I wonder what exactly causes the flags to go up and cause a suspension.

My second message was “nevermind thanks” because I had a guildie make me water. And my nevermind thanks was when I saw the ignore.

No, they were being genuine... I'll link it.

---
I honestly don't think people understand their class and others well enough, they're too used to retail.
---
Edit: for the record, I'm not saying it's not possibly an upgrade or that those stats don't matter to hunters, just that saying it was best at that level was over the top.
---
Edit 2: realizing it was a staff, not cloth piece, but I think my point stands.
---
I play a shaman on grobbulus. Often I will put on my healing set and invite all warriors/rogues and just let them go to town with no specific tank. If we have enough damage, there's no need for one!
---
Only the vocal \#NOCHANGES morons who never actually played Vanilla were up in arms about the addon because anyone who actually played Vanilla know these addons existed at that time too. 
---
As for insta-teleporting to dungeons, I can't tell you how many times my run to a dungeon in Classic has resulted in helping others out along the way with a quest or if they're getting ganked.
---
Cross server LFG allows people to act like assholes without consequences because you'll never see them again.

I love bright landscape. What I hate is fog indoors when it's raining outside, or when there's a sandstorm. Can't see shit. Wish i could turn that off.

Yeah Araxom looked into and confirmed it was a false positive.

Inside of the caverns of time.
---
Had a group for UBRS yesterday.  Healer one of the first people in group.
---
We get filled, get to the zone, healer decides to tell us it's not worth running if he doesn't get the Briarwood Reed.
---
Raid leader, a mage, says fine.  Boots the healer, picks up another.  Asks me to summon him.  The first healer starts complaining outside instance, "Why you kick me out?"
---
Raid leader says "Youre a healer wanting priority on a DPS trinket, we got 4 casters and you dropped an ultimatum right as we're ready to go.  Go fuck yourself."
---
Raid goes drama free with new healer.  Reed didn't drop.
---

---
Just started a shaman and want to focus on PvP, do you guys recommend skinning/LW or engineering?
---
Someone is elitist because they are looking for 2 mages? Did you even talk to them or you just assume people are horrible if they even think of grouping with multiple mages? Y’all are the problem haha.
---
Agree and good point. There is a lot of loot in classic too but it’s mostly easily spotted as vendor trash. In retail one needs to run analysis on everything. It’s sickening.
---
This is a default feature that you can turn on in Interface Options.
---
It's called "Show Target of Target" or something to that effect.
---
Your /played at 35? Remember time spent in game is not equal as far as leveling goes. People level at extraordinarily different rates. He could also be neglecting his baby but I digress.
---
I can already see it. What will get me viewers. Oh a dog! Buys a dog to put on stream.
---

---
Hummm, I might try it later! Thanks for the heads up!
---
Understandable, see you in 10minutes.
---
I dunno about this one. I play from Saudi Arabia and have an NA account and never had an issue. There might be more to this story OP isnt telling.
---
I did the same thing, except all my tank friends were able to spam dungeons while I slept and got to 60 a week ago. Now they are too busy with mc to help me through brd. Feels bad.
---
the shouts do great threat on pulls of 5+, but only if the dps lets you land 2 or 3 before they start.   
---
if they won't work with you, focus on the elites in the pack  and keep them off the healer.
---
No

Trash there's no point on popping it, trash doesn't live long enough to be effective.

Oh yeah but as shiny as CoT though!

I'd love a classic+ that included BC and WotLK content while... tweaking... the item progression.

The thing is, Jintha'alor is essentially an open world dungeon. Meaning you can take an "army" (10man raid) over there and not have much of a challenge if you want. All the quests are complete-able as a raid since you can just leave the raid at the end once you reach the safe "quest completion" area.
---
Ya BFD is insanely easy. We said fuck it waiting for a tank and then also our rogue dced right before we started and never came back so a preist, my hunter, and a warrior using a 2h did the entire dungeon without dying.
---
Replace "deathwing" with a less specific phrase and it would work just fine. "That dragon" or something like that would work.
---
This doesn’t even make sense...
---
Pirates in Tanaris were my little secret for a while. Volatile Rum sells really well, plus cloth drops and they have a good density to either take on multiple or just 1-2 at a time.
---
You'd have to have a 2H that is of similar level to really compare. But yeah in my experience, I dont know if 2H is slower, but it certainly feels slower.
---
I was thinking this as i read the thread. Im glad someone beat me to this
---
6 days played is 5 hours every day since launch. That is pretty hard core gaming. Especially since most ppl don't want to play every day.
---
I have some disappointing news about the nature of the World of Warcraft and it's anecdotes.

Playing for any money at all isn't casual lmfao. Somehow in your mind playing poker for free or for money is both casual, but as soon as you ask someone to put money on the table at the start of the game THAT crosses the line into a non casual game...? hahahahhahahhahaha
---
You probably want full uptime for higher end bosses (BWL+) but for tanking, one is fine. Build threat, swap to a mitigation weapon and just maintain it for the rest.
---
Lair
---
fair point, my mistake
---
Ah, BiS for leveling. Still think that's silly since leveling hunters is especially easy...
---
 I wouldn't roll on caster gear over them but that's just me. It's just not needed.
---
Nice, even better!
---
Dismount and stand there. If they're replenishing hp/mana wait for them to fill up. Most people get the hint.
---
If you win, stay at their corpse and help them fend off any mobs that might have respawned.
---
So everythings fine as long as it doesnt directly happen to me?
---
First they came for the socialists....
---
You will wanna do the math on how long it takes you to gather the materials needed for the inlaid, this will tell you how much gold per hour you are making gathering the mats for it, it might be less of a profit to buy them but in time you are saving you might be able to make more gold per hour of effort
---
Hmm yeah I don't get enough hours in the day or sunlight lol. Life is short and tho I'm 29 I already feel like life is moving way way too fast and I just want it to slow down so I can enjoy the little things more
---
It’s just like real life, anyone could potentially kill anyone, it’s just they don’t. Well at least not all the time. Life is like one giant PvP server. What makes it noteworthy is that people from opposites (opposite backgrounds, race etc.)can actually get along.
---
Uh.. Here I am with my level 30 first character. Seems like my time spent means I'm less experienced with these kinds of interactions. But also means less stress/rage moments. I was a mage in BC/WOTLK, am a mage now and it's fun but you gotta pace yourself. It's a game after all, can't control what every one else does.
---
try spending 11 hours grinding yetis for the staff drop (hills)
---
The biggest 'issue' is the size, as it makes you a more obvious target, pshycologically speaking.
---
The hardcore players are gonna be higher.  And the hardcore players are the ones you're more likely to see because they are on more often.  Yes there are a ton of low-mid level players but they're busy working fulltime, being away for some weekends and having hobbies that aren't WoW.  Also if you take a week of to do nothing but play Wow 12-16 hours a day you'll probably not have an issue hitting cap.
---
Here's a dumb hunter question that I can't seem to find a straight answer to in guides:
---
Is it necessary to retame higher level versions of pets you own to get their higher ranked skills?
---
Example: I tame a level 12 bear who starts with Claw 2. In order to learn Claw 3, will I need to find a 16+ bear, tame that, learn it, then teach it to my original bear?
---
As a non-mage, what is a reasonable tip for water? Portals?
---
I recommend Mining OR Herbalism in addition to Skinning until you are AT LEAST 40+.
---
Leatherworking is not great in Vanilla outside of a couple endgame recipes.
---
Engineering is arguably the best PvP Profession, but it will do nothing for you besides suck up all your mount money before endgame.
---
My advice for you is to go Mining/ Skinning, and then later drop Skinning for Engineering once you are higher level.
---
Depends too if you're stuck fighting tighter packed groups of enemies you have to heal more often, or burn mana for roots, warstomp/regrowth/rejuv combo, etc.  Or questing with a friend!
---
Dude you are awesome!!
---
It really is a meme. I always thought it was interesting how damn near impossible it was to find a BRD group on private servers despite so many people claiming it is their favorite dungeon.
---
When push comes to shove, the peoole claiming to love it will do it a few times then never want to step foot in the place ever again, which is what 99% of people Ive ever played with do.
---
Edit: i also think BRD is a magic wand to wave at retail to say "look at how vanilla dungeons were" for people who hate on that game. But people conveniently ignore the fact that scarlet monastary is about a million times more popular than BRD, and that is the most linear instance in the entire game. BRD love is mostly about bullshit gamer cred if you ask me.
---
Saturday night we spent 4+ hours in there doing a quest run and farming experience. We did just about everything and only got stopped by the Lyceum when our level 52 tank couldn't handle it anymore. I got the entirety of level 56 on that run.
---
Sunday night we went back with one mission; kill the Emperor and save the Princess.
---
We worked our way through the dungeon and despite some run-saving soul stones, we made it through the Lyceum. When we arrived at the Emperor, the tank (now 54) clearly was not going to survive both bosses beating on him. So we hatched a plan. The warrior would hold Princess out of the way while the hunters used the stairs to kite Emperor around the room. The result? One more of those soul stones had to be used.
---
We picked ourselves back up, but this was our last shot. The pull came and this time the hunters were on their game; until the one with aggro got stunned. Time for the pally to save the day. One bubble later and Emperor was beating a pet to death while the hunter escaped. Before long, the Emperor was dead, and all of us mid-50s heroes now had a fantastic story to tell.
---
I am currenty playing a shadow priest and thinking about buying a staff which does shadow damage. Is the damage of the staff increased by shadow form and the 5*3% shadow damage talent?
---
bruh
---
To be fair, anything after 2010 wouldn't help you learn that because the last time someone actually walked in to ST was in 3.2. That's not even talking about how bad the dungeon finder version of ST was gutted post Cata...
---
Definitely pick up engineering at 60, but you don't have to level with it.
---
It was a long journey, but I finally made it to Gallows End. I hope its OK that I am not a member of the horde.

The guards tried to keep me out, but I was determined.

I tried it for myself, do not try it with level 10 the best way is to kill the elites when you are in "yellow range"
---
Try to fill the group with other people on your level.
---
Im grinding with my paladin and it's perfect to have a druid that give me thorns and is able to heal me while I'm leveling my mage.
---
Weirdos in real life, weirdos in MMO. Sounds about like an accurate translation.
---
Well if you don't have 8s at level 20ish, you might be doing something wrong or you're an enchanter 😛
---
Yes, your example is correct.
---
You are asking people to tank for you or you will call them a bad player.
---
In other words, unless people play the game the way you think it should be played, they are bad.
---
You are further the issue by playing a warlock instead of a warrior or Druid.  If you want a tank for your dungeon run, make a tank character.  Until you do, you are only exacerbating the issue and trolling.  Which makes me think that you are a bad player, regardless of how well you utilize your class's abilities.
---
what level were you when you started this?
---
How many words do you think he got into the sentence before he stopped to reply? 5 or 6?
---
That's fair. I wouldn't object if casters passed and a hunter said "hey that's a great stat stick upgrade for me".
---
Its the idea of rolling *against* someone that gets me.
---
If you judge people by they way they act on an anonymous website you have a lot to learn
---
I haven't done WC yet, but that person would probably be me.

You can actually play street craps.

Did it in about ~30 minutes today and it was beautiful, felt so smooth.
---
I was always Disc/Holy priest main, Frost Mage alt. All the way from Vanilla to when I quite in Legion. Even when Frost Mage was absolutely the worst mage spec I stayed with it because I loved the spec, and not because of the AoE, but because I enjoyed the playstyle. I re-created two characters for Classic, these two.  
---
I can't bring myself to log on my mage. I just can't do it. The concept of being in this game as a frost mage is just... un-palatable.
---
That's actually dumb. Gkick him before it spreads.
---
In my mind, this is why goblin shaman are even a thing (later) - to try to offer such services to the Alliance if the demand was high enough! Too bad for them that they were beaten to the punch by Draenei...
---
Yea ur probably right.
---
This made me giggle xD
---
I think the orb of the forgotten seer from SM GY is better than the orb. 
---
The SM orb is +12 all spells, which is better than the +14 only shadow. If you use immolate at all, it is better to get the +12 all.
---
And the ZF staff is better than hypnotic blade+either orb. It gives a lot more stats along with the +21 damage.
---
Yeah your right, I base everything game time wise off of jokerD run so I just under stand how long it takes to do it the fastest way possible. I figure it'll take me 2-2.5 times longer of game time before I even reach 60 nvm the other shit lol. But I'm levelling professions as I go and I a total wow noob
---
It's gold, Jerry.
---
That was one of the first things I did. It's an eyesore.
---
Uhm. i rolled a warlock because i specificly enjoy supplying healthstones and summons. each one brings me joy its my passion
---
No advantage, I just get bored and start chars. Most are sub 5 I’ve got a few in the teens and two 20s. And a bunch from server switching in the beginning
---
That’s not even how cats work
---
Ok lol
---
Why are you singling out the alliance?
---
this is great. This guide is purely raid focused, but I'm interested in leveling and dungeoning as a boomkin. Mostly to turn heads and start conversations since they are so rare.
---
I his defense it’s fairly simple to hide particular hot bars.
---
Do you have a shit bucket or something
---
this was when i started playing back in vanilla. just google "classic \[insert your class here\] macros" and go from there =)
---
Makes me dread tanking it. No matter what, it's at least an hour's commitment. Someone inevitably runs in the wrong direction and aggros mobs. Then we all wipe, run back, rinse and repeat. And I STILL haven't gotten that shield off Kresh.
---
Whats the name of the addon? Ive bee looking for one forever! Although I know most of the dungeons, whenever I’m trying to explain to my friends where tf to go they never get it.
---
There's an addon called puggle that is mainly for the lfg spam but also tracks your past groups and stuff. Seems pretty decent.
---
I'm with you, BRD sucks. It might be better if 99% of it wasnt aome variation of "kill these dark iron dwarves" with an occasional fire elemental or golem mixed in. 
---
I get that people like things such as the arena event, but man do I get tired of killing the same shit for 4 hours straight. This is normally when someone says if you skip everything via lava hops or some shit, then it isnt so bad. But if you have to avoid 3/4 of an instance to have fun in it, it isnt a good instance.
---
naw i do
---
Turns out you were wrong.
---
Better than mine! Here is what I did straight away. Scaled it down to fit 40 man raids, scaled up the icons. Changed the health bar to vertical. Changed mana to show percentage. All good, but I have two issues with it. I don't seem to get mouseover highlight to work properly. Simply going into General -&gt; Apperances -&gt; [ √ ] Mouseover Highlight. All I get a tiny glow at the top of the square. Know how to fix this?  
---
I had to turn off the epileptic-inducing blinking from missing buffs and the fact that Prayer of Spirit / Fort (AoE buff) didn't share with Power Word Fort / Divine Spirit bothered me and didn't find a easy fix so gave up on that.
---
Looool
---
Warrior is the one class Locks have trouble with.
---
Imagine having not 1 billion dollars, but 110 billion. Someone comes along and wants to tax a mere 2% of what is made after 1 Billion dollars and people start flipping their shit. Is it even possible for a person to be able to spend $110 billion dollars in a lifetime?
---
it’s 3 gold u poor losers
---
Can you please revise this to include more jumping?
---
How do you kill one who has no life?
---
So I'm not sure if this is a bug or I'm not using it correctly.
---
But I've tried over and over again to have my stoneclaw actually pull aggro off me and the mobs just stand next to it and keep attacking me.
---
Does it actually taunt? Or does the totem just pulse aggro?
---
Just get a spider or a boar then. Both are fairly good to have for pvp.
---
Not at all. Picking the correct race/class combo is for the absolute top 1% who wants to squeeze everything out that they can. If you're not an elitist dickhead yourself you don't want to associate with that top 1% regardless so noone is going to care. Enjoy your Tauren Hunter!
---
Well the context is that I want to keep playing but also want to wait for my friend to catch up so that we can level together. So I figured maybe I can make money or try an alt in the mean time. I wasn’t super interested in the alt, so I thought maybe I could make money and do some other stuff that doesn’t involve leveling in-game.  
---
   
---
I’m not really worried about efficient time useage.
---
Sadly you can't have three of the same character in a row in a name.
---
It’s not that big of a difference from 1.2 speed for example but 1.0 is the fastest so naturally when anything is the best it’s extremely sought after.
---
Oh I got this.

Where can I find pics of level 60 orc warriors vs tauren warriors decked out with good gear? I just want to see who looks cooler
---
Sometimes I get bummed that our hippies got replaced by meth heads. At least the hippies cared about something.
---
Aoe is not important for trash.  I've made this argument multiple times.  If a party can clear the dungeon without any mages, warlocks, or hunters, aoe is not critical to the success of the run.  Which means the thing that matters the most in a dungeon run is managing your threat.  And that usually means not using your aoe.
---
You are hiding behind the frost talents as if they excuse your reckless behavior of aoeing.  So what if they are frozen and slowed?  You have taken threat from the tank and making it incredibly hard to pick everything back up again.  Not to mention that your aoe does significantly less damage per mob.  So unless you have multiple aoe going off, you are splitting damage, which again, is a bad thing in a dungeon run.
---
Frost is a better at aoeing.  I will have an easier time healing a dungeon if no one uses a single aoe spell the entire time.
---
Have you healed before?  Up to what dungeon?  I am rolling a priest and the runs of SM where the mage and warlock focus targets and don't aoe, go significantly faster than the ones where some jackass thinks he is helping by aoeing every pull with 3 or more mobs.
---
Oh man I'm way behind
---
This guy is expecting dps warriors to have last stand and shield wall. What a fucking troll op is
---
Nice. You can come back to 1000 needles later for quests. I just picked one up.
---
Because shield wall is talented...
---
Never played it.
---
This isn't the first but it is the biggest that I'm aware of. The highest my Spy's "nearby" count got was 133. I'm not sure how many of us GRIZZLY folks came out but 60 would be a good guess.  
---
These types of battles happen a couple times a week I'd say.

No, you just started the path down your own gambling addiction :D

I wonder what happens if you threaten to take action in court/ arbitration for breach of contract.

Youre paying for a service, that has terms and conditions applied to it. If they wrongfully deny you those services that you're paying for, there's your injury and damages

I always thought about doing this if I ever got a suspension from blizz, but its never happened.

Lol makes no sense but ok. It’s pretty pathetic to judge someone by their transit choice but fits the bill considering how you’ve been whining at OP about his phone pic.

---
You don't have a problem with new players, just players that do things that new players do. Gotcha.
---
May I recommend, as a veteran player, that you offer kind (make sure it's not passive-aggressive) suggestions to new players. Help them understand better ways. They'll honestly be thrilled, as we once were, to discover the best practices for their class/role. Final Fantasy XIV actually has a system in place for veteran players to be recognized as mentors in a way. It's quite helpful.

Yeah, you're where I'm coming from. Didn't expect it to be such an ordeal and to be told by blizz something contradictory.
---
Ackshully, you FOOL, shamans have
---
Stoneclaw Totem. this bad boy TAUNTS everything in like a 15 yard radius. Just because its absolutely garbage and should never be used in almost any fucking situation dont meant they AINT got a taunt!!!
---
One area I think classic works better is it gives a player so many areas to set micro goals. In the vein of "Today I'm going to work at X" kind of thing. There's always something to work towards since nothing is really pointless in classic.
---
Yeah you're right. But I'm convinced its trolls at this point. It has to be lol
---
I wanted to reply to the "Fake"s pretty much verbatim what you said but at the end of the day it changes nothing. They're going to do them and I'm going to do me and we're all cool. &lt;3
---
If it was a feral tank in WC who told you that it may have been me. No worries btw. I just wanted to give you a heads up on the typical norms. Our group was pretty chill but sometimes you might get one that thinks you’re trying to ninja. Happy levelling!
---
I went to Hyjal the other day. Sadly, no one was replying in the general chat. Was hoping I'd find someone there. Then again I did go there at like 5-6AM realm time lol.
---
Hetz getz bitchez
---
My mistake, thank you for the correction.
---
Faster than Amazon
---
Gotta get that rested time.
---
That's what people said about OSRS and Jagex
---
the correct excuse is that it is now in fact taco time.
---
I was running through stonetalon on my war with some green cloth helm I found. As I’m heading back to town I see a war and warlock running alongside me on the road. I decide to randomly open trade with the warlock and give them the cloth helm. They did not have a helm equipped.They accepted and I went on my way. I get a whisper from the war that was with the lock saying “I deleted the item from my friends bags cause we don’t trust strangers.” He then ignores me so I cant say anything back. As they pass by the flight path in town I /s and say You guys are weird. He then whispers me and threatens to report me for harassment. Way to be a dick at someones hospitality guy.
---
My entire guild, mostly made of returning veterans from the original Penny Arcade WoW group, has had a grand total of 7 people ding 60. I've played at least 1 hour every single day and seriously poopsocked it at least 1 day a week and just narrowly slid into 52 last night.
---
No just make sure you are leveling up abilities by taming other pets with your main pet in the stable so you’re not stuck with tank one abilities.
---
yea a NPC with his name always talking about punching Deathwing, you guys =cool
---
It's like no problem. Quest run everyones chill and there is always someone who knows instance and people generally like to be helpful.
---
That's great man
---
Retail is not classic.
---
Only if you're advertising it in general/trade chat.
---
I'm still 37. Just take it slow, I find the game the most fun when I'm not rushing my obvectives.
---
This is Hillsbrad in general.  People think STVietnam is bad, but lest we forget about storming the beaches at South Shore.  So many dead... gnomes dancing on your corpse.  The thrill of bashing that gnome's skull in once you have the numbers.  And then more gnomes, so many gnomes, they were in the trees!!!
---
I take super good care of my guildies, raidmates, and party healers, but when people come up to me in major cities and just open trade expecting water and food...
---
I usually say "Time is money, friend." And ride off lmao usually getting some similarly angry whispers about why I should be serving any and everyone in UC and Org all day
---
YOU THINK THESE BLACK LOTUS WILL FARM THEMSELVES?!
---
Think about all the time your wasting trying to prove you’re right here lmao. Both of u are clowns
---
The farmville element of WoD was a great example of blizzard not getting this.
---
They tried to make you the hero and mayor of a little fiefdom.
---
In classic, you ain't shit... but the world feels enormous and immersive because of that.
---
Do you even know what Shield Wall is?
---
And people scoff when gaming addiction comes up.
---
^^^^
---
This made me smile.  That is determination!
---
Side note, Gorishural would have totally killed you!   He liked sitting there with OP, getting drunk, and waiting for it to pop up that somewhere was under attack.
---
What a maroon, could somebody explain to my friend who rolled Alliance on a carebear server what just happened?
---
edit: my friend, no really, it's not me
---
So VPN while on Travel? That’s what I do.
---
No, that's gold.
---
coil is an insta-cast.. The small amount of times I pvp'd on my lock I would use the get out of jail free that was the coil/fear/dot/dot shuffle. By the time they're out of fear I've either potted back to health or team mates have turned up to spoil their day.
---
Meth heads are also really passionate, but only about meth
---
I've recently played in a plane between EU and NA; I wonder what will happen.
---
I guess you don't. Maybe you should look into your spellbook lol
---
A rogue snuck up n stole a chest from my brother who suddenly got into combat but the rogue didn't. Then he ran off and did a ":)" in /say. We then killed a mob n looted warden staff
---
Imagine if air bag providers wouldn’t care about false positive... shame on you blizzard, hopefully they’ll fix this.
---
No problem, not sure why people downvoted me. It works.
---
Don't worry about it, just enjoy the journey and have fun. People enjoy the game in different ways and at different speeds. I'm level 60 looking at alts...but leveling again sounds like a whole thing.
---
You just got unlucky there.
---
I started playing in BC in US, played WotLK in Japan, MoP in Scandinavia and UK, then WoD and Legion again in EU.
---
Hot take
---
Oh so we doing #notallmages but back in 2006 its was #yesallhunters smh
---
Did you have an Authenticator on your account? Blizzard has stated this bypasses any of their location detection issues.
---
I live in Seattle and went to LA for the launch to spend it with friends. I got a warning for account sharing when I got home.
---
A guildie also logged in during a trip to Taiwan and found themselves in the same situation. It’s really frustrating that they don’t care about false positives.
---
Only good vs casters other then that doesn’t matter. It makes it longer for casters to cast a spell.(better for long fights)
---
A Boar is also nice in PvP since it immobilizes a target for 1 sec, and adds 180 melee attack power to the boar's next attack. (Probably more op if you can land a crit and one shot a target)
---
Well dang... my message will probably not reach anyone then.
---
Lvl 40 playing when the kids are in bed? I am  nowhere near to this kind of commitment and I am not even close to lvl 40. No intention to judge but please, thats not casual play.
---
Interesting. I like it better on though.
---
Why does it matter so much?
---
I found the discord server for my server. And looked through LFGuild and Recuitment pages on there. Anyone who took the time to recruit out of game deserved my time. Found a guild of players that played together in Vanilla &amp; TBC. Joined as a Social member. Slowly just becoming part of their group by interacting with them and doing dungeons with the ones around my level. Whilst chatting to them about the endgame stuff they are doing.
---
This. Classic was $60. Takes most people I would say 10+ days played to get to 60.  Newest retail expansion = $50. Took under 24 hours to new max level. Dom’t even get me started on professions between the 2... Retail is crazy sped up. No gear matters because 1-2 hrs later you will be higher level snd get a better piece.
---
Or you can just save the comment
---
As far as rogues go, combat is not good for PvP.  CB/Prep backstab is respectable DPS and one of the best PvP specs.  
---
Sword hemo is very strong in PvP as well but much worse in raids and only really good for raids if your team is very very melee heavy.  
---
Seal fate can do well in both but requires a lot of gear (like around 30% crit taking crit cap into consideration) that isnt available until later phases.  CB/ Prep is the way to go imo if u want to do both.
---
I don't get why phone pictures trigger you people so hard
---
50 Shaman, 25 Warlock, 22... Shaman.  Wtf is wrong with me
---
Seconded
---
Just saying. It isn't a coincidence that this game is notorious for ruining lives. People dropping out of college, breakups/divorces, losing jobs... The list goes on and on. Most of those people didn't realize how much they neglected their lives until it was too late. They had the same attitude you have. It's nothing new. Just be careful.
---
My rates start from $80, with unlimited revisions and the vector file. Hope that works for you!
---
Pretty sure the streamer servers are worse
---
I saw a streamer the other day 60 mage 4.3k gold 22 days played time.
---
While leveling my warrior I would smash warlocks most of the time. Charge, hamstring,sit in zerker stance waiting for the fear. You can normally fuck them up.
---
But there was this level 40 warlock in Arathi who I tried to kill to free up the spawn I was in.
---
He just had my number, he was just really fucking good. 
---
I would charge in, he would then sac his VW, dot me up and chain drain life. 
---
You just can't compete with the damage. He then decided to spend the next hour following me around Arathi trying (and mostly succeeding) to camp me.
---
I got him a couple of times, but honestly he was just better than me.
---
So yeah, I agree with you
---
Anyone bought/sold a Warden Staff or is aware of the going price for one? I'm interesting in buying but don't want to overpay (relative to the average market price, at least)
---
Learn to care less about meaningless shit
---
I don`t get it, op ? ^^
---
This is true. Sad on both sides.
---
I don’t imagine anyone is using their PC for phone pics
---
I hate him. My friend openly admits to tipping 500+ dollars. It's a polarized issue.
---
Heyyy, thats me! I ran into you at the farms, we danced and had a good ol' time! https://imgur.com/q4ESYHZ
---
But then I wouldn't have gotten this reply in the middle of Scholo to remind me.
---
Thank you for taking the time out of your day to post on everyone's behalf about how much we all don't care. 
---
With this single stroke you have saved /r/classicwow

Poggers is the new woot.

Can we make this post sticky and pop up every time someone opens or refreshes this sub?

have you considered just not clicking the threads that dont seem interesting to you ?

Try out all specs and see which one you like best

Thank you so much for the work you do for the community, I know this isn't on you personally. If there is anything else I can do to help identify the source of these false positives please let me know.

That’s literally the second paragraph of his post.
---
whats wrong with the name Lemont?
---
Hah hell yeah racism ftw!
---
Yeah my endgame goal is to have 2 60's and have beaten all these hard bosses I hear about. Like Naxx but the end of 2020. So it gives me 16 months.
---
That much playtime probably doesn't allow for relaxing poops
---
What’s that bag mod? Looks amazing.
---
It takes a while but yeah I could try that.
---
Probably too low level for this quest anyway, Myzrael is a level 44 elite and I’m only level 38
---
Last night on my Horde priest, solo questing. Camping Bhag'thera waiting for the spawn. Two Alliance players show up too. Bhag spawns and I hit him with a quick wand and a SW:P, but the Ally Hunter/Rogue can hit faster and get the tag. They see they have the tag and stop attacking me so Bhag comes after me because of my DOT. 
---
These fuckers actually want me to kill their tag for them while they watch and LOL... FUCK THAT ALLY PIGS
---
I Fade and it's enough to get Bhag off me and back on to them. I sit by and watch as Bhag first kills the Hunter, and then goes after and kills the Rogue. She's at about 25% when they're both dead, and she comes back to me as my tag now thanks to my earlier damage. I finish off that last 25% and complete my quest.
---
Then I wait for them to corpse run back to their bodies, and /lol /thank a few times before running off to turn in.
---
You sir are insane.
---
Soonish? We're just 1 month in. Don't expect it this year IMO.
---
I just think modern MMOs are too complicated and "busy." In wow, you're dropped in a world, you get a handful of tutorial messages, and that's it, the leash is off and you're playing the game. There's more you could do, sure, but the game works at face value with little knowledge. Newer MMOs are just filled to the brim with convoluted features that are only important at endgame, they don't bother telling a story through the leveling, and there's usually numerous required tasks you must perform before the games works properly.
---
This game has been and will always be about time spent. Vanilla being the most extreme example. There is no other metric.
---
My friends and I were running from Southshore to SFK, all following each other and spamming /train. Got some very confused looks from Horde as we passed by, it was great!
---
But how will I know when he gets hit by a bus?
---
But from chat looks like you wanted to ragequit first...?
---
If you go to B you’re a psycho. I’m never one use use A or C though
---
I’m getting close to being able to get my epic mount, not sure if I want to waste the gold buying the mechanostrider though. Can’t tell if it’s worth another 500g to get a cool mount.
---
No way. The first character you create will be the only character you play. Doing it again is madness.
---
I jumped between this spot and the earth elementals and felt (without crunching numbers) that the gold per hour was greater with the elementals. This is probably due to the fact I kill them easier as a shadow priest and the ele's are much more abundant. I do skinning as well though. 
---
Anyone have have thoughts, or maybe have done the research and compared the numbers?
---
Hunters, warlocks, and S priests can all farm MARA bosses. affliction/demo locks are better since Princess and rotgrip can be kited, leaving your Dots to do the heavy lifting.
---
Now I'm imagining this is how text messages started (its clearly not). Some dude wanting to text his friend in a world with only pictures
---
&gt; Who the absolute fuck dives right back in after hitting 60.
---
People who love leveling.
---
My warrior is 4 bars from 54 and the moment I hit 60 I'm either topping off my 38 shaman or my 29 hunter or maybe I'll focus on my 24 priest/17druid/14rogue
---
Fuck if I know, fuck if I care all I want to do is raidlog my 60s and level more alts because I love the leveling process.
---
Yeah, I hoarded all the leather I got below rugged while leveling skinning. My lvl 11 rogue has 150 LW now and everything it needs to hit 225 once I'm high enough to learn it. And can I just say the Light Leather phase is the worst. I leveled 3 different characters skinning through to medium leather level, and I still needed to take multiple stacks given away through my guild to hit 100.
---
You can swap mid raid for it ..
---
It actually can be very unhealthy. People have literally died from playing too much wow
---
Nah, no real rewards, it's just for fun. Getting ganked in STV? log on your twink for a bit and get some satisfaction wrecking the opposition for a bit to blow off some steam. I've never done the twink thing myself but some people really enjoy it. If I feel like doing pvp while leveling I will usually wait until I'm toward the upper end of the bracket though so I don't get beat up too bad.
---
Wowhead model viewer. Can put on whatever gear you want and change the race/sex/features/etc
---
issa joke
---
You know the assholes who wouldn't stand in line for the lvl 1-7 quest bosses back at launch? yea, they are lvl 50-60 now.
---
You just made one.
---
Are you smoking meth dude?
---
Just so you know you could report people like this to a GM. They will most likely get temporary bans of atleast 24 hours. I know this because when I was young and played WoW I was pretty toxic, got multiple temporary bans because I was a real asshole to people. Namecalling and generally just insulting for no reason at all leads to bans. Remember that next time, don't let people get away with acting like this.
---
Considering your irl circumstances you’re considered a hardcore player in my books, very impressive.
---
That it's ok for things to be challenging, require time investment, and not be "for everyone".
---
If you can only play on weekends, or for an hour a day, theres still tons of fun to be had and things to accomplish. But you're not gonna be in Naxx.  And that's ok.
---
Did I say the context of the ban? Did I say how long of a ban ? Did you read the last two words and active your reading comprehension side of the brain?
---
Sounds like a nice goal, good luck. Maybe you will add more to that as phases come and new opportunities arise. PvP ranks can be quite enticing when you get your first taste of honor in phase 2.
---
That would fuckin suck
---
I just dinged 60 today and got HoJ in my 2nd run. I got it in 1st run on Nostalrius from Emperor. I feel the hand of justice.
---
Yea....now I wished that I accidentally used it instead of selling it lol
---
The fucking audacity to expect Shield Wall!!!
---
yes, please spend hours and hours of your personal time grinding mobs for data that anonymous users online are requesting.
---
I've been running 4 dps 1 dps/healer for all sub-60 dungeons and it's been working great so far. Occasionally you need to CC, but it's pretty easy and *much* faster than bringing along a tank.
---
Oh TIL! Thanks for correcting me!
---
Im 55 and felt kinda this way but not totally. At launch i joined a guild that i am still in. At one point i was 10 levels above the next closest player to me. I had a crazy few weeks at work and now they are doing the LBRS and UBRS grind + pug raids while i am still trying to find BRD runs. 
---
At the end of the day though, you will be fine. There will likely be raids running MC for years due to TF bindings, so even if you are late to the party - you will find a spot.
---
Okay so then I min max in one aspect? I’m obviously not min maxing too seriously considering I’m leveling as sub, not combat
---
you could use the classic wowhead character planner :)
---
Correction, **you** don't care. 
---
If we all didn't care, his stuff wouldn't be getting upvotes like it is.
---
Bagnon
---
tips on getting to the kara crypts in classic?
---
Well considering the fact I don't ignore my kid...but ya know thanks for making me feel like shit. I purposely get up at 3/4am every morning so I can play for 3 to 4 hours. Then I stop playing and help get our daughter ready for Day care, which my wife takes her to on her way to work every morning at around 8:20/30 am. I then get rdy for work, pack my lunch and get to play for about 1 and 1/2 to 2 hours. Then, when I come home from work Monday through Friday my daughter is usually already in bed as I work till 8 pm every night and its about a 25/30 minute ride home. I spend an hour with my wife and then we both go to bed. On the Weekends I get to play rough 4-5 hours a day and then I help my wife with our child in between. But hey....guess I'm "ignoring my kid" right?
---
To be fair you could lock out 1-2 dps classes and not have an issue finding more.
---
That said, locking classes out is silly.
---
The post is literally "It's OK to a DPS warrior" where have I ever said thay it's not OK?
---
Totally can be but the place I take issue is the assertion that iit always is. People have very different lives and situations and I have been friends with some who had debilitating health issues and basically playing wow was saving them from severe depression or at least extreme boredom.
---
But you can be stopped dead by a tree in your path!!!
---
Someone got the winterspring cat in like  200 hrs played, you can go for that :)
---
Or chairman meow*
---
thanks so much man
---
If you had the authenticator app I'm pretty sure you could have avoided this.
---
He sounds like a great guy and Wow gave him happiness. I think tonight will be for toasting all those we've lost and it seems it will be a long night. Great of you to be so good and loving to him. Wish i'd been able to sit and fish with him...
---
Just do you. If someone has a problem with such an innocuous word, it's on them. Obviously if they tell you to stop then don't keep saying it, but you don't need to preemptively censor
---
nothing, but not like a worst case scenario exists either, just feels fake to me
---
You found the flaw in statement.
---
Same with a combined ubrs/lbrs, literally a city.. with a story to tell. Just look at all the props around.
---
you do realize it's healer bis too
---
I knew some people would no life this game, obviously. I had no idea this many people would, it’s insane to me. Good for me but I’m still trying to accept that I will never have the same time to put into it. Gotta find a guild that matches my play timing
---
Lol. Touché
---
I feel so dumb... I’m the slow kid in the corner on this one. Can someone please explain it or what I’m missing?
---
Now everything is gold. Looks like we are going to fuck up economy here with so many gold. Btw have any spare in game, need to repair my shit.
---
*Thanks for the gold for this gold on gold post*
---
Race/Class combination matters nearly nothing. Play a character you like...
---
I'm all for it. Fuck the NoChanges crowd
---
Dude whats your problem...
---
Level how you want, but preferably, I would skip what you dont need. The biggest detriment to the leveling process is the running to/from quests. If you dont plant to grind mobs, Id recommend skipping what you dont need. Obviously this doesnt apply to all, as my intent for leveling was to getting to 60 the quickest way possible.
---
The deviate hides and serpentbloom is what requires farming outside the dungeon or an extra run.
---
Yes, that is very true. Honestly I am not complaining, I would rather have busy servers and peak hours than the opposite!
---
For real.  Prepaid healing effective immediately.  5s per heal, you buy what you want, no refunds.  If you run out it bumps up to 8s per during the run.
---
No problem.  I used to play retail on a potato and so I had to learn how to turn all the settings to their lowest in the config file to maximize my performance.
---
Beautiful.
---
I'm not going to argue with a prick on reddit who cant even tank himself
---
Definitely thread worthy
---
Two things  
---
\#1  Print Screen  
---
\#2 wash the finger prints off ur camera
---
be careful with that. with priests, it 50-50 - either they're carebears, only looking to keep everybody alive, or omnicidal maniacs... and they have the toolkit for it. fear, mind control, silence, DoTs, no other class (besides maybe rogues) can grief people so hard. piss off the wrong one, and it's not gonna be pretty.
---
Where did you live? Because in 1996 my neighbor got internet at home, that was huge.  (Netherlands)
---
Then in 1998 we got cox cable  in my house in Southern California. By 2004 I was a junior I’m high school and every single person had an AIM account to chat, by 05/06 we had MySpace, by 08 we had Facebook and somewhere in there, Gmail too.
---
So he can roll on it just like everyone else. Also the gap between Briarwood and the next best healing trinket is much smaller than Briarwood and the next best DPS trinket, though that's more applicable in something like a guild run.
---
That's cool, thank you for the advice 🙂

It's only obtainable by Alliance.

If your on horde grobbulus, /join Uber and ask for an Uber.
---
When their hours are open you can get a summon to any major city or BRM for 1g or less
---
Yeah Blizzard CS commented on this and confirmed the story.  See the above comment threads.
---
As much as it’s nice to have your help, this really is a support issue from the top. We shouldn’t have to go to another service to get attention for legitimate concerns. 
---
Don’t take this as we’re not grateful , because we are, but clearly this needs to be taken care of and not just blanket statement “fuck you you’re wrong and banned, deal with it”.
---
I hated this place cuz no1 knows what to do and it takes forever :( can rarely finish it.
---
Nah, having literally no life or ambition outside of WoW isn't something to be proud of. There's no way an adult is able to play 8-10 hours a day, every day, without leeching off someone else. Unemployed and still living with your parents is really the only way that's possible. If you have a job, or are in school, or are doing anything at all with yourself then there's no way you can play that much. 
---
Three 60's in a month is complete no-life status, and is pathetic.
---
I then agree somewhat with you. I found it frustrating when a warrior would refuse to tank, fight the rogue for leather gear, and have a hard time finding a tank. I do want them to enjoy themselves but then they should be mindful of all of this at least.
---
Maybe people react strongly to you due to semantics. 
---
Nonetheless, I think you're correct in how linked the two concepts are in vanilla. But I think that a DPS warrior recognising his weakness in tanking is a different beast than one refusing to tank. It def. Is an interesting discussion. Thanks for sharing.
---
Yeah I'm kinda dreading that quest lol
---
Changing your password is never a bad idea.
---
Because the absolute majority of the current playerbase would rather want to play TBC. I am ok with classic, for now. But I wanna play TBC in 2 or 3 years.
---
I read that whole chain 
---
Tldr you're a pussy who thinks being rude deserves a ban of some sort.
---
I'm not putting it on a single player
---
But yea I think everyone should have bandages ready so they can save themselves. I don't think it's too much to ask of decent players
---
It's always been an online text game. Players used to take notes and make area maps with pencil and paper, but I don't think it's what you're thinking of.
---
This is how you enable lazy twats.
---
Also get an authenticator
---
Tactical Mastery enables a variety of stance dancing maneuvers such as:
---
- Break fear without dumping your rage
---
- Intercept to a straggler or back from a knockback
---
- Apply Thunderclap midpull in one global
---
- Burst threat on the pull with 2H Charge -&gt; WW -&gt; Def
---
Losing all this means Fury/Prot is not ideal for dungeons, it's a very specific raid utility spec.
---
Thank you for your support! I see you helping people on Reddit all the time!
---
World chat is stupid
---
I had the same issue. Spoke with 4-5 GMs. Ultimately they did nothing. Two apologized (essentially) for how awful this entire system is, rest were just very rude and offered no help whatsoever / refused to answer questions. Makes the month suspension feel eternally long since it was falsely enforced.
---
May have to go back to the badlands to get another scroll.
---
European people usually consider Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia to be central Europe. Just an FYI:)
---
The game has been out for over a month. It took me 7 real life days to hit 60. That’s with only 1 day off from work. With layering, leveling is (more so before) absurdly easy and fast. So with a month of unemployment and just playing WoW, getting 4 toons to 60 wouldn’t be that challenging.
---
Haha this is exactly how I feel when I see warriors. Don't need a brain to swing a 2 hander, and the more things you hit with it, the more your IQ drops.
---
I happily pay 1g for 120 waters. 2 times a day typically. Ty mages for allowing me to cast and drink cheaply.
---
in the UK we're on the left m8!
---
Are you suggesting that because every term is hated by at least one person, then every term is hated equally?  
---
I hardly think you are conversing in good faith.   
---
Your argument is that since some people find black offensive, then why shouldnt we just use the N word. That's the natural conclusion of your argument.
---
There are specific animals that will have specific abilities -- you need to tame one of those. Then use their ability a few times and you will get a message that you learned it. It can then be taught to another pet that is capable of that ability.

Generally speaking, while leveling you need 2 pet spots. 1 for the pet you use, one for the temporary pet you capture to learn new skills for the main pet.
---
At level 60, you typically have a pvp pet and a pve/raid pet.
---
Agreed couldn’t even fathom letting any pet do this to my expensive hardware. It’s like a dog chewing on wooden furniture legs, discipline must be taken to prevent damage and correct behavior.
---
Life now isnt like in days of old. We vicariously adventure, face tests of strength and peril and engage in struggles of honor. We can vicariously live the life that satisfies or tries to some of our more primal urges that our modern society frowns upon or are just not able.  In some ways it isnt 'just a game', its  more real than life is.

*pops flare*

I'm at 10 days /played and only level 51\^\^
---
I'm a slow leveler.
---
This deserves gold
---
Sounds overcomplicated.  Just wait for the next boat/zep if you miss one.
---
In my experience with WoW it uses a month or two like this at the beginning of any xpac. IMO there is nothing wrong with dedicating 1-2 solid months to a hobby you care about every 2-3 years or so. After that the game becomes less demanding.
---
Not saying people don’t have issues with it. I just detest the instant judgmental stigma people have. Plenty of healthy and successful people play a lot of WoW.
---
You didn’t answer the questions because you can’t. Keep jumping to conclusions.
---
Yeah no idea. A lot of people are doing it now though sadly. Dropped from 50s ea to under 20 ;(
---
As much as I love being a helpful hand, understandably I couldn't offer (nor is it my intention) to be an alternate path of resolution for all account action appeals. Your fair concern is well noted by this poster, and I'll continue to do everything in my power to make sure that our mistakes, when revealed, are reported appropriately.
---
Ok, try removing the launcher string and key that I gave in the guide (No key or string in wow settings) then do this.
---
In Lutris, click the gear icon next to “Runners”. Go to “Linux” and click on the gear icon next to it. Then under “System Options”, scroll down to “Command Prefix” and add gamemoderun. 
---
See if this alternative method works.
---
You probably wouldn't get anywhere. They have a clause in their ToS (or was it EULA?) stating that they can terminate your account at any time and for any reason. You have to agree to that when creating an account so...
---
No need to have any sorrow for the broken armor. The armor has no significance, you are the one who has lost the most. I don't pass by gallows end much as alliance, but I can say every time I do I will be reminded of your brother. 
---
On a side note, the music in Gallows End is wonderful and amazing. You can take it and a memory of your brother with you throughout Azeroth if you choose. Make a macro with the following.  
---

Games been out a month and you expect an intimate guild environment? That comes with time. And if you continuously leave and join guilds you will never get on that level with anyone. The bonding comes through months of raid farming when the core of a guild inevitably emerges. Be patient my young zoomer.
---
Riposte is amazing since it's basically a free supercharged sinister strike at a quarter of the cost that also results in a significant reduction in the damage you take
---
The spiders drop anti venom that lets you remove it yourself, don’t they?  I always get a ton of them when I run it...
---
Well you get more sleep then me and work more than me but yet have found time to get 27 level above me and much longer and harder levels. I just hope you don't let these times be forgotten. Mines 18 months and I talk to him all day about what he was like when he was little but he just babbles back or ignores me lol. You work a whole extra day a week then me. 
---
 Last Saturday they were out of town and it was the first time in years I was able to sit and play all day (11 hours)  because wow has that effect usually 5-6 hours and I need a break even from my favourite games.  
---
 Just the math doesn't add up.  You game alot alot.
---
Hm, could be that there is only few ISPs in Mexico and high traffic effectively throttles lines.
---
In general lately, its down to ISP and bad routing with too many hops.

Wtf if I’m playing my sumo monthly fee I want to have access to my account whenever or where ever I am at
---
invite invalid
---
Remove the phone apps.
---
Because vanilla content is 15 years old?
---
Come on now this isn't rocket surgery to understand
---
Agreed!  And really you can't jump much either!!
---
strength is great for feral druids.
---
Its being awkward. Log out or ignore. They were even being polite
---
I do not have fun personally.  I'm addicted.
---
'Spell hit' does not refer to an instance of the spell hitting the target, it refers to the spell hit/miss binary condition.
---
Just because you play a lot of WoW at the beginning of a launch does not imply you have no life or ambition outside wow, nor that you are unemployed, nor who you live with. That’s just wrong and you’re a piece of shit for thinking it.
---
All I see are players not helping their follow members of the faction.
---
No. I demand to be asked for the heal.
---
If your gold goes up, you shouldn't be worried.
---
If your gold goes down, you should be worried.
---
Lmao have you not played guild.wars......u have to either be trolling or some.guild wars fan boy. Just to name a few a lil drunk but proving how easy it is. race specific starting zone 5 man dungeons and later different difficulties, elite mob questing forcing group, guild focus endgame(literal title guild wars) vanilla did not have PUGS, legendaries based on rare drops and grind specific professions, world bosses on a set CD. yeah u could say it came from everquest but vanilla wow was 2004 guild wars 2 is so many blatant rippffs its sad. But everyone has an opinion. This is coming from a lvl 80 ranger with kudzu who has full cleared all og gw2 content.
---
It was, and I do now but did not at the time of my trip.
---
My first 60 character was done months after release of vanilla on an already established server. It took me FOREVER to find a group to finally finish warlord's command in LBRS. Like.. people literally never go there for any reason after they do the quests. Seems like people don't even tolerate that place in order to get the ubrs key either since you're always looking for a tank or the key. AAAANyway yeah took me literally weeks of spamming /lfg in chat to finish that fucking hellhole.
---
just so you know, battle shout threat is increased by the number of allies in range of the shout. The buff has to be applied (or refreshed) on them for the threat multiplier to take effect.
---
Same thing happened to me , excepy i got psychic screamed by a dwarf priest. Rab through some faulty geomety behind the instance portal somewhere and fell to exactly the same spot you did.
---
I was leveling in Ashenvale as an orc rogue the other day. While grinding mobs an alliance warlock took advantage of me being low health from the last mob I killed. He killed me. I come back to my body, resurrect, and go into stealth. Found the warlock that killed me and proceeded attack him when he had full health. Rekt him. He comes back, gets rekt again. Comes back again and rekt once more. He couldn’t handle an actual 1v1.
---
I’m a fairly passive player, but if you take advantage of me in a shitty situation, I’m gonna make sure you pay for it.
---
Tbf, the player count dropped to thousands before they started updating it after everyone hit lategame w/o real endgame content in game
---
Damn cowcallers
---
Retail is slang for current, carried over from private-server speak (even though classic is now a retail product as well)
---
Can you provide an example of what you mean by artificial difficulty?  I'm trying to distinguish what makes something artificially difficult versus actually difficult.
---
Druid 10-30 really sucks, your levelling slows down, groups want you to tank but bear form solo is bad, so you are kinda a wrath/moonfire spammer before you get the good cat form skills.
---
And Andy is gayer than Oscar. Boom roasted!
---
Frost all the way, I’d recommend the AoE build as it still includes shatter. This will be nice for solo questing, while allowing you to get into spellcleave groups for dungeons.
---
Good way to scratch the hell out of your monitor.
---
Try double tapping the macro
---
You normally dont swap spec mid raid  though.
---
Back during Vanilla I remember some high level going around killing questgivers and once he was getting enough and trying to HS away, I came from hiding and counterspelled it. I was prepared to die for it for I had already won,  but he just stood there for a while and then mounted up and left.
---
And it's a big effort as an average guy without qol party search automatics to organize 10 ppl.  The effort was done in a different way and I bet it was fun too.
---
Have someone invite you, log out, they reset instances
---
I expect P2 before Christmas, Maybe late November
---
This is hard to say because server economies are very different
---
Or charge a nearby critter and then shoot to pull, next level plays
---
Oh wow I didn't even consider that since I play horde and never cared enough to level a paladin. But if my main was a Belf pally, that would be really hard. At least I get to play a horde rogue.
---
How did you get so much gold? I’m level 30 and I have 5g
---
So long term gameplan for this would be what? To recreate wow all over again, rerelease content that some people like and some people dont, retconing all other expansions?
---
 It seems a little reductive to start wow all over again on a different timeline and i think it would be better to leave it as is and work on a new MMO.
---
its absolutely been like that in past. i travelled to the US in 2010 and had my account suspended for suspicious activity as well. try to play outside your country = suspension.
---
Healing Wave 9 is 560 mana and Nature's Swiftness is a 3 minute cooldown. Grace of Air 1 + Windfury Totem 3 is 405 mana and they need to be refreshed every 9 seconds.
---
If you don't have mana to cast a single Nature's Swiftness + Healing Wave, then you don't have the mana to totem twist, either. You're just out of mana. That's poor mana management on your part.
---
It's not that rare.  I would posit that, yes, the majority of the time, these kinds of posts end up resolving in favor of the original judgment.  However, it would be folly to neglect the amount of times where the reverse happens.  Disregarding the ratio, the sheer number of players of online games means there are quite a lot of these cases overall.  
---
Now, setting aside false positives, there's still an issue: Because these things are totally opaque, players can get banned without knowing what rule they broke and when and how.  I've seen many players who thought they were clean in terms of cheating and language and etc and therefore went on a long rant/explanation about something...just to find out that, for example, they were in one game where it was clear there were 4 people saying /way/ worse things and provoking OP and instead of blocking, the person said something suspension/ban-worthy in response, or afk'd maliciously, and no one in that situation won, and it's easy to see how someone would block that memory out and/or think that what they said/did was tame because of the contrast.
---
I will always support these posts for visibility, because people deserve to know why and how they deserve what they got.  Even if they're guilty, they deserve to know how.  And especially if they're not.  Even if 99% turn out to be false, I fully believe that it's better to support these people than not, as long as the punishment system is so opaque and difficult to appeal.
---
Auberdine even sounds like the real life coastal city Aberdeen, in Washington state
---
Well there are better pants out there, like the Beaststalker ones
---
If you're leveling strength is actually just fine for hunters because of how auto attack timers work.
---
Melee autos and ranged autos are on completely separate timers so what you'll do is you'll have pet+ranged on one enemy while weaving in melees on a second enemy inbetween your auto shots.
---
Like, obviously you'd prefer 100 agility rather than 70 agi/30 strength since agi gives you AP for both autos but str only gives it to melee but str and weapon procs are far from wasted on hunters between 10-59
---
Lmao. If I was complaining maybe.. Think of it more as a public service announcement. Acknowledging others gullibility is hardly putting myself on a high horse.
---
I didn't know how attached to her  I was until classic. Crap. It's making me want to log into retail for the first time in a month.
---
quest in redridge, then duskwood and you'll fly through your 20s
---
BiS is BiS mate.
---
You can have a dual spec where you can do two things like heal or dps currently with the talent tree system
---
And thats why they feel so creative. Person designing them can just do whatever they feel like as long as there are some dinosaurs and druids. If you create a dungeon but it HAS to be 3 bosses and HAS to be done in 20 minutes and has to contain certain amounts of trash and be easily traversable and whatever other big design constraints there are, you can never make something iconic and unique.
---
Even if it's not optimal , levelling with engineering is alot of fun and the gadgets you make along the way are definitely usable as you level!
---
I have two characters in the teens. Fuckin a. I got a job and a family and started three weeks late. 
---
My main is a mage. Frost bolt is my main spell. Magi right now are really as fucking stupid as he is saying.
---
Succ isn't the solution to warriors, VW is. They don't generate rage when you absorb their attacks. Just sac, coil, dots, spam drain life.
---
There's also coffer runs, but they're less common.  Also arena angerforge emp.
---
The struggle alone pleases us, not the victory.

Holy fuck I love you

---
I don't even understand how this happens, are you severely understaffed? Someone tries to get their account back, providing every bit of evidence he has, and support is just like "eh, eastern Europe, probably a hacker, let's close this one and not even try to resolve it"? 
---
I'm not even sure why there has to be such a harsh punishment, usually when you try to login to a service that implements any form of geolocation checking, and you fail the check, your account gets locked until you confirm that you're aware of the action and that you allow the login.
---
It's great it is fixed for those folks.
---
I have travel planned to France and do plan on playing... will I encounter issues as a result or you guys found some way to resolve this across the board? Should I open a preemptive ticket to notify of my travel?
---
edit: I have had the blizzard authenticator app for ages and played in previous trips, so I should be ok?
---
You'll be using it till 60.  Enjoy!

Hi, /u/Casberg

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dbkdlp/party_ui_disappeared_but_i_disabled_all_addons/). 
---
Have you not run into any AoE spammers when you're trying to level? You're pulling a couple mobs at a time and some mage aggros all of them and then spams blizzard, killing 10 and suddenly there's none left for you?
---
You wouldnt actually be wrong, I think a lot of people would too, based on their geographical placement, but politicaly theyre usually considered to be western. Italy is usually considered southern because of its latitude. Hungary may also be considered central Europe. These categories are not really based on actual data but moreso on cultural simmilarities, which may be subjective. 
---
Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland however I reckon are generally considered central Europe
---
what was the weapon? just strikes me as really weird unless the weapon was useless for say, feral druid. kinda same as hunters needing warrior weapons.
---
Yeah sounds like a shitty group
---
I have been using some boe blue lvl 30 mace. Has a little str/stam but it has like 30 ap and at 52 I have yet to get something with more ap gain, although there is better available now with a good roll.
---
Nah, I just like playing the bad guy. Everyone knows that the bad guy is always the more interesting character.
---
why you such an angel tho
---
is there a console command to display name plates from further away?
---
He said he has one
---
Sold one of these on Friday night on Bigglesworth server, 400 gold. I was in a group with 4 other people all in the same guild. They were needing on all green items so the healer could "disenchant". Not cool, but I'm not a mage and can't get an instance group at will, so I'll just get over it and get my XP and do my thrash blade quest. So obviously when this dropped all of us rolled need, and I won it as a rogue. They tried everything to persuade me to give it to the druid, but indeed Karma is a bitch.
---
Edit:  Bigglesworth Boyz was the guild that got karma'd.
---
A soup doesn't count as a meal!
---
Fire mage FTW!
---
Always wait for your group before you run back.
---
In a raid, you can often have a healer or 2 take breaks to wand and regen mana.
---
almost everything? sadly blizzard decided against progressive itemisation, so we have stuff like savage gladiator chain or deathbone and many more items that have the statupdate from 1.11 patch. right now a mage should be able to obatin only like  3 items in total that give him +spelldamage, if the items had appropriate stats for the phase we are in. but blizzard gave them 1.11 stats and they are somewhere between t1 and t2 in terms of powerlevel. so the prebis geared mage right now, doesn't have ~100 spelldamage as he would have with proper vanilla itemisation, but rather +300. obviously this trivializes progression and everything else and this gear was never meant to be available this early in vanilla, but rather later on as a catchup for people to get geared for aq/naxx progression.
---
Unarmed failed.
---
Now its in-game on retail too!
---
I wouldn't mind if it's fair roll. Not an ultimatum where if I don't get it, I'm not doing it.
---
combat
---
As a shaman, I swear WF procs 95% after every ravager proc.
---
This isnt restricted to classic, it's just your rose tinted glasses as work.
---
This is hilarious. You clearly haven't dealt with blizzard GM's much in the past.   
---
You gotta have loot rules typed out very clearly for them to ban anyone for ninjaing anything.  There is 100% loop holes to get away with scamming.  There's a reason this blue post says "it's on you to make sure you ask the raid leader and have them confirm before you join any raid"
---
what are you on about. people do farm emp which takes 40min or general/arena which takes 15min. only full quest runs take 2 hours but you only do it once

Had this, always thought it just didn't work.

Then figured out it's called 'Pick Pocket'.

Macro doesn't work without the space in between. Lost out on some decent gold and items but hey, better late than never.
---
Got it onwards from level 20 or so and this macro is the best thing that ever happened to my Rogue.
---
But why does it increase my wand damage in the character menu if i turn shadow form on and off?
---
&gt;Just the math doesn't add up.  You game alot alot.
---
Well whether you mean it or not this kind of "implies" to a dad that he must game so much he neglects his kid cause the "math" don't add up.
---
Edit: If I seem fired up its because I am. I'd do anything in the whole world for that girl and I fucking hate that I have to work a shitty 11:30 pm  to 8 pm shift just to help increase my pay by 10 fucking % so we can try to keep our heads above water. And oooh my project car, my wife refuses to let me sell it or my computer because in her words, "I know how much joy those things bring you and I want you to have a hobby. Believe me my wife cried when I sold my Mustang as it was no longer an affordable car.

 &lt;Southern Gentlemen&gt; \[A\] | NA-Incendius PvP, looking for more super friends!
---
**\*\*Guild info:\*\***
---
* We are NOT a hardcore raiding guild. Our goal is to re-live many of the amazing parts of Vanilla WoW including leveling, 5 mans, world PvP, and eventually hoping to partner with another guild to do some MC/BWL/AQ on a casual 1-2 night basis.
---
* We fully intend to level at our own pace and encourage you to do the same! There are no dates you must hit 60 or be “pre-raid BIS ready”.
---
* We enjoy the social aspect as much as the in-game aspect. If you don’t like memes, trolling each other in discord, and laughing a lot – we’re probably not the best place for you. However, if you enjoy having a good time with a great group of friends, come say hi!
---
**\*\*Who we are:\*\***
---
* Group of mostly late 20’s / early 30’s friends that span from real life friends, vanilla WoW friends, and even some others we’ve picked up in different games along the way!
---
* Many of us have played the game in the most hardcore way possible (top 100 guilds, rank 10+ in vanilla, gladiator arena titles, etc) but now enjoy the nostalgia and comradery of a good 5/10 man at level 60! Be prepared to bask in the glory of BRD!
---
* We all have real lives – jobs, spouses, kids, pets. We’ll never pressure you into putting the game over your family or real life.
---
**\*\*What we’re looking for:\*\***
---
* No age minimum but we’re all late 20’s/early 30’s, plan your dad jokes accordingly.
---
* Friendly people that can laugh at themselves (and the rest of us) but still want to put some effort in for efficiency sake
---
* Drama free – leave your politics at home
---
**\*\*T’s &amp; C’s:\*\***
---
* US East Coast based guild on Incendius
---
* Raid nights TBD – we’ll try to find something that works well for the majority. 5 mans nightly!
---
* Loot: TBD but we’d prefer some type of council over a DKP based system
---
**\*\*Contact us:\*\***
---
* Discord: bHest#5914

* Discord link: [https://discord.gg/hxhX92T](https://discord.gg/hxhX92T)

**\*\*PS - Any alliance guilds looking to partner, please message me!\*\***
---
That shits for raids, PvP clothies all day.
---
&gt;Essentially, some people did actually try that back in the day, especially with botting. 
---
Oh yeah, I remember that. It was great. I got all my characters to 90 and my only punishment was I didn't have to play wod. The best part was when my account was unbanned I didn't even start playing again because it was rubbish.
---
Of course, my friend got me into legion and it was rubbish then anyway, but I sorta had fun until the elitism started getting out of control and guilds had requirements to join that would make pugs feel shame.
---
Also most players (including myself) on their 20th run
---
Blanchards Stout, 20str and 15 stamina. 40 attack power and survivability will last you into ubrs if you don’t want to keep farming MCP.
---
The basic design of Classic is to set up a painful obstacle, and then set up a solution that can be provided by other players if you talk to them.  Every class and profession can solve different obstacles, so you can solve other people’s obstacles while they solve yours.  This is basically what an economy is in the real world: exchange of labor in a way that makes everyone progress.  Without painful obstacles, it isn’t multiplayer; without uneven allocation of abilities, it isn’t multiplayer.
---
By the way, this extends beyond the obvious like group quests or different classes bringing different things to raids.  The mechanically skilled pro can offer the raid top tier dps.  The less mechanically skilled empty nester who has his days free can farm mats when herb spawns are uncontested.  The social butterfly can organize PUGs.
---
&gt;working on my 3rd 60
---
Isn't this the point of having an authenticator? To allow us to "approve " ourselves of logins that happen anywhere?
---
If he approved it in his authenticator isn't there zero reason for him to get banned? Do authenticators log your position as well as your login into the game?
---
What a shame.
---
Good shit. I hate entitled groups like that.
---
If aoe is not critical to its success, then logic follows that advocating for frost because of aoe over fire doesn't make any sense.  It's like arguing that bullets are better than arrows because you can make them in the dungeon.  It's correct but has minimal influence over a dungeon.  And it certainly won't make it more likely for a mage to die either.
---
&gt; This does not matter in the context of dungeons, there's nowhere near big enough packs for this to come into play.
---
It does matter.  If you are the only one with an aoe, using Blizzard instead of frostbolt means each mob takes more time to die because you are splitting your dps.  While your dps is higher and the pull is shorter, your tank takes more damage for longer at the start of the pull.  Equally damaging 4 mobs instead of burning 1 down means it takes longer to go from 4 mobs to 3, reducing the strain on the tank and healer.
---
&gt; So here it comes, it's all about making YOUR life easier. I see where the motivation is now.
---
Yes, because if I'm oom from healing your sorry ass or because the tank is dying from taking more damage, we wipe.  Putting extra strain on my mana is a bad idea.  But I guess I'm selfish in trying to keep everyone alive.
---
&gt;This is a false equivalency, you are comparing a run where people do things "properly" (under your standards) against an unruly mage/lock who does not know how to play their class.
---
Threat mechanics and damage still say that focused damage is better for your tank and your healer.  Your argument is that frost aoe talents solve that because it slows and freezes mobs.  My response is that your damage per mob isn't high enough, the aoe isn't needed, and your talents are only making your poor play style slightly less suicidal.
---
A mage that knows their class isn't going to need the aoe talents because they know the single target damage gained is substantially higher and makes the runs smoother.  A mage that pushes the aoe talents means they are looking for an excuse to use aoe.
---
You can increase the distance at which ground detail is shown using /console groundeffectdist
---
The default is 70, I don't know what the max value is but you can play around with the numbers.
---
I had to recover my Authenticator because I lost the hardware authenticator thingdo. The GM experience was.. special. That’s being nice. I had to submit three different tickets because they kept reading the issued date as the expiration date and was telling me it was expired so they couldn’t do anything.  But they were so dumb that I just opened another ticket instead of continuing deal with the person. Back when I was originally playing WoW, I felt like all my GM experiences were A+. I can’t even recall a bad experience other people had. But now it’s all bad experiences.
---
/r/whoosh
---
Yeah I don't think Blizzard fully understands what made BRD so great. They have Kharazhan in Legion and Mechagon, which they call mega-dungeons, but all they really are is large dungeons that are a bit less linear. There are no hidden bosses, events, quest chains, or mechanics that require specific classes to unlock.
---
Seems like some r/gatekeeping to me
---
Coil can't be broken, fear is spammable. You can break it once for 5 seconds, but for 3 of those you will be coiled, 2 will be running back to the lock, and then you're feared again.
---
Yes, mobs in the beginning are 37-38 and the last boss is 47. Most mobs near the end are 45. So you are killing grey mobs in the beginning if you're the same level as the final boss.
---
I think you should have said that first, it doesn't read that way.  But yeah, I agree that the ultimatum is very, very bad form.
---
Honestly, why do people care about chests so much.  All the ones I open or see opened have trash and maybe a green.
---
I won a roll on Warden Staff. I'm not sure what to sell it for. There's always 3-4 listed for 320g-400g, and in private sales the highest offer I have gotten is 280g.
---
neither mine nor his came across as sarcasm, just leave this thread alone man, moment of silence
---
They looked at BRD and thought everyone loves it because it was large...but that was only part of it. They missed the mark on just about everything else that made BRD great.
---
I dunno about that man. I started a week after launch, rerolled froma lvl 21 toon on one server and am sitting at 39 with my new main.
---
I've got a 2y old who keeps me very busy and a full time job so i can only ever play like 4-5 nights per week after she goes to bed for 1-4 hours depending on the next day and I certainly don't think of myself as anything but a casual player.
---
YMMV
---
Wrong there was two of them. Although one of the lower levels was his wife.
---
deciding which part and which bosses a
---
you do or farm is part of gameplay imo that feels. rewarding in itself
---
I was more leaning towards that your wife is an amazing person to you. But if that's how you want to interpret it then cool.
---
A look at the Alliance side of Heartseeker (PvP) at 7:30 P.M. on a Monday night.
---
There are definitely A LOT of Alliance on this server, but MANY Horde have been transferring over the past few days. It's amazing how much WPvP, ganking, and people (Horde and Alliance) are out in the world while getting ready for dungeons, raids, quests, etc.
---
I’m committing to a strict no alt-policy.. Except for my bank alt of course.
---
We ran with a oomkin the other night. He was oom half way through our Ragnaros kill. Won't be bringing one ever again if they're that useless.
---
you can do it with bleach also lol
---
And for some people, eating junk food is unavoidable and the only means to survive.  Saying they are bad people for eating junk food is naive at best and insulting at worst.
---
lol, some classes can make others' experiences impossible if they want to regarding mob tagging.
---
I say let them suffer. Hunters had to live with their moniker for some time.
---
When 4 casters are in the raid and you intimate its not worth your time unless you are guaranteed the loot, then that's a problem.
---
And again, it's itemized for DPS.  I dont care of it's BiS.  Healers have more options than DPS for trinkets and DPS should get priority as a result.  Most just want the chance to roll.  Calling reserve on it and threatening to leave the raid if they dont acquiesce to the demands is pure douchery.
---
The Horde population has significantly increased over the weekend. So glad to be seeing more out in the world!
---
you might want to look into the possible console variables! i remember seeing a video about raising wow graphics above the "standard" possible.
---
[here is a list for example](https://www.dual-boxing.com/threads/52701-Console-Variables-for-Video-Settings-(Battle-for-Azeroth))
---
the only notable one in that list is   groundEffectDist  tough:
---
with the blizzard interface options the value "10" is cvar value 320 however the max is 500 when you use the console command.
---
I did it with lvl 55 hybrid dps warrior with 80 dps, lvl 56 healer and one of two rogues was 57, somehow we beat it, trash respawned only at when we were last boss (and I even ressed at spirit to repair mid run). Can't imagine how bad OP group was.
---
It's so easy to level one AND they're good first 60s because they're good for farming mats, so suddenly everyone is trying to level a mage up.
---
You know all the good shit! Do I need to put this into my config file to make it persist through logouts?
---
It's worked for a few games so far, like Oldschool Runescape. 
---
I don't really think it'll happen because then Blizzard would have to admit that their designs weren't immaculate, but it could be a possibility however slim. 
---
I don't think it's reductive to take the base game and re-imagine it with an entirely new philosophy. Maybe even just run through to Burning Crusade before branching off into new expansions while slowly updating the game for the better. Maybe instead of a massive 70 power-shift it's more incremental, like to 63 or 65. Class re balancing to erase the "meme spec" stigma. Continued focus on specific loot from bosses and straying very very far away from the personal loot of current WoW. Continued focus on improved class fantasy without the class drastically changing every expansion. And so on.
---
Yeah I'm sure single target mage has more DPS than AOE. Does anyone really believe this?
---
"Goldfish is drowning"
---
I keep my skill leveled by shooting critters as I pass them, pulling with ranged in dungeons, and shooting mobs that run away at low health.
---
Why do you keep creating strawmen?
---
Junk food is BAD for you, it's unhealthy. It doesnt make you a bad person?
---
I can’t imagine being so upset over something that has happened in a video game that you go and hate watch clips and videos about these people in order to justify your hatred that is really only there because you’re jealous.
---
Messed up. I played all of WoD while I was living in Moscow and never got banned or anything. I never even considered this could have happened and I'm terrified.
---
I tried that during vanilla to see if there was a way to get to Nessy
---
Got banned from 3 months for win trading in RGB even tho i only ever joined random groups in lfg. Tried to get it appealed and they said 'we have proof,  sorry bud' then when i asked for the proof, and told them i have chat logs and proof that i never deliberately traded wins, they tols me that the matter was closed and any further 'harassment' would lengthen my ban. Blizzard sucks shit at bans,  ive been banned twice for nothing (First time was because a friend traded me 400k when i started playing again, so i got banned for 'buying' it). I've never had issues with blizzards customer service with billing or accounts,  so i don't get why their people that look over suspensions are so terrible at their jobs and act like fucking mongos. What's the point of wasting so much time on a game that you'll just get randomly banned from. /end rant
---
OP probably wouldn't be so emotionally invested in a game if there was anything else going on in his life.
---
I think it needs to be /equipslot 16
---
Jup but it only saves the price from the last time you visited the AH
---
Obviously he means he sides with the perspective of this player despite them being horde.
---
That's because they're highly exaggerated or sometimes completely made up.
---
No I mean more like how would you tune hellfire peninsula to be the first zone you go to if all zones are the same level? Like why would I fuck around in borean tundra if I could skip right to Ice Crown?
---
I'll direct you to the bottom part of the post you replied to.
---
Our hearths should all be in Brill tonight.
---
Just moved over from Herod (Alliance). God that server was so imbalanced.
---
Basically, suffering.
---
Agreed! Ive memorized so many auto run targets around org. Most efficent afk that's not a flight!
---
They shouldn't in pug groups
---
Well it’s not like it costs anything to the mage, dunno why they’re so stingy about it. I mean I don’t charge money for heals/buffs.
---
How exactly do I do that? Last time I played WoW there wasn’t a Blizzard Launcher :/
---
Edit: I figured it out.
---
Warrior yellow damage was normalized to an attack speed of 3.0 sec. So if you have something slower, that does more white hit damage, then you won't be taking full effect of your yellow damage. If you're slower than the normalization speed, then you won't be maximizing your white hit damage, since it can be beefier
---
&gt;In most situations
---
Does not indicate a definite rule.
---
It does that work my wife/kids account too, we think it's the internet connection going in and out
---
Ask where your friends might be playing.  Forget about faction balance(you'll likely be able to change for free as they are trying to balance servers) or we'll see server mergers as many people get fed up at the difficulty.  
---
As for high population...economy is better on lower pop servers. Inflation is soaring on high pop servers as that's where the majority of gold farmers/sellers are focusing.
---
Mage? You coward.
---
At early levels a huge chunk of it is just the greens and profession mats. If you’re like me you actually use them for their profession either on an alt or on the main but that costs a lot of potential vendor G unfortunately.
---
“Regularly” once every 2-3 yrs btw and no one is forced to play a game...
---
Please tell me you whispered it to him afterwards.
---
Oh trust me dude, I know I have a great wife. I've told her on numerous occasions through out our 10 years married and 12 years together that she'd have to murder me to get rid of me. I mean for fuck sake this was the woman back in my hardcore raiding days of BC/WotLK would legit cut up my food so I could raid and eat one handed on Tuesday thru Thursdays.
---
Dude just blows at this game and anyone better is clearly not casual.
---
&gt;Strangers on the internet
---
    
---
You what?   
---
Oh, you're such a perfect human being, displaying your magnificent    level of empathy to strangers on the internet. I bet it's also how you    are in real life! Surely it's not a gimmick for karma! I truly believe all of these strangers are legitimately crying right now, as am I!     
---
     
---
OMG still tears in my eyes from reading this post.. I hope you guys     didn't get the wrong impression...   
---
Am I doing it right yet, Gandhi?
---
I can fix that. DM me your string and ill edit and send back. :)
---
You mean the AOE versions are triggering the "missing buff" for fort/spirit right?
---
I'm not about that repair bill life
---
It would get tiresome if we got something like it every expansion...but getting nothing even close to it in the last 15 years? Kind of disappointing.
---
Higher level mobs drop more cash and better vendor trash. Higher level quests reward more cash and/or gear that sells for more.  There are plenty of tips and tricks for making money, or ways to avoid spending it, but simply leveling up increases your income exponentially.
---
This is idiotic. Their bosses are fully aware of mobile devices(you guys have phones right?). Main purpose of having them is to bring them around. That guy who handled your issue should be fired.
---
ah good ol Tigole Bitties
---
I never made any case for reserving it. There's nothing else for healers in UBRS but that doesn't mean they deserve to reserve it. But you're essentially also suggesting a reserve for DPS over healers, which is just as bad.
---
I agree that he doesn't deserve to get it reserved because that is like the only reason a caster would be in there. That being said, in a public group I don't think anyone should ever expect a healer to not roll on something because it's less BIS than the mages BIS.
---
Last time I did UBRS we had 4 warriors 3 rogues and a hunter. Unfortunately that fucker didn't spawn
---
*Resist intensifies*
---
So tell me please which category is it, i am really interested how you explain that 200ms dips in frametime that last for barely one milisecond and repeats in short intervals are not called microstutter. From my general knowledge i thought that microstutters are under frametime issues cattegory or how you called it "frame drops", but i see you think i am wrong so elaborate, please educate me...
---
GW2 doesn't even have the trinity or standard questing. It has an entirely different skill system and progress system. Of all the games to come out this one was not a ripoff.
---
Forced grouping is a basic MMO feature that lots of them had.
---
Vanilla did not invent RPG aspects lol. This is not how you differentiate MMORPGs. GW2 and WoW play nothing alike.
---
Don't think the alcohol makes a difference here.
---
The biggest benefit to this is that it allows you more flexibility in which quests you do. If you run into a quest that you're struggling to complete (low drop rates, difficult boss, etc), you can just skip it because you're getting over-leveled for the zone anyway. Then you can come back and do it later if you want.
---
You can get the offhand from Graveyard, or if they're a mage a quest gives a good offhand, then theres the Spirit of Aquementas from an Ungoro quest around 50ish.  So it's very easy to have a good offhand when you get Hypnotic Blade.
---
&gt;If your tanks can't out-threat blizzard after 10 seconds, **they're bad**.
---
That's the point.
---
The dagger + orb are better than almost any staff you'd get
---
My thoughts exactly.  Obviously play however you'd like. But frost is the most viable spec.  Is has a nice shield, and some really nice utility with slows and snares to help your groups.
---
Others don't seem to have an issue but sure!

---
If that doesn't work my guess is your version is different/not updated. Not sure what else it could be.
---
Tauren Warriors benefit a good amount, the stun is more valuable than wotf to a warrior, the hp is very nice for a mt and the large character model gives you a little extra range / makes you more likely to be targetted in group pvp.
---
Honestly among horde races I'd rank Tauren and Orc as ideal for warriors, though with different focuses.
---
Playing classic should make it clear that downtime and waiting and inconvenience are features and not bugs
---
I have been playing since day one and am only level 34..
---
*poops flare*
---
Holy shit lol. That's nice. My wife loves to game just as much as I do so we only game when the kid is asleep or at Grandma's.
---
If you see someone from your faction fighting next to a chest, it's common courtesy to not take the chest from them. The rogue in the video did exactly that, followed by an obnoxious smiley face in chat. OP ended up missing out on the chest that probably had, like, a banana and two mana potions inside it, but ended up looting a very valuable world epic immediately after.
---
Don’t forget about the abundant amount of fraud from the goblins in the area.
---
There is an option to move the X/Y coords in layout.
---
What guild?
---
Good insight.
---
Have you considered that you are just very slow at leveling? Or maybe that your baby is more needy than his baby? You seem like the one that needs a break tbh.
---
Lol no. Mages are just kind of annoying out in the world. Hunters had a kit that could cause them to wipe groups constantly then feign death. Or worse feign death before it’s even a wipe.
---
Im saying the priority should go to DPS because it's itemized for them and they have fewer options for trinkets than healers.  Caster DPS has to compete with every priest, shaman and pally for that trinket despite it being clearly itemized for their role.  I think almost every class has a bit of angst for that pally or shaman that comes in and rolls need on everything, even cloth, because he can use it in some obscure capacity.
---
I'm fine with them rolling.  I'm not fine with an ultimatum.
---
45 is fine for healing.
---
IDK I guess some of us just have no lives. I got my alt paladin to level 24 this weekend in two days, and on my 60 mage the only levels that I was getting 1-2 levels per day was around 46+
---
im in eastern europe and play on NA. nothing.
---
Dope! Can easily be adapted to remove some of the priest buffs but who knows - as a tank you might want to know where the heals are!! :)
---
You do you man, I don’t get why everyone on this sub always has to say something about the UI whenever anyone makes a post. Nice 2vs1 btw, very well done.
---
This is plausible and hilarious
---
I have a different take.  My druid is my starter character, and current main.  Being able fill in any role lets me think about how I’d like to focus going forward.  
---
I love druids, but there comes a point where I get tired of fighting uphill.
---
I have one alt right now who is a warlock.  My druid has herbalism and skinning, and generates a steady income.  I’ve sent almost all the cloth and magic items I can’t sell to the alt to support tailoring/ enchanting.  
---
I will likely be tanking with my druid for the guild, as it’s part of early growth plan while our warriors get better gear.  Eventually it’ll be an off tank or relegated to the bench.  
---
I’m intrigued by shaman, mages, and priests as classes I’ve never played.
---
One of us is definitely upset here. Lol.
---
Just make sure you tell your group you want the goblin before you start.  It's only a short clear.
---
Next time root so the mob kills him :)
---
Yeah, I just figured since he had all healing gear he'd go ele. His damage was real bad.
---
More programmable by far but less user friendly. Thats why I made this - not a lot people will spend the time to do it.
---
Here's a story. I saw [Heart of Fire] on AH rly cheap. For me, [Heart of Fire] is only one thing. 3x [Elemental Fire] every 10 minutes. So I bought all of them, buying more and more in the process of gathering resources to get Friendly with Thorium Brotherhood. I spent a lot of time farming whateversaurs as a rogue (they are pretty good for mob grinding btw), decent amount of gold on [Coal] and [Kingsblood], I went to dungeon to get my recipe and was so exited about around 400g of profit I will make...
---
Just to realize that Transmutation recipe I was trying to get will be added in phase 5. Moral of the story is: 
---
There is no such thing as free gold, guys.
